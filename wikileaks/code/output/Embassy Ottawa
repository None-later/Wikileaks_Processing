2.  AMBASSADOR ROBINSON OPENED HIS CALL TODAY ON DR. FRED 
DOUCET, SENIOR POLICY ADVISOR FOR THE CANADIAN PRIME 
MINISTER, WITH AN EXPRESSION OF U.S. SYMPATHY AND CONCERN 
OVER THE TRAGIC AIRLINE INCIDENTS THIS PAST WEEKEND. 
(THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO MAKE REPRESENTATIONS 
ON OTHER SUBJECTS TO THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER.) 
REPORTS ON THE EXPLOSION OF THE AIR INDIA BOEING 747 
OFF THE COAST OF IRELAND, THE GREATEST LOSS OF CANADIAN 
LIVES IN COMMERCIAL FLYING HISTORY, AND THE EXPLOSION 
OF A BOMB HIDDEN IN THE LUGGAGE OF A CP AIR FLIGHT TO 
TOKYO, DOMINATE TODAY\'S CANADIAN PRESS. 
 
- 
3.  DR. DOUCET EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE AMBASSADOR\' 
STATEMENT OF CONCERN IN BEHALF OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 
HE MADE THREE POINTS IN RESPONSE.  FIRST, HE SAID THAT 
\"THE TARGETS FOR THE BOMBINGS WERE NOT CLEAR AND CLEAN,\" 
GIVEN THE VARIED BACKGROUND OF THE PASSENGERS.  THE GOC 
CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SIKH TERRORISTS, IF THEY ARE IN 
FACT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENTS, WOULD HAVE CHOSEN 
THIS UNTARGETTED MEANS TO MAKE A POLITICAL POINT. 
SECOND, DOUCET SAID THAT \"SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN 
ORCHESTRATED\" SINCE IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT TWO SUCH 
INCIDENTS COULD TAKE PLACE BY COINCIDENCE WITHIN TWELVE 
HOURS.  THIRD, HE SAID THAT ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE 
DOES POINT TO USE OF A BOMB ON AIR INDIA 182. 
 
- 
4.  WHEN ASKED BY THE ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR WHAT TH 
GOC PLANS TO DO IN FOLLOWING UP ON THESE APPARENT 
TERRORIST ACTS, DR. DOUCET SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 
WOULD PROBABLY CONVENE A SPECIAL MEETING OF THE 
CANADIAN CABINET FOR LATER TODAY.  (THE PRIME MINISTER 
IS NOW AT HIS SUMMER RESIDENCE ABOUT 20 MINUTES OUTSIDE 
OTTAWA.)  ACCORDING TO DOUCET, PRIME MINISTER MULRONEY 
WILL PROBABLY USE THAT CABINET MEETING TO REVIEW THE 
EVENTS OF THE WEEKEND AND OPTIONS FOR ACTION.  HE SAID 
THAT MULRONEY MIGHT ISSUE A STRONG STATEMENT, INDICATING 
THAT, AS DOUCET PUT IT, \"CANADA WILL NOT TAKE THIS 
KIND OF ATTACK SITTING DOWN\" AND THAT THE GOC WILL TAKE 
STERN ACTION.  WHAT ACTION, DOUCET DID NOT AND COULD NOT 
INDICATE.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD 
SEEK TO REASSURE THE CANADIAN PUBLIC THAT THE GOC HAS 
TIGHTENED AIRPORT SECURITY AND THAT CANADIANS SHOULD 
MAINTAIN THEIR TRAVEL PLANS. 
 
- 
5.  DR. DOUCET CALLED THE ECONOMIC MINISTER-COUNSELOR 
SUBSEQUENTLY EARLY AFTERNOON, JUNE 24, TO CONFIRM THAT 
THE PRIME MINISTER WILL INDEED MEET WITH KEY MINISTERS 
TODAY AT 3 P.M. AND MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AT 4 P.M. 
HE ADDED THAT PRECISE INFORMATION ON THE CAUSE OF THE 
APPARENT EXPLOSION ABOARD AIR INDIA 182 REMAINS SKETCHY, 
BUT THAT THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST A 
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FATE OF THAT AIRLINE AND THE 
BOMB EXPLODED AT TOKYO\'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

2. Vinet was interested in whether the letter was to Canada 
only, and wondered if we were asking other countries for 
support of the moratorium.  We explained that the letter had 
been sent by Ambassador Zoellick to all his WTO counterparts. 
 Although we welcome support, we had only been asked to 
provide host country reaction.  The Canadian embassy in 
Washington had already seen the proposal on the USTR  website 
and in \"Inside US Trade.\"  We clarified that although the 
proposal is public, it would not be formally presented to the 
WTO until early January.  DG Vinet, who has only been in her 
current job for two weeks and had not yet studied the 
proposal, said she would consult within the GOC once 
colleagues return from leave.

SUBJECT: U.S./CANADA/U.K. TRILATERAL PEACEKEEPING MEETING 
 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (U) The U.S. participated in annual talks on peacekeeping 
with Canada and U.K. in Ottawa on December 10-11, 2002 in 
which a broad range of peacekeeping issues were addressed. 
Canada\'s Director General of International Security, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT), Jill Sinclair, welcomed U.S. and U.K. participants 
and made opening remarks.  Canada\'s chairperson for the 
talks, Barbara Martin, Director, Regional Security and 
Peacekeeping Division, DFAIT/IDC, made additional welcoming 
comments and kicked off the discussions.  The discussions 
addressed several ongoing UN peacekeeping missions and a 
number of other topics related to current peacekeeping 
issues.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
Civil-Military Cooperation 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Participants agreed that impartial civil-military 
cooperation is essential to bringing peacekeeping operations 
to a successful conclusion.  Military operations achieve 
little beyond temporary ceasefires.  Creating the conditions 
for a more durable peace and the exit of military 
participants requires the involvement of a wide range of 
civilian actors from the UN, NGOs, and civil society. 
 
3. (U) Civilian players should be involved in early planning 
along with military planners.  Civilian liaison personnel 
should be co-located with military units, both at 
headquarters and in the field.  Civilian-military operation 
centers should be established.  Civilian-military cooperation 
at the highest levels is essential to ensure unity of purpose 
and to ensure that headquarters and field operations 
implement civilian-military cooperation. 
 
4. (U) Participants agreed that cooperation between the UN 
Secretariat and other UN agencies through the Administration 
 
SIPDIS 
Coordination Committee (ACC) should be encouraged and that 
the use of Integrated Management Task Forces (IMTF) at UN 
headquarters in New York be complemented by the formulation 
of parallel structures in UN field operations. 
 
------------------------- 
Responsibility to Protect 
------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Canada summarized the Report of the International 
Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty which 
examined the question of when, if ever, it is appropriate for 
states to use force against another state simply to protect 
at-risk inhabitants of that other state.  U.S. head of 
delegation Will Imbrie noted that the report raises important 
issues for authorization for intervention in humanitarian 
crises.  He said the challenge is to make the link between 
theory and practice, thus closing the gap between think-tank 
types and operators. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Overview of Selected UN Peacekeeping Operations 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (U) Participants discussed the current state of affairs 
and way forward for three UN peacekeeping operations: the UN 
Observer Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), 
the UN Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), and the 
UN Mission in East Timor (UNMISET). 
 
7. (SBU) MONUC: Participants acknowledged the unique 
opportunity at hand, but noted several significant challenges 
ahead.  The redeployment of forces from surrounding nations 
is a very positive development which the international 
community should take advantage of.  The Security Council 
decision to increase the troop ceiling to 8,700 was 
appropriate, as were the safeguards imposed to ensure the 
second task force is not deployed before it is actually 
needed.  Several challenges remain: the issue of third 
country settlement; addressing the remaining hardcore 
fighters that do not want to disarm; selection of a new SRSG 
and appointment of capable assistants; and review of the UN 
policy on HIV-AIDS to reduce the threat of spreading the 
virus through UN peacekeepers. 
8. (SBU) UNAMSIL: The U.K. reviewed progress since the 
elections and believes that UNAMSIL can end in mid-2004. 
Further work is needed to develop Sierra Leone police forces 
and the Sierra Leone Army, establish control over the diamond 
producing areas, and reintegrate former fighters into the 
economy.  The U.K. continues to conduct military training 
under the International Military Assistance Training Team 
(IMATT) program and exercise its over-the-horizon force with 
regular joint exercises, a practice to be continued after 
UNAMSIL\'s exit.  The U.K. also continues to provide police 
training.  The U.K. noted the need to strengthen security 
measures when the Special Court issues indictments. 
 
9. (SBU) UNMISET - Timor Leste: The U.K. reviewed 
developments in Timor-Leste, noting that the police and 
justice sectors still require significant work.  Recent riots 
in Dili signal problems in the security sector and weakness 
in the Timor-Leste Police. 
 
-------------------- 
Situation in Burundi 
-------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) Despite the recent signing of a ceasefire agreement 
by one faction of the FDD, there was consensus that the 
situation in Burundi is not right for a UN peacekeeping 
operation.  Imbrie stressed that while the ceasefire 
signatories have requested a peacekeeping force, the 
ceasefire is by no means comprehensive and that the U.S. 
could not support a Chapter VII mission, stating that 
\"deploying a mission under the current circumstances would 
put peacekeepers in a live fire situation.\"  He noted that 
the U.S. had consulted with the U.K. and France on potential 
contingency operations in the event of a mass genocide 
scenario, but none are prepared to commit at this point, and 
all would prefer an intervention force from African nations 
with possible support from developed nations. 
 
11. (SBU) Speaking for the U.K. delegation, Mr. Stephen 
Pollard, Head of Overseas Secretariat, MOD, responded that 
Britain was reluctant to take on a new mission at this time, 
citing manpower and budgetary constraints.  He stated that 
the UK could provide \"small scale\" support to a mission in 
areas such as logistics or command and control.  He noted 
that South Africa, Ghana, and Senegal were prepared to 
provide forces for a mission, but only under a U.S.-supported 
UN mission, after a comprehensive ceasefire had been 
achieved, and with assurances that a feasible evacuation plan 
was in place. 
 
--------------- 
SHIRBRIG Update 
--------------- 
 
12. (U) Colonel Gaston Cote, Director of Peacekeeping Policy, 
Canadian Department of National Defense, provided an overview 
of the Standby High Readiness Brigade (SHIRBRIG).  Colonel 
Cote noted that SHIRBRIG is the only operationally ready 
brigade-sized unit exclusively available for United Nations 
deployment.  The unit has about 5,000 troops that can deploy 
up to six months under a Chapter VI mandate.  Brigade 
elements are on call, but  planning element consisting of the 
Commanding General, Chief of Staff, and section heads is 
permanently stationed in Denmark.  The Brigade participates 
in two exercises per year with either the UN or the planning 
element developing the scenario.  The headquarters has an 
objective of deploying within 14 days of notification.  The 
remaining units of the brigade have an objective of deploying 
within 30 days of national approval. 
 
13. (U) Canada will assume presidency of the SHIRBRIG 
steering committee in January 2003.  Key agenda items for 
their presidency will be to: focus on prospective new members 
(Chile, Brazil, Senegal), strengthen the rapid reaction 
capability of the brigade, foster better communications 
between SHIRBRIG, individual states and international 
organizations, and include civilian personnel (humanitarian 
assistance) in the planning element or incorporate them in 
the on-call list.  Members also intend to more actively 
promote SHIRBRIG as a model for regional organizations. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Building African Peacekeeping Capacity 
-------------------------------------- 
 
14. (U) Delegations presented update briefings on respective 
initiatives to enhance African capacity for supporting peace 
operations.  The U.S. discussed the African Contingency 
Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program and 
reviewed accomplishments under the African Crisis Response 
Initiative (ACRI) and Operation Focus Relief (OFR).  The U.K. 
gave an update on the IMATT initiative, and Canada presented 
information about ongoing efforts in the G8 to promote 
African peacekeeping capacity.  Participants agreed on the 
need to more closely coordinate respective efforts to ensure 
efficiency and avoid giving African countries \"confusing 
signals.\" 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Peacekeeping Reform - Brahimi Implementation 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
15. (U) The group was unanimous that implementation of 
peacekeeping reform measures was not \"a done deal\" and that 
we should work together to keep attention focused on 
implementation efforts.  The U.K. delegation drove the point 
home with an exceptionally detailed statement outlining 
numerous areas where much work remains to be done. Key points 
included the importance of monitoring the UN Secretariat, 
particularly DPKO, to ensure new posts are being used 
effectively; continuing to improve the working relationships 
between troop contributors, the Security Council, and the 
Secretariat; improving the inter-relationships between 
 
SIPDIS 
departments/agencies; and improving UN capacity for complex 
peacekeeping.  The group responded favorably to suggestions 
from the U.S. for a mid-term review of DPKO by Logistics 
Management Incorporated (LMI) and establishment of a \"Friends 
of DPKO\" group in New York to accomplish these goals. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Security Sector Reform - Case Study: Afghanistan 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
16. (SBU) Col. Baltazar of OSD/SOLIC/Stability Operations led 
the discussion, focusing on development of the Afghan 
National Army (ANA) and Ministry of Defense.  He gave the 
current U.S. thinking that about eight years would be needed 
to develop a civilian-controlled military capable of securing 
Afghanistan\'s borders and ensuring government control of all 
the territory within those borders.  He stated that the most 
immediate challenge is funding.  Current estimates hold that 
$1.84 billion is required to establish the envisioned 
70,000-strong ANA and Border Control forces.  Baltazar noted 
that only $50 million is available now, and pledges from 
other countries have not been forthcoming.  Recruiting and 
retention to achieve an ethnically-balanced force and 
ultimately displace the warlord system was noted as an even 
longer term challenge. 
 
17. (SBU) UKUN delegate Glyn Berry said upcoming elections 
could be problematic if, as expected, they result in a 
majority Tajik and fundamentalist government which would be 
difficult for the Pashtun population to accept.  He 
underscored the importance of ensuring ethnic balance in the 
force, and of ANA ability to \"outbid\" competing employers 
(warlords and drug traffickers) for soldiers.  He also raised 
the issue of DDR, noting that viable employment opportunities 
were required for those mujahideen not selected for the ANA 
to keep them from returning to their old ways. 
 
18. (SBU) The U.K.\'s Pollard resumed the discussion, stating 
U.K. willingness to assist by providing niche skills and 
other capabilities not resident in the U.S. plan.  As an 
example, the U.K. will provide an officer to the UN 
Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) to advise Brahimi 
on security sector reform and assist in development of a 
National Security Council to integrate the various aspects of 
reform.  On the issue of funding, he noted that the U.K. had 
set aside 10 million pounds to support ANA salary payments, 
but that release of the funds was conditioned on the size, 
shape and ethnic balance of the ANA, as well as other 
reforms. 
 
------------------------------ 
Future of Complex Peacekeeping 
------------------------------ 
 
19. (U) Major General Cam Ross, Director General of 
International Security Policy for the Canadian Department of 
National Defense, presented Canada\'s view on the issue of 
whether future complex peacekeeping operations would be 
conducted by the UN or multinational coalitions.  General 
Ross contrasted pre- and post-cold war trends of 
peacekeeping, noting the shift from fewer interstate and more 
intrastate conflicts.  He highlighted the UN\'s important and 
unique role in both scenarios and concluded that UN 
peacekeeping would continue to perform a key role in future 
peacekeeping requirements. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CIVPOL - Transition to Local Police Forces 
------------------------------------------ 
 
20. (U) The U.S. noted that along with the exit of UN 
Civilian Police (CIVPOL), there will often be a need for a 
follow-on mechanism to complete improvements initiated by the 
UN.  As an example, the European Union Police Mission (EUPM) 
is on track to assume the IPTF mission in January 2003; a 
similar mechanism will be needed in Timor-Leste after 
UNMISET\'s exit.  CIVPOL only addresses one portion of the 
justice system.  Other parts, such as laws, courts, judges, 
prosecutors, defense lawyers, and jails, will likely need 
continuing development in post-conflict situations. 
Peacekeeping operations are ill-suited to address such 
long-term development tasks. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Role of the UNSC Working Group/Consultations with TCCs 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
21. (U) Participants noted that a positive and effective 
relationship between Troop Contributing Countries (TCCs), the 
Secretariat and the Security Council is a worthwhile 
 
SIPDIS 
objective and agreed to continue working toward improvements. 
 
---------- 
Conclusion 
---------- 
 
22. (U) In closing, Canada suggested the possibility of 
expanding the trilateral forum to include other countries. 
Australia was specifically mentioned as a potential prospect. 
 Participants agreed to consider the proposal and discuss 
this further at a later date.  Delegates from respective 
missions to the UN were encouraged to conduct a \"trial\" of 
this concept in New York.  The U.S. announced its intention 
to host the talks in early December 2003 and said a proposed 
agenda would be on the table for review by mid-October 2003.

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum is looking 
forward to discussing Iraq, missile defense, and NATO 
post-Prague in your January 9 meeting.  Canada has told us it 
would participate militarily in a UN-blessed operation 
against Iraq, but is reserving judgement on participation if 
there is no explicit Security Council authorization.  We 
believe that Canada would, in the end, take part in a 
coalition campaign even if the Security Council is divided. 
On missile defense, Canada finally realizes that the train is 
leaving the station and that it needs to get on board; 
discussions with U.S. experts are scheduled for January 28. 
At NATO, Canada supports your Response Force proposal but has 
been one of the worst offenders for inadequate resources. 
Given Prime Minister Chretien\'s ambitious domestic agenda for 
his 2003-2004 budget, which will be announced in February, 
McCallum needs a strong message from you on defense spending 
to take back to Ottawa. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Since his appointment in May 2002, Minister McCallum 
has had a positive impact on U.S.-Canada defense relations. 
While he has not gotten the substantial increase in defense 
spending that most Canadians (outside the Prime Minister\'s 
office) believe is needed, he has made progress in expanding 
defense cooperation.  In response to the increased terrorist 
threat to North America, he pushed succesfully for an 
agreement, signed in December 2002, on a binational military 
planning group at NORAD headquarters (ref. A).  He also was 
able to shift the debate in Ottawa on missile defense, 
convincing a skeptical Foreign Minister Graham that Canada 
should accelerate discussions with us on possible 
participation (ref. B).  In addition to having a good 
relationship with Graham, McCallum carries more weight in 
Cabinet than did his predecessor Art Eggleton. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
3. (C) As indicated in a December 16 meeting with Under 
Secretary of State Grossman (ref. C), Canada shares our 
 
SIPDIS 
concerns about the Iraqi WMD threat, and strongly supports 
our efforts to work through the UN to disarm Saddam.  But the 
GoC wants to avoid being seen as pre-judging the UN process 
or backing the U.S. just for the sake of the bilateral 
relationship.  Canada\'s response to our request for a 
contribution to a potential military coalition had four main 
components: 
 
-- Canada remains committed to the UN process, and prefers 
that Iraq be disarmed peacefully; 
 
-- should Iraq fail to meet its obligations, and the UNSC 
explicitly authorize the use of force, Canada will 
participate militarily; 
 
-- should the UN process fail and no explicit authorization 
of force is given, Canada will decide at that time whether to 
participate militarily; and 
 
-- Canada will proceed with military-to-military 
consultations with the U.S. on potential coalition 
contributions (Canadian military planners have since arrived 
at CENTCOM and are engaged in discussions with U.S. 
counterparts). 
 
4. (C) To the extent that we stay the course on the UN 
process and can keep other allies onside, we make the 
decision on military participation easier for the GoC to sell 
domestically.  The inspectors\' report and any other evidence 
that we can share on Iraq\'s WMD program will be key.  As for 
what Canada might bring to the table, our expectations should 
be modest.  Canada probably would need to use assets 
currently devoted to Operation Enduring Freedom, including a 
Naval Task Group and patrol and transport aircraft. 
 
--------------- 
MISSILE DEFENSE 
--------------- 
 
5. (C) During an October meeting with NORTHCOM Commander GEN 
Eberhart, McCallum told us that Canada would be seeking a 
high-level meeting with the U.S. to discuss Canada\'s 
potential participation in the missile defense program.  This 
was a welcome departure from the wait-and-see approach the 
GoC had exhibited before, and reflected Canada\'s realization 
that it is better off exploring the costs/benefits and making 
a participation decision sooner rather than later, even if 
such a decision will be controversial domestically.  The 
missile defense consultations are now scheduled for January 
28 in Washington.  Following this meeting, McCallum and 
Foreign Minister Graham plan to brief Cabinet and seek tacit 
approval for pursuing the discussions further.  One of the 
key questions for Canada will be how the missile defense 
architecture meshes with NORAD and NORTHCOM. 
 
6. (C) While the GoC is moving in the right direction, and 
does not want to be left behind other allies, there is still 
work to be done here on the policy side.  After the 
President\'s December announcement on missile defense 
deployment, Foreign Minister Graham reiterated Canadian 
concerns about weaponization of space.  DFAIT contacts told 
us that there was no change in GoC interest in missile 
defense cooperation, but Graham\'s statement does reflect 
lingering misgivings in a government that places great 
emphasis on arms control. 
 
-------------- 
NATO/RESOURCES 
-------------- 
 
7. (C) Canada was an early supporter of the robust NATO 
expansion at Prague, and it also endorsed your Response Force 
proposal.  But Canada has been part of the problem when it 
comes to inadequate resources, spending only 1.1% of its GDP 
on defense in 2002.  To put this in perspective, U.S. 
spending on missile defense alone in 2002 was roughly equal 
to Canada\'s total defense budget of US$7.9 billion. 
Ambassador Cellucci has raised the profile of this issue in 
Ottawa by emphasizing the value we place on Canadian Forces 
(CF) contributions around the world and our concerns about 
the CF\'s ability to do so in the future.  By raising defense 
spending with McCallum, you can help him make the case with 
his Cabinet counterparts that this issue is a top priority in 
Washington, as well. 
 
8. (C) McCallum, again, has done a better job than his 
predecessor at making the case for more funding, going so far 
as to publicly say that the gap between military resources 
and commitments is \"unsustainable.\"  He has launched a 
defense policy update to try to back up his arguments for the 
2003-2004 defense budget, but he faces a very tough sell in 
Prime Minister Chretien, who has shortchanged the Canadian 
Forces throughout his 10 years in office.  Given Chretien\'s 
ambitious domestic agenda for his final year in office, we 
are hoping for an increase of a few hundred million for 
defense in 2003-2004.

REF: STATE 578 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S)  Canada shares our concern over Indian export controls 
on WMD/missile programs, and welcomes our dialogue with India 
on entities trying to acquire controlled goods (reftel). 
Marina Laker, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for 
Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and Disarmament, told us that 
Canada regularly raises this issue with the GoI, along with 
the more general problem of India\'s nuclear weapons program. 
She said that Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific David 
Kilgour is currently in India and will raise these issues. 
Laker said that because of its non-proliferation concerns, 
Canadian restrictions on defense exports to India are the 
most stringent of any Western country, and asked about U.S. 
loosening of its own restrictions on military sales to India. 
 
2. (S) Foreign Minister Graham issued a statement on January 
8 urging India not to carry out planned ballistic missile 
tests, and to abide by UNSCR 1172 by ceasing its development 
of nuclear weapons and delivery systems.  Graham also called 
on India to adhere to the International Code of Conduct 
(ICOC) against ballistic missile proliferation.  Laker said 
that Canada has no illusions, however, about how New Delhi 
will proceed, calling \"Indian nonproliferation\" an oxymoron. 
She said that Canada wants to continue to address the issue 
of Indian proliferation at the Nuclear Suppliers Group, as 
well as at the Missile Technology Control Regime points of 
contact meeting in February.

for capacity building in the trade and trade-related area 
listed in reftel. 
 
2.  However, Canada is contributing C$1.5 million (about US$1 
million) to electoral support through Elections Canada and 
the International Foundation for Election Systems.  Mr. 
Jean-Jacques Blais, a former Minister in the GOC, will be in 
Afghanistan next week to review the nature of technical 
assistance. 
 
3.  The GOC has also committing funds to support the 
Constitutional and Judicial Commissions.  This includes C$3.5 
million (about US$2.2 million) to the UN to support 
Afghanistan\'s reform of the judicial system and C$0.5 million 
(about US$0.3 million) to Justice Canada for technical 
assistance to the Afghan government.  The Justice Canada team 
is at the familiarization stage, but is looking into support 
for the two commissions. 
 
4.  Kabul minimize considered.

SUBJECT: CANADA: FIRST NATIONS NATIONAL CHIEF WANTS TO WORK 
WITH U.S. TO IMPLEMENT SMART BORDER 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED. NOT FOR INTERNET OR OTHER PUBLIC 
DISTRIBUTION. 
 
1. (SBU) In a meeting with the Ambassador on December 17, 
National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Matthew Coon 
Come 
-- appealed specifically for U.S. collaboration with First 
Nations law enforcement personnel to enhance border security 
and help dispel negative perceptions that First Nations are a 
weak link along the border; 
--  proposed \"sensitivity training\" on cultural and religious 
traditions of First Nations peoples for U.S. border 
personnel; and 
-- sought USG assistance in encouraging the Government of 
Canada to reciprocate the border crossing rights of First 
Nations people that are codified only in U.S. law. 
 
Working with First Nations law enforcement personnel 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2.(U) Ambassador Cellucci met with National Chief Matthew 
Coon Come at the latter\'s request. A long-time activist for 
aboriginal rights, Coon Come was elected to the top post of 
Canada\'s largest native organization in 2000. Although the 
Assembly of First Nations (AFN) does not represent all of 
Canada\'s government-recognized aboriginal groups, the 
organization has become an increasingly successful advocate 
of aboriginal rights. 
 
3.(SBU) The Ambassador welcomed Chief Coon Come\'s active 
interest in and recommendations for enhancing operations 
along the U.S.-Canada border, particularly in light of the 
special concerns of the 60-odd First Nations communities that 
live along the border. He noted the possibility of 
incorporating First Nations law enforcement teams under the 
new Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) and invited 
Coon Come to share the models for cooperation that were 
developed at a conference on Native American border security 
in January 2002 for further review.  Chief Coon Come said he 
hoped the Embassy and USG would support/promote working with 
the First Nations on such an initiative, as the Canadians had 
been less forthcoming on the matter. 
 
Educating border authorities on religious customs and practice 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
4. (U) Alluding to difficulties involving First Nations\' 
people\'s transport of eagle feathers and related parts into 
the U.S., Chief Coon Come said that there appeared to be a 
general lack of understanding or appreciation for the 
sacredness of eagle feathers and \"sacred pouches,\" which 
still could cause unpleasantness at the border on a case by 
case basis.  The Ambassador agreed that appropriate respect 
for religious practices must be factored into a \"smart\" 
border; it was important for customs and other officials to 
understand and respect the significance of religious 
artifacts.  In this regard, the notion of developing a 
training video was a worthwhile endeavor that we would share 
with law enforcement concerns in Washington. 
 
Canadian reciprocity of First Nations border crossing rights 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
5. (U) Chief Coon Come explained that Article III of the Jay 
Treaty (1794), which addressed border crossing rights of 
First Nations people, took into consideration their 
longstanding seasonal migration patterns and specifically 
provided for their exemption from duties on personal goods 
and effects when crossing the U.S./Canada border.  While 
these provisions were codified into U.S. law even before the 
War of 1812 (which abrogated the Treaty), they never have 
been incorporated into the statutes of Canada.  Thus, First 
Nations people may transport effects for personal and 
community use into the U.S. on a duty-free basis, but 
Canadian authorities tend to impose a duty on similar effects 
entering Canada. 
 
6. (SBU) Ambassador Celluci acknowledged that the difference 
in U.S. and Canadian treatment of First Nations people at the 
border was illogical given our ongoing efforts to harmonize 
operations and observed that such a discrepancy could be 
addressed under the Smart Border action plan.  The Ambassador 
said he would ensure these concerns were considered in 
ongoing border talks with Canada.

questions about how EU command will be embedded in NATO 
command, and about EU access to NATO assets.  That said, 
Canada will be \"more than happy\" if the EU is able to play a 
greater security role in the Balkans.  Helfand said that 
while Canadian Forces might participate in EU-led efforts in 
the Balkans, they are overstretched globally and would 
welcome a smaller commitment in the region. 
 
2. (C) Helfand noted that six Canadian police officers have 
now arrived in Bosnia to serve in the EU Police Mission 
there.  This cooperation is part of the Canada-EU modalities

when planning operations and will invite Canada to 
participate in operations where NATO assets are being used. 
In a NATO-EU exercise later this year, Canada plans to 
participate on both the NATO and EU sides, allowing it to 
test out its new agreement with the EU.

Summary 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Canada\'s economy is like the \"Energizer Bunny\" - 
it just keeps going and going.  Canada should post a 
solid 3.3 percent annual increase in real GDP in 2002, 
which is more than double the 1.5 percent gain recorded 
in 2001.  All components of real GDP contributed to the 
increase with the exception of business investment in 
plant and equipment.  Positive business sentiment and an 
economy moving toward full capacity should reverse the 
trend in plant and equipment investment this year and 
next.  Other contributors to future growth include new 
spending by the government on health, the environment and 
defense - fueled by stronger tax revenues, and a recovery 
in the U.S. resulting in Canadian exports to more than 
double this year and continue to grow in 2004.  More 
balanced increases in investment, plus ongoing gains in 
consumer spending, round out the picture for why Canada\'s 
real economic growth should improve to 3.5 percent in 
2003 -- with the outlook for 2004 now estimated at 4.3 
percent.  End Summary. 
 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
2.   (SBU) Canada\'s economy grew at an annualized rate of 
3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2002, a sharp drop 
from the robust growth of 5.7 and 4.4 percent recorded in 
the first two quarters, respectively.  Exports 
contributed strongly to growth in IIIQ 2002, as did 
business investment in residential construction and in 
capital equipment.  However, growth was dampened by a 
slowdown in consumer spending (primarily in autos) and in 
the pace of inventory accumulation.  Following the 
anticipated 3.3 percent growth in 2002, we expect the 
Canadian economy to grow by 3.5 percent in 2003, and 4.3 
percent in 2004.  Domestic demand should stay strong over 
the forecast period, and solid growth estimates for the 
U.S. economy bode well for Canada\'s external sector.  We 
anticipate a tighter monetary policy beginning in late 
2003 and early 2004 as the Canadian economy reaches full 
capacity, which should slow quarterly growth rates in all 
sectors of the economy in the second half of 2004. 
Canada\'s inflation rate should remain in the upper end of 
the Bank of Canada\'s 1-3 percent target band, and the 
unemployment rate should stay at around 7.6 percent. 
 
 
Assumptions 
----------- 
 
4. (SBU) We assume the following: 
 
-- Real U.S. growth rates of 2.3 percent in 2002, 2.8 
percent in 2003, and 3.4 percert in 2004 (ref A). 
 
-- Real G-7 growth rates of 2.2 percent this year and 2.7 
percent next year (ref A). 
 
-- No major shocks in the oil and gas sector.  We assume 
that a `war premium\' has already been built in. 
 
-- The GOC will introduce a stimulative budget in 
February 2003, implementing many of the recommendations 
of the November, 2002 Romanow Report on reforming 
Canada\'s health care system, providing incentives to meet 
the targets of the Kyoto Accord, and replacing outdated 
military equipment. 
-- The GOC will uphold its promises to the Canadian oil 
and gas sector made in exchange for their grudging 
support for Kyoto Accord ratification. 
 
-- Ontario, Canada\'s largest province demographically, 
will maintain its cap on residential electricity prices. 
(After the cap on electricity prices was lifted, 
residential electricity bills soared by 50 percent and 
more.  Ontario\'s Premier quickly reinstated the price cap 
late last year, and Ontarians have received C$75 per 
household rebate checks, which we assume were spent in 
December 2002 and are included in our IVQ 2002 forecast.) 
 
Risks 
----- 
 
5. (SBU) Risks to the forecast include: 
 
-- Sluggish growth in the U.S. economy (with special 
concern about flat employment growth); 
 
-- A longer-than-anticipated war with Iraq. 
 
 
 
Domestic Demand: Full Steam Ahead! 
----------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) We forecast annualized quarterly growth rates 
between 2.8 and 4 percent in both private consumption and 
government spending over most of the forecast period. 
Domestic demand will be fuelled by the record 560,000 net 
new jobs in 2002.  Corporate profits and business 
investment intentions suggest aggregate employment should 
continue to grow this year and next (albeit not at the 
same rate as in 2002).  This translates into sizeable 
increases in consumer spending and a hefty boost for 
government tax revenues.  Business investment in non- 
residential construction and machinery/equipment is 
forecast to rise, while investment in residential 
construction should moderate after rising by over 15 
percent in 2002, the highest annual growth rate in 15 
years.  Pent-up demand and high vacancy rates accounted 
for the steep increase in residential construction in 
2002. 
 
New Spending On Health, Environment, Military Equipment 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7. (SBU) In FY2001-2002, Canada\'s net federal debt was 
C$536.5 billion, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of just over 49 
percent (down from almost 71 percent six years earlier). 
The debt reduction saves the GOC C$3 billion annually in 
interest payments, and provides increased fiscal 
flexibility.  In addition, strong employment growth 
points to larger-than-expected surpluses.  The Conference 
Board of Canada predicts possible GOC fiscal surpluses of 
almost C$20 billion in FY2002-2003 and FY2003-04, almost 
double the C$11 billion that Finance Minister Manley 
predicted in his fiscal update in October (ref B). 
However, we expect the GOC to respond to political 
pressure to spend part of the surplus on health care, the 
environment, and military equipment, with the remainder 
dedicated to further debt reduction, producing a balanced 
budget for FY2003-2004.  Manley has made it quite clear 
that the GOC will cut spending rather than risk a budget 
deficit. 
 
8. (SBU) Incremental spending increases introduced in 
FY2000 (on health care, defense spending, infrastructure, 
innovation, the environment, cities and aboriginal 
affairs) will continue this fiscal year and next. 
However, increased spending on health care and the 
environment seem likely in the upcoming federal budget. 
The GOC-commissioned Romanow Report recommends a C$15 
billion increase in health care spending over the next 
three fiscal years (in increments of C$3.5 billion, C$5 
billion, and C$6.5 billion).  Costs of ratification and 
implementation of the Kyoto Accord are unclear, but the 
GOC, to placate Canada\'s oil and gas sector,  has 
promised that the sector\'s contribution to meeting 
emission targets in the first commitment period of the 
Accord will be limited to C$15 per tonne. 
 
And Don\'t Rule Out The External Sector! 
--------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Canada\'s global merchandise trade surplus 
dropped by an estimated C$10 billion in 2002, to C$54 
billion (US$34.4 billion) from the previous year, as 
demand softened from Canada\'s major trading partners, in 
particular, the United States.  This resulted in a S$9.6B 
(US$6.1B) drop in Canada\'s global current account 
balance.  However, given U.S. and G-7 growth projections 
for the forecast period, Canadian exports should grow at 
a respectable rate, outpacing increases in investment- 
related imports.  In particular, energy exports should 
remain strong and so should exports of consumer durables 
and office machinery and equipment.  We forecast that 
Canada\'s global merchandise trade surplus will rise only 
slightly in 2003, to C$54.5B (US$34.7B), before climbing 
to C$66.9B (US$42.6B) in 2004.  The improvement is in 
line with the ongoing strength in the global and U.S. 
economies. 
 
Inflation 
--------- 
 
10. (SBU)  Canada\'s inflation rate, as measured by the 
year-over-year percent change in the All-Items Consumer 
Price Index, jumped to 4.3 percent in November 2002. 
However, Statistics Canada attributes the large increase 
to a sharp decline in the base used for comparison.  For 
example, the All-Items CPI fell by an unusually steep 
monthly 0.9 percent between October and November 2001, 
so without a similar drop in the index in 2002, the year- 
over-year percent change is exaggerated.  (Note: The 
monthly decline in November 2001 was attributed to a 
steep drop in energy prices and traveler accommodation. 
The same factors caused the All-Items CPI to drop by 0.5 
percent in October 2001 from the previous month.)  We 
expect Canada\'s inflation rate to remain at the upper 
end of the Bank of Canada\'s 1-3 percent target band. 
However, there is a risk of higher inflation in the 
second half of 2003 as the Canadian economy reaches full 
capacity. 
 
Monetary Policy 
--------------- 
 
11. (SBU) The Bank of Canada (BOC) is still looking for 
an opportunity to take back some of the low-interest 
stimulus that it pumped into the Canadian economy last 
year.  While the BOC continues a \"made in Canada\" 
monetary policy, i.e., not following the Fed in lockstep, 
we believe that monetary policy will tighten later this 
year once the Canadian economy reaches full capacity.  We 
expect the spread between U.S. and Canadian short-term 
interest rates to remain at roughly 175 basis points in 
favor of Canada.  While we do not forecast exchange 
rates, we believe the Canadian dollar will continue 
trading in the upper-63 cents range vis--vis the U.S. 
dollar.  Any appreciation linked to tighter monetary 
policy will be erased as the Fed increases U.S. interest 
rates.  While the weaker dollar is a boon for Canadian 
exporters, it makes investment-related imports and 
consumer durables much more expensive.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN POSITION ON IRAQ UNCHANGED 
 
REF: (A) OTTAWA 49 (B) 02 OTTAWA 3502 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Despite Prime Minister Chretien\'s January 15 comment 
that \"the international community must speak and act through 
the UN Security Council,\" Canada\'s position on military 
participation in a potential war against Iraq is unchanged. 
Contacts at Foreign Affairs and National Defense assured us 
on January 16 that the Canadian response to our request for a 
military contribution (given to the State Department in 
December - reftels) remains the same: Canada will participate 
militarily if there is a UN-sanctioned campaign, and reserves 
judgement on participation if there is no explicit UNSC 
authorization. 
 
2. (C) Defense Minister McCallum made this position - 
including the possibility that Canada would participate in a 
campaign not endorsed by the UN - very clear in a press 
conference following his January 9 meeting with Secretary 
Rumsfeld, to the consternation of the left wing of the ruling 
Liberal Party.  Several backbench Liberal MPs complained 
afterward that Canada should only support military action 
blessed by the UNSC, and some called for debate in Parliament 
on the Canadian position.  The Prime Minister, who never 
likes to commit himself earlier than necessary on 
controversial issues, was not pleased.  He told the press 
that McCallum \"replied to a hypothetical question that he has 
reflected upon and corrected since that time.\"  Chretien 
reaffirmed McCallum\'s statement that Canada would participate 
in a UNSC-blessed operation, but refused to speculate on 
whether Canada would join a campaign not endorsed by the UN. 
 
3. (C) McCallum, a professional economist who became Defense 
Minister in May 2002 and was first elected to Parliament in 
2000, is still learning the ropes of Cabinet politics, 
including the finer points of obfuscating before the media. 
He violated one of Chretien\'s basic rules - not to infringe 
upon the Prime Minister\'s room for maneuver - and was put 
down for his efforts.  We continue to believe that Canada 
would join a coalition of the willing in a campaign against 
Iraq, even if the Security Council were divided, but that 
Chretien would prefer to avoid having to make that 
politically tough decision.

SUBJECT: WEST NILE VIRUS: ONTARIO DOCTORS MUST REPORT 
 
 
1. Ontario is expected to make it mandatory soon to 
report human cases of West Nile Virus to the provincial 
Public Health Officer. \"Reportable diseases\" are listed 
in regulations made under the statutory authority of 
the province\'s Health Protection and Promotion Act. 
This will make Ontario the first jurisdiction in Canada 
to have such a mandatory reporting requirement for West 
Nile Virus. According to Ontario health officials, of 
the States adjacent to, or adjoining Ontario; i.e., New 
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan - currently only 
New York has specific mandatory reporting requirements 
for human incidents of West Nile infection. 
 
2. Reporting by physicians to their local Public Health 
Board is mandated by provincial legislation or 
regulation, rather than by federal law. As a 
consequence the list of diseases that are reportable 
can vary slightly from province to province. 
 
3. We anticipate that Quebec is the only province 
likely to follow Ontario\'s lead in making WNV a 
\"reportable\" disease before the 2003 Mosquito season 
arrives. According to Health Canada figures, in 2002 
the two provinces with the highest incidence of West 
Nile Virus infection in humans were Ontario (with 76 
confirmed cases) and Quebec (with only 7 confirmed 
cases). In each province one death was confirmed due to 
West Nile Virus in 2002.  The third highest incidence 
of human West Nile Virus infection was noted in the 
province of Alberta with one case - and authorities 
there have concluded that this individual likely 
acquired the infection outside of Alberta. 
 
4. Ontario\'s chief public health official, Dr. Colin 
D\'Cunha noted that a significant concern that has 
driven the province to make WNV reportable is the fact 
that WNV is transmissible via donated blood.  As well, 
D\'Cunha said that knowledge of how many people in a 
particular community are showing symptoms of WNV would 
aid decision-makers when they consider measures, such 
as spraying insecticide, to reduce the mosquito 
population. 
 
5. The Canadian federal list of reportable/notifiable 
diseases does not currently include West Nile Virus, 
although the federal government does collect data from 
the provinces. Indeed, in Canada reporting by the 
provinces of reportable diseases (also referred to as 
notifiable diseases) to the Federal Government\'s Centre 
for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control is 
voluntary. A consensus of federal and provincial health 
officials\' opinion sets the list and as noted in 
paragraph 2, provincial authorities make the necessary 
change to their laws and regulations to mandate 
physician reporting to provincial authorities. Although 
there is currently no statutory authority at the 
federal level to make disease reporting by physicians 
mandatory to federal authorities, Health Canada 
officials told us that legislation is being drafted 
that would have this effect. Post will monitor 
developments.

SUBJECT: CANADA: ARF STATEMENT SHOULD REFLECT CONSENSUS 
 
REF: STATE 13788 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor, Brian Flora. Reason 1.5b. 
 
 
1. (C)  Post provided Canada\'s Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT) Deputy Director for Regional 
Security and Peacekeeping Division, Sarah Smith and Deputy 
Director for Korea, Hartmuth Kroll, talking points and texts 
of the proposed statement by the Chairman of the ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF), the Chairman\'s letter to ARF member 
states, and the proposed U.S. alternative language as 
contained in REFTEL on January 16.  Smith told poloff that 
Canada had already received copies of the ARF Chairman\'s 
letter and proposed statement and Canada\'s Ambassador to 
Cambodia would be engaging the ARF chairman concerning the 
Government of Canada\'s thoughts on the draft statement.  She 
noted that her government was in the process of preparing 
alternative language and though not able to share it with the 
U.S. at that time, would do so as soon as it was fully vetted 
through her government. 
 
2.  (C)  On January 17, Smith and Kroll provided poloff the 
following suggested amendments to the ARF Chairman\'s 
statement: 
 
quote: 
Proposed Amendments by Canada 
para 1. (no change)  The ASEAN Regional Forum, the only 
regional political and security forum in the Asia-Pacific, 
remains deeply concerned over the negative impact on the 
situation on the Korean Peninsula of recent actions by the 
DPRK with respect to its nuclear program which negatively 
affect pace, stability and security in the region and the 
integrity of the international non-proliferation regime. 
Further development of this program could also undermine the 
confidence and security-building measures being undertaken by 
the ARF. 
 
para 2. ARF participating states are seriously concerned by 
the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea\'s non-compliance 
with international non-proliferation norms, and in particular 
its announcement of its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and to terminate its safeguards cooperation with the 
IAEA. 
 
(Our preferred option is to delete para 3. Otherwise , we 
would redraft as follows) 
 
para 3.  The ARF takes note of the 1994 Framework Agreement 
between the DPRK and the USA, which recognizes the obligation 
to observe international non-proliferation commitments. 
 
para 4.  All ARF participating states support a nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula.  Adherence to norms of international 
non-proliferation and the exercise of self-restraint by all 
parties at his juncture are critical to the maintenance of 
peace and security on the Korean peninsula. 
 
para 5.  The ARF believes that there is a basis for a 
diplomatic resolution which could contribute to the reduction 
of tensions on the Korean peninsula and to the settlement of 
the fundamental issues.   We welcome recent proposals which 
have been forthcoming in this regard and encourage the DPRK 
to respond positively. 
 
para 6.  In this light, the ARF call on the DPRK to resume 
its cooperation with the IAEA and to reverse its decision to 
withdraw from the NPT.  At the same time, it urges all 
parties concerned to engage in dialogue and consultation to 
address and settle the concerns of all in order to bring 
about a peaceful, secure and nuclear-free Korean peninsula. 
end quote 
 
3. (C)  After presenting Canadian\'s suggested changes, Kroll 
said his government believes the ARF Chairman would be more 
likely to acccept suggested edits to his original proposed 
statement rather than a complete redraft such as the U.S. 
proposal (reftel).  He stressed, however, that the ARF 
Chairman be made to understand the importance of consistent 
messaging on this sensitive issue and that it is critical 
that ARF members not break ranks or issue inconsistent 
signals that the DPRK could exploit.  He added that Canada is 
not, repeat not, in favor of any language that would frame 
the current developments on the Korean peninsula as a 
bi-lateral problem. Both Kroll and Smith stressed that 
regardless of the eventual language used, the ASEAN member 
states must reach consensus, and if that takes time -- so be 
it.

SUBJECT: CRTC DECISION MEANS NO RETRANSMISSION OF TV SIGNALS 
VIA THE INTERNET IN CANADA 
 
REFS:  (A) OTTAWA 3602 and Previous 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.   (SBU)  The Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) concluded in a January 
17, 2003 report that there is no need to amend its current 
New Media Exemption Order.  This decision upholds the intent 
of Bill C-11, passed in December 2002 (Reftel), making it 
illegal to put broadcast TV signals onto the Internet 
without permission.  The decision is a victory for U.S. and 
Canadian broadcasters who have worked for more than three 
years to outlaw non-consensual Internet retransmission in 
Canada.  The complete text of the CRTC decision is available 
on the web at: 
www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/2003/pb200 3-2.htm. 
 
2.   Bill C-11, which amended Canada\'s compulsory licensing 
regime specifically to disallow the retransmission of 
television signals over the Internet, was tied to the CRTC\'s 
New Media Exemption Order.  During the debate on Bill C-11, 
the CRTC was ordered to review the Exemption Order. 
Internet retransmissions would have been eligible for the 
benefits of the compulsory license in the Copyright Act if 
the CRTC had decided either to license them as broadcasters 
or to create a new exemption order specifically for them. 
The CRTC chose to do neither. 
 
3.   Canadian legal experts told Econoff that the CRTC 
decision, combined with the contents of C-11, provides an 
absolute exclusion of Internet retransmitters from the 
Canadian compulsory license for the foreseeable future. 
Bill C-11, which was proclaimed into law in December but is 
not yet in force, is expected to enter into force as law 
next month. 
 
4.   In a separate but related development, Aliant, a 
Maritime phone consortium, filed an application with the 
CRTC for an experimental license to continue its Internet 
retransmission service.  Aliant\'s filing was made before the 
CRTC handed down its recent decision so it is expected that 
the CRTC will deny the application and Aliant\'s subscriber 
service, \"TV-On-My-PC\", will have to cease operations. 
However, we will continue to follow the issue and report any 
findings that would be of concern to U.S. interests.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/23/2013 
TAGS: PREL, MARR, ETRD, PTER, CVIS, CA, IZ, KN, VE, Bill Graham 
SUBJECT: YOUR JANUARY 30 MEETING WITH CANADIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER GRAHAM 
 
REF: (A) 02 STATE 234708 (B) 02 STATE 234719 (C) 
     OTTAWA 178 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Your January 30 meeting with Foreign Minister Bill 
Graham will be an important opportunity to bolster Canadian 
support for our Iraq policy.  The Canadian Government\'s 
natural preference is for giving the inspectors more time and 
for the UN Security Council to reach consensus, but it wants 
to stand with the U.S. in the end.  Like in other countries, 
public skepticism is growing here over military action 
against Iraq.  Graham needs to hear the same message that 
President Bush gave the UNGA on September 12, that this is a 
test of the UN\'s ability to impose its will and to respond 
effectively to a crisis.  In addition to Iraq, Graham will 
want to discuss North Korea, Latin America, missile defense, 
softwood lumber trade, and entry/exit controls at border. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
---- 
IRAQ 
---- 
 
2. (C) While Canada\'s position on Iraq has not changed since 
your November 14 Ottawa meeting with Graham (refs. A and B), 
divisions among allies on the Security Council and within 
Canada\'s Liberal Party have increased pressure on the 
Chretien Government.  The Canadian position remains that it 
will participate in a UN-blessed operation against Iraq, and 
that it is reserving judgement on participation if there is 
no explicit Security Council approval.  Canadian military 
planners have been in Tampa since early January, consulting 
with CENTCOM planners about a possible Canadian contribution. 
 Publicly, Chretien does not want to admit the possibility 
that Canada might participate without UN blessing, and he 
reined in Defense Minister McCallum for doing so after 
McCallum\'s January 9 meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld 
(ref. C). 
 
3. (C) Claude Laverdure, the Prime Minister\'s Foreign Policy 
Advisor, told the DCM on January 17 that Canada could indeed 
support military action in Iraq absent a second UNSC 
resolution, especially in a case where 11 or 12 Security 
Council members think there has been a material breach but 
China or another country vetoes a resolution.  Laverdure said 
there should be an \"international consensus,\" but not 
necessarily UN action.  Chretien and Graham both told the 
press on January 23 that there is not yet justification for a 
war on Iraq, and that the inspectors need to keep up the 
pressure. 
 
----------- 
NORTH KOREA 
----------- 
 
4. (C) Graham has been a vocal critic of North Korea since 
the October announcement on its nuclear weapons program. 
Canada pushed hard for a G-8 statement during its Presidency, 
and called for the International Atomic Energy Agency to 
refer North Korea\'s actions to the UN Security Council. 
Canada established diplomatic relations with North Korea in 
2001, and North Korean diplomats have been searching for an 
Embassy location in Ottawa.  Canada is continuing 
humanitarian assistance to North Korea, but otherwise the 
bilateral relationship is on hold. 
 
------------- 
LATIN AMERICA 
------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Graham will brief you on his January 20-21 trip to 
Brasilia, where he met with Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and 
other newly appointed members of the Brazilian government. 
He will also want to discuss the situations in Venezuela, 
Colombia and Haiti.   Canada supports the mediation efforts 
of OAS Secretary General Gaviria in Venezuela, and has called 
for an end to political violence in all three countries. 
 
--------------- 
MISSILE DEFENSE 
--------------- 
 
6. (C) Canadian officials from Foreign Affairs and Defense 
will be taking part in missile defense consultations with 
U.S. counterparts on January 28.  Graham and McCallum plan to 
brief Cabinet following these consultations, and come to a 
decision sooner rather than later on Canadaian participation. 
 While missile defense remains a controversial issue in 
Canada becaue of arms control concerns, the GoC realizes that 
the train is leaving the station and that other allies are 
getting on board.  Graham may also note that our new 
binational Planning Group is up and running at NORAD, and 
that this will help us coordinate our military response to 
terrorist threats to North America. 
 
--------------- 
SOFTWOOD LUMBER 
--------------- 
 
7. (SBU) Under U.S. trade law, the Department of Commerce can 
determine that the circumstances leading to a U.S. industry 
request for countervailing duties have materially changed. 
Having made that determination through a \"changed 
circumstances\" review, Commerce can reduce or eliminate the 
duties in question without further formal action by the 
affected U.S. industry.  Except for British Columbia, 
lumber-producing provinces have been agnostic about current 
efforts to encourage changes in provincial lumber policies 
through this review process.  Commerce has set February 14 as 
the deadline for publication of the draft policy bulletin 
that will be the basis on which provinces may apply for 
changed circumstances reviews.  The draft will reflect input 
from GOC and provincial officials as well as Canadian and 
U.S. industry organizations, and will be open to further 
revision during the 30-day comment period ending in 
mid-March. 
 
8. (SBU) The changed circumstances review has been useful in 
encouraging all the provinces to look for market-oriented 
policies that are consistent with their own needs and 
forestry management objectives.  But the review is only a 
small step forward, even if BC manages to take full advantage 
of it.  At some point we will need to get back to the 
negotiating table.  The U.S. Government has made it clear to 
U.S. industry that we are not interested in border measures 
(export taxes or quotas) unless they are temporary and are a 
transition to an already negotiated end point.  You may wish 
to stress this point with Minister Graham if he raises the 
issue. 
 
------- 
BIOTECH 
------- 
 
9. (C) The European Union,s refusal even to accept 
applications for new biotech food products is an outrageous 
breach of WTO rules, sound science, good governance and 
common sense.  There is good reason for the United States to 
take the matter to a WTO dispute panel. If we do, USTR 
Zoellick has a commitment from Canadian Trade Minister Pierre 
Pettigrew for Canada to join the United States as a 
co-complainant.  Graham is generally supportive of Canada,s 
being a co-complainant, but it would be useful to reiterate 
to him our strong interest in partnering with Canada on this 
issue. 
 
------ 
BORDER 
------ 
 
10. (SBU) Graham may raise the National Security Entry/Exit 
Registration System (NSEERS), which you discussed in your 
November meeting.  NSEERS requires fingerprinting and 
registration of certain naturalized Canadian citizens and 
landed immigrants seeking admission at U.S. ports of entry. 
U.S. law still requires that nationals (including dual 
nationals) from an expanding list of \"criteria\" countries be 
registered, but the earlier public controversy over 
registration based solely on country of birth has dwindled. 
What may now be worrying Graham, as it does Deputy Prime 
Minister Manley, is implementation - by 2005 - of a new 
entry-exit tracking system for all visitors to the U.S., 
which may include Canadians.  Ottawa fears that the 
entry-exit system will create huge delays at border 
crossings, and continues to seek some sort of exemption or 
expedited measures for Canadians.

1. (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE 
TREAT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
2. (U) Reftel reported Brussels perspectives on plans for an 
EU-Canada \"Trade and Investment Enhancement Agreement,\" 
which were announced at the December 19 2002 EU-Canada 
Summit in Ottawa.  Embassy Ottawa ECON staff visited 
counterparts at the Delegation of the European Commission in 
Ottawa on January 28 to obtain their views of this 
announcement. 
 
3. (SBU) EC Delegation staff confirmed reftel\'s perception 
that the EU is not enthusiastic about this initiative, and 
they were forthcoming in explaining their position.  They 
emphasized that their top concern is to avoid diverting 
resources from the Doha round of multilateral trade 
negotiations.  Another important concern is not to send any 
signal to WTO members which might be misunderstood as 
implying that the EU lacks confidence that the Doha Round 
will reach a successful conclusion and deliver desired 
results, particularly on market access. 
 
4. (SBU) Following is a summary of key points made by 
Delegation staff: 
 
-- (SBU) GOC representatives have been very persistent in 
pushing for a Canada-EU free trade agreement.  This 
continues a lengthy GOC history of (sporadic and 
unsuccessful) efforts to diversify Canada\'s economic 
relations away from the United States (which now receives 
over 85 percent of Canada\'s merchandise exports). 
 
-- (SBU) Over the past year, GOC demands for an FTA with the 
EU gained urgency, presumably due to outgoing Prime Minister 
Jean Chretien\'s well-known desire to leave a policy 
\"legacy.\" 
 
-- (SBU) The European Commission did not see an 
economic/commercial case for a full-fledged FTA, and did not 
want to risk detracting from multilateral negotiations.  GOC 
trade policy experts (including International Trade Minister 
Pierre Pettigrew) sympathized with this position, but other 
factions in the GOC pushed very hard for FTA negotiations. 
 
-- (SBU) There was some difference of opinion regarding the 
value of a FTA among EU member states, and especially among 
a few resident missions who have been lobbied by the GOC. 
The EU Trade Policy Body, however, remained unified in their 
position against a FTA. 
 
-- (SBU) If immediate FTA negotiations were not attainable, 
the GOC wanted an announcement prior to Chretien\'s 
retirement that Canada and the EU would negotiate an FTA 
following the conclusion of the Doha Round.  The EU also 
said no to this option, not only on the grounds cited above, 
but also because it was considered a mistake to \"stockpile\" 
trade policy commitments for the post-Doha era. 
 
-- (SBU) On the eve of the December 19 bilateral summit, 
Minister Pettigrew and EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy 
(who the EC delegation describe as having a superb 
relationship) struck a compromise:  negotiations will begin 
as soon as possible (probably in 2004), but will not aim for 
an FTA - rather, for a \"Trade and Investment Enhancement 
Agreement.\" 
 
-- (SBU) The FTA-TIEA distinction is meaningful, indicating 
that TIEA negotiations will not/not address \"core trade 
issues\" on the table in Geneva - specifically, it will not 
address market access for either agricultural or non- 
agricultural goods.  Areas which a TIEA could address 
include trade and environment issues, government procurement 
(in which the EU seeks better access to Canadian markets at 
all levels), and regulatory cooperation.  There are likely 
to be parallels with recent EU-US liberalization efforts. 
 
-- (SBU) The GOC has already conducted a tariff study and a 
telephone business survey; the EU has done a more extensive 
business survey. 
 
-- (SBU) The likely timeline is for the trade ministers to 
present leaders with an \"architecture\" for the TIEA at the 
December 2003 summit, with leaders then mandating 
negotiations to begin in 2004.

       CANADA\'S OIL AND GAS PIPELINE NETWORK 
 
SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
-------------------- 
 
1. (U) This message is sensitive, but unclassified.  Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
2. (U) This message was prepared with assistance from 
Amconsul Calgary. 
 
3. (U) Critical infrastructure protection is among the areas 
listed for bilateral action in the Ridge-Manley Smart Border 
plan.  Canada is the United States\' largest foreign supplier 
of energy, supplying over 15 percent of U.S. natural gas 
consumption and about 10 percent of U.S. consumption of oil 
and oil products.  After two decades of strong expansion, 
Canada\'s energy pipeline industry expects to see on the 
order of US$6 billion in additional new facilities 
constructed in the coming decade. 
 
4. (U) This industry appears very well prepared to respond 
to accidents/attacks at its facilities.  Time frames for 
pipeline firms\' \"patch and repair\" operations are from a few 
hours to a few days.  The built-in redundancy of pipeline 
systems (multiple pipes, storage facilities, interconnects, 
back-up compressors) mean that actual disruptions of supply 
(at least beyond the local level or for short periods) are 
considered unlikely. 
 
5. (SBU) While the incidence of accidental events has been 
reduced to a very low level, pipeline industry security 
experts are less confident of their ability to anticipate or 
prevent deliberate attacks.  It is in this area that they 
are most receptive to government support - and most 
interested in clear, timely information flow.  Given their 
degree of professional competence and accountability, and 
since they provide information \"up\" to government whenever 
asked, they want to share more fully in the flow of 
information \"down\" from federal level security agencies. 
One provincial government security official said it has been 
a \"major achievement\" to get the RCMP (federal police) to 
allow even the unclassified versions of threat assessments 
to be distributed to selected private sector players.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE 
------------------ 
 
6. (U) Most of Canada\'s oil and gas pipeline network 
originates in the province of Alberta (with fingers into 
British Columbia, Saskatchewan and the Northwest 
Territories) and transports products southward and/or 
eastward to the United States and central/eastern Canada. 
The industry is collectively represented by the Canadian 
Energy Pipeline Association (cepa.com), based in Calgary. 
Mission economic staff interviewed industry and government 
representatives on critical infrastructure protection issues 
in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton during January 2003. 
 
7. (U) The following two firms respectively claim to operate 
the world\'s longest natural gas and oil pipeline systems. 
 
TRANSCANADA PIPELINES LIMITED (transcanada.com) operates the 
largest portion of the natural gas system.  From southern 
Alberta it exports gas to the Pacific Gas Transmission 
Company, the Montana Power Company, and the Alliance 
Pipeline (which runs southeast through Iowa and Illinois). 
Its \"Canadian mainline\" (actually a group of parallel lines) 
carries gas eastward across Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the 
Winnipeg area, where the line splits into a U.S. portion 
(continuing across Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan) and a 
Canadian portion (continuing across Ontario to Montreal, 
Toronto and other urban areas). 
 
ENBRIDGE PIPELINES INC. (enbridge.com) operates key oil and 
oil products pipelines.  Its main crude oil line runs from 
Edmonton (mid-Alberta) southeastward to Wisconsin, where the 
line divides to pass both north and south of Lake Michigan. 
This system serves key oil storage and 
refinery/petrochemicals complexes in Edmonton, Sarnia 
(Ontario) and Montreal (Quebec) as well as in the United 
States. 
 
PAST INCIDENTS WERE ACCIDENTAL 
------------------------------ 
 
8. (U) Emergency planning necessarily makes heavy use of the 
analysis of past incidents.  However, in Canada\'s pipeline 
industry, past incidents have been due to material failures 
- notably stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in pipe walls and 
disintegration of blades in compressor turbines.  The 
frequency of these problems has been systematically reduced 
through innovation, inspection and maintenance but they 
still occur, and there are older facilities in use which may 
be at higher risk.  On the positive side, these older 
facilities represent part of the built-in redundancy which 
the system uses to continue service when a failure occurs. 
 
PIPELINE FIRMS LEAD ON-THE-GROUND RESPONSE 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9. (SBU) Most pipeline facilities are buried, and the force 
of an explosion/rupture tends to go upward, so damage seldom 
extends to neighboring pipes.  Automatic \"block valves\" 
immediately shut off flow through the ruptured segment(s). 
Neighboring facilities are also shut off until they can be 
inspected (operating them at very low pressure is also an 
option). 
 
10. (SBU) Pipeline firms say they maintain close 
relationships with landowners, municipalities, and volunteer 
fire departments along their routes in order to enhance both 
monitoring of the pipeline, and emergency response.  Company 
employees help to train local firefighters, and these two 
groups in combination are the \"first responders\" to pipeline 
emergencies. 
 
11. (SBU) Typical time to patch a pipeline rupture is one to 
two days and typical time for restoration of full service is 
three to four days.  Due to system redundancy and storage, 
service to end users is unlikely to be affected in the 
meanwhile.  If necessary, a \"bypass\" around a damaged 
segment can be built in about four days.  If a compressor is 
affected, a temporary replacement can be moved and installed 
in a day or two, though permanent replacement takes much 
longer -- one to two years -- due to long delivery times 
from the manufacturers (GE and Rolls-Royce). 
 
PREVENTION/MITIGATION 
--------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) While a few politically motivated attacks on oil 
and gas facilities have occurred, neither of the major 
pipeline systems has significant experience of being 
deliberately attacked.  Many of their monitoring activities 
- such as \"flying the line\" by helicopter at low altitude 
and \"sniffing\" for leaks - are oriented toward accidental 
events.  With facilities crossing thousands of miles in very 
remote areas, corporate security experts admit that there is 
little they can do to protect all this pipe from deliberate 
sabotage.  Obvious key points (such as compressors, storage 
facilities, and refineries where an attack could be more 
disruptive) fortunately are exceptions which can be 
protected to some degree by conventional security methods. 
 
PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT ROLE:  \"SECURITY TEMPLATES\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
13. (U) The Alberta provincial government requires each of 
311 municipalities to identify a full-time employee as 
Director of Disaster Services.  This employee is empowered 
to declare a state of local emergency, can conscript local 
resources and labor, and is partially protected from 
litigation arising from actions taken during a state of 
emergency. 
 
14. (SBU) Alberta\'s \"Critical Infrastructure Protection 
Plan\" is based in part on methods developed by the American 
Petroleum Institute, and has recently been applied to ten 
key industries, beginning with oil.  Industry and government 
worked together to classify facilities by level of 
\"criticality.\"  Information such as the list of participants 
in this process and the list of facilities determined 
\"critical\" is not made public.  Provincial Disaster Services 
staff visit each of these facilities, collect contact 
information, and make recommendations based on \"security 
templates.\" 
 
15. (SBU) Levels of \"alert\" (none, low, medium, high, 
imminent) are also determined from time to time, based on 
threat assessments received from federal agencies.  The 
\"security template\" applied to each facility depends on that 
facility\'s combination of criticality and threat level, and 
is based on \"best practices.\"  Provincial government 
officials say that their recommendations represent \"minimum 
expectations\" and that operators are driven by insurance 
concerns to meet or exceed these standards. 
 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ROLE:  THREAT ASSESSMENTS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU) Observers and security officials unanimously agree 
that the GOC\'s two-year-old Office of Critical 
Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness 
(OCIPEP) is not as far advanced as Alberta Disaster Services 
in its state of readiness, nor in its close ties to 
industry.  OCIPEP relies on line departments such as Natural 
Resources Canada (NRCan) to liaise with industry.  Mission 
will examine OCIPEP\'s broader role and functions in coming 
months. 
 
17. (SBU) From the perspective of industry and 
local/provincial security officials, the GOC\'s crucial role 
is as the source (or at least the conduit) for intelligence 
information on which \"declarations of alert\" must be based. 
Apart from OCIPEP, key agencies here are the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP - Canada\'s federal police service). 
Our contacts expressed various uncertainties and 
dissatisfactions surrounding such intelligence.  For 
example: 
 
-- What intelligence do RCMP and CSIS want from the private 
sector and the public?  One industry leader complained, \"We 
give the police lots of information and they tell us 
nothing.\"  Potential suppliers of information need to know 
whether or not what they provided in the past was considered 
useful.  (COMMENT:  While our contacts were careful not to 
criticize the GOC, we sensed that they would like to be 
reassured about the effectiveness of federal agencies, i.e. 
whether information reaches analysts and is duly 
incorporated into threat assessments, and whether different 
parts of the GOC are sharing information with each other. 
END COMMENT). 
 
-- How much detail will be disseminated?  Currently, RCMP 
and CSIS prepare both classified and unclassified versions 
of threat assessments; only the latter is shared with 
provincial governments and industry representatives.  Also, 
in their support of intelligence gathering, firms provide 
RCMP and CSIS with commercially sensitive information from 
time to time, and they do not want such information re- 
appearing in their competitors\' offices. 
 
-- How often will threat assessments be issued?  This is 
currently undetermined.  Our contacts opined that they 
should be issued regularly, even if unchanged, in order to 
remind users of their existence. 
 
-- How widely will threat assessments be disseminated?  A 
provincial government security official (who is a former 
RCMP officer) said it was a \"major achievement\" to persuade 
the RCMP to allow even unclassified versions of threat 
assessments to be shared with industry security officials 
(rather than only government agencies). 
 
-- Who bears responsibility for formally declaring states of 
alert?  This raises real issues of legal liability. 
According to our contacts in the Alberta government, the 
Solicitor General of Alberta (the senior provincial law 
enforcement officer) currently holds this responsibility 
(despite having limited access to intelligence information) 
and no office in the GOC will make a commitment to this 
function. 
 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH USG 
---------------------- 
 
18. (SBU) Among our contacts, mentions of dealings with the 
USG on safety/security matters were strongly positive.  The 
U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and 
Department of Transportation (DOT) investigate pipeline 
accidents which occur within the U.S., where both Enbridge 
and TransCanada have many facilities.  In mid-2002 a rupture 
in Minnesota led to NTSB investigators paying an extended 
visit to Enbridge corporate headquarters in Edmonton.  The 
report is still pending, but according to Enbridge the firm 
was commended for their quick response to the incident. 
 
19. (SBU) Industry security officials say they receive 
regular notices from the FBI\'s National Infrastructure 
Protection Center.  One industry association leader told us 
his organization has a \"very valuable relationship with the 
FBI\" and that \"we get better information from the FBI than 
from the RCMP.\"  Our contacts also said they receive useful 
security-related information from the U.S. Department of 
Energy\'s Office of Energy Assurance and also from the 
American Petroleum Institute. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
20. (SBU) The federal Government of Canada\'s Office of 
Critical Infrastructure Protection and Emergency 
Preparedness (OCIPEP) is relatively new and is still 
establishing itself in many areas of its mandate.  While 
Mission staff are developing our relationship with and 
understanding of OCIPEP, we see great value in continuing to 
foster close cooperation with Provincial government 
authorities and private sector entities, such as the major 
pipeline and energy firms, who are now and will likely 
remain the first responders in an emergency.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS SECRETARY POWELL\'S 
IRAQ PRESENTATION \"DISTURBING AND PERSUASIVE\" 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Foreign Minister Bill Graham told the Canadian press 
that Secretary Powell\'s February 5 presentation on Iraq 
\"amounts to a transfer of the burden of proof from the United 
States to Saddam Hussein.\"  Graham went on to say that \"we 
are not at a point where there is a need to use force. 
However, we don\'t have much time left.  If Dr. Blix comes 
back and says that there is no chance that Saddam Hussein is 
going to cooperate with us, the call for more time, I don\'t 
think, will be very convincing.\"  The Secretary\'s speech also 
drew favorable comment in the Canadian press, with most 
commentators saying that the presentation made clear that 
Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction from the 
inspectors. 
 
2. (SBU) While Prime Minister Chretien spent the day striking 
a health care deal with provincial leaders, Graham fielded 
opposition questions in the House of Commons after the 
Secretary\'s speech to the UNSC.  While the official 
 
SIPDIS 
opposition Canadian Alliance Party criticized the government 
for not lining up more strongly with the U.S. and the UK, 
other opposition parties (Bloc Quebecois, New Democratic 
Party) called for Canada to oppose any military action 
against Iraq not specifically endorsed by a new UNSC 
resolution. 
 
3. (C) All opposition parties, including the Progressive 
Conservatives, called for a Commons debate and vote on 
Canada\'s position toward conflict with Iraq.  Ron Hoffman, 
Foreign Affairs\' Director for Defense and Security Relations, 
told us that there is no obligation or tradition in Canada 
for the Government to allow such a vote, and that the ruling 
Liberal Party caucus is too divided on this issue to risk it 
in any case.  Hoffman said that the Secretary\'s presentation 
will help the GoC make its case with the Canadian public, 
which is just as divided as Parliament. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: The Secretary\'s speech did not change the 
minds of our critics on the Canadian political left, but it 
has helped us where it matters most, within Cabinet.  The 
evidence that Iraq is concealing WMD from the inspectors will 
help the GoC make the case that Iraq is in breach of UNSCR 
1441, and that there is justification for \"serious 
consequences\" even if a second resolution is not obtained. 
Graham continues to emphasize the UN process, but he has 
distanced himself from the French and German position on 
inspections for inspections\' sake.  The GoC will not make any 
dramatic moves prior to the inspectors\' February 14 report, 
but it realizes that time is quickly running out and is 
positioning itself domestically to support action against 
Iraq.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S LUNCH WITH TRANSPORT MINISTER 
COLLENETTE 
 
 
1. (U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE 
TREAT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
SUMMARY 
--------- 
2. (SBU) Transport Minister Collenette indicated to 
Ambassador on January 31 that the GOC is ready to start 
\"exploratory talks\" on further aviation liberalization with 
the United States.  Collenette admitted that his government 
sees little in cargo co-terminalization for Canada - too many 
small cargo jobs would be lost and Hamilton\'s future as the 
cargo hub in Canada would be threatened.  He suggested two 
longer-range topics: how to deal with the EU and what the 
\"North American air zone\" is likely to be ten years from now. 
 When pressed, however, Collenette said that there was no 
aviation issue that the GOC would preclude from discussion. 
In sum, talks should start with no preconditions.  After all, 
the Deputy Transport Minister added, in the two years leading 
up to the current Open Skies agreement, there were 
far-ranging talks that helped to lay the groundwork for the 
quick successful agreement we did reach.  It seems we are 
ready to embark on a similar period now, Ranger concluded. 
 
3. (SBU) On other issues, Collenette agreed with the USG that 
the European Commission\'s recommendation to have Galileo use 
the same frequencies as those used by the military makes no 
sense and the GOC will support our efforts to counter the EC. 
 There was also a brief discussion of infrastructure issues 
at major land border crossings, with Collenette remarking 
that more inspectors are needed to help reduce line-ups.  End 
Summary. 
 
4. (U) Canadian Minister of Transport David Collenette hosted 
Ambassador Cellucci over lunch on January 31.  His Deputy 
Minister Louis Ranger and Chief of Staff Sue Roland joined 
Collenette.  DCM and Econ MinCouns accompanied the Ambassador. 
 
Galileo 
--------- 
5. (SBU) Ambassador began the working lunch with a short 
explanation of why the USG is deeply concerned with the 
European Commission\'s recommendation that Galileo uses the 
same frequencies as those used by the military.  The Minister 
said he was very familiar with the issue and could not agree 
more with the US position.  While he does not have the lead 
in Cabinet on this, other ministers are aware of the problem 
and all are united that the Europeans should abandon it. 
 
Homeland Security 
----------------- 
6. (SBU) Collenette then went on to say that he and other 
senior GOC officials are quite anxious to get to know the new 
USG Homeland Security team.  At various times during the 
lunch, the Minister explained the excellent state of working 
relations with USG officials over the years and his desire 
(along with other Cabinet members) to establish the same with 
Homeland Security.  Ambassador encouraged Collenette in this 
regard, but suggested he wait until after March 1 to allow 
DHS time to complete its first organizational tasks. 
 
Aviation 
--------- 
7. (SBU) Then a long discussion of aviation issues ensued. 
The Ambassador started with suggesting that exploratory 
discussions of where we might make further steps in 
liberalization could start.  \"We ought to start talking,\" the 
Ambassador said.  In response to Collenetee\'s questions, the 
Ambassador acknowledged that cabotage remains a tough issue 
for us.  The Ambassador then highlighted the benefits to both 
sides of cargo co-terminalization.   Collenette described the 
benefits of the current cargo system - small Canadian 
carriers, operating out of the hub in Hamilton - and how if 
Canada were to grant co-terminalization, these jobs would be 
lost and the Hamilton hub (now the largest cargo hub in 
Canada) will cease to exist.  The uproar just caused by 
Culture Minister Sheila Copps (MP from Hamilton) would be 
enough on its own to stop co-terminalization in its tracks. 
While later admitting to the Ambassador that real benefits 
would accrue to small and medium size Canadian business from 
such a liberalization, the polit 
ical costs would just outweigh any benefits, he concluded. 
 
8. (SBU) That said, Collenette then went on to describe the 
benefits of the open skies agreement of several years ago. 
Canadian carriers were the big winners (which they never 
thought they would be - at one point they even asked 
Transport for a 15 year phase in period, Collenette 
chuckled), and while the issues now before us are tough nuts 
to crack, both sides should be prepared to talk.  Air Canada 
is \"very competitive\" and therefore would benefit from 
further liberalization, explained the Minister.  However, the 
smaller Canadian carriers, such as West Jet, \"could go 
belly-up.\"  Louis Ranger said that before Open Skies was 
successfully negotiated, there were at least two years of 
preliminary meetings.  Ranger wondered if we were not at the 
same starting point right now - while both sides sees little 
interest in catering to the other\'s needs, now is the time to 
start \"exploratory talks.\"  When pressed by the Ambassador 
for advice, the Minister was unable to suggest any Canadian 
business group whose endorsement of further liberalization 
would give the Liberal Government \"political cover.\"  In 
fact, Collenette opined, the probable successor to the 
current PM - Paul Martin - is probably less likely to support 
further liberalization (\"more nationalistic\") than the 
present administration.  Two specific agenda suggestions of 
the Minister were: how to deal with the EU, and what the 
\"North American air zone\" is likely to look like ten years 
from now. 
 
(Note: in a February 5 meeting with senior UPS officials, the 
Ambassador asked them about the effects of liberalizing air 
cargo on the future of the Hamilton hub.  They quickly 
replied that UPS had invested quite a bit in Hamilton and it 
would continue to be an important part of UPS\'s cargo 
operations.  In fact, they said that if liberalization were 
reached, Hamilton would likely to grow in investment and 
jobs.  Toronto Airport has too many flight restrictions and 
no room for cargo expansion.  End Note) 
 
St. Lawrence Seaway 
------------------- 
9. (SBU) Ranger then switched topics to the St. Lawrence 
Seaway.  There was a request made to the IJC to investigate 
deepening of the Seaway - it was to cost US$20 million - half 
paid by each government.  Where did it stand?  We did not 
know, but said we would get back to the Minister.  Collenette 
said that he recently had meetings with the Georgian Bay 
residents who are very concerned about water levels. 
 
Border infrastructure 
-------------------- 
10. (SBU) A short discussion of truck and road issues ensued, 
with Collenette explaining that Windsor, Ontario is not 
really interested in increasing truck traffic - and no 
interest in expanding current infrastructure.  Rather, said 
the Minister, US Customs needs to increase the number of 
inspectors in the booths - at present Collenette said the GOC 
estimate the U.S. booths run at only 55% of capacity. 
Ambassador replied that Customs has, in fact, hired more 
inspectors, but those extra folks are now only working their 
way through the training cycles.  Both agreed we need to keep 
our options open regarding use of the Detroit-Windsor 
railroad tunnel and more highways. 
 
11. (U) Collenette concluded the luncheon by explaining he 
will be at an \"inter-modal\"  conference in Denver in April 
during which he will make a keynote speech.  He is also on 
the board of the International Center at Stanford, and hoped 
to travel to Stanford around the time of the Denver meeting.

Summary 
------- 
 
2. (U) Air Canada\'s fourth quarter losses in 2002 are 
significant and have forced that airline to try to sell its 
maintenance, ground handling and commuter-feeder airline 
units. The federal government may reduce the air security 
fee from C$24 to C$18 to boost air travel, but there are few 
other options for federal cost cutting that can be passed on 
to the airline sector and traveling public. In the wake of 
global turbulence in the air travel sector, Air Canada and 
Canada\'s other airlines will have to adapt and restructure 
to the new market realities rather than rely on GOC 
maneuvering. However, restructuring may prove difficult 
unless the airline can attract foreign capital. End summary. 
 
3. (U) After posting profits in the spring and summer of 
2002, Air Canada, which accounts for more than 70 percent of 
all air passenger travel in Canada, took a beating in the 
last three months of 2002.  The airline lost C$364 million 
dollars (US$239 million) in the period, compared to C$277 
million dollars (US$182 million) in the period in 2001.  To 
stem its losses, the company intends to: 1) sell stakes in 
its aircraft maintenance, ground handling and regional 
airline units; 2) seek changes in work rules and other 
concessions from its 36,000 employees, and 3) turn its cargo 
operation, employing 1,700 people, into a separate 
subsidiary. 
 
4. (U) The troubles of Air Canada have led the Minister of 
Transportation, David Collennette to consider reducing the 
government imposed C$24 a ticket airline security fee and, 
or, reduce other fees such as navigation system charges and 
airport landing fees. 
 
5. (SBU) According to Ministry of Finance officials the 
lowest the security fee could be reduced to, and still meet 
revenue needs given federally mandated aviation security 
expenditures, is C$18.  An official with the Airline Pilots 
Association (ALPA) in Ottawa is confident that the fee will 
indeed be lowered, however, whether it will be reduced 
across the board or will be prorated on distance flown, is 
still up in the air. 
 
6. (U) The Minister\'s expostulations on reducing Navigation 
fees and airport fees are much less certain. The entities 
that collect these fees and provide the corresponding 
services are private sector corporations that have not been 
under federal government management since the mid- to late- 
1990s.  These non-share corporations cannot raise equity 
capital and must rely on fees and debt to finance their 
activities (and all surplus funds must be reinvested in the 
corporation). NAV Canada, which provides Canada\'s Air 
Navigation Services, was spun out of the federal government 
in 1996.  It owns its infrastructure assets and sets its 
fees independent of the GOC. 
 
7. (U) The federal government, however, remains the owner of 
Canada\'s major airports, although they are operated by 
independent local \"Airport Authorities\" (and the GOC is paid 
rent under sixty-year long lease arrangements). The airport 
authorities\' fees and charges are not subject to review by 
the GOC. In particular Airport Improvement Fees (AIF) 
provide an attractive revenue source since passengers are 
largely captive. All major Canadian airports have either 
introduced AIFs or are in the process of doing so. Thus the 
GOC cannot simply force the airport authorities or NAV 
Canada to reduce fees - and unless the GOC provides 
operating subsidies to these entities to make up for any 
lost revenue there would be no incentive for them to do so. 
In a best case scenario the GOC would have only the option 
of reducing the rent it takes from the airport authorities 
and hope that the airports would pass the savings along to 
air travelers, perhaps by reducing AIFs. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) At this juncture the conventional wisdom among 
airline industry observers is that the GOC is very unlikely 
to engage in direct subsidies of NAV Canada and the airports 
to save money for the airlines.  An overt bailout of Air 
Canada, of the type seen in the United States post 9-11 is 
also not on the table.  The big losses posted by Air Canada 
this past quarter now places all of North America\'s \"full 
service\" carriers in the same tough financial straits but, 
despite the serious crisis in the industry, Minister 
Collenette\'s only real option is to reduce the security fee. 
Indeed, Collenette has inferred there is little the 
government can do in the face of a global decline in air 
travel in the wake of 9-11 - and it will be up to Air Canada 
to continue to adapt and restructure to become profitable 
under the new market conditions.  After all, the \"low-cost\" 
model airlines (e.g. Southwest, Jet Blue, and Canada\'s 
WestJet) are managing to make money. Embassy doubts whether 
Air Canada will be able to raise enough cash by selling 
assets to Canadian entities; a significant investment of 
foreign capital in the Canadian aviation industry will be 
vital to Air Canada\'s long-term health.  However, given the 
current state of the industry, it is not clear where that 
capital will be found.

2. (SBU) In response to reftel A request for a high-level demarche 
on EU plans for Galileo Public Regulated Service (PRS) to overlay 
the radio frequencies used by the GPS M-code, Ambassador Cellucci 
wrote letters to the Ministers of Defense, Foreign Affairs, 
Transportation and Industry.  Minister of Foreign Affairs Graham 
provided a coordinated response from the Government of Canada in 
his letter of January 27, 2003 to the Ambassador.  The text of the 
letter, provided in paragraph 2 below, provides assurances that 
Canada will \"continue to fully support the United States in urging 
the European Commission to agree to adopt different frequencies 
from the M-code.\" Ambassador Cellucci also discussed this issue 
with Minister of Transportation Collenette on January 31. 
Collenette echoed the supportive position expressed in Graham\'s 
letter. 
 
3. Text of Minister Graham\'s letter. 
 
Dear Ambassador: 
 
     Thank you for your letter of December 19, 2002, regarding the 
proposed European Galileo satellite navigation system and the 
implications for NATO members. 
     Canada has always publicly maintained the position that 
Galileo and the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United 
States should be compatible and interoperable for the benefit of 
all potential users. 
 
     As noted in your letter, the European Commission (EC) has 
recommended that Galileo\'s Public Regulated Service\" (or PRS), use 
the same frequencies that are used by the military service (M-code) 
of the GPS.  During discussions at NATO, Canada has publicly stated 
its concern that, by sharing the same frequencies, the ability of 
the Alliance to jam enemy forces employing the Galileo system could 
be impeded.  Canada\'s position is that Galileo should not use the 
same frequencies at the GPS M-code signal unless it can 
conclusively be proven that there will be no interference with the 
military use of the GPS. 
 
     To that end, Canada has urged the European Commission to 
conduct a thorough testing of the system design to prove its claim 
that overlaying the Galileo PRS code on the GPS M-code would not in 
any way interfere with the military use of the GPS.  The EC has yet 
to conclusively prove its claim.  Until the EC can do so, Canada 
will continue to fully support the United States in urging the 
European Commission to agree to adopt different frequencies from 
the M-code.  With the assistance of the European Union members in 
NATO, we will support efforts to generate a consensus to drop the M- 
code overlay option for the Galileo system. 
 
     I look forward to discussing this issue with you in the coming 
months with a view to seeking a resolution in favour of an 
effective global civil navigation satellite system architecture. 
 
                              Sincerely 
"

1. As requested in reftel, Embassy passed U.S. views on 
upcoming negotiation of the FCTC in Geneva to officials in 
Health Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) and Agriculture Canada. 
 
2. EST Counselor followed up with Ed Aiston, Director 
General, International Affairs Directorate at Health Canada 
for Canadian views on the negotiations.  Aiston indicated 
that the GOC\'s views were very similar to those of the U.S., 
particularly with regard to the relationship between trade 
and domestic health regimes.  He said that Canada had 
proposed the deletion of references in previous texts to 
\"trade and health,\" and was pleased to see that the 
Chairman\'s text reflected their proposal.  Aiston noted that 
Canada could support reference to \"non-discrimination\" in 
trade as a \"fall-back\" position, but wanted to ensure that 
trade and domestic health regimes were treated separately in 
the FCTC.  Given the lack of specific subsidies to Canadian 
tobacco growers, proposals for the treatment of production 
subsidies is of less concern to the GOC. 
 
3. Aiston, who will lead the Canadian delegation to the 
negotiating session in Geneva later this month, asked that 
the Embassy alert Washington agencies to some of the 
concerns that the GOC has in the Chairman\'s text.  The most 
important concern is with the \"conditionality\"on tax policy. 
The GOC would like a stronger statement on sovereign rights 
of governments to establish their own tax policies. 
 
4. Also of concern in the Chairman\'s text is the issue of 
duty-free sales.  The GOC would like to see the duty-free 
issue treated in a separate article that clearly states that 
duty-free sales refer to sales to individuals, and not bulk 
sales.  Finally, the Canadian delegation will propose a 
separate article for \"sharing of information on the rates of 
taxation.

SUBJECT: MANITOBA: NEW ELECTRICITY OPTIONS 
 
THIS IS A PRODUCT OF AMERICAN PRESENCE 
POST WINNIPEG. 
 
1.  Summary and introduction.  The Province of 
Manitoba and its state-owned hydroelectricity 
utility, Manitoba Hydro, seek to greatly expand 
hydroelectricity exports to the United States 
from the already considerable level of 8.8 
terawatt hours, with a value of C$495 million 
per anum.  Officials estimate that an 
additional 5000 mw of electricity - equal to 
its total existing capacity - could be 
developed in Manitoba without significant local 
political, legal or social disruption.  Most of 
this new capacity could be made available for 
the U.S. market, helping to guarantee energy 
security for U.S. consumers from a close-by, 
clean, secure and relatively inexpensive source 
of power.  Two challenges have prevented this 
from coming to fruition: 1) A lack of 
transmission capability to get the electricity 
to the large U.S. markets of the Midwest, and 
2) The current uncertainty and price 
instability caused by industry restructuring in 
the United States and Canada, which makes 
Manitoba Hydro and outside investors reluctant 
to make the large capital investment in 
hydroelectricity infrastructure.  End Summary 
and Introduction. 
 
2.  Manitoba sees tremendous potential in the 
vast demand for energy in the U.S. Midwest. 
Chicago and Milwaukee are physically much 
closer to Manitoba than Ontario\'s industrial 
heartland, cutting down the distance required 
to transport the electricity, and the demand is 
far greater than in Manitoba\'s western 
neighbors of Saskatchewan and Alberta.  In a 
meeting with Embassy Energy Officer and 
Winnipeg Econ Assistant, Manitoba Hydro 
President and CEO Bob Brennan indicated that 
his company has estimated that Wisconsin alone 
will need close to 7000 mw of power in the next 
few years, an amount greater than all of 
Manitoba\'s potential development.  (Note: 
Medium-term in the construction of 
hydroelectric facilities means at least 10 
years). 
 
\"Tell us what we have to do\" 
--------------------------- 
 
3. Manitoba is clearly very interested in 
supplying new demand in the U.S. Midwest, but 
there is no way to get the power there. 
Manitoba Energy Minister Sale put it best when 
he said, \"Tell us what we have to do.\"  The 
lack of east-west transmission capability in 
the upper Midwest is one of the most 
significant problems Manitoba faces in 
exporting large quantities of power to the 
United States.  The energy Minister explained 
that the North American electricity market is 
divided into largely self-sufficient clusters, 
with only a minimum amount of interconnection 
between them.  The upper Midwest (including 
Minnesota and the Dakotas) is one \"cluster\" 
while Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana is 
another.  Interconnectivity is weak between the 
two, and as a result it is impossible to move 
electricity - in any great quantities - to 
Milwaukee and Chicago.  Manitoba Hydro began 
full operations in February 2002 with the 
Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) 
organization, permitting open wholesale 
transmission access to the Midwest market. 
Although MISO holds out the promise of expanded 
access to Midwest markets, Manitoba is 
disappointed with the lack of any progress to 
date in expanding transmission facilities 
between the upper Midwest (Minnesota and the 
Dakotas) and the adjacent markets to the south 
and east. 
 
4.  Manitoba Hydro has been exporting 
electricity to the United States since 1970, 
and consistently ranks among the top three 
exporters of electricity among Canadian 
provinces (behind Quebec and British Columbia), 
exporting over 8.8 terawatt hours in 2001-2002. 
Currently, Manitoba Hydro has nine long-term 
export trade agreements with six electric 
utilities and numerous short-term agreements 
with more than 30 electric utilities and 
marketers in the Midwestern United States, as 
well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and 
Saskatchewan.  In July 2002, Manitoba Hydro 
contracted with Northern States Power (Xcel 
Energy) of Minnesota to sell 500 megawatts of 
power over 10 years, beginning in 2006, which 
replaces a similar 12-year deal between the two 
utilities that expires in 2005. 
 
Kyoto - Fiasco to Some, Opportunities to Others 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5.  Although Canada\'s petroleum industry in 
Alberta and Saskatchewan, and its manufacturing 
heartland of Ontario, stand to be hurt by the 
emission control measures likely to flow from 
GOC implementation of Kyoto, Manitoba sees 
opportunities.  The province views itself as 
having a natural advantage in its \"clean\" 
surplus hydro-generated electricity and in 
developing peripheral energy industries in 
ethanol - to capitalize on Manitoba\'s surplus 
of feed wheat - as well as an innovative 
proposal by the Ottawa-based Iogene company to 
derive ethanol from straw.  The GOM is also 
promoting development of hydrogen and wind 
energy sources, which it views as complementary 
to its hydro resources. 
 
6.  Manitoba\'s left-of-center New Democratic 
Party (NDP) government has been a staunch 
supporter of the Kyoto Accord for a number of 
years.  Manitoba Premier Gary Doer has 
consistently been the Prime Minister\'s 
strongest advocate among the Premiers for 
Canada\'s ratification of the deal.  Manitoba 
hopes to leverage the resulting goodwill into 
GOC support for a C$1 billion transmission line 
that would allow Manitoba to sell surplus 
hydroelectricity to Ontario, Canada\'s 
industrial heartland.  (Note: There is 
currently no large-scale transmission 
capability between Manitoba and southern 
Ontario). This possibility has been raised 
repeatedly in recent years, and Manitoba Energy 
Minister Tim Sale traveled to Ottawa in January 
to press the GOC on the issue.  Prime Minister 
Chretien has at times expressed interest in 
this idea, but his preference is a privately 
financed new north-south connection to the U.S. 
 
7.  Although as a government-owned utility 
Manitoba Hydro is exempt from taxation, the NDP 
government has increasingly turned to the 
utility as a revenue source, tapping it for 
C$354 million this year in fees, services 
charges, and a special \"dividend\" payment to 
help the government balance its budget.  The 
NDP government has given strong signals that it 
plans to build new generating facilities in 
northern Manitoba, but must secure additional 
export markets with long-term contracts to 
justify the capital expense. The province has 
also indicated a preference for building 
smaller projects like Wuskwatim (200 mw) or 
Gull (600 mw) before the large-scale Conawapa 
Dam (1400 mw).  The Wuskwatim project will cost 
about C$1 billion and take at least 10 years to 
build. 
 
 
 
Environmental Concerns Are Muted 
-------------------------------- 
8.  Manitoba Energy Minister Sale admitted to 
us that the hydro-electric generating 
facilities constructed in the 1960s were built 
too big and caused extensive environmental 
damage to traditional Indian hunting and 
fishing grounds in northern Manitoba.  One of 
the affected bands, Cross Lake, continues to 
fight a public relations battle with Manitoba 
Hydro, especially in the Minnesota market, even 
after Manitoba Hydro provided Cross Lake C$70 
million in compensation. Manitoba Hydro has 
settled with the other four bands that were 
affected by the flooding and the vast majority 
of Manitoba Indian bands are supportive of 
hydro-electricity development.  Minister Sale 
speculated that the Cross Lake band is being 
\"used\" by U.S. environmental groups who - he 
says - oppose any and all hydro-electricity 
expansion as a matter of principle.  He 
believes that Canadian environmental groups 
have more of a mixed reaction to the Cross Lake 
concerns, and he is confident that the smaller 
projects like Wuskwatim could proceed with 
little effective opposition from domestic 
groups. 
 
What next? 
---------- 
 
9.  Manitoba Hydro has immense hydro- 
electricity potential that could be developed 
with relatively little environmental impact. 
Even the construction of hundreds of miles of 
transmission lines from the remote northern 
generating stations to the U.S. border raises 
few eyebrows here.  Manitoba Hydro officials 
are aware of immense opportunities for sales of 
hydroelectricity in the United States, but have 
not had significant success in expanding beyond 
their relatively small base of supplying power 
to several upper Midwest states.  In addition 
to the limits imposed by existing transmission 
capacity, the partially de-regulated U.S. 
electricity utilities are not interested in the 
long-term contracts Manitoba Hydro would need 
to justify the construction of new dams or 
enhanced transmission cables. 
 
10.  Currently, Manitoba hopes that its support 
for the Kyoto Accord will result in a federally 
funded transmission line to take Manitoba\'s 
electricity to Ontario - replacing \"dirtier\" 
forms of energy generation there - but the 
federal government has made no commitment. 
Manitoba sees some opportunities for exports to 
Canada\'s western provinces, but the quantities 
are relatively small, and again the 
transmission lines are inadequate to handle 
much more traffic. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  Manitoba is committed to developing its 
hydroelectric generation potential and will 
ultimately find markets for it output, given 
its low cost of generation and relatively low 
barriers (compared to other jurisdictions) to 
transmission line construction.  The question 
that remains is who will get it.  There is an 
open window of opportunity for border states of 
the U.S. Midwest to work with Manitoba to 
overcome obstacles posed by transmission 
limitations and industry restructuring - and 
get a guaranteed supply of potentially low-cost 
electricity from a nearby source.  However, if 
American utilities miss this opportunity, 
Canadians will find a way to get Manitoba\'s 
abundant and inexpensive electricity to the 
Canadian heartland of Ontario where the 
appetite is equally large.

SUBJECT: CANADA TO PROVIDE BATTALION AND BRIGADE 
HEADQUARTERS FOR ISAF IV AND V 
 
REF: STATE 29380 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum 
announced on February 12 that Canada will contribute a 
battalion and a brigade headquarters - a total of 1500 to 
2000 personnel - to the International Security Assistance 
Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan beginning in August.  Two 
rotations of Canadian Forces will be in Afghanistan for six 
months each, covering ISAF IV and ISAF V.  Canada is looking 
to partner with Germany, the Netherlands or a NATO contingent 
in ISAF IV, and with Italy in ISAF V.  While the official 
opposition Canadian Alliance Party has criticized the ISAF 
commitment as an easy alternative to military participation 
in Iraq, the GoC still has its options open, especially for 
naval and air assets already in the region as part of 
Operation Enduring Freedom.  The Chretien Government\'s 
unwillingness to take deployment steps that could be seen as 
prejudging UN inspections in Iraq made ISAF a more attactive 
option for the use of Canadian ground forces.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) While McCallum had discussed Canada\'s ISAF 
contribution with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on February 4, 
the GoC had put off announcing this decision because it 
wanted this to be seen as separate from a Canadian decision 
on a military contribution against Iraq.  McCallum emphasized 
to the press that the ISAF contribution does not affect 
Canada\'s decision on Iraq, though he admitted it limits the 
availability of certain forces.  The far more likely 
contribution for Iraq is Canadian naval and air assets 
already in theater as part of Operation Enduring Freedom 
(OEF).  Canada is currently in command of Naval Task Force 
151, and is deploying a Destroyer to the region. 
 
3. (C) Ever since the GoC announced that it would not be 
replacing its light infantry battalion that served in 
Afghanistan January - July 2002 as part of OEF, it has kept 
open the possibility of sending troops back to Afghanistan in 
2003, when operational tempo made it more feasible.  After 
his January 9 meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld and discussions 
with other allies, McCallum told Cabinet that Canada was 
being encouraged to take on a leadership role in ISAF. 
Internally, the Canadian Forces complained that this 
foreclosed the ground forces option in Iraq, but they were 
overruled.  As Ron Hoffman, Foreign Affairs Director for 
Defense and Security Relations, told us, the GoC takes 
seriously its obligations in Afghanistan and wants to help 
ensure the success of the transition there. 
 
4. (C) Wendy Gilmour, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for 
Regional Security and Peacekeeping, told us that German and 
Dutch military officials will be briefing Canadian 
counterparts on ISAF on February 18.  The Canadian Forces do 
not have sufficient resources available to lead ISAF on their 
own, Gilmour said, and they hope to partner with the Germans, 
the Dutch or (if France relents) a NATO contingent in ISAF 
IV.  Prime Minister Chretien has already discussed a possible 
partnership with German Chancellor Schroeder.  For ISAF V, 
Canada hopes that Italy will be able to join.  Gilmour noted 
that Italy has expressed interest in that time frame, coming 
after an Italian battalion is scheduled to depart Kosovo. 
 
5. (C) Canada will be working on a force generation plan as 
it sees what capabilities are needed to complement other 
partners.  Transport for the Canadian Forces is likely to be 
commercial, assuming the security situation in Afghanistan 
does not deteriorate.  We asked about Canada\'s views on 
possibly expanding ISAF beyond Kabul.  Gilmour said that she 
did not expect the ISAF mandate to change.  As for working 
with Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs - reftel), Gilmour 
had earlier expressed concern about PRTs blurring the line 
between combat and peace support missions, but said that she 
recently had gotten positive feedback from NGOs and the UN 
about PRT efforts in Afghanistan.

OF THE VICTORIOUS PRO-FTA SIDE IN CANADA\'S DECISIVE 1988 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  AS D\'AQUINO ENJOYS NOTING, THE DOOMSDAY 
ECONOMIC SCENARIOS WHICH HIS CRITICS THEN FORECAST HAVE BEEN 
\"SPECTACULARLY FULFILLED, IN REVERSE\" BY CANADA\'S SUBSEQUENT 
TRADE AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. 
 
2.   THE \"NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY AND PROSPERITY\" INITIATIVE 
IS OUTLINED AT LENGTH IN A PRESENTATION ON CCCE\'S WEBSITE 
(CEOCOUNCIL.CA).  D\'AQUINO STRESSES THAT IT DOES NOT/NOT 
PROPOSE A CUSTOMS OR CURRENCY UNION, COMMON MARKET, UNION OF 
FOREIGN/DEFENSE POLICIES, OR SUPRANATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
RATHER, ITS KEY POINTS ARE: 
 
(I) MAKING THE U.S.-CANADA BORDER A \"ZONE OF COOPERATION,\" 
NOT A LINE OF DEFENSE; MOVING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AWAY 
FROM THE BORDER ITSELF; AND MAKING THE BORDER \"AN EFFECTIVE, 
SHARED CHECKPOINT WITHIN AN INTEGRATED ECONOMIC SPACE.\" 
 
(II) REGULATORY INTEGRATION TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY.  THREE 
SENSITIVE AREAS ARE RECOGNIZED:  THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF 
TRADE REMEDY LAWS WITH AN INTEGRATED MARKET; THE NEED TO 
REMOVE RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP IN BIG 
INDUSTRIES; AND IMPEDIMENTS TO THE MOBILITY OF SKILLED 
LABOR. 
 
(III) BUILDING RESOURCE SECURITY BASED ON OPEN MARKETS AND 
REGULATORY COMPATIBILITY, ON THE PATTERN NOW WORKING SO WELL 
IN ENERGY MARKETS - WITH PERMANENT RESOLUTION OF PRICING AND 
SUBSIDIES ISSUES IN OTHER RESOURCE INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS 
FOREST PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURE. 
 
(IV) MEETING HOMELAND SECURITY NEEDS, WITH CANADA AFFIRMING 
ITS SOVEREIGNTY BY MAKING A VASTLY MORE EFFECTIVE 
CONTRIBUTION TO ITS OWN DEFENSE, MOVING TO A NEW PHASE OF 
COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES ON CONTINENTAL SECURITY, 
AND BEING AN EFFECTIVE PLAYER IN THE GLOBAL EFFORT TO COMBAT 
TERRORISM. 
 
(V) BUILDING TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY INSTITUTIONS.  NAFTA NEVER 
PRETENDED TO OFFER A FRAMEWORK FOR MANAGING ALL CONTINENTAL 
ISSUES, AND THE EU (SUPRANATIONAL) MODEL IS NOT APPROPRIATE 
FOR NORTH AMERICA.  SPECIALIZED, EXPERT JOINT COMMISSIONS, 
ON THE PATTERN OF THE U.S.-CANADA INTERNATIONAL JOINT 
COMMISSION (IJC), MIGHT OFFER A BETTER MODEL FOR 
IMPLEMENTING NASP AMONG THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND 
MEXICO. 
 
3.   COMMENT:  MISSION CANADA HAS WITNESSED MANY INITIATIVES 
TOWARD GREATER U.S.-CANADA INTEGRATION OVER THE YEARS SINCE 
THE BILATERAL FTA WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED IN 1989.  OF THESE, 
THE RIDGE-MANLEY SMART BORDER PROCESS STANDS OUT AS HAVING 
DELIVERED THE SWIFTEST AND MOST RECENT RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE CCCE\'S NASP INITIATIVE MAY HOLD LONGER-TERM 
PROMISE.  FIRST, IT FOLLOWS AND BUILDS UPON THE RIDGE-MANLEY 
PROCESS.  SECOND, IT ORIGINATES WITH MAJOR BUSINESSES, THE 
GROUP BEST ABLE TO PROVIDE DETERMINED, BOTTOM-UP LEADERSHIP 
OF THE SCOPE LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED.  THIRD, NASP CONFORMS TO 
OUR OWN VISION OF A DESIRABLE AND ATTAINABLE AGENDA FOR 
BILATERAL INTEGRATION.  ITS INCLUSION OF A MAJOR 
SECURITY/DEFENSE COMPONENT IS BOTH ITS STRENGTH (NASP 
ACKNOWLEDGES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ELEMENT TO THE USG, 
THOUGH D\'AQUINO STRESSES THAT THE GOC MUST INVEST IN 
SECURITY FOR ITS OWN SAKE, NOT MERELY AS A CONCESSION) AND 
ITS WEAKNESS (AT LEAST UNTIL NOW, THE GOC HAS NOT BEEN 
PREPARED TO MAKE DEFENSE INVESTMENTS ON THE SCALE CALLED FOR 
UNDER NASP).

TAGS: PREL, PARM, MOPS, IZ, CA, Iraq, UN 
SUBJECT: IRAQ/UN: CANADIAN REACTION TO FEBRUARY 14 
INSPECTORS\' REPORT 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 15. (b) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) Canadian Foreign Minister Bill Graham, speaking to 
the press after the February 14 weapons inspectors\' report to 
the UN Security Council, said that the report shows progress 
as well as the need for continued pressure on Iraq.  Graham 
said that while no-one is excluding the use of force, that is 
the last resort, and there is still a chance war can be 
avoided.  Echoing Prime Minister Chretien\'s February 13 
speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, Graham 
emphasized the importance of staying faithful to the UN 
process and Resolution 1441.  He argued that no country, 
including the United States, intended to move immediately 
against Iraq.  When pressed on whether Canada would 
participate in a military campagin against Iraq that did not 
have UN blessing, Graham refused to speculate. 
 
2. (SBU) Early reaction in the Canadian media was that the 
inspectors\' report supports the French argument for continued 
inspections.  Commentators noted that Blix and El-Baradei 
felt there was still useful work to be done, and that they 
are still building their capacity. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT: While the GoC continues to keep its options 
open, the inspectors\' report does not help our case here in 
the court of public opinion.  Chretien\'s Liberal Party is 
split over Iraq, with four backbench MPs voting for a 
February 11 opposition resolution  requiring explicit UNSC 
endorsement for action if Canadian were to participate.  So 
long as the inspectors say they are making progress and the 
Security Council is not ready to abandon that process, the 
GoC will find it hard to disagree. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT CONT\'D: Graham did tell the press that time is 
\"very limited\" for Iraq, but the GoC would clearly prefer 
some accommodation between the U.S. and France in the 
Security Council.  In that vein, we note that Graham also 
mentioned he would be discussing Iraq later on February 14 
with the Mexican Foreign Minister.  As for the NATO dispute 
over support to Turkey, Foreign Affairs contacts tell us that 
Graham and Political Director Jim Wright took the French 
Ambassador to task this week over France\'s continued 
obstruction.

1.  (C)  Charge contacted Canadian Political Director Jim 
Wright Feb. 16 to urge that Canada make a statement on Iraq 
during the Feb. 18 UNSC Open Meeting.    Wright said he had 
already drafted such a statement for Foreign Minister Graham 
- one which tracks very well with the talking points reftel - 
and was recommending that Canada use this chance to put its 
views before the entire UNSC.  Wright said he would let the 
minister know we had indeed urged Canada to take this step. 
 
2.  (C)  Wright said his draft statement makes the following 
points: 
 
--    Canada believes the fundamental issue is that Iraq has 
not accepted the need to disarm itself. 
 
--    Intensified inspections are not the answer.  The answer 
is a change in attitude on the part of Iraq. 
 
--    If Iraq was providing willing, active and transparent 
cooperation to the inspectors, the inspection process could 
be very short. 
 
--    Canada continues to say it wants the issued resolved 
through the United Nations. 
 
--    A divided UNSC serves no one\'s purposes. 
 
--    Time is clearly running out. 
 
3. (C)   Wright said he had followed the Secretary\'s Feb. 14 
statement very closely.  He was urging FM Graham to use the 
Open Meeting as an opportunity for Canada to put its views 
before all the UNSC members before they meet on a possible 
second resolution, with the intention of putting the onus of 
action on the council and the Iraqis..  He said he would have 
a chance to discuss this more with the U.S. this week in 
Paris at the G-8 political directors meeting, where he would 
see Under Secretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman. 
 
4. (C)  Comment:  Wright stressed that Graham had not yet 
signed off on his draft, nor definitively decided to make a 
statement.  But on the latter point he asked, \"Why wouldn\'t 
we?\", and on the former, he implied his minister would be on 
board.  End Comment.

(SBU) Canada shares our strong concerns (reftel) over North 
Korea\'s announced intention to withdraw from the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  Foreign Minister Graham 
issued a press release on January 10 (available at

decision.  Ron Stansfield of Foreign Affairs\' Nuclear and 
Chemical Disarmament Agency told us that the GoC also has 
tried to contact the DPRK privately to encourage them not to 
follow through, but has gotten no response.  Stansfield said 
the GoC expected that after UN Security Council 
consideration, action would move back to the IAEA, and 
wondered what steps could be taken then.  He said the GoC 
will continue to work in multilateral fora to encourage the 
DPRK to step back before its NPT withdrawal becomes 
\"official\" on April 9.

SUBJECT:  Invasive Species: IJC speaks to Parliamentary 
Committee 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. The American Co-Chair of the International Joint 
Commission (IJC) sought the support of members of the House 
of Commons Fisheries and Oceans committee for a joint US-GoC 
reference to the IJC on the Great Lakes invasive species 
problem. First impressions are that the committee is pre- 
occupied with other matters and will not be the Commons 
committee to push the GoC toward endorsing a joint 
reference.  End summary. 
 
2. Dennis Schornack, Chair of the U.S. Section of the IJC 
briefed members of the House of Commons Standing Committee 
on Fisheries and Oceans on February 11th concerning Alien 
Invasive Species.  Schornack\'s comments are provided in full 
(as well as statements by Canadian Section Chair Herb Gray 
and Canadian Commissioner Robert Gourd) at the following IJC 
web address: 
 
http://www.ijc.org/ijcweb-e.html 
 
3. The bottom-line message from Schornack to the members of 
the committee was: invasive species are the number one 
threat to the economic and biological integrity of the Great 
Lakes and the IJC continues to call for a reference from the 
two governments to coordinate and harmonize bi-national 
efforts to stop this threat. (Such a reference was first 
recommended in September 2002 in the IJC\'s 11th Biennial 
Report on Great Lakes Water Quality.) 
 
4 With respect to the most up-to-date assessment of what 
action needs to be taken to confront this challenge, Mr. 
Schornack noted the recent report published by the 
International Association for Great Lakes Research (IAGLR). 
It\'s called \"Research and Management Priorities for Aquatic 
Invasive Species in the Great Lakes\" and is available at: 
http://www.iaglr.org/scipolicy/ais/ 
 
5. This was only the second set of hearings by this 
committee on the issue. The first hearing, on February 6th, 
featured Chris Goddard, Executive Secretary of the Great 
Lakes Fisheries Commission. At the end of February, the 
Committee expects to hear from representatives of the 
Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Transport 
Canada and Environment Canada.  According to the Clerk of 
the committee, given other priorities, the earliest date for 
the Committee to issue a report on invasive species will be 
the end of April. 
 
-------------------------- 
Impact of IJC presentation 
-------------------------- 
 
6. In Emboff\'s opinion, there was no evidence that the IJC\'s 
presentation will elicit a strong effort from this committee 
or lead to GoC support for a reference to the IJC. There are 
those on the committee who feel this is a significant issue 
demanding immediate government focus, but it is not clear 
this particular committee will take the lead in pressing the 
GoC for action on invasive species. 
 
7. The government has had an \"action plan\" on invasive 
species since 1995 (put in place in response to the 
Convention on Biological Diversity) that names the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada and 
Transport Canada as the responsible agencies.  The problem, 
however, according to the Commissioner of Environment and 
Sustainable Development (part of the GoC Auditor General\'s 
organization), is that none of these departments is willing 
to take a leading role to ensure that the action plan 
results in concrete actions.  Likewise, many members of the 
Fisheries and Oceans Committee believe that another 
committee, perhaps Environment, should take the lead on this 
issue. 
 
8. There was one suggestion, however, which we expect to 
appear in the Committee\'s final report.  The Canadian Chair, 
Herb Gray, made the eminently sensible recommendation that 
one cabinet Minister should be named as the lead Minister on 
Invasive Species and have the power of the Prime Minister 
behind him or her to move departments forward in a 
coordinated fashion.  This might energize GoC action on 
Invasive species - and reduce the impetus for a reference to 
the IJC. 
 
9. Comment: Although the IJC presentation to the Committee 
may not be critical in the GoC\'s decision process, it does 
fit with the generally greater emphasis this issue is 
getting in Ottawa.  We continue to receive \"feelers\" from 
DFAIT about their interest in consulting with Washington on 
IJC\'s proposal for a joint reference, as well as addressing 
the broader issue of dealing with alien invasive species in 
the \"North American\" context.  End comment.

TAGS: MARR, PARM, PREL, CA, Missile Defense 
SUBJECT: CANADIAN CABINET TO DISCUSS MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
REF: 02 OTTAWA 3101 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Following up on high-level consultations held in 
Washington January 28, the Canadian cabinet will be meeting 
soon to discuss potential missile defense cooperation with 
the United States.  Missile defense is currently on the 
calendar for the February 25 Cabinet meeting (Cabinet 
normally meets each Tuesday), but this may slip to a later 
date.  Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum, 
who decided in October to accelerate dialogue with the U.S. 
on this issue (reftel), hope to get some guidance from Prime 
Minister Chretien on how to proceed. 
 
2. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and Defense (DND) officials 
got a clear message in the January 28 meeting that the 
missile defense program is progressing rapidly, and that 
there are costs to delaying a decision on Canadian 
participation.  Vincent Rigby, DND Director of Arms and 
Proliferation Control Policy, told us that the GoC had always 
assumed that we would want to use NORAD as part of the 
missile defense command structure.  Now that the U.S. has 
decided on STRATCOM as overall command and NORTHCOM as 
executing command for North America, NORAD appears to be more 
of an afterthought.  While U.S. officials made it clear that 
we were leaving the door open for a NORAD role, Rigby\'s sense 
was that NORTHCOM was the natural choice as executing command 
for North America, and that it would be difficult to change 
that down the road. 
 
3. (C) Daniel Bon, DND Director General for Policy Planning, 
told us that the lack of a definable \"need\" for Canadian 
participation made it more difficult to sell this to Cabinet. 
 He noted the absence of U.S. plans for NORAD participation 
or for missile defense installations in Canada, although 
acknowledging that Canada\'s indecision had kept it on the 
sidelines.  Bon believed that Chretien did not want missile 
defense participation to be part of his \"legacy\" in his last 
year in office, and would punt the decision to his successor. 
 
4. (C) Ron Hoffman, Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) Director for 
Defense and Security Relations, told us that the GoC would 
have a lot of work to do with Parliament and the Canadian 
public in selling Canadian participation.  He noted that a 
recent Commons Foreign Affairs Committee report, specifically 
recommending that the GoC not participate in missile defense, 
was unhelpful in this regard.  The GoC\'s increased interest 
in missile defense was still largely under the radar, Hoffman 
continued, as there was little general awareness of a shift 
in Government policy. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: DFAIT and DND are hoping that they will at 
least get a green light from Cabinet to participate in 
certain aspects of missile defense.  Given near-term 
decisions in the U.S. on missile defense industrial projects, 
and the Command decisions that have already been taken, DFAIT 
and DND would like to move forward on industrial cooperation 
and at least leave the door open to NORAD participation. 
Beyond that, it is not clear that Prime Minister Chretien 
will be ready to make a clear decision on Canadian 
participation.  Missile defense remains controversial in 
Ottawa because of arms control concerns (i.e., weaponization 
of space), and the Liberal Party is already divided over 
Iraq.  Given the likelihood that the GoC will be making a 
controversial decision to participate militarily in an Iraq 
campaign, Chretien is unlikely to give more than a muffled 
response on missile defense.

1. EconCouns passed reftel talking points to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Director for 
Trade Remedies Mike Robertson on February 20. Robertson noted 
significant overlap between the U.S. goals and the GOC\'s 
objectives for the February 24-25 Study Group meeting.  He 
said Canada and the United States had exchanged papers and he 
had seen several other countries\' comments as well. 
 
2. Based on the positive outcome of the December meeting and 
the good work he had seen since, Robertson was optimistic 
that next week\'s meeting would make substantial progress 
toward effective discipline of steel subsidies.  He did note 
a couple of areas that, in Canada\'s view, were not ripe for 
discussion.  For example, said Robertson, Canada will not 
take a position on enforcement mechanisms until the GOC is 
clear on what is being enforced.  Similarly, Robertson said 
there was no way of knowing what kind of special and 
differential (S&D) treatment should be offered and to whom 
without knowing the range of agreed disciplines to which the 
non-S&D participants were willing to submit. 
 
3.  Robertson welcomed the expression of U.S. gratitude for 
effective NAFTA solidarity at the December meeting, agreeing 
that it had been a factor in increasing the momentum of the 
OECD effort.  He also praised the hard work of the OECD 
secretariat in pressing participants for written comment.

Summary 
------- 
 
2. (SBU) Dubbed Prime Minister Jean Chretien\'s \"Legacy\" 
by Canadian analysts, the budget presented on February 18 
is the largest fiscal stimulus package since the Trudeau 
era 20 years ago, and the second largest spending program 
in 40 years.  The \"Jean Billionaire Budget\", with C$14.3 
billion this year (FY03-04), and C$38 billion over the 
next five years, includes something for almost everyone 
but few surprises. (Note:  using an exchange rate of 1C$ 
= 66 UScents, new spending FY2003-2004 would be US$9.4 
billion and over five years, US$25.1 billion.) Despite 
the 11.5% increase in spending (four times the rate of 
inflation) this is the GOC\'s sixth consecutive balanced 
budget and does provide for debt reduction. 
 
3.  (U) Finance Minister John Manley was able to use his 
first budget as a launching pad in his bid to succeed 
Prime Minister Chretien. (Chretien has announced that he 
will step down in February 2004.)  In his speech to 
Parliament, Manley stressed benefits for children, the 
homeless and First Nations (aboriginal) communities, 
saying \"you can\'t have a world of peace unless you 
address the world of need.\"  His speech emphasized 
commitment to making Canada a knowledge economy, and 
expressed the wish that the maple leaf, wherever it is 
seen in the world, will represent hope, compassion and 
determination.  Manley also promised a thorough review of 
government programs and expects to reallocate C$1 billion 
a year to higher priority programs on a continuing basis. 
 
The Lion\'s Share for Health Care: 63% 
-------------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) As indicated in the Speech from the Throne (ref 
A) and called for in the November 2002 Romanow Report, 
health care spending takes the lion\'s share of the 
budget.  Spending is slated to increase by C$34.8 billion 
over the next five years - C$8.96 billion this year alone 
- for 63 percent of total new spending of C$14.3 billion 
this fiscal year.  Defense spending, in contrast, 
receives 0.8% of this year\'s spending, for a total of 
C$1.1 billion. Although the increase in defense spending 
is less than some had hoped, it reverses years of 
significant declines and is a big step in the right 
direction for Canada\'s military.  End Summary. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  As in past years, the GOC 
intentionally leaked many budget proposals.  Financial 
markets had discounted the GOC\'s spending, and the 
Canadian dollar remained stable.  Some analysts contend 
that the markets will ignore this budget because it can 
be viewed as \"just a one-year change in policy\" until the 
end of Chretien\'s tenure.  With the generous spending to 
support the Prime Minister\'s swan song \"wish list,\" 
Finance Minister Manley was able maintain Canada\'s image 
of fiscal prudence only in comparison to the fiscal 
deterioration of the rest of the G7.  End Comment. 
 
Budget Overview:  Risks are from the U.S. 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Economic Assumptions: 
-- 3.2% real GDP growth in 2003 (highest in the G7) 
-- 3.5% real GDP growth in 2004 
-- Risks include uncertain economic recovery in the U.S. 
and geopolitical concerns, especially possible war in 
Iraq. 
 
7. (U) Fiscal Projections: The Sun Will Keep Shining 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
-- Canada is the only G7 country to record a surplus in 
FY2000-2001 (C$15B) and FY2001-2002 (C$8.2B).  The 
Liberal Party is committed to \"balanced budgets or 
beyond\" from this year (FY2002-2003) through FY2004-2005, 
a promise that has traditionally resulted in surpluses. 
 
-- Debt reduction payments of C$47.6 billion in FY2001- 
2002 lowered the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 46.5%, from 
51.8% in the previous year.  (The debt-to-GDP ratio is 
projected to drop to 40% by FY2004-2005.) 
 
-- The GOC\'s Contingency Reserve will remain at $3 
billion, while \"Economic Prudence\" will rise to C$1 
billion in this fiscal year and C$2 billion next fiscal 
year, from zero the past two years.  Note:  Economic 
Prudence is a reserve set aside for unforeseen factors 
that could undermine economic performance, such as global 
political and economic uncertainties.  No funds were 
needed for \"Economic Prudence\" in the previous two fiscal 
years because the Canadian economy performed above 
expectations.  End note. 
 
8. (U) Spending Initiatives: Something For Everyone 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
Total new spending of C$25 billion over three years 
covers most sectors, although some, such as health care, 
have five-year spending commitments or longer. 
 
Health Care and Other Social Spending 
-------------------------------------- 
 
-- The C$34.8 billion committed for increased spending in 
health care over five years includes: 
 
-- A five-year C$16 billion Health Reform Fund for the 
provinces and territories to target primary health care, 
home care and catastrophic drug coverage. 
 
-- A C$9.5 billion increase in cash transfers to the 
provinces and territories over five years. 
 
-- An immediate investment of C$2.5 billion through the 
Canada Health and Social Transfer supplement (with 
details left to the discretion of the respective 
provinces). 
 
-- C$5.5 billion in health reform initiatives, including 
diagnostic/medical equipment and a six-week compassionate 
leave benefit under employment insurance. 
 
-- C$1.3 billion to support First Nations\' health 
programs. 
 
-- C$5.6 billion in social spending for the homeless, 
childcare, and affordable housing. 
 
Defense, Security, Foreign Aid:  Reversing decline 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
-- An increase of C$800 million for Canadian military 
capabilities in each of the next three years. (Note:  in 
his speech, the FinMin said \"every year,\" without 
specifying a time limit.  End note.) 
 
-- C$170 million this fiscal year for urgent capital 
requirements, maintenance of capital equipment, spare 
parts, the purchase of new capital equipment and other 
expenses. 
 
-- C$100 million to support the military commitment in 
Afghanistan (\"Operation Apollo\"). 
 
-- C$75 million in each of the next two years for the 
Security Contingency Reserve, to enable the GOC to 
respond to unforeseen security needs, including border 
security. 
 
--  Nearly C$500 million annually in foreign aid (an 8% 
increase), for a total of C$1.4 billion over the next 
three fiscal years. 
 
Sustainable Development (including Kyoto implementation): 
Still Vague 
---------------------------------------- 
 
The budget allocates C$3 billion to environmental 
initiatives, including: 
 
--   C$2 billion over five years to implement the Kyoto 
Accord; 
 
--   C$1 billion for other environmental measures. 
 
Note:  There are still no details on how the Kyoto 
implementation funds will be spent.  End note 
 
Refining the Tax System 
----------------------- 
Manley prefaced his comments on tax changes by saying 
this budget supports improved corporate governance and 
regulation.  The budget will: 
 
-- Reduce the corporate tax rate to 21% from 28% over the 
next five years while making other changes to the 
corporate tax structure. 
 
-- Reduce the tax on resource income to 21% over five 
years. 
 
-- Raise RRSP and RRP (pension plan) contribution limits 
to C$18,000 over four years, and index the new limits. 
 
-- Eliminate the federal capital tax over the next five 
years, with medium-sized businesses benefiting first. 
(Initially, the capital threshold at which the tax 
applies will be raised from C$10 million to C$50 million 
effective in January 2004.  As of January 2004, medium- 
sized businesses under the C$50 million threshold will no 
longer have to pay the tax.  Second, the rate of the tax 
will be reduced in stages over a period of five years so 
that by 2008, the tax will be completely eliminated.  No 
changes are proposed to the special capital tax on large 
financial institutions.) 
 
-- Reduce the airport security tax from C$24 to C$14 per 
round trip after March 1. 
 
-- Increase the film and video production services tax 
credit from 11% to 16% of qualified Canadian labor 
expenditures.  The GOC will to continue to consult with 
the Canadian film industry to develop criteria for a 
streamlined mechanism for delivering the tax credit, 
which in turn could provide a refundable tax credit of 
25% of qualified labor expenditures for Canadian film or 
video productions. 
 
Other items 
----------- 
-- C$2 billion has been earmarked for \"innovation and 
skills,\" such as research grants and scholarships. 
Manley highlighted in his speech that this year a greater 
proportion of scholarships will support social science 
scholars.  He also stressed the allocation of C$114.5 
million over 5 years to support dual language 
proficiency. 
 
-- C$5.2 billion over six years in farm aid

SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
-------------------- 
 
1. (U) Although Canada\'s energy exports to the United 
States have grown at impressive rates in recent decades, 
making Canada our largest total energy supplier, Canada\'s 
conventional natural gas resources are maturing and 
production from current areas could peak within a decade. 
GOC forecasters expect that Canada\'s exports of natural 
gas will peak in 10-15 years and their share of U.S. 
demand will decline from about 18 percent at the peak, to 
perhaps 13 percent by 2025.  Yet, like other countries, 
both the U.S. and Canada continue to build gas-burning 
infrastructure at high rates.  There is a risk that 
future tight gas supplies and high prices could \"strand\" 
some of this investment (i.e. make it uneconomic before 
the end of its intended lifespan). 
 
2. (SBU) Gas industry observers are increasingly focused 
on what is required in order for yet-to-be-developed 
northern gas resources - in Alaska and in Canada\'s 
northern territories - to take the place of these 
\"maturing\" conventional supplies.  Because Canada is a 
net energy exporter, it is much more willing to accept 
high energy prices, and thus its economic interests with 
respect to northern gas development differ significantly 
from those of the U.S. 
 
3. (SBU) An outcome attractive to key Canadian interests 
would likely entail (1) ensuring that two pipelines 
(Mackenzie Valley and Alaska Highway) are constructed, 
and (2) locating industrial benefits - perhaps a gas- 
liquids separation facility - in Canada.  Observers argue 
that, while such a \"big political deal\" could be 
relatively straightforward and low-risk, only the USG has 
an overwhelming interest in brokering it. 
 
4. (U) This message is based on conversations with 
contacts in Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton and was prepared 
with assistance from Amconsul Calgary. 
END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
 
GAS DEMAND GROWTH CONCENTRATED IN POWER SECTOR 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (U) Recent rapid growth in overall demand for natural 
gas has been driven by this fuel\'s low cost and 
availability, and its low emissions relative to oil and 
coal.  In electric power generation, another important 
factor is at work:  gas-burning plants can be located 
very close to power markets, avoiding the need to 
construct additional power transmission lines, which has 
become very difficult politically (ref C). 
 
6. (U) As a result, ExxonMobil forecasts that while total 
world energy demand will grow at an average 1.8 percent 
annual rate through 2020, gas demand will grow faster - 
2.6 percent overall, and 3.6 percent in the power 
industry.  By ExxonMobil\'s projection, gas will fuel 29 
percent of the world\'s electricity by 2020 (versus 21 
percent today). 
 
CONVENTIONAL GAS SUPPLIES MATURING 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) Most of Canada\'s natural gas production so far has 
come from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) 
(ref B), where conventional production is expected to 
peak in 2008-2013.  Symptoms of this maturation include 
simultaneous high drilling rates and declining new 
discoveries; steeply rising drilling/discovery costs; and 
a withdrawal from gas drilling activity by major energy 
firms. 
 
8. (U) Coal-bed methane and other nonconventional gas 
sources, while they are promising, might not be large 
enough to fully offset the decline in conventional 
production.  It appears unlikely that they will be 
sufficient to cause overall Canadian gas production to 
grow beyond the period 2015-2020 (see figure 5.6 of the 
National Energy Board study, \"Canadian Energy Supply and 
Demand to 2025,\" at neb-one.gc.ca).  As a result, the NEB 
expects Canada\'s natural gas exports to peak in the 
period 2013-2018.  Canadian exports\' share of total U.S. 
gas demand is projected to fall from 18 percent at the 
peak, to 13 percent by 2025. 
 
THE NORTH IS WILD 
----------------- 
 
9. (U) The \"wild card\" in this supply-demand projection 
is the development of gas resources from Alaska and 
northwestern Canada.  Canada\'s northern territories 
(roughly north of 60 degrees latitude) contain 
significant oil and gas resources, notably gas in the 
Beaufort Sea and near the mouth of the Mackenzie River, a 
few hundred miles east of Alaska\'s Prudhoe Bay.  National 
Energy Board (NEB) projections guesstimate that this gas 
will start coming to market in the period 2009-2017, and 
contribute modestly to supply - perhaps 1.5 to 2 billion 
cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) by 2025, on the order of one- 
tenth of Canada\'s total production.  This GOC forecast 
limits itself to Canada, and is silent on Alaskan 
developments.  Also, over longer time periods, 
development could extend to far larger reserves further 
north, in Canada\'s Arctic Islands. 
 
10. (U) IN RECENT DECADES, THE OBSTACLES TO OIL AND GAS 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE TERRITORIES HAVE SHRUNK DUE TO A 
NUMBER OF TRENDS - INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, 
INCREASED DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS AS OPPOSED TO OIL (GAS 
BEING EASIER TO TRANSPORT IN COLD CONDITIONS), PROGRESS 
ON ABORIGINAL LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS, AND GREATER 
RECEPTIVENESS TO RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AMONG ABORIGINAL 
GROUPS (SEE REF D FOR DETAILS).  THE GOC HAS HELD 
REGULAR AUCTIONS OF EXPLORATION RIGHTS IN THE NORTHERN 
TERRITORIES SINCE THE LATE 1990\'S (SEE WEBSITE 
INAC.GC.CA/OIL FOR DETAILS).  NEVERTHELESS, GREAT 
UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE POLITICAL- 
REGULATORY TIME LAG FROM PROPOSAL TO THE START OF 
CONSTRUCTION. 
 
PIPELINE PLANS TO ACCELERATE THIS YEAR 
-------------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) With rising energy prices in 2000-2001 and the 
release of the USG\'s National Energy Policy Report in May 
2001, interest in northern pipeline developments revived. 
Various stakeholder groups formed alliances to promote 
one prospective route or another.  The two most 
frequently suggested options are: 
 
-- A relatively short, flat \"all-Canadian\" line from the 
Mackenzie Delta southward up the river valley and into 
northern Alberta.  (In an ambitious, one-pipeline 
solution known as the \"over the top\" route, the north end 
of this line could conceivably extend westward to Prudhoe 
Bay - but this would greatly expand both the project\'s 
scale, and the political/environmental/aboriginal 
barriers to approval). 
 
-- A more mountainous \"Alaska Highway\" line from Alaska\'s 
North Slope southward to Fairbanks, thence more or less 
along the highway route through the Yukon Territory and 
northern British Columbia to northern Alberta. 
 
12. (U) The stakeholder alliance in support of the \"all- 
Canadian\" Mackenzie Valley line involves the Government 
of the Northwest Territories (NWT), the Aboriginal 
Pipeline Group (APG), and likely either or both of the 
largest pipeline operators -- TransCanada Pipelines 
(transcanada.com) and/or Enbridge (enbridge.com). 
Insiders expect the NEB to receive a formal application 
regarding this line during 2003.  Supporters have lobbied 
the GOC for fiscal incentives, but so far without 
success, as the GOC (like the USG) remains officially 
\"route-neutral.\" 
 
13. (U) Backers of the \"Alaska Highway\" line include the 
Governments of Alaska and the Yukon Territory, as well as 
Foothills Pipelines (foothillspipe.com).  Foothills holds 
permits dating from the 1970\'s (and now of undefined 
value) to build a gas line on this route.  Supporters and 
opponents are intensely interested in the final version 
of forthcoming U.S. energy legislation, since it may 
include various fiscal measures (\"subsidies,\" pricing 
mechanisms, tax credits) which would affect the project\'s 
economics. 
 
A MACKENZIE LINE ALONE WON\'T BE ENOUGH 
-------------------------------------- 
 
14. (U) While the \"Canada-only\" pipeline proposal may seem 
at this point to be moving toward realization, even if it 
were built first, it is not projected to offset either the 
decline in gas production from the WCSB, or the need to 
bring Alaska\'s North Slope gas to market.  A \"Canada-only\" 
line would only deliver perhaps one-third as much gas as a 
line from Alaska.  Moreover, Mackenzie gas is expected to be 
mostly or entirely consumed in Northern Alberta, since gas 
will be the main energy input to the production of crude oil 
from Alberta\'s oil sands.  (This energy-intensive, heat- 
driven process will see immense capital investment over the 
coming decade as conventional oil production declines in 
Western Canada). 
 
15. (SBU) If, as now seems quite possible, the \"Canada-only\" 
line begins construction first, this is considered unlikely 
to make much difference to the economic case for building a 
larger line from Alaska\'s North Slope soon afterward.  On 
the other hand, if an Alaska line were to begin construction 
first, this could well put off the construction of a 
Mackenzie Valley line for at least several years.  For one 
thing, the demand generated by the larger Alaska project 
would drive up prices for already scarce skilled labor, 
pipe, and other inputs; for another, the resulting gas 
supply would undercut the economic case for the smaller 
line. 
 
ALASKA GAS:  U.S. HOLDS THE BIGGEST INTEREST BY FAR 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
16. (U) Obviously, Alaska natural gas development must 
answer many questions and clear many hurdles in order to 
become reality.  How much would it really cost to build? 
What are the environmental consequences?  How can aboriginal 
groups best participate?  Might liquefied natural gas (LNG) 
facilities make more sense as a transportation option? 
 
17. (SBU) But those discussing these questions should be 
cognizant of Canadian factors which are too easily 
underestimated in a \"lower 48\" perspective: 
 
-- If a pipeline (rather than LNG) is to be the means of 
transport, Alaskan gas must cross Canadian territory in 
order to reach major markets.  That territory is at least 
1,500 miles wide and is under four or more jurisdictions. 
 
-- The usual close alignment of national economic interests 
will not necessarily hold in this case.  Indeed, Canadian 
economic and regional interests could work against this 
development - at least, without some major political deal- 
making.  And Canada, as an energy exporter, can tolerate the 
higher natural gas prices that might result if Alaskan gas 
remains undeveloped.  Simply put, an Alaska gas pipeline is 
much more clearly in the U.S. national interest than it is 
in Canada\'s national interest.  This is particularly true as 
a Canada-only Mackenzie Valley pipeline moves toward the 
proposal stage. 
MAKING THE CASE TO CANADIANS 
---------------------------- 
 
18. (SBU) Construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska 
would have positive economic spin-offs in western Canada, 
but Canadians in that region understand well that such 
effects are small and brief, because construction tends to 
employ \"flown-in\" skilled trades and lasts only a few 
seasons.  The key sustained payoff for Canadian interests 
would be in hosting \"gas stripping\" facilities to separate 
liquids from the relatively \"wet\" Alaska gas.  These liquids 
provide inputs for petrochemicals and plastics industries 
that are already established in Alberta, and which the 
provincial government is determined to expand in the long- 
term. 
 
19. (SBU) On the downside, there are two major \"negative 
risks\" for Canadian interests.  First, subsidies or other 
incentives granted to Alaskan gas could take market- 
distorting forms that would be inconsistent with both 
countries\' expressed energy policies.  Second, both 
construction and the resulting gas flows could undercut the 
economics of a Mackenzie Valley pipeline.  Regional and some 
national leaders very much want the latter pipeline for its 
wider regional development effects - including all-season 
roads and stimulus to hydrocarbon and mineral exploration 
(see ref D). 
 
20. (SBU) It bears noting that these concerns could be easy 
for U.S. interests to address.  Alberta (or northeastern 
British Columbia) may well be the most economic location in 
North America for gas-liquids separation, given northern 
Alberta\'s already massive gas processing capacity.  Market- 
distorting subsidies are, after all, not in either country\'s 
true interest.  And as noted above (para. 15), the Mackenzie 
Valley line, which may have a head start anyhow, is not 
expected to change the fundamental economic case for Alaskan 
gas development. 
 
COMMENT:  THE BOTTOM LINE 
------------------------- 
 
21. (SBU) COMMENT:  North America will need to have its 
\"north of sixty\" natural gas developed during the next two 
decades.  We can discern features of a possible low-cost, 
low-risk political bargain that could pave the road to 
developing this gas - by assuring key jurisdictions that 
they will benefit, without imposing gross distortions on 
energy markets. 
 
22.  (SBU)  The USG and GOC are already committed to \"route- 
neutrality\" and in most parties\' opinions - as well as from 
an economic standpoint - they should remain so.  If fiscal 
regimes must be tilted in favor of developments preferred by 
the State of Alaska, it is clearly in the broader U.S. 
national interest (economically and diplomatically) to 
minimize the bias. 
 
23.  (SBU)  Most stakeholders will be satisfied if two 
pipelines - both the Mackenzie Valley (probably first) and 
the Alaska line -- eventually get constructed.  This would 
satisfy top concerns of the sub-federal governments and 
other groups in both the Yukon and Northwest Territories. 
This outcome is also positive for northern Alberta oil-sand 
interests and for the Government of Canada - as well as for 
North America\'s continental energy security.  Finally, a 
\"politically ideal\" compromise would deliver some industrial 
benefits to British Columbia as well as to Alaska and 
Alberta.

1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns over Iran\'s nuclear 
program (reftel), and will continue pushing for a tough 
approach to Tehran by the IAEA.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs 
Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, told us on February 21 
that Canada believes Iran is technically in breach of its 
safeguards agreement.  Wood agreed with virtually all of the 
arguments laid out in reftel, and said that the point about 
Iran being the only affected country failing to declare new 
facilities was particularly useful.  Canadian officials in 
Tehran and in Vienna are closely following El Baradei\'s visit 
to Iran. 
 
2. (C) Wood said that if Iran were to now declare all of its 
facilities, including pilot enrichment experiments, then that 
would be a significant step forward.  But if Iran was serious 
about being taken at its word, he continued, it would have 
come forward long ago to address international concerns. 
Wood said that the IAEA safeguards operation division that 
covers Iran is also responsible for Canada, and that this 
division is well informed on what Iran is doing.  He observed 
that El Baradei was trying to do whatever he could to get 
Iran to come clean, even suggesting that Iran report 
undeclared material to the IAEA Board as a minor 
irregularity. 
 
3. (C) Wood assured us that Canada will take every 
opportunity to press Iran on this issue, both bilaterally and 
multilaterally.  He noted that Iran is closely following the 
IAEA\'s approach to North Korea, and that Canada had Iran in 
mind, too, as it pushed for IAEA action on the DPRK.

SUBJECT: CANADA SEARCHING FOR PARTNERS FOR ISAF IV AND V 
 
REF: OTTAWA 435 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Since Defense Minister McCallum\'s February 12 
announcement that Canada would contribute a battalion and 
brigade headquarters to ISAF IV and V (reftel), the GoC has 
been busy seeking potential partners.  The GoC has stressed 
that it does not have the resources to lead ISAF alone, and 
it hopes to get confirmation in the next few weeks that 
Germany will help lead ISAF IV.  For ISAF V, Canada is 
looking at either Italy or Spain.  McCallum has spoken with 
Italian Defense Minister Martino, and will be lobbying him 
again during a June visit to Ottawa.  Canadian officials tell 
us that while Spain\'s Parliament had decided not to 
participate, during the Munich meetings German Defense 
Minister Struck got his Spanish counterpart Trillo to agree 
to take another look. 
 
2. (C) Canada wants quickly to begin negotiations on a 
Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. military on support 
for this mission, and is pushing for NATO support as well. 
McCallum has said NATO participation is needed to help ensure 
ISAF continuity.  Meanwhile, there continue to be misgivings 
in the Canadian Forces about their ISAF contribution because 
of its size and duration.  MGEN Cam Ross, Department of 
National Defense (DND) Director General for International 
Security Policy, resigned (effective in June) after the ISAF 
announcement to protest what he saw as an over-commitment of 
Canadian troops.  Ironically, Ross is leading a DND team that 
is visiting Italy, Spain, and possibly Germany and NATO this 
week to discuss ISAF force structure.  While Canada needs 
another major partner for ISAF IV and V, DND also wants to 
ensure that it has an appropriate tactical and leadership 
role. 
 
3. (C) To complement Canada\'s military contribution to ISAF, 
Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) is pushing to open a diplomatic 
mission in Kabul.  Cabinet has approved the concept of such a 
mission, but DFAIT is now in a battle with the Treasury Board 
over funding.  DFAIT currently covers Afghanistan from its 
Embassy in Islamabad. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: Critics of the GoC\'s ISAF commitment point to 
the fact that Canada was unable to replace a battalion that 
it pulled out of Afghanistan (where it was part of Operation 
Enduring Freedom) after a 6-month stint last year.  While DND 
did better than expected in the GoC budget announced earlier 
this month - an increase of 7%, or $530 million, plus $215 
million additional for contingency operations - a 12-month 
commitment to ISAF will be a major drain on the Canadian 
Forces.  Canada will need all the help it can get from Allies 
and, ideally, from NATO itself.

1.   SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION:  The dominant position of 
Canadian energy production and trade for the United States 
is reinforced by preliminary 2002 data.  The statistics from 
Canada\'s National Energy Board, Natural Resources Canada, 
and the U.S. Energy Information Administration show: 
. 
-- Canada exported an estimated 1.58 million barrels per 
day of crude oil to the United States during 2002 - a new 
record, up 4 percent over 2001.  (Canada is the United 
States\' top petroleum supplier and largest foreign 
supplier of total energy). 
 
-- As Canadian production shifts toward frontier sources, 
the share of heavy/synthetic crude continues to grow and 
now accounts for 62 percent of Canada\'s crude exports. 
 
-- Canadian oil reserves continue to grow.  Proven 
conventional reserves grew by about 3.1 percent in 2001, 
faster than North American demand.  This does not include 
frontier reserves such as oilsands and offshore 
resources. 
 
-- Canada\'s oil sands contain 1.7 to 2.5 trillion barrels 
of oil.  Of this, at least 170 to 300 billion barrels are 
commercially recoverable with current technology at any 
world oil price over US$20 per barrel. 
 
-- Canada also supplies the vast majority of the United 
States\' imports of natural gas.  Despite the U.S. 
economic slowdown, Canada\'s gas exports held level in 
2002, after growing by over 30 percent in the previous 
five years. 
 
END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
2.   The United States and Canada have not only the world\'s 
largest economic relationship, but also its largest energy 
relationship.  Canada exported about US$30 billion worth of 
energy to the United States in 2002 - about 8 percent of 
Canada\'s exports to the U.S. (other major categories of 
which are vehicles and parts, machinery, and forest 
products). 
 
3.   About 96 percent of Canada\'s energy exports are 
destined for the United States.  U.S.-Canada energy trade 
has held steady through the recent U.S. slowdown, hanging on 
to rapid gains made in the 1990\'s (even though overall 
bilateral trade went through an unusual shrinkage of roughly 
ten percent in 2000-2002). 
 
4.   OIL:  Canada exports about 1.5 million barrels per day 
of crude oil to the United States, plus another 0.4 MMB/D in 
gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and related products.  This 
provides about 17 percent of U.S. oil imports and nearly 10 
percent of total U.S. oil demand.  Canada\'s oil exports to 
the U.S. grew about 4 percent last year, and have increased 
29.6 percent over the past five years (2002 over 1997).  Oil 
sands production and exports are expected to reach one 
million barrels per day by the end of 2003. 
 
5.   NATURAL GAS:  Canada exported 106 billion cubic meters 
of gas to the U.S. last year - about 18 percent of U.S. gas 
demand.  These exports held steady from 2001, having risen 
more than 30 percent from 1996-2001.  Sustaining this growth 
requires joint efforts to facilitate the development of 
Arctic resources (see ref B for analysis). 
 
6.   ELECTRICITY:  Canada exported about 35 terawatt-hours 
of electric power to the United States in 2002.  This total 
was down from 2001, but net exports remain more than 20 TWH 
per year because U.S. power flows to Canada were also down 
(to about 14 TWH).  Canada\'s total electricity exports 
peaked in 2000 and are now on a declining trend, due to a 
lack of capital investment in both the U.S. and Canadian 
electric power industries and the difficulty of building new 
transmission capacity (see ref C for analysis). 
 
7.   URANIUM:  Canada has 15 percent of the world\'s known 
recoverable uranium, but accounts for over 30 percent of 
world production. 
 
8.   SOURCES:  For more information on Canada\'s energy 
production and exports, see websites of Canada\'s National 
Energy Board (neb-one.gc.ca), Natural Resources Canada

SUBJECT: CANADA - 2002 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 22225 
 
The following is Mission Canada\'s submission for the 
2002-2003 Trafficking in Persons report. Answers are keyed to 
numbered paragraphs in reftel. Embassy POC is PolOff Craig 
Bryant, telephone (613) 688-5339, fax (613) 688-3098. 
 
Paragraph 16.  Overview of A Country\'s Activities to 
Eliminate Trafficking in Persons: 
 
--A.  Canada is a country of transit, destination and origin 
for the trafficking of men, women, and children. As a 
destination country, trafficking of persons who have arrived 
from other countries occurs within Canada\'s borders. Domestic 
trafficking of Canadian citizens or legal residents does not 
take place in significant numbers, but there have been cases 
of Canadian citizen minors trafficked to other parts of 
Canada (particularly urban centers such as Toronto, Montreal, 
and Vancouver) and to cities in the United States for 
exploitation in the sex trade. Trafficking does not occur in 
territory outside of the government\'s control. 
 
Reliable numbers showing the extent of Canada\'s trafficking 
problem are not available. A November 2000 University of 
Toronto research paper published by Status of Women Canada 
(SWC), a government agency, estimated that 8,000 to 16,000 
persons entered Canada each year as the result of 
trafficking, either to remain in Canada or in transit to the 
United States. Government and NGO sources have indicated this 
figure is no longer a reliable estimate, and that there is 
simply no hard data available on the number of persons 
trafficked in Canada. A January 2000 Government of Canada 
report on trafficking in women stated that information on 
trafficking in Canada is limited, and that satisfying data 
collection requirements presents a major challenge for the 
government. 
 
Sources of available information range widely, including 
police reports, social workers, NGO\'s, research documents, 
federal agencies, press reports, hospital data, and more. 
Reliability of these sources also varies widely. Women seem 
to be trafficked more commonly than any other group, though 
children are sometimes trafficked for work in the sex or drug 
trades. Men are trafficked as indentured labor, but 
apparently not in significant numbers. The most frequently 
trafficked persons are from countries in eastern and southern 
Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America. 
 
--B.  Trafficked persons most often come from East 
(especially China) and Southeast Asia (including Thailand, 
Cambodia, the Philippines) and eastern Europe (including 
Russia). Persons trafficked into Canada who do not remain 
here are most often trafficked to the United States. 
 
--C.  There does not appear to have been any change in the 
direction or extent of trafficking. 
 
--D.  There are no surveys planned or underway to document 
the extent and nature of trafficking in Canada. SWC published 
three reports in 2000 on different aspects of trafficking in 
Canada. After a new anti-trafficking law took effect in June 
2002, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began gathering 
information on a nation-wide basis on human trafficking 
activity. 
 
--E.  Conditions for trafficked persons are difficult.  Many 
trafficking victims are forced by violence or intimidation 
into the sex trade, including some who are initially tricked 
into it. Forced labor outside of the sex trade is less 
common, though it does exist in slaughterhouses, sweatshops, 
farms, restaurants, and factories. Information on such forced 
labor is scarce. Persons trafficked into indentured or forced 
labor are subject to violence, threats, or intimidation to 
themselves, or to family members remaining in their countries 
of origin. Victims often have their passports or other 
identification documents confiscated by traffickers, which 
further restricts their ability to flee their oppressors. 
Victims have limited access to government assistance for a 
number of reasons: they may not speak English or French, they 
fear being jailed or deported, they are ashamed, or they are 
unaware assistance is available to them. 
 
--F.  Canada is not a country of origin for significant 
numbers of trafficked persons. Of those Canadian citizens or 
legal residents who are trafficked, minors (mostly runaways 
or otherwise troubled youth) and aboriginal persons seem to 
be the main groups targeted. 
 
--G.  There is political will at the highest levels of the 
Canadian government to combat trafficking in persons.  The 
government is making a good faith effort to address 
trafficking, as demonstrated by a new law that went into 
effect in 2002 making trafficking in persons illegal. 
Funding for social services was increased in the GOC\'s most 
recent budget. The GOC is devoting increased resources 
(personnel, funding, and focus) in areas such as border 
control and immigration that should have an impact on 
trafficking in persons. 
 
--H.  Governmental authorities or individual government 
employees do not facilitate, condone, and are not otherwise 
complicit in trafficking in persons. 
 
--I.  Funding for law enforcement has increased overall at 
the federal level, but trafficking in persons is not a law 
enforcement priority. Official corruption is not a problem. 
Government aid to victims has been limited due to a general 
lack of awareness of the existence or extent of trafficking, 
and lack of a specific anti-trafficking program. The 
principal factor hampering efforts to combat human 
trafficking is that it has not been a highly visible problem 
in Canada. Another factor hampering anti-trafficking efforts 
is that Canada\'s law enforcement jurisdiction is fragmented, 
involving various levels of governments and numerous 
departments and agencies. Federal law enforcement authorities 
cannot claim authority over provincial cases. Finally, 
Canada\'s strong tradition of respect for the rights and 
liberties of all persons, including non-citizens, limits the 
means (such as investigative detention) that law enforcement 
authorities might otherwise employ in trafficking 
investigations. 
 
Paragraph 17.  Prevention: 
 
--A.  The government acknowledges that trafficking is a 
problem. 
 
--B.  Status of Women Canada (SWC), Citizenship and 
Immigration Canada (CIC), Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT), Human Resources Development 
Canada (HRDC), Justice Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP), and the Solicitor General Canada are the 
federal agencies involved in anti-trafficking efforts. 
Provincial and local law enforcement authorities, such as the 
Montreal Police Department and Toronto Police Department, are 
also involved. 
 
--C.  There are no current and there have been no previous 
anti-trafficking information or education campaigns, but the 
government has supported efforts by NGO\'s and community 
organizations to raise awareness of trafficking and has 
funded academic studies of the problem. A variety of 
organizations, including Canadian universities, serve as 
resource centers for trafficking information. The Center for 
Refugee Studies at York University in Toronto began research 
on global trafficking in women in 1998, and is currently 
working on a study of developed country \"markets\" for 
trafficked persons, with an emphasis on North America. 
 
--D.  Canada is a western, prosperous democratic country that 
strongly promotes women\'s participation in economic and 
political decision-making, as well as efforts to keep 
children in school. 
 
--E.  The GOC has implemented programs aimed directly or 
indirectly at preventing trafficking into Canada. For 
example, CIC deploys immigration control officers at 
strategic transit points throughout the world to deter the 
illicit transit of migrants to Canada. Canada recently 
adapted a \"one person, one passport\" policy, which, it 
believes, will help deter trafficking in children. Under 
Canada\'s previous policy, children could be included in the 
passports of adults and a photograph of the child was not 
required. Under the new policy all Canadian passports must 
include a photo of the holder, and children must have their 
own passports. The GOC also seeks to stop the spread of 
trafficking in developing countries by funding initiatives 
proposed by the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA - equivalent to the U.S. Agency for International 
Development). (See 17-I below) 
--F. The GOC supports NGO\'s, and other organizations and 
elements of civil society concerned with the issue of 
trafficking, by funding research projects and sponsoring 
conferences. SWC supports community-based action to address 
trafficking by providing funding for educational forums. 
 
--G. The government adequately monitors the borders, but 
Canada is a large country with thousands of miles of 
coastline, and therefore surreptitious entry by migrants is 
difficult to prevent. There were two instances in recent 
years when boats were discovered trying to smuggle trafficked 
persons from China into British Columbia. The movements of 
known immigrants into Canada are monitored by CIC through a 
databank. 
--H. The GOC set up an interagency working group in 1998 
initially for the purpose of consulting on the UN Convention 
on Transnational Organized Crime and related protocols (the 
Convention and two related protocols were ratified by Canada 
on May 14, 2002). This interagency  group has now turned to 
some of the domestic issues and challenges in respect to 
trafficking in persons.  The International Crime and 
Terrorism Division in DIFAIT\'s Global Affairs Bureau leads 
this group. Other agencies represented are SWC, CIC, DFAIT, 
HRDC, Justice Canada, the RCMP, and Solicitor General Canada. 
(See above, Paragraph 17-B.) The group assists in 
coordinating national efforts to combat trafficking in 
persons. 
 
The federal government does not have a national 
anti-trafficking or public corruption task force. There have 
been several joint task forces of federal, provincial, and 
local authorities that have focused on trafficking rings in 
specific areas for a limited period of time. For example, 
Operation Trade in Toronto was a massive, multi-police force 
investigation of traffickers who had purchased young women in 
Thailand, transported them to Toronto, and forced them to 
work as sex slaves. In Montreal, the police force recently 
established a task force which focuses, in part, on the 
growing problem of juveniles being coerced into the sex 
trade. 
 
--I. CIDA is providing funding for programs which seek to 
stop the sexual and labor exploitation of children in 
developing countries, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Benin 
in Africa; Nicaragua and Peru in Latin America; and Haiti in 
the Caribbean. Through the South East Asian Fund for 
Institutional and Legal Development (SEAFILD), CIDA is 
supporting the Illegal Labour Movements: Trafficking in Women 
and Children project addressing trafficking in the Mekong 
delta area. SEAFILD also funds the Support for the 
Development of Protocols for Repatriation of Trafficked Women 
and Children Project, by the Coalition to Fight Against Child 
Exploitation (FACE) in Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. 
 
Other federal agencies provide funding to international 
organizations to assist in combating trafficking. CIC, for 
example, has provided funding to the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) to assist in a case study on 
migrant trafficking originating in Nicaragua. DIFAIT\'s Human 
Security Program recently made a grant of C$200,000 to a 
Latin American NGO, Casa Alianza, and IOM for assistance to 
Honduran street children at risk of falling victim to human 
traffickers. A portion of this grant will be used for the 
voluntary repatriation to Honduras of approximately 100 
juveniles who had been transported to Canada by drug 
trafficking gangs and forced to work as street dealers. 
 
--J.  Canada does not have a national action plan to address 
trafficking in persons. 
 
--K.  The interagency working group on trafficking (see 17-H) 
is responsible for developing government anti-trafficking 
programs. 
 
Paragraph 18. Investigation and Prosecution of Traffickers: 
--A.  The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Bill C-11) 
was passed by Parliament and signed into law by the Governor 
General in 2001. The Act entered into force June 11, 2002, 
when regulations to implement the Act were finalized. 
While there have been no prosecutions under C-11 to date, the 
significance of the bill is that, for the first time, a law 
is in place in Canada specifically prohibiting and punishing 
trafficking in persons.  In Part 3, under the main heading 
Enforcement, Paragraphs 118 and 119 state: 
 
      118.  (1) No person shall knowingly organize the coming 
into Canada of one or more persons by means of abduction, 
fraud, deception or use or threat of force or coercion. 
      118.  (2) For the purpose of subsection  (1), 
\"organize\", with respect to persons, includes their 
recruitment or transportation and, after their entry into 
Canada, the receipt or harbouring of those persons. 
      119.   A person shall not disembark a person or group 
of persons at sea for the purpose of inducing, aiding or 
abetting them to come into Canada in contravention of this 
Act. 
 
--B.  The potential penalties for trafficking in persons are 
set out in Paragraphs 120 and 121 of the Act.  They state: 
 
      120.  A person who contravenes section 118 or 119 is 
guilty of an offence and liable on conviction by way of 
indictment to a fine of not more than $1,000,000 or to life 
imprisonment, or to both. 
      121. (1) The court in determining the penalty to be 
imposed under subsection 117 (2) or (3) or section 120, shall 
take into account whether (a) grievous bodily harm or death 
occurred during the commission of the offence; (b) the 
commission of the offence was for the benefit of, at the 
direction of or in association with a criminal organization; 
(c) the commission of the offence was for profit, whether or 
not any profit was realized; and (d) a person was subjected 
to humiliating or degrading treatment, including with respect 
to work or health conditions or sexual exploitation as a 
result of the commission of the offence. 
 
--C.  The penalty for sexual assault is up to 10 years 
imprisonment. The penalty for sexual assault using a weapon, 
threats against a third person, or when bodily harm results 
is up to 14 years imprisonment. The penalty for aggravated 
sexual assault is up to life imprisonment. 
 
--D.  No cases have been prosecuted under the new 
anti-trafficking provisions in the short period since they 
took effect. The government has prosecuted and even convicted 
a few human traffickers and smugglers for related offenses, 
but penalties imposed have been minimal. For example, in a 
Toronto prosecution brought as part of the Operation Trade 
investigation, a judge sentenced the person described as the 
mastermind of a sex slave operation to less than two years of 
house arrest. This situation is likely to change as law 
enforcement officers and prosecutors become more 
knowledgeable about investigating and prosecuting cases under 
the new anti-trafficking law. 
 
--E.  Reports show that traffickers operate at all levels - 
as freelancers, in small crime groups, and as part of large 
international organized crime syndicates. Marriage brokers 
sometimes serve as a front for traffickers.  Government 
officials are not involved in trafficking. 
 
--F.  The government actively uses modern anti-crime methods 
to investigate cases of trafficking, but until now there has 
not been a sustained focus on preventing or prosecuting 
trafficking in persons. After the new anti-trafficking law 
took effect, the RCMP began collecting and analyzing data on 
trafficking on a nation-wide basis. 
 
--G.  In the past the government has not provided specialized 
training for government officials in the investigation and 
prosecution of trafficking, but with the implementation of 
the new anti-trafficking law it now plans to provide such 
training. 
 
--H.  The GOC cooperates with other governments in 
investigating and prosecuting trafficking, though on an ad 
hoc basis.  Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities 
have cooperated on cases in the past, including a 1998 
investigation into smuggling from China through Toronto and 
on to New York City that resulted in the arrest of 11 people 
in Canada and 30 in the U.S. 
 
--I.  The GOC has rarely (if ever) extradited human 
traffickers to other countries because Canada did not have a 
law against trafficking in humans. With the implementation of 
the new anti-trafficking law, Canada will be better able to 
extradite traffickers. 
 
--J.  There is no evidence of government involvement in or 
tolerance of trafficking at any level. 
 
--K.  N/A 
 
--L.  Canada ratified ILO Convention 182 in 2000. Canada 
signed the Sale of Children Protocol supplementing the Rights 
of the Child Convention in 2001. In 2002, Canada ratified the 
Convention on Transnational Organized Crime, as well as the 
Optional Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish 
Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children; and 
the Optional Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by 
Land, Sea, and Air. 
 
Paragraph 19.  Protection and Assistance to Victims: 
 
--A.  There are a number of programs and services in Canada 
that can assist trafficking victims, even though they are not 
specifically aimed at such victims. These include health 
care, legal service, and other social services. Trafficking 
victims are eligible to apply for permanent residence status 
in Canada under humanitarian/compassionate provisions of 
Canadian immigration law. In addition, trafficking victims 
can make claims for Convention refugee status. The Canadian 
Immigration and Refugee Board introduced Gender-Related 
Persecution Guidelines in 1993 that may be relevant to some 
trafficking cases. The new Immigration Act (Bill C-11) states 
that the best interests of the child may be considered in the 
context of applications for permanent residence on 
humanitarian and compassionate grounds and certain decisions 
taken by the Immigration Appeals Division. 
 
--B.  The federal government does not provide funding or 
other support to NGO\'s for service to victims. Services and 
assistance for crime victims are normally a provincial 
matter. Victims of trafficking are eligible to apply for 
assistance from victims\' assistance funds maintained by the 
provincial governments. Many victims are eligible for refugee 
status, but this presents a problem because traffickers are 
aware of and can exploit this fact. 
 
--C.  Victims of trafficking may be detained, fined and 
deported. This is a source of frustration for federal and 
provincial authorities who need to obtain the assistance of 
victims in prosecuting traffickers. Many police and 
immigration officers view foreign prostitutes brought into 
Canada by traffickers as illegal immigrants and petty 
criminals, and not as victims. This attitude is slowly 
beginning to change, but will require more training and 
education. 
 
--D.  The government sometimes encourages victims to assist 
in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking, but this 
is a difficult task. Victims often come from countries where 
the police are corrupt and dangerous and may even be part of 
the trafficking network. In addition, victims may not speak 
English or French or understand their rights or what the 
police want from them. Victims are therefore often reluctant 
to cooperate with the police in a prosecution. 
 
A victim who is a material witness against a trafficker is 
permitted to obtain a humanitarian and compassionate visa to 
remain in Canada, which would entitle him or her to work. 
Under Canada\'s Criminal Code and victims\' compensation 
programs at different jurisdictional levels, victims of 
trafficking can obtain damages for injuries suffered. In 
addition, the provincial governments of Alberta and Ontario 
recently enacted legislation giving those provinces the power 
to sue pimps and other sexual exploiters of children in order 
to recover the cost of treating their victims. 
 
--E. Protection for trafficking victims is available, though 
it is a new concept. Such protection is needed, as motorcycle 
gangs and organized crime groups that frequently resort to 
violence and intimidation are heavily involved in human 
trafficking. Many law enforcement officers do not view 
foreign prostitutes or illegal workers as victims of 
traffickers, and do not understand that these persons often 
require additional protection from organized crime. 
 
--F.  Government officials do not receive specialized 
training for providing assistance to victims of trafficking. 
 
--G.  As there are few if any Canadian victims of trafficking 
repatriated to Canada, there is no government program to 
provide assistance to such persons. 
 
--H.  The following NGO\'s work with trafficking victims in 
Canada: 
- The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (Vancouver, BC) 
- The Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women (Victoria, 
BC) 
- Philippine Women Center (Vancouver, BC)

     C. C) STATE 44188 
 
 1.  (SBU)  On February 28 Finoff touched base with Canada\'s 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) for an update on GOC 
action with regard to proposals on Asia Pulp and Paper 
restructuring.  The joint letter to President Megawati to be 
drafted by the Canadian Embassy in Jakarta (ref A) has been 
cleared in Ottawa and is being circulated among the 
participating embassys in Jakarta.  The GOC hopes to have the 
clearance process completed by early next week, but 
understands there are likely to be changes to the text. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The possibility of calling in Indonesia\'s 
ambassador to Ottawa to protest handling of the case is under 
consideration, but a final decision has not been made. 
According to DFAIT, the GOC \"might go that route.\" 
 
3.  (SBU)  The Export Development Corporation, Canada\'s ECA, 
said that they are \"not that strongly contemplating\" a firm 
decision to take private corporations off cover and are not 
planning to put anything in writing.  He added that he 
believes, speaking generally, that most ECAs are reluctant to 
draw a line in the sand that continues for an indefinite 
period.  \"Actions speak,\" and they are not thinking of doing 
anything publicly.  EDC believes the next step is the letter 
to President Megawati, and they\'ll see what happens after 
that. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Comment: Today\'s conversations in Ottawa confirm 
the view (Ref B) that GOC action and decision making on this 
issue are driven by the Canadian Embassy in Jakarta.  EDC 
does not have a presence in Jakarta and DFAIT appears to be 
relying on the Ambassador\'s judgment.  EDC, which operates as 
a private company, showed the hesitation about discussing 
proprietary matters that would be expected of a banker 
talking about a client. There seems to be a strong 
inclination on the part of the GOC to await the response to 
the joint letter to Megawati before moving on to other steps. 
 End comment.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN VIEWS ON WSSD IMPLEMENTATION AND CSD 
REFORM 
 
REF: STATE 41673 
 
1. As requested in reftel, EST Counselor provided U.S. 
discussion papers, talking points and Q and A paper to the 
Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) and to the GOC coordinating committee on WSSD 
implementation.  Returning from an extended absence, our 
main interlocutor in the GOC, Gary Pringle (DFAIT), told EST 
Counselor that Canada is generally supportive of the 
approach to CSD reform being proposed by the U.S.  He found 
the Q and A paper particularly helpful in presenting the 
case for some of the reform measures being proposed. 
However, he indicated that the GOC is now focused on the CSD 
Secretariat\'s paper of February 14 and would be interested 
 
SIPDIS 
in USG comments on that paper. 
 
2. Pringle said the GOC would like to see future sessions of 
the CSD address topics on the basis of \"WEHAB Plus,\" which 
he described as perhaps two topics pre-selected from the 
WEHAB agenda and one topic selected from among other 
competing areas of interest to CSD participants.  He noted 
in particular that Canada thought the topics of \"sustainable 
cities\" and \"information technology\" should be on future CSD 
agendas for consideration, even though they were not 
contained in the WEHAB formulation. 
 
3. Furthermore, Canada plans to propose that a review be 
built into the revised CSD agenda after the first cycle (two 
years).  This would allow participants to evaluate the 
effectiveness of changes adopted and to make whatever 
adjustments, large or small, may be called for.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN POLITICAL DIRECTOR ON IRAQ 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Foreign Affairs Political Director Jim Wright 
told us that the Canadian proposal at the UNSC is not an 
attempt to mediate, but a set of ideas that might help the 
Council focus again on disarmament rather than on internal 
divisions.  Wright appealed for USG public statements to keep 
the focus on Iraqi disarmament rather than on regime change. 
As for a potential Canadian contribution to a military 
campaign against Iraq, Wright said the Canadian policy 
remains unchanged - yes if action is endorsed by the Security 
Council, \"to be determined\" if not.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Political Minister Counselor and PolMilOff met with 
Foreign Affairs Political Director Jim Wright on March 3 to 
discuss Iraq.  Wright was defensive about the Canadian 
non-paper at the UNSC on \"Bridging the Divide.\"  He confirmed 
that Canadian PermRep Heinbecker would be meeting that 
afternoon with the 10 non-permanent members of the UNSC 
(E-10), who had asked for an explanation of Canada\'s ideas. 
Wright said this meeting was completely at the E-10\'s 
initiative, and that Heinbecker would be in receive mode. 
The E-10, Wright continued, are frustrated that the P-5 are 
unwilling to budge from their positions and are putting the 
onus on the E-10. 
 
3. (C) Wright said that PM Chretien has been in contact with 
Presidents Fox of Mexico (whom he visited last week) and 
Lagos of Chile, both of whom are \"intrigued\" by the Canadian 
ideas.  He noted that popular opinion was overwhelmingly 
against war in both Mexico and Chile.   Wright said that he 
and other GoC officials have also been in frequent contact 
with France/Germany/Russia about their proposal, and have 
told them it is a non-starter because of being open-ended. 
Wright underscored that the Canadian position is very 
different, as expressed by Heinbecker in his remarks to the 
recent UNSC open meeting.  Canada wants the Security Council 
to consider the full range of options, but the Council needs 
to act quickly. 
 
4. (C) Wright also raised the February 28 White House 
statement that U.S. goals in Iraq included both disarmament 
and regime change.  He noted that Prime Minister Chretien, 
speaking in Mexico City immediately after the White House 
statement, had been asked by a reporter about regime change 
being a U.S. goal in Iraq.  Chretien responded that this was 
a dangerous concept, and that \"if you start changing regimes, 
where do you stop?\"  Wright said that Chretien had been put 
in an awkward position, but that talk of regime change would 
not be helpful in the Security Council, and urged us to keep 
the focus on disarmament.  Wright praised a speech by 
Ambassador Cellucci and an interview with Deputy Secretary 
Armitage, both televised by the CBC on February 28, as 
hitting all the right notes on Iraq. 
 
5. (C) On Canadian military participation in Iraq, Wright 
said the GoC position has been consistent throughout.  Canada 
has supported U.S. efforts to bring pressure to bear on Iraq, 
but it also wants the UNSC to live up to its unique 
responsibilities.  For Canada to now say that it would 
participate militarily, on the eve of a potential UN 
decision, would be very odd.  Wright urged us to be patient, 
and said that the GoC would quickly make its decision once 
the Council has acted. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: The GoC is relishing its chance to encourage 
consensus at the UNSC, however unlikely that might be. 
Canada has heard our message, from President Bush on down, 
that its proposal is too little, too late.  But 
multilateralism is an article of faith in Ottawa, and the GoC 
believes it is defending the authority of the United Nations. 
 So long as Security Council members are willing to listen, 
Canada will continue trying to \"bridge the divide.\"

1.   \"No really, it could work\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Though counterintuitive, Bush\'s 
warpath might lead to Mideast peace,\" columnist Marcus 
Gee commented in the leading Globe and Mail (2/28): 
\"...As Mr. Bush sees it, solving the Arab-Israeli 
dispute would remove one of the grievances that helps 
fuel anti-Americanism and complicates the fight against 
terrorism. The American desire for peace 
springs from the strongest motive: self-interest. So 
after the United States goes to war, it will turn once 
again to the harder job of peace.\" 
 
2.   \"U.S. serious about democracy in Mideast\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee wrote in the leading Globe and 
Mail (2/27): \"...Whatever Washington\'s critics may say, 
there is no way that the United States is going to 
replace Saddam Hussein with a friendly thug and get 
out. Idealistic? Dangerous? Perhaps. There is always 
the danger that Muslims would see the attempt to build 
democracy in Iraq as an imperial enterprise, setting 
off a backlash that would make anti-Americanism worse, 
not better.\" 
 
3. \"George W. Bush, the engineer\" 
Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(2/28): \"George W. Bush redrew the map of the Middle- 
East and undertook some spectacular political 
engineering work on Wednesday.... Everything is 
coherent with what could be called the Wolfowitz 
doctrine...the U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary and a high 
level strategist who considers it the West\'s duty to 
spread its values of liberty and democracy. But we have 
said it before: imposing democracy by force is not a 
good idea.... Moreover, one cannot imagine a worst 
guide than America to show the way especially in this 
region where, rightly or wrongly, the U.S. is 
thoroughly detested. The fact that the Bush 
administration fails to see these pitfalls leaves us 
speechless.\"

1.   \"Only George Bush could make Chirac look like a 
dove\" 
Columnist Paul Knox commented in the leading Globe and 
Mail (2/26): \"...Mr. Bush has managed to drive the 
deepest wedge in half a century between the 
United States and Europe over an issue tangential to 
counterterrorism, which is the central challenge of his 
presidency. Every time his pal Tony Blair 
digs himself out of a public-opinion hole, Mr. Bush 
pushes him back in with another dose of illogic and 
mendacity. The U.S. President has single-handedly 
resuscitated the global antiwar movement - no mean feat 
in a post-9/11 world. And he\'s accomplished something 
Bill Clinton could only dream of: He\'s actually made 
people feel good about being liberals once again. That, 
of course, is not such a bad thing. But there is a 
great tragedy about Mr. Bush\'s meltdown in the arena of 
international public opinion. His obsession with 
military action has made it easy for others to avoid 
addressing the plight of civilians in Iraq, and their 
claim on a brighter future.... The humanitarian plight 
of Iraqis has been trotted out 
so belatedly by Mr. Bush and his allies that it lacks 
all credibility as a pretext for war. In any case, 
their overwhelming focus continues to be WMD.... If the 
current crisis is defused, there is no reason why the 
focus of United Nations involvement can\'t be broadened 
from weapons of mass destruction to include a mechanism 
to address the civil, political, social 
and economic rights of Iraqis. Those who would be 
peacemongers should make that their overriding goal.\" 
 
2.   Saddam\'s Missiles 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (2/26): \"If not for the interview granted by 
Saddam Hussein to Dan Rather, the chances the memo 
written by Paris and Berlin - and endorsed by Moscow 
and Beijing - had of being adopted by the Security 
Council would have been much greater. But Saddam caught 
everybody by surprise and gave the Bush-Blair 
duo...everything it wanted, namely a reason to send 
armies to Baghdad. Indeed, Saddam\'s clear refusal 
during this interview not to destroy the missiles 
constitutes the motive the war side was waiting for.... 
If Hussein sticks to his guns, it is likely neither 
Bush nor Blair will be forced to demand a vote at the 
Security Council on their new resolution. More exactly, 
if Hussein decides to keep arms prohibited by the UN, 
he will reduce to ashes the position defended by 
Germany, France, China and Russia.\" 
 
NAM 
3.   \"No friends, only enemies\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Paranoid North Koreans shun 
even sympathetic leaders,\" columnist Jonathan Manthorpe 
observed in the conservative tabloid 
Vancouver Sun (2/26): \"...The efforts of the NAM summit 
have been models of moderation beside the sometimes 
charged language in the meeting hall. NAM members 
include the three countries of Bush\'s axis of evil as 
well as five temporary members of the 15-member UN 
Security Council that will soon turn thumbs up or down 
on military action against Iraq. Their resolution on 
Iraq, for example, supports the disarming of Saddam 
Hussein\'s regime, but only by 
the UN and not by the U.S. acting independently with 
allies. The resolution does not preclude military 
action under a UN mandate if all else fails.... 
NAM delegates wanted to take a similar stance over 
North Korea. A draft resolution negotiated in corridors 
and back-rooms over the past few days 
would have called on Pyongyang to reverse its decision 
late last year to withdraw from the nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty.... The problem for everyone - 
North Korea\'s neighbours at least as much as the U.S. - 
is that Pyongyang does have weapons of mass destruction 
and a highly competent and motivated million-man army. 
Saddam, in contrast, probably has only the remnants of 
his dreams to acquire a mass killing machine. Erratic 
North Korea is such a dangerous proposition it has to 
be handled delicately while Iraq does not.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"A volley of propaganda\" 
Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis wrote in the 
conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/3): \"...[W]hat I 
dislike even more than Saddam\'s nasty regime are 
government lies and propaganda. Since 9/11, Americans 
have been subjected to the most intense propaganda 
campaign from their government since World War I. Much 
of the mainstream U.S. media have been intimidated 
by the Bush administration into unquestioningly 
amplifying its party line. Or, in the worst tradition 
of yellow, jingoist journalism, they act as 
cheerleaders for war.... The American public, often 
wobbly about geography, history and international 
affairs, has been alternatively terrified and enraged 
by bare-faced lies that Iraq was about to attack 
America with nuclear weapons or germs, and was a secret 
ally of al-Qaida. A shocking two-thirds of Americans 
mistakenly believe Iraq staged the 9/11 attacks.... 
It\'s frightening to see Bush claim with a straight face 
his war against Iraq will bring democracy and peace to 
the Mideast, and save Iraqis from repression. Why 
didn\'t he begin by saving Palestinians from the 
repression by his alter-ego, Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon? If Bush really cared about Mideast 
democracy, he\'s had two years to do something about 
U.S.-sponsored dictatorships like Egypt and Pakistan, 
or medieval autocracies such as Morocco, Jordan, Saudi 
Arabia and America\'s Gulf protectorates. When Bush says 
he will bring democracy to benighted Iraqis, what he 
really means is U.S. rule. In Bush-speak, \'democracy\' 
has been perverted to mean U.S. imperial hegemony.... 
Many Americans simply don\'t understand their leadership 
is about to plunge the nation into an open-ended, 
dangerous colonial war. All the propaganda about 
democracy, human rights and regional stability is the 
same kind of double-talk used by the 19th century 
British and French imperialists who claimed they were 
grabbing Africa and Asia to bring the benefits of 
Christian civilization to the heathens.... Misery loves 
company. An American-occupied Iraq looks destined to 
join the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza as another 
human, political and moral disaster for all concerned.\" 
 
2.   \"Remaking the Arab world\" 
The conservative National Post editorialized (3/1): \"In 
a speech to the American Enterprise Institute on 
Wednesday, U.S. President George W. Bush made the case 
for war in terms that transcend weapons of mass 
destruction and UN resolutions.... We hope the world 
pays heed to Mr. Bush\'s message. While disarming Iraq, 
ending the country\'s sponsorship of terrorism and 
liberating Saddam Hussein\'s subjects are all war-worthy 
goals, the greatest dividend to be hoped for in the 
long run is the transformation of the Arab 
Middle East.... In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Bush 
declared that \'we will remain in Iraq as long as 
necessary,\' and compared the coming reconstruction 
project with the rebuilding of Japan and Germany six 
decades ago.... The historical comparison is apt, and 
we hope Mr. Bush follows through on these words. 
Through its sustained presence in Iraq, the United 
States will have a rare opportunity to transform the 
Arab Middle East. It would be a tragedy if the 
President turned his back on this crucial enterprise 
once the immediate threat posed by Saddam is 
extinguished.\" 
 
3.   \"Peace can still prevail\" 
The liberal Toronto Star opined (3/3): \"...American 
pressure has stiffened the Security Council, which is 
forcing Saddam - at last - to disarm. But Bush is now 
perversely undermining the U.N. by making \'regime 
change\' in Baghdad a requirement, in addition to 
disarmament.... Democrats in Congress may be too timid 
to challenge Bush. But polls suggest a fast-growing 
public preference in America for working within the 
U.N. to exhaust peaceful options. Enfeebled by years of 
sanctions, Iraq presents no immediate threat. 
The same can\'t be said of a Security Council at war 
with itself. Making specific demands of Saddam, instead 
of reiterating the Bush mantra that 
\'Iraq must disarm,\' would silence those who contend 
that Bush can never be satisfied. Saddam\'s obduracy is 
infuriating. And he is dangerous.... Still, Saddam has 
blinked. That suggests there\'s a chance he can be 
disarmed peacefully. That would vindicate Bush. 
Reaffirm American leadership. Enhance U.S. prestige. 
And strengthen the United Nations. All without firing a 
shot. It\'s worth a try.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1. The Government of Canada\'s strategic vision for 
transportation policy was unveiled on February 25th, 2003. 
There appear to be no radical departures from past GOC 
positions; gradualism is the key note struck by the authors 
of the policy statement. The policy vision addresses all 
modes: air, marine, and surface (rail and road). This cable, 
however, focuses exclusively on aviation issues (other modes 
will be addressed septel).  From the US perspective the key 
message is that GOC intends further \"gradual liberalization\" 
of Canada\'s bilateral air agreements.  More substantive 
aviation developments for the US may arrive, however, via 
the \"exploratory talks\" which Transport Minister Collenette 
and his Deputy suggested to Ambassador Cellucci (Ref A). 
End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Policy Vision in development since mid-2001 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. The policy vision, with the title \"Straight Ahead: A 
vision for Transportation in Canada\" is the final version of 
the Transportation Policy Blueprint initiated in July 2001. 
This effort, in turn, was precipitated by the final report 
of the independent, blue-ribbon, Canada Transportation Act 
Review (CTAR) panel which contained 92 recommendations to 
the Minister to improve regulation of Canada\'s 
transportation sector (Ref C,D).  The \"Straight Ahead\" 
document, as well as the CTAR panel report and other 
supporting documents are available on-line at the following

3. With respect to civil aviation, the key action item of 
interest to the USG is that the GoC \"will continue the 
gradual liberalization of Canada\'s bilateral air agreements, 
using the 1995 Canada-United States Open Skies agreement as 
a guide.\" 
 
4. The authors of the policy vision note that there is 
continuing pressure on the government to remove restrictions 
on foreign participation in Canadian domestic and 
international air markets (Ref C, D) and, \"under the right 
circumstances, opening Canada\'s air markets to greater 
external participation on a reciprocal basis could introduce 
some new competition and lead to greater efficiency.\"  \"In 
the government\'s view, however, now is not the appropriate 
time to undertake this step\" since \"the harsh realities of 
the current marketplace indicate that the primary effect of 
making such a significant change would be to weaken an 
already vulnerable industry.\" 
 
------------------ 
Airport governance 
------------------ 
 
5. To clarify the respective responsibilities of the 
government and of airports of national significance (e.g. 
Toronto, Vancouver, Dorval/Montreal, Calgary) the GoC, 
intends to set out detailed rules for airport authorities to 
follow respecting governance, accountability and 
transparency of economic issues at national airports. 
Comment: This is a welcome development, in the past both 
passengers and airlines have complained about murky 
accounting for the large sums of money airports acquired 
through levying a variety of fees on passengers and airlines 
(Ref B). End comment. 
 
----------------- 
Industry comments 
----------------- 
 
6. Air Canada officials are disappointed in the GoC plan. 
They commented that although the new policy vision 
acknowledges the unprecedented crisis in the airline 
industry, the GoC has offered no concrete relief (read 
direct financial aid) to the industry. 
7. WestJet, the profitable low-fare operator in Canada also 
appeared under-whelmed by the GoC policy vision.  The item 
pitched directly to the smaller airlines was the GoC promise 
to introduce laws forcing Air Canada to offer interlining 
and sharing of frequent flier points, in which WestJet, as a 
low-cost operator, has no interest whatsoever.  WestJet 
complained that there was little consultation between the 
airline and Transport Canada in the development of the 
policy vision 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. With respect to civil aviation the policy vision provides 
impetus for a series of low key, incremental developments, 
largely administrative in nature. There will be no dramatic 
moves to liberalize the aviation sector as has repeatedly 
been recommended to the government by independent panels, 
observers, parliamentary committees and even the GoC\'s 
Competition Bureau (Refs C,D).  Indeed, the announcement in 
the February 18 federal budget that the Aviation Security 
Fee will be reduced from $24 to $18 per domestic round trip 
far outstrips this policy vision in significance (Ref B). 
More substantive ideas on aviation liberalization may have 
to await discussion in any future \"exploratory talks\" of the 
type broached during the lunch between Minister Collennette 
and Ambassador Cellucci (Ref A).

2. (SBU) Summary and Introduction - Post recommends that 
Canada not be placed on the Special 301 Watch List.  Recent 
Canadian legislation has addressed several of the concerns 
outlined in previous 301 reports, such as the exclusion of 
Internet retransmission from the compulsory licensing 
regime, and thereby enhanced intellectual property 
protection in Canada.  Several long-standing 301 issues, 
including national treatment of U.S. artists in the 
distribution of proceeds from Canada\'s private copying levy 
and \"neighboring rights\" regime, have received little 
private sector support (Post has received no queries from 
U.S. interests on either of these issues) and may no longer 
warrant a Watch List recommendation.  Other high-profile 
issues that are of concern to U.S. interests, including the 
delisting of pharmaceutical patents and patenting of higher 
life forms, are currently being reviewed by the GOC and are 
not ripe for inclusion in the Watch List at this time.  Post 
is mindful of the various IP concerns and will continue to 
closely monitor these issues and raise them in meetings with 
GOC officials.  End Summary and Introduction. 
 
-- LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL SUCCESS -- 
 
3. (SBU) Canada has made real progress in improving its IPR 
regime over the last couple of years. In December 2002, the 
GOC revised its Copyright Act (Bill C-11) to explicitly 
exclude Internet retransmissions from its compulsory 
licensing regime to the satisfaction of U.S. interests (ref 
E).  An Order-In-Council is expected on March 21, 2003, 
which will make C-11 enter into force immediately.  In 2001, 
the government amended its patent law to provide at least a 
20-year term of protection for patents filed before October 
1, 1989. 
 
4. There are legitimate concerns about Canada\'s border 
measures and weak enforcement of IP, both at the borders and 
throughout the country.  Canadian Customs and the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are required by law to take a 
passive approach to border enforcement and have not 
committed the necessary resources to address counterfeiting 
and piracy.  A recent judicial decision, however, is a step 
in the right direction.  In April 2002 the Supreme Court 
decided that Canadian law prohibits the decoding of all 
encrypted satellite signals.  Since this time the GOC, 
working with several cable associations, has stepped up 
efforts to both improve enforcement and address underlying 
legislative issues.  These efforts have not yet crossed over 
to problems related to border enforcement. 
 
-- LIMITED PRIVATE SECTOR INTEREST -- 
 
5. (SBU) The GOC has not resolved the outstanding issue of 
national treatment of U.S. artists in the distribution of 
proceeds from Canada\'s private copying levy and its 
\"neighboring rights\" regime and considers these issues to be 
relatively low priorities (Ref F).  Post has not received 
any support from U.S. industry on these issues in the five 
years that we have recommended Canada be placed on USTR\'s 
Watch List.  Since U.S. industry does not consider these 
issues significant enough for their involvement, we do not 
believe they warrant a Watch List recommendation. 
 
-- ISSUES NOT YET RIPE FOR INCLUSION ON THE WATCH LIST -- 
 
6. (SBU) Health Canada is currently engaged in an internal 
policy review of several patent issues, including delisting 
specific patents, and Notice of Compliance \"linkage\" 
regulations.  At the same time, Industry Canada is holding 
public hearings this month on a number of IP issues and will 
focus on linkage regulations.  Until the GOC publishes a 
report that indicates in what direction it will actually 
move, we believe it would be premature at this time to 
recommend placing the GOC on the Watch List because the GOC 
is, in fact, addressing these issues.  In their response to 
PhRMA\'s 301 submission, the GOC noted the complexity of the 
issues and regulations at hand and the fact that \"Canada is 
not alone in facing difficult issues regarding patent 
eligibility as it relates to its linkage regime.  Issues 
surrounding patent eligibility and abuse are often the 
subjects of debate in US Congress.  For example, on October 
21, 2002, President Bush announced US intentions to address 
problems relating to perceived delays in the market entry of 
generic drugs.\" 
 
7. (SBU) In December 2002 the Canadian Supreme Court decided 
against allowing the patent on the \"Harvard Mouse\" on the 
basis that \"a higher life form is not patentable because it 
is not a \"manufacture\" or \"composition of matter\" within the 
meaning of \"invention\" in s.2 of the Patent Act.\" (See ref 
C)  U.S. biotech companies are concerned that the Court\'s 
decision, if left intact, would exclude from patent 
eligibility any invention that is a higher life form.  In 
their decision the Supreme Court Justices made it explicit 
that their word is not the final one on this issue; that it 
is up to Parliament to bring in new legislation to deal with 
the patentability of higher life forms.  As reported in ref 
D, the GOC has stated its intent to modernize Canada\'s 
Patent Act.  While no definite timeline has been announced 
as yet, we do not see a justification to place Canada on the 
Watch List unless the GOC fails to make clear this year its 
determination to amend the Act.  Cellucci

SUBJECT: DEFENSE MINISTER MCCALLUM AND THE CANADIAN FORCES 
 
REF: OTTAWA 178 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Nine months into his tenure as Minister, John McCallum 
is starting to put his mark on the Department of National 
Defense.  He was able to get a greater-than-expected increase 
in defense spending in the latest GoC budget, and he has 
announced a defense review to guide transformation of the 
Canadian Forces.  McCallum\'s economics background and 
determination to find savings have helped him in Cabinet, 
specifically in the budget battle.  His limited political and 
military experience has shown at times, and has caused some 
friction with the Canadian Forces and defense advocates.  But 
McCallum has greater strategic vision and influence in 
Cabinet than his recent predecessors, and he is a consistent 
advocate for strengthening the U.S.-Canada defense 
relationship.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
BUDGET VICTORY 
-------------- 
 
2. (C) The GoC budget announced on February 18 was a real 
victory for McCallum, though he has gotten little credit from 
defense advocates here because the needs are so much greater. 
 The baseline defense budget increased by US$533 million per 
year (from US$7.9 billion in the 2002-2003 budget) for three 
years, and McCallum has promised US$133 million per year in 
administrative savings (e.g., greater efficiency in 
procurements).  McCallum argues that one-fourth of all 
incremental spending in the 2003-2004 GoC budget went to 
defense, and that he could not have gotten more given 
competing domestic priorities (especially health care). 
McCallum asserts that DND got all that he was asking for, and 
all that it could use efficiently in 2003-2004.  While we 
disagree with his argument that more was not justified - 
especially given the upcoming deployments to ISAF IV and V - 
his point about the limits on defense spending in the 
Chretien Government is certainly valid. 
 
3. (C) Under these circumstances, McCallum did well in the 
2003-2004 budget, but you would never have known it from his 
address to the Conference of Defense Associations (CDA) on 
February 27.  McCallum grew visibly agitated as he fielded 
one critical comment after another about the budget and the 
pending deployment to Aghanistan.  The audience\'s mood was 
not helped by the disclosure earlier in the week that the new 
budget eliminates future funding for the CDA.  It is not yet 
clear whether this was simply a cost-cutting measure, or 
retribution for an organization that has loudly criticized 
the GoC\'s defense program for years. 
 
----------------------------- 
OVERSTRETCHED CANADIAN FORCES 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) While McCallum will not lose any sleep over veterans 
organizations, he does have to concern himself with Canadian 
Forces\' morale.  McCallum admitted to the CDA audience that 
some in the Army were unhappy over the decision to deploy to 
Afghanistan.  Many in the Canadian Forces would have prefered 
a GoC commitment to contribute land forces in Iraq, and the 
size and duration of the ISAF commitment - a battalion and 
brigade headquarters for 12 months - will exacerbate the 
military\'s biggest problem, operational tempo.  The Canadian 
Forces leadership was also upset because it had little or no 
advance warning of McCallum\'s February 12 ISAF announcement. 
Chief of Defense Staff GEN Henault told the CDA that the 
\"content\" came as no surprise, though it did lead one senior 
officer - MGEN Cam Ross, DND Director General of 
International Security Policy - to resign in protest. 
 
5. (C) On the positive side, McCallum has made a concerted 
effort to bolster the U.S.-Canada defense relationship, which 
is crucial for the Canadian Forces.  He pushed through a 2002 
agreement for a binational, counterterrorist Planning Group 
at NORAD, despite sovereignty concerns in Ottawa, and has 
forced missile defense cooperation onto the Cabinet\'s agenda 
(outcome still to be determined). 
 
6. (C) Within a divided Cabinet, McCallum has also advocated 
keeping open the option of military participation in Iraq - 
i.e., naval or air assets already in theater - without a 
second UNSC resolution.  McCallum got burned, however, when 
he publicly stated that this was GoC policy after his January 
9 meeting with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.  McCallum had it 
right, but Chretien has not wanted to admit publicly that 
Canada might act without UN blessing.  After Chretien reined 
him in (reftel), McCallum overreacted by ordering Canadian 
military planners at CENTCOM to not attend a coalition 
planning meeting the following week.  This unnecessary 
action, which did not reflect any change in GoC policy, 
damaged Canada\'s credibility for Iraq planning in Tampa and 
in Washington. 
-------------- 
DEFENSE REVIEW 
-------------- 
 
7. (U) Shortly after becoming Defense Minister, McCallum 
directed DND to undertake a \"defense update\" focused on 
immediate needs for the 2003-2004 budget cycle.  As GEN 
Henault describes it, funding increases in the latest budget 
allow the Canadian Forces to shift their focus from 
survivability to sustainability.  The next step will be 
transformation, and McCallum has said that a full-scale 
\"defense review\" will be conducted to guide that process. 
McCallum cautions that this may or may not result in 
increased funding for the military, but that it should point 
the way on bigger procurement decisions. 
 
8. (U) On one of the military\'s biggest needs, strategic 
lift, McCallum has publicly stated that a stand-alone 
Canadian purchase of C-17s is not in the cards.  His 
reasoning is that given limited GoC funding, purchasing C-17s 
would gut the defense budget, making it impossible to meet 
other needs.  Instead, DND is looking into a combined 
purchase of C-17s with NATO allies.  McCallum has also 
expressed doubts over the continued need for tanks, so long 
as the Army has some direct-fire capability (e.g., the 
planned U.S. combat system/mobile gun system).  McCallum did, 
in the latest budget, allocate US$467 million in funding over 
the next ten years for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target 
Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). 
 
-------------------- 
LIBERAL PARTY LEGACY 
-------------------- 
 
9. (C) One procurement issue that continues to haunt the GoC 
is a replacement for its Sea King maritime helicopters, which 
entered service in 1963.  In the 1993 campaign, Chretien 
attacked the Tory Government\'s plans to purchase EH-101 
maritime helicopters as extravagant.  After the election 
Chretien cancelled the deal, and he has stymied subsequent 
DND efforts to let a new contract.  Meanwhile, the Sea Kings 
continue to diminish the Canadian Navy\'s effectiveness.  The 
latest example came on February 27 when the Canadian 
Destroyer HMCS Iroquois, headed for a Canadian-led, combined 
naval task force in the Persian Gulf, had to return to 
Halifax after its Sea King crashed onto the deck.  The 
Iroquois set sail again on March 5, this time with no 
helicopter, 
 
10. (C) The Sea King fiasco is a reminder of the challenges 
the Canadian Forces will continue to face in Ottawa.  While 
Chretien is set to step down in February 2004, we expect the 
Liberal Party to remain in power for the foreseeable future. 
While Chretien\'s successor - probably ex-Finance Minister 
Paul Martin - may be better disposed toward the Canadian 
Forces, he is also unlikely to make dramatic increases to the 
defense budget.  McCallum and his successors will have to 
continue to make incremental moves and plenty of hard 
choices.  The hope here is that a defense review can be ready 
to go soon after Chretien leaves office, and that the next 
Prime Minister will be more supportive of the Canadian Forces.

SUBJECT: IMPLEMENTING THE AVIATION PRE-CLEARANCE AGREEMENT 
WITH CANADA 
 
 
1. This is an action request.  Action request in paragraph 5. 
 
2. After lengthy negotiations, late last year the U.S. and 
Canada concluded an aviation preclearance agreement 
that,among other items, provides increased protection for 
Department of Homeland Security inspection officers (formerly 
Customs,INS,and APHIS officers) working at Canadian airports. 
At the request of the U.S., the agreement required that the 
U.S. grant reciprocity to Canada before it could be brought 
into force.   We understand the provision providing 
reciprocity was part of the omnibus appropriations bill which 
became law in February, and that the only formal step 
required to bring the agreement into force is an exchange of 
notes between the sides. 
 
3. Canadian Foreign Minister Graham wrote to Ambassador 
Cellucci in January expressing the GOC\'s desire to bring the 
agreement into force as soon as the reciprocity provision 
became law (text below). A DFAIT official, Bruce Levy, told 
us March 4 that Canada\'s Customs and Immigration Ministries 
and their U.S. counterparts were developing Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPS) related to the agreement.  Levy 
said it was his understanding that completion of the SOPS was 
not requireed to bring the agreement into force, but that the 
SOPS were near completion. 
 
4. Levy also said that the GOC must complete a couple of 
formal, internal steps in order to exchange notes that 
establish the date the agreement goes into force.  The GOC 
would like to know USG thinking on an appropriate date so 
that it can take these internal steps. We note that Secretary 
Ridge and Deputy Prime Minister Manley are expected to meet 
in late March or early April.  It might be appropriate to 
have the agreement go into force in connection with this 
meeting. 
 
5. Action Request:  Please inform us of desired date for new 
aviation preclearance agreement with Canada to enter into 
force so we can provide this to the GOC. 
 
6.  Letter from Foreign Minister Graham to Ambassador 
Cellucci: 
 
 
January 22,2003 
 
Excellency: 
 
     I have the honor to inform you that the training of U.S. 
Preclearance Officers to work under the Air Transport 
Preclearance Agreement was completed by Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency staff on December 13, 2002.  Canada is now 
prepared for the exchange of notes that will bring the 
Agreement into force. 
 
    It is my understanding that your government is not yet in 
a position to implement the Agreement, as the necessary 
legislation to allow for full reciprocity did not pass during 
the last Congressional session.  You and U.S. Customs 
Commissioner Bonner have indicated that this issue is a 
priority for you.  In light of the time and energy our 
governments have invested in this file, I would urge you to 
encourage your Administration to move quickly in order for 
the exchange of notes to proceed. 
 
     Because of their involvement in this file, I have taken 
the liberty of sending copies of my letter to the Deputy 
Prime Minister and the Ministers of Transport and Citizenship 
and Immigration. 
 
Sincerely,

IRAQ 
1.   \"The American \'dream palace\'\" 
Columnist Jeffrey Simpson commented in the leading 
Globe and Mail (3/4): \"...The \'dream palace\' will be 
one in which the Americans are led by their political 
and military leaders through unfamiliar cultural 
territory, using largely inappropriate means toward 
long-term engagements for which Americans are not 
prepared, financially or psychologically. An 
administration with revolutionary objectives is running 
U.S. policy. The realists have been 
banished or marginalized, considered wimps too inclined 
to compromise. The ideologues believe they are the 
terrorists\' nightmare, but, instead, they 
are the terrorists\' dream, because they have 
overreacted. By pursuing \'regime change,\' starting with 
a U.S. general running Iraq for two years or 
more, the U.S. will turn even more people against them 
and provide the best recruiting ground yet for militant 
fundamentalism. The shock sought by the Americans, 
therefore, will more likely be to 
themselves. Unless, of course, the U.S. does an 
Afghanistan, and turns Iraq, once conquered, from last 
year\'s headlines to today\'s back pages. In which 
case, Iraq, an artificial country, will fall apart in 
chaos.\" 
 
2.   \"The real reasons for deposing Saddam\" 
Columnist Paul Stanway wrote in the conservative 
tabloid Edmonton Sun (3/1): \"...Promoting democracy in 
the Middle East. In a nutshell, that\'s what the 
conflict with Iraq is all about. Yes, it\'s an argument 
over weapons of mass destruction and the crumbling 
authority of the United Nations, but in the long run it 
is, as Bush so eloquently explained, about promoting 
the spread of democratic values to create a more stable 
and peaceful world. One in which despots like Saddam 
Hussein are not able to seize the wealth of a nation 
and use it to fund aggressive wars against their 
neighbours - which in his case have already taken the 
lives of over a million people.\" 
 
3.   \"War of ideas\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"U.S. values of liberty, 
democracy and free institutions could work with Islam,\" 
the right-of-center Calgary Herald (3/1) commented: 
\"...Those who saw in the rubble the just, if 
regrettable, fruits of U.S. foreign policy, required 
Americans to don sackcloth and ashes to atone for the 
poverty and hopelessness in the tyrannies of the Middle 
East. They prescribed understanding, conciliation, 
repentance and ultimately, appeasement. Retaliation, 
they supposed, would harden attitudes and further 
compound those ineffable root causes. Such thinking was 
patently absurd. Certainly, poverty can be the petri- 
dish of resentment, but it was not the poor who 
attacked America. It was the sons of the affluent. And 
the more one understands what inspired al-Qaeda and its 
Taliban hosts, the less one is inclined to conciliate: 
How does one placate somebody who wants nothing of you 
but your life?... The U.S. failure to depose Saddam 
Hussein in the Gulf War was taken in the Arab world as 
weakness, not restraint. Now, Saddam\'s continued 
survival, the symbolism of an Arab dictator defying the 
Great Satan, sustains the terrorist hope of ultimate 
victory. Saddam with nuclear weapons would much 
encourage it. The reverse is also true: His removal 
will cause alarm and despondency among the militants. 
Saddam, therefore, must go.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Pope has zeal, but no answer on Iraq question\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee noted in the leading Globe and 
Mail (3/6) that, \"John Paul is dead against war and he 
is not afraid to say so.... To drive his antiwar 
message home, John Paul has met many of the leading 
players in the Iraq debate: British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair, Iraqi deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, United 
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Italian Prime 
Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Spanish Prime Minister 
Jose Maria Aznar.... The Pope\'s surprisingly muscular 
intervention puts him at odds with the two 
devoted Christians who are leading the campaign against 
Iraq - Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair - and sets up a 
remarkable debate over the morality of the planned 
war.... Both Mr. Blair and Mr. Bush believe just as 
strongly as the Pope that their course is the morally 
correct one. In fact, as opposition to the war has 
grown, both have begun framing their arguments in moral 
terms.... If war is the wrong answer, what, in the case 
of Iraq, is the right one? To this, Christ\'s Vicar has 
no good answer.\" 
 
2.   \"Ever new lines in the sand\" 
Editorial page editor emeritus Haroon Siddiqui 
commented in the liberal Toronto Star (3/6): \"Another 
week, another American rationale for hurtling toward an 
invasion of Iraq.... What we are witnessing in 
Washington is a dangerously ideological administration 
so bent on waging war that it would say just about 
anything to justify its holy mission.\" 
 
3.   \"The `evil axis\' hits back\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/5): \"As U.S. 
President George Bush gets ready to crush Saddam 
Hussein, the rest of the \'axis of evil\' are feeling 
Saddam\'s pain. But far from being cowed, North Korea 
and Iran seem determined to deny Bush the chance to do 
to them what he\'s about to do to Saddam. It\'s getting 
prickly out there. In Korea, the mercurial Kim Jong-il 
has countered a threat with a crisis. He has an illegal 
nuclear bomb or two, and is eyeing an assembly line.... 
Iran, too, is a worry. Tehran has a murky 
\'peaceful\' nuclear program that\'s getting murkier. It 
has rebuffed IAEA requests for better access to nuclear 
sites.... All the talk in Washington of \'taking out\' 
Saddam\'s regime before it can arm itself with horror 
weapons has emboldened Korea, and tempted Iran, to 
shield themselves from attack by acquiring the very 
nukes Saddam lacks. Washington\'s aggressive doctrine of 
`pre-emptively\' smashing regimes that pose no threat 
but in theory might risks inviting an arms race that 
can only damage U.S. interests. Having 
loosed this stampede, Bush must now try to rein it in. 
The campaign against terror remains America\'s chief 
priority. But getting North Korea to abandon its nukes 
and persuading Iran not to go down the nuclear road 
ought to be high on the presidential agenda. Higher 
than regime change in Iraq. Iraq is a problem. But 
Korea is a crisis. And Iran is fast becoming one. 
However Bush may loathe Pyongyang and Tehran, he needs 
to cool his moralizing, rein in his hawkish advisers 
and deploy skilled diplomats to engage these regimes 
in a dialogue to head off catastrophe. Toppling Saddam 
is a potentially fatal distraction.\" 
 
4.   \"Murky message hurts U.S. case for war in Iraq\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee observed in the leading Globe and 
Mail (3/5): \"Is the United States trying to disarm 
Iraq\'s Saddam Hussein, or trying to remove him from 
power? The simple answer: both. Washington believes 
that the only way to make sure he disarms is to oust 
him. That is why it is preparing to fight. But 
somewhere on the road to Baghdad, that message has 
become clouded, confusing U.S. allies and undermining 
the case for war.... Despite all the confusion in the 
wider world about regime change, the U.S. 
administration is quite clear in its own mind about its 
war aims, which have not changed a jot since the 
beginning. Disarmament is the goal and ousting Saddam 
Hussein the method. But by muddying the message, it has 
hurt its case.\" 
 
5.   \"Intolerable aggression\" 
The centrist Winnipeg Free Press editorialized (3/6): 
\"U.S. President George Bush has been expressing high 
hopes lately about the secondary benefits that may 
result from a military operation to disarm Iraqi 
dictator Saddam Hussein. These could include freedom, 
peace and prosperity for the people of Iraq and 
neighbouring countries, establishment of a democratic 
Palestinian state and peace for Israel. It is, however, 
far from certain that these results can be achieved 
through invasion of Iraq.... Results of that distant 
kind lie far beyond Mr. Bush\'s control. America and its 
allies should be conscious of both the dangers and the 
opportunities, but they should not decide between war 
and peace on the basis of hoped or feared results that, 
for the moment, can only be guessed at. Invasion of 
Iraq will cause death, injury and destruction of 
property, mainly for Iraqis but also for the invaders. 
That is a terrible course to adopt and many governments 
on the United Nations Security Council have been 
reluctant to agree to such a course. The other course, 
however, is far worse. The other course is to tolerate 
aggression.... Peace and security for all countries 
depend on effective means for stopping aggression.... 
The valid purpose for invading Iraq is to disarm Saddam 
Hussein. That is worth doing for itself and for the 
larger purpose of showing all would-be aggressors that 
aggression is not tolerated. If the action leads to 
general peace and contentment in the Arab world and the 
Middle East, so much the better, but George Bush should 
not count on it and he should not be surprised if his 
action produces unwelcome results that he can neither 
foresee nor prevent. The best possible result is 
compliance by Iraq with the requirements of the 
Security Council. Failing that, invasion to enforce 
compliance is a cruel necessity. If compliance is not 
enforced, then the invitation to aggression is issued 
and the nations of the world must brace themselves for 
the wars that will follow. \" 
 
6.   \"The triple veto\". 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (3/6): \"The last word still belongs to the chief 
inspectors who will present their report tomorrow. It 
is worth pointing out that France has insisted that the 
Blix expose be made in public and not in closed chamber 
as it was originally planned.  Yesterday\'s gesture by 
the Berlin-Moscow-Paris axis had an immediate impact. 
Prime Minister Blair is more isolated than ever... By 
playing his pieces so unilaterally, the leader of the 
British government has gone beyond the point of no 
return. If Washington decides to go ahead without the 
support of the U.N., as Secretary of State Colin Powell 
has predicted, Blair will be forced to follow. This man 
who preferred action over the rule of law has put 
himself in the position to be hit by the boomerang 
effect.\" 
 
7.   \"Losing the PR Game\" 
Columnist Ian MacDonald wrote in the conservative The 
Gazette (3/5): \"...Once it made a choice of going to 
the United Nations rather than going it alone on the 
road to Baghdad, the Bush administration was committed 
to a diplomatic end game in the Security Council, a 
game it clearly does not control.... Meantime, world 
opinion counts. The worldwide anti-war demonstrations 
on Feb. 15 were also a reminder of the awesome power of 
the Internet.... Never before has such a well-connected 
movement demonstrated in such impressive numbers around 
the world on a single day.... But the worst moment for 
the Bush administration might have come when Iraqi 
deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz received an audience 
from the pope.... Perhaps the best policy for the 
United States would be to stand by in the Persian Gulf 
and keep squeezing Saddam until, piece by piece, he 
destroys all his weapons of mass destruction.  Then, in 
the immortal words of the late Vermont senator, George 
D. Aiken, in the context of Vietnam, Bush could simply 
declare victory and pull out.\" 
 
AFGHANISTAN 
8.   \"What happened to Afghanistan\'s cash?\' 
The conservative National Post opined (3/6): \"When 
Afghanistan\'s Taliban regime fell in late 2001, there 
was a widely shared feeling that this was a victory for 
the Afghan people as much as it was for the United 
States and its allies.... In recent months, however, 
the world\'s attention has become increasingly focused 
on Iraq, and it appears the West is beginning to forget 
about Afghanistan.... Washington dropped the ball on 
Afghanistan a second time, just two weeks ago. In late 
February, Japan played host to a second 
conference on Afghanistan, this time to promote the 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration...of the 
estimated 800,000 Afghan men who serve in the country\'s 
network of private armies. The United States pledged 
just $14-million for this crucial effort, compared to a 
promise of $42-million from Japan. This is 
unacceptable: The United States is both the 
world\'s richest country and the Western nation with the 
most to lose should Afghanistan collapse or fall back 
under the sway of Taliban-like extremists. 
Washington should be rounding up more generous funding 
for the DDR and other projects. It also must commit 
larger amounts itself. It would be fantastically short- 
sighted for the United States to spend tens of billions 
of dollars fighting a high-tech war in 2001 - only to 
see the benefits squandered because of a lack of follow- 
up humanitarian funding in 2003 and 
beyond.... It should be no small embarrassment to 
Western governments that Iran - a member of George W. 
Bush\'s \'axis of evil\' - has actually turned into one of 
Afghanistan\'s most generous donors.... If the Western 
effort falters, and a political vacuum develops in 
Afghanistan, we can guess what the consequences will 
be.... In 1989, when the Soviet Union was kicked out of 
Afghanistan by U.S.-backed mujahadeen, the United 
States had the chance 
to help Afghanistan rebuild. Instead, Washington 
declared victory and abandoned the country - a move 
that left Afghanistan ripe pickings for the 
Pakistan-backed Taliban a few years later. We cannot 
allow history to repeat itself.\" 
 
TURKEY 
9.   \"Ankara\'s dilemma\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal French- 
language daily Le Devoir (3/4): \"The Ankara government 
intends to try again by presenting a second motion to 
Parliament.... To rally all the members of his party, 
Erdogan will obviously have to propose a motion with 
more potential gains than those promised so far by 
Bush. The dilemma is simple: either the government 
gives satisfaction to Washington and immediately 
alienates civil society, or it refuses and its chances 
of joining the European Union sooner will increase to 
Bush\'s great displeasure.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"How to lose the war of public opinion\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"The Bush administration might 
think it has enough evidence to attack Saddam Hussein, 
but the polls show otherwise,\" Calgary Herald columnist 
Danielle Smith wrote in the nationalist Ottawa Citizen 
(3/7): \"Had Saddam Hussein been responsible for the 
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks; had he harboured Osama bin 
Laden and his henchmen in the fallout of the Taliban 
regime collapse; had the United States revealed Saddam 
has provided weapons of mass destruction to militant 
Islamic groups; had he recently invaded foreign 
territory, lobbed missiles at one of his neighbours, 
discharged chemical weapons or attacked the U.S. 
directly - any of these would have been sufficient 
grounds for an immediate attack. But 
there aren\'t clear grounds, which is why U.S. 
President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair should not invade Iraq.... What has Iraq 
done to the West, or even to its neighbours lately? The 
U.S. argues Iraq may supply terrorist  organizations 
with weapons of mass destruction. That may be true, but 
so could a lot of other nations, and the U.S. can\'t 
wage war on them all.... There is no question that Iraq 
is a tragic case. Iraqis need 
liberation, to free them from the abuse they suffer at 
Saddam\'s hands, and to stop thousands of politically 
motivated executions. Saddam is an evil man, but so are 
many other despots and dictators, and the U.S. can\'t 
topple them all. The responsibility for regime change 
in Iraq ultimately lies with Iraqi citizens, not the 
U.S. And, in any event, the question before the UN is 
disarmament, not regime change. There is no question 
which nation is the strong horse now. Crushing Saddam 
Hussein to drive the point home just isn\'t necessary.\" 
 
2.   \"First Iraq, then UN\" 
The conservative tabloid Winnipeg Sun opined (3/7): 
\"People keep talking about the looming irrelevancy of 
the United Nations if the U.S. unilaterally invades 
Iraq as if this was a bad thing. Why? The destruction 
of the UN in its present form is almost as desirable as 
ridding the world of Saddam Hussein. The UN\'s fatal 
flaw is that it treats every member state the same, 
regardless of its human rights record. Because its 
dictatorships so often act in concert, the UN has run 
amok for years.... Post 9/11, America has every 
justification for war. Not only is Saddam a cruel 
tyrant to his own people who has attacked three 
neighbours, he has vigorously pursued weapons of mass 
destruction and financially supported terrorism.... We 
don\'t share George Bush\'s view that toppling Saddam 
will inspire a wave of democracy in the Mideast\'s 
thuggish dictators. But it will warn them, effectively, 
that from now on there will be a price to pay for 
following Iraq\'s lead. As for the UN, its few 
worthwhile aid and humanitarian programs can be revived 
under a new global organization in which democracies, 
not dictatorships, must play the dominant role.\" 
 
TURKEY 
3.   \"The day the Turks came out\' 
Columnist Jeffrey Simpson commented in the leading 
Globe and Mail (3/7): \"...The Turkish government could 
scarcely believe it lost the vote. Washington was 
stunned. After all, Turkey has been a strong U.S. ally 
and a NATO member, and had been a front-line state 
during the 1991 Persian Gulf war.... Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan\'s government had all kinds of political 
capital. It had received an overwhelming mandate in 
November to clean up Turkish politics. Although 
nominally an Islamist party, Mr. Erdogan\'s team 
said and did everything to convince Western countries 
that Turkey would remain a faithful ally. Now this. The 
Turks, who know Iraq, understand that, despite today\'s 
sweet pronouncements about respecting borders, there 
are Kurds in eastern Turkey and Kurds in northern Iraq 
(and in Syria and Iran), and that blood often runs 
thicker than the water of political declarations of 
intent. They know that, after the Americans leave Iraq, 
the Turks will be left to cope with its ethnic 
rivalries. The hint of Turkish troops entering northern 
Iraq with the Americans inflamed Iraqi Kurds; the idea 
of a quasi-autonomous Kurdish territory inside Iraq 
frightened the Turks. The 
Turks don\'t like Saddam Hussein, but they don\'t fear 
him, either, and they are a lot closer to his regime 
than the U.S. is. The Turkish military prizes 
its relationship with the U.S. military. Maybe the 
generals and better parliamentary tactics can reverse 
what happened in parliament. Even so, the first vote 
reflected well on Turkish democracy and sent a signal - 
which will undoubtedly be ignored in Washington - that 
the people of yet another friendly country have 
deserted the United States.\"            CELLUCCI

IRAQ 
1.   \"Liberating Iraqis is main justification for war\" 
Columnist Rosie DiManno writing from Jordan made the 
following observations in the liberal Toronto Star 
(3/10): \"The most urgent and compelling reason 
for invading Iraq is the one never mentioned by 
bickering diplomats at the United Nations: 24 million 
Iraqis, 24 years of barbarous misrule, government by 
thuggery.... But world leaders are pragmatic and 
utterly selfish, with a keen eye to geopolitical 
interests, even as they invest themselves with noble 
motives - all this duplicitous keening about avoiding a 
catastrophic war. That might be what drove millions of 
people around the world to protest against war in Iraq, 
but it has precious little to do with the bellicose 
objections in Washington, Paris, Beijing, and let\'s 
throw in Berlin, which at least can honestly attest to 
the disastrous consequences of military belligerence. 
The Germans have been chastened into an appreciation 
for peace and diplomacy.... There are a multitude of 
reasons for attacking Iraq. It\'s 
to the United States\' discredit that U.S. President 
George W. Bush has done such a poor job of itemizing 
them. He botched the rightness of war by only latterly 
addressing the liberation of Iraqis, which should have 
been first on the list, and which British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair has managed to put at the centre of 
his war threat. Washington has cast about for 
validations of war: first it was about protecting 
American security from Saddam\'s nasty weapons cache; 
then it was about the security of Israel, then the 
security of the region, then Saddam\'s alleged links to 
Al Qaeda, and finally a stunning democratization of the 
Mideast, starting in Baghdad. No wonder the public\'s 
confused, credulous.... I don\'t understand why 
liberating Iraqis - Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Christians, 
Turkomans - from despotic tyranny has such little moral 
traction. I don\'t understand why the basic human values 
so precious to Canadians are deemed a luxury too taxing 
for the international community to deliver to Iraq. I 
don\'t understand the U.N.\'s continuing tolerance of 
rogue regimes, so long as they don\'t export tyranny 
beyond their borders. I don\'t understand why the Iraqi 
people matter so little.\" 
 
2.   \"War against Iraq senseless\" 
Columnist Tom Brodbeck stated in the conservative 
tabloid Winnipeg Sun (3/10): \"It\'s one thing for the 
United States and their so-called coalition of the 
willing to argue that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is 
a menace to the world who ought to be extinguished. 
It\'s quite another for them to bomb Baghdad without the 
approval of the United Nations and argue they\'re doing 
so to enforce a series of broken UN resolutions. That\'s 
hypocrisy in its purest form. If the U.S. and others 
feel they have enough justification to declare war 
against Iraq, whatever that justification may be, 
nobody can really stop them. But I wish they wouldn\'t 
insult my intelligence by telling me they\'re doing so 
to enforce a series of UN resolutions.... The UN passes 
resolutions all the time. But they have rules on how 
those resolutions should be enforced. They have a 
Security Council with voting members who have the sole 
authority to enforce those resolutions. Anyone else, 
including a `coalition of the willing,\' who tries to 
enforce them is not enforcing UN resolutions, they are 
acting outside the UN. You can\'t have it both ways. You 
can\'t say you\'re enforcing UN resolutions and then spit 
in the eye of the institution that created them. It\'s 
one of the many deficiencies in the pro-war argument. 
Another major flaw is the argument that Iraq is 
`linked\' to terrorist cells, whatever that means.... 
But when asked for evidence that Iraq was behind 9/11, 
the White House always fails to deliver.... It\'s 
perhaps that assertion that erodes Bush\'s credibility 
more than any other. When you don\'t have a strong case 
for action, you reach. And George W. is reaching.... 
The bottom line today, though, is that nothing is going 
to happen overnight in Iraq, except for a possible U.S.- 
led war.... The United Nations is combing though Iraq 
looking for and actively destroying arms. UN chief 
inspector Hans Blix is reporting continued progress and 
co-operation. The eye of the world is on Iraq and they 
can\'t attack anyone or really do anything. They\'re 
incarcerated. 
Under these circumstances, I don\'t know how any logical 
thinking person could in good conscience approve of 
military action against Iraq, killing tens of thousands 
of innocent people, creating an explosively dangerous 
environment in the Persian Gulf and substantially 
increasing the threat of terrorism in the United 
States. It simply makes no sense.\" 
 
3.   \"Arrogant Bush sets stage for final U.N. showdown\" 
Editorial page editor Haroon Siddiqui suggested in the 
liberal Toronto Star (3/9) that, \"George W. Bush has 
brought the world to the brink of one war and plunged 
it into another: the war that he is hell-bent on 
unleashing on Iraq, and the other on the diplomatic 
front, where he has torpedoed the Atlantic alliance, 
undermined moderate Muslim allies and is about to sink 
the system of international law that has helped govern 
the world since World War II. For this, we can blame 
Saddam Hussein, of course, but also America - more 
precisely, the Bush administration. Its unmatched 
arrogance, staggering dishonesty and extraordinary 
incompetence at international relations have 
set the stage for the coming week\'s showdown, not 
between enemies but friends.... Since last week, the 
Bush mission has also been about establishing democracy 
in Iraq and liberating Iraqis from Saddam\'s tyranny - 
the strongest moral point in the American arsenal but 
totally ineffective in light of its own past patronage 
of the tyrant, its callous discounting of Iraqi 
suffering under economic sanctions and the fact that 
its bombs will kill many Iraqis before freeing them. 
American disdain for international law 
is also on display in the stepped-up bombing of Iraqi 
defences in and around the north and south no-fly 
zones.... So, the war has begun before it has begun.... 
Meanwhile, the simplest and the most profound questions 
remain unanswered: Why war now, especially when it 
lacks international legitimacy, 
both in law and in the court of world public opinion? 
Why abandon the inspections precisely when they are 
beginning to work? Why risk the entire U.N. system? Why 
risk geopolitical upheaval? More importantly, why risk 
inflicting a humanitarian catastrophe on an already 
crushed people?\" 
 
4.   \"There must be a better \'bastard\'\" 
Former publisher Hartley Steward commented in the 
conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/9): \"Of all the 
bastards in the world available to hate these days, 
surely Americans are the least intelligent choice.... 
In fact, President Bush and his administration, in 
light of the Twin Towers attack, have shown surprising 
restraint. They have tried patiently to explain their 
intent to a world often reluctant to listen. They have 
painstakingly made their case. It is downright absurd 
to direct hatred toward the U.S. as if the world\'s only 
superpower could not be a victim. Absurd and 
transparently opportunistic. The new rules of war, the 
suicide bomber\'s and the terrorist\'s rationale that no 
one is innocent in war, make it entirely possible. It 
is so obvious, one is almost embarrassed to point it 
out: the real object of hatred here is Osama bin Laden 
and his Islamic extremists. We should save our curses 
for the madmen who flew airliners into the Trade Center 
towers, killing innocents who were doing nothing more 
than putting in a day\'s work. We should direct our 
animosity toward rogue states like Iraq who refuse to 
comply with UN disarmament orders; who thumb their 
noses at the free world. We should husband our hatred 
for the psychotic and brutal dictators who rule by fear 
and murder and employ poison gas against their own 
people. We should save our name-calling for those who 
seek and build weapons of mass destruction to let loose 
on the world. It is Saddam Hussein who is the bastard 
here.\" 
 
5.   \"France is a true friend\" 
Foreign affairs columnist Eric Margolis observed in the 
conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/9): \"...It seems at 
times that President Bush is even more 
eager to bomb Paris than Baghdad. In fact, the 
administration has been treating France like an enemy, 
rather than America\'s oldest ally and intimate friend. 
Neo-conservatives even accuse France of anti-Semitism, 
a disgusting slander. Far from being an enemy, France 
has been doing what a true good friend should do: 
telling Washington its policy is wrong and dangerous, 
unlike the handkissing leaders of Britain, Spain and 
Italy, who crave Bush\'s political support, or the East 
European coalition of the shilling, ex-communist 
politicians pandering to Washington for cash.... 
Bush\'s crusade against Iraq will go on with or without 
Turkey. The war will be akin to throwing a grenade into 
a huge hornet\'s nest. France, which lives next to the 
Arab world and has 5 million Muslim citizens, warns an 
invasion and occupation of Iraq will roil the entire 
region, spark more terrorism, and hit Europe with a 
dangerous backblast. But Bush couldn\'t care less, as he 
would say. While Bush prepares war against demolished 
Iraq, he is ducking the surging nuclear confrontation 
with North Korea, which, unlike Iraq, truly threatens 
North America.... America\'s friends and neighbours, led 
by France, the mother of  diplomacy, rightly warn the 
steroidal Bush 
administration to halt its rush to war. President 
Chirac and Foreign Minister de Villepin deserve the 
Nobel Peace Prize. Americans owe France an apology, and 
a hearty \'merci mon ami\'\" 
 
6.   \"The damage done without a shot being fired\" 
Columnist Jeffrey Simpson remarked in the leading Globe 
and Mail (3/8): \"...Those who believe that inspections 
are working and can produce additional positive results 
must concede the point: Inspections would fail without 
a credible threat of force. Or they would make such 
little progress as to mock the latest UN resolution\'s 
demand for \'immediate, active and 
unconditional\' disarmament. You can\'t have one without 
the other, and it is naive to believe otherwise. Saddam 
Hussein\'s regime will never disarm, in whole or in 
part, without the threat of being toppled in a war.... 
The French and most of the world opposed military 
action because they feared its consequences; the 
Americans and their few allies supported such action 
because they feared the consequences of no action. 
Without a shot being fired, enormous damage has already 
been done to the transatlantic arrangements that stood 
these countries in such good stead for so many decades. 
To the Americans, it will seem axiomatic now that their 
great German friends and their perfidious French ones 
will play the anti-American card, so that neither they 
nor the disorganized European Union should be factored 
into future U.S. foreign policy decisions. Nor should 
the 
increasingly irrelevant NATO.... The more the United 
States feels itself abandoned, misunderstood and 
opposed by countries it had counted on as friends, the 
less it will reflect on what it has done to bring about 
this state of affairs than on the weakness, 
unreliability and fecklessness of those erstwhile 
friends whose support is not worth all the bother.\" 
 
7.   \"A deadline fit for the Security Council\" 
The leading Globe and Mail editorialized (3/8): 
\"...[I]sn\'t an ultimatum precisely what\'s necessary? 
Isn\'t the credible prospect of war precisely what is 
needed now to avoid it, by forcing an Iraqi change of 
heart?... Ultimately...the issue isn\'t a precise date. 
It is the need to bring this to a head. Mr. Hussein\'s 
game of cat-and-mouse cannot be allowed to continue. 
And the U.S. and British troops cannot remain 
indefinitely in a state of battle readiness. The 
members of the UN Security Council came together last 
November and unanimously passed Resolution 1441. They 
should come together again early next week and pass the 
resolution giving Mr. Hussein a final deadline of March 
17. War may still be the outcome. But, if so, Mr. 
Hussein will have been given every chance to avoid it.\" 
 
8.   \"The hawks of Iraq\" 
The conservative National Post opined (3/8): \"...We 
concede there are real arguments for opposing war - 
though we do not find them convincing. Peaceniks, 
however, should resist the urge to use Saddam\'s victims 
as props. It is ordinary Iraqis who have the most to 
gain from a U.S.-led invasion, and the most to lose 
should war opponents get their way.\" 
 
9.   \"Enough of the weasel words.\" 
The conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun declared (3/8): 
\"...[L]et\'s give Saddam one last, last chance - an 18th 
resolution giving him until March 17 to disarm - only 
11 days sooner than the March 28 deadline in the 
\'Canadian compromise.\' But then the UN must show 
whether it is relevant. If Saddam chooses not to 
comply, then we believe that even if the war resolution 
fails to gather the necessary nine of 15 Security 
Council votes, or if France, China or Russia vetoes it, 
then the U.S. and Great Britain should lead a coalition 
of willing nations to disarm Saddam. 
He is a tyrant. 
He terrorizes his own people. 
He has attacked three neighbours. 
He has pursued weapons of mass destruction. 
He supports terrorists and terrorism. 
Should he supply chemical or biological weapons to 
terrorists, the world will see a horror that would 
dwarf 9/11. Back down now and the UN will send 
a message to tyrants and terrorists everywhere that it 
is open season on the rest of us. Time to decide.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
10.  \"They could be on their own\" 
Editor emeritus Peter Worthington wrote in the 
conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (3/10): \"...This may 
sound ingenuous, but what America should do seems 
obvious. Dealing with North Korea is even simpler than 
dealing with the South. There\'s growing unrest in South 
Korea against the U.S. military presence which, since 
the ceasefire in the war 50 years ago, has protected 
the South from the North.... Some think America should 
forget about Saddam Hussein and concentrate on bringing 
North Korea to heel. That said, the nasty anti-American 
demonstrations in South Korea demanding the U.S. 
military leave are upsetting.... What\'s hard to 
understand is why the 
Americans stay if South Koreans want them gone. True, 
the majority want American troops handy and know the 
North is up to no good, but the massive protests that 
lambaste the U.S. must irritate the hell out of 
Americans. If I were President George Bush, I\'d be 
tempted to say to South Korea - publicly and bluntly - 
that if you want us gone, we\'ll go; you work out what 
you can with your fruitcake neighbour. That\'d panic 
South Koreans, and restore common sense.... Although 
North Korea\'s nuclear weapons program is no direct 
threat to America, selling nuclear technology to rogue 
regimes and terrorists is. This is all Kim Jong-il has 
to sell.... North Korea wants - demands - direct 
negotiations with the U.S., which, in turn, prefers 
multinational talks that include Russia, China, 
Australia and Japan. Since Kim Jong Il reneges on 
agreements and his word means nothing, why talk? What 
North Korea wants is bribes and payoffs. Blackmail. All 
it has to barter are weapons and soldiers. North Korea 
has no allies, with the possible exception of Cuba\'s 
Fidel Castro.... The soft approach rarely works with 
tyrants. Once Saddam Hussein has been eliminated, North 
Korea should be duck soup, providing President Bush 
doesn\'t waver or waffle.\"

SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ 
 
 
IRAQ 
1.   \"Victory? Not yet\" 
The conservative National Post opined (3/11): \"...The 
truth is that nothing has yet been \'won\' in Iraq - 
notwithstanding the wishful thinking we hear from Mr. 
Chretien, French President Jacques Chirac and the other 
world leaders whose desperation to avoid war is 
blurring into appeasement. The battle will not be won 
until Iraq is fully disarmed - a goal that, more and 
more, would seem to require the removal of Saddam 
Hussein to be achieved.\" 
 
2.   \"Saddam has to go, but we can\'t trust Bush to do 
it\" 
Retired political reporter and columnist Anthony 
Westell observed in the leading Globe and Mail (3/11): 
\"... I\'m in favour of using force if necessary to 
remove Mr. Hussein. But, and here\'s the rub, the man 
who has the force is Mr. Bush, and he, too, I fear, is 
showing signs of megalomania. He loves being a 
president at war. See him strut, hear his bellicose 
speeches to his troops. And remember that Iraq is only 
the first part of his grand strategy. He plans to 
reorganize the Middle East - and, it appears, 
any other part of the world that offends him.... [But] 
how can I reconcile these two views - that we should 
remove Saddam Hussein, by force if necessary, but that 
Mr. Bush is not the man we can trust with the task? My 
answer is probably idealistic. Unless Mr. Hussein 
proves he has disarmed and steps down, I think the 
Security Council should vote to remove him and 
replace his regime with a temporary UN administration, 
using force if necessary, but a measured force, applied 
by troops in blue helmets and under UN command. If Mr. 
Bush agreed to commit U.S. forces under those 
conditions, good. But I know that\'s highly unlikely, 
and there would be no way now to stop him from acting 
alone. In that case, the lesson for the Security 
Council should be that it is time, past time, to create 
a multinational military force able to enforce its 
rulings.\" 
 
3.   \"Saddam doesn\'t have a prayer\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"The Iraqi dictator\'s greatest 
miscalculation was to toy with the Bush administration 
after Sept. 11. Now there\'s no turning back,\" columnist 
Drew Fagan suggested in the leading Globe and Mail 
(3/11) that, \"...It may be that the Bush administration 
gambled from the start - using disarmament as a 
smokescreen for regime change, using the UN to give 
credibility to a fundamentally unilateral policy. If 
so, the pretext is 
falling away. But Mr. Hussein\'s calculations have been 
infinitely more reckless. He has brought on himself 
what appears to be the imminent destruction of his 
government and the occupation of his country. Mr. 
Hussein won\'t have to live with the aftermath. The rest 
of the world does. They should hope that the war that 
now appears all but certain goes as well as 
the Americans have planned. This is one Hail Mary pass 
that, if thrown, must be completed successfuly.\" 
 
4.   \"Tide turns against Bush\" 
Columnist Thomas Walkom wrote in the liberal Toronto 
Star (3/11): \"The Iraq crisis is no longer about 
stopping Iraq. It is about stopping the United 
States.... Most countries outside the U.S. are no 
longer worried about rogue Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Hussein. They are worried about rogue American 
President George W. Bush.... For now it is not Iraq, a 
minor Middle Eastern power, that is in potential 
defiance of the U.N. system, but the mighty U.S. 
In effect, Bush has served notice that the painstaking 
logic of collective security, which the U.S. itself did 
so much to create 58 years ago, is to be junked. War is 
to be no longer a last resort but an active part of 
superpower foreign policy. Decisions on the 
international order are to be made not at the U.N. but 
in Washington alone. The sovereignty of other 
nations is now to be wholly contingent upon U.S. 
geopolitical interests. No wonder the rest of the world 
is nervous. No wonder that France, Germany, 
Russia and (maybe) China have forged their unlikely 
peace coalition.\" 
 
5.   \"Test Iraq\'s will to fully disarm\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/11): 
\"...Obsessed with toppling Saddam, Bush has trotted out 
one dubious rationale after the other for war: 
To destroy weapons the U.N. isn\'t sure Saddam 
possesses. To guard against the possibility he might 
give weapons to Al Qaeda, when no Baghdad-9/11 axis 
exists. To punish Saddam for befriending other 
terrorists. To defend the U.N.\'s honour. To liberate 
Iraqis from a despot. To defend Israel. To safeguard 
oil. To democratize the Mideast. Because 250,000 U.S. 
troops can\'t be kept waiting forever. And now to spare 
Bush an embarrassing climbdown. This dizzy reasoning 
has sown discord at the U.N., in the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization and in the European Union. Bush\'s 
threat to ignore the U.N. has led to criticism that he 
is acting like a scofflaw himself.... The U.N. can 
legitimately demand that Baghdad `disarm\' or face 
attack, as the U.S. wants. But not without defining 
what that implies. And not without giving the Iraqis a 
chance to comply.\" 
 
6.   \"An untutored, unprepared president will be 
running this war\" 
Former Washington correspondent and professor of 
journalism and international affairs at Carleton 
University, Andrew Cohen pointed out in the nationalist 
Ottawa Citizen (3/11) that, \"...[President Bush] hasn\'t 
seen war, as JFK or Truman did, or pondered the future, 
as Lincoln did, which would make him more credible. Why 
won\'t he disavow the interests of oil? Does he 
challenge the hawks? Does he demand more information? 
His lack of perception and curiosity make even those 
who support intervention wish this 
were Al Gore\'s War. He sees Iraq as a question of 
security, pure and simple, and security is a 
president\'s greatest responsibility. The dangers - the 
damage to the United Nations, the alienation of old 
allies, the challenge of Iraq after Saddam - are of 
less consequence. In these matters, he is innocent of 
nuance. Without great experience or knowledge, Mr. Bush 
does have faith. He reads short inspirational homilies. 
Religion allows him to see things in black and white - 
evil or America, peace or chaos - which may be the only 
way to see Saddam Hussein. As he makes the most 
important decision a president can, he is said to be 
keeping his own counsel. In the end he may well do the 
right thing for the wrong reasons in Iraq, and it may 
make him courageous, resolute and wise. One hopes so. 
In the meantime, Mr. Bush on the brink is simply 
frightening.\"

1. Canada supports the U.S. objective, outlined Reftel, to 
reform the WTO budget process and move towards a two-year 
budget cycle, according to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Senior Trade Policy Officer Dean 
Steadman.  Steadman told Econoff that the WTO needs 
\"results-based budgetary and accounting systems\" and feels 
that moving towards a biennial budget process is one of a 
number of reforms that should be considered. Steadman will be 
the GOC point of contact on this issue. 
 
2. Steadman noted that he had raised the issue with the 
Canadian mission in Geneva during a visit last week.  He said 
that although his Geneva colleagues were supportive of the 
idea, they noted that the ongoing Doha round negotiations 
would make it difficult for them or others to focus on WTO 
budgetary reform at this time.

SUBJECT:     CLIMATE CHANGE:  CANADA\'S KYOTO FOLLOW-THROUGH: 
      SPENDING DECISIONS MAY REQUIRE A NEW PROCESS 
 
REF:  02 OTTAWA 3560 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE 
USG CHANNELS 
 
1.    (U) In its FY2003-04 budget, released on February 18, 
the GOC committed C$1.5 billion (about US$1 billion) over 
five years directly to achieving greenhouse gas emission 
reductions (plus modest additional funds for research and 
long-term technology development).  This represents about 
4.3 percent of the new spending promised in the budget 
(which totalled C$34.8 billion over five years, much of it 
for health care). 
 
2.    (U) The budget documents offer no details at all on 
how emission reductions are to be achieved, except that this 
will be done \"with provinces and other partners\" and will 
draw upon \"expert external advice.\"  The lack of detail 
quickly led to predictions that the C$1.5 billion would be 
tapped by various ministers to fund large \"pet projects.\" 
Examples included a long-touted but expensive high-speed 
rail line between Quebec and Ontario, and a major power 
transmission line from Manitoba to Ontario, either of which 
could reasonably be claimed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
 
3. (SBU) Environment Minister David Anderson responded the 
day after the budget by calling for a \"control group\" of 
ministers to be charged with ensuring that the new spending 
flows to projects which are cost-effective in terms of 
reducing emissions.  Speaking to Econoffs on March 6, Don 
Strange of the National Climate Change Secretariat said that 
the GOC was considering options for ensuring such cost- 
effectiveness - possibly through a newly created function 
within the Privy Council Office, which is a policy co- 
ordinating secretariat to the federal Cabinet. 
 
4. (SBU) Strange noted the difficult squeeze between the 
time required to find and implement a suitable decision- 
making process, and the very brief time \"window\" available 
in which to get climate change programs started.  Time is 
short, he said, for two reasons.  First, Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien\'s \"selling\" of Kyoto implementation to Parliament 
and the public during 2002 created high expectations for 
action among stakeholders throughout Canada.  This could 
soon turn to disillusionment and criticism unless real 
programs materialize by mid-2003.  Second, the race within 
the governing Liberal Party to succeed Chretien as Party 
leader will culminate in a leadership convention in November 
2003 and a change of leadership early in 2004.  This 
transition is liable to interfere with policy decisions and 
could derail any programs not implemented by fall 2003. 
 
5. (SBU) PM Chretien\'s show of determination during 
2002 to formally \"ratify\" the Kyoto Accord, which was 
achieved with an act of Parliament in December, was 
intended to display independence from the USG on a 
high-profile, international environmental issue. 
Given Canada\'s comprehensive economic integration 
with the U.S., many of the GOC\'s critics emphasized 
the likely high economic price (and low efficacy) of 
any measure which could push business costs up 
relative to those in the U.S. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  While few details are yet 
available, ironically the pattern of GOC Kyoto 
\"implementation\" thus far looks quite similar to USG 
climate change initiatives - such as announced 
spending on research/development toward emission 
reduction technologies; announced spending on climate 
monitoring/research; and probable further spending on 
new fuel and transportation technologies (notably 
hydrogen fuel cells) and wind power.  GOC policy 
leaders are sensitive to any cross-border 
differential in business conditions, and no doubt 
intend to keep up with (or ahead of) U.S. initiatives 
in each of these industries so as not to miss any 
opportunities.  GOC officials remain enthusiastic 
about U.S.-Canada cooperation on climate change, 
including carbon sequestration.  Environment Minister 
Anderson has also expressed interest in facilitating 
Canadian-based firms\' participation in nascent 
international \"carbon markets.\" 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  One key question still 
unanswered is how the GOC will fulfill a potentially costly 
promise which it made in December (just as its motion 
supporting ratification of Kyoto was being debated in 
Parliament).  The promise was to ensure that industry\'s cost 
of achieving mandated reductions in carbon emissions would 
be \"capped\" at C$15 per tonne.  So far, we have seen no 
indication from the GOC as to how much this promise might 
cost, nor whether it is to be funded from the C$1.5 billion. 
Likewise, as noted in para. 2, there are long-standing 
expectations that the GOC will assist with transportation 
infrastructure and with Manitoba\'s dream of a major new east- 
west power transmission line.  Even making a start in either 
of these areas could absorb all of the GOC\'s new climate 
change funding.  Climate change funding is certainly among 
the areas where high expectations are liable to be 
disappointed in coming months.

SUBJECT: IRAQ/UNSC: CANADA STILL WORKING - AT THE HIGHEST 
LEVELS - TO \"BRIDGE THE DIVIDE\" 
 
REF: (A) USUN NEW YORK 656 (B) OTTAWA 589 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) As seen from Canada\'s proposal for a new UNSC 
resolution on Iraq (reftel A), the GoC continues to be active 
in seeking a compromise solution at the Security Council. 
Officials at the Prime Minister\'s Office (PMO), the Privy 
Council Office (PCO), and Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) have 
confirmed to us that GoC efforts on Iraq are being personally 
handled by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, PCO Foreign Policy 
Advisor Claude Laverdure, and Canada\'s Ambassador to the UN 
Paul Heinbecker.   PMO\'s Paul Genet told the DCM that 
Laverdure has the lead on Iraq.  DFAIT\'s Jon Allen told us 
that Heinbecker had been \"chomping at the bit\" to put forward 
a Canadian proposal at the UN.  PCO\'s Rob Fonberg (protect) 
told the DCM \"there is no question that the Prime Minister is 
in the lead,\" but that the Iraq file is being handled 
primarily by PCO, with only limited input by DFAIT.  Fonberg 
also speculated that Clerk of the Privy Council Alex 
Himelfarb, a staunch multilateralist, has been advising 
Chretien not to do anything in Iraq without UN support, or 
perhaps even with it. 
 
2. (C) Commodore Dan McNeil, Laverdure\'s Director of 
Operations and Strategic Planning, told us that the Prime 
Minister continues to be heavily engaged in lobbying Security 
Council heads of state.  Chretien spoke again with British 
Prime Minister Blair on March 12, and was to speak again 
later that day with Chilean President Lagos and Mexican 
President Fox.  McNeil expressed concern that Lagos might 
support the French position, which Canada found unacceptable, 
and that Mexico was considering a proposal for the UN to 
deploy 50,000 blue helmets in Iraq. 
 
3. (C) McNeil reiterated to us that Canada\'s objectives are 
(1) disarmament of Iraq and (2) the Security Council living 
up to its obligations.  Canada knows the U.S. cannot keep its 
military forces in a holding pattern much longer, he 
continued, and Canada\'s proposal sets a concrete deadline for 
action (April 15) if Iraq does not meet disarmament targets. 
McNeil said Chretien recognizes war is now inevitable, but 
that he must reckon with anti-war sentiment in Canada, 
including in his own Cabinet. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: While Chretien realizes we do not support the 
GoC proposal, he sees the need for a UNSC compromise and will 
remain personally engaged to try to achieve it.  Given 
France\'s determination to veto any resolution sanctioning 
military action, Canada\'s best hope now is for a resolution 
supported by most Security Council members.  Like the 
British, Canada would seize upon such a vote as expressing 
the will of the Security Council, albeit without passage due 
to veto.

IRAQ 
1.   \"The truth that Blix can\'t hide\" 
The nationalist Ottawa Citizen opined (3/12): \"The 
United States and Britain are angry with Hans Blix, the 
United Nations chief weapons inspector in 
Iraq, over the information he deliberately withheld 
from his most recent public report to the Security 
Council. And they\'re right to be. By keeping silent 
about Iraq\'s egregious defiance of the UN, Mr. Blix not 
only strengthened the hand of countries opposed to 
military action against Iraq, he further weakened the 
credibility and legitimacy of the Security Council 
he is supposed to serve.... Hans Blix may not have been 
able to bring himself to say so publicly last week, but 
the case against Saddam Hussein has been made. France, 
Russia and China should not stand in the way of a new 
resolution that would allow that enforcement action to 
begin. They should not stand in the way of truth.\" 
 
2.   \"Bush losing the moral high ground\" 
Columnist Richard Gwyn observed in the liberal Toronto 
Star (3/12): \"...Today, the main concern of large 
numbers of people and of many governments is not to 
disarm Iraq but to disarm the U.S. That\'s, of course, 
impossible in the term\'s literal sense. No one can 
doubt that the U.S. possesses the military capacity to 
successfully invade Iraq almost by itself. 
Psychological disarmament, though, is quite another 
matter. It won\'t affect the political and military 
leaders; George W. Bush\'s self-conviction is absolute 
and adamant. But it may - just - affect American public 
opinion. A lot of people around the world, and an 
increasing number of governments, are acting as though 
it were possible to influence ordinary Americans and 
thereby to influence Bush.... The moral case...is 
tilting decisively against Bush. It\'s the absence of 
effective moral counter-arguments that explains why the 
international scene has changed so decisively so 
quickly. These days Bush is asking the world to trust 
him while he has failed to trust others. He\'s said 
almost nothing about moving to achieve an Israeli- 
Palestinian peace settlement after Iraq is conquered. 
He\'s promised to pursue democracy 
in post-war Iraq but he\'s not invited the U.N., or 
anyone, to help him achieve it. Quite simply, the U.S. 
is increasingly alone these days because it is alone. 
Once that was a good argument for rallying to the U.S. 
side, because without it the U.N. will be largely 
impotent and there\'ll be no-one to police the world\'s 
trouble spots. The counter case is that until the U.S. 
disarms - attitudinally, psychologically and 
temperamentally - better a world doing its best to 
function without it than one trying to keep in step 
with the Americans wherever they march. Today that case 
is the winning one.\" 
 
3.   \"Prelude to war: Lies, deception and insincerity\" 
Columnist Barbara Yaffe commented in the left-of-center 
Vancouver Sun (3/11): \"...[A]n Iraq war was never about 
disarmament, except for the purposes of passing 
resolutions through the United Nations. The war for the 
president is about toppling Saddam. And he hasn\'t yet 
achieved that objective.... In this whole sordid 
process, possibly the most off-putting spectacle has 
been the performance of Mr. Bush. He has put himself 
forward as a reasonable individual, an oasis of 
determined calm amid chaos. This man, who will give the 
order to drop thousands and thousands of bombs on Iraq 
keeps repeating: \'I pray for peace. I pray for peace.\'\" 
 
UN 
4.   \"Kofi\'s dithering shop\" 
The conservative National Post commented (3/12): 
\"...[I]t is the relevance of the United Nations itself, 
under Mr. Annan\'s leadership, that is at 
greatest risk of impairment. France is so desperate to 
thwart U.S. military plans that it is willing to veto 
any war resolution Washington puts before the Security 
Council, and thereby vitiate the 17 existing Iraq- 
related Security Council resolutions that the United 
States is seeking to enforce. Mr. Annan should be 
rallying other members of the Security Council around 
to the U.S. position. If the Secretary-General fails in 
this regard and the United States and Britain liberate 
Iraq without explicit UN approval, Mr. 
Annan may find that no one particularly cares what he - 
or the United Nations - has to say the next time an 
international crisis emerges.\" 
 
5.   \"Turnabout at the UN\" 
The centrist Winnipeg Free Press opined (3/8): \"...The 
new resolution offered by the U.S. and its allies dares 
France and the others to claim that peaceful means of 
disarming Iraq have succeeded, which is obviously not 
the case. It shifts to them the onus of proving that 
Iraq\'s conduct is acceptable. In the interest of 
international peace and security, the main thing is 
that Iraq\'s aggression should not be tolerated. If Iraq 
is allowed to rearm and if economic sanctions are 
lifted, then Iraq will be excused from the consequences 
of its aggression against Kuwait. This will tend to 
reassure other heavily armed nations that they need 
fear no punishment from the UN if they follow Saddam 
Hussein\'s example and invade neighbouring countries. In 
the new resolution, the U.S. is making a further effort 
to conduct its operations against Iraq under the aegis 
of the United Nations. This is both principled and 
tactically wise. The U.S. public and the people of 
other nations much prefer the U.S. to get UN approval 
before it goes to war. President Bush will enjoy much 
better support at home and abroad if he acts with UN 
approval. The interests of Canada and other middle- 
sized countries are best served if the UN continues to 
provide a mechanism in which nations can unite their 
efforts to oppose aggression. Canada should join in 
urging Security Council adoption of this new 
resolution.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
6.   \"Nuclear blackmail\" 
The centrist Winnipeg Free Press commented (3/12): 
\"...Mr. Kim needs a new sponsor and he sees the U.S. as 
the most likely candidate. Because it will not 
willingly subsidize his brutally oppressive and corrupt 
regime, his only recourse is nuclear blackmail. He 
worked that scam successfully with former president 
Bill Clinton; he is having less success with Mr. Bush 
and so can be expected to intensify his efforts to get 
the attention and the cash he craves. Mr. Bush should 
not do as Mr. Clinton did and submit to Mr. Kim\'s 
blackmail - whether the demand is unfettered aid or the 
abandonment of South Korea. Mr. Kim wants to deal only 
and directly with the U.S. This is not just an American 
problem, however; it is a United Nations one, although 
few of that organization\'s members appear to be as 
eager for a multilateral approach to North Korea as 
they are in demanding one for Iraq.\"

bitter disagreements with his own democratic-minded 
colleagues. But he will no doubt be remembered as a 
democratic hero. The best way for Serbians to avenge 
his death is to continue with Mr. Djindjic\'s political 
reforms and anti-crime crusade. As Mr. Djindjic himself 
noted in a tragically prescient interview following a 
botched assassination attempt against him last month, 
the death of the reformer need not necessarily spell 
the death of his reforms.\" 
 
3.   \"Serbia\'s loss\" 
The nationalist Ottawa Citizen declared (3/13): 
\"...Bringing lasting peace to the Balkans was already 
difficult. Mr. Djindjic\'s death makes it even harder.\" 
 
IRAQ 
4.   \"We should sit out this war\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"U.S. credibility on Iraq has 
eroded to an extent that it is becoming hard to believe 
anything from the Bush administration,\" 
editorial page editor Haroon Siddiqui commented in the 
liberal Toronto Star (3/13): \"...The Bush 
administration\'s staggering dishonesty can best be seen 
in the number of times the U.N. inspectors have had to 
shoot down its unsubstantiated assertions. Both Hans 
Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei are seasoned international 
civil servants who understand the value of non- 
partisanship. But they felt compelled to set the record 
straight. 
First, Blix: 
No, his inspectors were not spied on. No, the Iraqis 
could not have had advance knowledge of the sites to be 
inspected. 
No, he did not think Iraqi agents were posing as 
scientists, or that real scientists were being whisked 
out of the country to avoid interrogations. 
No, he found no evidence of Iraqis hiding or moving 
banned materials in or out of the country. 
No, he did not believe that Iraq had cleaned up some 
sites before inspections, as Colin Powell alleged, 
using before and after satellite pictures that Blix 
exposed as having been taken `several weeks apart.\' 
No, the trucks that Powell identified as mobile labs 
producing biological weapons were not in the germ 
warfare business; they were carrying food-tasting and 
seed-processing equipment. 
No, Iraq had not hidden the long-range missiles that 
the inspectors ordered destroyed: `These weapons were 
declared; they were not clandestine.\' 
No, he found no evidence that Iraq was producing and 
storing chemical or biological weapons in underground 
bunkers. 
No, he saw no persuasive evidence of Iraqi links to Al 
Qaeda. \'There are other states where there appear to be 
stronger links.\' 
Now, ElBaradei: 
No, there was no uranium bought from Niger. Documents 
purporting to show that were forged. 
No, the International Atomic Energy Agency found no 
evidence that high-strength aluminium tubes were 
imported for uranium enrichment. Even if they were, it 
was unlikely that Iraq had the capacity to redesign 
them for such usage. 
No, there is no evidence of Iraq using imported high- 
strength magnets in its nuclear program. 
No, there is no evidence of a resumption of \'prohibited 
nuclear or nuclear-related activities.\' 
Despite being contradicted on so many fronts, Powell is 
now saying with a straight face that he has \'new 
information\' that Iraq is building new missiles as the 
inspectors are destroying the old ones. That\'s quite 
possible. But does anyone believe him, or America, any 
more? The evaporation of American credibility is a 
tragedy whose effects may outlast the war.\" 
 
5.   \"Bush\'s so-called rush into battle is anything 
but\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee observed in the leading Globe and 
Mail (3/13): \"- Rush to war? It has been 18 months 
since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, 14 months since U.S. 
President George W. Bush gave his speech naming Saddam 
Hussein\'s Iraq part of an \'axis of evil,\' six months 
since he took his case to the United Nations and four 
months since he secured a UN resolution giving Iraq 
a final chance to give up its weapons of mass 
destruction. If this is a rush, it\'s hard to imagine 
what a crawl would look like.... Whether or not all the 
diplomacy succeeds, no one can say that the United 
States didn\'t go the last mile to get international 
support. Far from plunging into war, Mr. Bush has 
proceeded by careful, deliberate steps.... And if Mr. 
Bush doesn\'t get the UN majority and goes to war 
anyway? Well, at least no one can call it a \'rush to 
war.\'\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
6.   \"North Korea shows how to make the U.S. temper its 
actions\" 
Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe wrote in the left-of- 
center Vancouver Sun (3/12): \"...Because Kim is a real 
military threat and has neighbours - China, Japan and 
South Korea - of importance to the U.S., Washington has 
chosen to negotiate rather than attack. Saddam, on the 
other hand, has no nuclear weapons and might or might 
not be able to account for biological and 
chemical weapons stocks he might or might not have 
had.... Once you have nuclear weapons Washington will 
treat you with caution. So better get the bomb 
quick.... So the way the U.S. administration has 
handled the Iraq-North Korea dichotomy can be seen as 
promoting weapons proliferation rather than containing 
it.... It\'s not necessary to be on Washington\'s hit 
list to feel that in an increasingly uncertain world 
having a nice fat bomb stored in the basement might be 
a good idea.... An arms race in Asia is, of course, 
most likely to happen if Washington\'s allies feel the 
U.S. cannot be depended upon to support its friends as 
it has for the last half century. That development 
seems unlikely now, but who can tell what mood America 
will be in after its Iraqi adventure? Even without a 
spate of proliferation in Asia, the situation between 
the U.S. and North Korea is dangerous enough.... What 
Washington does not seem to have grasped with 
sufficient clarity is that Kim\'s North Korean regime is 
not house-trained. More than half a century of self- 
imposed isolation has bred institutional suspicion, 
paranoia and sheer ignorance about how the world works. 
Kim\'s paranoia roared forth when Bush declared a 
strategy of \'pre-emptive attack\' on any country deemed 
a future risk to America. Washington discovered Kim\'s 
secret nuclear research last year, confirming its view 
 
SIPDIS 
that he could not be trusted.\"

UNESCO in the UN Specialized Agencies Section of DFAIT\'s 
International Organizations Bureau, on March 11.  Poloff had 
a follow-up discussion with Chouinard on March 13.  Chouinard 
said that Canada welcomes the U.S.\'s return to UNESCO. 
2.  (C)  Chouinard indicated Canada will be a candidate for a 
seat on the UNESCO executive board.  He said Canada would 
like our support for its candidacy, and will seriously 
consider giving its support to our candidacy. Chouinard said 
there are a possible 10 candidates for the 5 open Group 1 
seats on the executive board. He identified those candidates 
as France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, Portugal, 
Switzerland, Denmark, the U.S., and Canada. When asked about 
the possibility of Canada supporting a consensus slate of 
candidates, Chouinard responded that experience has shown 
them that such slates aren\'t successful in UNESCO executive 
board elections. Chouinard said the culture of UNESCO isn\'t 
conducive to slates of candidates; in that sense, he noted, 
UNESCO differs from other UN organizations. 
3.  (C)   Chouinard shares our concern that a better balance 
needs to be established in Group 1 board representation 
between EU and non-E.U. states. He feels this will be hard to 
do in the near term, but in the longer term we should work on 
getting the Group 1 states to agree on a different, more 
balanced approach to filling seats. Chouinard is hopeful 
there will be a place for both the U.S. and Canada on the 
executive board, as he thinks we could do a lot of useful 
things if we are serving together. Comment: It is our 
impression from the discussion with Chouinard that Canada 
might agree to join a consensus slate, or to back a consensus 
slate, after other possible members of the slate have been 
identified. End comment.

SUBJECT: CANADA ON NORTH KOREAN AND IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMS 
 
REF: (A) STATE 61830 (B) STATE 65141 
 
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Mary Witt, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S) Canada shares our strong concerns about the North 
Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and believes that Iran 
will be emboldened if North Korea abandons the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).  We discussed reftel messages 
with Marc Vidricaire, Director of the Nuclear and Chemical 
Disarmament Implementation Agency (IDN); Ron Stansfield, IDN 
Senior Policy Advisor; and Joanne Khouryati, North Korea Desk 
Officer.  In the case of North Korea, Foreign Minister Graham 
issued a statement in January deploring the DPRK\'s intention 
to withdraw from the NPT, and reaffirming the central 
importance of the NPT.  Canada has expressed its concerns to 
North Korea privately through its missions in Beijing and at 
the UN, but has little leverage on its own.  Aside from 
continued humanitarian food aid, Canada-North Korea relations 
are at a standstill.  North Korean officials were searching 
for an Embassy site in Ottawa, but the GoC asked them not to 
return when they left in December. 
 
2. (S) Canada prefers to try to pressure North Korea through 
multilateral institutions, but is not encouraged with how 
that is proceeding.  Vidricaire commented that if the UN 
Security Council is not prepared to take credible action - 
and he expects Russia and China to oppose such action - then 
the DPRK will get the wrong message.  The DPRK will still be 
a major focus of the NPT PrepCom in April, but inaction by 
the UNSC will confuse the issue.  Given the importance of 
turning the DPRK around, Vidricaire urged us to consider some 
compromise formula whereby the U.S. and North Korea would 
meet bilaterally on the margins of a multilateral meeting. 
(NOTE: Canada\'s Assistant Deputy Minister for Asia-Pacific, 
David Mulroney, will be in Washington on March 20 and has 
requested a meeting with EAP A/S Kelly.  END NOTE.) 
 
3. (S) On Iran, Canada plans to express concern in its 
statement to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting next week, 
and to follow that up with a demarche on IAEA DG El-Baradei. 
Vidricaire cautioned that El-Baradei has limited personal 
influence on how the IAEA proceeds, as he is beholden to the 
wishes of member states. 
 
4. (S) Now that Iran is being closely watched, Vidricaire was 
concerned that it might choose to follow the letter of the 
law in development of a full-blown civil nuclear program, and 
then be able to convert it to a weapons program on short 
notice at a later date.  Like North Korea, Iran might choose 
a time of crisis, when the U.S. and the international 
community are distracted, to leave the NPT.  Unlike North 
Korea, Iran would then have a large-scale nuclear program, 
and would present a much greater threat.  Vidricaire said the 
IAEA would find it difficult to curb the Iranian program if 
it proceeded in this manner.  He felt that Iran also saw 
India and Pakistan as role models - defying the NPT, bearing 
up under international censure for a number of years, and 
emerging at the other end with nuclear weapons.

1. (C)  Embassy delivered the talking points contained reftel 
to Adrian Norfolk, Deputy Director for Human Rights in 
DFAIT\'s Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and International 
Women\'s Equality Division, on March 12.  Norfolk stated that 
Canada\'s overall objective for CHR-59 is restoration of CHR\'s 
credibility through the improvement of its efficiency and 
effectiveness. Canada will pursue this objective by 
encouraging member states to reduce the number of voted 
resolutions, reduce the total number of resolutions 
(including through biennialisation), and review the 
effectiveness/marginal value of various mechanisms. In sum, 
Canada wants CHR to return to decision by consensus to the 
maximum extent possible, Norfolk said. 
 
2.  (C)  With respect to Canada\'s support for the specific 
resolutions set out reftel, Norfolk responded as follows: 
 
Cuba:  Canada will co-sponsor a resolution on human rights in 
Cuba, provided that the resolution is balanced. 
 
Iraq:  Canada will support a resolution on Iraq. 
 
Middle East:  Canada will consider supporting Middle East 
resolutions only if they are balanced; it will not support 
unbalanced resolutions. 
 
North Korea:  Canada will support a resolution if one is 
introduced. 
 
Zimbabwe:  Canada will support a resolution.  Canada believes 
that the inability of the CHR to consider the situation in 
Zimbabwe was another serious blow to the Commission\'s 
credibility. 
 
Chechnya:  Canada will support a resolution, or chairman\'s 
statement. 
 
Belarus:  Canada will co-sponsor a resolution if satisfied 
with the draft text. 
 
Iran:  Canada will support a resolution if the EU runs one. 
Note: I asked Norfolk if Canada is considering introducing an 
Iran resolution if the EU does not.  Norfolk said there have 
been discussions about this within DFAIT, that MFA Bill 
Graham has a lot of interest in the situation in Iran, and 
that a Canada resolution is a possibility. End note. 
 
Turkmenistan:  Canada will co-sponsor. 
 
Sudan:  Canada will support a resolution on Sudan. 
 
China:  No commitment of support was given for a resolution 
on China, but if the U.S. offers one Canada will strongly 
oppose a no-action motion.

IRAQ 
1.   \"Diplomacy\'s last days\" 
The conservative National Post opined (3/14): 
\"...Barring some blockbuster discovery by the 
inspectors, or an over-the-top sabre-rattling gesture 
from Saddam, the United States and Britain have little 
chance of convincing their opponents on the Security 
Council to explicitly sign off on an invasion - and it 
is only a matter of days before they give up the UN 
procedure entirely. Given the stubborn pacifism of 
France et al., such exasperation is understandable. 
Still, Washington and London should make every effort 
to bring the matter up for a vote at the Security 
Council - even in a losing cause. If they can get the 
minimum nine votes needed to pass the resolution, 
either the French or Russians will be forced to block 
it by exercising their veto power. It will then be 
clear to all who is responsible for the United 
Nations\' slide into irrelevance.\" 
 
2.   \"Bush, Blair must give Iraq time\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (3/14): \"It\'s 
amateur hour at the United Nations. If this is Friday, 
U.S. President George Bush must be pounding home his 
view that Saddam Hussein is \'evil\' and needs to be 
whacked. Or that he threatens New York with horror 
weapons. Or that he\'s gearing to hammer Israel. Or that 
he\'s thumbing his nose at the U.N. Security Council. 
It\'s getting hard to keep track of Bush\'s restless 
rationales for war.... Rarely have American and British 
leaders looked so misguided, so ineffectual and so 
isolated. Meanwhile, Saddam sits in 
Baghdad, gloating. This is what comes of trying to 
bamboozle, bully and bribe an otherwise united Security 
Council into a wrongheaded, needlessly 
rushed war.... Yes, Saddam is a dangerous criminal who 
must be denied nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons. Security Council resolution 1441, passed 
unanimously last Nov. 8, demands that. But it doesn\'t 
mandate what Bush really wants: Saddam\'s ouster. Nor 
does it require Iraq disarm by Sunday, as Bush has 
demanded. And for good reason. Saddam has been held in 
check for 12 years. He does not seriously threaten the 
United States, Britain or any other country. He can be 
contained.... Making war on Iraq must be a last resort. 
It could cost $100 billion, result in tens of 
thousands of deaths and create new recruits for terror. 
That\'s a high price to pay for Saddam\'s head. 
Especially if Baghdad can be disarmed within weeks 
if the Security Council remains united and presses its 
demands. But it\'s amateur hour. This farce isn\'t over 
yet.\" 
 
3.   \"UN must authorize war:\" 
In a CBC Radio commentary (3/12), international affairs 
columnist for the leading Globe and Mail Marcus Gee 
reflected that, \"However the Iraq crisis turns out, one 
good thing has already come out of it. Everybody is 
talking about the United Nations. Suddenly, the U.N. 
matters. Everybody on both sides of the Iraq debate 
agrees on that.... Saddam Hussein has tried for 12- 
years to get weapons of mass destruction, making his 
country an international pariah, putting his people 
through years of sanctions and allied bombing, and 
foregoing tens of billions of dollars in oil 
revenue.... An Iraq armed with weapons of mass 
destruction, and bent on vengeance for its defeat in 
the Gulf War, would present a risk not just to its 
neighbours, but to the whole world. But have all means 
short of war been tried? Again the answer has to be 
yes. We\'ve had 12-years of diplomacy and sanctions and 
every other kind of non-military pressure. None of it 
has worked. The anti-war camp wants more inspections. 
But inspectors will never uncover Saddam\'s weapons if 
he does not want to give them up. And once the threat 
of war comes off, Saddam will simply stop co-operating 
again. The United Nations Security Council has passed 
17- resolutions demanding Iraq\'s immediate disarmament. 
This week it\'s likely to vote on an 18th. This time it 
must make sure its words mean something. If it misses 
this chance to show it can confront real threats to the 
world, the United States and other big powers will 
simply ignore it next time and the institution will 
become a global non-entity.\" 
 
SERBIA 
4.   \"Serb hope shot dead\" 
The centrist Winnipeg Free Press commented (3/14): 
\"...Since the fall of Mr. Milosevic, Serbs have been 
politically apathetic. Twice they have failed to turn 
out in democratic elections in sufficient numbers to 
elect a president. Serbia now has an acting president, 
an acting prime minister, an acute political crisis - 
and a challenge to ensure that the good that Zoran 
Djindjic accomplished is not interred with his bones, 
that his dream of a free, democratic, prosperous Serbia 
does not die with him.\"

SENSITIVE 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, CA, Liberal Party 
SUBJECT: SNAPSHOT OF CANADIAN POLITICS: THE RULING LIBERAL 
PARTY LEADERSHIP CONTEST IS ON 
 
This message is sensitive, but unclassified.  Handle 
accordingly. 
 
1.(U) SUMMARY. Former Finance Minister Paul Martin Jr. filed 
nomination papers for the leadership contest of the governing 
Liberal Party on March 6. At this juncture, Heritage Minister 
Sheila Copps, whose candidacy was declared on the first day 
of the official campaign period, is the only other MP openly 
running for the leadership. Deputy PM and current Finance 
Minister John Manley is expected to toss his hat into the 
ring in the near future.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The Liberals have held power consecutively for a 
decade under the leadership of Jean Chretien, who won three 
successive Parliamentary majorities at general elections in 
1993, 1997 and 2000 ) a rare feat in Canadian politics. 
Nevertheless, the party owes a significant measure of its 
success to Paul Martin Jr. for his strong performance as 
Finance Minister during 1993-2002. 
 
3. (U) The son of a prominent Liberal minister whose own 
prime ministerial ambitions were never realized, Paul Martin 
has been a Member of Parliament for some 15 years.  In 
addition to his natural appeal to the business community (he 
is a successful financier and industrialist in his own right) 
Martin has cultivated important social and environmental 
policymaking credentials.  Moreover, as Finance Minister 
under Chretien, he turned around the nation,s serious budget 
deficit into a surplus within a few years, while 
simultaneously reducing unemployment and inflation )- a feat 
that few &ex ante8 observers thought possible. 
 
4. (SBU) Despite his clear advantage early in the contest, 
Paul Martin seems to be leaving nothing to chance, including 
the timing of the official launch of his campaign in April, 
from his home riding of LaSalle-Emard, Montreal, to 
&maximize the impact8 on vote-getting.  In filing for 
nomination-*which requires paying a deposit of half the 
$75,000 candidacy fee by June 10--candidates get access to 
bulk membership forms (allowing them to enlist new members in 
groups of 100) and Liberal party membership lists that are 
vital to any campaign.  Moreover, in light of the CAD 4 
million ceiling on official campaign expenditures, it is in 
Martin,s interest to delay imposing such a constraint on his 
war chest (he has been touring the country in unofficial 
appearances since his resignation from Cabinet). 
 
THE MARTIN-CHRETIEN DYNAMIC 
--------------------------- 
5. (SBU) A long time political rival of Chretien, Martin,s 
relationship with the Prime Minister has been especially 
tense following their 1990 competition for the Liberal 
leadership.  Martin,s adept handling of the finance 
portfolio -- until that time considered a dead end for 
leadership aspirants -- and his unceasing ambition for the 
party leadership only aggravated the rivalry and culminated 
in Martin,s resignation from Cabinet last summer. 
 
6. (SBU) By that time, the former Finance Minister already 
had developed a seemingly unassailable advantage in political 
reputation and riding-by-riding organization, and an enviable 
campaign war chest.  Although he placed second in the 1990 
leadership contest with only 25 percent of the vote, in the 
intervening years Martin,s supporters diligently gained 
control of key elements of the party machinery, enabling 
their candidate to position well ahead of the pack in the 
current contest.  His personal wealth and an apparent knack 
for fundraising have given Martin the wherewithal to gain 
name recognition and to publicize his credentials well ahead 
of the official campaign season launched February 24. 
 
THE OTHER CONTESTANTS 
--------------------- 
7. (SBU) Although the names of other senior Ministers have 
continued to surface as potential leadership contestants, few 
have taken up the gauntlet seriously. Industry Minister Allan 
Rock dropped out of possible contention in January 2003 and 
Natural Resources Minister Herb Dhaliwal recently indicated 
that he would not run for personal reasons. While Canadian 
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps formalized her intentions in 
February, she is said to have done so primarily at the urging 
of PM Chretien, ostensibly to avoid the appearance of an 
uncontested race for Paul Martin. It is expected that Copps 
will receive a \"golden parachute\" from Chrtien in the form 
of a coveted \"permanent\" patronage appointment before he 
steps down. 
 
8. (SBU) Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, who also 
succeeded Martin in the Finance portfolio, is expected to 
announce his candidacy at some point. Observers speculate 
that he will need to be assured of a strong second place 
finish, in order to position himself for a good job in a 
Martin Cabinet (Finance, Foreign Affairs) and a run at the 
leadership post-Martin (Manley is 53 compared to Martin\'s 
64).  As one Embassy contact commented, a weak finish for 
Manley in a leadership race would not help his political 
prospects, and he likely will want to avoid incurring heavy 
campaign debt. 
 
9. (SBU) COMMENT:  At this time, some 8 months before the 
November convention, Paul Martin is widely deemed the 
probable successor to Chretien, certainly as leader of the 
Liberals and likely as PM following a general election.  His 
organizational lead, combined with personal wealth unmatched 
by other candidates, continue to give him vast advantages in 
the leadership race.  Although his ownership of the 
multi-million dollar Canadian Steamship Lines has been under 
attack as an ethics issue, Martin recently announced his 
intent to cede ownership of the company and implement 
additional transparency measures, in close consultation with 
the current government Ethics Commissioner, to preclude any 
question about his ties to/influence on the company \"should\" 
he become Prime Minister.  END COMMENT.

REF: STATE 57391 
 
1. Canada is concerned about the difficulty of implementing 
EC Regulation 1774/2002 on May 1 and, following receipt of 
Reftel demarche, sent a letter to the EC requesting a delay 
in implementation of the regulation concerning animal 
by-products.  According to the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT) Trade Policy Officer Sudha 
Kshatriya, Canada\'s Deputy Head of Mission in Brussels 
Laurette Glasgow sent the letter to the EC\'s Director General 
for Trade Peter Carl on Thursday, March 13.  Kshatriya said 
that she has been in direct contact with USTR\'s Jason 
Bernstein and has provided him with a copy of the letter. 
 
2. In Fall 2002 Canada raised their concerns about the 
Regulation bilaterally with the European Commission, during 
the November SPS committee meeting, and in a letter from 
Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief to EC Consumer 
Health and Safety Commissioner Byrne.  Kshatriya stated that 
the GOC has come to realize that the representations were not 
successful and that implementation of 1774/2002 was \"a done 
deal.\"  Canada is now focusing on developing an industry 
implementation plan and has been in contact with the EC to 
seek clarification on the complex regulations.  Kshatriya 
noted that the GOC has been working with the US Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service on technical issues related 
to the implementation of the regulations.  Canada has not 
received any derogations from the EC. 
 
3. DFAIT is coordinating an interagency response to Reftel 
demarche, which we will pass along.  Reftel talking points 
were also delivered to Richard Fadden and Paul Haddow from 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

SUBJECT:  DISTANT NEIGHBORS, NORTHERN STYLE: CANADIAN 
OPINION OF THE U.S. 
 
1. Summary and Conclusion. International debate on the war 
on terrorism and impending war in Iraq has raised serious 
concern about \"What the World Thinks\" about the United 
States and its foreign policies.  This is as true for Canada 
as for the rest of the world.  Canada is our largest trading 
partner; shares our longest land border; and has been a 
close ally in two world wars, the Cold War and in the war on 
terrorism.  Implementation of new security measures post 9- 
11, such as NSEERS and visa requirements for Commonwealth 
Landed Immigrants in Canada, as well as perennial bilateral 
trade issues, have given us additional reason to ask how 
Canadians perceive us. 
 
2. This is the first in a series of cables that attempts to 
assess Canadian opinion of the U.S. and public support in 
Canada for U.S. policies.  This report reviews the findings 
of three recent, publicly released Canadian public opinion 
polls.  These polls indicate that we still enjoy a reservoir 
of good will with most Canadians.  But the polls also 
indicate that the international environment post 9-11 has 
drawn heavily on that good will.  The U.S. has a broad and 
complex policy agenda in which Canadian opinion matters. 
The opinion polling results suggest that, as we implement 
our policy agenda, we will need to find ways effectively to 
shore up public support from our nearest neighbors.  End 
Summary and Conclusion. 
 
IRAQ: CANADIAN VIEWS ARE MIXED BUT GENERALLY SUPPORT 
MILITARY ACTION ONLY IF SANCTIONED BY THE UN. 
 
3. The most recent publicly released national poll was 
conducted by the firm Ipsos-Reid on February 28 2003.  It 
finds a slim majority (51 percent) of Canadians saying that 
the UN Security Council has enough evidence to authorize 
military action against Iraq.  This is a small but 
significant shift from a poll conducted 10 days earlier in 
which 52 percent of Canadians said that there was not enough 
evidence to authorize an attack. 
 
4. This does not mean that a majority of Canadians support 
the U.S. position on Iraq.  62 per cent of Canadians in the 
Feb 28 survey continue to believe that Canada should support 
more time for UN inspectors in Iraq to complete their 
mission.  62 percent of Canadians also say that Canada 
should provide assistance for military action in Iraq only 
if the UN decides military action is required. 
 
5. Only 32 percent of Canadians feel Canada should support 
U.S. and U.K. calls for immediate military action to remove 
Saddam Hussein from power.  Even fewer - 18 percent - say 
that Canada should provide military assistance if the U.S. 
decides that military action is required in Iraq without UN 
authorization.  Another 18 percent of Canadians feel that 
Canada should provide no military assistance for any action 
in Iraq, even if authorized by the UN. 
 
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN CANADIAN PERCEPTIONS 
 
6. Canada\'s regions exhibit differing patterns of support 
for the U.S. position on Iraq.  The view that the UN 
Security Council now has enough evidence to authorize 
military action against Iraq is shared by at least half of 
the residents in each region except in Quebec, where only 34 
percent of Canadians hold this view.  When Quebec is removed 
from the national polling, agreement among Canadians rises 
to 57 percent. 
 
7. Of all Canadians, Albertans exhibit the highest level of 
support; 70 percent believe the UN has sufficient evidence 
to authorize military action.  Other western Canadians, 
however, are more strongly opposed.  In Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba, 67 percent (up from 53 percent in the earlier 
poll) now say that Canada should support more time for UN 
inspectors.  Only 28 percent (down from 42 percent in the 
earlier poll) say that Canada should support the U.S./U.K. 
position on the need for military action in Iraq. 
 
A BASELINE OF CANADIAN OPINION OF THE U.S. - THE PEW CENTER 
STUDY. 
 
8. The Pew Center Study, published at the end of 2002, has 
been widely discussed in U.S. and foreign media, including 
the media in Canada.  The study received relatively little 
attention on a country-by-country basis, however.  The 
Study, conducted in July 2002, shows that Canadians hold 
positive attitudes about the U.S.  At 72 percent favorable, 
Canadians held a more positive image of the U.S. than almost 
any other country (among traditional allies, only the U.K. 
was more positive at 75 percent).  That rating by Canadians 
was up one percentage point, from 71 percent, in the 
previous year\'s survey. 
 
9. The Pew Center Study also indicates that Canadians and 
Americans are alike in many of their national perceptions. 
They express remarkably similar satisfaction with their own 
lives.  67 percent of Canadians and 64 per cent of Americans 
are satisfied with their personal lives, far higher levels 
of satisfaction than in other industrialized western 
nations.  Canadians and Americans also express similar views 
of \"progress\" in their countries over the past five years 
(51 percent among Americans, 48 percent among Canadians). 
And they express similar levels of \"optimism\" about the 
future (61 per cent among Americans and 54 per cent among 
Canadians).  Americans and Canadians are significantly more 
optimistic about the future than are western Europeans. 
 
10. Yet there are significant differences in American and 
Canadian perceptions of specific issue areas on the world 
scene.  50 percent of Americans identify terrorism as a 
\"very big\" problem; only 19 percent of Canadians expressed 
that concern.  The Pew Study found a duality of opinion 
among the U.S.\' closest allies in their support for the war 
against terrorism.  Canadian opinion fits that pattern: 68 
per cent of Canadians supported the U.S. led war on 
terrorism; but only 25 percent of Canadians believed that 
U.S. foreign policy \"considers others\" when making 
international policy decisions, including decisions about 
countering international terrorism. 
 
11. Canadians are critical of the U.S. in the economic 
sphere.  68 percent of Canadians believe that the U.S. does 
\"too little to solve problems related to the gap between 
rich and poor countries.\" On issues of pollution and the 
environment, nearly twice as many Canadians as Americans are 
\"worried\" (44 per cent vs. 23 per cent).  While 50 percent 
of Canadians like \"American ideas about democracy,\" 56 
percent of Canadians dislike \"American ideas about business 
practices.\" 
 
12. Canadians have mixed views of U.S. cultural influence 
but they are far less critical than Europeans.  54 per cent 
of Canadians expressed the sentiment that the \"spread of 
American ideas and customs\" was bad.  This compares with 71 
percent in France, 67 percent in Germany and 68 percent in 
Russia.  Yet 77 percent of Canadians \"like\" American popular 
culture.  This compares with 66 percent in France and 
Germany and only 42 percent in Russia. 
 
13. Among western countries, only in Canada does a strong 
majority (77 per cent) express a positive view of 
immigration.  Among other major industrial countries, 
Americans show the next highest level of support for 
immigration; but at 49 percent, American support for 
immigration is far lower than Canadian. 
 
CANADIAN OPINION UPDATE: A NEGATIVE SHIFT? 
 
14. The Pew Center in Canada was conducted by the Environics 
Research Group in July, 2002.  The same firm conducted a 
separate poll with a different set of respondents in 
February 2003.  The two polls were not designed to be 
strictly inter-comparable.  Nevertheless, the findings of 
the later poll may suggest a negative shift in Canadian 
perceptions of the U.S.  The overall Canadian attitude 
toward the U.S. remained favorable.  But at 62 percent, it 
was considerably lower than in August 2002. 
A majority of Quebecers - 54 per cent - for the first time 
held an unfavorable opinion of the U.S., a 20 percent drop 
since August 2002. 
 
15. The polling data from Quebec suggests that, despite the 
decline of separatism as a political issue, there is still a 
significant anglophone/francophone division of opinion on 
international issues.  This is particularly interesting as 
Quebecers often have been viewed as more pro-American than 
other Canadians - particularly in Ontario - because of wide 
support for free trade and American culture.  In another 
twist, the latest poll finds Canadians overall holding more 
positive views of both the U.K. and France than of the U.S. 
77 percent of Canadians hold a favorable view of the U.K. 
compared to 69 percent for France and 62 percent for the 
U.S.  The favorable rating for France in Quebec was 80 
percent compared with 62 percent for the U.K. and 40 percent 
for the U.S. 
 
16. COMMENT. These polling results indicate that Canadian 
perceptions of the U.S. are mixed and dynamic, and that they 
exhibit significant regional differences.  Future cables 
will attempt to assess more anecdotally the extent to which 
Canadian perceptions may reflect deeper sentiments in favor 
of peace and in favor of multi-lateral action; and the 
extent to which such sentiments may translate into \"anti- 
American\" feelings.  END COMMENT.  Cellucci

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PARM, PREL, MOPS, IZ, CA 
SUBJECT: CANADA WON\'T JOIN MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ 
WITHOUT ANOTHER UNSC RESOLUTION 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  Echoing Prime Minister Chretian\'s March 
17 comments in Parliament, Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Lavertu formally notified A/DCM Gerson that, absent another 
UNSC resolution, Canada would not participate in a U.S.-led 
military coalition against Iraq. End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  A/DCM Leslie Gerson and British High Commissioner 
Sir Robert Andrew Burns were advised by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Gaetan Lavertu in a meeting at Canadian Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) on March 
17 that the Canadian government will not join in military 
operations against Iraq in the absence of a new U.N. Security 
Council resolution.  During the meeting Mr. Lavertu made the 
following points: 
 
-- Canada has been clear in stating its deep concern 
regarding Iraq\'s weapons of mass destruction program and its 
continued defiance of calls by the international community 
for it to disarm; it has no illusions about the nature of the 
repressive and brutal regime of Saddam Hussein; 
 
-- It therefore strongly supported the unanimous adoption by 
the UNSC of resolution 1441 with its clear message regarding 
\'serious consequences\' if Iraq failed to disarm; Canada 
recognizes the considerable efforts made by Security Council 
members during these past months - led by the U.S. - to find 
a common way forward in terms of ensuring Iraqi compliance 
with its international obligations; 
 
-- The GOC knows that this has not been easy and has taken 
considerable political time and effort to try to manage this 
issue through the United Nations; it is grateful that this 
effort was made, believing that United Nations Security 
Council is the appropriate forum within which to determine 
this important matter of international peace and security. 
 
--Canada has said that, if there were a clear decision by the 
UN Security Council, it would do its part; it deeply regrets 
the inability of Security Council members to come to 
agreement on the issue of a second resolution, despite the 
efforts made.  Canada did its best to try and bridge the deep 
divisions within the Council and understands why we have 
decided that we now need to act on the serious consequences 
spelled out in 1441; 
 
-- While Canada intends to leave its 1280 military personnel, 
ships and aircraft in the region to continue to contribute to 
the campaign against terrorism, as the Prime Minister stated 
today in the House of Commons, it will not be a member of the 
military coalition against Iraq; 
 
-- In its public messaging the GOC will stress that the issue 
is, and continues to be, about Iraq; its non-compliance; its 
weapons of mass destruction and its grudging cooperation with 
the inspectors, even in the face of Security Council 
unanimity and the build up of military forces in the region. 
Iraq bears the responsibility for the consequences of its 
actions and continued violation of international law.  Canada 
will also say that it has decided not be a member of the 
military coalition and will concentrate its efforts in the 
campaign against terrorism - through its ships in the Gulf 
and its forthcoming contribution to ISAF in Afghanistan; 
 
-- Canada\'s commitment to the coalition effort under 
Operation Enduring Freedom is undiminished and the horror of 
September 11th is still fresh in its minds; 
 
-- Canada is also preparing to play a major role in the 
continued stability and security of Afghanistan, through 
ISAF; this summer it will deploy a Battle Group to 
Afghanistan for a twelve-month period; Canada believes that 
these tasks are more important than ever; 
 
-- Canada will also do its part in humanitarian assistance 
and post conflict resolution in Iraq, but believes that these 
activities must take place under the auspices of the United 
Nations. In this respect the GOC would urge Council members 
to work assiduously to come to agreement within the Council 
on this important aspect of the Iraq crisis; in this way all 
members of the international community will be able to make 
their contribution to improving the lives of the 
long-suffering Iraqi people. 
 
2. (U) We note that Prime Minister Chretien first announced 
his government\'s position earlier in the day during the 
regular question period in the House of Commons. To loud 
applause from the Liberal Party majority, Chretien said 
Canada would not participate in military action against Iraq 
unless a new Security Council resolution authorized such 
action. He claimed no country has worked harder than Canada 
to bridge the gap between factions in the Security Council. 
The Prime Minister also repeated statements he had made in a 
March 9 appearance on an American news program, that there 
was no need to go to war because Saddam is now surrounded and 
monitored by UN weapons inspectors. 
 
3. (U) Prime Minister Chretien also indicated that Canadian 
naval vessels carrying out escort and surveillance duties in 
the Arabian Sea as part of the war against terrorism will 
continue on those assignments.  Rejecting suggestions that 
the vessels might be reassigned to take part in a war with 
Iraq, Chretien referred to the present mission of the vessels 
as an important one for the Canadian navy. He also said that 
a very small group of Canadian military personnel who are 
assigned through exchange programs to British and American 
units in the region are not in combat roles, and will not be 
removed. 
4. (C) Comment:  The Prime Minister\'s statement today 
regarding the need for a second Security Council resolution 
was a departure from Canada\'s previous waffling on whether a 
second resolution would be necessary for Canadian 
participation in military actions against Iraq.  In 
justifying his government\'s decision  not to join in military 
action against Iraq, Chretien pointed to the failure of the 
latest British proposal to gain any traction in the Security 
Council in recent days as \"very important\". During his 
meeting with the A/DCM, however, the Deputy Foreign Minister 
stressed that, even though they remain unable to endorse 
military action on the basis of resolution 1441 alone, Canada 
remains a strong friend and ally of both the United States 
and the U.K.  Canada, in its public statements, will voice 
its understanding of any action we undertake and will 
continue to place the blame on Iraq.  We will not, he said, 
hear criticism or doubts expressed by Ottawa. 
 
6. (C) Comment Continued: Following the meeting, Political 
Director Jim Wright emphasized that, despite public 
statements that the Canadian assets in the Straits of Hormuz 
will remain in the region exclusively to support Enduring 
Freedom, they will also be available to provide escort 
services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly 
useful to the military effort. The two ships in the Straits 
now are being augmented by two more enroute, and there are 
patrol and supply aircraft in the  UAE which are also 
prepared to \"be useful.\"  This message tracks with others we 
have heard.  While for domestic political reasons and out of 
a deep-seated Canadian commitment to multilateralism the GOC 
has  decided not to join in a U.S. coalition of the willing, 
they will refrain from criticism of our actions, express 
understanding, and focus their public comments on the real 
culprit, Iraq. They are also prepared to be as helpful as 
possible in the military margins, an aspect of their role 
which we intend to clarify.

Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International

support in keeping the Iraq debate out of the UNGA and UNCHR. 
Wright pledged that Canada will not be drawn into such UN 
\"side shows\" and will work, as appropriate, to discourage 
such initiatives on the part of others.  Canada\'s record in 
promoting the UNCHR as a forum for serious debate was as 
solid as they come, and it believed that any UNGA special

Summary 
------- 
 
1. The Canadian-U.S. border is a key life-line in the 
functioning of a large part of our economy.  The economic 
relationship between Canada and the United States is 
unparalleled.  It is the largest merchandise trade 
relationship in the world with over US$1.1 Billion in goods 
crossing the border every day, with Canada enjoying a 
surplus.  Any heightened security effort along the border 
should take into account how to minimize economic disruption 
to our economy, for instance, by ensuring that FAST, CT-PAT, 
NEXUS and other secure, facilitative systems operate 
efficiently.  Private sector groups that depend on trade 
across the border, such as the automobile industry, have 
asked for guidance on what to expect if the U.S. moves to a 
code \"red\" terrorism threat level.  The Embassy strongly 
suggests as full coordination as possible among federal, 
state, provincial and municipal authorities, as well as key 
industrial sectors.  U.S. and Canadian industry agree: their 
operations can be modified if necessary to accommodate 
security concerns - it is unexpected actions of undetermined 
duration that causes the most havoc in trade flows, not 
increased security measures by themselves.  End summary.

American and Canadian Economic Security Intertwined 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2. The stakes are large: Thirty-five American states have 
Canada as their leading export market. Total two-way trade 
in goods between the US and Canada is larger than total US 
merchandise trade with the entire 15-country European Union. 
In 2001, merchandise trade between the two countries was 
US$383 billion, translating into over US$1.1 billion in 
goods crossing the border every day. 
 
3. The US traded US$223 billion in goods with the province 
of Ontario alone in 2001 - only US$11 billion less than 
total goods trade with Mexico.   Michigan alone conducted 
US$62 billion of trade in 2001 with Canada.  Twenty three 
percent of all US merchandise exports go to Canada.  The 
bottom-line is Canada is our largest market, accounting for 
three percent of US GDP, and we are Canada\'s largest market, 
accounting for over 30 percent of its GDP. 
 
4. About 65% of this trade (by value) in goods is 
transported across the border by truck, 16% by rail, 9% by 
pipeline, 8% by air and 2% by marine.  The border 
infrastructure can be a massive bottleneck.  Three border 
crossings, the Windsor ON -Detroit MI Ambassador Bridge, the 
Fort Erie ON - Buffalo NY bridge, and the Sarnia ON - Port 
Huron MI bridge account for approximately US$160 billion 
annually, or nearly 65% of the value of all the truck-borne 
commerce between the two countries. Below are some examples 
of trade interdependencies in key sectors. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Automotive Manufacturing & Just-in-time delivery 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. The massive North American automotive manufacturing 
sector is unalterably integrated across the Canada-U.S. 
border.  Michigan and Ontario\'s automotive industries are co- 
dependent, exchanging close to US$47 billion worth of 
automobiles, trucks, and auto parts in 2001.  A key feature 
of this integration is \"just-in-time\" delivery and inventory 
management (Ref A).  In practice this means that assembly 
plants do not have warehouses, but rely on the hourly 
arrival of deliveries, the majority of which are intra- 
company transfers.  Significant border delays wreak havoc on 
this finely-tuned system.  In the case of 9-11 and 
subsequent days in 2001, because of border closures, some 
assembly lines shut down for hours, and a few plants shut- 
down for a day or longer - albeit the border closure also 
coincided with an existing slump in the auto industry.  The 
auto industry has told us they fully support all necessary 
security measures, but they also strongly urge us to 
remember that the more information we can provide them, the 
easier than can adjust their methods to changed 
circumstances. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Produce, Fish, Meat and Livestock 
--------------------------------- 
6. US exporters are the dominant suppliers of Canadian 
agricultural imports, accounting for nearly two-thirds of 
the total, while Canadian exporters ship more than half of 
their agricultural exports to the United States.  Canadian 
exports of perishable food items, namely fresh and frozen 
meats, fruits and vegetables are vulnerable to spoilage and 
deterioration under lengthy border delays.  Major delays can 
also severely affect the health of livestock in transit. 
About 7.0 million live cattle and hogs are exported to the 
United States annually. Almost 2.5 million of these are 
destined for U.S. processing plants whose operations are 
heavily dependent on the timely availability of Canadian 
animals. According to the Ontario Food Terminal, Canada\'s 
largest produce terminal, virtually all U.S. exports of 
fresh produce to Canada are by truck. Rather than return to 
the United States empty, the trucks commonly return with 
backhaul. In fact, their original departure from U.S. points 
is often dependent upon timely backhaul arrangements. 
Canada exports about US$1.8 billion worth (FDA estimated 
retail value in 2001) of fresh and frozen seafood to the 
United States.  The major metropolitan markets of the 
eastern seaboard are particularly conspicuous consumers of 
Canadian products and delays of only a few hours 
significantly diminish the quality and marketability of 
fresh/live seafood. 
 
------------------------- 
Critical Medical Products 
------------------------- 
 
7. Disruption to the timely and reliable supply of essential 
medical isotopes from Canada to the United States could 
result in the cancellation of some of the approximately 
36,000 medical diagnostic procedures conducted daily or in 
the cancellation of treatments for cancer.  An Ottawa-based 
company, MDS Nordion, is America\'s largest supplier of 
medical isotopes, highly time-sensitive products.  This 
company\'s products include molybdenum-99, an isotope for 
diagnosis used in about 80% of nuclear medicine procedures, 
and \"radio-iodine\" (iodine-131) used for diagnosing and 
treating thyroid conditions including cancer.  Due to their 
short radioactive half-lives, any delay in transporting 
these isotopes, even if it is for a few hours, can have a 
serious impact on their reliability for diagnostic and 
therapeutic purposes. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Critical Professionals: Health care workers 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8. Many Canadian nurses work at hospitals in Detroit and 
live in Windsor Ontario.  In the wake of 9-11, Detroit 
hospitals suffered due to border delays that prevented staff 
from making it to work.  To continue to function, hospitals 
in the U.S. took special steps to arrange transportation for 
staff coming from Canada. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Concern About \"Threat Level Red\" 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. Industry and transportation associations on both sides of 
the border have expressed concern about possible confusion 
and resultant border delays if the U.S. moves to Threat 
Level Condition Red.  Representatives of the automobile 
manufacturers, among others, have asked for specific 
information about what they could expect under threat level 
red.  Lacking other information, the American Trucking 
Association has posted its own interpretation of what 
truckers can expect to encounter. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. We recognize that specific information about what to 
expect under various threat scenarios is difficult to 
provide.  Speculation aside, these days of heightened 
tension seem a good time to point out that it is in the 
interest of ourselves and the Canadians to maintain travel 
and trade across the border, consistent with security needs. 
There is no question on either side that the border should 
remain open for legitimate purposes, but closed to 
terrorists.  A major motivation for business and other 
frequent users to enroll in FAST, CT-PAT and NEXUS has been 
to support this goal by simplifying border use while 
enhancing security.  We have worked for more than a year and 
a half through the Smart Border Action Plan to make the 
border smart and secure.  Our challenge is to maintain this 
in the high threat environment that lies ahead.

was not a requirement that CRTC address this issue of access 
to \"lite\" Internet service.  However, the CRTC is currently 
reviewing the application and follow-on submissions and would

SUBJECT: CANADIAN PATENTS: MAINTENANCE FEE APPEAL UPHOLDS 
PATENT PROTECTION 
 
REF: LAITINEN/CHANDLER EMAILS 
 
1. Summary - A March 2003 Canadian Federal Court decision 
upholds an appeal to protect the patent rights of companies 
that had inadvertently paid incorrect annual maintenance fees 
and attempted to correct the mistake through subsequent 
\"top-up\" fees.  The judge determined that the appropriate 
annual maintenance fee throughout the life of the patent will 
depend on size of an entity at the time a patent application 
is filed, and does not need to be redetermined each year to 
account for the company\'s growth. The Canadian Intellectual 
Property Office is reviewing the court decision and is 
expected to publish official guidance within the next couple 
of weeks. This is a victory for U.S. entities that were 
concerned that their Canadian patent rights would be deemed 
irrevocably abandoned due to past adjustments.  End Summary. 
 
 
--GOC REGULATIONS ON MAINTENANCE FEES-- 
 
2.  Under the Canadian Patent Act, a patent applicant or 
patentee must pay prescribed amounts, called maintenance 
fees, on an annual basis in order to keep the application or 
patent in good standing. In order to encourage small 
enterprises and promote innovation, the Patent Act permits 
\"small entities\" to pay reduced maintenance fees. Although 
the patent rules are complex, generally speaking a small 
entity is defined as an entity that employees 50 or fewer 
employees or that is a university. 
 
3.  The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO) handles 
the administration and processing of patents and other 
intellectual property, but patent owners bear the onus of 
determining their own entity status, and must accordingly pay 
the appropriate fee to CIPO based on this determination. 
According to the patent rules, failure to pay the appropriate 
maintenance fee results in the patent being deemed abandoned 
at which point the patentee has twelve months to reinstate 
such rights.  Failure to reinstate within the statutory 
period results in the irrevocable loss of the patent rights. 
The regulations are clear and have been consistently applied 
when entities fail to pay any fees within the statutory 
period.  The regulations do not address the situation whereby 
a \"large entity\" inadvertently determines that it qualifies 
as a \"small entity,\" or grows in size without correspondingly 
adjusting its annual payments. There is no penalty if an 
entity overpays. 
 
4.  It had been the long-standing policy of CIPO to accept 
\"top-up\" maintenance fee payments from companies to correct 
underpaid submissions.  A patent holder who notified CIPO 
that its entity status had changed from small to large could, 
at any time, correct an originally insufficient payment by 
paying the difference between the small and large entity fees 
for the years that payments had been incorrectly made.  Under 
this practice the payment of a small entity fee when a large 
entity fee was required did not trigger a \"deemed 
abandonment\" determination of the patent rights. 
 
--2001 JUDICIAL DECISION CHANGES CIPO PRACTICE-- 
 
5.  An August 2001 Federal Court of Canada decision put a 
stop to the practice of allowing \"top-up\" fees after the 
twelve-month reinstatement period. In the dispute between 
Dutch Industries and Barton No-Till Disk Inc/Flexi-Coil Ltd., 
the judge ruled that CIPO had no jurisdiction to \"accept 
corrective payments on account of the failure to pay the 
prescribed maintenance fees within the required time.\" CIPO 
issued an official notice on September 24, 2001, stating that 
they would \"not accept any corrective payments which are 
submitted after a due date.\" Patent holders who had 
previously made \"top-up\" payments to correct errors in the 
determination of their entity status risked losing their 
patent rights. Barton and Flexi-coil appealed the decision. 
 
--APPEAL UPHELD: TOPPING-UP NOT NECESSARY-- 
 
6.  On March 7, 2003 a Federal judge upheld the appeal on the 
grounds that the original decision was based on the incorrect 
premise that the size of an entity must be redetermined 
whenever a maintenance fee is due.  She ruled that \"a person 
who meets the definition of  small entity, when the patent 
regime is first engaged maintains that status in relation to 
that patent application and any resulting patent throughout 
its term.\" If a company expands beyond the definition for a 
\"small entity\" it is still only required to pay maintenance 
fees for its original scale (small entity), and does not need 
to \"top-up\" to account for its growth. If, however, a company 
inadvertently applies for its original patent application as 
a \"small entity\" when it is actually large, then it,s patent 
will be deemed to have been abandoned from the beginning. 
Copies of the Court\'s decision can be found on the web at: 
http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2003/2003fc al121.html. 
 
7.  CIPO is currently reviewing the appeal decision and 
expects to publish an official notice regarding changes in 
procedure within the next few weeks. CIPO officials told 
Econoff that although they are still digesting the details of 
the ruling, the decision clarifies that the appropriate 
maintenance fee throughout the life of the patent will depend 
on size of an entity at the time a patent application is 
filed, and does not need be redetermined each year to account 
for the companies growth. This is a victory for entities that 
faced the potentially catastrophic consequences of having 
their patent rights deemed \"irrevocably abandoned\" due to 
past adjustments.

SUBJECT: Ontario Declares SARS Health Emergency 
 
Ref: State 072824 
 
1.  Summary:  Late on March 26, the province of 
Ontario, faced with growing numbers of cases of 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), 
officially declared a \"provincial emergency.\" 
This represents a dramatic upgrade of measures to 
contain the potential spread of SARS in the 
greater Toronto area, the epicenter of Canada\'s 
SARS cases.  In the last several days, \"probable\" 
case numbers have jumped to 62, according to 
March 27 \"Globe and Mail\" reports, making Ontario 
the largest disease site outside Asia. 
Provincial emergency responses and powers include 
(so far voluntary) quarantine orders, potentially 
for thousands of residents and scores of 
emergency medical workers - which could slow 
responses to `911\' calls; the closing of critical 
care units in two major hospitals; round-the- 
clock monitoring by a new Provincial Operations 
Center; and an intense effort to track workers 
and visitors to Scarborough Grace, the hospital 
where Toronto\'s three SARS fatalities were 
treated.  Post will send proposed Public 
Announcement text via Septel. End summary. 
 
Multi-ethnic Metropolis Potentially Vulnerable 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  Toronto, Canada\'s most populous urban center 
with the nation\'s largest and most diverse ethnic 
and immigrant populations - including one of the 
largest Chinese populations outside Asia - has 
been hit with the majority of the country\'s 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) cases, 
including its three fatalities to date.  With 
high travel rates to and from Asia\'s vulnerable 
areas - the March 26 \"Toronto Star\" reports 
outbound travel from Toronto\'s Pearson 
International Airport to southeast Asia at more 
than 1,000 passengers daily - the SARS risk 
potential is clear.  The Toronto district of 
Scarborough, with notable concentrations of Asian 
populations, is the focal point of concern and 
attention.  Scarborough Grace Hospital, where the 
three SARS fatalities were treated, was 
completely closed on March 26, while a near-by 
elementary school has also closed as a 
precautionary measure. 
 
Current Profile - A Four-fold Jump in \"Probable 
or Suspect\" Cases 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  According to the City of Toronto\'s March 25 
SARS Backgrounder, prominently posted on 
Toronto\'s government website, health officials 
report that, of the three fatalities, two were 
related and had traveled to Hong Kong, while the 
third, according to the \"Star,\" had shared the 
same hospital observation room with the one of 
the two family victims.  As of March 25, the city 
backgrounder referred to 15 \"probable\" and five 
\"suspect\" cases.  Two days later, the March 27 
\"Globe and Mail\" and the CBC report an increase 
of \"probable cases\" to at least 62 persons, 
including a number of health care workers from 
Scarborough Hospital. 
 
Multi-front Response: Institutional Closings and 
Quarantine Orders; Could Slow `911\' Response 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4. Under Ontario\'s emergency powers stemming from 
its \"Health Protection and Promotion Act\" invoked 
on March 26, an extensive quarantine search and 
order is underway, targeting the potentially 
\"thousands of people\" who visited, worked, or 
were treated at Scarborough Grace Hospital from 
March 16 onward.  In addition, the province\'s 
\"Emergency Plan Act,\" also invoked, authorizes 
the use of emergency funds for disaster response, 
if needed.  With SARS now designated a 
\"reportable, virulent, communicable disease,\" 
this designation empowers public health officials 
to prohibit those suspected of SARS from 
\"engaging in activities that may transmit\" the 
disease.  According to media, individuals must 
voluntarily place themselves under a 10-day home 
quarantine and wear a protective mask when 
interacting with family members. 
 
5. The quarantine includes, according to CBC 
reports, an estimated 50 ambulance staff and 
paramedics who either had contact with victims, 
or have exhibited possible symptoms of SARS. 
Provincial emergency officials advised residents 
to continue to use the \"911\" number but indicated 
that response times may be slow. 
 
6. Two major hospitals have been closed or 
restricted in the past 24-48 hours.  Scarborough 
Grace Hospital staff told us that the facility is 
completely closed, with access barred by masked 
security personnel.  In downtown Toronto, Mount 
Sinai, the city\'s premier medical facility, 
closed its intensive care unit and emergency room 
services, according to a hospital public affairs 
officer.  The precautionary closure stems from 
the fact as reported in the March 27 \"Globe and 
Mail\" that a possible SARS patient was 
transferred to Mount Sinai\'s acute care unit from 
Scarborough over the weekend. 
 
7.  Working with Canadian federal and Toronto 
municipal health personnel, Ontario\'s Ministry of 
Health and Long-Term Care announced March 26 
additional tracking and containment measures 
including: 
 
-- Planning to increase Ontario\'s isolation bed 
capacity, potentially using new, unopened 
facilities as a way to isolate patients with 
symptoms; and 
 
-- Partnering with the City of Toronto in efforts 
to identify a \"broad sweep of people\" who 
may have come into contact with SARS sufferers. 
 
Canada Issues Health Travel Advisory while 
Ontario Implements Health Protection and 
Promotion Act Powers 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  Health Canada, the nation\'s federal health 
ministry, issued a March 25 travel advisory which 
recommends that persons \"defer all travel until 
further notice to Hanoi, Hong Kong, Guangdong, 
and Singapore.\"  In addition, federal health 
officers are distributing SARS information cards 
to passengers arriving at Toronto\'s Pearson 
International Airport from Asian ports of 
embarkation.  According to a pre-clearance 
contact at Pearson International Airport, airport 
personnel, including U.S. and Canadian inspection 
officers, are not yet receiving protective gear 
or working under special handling rules, although 
individual services have counseled staff on SARS 
characteristics. 
 
Multiple Info Sites and Free Clinics 
------------------------------------ 
 
9. Area residents or travelers concerned about 
SARS can contact a variety of information 
resources sponsored by all three levels of 
government.  The public can call the province\'s 
Telehealth Ontario hotline, 1-866-979-0000 and 
Toronto Public health Hotline, 416-338-7600 for 
clinical information and advice.  In addition, a 
downtown Toronto clinic affiliated with the 
respected Sunnybrook and Women\'s College Health 
Sciences Center opened today offering assessments 
on a walk-in basis to any individuals worried 
about the disease. 
 
Comment:  Province, City Taking SARS Very 
Seriously 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10.  Far from minimizing SARS concerns that could 
potentially affect business or tourist travel to 
Canada\'s leading city, health authorities are 
using whatever legal, research, and public 
outreach tools they have to educate the public, 
isolate symptomatics, and respond to this 
unfolding disease profile.  But given a 
metropolitan population close to five million and 
strong Asian ties and travel patterns, the 
difficulty of enforcing extensive quarantine 
orders, as well as medical uncertainty over the 
disease\'s etiology and clinical transmission 
specifics, it is too soon to know whether Toronto 
is over the worst. 
 
11. MINIMIZE considered.

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. There remains considerable political support for a 
mandatory labeling scheme by many Liberal party 
backbench Members of Parliament.  This fact, coupled 
with the news that the effort to produce a voluntary 
biotech labeling standard is moribund may lead to a 
recrudescence of the issue and new pressure for 
government mandated action.  But an about face in 
Canadian government policy is unlikely since the PM and 
his cabinet continue to support voluntary, rather than 
mandatory, labeling. End summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Government and Parliamentary Activity 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. Prime Minister Chrtien, his senior advisors and the 
members of the Cabinet (in particular the ministers of 
Health, Agriculture and Industry) support voluntary 
labeling.  They remain engaged on this file and are 
aware of USG concerns and implications of divergent 
labeling policies.  Despite the Cabinet agreement on 
this issue, there remains significant support for 
mandatory labeling among the rank and file members of 
the Liberal caucus.  (Ref A) 
 
3. Indeed, another mandatory labeling bill (Bill C-220) 
was introduced in the House of Commons in October 2002. 
A reincarnation of Charles Caccia\'s Bill C-287, which 
caused so much concern in autumn 2001 (Ref B), the bill 
was spiked when it passed through a government- 
controlled committee in parliament who decided it did 
not meet the criteria to be eligible for a vote in 
parliament (among other things, it would have had to 
have been a revenue neutral proposition and not 
disruptive to reigning government policy).  This bill 
cannot be resubmitted for the rest of this 
parliamentary session (which will conclude only at the 
next election probably about 24 months from now). 
 
4. With respect to parliamentary committee action, the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-food released its report examining the impact of 
mandatory and/or voluntary labeling of transgenic foods 
on farmers and the agri-food industry in June 2002. 
The brief report\'s four recommendations support the 
maintenance of a voluntary labeling approach toward 
biotech foods (Ref C). 
 
5. The Standing Committee on Health, however, which had 
the initial ministerial mandate to study this issue, 
had suspended its investigation into this matter in mid- 
April 2002 due to other more pressing commitments.  The 
Committee recommenced its study on March 26, 2003. The 
Health committee has been less receptive to the 
voluntary approach.  Its final report (due possibly 
before the Codex Committee on Food Labeling in Ottawa 
in May) will likely be less consistent with the USG 
position than the Agriculture Committee report. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Voluntary labeling standard appears moribund 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. The government has from the start hoped that a 
voluntary standard developed by a broad array of 
stakeholders will serve to diffuse the pressure for 
mandatory labeling found among many the rank and file 
Liberal members of parliament.  The voluntary labeling 
initiative has, however, been a slow and unsteady 
process.  And things continue to unravel in the three 
and a half year old process, which was anticipated to 
require only 18 months to conclude (it began in 
September 1999). 
 
7. Doryne Peace, chairwoman of the Canadian General 
Standards Board (CGSB) committee on voluntary labeling 
has warned that her committee may have to throw in the 
towel for lack of progress.  Consensus on the proposed 
standard has not been achieved and no party is willing 
to budge from their entrenched positions to accommodate 
a successful resolution to the impasse. 
 
8. Observers agree that a failure of the voluntary 
standard effort will likely reinvigorate the effort 
within the backbench ranks of the Liberal caucus to 
establish a mandatory labeling law, nevertheless every 
indication is that the government will continue to 
oppose a mandatory labeling policy.

SUBJECT: CANADA-IRAQ: WHAT NOW? 
 
REF: OTTAWA 892 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen R. Kelly, Reason: 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY.  Ambassador Cellucci\'s widely reported 
expression of U.S. disappointment over official Canada\'s 
position on Iraq and the military campaign has precipitated a 
tidal wave of response.  While senior Cabinet ministers 
clearly got the message and want to turn things around in the 
bilateral relationship (reftel), as does the Liberal Party\'s 
heir apparent, it remains unclear whether Prime Minister 
Chretien - the key decision maker in this case-- is willing 
to rein in the left wing of his party and buck public 
opinion, which he sees as solidly in the anti-war camp.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C/NF) The world has changed dramatically over the last 
several years, and Canada has been taking stock of its 
foreign policy.  Canadians are acutely aware of and sensitive 
to their dependence upon the U.S. for economic prosperity and 
national security, but are also driven by a historic 
imperative to assert a Canadian identity that clearly sets 
the country apart from America.  While not visceral 
anti-Americanism in a classic sense, it does color government 
foreign policy decisions.  In recent months, senior officials 
from the Prime Minister down have cited \"Canadian 
sovereignty\" and \"the Canadian way\" to the House of Commons 
as justification for any number of positions, some of them 
quite contradictory.  Moreover, it is unclear that the 
Canadian leadership and public understand, at a fundamental 
level, the implications of the 2001 terrorist attacks on 
America and the depth of U.S. commitment to preventing a 
recurrence of such attacks.  These are some of the factors in 
Canada\'s ambivalent approach to Iraq from the beginning.  The 
particular leadership style of Jean Chretien, who has 
announced he will retire in February 2004, is another element 
in Canadian waffling on Iraq. 
 
3. (C/NF) The identity confusion notwithstanding, it appears 
that many Canadian officials assumed that Canada\'s stance on 
Iraq did not \"really\" matter in the larger scheme of things 
and that our relations would revert to business as usual once 
the flap over their non-participation in Iraq blew over. 
Chretien\'s resolute silence when members of his staff or the 
Liberal Caucus -- including a Cabinet minister -- publicly 
made disparaging comments about the United States and the 
President seemed to play to that assumption.  Thus, the 
Ambassador\'s March 25 remarks at a Toronto business forum, 
voicing U.S. disappointment over Canada\'s position on Iraq 
and comportment regarding the war, gave attentive observers a 
much needed jolt and loosed a hail of I-told-you-so media 
commentary and broad speculation about the consequences of 
U.S. disappointment. 
 
4. (C/NF) Canadian media have played out the reactions for 
most of the week, including the interesting conclusion of 
Liberal pollster Michael Marzolini (CEO of Pollara Inc.) that 
had Jean Chretien decided to support the United States, 
Canadians would have swung behind him and accepted military 
action in Iraq.  He told a Toronto audience that in asking 
whether \"Canadians accept war, (albeit) reluctantly and 
grudgingly,\" instead of whether they \"want\" war, he found 
that a small majority actually favored Canada\'s participation 
in the Iraq conflict.  This majority was on a par with the 56 
percent approval Pollara registered for participation in the 
Kosovo conflict four years ago, which Canada entered without 
UNSC approval.  The question is whether Marzolini\'s newly 
revealed conclusions, in addition to the Ambassador\'s 
comments, might stir up public opinion enough to convince the 
Prime Minister of the need to change tack. 
 
5. (C/NF) On foreign policy PM Jean Chretien calls the shots, 
and he plays to the polls.  He is first and foremost a 
domestic politician from Quebec, the home of Canada\'s 
tenacious and pacifist francophone linguistic minority.  His 
political roots are dug deeply into old-line Liberal Party 
soil and he is unsympathetic to, and out of touch with, U.S. 
foreign policy concerns. Moreover, since Chretien\'s 
announcement last August that he would quit politics in 2004 
-- and the soaring star of Liberal backbencher Paul Martin 
(expected to win the party leadership in November) -- it has 
become evident that the PM has lost his ironfisted grip on an 
increasingly restive Liberal Caucus.  His focus since the 
announcement has been to shape his legacy for the history 
books, and he crafted his last budget to boost the social 
traditions of the Liberal party. 
 
6. (C/NF) As Prime Minister, Chretien\'s modus operandi has 
been to play to domestic public opinion, which he does even 
to the detriment of his own Cabinet members attempting to 
advance Canada\'s external policy interests. An egregious 
example was his public admonition of Defense Minister 
McCallum for stating in Washington what GOC officials had 
told us privately since December, i.e., that if the UN 
process should fail and no explicit authorization for force 
be given, \"Canada will at that time decide whether to 
participate in a proposed military coalition.\"  The PM\'s 
outburst in the House of Commons was explained to us as 
concern for public perception -- at a time, it turns out, 
when the polls showed a leap in Canadian opposition to 
military action.  The tactic of ceding to public opinion 
appeared vindicated in the resounding public response to 
Chretien\'s March 17 announcement that Canada would not join 
the U.S. led coalition.  That said, the collective body of 
anecdotal evidence and published opinions over the past year 
suggest that the Canadian public, though still broadly 
supportive of Liberal party policies, has become disenchanted 
with--even embarrassed by--Jean Chretien, and is relieved 
that he took the hint (from polls) to step down. 
 
7. (C/NF) What now?  With the fluid dynamic of Jean Chretien 
officially at the helm for the next 10 months, we should not 
expect any change in this government\'s decision against 
joining coalition operations in Iraq (even though, 
ironically, Canada\'s indirect military contributions to the 
Gulf region and its upcoming ISAF role, are far more 
significant than those of most of the coalition members).  At 
the same time, we can hope that Canadians\' collective 
embarrassment over the government\'s behavior (Chretien 
himself does not exhibit any sense of shame) might prompt the 
GOC to focus seriously on post-conflict needs of Iraq.  We 
see some promising signs in the government\'s pledge this week 
of CAD 100 million to immediate humanitarian relief and the 
possibility of future funding.  In the House of Commons 
Question Period this week, Members of the opposition have 
proposed potential non-military assistance such as a \"field 
hospital.\" 
 
8. (C/NF) Finally, even the March 28 Toronto Star contained 
an amazing editorial (given the newspaper\'s anti-U.S. bias) 
calling on Chretien to become more involved in Iraq in the 
reconstruction phase as a way of moving back into the 
US/British fold.  Although it doesn\'t voice support for the 
US, it does display a chastened tone (not matched by any of 
the other opinion pieces) and acknowledges that Canada\'s 
breaking with the US on Iraq is not without repercussions. 
For our part, we should continue to publicize USG efforts to 
resolve trade disputes-notably softwood lumber-and to tout 
the progress on border initiatives, but consciously, without 
diluting the points made by the Ambassador in Toronto.   In 
any case, we believe that once Chretien is gone, there will 
be an improvement in Canada\'s policy toward the U.S., at 
least in tone and perhaps even substantively.

1. (U) Summary: In its latest report on organized crime 
activity, Criminal Intelligence Service Canada indicates that 
organized criminal groups in Canada are increasingly 
utilizing emerging technology to commit crimes such as fraud 
and money laundering, and that they are extensively involved 
in the large-scale cultivation and trafficking of 
residentially-grown marijuana. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Criminal Intelligence Service Canada collects 
intelligence and raw data from the criminal intelligence 
units of law enforcement agencies across Canada. The staff of 
the Central Bureau of CISC is located in Ottawa, and is made 
up of employees of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and 
personnel detailed from other police departments and 
government agencies.  CISC prepares and publishes an annual 
report on organized crime in Canada; the most recent report, 
covering activity through May 16, 2003, was released August 
25. The report presents an overview of the current activities 
of five broad organized crime groups in Canada: Aboriginal 
based, Asian based, Eastern European-based, outlaw motorcycle 
gangs, and Traditional (Italian-based). Organized crime at 
Canada\'s marine ports, in which all of the major crime groups 
are involved, is discussed. The report also evaluates trends 
in certain criminal activities in Canada:  contraband tobacco 
and alcohol, organized crime and the diamond industry, the 
illicit movement of firearms, technology and crime, the 
sexual exploitation of children, and street gangs. 
 
3. (C) The report describes some victories by law 
enforcement, including operations targeting outlaw motorcycle 
gangs and narcotics seizures at the Port of Halifax. But the 
report makes it clear that organized criminal activity 
continues throughout Canada, and that organized criminal 
groups are constantly seizing on new targets of opportunity 
and branching into new criminal ventures. While the Canadian 
press has reported that organized crime is on the rise in 
Canada, Shawn Scromeda, counsel in Justice Canada\'s Criminal 
Law Policy Section who works on organized crime issues, 
described that view as \"alarmist.\" Scromeda told poloff that 
Canada lacks baseline indicators with which to measure 
whether organized crime is increasing or decreasing, and said 
the CISC report is intended to serve as a \"snapshot\" of 
current organized crime activity. Scromeda noted that the 
Canadian Parliament approved several significant amendments 
to the criminal code in December 2001 which target organized 
crime, and he believes the impact of these amendments is just 
beginning to be felt.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. Bill C-13, \"An Act Respecting Assisted Human 
Reproduction,\" was introduced into the Canadian House 
of Commons on October 9, 2002.  If enacted, it would 
ban human cloning for both reproductive and 
research/therapeutic purposes.  The legislation, itself 
a clone of Bill C-56 (Ref A), which died when 
Parliament was prorogued in September 2002, will 
prohibit cloning, as well as regulate Assisted Human 
Reproductive (AHR) activities and related research. The 
bill would allow research on human embryos that remain 
after fertility treatment.  Such use would require free 
and informed consent by the parents, and would require 
a government license.  To control activity involving 
new reproductive technologies, stem cells and cloning, 
the legislation proposes the establishment of a new 
agency, the Assisted Human Reproductive Agency of 
Canada.  The bill is expected to pass final muster in 
the House of Commons within days and move on to 
scrutiny in the Canadian Senate.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Legislation prohibits and controls many activities 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. On October 9, 2002 Canadian Health Minister Anne 
McLellan introduced Bill C-13 (formerly C-56) \"An Act 
Respecting Assisted Human Reproduction\" into the House 
of Commons.  It covers a number of controversial 
issues, including access to embryonic stem cells for 
research, cloning and surrogate motherhood. 
The final House of Commons vote on Bill C-13, is 
expected as early as April 3rd.  If passed by the House 
of Commons, the bill will move to the Senate, where it 
will face light scrutiny in the Liberal-dominated 
chamber (which is characterized by its members being 
appointed by the Prime Minister rather than being 
elected through general elections). 
 
3. Prohibited Activities: The bill prohibits a number 
of specific activities that must not be carried out 
under any circumstances, including germ-line 
alteration, animal/human hybrids and the 
commercialization of procreation.  These prohibited 
activities remain unchanged from the predecessor 
legislation (ref A). 
 
4. \"Controlled Activities\", on the other hand, may be 
carried out, but only in accordance with the 
legislation and regulations.  The proposed law requires 
that a license be authorized for any activities related 
to maintenance/transportation/ or 
importation/exportation of an \"in vitro\" embryo. (It is 
interesting to note that proposed US cloning 
legislation (HR-534 and S-245), in addition to banning 
the commercialization of cloned embryos, also prohibits 
the importation of medical therapies created from 
cloned embryos.  We will be watching whether this will 
have an impact on Canadian research efforts with 
embryos. End Comment.) 
 
5.  Bill C-13, like its predecessor C-56, describes 
embryonic stem cell research as a controlled activity. 
While the legislation bans cloning and also the 
creation of embryos expressly for research, it permits 
the use of \"surplus\" embryos for extraction of stem 
cells.  In addressing this issue, Bill C-13 specifies 
that licenses for such research may be issued only if 
researchers can satisfy the Agency that pre-existing 
embryonic stem cell lines or other means cannot be 
substituted. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Assisted Human Reproductive Agency proposed 
------------------------------------------- 
 
6. To enforce the Act, license and manage controlled 
activities, such as performing research on surplus \"in 
vitro\" embryos, the bill calls for the establishment of 
the \"Assisted Human Reproductive Agency of Canada.\" 
Reporting to the Minister of Health, the agency would 
have a broad mandate, including the collection, 
analysis and management of a vast array of personal 
information under the rubric of \"health reporting 
information.\" 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
7. The Quebec-based Raelians\' December 2002 claim they 
had successfully cloned a human being and that more 
were on the way, provoked a media frenzy and 
highlighted the pressing need for a law prohibiting 
human cloning.  The timeliness of the bill, however, 
does not shield it from critics; leading research 
funding advocates such as the Juvenile Diabetes 
Research Foundation (JDRF) are making a final plea to 
parliamentarians to reconsider C-13\'s ban of 
therapeutic cloning of any kind (cloning or embryo- 
splitting) for any purpose, either reproduction or 
research.  On the other hand, the Canadian Conference 
of Catholic Bishops is urging MPs to strengthen the 
bill, by amending it to prohibit research on surplus 
human embryos.  Observers note, however, that 
amendments to this bill, particularly in the context of 
therapeutic cloning are unlikely. 
 
8. The complete text of Bill C-13, \"An Act Respecting 
Assisted Human Reproduction\" is available at the 
Canadian Parliament\'s website: www.parl.gc.ca.  Look 
for C-13 under the rubric \"Bills\"; then \"House of 
Commons\"; then \"Government Bills\".

SUBJECT: CANADA EXPLAINS NEW GLITCH IN AVIATION 
PRECLEARANCE AGREEMENT 
 
1. This is an action request.  See paragraph 9. 
 
2.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) expressed mild apologies delay in 
Canadian internal procedures are slowing down the entry into 
force of the new aviation preclearance agreement.   DFAIT 
explained that the GOC cannot bring the agreement into force 
until Transport Canada designates the exact locations of the 
preclearance sites at the Montreal (Dorval), Vancouver, and 
Calgary Airports.  Preclearance areas in these three airports 
have changed since they were last designated.  DFAIT said 
Transport Canada began this designation process a few weeks 
ago, soon after the U.S. passed reciprocity legislation 
necessary to bring the agreement into effect, but it has not 
been completed.  DFAIT said the process might take four to 
six weeks, but did not indicate why the GOC had waited until 
the U.S. legislation had passed to begin this process. 
 
3. The \"designations\" are important, DFAIT said, because the 
new (2001) preclearance agreement provides U.S. officers a 
measure of law enforcement authority by permitting them to 
detain individuals on Canadian soil.  Thus, DFAIT argues, 
Canadian law requires that the GOC specify exactly the areas 
where U.S. officers have this authority. 
 
4.    Because the Montreal preclearance area has changed 
significantly, Transport Canada and other parties are 
conducting a site survey on April 3.  Calgary and Vancouver 
have changed only slightly, so no survey is necessary.  The 
airports will prepare architectural drawings of all three 
locations showing the preclearance areas for approval by both 
Transport Canada and U.S. agencies. 
 
5. DFAIT explained that it originally designated the 
preclearance areas of all seven airports in May 2002.  DFAIT 
provided copies of floor plans to Embassy Ottawa, accompanied 
by a diplomatic note dated May 8 that explained the drawings. 
 The DFAIT note also said, \"Preclearance areas of Canadian 
airports will not be set out by regulation but will be 
established administratively through the issuance of a 
document by the Minister of Transport, in consultation with 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, that designates the 
preclearance areas on an airport-by-airport basis.\"   The 
Embassy, after consulting with Federal Inspection Agencies, 
responded with a note dated June 5 that acknowledged that the 
preclearance areas described by the GOC  \"appear to meet the 
definition of the preclearance area\" in the new preclearance 
agreement, which, our note stated, \"is not in force as of 
this date.\"    Nothing in either the DFAIT note or the 
Embassy note made any reference to the designation of the 
preclearance areas as having any bearing on bringing the 
agreement into force.  (Dipnotes faxed to EB/TRA and WHA/CAN.) 
 
6.  DFAIT cites the following sections of the new agreement 
as referring to the process of designating the specific 
locations of the preclearance areas: 
 
Article I, paragraph 1: Definition of the preclearance area; 
 
Article II, paragraph 1: \"The host party, before designating 
a preclearance area, shall consult with the participating air 
industry in order to seek their recommendation on the precise 
location of preclearance and in-transit preclearance areas;\" 
 
 
Article II, paragraph 2: \"The Host Party shall consult with 
the Inspecting Party with respect to the designation of the 
preclearance area.\" 
 
GOC said it is consulting with the airports and with the USG 
in accordance with these provisions.  DFAIT said the 
consultation with the USG in the current instance is 
accomplished through both the participation of the 
preclearance staff in Montreal in the site survey on April 3 
and in a future exchange of notes with the Embassy, as in May 
2002 (para 2). 
 
7.  ECONOFF  asked DFAIT officer how the designations in 
Article II relate to bringing the agreement into force. 
DFAIT responded that Article XII, paragraph 1 says that the 
agreement can be brought into force with an exchange of notes 
\"following the completion of all internal procedures of the 
parties.\"  DFAIT said that the designation process it is 
performing is an \"internal procedure\" under this provision. 
After the agreement is in effect, DFAIT said, changes in the 
size and location of the preclearance areas would be 
accomplished by a similar consultation and designation 
process, consistent with Articles I and II of the agreement. 
 It is necessary, DFAIT maintains, to designate the exact 
preclearance areas where U.S. officers will have authority 
before the agreement goes into effect. 
 
8. Comment: A generous explanation for this bureaucratic 
glitch is that DFAIT and the Privy Council Office (PCO), 
which had pushed to complete the agreement in time for the 
Ridge-Manley meeting April 7, had simply not told Transport 
Canada to ensure that the designations would be accomplished 
according to this schedule.   End Comment. 
 
9. Embassy recommends that we request the GOC agree to an 
exchange of notes giving an entry into force date not later 
than May 12.  This should provide the GOC ample time to meet 
its internal procedure requirements.   Does Washington 
approve such a request and May 12 deadline?

SUBJECT: ISAF: CANADIAN RECONNAISSANCE TEAM VISIT 
 
REF: OTTAWA 540 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Canada remains committed to providing a 
battle group and brigade headquarters to ISAF IV and V, but 
is making clear to potential partners that it will not serve 
as a lead or co-lead nation.  While hoping for a substantial 
NATO role, Canada expects that Germany will end up as lead 
nation for ISAF IV, and is discussing division of labor with 
the Bundeswehr.  Canada expects its area of responsibility to 
be western Kabul, the most insecure of the sectors now being 
patrolled by ISAF and the expected site of the constitutional 
Loya Jirga in October.  For sustainment purposes, Canada may 
need to shift its transport aircraft in theater from 
Operation Enduring Freedom to ISAF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) A Canadian \"strategic reconnaissance team\" visited 
Afghanistan and Germany in late March to look at the security 
and political environment in which ISAF operates, and to 
discuss Canada\'s contributions to ISAF IV and V.  The 
Canadian team was led by BGEN Andrew Leslie and included 
representatives from National Defense (DND), Foreign Affairs 
(DFAIT), and International Development (CIDA). 
 
3. (C) Wendy Gilmour, DFAIT Deputy Director for Regional 
Security and Peacekeeping and a member of the Canadian team, 
told us on April 4 that they stressed with all interlocutors 
that Canada will not/not be lead or co-lead nation for ISAF 
IV and V.  Canada remains committed to being a \"substantial 
partner\" for those phases of ISAF, to include a battle group, 
a brigade headquarters, and a flag officer plus staff for 
ISAF headquarters, a total of 1500  personnel.  But the 
Canadian Forces do not have the resources to take on other 
tasks - e.g., airport operations and field hospitals - should 
gaps emerge, and therefore the GoC does not want to cast 
itself as a lead nation.  That said, Afghan officials and 
ISAF participants were delighted that Canada will be 
providing more boots on the ground.  German leadership has 
increased ISAF patrols this year, but this remains a deficit 
area. 
 
4. (C) Gilmour said that the German/Dutch Corps headquarters 
will depart ISAF in August in order to meet its NATO 
commitments.  While the Dutch expect to maintain little or no 
personnel for ISAF IV, the Germans will maintain a 
substantial presence.  Gilmour said that while both Canada 
and Germany hope NATO will play an increased role, the 
Bundeswehr believes it will fall to Germany to be the lead 
nation for ISAF IV.  GEN Reichman, head of Bundeswehr 
Operational Command, told the Canadians that his \"emergency 
contingency plan\" was for a divisional headquarters within 
the German/U.S. Corps to take the lead for ISAF IV.  Gilmour 
recognized that the German government has not yet made a 
decision about ISAF IV, and that the German MFA has not yet 
accepted the need for continuity of command. 
 
5. (C) German military officials were initially resistant to 
a Canadian brigade headquarters, given that Germany had 
planned to maintain their current brigade headquarters into 
ISAF IV.  But as the likelihood grows of serving as lead 
nation for ISAF IV, Gilmour said, the Germans have become 
more receptive to handing over the brigade headquarters 
function.  The Bundeswehr is sending a team to Canada on 
April 15 to discuss the requirements for transfer of brigade 
leadership. 
 
6. (C) Gilmour said that a decision brief on Canada\'s force 
composition for ISAF will be presented to Chief of Defense 
Staff GEN Henault the week of April 7.  In order to be 
available in Afghanistan in August, Canadian military 
equipment will need to set sail by the end of May.  Gilmour 
also noted that given sustainment challenges, Canada may need 
to re-assign three Hercules transport aircraft currently in 
Operation Enduring Freedom to ISAF.  We told her that 
Canadian Forces planners should discuss this possibility with 
U.S. military counterparts.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. In Canada the provincial governments have the 
primary responsibility for health matters, including 
managing public health emergencies.  The federal 
authorities nevertheless do play an important 
coordination role between the provinces, with other 
countries and the WHO.  In addition to that role the 
federal authority, Health Canada, has specialized 
laboratory assets as well as public health specialists, 
available to assist the provinces.  End summary. 
 
------------ 
Federal Role 
------------ 
 
2. On March 26, the Government of Ontario declared 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to be a 
provincial emergency (Ref B).  SARS is now a reportable 
disease under Ontario\'s Health Protection and Promotion 
Act.  Ontario provincial health authorities have 
extended restrictive hospital measures to all hospitals 
in the province (Ref A) and thousands of residents of 
Toronto have been asked to quarantine themselves at 
home for 10 days.  This response underscores the fact 
that primary public health monitoring and infectious 
disease response is managed at the provincial level. 
 
3. Under the Canadian constitution, the provinces have 
primary responsibility for managing health issues, 
including public health and disease surveillance 
matters.  There is, nevertheless, a significant role 
for the Canadian federal authorities and the federal 
government possesses key assets that support the 
provincial efforts. 
 
4. John Rainford, Crisis Communications Chief at Health 
Canada explained the specific federal role in managing 
the SARS outbreak. 
 
-- Health Canada issues travel advisories on behalf of 
the federal government with regard to travel to foreign 
location.  Health Canada\'s travel advisories are 
available at the Health Canada website: www.hc- 
sc.gc.ca. They currently advise against travel to 
Hanoi, China including Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. 
 
-- The federal authorities are the focal point for 
Canadian coordination with the World Health 
Organization (WHO).  For example, when the WHO issued a 
global alert for cases of atypical pneumonia on March 
12, 2003, Health Canada immediately notified all 
provinces and territories.  Health Canada is also the 
focal point for coordination with other international 
partners such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC).  Rainford told us that CDC and 
Health Canada staff are currently serving in exchange 
position at one another\'s Emergency Response Centers to 
help manage the SARS issue. 
 
-- Health Canada operates Canada\'s \"National 
Microbiology Laboratory\", a level 4 Bio-containment 
facility and laboratory located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 
where the Canadian search for the SARS infectious agent 
is being conducted.  We understand that this facility 
is also a member of the CDC network of laboratories and 
we understand that its staff is in frequent 
communication with their CDC counterparts. 
 
-- Health Canada provides assistance to the provincial 
health authorities.  For example twelve federal 
epidemiologists have been sent to Toronto assist 
provincial public health authorities during the current 
SARS situation. 
 
-- The federal government has powers relating to entry- 
exit controls.  After being informed of the SARS 
situation, the federal government immediately activated 
protocols to track potentially infected passengers 
arriving from the epicenters in Vietnam and China.  In 
instances where a returning passenger shows SARS 
symptoms, the passenger manifests for that person\'s 
flights to Canada have been examined and provincial or 
territorial public health authorities are in touch with 
the other passengers to determine if any other 
passengers demonstrate SARS symptoms.  Health Canada 
also began distributing Health Alert Notices to 
international passengers arriving in or returning 
directly to Canada from affected areas in Asia, which 
advised passengers to see a physician if they began to 
have symptoms related to SARS (Ref A).  Also, Health 
Canada has sent quarantine officers to Pearson 
(Toronto), Vancouver and Dorval (Montreal) 
International Airports to support airport staff. 
 
-- In a worst-case scenario, the federal government 
could invoke the Quarantine Act.  The following summary 
is from Health Canada: \"The Quarantine Act would 
authorize Health Canada to detain persons, goods or 
conveyances on suspicion that the persons, goods and 
conveyances might introduce a dangerous communicable 
disease into Canada. The authority permits detention 
without due process for a period of 48 hours in order 
to undertake a medical examination of persons, analysis 
of goods or inspection of conveyances. If detention is 
required beyond 48 hours, Health Canada must present 
evidence for a continuation of the detention in a 
federal court. These powers also apply to persons and 
conveyances leaving Canada for another country.\" 
Health Canada emphasizes that this Act would only be 
invoked if necessary and that such an action is not 
being considering at this time. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. Health Canada officials are taking the SARS public 
health situation very seriously, as evidenced by the 
support they have provided to the provincial 
authorities and measures taken to screen passengers at 
airports.  Health Canada is collaborating closely and 
coordinating efforts with their counterparts across 
Canada, including the Chief Medical Officers of Health 
in each province and territory.  Furthermore, they are 
confident that, as and when SARS cases are identified, 
they will be able to meet any additional provincial 
requests for assistance.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  In his first comprehensive statement on 
Canada\'s Iraq policy, and an effort to make amends with the 
U.S., Prime Minister Chretien urged the House of Commons 
April 8 to vote for a resolution supporting \"our friends in 
battle\" and hoping \"for a quick victory with minimum 
casualties.\"  The PM prefaced his statement by noting that he 
strongly disagreed with statements made by Members of his 
Caucus, \"which we all wish had not been said.\"  He also 
commended President Bush for his continued dedication to 
poverty eradication, combating AIDS and improving trade and 
development in Africa.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A wake-up call for ordinary Canadians 
------------------------------------- 
2. (U) In the 10 days since Ambassador Cellucci voiced U.S. 
disappointment with Canada\'s posture on Iraq (reftel), the 
business community and Canada\'s \"silent majority\" have taken 
to the streets and sought opportunities to demonstrate 
solidarity with America.  New poll results indicate that a 
majority (54 percent) of Anglophone Canadians currently 
\"approves\" of military action in Iraq, with a conservative 
poll specifically indicating that 72 percent believe Canada 
\"should have\" supported the U.S. at the start of the war. 
The weekend following the Ambassador\'s speech, a gathering of 
nearly 4,000 - the largest of any group to demonstrate in 
Ottawa since the start of military action - assembled at 
Parliament Hill in a show of support for the U.S. and for 
coalition forces.  Similar events have taken place in other 
Canadian metropolises. 
 
3. (U) Fears of an economic backlash against Canadian 
business interests prompted Liberal backbench MP Dennis Mills 
to invite U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue to 
meet with a group of 200 Canadian business leaders. Donahue 
reportedly proved effective in delivering reassurances that 
business relations would continue to remain on track.  At the 
same time, however, he did not shrink from conveying the 
message that \"many Americans ... found personal attacks on 
President Bush ... offensive and hurtful,\" and reiterating 
that \"the U.S. agenda was profoundly reshaped by 9/11.\"  In a 
separate interview with journalists, Mr. Donahue debunked the 
widely held notion that the U.S. is in Iraq for the oil, 
noting that the major supplier of energy to the U.S. is 
Canada. 
 
The Government tries to make amends 
----------------------------------- 
4. (SBU) Meanwhile, in the House of Commons the government 
has had its back against the wall, consistently drawing fire 
from the entire spectrum of opposition parties for its 
waffling position on various aspects of the war in Iraq. 
Ministerial testiness has become increasingly apparent in the 
daily Question Period, as embattled Cabinet Members have 
parried NDP (left-leaning) and Bloc Quebecois criticism of 
Canadian soldiers being \"embedded\" with U.S. and U.K. troops 
in Iraq under routine exchange programs, while the Canadian 
Alliance (right) has nailed the government for failing to 
adequately support such personnel. 
 
5. (SBU) The Liberals moved swiftly to counter a Canadian 
Alliance motion calling on the House to regret and apologize 
for \"offensive and inappropriate statements\" against the U.S. 
by Members of the House, and wishing the U.S. success in 
removing Saddam Hussein from power.  In a special session on 
April 8, Prime Minister Chretien urged the House to support a 
government counter-motion calling for the coalition to \"be 
successful\" in its mission in Iraq, and pledging the 
government\'s readiness to participate \"as soon as possible\" 
in the reconstruction of Iraq.  He said the government cared 
\"about the outcome even if we are not participants in the 
war.  This means that we should not say things that could 
give comfort to Saddam Hussein and this means that we should 
not do things that would create real difficulties for the 
coalition.\" Turning to the longer-term requirements of peace 
and security throughout the troubled regions of the world, 
the PM went on to praise President Bush\'s leadership in and 
commitment to combating aids in Africa and his recognition of 
the importance of poverty, trade and development, even in the 
face of the terrorist threat.

6. (SBU) In his speech, the PM criticized the Canadian 
Alliance\'s call for a House apology as an assault on Members\' 
rights of free speech, noting that it would \"cast a chill\" on 
the rights and privileges of MPs that are fundamental to 
Canada\'s democracy.  He defended the government\'s \"decision 
of principle\" not to support the coalition, stressing the 
consistency of its position from the beginning, and invoking 
his oft-repeated phrase that \"close friends can disagree at 
times and can still remain close friends.\" By way of example, 
Chretien alluded to how Canada\'s opposition to the war in 
Vietnam did not damage its friendship with America and he 
recalled with pride the heroic role, 23 years ago, of 
Canada\'s Ambassador to Iran in rescuing U.S. Embassy 
personnel in Tehran.  He went on to commend Canada\'s show of 
solidarity with the U.S. in the wake of the September 11 
terrorist attacks. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  The Prime Minister\'s remarks reflect the 
Liberal Party\'s awareness of the damage to its image 
inflicted by the government\'s haphazard and clumsy approach 
to policy on Iraq.   The fact that Chretien read a prepared 
text - rather than speaking extemporaneously as is his habit 
- was no accident.   As a close adviser of the PM confided to 
Charge, the message was painstakingly choreographed to mend 
fences with the U.S., while trying to balancing the broadly 
divergent views within the Liberal Caucus.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) On April 7, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill 
Graham called in Cuba\'s ambassador to Canada to formally 
protest the recent arrests and trials of Cuban opposition 
members.  According to Louise Branch, DFAIT\'s Deputy Director 
for Central America and Cuba, who was present at the meeting, 
Minister Graham told Ambassador Fernandez de Cossio Dominguez 
that the prison sentences imposed on opposition members were 
beyond comprehension, and that the government of Cuba was 
making a colossal error. Minister Graham also gave the 
ambassador a letter for Cuban Minister of Foreign Relations 
Felipe Roque in which Graham expressed Canada\'s extreme 
concern about the curtailment of human rights and freedom of 
expression in Cuba. 
 
2. (C) Branch told poloff on April 8th that Canada\'s 
ambassador in Havana had made an official request to the 
government of Cuba, before the trials began, for a list of 
those arrested, the charges against them, and the rationale 
behind the charges.  The Canadian ambassador also asked that 
a Canadian embassy representative be allowed to attend the 
trials.  The Cuban government refused these requests on the 
basis that the persons on trial were not Canadian citizens, 
and further explained that no diplomatic representatives 
would be allowed to attend the trials. In his letter to the 
Cuban foreign minister, Minister Graham expressed profound 
disappointment in this decision by the Cuban government. 
 
3. (C) Branch said that Ambassador Dominguez defended his 
government\'s actions during the meeting, asserting that 
opposition members were not arrested for exercising their 
freedom of expression, but because they were 
counter-revolutionaries working with the U.S. The ambassador 
referred to the arrests and trials as a national security 
matter for Cuba.  Minister Graham specifically mentioned a 
prison sentence of 25 years imposed on one of the opposition 
members, saying this was more in line with a sentence for 
murder. According to Branch, the Cuban ambassador responded 
that, no, 30 years was the usual sentence imposed for murder 
in Cuba. Branch said that Ambassador Dominguez complained 
about Principal Officer Cason during the meeting, stating 
that Cason is openly encouraging dissent but Cuba can\'t expel 
him because it would mean the loss of the migratory agreement. 
 
4. (C) With reference to the Cuba resolution in the U.N. 
Human Rights Commission (which Canada intends to co-sponsor), 
Branch confirmed that Canada\'s delegation wants tougher 
language, and wants the arrests mentioned specifically. She 
further indicated that Canada has begun promoting the idea of 
a stronger resolution with other UNCHR delegations, 
particularly the Latin American delegations.

1. Canada\'s International Development Agency (CIDA) confirmed 
April 9 that Canada has committed C$5.4 million to Kosovo for 
calendar year 2003.  (The Canadian dollar is worth about 68 
US cents.)  They do not, at this point, specifically support 
the Office of Returns and Communities, but will provide funds 
on an ad hoc basis when the security situation improves. 
Canada does, however, provide about C$1.1 million to a local 
initiative program managed from Pristina that can be used for 
ORC. 
 
2.  CIDA is consulting with UNMIK, but says nothing is 
happening on the ground.  Once it is feasible, Canada does 
intend to provide additional funds to support ORC.  Post 
believes CIDA would welcome any evidence Washington can 
provide that the time is ripe for effective use of 
contributions to ORC.

SUBJECT: CANADA: RESPONDING TO IRAQ HUMANITARIAN APPEALS, 
CONSIDERING RECONSTRUCTION ROLE 
 
REF: A. STATE 89192 B. STATE 90025 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) We delivered ref A talking points on April 7 to Norman 
Macdonnell, Chief of Operations for International 
Humanitarian Assistance at the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA). On April 8, poloff met with 
Mcdonnell, Louise Marchand, CIDA\'s Director General for 
International Assistance, Mario Renaud, Director General for 
CIDA\'s North Africa and Middle East programs, and Daniel 
Joly, Director of CIDA\'s Iraq task force, to receive a 
response and to discuss CIDA\'s possible participation in Iraq 
reconstruction efforts. 
 
2. (C) Macdonnell agreed that our record of Canada\'s total 
contribution to the Iraq humanitarian response, approximately 
U.S. $70 million, is correct. In response to the first round 
of humanitarian appeals, CIDA announced on March 26 the 
allocation of C$20 million (U.S. $13 million), as follows: $4 
million to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); 
$4 million to UNICEF; $6.3 million to the World Food Program; 
$600,000.00 to the Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); $3.5 million to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross; $1 million to the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
Societies; and $600,000.00 to CARE Canada (figures are in 
Canadian dollars). 
 
3. (C) Macdonnell indicated CIDA is close to reaching a 
decision on the size and allocation of the next tranche of 
Canada\'s contribution, and will consider the March 28 U.N. 
flash appeal and any subsequent flash appeals in making that 
decision. He said CIDA Minister Susan Whelan has an open mind 
about increasing the total amount of Canada\'s contribution 
beyond the C$100 million committed to date. Director General 
Marchand commented that countries have been very generous in 
responding to appeals for Iraq humanitarian assistance, and 
she didn\'t think there would be a problem in meeting future 
Iraq relief appeals. 
 
4. (C) With regard to Canadian participation in the 
reconstruction of Iraq, Renaud said the preliminary thinking 
is that Canada will participate, but Prime Minister Chretien 
has made no official decision on the role Canada will play. 
Renaud emphasized that it is Canada\'s preference to work 
through the U.N. on reconstruction efforts, but added that 
the U.N. and other international bodies should act as 
partners with the coalition. (Note: In April 8 remarks on the 
floor of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chretien stated 
that Canada is in agreement with Prime Minister Blair that 
the U.N. \"must be closely involved in the process of 
reconstructing Iraq. But I think it would be impossible for 
the U.N. to do it all alone. And we are ready to help as soon 
as possible.\" End note.) 
 
5. (C) Renaud emphasized the importance of taking a 
comprehensive approach to reconstruction, and cited several 
specific areas where he thinks Canada could make a 
contribution. With respect to the political and economic 
aspects of reconstruction, Renaud mentioned the experience 
Canadians have in municipal governance, central banking 
systems, currency management, the development of trade 
policies, and drafting constitutions. For internal security 
reform, Renault suggested Canada could play a role in the 
training of police forces, and in organizing correctional 
services. Renault doesn\'t believe reconstruction will take a 
long time, perhaps 3-5 years, and that with its oil resources 
Iraq should be in the top tier of developing countries by the 
end of the  reconstruction period. (Comment:  Renaud\'s 
mention of specific areas in which Canada would participate 
tracks with a statement made by Canadian Ambassador Kergin to 
Under Secretary Grossman, at their April 4 meeting in 
Washington (ref B), that the GOC wants to find some 
particular contribution it can make to reconstruction. End 
comment.)

SUBJECT: BANK OF CANADA PROMOTES FROM WITHIN 
 
 
1.  The Bank of Canada\'s April 9 announcement that Paul 
Jenkins will be promoted to Senior Deputy Governor reverses a 
recent trend of drawing on outside talent for top leadership. 
 Jenkins, a Deputy Governor for 10 years, had been a 
front-runner for the SDG job in 1999, but was edged out by 
Malcolm Knight.  (Knight left to assume the top job at the 
Bank for International Settlements earlier this month.)  The 
promotion makes Jenkins a member of the BOC Board of 
Directors and a strong contender to eventually replace David 
Dodge as Governor (if Dodge does not continue when his 7-year 
term expires in about five years.)  Dodge, too, was selected 
from outside the BOC. 
 
2.  The choice of Jenkins had been leaked earlier in the 
week. His promotion leaves the BOC with two Deputy Governor 
jobs to fill (Charles Freedman is retiring at the end of 
August), and both internal and external candidates are under 
consideration.  A decision on those jobs is expected \"soon\" 
and the choice is expected to signal the BOC\'s future 
direction.   Deputy Governor appointments, unlike the 
Governor and the Senior Deputy, do not require Cabinet 
approval. 
 
3.  Jenkin\'s promotion, which takes effect immediately, has 
been positively received and economists believe it reinforces 
the BOC\'s priorities of transparency and maintaining an 
aggressive stance on inflation.  Jenkins has focussed on 
international economics (and hosted the Bank\'s biannual 
briefings for G-7 financial attaches on the Monetary Policy 
Report). 
 
4.  Jenkins, 55, joined the Bank\'s research department in 
1972.  In 1978 he transferred to the Department of Monetary 
and Financial Analysis, becoming Deputy Chief in 1983, Chief 
of the Research Department in 1984, and Advisor to the 
Governor in 1989.  Jenkins graduated from the University of 
Western Ontario, and received a Masters in Political Science 
from the London School of Economics.  He studied at Princeton 
from 1982-83 before returning to the Bank.  He was born in 
St. Catharines, Ontario, and he and his wife Sheila have 
three children.

Ref. (A) Toronto 01048 and previous 
 
1. As of April 9, 2003, Health Canada has received 
reports of 242 probable or suspect cases of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There have 
been 10 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have 
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had 
contact with SARS cases in the household or in a health- 
care setting.  Health Canada has compiled the following 
figures regarding the SARS outbreak in Canada, accurate 
as of 13:00 EDT, April 09: 
 
2. Number of Cases: 
 
Ontario is reporting 94 probable and 101 suspect 
cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have 
traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the 
household or in a health-care setting. 
 
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 31 
suspect cases. 
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. 
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. 
Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases. 
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. 
 
3. Health Canada provides the following definitions: A 
\"suspect\" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of 
the following two categories: a person who develops 
fever and one or more respiratory symptoms, including 
cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
within 10 days of returning from travel to areas in 
Asia where SARS cases are being reported, or a person 
who develops fever and one or more respiratory 
symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, within 10 days of having had 
close contact with a \"probable \" case of SARS (i.e. 
within one meter). 
 
4. A \"probable\" case of SARS is similar to a suspect 
case, but often the case has a more severe illness, 
with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty 
breathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays shows signs 
of atypical pneumonia.  Health Canada emphasizes that 
the above descriptions of a probable and suspect case 
are provided for communication purposes and not for 
scientific purposes. 
 
5. Fatalities: 
 
      10, all clustered in Toronto, Ontario. 
 
6. Provincial Health Status Level: 
 
Reflecting the relative severity of the outbreak 
in Ontario, that province is the only one to have 
declared a provincial Health emergency, doing so on 
March 26th.  Also, on March 26, Ontario made SARS a 
reportable disease under the provincial health statute. 
 
British Columbia added SARS to the list of 
of reportable communicable diseases in B.C. on April 1st. 
While any unusual communicable disease like SARS is 
already considered reportable under the B.C. Health 
Act, SARS was specifically added by name to listing of 
disease under the communicable disease regulations for 
greater surety. 
 
In tiny Prince Edward Island (about the size of 
Delaware), SARS has also been made a reportable disease 
under the province\'s public health act. 
 
In all other provinces, the standard approach has 
been the provincial medical officers of health, in 
coordination with Health Canada, have issued advisories 
to physicians and healthcare workers outlining SARS 
symptoms and \"at-risk\" indicia, and defining the course 
of action to take. 
 
7. Federal Assistance & Health Asset Deployments: The 
focus of federal assistance is on Toronto, the 
epicenter of the Canadian SARS outbreak. 
 
A Health Canada SARS Team of physicians and nurses 
has been deployed to Pearson International Airport 
(Toronto) to provide information to airline and airport 
staff.  Health Canada has also sent quarantine officers 
to Vancouver and Dorval (Montreal) International 
Airports to support airport staff.  These health 
professionals are monitoring passengers arriving on 
direct flights from Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing; 
passing out Health Alert Notices to incoming 
passengers; and supporting airport staff.  Health 
Canada staff at Toronto\'s Pearson International 
airports also inform all departing travelers from that 
airport about the symptoms of SARS and advise those who 
have symptoms, or been in contact with a SARS affected 
person, or visited a SARS affected facility, to defer 
travel and seek medical attention. 
 
At the request of Ontario, Health Canada shipped 
10,000 masks to Toronto as a stopgap measure until the 
province receives additional masks from its supplier. 
These masks are part of Health Canada\'s national 
emergency stockpile (National Emergency Stockpile 
System). 
 
Health Canada has deployed a total of 14 personnel 
to Ontario to assist Toronto\'s public health unit and 
the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation 
of the SARS cases. Health Canada has also provided 
guidelines for infection control and recommendations on 
actions for public health settings. 
 
Health Canada has provided two mobile x-ray 
machines and processors to Toronto for two isolation 
units that have been set up in non-hospital facilities.

Canada is made available by Health Canada at the

1. Ottawa transmitting text of AmConsul Toronto. 
 
2. Fatalities:  As of COB April 9, no new SARS deaths have 
been reported, leaving the number of SARS fatalities in 
Ontario at ten. 
 
3. Number of cases: Health Canada\'s April 9 SARS advisory 
lists approximately 195 cases of SARS in Ontario, including 
94 probable and 101 suspect cases, an increase of 3 probable 
and 2 suspect cases since April 8 reporting. A total of 49 
patients treated for SARS have been discharged from 
hospital.  All Ontario cases, according to the advisory, 
have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asian SARS 
hotspots or had contact with SARS cases in a household or in 
a health-care setting. 
 
4. Prophylactic measures: Acting on the recommendation of 
Toronto Public Health as a precautionary measure, the 
Toronto District School Board closed two Toronto high 
schools until April 15, a closure affecting almost 1500 
persons.  One student who developed SARS-like symptoms last 
week is undergoing review to determine cause of illness. 
Leading daily \"Toronto Star\" reported on April 10 that York 
region health officers have requested home quarantine for 
all those who were at Hewlett Packard\'s suburban Toronto 
facility in Markham from March 29 to April 1. 
 
5. The Provincial Ministry of Health is opening up 
additional space at the Oakville Lifecare Centre at the 
outskirts of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to move patients 
awaiting long-term care placement out of Toronto hospitals, 
freeing GTA hospital beds for acute care patients.  The 
April 9 \"Toronto Star\" reports that province-wide SARS 
health-care measures were working, as exemplified by smooth 
operational procedures at a rural Ontario hospital in 
Listowel. A suspect SARS patient, back from Asian travel, 
was admitted and \"quickly whisked into an isolation area.\" 
\"We are ready right at the door and so we picked [the case] 
up with our screening tool,\" stated the hospital\'s CEO as 
reported in the \"Star.\" 
 
6. Economic impacts:  According to media reports, including 
Reuters on April 10, Wal-Mart Stores has temporarily barred 
its employees from traveling to the Toronto area, while 
asking staff returning from Toronto (as well as SARS Asian 
hotspots) to remain at home for 10 days.  The GTA contains 9 
Wal-Mart complexes plus the company\'s home office in Canada. 
On the good news front, the \"Star\" reports major conventions 
maintaining schedules in Toronto, including this week\'s 
2,000-delegate National Association of School Psychologists 
and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine.

SUBJECT:  THE WORLD\'S TOP TRADING PARTNERSHIP 
          IN THE MILLENNIUM TRADE SLUMP 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.   U.S. and world trade have declined significantly in the 
past two years from their peaks in 2000.   This decline is 
an unusual event which is partly explained by the 
technology/telecoms crash.  The world\'s largest bilateral 
trading relationship has been affected, with the value of 
trade declining some seven percent over two years - a sharp 
break from the performance throughout the 1990\'s.  Canada\'s 
oil and gas exports to the United States have remained near 
the very high levels achieved in 2000 (after several years 
of impressive growth), limiting the size of the tech-driven 
slump.  Canada\'s imports of pharmaceuticals grew by 90 
percent in the past four years, an expansion which cannot be 
explained by domestic demand.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
SPIKE-SLUMP PATTERN LAST SEEN IN EARLY 80\'S 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.   While year-on-year declines in the value of U.S. 
merchandise trade have been rare in recent decades, our 
country\'s total trade fell by more than 7 percent over the 
past two years, and exports fell by more than 11 percent. 
The only comparable experience since 1960 was the period of 
major rust-belt restructuring in the early 1980\'s (exports 
in 1984 were 15 percent below their 1982 level).  Both of 
these export slumps were preceded by export \"spikes,\" in 
which U.S. worldwide exports briefly grew by two to three 
times their trend growth rate. 
 
 
A BREAK IN THE FTA SUCCESS STORY? 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.   U.S.-Canada trade - the world\'s largest two-way trading 
relationship - has followed this worldwide pattern in recent 
years.  The value of bilateral merchandise trade jumped by 
11.5 percent in 2000 over 1999, capping a decade of 
exceptional growth prompted by the 1989 FTA and the 1994 
NAFTA.  Then, from 2000 to 2002, it contracted by 7 percent 
- about the same percentage as U.S. worldwide trade. 
 
4.   This fundamentally changes the economic environment for 
this post, which (like our GOC contacts) had grown used to 
boasting about our terrific continental trade performance. 
We cannot blame weakness in Canada\'s economy, which has 
outgrown the U.S. each year since 1998 (averaging 3.7 
percent in annual real growth versus 2.6 for the U.S).  And 
trade in services, while strong, cannot make up for weakness 
in the much larger merchandise sector. 
 
 
ENERGY, AUTOS HAVE HELD UP; TECH AND TRUCKS ARE HURTING 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.   We cannot explain the causes, or predict the 
consequences, of the \"millennium trade bust.\"  However, we 
can point out some of the notable sectoral features of 
bilateral trade patterns over the past five years: 
 
-- Annual two-way trade in computers, electronic 
components and telecom equipment crashed by 47 percent 
(US$14 billion) over the past two years. 
 
-- The acceleration in Canada\'s oil, gas and petroleum 
product exports to the United States contributed to the 
millennium \"spike\" by adding nearly US$18 billion to 
our annual imports from Canada in 1999 and 2000.  But 
unlike some other \"boom\" sectors, these flows have 
since held up well:  they continued growing into 2001 
and declined only modestly in 2002. 
 
-- Passenger cars and trucks - the single biggest 
category in U.S.-Canada trade - has also held more or 
less steady.  On the other hand, two-way trade in heavy 
trucks fell by 38 percent from 1999 to 2002. 
 
PHARMACEUTICALS:  A CLUE TO THE SCALE OF RE-IMPORTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6.   Among major categories of U.S. exports to Canada, the 
strongest percentage growth has been in pharmaceuticals. 
Over the past four years (2002 over 1998), Canada\'s imports 
of pharmaceuticals from the U.S. swelled by 65 percent. 
Imports of pharmaceuticals from all other countries grew by 
125 percent.  COMMENT:  As Canadian authorities found with 
cross-border cigarette smuggling in the early 1990\'s, these 
figures may provide a sense of the extent to which U.S.-made 
products are being \"cycled\" through Canada and re-imported 
to U.S. consumers.

2. As of 13:00 EDT, April 10, 2003, Health Canada has 
received reports of 253 probable or suspect cases of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. 
The distributions of the cases to date are as follows: 
  -- Ontario is reporting 95 probable and 111 suspect 
  cases.  All cases have occurred in persons who have 
  traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in 
  the household or in a health-care setting. (See 
  Toronto reporting for more detail on the situation 
  in Ontario). 
  -- British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 32 
  suspect cases. 
  -- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. 
  -- Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. 
  -- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. 
  -- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect 
  cases. 
 
3. Fatalities: 
 
  -- No change: 10, all clustered in Toronto, Ontario. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Protecting Canada\'s Blood Supply 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  As a precautionary measure to protect the blood 
supply in Canada and recipients from the possible 
threat of SARS, Health Canada has directed the Canadian 
Blood Service and Hma-Quebec to temporarily exclude 
persons who meet the following profile from donating 
blood (for a period of 10 days): 
  -- traveled within the previous 10 days to an 
  affected area outside Canada. The affected areas are 
  currently: China, including the Hong Kong Special 
  Administrative Region; Hanoi, Vietnam; Singapore and 
  Taiwan; 
  -- been a patient, worked in, or visited a facility 
  that is under quarantine for SARS. 
 
5. Health Canada has also requested that provincial 
public health officials, when investigating possible 
SARS cases, ask whether the individual has donated 
blood.  If the individual has donated blood within 10 
days prior to the first day of symptoms, public health 
officials are asked to notify Canadian Blood Services 
and Hma-Qubec.  In such cases the donor\'s blood and 
blood products will be withdrawn from inventory.

Information to trace travelers 
------------------------------- 
 
6. Beginning Thursday, April 10th, as an added 
precautionary measure, Health Canada has arranged for 
in-flight distribution of a health alert card to 
passengers on all direct flights to Canada from Hong 
Kong, Singapore and Beijing. 
 
7. Flight attendants will also ask passengers to fill 
out a traveler tracing form (also known as contact 
information cards) that will enable health authorities 
to contact passengers over a two-week period after 
their arrival in Canada, if necessary.  These forms 
must be filled out before clearing customs.  Upon 
arrival, Health Canada staff will gather these contact 
forms from passengers.  Health Canada anticipates that 
this in-flight distribution will also be expanded to 
direct flights from other Asian destinations in the 
near future - but no details are as yet available.

SUBJECT:  THE SILENT MAJORITY:  CANADIAN OPINION OF THE U.S. 
AND THE WAR IN IRAQ 
 
Ref:  a) Ottawa 723; b) Ottawa 917 (C); c) Ottawa 1014; d) 
 
Quebec 51 (NOTAL) 
 
1. Summary. Ambassador Cellucci\'s public expression, March 
25, of U.S. \"disappointment\" over the Canadian government\'s 
posture on the war in Iraq has led to an outpouring of 
response from the general public.  Since the speech, public 
opinion polls have consistently shown growing public 
approval of U.S. action in Iraq.  Other anecdotal evidence, 
including public demonstrations and write-in campaigns to 
the Embassy, suggest far greater support from Canadians for 
the U.S. than could be inferred from Canadian media reports 
and government statements.  These indicators, however, show 
a divide between Anglophone Canada and Quebec, where a 
majority continue to oppose the war (reftel d), in part 
because much of their news comes from France.  End Summary. 
 
PUBLIC OPINION POLLING - GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. IN 
ANGLOPHONE CANADA. 
 
2. The latest Ipsos-Reid poll, conducted April 1-3, shows a 
majority of Canadians outside Quebec (54 per cent) support 
U.S. led military action.  Not surprisingly, Albertans are 
the Canadians most likely to express support for the U.S. 
(62 per cent); they are followed by residents of 
Saskatchewan/Manitoba (55 per cent); Ontario (54 percent); 
Atlantic Canada (53 per cent); and British Colombia (51 per 
cent).  Nationally, Canadians are evenly split, with 48 
percent supporting and 48 per cent opposing the U.S. led war 
in Iraq.  In Quebec, however, only 29 per cent express 
support for the war in Iraq. 
 
3. A separate poll, conducted April 4-6 by COMPAS for \"The 
National Post,\" confirms this trend in public opinion.  The 
COMPAS poll finds that 72 per cent of Canadians \"believe 
Canada should have supported the U.S. at the start of the 
war.\"  That figure breaks down into 41 per cent who believe 
Canada should have given \"verbal support\" to the U.S. at the 
beginning of the war; and another 31 percent who say that 
Canadian support should have included a commitment of troops 
as well as verbal support.  However, a much smaller 
majority, 56 percent, agree with the original U.S. decision 
to invade Iraq. 
 
OTHER INDICATORS OF SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. - PUBLIC 
DEMONSTRATIONS. 
 
4. Since the invasion of Iraq, public demonstrations have 
been common in many of Canada\'s major cities.  Ottawa has 
witnessed regular anti-war and anti-U.S. demonstrations. 
Typically, those demonstrations have convened on Parliament 
Hill about noon on Saturday and circle the Embassy 
throughout Saturday afternoon.  The demonstrations of March 
29 were far different.  Despite a cold, steady rain, a group 
of 4,000 to 5,000, the largest since the onset of combat 
operations, rallied on Parliament Hill to demonstrate 
support for the coalition, with U.S. and UK flags on 
prominent display.  This contrasted with about 500 anti-war 
demonstrators who appeared near the Embassy.  On the same 
day there were also large \"friends of the USA\" 
demonstrations in Calgary and other communities in Alberta 
March 29.  A similar pro-U.S. rally drew about 4,000 in 
Toronto April 5 during one of the worst ice storms of the 
season. 
 
LETTERS FROM THE PUBLIC TO THE EMBASSY. 
 
5. Following Ambassador Cellucci\'s speech in Toronto, the 
Embassy was deluged with calls, e-mails and letters from the 
public.  Initially, the mailed letters were overwhelmingly 
supportive of the U.S. position, while electronic messages 
were largely critical.  In the past week, those 
communications have been more nearly balanced.  To date, the 
Embassy in Ottawa has received close to 600 letters 
supporting the U.S. and about 450 that are critical.  The 
Embassy in Ottawa has received about 150 e-mails that are 
supportive and about 250 that are critical. 
 
COMMENT. 
 
6. The polling data and the public response indicates there 
is more of a \"silent majority\" of Canadians outside Quebec, 
that supports U.S. action in Iraq than would be supposed 
from Canadian media coverage and commentary.  The polling 
data and public response also reinforce our observation that 
on this issue, Canadian media reporting and commentary are 
significantly driven by official Canadian government 
statements and by statements from the Liberal Party caucus. 
 
7. As for Quebec public opinion, a leading Quebec pollster 
suggested that Quebeckers receive a significant portion of 
their information from French sources.  TV5 is available on 
the ubiquitous cable channels, and Agence France Presse is 
frequently used by the Francophone media.  Given the sharply 
negative French take on Iraq, this pollster thought this 
accounted for at least part of the divergence with the rest 
of Canada. 
 
8. One thoughtful media pundit suggested that there is a 
large segment of the Canadian public who, whether or not 
they support Canada\'s direct involvement in the war, are 
deeply troubled that Canada is not supporting its two 
traditional allies, the U.S. and the U.K.  How these 
sentiments of the public may affect substantive Canadian 
support for large-scale humanitarian assistance and 
reconstruction efforts in Iraq remains to be seen.  END 
COMMENT.

1. (S) We discussed reftel (A) demarche with Chris Hull, 
Foreign Affairs Desk Officer for Iraq, on April 11.  Hull 
told us that the GoC continues to monitor closely the 
activities of the one Iraqi diplomat remaining in country, 
Charge Mamdouh Mustafa, and had no indication that he was 
destroying Iraqi Government records or property.  Hull noted 
that the GoC was looking for an opportunity to remove items 
of an \"undiplomatic nature\" (nfi) from the premises of the 
Iraqi Embassy. 
 
2. (S) Mustafa, Hull continued, has given no indication of 
his future plans.  Hull saw no basis for him to be granted 
refugee status, but said that if Mustafa makes such a claim 
he could remain in Canada while his case is being reviewed. 
The GoC could also decide to declare him persona non grata. 
The RCMP is providing security for the Iraqi Embassy and is 
escorting Mustafa due to concerns about potential 
demonstrators. 
 
3. (S) COMMENT: The GoC has been very helpful to us in 
working with Mustafa, and we have concurred with their 
reasons for not expelling him from Canada (ref. B).  The GoC 
is now taking a wait-and-see approach on how to deal with 
him.  The Foreign Affairs spokesperson has said it would be 
up to the new Iraqi Government to decide whether to withdraw 
current diplomats.

       GOC SIGNALS A MORE PRO-COMPETITIVE STANCE 
 
REF:  (A) 02 OTTAWA 3290 
 
      (B) 02 OTTAWA 1488 
 
1.   (U) This message is sensitive, but unclassified. 
Please treat accordingly. 
 
2.   (U) SUMMARY:  Canada is clearly shifting its policy on 
telecommunications competition toward a more pro-competitive 
model. 
 
-- Following extensive public hearings, in late April a key 
Parliamentary committee is expected to call for a sweeping 
re-examination of the GOC\'s foreign ownership restrictions 
in communications industries. 
 
-- During March the Minister of Industry called on the GOC\'s 
telecom regulator to promote greater competition in local 
phone service.  Accordingly, on April 10 the regulator 
issued a public notice saying that major incumbent telcos 
had broken various regulations in a pattern of anti- 
competitive conduct, and that it will undertake spot 
inspections to uncover and prosecute such behavior. 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.   (U) BACKGROUND:  Canada\'s communications regulatory 
agency is the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).  The GOC\'s Departments 
of Industry (for telecoms) and Canadian Heritage (for 
broadcasting) determine policy.  In telecoms, the shift from 
monopoly to competition began in the early 1990\'s, but 
progress slowed after a few years: the major incumbent firms 
retained dominant market shares, and newer entrants had 
difficulty becoming profitable.  The latter complained in 
particular of two barriers to competition:  (1) restrictions 
on the degree of foreign ownership of telecom carriers, and 
(2) the level of \"contributions\" which new entrants had to 
pay to incumbents for the use of their facilities. 
 
4.   (SBU) In January 2002, Charles Dalfen became Chairman 
of the CRTC.  Observers have been consistently positive 
about the prospects for a more pro-competitive regulatory 
regime under Dalfen\'s leadership.  On May 30, 2002, in a 
decision that made both sides about equally unhappy, the 
CRTC set out ground rules for competition in local telephone 
service (ref B).  Since then, observers say, CRTC 
decisionmaking on telecoms has begun to move more quickly 
and has shown signs of becoming more favorable to smaller 
competitors. 
 
5.   (U) OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS:  Foreign ownership of 
telecom carriers in Canada is restricted to direct ownership 
of no more than 20 percent of voting shares, and no more 
than one-third of indirect ownership, effectively limiting 
foreign ownership to a maximum of 46.7 percent of any 
carrier.  U.S.-based telecom interests pressed the GOC in 
1999-2001 to review these restrictions, without immediate 
success. 
 
6.   (SBU) In late 2002 Industry Minister Allan Rock asked 
the House of Commons Committee on Industry to examine this 
issue (ref A).  Having held extensive hearings, the 
Committee will release its report on April 28.  According to 
press reports and contacts, the report will take a favorable 
view of relaxing the restrictions.  In light of the 
inextricable competitive links between telecommunications 
and other media which are outside the Committee\'s (and 
Minister Rock\'s) mandate, the report will advise the GOC to 
hold a broader review covering ownership restrictions 
affecting all these industries. 
 
6.   (U) LOCAL SERVICE COMPETITION: In a speech on March 26, 
Minister Rock said that the GOC \"expects that the CRTC will 
continue to show its commitment to maintaining pro- 
competition momentum . . .  (L)ocal competition is virtually 
non-existent in all but our largest cities. We would like to 
see the CRTC consider what additional measures it can take 
to promote competition . . . the Government of Canada will 
closely monitor the evolution of competition to ensure that 
it does not deteriorate.\" 
 
7.   (U) On April 10, the CRTC issued a public notice on 
regulatory compliance (no. 2003-4 at crtc.gc.ca) which 
listed a variety of known infractions of tariffs, rules 
and/or legislation by incumbent telecom firms.  Suggesting 
that a complaints-based enforcement system had not been 
adequate, the CRTC announced that it would designate 
inspectors to verify compliance by conducting unannounced 
inspections of these firms, which could begin anytime after 
June 19, 2003. 
 
8.   (SBU) COMMENT:  While industry observers and 
competitive firms received this announcement favorably, the 
extent to which the CRTC will follow through remains to be 
seen.  A spokesperson for the largest incumbent, Bell 
Canada, was quoted arguing that determinations of past 
\"infractions\" had been based on \"erroneous\" information from 
competitors, and that it would be more accurate to say that 
the CRTC and incumbent firms are in \"disagreement\" over 
\"complex and arcane\" rules.  Skeptics would note that the 
large incumbents have been perennially effective at winning 
the \"regulatory affairs game\" vis--vis smaller firms, 
mainly by casting themselves as instruments of public 
policy.  In post\'s view, while Minister Rock\'s call for 
greater competition provided a short-term push, progress 
depends on the appetite of CRTC Chairman Dalfen for 
substantial change.  Higher-level GOC policies, including 
the foreign ownership issue, will likely be hostage to the 
coming Liberal Party leadership transition and subsequent 
election, which will distract GOC ministers until sometime 
in 2004.

TAGS: PGOV, CA, Liberal Party 
SUBJECT: CANADIAN POLITICS: QUEBEC LIBERAL PARTY 
VICTORY--WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
 
REF: QUEBEC 55 
 
1. By most accounts, the surprise victory of the Quebec 
Liberal Party (QLP) in the  April 14 elections has sounded 
the death knell for the separatist agenda.  In the words of 
one pundit, QLP leader Jean Charest \"is the first unambiguous 
federalist to head a Quebec government in decades, a sign of 
how much sovereignty (...) has turned into a dormant issue.\" 
At the same time, Bloc Quebecois (the federal party) leader 
Gilles Duceppe and others assert that 45 percent of Quebec 
remains \"sovereigntist\" at heart and will keep the hope of a 
separate Quebec alive by voting for the Bloc nationally. 
 
2. Both PM Chretien and his likely successor, Paul Martin, 
have said they are pleased with the electoral outcome. 
Martin graciously attributed this \"federalist\" victory in 
Quebec to the retiring PM\'s tenacity on federation throughout 
his tenure in politics.  Other observers of the 
federal-provincial dynamic, however, caution that Charest, 
for all his \"federalist\" credentials, is a strong proponent 
of decentralization and thus likely to be more or a thorn in 
the side of government on health care, housing, and other 
issues that depend on federal funding allotments. 
Nonetheless, the prospect of not having to deal with the 
issue of sovereignty bodes well for Canada\'s next Prime 
Minister, whoever he or she may be.  As the constitutional 
critic for the Opposition (Canadian Alliance) told the press, 
this is the first time in a long while that the threat of a 
referendum \"will not be hanging over our head.\"

REFTEL: STATE 85946 
 
WE SOLICITED RESPONSES TO THE REFTEL SURVEY FROM INDUSTRY 
CANADA\'S DIRECTOR FOR SPECTRUM AND RADIO POLICY FERNAND 
LEGER.  THE RESPONSES ARE LETTERED ACCORDING TO THE 
QUESTIONS LISTED IN REFTEL: 
 
A) Canada has designated several bands for license-exempt 
operations including those currently of interest to Wi- 
Fi\\802.11 b\\a\\g standards and similar wireless 
communication products (i.e. the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.) 
 
The band 2400-2483.5 MHz is available for a wide variety 
of license-exempt applications and products including Wi- 
Fi (802.11b standard) and higher power point-to-point 
communications systems using directional antennas.  The 
Industry Canada (IC) rules for 2.4 GHz 
(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01918e.html) and 5 GHz 
(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01915e.html) spectrum 
designations align with the FCC Part 15 Rules. 
 
In Canada the designations for wireless LANS are: 
--band 5150-5250 MHz - lower (relatively) power devices 
to operate indoors (200 mW eirp max) 
--band 5250-5350 MHZ - medium power, outdoor operation is 
allowed (250 mW tx pwr, 1W eirp/11 dBm/MHz) 
--band 5725-5825 MHz - higher power, outdoor operation is 
allowed (1 W tx pwr, 4W eirp/17 dBm/MHz) 
--band 5725-5850 MHZ - devices are allowed to operate 
point-to-point with directional antennas.  This band is 
also designated for a range of lower power license-exempt 
devices.  The technical rules for operation and 
certification of equipment are detailed in the Canadian 
Radio Standard Specifications (RSS) 210 
(strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf01320e.html) 
 
General information on the Government of Canada\'s (GOC) 
spectrum policies can be found at: 
//strategis.ic.gc.ca/sc_mrksv/spectrum/engdoc /spect1.html 
?icservices=e._ 
 
B) License-exempt operation of equipment certified as Wi- 
Fi (802.11) is permitted in bands designated in the 2.4 
GHz and 5 GHz ranges. 
 
C) Commercial applications of Wi-Fi systems are permitted 
and encouraged.  License-exempt devices may constitute 
transmission facilities to provide public 
telecommunications services as defined in the Canadian 
Telecommunications Act.  Operators of license-exempt 
transmission links may need to seek approval for antennas 
and tower structures, and follow Industry Canada\'s 
procedures for use of radio spectrum. 
 
D) With the phenomenal uptake of Wi-Fi products to access 
high-speed Internet by consumer and business users, a 
number of traditional wireline and wireless carriers, new 
service providers and ISPs offering high-speed Internet 
have accelerated market trials for both Wi-Fi public 
hotspots and use of Wi-Fi for providing high-speed 
Internet access in urban areas.  Interest in providing 
high-speed Internet service using Wi-Fi technology is 
also emerging in rural areas and sub-urban areas, where 
the potential of interference is relatively low. 
 
E and F) Private service providers are becoming 
increasingly interested in using Wi-Fi products with more 
directive antennas that provide longer reach to customers 
in rural communities and surrounding areas.  A number of 
rural communities have access to high speed Internet 
using a range of technologies including license-exempt 
products such as Wi-Fi access. Wi-Fi is used in schools, 
libraries, and health centers and governments offices in 
rural communities.  Information on Canadian wireless 
ISP\'s can be found at: 
www.onelasvegas.com/wireless/wireless_ISP_Can ada.html 
 
Fixed wireless access technology, of all kinds, is an 
important element of the GOC objective to enable the 
development of a range of broadband Internet access 
technologies to provide for under-served rural 
communities.  Industry Canada has a Broadband Pilot 
Program (www.broadband.gc.ca/index_e.asp.) aimed at 
encouraging the development of broadband services in a 
number of rural and remote communities that are currently 
not served by high-speed Internet.  Several rural 
communities have been provided financing to carry out 
business studies and seek requests for proposals to 
establish the cost of transport systems (where required) 
and local broadband access facilities using a mixture of 
wireline\\wireless technologies, including fibre optics, 
digital microwave systems and satellite transmission.  In 
the next phase of the program the communities will 
present business and technical plans as part of their 
applications to Industry Canada for financial assistance 
to implement broadband service. Industry Canada 
anticipates that some of these applications will use 
wireline\\wireless facilities. This will include licensed 
and license-exempt local distribution facilities, 
including Wi-Fi technology.

SUBJECT: CANADA-U.S SECURITY RELATIONS - GETTING PAST IRAQ 
TO PURSUE OUR COMMON INTERESTS 
 
REF: (A) OTTAWA 892 (B) OTTAWA 1014 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) With U.S.-Canada relations in flux and the role of the 
United Nations in question, Canadian foreign policy is at a 
crossroads.  The postponement of the President\'s state visit 
to Ottawa, after Canada chose not to participate in Iraq and 
senior GoC officials criticized the U.S.-led effort, has been 
a harsh but necessary reality check for Canada.  We will be 
on better footing after the February 2004 departure of Prime 
Minister Chretien, who prefers to work within international 
institutions even when they prove ineffective, and even when 
doing so damages our bilateral relationship.  Canada will 
still be a strong proponent of multilateralism after 
Chretien\'s departure, but we expect his successor - probably 
ex-Finance Minister Paul Martin - to bring greater balance to 
Canadian foreign policy. 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY CONT\'D: In the meantime, we have a broad 
security agenda that must not languish while we wait for 
Chretien\'s replacement.  From counterterrorist cooperation in 
North America to military deployments in Afghanistan to 
putting pressure on the North Korean and Iranian nuclear 
programs, we need Canada\'s help.  We are also pushing Canada 
to go ahead with a decision to participate in missile 
defense.  While doing so should be a no-brainer, given the 
security benefits for North America as a whole, it would 
represent a major leap for Canadian foreign policy.  If 
Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum can 
convince Chretien to not pass the buck on this decision to 
his successor, then we need to work with the GoC to plug 
NORAD into missile defense command and control for North 
America.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) After the failure of its efforts to \"bridge the 
divide\" at the UN Security Council  and its subsequent 
decision not to participate in the military campaign against 
Iraq (ref. A), Canada finds itself in a awkward position. 
Its \"primordial\" bilateral relationship with the U.S. is 
strained, as was graphically demonstrated by the postponement 
of President Bush\'s May 5 state visit to Ottawa.  The GoC is 
rightly concerned about getting bilateral relations back on 
track, and is looking for ways to do so.  At the same time, 
Canada remains committed to multilateral institutions such as 
the United Nations, and will continue to push for them to 
have a role in dealing with international crises. 
 
---------------------------- 
CHRETIEN UNREPENTANT ON IRAQ 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (C) In the wake of the coalition\'s sweeping military 
victory, public opinion in Canada has swung from majority 
opposition to the war to roughly an even split (ref. B). 
Prime Minister Chretien, however, has been unrepentant.  He 
has maintained that Canada was right to not participate in 
Iraq without UN blessing, and has reiterated his concern 
about military actions aimed at regime change.  A few Liberal 
Party MPs have publicly stated their opposition to Chretien\'s 
decision on Iraq, and press reports indicate that Deputy 
Prime Minister John Manley argued for Canadian participation 
within Cabinet.  Meanwhile, the frontrunner to become the 
next Prime Minister when Chretien steps down in February 
2004, ex-Finance Minister Paul Martin, has criticized 
anti-American rhetoric within the Liberal Party but also said 
that the Prime Minister made the right decision on Iraq. 
This position puts him squarely in the middle of the party 
that will continue to govern Canada for the foreseeable 
future. 
 
---------------------------- 
A ROLE IN POST-CONFLICT IRAQ 
---------------------------- 
 
5. (C) On post-conflict Iraq, the GoC wants to see as much UN 
involvement as possible but has been careful not to get into 
the same box as it did on military action.  Manley has 
explicitly stated that Canada will not wait for UN approval 
to contribute to reconstruction efforts.  Thus far Canada has 
pledged US$70 million for humanitarian assistance, and is 
looking at specific expertise it could offer.  The RCMP, 
which has international experience in countries such as 
Bosnia and Haiti, has been mentioned as a possible source of 
assistance on the police front.  The GoC wants to make a 
significant contribution in Iraq and to get back in our good 
graces.  We need to work with them to find a useful role. 
 
------------------------------ 
WAR ON TERRORISM, ARMS CONTROL 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Despite the rift over Iraq, we need to continue 
working closely with Canada on our national security agenda. 
We have much common ground in the war on terrorism and in 
arms control efforts.  We have worked extremely closely with 
Canada in law enforcement, intelligence and military channels 
on preventing future terrorist attacks in North America. 
Given the massive flows of people and goods between our 
countries, such cooperation is essential. Canada has also 
stepped up to the plate internationally in the war on 
terrorism.  Canada has been one of the biggest contributors 
to Operation Enduring Freedom, and will be supplying 1500 
personnel to ISAF IV and V beginning in August. 
 
7. (C) On the arms control front, Canada shares our strong 
concerns about the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, 
has denounced the DPRK\'s withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, and has pushed for censure of Iran 
at the IAEA.  Canada will continue to be a valuable ally in 
multilateral arms control fora, where it has considerable 
expertise and can serve as a bridge to other countries. 
 
--------------- 
MISSILE DEFENSE 
--------------- 
 
8. (C) The big question now for the bilateral security 
relationship is missile defense.  Foreign Minister Graham and 
Defense Minister McCallum agreed in fall 2002 that Canada 
should participate in missile defense, and they are trying to 
gain Cabinet blessing to negotiate an agreement on 
participation with us.  Graham and McCallum are trying to 
allay longstanding Canadian concerns that such a system would 
damage arms control efforts, particularly the weaponization 
of space. 
 
9. (C) The deciding factor, as for all major GoC decisions, 
will be Chretien.  He has indicated a willingness for Cabinet 
to consider the issue, and he usually does not do so unless 
he is favorably disposed.  DFAIT and DND still expect missile 
defense to be taken up by Cabinet in the coming weeks, but do 
not yet have a clear sense of how the Prime Minister is 
leaning.  We know there will be opposition from some of the 
more left-leaning members of Cabinet.  Chretien can squash 
them if he chooses, and push this through.  Or he can decide 
that he does not want missile defense participation to be 
part of his legacy, and put off consideration by Cabinet. 
 
10. (C) Like on the issue of Iraqi reconstruction, we should 
engage Canada in a significant way if it chooses to 
participate in missile defense.  In particular, we should 
find a way to plug NORAD into missile defense command and 
control for North America.  This would be at the top of 
Canada\'s priority list for an agreement with us, as the GoC 
fears that NORAD will wither away if it is not involved in 
missile defense.  We will need to show some flexibility on 
this issue, despite the recent assignment of missile defense 
regional oversight to NORTHCOM, in order to help our allies 
sell a missile defense agreement in Ottawa.

(C) Poloff conferred with Lisa Helfand, Deputy Director of

to be a candidate for the OSCE chair in 2006, for a couple of 
reasons. First, a decision to seek the chairmanship would 
need to be made by the Prime Minister, and Canada will have a 
new prime minister in less than a year\'s time. Second, while 
acknowledging that holding the OSCE chair makes sense for 
Canada politically and in terms of its foreign policy 
interests, Helfand indicated the costs and logistics involved 
in serving as chair from this side of the Atlantic are 
prohibitive for Canada. (Comment: The financial burden cited 
by Helfand would also seem to argue against future OSCE 
chairmanships for Canada.)

Summary 
------- 
 
1. An alliance of the Canadian federal government, 
Ontario provincial government, automotive sector 
manufacturers and labor unions are working to define 
and implement a long-term strategy to keep the Canadian 
automotive sector competitive (Ref B).  At least one 
element of the multi-prong strategy, the elimination of 
the federal and provincial capital tax, has already 
been embarked upon.  Implementation of the new strategy 
is expected to be a multi-year process with no firm 
timeline.  It is, however, very clear from statements 
given by both the manufacturing sector and government 
that all elements of the nascent auto strategy will 
scrupulously comply with WTO and NAFTA ground rules. 
End summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Scale of Automotive Industry in Canada 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. The importance of the automotive industry to the 
Canadian economy cannot be overstated.  It is a major 
contributor to the Canadian economy, creating more than 
550,000 jobs, and generates approximately 12 per cent 
of the manufacturing sector\'s contribution to Canada\'s 
Gross Domestic Product.  The automotive sector also has 
seen the highest capital investment of all 
manufacturing industries.  Between 1991 and 2001, 
capital investment averaged C$2.9 billion per year. 
The Canadian automotive industry is fully integrated 
into the North American market.  In 2001, the 
automotive industry produced C$95 billion worth of 
motor vehicles - 90 per cent of which were exported, 
primarily to the United States. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
New Policy to strengthen automotive industry 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. The maintenance of this vital industrial sector is 
important to the federal government and to the Ontario 
provincial government, where most of the manufacturing 
capacity is located.  It is, however, a collection of 
government, labor, and corporate interests that 
comprises the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council 
(CAPC) that is in the process of developing a long-term 
strategic vision for the industry to ensure its growth 
and vitality.  Its membership includes the presidents 
of Canada\'s automotive assembly companies; senior 
executives from the parts, aftermarket, dealership and 
academic sectors; the president of the Canadian Auto 
Workers Union (Buzz Hargrove); and ministers of 
industry and/or economic development for the federal, 
Ontario and Quebec governments.  The Council is co- 
chaired by Michael Grimaldi, President of General 
Motors of Canada, and Don Walker, President of Intier 
Automotive, one of Canada\'s most significant automotive 
components manufacturers. 
 
4. CAPC members met in Toronto in mid-December 2002 and 
reviewed a series of papers drafted by working groups 
that address five key dimensions of the nascent 
strategy: human resources; innovation; trade 
infrastructure; fiscal and investment measures; and 
regulatory harmonization.  These draft papers, and more 
about CAPC are available at the following URL: 
 
http://www.strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/am01451e.ht ml 
 
5. The key questions raised in Ref A focus on fiscal 
and investment measures, the relevant CAPC proposals in 
this domain are outlined below. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
CAPC Fiscal & Investment Recommendations 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  The CAPC Fiscal and Investment Policy Work Group 
recommends that the federal and provincial governments: 
 
-- Eliminate the federal Large Corporations Tax (a.k.a. 
the Capital Tax) and provincial capital taxes to remove 
a key impediment (see paragraph 9). 
 
-- Establish an Investment Tax Credit to encourage 
investment in new manufacturing machinery and 
equipment. 
 
-- Continue and expand the Manufacturing & Processing 
(M&P) deduction (a 7% deduction exclusive to M&P 
profits which the GoC is considering abolishing) to 
reduce the effective federal and provincial rates to 
gain a competitive tax advantage in NAFTA. 
 
7. The CAPC group makes clear that any effort to 
provide an investment incentive must be transparent, 
available to all on equal footing (unlike the exclusive 
\"Autopact\" arrangements) and consistent with WTO and 
NAFTA rules. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
What is the timetable for implementation? 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. On the question of a timetable, the message we 
received from Guy Leclaire, Director of Automotive 
Policy at the Department of Industry (Industry Canada) 
is that the Canadian Automotive Strategy is a work in 
progress and that there is no firm timetable for 
implementation. 
 
9. Nevertheless, one major element has been embarked 
upon.  The elimination of the federal capital tax 
proposed in the federal budget of February 18, 2003 
implements a principal recommendation of the CAPC. 
 
10. Both the federal and provincial governments in 
Canada levy taxes on the capital of corporations. 
Unlike income taxes, which are paid when a corporation 
has taxable income, capital taxes must be paid 
regardless of whether a corporation is profitable.  The 
federal capital tax is levied on all corporations with 
more than $10 million of capital used in Canada; it is 
reduced by the income surtax paid by the corporation 
(Ref D). 
 
11. The February 2003 federal budget proposed to 
eliminate the federal capital tax, as follows: - First, 
the capital threshold at which the tax applies will be 
raised, from $10 million to $50 million effective 2004. 
As of 2004 medium-sized businesses under the $50- 
million threshold will no longer have to pay the tax. 
Second, the rate of the tax will be reduced in stages 
over a period of five years so that by 2008, the tax 
will be completely eliminated. 
 
12. At the provincial level, Ontario\'s 2003 budget 
(delivered in late March) also promised to eliminate 
the capital tax, though a 10% cut in 2004 and complete 
phasing out by 2008, in line with the federal 
government\'s plans (ref C).  Ontario\'s decision to 
start phasing out capital taxes follows similar 
decisions in Alberta and the three Territories, where 
capital taxes already have been eliminated, as well as 
in British Columbia and Quebec, where concrete cuts 
have been announced in recent budgets (Ref D). 
 
13. According to the GoC the elimination of the capital 
tax over five years will be fully legislated in order 
to provide businesses and investors with the certainty 
needed to factor the tax reduction into their business 
decisions.  The GoC budget documents also allege that 
when the federal capital tax is eliminated in 2008, the 
average combined federal and provincial corporate tax 
rate in Canada will be 6.6 percentage points lower than 
in the U.S 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. Leclaire emphasized that the Auto Strategy is 
intended to be more than simply a wish list for 
handouts from the government to industry.  Rather, 
Leclaire expects it will be an effort largely to match, 
or refine, existing government efforts (provincial and 
federal) with industry requirements.  For example, 
suggestions include eliminating regulatory impediments 
to investment (such as different manufacturing 
standards in USA and Canada); targeting more R&D funds 
to the automotive sector and making more auto R&D 
eligible for R&D tax credits; and providing more 
targeted investment in technical education to provide 
the workforce of the future. 
 
15. Most significantly, there is no proposal for a 
local content requirement in any of the elements of the 
CAPC proposals.  The musings of CAW chief Buzz Hargrove 
(Refs A,B) in this respect are not indicative of the 
eventual GoC policy direction, nor industry intentions. 
And although the CAPC does recommend an Investment Tax 
Credit to entice investment in physical plant, it 
remains simply a recommendation whose form is not 
elaborated and one that has not yet been seized upon by 
government. 
 
16. The clear message we have received from GoC 
interlocutors, one which is reiterated by CAPC, is that 
whatever the eventual size and shape of the Canadian 
Auto Strategy it will comply scrupulously with WTO and 
NAFTA strictures.

SUBJECT: ALBERTA ENERGY LEADERS ON GOOD NEWS, WORRIES 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - NOT FOR RELEASE OUTSIDE USG. 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  ALBERTA ENERGY 
SECTOR LEADERS SUPPORT U.S. GOALS IN IRAQ, ARE VERY 
PLEASED THE U.S. ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (EIA) 
HAS BEGUN TO TREAT OIL SANDS AS PROVEN RESERVES AND ARE 
CONCERNED THAT NORTH AMERICA IS BECOMING OVERLY RELIANT 
ON NATURAL GAS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION.  ALTHOUGH 
HARDLY SURPRISING IN U.S.-FRIENDLY ALBERTA, DURING 
MEETINGS THE WEEK OF APRIL 7, CALGARY CG CHAVERA AND 
EMBASSY ENERGY OFFICER ALL BUT HAD TO CUT OFF PRO- 
WASHINGTON, ANTI-OTTAWA TIRADES BY BOTH PROVINCIAL 
MINISTERS AND ENERGY EXECUTIVES, WHO NOT ONLY BROADLY 
SUPPORT U.S. POLICY IN IRAQ, BUT EVEN MORE INTENSELY 
RESENT THE FACT THAT \"THEIR MINISTER\" (FEDERAL NATURAL 
RESOURCES MINISTER HERB DHALIWAL) CALLED THE PRESIDENT A 
\"FAILED STATESMAN\" AND WAS NOT REBUKED BY PRIME MINISTER 
CHRETIEN.  CG AND ENERGY OFFICER ASSURED THEM THAT WHILE 
THE DISAPPOINTMENT AMBASSADOR CELLUCCI EXPRESSED WITH THE 
GOC OVER IRAQ POLICY IS VERY REAL AND OUR DISMAY AT 
DHALIWAL\'S STATEMENT IS DEEP, OUR FRUSTRATION HAS NOTHING 
TO DO WITH OUR ENERGY RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WE VALUE 
GREATLY. 
 
2.  (SBU) A NUMBER OF THESE SAME INTERLOCUTORS NOTED HOW 
PLEASED THEY WERE BY EIA\'S NEW DATA SHOWING CANADA WITH 
180 BILLION BARRELS OF TOTAL PROVEN RESERVES, SECOND ONLY 
TO SAUDI ARABIA AND WELL AHEAD OF NUMBER THREE IRAQ.  AT 
THE SAME TIME THEY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE PIPELINE 
AND REFINERY CAPACITY FOR HEAVY CRUDE, ESPECIALLY AS OIL 
SANDS OUTPUT NEARS ONE MILLION BARRELS PER DAY (BPD) AND 
STARTS ON WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A 5-10 YEAR ROAD TO THE 
SECOND MILLION.  WE ALSO HEARD GREAT ENTHUSIASM FOR 
BRINGING THE ARCTIC GAS RESERVES OF CANADA\'S MACKENZIE 
BASIN (FIRST) AND THEN ALASKA\'S PRUDHOE BAY TO MARKET, 
COUPLED WITH CONCERN THAT EVEN THESE LARGE DEPOSITS WILL 
ONLY HELP NORTH AMERICA TO KEEP TREADING WATER ON GAS 
SUPPLIES AS WE BUILD MORE AND MORE GAS-FIRED GENERATION. 
THE ALBERTA LEADERSHIP ALSO CONTINUES TO HAVE CLIMATE 
CHANGE AND CANADA\'S KYOTO IMPLEMENTATION PLANS MUCH ON 
ITS MINDS, BUT SEEMS NOW TO FEEL THAT THE \"DAMAGE COMING 
FROM OTTAWA\" CAN BE MANAGED.  PROVINCIAL ENERGY MINISTER 
MURRAY SMITH LOOKS FORWARD TO A PLANNED EARLY JUNE TRIP 
TO WASHINGTON AT WHICH TIME HE HOPES TO MEET WITH U/S 
LARSON AND A/S WAYNE.  WE RECOMMEND GRANTING SMITH AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE MEETINGS AS HE IS VERY WELL-INFORMED 
AND INFLUENTIAL.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
OIL SANDS: GOOD NEWS AND FUTURE WORRIES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) MINISTER SMITH, CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF 
PETROLEUM PRODUCERS (CAPP) PRESIDENT PIERRE Alvarez_ AND 
EXECUTIVES FROM BP AND PETROCANADA WERE UNITED IN 
EXPRESSING PLEASURE AND APPRECIATE FOR U.S. EIA\'S RECENT 
DECISION TO REFERENCE THE \"OIL AND GAS JOURNAL\'S\" 
TREATMENT OF OIL SANDS AS \"PROVEN RESERVES\" ON THE ORDER 
OF 175 BILLION BARRELS.  THEY HAILED THIS AS A BIG WIN 
FOR THE OIL SANDS INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND AT LEAST A 
SYMBOLIC VICTORY FOR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY.  AT 
THE SAME TIME, BP CANADA CEO TIM FAITHFUL AND OTHERS 
NOTED THAT WITH MOST OIL SANDS PROJECTS RUNNING WELL OVER 
BUDGET THAT THE INDUSTRY IS GOING THROUGH A TOUGH 
DIGESTION PROBLEM AS IT APPROACHES ONE MILLION BPD IN 
OUTPUT.  MINISTER SMITH, CAPP OFFICIALS AND FAITHFUL ALL 
NOTED THAT THE STRAINS ON LABOR SUPPLIES WILL BECOME 
GREATER IN THE NEXT FIVE OR TEN YEARS AS OIL SANDS OUTPUT 
REACHES TWO MILLION BPD.  SOME ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN 
THAT WITH NO NEW REFINERIES BUILT IN NORTH AMERICA IN 
DECADES THAT OUR CAPACITY TO SHIP AND REFINE ALL THIS 
HEAVY CRUDE WILL BE CHALLENGED.  SOME NOTED THAT WITH 
MORE BLENDS OF EVER CLEANER GASOLINE REQUIRED, THAT 
LOOKING STRATEGICALLY AT PIPELINE AND REFINING CAPACITY 
WILL BE NEEDED FOR INCREASING OIL SANDS PRODUCTION IN THE 
FUTURE, ESPECIALLY FURTHER OUT AS IT MOVES BEYOND TWO 
MILLION BPD.  IN THEIR VIEW, COORDINATED 
ENVIRONMENTAL/AIR QUALITY POLICIES WILL BE INCREASINGLY 
IMPORTANT AS WE DEAL WITH RISING OUTPUT AND USE OF HEAVY 
CRUDE. 
 
4.  (SBU) SMITH AND OTHERS ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE USG IS AWARE THAT OVER TIME THERE WILL BE TREMENDOUS 
ELECTRICITY CO-GENERATION AVAILABLE AS A RESULT OF THE 
HUGE THERMAL NEEDS OF THE OIL SANDS REFINING PROCESS. 
THIS COULD OVER TIME MAKE SIGNIFICANT NEW ELECTRICITY 
EXPORTS AVAILABLE TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT AT LEAST FOR 
NOW THERE IS LIMITED CAPACITY TO MOVE THIS WEST AND THEN 
SOUTH THROUGH BRITISH COLUMBIA AND ON TO OUR PACIFIC 
NORTHWEST.  THERE IS ALMOST NO CAPACITY TO MOVE IT SOUTH 
INTO THE U.S. ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES AND MARKETS FURTHER 
AFIELD.  ALBERTANS SEE THIS AS A PROMISING ISSUE FOR 
FUTURE PROVINCIAL-STATE, WASHINGTON-OTTAWA AND REGULATOR 
TO REGULATOR COORDINATION. 
 
ARCTIC GAS IS GREAT, BUT WHERE IS THE REST? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) AS ALWAYS, ALBERTANS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR ARE 
FOLLOWING ARCTIC GAS DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING ON THE 
LEGISLATIVE FRONT IN WASHINGTON, VERY CLOSELY.  THE 
WIDELY HELD VIEW IN ALBERTA THAT THE SMALLER MACKENZIE 
LINE WILL BEAT THE MAMMOTH PRUDHOE BAY PROJECT TO THE 
PERMITTING PROCESS AND TO MARKET IS VIEWED AS GOOD NEWS 
FOR CANADA AND FOR BILATERAL RELATIONS.  ALBERTA, AS A 
TRANSIT POINT FOR ANY PRUDHOE BAY LINE, LOOKS FORWARD TO 
SEEING THAT PROJECT BUILT AS WELL, BUT OFFICIALS SUCH AS 
SMITH AND SENIOR INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES REMAIN CONCERNED 
THAT WASHINGTON NOT APPROVE A FISCAL REGIME FOR PRUDHOE 
BAY GAS THAT CREATES INVESTMENT DISINCENTIVES FOR OTHER 
BASINS OR THAT ARTIFICIALLY CREATES A HUGE, SUDDEN JUMP 
IN SUPPLY.  THE KEY TO MOLLIFYING AT LEAST CANADIAN 
ENERGY ELITES IN ALBERTA SEEMS TO LIE IN FINDING A SET OF 
FISCAL AND REGULATORY MEASURES FOR PRUDHOE BAY THAT D0ES 
NOT APPEAR TO DEPART TOO SEVERELY FROM THOSE DEPLOYED 
ELSEWHERE.  THUS, LOAN GUARANTEES AND ACCELERATED 
DEPRECIATION SEEM ACCEPTABLE, WHILE AT LEAST LAST YEAR\'S 
VERSION OF A PRICE FLOOR OR GUARANTEE CAUSES OFFENSE. 
 
6. (SBU) AT THE SAME TIME AS THESE SOPHISTICATED 
OBSERVERS WORRY ABOUT AN OVERLY-GENEROUS PRUDHOE REGIME 
BRINGING TOO MUCH GAS ON-LINE TOO SUDDENLY AND WITH TOO 
LITTLE RISK, THEY ALMOST ALL WORRY THAT NORTH AMERICA IS 
BECOMING OVERLY RELIANT ON NATURAL GAS FOR ELECTRICITY 
GENERATION.  MANY ARGUE THAT EVEN MACKENZIE PLUS PRUDHOE 
BAY WOULD ONLY SUPPLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF WHAT NORTH 
AMERICA MUST REPLACE EVERY YEAR JUST TO TREAD WATER. 
ELDER STATESMAN AND GAS EXPERT JIM GRAY, IN PARTICULAR, 
JUST DOES NOT SEE WHERE ALL THE GAS WILL COME FROM FOR 
OUR INCREASINGLY GAS-DRIVEN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY GROWTH. 
AND ON ARCTIC GAS, HE VARIES FROM THE CROWD IN BELIEVING 
THAT LNG IS MORE ECONOMIC THAN PRUDHOE BAY AND WONDERS IF 
WE WILL NOT MOVE TO LNG AND GAS AS A \"GLOBAL COMMODITY\" 
LONG BEFORE A PRUDHOE BAY LINE IS BUILT.  MINISTER SMITH 
IS CONCERNED THAT BY THE TIME THE U.S. IS IN FULL 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT INADEQUATE GAS SUPPLIES COULD 
CHOKE OFF GROWTH, WHICH HE NOTES IS JUST WHAT THE VICE 
PRESIDENT\'S 2002 REPORT WARNED ABOUT AND CALLED FOR 
MEASURES TO AVOID.  TRANSCANADA PIPELINE SENIOR VP ROBERT 
DAY THINKS GAS DEMAND WILL SO OUTSTRIP SUPPLY FROM 
TRADITIONAL NORTH AMERICAN SOURCES THAT BOTH ARCTIC 
RESERVES AND LARGE IMPORTS OF LNG WILL BE THE TREND OVER 
THE NEXT TEN YEARS.  ALL OF THESE GENTLEMEN CAUTION THAT 
RATHER THAN VIEWING THE WINTER OF 2003 AS AN UNUSUALLY 
COLD ONE, WE SHOULD VIEW IT AS MERELY A RETURN TO 
NORMALCY AND VERY HIGH GAS DEMAND. 
 
CLIMATE CHANGE: BETTER MADE IN EDMONTON THAN OTTAWA 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  (SBU) WHILE DISTRUST OF OTTAWA ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
KYOTO IMPLEMENTATION (AND MOST OTHER THINGS) REMAINS THE 
NORM IN ALBERTA, THE EXTREME HOSTILITY TO OTTAWA-DRIVEN 
POLICY OF A FEW MONTHS AGO HAS MODERATED.  FROM WHAT 
ALBERTA ENVIRONMENT MINISTER LOREN TAYLOR TOLD US, 
ALBERTA IS HOPING TO HAVE ITS \"MADE IN ALBERTA\" CLIMATE 
CHANGE PROGRAM (PERHAPS INCLUDING EMISSIONS TRADING) UP 
AND RUNNING LONG BEFORE OTTAWA HAS ITS KYOTO 
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OPERATIONAL.  THE ALBERTA PLAN WOULD 
BE MODELED IN MANY RESPECTS ON THE MARKET-DRIVEN U.S. 
\"EMISSIONS EFFICIENCY\" APPROACH RATHER THAN THE MORE 
\"COMMAND AND CONTROL\" VERSION THEY SEE AS COMING FROM 
OTTAWA.  TAYLOR ALSO EXPRESSED ENTHUSIASM FOR THE 
PRESIDENT\'S CLEAN SKIES INITIATIVE TO REDUCE NOX, SOX AND 
MERCURY EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS AND IS INTERESTED IN 
A SIMILAR MODEL FOR ALBERTA AND CANADA.  FOR THEIR PART, 
WHILE SUCH INDUSTRY LEADERS AS CAPP\'S Alvarez_, BP\'S 
FAITHFULL AND MIDDLE-MANAGERS AT PETROCANADA ARE ANYTHING 
BUT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT OTTAWA APPROACH TO KYOTO, THEY 
VIEW IT AS MERELY ONE MORE FORM OF RISK TO BE MANAGED. 
MOST SEEM TO TAKE THE VIEW THAT BY THE TIME 
IMPLEMENTATION IS FAR ADVANCED \"PAUL MARTIN WILL BE PM\' 
AND HE \"UNDERSTANDS AND SUPPORTS\" THE OIL AND GAS 
INDUSTRY.  IN THE MEANTIME, THEY ARE NEGOTIATING 
FURIOUSLY WITH WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS A STILL DEEPLY 
FRACTURED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHILE WORRYING AS MUCH OR 
MORE ABOUT COST-OVERRUNS AS THEY ARE ABOUT KYOTO.  FROM 
OUR END, WE HAVE TO AGREE THAT THE NATURAL RESOURCES 
CANADA-ENVIRONMENT CANADA FEUD THAT KYOTO RATIFICATION 
LAST DECEMBER WAS SUPPOSED TO END, IS ALIVE AND WELL AND 
PROBABLY TAKING MORE VICTIMS.  CELLUCCI

1.  The WHO Travel Advisory released on April 23 that 
recommended against travel to Toronto precipitated 
vigorous dissent from the Federal Health Minister Anne 
McLellan, from Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman and from 
provincial and federal public health officials (ref B). 
Deputy Prime Minister John Manley described the WHO 
advisory as \"unwarranted\", although Prime Minister 
Chretien has not joined the fray as he is out of the 
country on vacation.  On April 23 Health Canada sent 
WHO a letter which formally challenged the WHO Travel 
Advisory decision. 
 
2. Meanwhile, for a brief period on April 23 the 
Minister of Health of the province of Nova Scotia, in 
an address to members of the provincial legislature 
urged residents of that province to heed the WHO travel 
advice and avoid travel to Toronto.  The Nova Scotian 
Minister back-tracked after several hours. 
 
3. As of 13:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 22, 
2003 Health Canada has received reports of 324 probable 
or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) in Canada.  To date, transmission has been 
limited to specific transmission settings such as 
households, hospitals and specific community settings. 
The details of the cases to date are as follows: 
 
-- Ontario is reporting 136 probable and 125 suspect 
cases.  This is an increase of 1 probable and 1 suspect 
case since Report #5.  (See Toronto reporting for 
greater detail.  All the 15 Canadian deaths have been 
linked to the Toronto nexus, 14 probable cases and 1 
suspected case.) 
 
-- British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 47 
suspect cases. This is an increase of 6 suspect cases 
since Report #5., see also paragraph 4. 
 
-- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. (No 
change.)

change.) 
 
-- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. (No change) 
 
-- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.

4. According to Press reports, Public Health officials 
in British Columbia are attempting to locate passengers 
who arrived in Vancouver on April 19 on a China 
Airlines flight from New Delhi, India, via Taipei, 
Taiwan.  Eight of the passengers have subsequently 
developed symptoms of SARS.  The flight may have 
carried as many as 250 passengers.  Of the passengers 
who have developed signs of SARS, a two-year-old girl 
and an adult have been hospitalized while the other six 
remain in home isolation.

TAGS: PREL, PREF, CA, MEPP, Iraq 
SUBJECT: MEPP: CANADIAN VIEWS ON POST-IRAQ DYNAMIC, 
CONFERENCE ON PALESTINIAN REFUGEES 
 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Michael Molloy, Canada\'s Special Coordinator 
for the Middle East Peace Process, believes the U.S. victory 
in Iraq will have the biggest impact on the region of any 
event since the 1967 War.  How the U.S. handles the 
post-conflict phase, he told us, will set the tone for the 
West\'s relationship with the Islamic world.  Molloy said that 
most Palestinians are fed up with the intifadah, and that 
Arab states are increasingly willing to compromise on 
refugees in exchange for a Palestinian state.  Israel sees 
the war in Iraq as a reaffirmation of its muscular approach, 
Molloy argued, and the U.S. will have to force Israeli 
concessions on settlements in order to have a breakthrough in 
the MEPP.  Molloy encouraged the USG to send observers to a 
conference Canada is hosting June 17-20 on Palestinian 
refugees (see para 6).  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) We met with Molloy and his staff on April 16 to 
discuss the impact of the war in Iraq on the Middle East 
peace process.  Molloy believes we are at a crossroads in the 
region, with the potential for catastrophe or exceptional 
progress.  He feels the parameters of an Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement are pretty clear - a return to 1967 borders with 
adjustments/offsets, a divided Jerusalem, security provisions 
for Israel, and settlement of refugees. 
 
3. (C) Molloy said that more and more Israelis see the West 
Bank as a liability.  He feels that 13 settlements, with 
11-12,000 Israelis, are key.  If the U.S. was willing to take 
a tough approach with Israel on settlements, Molloy 
contended, it would pay huge dividends in the Arab world. 
 
4. (C) Molloy believes the refugee issue can be resolved with 
very little return to Israel proper, and that Palestine needs 
to be made the destination of choice.  Large-scale 
international funding will be needed, he continued, but money 
alone is not enough.  The dignity of the refugees is also 
important.  Molloy\'s Senior Advisor Jonathan Laine, who 
returned in 2002 from a posting in Ramallah, contended that 
the intifada had killed any chance of refugee return to 
Israel. 
 
5. (C) Molloy said there were indications that Syria and 
other Arab countries would be flexible on refugee 
resettlement in exchange for an agreement on a Palestinian 
state.  He said this subject was no longer taboo, as shown by 
the planned participation of Arab scholars at a July 11-13 
refugee conference at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg. 
 
 
6. (U) Laine noted that the International Development 
Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada will be hosting a conference 
on Palestinian refugees June 17-20 in Ottawa.  This will be a 
stocktaking conference, where international experts will 
discuss existing research on the refugee issue and identify 
gaps where further study is needed.  Confirmed U.S. 
participants include Michael Fischbach, Robert Malley, Martin 
Indyk, Geoffrey Aronson, and Susan Akram.  The Canadian 
Government, which chairs the Refugee Working Group, has 
invited the USG (and other key countries/organizations) to 
send two observers to the conference. 
 
7. (U) Molloy also mentioned that Canada had been asked to 
join a task force on Palestinian reform, and that he would 
want to discuss with State NEA how Canada could be most 
helpful.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. Health Canada provides domestic travel advisory with 
the message: \"It\'s safe to come to Toronto\"; federal 
cabinet to meet in Toronto on April 29 to lead by 
example.  Total cases in Ontario continue to drop, but 
there has been an increase in suspect cases in British 
Columbia.  End summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Domestic Travel Advisory 
------------------------ 
 
2. In an unprecedented step, on April 25, Health Canada 
issued a domestic travel advisory regarding SARS and 
Toronto.  The text reads \"Health Canada advises 
Canadians that travel to any destination in Canada is 
safe and may be undertaken in the same manner as one 
usually would with respect to transport, accommodation, 
meals, entertainment, business and family engagements, 
whether arriving from overseas or traveling 
domestically\". 
 
3. Health Canada does not normally issue travel advice 
with respect to domestic travel.  Canadian Health 
authorities believe, however, that this domestic travel 
advice will provide Canadians with the most accurate 
assessment of the Canadian SARS situation.  The Travel 
Advice can be accessed at: 
 
http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/tmp- 
pmv/2003/sarsdomestic_e.html 
 
4. For the first time since the WHO Travel Advisory was 
released, Prime Minister Chrtien made remarks on SARS. 
In his April 25 remarks in Ottawa at a Genome Science 
exposition, Chrtien noted that Canada is working in 
close partnership with the United States Centers for 
Disease Control and that Canada is very appreciative of 
the CDC effort. 
 
5. He noted too, the fact that the GoC believes that 
the World Health Organization came to the wrong 
conclusion and that Toronto is a safe city.  Chretien 
announced a \"marketing campaign for Toronto and Ontario 
and indeed all of Canada\" to demonstrate there is no 
threat.  The GoC will contribute C$10 million to the 
effort. 
 
6. Moreover, the federal cabinet will meet in Toronto 
on April 29 to demonstrate in a very public way the GoC 
commitment to not let fears about SARS prevail.  The PM 
will also stay Monday night at a Toronto hotel. 
 
------------ 
SARS Figures 
------------ 
 
7. As of 13:00 Eastern Daylight Saving Time, April 24, 
2003 Health Canada has received reports of 327 probable 
or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) in Canada (A net increase Canada-wide of 1 case 
since our Report #6).  There have been 16 deaths 
attributed to SARS linked to the Toronto nexus.  To 
date, transmission has been limited to specific 
transmission settings such as households, hospitals and 
specific community settings. The details of the cases 
to date are as follows: 
 
-- Ontario is reporting 136 probable and 121 suspect 
cases.  This is a decrease of 1 suspect case since 
Report #6.  (See Toronto reporting for greater detail.) 
 
-- British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 54 
suspect cases. This is an increase of 7 suspect cases 
since Report #6.  See paragraph 4. 
 
-- New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases. (No 
change.) 
 
-- Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case. (No 
change.) 
 
-- Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases. (No change) 
-- Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases. 
(No change.) 
 
8. The new suspect cases in British Columbia (BC) were 
passengers on the flight from New Delhi via Taipei that 
arrived in Vancouver on April 19.  In an April 24 press 
release Dr. Monika Naus of the BC Centre for Disease 
Control noted that  \"There are many causes for fever 
and cough in a returning traveler, India is not 
considered a SARS-affected area by the World Health 
Organization and there was only a brief stopover in 
Taipei. The risk may be low that these individuals have 
SARS, but we don\'t want to take any chances. If there 
are other passengers who were on this flight who are 
ill, we want to know about it.\" 
 
9. In the press release Naus states \"We have been 
notified of 10 people in eight different families who 
have reported these symptoms.  Two have been 
hospitalized (Ref A) but none have required ICU care or 
assistance to breathe.\"  \"We are asking that any other 
passengers with flu-like illness who were on these 
flights call ahead and notify their personal doctor. 
Their doctor should then notify public health.\" 
 
10.  The BC Centre for Disease Control will be directly 
contacting residents of B.C. who were on the China Air 
flight.  Passengers who may have gone on to other 
provinces will be notified by that province.

two-year, C$250 million pledge in Brussels, C$23.5 million 
has been committed to the ARTF for this year\'s operational 
expenses, with another allocation planned for next year. 
That timing is now being reconsidered. Canada plans to focus 
its development assistance on livelihoods; natural resources 
(including agriculture); and security/rule of law.  Between 
now and early June the GOC is consulting with the Afghan 
government and other donors to determine the major outline of 
its allocations of development and operational assistance, 
and the extent to which development funds can be redirected 
to the ARTF.

1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns about the April 29 
\"European Defense Summit\" (ref. A), and is pleased that we 
are making U.S. views clear to Europe.  Lisa Helfand, Foreign 
Affairs Deputy Director for Defense and Security Relations, 
said the GoC considers the Summit very unhelpful both for the 
NATO Alliance and for ESDP goals.  She noted that Belgian 
Political Director Carbonez had offered to come to Ottawa to 
brief the GoC on the Summit, but Canada turned off the visit. 
 
2. (C) Helfand also gave us further details on the aborted 
Canadian effort to deploy a staff officer to the EU\'s 
Operation Concordia in Macedonia (refs. B and C).  Like 
Poland, Canada was completely surprised that they would be 
charged for participation.  Canada had planned to contribute 
one staff officer (lieutenant colonel), but the day before he 
was to deploy the EU presented Canada with a bill for 240,000 
Euros.  The EU informed Canada that since 25% of the 
personnnel for Concordia were from non-EU countries, those 
countries would have to pay 25% of the operating costs. 
Individual country contributions were pro-rated on the basis 
of GDP. 
 
3. (C) Helfand said that Canadian Foreign Minister Graham 
raised this issue with EU Foreign Minister Solana, but that 
the EU was unable/unwilling to backtrack from this policy. 
Helfand said this could have implications in Bosnia if and 
when the EU takes over from SFOR, where Canada currently has 
1270 personnel.  The UK and the Netherlands would like the 
Canadian Forces to stay in Bosnia, she said, but Canada will 
not be interested if it is charged to participate while being 
excluded from mission oversight.

SUBJECT: MANITOBA BUDGET \"STEADY AS SHE GOES\" AGAIN 
 
1.  Summary:  On the eve of a provincial election this spring, 
Manitoba\'s left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) government 
delivered a cautious budget on April 22, laying out its fiscal 
plan for the upcoming year.  As in previous NDP budgets, this 
years\' rendition features very modest tax-cuts for middle-income 
earners and devotes more money to health care.  Based on an 
anticipated real growth rate of 3.2 percent, Finance Minister 
Greg Selinger projects the NDP\'s fourth consecutive balanced 
budget since taking power in 1999.  Successive Manitoba 
Governments have brought down balanced budgets each year since 
1995. 
 
2.  The NDP continued the tradition they began in last year\'s 
budget of raiding the revenues of the publicly owned electric 
utility, Manitoba Hydro, for C$52 million to help balance the 
books.  In total, the GOM will collect approximately C$365 
million in fees, \"dividends\" and assorted charges from Manitoba 
Hydro in 2003-4.  A C$48 million draw on the province\'s fiscal 
stabilization fund will leave only C$145 million in the fund, 
compared to C$264 million when the NDP took power in 1999.  The 
province expects to spend C$7.256 billion in 2003-4 (an increase 
of 4.7 percent over the previous year), with revenues increasing 
by 5.4 percent.   End summary. 
 
 
Manitoba Tax Rates Uncompetitive 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  Manitoba\'s meager - and largely symbolic - tax reductions, 
while welcome, have not kept pace with the more rapid reductions 
in most Canadian jurisdictions, feeding fears in the Manitoba 
business community that Manitoba is no longer competitive with 
other Canadian provinces, much less bordering states.  Even after 
the cuts, Manitoba\'s personal and business tax levels remain 
among the highest in Canada.  For example, Manitoba\'s personal 
income tax rates at all levels of income are higher than the 
rates paid by residents of six of Canada\'s ten provinces, 
including Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia.  At the same 
time, Manitoba\'s general corporate income tax rate is the second 
highest in the country.  Provincial comparisons aside, when 
Manitobans expressed concerns that their tax rates put them at a 
competitive disadvantage with their U.S. counterparts, the 
Provincial Finance Minister responded that Manitoba retains a 
cost of living advantage over U.S. jurisdictions because higher 
payroll taxes and healthcare costs are not included in the U.S. 
figures.  Manitoba also boasts relatively lower prices for 
electricity than neighboring provinces and states. 
 
A Little Here, a Little There. 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  In a budget devoid of major initiatives or incentives, 
funding Manitoba\'s publicly-funded healthcare system clearly 
remains a priority for the NDP.  Funding in 2003-4 will increase 
by 5.7 percent to just over C$3 billion, or 41 percent of the 
province\'s total budget.  Most of the new money for health care 
is coming from the federal government. 
 
5.  Manitoba businesses will be offered a new tax credit to 
invest in equipment or technology that reduces their own energy 
consumption.  The measure, which the GOM predicts will cost C$1 
million, is meant to leave more hydroelectricity on the grid for 
export, mostly to U.S. customers.  The GOM offered no estimate of 
the amount of energy that will be saved by the measure.  As 
previously announced, the corporate tax will fall by a further 
0.5 percent in 2004 to 15.5 percent. 
 
6.   Other spending decisions announced in the budget include a 
C$20/per month increase in welfare rates for single recipients 
and people with disabilities, as well as C$1 million to find new 
markets and products to shore up the beleaguered Port of 
Churchill. 
 
Local Reaction:  Underwhelmed 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  Business and taxpayers groups have roundly condemned the GOM 
for failing to provide any meaningful tax relief, and for the 
NDP\'s failure to keep Manitoba competitive with neighboring 
jurisdictions.  The President of the Winnipeg Chamber, Robert 
Kreis, said \"It is a very good day for our competitor provinces 
and our competitor businesses outside the province.\"  Jim Carr, 
president of the Business Council of Manitoba called it 
\".typically cautious without much risk taking, and there isn\'t 
much dare-devilling going on.  It tries to straddle the middle, 
where most of the voters are.  We would have liked to have seen 
more aggressive cuts to personal taxation.\" 
 
8.  The NDP\'s traditional allies on the left were slightly more 
restrained in their criticism of the budget, with Sid Frankel of 
the Social Council of Winnipeg applauding the move to inject $6 
million into child care, but said the NDP is going to have to tax 
upper-income earners more if it plans to keep funding social 
programs, adding \"Government has really put itself in a situation 
where it\'s not taxing those who are really benefiting from the 
economy.\"  Gaile Whelan Enns, Manitoba director of the Canadian 
Nature Federation\'s Wildland Campaign, praised the NDP\'s new tax 
credit for businesses to reduce energy consumption, but panned 
the government for only funding the creation of one new 
provincial park while 138 areas in Manitoba need protection. 
 
9.  Reaction in Winnipeg\'s major newspapers has also been 
unfavorable. The centrist Winnipeg Free Press said that \"if the 
middle class can be bought off with an average tax cut 20 months 
down the road of $155, what does that say about Manitoba?\"  It 
further lamented \"that there does not seem to be an effective 
opposition with a vision more compelling to voters than the 
promise of a pitiful $155 saving on taxes eventually.\"  The right 
of center Winnipeg Sun described the budget as having \"far too 
many empty carbohydrates and not enough energizing protein.\" 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
10.  This year\'s budget is consistent with the NDP\'s established 
practice in the last four budgets of being cautious to a fault, 
increasing funding to health care, and offering small, targeted 
measures on a multitude of issues, and continuing with the most 
modest tax cuts of any province in Canada.  They have outlined 
the fiscal path they will use in the upcoming election campaign, 
and will be quite content to campaign on a balanced budget, a 
strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in Canada at 5.2 
percent.  The opposition parties - especially the Progressive 
Conservatives - will likely focus their attacks during the 
campaign on Manitoba\'s uncompetitive tax environment and how it 
is preventing investment and growth as well as hastening the loss 
of the province\'s best and brightest to greener pastures 
elsewhere.

Begin text of GOC response: 
 
--  Thank you for your visit of April 22, 2003 and for 
consulting with us on your anticipated next steps with 
respect to combatting terrorism financing. 
 
--  As you are aware, all of the individuals and entities,

authorities. In fact, law enforcement investigations are 
ongoing. 
 
--  Canada continues to weigh the merits of designating 
Canadians and entities based in Canada, as terrorist, under 
our legislation, against the effects that such designation 
would have on ongoing criminal investigations. 
 
--  At this time, we believe that a designation of the

law enforcement actions in Canada. 
 
--  We will continue to share information with you through

individuals removed from the G-7 listing process in April, 
2002, do not fall through the cracks.  The GOC is under the 
impression that confirmation that they object to the 
designation due to ongoing investigations is sufficient to 
prevent USG designation of the proposed targets. 
 
4.  (S)  Action request:  Please let us know if this is not 
the case.  If Washington intends to proceed with the 
designation, we will so advise the GOC.

Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission Stephen R. Kelly, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Canadian Prime Minister Chretien issued an Iraqi 
reconstruction press release on April 29, announcing that 
Canada is ready to make available elements of its Disaster 
Assistance Response Team (DART); Canadian transport aircraft 
to support humanitarian assistance efforts and reconstruction 
material movement; and police, corrections and legal 
assistance.  The transport aircraft would be drawn from three 
CC130 Hercules aircraft already deployed in theater as part 
of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Chretien also discussed these 
offers during a press conference following a Cabinet meeting 
later in the day.  Alex Himelfarb, Clerk of the Privy 
Council, told DCM that Chretien decided over the weekend not 
to wait for the April 29 Cabinet meeting to respond to our 
requests, and that his decision was unequivocal. 
 
2. (C) Just prior to the press release, Jill Sinclair, 
Foreign Affairs Director General for International Security, 
informed DCM of the Canadian decision on military assistance, 
and presented him with a paper on \"Canadian Support for 
Reconstruction in Iraq\" (faxed to WHA/CAN).  In addition to 
the military and police contributions, the paper notes that 
the GoC is considering contributions to the rehabilitation of 
health, water and sanitation systems of Iraq, and increasing 
its US$3.5 million contribution to the UN Mine Action Service 
for Iraq. 
 
3. (C) The GoC paper welcomes the \"early efforts on the part 
of the occupying powers to work with Iraqis to establish an 
interim authority,\" and calls for the international community 
to play in important role.  On the UN, the paper notes 
Canada\'s support for UNSC resolutions which would facilitate 
the flow of donor assistance, provide legitimacy to an Iraqi 
interim authority, and provide a multilateral framework for 
\"ongoing reconstruction assistance.\"  Sinclair reiterated, 
however, that Canada will take a pragmatic approach to 
reconstruction assistance. 
 
4. (C) Sinclair said that while the GoC has already taken the 
decision on its military offer for post-conflict Iraq, the 
Cabinet still needs to make a final decision on the levels 
and sources of funding for civil assistance.  She expected 
final decisions to be taken at the May 6 Cabinet meeting. 
Sinclair reiterated strong GoC interest in participating in 
the \"justice sector\" assessment team visit to Iraq beginning 
May 8.  She noted that the Canadian Government requires a 
site visit before deployment of Canadian police teams abroad, 
and that it would greatly expedite getting Canadian police on 
the ground if Canada could be there with the U.S. and other 
national representatives.  Canada would propose to send two 
RCMP officers for the assessment visit, one with a 
corrections background and the other with a justice 
background. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: The PMO\'s message was more positive and 
straightforward than the message we received from Foreign 
Affairs, and more in line with what we had been expecting. 
Canada is offering the types of support we had expected for 
post-conflict Iraq, plus a bit more with the DART engineers. 
Canada will now want to hear from us, as soon as possible, on 
how to best incorporate these offers with what we and other 
coalition partners are doing.  In the first instance, we 
strongly encourage a positive response to the Canadian 
request to be included on the police assessment team visit to 
Iraq.

TAGS: SNAR, PREL, PGOV, CA, Narcotics 
SUBJECT: CANADA:  PRIME MINISTER SUGGESTS HE MIGHT MOVE 
FORWARD WITH MARIJUANA DECRIMINALIZATION LEGISLATION 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora. Reason 1.5D. 
 
1. (U) During an address at a Liberal Party fund raiser in 
Toronto on April 29, Prime Minster Jean Chretien stated that 
his government plans to introduce legislation that would 
decriminalize the possession of \"small amounts\" of marijuana. 
Chretien stated that the proposed bill would eliminate 
criminal penalties for simple possession by individuals but 
would be accompanied by tougher criminal provisions against 
those who grow and traffic marijuana.  According to press 
coverage, the bill which has not yet been submitted to 
Canada\'s Cabinet, might be passed to Parliament as early as 
June. 
 
2.  (C) The Prime Minster\'s statement followed comments made 
by Minister of Justice Martin Cauchon to the Ambassador 
earlier in the month that the long expected marijuana 
decriminalization law would in actuality strengthen the 
government\'s ability to inhibit the growth, processing, 
trafficking and use of marijuana in Canada.  According to 
Cauchon, the new law would allow for stiffer criminal 
penalties for the growing and trafficking of marijuana, and 
enable national and local law enforcement resources to 
concentrate their efforts to detect, arrest and prosecute 
growers and smugglers/traffickers.  Cauchon also stated that 
the new law would decongest local and provincial courts now 
\"overcrowded\" with minor possession cases.  He also said that 
marijuana usage would be discouraged through enforced 
\"ticketing\" and fining of users. 
 
3.  (U) Though Canadian officials are holding the long 
referred to decriminalization legislation close to the chest, 
it is believed that it reflects the findings and 
recommendations set forth in a report of the Senate Special 
Committee on Illegal Drugs issued in September 2002.  Though 
this committee\'s report had no legislative standing, it did 
state that (quote) when used in moderation, cannabis in 
itself poses very little danger to users and to society as a 
whole.... (and that) even if cannabis were to have serious 
harmful effects, one would have to question the relevance of 
using the criminal law to limit these effects. (unquote)  It 
recommended the creation of a position of a National Advisor 
on Psychoactive Substances and Dependency within the Prime 
Minster\'s  Privy Council and that more be done to coordinate 
drug control and abuse policies and programs among local, 
provincial and national authorities. 
 
4.  (SBU) The Prime Minster\'s fund raiser comments may have 
been premature, poorly managed, or both.  On May 6, Canada\'s 
Supreme Court will begin hearing appeals made against three 
provincial court decisions  declaring Canada\'s current 
marijuana possession law unconstitutional.  According to one 
knowledgeable University of Ottawa law professor and 
political consultant who favors the decriminalization of 
marijuana, should Canada\'s Supreme Court Justices strike down 
Canada\'s current marijuana law, there would be little need 
for the Chretien government to introduce, what would then be 
more restrictive, decriminalization legislation.  Instead, by 
just holding tight for the moment, the Government could avoid 
a political fight and instead concentrate on other 
counternarcotics issues such as strengthening penalties for 
growers and traffickers. 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  Chretien and his government are no doubt 
searching for  ways to manage the expected criticism that 
would follow the proposed decriminalization of marijuana. 
Post has made it clear that Washington is watching the 
decriminalization debate with concern and that should Canada 
weaken its stand against drugs -- even if that weakening is 
only a perception -- cross border flow of people and goods 
from Canada would likely come under increased scrutiny. 
Whether Chretien\'s April 29 comments were calculated or a 
slip of the tongue, we are using every opportunity to 
emphasize to our Canadian friends that any action that 
lessens Canada\'s counternarcotics efforts will be viewed with 
utmost concern.

allocations, and that Canada will continue to work through 
U.N. agencies and other international organizations in 
providing assistance. With respect to reconstruction, 
Marchand mentioned  Canada has a particular interest in 
helping with water projects in Iraq, and hopes to work on 
such projects in partnership with an international

Afghanistan High-Level Strategic Forum in Brussels. 
 
In reference to Finance Minister Ghani\'s request for 
predictability of funding, Canada responded by pledging 
financial support for the operating and development budgets 
beyond this solar year.  As you know, Canada pledged CDN $250 
million in new aid to Afghanistan for the next two years.  We 
have also heeded the Afghanistan Transitional Authoritiy\'s 
request that funding be directed to their priorities.  This 
is a fundamental principle of CIDA\'s Interim Assistance Plan 
for Afghanistan as approved by the Minister for International 
Cooperation, the Honourable Susan Whelan. 
 
In this respect, our program will support three areas from 
the National Development Framework (NDF) and Budget:  rural 
livelihoods and social protection; natural resources 
management, with an emphasis on agreculture; and security and 
the rule of law, and we will continue to make significant 
contributions to the operating budget.  We informed Afghan 
representatives in Brussels that CDN $23.5 million would be 
provided for the operating budget for the current year 
through the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). 
That contribution has already been forwarded to the ARTF. 
 
CIDA is continuing its dialogue with the Afghan Aid 
Coordination Authority and with line ministries to determine 
specific areas for program and project support within the 
three NDF programs.  We will consider an additional 
contribution to this year\'s operating budget as part of the 
deliberations with our Minister, and these deliberations will 
also take into account the unallocated portion of our pledge. 
 
In closing I would like to highlight the excellent 
communication between our CIDA officials and your 
representatives in the United States Embassy here in Ottawa. 
I look forward to the continuation of our close cooperation 
in assisting in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. 
 
Yours Sincerely, 
 
Hau Sing Tse

SUBJECT: NEW U.S.- CANADA AVIATION PRECLEARANCE AGREEMENT 
 
REF: OTTAWA 965 
 
1.  The United States and Canada exchanged diplomatic notes 
May 2, bringing into effect the Aviation Preclearance 
Agreement that had been signed in 2001.  Ambassador Cellucci 
exchanged notes with Foreign Minister Graham in a ceremony in 
Canada\'s Parliament building.  Transportation Minister 
Collenette also participated. 
 
2. The Ministers and the Ambassador made brief remarks. 
Graham praised the Ambassador for his work to overcome 
obstacles and bring the agreement into force.  He also noted 
that the agreement took account of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and that it would allow for expansion of preclearance 
services to other airports.  Collenette described the 
advantages of in-transit preclearance, although he did not 
actually use that term.   Ambassador Cellucci said that the 
agreement helped to improve security for U.S. preclearance 
personnel, and stressed that preclearance is a great 
convenience that promotes tourism, business, and family ties 
among Americans and Canadians. 
 
3. There was a substantial press contingent at the event. 
The questions for the Ambassador and the Ministers, however, 
focused on upcoming Canadian government decisions about the 
decriminalization of marijuana and about participation in a 
missile defense program. 
 
4. Comment: In recent conversations, Canadian officials have 
emphasized that the major advantage to Canada from the new 
agreement is the prospect of in-transit preclearance in 
several Canadian airports.  However,  these officials have 
said they are not aware of any plans by an airport to request 
in-transit preclearance in the near term.

SEE ACTION REQUEST PARA 2. 
 
1. (SBU) In response to reftel requests, the Canadian 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) 
provided us the following response on April 29: 
 
\"The issue of apprehending and dealing appropriately with 
persons who have allegedly committed crimes against humanity 
or war crimes requires international cooperation and 
multilateral approaches. 
 
The policy of the Canadian Government is unequivocal.  Canada 
is not and will not become a safe haven for foreign nationals 
who have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or 
other reprehensible acts regardless of when or where they 
were committed.  One of the purposes of the Canada\'s Crimes 
Against Humanity and War Crimes Program is to ensure that 
Canada complies with its international obligations.  This 
includes the investigation, prosecution and extradition or 
surrender of alleged war criminals, as well as cooperation 
with international tribunals.  Extradition to a foreign 
government or surrender to an international tribunal may 
occur upon request in accordance with Canadian law. 
 
Also, the provisions contained in Canada\'s Crimes Against 
Humanity and War Crimes Act govern criminal prosecutions in 
Canada.  The Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act 
provides for the prosecution of individuals present in Canada 
for any offense stated in the Act regardless of where the 
offense occurred.  For crimes committed outside Canada, the 
Act may be applied retroactively. 
 
In terms of administrative remedies, the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act provides grounds of inadmissibility to 
Canada for persons alleged to have committed war crimes and 
crimes against humanity.  The Act renders inadmissible senior 
officials of regimes which have been designated by the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration as being involved in 
terrorism, systematic or gross human rights violations or 
crimes against humanity.  The governments of Iraq under Ahmed 
Hassan Al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein have been so designated. 
The individuals named in your demarche would appear to be 
subject to the provisions of this designation.  Individuals 
who pose a danger to the public of Canada will be detained 
under the Immigration Act. 
 
The Department of Citizenship and Immigration (CIC) liaises 
closely with our international partners and is currently 
aware of over 300 Iraqi officials who are inadmissible to 
Canada.  Overseas missions, ports of entries and offices in 
Canada are on the alert for officials form the listed Iraqi 
regimes.  Furthermore, information-sharing agreements between 
Canada and the US allow for the exchange of information with 
the Department of Homeland Security and the Consular Affairs 
Branch at the US State Department.\" 
 
2. (S) ACTION REQUEST: DFAIT officials subsequently informed 
us that all of the Iraqi officials listed in reftel B are 
inadmissable to Canada.  They asked if this list can be 
declassified so that CIC headquarters can it with their 
immigration officials worldwide.  Please advise.

SUBJECT: MIDDLE EAST: CANADA WELCOMES ROADMAP, RECOMMENDS 
SIDELINING BUT NOT HUMILIATING ARAFAT 
 
REF: STATE 111481 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) Canadian Foreign Minister Graham issued a statement 
praising the release of the Quartet\'s Roadmap, and saying it 
bolsters the prospects for peace in the Middle East.  Graham 
said the Roadmap and the confirmation of Abu Mazen as 
Palestinian Prime Minister were the \"first positive things we 
have seen in a long time\" in the peace process, and called on 
all parties to take the steps needed for the Roadmap\'s 
implementation. 
 
2. (C) We discussed the Roadmap and reftel points with Don 
Sinclair, Foreign Affairs Director General for Middle East 
and North Africa, who commended the U.S.\'s willingness to 
take this on.  While Sinclair agreed with our points on the 
need to bolster Abu Mazen\'s position, he strongly disagreed 
with the tactic of shunning Arafat.  Sinclair and his Foreign 
Affairs colleagues argued that despite Arafat\'s 
obstructionism and incompetence, he remains a major symbol of 
nationalism for Palestinians.  If we deal exclusively with 
Abu Mazen and humiliate Arafat, Sinclair continued, it would 
put Abu Mazen in an untenable position, as he would be seen 
by Palestinians as beholden to Israel and the U.S.  Jonathan 
Laine, Foreign Affairs Senior Advisor for the MEPP, recalled 
how Palestinians had rallied around Arafat during the IDF 
siege of his Ramallah headquarters in 2002. 
 
3. (C) Jill Stirk, Foreign Affairs Director for the Middle 
East, emphasized the need for quick results after the release 
of the Roadmap.  The window of opportunity would only be open 
briefly, and there were many on both sides ready to derail 
the process.  While incidents on both sides are inevitable, 
she said, we need to show progress in order to instill 
confidence.  Sinclair said that the Palestinians needed to 
take the first step by ending terrorist attacks, but that 
Israel must immediately \"reward\" this effort.  The key issue, 
Sinclair continued, will be eliminating Israeli settlements, 
which will allow a return to the 1967 borders (with some 
modifications as agreed by the parties). 
 
4. (C) Sinclair told us that Canada is ready to help in any 
way it can, but would wait for U.S. suggestions and guidance 
on what role it should play.  He noted that Canada has a 
reputation in the region for evenhandedness, and that it has 
done considerable work on the refugee issue.  Looking ahead, 
Sinclair said that Canada has already offered to contribute 
military personnel if there is agreement on a third party 
presence.  Despite Israeli resistance, Canada wants to 
explore the third party option as a less destructive, more 
humane alternative to the fence currently being put in place. 
 
5. (C) Sinclair said that including Egypt and Jordan in our 
Palestinian security force training plans was brilliant.  He 
did not expect our Quartet partners, which are distrusted by 
the Israelis, to add much value to the process.  The 
leadership onus, Sinclair emphasized, will be on the U.S. 
The parties themselves, if left alone, were incapable of 
following through.  If the Roadmap is to work, Sinclair 
concluded, the U.S. must take charge.

Summary 
------- 
 
2.   (SBU) The tiger\'s roar is beginning to weaken.  In 
spite of a strong energy sector, respectable domestic 
demand and sound provincial finances, forecasters, 
including the Bank of Canada, have downgraded their 
growth outlook for the Canadian economy in 2003 from 
nearly 4% just a few months ago, to 2.5- 3%.  February\'s 
GDP data, showing annualized GDP growth of only 2.4% 
compared to a 6% annualized rate just a month earlier, 
lends support to these downward revisions. Short-term 
concerns include continued global economic uncertainties, 
especially a delay in the U.S. economic recovery, a 
stronger than anticipated Canadian currency, and the 
impact of SARS in Toronto, capitol of Canada\'s largest 
province and source of 20% of national GDP. 
 
3. (SBU) There are some glimmering bright spots, most 
notably Canada\'s energy sector and the relatively strong 
fiscal position of Canada\'s ten provinces.  In fact, all 
but Prince Edward Island and British Columbia project 
balanced books or better, although once the full impact 
of SARS emerges, Ontario\'s estimated C$524/US$367 million 
surplus could erode into a deficit.  The recent sharp 
rebound in U.S. consumer confidence bodes well for Canada 
next year, and the Conference Board of Canada projects 
that the quick victory in Iraq will trigger an economic 
recovery in the United States beginning in the third 
quarter of 2003.  A U.S. economic rebound will be 
necessary to keep the Canadian tiger roaring.  Our 
January forecast called for Canadian economic growth of 
3.5% this year, increasing to 4.3% in 2004.  We are 
modifying our forecast to around 3% this year and just 
under 4% in 2004.  End Summary. 
 
Northern Tiger Getting Tamed 
---------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The Canadian economy is still chugging along, but 
less energetically than just a few months ago.  In 
February, real GDP rose a modest 0.2% from January, an 
annualized rate of 2.4%, representing a sharp moderation 
from the 6% annualized rate recorded just a month 
earlier.  In addition, February\'s gain was narrowly 
based, with the continuing boom in housing construction 
and its spinoffs to industries such as concrete and wood 
products one of the few consistent sources of strength. 
Consumer spending continues to advance based on a rebound 
in auto sales, but weakness in manufacturing was evident 
in two-thirds of the major industry groups. 
 
The Only Thing Certain Is Uncertainty 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Looking ahead, several analysts are projecting 
extended weakness in Canada\'s export sector (about 38% of 
GDP) because of the sluggish global economy, a delay in 
the U.S. recovery, and stronger than expected 
appreciation of Canada\'s dollar.  Canada\'s record 
employment growth of last year has begun to ease and the 
SARS outbreak in Toronto has already had an impact on the 
capitol of Canada\'s largest province and source of over 
20% of Canada\'s economic output -- ref C.  (Note:  The 
Conference Board of Canada estimates the loss from SARS 
at C$1 billion in 2003, or about half a percent of real 
GDP growth in a C$2 billion economy.  End note.) 
Consequently, several economists have downgraded their 
forecasts of the Canadian economy for 2003 from nearly 4% 
just a few months ago, to 2.5-3%. 
6.   (U) The Bank of Canada\'s April 23 Semi-annual 
Monetary Policy Report highlights the still-uncertain 
global environment, a delay in the U.S. economic 
recovery, and the SARS outbreak in Toronto, as factors 
tempering upward pressure on interest rates in the short- 
term.  (The BOC raised rates by 25 basis points on March 
4 and April 15 of this year.)  The BOC says that while 
rising interest rates and appreciation of the Canadian 
dollar (up 8% since October 2002) have tightened monetary 
conditions in the past year, the BOC continues to believe 
that further reduction in monetary stimulus will be 
necessary to return Canada\'s inflation rate (4.3% in 
March; down from 4.6% in February) to the 2% target and 
to sustain ouput levels close to capacity. 
 
Provincial Finances for FY2002-03: Lookin\' Good (Sort Of) 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
7. (SBU) The tally of provincial budgets shows an 
aggregate deficit of C$1.3/US$0.9 billion. (Due primarily 
to a C$3.8/US$2.7 billion deficit projection for British 
Columbia.)  The only other province projecting a deficit 
is Prince Edward Island, but it is a marginal C$8/US$6 
million.  Energy-rich Alberta turns in the best fiscal 
performance projecting a C$1.8/US$1.3 billion surplus. 
In fact, Canada\'s cash-rich oilpatch faces a spending 
dilemma as record quarterly profits of Alberta\'s oil 
companies pour into the province.  The consensus is that 
most firms will increase capital spending, look for 
merger opportunities, and pay down debt.  In Ontario, the 
possible C$1 billion cost of responding to SARS could 
erode the C$524/US$367 million surplus projection into a 
deficit.  Although the virus is now contained (Toronto 
1259), the economic hit in the city that contributes 20% 
to Canada\'s national GDP is already clear.  As of April 
25, there had been reports of a 50% drop in Toronto hotel 
occupancy rates, and a 70 to 80% loss of business for 
Chinatown restaurants and shops, and an average 
contraction of 30% in downtown retail sales (Toronto 
1226).  Quebec, the second-largest provincial economy, 
also projects a balanced budget but recent rumors of 
financial irregularities may cast a shadow there as well. 
The remaining provinces project small budget surpluses. 
 
ALL SIGNS POINT TO RECOVERY IN 2004 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Glimmers of hope on the horizon that should 
boost Canadian economic output late this year and in 2004 
include Canada\'s energy sector and the relatively strong 
fiscal positions of the federal and provincial 
governments.  The recent sharp rebound in U.S. consumer 
confidence bodes well for Canadian exports and 
manufacturing in the mid-term.  The Conference Board 
predicts that the quick victory in Iraq will trigger 
economic recovery in the United States beginning in the 
second half of 2003, fueling a solid export recovery in 
Canada in 2004.  Consequently, the Board forecasts 
Canadian economic growth of 2.7% this year and 3.3% in 
2004. The Bank of Montreal shares the Conference Board\'s 
assumptions, and forecasts 2.4% growth in 2003, rising to 
3.9% in 2004.  Our January forecast predicted growth of 
3.5% this year, increasing to 4.3% in 2004.  Given the 
change in circumstances, we will scale back our forecast 
to around 3% for this year and to just under 4% in 2004.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN CABINET DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
REF: (A) OTTAWA 1123 (B) OTTAWA 492 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) The Canadian Cabinet discussed missile defense 
cooperation with the U.S. in its May 6 meeting, but reached 
no conclusion and will continue discussions on May 13. 
Foreign Minister Graham and Defense Minister McCallum briefed 
Cabinet and encouraged a decision to engage in missile 
defense negotations with the U.S.  Deputy Prime Minister 
Manley told the Ambassador after the meeting that a consensus 
seems to be forming in favor of missile defense negotiations, 
and that some Cabinet officials whom he expected to be 
opposed were grudgingly supportive.  He also noted that 
Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, who is publicly opposed to 
Canadian participation in missile defense, did not attend the 
meeting. 
 
2. (C) Foreign Affairs sources told us that the lack of a 
Cabinet decision did not indicate a change in course.  Given 
\"differing views\" and other topics on the Cabinet agenda, 
there simply was not enough time to hear from all Cabinet 
members who wanted to speak on missile defense.  They 
cautioned that there will be intense debate in the days 
ahead, including at the Liberal MPs\' weekly caucus meeting on 
May 7.  But they expected Cabinet to approve a negotiating 
mandate on May 13, and said that senior Canadian officials 
(probably Foreign Affairs Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) Jim 
Wright and Defense ADM Ken Calder) would want to visit 
Washington in the following days for preliminary discussions. 
 
 
3. (C) Up until now, the GoC has carefully avoided taking a 
position on missile defense.  Chretien made his first 
positive public comments on May 5, telling Commons that 
\"there has been an evolution in this file\" with Russia and 
China toning down their opposition, and saying that the GoC 
is reconsidering the program.  A few Liberal and opposition 
MPs immediately responded, criticizing missile defense as 
leading to a new arms race.  The chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee recalled that the Committee had recommended 
against participation as recently as December. 
 
4. (C) Missile defense has also become an issue in the race 
to succeed Chretien, which will be decided at the Liberal 
Party leadership convention in November.  Last week, 
leadership frontrunner Paul Martin announced his support for 
missile defense cooperation with the U.S., which prompted 
Heritage Minister Copps, another leadership candidate, to 
reiterate her opposition.  Deputy Prime Minister Manley, the 
third Liberal leadership contender, is known to support 
Canadian participation in missile defense but has not yet 
gone public. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: Graham and McCallum agreed in October that it 
made sense for Canada to participate in North American 
missile defense, but this proposed policy shift has been 
closely held until now (reftels).  Martin\'s endorsement 
lessens opposition within caucus, as most Liberal MPs want to 
stay onside with him.  There will be much criticism in coming 
days by opposition MPs and journalists, who charge that the 
Government\'s shift is an attempt to curry favor with the U.S. 
after the fallout over Iraq.  But with Chretien apparently on 
board, we expect to finally get a decision from Cabinet on 
May 13 to proceed with negotiations.

Ref. SECSTATE 106632 
 
1. Health Canada\'s response concerning reftel demarche 
was unequivocal: Canada will not support deletion of 
FCTC Article 30 at the upcoming World Health Assembly 
(WHA).  In Canada\'s view, the text of the Convention is 
now in its final form and it is too late in the process 
to revisit the text and remove the reservations clause. 
End summary. 
 
2.  Health Canada\'s Director General of International 
Affairs, Ed Aiston, delivered an unequivocal message to 
ESTH Counselor and ESTH Specialist on the question of 
Canadian support for our proposal to delete article 30 
of the FCTC.  The Canadian position is: The text of the 
Convention is now final; Canada will not support 
opening of the text and deletion of Article 30. 
 
3.  Aiston remarked that delegates at the WHA are 
generally not those officials who negotiated the FCTC. 
As a consequence, opening the text and managing the 
consequences in this different milieu, is of concern to 
Canada.  Aiston noted in particular that the text 
contains a number of fragile compromises that Canada 
would not want to have reexamined and possibly 
subjected to change at the WHA.  Aiston also pointed 
out that Canada has concerns that removal of the 
reservations clause could allow some countries to 
dilute the impact of the FCTC.  (Aiston made clear to 
us that he would not put the United States in that 
group.)  Finally, the draft final text has already been 
submitted to the relevant ministers for their review. 
 
4.  The prior delivery of the demarche to officials at 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade (DFAIT) yielded a polite audience.  They 
indicated that generally the GoC was flexible on the 
issue of reservations.  But they made it clear that 
Health Canada is where the decision resides on the 
FCTC.  Ross Snyder, Deputy Director of UN Specialized 
Agencies Division, and Shelley Whiting, Deputy Director 
of the United Nations, Human Rights and Economic Law 
Division, received our demarche, but noted that they 
believe that the current draft final text contains 
references to constitutional limits in Article 13 that 
address USG concerns about infringement of 
Constitutionally-guaranteed rights.  They also noted 
their worry that our effort to revisit Article 30 could 
embolden Germany to once again raise its concerns with 
the advertising proscriptions of the FCTC. 
 
5.  Comment: Although Aiston delivered an unwelcome 
message from the GoC, he prefaced it with remarks that 
one of Canada\'s objectives had been to see the United 
States sign and ratify the FCTC.  Canada, he noted, had 
worked hard in the negotiations as a good faith partner 
and had made compromises to achieve results amenable to 
American participation.  Indeed, Aiston added, Canada 
had made its best efforts during the negotiations phase 
to get rid of the reservations clause.  That effort 
was, however, unsuccessful and Canada considers it is 
now too late to revisit the issue.  End comment.

marijuana would continue to be illegal.  The bill will 
propose that when a person is caught in possession of a small 
amount of marijuana, the marijuana will be seized and the 
person ticketed and ordered to pay a fine.  Although a 2002 
report by the Canadian Senate  recommended the complete 
legalization of marijuana, Cormier emphasized that this is 
not the route the government will take. 
 
3. (C) Cormier said that a principal reason behind the 
decriminalization proposal is the very uneven enforcement of 
current marijuana sanctions. Persons caught with small 
amounts of marijuana in Canada\'s urban areas are usually not 
arrested or charged because of the heavy burden  prosecution 
of these cases would place on police and the court system. In 
Canada\'s smaller cities and rural areas, on the other hand, 
possession of small amounts of marijuana often results in 
arrest and prosecution.  Cormier noted that the issue of 
decriminalization has been under consideration by the 
government for a long time, and has been thoroughly studied 
by committees of both the House and Senate. He argued there 
is no evidence that more liberal possession laws lead to 
increased marijuana usage. Citing studies of marijuana use in 
the Netherlands, Cormier said the expectation is that 
decriminalization will eventually result in a decrease, not 
an increase, in marijuana consumption. 
 
5. (C) Cormier further noted that the decriminalization 
proposal will be part of a broad national drug strategy, 
which will address issues such as drug consumption, 
addiction, and treatment programs.  The national drug 
strategy will have two principal goals: first, to reduce drug 
consumption among young people; second, to redirect law 
enforcement resources away from personal possession cases and 
towards stopping drug traffickers.  The government is 
considering proposing stricter penalties on persons who 
cultivate and distribute marijuana as part of its national 
drug strategy, but Cormier did not give details. 
 
6. (C) It is not certain exactly when the bill will be 
introduced, but it could be as soon as two weeks from now, or 
perhaps not until June. Cormier described only in broad terms 
 what the bill would include and was vague on details. For 
example, he did not disclose what quantity of marijuana will 
be subject to the decreased sanctions. Cormier indicated that 
Justice Minister Cauchon plans to travel to Washington next 
week (possibly May 14) to outline the government\'s drug 
proposal for U.S. government officials, and asked our help in 
identifying appropriate offices and individuals for Cauchon 
to visit. (Note: Cauchon has reportedly already been in 
contact with Secretary Ashcroft about this visit.) 
 
7. (C) Cormier also touched briefly on the subject of 
precursor chemicals.  He stressed  the government of Canada 
\"wants to work together\" with the U.S. on this problem and 
said  Canadian law enforcement \"has been sharing everything\" 
with us.  Precursors are an agenda item for the next Cross 
Border Crime Forum, scheduled for May 21 in West Virginia. 
 
8. (C) Comment: The GOC clearly wants to begin managing the 
negative reaction to decriminalization it expects from the 
United States. Cormier emphasized that possession of even 
small amounts of marijuana will remain illegal in Canada. He 
cited polls showing that 70 percent of Canadians approve of 
at least partial decriminalization of marijuana and asserted 
the government\'s proposal will be \"less radical\" than the 
current marijuana laws in some U.S. states (he cited Ohio for 
an example).  The GOC intends to proceed with its 
decriminalization proposal in the very near future, but will 
try to minimize the impact of this action on our overall 
bilateral relationship. End comment.

CONCERNS WITH DPRK 
 
REF: STATE 114597 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Canada shares our strong concerns about North Korean 
statements on reprocessing spent fuel (reftel), and plans to 
convey those concerns directly to DPRK officials at the UN 
and in Beijing.  Political Director Jim Wright told Political 
Minister Counselor on May 7 that he will also suggest that 
Foreign Minister Graham make a public statement about 
Canadian concerns in connection with the G-8 Foreign 
Ministers meeting in Paris later this month.  The South 
Korean Ambassador had met with Wright earlier that day, and 
asked how the G-8 meetings in Paris and Evian would deal with 
North Korea.  In preparation for the G-8, Wright asked if we 
could provide him readouts on the Roh and Koizumi visits to 
Washington as well as reactions to our demarche in other 
capitals. 
 
2. (C) Wright said that Canada has exactly the same objective 
as the U.S. for North Korea - a complete, verifiable, and 
irreversible termination of the nuclear program.  He worried 
that the verification regime put in place in the 1990s, which 
was the best we could do at the time, hadn\'t been sufficient. 
 Wright asked if we have seen any physical evidence yet that 
reprocessing has started back up.  He had seen intelligence 
reports on activity around the Yongbyon facility, but 
wondered if there was more. 
 
3. (C) Wright also said that Canada would continue to push in 
multilateral fora to bring pressure to bear on the DPRK.  He 
noted that the Canadian delegation to the NPT PrepCom was 
encouraging other delegations to be more vocal on North 
Korea.  The Canadian team had been asked by the Hungarian 
Chair to draft a factual summary of proceedings, which they 
were doing.  He noted that this was not ideal, but was 
probably the best outcome possible as divergent views on 
North Korea precluded a meaningful declaration.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, SENV, ECON, CA, Manitoba 
SUBJECT: CANADA:  MANITOBANS GO TO THE POLLS JUNE 3 
 
This message is a product of APP Winnipeg. 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Riding high in the public opinion polls, 
Manitoba Premier Gary Doer (New Democratic Party -- NDP) 
ended weeks of speculation by calling a provincial election 
for June 3.  Re-election of the NDP government will keep 
alive Canadian opposition to U.S. proposals seeking to 
alleviate flooding of North Dakota,s Devils Lake via 
drainage into the Red River. End Summary. 
 
2. (U) Situated at the geographic center of Canada, Manitoba 
has strong connections to the large agricultural component 
and strong conservative/populist streak of its western 
neighbors and also possesses the established industrial and 
manufacturing sector and union movement found in eastern 
Canada.  Within the context of Canada,s more \"statist\" 
federal system, Manitobans seek leadership that will play an 
active role in developing the province,s economic potential 
and sustain strong social programs such as health care. 
 
3. (U) Politics at the provincial level have long been 
polarized, with the left-leaning NDP and the conservative 
Progressive Conservative Party (PC) overshadowing the 
Manitoba Liberal Party, which has not led a government since 
the 1950s.  The current government came to power in 
September, 1999, in a sweeping victory that ended the 11-year 
dominance of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
 
4. (U) NDP support tends to be strongest in northern Manitoba 
and north and central Winnipeg --  less affluent areas with a 
high rate of labor union membership.  The PC generally does 
well in agricultural southern Manitoba and Winnipeg,s 
southern and western suburbs, which have tended to greater 
economic prosperity.  Liberal Party support, though 
relatively evenly distributed throughout the province, seldom 
has been sufficiently \"concentrated\" to win large numbers of 
seats. 
 
5. (U) Party divisions within the 57-seat Manitoba 
legislature are relatively stable, with the NDP and PC 
holding about 20 \"safe\" seats apiece, and approximately 15 
competitive \"swing\" constituencies determining the winner in 
every election.  In the last contest, the NDP took nearly all 
of the swing seats, including six with a margin of victory of 
less than 500 votes.  At dissolution of the Legislature on 
May 2, the NDP held 32 seats, the PC 24, and the Liberals 1, 
a configuration borne out in the latest polls which show the 
NDP leading the PC 44% to 30%, with the Liberals trailing at 
21%.  With Canada,s first-past-the-post electoral system, 
the NDP lead likely will translate into an absolute majority 
in the provincial Legislature. 
 
Incumbent Advantages 
-------------------- 
 
6. (U) Gary Doer and his party hold a number of advantages 
that make them virtually unbeatable.  In contrast to their 
disorganized and under-funded opponents, the NDP started out 
\"debt-free\" and now boasts a healthy (by provincial 
standards) C$300,000 (US$213,000) campaign war chest. 
Moreover, the government is credited for Manitoba,s strong 
economy, the lowest provincial unemployment rate in Canada 
(5.2%), and a balanced budget.  Nonetheless, the NDP seems 
not to take anything for granted and has conducted an 
aggressive media information campaign. 
 
 
PC Quick Out of the Gate with Tax Platform 
------------------------------------------ 
 
7. (U) The PC, on the other hand, is starting from behind the 
curve.  In his first election since assuming leadership of 
the Progressive Conservatives in 2000, Stuart Murray launched 
his campaign with a pledge to eliminate education taxes from 
citizens, property tax bills and criticism of Gary Doer for 
failing to provide tax relief despite a booming economy and 
vastly increased tax revenues. (Manitobans pay some of the 
highest property and income taxes in Canada).  Nonetheless, 
Murray lacks voter recognition and PC fundraising efforts 
have been significantly hindered since the NDP banned union 
and corporate donations several years ago.  The party starts 
the campaign with a C$400,000 (US$284,000) debt, no money on 
hand, and opinion polls showing them 10 points lower than 
their disappointing finish in the 1999 election. 
 
Liberals to Launch \"Health Care Guarantee\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
8. (U) Liberal leader Jon Gerrard launched his quixotic 
campaign from a minivan disguised as an ambulance, to 
emphasize the Liberals\' main campaign plank -- \"a health care 
guarantee,\" the funding of alternative patient treatment in 
other provinces or even the U.S.  The platform is a challenge 
to the NDP,s 1999 pledge to end \"hallway medicine\" and 
reduce health care waiting lists.  Gerrard faces a struggle 
to hold the lone Liberal seat in the Legislature - which he 
won by less than 500 votes in 1999.  The Liberals start the 
campaign debt-free, and with C$100,000 (US$71,000) on hand. 
 
Comment 
------- 
9. (U) The NDP commands a resounding lead both in public 
opinion polls and campaign funding. The anticipated 
re-election of the NDP would not alter Manitoba\'s close and 
strong ties to neighboring U.S. states.  At the same time, 
however, it would strengthen Canadian efforts to quash 
alleviation of North Dakota,s Devils Lake flooding via 
diversion into the Red River or other similar means.  Doer 
has resolutely opposed U.S. proposals to allow Devils Lake 
water to drain into the Red River, and he likely will 
continue to oppose those and other proposals such as the 
\"Northwest Area Supply Project,\" and inter-basin water 
transfers. End Comment.

DFAIT reminded us that there is no public or private Canadian 
nuclear cooperation with Iran, and that the GoC will continue 
to ensure no future cooperation.  Iran\'s motivation in citing 
Cando, DFAIT continued, was to try to butress their claims 
that the Iranian nuclear program is purely civilian.  DFAIT 
noted that \"Nucleonics Week\" has already picked up this story 
from Iran\'s presentation.  The GoC is trying to beat the

Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) We conveyed points contained reftel on May 9 to Don 
Sinclair, Director General of DFAIT\'s Middle East and North 
Africa Bureau. Sinclair said Canada welcomed the news that 
the resolution to lift sanctions against Iraq had been 
introduced in the UN Security Council.  He indicated that 
Canada, though not a UNSC member, would support the effort. 
Sinclair said that Canadian officials would seek public 
opportunities to express their backing, but that DFAIT would 
probably not issue a separate press release. 
 
2. (C)  Sinclair said that now is the right time to begin the 
normalization process and described the U.S. approach to the 
wide range of issues surrounding Iraq as \"practical, 
flexible, and pragmatic.\"  He emphasized it is important to 
Canada that the UN play a meaningful role in the process. 
With respect to the steps proposed in the resolution, he 
commented that the \"devil is in the details.\"  If the current 
sanctions regime is lifted, Sinclair asked, would another set 
of sanctions or restrictions (on weapons procurement, for 
example) take its place, or would all sanctions against Iraq 
be ended? 
 
3. (C)  Sinclair raised several concerns/questions regarding 
the U.S. proposals.  What about Iraqi creditors, particularly 
Russia, China, and France, who would apparently be asked to 
agree to the freezing of debt repayment obligations?  He 
noted that the whole issue of letting the Iraqis determine 
their own future would be a major test.  Would the coalition 
partners accept unconditionally the final results of an Iraqi 
election?  He asked about the future role of UN weapons 
inspectors in Iraq; Canada felt it was important to 
reintroduce them into the mix. UNMOVIC had credibility with 
the international community and would lend greater trust to 
the final certification that Iraq was free of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
 
4. (C)  These were just his preliminary reactions, he 
emphasized, to what Canada saw as a positive step in getting 
the post conflict phase of Iraqi reconstruction under way. 
Canada looked forward to further elaboration of coalition 
plans and strategies.

(FCTC): Canadians Suggest We Reexamine Our Stance 
 
Ref. (A) OTTAWA 1304 
     (B) SECSTATE 106632 
 
1. This cable contains an action request, see paragraph 
11. 
 
2. As a follow-up to the official GoC response to our 
request for support on removing the Reservations Clause 
(Article 30) of the FCTC (Ref A), Canada\'s Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) has 
provided Embassy a detailed response to USG concerns 
raised in reftel B. 
 
3. The DFAIT document claims that the GoC has examined 
carefully USG concerns, and in particular the areas in 
which the USG had indicated it might take reservations 
(Ref B).  It offers the GoC assessment of three areas 
in particular: Advertising, Promotions and Sponsorship; 
Warning Labels and; Distribution of Free Samples. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Advertising, Promotion and Sponsorship 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. Our DFAIT interlocutors note that initially, this 
was an area that posed challenges for Canada as well, 
given their own constitutional requirements.  The GoC, 
the documents states, \"worked diligently to negotiate 
wording that allowed for a constitutional \"carve-out\". 
In our view the opening words in each of Articles 13.2, 
13.3 and 13.4 provide excellent scope for governments 
to take action that is consistent with their 
constitutions.\" 
 
5. The DFAIT document also points out \"the U.S. has 
previously ratified agreements with limitations on 
advertising containing a similar constitutional 
qualification.   A constitutional qualification (\"with 
due regard to its constitutional provisions\") was used 
in Article 10 of the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances, in the context of an obligation to prohibit 
advertising of psychotropic substances to the public. 
The UN commentary on this provision suggests that 
Article 10(2) was drafted in order to require States to 
prohibit the advertisement of these substances to the 
extent that they are allowed to do so by their 
Constitutions.  No reservations or declarations have 
been made regarding this clause, suggesting that the 
qualifier has been sufficient to address the concerns 
of States Parties (including the United States), which 
include constitutional protections of the right to 
freedom of expression.\" 
 
-------------- 
Warning Labels 
-------------- 
 
6. With respect to Warning Labels, the DFAIT document 
states: \"With respect to Article 11.1, we would note 
that the United States has ratified other treaties that 
have required legislative changes.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
Distribution of Free Samples 
---------------------------- 
 
7. The DFAIT document declares that: \"Article 16.2 is 
not mandatory, since it provides the flexibility to 
simply \"promote\" the prohibition of the distribution of 
free tobacco products to the public and minors.\" 
 
------------------- 
Canada\'s Conclusion 
------------------- 
 
8. The DFAIT document further states, \"Based on these 
considerations, our view is that the text of the 
Convention should have enough flexibility to meet the 
needs of the U.S. Government.\" 
 
9. The DFAIT document notes \".a number of governments 
negotiating in Geneva, particularly representing 
developing countries, were concerned that if 
reservations were permitted in the Convention, their 
governments would come under intense pressure from 
tobacco companies to enter a large number of 
reservations and undermine the treaty.  That is why 
many governments resisted so strongly provisions that 
would allow for reservations.  We expect that such 
concerns would remain, and that any effort to reopen 
the treaty text at the World Health Assembly could be 
quite divisive and problematic.\" 
 
10.  The DFAIT document concludes that the GoC \".would 
strongly encourage the U.S. government to re-examine 
the flexibility that exists in the current text and 
make the best use possible of this flexibility.  We 
(Canada) would encourage the U.S. government not to 
reopen the text at the World Health Assembly.\" 
 
11. Comment and Action request: The points contained in 
the DFAIT document follow closely similar arguments 
made by the Canadian Cancer Society in its recent 
letter to Ambassador Cellucci.  While we hold out 
little hope of changing the GoC\'s position prior to the 
World Health Assembly (WHA) next week, we would 
appreciate cleared points that we can use in responding 
to DFAIT and to press inquiries which we expect as news 
of our position on the FCTC begins to come out of 
Geneva.

1.(C) We raised the questions contained in reftel with 
Christopher Hull, Iraq political and trade relations officer 
in DFAIT\'s Middle East Division, on May 13. Hull indicated 
that Canada had regulations in place (known as the UN/Iraq 
regulations) to implement its obligations under UNSCR 661 and 
other Iraq UNSC resolutions. Hull said there are two options 
for undoing the regulations once the UNSC lifts the Iraq 
sanctions: the current regulations can either be modified, or 
the current regulations can be repealed altogether. He 
indicated that adoption of the sanctions-lift resolution 
would not be sufficient in itself to permit import and trade 
in Iraqi products; some action will have to be taken 
regarding Canada\'s UN/Iraq regulations. 
 
2. (C) As to the time required, Hull said that the repeal of 
the regulations could be accomplished fairly quickly. 
However, if the regulations are either modified or replaced 
with new regulations, this would take longer.  He noted that 
the process of repealing them would be initiated by DFAIT, go 
to the Privy Council for review, and then to the Governor 
General for formal approval.  Hull felt it would be difficult 
to begin the process before UNSC adoption of the 
sanctions-lift resolution, although he promised to  confer 
with DFAIT\'s legal division on this point.

THE GROWING CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS FROM 
CANADA TO THE U.S.  CANADIAN INTERNET PHARMACIES, SOME OF 
WHICH FILL MORE THAT 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY, HAVE BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DISPARATE U.S. AND 
CANADIAN MARKET PRICES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND LEGAL 
UNCERTAINTIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.  MANITOBA\'S 
STRONG PROMOTION OF THE INDUSTRY IS IN STARK CONTRAST 
WITH THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TAKEN BY OTHER PROVINCES, 
ESPECIALLY ONTARIO.  THE FUTURE OF THE INDUSTRY WILL 
DEPEND ON THE INTERNET PHARMACIES\' ABILITY TO RESPOND TO 
THE INCREASING PRESSURE ON THE SUPPLY OF PHARMACEUTICALS 
AND NAVIGATE THE MURKY LEGAL AND ETHICAL WATERS 
SURROUNDING THE TRADE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORTS - A BOON FOR MANITOBA-- 
 
2. MANITOBA HAS BECOME A MAJOR HUB IN A GROWING TRADE IN 
PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS FROM CANADA TO THE U.S., 
MUCH OF WHICH IS NOW ORDERED OVER THE INTERNET AND 
FULFILLED BY MAIL.  MANITOBA-BASED INTERNET PHARMACIES 
ACCOUNT FOR WELL OVER HALF OF THE ESTIMATED USD 500 
MILLION WORTH OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOLD TO THE U.S. FROM 
CANADA LAST YEAR.  THE MANITOBA PHARMACEUTICAL 
ASSOCIATION (MPA), WHICH REGULATES PHARMACIES IN THE 
PROVINCE, ESTIMATES THAT 53 MANITOBA PHARMACIES ARE 
INVOLVED IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES. 
THE INDUSTRY HAS CREATED UPWARDS OF 2000 JOBS IN TOWNS 
THROUGHOUT THIS TRADITIONAL MANUFACTURING AND FARMING 
PROVINCE.

INVESTED HEAVILY IN BRICKS AND MORTAR, AS WELL AS 
SOPHISTICATED COMPUTER AND ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEMS. 
CANADA DRUGS FILLS OVER 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY, ALL FOR 
EXPORT TO THE UNITED STATES.  CUSTOMERS INITIATE AN ORDER 
BY FAXING OR MAILING TO CANADA DRUGS A COPY OF THEIR U.S. 
PRESCRIPTION, TOGETHER WITH A POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM THAT 
WAIVES THE CANADIAN PHARMACIST OF LIABILITY, AND A 
PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRE.  AN IN-HOUSE PHARMACIST AT CANADA 
DRUGS REVIEWS MATERIALS, A CANADIAN PHYSICIAN CO-SIGNS 
THE PRESCRIPTION, AND THE PHARMACIST REVIEWS IT A SECOND 
TIME AFTER A TECHNICIAN FILLS THE ORDER, AND ONCE MORE 
BEFORE IT IS SHIPPED OUT.  EACH ORDER IS CONFIRMED BY 
PHONE WITH THE CUSTOMER BEFORE IT IS SENT.  CANADA DRUGS 
HAS 18 PHARMACISTS ON STAFF, OVER 40 PHARMACEUTICAL 
TECHNICIANS, AND APPROXIMATELY 170 STAFF IN TOTAL. 
 
--PROVINCE STEPPING IN TO SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY-- 
 
4. THE GOVERNMENT OF MANITOBA (GOM) IS A STRONG SUPPORTER 
OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORT INDUSTRY AND VIEWS THE NEW 
BUSINESSES AS A KEY COMPONENT OF ITS PROVINCIAL GROWTH 
STRATEGY.  EXPORTS FROM CANADA STILL ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 
LESS THAN ONE-HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE U.S. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG MARKET.  THE GOM IS WORKING WITH THE 
MPA AND THE MANITOBA COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS 
(MCPS) ON SMOOTHING OUT THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO 
LEGITIMIZE THE INDUSTRY.  AS FAR AS THE GOM IS CONCERNED, 
EXPORTING PHARMACEUTICALS TO THE U.S. IS NOT ILLEGAL 
UNDER CANADIAN LAW, AND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN 
ENFORCING U.S. PROHIBITIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IF 
THE FDA WILL NOT ENFORCE THEM.  THE GOM IS INSTEAD 
FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE PRACTICE IS SAFE, MEETS 
CANADIAN FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL GUIDELINES AND PRACTICES, 
AND THAT INTERNET PHARMACIES PROVIDE U.S. CONSUMERS WITH 
THE SAME SAFEGUARDS AND LEVEL OF SERVICE AS CANADIAN 
CITIZENS. 
 
5. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS FOR THE PROVINCIAL 
REGULATORY AUTHORITIES ACROSS CANADA HAS BEEN THE 
PRACTICE OF CANADIAN PHYSICIANS CO-SIGNING, OR RE-WRITING 
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR U.S. PATIENTS THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN. 
REGULATORS HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER SIGNING OFF ON 
PRESCRIPTIONS WITHOUT PERFORMING AN APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL 
EXAMINATION IS TANTAMOUNT TO PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT. 
THE MPA HAS WORKED WITH THE MCPS TO CLAMP DOWN ON THE 
MOST EGREGIOUS CASES WHERE PHYSICIANS WERE \"RUBBER 
STAMPING\" MORE THAN 1000 PRESCRIPTIONS A DAY.  DESPITE 
THESE CONCERNS, THE MPA, THE MCPS, AND MANITOBA\'S 
INTERNET PHARMACIES RECENTLY SIGNED OFF ON A GOM PLAN TO 
ELIMINATE CO-SIGNING BY A CANADIAN PHYSICIAN ALTOGETHER 
AND TO ACCEPT PRESCRIPTIONS FROM U.S. PHYSICIANS ON PAR 
WITH THOSE FROM CANADA.  THE GOM IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE 
THEIR PROPOSAL SHORTLY AND SEEK THE NECESSARY LEGISLATIVE 
CHANGES TO DO AWAY WITH CO-SIGNING IN THE FALL.  THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY CHALLENGE THIS PROVINCIAL 
LEGISLATION. 
 
6. THE STRONG PROMOTION OF THE INDUSTRY FROM MANITOBAN 
OFFICIALS IS IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH 
OF OTHER PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS AND REGULATORS.  ONTARIO 
HAS TAKEN THE STRONGEST STANCE AGAINST INTERNET 
PHARMACIES, QUESTIONING BOTH THE LEGITIMACY OF THE CROSS- 
BORDER TRADE IN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS AND THE 
ABILITY OF THE PROVINCIAL REGULATORS TO EFFECTIVELY 
MONITOR THE SALE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOUTH OF THE 
BORDER.  THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS OF 
ONTARIO, THE SELF-REGULATING BODY FOR THE PROVINCE\'S 
MEDICAL PROFESSION, HAS STATED THAT \"IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE 
FOR A PHYSICIAN TO SIGN OR CO-SIGN A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT 
ATTENDING THE PATIENT.\"  THE ONTARIO COLLEGE OF 
PHARMACISTS HAS ALSO WEIGHED IN STATING THAT PHARMACISTS 
\"SHALL NOT FACILITATE OR ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH 
PHYSICIANS FOR THE PURPOSES OF CO-SIGNING OR REWRITING 
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR OUT-OF-COUNTRY PATIENTS.\"  IN JUNE THE 
ONTARIO COURTS WILL HEAR A CASE AGAINST A NUMBER OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH AN ONLINE 
PHARMACY, THE CANADIAN DRUG STORE INC., WHICH IS ACCUSED 
OF UNLAWFULLY OPERATING AN UNACCREDITED INTERNET PHARMACY 
AND FILLING PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN BY U.S. PHYSICIANS FOR 
U.S. PATIENTS. 
 
--CLOUDS LOOMING OVER THE INDUSTRY-- 
 
7. DESPITE THE INDUSTRY\'S RECENT GROWTH, THE ENORMOUS 
POTENTIAL FOR LOWER-PRICED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE U.S. 
MARKETPLACE, AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENT AND 
REGULATORY OFFICIALS, THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THE 
CROSS-BORDER INTERNET PHARMACEUTICAL TRADE IS TENUOUS. 
IN ADDITION TO A POSSIBLE CRACKDOWN ON IMPORTERS BY THE 
FDA OR A LEGISLATIVE FIX BY CONGRESS TO PROVIDE SENIORS 
WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, THERE ARE SEVERAL 
DOMESTIC FACTORS THAT COULD SEVERELY DAMAGE THE CANADIAN 
INDUSTRY. 
 
8. BRITISH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER GLAXOSMITHKLINE 
(GSK), WHICH ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY THAT THEY WOULD NO 
LONGER SUPPLY THEIR PRODUCTS TO CANADIAN PHARMACIES 
SELLING TO THE U.S. MARKET, IS APPLYING THE GREATEST 
PRESSURE.  PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURES ARE CONCERNED THAT 
THE GROWING CROSS-BORDER TRADE COULD LEAD TO A NUMBER OF 
PROBLEMS: SHORTAGES OF BOTH CANADIAN PHARMACISTS AND DRUG 
PRODUCTS FOR CANADIAN CONSUMERS, DRUGS UNAPPROVED IN THE 
U.S. BEING DISPENSED TO U.S. PATIENTS, INFRINGEMENT OF 
U.S. PATENTS, AND POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR CANADIAN DRUG 
COMPANIES.  IN PRIVATE WE HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT FOR 
THE FIRST TIME COMPANIES HAVE EXPERIENCED DECREASED SALES 
OF KEY DRUGS IN NORTHERN BORDER STATES. 
 
9. KRIS THORKELSON FROM CANADA DRUGS ADMITTED THAT 
SUPPLIES OF SOME GSK DRUGS ARE STARTING TO RUN SHORT. 
THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SECURE SUPPLIES THROUGH 
OTHER CANADIAN PHARMACIES, BUT IS BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE 
DELAYS AND IS CONCERNED THAT THEY MAY NO LONGER BE ABLE 
MEET THE DEMAND.  EFFORTS BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL EXPORTERS 
TO COUNTER GSK\'S ACTIONS WERE DERAILED WHEN CANADA\'S 
FEDERAL COMPETITION BUREAU RULED IN MARCH THAT GSK HAD A 
\"REASONABLE BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION\" TO BLOCK THE EXPORTS. 
ASTRAZENECA\'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WILL LIMIT 
SUPPLIES OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO CANADIAN PHARMACIES AND 
WHOLESALERS HAS COMPOUNDED THE SUPPLY PROBLEMS FOR 
INTERNET PHARMACIES. 
 
10. A RELATED, AND YET UNTESTED, QUESTION IS HOW FEDERAL 
AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS WILL REACT IF THE DEMAND FROM 
INTERNET PHARMACIES BEGINS TO AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF DRUGS 
TO TRADITIONAL PHARMACIES SERVING CANADIAN PATIENTS.  THE 
GOM IS PROMOTING A \"MANITOBA FIRST\" POLICY TO ENSURE THAT 
MANITOBANS ARE NOT DENIED ACCESS TO DRUGS IF THERE IS A 
SHORTAGE, BUT THE POLICY LACKS THE REGULATORY TEETH THAT 
WOULD FORCE PHARMACIES TO SELL TO THE MANITOBA MARKET. 
FEDERAL REGULATIONS DO NOT STIPULATE THAT PHARMACIES MUST 
MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF DRUGS OR COMPEL THEM TO 
GIVE FIRST PRIORITY TO CANADIAN CONSUMERS.  BOTH HEALTH 
CANADA AND INDUSTRY CANADA ARE MONITORING THE CANADIAN 
DRUG SUPPLY AND HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD INTERVENE 
IN EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES, AS THEY DID WHEN THERE WAS A 
RUN ON CIPRO DURING THE ANTHRAX SCARE IN 2001. 
 
11. PROVINCIAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
EXPORT INDUSTRY ARE ALSO BEING CLOSELY WATCHED BY THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  PROVINCIAL REGULATORS SET AND 
ENFORCE THE PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYSICIANS AND 
PHARMACISTS, BUT HEALTH CANADA, THROUGH THE HEALTH ACT 
AND FOOD AND DRUG ACT, IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
SAFETY OF FOODS, DRUGS AND HEALTH PRODUCTS.  IN A RECENT 
MEETING WITH USG OFFICIALS, DAVID EDWARDS, LEGAL COUNSEL 
AT HEALTH CANADA, NOTED THAT ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH ACT, 
A \"PRACTITIONER\" MUST BE A CANADIAN, AND THAT IT WOULD 
NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR THE GOM TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A 
CANADIAN DOCTOR TO CO-SIGN A PRESCRIPTION BEFORE IT COULD 
BE FILLED BY A CANADIAN PHARMACIST. 
 
--COMMENT- 
 
12. DEPENDING ON WHOM ONE SPEAKS WITH AND THEIR RELATION 
TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, BI-NATIONAL TRADE IN 
PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS IS EITHER A MARKET WITH HUGE 
GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR RURAL CANADIAN COMMUNITIES, OR A 
LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS THAT HAS ACHIEVED TEMPORAL 
SUCCESS ARBITRAGING GAPS IN REGULATIONS AND PRICES.  THE 
LEGAL FRAMEWORK SURROUNDING THE CROSS-BORDER TRADE HAS 
NOT BEEN SOLIDIFIED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BORDER, AND 
UNTIL IT IS MANY OF THE ISSUES WILL REMAIN OPEN TO 
INTERPRETATION.  OTHER PROVINCES ARE PAYING CLOSE 
ATTENTION TO DEVELOPMENTS IN MANITOBA TO SEE HOW THE 
INTERNET BUSINESS MODEL WILL RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE 
MARKETPLACE AND WHAT IMPACTS THIS MAY HAVE FOR THE 
CANADIAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

SUBJECT: CANADA REPORTS FIRST NORTH AMERICA BSE CASE 
 
THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED; PLEASE HANDLE 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (U) Canadian Agriculture Minister Lyle Van Clief notified 
Ambassador on May 20 that the Minister would announce that 
afternoon Canada\'s (and North America\'s) first case of bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in an animal not imported 
from Europe.  Agriculture Canada\'s draft press release -- 
faxed to WHA/CAN and USTR -- notes that the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency (CFIA) has quarantined the farm in northern 
Alberta where Canada\'s ongoing BSE surveillance program had 
identified a suspect animal at slaughter and declared its 
meat unfit to enter the food chain.  The animal was rendered 
and CFIA is now investigating the uses to which its tallow 
and gelatin might have been put (Note: Canada prohibits use 
of bone meal or other byproducts in feed for other ruminant 
animals.  End Note). Specimens from the suspect animal were 
sent to the World Reference Library in the UK, which informed 
the GOC on May 20 that it had verified the presence of BSE. 
CFIA is now tracking down the animal\'s origin, determining 
how its remains were processed and ensuring that it 
identifies all calves originating from the 150-head herd 
Once the entire herd has been tested, it and any other herds 
determined to be at risk will be destroyed. 
 
2. (SBU) The GOC has acted quickly to deal with the threat 
BSE poses to the Alberta beef industry and to maintain 
confidence in the CFIA\'s BSE surveillance program.  The 
Minister\'s message to the Ambassador, efforts by Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade officials to touch 
base with USG counterparts and ongoing contacts between CFIA 
and APHIS underscore the Canadians\' understanding that this 
is a North American problem. Canadian officials with whom 
Emboffs have discussed the issue have actively solicited USG 
advice on how best to manage any health or trade fallout from 
this discovery and indicated their willingness to work with 
us to ensure that there are no further cases.  Beef cattle 
and meat products account for 13 percent of Canada\'s 
agricultural exports and 22 percent of ag exports to the U.S. 
(US$ 2.25 billion annually), so the stakes are very high. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment: The GOC has been greatly concerned by USG 
plans to implement a Congressionally mandated 
country-of-origin labelling program for beef cattle. 
However, had such a program been in place when this infected 
animal was found, its origin would have been immediately 
evident, saving considerable investigative time and effort.

SUBJECT: (C/NF) CANADA: A GOVERNMENT ADRIFT 
 
REF: (A) OTTAWA 917 
 
Classified By: DCM Stephen R. Kelly. Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: Despite guarded optimism that the GOC 
might try to \"make amends\" for its anti-U.S. handling of Iraq 
policy, it has become increasingly apparent that the 
government\'s behavior on Iraq was symptomatic of a much 
deeper problem:  as in Baghdad, the leadership has gone 
underground.  PM Chretien, once known for his iron-fisted 
control of the Liberal Caucus, appears to have \"lost his fast 
ball.\" Since announcing his retirement in 2004, Chretien 
increasingly has been detached from policymaking and the 
business of governing, and more concerned about forcing 
through \"legacy\" projects, regardless of their consequences. 
Though this bodes ill for gaining Canadian cooperation on key 
issues in the immediate term, we should continue to advance 
our broad bilateral agenda through established channels with 
an eye to the post-Chretien era. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C/NF) In a political system that vests so much power in 
the office of the Prime Minister, the consequence of the PM\'s 
decision to step down and his early disengagement from his 
responsibilities -- a government in disarray -- seems 
inevitable.  The unraveling of Canadian policymaking and 
governance can be traced through a number of events in the 
past 8 months. Beginning with reactions to the PM\'s startling 
announcement (his own advisors didn\'t know), last September, 
that Canada would ratify the Kyoto Protocol, to the current 
confusion over missile defense and drug policy, GOC 
decision-making has reflected the PM\'s gradual loss of 
control--and thus his legendary ability to force policy--over 
a restive Liberal House Caucus. 
 
3. (C/NF) Though the Caucus stood in unity with the Chretien 
over his anti-war stance, many Members of Parliament voiced 
misgivings, on and off the record, over the \"handling\" of 
related Iraq issues and the government\'s waffling, bumptious 
approach toward the U.S.  Since then, divisions within the 
Caucus have deepened and grown, fueled in part by the kicking 
into high gear of the three-way party leadership contest to 
succeed Chretien.  The SARS crisis in Toronto precipitated 
the \"unsightly public spectacle\" of infighting among Cabinet 
ministers when Heritage Minister Sheila Copps and Health 
Minister Anne McClellan got into a public spat over handling 
of the SARS crisis.  McClellan also has taken issue with 
Justice Minister Cauchon\'s marijuana decriminalization bill, 
voicing strong concern that the new legislation would 
increase marijuana use in Canada. 
 
4. (C/NF) With two-thirds of the House Liberal Caucus already 
backing Chretien\'s political arch-rival, Paul Martin, for 
leadership of the party, the Prime Minister\'s ability to 
advance even his own limited agenda is quickly bogging down. 
Emboldened MPs are pushing back on key legacy-related 
legislation, including a bill to curb corporate and union 
donations to political parties, and marijuana 
decriminalization. Liberal Party leader Stephen LeDrew, an 
acknowledged Martin supporter, has been leading the charge 
against political contributions reform, and a number of 
backbench MPs have begun to challenge the proposed 
legislation publicly as well. 
 
5. (C/NF) With few carrots (the promise of \"early summer 
recess\" doesn\'t really cut it) and no sticks (beyond the 
empty threat of calling early elections) to force his 
legislative program through the House of Commons, PM Chretien 
is even less likely to take on really sticky issues such as 
missile defense.  Hence last week\'s Cabinet non-decision on 
whether to enter missile defense negotiations with the U.S. 
should come as no surprise.  Notwithstanding the earnest--and 
even forward-leaning by GOC standards--efforts of Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Ministers Graham and McCallum to sell MD 
to their peers in the House, the PM\'s complete lack of 
presence on the issue has helped to amplify the voice of the 
anti-military opposition and the \"left wing\" of the Liberal 
Party and thus keep alive the debate. 
 
Consequences for the U.S. 
------------------------- 
6. (C/NF) Chretien steadfastly maintains that he has no 
intention of retiring sooner than his announced date of 
February 2004, though his remaining at the helm of government 
beyond the November 15 election of his successor will 
compound the existing disarray in the GOC. Pressure for him 
to step down early may increase as November 15 draws near, 
potentially detracting further from the Fall legislative 
agenda.  A number of pundits have reflected that matters 
could \"get worse\" in September, when 85 percent of delegates 
representing the Liberals\' 301 ridings are nominated and 
declare their voting intentions (thereby \"crowning\" Paul 
Martin ahead of schedule). While we anticipate little 
improvement in GOC behavior or decision-making until Chretien 
has gone, the extended \"interregnum\" period is an opportunity 
to consolidate contacts with prospective members of the next 
government. In the meantime, we should continue to advance 
our broad bilateral agenda through established contacts and 
institutions.

1. (S) In response to reftel demarche, DFAIT Middle East 
Division Deputy Director Graeme McIntyre affirmed that the 
GOC had taken a decision to facilitate the return to Baghdad 
of Iraqi Charge d\'Affaires Mamdouh S. MUSTAFA, the sole Iraqi 
diplomat remaining in Canada. POL/Liaison sources at post 
advise that CSIS (Canadian intelligence) was unaware of the 
GOC/DFAIT decision to facilitate Mustafa\'s departure from 
Canada. 
 
2. (C) According to McIntyre, Mustafa was accredited to 
Canada in 2000/01 as a full Charge d\'Affaires -- as opposed 
to \"ad interim\"-- after his predecessor, Mohammad H. 
Al-Saffar, failed to resume his post. Though he could not 
give us a timeline for Mustafa\'s departure, McIntyre said it 
would help the GOC if Mustafa were included in the worldwide 
list of former regime officials posted abroad whose departure 
USG previously had encouraged to different host governments. 
 
3. (C) McIntyre said the GOC is particularly sensitive to the 
possibility of negative press coverage about Mustafa\'s 
departure (and, probably, the likelihood that left-leaning 
opposition MPs will attack the government decision as a 
\"rights\" violation etc.). Poloff noted that if Mustafa was 
accredited to Canada as a full charge, then it would appear 
that he fell into the category of \"head of mission\" and is 
thus covered by the instruction from the Iraqi MFA.

SUBJECT: CANADA-FRANCE: VISIT OF FRENCH PM RAFFARIN 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  HANDLE APPROPRIATELY. 
 
1.(SBU) DFAIT Director General for Western Europe Cecile 
Latour and Deputy Director Denis Robert characterized the 
brief (less than 24 hours) visit of French PM Raffarin to 
Ottawa as an unqualified success. The visit originally was 
conceived around Quebec\'s May 21-23 hosting of the annual 
meeting of Futurallia, an international business alliance 
(SME networking and \"matchmaking\") launched in Poitiers, 
France, in 1989. Raffarin apparently took a vivid interest in 
the development of Futurallia during his time as President of 
Poitou-Charente region. Though the focus of the visit was 
primarily bilateral cooperation in a number of areas -- 
including strong French interest in Canada as a model for 
\"decentralization\" of the government -- PM Chretien did 
commit to support a UN-led intervention in the Congo (a 
\"small contribution\"), should one come to pass. 
 
2.(U) In a joint communique on May 22, Raffarin and Chretien 
welcomed the UNSC resolution on Iraq reconstruction as a 
\"credible framework\" for mobilizing the international 
community to assist in reconstruction of Iraq. They affirmed 
the central role of the UN and Security Council in the 
\"collective treatment of regional crises and in responding to 
the challenge posed by the risks of proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction\" and confirmed support for implementation 
of the MEPP Roadmap proposed by the diplomatic Quartet. The 
two PMs declared the importance of a \"new-generation 
agreement\" on Canadian trade and investment with the EU, and 
mutual commitment to bilateral efforts ensuring the success 
of the Doha Round.  They reaffirmed commitment to prioritize 
development in Africa through the G8 Africa Action Plan, as 
affirmed at the Kananaskis summit, and agreed to \"further 
develop\" dialogue on implementation of Kyoto Protocol 
commitments. 
 
3. (SBU) During the joint press conference on Thursday, 
Raffarin praised the UNSC resolution on Iraq reconstruction 
as a very promising sign for the future. He asserted France\'s 
solidarity with the U.S. -- particularly in the wake of the 
bombings in Riyadh and Morocco -- in combating terrorism and 
proliferation.  The francophone newspaper La Presse reported 
that while Chretien also saw the resolution as a positive 
development toward enabling Iraq to regain its autonomy, he 
nonetheless reiterated that he disagreed with the manner in 
which the U.S. had imposed its will on the situation, noting 
that this was \"not the customary way to change a regime.\"

SUBJECT: CANADA - 2003 RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT 
 
REF: A. OTTAWA 02 1429 
 
1. Sensitive but Unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
2. The following constitutes Ottawa\'s submission for the 2003 
International Religious Freedom Report. 
 
Introduction and Overview 
 
No changes. 
 
Section I:  Religious Demography 
 
Paragraph that begins \"There is no state or dominant 
religion...\"  - revise as follows: 
 
While there is no state or dominant religion, an estimated 
74.6 percent of the Canadian population belongs to Christian 
dominations or claims Christianity as their religion. Roman 
Catholics (43 percent of the population) constitute the 
largest single religious denomination, followed by Protestant 
denominations (29 percent). United Church, Anglican, 
Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, and Pentecostal are the 
largest Protestant denominations in Canada. 1.1 percent of 
the Canadian population is Jewish.  According to a recent 
government census, the percentage of the population who are 
members of the Muslim faith has increased to 2 percent of the 
population; the number of Muslims in Canada has doubled in 
the 10-year period since the last census. Other religious 
groups in Canada include Buddhists (approximately 1 percent 
of the population); Hindus (1 percent); and Sikhs (1 
percent). The number of persons professing other religions, 
such as Scientology, Baha\'i, Shinto, Taoism, aboriginal 
spirituality, and pagan religions, constitutes 0.2 percent of 
the population. The census also reflected that the percentage 
of Canadians claiming no religious affiliation is 16 percent 
of the total population, an increase from 12 percent in the 
last census. 
 
A 2002 poll on religious attitudes by the Pew Research Center 
indicated that approximately 21 percent of Canadians attend 
church on a weekly basis. 30 percent of Canadians, according 
to the survey, said that religion is very important to them. 
 
 
Section II: Status of Religious Freedom 
 
Paragraph 3 that begins, \"The Constitution and...,\" revise as 
follows: 
 
The Constitution of Canada and the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms protect the rights or privileges possessed by 
denominational schools at the time of national union in 1867. 
 In practice this protection has meant that some provinces 
have funded and continue to fund Catholic school education, 
and some provinces (such as Quebec) have funded some 
Protestant education.  In recent years, the Quebec provincial 
government took steps to abolish Catholic and Protestant 
status for public schools; public schools in Quebec are no 
longer faith-based and are open to all. And the Ontario 
provincial government, which previously had allowed tax 
credits only for tuition paid to Roman Catholic private 
schools, began allowing tax credits for tuition paid to all 
private schools, provided such schools satisfy certain 
educational standards. 
 
There is no official government council for interfaith 
dialogue, but the government of Canada provides funding for 
individual ecumenical projects on a case-by-case basis. 
 
Restrictions on Religious Freedom 
 
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally 
free practice of religion. 
 
Remainder of paragraph beginning \"(H)owever, in May 2001...\", 
and paragraph beginning \"(I)n July 2001...\" - delete. 
Replace with the following: 
 
The Supreme Court of Canada recently agreed to hear cases 
brought by groups in Quebec that claim their religious rights 
have been unduly restricted by condominium contracts, and 
municipal bylaws. One case involves a group of Orthodox 
Jewish families, living in a Montreal condominium complex, 
who were barred by the condominium association from 
constructing temporary huts on their balconies to celebrate 
the fall festival of Sukkot. The second case involves a group 
of Jehovah\'s Witnesses who are seeking the rezoning of a 
tract of land they own, so that a church hall can be built on 
the land. The municipality where the land is located refused 
to rezone the land, because the land would no longer be 
subject to property taxes if a place of worship was built on 
it. Decisions in these cases are expected sometime this year. 
 
A standing committee on justice and human rights organized by 
the Parliament of Canada is currently conducting a series of 
public hearings on the issue of whether homosexual couples 
have the right to marry.  The hearings were organized after 
an Ontario court ruled that the legal definition of marriage 
as a union of one man and one woman violated the equality 
rights of homosexuals. Some of the hearings have resulted in 
spirited debates between gay rights advocates and 
representatives of religious faiths, who assert that marriage 
is a religious and not a political matter, and that religious 
denominations should not be forced into ordaining same-sex 
marriages. The committee is expected to bring its 
recommendations on the issue to Parliament later this year. 
 
There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees. 
 
Forced Religious Conversion 
 
No changes to this paragraph. 
 
Improved and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious 
Freedom. 
 
Delete sentence beginning \"In September 2001...\" 
 
Section III.  Societal Attitudes 
 
The generally amicable relationship among the religions in 
society contributes to religious freedom in Canada.  (After 
this sentence, delete remainder of first paragraph, and the 
second, third and fourth paragraphs of this section.  Replace 
with the following:) 
 
However, tension continues to exist between the Jewish and 
Islamic communities in Canada, perhaps reflecting the 
continued conflict in the Middle East. The number of 
anti-Semitic incidents in Canada increased again during this 
period, and there have been expressions of anti-Muslim 
feeling as well. 
 
The B\'nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights received 459 
reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2002, an increase of 173 
incidents from 2001. Incidents included general harassment of 
Jews (282 or 61 percent of the reported incidents), vandalism 
of property (148 or 32 percent), and violence (29 or 6 
percent). In an incident in Montreal on September 9, 2002, 
pro-Palestinian demonstrators assaulted a number of Jews 
during a riot on the Concordia University campus, where 
former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 
scheduled to give a speech.  In Toronto, there was 
controversy following the July 2002 murder of an orthodox 
Jew. The accused murderer is a young skinhead, and many 
members of the Jewish community believed the victim had been 
killed because of his religion, thus making the murder a hate 
crime. 
 
Expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment continued in Canada 
during this period, according to the Canadian chapter of the 
Council on American Islamic Relations. In a survey released 
in September 2002, 60 percent of Canadian Muslims said they 
had experienced bias or discrimination in the period 
following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  The build-up to the 
war in Iraq stirred up some anti-Muslim feeling in Canada, 
but also resulted in some expressions of compassion and 
support towards Muslims. The main forms of prejudice 
experienced by Muslims were verbal abuse, religious or ethnic 
profiling, and discrimination in the workplace. Some Muslims 
believe the government of Canada has been indifferent to 
anti-Muslim attitudes and discrimination. 
 
In November 2002, an information center in Quebec run by the 
Raelian religion was vandalized. Damage to the center, known 
as \"UFO Land,\" amounted to more than C$100,000. The Raelian 
Church of Canada is an officially recognized religion in 
Quebec. The religion, which is based on the idea that 
extraterrestrials created humanity as part of a lab 
experiment, had targeted Quebec high schools as part of its 
ongoing campaign to persuade Roman Catholics to renounce 
their faith. 
 
 
Section IV.  U.S. Government Policy. 
 
The U.S. Government discusses religious freedom issues with 
the Government of Canada in the context of its overall 
dialogue and policy of promoting human rights.

1. (U) Summary: In a meeting on May 23, officials with 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada told poloffs that while 
Canada is prepared to meet its commitments concerning the 
resettlement of refugees under its Safe Third Country 
Agreement with the United States, it will not begin to do so 
until that agreement is fully implemented by the U.S. End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) Poloffs met on May 23 with Daniel Jean, Acting 
Assistant Deputy Minister for Policy and Program Development 
at Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), and Bruce 
Scoffield, Director of the Refugees Branch in Policy and 
Program Development, to convey the points set out reftel. 
While we had initially requested a meeting with CIC Deputy 
Minister Michel Dorrais, we were referred to Acting ADM Jean. 
Jean said Canada is prepared to set in motion the process 
necessary to for resettlement of refugees referred to Canada 
by the U.S., as proposed in the side letter to the Safe Third 
Country agreement, once that agreement has been fully 
implemented by the U.S. Jean said he had heard it will be 
several months before the safe third regulations are 
published in the U.S., and commented \"we are becoming very 
impatient\" with this delay.  Jean complained that the U.S. 
had asked Canada to take a number of actions following 
September 11, and Canada had responded quickly to those 
requests; the Safe Third Country agreement was the one thing 
Canada asked of the U.S., and it has not yet been completed. 
 
3.  (U) With respect to the issue of resettling interdicted 
Cubans now located at Guantanamo, Jean indicated that GOC 
views Guantanamo as Cuban territory, and therefore Canada 
cannot accept such persons under current regulations as that 
would constitute in-country processing for refugees. 
Scoffield noted that third country nationals located at 
Guantanamo, such as Haitians, can be resettled in Canada. 
Referring to Michael Smith\'s May 19 letter to DAS Ryan, Jean 
emphasized that Canada wants to see procedures set in place 
for the referral of refugee cases by the U.S., and is ready 
to meet with the U.S. to begin discussing such procedures. 
Jean also stated that Canada would like to include the policy 
implications of refugee resettlement in a broader dialogue 
with the U.S. on humanitarian issues, another point made in 
Smith\'s letter.

SUBJECT: CANADA: GOVERNMENT INTRODUCES LEGISLATIVE CHANGES 
TO ITS CONTROLLED DRUGS AND SUBSTANCES ACT - THE CANNABIS 
REFORM BILL 
 
1.  Summary:  On May 27, Canada\'s Minister of Health Anne 
McLellan, Minister of Justice Martin Cauchon, and Solicitor 
General Wayne Easter presented to the House of Commons the 
long-awaited legislative reforms to Canada\'s Controlled Drugs 
and Substances Act pertaining to marijuana. Debate in the 
House will now take place and, according to Minister Cauchon, 
the Government hopes the new law will be in place by the end 
of the year.  The legislative changes are part of what 
Minister McLellan said  is a renewed National Drug Strategy 
that,the GoC hopes, will decrease the use of harmful drugs, 
decrease the supply of illicit drugs, modernize and promote 
anti-drug laws (including adjusting penalties), and promote 
healthy decision-making, especially among younger Canadians. 
End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The Proposed Marijuana legislation 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.  The Government of Canada, spearheaded by the Ministers of 
Health and Justice and the Solicitor General, introduced the 
Cannabis Reform Bill (C-38) to the House of Commons on May 
27.  According to the GoC\'s press release, this bill, if 
enacted, would replace the current criminal court process and 
resulting criminal penalties with alternative penalties for 
possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana or one gram or 
less of cannabis resin (hashish); would provide law 
enforcement officers the discretion to give a ticket or issue 
a summons to appear in criminal court for possession of 
between 15 and 30 grams of marijuana; would provide for 
greater alternative penalties when aggravating factors are 
present (including possession while committing an indictable 
offense such as operating a motor vehicle or while on or near 
school grounds); and would create new offenses and provide 
for tougher penalties for illegal growers.  Specifically, the 
proposed bill would set penalties for the possession of 
marijuana as: 
 
-- possession of 15 grams or less of marijuana - fine of USD 
100 (youth USD 70) 
 
-- possession of one gram or less of cannabis resin - fine of 
USD 200 (youth USD 130) 
 
-- possession of 15 to 30 grams of marijuana - fine of USD 
200 (youth USD 130). 
 
3. For possession of 15 to 30 grams, the police officer 
present would retain the ability to determine if the offender 
should receive a ticket or be issued a summons for a summary 
conviction. If a summary conviction is determined, the 
penalty for possession would be up to six months in prison 
and/or up to about USD 700 in fines.   Moreover, if an 
individual is caught in possession of marijuana while he/she 
is operating a motor vehicle or while near a school,  or if 
there are other aggravating factors, the fines could be 
increased to about USD 300 for an adult and USD 175 for a 
youth under 18.  And, if an offender is under 18 years of 
age, his/her parent/guardian would receive a written notice 
of the child\'s infraction. 
 
4. By decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of 
marijuana, the GoC claims that it will be able to focus more 
law enforcement resources on combating commercial marijuana 
growers and traffickers, including those associated with 
organized criminal groups.  In his announcement, Minister of 
Justice Cauchon said the new legislation would increase 
penalties for commercial growers.  For instance, individuals 
caught growing between 1 and 3 plants could face up to 12 
months in jail plus fines up to USD 3500, growers of between 
4 and 25 plants could get up to 18 months in jail and fines 
up to USD 16,500, growers of 26 to 50 plants could face 10 
years and growers of over 50 plants could get 14 years in 
prison. In addition, in cases involving the growing of more 
than three plants, a judge would have to provide reason why 
imprisonment was not imposed where any of the following 
aggravating factors was found: 
 
-- a risk of danger for children in the building where the 
operation exists; 
 
-- use of traps (set to protect the premises from intruders 
or police); 
 
-- use of explosives (booby traps or to destroy evidence); 
 
-- use of land belonging to others (farm land); and 
 
-- operation creating a safety hazard in a residential area. 
 
 
According to Cauchon, the GoC is proposing no changes to the 
penalties for those individuals convicted of narcotics 
trafficking. 
 
 
5. Though Minister of Health McLellan stated in her public 
announcement that the GoC recognizes that its move to 
decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
would likely result in an immediate increase in the number of 
users, she believed this would be a temporary response by the 
public and not a long-lasting trend.  McLellan stated that 
the proposed decriminalization of marijuana was part of a 
renewal of Canada\'s National Drug Strategy and pledged a new 
5-year-USD160 million budget to decrease the use of harmful 
drugs; decrease the supply of illicit drugs, modernize and 
promote anti-drug laws (including adjusting penalties), and 
promote healthy decision-making, especially among younger 
Canadians. 
 
6.  For his part, Canada\'s Solicitor General Wayne Easter 
stated that the renewed National Drug Strategy would devote 
additional resources to Canada\'s drug awareness program and 
would give Canada\'s law enforcement increased tools with 
which to fight Canada\'s drug war.  For instance, Easter 
stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) would 
receive more resources for their efforts to identify and 
dismantle indoor marijuana grow operations and precursor 
chemical laboratories , money to teach police how to identify 
individuals who drive while impaired, money for substance 
abuse treatment programs in Canada\'s penal institutions, and 
funds to establish a coordination subgroup within the 
Solicitor General\'s office. 
 
7.  Comment: Though the GoC is quick to stress that the 
introduction of C-38 is in accordance with the will of the 
Canadian people, some MPs, including members of the majority 
Liberal Party, have already expressed concern about the bill. 
 According to Liberal MP Dan McTeague, (quote) it is clear 
that there are problems (with C-38) and that some 20 or more 
other Liberal MPs are opposed (unquote).  Not surprisingly 
other MPs, for instance Libby Davis, NDP and Greg Thompson 
PC, say C-38 is (quote) out of the twilight zone and is not 
well thought out (unquote).  Some Parliament watchers suspect 
(or hope) that if the Prime Minister allows his party to vote 
their consciences, the bill -- as it now is written -- may 
not find its way out of debate before the winter recess - 
thereby effectively killing it.

1. (SBU) Summary - Health Canada has once again deferred 
making a final decision on General Mill\'s August 2001 
application for temporary marketing authority to sell 
breakfast cereals with U.S. vitamin fortification levels in 
Canada.  After their own analysis indicated that high levels 
of folic acid could mask a B-12 vitamin deficiency in 
children, Health Canada decided to wait for the results of an 
Institute of Medicine Study on the tolerable upper levels of 
nutrient intake before making a final judgment on General 
Mill\'s application.  This will delay a decision on General 
Mill\'s submission until fall 2003, at the earliest.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (U) Due to regulatory differences, American manufacturers 
must currently do separate production runs for the Canadian 
and U.S. markets in order to comply with different limits of 
vitamin and micro-nutrient fortification in each country. 
Both Health Canada and USG agencies are sponsoring a 
long-term study of Dietary Reference Intakes by the U.S. 
Institute of Medicine (IOM).  When all phases of the study 
are completed in 2004, it will provide a common baseline for 
each country to review nutrient levels and harmonize 
nutritional standards.  The IOM study is one element of an 
ongoing GOC review of Canada\'s food fortification policy. 
 
3. (SBU) In August 2001, General Mills applied to Health 
Canada for a Temporary Marketing Authorization Letter (TMAL) 
to allow sales of their 19-product range of breakfast cereals 
in Canada at U.S. fortification levels.  The TMAL would 
provide General Mills with immediate, but short-term 
regulatory relief to sell cereals fortified at U.S. levels 
while the IOM study and Canada\'s fortification policy are 
completed.  TMALs are used to permit temporary marketing 
authorization when the benefits of a product are clear but 
the potential risks are still under study.  TMALs have been 
granted by Health Canada for numerous products including 
calcium-enhanced orange juice and Omega-3 eggs.  General 
Mills provided all the information requested by Health 
Canada, and even voluntarily changed fortification levels on 
zinc to Canadian standards.  Well into the review process 
Health Canada raised additional concerns about the levels of 
folic acid and requested further studies.  General Mills 
supplied additional data on folic acid in February 2003.  As 
of mid-May, General Mills had heard nothing from Health 
Canada and asked the Embassy to intervene, which we did. 
 
4. (SBU) On May 28, Health Canada Deputy Minister Ian Green 
informed the DCM and General Mills representatives of the 
results of their analysis of General Mill\'s data on folic 
acid.  The Health Canada panel which reviewed the data is 
concerned that the levels of folic acid permitted under U.S 
regulations could mask a vitamin B-12 deficiency in children. 
 Green noted that studies on the upper levels of intake from 
other countries, including one from the United Kingdom, have 
raised similar concerns.  Health Canada has decided to put 
off a final decision on General Mill\'s TMAL until after the 
publication of an IOM study on the upper reference levels of 
nutrients, which is due to be completed by September 30, 
2003.  This study is part of the larger IOM review of dietary 
reference intakes.  Green promised to provide General Mills 
and the Embassy with a copy of the panel\'s report. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment - We have been extremely frustrated by 
Health Canada\'s lack of transparency throughout the TMAL 
review process.  Our numerous efforts to seek clarification 
from Health Canada on both the process and timing of their 
review have been regularly ignored or belatedly answered with 
bureaucratic doublespeak.  General Mills has complained that 
Health Canada has repeatedly raised the bar as to what is 
required for approval of the TMAL.  The current delay pending 
final results of the IOM study would appear to run counter to 
both the letter and spirit of the TMAL process. In our 
conversation with Green we stressed the importance of 
ensuring that Health Canada takes a final decision on the 
TMAL shortly after the release of the IOM report.

THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - SEE PARA 6. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: The Canadian Government announced 
on May 29 that it has decided to enter into discussions with 
the U.S. on missile defense participation.  This decision 
represents a dramatic shift in Canadian policy on missile 
defense, which was generally viewed in a negative light here 
prior to 2002 because of arms control concerns.  Over the 
past several months, Defense Minister McCallum and Foreign 
Minister Graham were able to convince Prime Minister Chretien 
and most of the Liberal Party caucus that participation in 
missile defense would be in Canada\'s national interest. 
Their strongest argument was that since the U.S. was 
proceeding with missile defense deployment, Canada would be 
jeopardizing its defense relationship with us, in particular 
NORAD, if it did not join.  Now that Canada has taken the 
plunge, we need to work with them to reach an agreement that 
keeps our defense partnership on track. END SUMMARY AND 
COMMENT. 
 
2. (U) Canadian Defense Minister McCallum announced on May 29 
that the GoC has decided to enter into discussions with the 
U.S. on Canadian participation in missile defense.  McCallum 
said this decision was motivated by a desire to protect 
Canadian lives and to preserve NORAD\'s role in the defense of 
North America.  He specifically noted that Canada would like 
the North American missile defense mission to be assigned to 
NORAD, vice NORTHCOM.  McCallum also reiterated Canada\'s 
opposition to weaponization of space, and said that any 
agreement on Canadian participation in missile defense would 
still have to be blessed by Cabinet. 
 
3. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and National Defense (DND) 
contacts told us that the decision to enter missile defense 
negotiations was taken at the May 26 Cabinet meeting, but 
that Prime Minister Chretien had planned to announce the 
decision during his ongoing visit to Europe.  The government 
changed plans because the opposition Canadian Alliance Party 
introduced a motion in the House of Commons on May 29 
affirming its support for NORAD as a counter to ballistic 
missile threats.  The GoC decided to go ahead and announce 
its decision in response to the Canadian Alliance motion. 
The announcement was roundly criticized by Bloc Quebecois and 
New Democratic Party MPs.  (COMMENT: We anticipate sniping 
from hardcore Liberal Party opponents as well, including 
Heritage Minister and Liberal leadership candidate Sheila 
Copps.  END COMMENT) 
 
4. (C) Ron Hoffmann, DFAIT Director for Defense and Security 
Policy, stressed to us that NORAD\'s role in missile defense 
was the key issue in the Cabinet debate over entering 
negotiations.  Several Cabinet officials argued that the 
future of Canada\'s role in North American defense would be 
determined by NORAD\'s involvement in the missile defense 
system.  Other issues included territorial coverage, 
industrial cooperation, and weaponization of space.  Hoffmann 
told us that the GoC recognizes the U.S. is not going to 
agree to any limits on future direction of the missile 
defense system, and that the GoC would like to \"park\" the 
space weaponization issue and not have it become a sticking 
point in negotiations.  He likened this issue to Canada\'s 
position on nuclear disarmament, which it supports while also 
subscribing to a NATO nuclear strategy. 
 
5. (C) Hoffmann told us that the GoC would like to begin 
negotiations as soon as possible.  As a preliminary step, 
Assistant Deputy Ministers Jim Wright (DFAIT) and Ken Calder 
(DND) would like to visit Washington and lay out Canada\'s 
decision and negotiating mandate for senior officials at 
State and Defense.  Hoffmann proposed this visit taking place 
on June 5 or 6.  The GoC would then propose to send its full 
negotiating team to Washington on June 13 or 17 to begin 
discussions.  We cautioned that the U.S. side might need more 
time before starting talks.  Hoffmann urged us to at least 
agree to an early visit by Wright and Calder so that they 
could lay out the GoC approach. 
 
6. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise on availability of U.S. 
officials for meetings with Wright and Calder.

1.(C) Post delivered points contained reftel to Stuart 
Savage, Deputy Political Director in DFAIT\'s Southeast Asia 
Division, on May 29.  Savage indicated Canada shares our view 
that the government of Cambodia should be held to its 
commitment to conduct a credible national election. Savage 
said Canada\'s ambassador in Phnom Penh has been actively 
engaged in a series of meetings and programs to encourage 
fair elections. However, he said the GoC would not make a 
public statement concerning the elections before they take 
place. Canada will send interns working from its embassy in 
Phnom Penh, as well as officers from Canada\'s other embassies 
in the region, to serve as election observers.

CANADA 
 
The United States Government is aware of eight (8) claims of 
U.S. persons that may be outstanding against the Government 
of Canada. 
 
1.  a) Claimant A 
    b) 1995 
 
c) In response to a price increase by Claimant A in charges 
to landfill customers in Quebec, more than 20 municipalities 
formed the La Mauricie Intermunicipal Waste Management 
Authority (REGIE) to take control of the landfill.  Claimant 
A appealed a January 1995 preliminary indemnity order for 
$7.5 million (Canadian dollars), but the REGIE took 
possession on May 1, 1995 and the $7.5 million was paid.  The 
claimant was dissatisfied with this amount, and Quebec 
Indemnity Court proceedings began in December 1995.  On 
December 21, 1998, the Quebec Court Expropriation Chamber 
awarded Claimant A C$24 million.  The Regie appealed this 
ruling to the Quebec Court of Appeals in 1999.  Claimant\'s 
legal counsel informs the Embassy that the Claimant prefers 
to pursue legal remedies through the Quebec courts.  Prior to 
the court decision of 1998, the U.S. Ambassador to Canada, at 
Claimant\'s request, wrote Quebec provincial officials urging 
resolution of the dispute.  The Quebec Court of Appeals will 
not hear the case until 
 fall 2002 or winter 2003.  Claimant A would negotiate an 
out-of-court settlement, and is passing this message through 
provincial political authorities, but would insist on a 
reasonable sum.  Since waste management companies and 
municipal authorities in Quebec collaborate and compete, the 
claimant says he will continue the suit in court because of 
the precedent it may set.  Interest on the 1998 award of C$24 
million has increased the sum to C$30 million. 
 
 
2. a) Claimant B 
   b) 1993 
 
c) The property in question is an undeveloped 2.29 acre plot 
of land, including 220 feet of beachfront on Kingsburg beach 
in Nova Scotia.  The legal owner of the property is a Nova 
Scotia Corporation owned by Claimant B that acquired the 
property on March 3, 1993.  On March 9, 1993, the provincial 
Ministry of Natural Resources declared Kingsburg beach and 
its dune system \"protected\" under the Nova Scotia Beaches 
Protection Act.  This designation prohibited development of 
the property, and Claimant B contends the designation has 
reduced the value of the property to zero, and amounts to a 
taking of the property without compensation.  Claimant B has 
not provided the U.S. Government with an estimate of the 
property\'s value. 
 
Claimant B is one of several landowners affected by the 
designation that has not resolved his dispute.  Claimant B is 
prohibited from building on his property because, unlike 
other landowners that have been permitted to build, he did 
not have required permits in place at the time of the 
designation. 
 
In June 1998, the provincial Supreme Court of Nova Scotia 
ruled in favor of Claimant B.  The Crown appealed that 
decision, however.  A court hearing date was held in May 
1999, and on August 18, 1999, the Nova Scotia Court of 
Appeals handed down its decision allowing the appeal and 
dismissing Claimant B\'s action.  Claimant was advised by the 
Court to offer the provincial government a new proposal for a 
development permit that would meet environmental objections. 
A new proposal was submitted in 2000, but the Nova Scotia 
Ministry of Natural Resources, responding in 2001, did not 
concur with the conclusions of the environmental study and 
request for construction permit submitted by Claimant B. 
 
At the Claimant\'s request, Consulate Hallifax arranged a 
meeting for the Claimant\'s representative with the provincial 
Minister of Natural Resources.  At the meeting, in October, 
2002, the Minister conceded that the Ministry\'s past approach 
did seem unfair as it did not provide clear guidance to 
landowners.  He stated that he would request a follow-up 
study/report from the environmental consulting firm that 
produced the original study and recommendations for 
protection of the beach, with specific guidelines as to what 
type of construction and land use should be permitted.  This 
would provide landowners with a benchmark when submitting 
development plans to the Ministry of Natural Resources. 
 
3. a) Claimant C 
   b) 1991 
c) In 1990 Claimant C formed a joint venture with a British 
Columbia (BC) company to export water from BC streams by 
tanker ship to California.  According to Claimant C, the BC 
Government promised the firm, orally and in writing, that it 
could obtain the license required under the BC Water Act for 
the purpose of export by tanker.  On March 14, 1991, the 
Goleta Water District in the Santa Barbara area announced 
that Claimant C and its Canadian partner had won the contract 
to supply fresh water, in a competition that also included 
three BC firms.  On March 18, 1991, the BC Government imposed 
a moratorium on new bulk water licenses, saying it had to 
review its policies; the moratorium was later extended 
indefinitely.  In 1995, the BC Government enacted a Water 
Protection Act that banned water export by tanker ship. 
 
In January 1993, Claimant C and its partner began litigation, 
and in July 1995, the BC Government asked the two companies 
to submit claims for a negotiated settlement.  The claim of 
the Canadian Partner was settled by a cash payment in July 
1996.  According to Claimant C, the BC Government has refused 
to negotiate a settlement with it, and Claimant continued to 
pursue litigation against the BC government until 1999.  In 
December 1998, Claimant C filed notice of intent to pursue 
compensation under NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions. 
 
In April and May 1999, Claimant C consulted with Canadian 
government officials but was unable to arrive at a 
resolution.  In October 1999, Claimant C filed documents 
requesting arbitration under Chapter 11.  However, the 
Canadian government officials found these documents lacked 
certain required features that permit the Government of 
Canada to organize Chapter 11 arbitration, and requested that 
Claimant C resubmit them.  Claimant C resubmitted these 
documents in May 2000, but the government of Canada has not 
been satisfied that the requirements to initiate Chapter 11 
arbitration proceedings have been fulfilled. 
 
Estimates of value vary.  Claimant C\'s Canadian partner 
reportedly sued for less than $1 million (Canadian Dollars) 
and settled for $335,000 (Canadian).  In 1998, Claimant C 
assessed its damages at between $400 and $500 million. When 
filing its claim for arbitration in 1999, Claimant C assessed 
its \"temporary lost business opportunity\" at $1.5 billion 
and, in the alternative, damages for permanent lost business 
at $10.5 billion. 
 
The Embassy in Ottawa and Consulate in Vancouver have been in 
contact sporadically with Claimant C, and the Government of 
Canada is aware of USG interest in the case.  In keeping with 
NAFTA Chapter 11 procedures, however, the Embassy does not 
take an active role on behalf of Claimant C while 
consultations and dispute resolution measures are proceeding. 
 
4.  a) Claimant D 
    b) 1998 
 
c) In 1995, Claimant D solicited contracts with Canadian 
companies to provide processing, transportation and disposal 
of old electric transformers, which contain significant 
quantities of PCB waste.  Later that year, the Government of 
Canada announced a ban on the export of PCB waste.  Because 
Claimant D proposed to treat the Canadian waste in the U.S., 
Claimant D believes the export ban imposed a material loss to 
the company.  The Canadian ban on PCB waste was in place 
until February 1997, when Canada adopted new regulations 
permitting exports of PCB waste to the U.S.  In July 1997, 
the U.S. closed its border to imports of PCB waste.  On July 
22, 1998, Claimant D announced it would seek compensation 
from the Government of Canada under NAFTA Chapter 11. 
Claimant D requested $20 million in compensation for business 
lost due to the over one-year PCB export ban. 
 
This dispute became a NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration claim when 
Claimant D filed with the Canadian Government on October 30, 
1988.  The Embassy continues to monitor the case, but does 
not intervene with Canadian authorities while Chapter 11 
dispute resolution measures are proceeding. 
In November 2000, the tribunal rendered a partial award 
denying claimant\'s expropriation claim, but finding that 
Canada had breached its obligations under the NAFTA\'s 
national treatment and minimum standard of treatment 
provisions.  A hearing on damages was held in September 2001. 
 The tribunal has not yet issued its decision on damages. 
Canada has petitioned the federal court in Ottawa to set 
aside the arbitral award. 
 
5.  a) Claimant E 
    b) 1998 
 
c) Claimant E owns and operates lumber operations in British 
Columbia. In December 1998, Claimant E announced it intended 
to file under NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions for compensation 
from the Government of Canada.  Claimant E believes Canada 
breached its NAFTA national-treatment obligations through its 
implementation of the Bilateral Softwood Lumber Agreement, 
which governs the export of softwood lumber manufactured in 
the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and 
Quebec to the United States.  The agreement imposed an export 
levy once a given quota of lumber has been reached.  Claimant 
E alleges that the Government of Canada acted in a manner 
inconsistent with its NAFTA national-treatment obligations 
because it distinguishes between investors in the four 
\"listed\" provinces in the Softwood Lumber Agreement versus 
investors in the non-listed provinces, and treated investors 
in Quebec more favorably than investors in the other listed 
provinces.  Claimant E also alleges that Canada failed to 
accord it th 
e international minimum standard of treatment. 
 
In March 1999, this dispute became a NAFTA Chapter 11 
arbitration claim when Claimant E officially filed a claim 
with the Canadian government, seeking $382 million in 
compensation for damages it claims it suffered.  The Tribunal 
proceeding rejected two of Claimant E\'s allegations relating 
to expropriation and performance requirements in June 2000, 
and in April 2001 the tribunal rejected much of the national 
treatment and minimum standard of treatment claims. 
 
On May 31, 2002, the Tribunal issued an award on damages with 
respect to Claimant E\'s minimum standard of treatment claim. 
The Tribunal ordered Canada to pay Claimant E U.S. $461,566, 
with interest payable from and after May 31, 2002 at the rate 
of 5% per annum compounded quarterly and pro rata within a 
quarter.  Further proceedings are being held on questions as 
to costs. 
 
Claimant E has not consulted with the U.S. Embassy or the 
U.S. Consulate in Vancouver.  In keeping with USG policy, the 
Embassy continues to monitor the case, but does not intervene 
with Canadian authorities while Chapter 11 dispute resolution 
measures are proceeding. 
 
6.  a) Claimant F 
    b) 1995 
 
c) Claimant F purchased in good faith a 32 acre parcel of 
land on Prince Edward Island in 1995.  After the purchase, a 
local resident successfully argued in court that he had title 
to the land under the principle of adverse possession, or 
\"squatters\' rights.\"  In January 1999, the provincial Supreme 
Court of Prince Edward Island ruled against Claimant F. 
Claimant F believes this decision constitutes a taking of his 
land by government decision.  Claimant F said he would appeal 
the decision through the court system with a locally-hired 
attorney.  Claimant F has not provided the U.S. Government 
with an estimated value of the claim.  U.S. Consulate 
personnel have not heard from Claimant F since, 1999, and 
attempts to contact him have been unsuccessful. 
 
7.   a) Claimant G 
     b) 2000 
 
c) Claimant G operates an express courier delivery service 
worldwide, and asserts that the Government of Canada has 
allowed the Canadian Post system monopoly unfair advantages 
in its competition with private sector service providers. 
These advantages, Claimant G believes, take the form of 
monetary subsidies from non-courier services Canada Post 
provides, and discriminatory treatment by Canada customs. 
Claimant G has filed for arbitration alleging the Government 
of Canada breached its commitments under articles 1102, 1105, 
and 1502 of the NAFTA. 
 
Attorneys for Claimant G have briefed the Ambassador on their 
claim, and are in periodic communication with Embassy staff. 
They have let the Canadian government know that they are not 
averse to a non-judicial settlement of the claim through 
negotiations.  The Claimant has not put a sum on the amount 
of damages it claims due to Canadian government actions. 
 
In keeping with USG policy, the Embassy continues to monitor 
the case, but does not intervene with Canadian authorities 
while Chapter 11 dispute resolution measures are proceeding. 
 
8.  a) Claimant H 
    b) 1999 
 
c) Claimant H says he invested US$600,000 in prospecting for 
diamonds at a site 100 miles north of Yellowknife, Northwest 
Territories.  In early 1999 Claimant H says he requested the 
provincial Mining Recorders Office in Yellowknife to \"void\" a 
claim of a competing prospector because they \"overstaked\" on 
his property.  An official of the Recorders Office claims 
that the Claimant had exceeded his land use threshold, and 
had not applied for a land use permit.  Claimant was arrested 
as a squatter in February, 1999, detained two weeks, and 
deported to the United States for overstaying.  Provincial 
Mining office says Claimant made threats on the staff of the 
office.  In August 1999 the property of Claimant H was 
returned to him through Canada Customs. 
 
In July 2001 Claimant H sent a letter to the Embassy noting 
his claim, and in December 2001 he retransmitted the same 
information, also alleging that civic authorities conspired 
to kill him to prevent his claim to discovery and ownership 
of mineral deposits.  Claimant H contacted the Department in 
May, 2003 to let us know he is running for Congress and to 
refer us to his web site that features details of his claim.

1. (C) Canadian Foreign Minister Graham met with Iranian FM 
Kharazzi May 24 in Paris, and stressed Canada\'s strong 
concerns over the Iranian nuclear program.  Terry Wood, 
Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, said 
Graham told Kharazzi that Iran\'s May 6 presentation at the 
IAEA gave the impression that Iran was being unhelpful and 
non-transparent.  Graham gave Kharazzi a paper (faxed to 
NEA/NGA) urging Iranian cooperation with the IAEA and 
adoption of the additional protocol, and posing a number of 
questions about the Iranian program.  Kharazzi responded that 
the GoI was being as transparent as possible and would have 
no problem \"in principle\" signing the additional protocol, 
but that the additional protocol was controversial in Tehran. 
 Kharazzi gave Graham the same paper on Iranian \"Peaceful 
Nuclear Activities\" that he presented to Greek FM Papandreou 
(reftel) and others. 
 
2. (C) In addition to Graham\'s meeting with Kharazzi, Wood 
told us that senior Canadian officials have demarched Iranian 
counterparts three other times during the past two weeks. 
Deputy Foreign Minister Lavertu met with Iranian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Ahani (Europe and America) on May 24 in 
Tehran; Director General for International Security Jill 
Sinclair called in Iranian Ambassador Mousavi for a meeting 
on May 28 in Ottawa; and Canadian Ambassador McKinnon met 
with Iranian Director General Ziamaninia 
(Political/International Affairs) on May 18 in Tehran.  The 
Iranian MFA took three weeks before agreeing to the meeting 
with Ziamaninia. 
 
3. (C) The Iranian response in all meetings was that they are 
being open and doing nothing to violate their safeguards 
obligations.  But DG Ziamaninia admitted that they had not 
declared their heavy water enrichment facility sooner because 
they did not want to come under increased scrutiny. 
Ziamaninia said that Kharazzi and the head of the Iranian 
Atomic Energy Organization had been tasked to identify 
measures, including the additional protocol, that would 
address international concerns.  Deputy Minister Ahani 
repeated an Iranian offer, made after the El-Baradei visit to 
Tehran, to develop an action plan with the IAEA to 
demonstrate their cooperation and transparency. 
 
4. (C) The Iranian officials tried to portray the U.S. as the 
problem, calling the U.S. questions at the May 6 IAEA session 
\"sensational.\"  They told the Canadians that even if they 
were to sign the additional protocol, the U.S. would not be 
satisfied.  Ahani stressed that there was much debate over 
the additional protocol, including among National Assembly 
members, and that Iran would only sign the additional 
protocol if doing so would relieve international pressure. 
 
5. (C) ACTION REQUEST: Wood told us that Canada was eager to 
hear what our Iran strategy will be for the June 16 IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting, and then for the IAEA General 
Conference in September (including the possibility of a 
resolution).  Please advise.

FOR THE CURE 
 
 
Classified By: POL M/C BRIAN M. FLORA.  REASON 1.5 B and D. 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY. With the official launching in April of 
the leadership campaigns of Deputy PM John Manley and Liberal 
backbencher Paul Martin, the three-way contest to succeed PM 
Jean Chretien -- Canada\'s race for a political cure -- is 
officially on.  Though the Liberal Leadership convention is 
slated for November, observers believe that Martin,s victory 
will be sealed in September when the dozen or so delegates 
from each of 301 Liberal ridings across the country are 
announced.  The trick will be getting Chretien to quit before 
his announced date of February 2004 -- a daunting task -- in 
order to minimize the transition chaos.  Meanwhile, our 
meetings with Martin supporters and close advisors indicate a 
pragmatic leadership-in-waiting already engaged in damage 
control within the GOC and at work on a blueprint for 
U.S.-Canada relations. If Martin\'s May 1 foreign policy 
speech is any indication, under his leadership we can expect 
a positive change in Canada\'s handling of the bilateral 
agenda. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C/NF) A successful businessman and former Finance 
Minister, Paul Martin leads the three-way race in campaign 
funds, organization and name recognition. Discussions with a 
range of Martin supporters, from consultants to Members of 
Parliament, and Martin staffers, suggest that PM Chretien,s 
likely successor already has a quiet handle on the rudder of 
the Canadian ship of state.  Chretien\'s reputation as a 
gritty and tenacious politician notwithstanding, we 
understand that pro-Martin MPs dominate the Liberal Caucus 
and are poised to quash controversial \"legacy\" initiatives -- 
such as political party finance reform and, it appears, 
marijuana decriminalization -- that would undermine the new 
PM,s agenda.  Whether the Caucus and the Party can persuade 
Chretien to retire early -- for the sake of Party and Country 
-- is another question. 
 
3. (C/NF) In his first major foreign policy statement May 1, 
Martin painted a pragmatic and business-practical vision of 
\"Canada,s Role in a Complex World,\" identifying Canada,s 
relationship with the U.S. as a cornerstone of that role.  He 
pledged a \"systematic and coordinated effort to confirm and 
strengthen the Canada-US partnership,\" to include a permanent 
Cabinet Committee on Canada-US Relations chaired by the Prime 
Minister and a House of Commons Committee on Canada-US 
relations.  In the context of North American security, Martin 
called for development of a comprehensive national security 
policy for Canada, the only G-8 country without such a 
policy.  Though the very fact of articulating a \"vision\" 
would distinguish Martin from Chretien, the one-time Finance 
Minister and backbench challenger was also well spoken and 
thoughtful in his delivery. 
 
4. (C/NF) A key element of the Martin campaign strategy has 
been to emphasize the differences between Martin and the PM, 
in both style and content, and to portray a pro-active and 
pragmatic (as opposed to reactive and ambivalent) philosophy 
of governance.  The contrast could not be greater, or easier, 
to achieve:  While the PM pledges (non-existent) support for 
a UN intervention in the Congo, Martin offers to share 
federal gas tax revenues with Canada,s beleaguered, 
cash-hungry cities. Similarly, as Martin and his advisors 
focus on a blueprint to re-invigorate the US-Canada bilateral 
relationship (6 months ahead of the convention), Chretien 
seizes the international venue of the G-8 summit to sharply 
criticize the economic leadership of President Bush and boast 
about Canada,s economic success. Fortunately, if anecdotal 
evidence and media comments contain a shred of truth, so far 
the PM is not winning the PR battle. 
 
5. (C/NF) Veteran observers have speculated that the 
three-way leadership contest is a fig leaf to avoid the 
\"un-Canadian\" and \"un-Liberal\" appearance of a Martin 
coronation, and probably involves behind-the-scenes 
agreements among the PMO, the Liberal Party and the 
candidates themselves.  A retired former Canadian 
Ambassador-turned-consultant who claims to \"know\" Chretien 
says that such political arrangements are not unusual and 
would be desirable for the sake of image among the Canadian 
public. Deputy PM John Manley\'s stake in such an arrangement 
would be to develop his prospects for a post-Martin Prime 
Ministership (visibility, experience etc.) whereas Heritage 
Minister Sheila Copps\' likely reward might be a prestigious 
\"permanent\" (to age 75) appointment -- perhaps as Senator -- 
that would guarantee her income to retirement age and a 
generous government pension. Proponents of this theory point 
to the recent and unexpected retirement of a senior Senator 
-- at Chretien\'s \"request\"-- as paving the way for such 
rewards to loyalists. 
 
6. (C/NF) COMMENT:  With a majority of Liberal MPs (including 
Cabinet Ministers) openly in the Martin camp, as well as 
Liberal Party President Stephen LeDrew, the logical reality 
is that PM Chretien no longer controls the House Caucus. 
This could explain his bizarre anti-American public musings 
-- the only thing under his control, and with the added 
benefit of making PR mischief for the growing majority only 
too eager to push him out the door.  In this regard, we 
should not underestimate Chretien\'s capacity to manipulate 
the system if it serves his purpose, including to prorogue 
the Parliament until after the November election and/or 
sticking around as PM some three months after Paul Martin is 
elected Liberal Leader. At the same time, at least there is a 
light at the end of the tunnel. END COMMENT.

1. Classified by Economic Minister Counselor Michael 
Gallagher for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Transport Canada\'s Director of Security Jim Marriott 
confirmed that the Canadian Transportation Agency, the 
licensing arm of the Ministry, has suspended the license that 
had been issued in March to Air Canada for flights from 
Montreal to Beirut.  The reason for the suspension is 
\"national security.\"  Marriott said this was a \"victory\" for 
those concerned about aviation security. Marriott added that 
Canada will be watching very closely for signs of any 
rapproachment between the U.S. and Lebanon (and Syria); in 
particular, whether the USG changes its policy regarding 
flights by U.S. carriers into Beirut. 
 
2. (C) Bruce Levy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade (DFAIT) told us Transport Canada will 
certainly be asked: 1. what has changed since the license was 
issued in March? and, 2. what was the influence of the United 
States on this decision?  Levy said the first question will 
be very difficult to answer.  As for the second, Levy said he 
had recommended that, if asked, Transport Candada acknowledge 
that the USG had conveyed its views, but that the Canadian 
goverment made the decision independently.  Levy added that 
Air Canada has sold thousands of tickets for the Beirut 
flights already, primarily to Canada\'s large Lebanese 
community, so the decision to suspend the license for the 
flights will not be greeted with hosannas by everyone - 
especially as Air Canada is now in bankruptcy and needs 
revenue. 
 
3. (C) Air Canada representatives had no comment on the issue 
other than to say they expect to release a press announcement 
today. 
 
4. (C). Comment:  While we let Canada know our views on this 
issue very clearly at several levels, our approach has always 
been private and behind the scenes.  We strongly recommend 
that the Department and other agencies have minimal public 
comment on this.  Given Canadian sensitivities about U.S. 
pressure, undue focus on the U.S. role could complicate our 
future security efforts. End Comment.

1. Canada will support U.S positions on Agenda items 1.5 and 
1.24 at the World Radiocommunication Conference.  According 
to Industry Canada\'s Director for Terrestrial Engineering 
Doug Sward, Canada has been on board with these two issues 
throughout their preparations for the Conference.  Sward will

Bob McCaughern, who is already in Geneva, at the WRC. 
 
2. Despite their support, Sward stated that the GOC did not 
agree with the U.S. suggestion that technical and operating 
restrictions on the mobile devices used in wireless access 
systems proposed in Agenda item 1.5 would protect radar 
operations and systems in the earth exploration satellite 
service.  A Canadian study, which is supported by results 
from the EU, indicates that the restrictions would protect 
air, maritime and ground-based radar, but would only 
mitigate, and not fully protect, radar systems in the earth 
exploration satellite services.  Sward noted that this was 
not a major point since other criteria will protect earth 
exploration satellites, but one that he thought deserved 
clarification.

G8 
1.   \"We\'d be better off with the G-Zero.\" 
Columnist William Watson noted in the conservative 
English-language daily the Montreal Gazette (6/3): \"The 
big news story in France yesterday was the 
length of the handshake on Sunday when Jacques Chirac 
welcomed George W. Bush to the G8 summit. The French 
press considered it too short, even if it was followed 
a little later by a friendly pat on the back from Mr. 
Bush - a pat on the back with no concealed weapon, 
unlike the backstabbing the Americans feel  Mr. Chirac 
gave them over Iraq.... Whether in handshakes or 
meetings, Bush\'s preference is clearly for brevity. 
Thus he left the G8 sessions yesterday afternoon, just 
halfway through the agenda. This was widely regarded as 
a snub to Chirac, which it probably was, but it\'s also 
consistent with Bush\'s well-known impatience with 
talkfests. Loquacious Bill Clinton would have loved 48 
hours of meetings. Taciturn George W. Bush evidently 
did not.... With the U.S. skipping half the meeting, 
this year the G8 was the G7.5. It\'s a step in the right 
direction. If more members could be persuaded to do the 
same, we might eventually get down to the G-0. It\'s 
hard to believe the world would be worse.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
2.   \"Bush puts his prestige on the line\" 
Editorial writer David Warren commented in the 
conservative National Post and the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen (6/4): \"...Those who do not grasp by now 
that the President means what he says may be fairly 
dismissed as impenetrable. Such commentators exist on 
both left and right, and indeed both ends of the 
political spectrum seem now to be convinced that Mr. 
Bush is, with Ariel Sharon in carriage, purposely 
advancing a `road map\' so little different from the old 
failed Oslo process that he must be expecting 
it to fail, leaving Israel free, when it does, to 
settle matters by force. This is, however, a complete 
misreading of Mr. Bush. He may be foolish, but 
he is not cynical. He has put his money where his mouth 
was a sufficient number of consecutive times, and been 
sufficiently transparent about his intentions, to be 
relieved of the latter charge.... Notwithstanding, Mr. 
Bush is putting the credibility of the United States, 
and his own prestige, on the line. He is banking on the 
new leverage the United States has as a regional power 
in its own right - it has occupied Iraq - and on the 
cumulative effect of the trauma in the Arab world of 
watching Saddam 
Hussein\'s statue come down, and absorbing that 
occupation.... Israel most certainly risks getting 
burned, for the peace Mr. Bush seeks is regional not 
local.... This is a Herculean task: cleaning the Augean 
stables, changing the very nature of Arab politics. Mr. 
Bush believes it cannot be avoided, 
and he is right in the middle of it now.\" 
 
3.   \"New credo\" 
Jean-Marc Salvet, chief editorialist at the centrist Le 
Soleil, wrote (6/4): \"Many pundits were wrong in 
believing George W. Bush would shy away from the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.... The world\'s first 
power has accepted the idea that a firm commitment on 
its part would increase the chances of reaching a 
political settlement in the Mid-East.... Nothing better 
illustrates the new American determination than the 
Aqaba summit where the Israeli and Palestinian prime 
ministers will meet President Bush.... The agreements 
in principle obtained so far are important but fragile. 
That is why Washington must see to it that the Road Map 
is applied and that its interlocutors do not deviate 
from it.\" 
 
IRAQ 
4.   \"A just war regardless\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Whether WMDs are found or not, 
the allies need offer no apologies for liberating 
Iraq,\" the conservative National Post opined 
(6/4): \"...As Mr. Bush himself has plainly admitted, 
the war was always about more than WMDs. It was about 
creating a new political environment in the Middle 
East, destroying the cult of militant Arabism that kept 
the Palestinian-Israeli conflict simmering, 
extinguishing a possible nexus between rogue power and 
terrorism; and, perhaps, in the long term, 
democratizing the Arab world. Given that these are 
large, ambitious projects, the U.S. and British leaders 
would have had a difficult time using them as an 
explicit basis to justify war. Thus the two  government 
focused, perhaps overly so, on the threat of WMDs and 
links to al-Qaeda - which are simpler, more tangible 
themes. But over time, as the larger benefits of Iraq\'s 
liberation unfold, we are confident the paucity of WMDs 
found in the country will come to be regarded in the 
West as an insignificant footnote to the region\'s 
history - much as it already is to the many ordinary 
Iraqis freed of Saddam\'s tyranny.\" 
 
U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY 
5.   \"U.S. manufacturing could rescue Canada.\" 
Columnist Jay Bryan observed in the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen (6/3): \"It\'s an obscure number, and much of the 
time justifiably so, but when the U.S. is faltering in 
its job as global economic locomotive, the Institute 
for Supply Management\'s measure of manufacturing 
health, best known as the ISM index, 
can become a critically important indicator of where 
the economy is going.... As the Canadian economy 
staggers under the weight of Toronto\'s SARS episode, 
Alberta\'s mad cow scare and a darkening domestic 
economic landscape, the importance of exports to the 
U.S. has become critical.... That\'s why the apparent 
revival in U.S. manufacturing couldn\'t be more 
welcome. Since Canada\'s rising interest rates and 
dollar are acting to squeeze our still-robust growth 
rate, a reviving U.S. economy is our best hope for a 
healthy economy this time next year.\"

SUBJECT: CANADA CUSTOMS\' DUMPING INVESTIGATION COULD IMPACT 
U.S. STEEL EXPORTERS, BUT NOT MANUFACTURERS 
 
 
1. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA) has initiated an 
investigation into the alleged injurious dumping of steel 
structural tubing, known as hollow structural sections, 
originating in, or exported from Korea, South Africa and 
Turkey.  The investigation covers hollow structural sections 
made of carbon and alloy steel, welded, in sizes up to and 
including 16 inches in outside diameter for round products 
and up to and including 48 inches in periphery for 
rectangular and square products.  Although the investigation 
does not include U.S. manufacturers, CCRA has informed post 
that some of the goods subject to the investigation have been 
sold to importers in Canada by exporters located in the U.S. 
A complete list of the U.S. exporters is provided in 
paragraph four. 
 
2. Three Canadian Manufacturers filed a complaint alleging 
that the dumping of steel structural tubing has caused or is 
threatening to cause injury to the companies\' production of 
hollow structural section in Canada.  According to figures 
contained in the complaint, imports from Korea, South Africa 
and Turkey rose from approximately 8,800 tonnes in 2001 to 
approximately 32,000 tonnes in 2002.  CCRA will conduct an 
investigation to determine whether the subject goods imported 
into Canada during the period of April 1, 2002, to March 31, 
2003, have been dumped.  The Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal (CITT) will conduct a preliminary inquiry to 
determine if there is evidence that discloses a reasonable 
indication that the dumping has caused or is threatening to 
cause injury to the Canadian industry.  Details on the 
investigation can be found at by clicking on \"Statements of 
Reasons\" at www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/sima. 
 
3. From customs import documentation, the CCRA has identified 
24 exporters of the subject goods, ten of which are based in 
the U.S.  As a part of the investigation, CCRA has requested 
information from exporters to determine the normal value and 
the export price of the goods shipped to Canada.  Exporters 
have until June 29, 2002 to respond to CCRA\'s request for 
information.  CCRA\'s manager for the Industrial Products 
Division Jim Gove told econoff that a failure to respond to 
CCRA\'s request for information will lead to a likely less 
favorable Anti-dumping determination than companies which 
provide detailed information.  According to Gove, U.S. 
exporters are not the major exporters of hollow structural 
sections to Canada.  Sales figures from U.S. companies 
indicate exports to Canada are sideline operations of 
businesses that are primarily focused on the U.S. market. 
Because of this, Gove did not expect many of the U.S. 
exporters to provide the requested information. 
 
4. U.S. Exporters of structural tubing from the U.S. to 
Canada include:

Washington, 98032

SUBJECT: CANADA PROVINCIAL ELECTION: MANITOBA RE-ELECTS NEW 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (NDP) 
 
Ref: Ottawa 01325 
 
THIS MESSAGE IS A PRODUCT OF APP WINNIPEG. 
 
1. SUMMARY.  As expected, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer and his 
left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) won a second 
majority government in the June 3 elections. The Manitoba 
NDP is a strong proponent of the Canadian Wheat Board 
monopoly and a driving force behind Canadian opposition to 
U.S. proposals to alleviate flooding of North Dakota\'s 
Devils Lake.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------ 
No Major Campaign Issues 
------------------------ 
 
2.  The campaign featured no major issues and registered 
relatively little enthusiasm among the Manitoba electorate. 
Though voter turnout dipped to 55 percent (the norm is 69 
percent), observers of Manitoba politics say the \"low\" 
turnout is a sign of satisfaction with the status quo. 
Aided by a strong economy and low unemployment rate, the 
ruling NDP gained 3 new seats in the Legislature. 
Preliminary results showed the NDP winning 49 percent of the 
popular vote (vs. 44 percent in 1999).  With 20 seats and 36 
percent of the vote, the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party 
will remain the official Opposition party. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
No Change for U.S. Interests 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  We expect little change for U.S. interests in Manitoba 
under the second Doer government.  Manitoba will continue to 
be a driving force behind Canadian opposition to inter-basin 
water transfers (Devils Lake, NAWS, etc.) and support for 
the Canadian Wheat Board headquartered in Winnipeg.  At the 
same time, Gary Doer places a premium on Manitoba\'s 
relationship with the United States, which is the 
destination for nearly 80% of Manitoba\'s exports.  He has 
been successful in quashing some of the anti-American 
rhetoric within the provincial party, and was visibly absent 
earlier this year when some of his Cabinet and Caucus joined 
protests opposing U.S. military action in Iraq.  Rarely is 
the blatant anti-Americanism of the federal NDP publicly 
manifested in Manitoba\'s NDP, though the sentiment is 
present. 
 
4.  The Premier enjoys close personal relations with 
Ambassador Cellucci and the leaders of several states 
(Minnesota, Missouri, Texas, South Dakota).  He will press 
ahead with further development of Manitoba hydroelectricity 
generation potential, and actively solicit U.S. markets for 
surplus hydroelectricity. 
 
5. COMMENT.  The NDP conducted a cautious campaign.  In 
resisting some pressure to adopt a more \"leftist\" agenda, 
the party was able to hold greater appeal for the middle- 
class suburban voters that tend to decide Manitoba 
elections.  Premier Doer\'s personal popularity and his image 
as a centrist politician were key factors in enabling the 
NDP to steal three suburban Winnipeg seats from Conservative 
incumbents, as well as one open Conservative seat.  Though 
the NDP made province-wide gains in the popular vote, 
however, it failed to make any significant breakthrough into 
the PC\'s rural base.

1. As of June 9, 2003, Health Canada has received 
reports of 424 probable or suspect cases of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada.  There 
have been 33 deaths in Canada.  Canadian officials 
maintain that to date, transmission has been limited to 
specific transmission settings such as households, 
hospitals and specific community settings.  Health 
Canada has provided the following figures, accurate as 
of 13:00 EDT June 9, 2003: 
2. The epicenter for SARS cases remains Toronto, 
Ontario with 225 probable (66 active) and 136 suspect 
(9 active) cases. See Toronto reporting for more 
detail. 
3. There are no active cases in the remainder of the 
country. 
4. British Columbia is reporting 4 probable (0 active) 
and 46 suspect (0 active) cases. Representing a net 
reduction of 8 suspect cases since the last Canada-wide 
update April 25th. 
5. Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect (0 active) case. 
No change since the Canada-wide update of April 25th. 
6. New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases (0 
active).  No change since the Canada-wide update of 
April 25th. 
7. Alberta is reporting 6 suspect cases (0 active). No 
change since April 26th (representing a net increase of 
1 suspect case since our April 25th report). 
8. Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases (0 
active).  No change since the Canada-wide update of 
April 25th. 
9. No reported cases of SARS in Quebec, Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia, Quebec, Manitoba, Nunavut, Yukon or 
Northwest Territories. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Health Canada broadens case definition for SARS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10. On May 29, Health Canada announced that Canada is 
aligning its clinical description of symptoms and signs 
of SARS with that of the WHO. 
 
11. The previous definition of \"severe progressive 
respiratory illness suggestive of atypical pneumonia or 
acute respiratory syndrome (RDS) with no known cause\" 
has been replaced with: \"radiographic evidence in 
infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or respiratory 
distress syndrome on chest x-ray with no known cause 
that can fully explain the illness.\" 
 
12. According to Health Canada, the revised case 
definition for probable and suspect cases will not make 
a difference in the way cases are treated nor how cases 
are identified.  Cases that are suspect or under 
investigation have always required appropriate 
treatment or attention. 
 
13. The WHO and provincial and territorial officials 
have been apprised of the new definition.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) While NATO is assuming the lead for ISAF, Canada will 
join Germany as one of the two largest troop contributors 
beginning in August.  Canada will be providing two rotations 
of 1,800 personnel each for ISAF IV and V.  While Canada will 
not back away from this commitment, it is expressing concern 
about the security situation in Afghanistan and the lack of 
political progress made by the Karzai Government.  Before its 
main ISAF deployment gets underway, Canada is also making 
small military contributions in Iraq and Congo, using CC130 
aircraft to transport U.S. military personnel into Iraq and 
French military personnel into Congo.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
AFGHANISTAN 
----------- 
 
2. (C) Canada is proceeding with preparations for the 
infantry battle group and brigade staff headquarters it will 
be contributing to ISAF IV and V (ref. A).  There are 
currently 150 Canadian Forces (CF) personnel in Kabul laying 
the groundwork, and the bulk of the CF deployment will take 
place starting in late July.  CF MGEN Andrew Leslie will be 
the Deputy Commander in ISAF headquarters, and will be joined 
there by 15-20 other CF personnel.  CF BGEN Peter Devlin will 
be Commander of the Kabul Multinational Brigade. 
 
3. (C) Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and National Defense (DND) 
contacts tell us that beyond the announced ISAF mission in 
Kabul, Canada is looking at potential CF participation in 
Provincial Reconstruction Teams.  One of the factors they are 
assessing is security, particularly after the recent killing 
of 4 German soldiers.  Canada prefers that the three missions 
going on concurrently in Afghanistan - Operation Enduring 
Freedom, NATO/ISAF, and UN - be brought together.  Canadian 
Defense Minister McCallum will be visiting Kabul June 23-24, 
and Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah will be visiting Ottawa 
in August.  Canada has also announced that it is opening an 
Embassy in Afghanistan, which should be \"fully operational\" 
by summer 2004.  Canada\'s diplomatic efforts in Kabul are 
currently being handled by TDY personnel from Islamabad. 
 
4. (C) While Canada will follow through on its ISAF 
commitments, Foreign Minister Graham told reporters on June 
10 that \"the anarchy in Afghanistan is clearly a serious 
concern for us.\"  Our DFAIT contacts noted UN SRSG Brahimi\'s 
recent message in Paris, where he said that the Karzai 
Government is repeating the mistakes of the early 1990s, 
potentially enabling the Taliban to re-establish itself. 
DFAIT expressed concern about the Government\'s inability to 
be more inclusive, about following through on the elections 
timetable, and about what would happen if Karzai was killed. 
 
----------- 
IRAQ, CONGO 
----------- 
 
5. (C) Prior to its main ISAF deployment, Canada is also 
making small military contributions in Iraq (ref. A) and the 
Congo.  Canada is using four CC-130 Hercules transport 
aircraft based in the UAE, which previously had been 
dedicated to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  On June 2 and 
8, the CC130s were used to transport U.S. military personnel 
and equipment from Kuwait into Iraq.  On June 9, two of the 
CC130s were deployed to Entebbe, Uganda, where they are being 
used to transport French troops into Bunia, Congo.  Canada 
will devote the two CC-130s to the Congo mission until July 
7, when they will return to the UAE to support the ISAF 
deployment.  Canada will send a fifth CC-130 into theater in 
July to help with the ISAF deployment surge. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (C) The Canadian Government continues to step up to the 
plate in Afghanistan, where it has made significant military 
contributions under OEF and has disbursed US$86 million in 
humanitarian assistance (another US$185 million has been 
committed over the next 2 years).  In Iraq, Canada refused to 
join our military coalition but is providing humanitarian 
assistance, using both military and civilian assets.  Canada 
participated with us in a recent police/judiciary assessment 
team visit to Iraq, and we expect RCMP officers to be 
deployed as part of this effort.  In Congo, Canada\'s military 
contribution is in keeping with Prime Minister Chretien\'s 
push in the G-8 for greater responsiveness to African crises. 
 All of these efforts continue to strain the underfunded 
Canadian military, which will have 9% of all available combat 
troops deployed overseas by August.

3. (C) Chouinard didn\'t close the door completely, however. 
He said Canada believes in the principle of rotating Board 
seats, and feels Group 1 membership should be better balanced 
between EU and non-EU states. He believes there is merit to a 
rotation scheme over the long-term, as long as others are

establish such a scheme. (Comment: Chouinard was clear that 
Canada wants to rejoin the UNESCO board this year while 
remaining open to the idea of a slate and a long-term 
rotation scheme.  It is unlikely Canada will agree to a slate 
for this year\'s election unless it is part of that slate. End

pledged $250 million over the next two calendar years for 
rural development, natural resources management, security and 
the rule of law, as well as budget support for TISA (Ref A). 
The just-announced C$15 million in operational support 
through the ARTF for the current year is in addition to the 
C$23.5 million anounced in Brussels.  Counting the C$19 
million provided last year, Canada has contributed C$57.5 
million to TISA\'s operating budget. 
 
3.  The GOC also announced allocations of C$5 million to the 
UN Mine Action Program for Afghanistan, and C$1.2 million to 
support civil-military cooperation projects. 
 
Plans for FY04 aid

NOTE NO: 52/03 
 
     The High Commission of the Republic of Trinidad and 
Tobago presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United 
States of America and has the honour to inform the latter 
that the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago 
has announced its interest in hosting the Permanent 
Headquarters of the Secretariat of the Free Trade Area of the 
Americas (FTAA). 
 
     Situated midway between North and South America, 
Trinidad and Tobago\'s strategic position at the convergence 
of the Caribbean, South and Central America, makes the 
country an ideal location for the FTAA Secretariat.  Trinidad 
and Tobago also boasts a socially and culturally diverse 
society complemented by a stable democracy, a safe and secure 
environment, modern infrastructure and a dynamic business 
climate. 
 
     Trinidad and Tobago maintains one of the highest 
standards of living in the region.  The low cost of 
utilities, transportation, food and leisure combine to make 
executive living standards highly competitive when compared 
with other major metropolitan centers within the hemisphere. 
 
     The Trinidad and Tobago bid has been endorsed by all 
member States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). 
 
     The High Commission of the Republic of Trinidad and 
Tobago wishes to request the valuable support of the 
Government of the United States of America in its bid to host 
the Permanent Headquarters of the Secretariat of the FTAA. 
 
     The High Commission of the Republic of Trinidad and 
Tobago avails itself of thsi opportunity to renew to the 
Embassy of the United States of America the assurances of its 
highest consideration.

Summary and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
1. This cable contains an action request (para.9). 
 
2. ESTH Counselor and ESTH Specialist called on Ed 
Aiston, Director General for International Affairs, and 
Martin Methot, his deputy, in the Canadian Health 
Ministry to discuss the President\'s AIDS initiative. 
Aiston said the Canadian Government is very pleased 
with the new USG funding to fight HIV/AIDS, and he 
praised the leadership shown by the U.S. on this issue. 
Aiston and Methot asked whether the new AIDS/HIV funds 
will have any conditions on their disbursement, such as 
a requirement for matching funds from host governments 
or other sources.  Canadian financial commitments to 
the global fight against AIDS/HIV amount to C$470 
million (about US$347 million) between 2000 and 2005. 
The Canadian federal budget of February 2003 indicates 
an 8 percent increase in the International Assistance 
budget, and it is likely that AIDS/HIV funding will 
receive a boost over the coming few years from this 
source.  Aiston said that Secretary Thompson\'s 
announcement of the new AIDS funding at the recent 
World Health Assembly, along with the surprise USG 
support for the adoption of the Framework Convention on 
Tobacco Control, set the right tone for the recent 
World Health Assembly and contributed significantly to 
its success.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Canadians very pleased with USG AIDS Initiatives 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. Ed Aiston, Director General of International Affairs 
at Health Canada was effusive in his praise for the new 
USG funding initiative signed into law by the President 
on May 27th.  Aiston noted that Secretary Thompson\'s 
announcement of the new funds, made at the World Health 
Assembly (WHA) in Geneva, was \"very, very, very well- 
received\". 
 
4. Aiston, along with Martin Methot, Director of the 
International Health Division at Health Canada posed 
some questions to the EST Counselor and ESTH Specialist 
regarding the new funds.  Specifically, Aiston and 
Methot inquired whether USG funding for AIDS programs 
will require matching funds from other donors or 
whether any other conditions may apply.  Methot also 
asked whether U.S. programs for AIDS included funds for 
development of an AIDS vaccine.  Post would appreciate 
any clarification that WASHDC agencies could provide on 
these two questions.  See para.8. 
 
5. Aiston took the opportunity of the meeting with 
Emboffs, to note that Secretary Thompson\'s support for 
the adoption of the FCTC was extremely well-received by 
the assembled Health Ministers at the WHA.  He praised 
the Secretary\'s actions as a very strong example of 
leadership, which generated enormous goodwill and 
helped create a very positive tone for the Assembly. 
Aiston remarked also that Secretary Thompson\'s 
statement on the need for a strong and robust Global 
Public Health Surveillance system was an idea that was 
very well received at the WHA, and that Canada is eager 
to learn more detail about this proposal. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Canadian Funding for Global fight against AIDS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. In the global fight against AIDS, Canada\'s 
contribution, on a per capita basis, is significant. 
Between 2000 and 2005 the GoC will invest C$270 million 
(about US$198 million) in the global fight against 
AIDS, via the Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA), the Canadian equivalent of USAID.  CIDA 
programs focus on working with community groups and 
local organizations to provide reproductive health 
services, training, education and counseling.  (CIDA 
often contracts with Health Canada to execute their 
programs, especially those involving capacity building 
because Health Canada has 75 to 100 staff members with 
clinical and public health expertise pertaining to 
HIV/AIDS, whereas CIDA has only a small policy planning 
staff managing the AIDS/HIV file.)  Methot told Embassy 
officers that Canadian AIDS funds support programs in 
India, China, Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and 
the Caribbean. 
 
7. In addition, Canada has committed C$150 million 
(about US$110 million) to the Global Fund to fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.  The GoC has also 
committed C$50 million (about US$37 million) to the 
International AIDS Vaccine Initiative.  Canadian funds 
have been used to build labs in Kenya and Uganda, with 
additional labs planned for Rwanda, Zambia and 
Cameroon. 
 
8. Aiston noted to Emboffs that the GoC Budget of 
February 18th, 2003 indicated that the federal 
government plans to increases Canada\'s International 
Assistance budget by 8 per cent in FY2003-2004 and 
again in FY 2004-05, this translates into an increase 
of C$1.4 billion (about US$1 billion).  Aiston 
anticipates that the GOC\'s AIDS funding will be 
augmented as a result, but no details are yet 
available.  Emboffs will be meeting with officials from 
CIDA on June 19 to discuss CIDA\'s role in GoC AIDS/HIV 
activities, and will seek their views on how much of 
the new International Assistance funding will be 
directed toward AIDS/HIV programs. 
 
-------------- 
Action Request 
-------------- 
 
9. Action request: Post would appreciate clarification 
on whether under the President\'s initiative on AIDS, 
the U.S. will require matching funds from other donors 
or whether any other forms of conditionality may apply 
to disbursement of the funds.  Canadian officials are 
also interested in knowing to what extent the U.S. 
provides funding for the AIDS vaccine initiative. 
Response may be sent by email to ESTH Counselor Curt 
Stone at stonec@state.gov or to ESTH Specialist 
Locklear at locklearl@state.gov.

(BOG) meeting (ref. A).  Despite the Canadian delegation\'s 
skepticism in Vienna that such a resolution will be 
attainable (ref. B), Lavertu said Canada will be with us. 
Should a resolution prove impossible, he continued, Canada 
will work with us on an alternative, unambiguous message from 
the BOG meeting.  Lavertu said that in addition to the tough 
messages he and Foreign Minister Graham delivered to their 
Iranian counterparts in Tehran and Paris, respectively (ref. 
C), he met with the Iranian Ambassador in Ottawa after the 
June 6 release of the IAEA report.  Lavertu reiterated 
Canada\'s strong concerns, and told the Ambassador that it was 
most unusual for a preliminary IAEA report to be so strongly 
worded. 
 
2. (C) Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for 
Nonproliferation, told us the Canadian Embassy in Tehran 
attended AEOI President Aghazadeh\'s June 9 briefing in Tehran 
(ref. B), and that there were a number of factual errors in 
Aghazadeh\'s presentation.  Wood said Aghazadeh downplayed 
Iran\'s non-declarations as insignificant oversights, and 
described an additional protocol as \"no big deal\" because 
only two countries with significant nuclear programs have 
signed one thus far.  Agazadeh warned that if the pressure 
continues, Iran will limit its cooperation with the IAEA. 
 
3. (C) Wood said that Canada is preparing a robust 
intervention for the BOG meeting.  He underscored Canada\'s 
particular concern about the \"Kalaye Electric\" site, saying 
that Canada had an intelligence source in the late 1990s who 
made them aware of nuclear activity there.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTS: PARLIAMENTARY 
COMMITTEE POSTPONES DECISION TO AMEND REGULATIONS 
 
1. Summary ) A Parliamentary committee has postponed a 
decision to recommend changes to Canada,s drug patent rules 
that cover the process for bringing generic drugs to the 
market once the innovator,s patents expire.  The Canadian 
review mirrors the recent U.S. deliberations on the 
Hatch-Waxman law that led to a June 12 decision by the FDA to 
streamline the process for bringing generics to the market. 
The committee,s decision to delay a recommendation for 
possible regulatory change before the end of the current 
Parliamentary session is seen as a temporary victory for the 
brand-name pharmaceutical companies that oppose any 
legislative changes.  End Summary. 
 
2. After four days of testimony, the House Industry and 
Science committee postponed a decision to recommend reform of 
Canada,s drug patent rules until Parliament reconvenes in 
the fall.  The committee reviewed the Patented Medicine 
Notice of Compliance (NOC) Regulations, which are also known 
as the &linkage regulations8 because these rules link the 
regulatory approval of a generic drug to the patent status of 
the drug it seeks to copy.  A similar review of the 
Hatch-Waxman law in the U.S. led to the recent FDA decision, 
announced by President Bush on June 12, to institute new 
regulations to streamline the process for bringing generic 
drugs to the market. 
 
3. The linkage regulations, which were last amended in 1998, 
block Health Canada from approving a generic drug for up to 
two years if there is any allegation of patent infringement. 
Generic companies complained that by filing sequential 
patents on minor improvements on a drug and then alleging 
infringement on each, brand-name companies can \"evergreen8 
the market for a drug long after its original 20-year patent 
expires.  The generics proposed scrapping the automatic 
24-month injunction altogether.  The brand-name manufacturers 
encouraged the committee to maintain the status quo, arguing 
that the automatic injunction is necessary to prevent patent 
infringement and encourage the development of new drugs. 
Canada and the U.S. are the only countries that provide an 
automatic injunction in cases of alleged patent infringement. 
 
 
4. The recent high profile review of the Canadian health care 
system by Roy Romanov, which was released last fall, 
recommended that the GOC consider overhauling the Notice of 
Compliance regulations.  Health Canada, which administers the 
regulations, generally agreed with this recommendation, 
testifying to the committee that the growing complexity of 
patents has made it difficult for them to administer the NOC 
regulations.  Industry Canada, on the other hand, argued 
against changes to the regulations, noting that they are 
necessary to protect and promote incremental innovation by 
brand-name companies.  The Parliamentary committee was evenly 
divided on the issue and determined that they needed more 
information before deciding on whether or not to amend the 
regulations. 
 
5. Comment ) Failure to reach a decision is a victory for 
the brand-name drug companies, who had hoped to avoid the 
Parliamentary review of the regulations altogether.  With the 
upcoming Canadian elections it is not clear when or if the 
committee will reconvene to make a final decision on whether 
or not the regulations will be amended.  Although Canada,s 
patent regime is generally considered more pro-generic than 
the U.S. system, even after the recent decision by the FDA, 
the perception that the U.S. is taking action to &lower the 
costs8 of prescription medications could motivate the 
committee to recommend changes to the linkage regulations.

INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THE IPHE, BUT HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IPHE WILL RELATE TO THE IEA\'S 
HYDROGEN COORDINATION GROUP.  THEY ALSO POSED NUMEROUS 
QUESTIONS ABOUT IPHE\'S POSSIBLE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS - SEE 
ACTION REQUESTED, PARAGRAPH 7.  THIS INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE 
SOME SELLING AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL, AND TO THIS END WE URGE 
WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO CONSIDER VISITS TO OTTAWA BY SENIOR 
OFFICIALS FROM DOE AND STATE TO PROMOTE THE IPHE.    END 
SUMMARY 
 
2.    EMBASSY ESTH COUNSELOR AND ENERGY SPECIALIST DISCUSSED 
THE USG\'S PROPOSAL FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR THE 
HYDROGEN ECONOMY (IPHE) WITH KEY OFFICIALS AT NATURAL 
RESOURCES CANADA (NRCAN) ON JUNE 16.  NRCAN PERSONNEL WERE 
FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPOSAL:  ALL HAD SEEN THE INFORMATION 
PROVIDED IN REFTEL A, SOME HAD HEARD SECRETARY ABRAHAM\'S 
INVITATION AT THE IEA MINISTERIAL IN APRIL, AND OTHERS HAD 
SEEN A PRESENTATION BY DOE\'S CHRIS BORDEAUX AT THE MOST 
RECENT MEETING OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EXPERTS UNDER THE 
NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY WORKING GROUP IN OTTAWA ON JUNE 5. 
 
3.   CANADIAN OFFICIALS\' MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WITH 
RESPECT TO IPHE PERTAINED TO ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE IEA\'S 
HYDROGEN COORDINATION GROUP (REF B).  NOTING THAT THE WORK 
BEING PURSUED IN THAT FORUM IS SUBSTANTIVE AND IS ALREADY 
WELL UNDERWAY, THEY EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE IPHE 
INITIATIVE WOULD DUPLICATE WHAT WAS ALREADY BEING DONE IN 
THE IEA CONTEXT AND/OR THAT IT WOULD SPREAD THE GOC\'S 
AVAILABLE RESOURCES TOO THIN.  IN ADDITION, NRCAN OFFICIALS 
RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE IPHE PROCESS WOULD RELATE TO 
IEA EFFORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEROPERABLE CODES AND 
STANDARDS. 
 
4.   CANADIAN OFFICIALS INQUIRED BRIEFLY ABOUT SECRETARY 
ABRAHAM\'S EFFORT TO PROMOTE THE IPHE AMONG PROSPECTIVE 
MEMBERS DURING VISITS TO THEIR CAPITALS.  (COMMENT:  THE 
FACT THAT SECRETARY ABRAHAM HAS PROMOTED THE IPHE DIRECTLY 
WITH THE EU AND OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, BUT HAS NOT DONE 
SO WITH CANADA, MAKES THIS A SENSITIVE TOPIC IN OTTAWA.  END 
COMMENT). 
 
5.   OUR INTERLOCUTORS WERE INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBLE 
FORMAT OF THE PROSPECTIVE MEETING TO LAUNCH THE IPHE IN FALL 
2003.  THEY RECOMMENDED STRONGLY THAT WE NOT TRY TO HOLD 
MEETINGS AT THE POLICY AND TECHNICAL LEVELS SIMULTANEOUSLY 
(CITING THE CASE OF THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION LEADERSHIP 
FORUM), BUT RATHER THAT WE PUT POLICY ISSUES FIRST AND THEN 
DEAL SEPARATELY WITH STRUCTURAL AND TECHNICAL MATTERS. 
 
6.   OTHER ISSUES IN WHICH NRCAN SHOWED INTEREST INCLUDED: 
 
-- THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE IPHE\'S TIME FRAMES (I.E. IS IT 
REALISTIC TO MAKE HYDROGEN THE \"TRANSPORTATION FUEL OF 
CHOICE\" BY 2020?); 
 
-- WHETHER INDIA AND CHINA WERE LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE; 
 
-- HOW THE IPHE SECRETARIAT WOULD BE STRUCTURED AND WHERE IT 
MIGHT BE LOCATED; 
 
-- HOW INDUSTRY/PRIVATE SECTOR GROUPS WOULD BE INVOLVED IN 
THE PARTNERSHIP; 
 
-- HOW WILL IPR ISSUES BE HANDLED; 
 
-- WHETHER U.S. STATES AND/OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE INVOLVED 
IN THE PARTNERSHIP (NRCAN UNDERSTANDS THAT CALIFORNIA AND 
OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE ON HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL 
DEVELOPMENT); 
 
-- WHETHER THE IPHE WILL ENGAGE IN ACTUAL PROJECTS, OR JUST 
BE A FORUM FOR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION; AND 
 
-- HOW IPHE MIGHT CONNECT TO CSLF. 
7. ACTION REQUESTED:  BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS THUS FAR, IT 
IS CLEAR THAT THE GOC IS INTERESTED IN THE IPHE AND GIVING 
IT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. HOWEVER, OFFICIALS ARE ALSO 
CONCERNED ABOUT ORGANIZATIONAL DETAILS AND ABOUT THE 
POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS NEW PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE FOR 
EXISTING BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL (PARTICULARLY IEA) 
COOPERATION ON HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES AND FUEL CELLS.

PARTICULARLY SINCE IT INVOLVED ONLY ONE AGENCY OF THE 
SEVERAL IN THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD PRESUMABLY 
PLAY A ROLE IN DECIDING ON CANADIAN PARTICIPATION.  THE U.S. 
PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP HAS RAISED A 
NUMBER OF BASIC QUESTIONS THAT THE GOC WILL HAVE TO WRESTLE 
WITH AS THEY CONSIDER HOW TO RESPOND.  ANY ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION THAT WASHINGTON AGENCIES MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE 
TO US WILL BE USEFUL IN ENGAGING NRCAN AND OTHER CANADIAN 
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ON THE IPHE PROPOSAL.  FINALLY, BEYOND 
ALL THE TECHNICAL AND BUREAUCRATIC ISSUES THAT WE HAVE 
ENCOUNTERED IN OUR INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WITH GOC OFFICIALS, 
THERE IS A NEED TO SELL THE CONCEPT AT THE POLITICAL LEVEL 
IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ENGAGING CANADA IN THE IPHE.  THAT 
IS AN EFFORT THAT WE EXPECT THE AMBASSADOR TO BE FULLY 
INVOLVED IN, ONCE WE HAVE THE INFORMATION TO RESPOND TO SOME 
OF THE BASIC ISSUES RAISED ABOVE.  HOWEVER, WE WOULD ALSO 
URGE WASHINGTON AGENCIES TO CONSIDER VISITS TO OTTAWA BY 
SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM DOE AND STATE TO PROMOTE THE IPHE.

------------------- 
SUMMARY AND COMMENT 
------------------- 
 
1. (C) Peter Harder, Canada\'s new Deputy Foreign Minister, 
met with Ambassador Cellucci on June 17 to discuss the 
bilateral relationship and his June 19-20 visit to 
Washington.  Harder and the Ambassador discussed management 
of the relationship, energy cooperation, missile defense, the 
ICC, the Trafficking in Persons report, and the Proliferation 
Security Initiative.  Harder\'s appointment is part of an 
effort, led by Privy Council Clerk Alex Himelfarb (a close 
friend of Harder\'s), to get U.S.-Canada relations on a better 
footing.  We expect Harder to be more pragmatic in his 
approach to the relationship than is usually the case at 
Foreign Affairs.  As Deputy Minister at Industry Canada (his 
previous post), Harder told his staff that the biggest 
priority for Canada is how it can exist and prosper in \"this 
North American space.\"  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
---------------------- 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) Harder told the Ambassador that meeting with him and 
visiting Washington were top priorities for his first week on 
the job.  While in Washington June 19-20, Harder will be 
meeting with Deputy Secretary Armitage and Deputy National 
Security Advisor Hadley, among others.  The Ambassador 
responded that while there have been strains in the bilateral 
relationship over Iraq, the relationship remains strong.  He 
noted that the \"Buy American\" provision in the House version 
of the 2004 Defense Authorization Bill (ref. A) was motivated 
in part by some members\' desire to punish Canada for its 
position on Iraq, but that State and Defense are opposing the 
provision. 
 
3. (C) Harder said that Foreign Affairs (DFAIT) and the 
Government as a whole are looking at how to better manage 
U.S.-Canada relations, making for more coherent policy across 
the many agencies involved.  The Ambassador cited the GoC\'s 
proposed legislation to decriminalize marijuana as a policy 
initiative in one area that would have detrimental effects in 
another, the border.  Harder agreed.  He noted that greater 
central supervision of the bilateral relationship is also 
being discussed by the contenders in the Liberal Party 
leadership race. 
 
4. (C) Harder said that the GoC needed to work on its 
\"post-NAFTA\" agenda, strengthening the bilateral economic 
relationship and \"trilateralizing\" some issues to include 
Mexico.  The private sector would need to be consulted, he 
said, because its support had been critical for pushing 
through both the bilateral Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA. 
Provincial Premiers and U.S. Governors should also be engaged 
more often on issues such as energy transmission.  Harder was 
pleased that Canadian is increasing its diplomatic presence 
in the U.S., and said that Industry Canada had sacrificed 25% 
of its incremental budget in FY2003-2004 to help fund this 
expansion. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador observed that the relationship between 
Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge and Deputy Prime 
 
SIPDIS 
Minister Manley was excellent, but that Manley\'s future was 
uncertain given the Liberal leadership race.  Harder said 
that our border management cooperation needed to be 
institutionalized.  He noted that in 1993, the Conservative 
government of the day had created a Department of Public 
Security, which drew together many of the same functions as 
the U.S. has now done under Homeland Security.   Harder 
became Deputy Minister of Public Security, but the Department 
was closed after only a few months because of concerns that 
immigration should be kept separate from law enforcement. 
Harder did not expect the GoC to create a new 
\"super-department,\" but it was clear that stovepiping needed 
to be reduced. 
 
--------------------- 
MISSILE DEFENSE/NORAD 
--------------------- 
 
6. (C) On missile defense, the Ambassador welcomed the June 
18 visit to Washington by a Canadian delegation to discuss 
potential Canadian participation.  He noted that the missile 
defense execution mission would be at NORTHCOM, instead of 
NORAD, but said that Canadian participation was important to 
continue our longstanding cooperation in North American 
defense.  Harder said that DFAIT and National Defense hope to 
be able to complete negotiations and report to Cabinet in the 
fall, but their understanding from DoD is that this will take 
longer.  Harder added that Foreign Minister Graham is 
planning to visit NORAD August 28-29, and that he may try to 
join Graham for that visit.  The Ambassador encouraged him to 
do so. 
 
------------------------ 
ICC/UNSC RESOLUTION 1422 
------------------------ 
 
7. (C) On the ICC, the Ambassador raised Canadian PermRep 
Heinbecker\'s statement opposing UNSC Resolution 1422 (ref. 
B), and said that Canada should be sensitive to the U.S. 
position.  We want to continue to support peacekeeping 
operations, but we\'re a target internationally, as evidenced 
by the outrageous war crimes charges brought against U.S. 
officials in Belgium.  Harder responded that Heinbecker was 
simply restating Canadian policy, and that DFAIT was careful 
to ensure that his statement did not directly criticize the 
U.S.  He hoped that the U.S. position would change once the 
ICC had a track record showing that it would not allow 
frivolous claims. 
 
---------------------- 
TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS 
---------------------- 
 
8. (C) On the recent Trafficking in Persons report, the 
Ambassador explained that Canada had been dropped from Tier 1 
to Tier 2 status because of inadequate enforcement and 
prosecution.  We hope that the anti-trafficking legislation 
Canada enacted in 2002 will make a difference.  Harder said 
that Citizenship and Immigration Canada was puzzled by the 
lower ranking, and that our official cooperation on this 
issue has been excellent.  The Ambassador said that one area 
where Canada could help would be removal of South Korea from 
its visa waiver program, as this is one route for sex trade 
victims to enter Canada. 
 
--------------------------------- 
PROLIFERATION SECURITY INITIATIVE 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Harder expressed his disappointment that Canada had 
not been invited to participate in the June 12 Madrid meeting 
on the Proliferation Security Initiative, given Canada\'s 
activism on non-proliferation issues and our North American 
security cooperation.  Harder said that Defense Minister 
McCallum had raised this with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld at 
NATO, and that DFAIT Assistant Deputy Minister Wright would 
do so with Under Secretary Bolton.

BIO NOTE

10. (SBU) Harder is a career public servant who began at 
DFAIT but has served in a number of different departments. 
Harder, now 50, was the second youngest Canadian ever 
appointed as a deputy minister in 1991.  According to 
contacts at Industry Canada, he focuses on making decisions 
which will serve the interests of the largest number of 
Canadians, and presses his staff to identify such choices. 
He is sharp, affable, and popular with his staff.  Harder\'s 
right hand person is Pam LeBlanc, who has been with him in at 
least four assignments and joins him again at DFAIT.  Harder 
is part of the inner circle of senior Canadian bureaucrats, 
most of whom expect he will be the next Clerk of the Privy 
Council, the top civil servant position in Ottawa.  At DFAIT, 
Harder replaces Gaetan Lavertu, who has been re-assigned as 
Ambassador to Mexico.

SUBJECT: MANITOBA CONSERVATION LEADER REGISTERS CONCERN IN 
BSE CRISIS 
 
1. On 19 June, Manitoba Conservative Party leader (and head 
of Manitoba\'s Official Opposition in the Legislature) Stuart 
Murray visited new APP Winnipeg Consul to formally register 
the concerns of his constituents at the ongoing freeze of 
Canadian beef import into the United States.  He specifically 
asked if there was anything else that political leaders or 
beef producers could do to speed the reopening of the border. 
 Further, noting that some U.S. Senators had suggested 
reopening the border to Canadian beef could take as long as 
seven years, Murray asked if Consul had any indication as to 
how long the process might really take or if he saw any light 
at the end of the tunnel. 
 
2. Consul responded that while he was quite new to Canada and 
to the office, his initial impression was that the Canadian 
government was being quite cooperative and thorough in its 
investigation of the Alberta outbreak.  He underscored that 
the USG\'s responsibility first and foremost was the 
protection of U.S. consumers, but that the U.S. also 
understood the pain inflicted on Canadian ranchers.  Consul 
said that the U.S. would do everything it could to reopen the 
border to Canadian beef as quickly as possible, but added 
that any such decision must be based on sound science.  He 
pointed out that the task -- proving the existence of a 
negative -- was logically impossible, but that the U.S. would 
have to have a high confidence level in the science before 
acting. 
 
3. Murray asserted his belief that there was some political 
angle to the continuing ban.  Pointing both to the obvious 
benefits to the U.S. cattle industry of the border closure to 
the U.S. beef, as well as the recent decline in U.S.-Canadian 
relations and what he described as the poor relationship 
between PM Chretien and President Bush, Murray said the 
purpose of his call was to send the message that Manitoba\'s 
political leaders wanted to see the situation resolved 
quickly.  Consul agreed to report his views to Ottawa and 
Washington, and provided Murray with an June 6 backgrounder 
from USDA on BSE.  Consul also offered to keep Murray 
informed of any new developments he became aware of. 
 
4. COMMENT:  It is worth noting that under Murray\'s 
leadership, the Conservative party lost 4 of its 24 seats in 
the legislature in the June 3 provincial elections, and local 
press reports suggest Murray may face a leadership challenge 
in the next few months.  While Murray\'s concern for Manitoba 
farmers is real and justified, his approach to APP Winnipeg 
may also represent his desire to show himself as a man of 
action. End Comment.

1.  Sensitive but unclassified, please protect 
accordingly.  Not for Internet distribution. 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR AND GOC EXPECT LOWER GROWTH 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On June 3, the Bank of Canada downgraded its 
2003 growth outlook for Canada from nearly 4%, in May, 
to 2.5- 3%.  BOC Governor Dodge confirmed the less 
optimistic view in a June 18 speech, saying that the 
BOC now expects continued softness in the Canadian 
economy over the short term.  A number of private 
sector economists have recently announced downward 
revisions to their short-term forecasts as well. 
 
3. (U) On June 17, Federal Finance Minister John Manley 
announced that the GOC is slashing its 2003 economic 
growth forecast by up to a full percentage point, 
possibly to 2.2%.  Manley stressed that federal 
finances will remain in the black, but cited increased 
federal spending to cope with the fallout from SARS and 
mad cow disease, the weak U.S. economy and the sharply 
rising C$ as factors contributing to the GOC\'s more 
pessimistic view. 
 
WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY? 
----------------------- 
 
4. SBU) First Quarter GDP data released by Statistics 
Canada on May 30 shows that the Canadian economy grew 
at a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter 
of 2003 - up from a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the 
preceding three months. However, the brisk activity in 
consumer spending, residential construction, and 
government expenditures was overshadowed by a massive 
involuntary build-up in inventories, in particular in 
the auto sector.  In addition, exports of goods and 
services declined for the second consecutive quarter 
and the recent appreciation of the C$ (up 18% against 
the US$ since the beginning of the year) point to 
further weakness.  This will further exacerbate 
conditions in the manufacturing sector which has lost 
66,000 factory jobs over the past six months, nearly 
half of the 141,000 jobs created in that sector in the 
past two years.  These job losses point to short-term 
weakness in consumer spending and government revenues. 
Over the longer term, the cuts in employment plus the 
increase in investment in imported capital goods 
supported by the stronger C$ should boost productivity. 
 
WE LOWER OUR FORECAST 
--------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Revised data and the change in economic 
conditions lead us to expect economic growth of 2.1% in 
2003, rising to 3.2% in 2004.  On May 30, Statistics 
Canada released actual GDP data for QI 2003, along with 
quarterly revisions for previous years.  Incorporating 
the revisions (which resulted in a higher base for 
previous years) lowered our forecast projection (ref B) 
to 2.4% for 2003 (from 3.5% in January), and 3.9% for 
2004 (from January\'s 4.3% estimate).  Our April 
economic and fiscal update (ref A) for 2003 revised the 
January forecast numbers to around 3%, and to just 
under 4% in 2004. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The BOC signaled a shift in monetary policy 
on June 3, by leaving interest rates unchanged, 
following two consecutive increases.  Given BOC 
concerns about continued weakness over the next two 
quarters, we assume a degree of monetary stimulus in 
the short term that keeps our growth forecast for 2003 
just above 2%.

SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN FRIENDLY FIRE INCIDENT: CANADIAN 
REACTION TO DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH COURTS MARTIAL 
AGAINST U.S. PILOTS 
 
1. (SBU) The Canadian Government reacted very evenly to the 
June 19 decision by U.S. Air Force LTGEN Bruce Carlson not to 
proceed with courts martial against two pilots who mistakenly 
bombed Canadian troops in Afghanistan.  Prime Minister 
Chretien said the matter is now closed as far as the Canadian 
Government is concerned.  Canadian Chief of Defense Staff GEN 
Henault issued a statement expressing sympathy with the 
soldiers\' families, reiterating the Canadian Forces\' 
commitment to contributing to international peace and 
security (including in ISAF), and pledging to work with 
allies to mitigate the possibility of such incidents in the 
future. 
 
2. (SBU) The families of the four Canadian soldiers killed in 
the April 2002 incident said they had expected the decision, 
but most were upset that stronger action was not being taken 
against the two pilots.  A common refrain among the families 
was a concern that the pilots not be allowed to fly again for 
the U.S. Air Force.  One of the pilots will receive a 
reprimand and is leaving the Air Force.  The second pilot 
still faces disciplinary proceedings that could result in a 
reprimand, 30 days confinement to quarters, loss of one 
month\'s pay, and/or no longer being permitted to fly for the 
Air Force.  The family of one of the Canadian soldiers filed 
a wrongful death claim against the U.S. military earlier this 
year, and that case is ongoing. 
 
3. (SBU) COMMENT: More than one year after the fact, there is 
a greater realization here now that the friendly fire 
incident, while tragic, is one of many affecting allied 
forces.  Canadians will continue to scrutinize disciplinary 
measures taken against the pilots, but most consider the Air 
Force\'s handling of the case thus far to have been 
even-handed.

REF:  02 OTTAWA 844 
 
1. SUMMARY:  Canadian reactions to the USDOC policy 
bulletin on softwood lumber, which was released by 
Undersecretary Grant Aldonas on June 18, were mildly 
positive except in Quebec where there was broad 
disappointment that the section concerning that 
province was excluded from the document.  Whatever 
reactions may emerge, nothing in the bulletin can have 
come as a surprise given the extensive process that 
generated it, and there is currently no alternative 
\"exit strategy\" from the dispute.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   In March 2002 (reftel), when USDOC imposed anti-dumping 
and countervailing duties on softwood lumber from Canada, 
Mission Canada witnessed some of the strongest criticism of 
U.S. trade policy in a decade.  The fact that the release of 
the policy bulletin made scarcely a ripple in the media 
shows just how much the political temperature around this 
issue has cooled.  Yet the economic stakes are as high as 
ever.  Indeed, on June 20 two major Quebec-based players, 
Domtar and Tembec, announced a restructuring of their money- 
losing mills in Eastern Canada (this announcement was 
reported without mention of the policy bulletin). 
 
3.    Quebec business and political players expressed 
disappointment that their province was not covered by the 
bulletin, and focused on responding to this situation, which 
press commentators interpreted as threatening to isolate 
Quebec from other provinces in negotiations with U.S. 
interests.  Quebec Forest Industry Council head Georges 
Courteau said Quebec \"must pursue talks with with a set of 
new ideas to put on the table.\"  Quebec Natural Resources 
Minister Sam Hamad said the province would make use of the 
comment period to submit further explanation of Quebec\'s 
practices. 
 
4.   Representatives of integrated, western-based producer 
Weyerhaeuser Canada, when interviewed the day before 
publication, were supportive of the policy bulletin process, 
and said they also support the use of interim measures for 
up to two years or so provided they are part of an \"exit 
strategy\" leading to a permanent solution. 
 
5.   B.C. Lumber Trade Council President John Allan was 
quoted calling the bulletin \"a significant step\" and said he 
was \"pretty confident we can show the Americans we\'ve got 
market-based policy reform in B.C.\"  \"Obviously we are 
pleased it has come out,\" Allan said.  \"By and large it is 
consistent with our understanding on what we have discussed 
with the U.S.\"  Allan was quoted saying that the interim 
aspects of U.S. proposals for resolving the dispute are 
more problematic, and also that while he did not like the 
numbers in the U.S. proposal, it could be enough to get both 
sides back to the negotiating table in coming weeks. 
 
6. B.C. Forests Minister Mike De Jong portrayed the bulletin 
as a necessary step.  \"For the first time we are seeing from 
the U.S. federal administration a clear acceptance of the 
notion that we need to establish in clear terms the rules 
upon which we are going to get off this trade dispute 
treadmill.  That has been a fundamental objective of ours in 
British Columbia from the outset.\"

SUBJECT:  WHAT IS CANADIAN?  GOC REVIEWS ITS DEFINITION OF 
       \"CANADIAN CONTENT\" IN FILM AND TV PRODUCTION 
 
REF:   02 OTTAWA 922 
 
1.   SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION:  Canada applies various tests to 
define \"Canadian content\" of entertainment products, in 
order to make funding decisions and to enforce broadcast 
content requirements.  On June 17, the GOC announced results 
of a year-long review (reftel) of the definition of 
\"Canadian content\" as it applies to film and television 
production.  While the resulting recommendations suggest 
numerous changes, they broadly support the GOC\'s overall 
approach to cultural policy.  They stress that \"Canadian 
content can be created only by Canadians.\"  They also 
propose that the current \"points/expenditure system\" - under 
which Canadian content is determined by a formula based 
partly on the nationality of key creative personnel - be 
replaced by a co-called \"creative expenditure model.\"  END 
SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
2.   THE CURRENT REGIME:  As a condition of license, 
Canadian radio and television broadcasters are required to 
fill certain percentages of their broadcast schedules with 
\"Canadian\" programming.  Key public sector film and TV 
funding bodies, Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Film and 
Television Production Fund (CFTPF), are mandated to support 
distinctively \"Canadian\" productions.  The GOC\'s Canadian 
Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC) is also designed 
to support production of \"Canadian\" content. 
 
3. THE RULES:  Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Audio-Visual 
Certification Office (CAVCO) apply specific rules to 
determine whether a given production is Canadian for 
purposes of GOC funding and tax credits.  These rules are 
based on the nationality of key creative personnel 
(director, screenwriter, key actors, etc.) and on a minimum 
(75 percent) of production costs being paid to Canadian 
entities.  The Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the broadcast 
regulator, applies similar rules to determine whether a 
production is Canadian for purposes of meeting TV 
broadcasting quotas. 
 
4.   THE PROBLEM:  Critics have pointed out for years that 
these rules do not truly govern content; they implicitly 
assume that what Canadian personnel produce will be 
\"Canadian content.\"  As one columnist recently wrote, \"the 
requisite number of Canadians may be employed, but the film 
itself may be about American tourists eating Japanese food 
in Bangladesh. . . . And why should it be preferred to a 
film made by Americans of a Canadian story, as in `The 
Shipping News\' [a film set in Newfoundland starring U.S. 
actors]?\"  With Canada now the site of a large amount of 
U.S.-financed and/or internationally co-produced film and 
television, the rules have become somewhat harder to apply. 
Moreover, such questions about what is (or should be) 
considered Canadian are not only more culturally 
problematic, but also of growing economic/commercial 
importance. 
 
5.   POLICY CONTEXT:  Post predicted a year ago (reftel) 
that the GOC review, while potentially useful, would likely 
not tackle important larger issues about the relevance of 
Canadian cultural policy measures.  In many cases, Canada\'s 
media/entertainment industries today are vastly more 
prosperous, successful and dynamic than they were when these 
policies were first formulated.  As expected, the results of 
the GOC \"Canadian content\" review are framed within the 
broader status quo of Canadian cultural policy and are meant 
to reinforce it.  In fairness, it bears noting that some 
wider issues in cultural policy have been addressed recently 
by Parliamentary committees - such as the House Industry 
Committee\'s recent study of foreign ownership restrictions 
in telecommunications, and the House Heritage Committee\'s 
examination of the state of Canadian broadcasting (see 
website parl.gc.ca under \"committee business\").  However, we 
see little prospect of these studies leading to actual 
changes in policy. 
 
6.   RECOMMENDATIONS:  The results of the \"Canadian content\" 
review are available at website canadianheritage.gc.ca under 
\"what\'s new.\"  Following are key features. 
 
-- The review reinforces a basic tenet of Canadian cultural 
policy:  \"Canadian content can be created only by Canadians. 
. . . Foreigners cannot relate an event or tell a story from 
a Canadian point of view . . .  . The mere fact of being 
very largely created by Canadians is what gives an 
audiovisual work its unique Canadian identity.\"  (This 
effectively dismisses the criticism cited in para. 4 above). 
-- The review recommends replacing the various current 
systems for assessing Canadian content, including the 
current points/expenditure system described in para. 3, with 
a single \"creative expenditure model\" which would be applied 
nationwide.  This would focus on all the \"creative costs\" of 
a production, classed into four groups:  authors, creative 
collaborators, performers, and technicians.  To qualify as 
Canadian, a production would need to meet minimum 
expenditure requirements in each group.  These minimum 
expenditure requirements would be subject to a system of 
options.  Producers could exercise an option to use non- 
Canadian elements, and pay for this flexibility by incurring 
higher minimum expenditure requirements.  For details, see 
section 3.2 of the report at website canadianheritage.ca 
under \"what\'s new\". 
-- It recommends that the distribution of Canadian feature 
films in Canada continue to be reserved for Canadian-owned 
and -controlled companies (a long-standing protective 
measure). 
 
-- It recommends that the broadcast regulator consider 
exempting commercials that promote Canadian feature films 
from the twelve-minute-per-hour TV advertising limit.  This 
could reduce the perceived disadvantage faced by Canadian 
films in advertising and promotion vis--vis bigger-budget 
U.S. productions. 
 
7.   COMMENT:  Canada\'s cultural-policy-making establishment 
is making few concessions in the face of the profound 
economic, demographic and technological changes which have 
transformed North America\'s media landscape in recent 
decades.  At least under the leadership of outgoing Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien, all indications are that any policy 
changes will be designed to reinforce and improve the 
existing complex of protections and incentives, rather than 
re-evaluate its relevance.  However, it is clear that the 
challenges to the status quo - both technical (the Internet, 
satellite signal theft, etc.) and political (Chretien is 
scheduled to retire sometime in the coming eight months) - 
will not go away.

SUBJECT: Canada\'s Uranium: A primer 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. Canada is the largest uranium producer in the world - in 
2002 production was 11,607 metric tonnes of uranium, about 
one-third of total world production.  Canada typically 
provides 20 to 30 percent of uranium used in the United 
States.  The two main players are Cameco, a Canadian-based 
publicly traded company and COGEMA, the mining arm of the 
international nuclear group, AREVA. Despite low uranium 
prices in the late 1990\'s and early 2000\'s, these mining 
firms have invested in new mines and plants, and the 
development of new high-grade deposits means that Canadian 
producers are well positioned to capitalize on future market 
opportunities.  With U.S. electric utilities looking to 
extend their existing plant operating licenses, increase 
(\"uprate\") their power output, and possibly build new 
nuclear plants, Canada\'s uranium deposits may become even 
more significant for U.S. energy interests in the coming 
years.  Concern does exist within the Canadian uranium 
mining industry, however, that low uranium prices will 
curtail exploration and could scuttle plans to bring new 
deposits fully on line.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
CANADA\'S URANIUM DEPOSITS & PRODUCTION 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. Canada is the world\'s largest producer of uranium. In 
2002, production, at 13,689 metric tonnes (t) of uranium 
oxide concentrate (representing 11,607 t Uranium), was about 
a third of total world production. Its value was about C$ 
600 million.  All of the active mines, as well as the vast 
reserves, are located in the Athabasca basin region in the 
northernmost quarter of the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
3. Canada\'s low cost uranium reserves (Reasonably Assured 
Resources plus Estimated Additional Resources) are 515,000 
metric tonnes of uranium oxide (U3O8) (437,000 tonnes 
Uranium, 14 percent of world total).  (Note that Australia 
has approximately double the reserves of Canada.) 
 
4. Some C$539 million (one C$ currently equals approximately 
US$0.74) was spent on uranium exploration in Canada from 
1986 to 1997 and this led to a sharp increase in recoverable 
resources. Despite depletion from mining, resources have 
further increased slightly since 1997.  Exploration 
expenditure in 1998 was C$60 million, then $49 million in 
1999 and 2000, mostly at established projects. 
 
5. Australia\'s uranium reserves are the world\'s largest, 
with 28% of the world\'s total (estimated at about 750,000 
metric tonnes of uranium).  Australia is the world\'s second- 
largest producer of uranium, responsible for about 19% of 
total global production in 2002, with 6888 metric tones of 
uranium.  In 2002 the United States was the world\'s eighth 
ranked producer of uranium, producing 919 metric tonnes of 
uranium from mines (as opposed to use of HEU from former 
national military stockpiles). 
 
6. Currently, Canada supplies 20 to 30 percent of uranium 
used in the United States - typically this is shipped to the 
United States as Uranium Hexaflouride, which is then 
enriched to become fuel for American light water reactors. 
 
----------------- 
THE MAJOR PLAYERS 
----------------- 
 
7. Two producers account for over 90 percent of Canadian 
uranium production. Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based Cameco is 
the largest producer in the world with 5479 metric tonnes of 
uranium produced in Canada in 2002.  Cameco was created in 
1988 by the merger of two government corporations, the 
Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation and El Dorado 
Nuclear Limited.  Cameco is now fully owned by private 
investors after the government of Saskatchewan sold its 10 
percent share in 2002.  The company\'s 56 million shares are 
traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (symbol - CCO) and the 
New York Stock Exchange (symbol - CCJ).  Cameco also 
operates uranium mines in Wyoming and Nebraska.  The company 
produces nuclear electricity as an owner of, and the sole 
fuel supplier to, Bruce Power\'s operating nuclear reactors 
in Ontario (four currently operating, two soon to re-start). 
 
8. Uranium ore mined by Cameco in Saskatchewan is milled 
into \"yellowcake\" (a uranium oxide concentrate) at 
facilities also located in northern Saskatchewan.  The 
milled \"yellowcake\" is then shipped to Cameco\'s refining 
plant at Blind River, Ontario and conversion plant at Port 
Hope, Ontario for processing into uranium dioxide for use as 
fuel in the Canadian built heavy-water \"CANDU\" reactors 
located in Canada, Korea, China, and elsewhere. The Port 
Hope facility also produces uranium hexafluoride which is 
shipped to the United States and elsewhere for enrichment 
into fuel for light-water reactors.  The facility at Port 
Hope has a capacity to convert 12,500 metric tonnes of 
uranium per year into uranium hexaflouride. 
 
9.   COGEMA Resources Incorporated (CRI) is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Paris-based COGEMA, itself wholly owned by the 
international nuclear industrial group, AREVA.  CRI is the 
second largest producer of uranium in Canada, with 5425 
metric tonnes of uranium produced in 2002. CRI\'s activities 
in Canada are limited to mining and milling uranium into 
yellowcake; CRI has no conversion facilities in Canada, but 
exports yellowcake for conversion and enrichment (to France 
and the United States).  CRI\'s principal mines are McClean 
Lake, and its part ownership in the mines at Cigar Lake and 
McArthur River, all in Saskatchewan. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
NEW HIGH GRADE MINES STARING TO PRODUCE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10.  Canada is in the midst of a transition from second- 
generation uranium mines (started 1975-83) to new high-grade 
ones, all in northwestern Saskatchewan.  In 1999-2000, mines 
at McArthur River and McClean Lake commenced production, 
producing some 3700 metric tonnes of uranium and 2300 tonnes 
of uranium respectively.  Three more mines (Cigar Lake, 
Midwest and Dawn Lake) are planned.  The Cigar Lake mine is 
closest to opening and is expected to produce 7000 metric 
tonnes of uranium annually once it is on line, around 2006. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING URANIUM INDUSTRY 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11.  Production at Cameco\'s McArthur River mine, said to be 
the world\'s largest, was temporarily suspended in April 2003 
due to underground flooding.  Cameco anticipates that 
production at McArthur River will resume in July 2003.  The 
company forecasts that 2003 net earnings will decline by $4 
to $5 million for every month the mine remains inoperable. 
However, Cameco expects to fully deliver on its 2003 sales 
contracts through its inventory and other supply sources. 
 
12.  The first labor dispute in the history of Canada\'s 
uranium mining industry ended after a brief, five-day work 
stoppage in June 2003.  Unionized workers at CRI demanded 
wage increases to be on par with their counterparts at 
Cameco.  Though still below Cameco pay levels, CRI workers 
negotiated a 10.5 percent increase in wages over a three- 
year term.  The short stoppage is not expected to affect 
CRI\'s production forecasts. 
 
13.  CRI is currently appealing a September 2002 Canadian 
Federal Court ruling that cancelled their 1999 operating 
license for the McClean Lake project on the grounds that CRI 
had not conducted an adequate environmental review under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.  In November 2002, 
the Federal Court of Appeal granted a stay of the previous 
decision while the case is appealed.  Currently, the McClean 
Lake mine is operating under a four-year operating license 
issued in 2001 that increased the mine\'s production capacity 
up to 3600 metric tonnes of U3O8 per year.  A shutdown of 
the McClean Lake mine would eliminate a significant portion 
of CRI\'s current uranium production. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
SECURITY OF URANIUM SUPPLY WILL REQUIRE PRICE INCREASE 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
14.  It is not a sure bet, however, that Cigar Lake, Midwest 
and Dawn lake will come on stream as scheduled - or that 
other new resources will be developed.  During a speech to 
investors in March 2003, the CEO of Cameco, Gerald Grandey, 
noted that forecast uranium production will fall short of 
the uranium market\'s requirements by 300 million pounds over 
the next 10 years.  Although secondary sources (such as 
inventory from ex-military stockpiles) do provide a 
significant amount of uranium for fuel, this contribution, 
according to uranium industry advocates, is still not 
sufficient to make up the shorfall in uranium supply. 
Grandey\'s analysis is that the capital investment needed to 
cover the deficit \"will require higher sustained prices\" and 
that he is \"convinced it is a case of when, not if, prices 
improve.\"  Currently, the spot price of uranium is 
recovering from an historic low of US$7 per pound in 2000 to 
almost US$11 per pound currently (though far from the high- 
water marks of US$16 per pound in 1988 and 1996). 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15. Canada\'s high-grade uranium deposits in northern 
Saskatchewan offer a secure fuel supply for American nuclear 
power plants.  To ensure that known deposits are brought to 
production, and to encourage further exploration will, 
however, require an increase in the price of uranium, 
according to industry analysts.  GoC officials and industry 
contacts remain interested in maintaining a close dialogue 
with USG in order to address important uranium market issues 
and presumably to encourage uranium industry investment in 
mines and exploration.

IRAQI ASSETS 
 
REF: STATE 186972 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The GOC has received reftel letter and is 
exploring the legal procedures necessary to complete transfer 
of assets to the Iraqi government in compliance with the 
expected notification from the UN 661 Committee.  The frozen 
Iraqi government assets are held by banks, and the GOC does 
not know details of ownership or number of accounts.  The 
Department of Foreign Affairs raised the possibility that the 
GOI might want to keep the C$20,000 in Canada to cover costs 
related to its missions here.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) We confirmed the GOC\'s receipt of the letter 
referred to in reftel and used the opportunity to clarify 
possible procedures for release of Iraqi assets.  Canada has 
approximately C$20,000 in frozen Iraqi government assets and 
the GOC is not aware of any assets in Canada belonging to 
individuals. 
 
Complications 
------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Although Iraqi government assets were frozen in 
compliance with the UN order after Gulf War I, there was no 
requirement for banks to report details of the accounts to 
the GOC.  Thus the GOC does not know the names of the account 
holders, the exact number of accounts or the total amount in 
each account.  Seizure by the GOC for transfer to the 
Development Fund In Iraq would require a legislative change, 
a lengthy process as parliament has recessed for the summer. 
 
Awaiting notification from the 661 Committee 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) The GOC is waiting for notification from the UN 661 
Committee in order to finalize the details of its legal 
options.  A lawyer working on the issue agreed that, given 
the fact that the GOC does not know details of the accounts 
and does not have legal authority to transfer the funds 
without legislative action, a letter from a \"duly authorized\" 
official of the Iraqi government to the Minister of Finance 
and the Minister of Foreign Affairs requesting transfer of 
GOI assets to a specified account (the DFI) might do the 
trick.   The GOC would then issue a general certificate 
authorizing banks to make the transfer.  Banks would make the 
decision on whether they considered the GOI requesting 
official \"duly authorized\" but would probably follow GOC 
guidance. 
 
Does the Iraqi Government Want to Transfer the Assets? 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. SBU) DFAIT pointed out that a request to transfer the 
assets could depend on GOI plans for its missions in Canada. 
Iraq has real property in Canada (consulates as well as the 
embassy).  DFAIT believes the diplomatic account is in 
arrears, and there may be property taxes outstanding.  If 
Iraq plans to sell its missions, it would make sense to 
transfer the funds, but if the GOI plans to maintain a 
diplomatic presence in Canada it may wish to keep the funds 
for use here.

REF:   OTTAWA 1079 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.   As reported reftel, Canada is clearly shifting its 
policy on telecommunications competition toward a more pro- 
competitive model.  A decision announced by the GOC\'s 
telecom regulator on June 30 reinforced this trend by 
clarifying the terms of access of telecom service providers 
to multi-unit residential buildings. 
 
2.   Telecom firms had complained that condominium and 
apartment building owners/managers were able to restrict 
competition in the provision of service to residents. 
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission

negotiating just and expedient conditions of access to 
MDUs.\"  The decision also addresses a number of related 
matters, including the terms and conditions of access to 
MDUs via the LECs\' facilities. 
 
3.   Text of the decision is available on the CRTC\'s website 
at crtc.gc.ca under \"what\'s new.\"  Inter alia, the decision 
states that \"LECs must have the ability to access and enter 
into MDUs, in order to connect and/or install their 
facilities, as well as repair and maintain them and 
do whatever else may be required to provide reliable, high- 
quality service to end-users.  . . . The Commission expects 
building owners to cooperate with LECs to enable them to 
access end-users in their MDUs.\"  The decision also states 
that any exclusive-access arrangement between LECs and 
building owners would be a violation of the 
Telecommunications Act.  However, it says the CRTC will 
allow \"preferred marketing arrangements that are limited to 
the marketing of a LEC\'s services in an MDU, so long as 
these arrangements do not have the effect of limiting access 
by other LECs.\"

SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH ABDULLA BIN AL-ATTIYAH, 
GOVERNOR OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF QATAR 
 
 
 1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 
on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in 
Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Abdulla bin al-Attiyah, 
Governor of the Central Bank of Qatar, discussed the regional 
economic situation with a focus on the fight against 
terrorist financing, privatization plans, and trade issues 
including the President\'s initiatives on the Middle East Free 
Trade Agreement (MEFTA) and Middle East Partnership 
Initiative (MEPI).  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) Al-Attiyah confirmed that Qatar\'s economy is booming: 
 oil and gas revenues are up; prices on the stock exchange 
are up almost 20% this year after increasing nearly 35% last 
year; and real estate prices are strong. 
 
New Steps to Control Financial Flows 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) A/S Wayne congratulated al-Attiyah on the success of 
last fall\'s anti-money laundering conference and mentioned 
participation by Qatari officials in the recent USG training 
sessions. He stressed the importance we continue to place on 
blocking the flow of funds to terrorist organizations, and 
asked the status of Qatar\'s anti-money laundering 
legislation.  Al-Attiyah said that the money laundering law 
is moving: it has been approved by the Council of Ministers 
and the shura, and should be finalized soon.  The GOQ has 
established a new committee to address money laundering under 
the jurisdiction of the Central bank. 
 
4. (SBU) Qatar is adding terrorist financing to the criminal 
law, and has just established a committee to coordinate the 
fight against terrorist financing.  They are adding a legal 
article permitting the Central Bank Governor to freeze any 
asset on instructions from the Attorney General-equivalent. 
(Al-Attiyah said he is pleased that he does not have the 
authority to freeze assets unilaterally, fearing that could 
lead to perceptions of abuse of power.  The proposed 
arrangement will allow officials with access to intelligence 
reporting and legal information to make the decision.) 
 
MEFTA and MEPI have Promise 
--------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Asked his views on MEFTA and MEPI, al-Attiyah said 
he is not an expert.  It sounds like a nice approach; has 
validity; a good idea.  But he wanted to emphasize his 
personal view on the importance of solving Middle East 
problems first.   The initiatives are nice, but the 
Palestinian problem is crucial. Bush seems to be a firm 
president and al-Attiyah stated that he tells people the U.S. 
president shouldn\'t be underestimated.  A/S Wayne responded 
that the situations in Iraq and the Middle East peace process 
are crucial and President Bush and the Administration are 
committed to finding a solution, but MEFTA and MEPI provide 
other pillars to support growth and development in the 
region. 
 
Democracy is Key 
---------------- 
 
6. (U) Asked his view on the most important ingredient for 
peace and growth in the region, al-Attiyah said \"democracy.\" 
The region has never had cooperation; it has not even been 
able to agree on a customs union.   The GCC is hoping to 
establish a common currency by 2010, to really integrate the 
GCC economies.  Most big projects in the region are 
successful if they have government support, and the US should 
be sure governments are involved. 
 
Need to Refine Informal Fund Transfer Systems 
--------------------------------------------- 
 7. (U) Al-Attiyah noted that during international meetings, 
his fellow GCC Governors have commented on Americans\' 
apparent misunderstanding of the term \"hawala,\" giving it 
meaning beyond its Arabic meaning of \"transfer.\"  A/S  Wayne 
said we are aware of the nuances and have adopted various 
terms such as \"informal value transfer system\" to refer to 
the process.  There was discussion of the benefits of sharing 
best practices, including licensing those engaged in 
transferring funds and lowering the costs of transferring 
funds in the formal financial system.  Al-Attiyah confirmed 
that in Qatar the correspondent in a hawala transfer should 
be a licensed bank.  He suggested that a more targeted 
approach on specific individuals might be more effective than 
the very broad effort to control all fund transfers.  (The 
issue of providing what could be an expensive system for 
transfer of remittances had been raised during the panel 
discussion moderated by al-Attiyah.) 
 
Privatization Plans 
------------------- 
8. (U) Asked about Qatar\'s privatization plans, al-Attiyah 
mentioned that the first target will be in the petrochemical 
sector, and discussed plans regarding aluminum.

9. (U) Al-Attiyah\'s father has a house in Beirut at which 
al-Attiyah vacations.  He went to school in Michigan and 
attended SAIS.  He later served in Qatar\'s embassy in 
Washington from 1979-82.  He speaks fluent but un-enunciated 
English.

SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH LEBANESE MINISTER OF 
ECONOMY AND TRADE HAMADEH 
 
 1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 
on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in 
Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Lebanese Minister of Economy 
and Trade Marwan Hamadeh discussed the regional economic 
situation with a focus on the fight against terrorist 
financing; cooperation on Iraq; implementation of Paris II; 
and trade issues including IPR protection and the President\'s 
initiatives on the Middle East Free Trade Agreement (MEFTA) 
and Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI).  There was 
also discussion of the visa status of Minister of Finance 
Siniora and the recent cancellation of Air Canada\'s 
Beirut-Montreal flight.  End summary. 
 
USG Action 
---------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Action requests for information to provide to 
Minister Hamadeh are in para 13 (status of the visa review 
for Minister of Finance Siniora) and para 14 (contact 
information on the Baghdad Forum). 
 
No Economic Collapse, but Some Stumbling Blocks 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3.  (U) A/S Wayne opened the meeting by expressing his 
pleasant surprise at the perseverance of the Lebanese 
economy, noting that the economic collapse many feared had 
not come about.  Hamadeh explained that Lebanon has an 
economy not of figures, but of atmosphere, climate, and the 
confidence of the Lebanese, and cited the secure Pound, the 
increasing balance of payments, and the level of Central Bank 
reserves as positive signs.  He confirmed that Paris II 
implementation is proceeding well -- most countries have 
honored their commitments -- but it has been complicated by 
the situation in Iraq. 
 
4.  (U) GOL privatization plans have been delayed by the war 
in Iraq (as they do not want to sell at depressed prices) but 
are continuing.  The GOL will call for adjudication of firms 
in the telecom field very shortly, and already has 
pre-qualified a number of companies, mainly from the region 
and Europe.  However, if the financial offers are weak the 
GOL may start with partial privatizations, for example 
spinning off only the management function of certain firms. 
All privatization revenue will be dedicated to debt reduction 
and go into a special fund for that purpose.  He added that 
the GOL needs to cut military expenses but that is difficult 
when \"the region is still boiling.\" 
 
Ambitious Plans on Trade (and IPR Protection) 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) Hamadeh stressed the GOL focus on three main tasks: 
 
1.  Positioning Lebanon in the emerging Arab common market; 
2.  Concluding an accord de participation with the EU; 
 
3.  Acceding to the WTO. 
 
In the context of the EU agreement he highlighted IPR 
protection and quality control as areas that will need work. 
He later expanded on this, detailing complaints made by EU 
firms, with specific mention of Chanel and Louis Vuitton. 
Pointing out that it makes most sense to cut off the flow of 
illegal goods at the point of origin (China), he added that 
the scale of counterfeiting makes that infeasible.   As a 
result, Lebanese customs is increasing its efforts to prevent 
entry or transit of counterfeit goods. 
 
6.  (U) A/S Wayne detailed continuing USG concerns about IPR 
protection (pharmaceuticals, optical disk piracy, cable TV 
piracy, etc.), noting that Lebanon was named to the Special 
301 Priority Watch List.  Hamadeh acknowledged that Lebanon 
ranked 13th in our report, and that is \"not a good position.\" 
 He added that IPR protection is \"foreign to the Lebanese 
mind,\" and the laissez-faire attitude has gone to 
unacceptable extremes. 
 
7. (U) On the status of the legislation amending the 
Industrial Property Law, Hamadeh said that it is moving 
forward.  Although the Ministry of Health has the lead, it 
involves a wide range of GOL agencies so progress is slow. 
However, he is doing his utmost to keep it moving forward and 
committed to continue his efforts.    (There was no comment 
on whether the MOH would stop registering unauthorized copies 
of pharmaceutical products.) 
 
8. (C) A/S Wayne stressed the need to bring piracy of 
copyrighted material, especially cable TV content and optical 
media, under control and asked what we can do to support GOL 
efforts to combat piracy.  Hamadeh said that in response to 
USG concerns he will personally look into the pirate factory 
reportedly operating in a Hizballah region.  \"I can assure 
you that we are making big efforts in three areas (qualifying 
for WTO and the trade agreements with the EU and GCC).  We 
know this (IPR) is a major battlefield and we will engage. 
We are committed.  However, our means are not always up to 
our determination.  I\'ll put more pressure on, and the Prime 
Minister really wants to do something.\"  In response to the 
offer of USG assistance, he said, \"there are daily visits of 
your people in our Ministry.\" 
 
9.  (U) Note:  over the course of the conversation Hamadeh 
expressed his appreciation for USG support, with specific 
mention of USAID assistance with Lebanon\'s WTO accession and 
USG guidance on cracking down on IPR violations.  He referred 
several times to his close coordination with Embassy Beirut 
and Ambassador Battle.  End note. 
 
Continued Commitment to Counter Terrorist Financing 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10. ( SBU) A/S Wayne thanked Hamadeh for Lebanon\'s strong 
cooperation on the fight against terrorist financing and in 
blocking Iraqi assets.  Hamadeh emphasized that the GOL is 
committed to doing whatever is necessary to prevent the flow 
of terrorist funds through the Lebanese financial system. 
 
11. (SBU) While expressing strong commitment to the fight 
against terrorist financing, Hamadeh asked for USG 
understanding of the nuances of dealing with Hizballah.  He 
stressed that the USG\'s supporters in Lebanon should not be 
pushed to \"perilous choices.\"  He acknowledged  that the USG 
is showing some patience regarding Hizballah, but the people 
consider it successful in removing the Israelis (so do not 
support punitive moves).  He advised that Lebanon should be 
treated with a lot of delicatesse.  \"We should not always be 
penalized for things we are not directly responsible for. 
You have friends in the Middle East.  They deserve to be 
treated with patience and good will.\" 
 
Beirut-Montreal Flight Was Safe 
------------------------------- 
12. (SBU) Hamadeh raised the Canadian government\'s recent 
cancellation of Air Canada\'s Montreal-Beirut flight, saying 
unofficial Canadian channels suggest it was due to USG 
pressure, and that \"we see it as reflecting your view of 
Hizballah.\"  He stressed that Beirut airport is one of the 
safest in the world and that flights from all over Europe 
travel in and out without incident.  The cancellation does 
not stop travel between Montreal and Beirut; people just 
transit Europe.  A/S Wayne responded that we try to be 
understanding, but we consider Hizballah a terrorist 
organization.  (Note:  Cancellation of the Beirut-Montreal 
flight came up frequently during the course of the day, 
always with the knowing assumption that the GOC acted in 
response to USG arm-twisting.  End note.) 
 
MinFin\'s Visa 
------------- 
 
13. (C) On Finance Minister Siniora\'s visa situation, A/S 
Wayne confirmed that we know and respect the work he has done 
to strengthen US-Lebanon ties; that we are conducting a 
thorough review, and expect a determination shortly. 
Hamadeh, who was familiar with the situation, suggested that 
the problem arose during Ramadan when Ministers are inundated 
with requests for charitable contributions at iftar dinners, 
and try to be equitable in contributions to Sunni and Shiite 
charities.  He went into some detail on the history and 
affiliation of various Shiite leaders, making a distinction 
between those who are involved with Hizballah and those, such 
as the one to whom he believes the contribution was made, who 
have distanced themselves from the organization, notably 
Fadlallah (sp?).  Wayne undertook to check on the status of 
USG action on the visa situation. 
 
Looking forward to continued cooperation on Iraq:  tracing 
assets and increasing trade 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
14. (SBU) Lebanese traders are extremely interested in 
getting involved in Iraq, but Hamadeh is urging them to be 
cautious, citing the risk of becoming involved with militia 
or unethical operators.  Ambassador Battle has assured him 
that there is \"no veto\" against participation by Lebanese 
companies in Iraqi reconstruction.  A/S Wayne noted that 
there is not yet a system for coordinating commercial 
facilitation, and suggested the GOL or Lebanese companies 
find a means to participate in the Forum in Baghdad that was 
recently established for such tasks.  He promised to provide 
Hamadeh with a contact point and more information on the 
Forum. 
 
15. (SBU) Hamadeh confirmed that Lebanon will continue to 
cooperate closely in the search for Iraqi assets; will do 
what is necessary to block and return Iraqi assets; and will 
welcome the visit from forensic accountants once that is 
requested by the Iraqi Central Bank.  He revealed that the 
Iraqi Ambassador had tried repeatedly to withdraw large 
amounts of cash from an account (before the freeze was 
announced), but the GOL had limited him to approximately 
$10,000 a month to pay salaries, or to transfers to an 
account in another financial institution (an option of which 
the Ambassador did not avail himself). 
 
Time for a Syria-Lebanon Annex to Road Map 
------------------------------------------ 
 
16. (U) Hamadeh stressed that it is \"high time to think of a 
Syria-Lebanon annex for the Road Map,\" saying that is a view 
that has been conveyed many times to Secretary Powell. 
Bringing in the Syrians would provide a better approach on 
the Palestinian front and a more relaxed situation in Lebanon. 
 
Great Interest in Details of MEFTA 
---------------------------------- 
 
17. (SBU) Hamadeh showed great interest in the details of 
MEFTA (Middle East Free Trade Agreement) and listened closely 
to A/S Wayne\'s description of the President\'s vision.  (Note: 
 based on questions during the panel discussion and 
throughout the day; Hamadeh\'s interest reflects a thirst for 
detail in the region.  End note.)  After hearing A/S Wayne\'s 
explanation of the various methods by which the initial FTAs 
in the region could be expanded, he said Lebanon would 
probably favor the option of cumulative addition of countries 
to existing FTAs.  He explained that Lebanon faces serious 
problems with trade through both Syria and Jordan, saying 
they do not properly implement their FTAs with Lebanon and 
are charging high transshipment duties.  He said the GCC has 
indicated a willingness to include Lebanon in its plans for 
an emerging common market (implying that Lebanon has more in 
common with the trading nations of the Gulf than with its 
immediate neighbors). 
 
18. (SBU) A/S Wayne described MEPI (Middle East Partnership 
Initiative), and praised Lebanon\'s heritage of higher 
education, saying it is unique in the region and probably a 
major reason Lebanon\'s economy has survived as well as it 
has.  Hamadeh responded somewhat grimly that \"we have to 
defend daily that heritage,\" and that there are strong forces 
that continue to resist both education and economic reforms.

19. (U) On the English version of his business card Hamadeh 
spells his name \"Hamad\" (with an accent grave on the final 
e).  He started his working life as a journalist, including a 
stint in Vietnam from 1967-68, and entered parliament in the 
early \'80s.  His past ministerial posts include Tourism, 
Health, and Displaced People.  This is his second stint as 
Minister of the Economy.  Hamadeh is extremely fluent 
English.

GOVERNOR, BANQUE DU LIBAN 
 
 
 1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 
on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in 
Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Fahim Moudad, Deputy Governor 
of the Banque du Liban, discussed the fight against terrorist 
financing; cooperation on Iraq; and the Lebanese economy and 
implementation of Paris II.  End summary. 
 
Cooperation on Combating Terrorist Financing, Tracking Iraqi 
Assets Will Continue 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (SBU) A/S Wayne thanked Moudad for his strong support in 
the fight against terrorist financing and for Lebanon\'s solid 
cooperation in freezing Iraqi Assets.  Moudad responded that 
\"we do our duty,\"  adding that it (participation in the 
international effort) is important to Lebanon\'s financial 
system.  He was extremely receptive to the possibility of 
assisting the forensic accountants sent by the Iraqi Central 
Bank, saying the new Governor \"can ask for anything\" and 
Lebanon will respond. 
 
New Anti-money Laundering Law has Passed 
---------------------------------------- 
3.  (SBU) Asked the status of Lebanon\'s anti-money laundering 
law, Moudad said it has been passed and is working well.  He 
explained that the independent Special Investigation 
Commission provided for in the law has been very effective, 
and he confirmed that banks are reporting suspicious 
transactions to the SIC.  Asked if the USG could provide any 
assistance, he reiterated that systems to prevent 
money-laundering and terrorist financing are functioning 
well. 
 
4. (SBU) Asked his views on the economic situation, Moudad 
said stability is important to investors and to banks.  The 
Central Bank is working to keep confidence in the financial 
system, and he expects to meet requirements of Basel II 
within 2-3 years.  He confirmed that Paris II implementation 
is off to a good start, and that the drop in interest rates 
from 14%-8%, reflects market confidence.  The GOL needs to 
keep the budget deficit under control and to focus on 
privatization and securitization.  (He did not go into detail 
on privatization plans.)

SUBJECT: A/S WAYNE\'S MEETING WITH AHMED MOHAMED ALI 
AL-KHAWI, CHAIRMAN, YEMEN BANKING ASSOCIATION 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a bilateral meeting held June 25 
on the margins of the International Arab Banking Summit in 
Montreal, A/S Anthony Wayne and Ahmed Mohamed Ali al-Khawi, 
Chairman of the Yemen Banking Association (YBA), discussed 
the fight against terrorist financing and Yemen\'s economic 
situation, with a focus on the need to strengthen Yemen\'s 
commercial court system.  End summary. 
 
USG Action 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) Action requests for Mr. Al-Khawi are in para 4 on 
creating a facility for sharing information on bank clients, 
and para 9 on ways to support reform of the commercial court 
system under the Middle East Partnership Initiative (MEPI). 
 
Procedures to Counter Terrorist Financing are in Place 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (U) A/S Wayne commended Yemen on its help thus far in the 
war on terrorism and asked how the new procedures to combat 
terrorist financing are working.  Al-Khawi responded that the 
restrictions on transfers were initially difficult but now 
are going well.  He confirmed that Yemeni bank implementation 
of \"know-your-customer\" efforts is proceeding fairly well. 
Banks are very pleased with the system, as it is helping them 
to avoid many bad debts.  However, many of Yemen\'s banks are 
not well versed in how to implement this and other elements 
of the new anti-money laundering law, and their personnel 
will need assistance. 
 
4. (U) Al-Khawi said the YBA and the Central Bank are 
thinking of creating an information sharing facility for 
banks, as some of the smaller banks have difficulty 
collecting information.  Although there is overall support 
for the idea, a few banks are reluctant to share customer 
information.  A/S Wayne asked if Yemen has a financial 
intelligence unit, and said he thought the USG could provide 
guidance on establishing information sharing procedures to 
facilitate know-your-customer efforts.   Perhaps Yemen\'s 
banks could link into a regional information-sharing 
arrangement?   Al-Khawi said the YBA is planning to introduce 
checks and rial-denominated credit cards, initiatives that 
will also support know-your-customer initiatives. 
 
Anti-Money Laundering Law being Implemented 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) When asked about other aspects of the banks\' ability 
to implement the new anti-money laundering regime, al-Khawi 
noted that the Union of Arab Banks is conducting courses on 
implementing the law.   A/S Wayne reiterated the USG\'s desire 
to be helpful, saying it is important that both sides 
understand the difference in procedures and noting that he 
encourages USG officials to visit Yemen.  Al-Khawi thought 
that would be useful. 
 
Financial Intermediation Still Weak 
---------------------------------- 
6.  (U) A/S Wayne asked about the availability of capital, 
especially for small and medium firms.  Al-Khawi acknowledged 
the problem, but said the World Bank has been supporting 
establishment of an institution making loans to SMEs for the 
past 6 years, and it is doing very well. 
 
No Increase in Informal Transfers 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) There are hawalas in Yemen, but use of the system is 
not growing.  It peaked before the first Gulf War, and most 
transfers now come through banks.  Most Yemeni workers that 
repatriated in the early 1990s have not returned to jobs 
abroad. 
 
8. (U) Al-Khawi said Yemen\'s economy is improving slowly. 
The Yemeni rial is strong and there is no deficit in the ROYG 
balance sheet.  Yemen has 16 banks, three of which (including 
Saba) are Islamic. 
 
Commercial Court Reform is Essential 
------------------------------------ 
 
9. (SBU) When asked how the USG could be helpful, al-Khawi 
stressed the urgent need for experts in Arab law to assist in 
reforming the commercial courts.  A visiting Sudanese expert 
was effective for several years, but the system reverted when 
he left.  Since then, Yemen has endured four years of failed 
efforts to reform the courts.  Resistance to improving the 
commercial court system is probably due to corruption, and 
change will require political commitment from the top.  The 
uncertain legal system means banks try to minimize risk by 
lending only to large, well-known clients.  A/S Wayne 
mentioned the possibility of a program run by the Commerce 
department, using Arab-American experts, that has been 
successful in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia.  The program could 
be included as part of the Middle East Partnership Initiative. 
 
Financial Infrastructure still Shaky 
------------------------------------ 
 
10. (SBU) Al-Khawi identified the lack of a land title system 
as a major obstacle to investment.  Yemenis abroad have 
funds, but hesitate to invest.  On a related topic, long-time 
efforts to introduce a financial market (stock exchange) are 
stalled and even he, as head of the technical committee to 
establish the market, does not know why the ROYG has stopped 
the initiative cold.  Some say it is too early to establish a 
stock exchange in Yemen, but he does not know the source of 
the sudden high-level opposition.

11.  (U)  Al-Khawi was head of the Yemen Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development and is now one of its 
advisors.  His English is fluent but restrained, and he 
weighs his words.

SUBJECT: IAEA/IRAN: CANADIAN VIEWS ON NEXT STEPS 
 
REF: STATE 186962 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Canada would support a summer IAEA Board meeting 
(reftel) so long as there is consensus for a resolution or 
other strong statement at that meeting on the Iranian nuclear 
program.  Ron Stansfield, Foreign Affairs\' Acting Director 
for Nuclear and Chemical Disarmament, told us on July 2 that 
Canada wants to see what comes out of ElBaradei\'s July 9 
visit to Tehran, and that the IAEA technical secretariat is 
coming up with some interesting findings.  If we could deal 
Iran a \"crushing blow\" at an early meeting, then Canada would 
support going forward.  Otherwise, Canada believes we should 
wait for the regular BOG meeting on September 8-12, as there 
is still far to go in getting other Board members to agree to 
a resolution.  Stansfield assured us that Canada would 
continue to push for Iranian compliance with the IAEA, both 
publicly and privately. 
 
2. (SBU) We thanked Stansfield for Foreign Minister Graham\'s 
public statement on Iran  following the most recent BOG 
meeting.  Graham\'s statement, issued on June 20, reads as 
follows: 
 
\"Canada fully supports the outcome of this week\'s discussion 
of Iran\'s nuclear program and applauds the IAEA for its 
excellent work on this issue.  We expect this work will 
continue with the same rigour. 
 
Canada is extremely concerned about the IAEA\'s findings that 
Iran has failed to report nuclear material, facilities and 
activities, as required uncer its Safeguards Agreement with 
the Agency and consistent with its obligations under the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  This is a serious pattern 
of failure that calls into question Iran\'s assurances of full 
transparency and cooperation, and even more so, its 
commitment to nuclear non-proliferation. 
 
Canada joins the Board of Governors in urging Iran to 
demonstrate its full compliance by promptly rectifying all 
problems identified by the IAEA, resolving all questions 
about its nuclear program that remain open, and agreeing to 
other measures sought by the IAEA.  We note the assurances 
that Iran has provided about the peaceful nature of its 
nuclear program.  The clearest possible demonstration of this 
would be Iran\'s early and unconditional acceptance of an 
Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement.\"

SUBJECT: Update 44 - Ontario SARS (July 2, 2003): WHO 
Removes Toronto from List of SARS Affected Areas 
 
 
TORONTO SENDS 
 
Ref:  Toronto 1816 and previous 
 
World Health Organization (WHO) Removes Toronto from 
List of \"Areas with Recent Local Transmission\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
1.In a move anticipated with measured optimism by 
Ontario Health Minister Tony Clement in a July 1 
televised interview, the WHO on July 2 \"removed 
Toronto, Canada, from its list of areas with recent 
local transmission.\"  The WHO used as its measure the 
fact that 20 days  - double the known incubation period 
for SARS - have passed since a new SARS case surfaced 
in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).  Twenty-two active 
probable cases remain in Toronto.  The WHO, however, 
according to spokesman Christine McNab, determined that 
the disease\'s risk to people in the community is 
\"extremely low to zero.\" 
 
2. During Toronto\'s second bout with SARS, locally 
dubbed \"SARS II,\" the WHO did not reinstate its earlier 
travel advisory on Toronto.  However, Toronto\'s 
presence during May and June on the WHO\'s \"local 
transmission\" list delayed public/private sector 
marketing programs to bring travelers back to Canada\'s 
largest city - programs which can now be launched with 
confidence. 
 
Keep up the Guard, Experts Caution 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. Despite the good news, both the WHO and Toronto 
experts such as Dr. Donald Low, Mount Sinai Hospital\'s 
chief microbiologist, are urging continued vigilance. 
The mechanisms of SARS\' spread are still not fully 
understood, and modern hospital settings appear to be 
particularly vulnerable to SARS.  Toronto\'s most recent 
SARS fatality, for example, was a front-line nurse. 
The WHO\'s statement notes that the efficient spread of 
the virus in \"sophisticated hospital settings may have 
contributed to the severity of Toronto\'s outbreak ... 
certain procedures, such as difficult intubation and 
use of nebulizers that are more common in sophisticated 
hospitals, also increas[e] the risk of infection.\" 
 
4. A combination of the CDC and Health Canada\'s review 
of hospital procedures, a just-underway Health Canada 
expert committee examination of infectious disease 
controls, and an Ontario provincial lessons-learned 
exercise should help to fine-tune the \"new normal\" of 
identifying, containing, and dealing with infectious 
diseases, implemented by Ontario\'s Health Ministry last 
month.

TAGS: MOPS, PREL, AF, CA, Afghanistan 
SUBJECT: ISAF: CANADIAN DEFENSE MINISTER\'S VISIT TO 
AFGHANISTAN 
 
REF: OTTAWA 1654 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Canadian Defense Minister John McCallum 
visited Kabul June 23-24 in advance of Canada\'s participation 
in ISAF IV and V.  McCallum met with Afghan President Karzai 
and Defense Minister Khan, among others, and visited the camp 
being set up for approximately 1,800 Canadian troops.  While 
mindful of the security risks, McCallum and Canadian MGEN 
Andrew Leslie, who will be ISAF\'s Deputy Commander, want to 
increase ISAF\'s visibility in Kabul and its interaction with 
the Afghan Government.  They do not, however, believe it is 
feasible to expand ISAF\'s role beyond Kabul without a huge 
infusion of troops.  Canada is also concerned that, with NATO 
taking on the leadership of ISAF, we not lose sight of the 
need for another key national contributor as Germany scales 
back its forces.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) McCallum\'s Executive Assistant Gene Lang and Director 
of Communications Randy Milik, both of whom accompanied 
McCallum to Kabul, debriefed us on the Minister\'s visit. 
Lang and Milik told us that Karzai was impressive, 
charismatic and optimistic about Afghanistan\'s future. 
Karzai reaffirmed that he was committed to meeting the June 
2004 deadline for nationwide elections.  UN Under Secretary 
Jean Arnaud, who also met with McCallum, was quite 
pessimistic about holding to the election timetable. 
 
3.  (C) Defense Minister Khan was more hospitable than 
expected, and appreciative of the Canadian contributions to 
OEF and ISAF.  Lang and Milik said that Khan delivered a 
\"well-rehearsed\" message about his cooperation with Karzai. 
McCallum stressed reform of the military and 
disarmament/demobilization/reconstruction (DDR).  Khan 
concurred that DDR was key, but said it was being delayed by 
lack of funding.  Lang noted the huge disparity between 
Khan\'s militia, numbering approximately 70,000, and the 
10,000 personnel that have been trained thus far for the 
Afghan Army. 
 
4. (C) In a meeting at the Interior Ministry, McCallum also 
discussed the policing challenge in Kabul where, acording to 
Milik, there are only 7,000 police with little training in a 
city of some 3 million.  RCMP officers recently visited Kabul 
and decided against setting up a training program, but 
McCallum told his Afghan interlocutors that he would revisit 
this issue in Ottawa. 
 
5. (C) MGEN Leslie, who joined McCallum for his meetings, 
wants to build stronger linkages between ISAF and the Afghan 
Government.  While the German forces have done an excellent 
job overall, the Canadians believe ISAF can and should be 
more visible, and do more to advise and assist the Afghani 
Government, possibly including liaison officers.  The 
Canadians are not, however, looking to expand the ISAF\'s role 
beyond Kabul.  Lang and Milik told us that the current ISAF 
contingent of roughly 6,000 troops is barely enough to do its 
mission in Kabul, and that tens of thousands of troops would 
be needed to do the same job country-wide.  They estimated 
that 80-90% of the people in Kabul strongly supported ISAF, 
but said that some Al Qaida and Taliban elements are also 
present, including among the large number of refugees flowing 
into the capital. 
 
6. (C) Lang told us that there are currently 250 Canadian 
Forces (CF) personnel in Kabul, and that the deployment of 
equipment and 1,800 total CF personnel is on track for 
completion in mid-August.  The Canadian Forces are acquiring 
four low-flying UAVs (the CF\'s first, prompted by this 
mission) that they will use to help monitor the neighborhoods 
of Kabul.  These Canadian UAVs are expected to arrive in 
October, until which time the Germans will keep their UAVs in 
place. 
 
7. (C) Canada is concerned about ensuring adequate ISAF troop 
strength in 2004, especially as Germany is eager to reduce 
its presence.  Lang told us that the CF (and most other NATO 
militaries) do not have the \"skill set\" needed to run the 
Kabul airport, and that they would encourage Germany to 
continue in this role.  But another NATO country would have 
to step up to the plate as a major contributor in 2004, and 
most likely targets (UK, France, Italy, Spain) have major 
deployments elsewhere and/or have resisted participating in 
ISAF.  Lang and Milik expected that senior U.S. officials, 
such as Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, would need to twist arms 
to find a suitable contributor.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, ECON, PGOV, PREL, CA, Manitoba 
SUBJECT: MANITOBA DAY IN LOS ANGELES 
 
1.  The Canadian Consul General in Los Angeles, Colin 
Robertson, hosted a broad Manitoba trade mission led by 
Premier Gary Doer as a part of the Consulate\'s Canada Day 
celebrations.  The trade mission included announcements of 
several important business deals and entertainment ventures. 
The most surprising announcement was a contract for the sale 
of over 1 million pounds of Manitoban carrots (from leading 
produce trader Peak of the Market) to Western Veg-Produce of 
Bakersfield.  Peak of the Market CEO Larry McIntosh told 
Consul that he couldn\'t believe he was selling carrots to 
California, a traditional carrot exporter.  Maple Leaf 
Distillers also announced plans to expand its distribution 
system to provide spirits and liqueurs (worth some $20 
million annually) to some 2000 outlets in California. 
 
2. On the entertainment front, Manitoba bands were 
highlighted at a top L.A. club in a \"Manitoba Sound Night\" 
featuring Holly McNarland, Doc Walker, McMaster and James, 
and Waking Eyes.  And one of Winnipeg\'s most famous 
citizens, \"Let\'s Make A Deal\" host Monty Hall, was honored 
for his charity work by Manitoba Lt. Governor Peter Liba 
with the Order of Manitoba. 
 
3.  Among the business deals announced were the opening of a 
Los Angeles office by Frantic Films, a film and TV 
production and post-production firm, and a cooperative 
production agreement between the Manitoba Theatre Center and 
the Rubicon Theater in Ventura, which includes an exchange 
of productions between the theaters as well as the co- 
production of a Eugene O\'Neill play.  Winnipeg-based John 
Aaron Productions announced plans with two other U.S. film 
producers for cross-border productions of several films, 
including \"American Woman,\" about Winnipeg\'s own rock band, 
\"the Guess Who.\" 
 
4. COMMENT:  Provincial and city officials realize that  the 
U.S. presents the greatest opportunities for economic 
growth, but also that the lack of awareness in the U.S. 
about Winnipeg and Manitoba is among their greatest 
obstacles.  Events such as \"Manitoba Day\" are less about 
sales but rather represent a concerted effort to raise the 
profile of the region as a business and investment 
destination.  End comment.

1. THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  NOT 
FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE USG CHANNELS. 
 
2. In preparation for the forthcoming meetings of the 
North American Energy Working Group (NAEWG) and U.S.- 
Canada Energy Consultative Mechanism (ECM) in Ottawa 
July 15-17, post provides the following updated 
overview of the very dynamic Canadian energy scene. 
 
 
CANADIAN ENERGY OVERVIEW 
------------------------ 
 
3. Since the early 1980\'s, Canada has been the single 
largest foreign supplier of energy to the United 
States; measured in total energy, it is our number one 
energy supplier by a wide margin.  Canada is the 
world\'s fifth largest energy producer and a net 
exporter of all major energy products including oil and 
petroleum products, natural gas, electric power, 
uranium, and energy technology and services.  The 
United States is virtually Canada\'s sole customer for 
crude oil and natural gas exports, which grew steeply 
over the past decade and a half, as well as its sole 
customer for exports of electric power. 
 
4. Canadian and U.S. government efforts are coordinated 
across the full range of energy-related technologies 
including climate monitoring, carbon sequestration, 
clean coal, hydrogen and nuclear.  Canada has been 
invited to participate in the Carbon Sequestration 
Leadership Forum (CSLF) and the International 
Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE). 
 
5. OIL:  Canada supplies more oil and oil products to 
Americans than any other country, including Saudi 
Arabia.  In 2002 Canada exported approximately 1.4 
million barrels per day of crude oil, plus the 
equivalent of about 500,000 barrels per day in 
petroleum products and partially processed oil.  In 
2002, imports of Canadian oil and petroleum products 
accounted for about about 17 percent of U.S. oil 
imports and nearly 10 percent of total U.S. oil demand. 
 
6. GAS:  Natural gas makes up the largest part - more 
than one-third - of Canada\'s primary energy production. 
In 2002 Canada exported 3.74 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas, making up 93 percent of U.S. gas imports 
and 18 percent of total U.S. gas demand.  (See ref F 
for a Canadian perspective on North American gas supply 
issues). 
 
7. ELECTRIC POWER:  Canada exported about 35 terawatt- 
hours of electric power to the United States in 2002. 
Canada\'s total electricity exports peaked in 2000 and 
are now on a declining trend, due to changes in demand 
patterns, a lack of capital investment in both the U.S. 
and Canadian electric power industries and the 
difficulty of building new transmission capacity (see 
ref N for analysis). 
 
8. NUCLEAR:  Canada is the world\'s largest uranium 
producer (ref A), supplying about one-third of world 
production and 20 to 30 percent of U.S. demand.  A 
Canadian Government-owned firm, AECL, is one of the 
world\'s most active vendors of nuclear reactors, having 
supplied units to China and South Korea in the past 
decade. 
 
9. For further data on Canadian energy production and 
trade, refer to the EIA\'s Country Analysis Brief on 
Canada (www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/canada.html), or the 
GOC\'s National Energy Board website (www.neb.gc.ca). 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIP FOR THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10. Canada has been invited to participate in the IPHE. 
Working-level GOC officials appear to be cautiously 
interested, but have significant concerns about how IPHE 
will relate to the IEA\'s Hydrogen Coordination Group (ref 
B).  They also have numerous questions about IPHE\'s possible 
structure and process. 
 
 
SHIFTING TO OILSANDS AND FRONTIERS 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. Canada\'s conventional oil and gas fields are mainly 
located in or adjacent to the western province of 
Alberta, which is north of Montana.  While the cost of 
finding new reserves in this region has risen 
significantly in recent years, the industry continues 
to thrive, notably in the less-exploited northwestern 
portion of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin which 
extends into the neighboring province of British 
Columbia.  A relatively new energy/mining technology, 
the extraction of oil from oilsands (vast deposits of 
oily dirt) in northern Alberta, became profitable 
during the 1990\'s.  Multi-billion-dollar investments 
are ongoing in that industry.  See paragraphs 16-19 
below for details. 
 
12. The ability of supplies to keep up with North 
America\'s natural gas demand has been the subject of 
recent controversy in Canada, as it has in the United 
States.  There is now broad, well-developed support 
among stakeholders to construct a pipeline down the 
Mackenzie River Valley, which would allow development 
of natural gas fields in the Mackenzie River Delta and 
Beaufort Sea areas (east of Alaska\'s North Slope).  The 
first formal steps toward applying for regulatory 
approval for such a pipeline are expected to be taken 
in the second half of 2003.  While the amount of gas 
which will be accessed by this pipeline is a fraction 
as large as that in Prudhoe Bay, the barriers to 
pipeline development are lower, and the gas could begin 
to reach southern markets around 2010. 
 
13. Substantial oil and gas deposits under the 
continental shelf off Canada\'s Atlantic coast entered 
commercial production in the past decade, highlighted 
by the placement of a large fixed platform on the 
\"Hibernia\" oilfield (east of Newfoundland) in 1997, and 
the inauguration of natural gas exports from Nova 
Scotia to New England through the Maritimes and 
Northeast Pipeline early in 2000. 
 
14. The Hibernia oilfield, which is being exploited by 
a consortium of private oil firms (Exxon/Mobil is the 
operator), is estimated to contain more than 600 
million barrels of oil.  Major oil firms are now 
beginning production from the nearby \"Terra Nova\" 
oilfield, which has reserves of about 300-400 million 
barrels.  Conservative estimates put East Coast 
discovered reserves of oil in the two billion barrels 
range, with possible eventual production rates of up to 
one million barrels per day. 
 
15. Offshore natural gas production from the Sable 
Island area, east of Nova Scotia, began early in 2000. 
Most of this gas is exported to New England - bringing 
large-scale natural gas service to these states for the 
first time, and helping to stabilize their winter 
heating costs.  Gas reserves around Sable Island have 
been estimated at 3.5 trillion cubic feet, but more 
drilling is needed to complete this picture (ref H). 
There are much larger gas resources in Newfoundland and 
Labrador, but environmental and distance problems will 
slow these developments. 
 
 
OILSANDS:  CONTINUING EXPANSION 
------------------------------- 
 
16. The economically recoverable oil resources in 
Alberta\'s oilsands are many times larger than the sum 
of Canada\'s other oil reserves.  Oilsands (aka 
\"tarsands\" or \"heavy oil\") are vast deposits of oily 
dirt which can be processed (economically at current 
oil prices) into \"synthetic crude\" which can then be 
refined in conventional oil refineries.  Canadian 
authorities estimate reserves in the oilsands to be the 
equivalent of 175 billion barrels assuming current 
technology and economic conditions, and up to 315 
billion barrels with technological advances and some 
price increases.  Oilsands already account for more 
than half of Canada\'s crude oil output, and for most of 
the recent increases in Canada\'s production. 
 
17. Crude bitumen production from oilsands increased by 
about 25 percent in 2002, due to large ongoing capital 
investments.  The Canadian government has predicted 
that if currently planned projects are realized, by 
2010 Canada will provide approximately 20.5 percent of 
U.S. oil imports and 14.1 percent of total U.S. oil 
supply.  The Alberta Energy and Utilities Board 
projects that synthetic crude oil production from 
Alberta\'s oilsands will expand by 237 percent from 2002 
to 2012. 
 
18. During the past year, first Oil and Gas Journal and 
subsequently the U.S. Energy Information Administration 
began to recognize Canada\'s oil sands as \"proven 
reserves\" -- a decision which dramatically increases 
Canada\'s petroleum reserves on paper, to about 180 
billion barrels, making Canada the world\'s second- 
largest reserve holder after Saudi Arabia.  While the 
validity of counting the oilsands as \"proven reserves\" 
has been subject to some ongoing controversy (notably 
following a critical item by Jeff Gerth in the New York 
Times on June 18), their economic reality is affirmed 
by the many billions in actual capital investment which 
they are attracting and the resulting current increases 
in oil output. 
 
19. COMMENT:  There is growing confidence among 
Canadian stakeholders and analysts that this resource 
imposes an effective limit on the price which North 
America must pay for overseas oil in the long run, 
absent severe foreign supply disruptions.  Embassy 
shares this view.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
ARCTIC PIPELINES:  MACKENZIE LINE CLOSER TO REALITY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
20. IN RECENT MONTHS, STAKEHOLDERS IN AN ANTICIPATED NATURAL 
GAS PIPELINE DOWN THE MACKENZIE RIVER VALLEY IN NORTHWESTERN 
CANADA HAVE TAKEN FURTHER STEPS TO PAVE THE ROAD FOR A 
FORMAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL.  TRANSCANADA PIPELINES (TCPL), 
ONE OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST PIPELINE OPERATORS, SIGNED A DEAL 
IN JUNE TO PROVIDE FINANCING TO ABORIGINAL PIPELINE GROUP 
(APG), ENABLING APG TO TAKE A ONE-THIRD OWNERSHIP SHARE IN 
THE PIPELINE.  THE MAIN PRODUCING PARTNER IS IMPERIAL OIL, 
THE CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON.  AN INITIAL APPLICATION TO 
REGULATORS IS EXPECTED IN THE FALL OF 2003. 
 
21.  STAKEHOLDERS LESS AND LESS VIEW THE MACKENZIE LINE AND 
ANOTHER, LARGER PIPELINE TO ALASKA\'S PRUDHOE BAY AS BEING 
INCOMPATIBLE.  THIS IS BECAUSE IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY 
LIKELY THAT THE SMALLER AND SHORTER MACKENZIE LINE WILL BE 
CONSTRUCTED FIRST, AND BECAUSE THERE IS INCREASING CONCERN 
THAT NORTH AMERICA\'S DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS MAY OUTSTRIP 
SUPPLIES OVER THE COMING DECADE (REF F).  CANADIAN 
OBJECTIONS TO POSSIBLE FISCAL INCENTIVES TO SUPPORT THE 
ALASKA PIPELINE FOCUS ON THE POSSIBLE MARKET-DISTORTING 
EFFECTS OF SUCH SUBSIDIES - PARTICULARLY IF THEY GO BEYOND 
THE SCOPE OF MEASURES TAKEN TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN OTHER 
GAS PRODUCING REGIONS. 
 
 
ELECTRICITY:  RESTRUCTURING SKIDS IN ONTARIO 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
22. Electric power is primarily under provincial 
jurisdiction in Canada, and is traditionally dominated by 
provincial government-owned firms.  Several provinces have 
taken steps to restructure their electricity sectors on 
competitive principles.  Alberta has achieved a degree of 
competition at both wholesale and retail levels which has 
been characterized as a \"messy success\" (ref J). 
 
23. In Ontario in recent years, the provincial monopoly 
utility was split up into generation, transmission and 
distribution components, and some competition was introduced 
at the retail level.  However, in April 2002 a planned 
initial public offering of the provincial government-owned 
transmission grid operator, Hydro One, was blocked by a 
court ruling.  Transmission grid issues quickly became 
politicized, particularly when power prices rose during the 
peak summer period.  In November 2002, the Ontario 
government froze retail power rates at 4.3 cents/KWH for 
most customers until 2006.  Since then, the government has 
struggled to increase generating capacity with little help 
from private investment.  Re-starting mothballed nuclear 
plants is crucial to its survival strategy, but the first re- 
starts - expected this summer and fall - have been delayed. 
 
24. Canada\'s National Energy Board (NEB) predicts that 
domestic electricity demand will grow slightly faster than 
supply through 2025, causing electricity exports to the 
United States to decline significantly from current levels 
in the long run.  This is driven by the trend for generating 
facilities to be located closer to end users.  One major 
reason for this is the difficulty of constructing new 
transmission capacity due to a range of concerns including 
environmental/agricultural opposition, regulatory hurdles, 
and uncertainty associated with the evolving market 
environment for electric power.  Another is the growing 
availability of natural gas and the efficiency of gas-driven 
generating technology. 
 
25. Canada still has abundant undeveloped hydroelectric 
potential, but these resources tend to be located far from 
densely populated markets.  Provinces with large undeveloped 
sites include Newfoundland and Labrador (Churchill Falls 
II), Quebec (Great Whale) and Manitoba (Nelson River). 
There is significant potential for cogeneration of electric 
power in oilsands operations, but here as well, it will be 
difficult for the resulting power to reach major markets 
unless construction of long-distance power lines becomes 
easier. 
 
 
NUCLEAR:  MOVING FORWARD ON LONG-TERM DISPOSAL 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
26. Like the United States, Canada has no permanent disposal 
facility for its nuclear waste, which is currently stored at 
reactor sites.  As in the U.S., proposals to move this waste 
to any other site(s) provoke strong local resistance. 
During 2002, Canada passed legislation which creates a Waste 
Management Organization, funded by nuclear energy firms, to 
develop a long-term approach to storing radioactive waste. 
The GOC plans to make a decision by 2006 in favor of one of 
the three major options (deep geological storage, 
centralized surface/subsurface, or continued storage at 
reactor sites). 
 
 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
-------------- 
 
27.  In the spring of 2002 the USG and GOC announced a more 
concerted effort to coordinate our climate change programs, 
with a particular focus on energy, especially energy 
efficiency, clean energy, clean coal, renewable and 
alternative energy and carbon sequestration.  At Prime 
Minister Chretien\'s initiative, Canada formally ratified the 
Kyoto Accord at the end of 2002, despite vocal criticism 
from provincial governments and industries (with Alberta and 
the oil and gas sector leading the way - ref L).  Critics 
were concerned that the burden of compliance would fall 
disproportionately on certain regions/industries and also 
that compliance would place Canada\'s economy at a lasting 
competitive disadvantage vis--vis the United States. 
 
28. In its spring 2003 budget, the GOC committed C$1.5 
billion (about US$1 billion) over five years directly to 
achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions, plus modest 
additional funds for research and long-term technology 
development.  GOC officials are now engaged in determining 
what process will be used to allocate this spending.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, EAGR, SENV, CA, Softwood lumber 
SUBJECT: SOFTWOOD LUMBER: A MODEST PROPOSAL 
 
This message is sensitive but unclassified; please treat 
accordingly. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: We appear to be moving toward yet another 
trade-restrictive, time-limited softwood lumber agreement. If 
so, it might be useful to think now about what we could do to 
come up with a more durable solution while the temporary 
measures are in place.  The fact that current trade law 
forces us to focus almost exclusively on Canadian subsidies 
makes it difficult for either the USG or the GOC to address 
adequately the broad range of interests affected by the issue 
(e.g., U.S. producers more concerned by the quantity of 
Canadian lumber entering the U.S. market than by its price). 
Post proposes that a non-binding assessment by the 
International Joint Commission (IJC) of forest practices, 
state of the lumber industry and related issues could provide 
a broader range of options for resolving the dispute than 
would be possible from a purely trade law perspective.  This 
cable also outlines a notional scope of work for an IJC 
study.  End Summary. 
 
Trade Law Inadequate To Meet Producer Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (SBU) Twenty years of trade litigation, export taxes 
and/or import volume restrictions have yet to resolve the 
U.S.-Canada softwood lumber dispute.  Post believes this is 
because existing trade law is too narrowly focused to deal 
with the broad range of concerns and long-term industry 
trends underlying the dispute.  Trade law forces us to look 
almost exclusively at identifying and countervailing Canadian 
forest management practices that directly or indirectly 
subsidize Canadian lumber manufacturers.  U.S. producers 
often argue publicly that all they want is a level playing 
field, with Canadian timber (and hence, 
lumber) prices \"set by the market.\"  Post firmly believes, 
and the recent WTO panel decision on the countervail case 
appears to confirm, that subsidies exist and threaten 
material injury to U.S. producers.  But even if we assume 
that establishing fairness in price competition can be 
achieved through trade litigation, would that be enough to 
satisfy U.S. producer interests?  Four years of intensive 
discussion, debate and economic analysis convince us that 
even if Canadian provinces were to eliminate all subsidies 
and adopt the U.S. public lands model (an unlikely prospect), 
competitive pressure from Canadian imports would be virtually 
unabated for most U.S. softwood lumber firms.  We have seen 
no credible economic studies to the contrary.  In fact, the 
shake-out of poor performers such as BC-based Doman due to 
current U.S. tariffs may actually be strengthening long-term 
Canadian competitiveness. 
 
3. (SBU)  Some U.S. producers have proposed quantitative 
import restrictions, combined with punitive tariffs for 
import volumes exceeding those restrictions.  Their interest 
seems to be in limiting Canada\'s share of the U.S. market in 
order to raise prices and increase profit margins for U.S. 
producers.  This might work were it not for the fact that 
substitute suppliers (New Zealand being the latest to join 
the ranks) and alternative products (structural steel) are 
readily available to fill the gap, keeping lumber prices 
below the level at which some U.S. producers can successfully 
compete.  In short, trade litigation might bring the 
Canadians to the negotiating table, and trade negotiations 
might result in import quotas for Canadian lumber, but 
neither will ensure a healthy U.S. lumber industry over the 
long haul. 
 
4. (SBU)  Other U.S. producers (and some Canadians) say the 
root of the problem is that there is too much lumber flooding 
the market, regardless of source.  They claim that reducing 
annual North American production by ten billion board feet 
would raise prices enough to ensure the long-term health of 
the lumber industry.  They note that such a reduction will 
inevitably happen as the North American industry continues to 
consolidate and integrate.  If this view is correct, the role 
of government would seem to be limited to appropriate 
antitrust surveillance and social safety net support for 
displaced sawmill 
workers, since positive measures to reduce production -- 
e.g., through changes in forestry or environmental policies 
-- risk a strong negative reaction from consumers.  In any 
case, if this \"industry in transition\" argument is correct, 
Post does not see how current trade law or policy tools could 
be used to make the transition smoother or less painful. 
 
A Role for the International Joint Commission? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (SBU) The International Joint Commission has an enviable 
record of success in resolving bilateral disputes, going back 
ninety years.  While its remit has been largely limited to 
environmental matters, its success in resolving sensitive 
boundary water resource management disputes make it a 
reasonable venue for assessment of a dispute over long-term 
management of North America\'s forest resources.  In order for 
such a study to be done under IJC auspices, both the USG and 
GOC would have to finance it and agree on its scope of work. 
When one considers the amount of taxpayer money both 
governments have spent over the past 20 years on litigation, 
discussion and negotiation, a study that broadens the scope 
of interests covered beyond those usually addressed under 
trade law, within limits set by both governments, without 
prejudice to any existing policy, litigation or negotiation 
seems like a bargain.  Further, we believe an IJC study with 
an appropriate scope of work could provide a more creative 
and comprehensive roadmap to resolving the dispute than has 
been 
possible heretofore. 
 
6. (SBU) The IJC could, as directed by both governments, 
contract with independent experts for studies on any or all 
of the following elements: 
 
-- The current state of the lumber industry (binational, 
national, regional); industry trends (binational, national 
and regional); the degree of cross-border integration and 
prospects for further integration or industry consolidation; 
socio-economic impact of integration/consolidation 
(binational, national, regional); global industry trends and 
their impact on the industry (binational, national, 
regional); industry trends in substitute products (global, 
binational, national, regional). 
 
-- Current forest management practices and principles 
(state/province and federal); recommendations for regional or 
species-based best practices; economic impact of current 
practices and recommended best practices by region, nation 
and binationally; environmental impact of current practices 
and recommended best practices by region, nation and 
binationally; species-specific recommendations and 
economic/environmental assessments; economic and 
environmenatl assessments of alternative or complementary 
economic activities 
on forest lands, public and private. 
 
-- Prospects for development of employment alternatives in 
regions identified as most likely to be negatively affected 
by any of the above-mentioned trends or recommendations. 
 
7. (SBU)  We recognize that this would be an ambitious 
undertaking, even for the IJC.  However, faced with the 
prospect of anothe 20 years of doing what we have always done 
and getting the same results over and over again, we believe 
it would be worth doing.  It would certainly show greater 
concern for the interests of the average taxpayer than what 
we have managed to do to date.  Post would welcome comments 
from interested Washington agencies on the feasibility and 
utility of a non-binding IJC study.

SUBJECT: OFFICIAL INFORMAL - DRAFT FOR REVIEW AND ADDITIONS 
 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
1.(U) The following draft cable is being sent to Dr.Barry 
Crane and Richard Baum for their comments. Once post has 
received ONDCP\'s input, we will retransmit the agreed-to text. 
 
2.(SBU) Summary: In a series of meetings with Dr. Barry Crane 
of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
officials from several Canadian government departments set 
out the government of Canada\'s drug control strategy. While 
the GoC appears intent on displaying a more serious approach 
to drug control, it wants to devote more attention to public 
education and studies than enforcement, and the scale of its 
efforts seems inadequate in relation to Canada\'s increasing 
drug problems. End summary. 
 
3.(U) White House Office of National Drug Control Policy 
Deputy Director for Supply Reduction Dr. Barry Crane 
discussed drug control policy with officials from several 
Canadian federal government departments in Ottawa on July 8. 
Dr. Crane visited officials at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Health Canada and 
the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse, the Department of 
Justice, and the Department of the Solicitor General. He also 
held a lunch meeting with members of the Parliament of Canada 
on Parliament Hill. Dr. Crane discussed the broad objectives 
of U.S. drug policy, and concerns about current trends in the 
use of methamphetamine by Americans. The Canadian officials 
described their government\'s new national drug strategy, the 
roles played by their respective departments, and GoC\'s 
proposal that possession of small amounts of marijuana be 
decriminalized. Other U.S. representatives attending the 
meetings were Richard Baum, Branch Chief, International 
Policy and Interdiction, White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy; Tony Pratapas, DEA Attache, U.S. Embassy 
Ottawa; and Mary Witt and Craig Bryant, Political Officers, 
U.S. Embassy Ottawa. 
 
------------------- 
Dr. Crane\'s Message 
------------------- 
 
4.(C) Dr. Crane delivered a consistent message at each 
meeting. While it is not the role of U.S. officials to tell 
Canada what drug policies it should follow, Dr. Crane said, 
it is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect 
its population, and particularly its children, from illicit 
drugs. Noting that Canada is a significant supplier of 
precursor chemicals, used in the illegal production of 
methamphetamine in the U.S., Dr. Crane commented that 
methamphetamine might be more widely consumed in the U.S. 
than cocaine in just a few years. As a result, the USG is 
compelled to take actions to try and limit, if not eliminate, 
the methamphetamine threat. Dr. Crane also noted that high 
potency marijuana presents a similar risk to the U.S. High 
potency marijuana, Dr. Crane observed, is the largest single 
cause of narcotics-related emergency room admissions in the 
U.S. Dr. Crane stressed the need for the U.S. and Canada to 
work vigorously together to safeguard our societies from the 
threat posed by illegal drugs. 
 
5.(C) Turning specifically to GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize 
possession of small amounts of marijuana (Bill C-38, now 
pending in the House of Commons) Dr. Crane noted that the 
problem with decriminalization is that, while we are trying 
to persuade our children to avoid marijuana, Canada\'s 
decriminalization plan sends the message that marijuana use 
is acceptable. For the U.S., Dr. Crane calmly stated, such a 
development on our northern border would necessitate stronger 
U.S. interdiction efforts, in order to protect American 
children. 
 
----------------- 
Canada\'s response 
----------------- 
 
6.(C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) - Ruth Archibald, Senior Coordinator, International 
Crime and Terrorism Division, and Terry Cormier, Director, 
International Crime and Terrorism Division, responded that 
Canada is in the process of renewing its national drug 
strategy. Canadian officials are concerned about the impact 
of illicit drugs on the health of every Canadian, Archibald 
noted. Health Canada will continue to provide leadership and 
coordination for Canada\'s drug strategy, as it has done in 
the past, but DFAIT, Justice Canada, and the Solicitor 
General\'s Department will also be involved in planning and 
executing Canada\'s response to narcotics. Archibald indicated 
that execution of what she termed as Canada\'s \"renewed\" drug 
strategy would proceed independently of the cannabis reform 
bill introduced in May in the House of Commons. 
 
7.(C) Archibald said Canada\'s renewed drug strategy will 
continue to emphasize demand reduction, i.e., public 
education, and will focus on the more vulnerable sectors of 
society in an effort to decrease the number of Canadians who 
try drugs. She said Canada has developed a fair amount of 
expertise, at the federal level, about demand reduction based 
on its programs to deter alcohol abuse and tobacco use. Other 
key components of the new drug strategy, Archibald said, will 
include training programs for law enforcement (one example: 
how to detect marijuana levels in drivers), and increased 
funding for collecting and analyzing drug use data. She 
expressed appreciation for Dr. Crane\'s visit, and said they 
are very interested in learning from our experience. In 
particular, Archibald indicated the Canadians would like 
further discussions with U.S. officials on how we test for 
drug use, how we track drug use among certain populations, 
and our methods for collecting and evaluating data to 
identify drug use trends. (Note and Comment: Archibald and 
other Canadian officials will travel to Washington the week 
of July 14 to discuss Canada\'s drug policy, and particularly 
GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize marijuana, with members of 
Congress. Post was subsequently informed that Solicitor 
General Wayne Easter is requesting a meeting with Attorney 
General Ashcroft the week of July 14, presumably to discuss 
narcotics-related issues. End note and comment.) 
 
8.(C) Health Canada - Dr. Crane met with Beth Pieterson, 
Director General; Cathy Airth, Director for Drug Strategy; 
Carol Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances; Richard Viau, Director of the Drug Analysis 
Service; and Patricia Begin, Director for Research and 
Policy, at the offices of Health Canada. Pieterson led the 
discussion by making clear Canada would continue to approach 
drug abuse primarily as a health issue. She admitted that 
GoC\'s previous drug strategy suffered from inadequate funding 
and attention.  Pieterson said this was not the case now, 
that GoC is committed to providing funding for research, 
rehabilitation and, most importantly, counter-narcotics 
education and messaging. Pieterson said Health Canada is 
studying how best to get its \'don\'t do drugs\' message across 
to Canada\'s youth, and is looking at the approaches followed 
by other countries to determine what has worked, and what 
hasn\'t. She commented that one aspect of Canada\'s strategy is 
to encourage parents to take a more active part in directing 
their children away from drug use. 
 
9.(C) Cathy Airth said the renewal of Canada\'s drug strategy 
had been recommended by the Auditor General of Canada, 
following a review of the federal government\'s past 
expenditures on drug abuse prevention. As a result of this 
review, she indicated the Canadian government plans to almost 
double the amount it spends annually on drug control.  Airth 
repeated that Canada\'s drug strategy would emphasize 
prevention, that they want to reach people before they begin 
using drugs. Dr. Crane noted it is important to emphasize 
both prevention of drug use and law enforcement,that there 
should be a balance. He pointed out that, according to recent 
U.N. drug reports, the U.S. is making progress in reducing 
the demand for illegal drugs by Americans. 
 
10.(C) Carole Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances at Health Canada, then presented an update on the 
implementation of Canada\'s precursor chemical regulations. 
Phase I of the regulations, directed at the importing, 
exporting, production, and packaging of Class A precursor 
chemicals, took effect in January 2003. Phase II of the 
regulations, focusing on domestic transactions in precursor 
chemicals, went into effect July 7, 2003. Bouchard noted that 
under the regulations, the GoC has authority to inspect 
licensed chemical facilities if there is evidence diversions 
are taking place; however, compliance by Canada\'s drug 
importers and manufacturers remains voluntary. She indicated 
Health Canada hopes to obtain additional financial resources 
to carry out further inspections at production facilities. 
 
11.(C) Richard Viau, Director of Canada\'s Drug Analysis 
Service, took issue with U.S. concerns about the increased 
potency of marijuana grown in Canada. Viau said a lab at 
Health Canada regularly measures the potency of marijuana 
seized by law enforcement officers for use in criminal 
trials, and presented a detailed graph reflecting the potency 
of marijuana seized in recent years. Viau indicated the 
majority of the marijuana tested at Health Canada contains 
THC levels averaging 10%; they see very little marijuana 
exceeding a 20% THC level. He acknowledged Canadian growers 
are becoming smarter in terms of choosing the best species, 
methods of cultivation, and the optimal time for harvesting 
the plant. Dr. Crane said he would like to study Dr. Viau\'s 
data more closely. 
 
12.(C) Justice Canada - Dr. Crane met Paul Saint-Denis and 
Donald Piragoff, senior counsels in the Criminal Law Policy 
Section.  Piragoff stated the problem for GoC is that the 
current marijuana law is not respected. He said police 
officers and prosecutors refuse to pursue cases involving 
small amounts of marijuana, and marijuana users know this. 
Saint-Denis said that under the current law, only one of 
every two possession incidents results in a charge by the 
police (he noted that this statistic does not include the 
province of Quebec). The government believes, therefore, that 
decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
will free up law enforcement officers and prosecutors so they 
can devote more attention to large suppliers and grow 
operations. The government also believes the proposed 
marijuana law will be more fairly enforced in all areas of 
Canada, as under the present system non-white and rural 
Canadians are more likely than others to be prosecuted for 
marijuana possession. 
 
13.(C) Saint-Denis noted the percentage of persons using 
marijuana in Canada has increased each year for the past 10 
years. He said the government wants an enforcement mechanism 
and penalty that will work. Under the government\'s cannabis 
reform law, as it is now written, persons found in possession 
of up to 15 grams of marijuana will be given a ticket and 
required to pay a fine, similar to traffic or other health 
and safety violations. If the violator is a minor, parental 
notification will be required. Piragoff cited the example of 
Australia, where enforcement of the marijuana law increased 
significantly after it was revised to permit tickets and 
fines for persons possessing small amounts. Saint-Denis 
suggested that by notifying parents of marijuana violations, 
adults would be encouraged if not forced to take a more 
active role in educating their young. He said he expects C-38 
(the cannabis reform bill) to fully complete the 
parliamentary process before the end of the year. (Comment: 
Post believes Saint-Denis and Piragoff were the principal 
drafters of C-38. End comment.) 
 
14.(C) Solicitor General Canada - Dr. Crane met with a large 
group of officials at the Department of the Solicitor 
General, including Christine Miles, Director General, 
Policing and Law Enforcement; Anita Dagenais, Acting Director 
of Hemispheric Cooperation; Policy Analyst Lyndon Murdock; 
and Superintendent Mike Gaudreau, Director of the Drug Branch 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Miles directed the 
presentation, which repeated Health Canada\'s message that 
Canada views its drug abuse problem primarily as a health 
issue, and that attention and resources should be focused on 
that aspect of the drug problem. She said law enforcement 
does play an essential role not only in supply reduction, but 
also in educating the Canadian public of the harm drugs can 
cause (citing the DARE program as an example of an 
educational program led by law enforcement). Miles noted 
proudly that the counter-narcotics budget for Canadian law 
enforcement will increase incrementally over the next five 
years. She admitted, however, that there is much to be 
learned in the law enforcement area, for example, how to 
assess impaired driving caused by marijuana use. 
 
15.(C) Mills stated that Canada looks forward to assuming the 
chairmanship of CICAD (Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission) in Montreal in November, and welcomed 
opportunities to make the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism 
stronger. Mills said the Office of Solicitor General is 
encouraged by the progress made in addressing Canada\'s 
precursor chemical diversion problem through the enactment of 
new regulations, and that Canada\'s pharmaceutical companies 
are cooperating.  She noted, however, that more needs to be 
done and that, at present, it is difficult to measure the 
success of the new regulations because there \"just has not 
been enough time.\" (Comment: when asked specifically if RCMP 
has been able to initiate prosecutions or make arrests for 
any precursor chemical diversions since the first of this 
year, Gaudreau said no, there have been no arrests or 
prosecutions under the new regulations. End comment.) 
 
16.(C) Canadian grow operations were also discussed during 
this meeting. Gaudreau indicated the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is beginning to work with the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police to develop a more coordinated 
approach to going after \"grow ops\". According to Policy 
Analyst Lyndon Murdock, this is the first time federal and 
provincial law enforcement have had a shared focus on grow 
ops. In the past, the RCMP often had to struggle with the 
attitudes of local law enforcement, which did not look on 
marijuana offenses as a priority. Gaudreau said the RCMP 
intends to utilize the additional resources and officers it 
will receive, as part of the renewed national drug strategy, 
to pursue the organized crime elements which operate grow 
houses. Gaudreau commented that the RCMP might not actually 
receive funding for new operations until early 2004. 
(Comment: DEA Ottawa\'s RCMP sources have indicated that the 
number of drug-dedicated units in Canada has been decreased 
this year. End comment.) 
 
16.(C) It was noted that, under the government\'s cannabis 
reform bill, the maximum prison sentence for conducting a 
grow operation will increase from 7 to 14 years. When asked 
if mandatory minimum sentences had been considered by the 
government, Miles commented that Canada takes a different 
view of incarceration than the U.S. Miles said it is not the 
\"Canadian way\" to impose mandatory minimum sentences, as the 
purpose for incarcerating an offender is rehabilitation, not 
punishment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
A Different View on Parliament Hill 
----------------------------------- 
 
18.(C) Parliament Hill - During a lunch meeting on Parliament 
Hill, members of Parliament had a frank exchange of views 
with Dr. Crane, primarily on C-38. The members present at the 
meeting either have serious reservations about C-38, or are 
outright opponents of it. MP Dan McTeague, the leader of the 
Liberal opponents of C-38, presented a detailed critique of 
the bill. Several members expressed concerned that the House 
leadership will try to push the bill through, regardless of 
the possible consequences for members from more conservative 
ridings. The members voiced their concerns about the negative 
impact decriminalization would have on U.S. - Canada 
relations, and expressed the desire for Dr. Crane and other 
U.S. officials to become involved in the marijuana debate. 
Senator Anne Cools raised the possibility of inviting a U.S. 
drug control official to testify about decriminalization at a 
hearing, and several of the House members present expressed 
interest in this idea. (Comment: The House of Commons is in 
recess and will not reconvene until September.  It is 
uncertain, particularly in light of Prime Minister Chretien\'s 
lame duck status, how hard the government intends to push the 
bill when the House reconvenes. But the bill cannot be 
declared dead yet. End comment.) 
 
------------------------- 
Navigating the Road Ahead 
------------------------- 
 
19.(C) Dr. Crane\'s tour d\'horizon among Canadian government 
officials was informative and useful.  He made clear 
throughout the day that the USG is concerned about the flow 
into the U.S. of Canadian-produced marijuana and diverted 
precursor chemicals, and highlighted that the U.S. must, and 
will, act to stem that flow - for the sake of our children 
and our future. His Canadian interlocutors echoed their 
concerns about the impact that drug abuse, whether of 
marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or alcohol and tobacco, have on 
Canadian children and society at large. However, the Canadian 
officials also emphasized that they intend to address their 
drug demand and supply issues in a way that conforms to their 
style of problem solving. They made it clear that while they 
will listen to U.S. experts and do want to learn from our 
experiences, they will not be lectured to or forced to take 
measures (including abandoning Canadian initiatives) because 
Washington says so. In this atmosphere, post believes Crane\'s 
presentations hit the right balance between learning and 
teaching.  Undertaking research studies is all well and good; 
however, post questions the utility of waiting a year or more 
to complete an academic analysis of a problem when the 
harmful effects of that problem are being experienced now. We 
suggest Canada does not see that the wolf is at the door. 
 
20.(C) We clearly have an uphill battle in front of us. 
Though post thought (perhaps wishfully) that the GoC\'s 
marijuana decriminalization bill had died when the House 
recessed in late June, the bill may well be revived in the 
fall as part of Prime Minister Chretien\'s final push for a 
legacy. The self-selected Liberal Party back-benchers who met 
with Dr. Crane are clearly concerned their Party\'s leadership 
may choose to force C-38 through the House. While Dr. Crane 
said, loudly and clearly, that the U.S. respects Canada\'s 
right to make its own legislative choices, the pleading of 
these MPs for Washington intervention was startling.  They 
obviously feel powerless to oppose their leadership. This 
leads us to wonder whether others, even more influential in 
the Party structure, would pay heed to their constituents if 
the Canadian public at large voices opposition to the 
decriminalization plan. 
 
21.(C) The Canadian approach to the precursor chemical 
diversion problem may be just as worrisome, albeit less 
openly debated. Keeping in mind that U.S. chemical diversion 
regulations and procedures took years to develop and refine, 
we appreciate that 6 months of a new regime is too short a 
time to prove the success of Canada\'s regulations. We regret, 
however, that Canadian authorities have declined offers of 
assistance from U.S. experts on the development of such 
regulations, a decision that could cost the Canadians many 
man-years of valuable lessons learned. 
 
22.(C) Yes, the Canadians will do it their way and we hope 
they will succeed. Perhaps the best way we can help is to 
remain consistent in our message:  we stand ready to help, 
but in the end the U.S. government will do what it must to 
stem the flow of drugs that are produced in or transit Canada 
from crossing the U.S. border.

SUBJECT:  CANADA\'S PROVINCIAL PREMIERS TAKE A STAND 
 
 
1.  Summary:  Canadian premiers met for their annual 
conference on July 9-11 at Charlottetown, Prince Edward 
Island (PEI).  The tone was upbeat.  The premiers went 
beyond the ritual criticism of federal heavy-handedness and 
demands for more funding out of Ottawa and focused on ways 
to make their collective voice better heard.  Their 
frustration over the perceived domination by Ottawa of the 
common agenda provided impetus for their proposal for a new 
Council of the Federation, a regular gathering of the 
provincial and territorial premiers to hammer out common 
positions on the major shared issues facing the provinces 
and territories.  The premiers, buoyed by the welcome 
participation of the newly elected federalist Premier of 
Quebec, Jean Charest, have taken an impressive first step 
toward the establishment of a more balanced consensual joint 
governance.  The GOC has not given the proposed Council much 
consideration, as new leadership will soon take command and 
have to deal with the challenge.  End Summary. 
 
2.  Canada\'s provincial and territorial premiers met July 9- 
11 in Charlottetown, PEI, for their annual gathering. Three 
main themes dominated the discussion:  provincial/federal co- 
operation, the role of the premiers in Canadian-U.S. 
relations, and a more equitable sharing of federal- 
controlled resources in support of provincial 
responsibilities.  The highlight was the group\'s attempt, 
led by newly elected Quebec Premier Jean Charest, to inject 
more provincial input into the national agenda, heretofore 
largely dominated by the federal government.  The vehicle is 
to be a newly created \"Council of the Federation.\"  The goal 
is to give the premiers a forum to discuss and hash out 
common positions on key Canadian issues under their purview 
and, as a result, reassert provincial prerogatives.  The 
thirteen premiers will initially meet alone, excluding the 
Prime Minister and the federal government until the Council 
decides to invite them.  It is particularly noteworthy that 
the impetus for this initiative was the newly elected Quebec 
Premier, Jean Charest, a federalist without the anti-federal 
baggage of some previous Quebecois premiers.  This 
impressive display of national leadership from Quebec bodes 
well for inter-provincial cooperation vis-a-vis Ottawa, 
which has been impeded for at least the past decade by 
Quebecois determined non-participation. 
 
3.  The Council intends, most basically, to improve federal 
and provincial co-operation.  It is a renewed expression of 
provincial strength and unity that may replace the annual 
premiers\' meetings.  The exuberant premiers termed the 
establishment of the Council (which, however, will not 
require an amendment to the Canadian Constitution) as 
approaching in importance the historic 1864 meeting in 
Charlottetown, which set the basic outline for the creation 
of the Canadian Confederation.  Despite the headlines, 
however, it is very much a work in progress, and it is far 
from clear what the Council will do for the ordinary 
citizen.  The follow-up meeting of the premiers and 
territorial leaders on October 24 in Quebec City will 
indicate what kind of legs, if any, the Council has.  It 
will meet perennially and likely have a small secretariat to 
help organize the agenda, but will primarily serve the role 
of a think-tank to help the premiers focus on and consult 
over such issues as health care, inter-provincial trade, and 
mobility rights. 
 
4.  The premiers also discussed their potential role in 
Canadian-U.S. relations.  International affairs have not 
fallen within provincial jurisdiction in the past, but they 
argued that they can act as effective interlocutors with 
their counterparts in the U.S. states.  The Canadian federal 
government, they argue, could use help on the various issues 
that affect the provinces and territories directly, such as 
BSE-related embargoes of Canadian beef, softwood lumber, 
pipeline construction, cross-border pollution, SARS, wheat 
exports, and fisheries.  They contend the governors and 
legislators, including Federal Senators and Congressmen from 
U.S. states that have similar issues, would be more likely 
to be receptive to their arguments than Washington. 
 
5.  The flow of funding from the federal government to the 
provinces has been a constant source of friction. 
Constitutionally, the federal government has greater tax 
powers, but the provinces have the responsibility for 
providing costly services such as roads, health insurance, 
and education.  Typically, after such gatherings, the 
meeting ended with a call for Ottawa to inject an already 
promised C$3 billion into the healthcare system over the 
next two years and to make good on federal promises to top 
this up with some C$2 billion in surplus revenues projected 
for the current year. 
 
6.  Comment:  To claim that the creation of the Council of 
the Confederation will represent a serious challenge to 
federal authority would greatly overstate the meaning of the 
recent provincial premiers\' meeting.  However, Premier 
Charest, throwing Quebec\'s newfound federalist weight into 
the mix, has energized his provincial colleagues and has set 
in train an interesting and potentially significant positive 
development.  This fresh attempt to redefine federal- 
provincial relations, while it may come too late to be 
implemented by the outgoing Prime Minister, will pose his 
successor with an interesting option.  Will he (or she) be 
tempted to underplay this potential challenge to federal 
authority, or be tempted to deal with it in a positive, 
creative manner, one which might well lead toward a 
constructive redefinition of the federal-provincial 
partnership?  Prime Minister Chretien has not responded to 
the proposed Council of the Federation; however, Liberal 
Party leader Paul Martin, the suspected future PM, continues 
to give this proposal thoughtful consideration.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY 
 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
1.(SBU) Summary: In a series of meetings with Dr. Barry Crane 
of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
officials from several Canadian government departments set 
out the government of Canada\'s drug control strategy. While 
the GoC appears intent on displaying a more serious approach 
to drug control, it wants to devote more attention to public 
education and studies than enforcement, and the scale of its 
efforts seems inadequate in relation to Canada\'s increasing 
drug problems. End summary. 
 
2.(U) White House Office of National Drug Control Policy 
Deputy Director for Supply Reduction Dr. Barry Crane 
discussed drug control policy with officials from several 
Canadian federal government departments in Ottawa, on July 8. 
Dr. Crane visited officials at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Health Canada and 
the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse, the Department of 
Justice, and the Department of the Solicitor General. He also 
held a lunch meeting with members of the Parliament of Canada 
on Parliament Hill. Dr. Crane discussed the broad objectives 
of U.S. drug policy, and concerns about current trends in the 
use of methamphetamine by Americans. The Canadian officials 
described their government\'s new national drug strategy, the 
roles played by their respective departments, and GoC\'s 
proposal that possession of small amounts of marijuana be 
decriminalized. Other U.S. representatives attending the 
meetings were Richard Baum, Branch Chief, International 
Policy and Interdiction, White House Office of National Drug 
Control Policy; Tony Pratapas, DEA Attache, U.S. Embassy 
Ottawa; and Mary Witt and Craig Bryant, Political Officers, 
U.S. Embassy Ottawa. 
 
------------------- 
Dr. Crane\'s Message 
------------------- 
 
3.(C) Dr. Crane delivered a consistent message at each 
meeting. While it is not the role of U.S. officials to tell 
Canada what drug policies it should follow, Dr. Crane said, 
it is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect 
its population, and particularly its children, from illicit 
drugs. Noting that Canada is a significant supplier of 
precursor chemicals, used in the illegal production of 
methamphetamine in the U.S., Dr. Crane commented that 
methamphetamine might be more widely consumed in the U.S. 
than cocaine in just a few years. As a result, the USG is 
compelled to take actions to try and limit, if not eliminate, 
the methamphetamine threat. Dr. Crane also noted that high 
potency marijuana presents a similar risk to the U.S. High 
potency marijuana, Dr. Crane observed, is the largest single 
cause of narcotics-related emergency room admissions in the 
U.S. Dr. Crane stressed the need for the U.S. and Canada to 
work vigorously together to safeguard our societies from the 
threat posed by illegal drugs. 
 
4.(C) Turning specifically to GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize 
possession of small amounts of marijuana (Bill C-38, now 
pending in the House of Commons) Dr. Crane noted that the 
problem with decriminalization is that, while we are trying 
to persuade our children to avoid marijuana, Canada\'s 
decriminalization plan sends the message that marijuana use 
is acceptable. For the U.S., Dr. Crane calmly stated, such a 
development on our northern border would necessitate stronger 
U.S. interdiction efforts, in order to protect American 
children. 
 
----------------- 
Canada\'s response 
----------------- 
 
5.(C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) - Ruth Archibald, Senior Coordinator, International 
Crime and Terrorism Division, and Terry Cormier, Director, 
International Crime and Terrorism Division, responded that 
Canada is in the process of renewing its national drug 
strategy. Canadian officials are concerned about the impact 
of illicit drugs on the health of every Canadian, Archibald 
noted. Health Canada will continue to provide leadership and 
coordination for Canada\'s drug strategy, as it has done in 
the past, but DFAIT, Justice Canada, and the Solicitor 
General\'s Department will also be involved in planning and 
executing Canada\'s response to narcotics. Archibald indicated 
that execution of what she termed as Canada\'s \"renewed\" drug 
strategy would proceed independently of the cannabis reform 
bill introduced in May in the House of Commons. 
 
6.(C) Archibald said Canada\'s renewed drug strategy will 
continue to emphasize demand reduction, i.e., public 
education, and will focus on the more vulnerable sectors of 
society in an effort to decrease the number of Canadians who 
try drugs. She said Canada has developed a fair amount of 
expertise, at the federal level, about demand reduction based 
on government programs to deter alcohol abuse and tobacco 
use. Other key components of the new drug strategy, Archibald 
said, will include training programs for law enforcement (one 
example: how to detect marijuana levels in drivers), and 
increased funding for collecting and analyzing drug use data. 
She expressed appreciation for Dr. Crane\'s visit, and said 
they are very interested in learning from our experience. In 
particular, Archibald indicated the Canadians would like 
further discussions with U.S. officials on how we test for 
drug use, how we track drug use among certain populations, 
and our methods for collecting and evaluating data to 
identify drug use trends. (Note: Archibald and other Canadian 
officials will travel to Washington the week of July 14 to 
discuss Canada\'s drug policy, and particularly GoC\'s proposal 
to decriminalize marijuana, with members of Congress. End 
note.) 
 
7.(C) Health Canada - Dr. Crane met with Beth Pieterson, 
Director General; Cathy Airth, Director for Drug Strategy; 
Carol Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances; Richard Viau, Director of the Drug Analysis 
Service; and Patricia Begin, Director for Research and 
Policy, at the offices of Health Canada. Pieterson led the 
discussion by making clear Canada would continue to approach 
drug abuse primarily as a health issue. She admitted that 
GoC\'s previous drug strategy suffered from inadequate funding 
and attention.  Pieterson said this was not the case now, 
that GoC is committed to providing funding for research, 
rehabilitation and, most importantly, counter-narcotics 
education and messaging. Pieterson said Health Canada is 
studying how best to get its \'don\'t do drugs\' message across 
to Canada\'s youth, and is looking at the approaches followed 
by other countries to determine what has worked, and what 
hasn\'t. She commented that one aspect of Canada\'s strategy is 
to encourage parents to take a more active part in directing 
their children away from drug use. 
 
8.(C) Cathy Airth said the renewal of Canada\'s drug strategy 
had been recommended by the Auditor General of Canada, 
following a review of the federal government\'s past 
expenditures on drug abuse prevention. As a result of this 
review, she indicated the Canadian government plans to almost 
double the amount it spends annually on drug control.  Airth 
repeated that Canada\'s drug strategy would emphasize 
prevention, that they want to reach people before they begin 
using drugs. Dr. Crane noted it is important to emphasize 
both prevention of drug use and law enforcement,that there 
should be a balance. He pointed out that, according to recent 
U.N. drug reports, the U.S. is making progress in reducing 
the demand for illegal drugs by Americans. 
 
9.(C) Carole Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances at Health Canada, then presented an update on the 
implementation of Canada\'s precursor chemical regulations. 
Phase I of the regulations, directed at the importing, 
exporting, production, and packaging of Class A precursor 
chemicals, took effect in January 2003. Phase II of the 
regulations, focusing on domestic transactions in precursor 
chemicals, went into effect July 7, 2003. Bouchard noted that 
under the regulations, the GoC has authority to inspect 
licensed chemical facilities if there is evidence diversions 
are taking place; however, compliance by Canada\'s drug 
importers and manufacturers remains voluntary. She indicated 
Health Canada hopes to obtain additional financial resources 
to carry out further inspections at production facilities. 
 
10.(C) Richard Viau, Director of Canada\'s Drug Analysis 
Service, took issue with U.S. concerns about the increased 
potency of marijuana grown in Canada. Viau said a lab at 
Health Canada regularly measures the potency of marijuana 
seized by law enforcement officers for use in criminal 
trials, and presented a detailed graph reflecting the potency 
of marijuana seized in recent years. Viau indicated the 
majority of the marijuana tested at Health Canada contains 
THC levels averaging 10%; they see very little marijuana 
exceeding a 20% THC level. He acknowledged Canadian growers 
are becoming smarter in terms of choosing the best species, 
methods of cultivation, and the optimal time for harvesting 
the plant. Dr. Crane said he would like to study Dr. Viau\'s 
data more closely. 
 
11.(C) Justice Canada - Dr. Crane met Paul Saint-Denis and 
Donald Piragoff, senior counsels in the Criminal Law Policy 
Section.  Piragoff stated the problem for GoC is that the 
current marijuana law is not respected. He said police 
officers and prosecutors refuse to pursue cases involving 
small amounts of marijuana, and marijuana users know this. 
Saint-Denis said that under the current law, only one of 
every two possession incidents results in a charge by the 
police (he noted that this statistic does not include the 
province of Quebec). The government believes, therefore, that 
decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
will free up law enforcement officers and prosecutors so they 
can devote more attention to large suppliers and grow 
operations. The government also believes the proposed 
marijuana law will be more fairly enforced in all areas of 
Canada, as under the present system non-white and rural 
Canadians are more likely than others to be prosecuted for 
marijuana possession. 
 
12.(C) Saint-Denis noted the percentage of persons using 
marijuana in Canada has increased each year for the past 10 
years. He said the government wants an enforcement mechanism 
and penalty that will work. Under the government\'s cannabis 
reform law, as it is now written, persons found in possession 
of up to 15 grams of marijuana will be given a ticket and 
required to pay a fine, similar to traffic or other health 
and safety violations. If the violator is a minor, parental 
notification will be required. Piragoff cited the example of 
Australia, where enforcement of the marijuana law increased 
significantly after it was revised to permit tickets and 
fines for persons possessing small amounts. Saint-Denis 
suggested that by notifying parents of marijuana violations, 
adults would be encouraged if not forced to take a more 
active role in educating their young. He said he expects C-38 
(the cannabis reform bill) to fully complete the 
parliamentary process before the end of the year. (Comment: 
Post believes Saint-Denis  and Piragoff were the principal 
drafters of C-38. End comment.) 
 
13.(C) Solicitor General Canada - Dr. Crane met with a large 
group of officials at the Department of the Solicitor 
General, including Christine Miles, Director General, 
Policing and Law Enforcement; Anita Dagenais, Acting Director 
of Hemispheric Cooperation; Policy Analyst Lyndon Murdock; 
and Superintendent Mike Gaudreau, Director of the Drug Branch 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Miles directed the 
presentation, which repeated Health Canada\'s message that 
Canada views its drug abuse problem primarily as a health 
issue, and that attention and resources should be focused on 
that aspect of the drug problem. She said law enforcement 
does play an essential role not only in supply reduction, but 
also in educating the Canadian public of the harm drugs can 
cause (citing the DARE program as an example of an 
educational program led by law enforcement). Miles noted 
proudly that the counter-narcotics budget for Canadian law 
enforcement will increase incrementally over the next five 
years. She admitted, however, that there is much to be 
learned in the law enforcement area, for example, how to 
assess impaired driving caused by marijuana use. 
 
14.(C) Mills stated that Canada looks forward to assuming the 
chairmanship of CICAD (Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission) in Montreal in November, and welcomed 
opportunities to make the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism 
stronger. Mills said the Office of Solicitor General is 
encouraged by the progress made in addressing Canada\'s 
precursor chemical diversion problem through the enactment of 
new regulations, and that Canada\'s pharmaceutical companies 
are cooperating.  She noted, however, that more needs to be 
done and that, at present, it is difficult to measure the 
success of the new regulations because there \"just has not 
been enough time.\" (Comment: when asked specifically if RCMP 
has been able to initiate prosecutions or make arrests for 
any precursor chemical diversions since the first of this 
year, Gaudreau said no, there have been no arrests or 
prosecutions under the new regulations. End comment.) 
 
15.(C) Canadian grow operations were also discussed during 
this meeting. Gaudreau indicated the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is beginning to work with the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police to develop a more coordinated 
approach to going after \"grow ops\". According to Policy 
Analyst Lyndon Murdock, this is the first time federal and 
provincial law enforcement have had a shared focus on grow 
ops. In the past, the RCMP often had to struggle with the 
attitudes of local law enforcement, which did not look on 
marijuana offenses as a priority. Gaudreau said the RCMP 
intends to utilize the additional resources and officers it 
will receive, as part of the renewed national drug strategy, 
to pursue the organized crime elements which operate grow 
houses. Gaudreau commented, however, that the RCMP might not 
actually receive funding for new operations until early 2004. 
(Comment: DEA Ottawa\'s RCMP sources have indicated that RCMP 
has decreased the number of its drug-dedicated units this 
year. End comment.) 
 
16.(C) It was noted that, under the government\'s cannabis 
reform bill, the maximum prison sentence for conducting a 
grow operation will increase from 7 to 14 years. When asked 
if mandatory minimum sentences had been considered by the 
government, Miles commented that Canada takes a different 
view of incarceration than the U.S. Miles said it is not the 
\"Canadian way\" to impose mandatory minimum sentences, as the 
purpose for incarcerating an offender is rehabilitation, not 
punishment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
A Different View on Parliament Hill 
----------------------------------- 
 
17.(C) Parliament Hill - During a lunch meeting on Parliament 
Hill, members of Parliament had a frank exchange of views 
with Dr. Crane, primarily on C-38. The members present at the 
meeting either have serious reservations about C-38, or are 
outright opponents of it. MP Dan McTeague, the leader of the 
Liberal opponents of C-38, presented a detailed critique of 
the bill. Several members expressed their concern that the 
House leadership will try to push the bill through, 
regardless of the possible consequences for members from more 
conservative ridings. The members also voiced concern about 
the negative impact decriminalization might have on U.S. - 
Canada relations, and expressed a desire for Dr. Crane and 
other U.S. officials to become involved in the marijuana 
debate. Senator Anne Cools raised the possibility of inviting 
a U.S. drug control official to testify about 
decriminalization at a hearing, and several of the House 
members present expressed interest in this idea. (Comment: 
The House of Commons is now in recess and will not reconvene 
until September.  It is uncertain, particularly in light of 
Prime Minister Chretien\'s lame duck status, how hard the 
government intends to push C-38 when the House reconvenes. 
But the bill cannot be declared dead yet. End comment.) 
 
------------------------- 
Navigating the Road Ahead 
------------------------- 
 
18.(C) Dr. Crane\'s tour d\'horizon among Canadian government 
officials was informative and useful.  He made clear 
throughout the day that the USG is concerned about the flow 
into the U.S. of Canadian-produced marijuana and diverted 
precursor chemicals, and highlighted that the U.S. must, and 
will, act to stem that flow - for the sake of our children 
and our future. His Canadian interlocutors echoed their 
concerns about the impact that drug abuse, whether of 
marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or alcohol and tobacco, has on 
Canadian children and society at large. However, the Canadian 
officials also emphasized that they intend to address their 
drug demand and supply issues in a way that conforms to their 
style of problem solving. They made it clear that while they 
will listen to U.S. experts and do want to learn from our 
experiences, they will not be lectured to, or forced to take 
measures (including abandoning Canadian initiatives) because 
Washington says so. In this atmosphere, post believes Crane\'s 
presentations struck the right balance between learning and 
teaching.  Undertaking research studies is all well and good; 
however, post questions the utility of waiting a year or more 
to complete an academic analysis of a problem when the 
harmful effects of that problem are being experienced now. We 
suggest Canada does not see that the wolf is at the door. 
 
19.(C) We clearly have an uphill battle in front of us. 
Though post thought (perhaps wishfully) that the GoC\'s 
marijuana decriminalization bill had died when the House 
recessed in late June, the bill may well be revived in the 
fall as part of Prime Minister Chretien\'s final push for a 
legacy. The self-selected Liberal Party back-benchers who met 
with Dr. Crane are clearly concerned their Party\'s leadership 
may choose to force C-38 through the House. While Dr. Crane 
said, loudly and clearly, that the U.S. respects Canada\'s 
right to make its own legislative choices, the pleading of 
these MPs for Washington intervention was startling.  They 
obviously feel powerless to oppose their leadership. This 
leads us to wonder whether others, even more influential in 
the Party structure, would pay heed to their constituents if 
the Canadian public at large voices opposition to the 
government\'s decriminalization plan. 
 
20.(C) The Canadian approach to the precursor chemical 
diversion problem may be just as worrisome, albeit less 
openly debated. Keeping in mind that U.S. chemical diversion 
regulations and procedures took years to develop and refine, 
we appreciate that 6 months of a new regime is too short a 
time to prove the success of Canada\'s regulations. We regret, 
however, that Canadian authorities have declined offers of 
assistance from U.S. experts on the development of such 
regulations, a decision that could cost the Canadians many 
man-years of valuable lessons learned. 
 
21.(C) Yes, the Canadians will do it their way and we hope 
they will succeed. Perhaps the best way we can help is to 
remain consistent in our message:  we stand ready to help, 
but in the end the U.S. government will do what it must to 
stem the flow of drugs that are produced in or transit Canada 
from crossing the U.S. border.

1.  This message is sensitive but unclassified; please 
protect accordingly. 
 
INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT FOR CANADA 
 
Openness to Foreign Investment 
 
General Attitude 
---------------- 
 
2.  With few exceptions, Canada offers foreign investors full 
national treatment within the context of a developed open 
market economy operating with democratic principles and 
institutions.  Canada is, however, one of the few OECD 
countries that still has a formal investment review process, 
and foreign investment is prohibited or restricted in several 
sectors of the economy. 
 
3.  Canada\'s economic growth depends on foreign investment 
inflows.  The stock of global foreign direct investment in 
Canada in 2002 was US$223 billion, or 32.5% of Canadian GDP. 
In terms of revenue, four foreign-owned firms rank among the 
top ten corporations in Canada and the government estimates 
that foreign investors control about one-quarter of total 
Canadian non-financial corporate assets. 
 
4.  The United States and Canada agree on important foreign 
investment principles, including right of establishment and 
national treatment.  The 1989 FTA recognized that a hospitable 
and secure investment climate would be indispensable if the 
two countries were to achieve the full benefits of reducing 
barriers to trade in goods and services.  The agreement 
established a mutually beneficial framework of investment 
principles sensitive to the national interests of both 
countries, with the objective of assuring that investment 
flowed freely between the two countries and that investors 
were treated in a fair and equitable manner.  The FTA provided 
higher review thresholds for US investment in Canada than for 
other foreign investors, but it did not exempt all American 
investment from review nor did it override specific foreign 
investment prohibitions, notably in the cultural area.  In 
1994 NAFTA incorporated the gains made in the FTA, expanded 
the coverage of the Investment Chapter to several new areas, 
and broadened the definition of investors with rights under 
the agreement.  It also created the right to binding investor- 
state dispute settlement arbitration in specific situations. 
 
Legal Framework: The Investment Canada Act 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  Since 1985, foreign investment policy in Canada has been 
guided by the Investment Canada Act (ICA) that replaced the 
more restrictive Foreign Investment Review Act.  Industry 
Canada is the federal department that administers most 
investments, although the federal department of Canadian 
Heritage administers investments in Canada\'s \"cultural 
industries\" (broadcasting, publishing, audio-visual production 
or sound recording). 
 
6.  The ICA liberalized policy on foreign investment by 
recognizing that investment is central to economic growth and 
is the key to technological advancement.  At the same time, it 
provided for review of large acquisitions in Canada by non- 
Canadians and imposed a requirement that these investments be 
of \"net benefit\" to Canada.  For the vast majority of small 
acquisitions, as well as the establishment of new businesses, 
foreign investors need only notify the Canadian government of 
their investment.  The text of the ICA is available at the 
following web site:  www.investcan.ic.gc.ca. 
 
7.  Investment Canada must be notified of any investment by a 
non-Canadian establishing a new Canadian business (regardless 
of size); acquiring direct control of any existing business 
that has assets of at least C$5 million; or acquiring indirect 
control of any existing Canadian business with assets 
exceeding C$50 million in value.  However, the C$5 million 
threshold was increased to C$223 million in 2003 if the 
acquiring non-Canadian entity is a member of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), and there is no review process for 
indirect acquisition of a Canadian business by any member of 
the WTO (with the exception of foreign acquisitions of any 
size in \"cultural industries\"). 
 
8.   While the ICA provides the basic legal framework for 
foreign investment in Canada, investment in specific sectors 
may be covered by special legislation.  For example, the Bank 
Act administers foreign investment in the financial sector 
that is within federal jurisdiction; investment in Canada\'s 
securities sector is covered under provincial legislation (see 
paragraph 7).  The federal Broadcast Act governs foreign 
investment in radio and television broadcasting.  Under 
provisions of the federal Telecommunications Act, foreign 
ownership of transmission facilities is limited to 20% direct 
ownership and 33% through a holding company, for an effective 
limit of 46.7% total foreign ownership. 
 
9.  Canada\'s federal system of government subjects investment 
to provincial as well as national jurisdiction.  Provincial 
restrictions on foreign investment differ by province, but are 
largely confined to the purchase of land and to certain types 
of provincially regulated financial services.  In addition, 
provincial government policies in the areas of labor relations 
and environmental protection can have an important impact on 
foreign investors. 
 
Special Treatment for US Investment 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  United States foreign investment in Canada is subject to 
the Investment Canada Act, but the NAFTA Chapter 11 further 
defines the investment relationship between the two countries 
and provides national treatment.  Regulation of Canadian 
investors in the United States and of US investors in Canada 
should result in treatment no different than that extended to 
domestic investors within each country.  Both governments are 
free to regulate the ongoing operation of business enterprises 
in their respective jurisdictions under, for example, 
antitrust law, provided they do not discriminate.  This 
principle is based on existing practice, detailed in the 
framework below. 
 
11.  Existing laws, policies and practices were grandfathered, 
except where specific changes were required.  The practical 
effect was to freeze the various exceptions to national 
treatment provided in Canadian and US law, such as 
restrictions on foreign ownership in the communications and 
transportation industries.  Both governments remain free to 
tax foreign-owned companies differently than domestic firms, 
provided this does not result in arbitrary or unjustifiable 
discrimination, and to exempt the sale of crown (government- 
owned) corporations from any national treatment obligations. 
Finally, the two governments retain some flexibility in the 
application of national treatment obligations.  They need not 
extend identical treatment, as long as the treatment is 
\"equivalent.\" 
 
12.  The NAFTA also deals more specifically with the financial 
services sector.  Chapter 14 on financial services eliminates 
discriminatory asset and capital restrictions on US bank 
subsidiaries in Canada and exempts US firms and investors from 
the federal \"10/25\" rule, treating them like Canadian firms. 
The \"10/25\" rule prevents any single non-NAFTA, nonresident 
from acquiring more than 10% of the shares, and all such 
nonresidents in the aggregate from acquiring more than 25% of 
the shares of a federally regulated, Canadian-controlled 
financial institution.  In 2001, the GOC raised the 10% rule 
to 20% for individual (but not corporate) shareholders. 
 
13.  Both the 10% and the 25% limitations were eliminated for 
American investors in federally chartered, non-bank financial 
institutions.  Several provinces, however, including Ontario 
and Quebec, have similar \"10/25\" rules for provincially 
chartered trust and insurance companies which were not waived 
under the FTA. 
 
14.  The NAFTA commits both parties to expand the list of 
covered service sectors and includes a services agreement,  a 
code of principles that establishes national treatment, right 
of establishment, right of commercial presence, and 
transparency for the service sectors enumerated in annexes to 
the NAFTA.  Bilateral services trade is largely free of 
restrictions and the NAFTA ensures that new restrictions will 
not be applied.  However, existing restrictions were 
grandfathered. 
 
15.  The NAFTA grants US firms that operate from the United 
States national treatment for most Canadian federal 
procurement opportunities.  However, inter-provincial trade 
barriers exist which often exclude US firms established in one 
Canadian province from bidding on another province\'s 
procurement opportunities.  As a first step in the ongoing and 
difficult process of reducing trade barriers within Canada, 
the federal, provincial and territorial governments negotiated 
an Internal Trade Agreement that came into effect on July 1, 
1995.  The Agreement provides a framework for dealing with 
trade in ten specific sectors and establishes a formal process 
for resolving trade disputes (but does not apply to US firms). 
 
16.  Besides the areas described above, the NAFTA includes 
provisions that: enhance the ability of US investors to 
enforce their rights through international arbitration; 
prohibit a broader range of performance requirements, 
including forced technology transfer; and expand coverage of 
the Investment chapter to include portfolio and intangible 
investments as well as direct investment. 
 
Investments In \"Cultural Industries\" 
------------------------------------ 
 
17.  Canada defines \"cultural industries\" to include: 
 
-- the publication, distribution or sale of books, magazines, 
periodicals or newspapers, other than the sole activity of 
printing or typesetting; 
 
-- the production, distribution, sale or exhibition of film or 
video recordings, or audio or video music recordings; 
 
-- the publication, distribution or sale of music in print or 
machine-readable form; 
 
-- any radio, television and cable television broadcasting 
undertakings and any satellite programming and broadcast 
network services. 
 
18.  The Investment Canada Act requires that foreign 
investments in the book publishing and distribution sector be 
compatible with national cultural policies and be of net 
benefit to Canada.  Authority for reviewing prospective 
foreign investments resides with the Minister for Canadian 
Heritage.  Takeovers of Canadian-owned and controlled 
distribution businesses are not allowed.  The establishment of 
new film distribution companies in Canada will only be allowed 
for importation and distribution of proprietary products.  (In 
other words, the importer would have to own world rights or be 
a major investor).  Indirect and direct takeovers of foreign 
distribution businesses operating in Canada are allowed only 
if the investor undertakes to reinvest a portion of its 
Canadian earnings. 
 
19.  All investments in newspapers and periodicals require 
Canadian government review.  Authority for reviewing 
prospective foreign investments resides with the Minister for 
Canadian Heritage.  Under terms of an agreement signed in June 
1999, Canada significantly lowered its barriers to foreign 
magazines.  Canada agreed to permit up to 51% foreign equity 
in a magazine enterprise, up from the previous 25%, and to 
increase this level to 100% by June 2000.   As of June 2002, 
US magazines exported to Canada are permitted to carry 18% of 
total ad space with advertising aimed primarily at the 
Canadian market. 
 
20.  Canada also committed to provide non-discriminatory tax 
treatment under Section 19 of the Income Tax Act (eliminating 
the nationality requirement in June 2000), and Canadian 
advertisers may now place ads in any magazine regardless of 
the nationality of the publisher or place of production. 
Canadian advertisers, merchants and service providers may now 
claim a tax deduction for one-half of their advertising costs 
if they place ads in foreign magazines with zero to 79% 
Canadian editorial content.  They may deduct full advertising 
costs if the magazine contains 80% or more original 
(specifically for the Canadian market) editorial content. 
 
21.  The Broadcasting Act sets out the broadcasting policy for 
Canada, the objectives of which include enriching and 
strengthening the cultural, political, social and economic 
fabric of Canada.  The Canadian radio-television and 
telecommunications commission (CRTC) is charged with 
implementing the broadcasting policy.  Under current CRTC 
policy, in cases where a Canadian service is licensed in a 
format competitive with that of an authorized non-Canadian 
service, the commission can drop the non-Canadian service if a 
new Canadian applicant requests it to do so.  Licenses will 
not be granted or renewed to firms that do not have at least 
80% Canadian control, represented both by shareholding and by 
representation on the board of directors. 
 
Investments in the Financial Sector 
----------------------------------- 
 
22.  Canada is open to foreign investment in the banking, 
insurance, and securities brokerage sectors, although, unlike 
the United States, Canada still has barriers to foreign access 
to retail banking.  US firms are present in all three sectors, 
but play secondary roles, while Canadian banks have been much 
more aggressive in entering the US retail banking market 
because there are no barriers that limit access and because it 
offers more promising opportunities for investment than does 
the saturated Canadian market.  Although American and other 
foreign banks have long been able to establish banking 
subsidiaries in Canada, no US banks have attempted to 
undertake retail banking operations in Canada.  Several US 
financial institutions have established branches in Canada, 
chiefly targeting commercial lending, investment banking and 
niche markets such as credit card issuance. 
 
Investments In Other Sectors 
---------------------------- 
 
23.  Commercial Aviation: Foreigners are limited to 25% 
ownership of Canadian air carriers. 
 
24.  Energy and Mining: Foreigners cannot be majority owners 
in uranium mines.  However, there are no specific restrictions 
in other mining investment. 
 
25.  Telecommunications:  Under provisions of Canada\'s 
Telecommunications Act, direct foreign ownership of Type I 
carriers (owners/operators of transmission facilities) are 
limited to 20%.  Ownership and control rules are more flexible 
for holding companies that wish to invest in Canadian 
carriers.  Under these rules, two-thirds of the holding 
company\'s equity must be owned and controlled by Canadians. 
 
26.  Fishing:  Foreigners can own only 49% of companies that 
hold Canadian commercial fishing licenses. 
 
27.  Electric power is primarily under provincial jurisdiction 
in Canada, and is traditionally dominated by provincial 
government-owned firms.  Several provinces have taken steps to 
restructure their electricity sectors on competitive 
principles.  Alberta has achieved a degree of competition at 
both wholesale and retail levels. 
 
28.  In Ontario in recent years, the provincial monopoly 
utility was split up into generation, transmission and 
distribution components, and some competition was introduced 
at the retail level.  However, in April 2002, a court ruling 
blocked a planned initial public offering of the provincial 
government-owned transmission grid operator, Hydro One.  In 
November 2002, the Ontario government froze retail power rates 
at 4.3 cents/KWH for most customers until 2006.  Since then, 
the government has struggled to increase generating capacity 
with little help from private investment. 
 
29.  Health Services: Hospitals in Canada are integral parts 
of a public health system administered by the provinces. 
Private hospitals would not be eligible to receive payments 
from provincial health insurance funds, and, therefore, would 
not be financially viable in most cases. However, the 
provincial health systems have always relied on private sector 
provision of many goods and services, and in recent years they 
have increasingly turned to private firms to supply diagnostic 
services and, particularly in Alberta, routine surgery.  The 
governments of Canada and Alberta have disputed whether the 
latter is permissible under the Canada Health Act.  To the 
extent that private firms are allowed to provide these 
services, U.S.-based companies are well positioned to compete. 
 
30.  Real estate: primary responsibility for property law 
rests with the provinces. Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, 
and Nova Scotia all limit real estate sales to out-of-province 
parties.  There is no constitutional protection for property 
rights in Canada.  Consequently, government authorities can 
expropriate property, but appropriate compensation must be 
paid.  However, US individual investors have been troubled by 
changes in zoning or environmental regulations that affect use 
of their property (ref B). 
 
31.  Privatization: Each specific privatization (at the 
federal or provincial levels of government) is considered on a 
case-by-case basis, and there is no overall policy limitation 
on foreign ownership.  As an example, the federal Department 
of Transport did not impose any limitations in the 
privatization of Canadian National Railway, whose current 
majority shareholders are now US citizens. 
Investment Incentives 
--------------------- 
 
32.  Both federal and provincial governments in Canada offer a 
wide array of investment incentives.  (Municipalities are 
legally prohibited from offering tax incentives.)  None of the 
federal incentives, however, are specifically aimed at 
promoting or discouraging foreign investment in Canada. 
Rather, the incentives are designed to accomplish broader 
policy goals, such as investment in research and development, 
or promotion of regional economies.  They are available to any 
qualified investor, Canadian or foreign, who agrees to use the 
funds for the stated purpose.  Provincial incentives tend to 
be more investor-specific and are conditioned on applying the 
funds to an investment in the granting province.  Provincial 
incentives may also be restricted to firms established in the 
province or that agree to establish a facility in the 
province. 
 
33.  Incentives for investment in cultural industries, at both 
the federal and provincial level, are generally available only 
to Canadian-controlled firms.  Incentives may take the form of 
grants, loans, loan guarantees, venture capital, or tax 
credits.  Incentive programs in Canada generally are not 
oriented toward the promotion of exports.  Provincial 
incentive programs for film and television production in 
Canada are available to and used by foreign firms, so Canadian 
taxpayers have heavily subsidized U.S.-financed productions in 
recent years. 
 
Protection of Property Rights 
----------------------------- 
 
34.  Private property rights are fully protected by Canada\'s 
legal system.  Foreigners have full and fair access to 
Canada\'s legal system.  Only the rights of governments to 
establish monopolies and to expropriate for public purposes 
limit property rights.  Investors from NAFTA countries have 
mechanisms available to them for dispute resolution regarding 
property expropriation by the Government of Canada. 
 
Performance Requirements/Incentives 
----------------------------------- 
 
35.  Canada does not explicitly negotiate performance 
requirements with foreign investors.  For investments subject 
to review, the Canadian Government can examine resource 
processing, domestic content, exports, and technology 
development or transfer.  A special duty remission scheme 
exists for the automotive sector that makes certain benefits 
contingent on trade performance.  NAFTA Article 1106 prohibits 
the United States or Canada from imposing export or domestic 
content performance requirements.  Government officials at 
both the federal and provincial levels expect investors who 
receive investment incentives to use them for the agreed 
purpose, but no enforcement mechanism exists. 
 
Regulatory System: Laws and Procedures 
-------------------------------------- 
 
36.  Canada\'s regulatory system is similar to that of the 
United States in terms of its transparency and broad array of 
institutions involved.  Proposed regulatory laws are subject 
to parliamentary debate and public hearings, and regulations 
are issued in draft form for public comment prior to 
implementation.  While federal and/or provincial licenses or 
permits may be needed to engage in economic activities, this 
kind of regulation is generally for statistical or tax 
compliance reasons.  The Bureau of Competition Policy and the 
Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body, enforce Canada\'s 
antitrust legislation. 
 
Labor 
----- 
 
37.  The Federal government and Provincial/territorial 
governments share jurisdiction for labor regulation and 
standards.  For example, employees in the railroad, airline 
and banking sectors are covered under the federally 
administered \"Canada Labor Code\" while employees in most other 
sectors would come under provincial labor codes.   As the laws 
vary somewhat from one jurisdiction to another, it is 
advisable to contact a federal or provincial labor office for 
specifics such as minimum wage and benefit requirements.  From 
the 1960s to the 1990s, Canada\'s relatively generous federal 
employment insurance and other social programs, combined with 
its high rate of unionization compared to the United States, 
made the Canadian labor force relatively inflexible and kept 
unemployment rates relatively high.  In recent years, however, 
these differences have narrowed, due particularly to the 
restructuring of the employment insurance program. 
 
38.  Due in part to the value of the Canadian dollar relative 
to the US dollar, Canadian wage and benefit levels for most 
non-executive job categories are somewhat lower than levels 
paid in the United States.   In 2001, the proportion of union 
membership among those in paid employment was 32%, which 
reflects a 19% union membership rate in the private sector and 
a 72% union membership rate in the public sector.  This union 
participation rate is about twice that seen in the United 
States. 
 
Expropriation and Compensation 
------------------------------ 
 
39.  Canadian federal and provincial laws recognize both the 
right of the government to expropriate private property for a 
public purpose, and the obligation to pay compensation.  The 
federal government has not nationalized any foreign firm since 
the nationalization of Axis property during World War II. 
Both the federal and provincial governments have also assumed 
control of private firms -- usually financially distressed 
ones -- after reaching agreement with the former owners.  (See 
ref B for more detail on expropriation claims.) 
 
Dispute Settlement 
------------------ 
 
40.  Canada is a member of the New York Convention of 1958 on 
the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. 
The Canadian government has made a decision in principle to 
become a member of the International Center for the Settlement 
of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  However, since the legal 
enforcement mechanism for ICSID would be the provincial court 
system, the federal government must also obtain agreement from 
the provinces that they will enforce ICSID decisions.  It is 
unlikely that this will happen in the foreseeable future. 
 
41.  Canada accepts binding arbitration of investment disputes 
to which it is a party only when it has specifically agreed to 
do so through a bilateral or multilateral agreement, such as a 
Foreign Investment Protection Agreement.  The provisions of 
Chapter 11 of the NAFTA guide the resolution of investment 
disputes between the United States and Canada.  The NAFTA 
encourages parties to settle disputes through consultation or 
negotiation.  It also establishes special arbitration 
procedures for investment disputes separate from the NAFTA\'s 
general dispute settlement provisions.  Under the NAFTA, a 
narrow range of disputes (those dealing with government 
monopolies and expropriation) between an investor from a NAFTA 
country and a NAFTA government may be settled, at the 
investor\'s option, by binding international arbitration.  An 
investor who seeks binding arbitration in a dispute with a 
NAFTA party gives up his right to seek redress through the 
court system of the NAFTA party, except for proceedings 
seeking non-monetary damages. 
 
Political Violence 
------------------ 
 
42.  Although rare, political violence does occur in Canada. 
Serbian demonstrators protesting the air war in Kosovo 
vandalized the United States Consulate General in Toronto in 
1999.  In addition, there have been some violent incidents 
related to trade and environmental disputes. 
 
Bilateral Investment Agreements and Tax Treaties 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
43.  While the terms of the FTA and the NAFTA guide investment 
relations between the United States and Canada, Canada has 
also negotiated international investment agreements with non- 
NAFTA parties.  These agreements, known as Foreign Investment 
Protection Agreements (FIPAs), are bilateral treaties that 
promote and protect foreign investment through a system of 
legally binding rights and obligations based on the same 
principles found in the NAFTA.  Within Canada\'s overall 
foreign investment strategy, FIPAs complement the NAFTA. 
Canada has negotiated FIPAs with countries in Central Europe, 
Latin America, Africa and Asia, and has over 100 international 
tax treaties in force.  Please refer to the following Internet 
web site for more information: www.fin.gc.ca 
 
Capital Outflow Policy 
---------------------- 
 
44.  The Canadian dollar is fully convertible.  The Canadian 
government provides some incentives for Canadian investment in 
developing countries through Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) programs.  Canada\'s official export 
credit agency, the Export Development Corporation (EDC), 
provides OPIC-like insurance coverage for Canadian foreign 
investment.

SUBJECT: CANADA TO CONTINUE TO PRESSURE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA 
 
REF: STATE 200944 
 
1.  (SBU)  Post delivered points contained reftel to Nancy 
Mackay-Dietrich, Special Advisor for Burma in DFAIT,s 
Southeast Asia Division, on July 14, 2003.  Mackay-Dietrich 
indicated that, in addition to the visa restrictions 
mentioned in reftel, the GOC was taking other steps to secure 
the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her National 
League for Democracy party.  She cited the fact that Canadian 
Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham recently repeated his 
call on the Canadian business community to cease further 
investment agreements or commercial ventures in Burma until 
the political situation improves.  Mackay-Dietrich said that 
although the GOC lacked the legal authority to ban investment 
outright, she did feel that Graham was firmly committed to 
decreasing investment levels.  To support this she cited his 
plan to personally call Ivanhoe Mine Ltd, a Canadian company 
that invests heavily in Burma, and urge it to cease its 
business in the country.  Similarly, Mackay-Dietrich doubted 
that the GOC would pass import ban legislation.  She did, 
however, feel that the GOC would communicate directly with 
importers and strongly discourage them from doing business 
with Burma. 
 
2.  (SBU) The GOC is very supportive of ASEAN member states 
working to influence democratic change in Burma. 
Mackay-Dietrich stated that Canada has had ongoing talks with 
both China and Japan, including conversations at the recently 
completed ASEAN meetings in Cambodia, and has urged the two 
countries to take a more formal role in pressuring Burma. 
She also said that Canada agreed that the UN would be an 
appropriate forum for discussion of this issue and mentioned

SUBJECT: FY 2003 IV MRP \"MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY\" EVALUATION 
FOR JEAN-PHILIPPE RACICOT 
 
A.   DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: 21-day multi-regional program 
on \"U.S. Perspectives on Multilateral Diplomacy Issues,\" 
participant Jean-Philippe Racicot, Analyst (U.S.), Western 
Hemisphere Intelligence Assessment Secretariat, Privy 
Council Office, Canada. 
 
B.   DATE, FISCAL YEAR AND QUARTER: May 8-29, 2003; FY-03, 
Quarter three 
 
C.   JUSTIFICATION AND OBJECTIVE: At the time he was 
nominated, Mr. Racicot was one of few international 
observers in Quebec who could claim a solid background in 
defense matters, with expertise ranging from NATO expansion 
issues to North American defense and Iraq\'s weapons of mass 
destruction.  An academic frequently featured on news 
programs, Mr. Racicot gains followers by being able to 
tailor his explanations to his audiences. 
 
Having recently made a transition from academia into the 
federal government, Mr. Racicot will continue to inform 
Canadian policymaking through his keen analysis and 
exploration of international issues. 
 
D.   MPP THEME: National security; economic prosperity; 
    global issues 
 
E.   RESULT/IMPACT:  A U.S. watcher for many years, Mr. 
Racicot had little direct experience with Americans.  For 
him, this international visitor program delivered both 
insightful discussion of U.S. policy and society and 
enlightening first-hand contact with Americans, from neo- 
cons to ultra liberals, from urban elites to ranchers.  In 
addition, he gained from interaction with the diverse group 
of participants in the MRP. 
 
An academic by training, Mr. Racicot appreciated the well- 
prepared briefings the group received from the Council on 
Foreign Relations (he learned more there in an hour than in 
a day of other briefings), the Near East Institute 
(brilliant speaker), and the Georgetown professor who 
offered a condensed course in federalism and civics.  Beyond 
the briefings, Mr. Racicot particularly enjoyed encounters 
with Americans, the hallmark of the IV program, from the 
stimulating discussants at Exxon-Mobil and the Oil and Gas 
Journal to Bubba, the world-traveled Brahman cattle rancher; 
gun shop owners; and the retired viola player who offered 
him home hospitality.  (Mr. Racicot also appreciated the pre- 
program appointments WHA/PD set up for him at the State 
Department and the American Enterprise Institute.) 
 
Mr. Racicot relayed his deep satisfaction with the Houston 
and New York programs as well as his disappointment with the 
Seattle program, where staff at a U.S. Senator\'s office 
provided a superficial briefing and visits to Weyerhauser, 
Starbucks or Boeing did not materialize. He did very much 
enjoy home hospitality in Seattle, however. 
 
Mr. Racicot came home with a sense of the diversity and 
vigor of the United States, and a newfound appreciation for 
the widespread change in attitude towards world affairs 
wrought by the events of September 2001.  The post is 
confident that his experience and the contacts he made will 
make a solid contribution to his ability to interpret U.S. 
policy and events in coming years.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN OFFICIALS DISCUSS DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY 
 
 
Classified By: Pol MC Brian Flora for reasons 1.5(b) and (d) 
 
1.(SBU) Summary: In a series of meetings with Dr. Barry Crane 
of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, 
officials from several Canadian government departments set 
out the government of Canada\'s drug control strategy. While 
the GoC appears intent on displaying a more serious approach 
to drug control, it wants to devote more attention to public 
education and studies than enforcement, and the scale of its 
efforts seems inadequate in relation to Canada\'s increasing 
drug problems. End summary. 
 
2.(U) White House Office of National Drug Control Policy 
Deputy Director for Supply Reduction Dr. Barry Crane 
discussed drug control policy with officials from several 
Canadian federal government departments in Ottawa, on July 8. 
Dr. Crane visited officials at the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), Health Canada and 
the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse, the Department of 
Justice, and the Department of the Solicitor General. He also 
held a lunch meeting with members of the Parliament of Canada 
on Parliament Hill. Dr. Crane discussed the broad objectives 
of U.S. drug policy, and concerns about current trends in the 
use of methamphetamine by Americans. The Canadian officials 
described their government\'s new national drug strategy, the 
roles played by their respective departments, and GoC\'s 
proposal that possession of small amounts of marijuana be 
decriminalized. Other U.S. representatives attending the 
meetings were Richard Baum, Branch Chief, International 
Policy and Interdiction, 
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy; Tony 
Pratapas, DEA Attache, U.S. Embassy Ottawa; and Mary Witt and 
Craig Bryant, Political Officers, U.S. Embassy Ottawa. 
 
------------------- 
Dr. Crane\'s Message 
------------------- 
 
3.(C) Dr. Crane delivered a consistent message at each 
meeting. While it is not the role of U.S. officials to tell 
Canada what drug policies it should follow, Dr. Crane said, 
it is the responsibility of the U.S. government to protect 
its population, and particularly its children, from illicit 
drugs. Noting that Canada is a significant supplier of 
precursor chemicals, used in the illegal production of 
methamphetamine in the U.S., Dr. Crane commented that 
methamphetamine might be more widely consumed in the U.S. 
than cocaine in just a few years. As a result, the USG is 
compelled to take actions to try and limit, if not eliminate, 
the methamphetamine threat. Dr. Crane also noted that high 
potency marijuana presents a similar risk to the U.S. High 
potency marijuana, Dr. Crane observed, is the largest single 
cause of narcotics-related emergency room admissions in the 
U.S. Dr. Crane stressed the need for the U.S. and Canada to 
work vigorously together to safeguard our societies from the 
threat posed by illegal drug 
s. 
 
4.(C) Turning specifically to GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize 
possession of small amounts of marijuana (Bill C-38, now 
pending in the House of Commons) Dr. Crane noted that the 
problem with decriminalization is that, while we are trying 
to persuade our children to avoid marijuana, Canada\'s 
decriminalization plan sends the message that marijuana use 
is acceptable. For the U.S., Dr. Crane calmly stated, such a 
development on our northern border would necessitate stronger 
U.S. interdiction efforts, in order to protect American 
children. 
 
----------------- 
Canada\'s response 
----------------- 
 
5.(C) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) - Ruth Archibald, Senior Coordinator, International 
Crime and Terrorism Division, and Terry Cormier, Director, 
International Crime and Terrorism Division, responded that 
Canada is in the process of renewing its national drug 
strategy. Canadian officials are concerned about the impact 
of illicit drugs on the health of every Canadian, Archibald 
noted. Health Canada will continue to provide leadership and 
coordination for Canada\'s drug strategy, as it has done in 
the past, but DFAIT, Justice Canada, and the Solicitor 
General\'s Department will also be involved in planning and 
executing Canada\'s response to narcotics. Archibald indicated 
that execution of what she termed as Canada\'s \"renewed\" drug 
strategy would proceed independently of the cannabis reform 
bill introduced in May in the House of Commons. 
 
6.(C) Archibald said Canada\'s renewed drug strategy will 
continue to emphasize demand reduction, i.e., public 
education, and will focus on the more vulnerable sectors of 
society in an effort to decrease the number of Canadians who 
try drugs. She said Canada has developed a fair amount of 
expertise, at the federal level, about demand reduction based 
on government programs to deter alcohol abuse and tobacco 
use. Other key components of the new drug strategy, Archibald 
said, will include training programs for law enforcement (one 
example: how to detect marijuana levels in drivers), and 
increased funding for collecting and analyzing drug use data. 
She expressed appreciation for Dr. Crane\'s visit, and said 
they are very interested in learning from our experience. In 
particular, Archibald indicated the Canadians would like 
further discussions with U.S. officials on how we test for 
drug use, how we track drug use among certain populations, 
and our methods for collecting and evaluating data to 
identify drug use trend 
s. (Note: Archibald and other Canadian officials will travel 
to Washington the week of July 14 to discuss Canada\'s drug 
policy, and particularly GoC\'s proposal to decriminalize 
marijuana, with members of Congress. End note.) 
 
7.(C) Health Canada - Dr. Crane met with Beth Pieterson, 
Director General; Cathy Airth, Director for Drug Strategy; 
Carol Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances; Richard Viau, Director of the Drug Analysis 
Service; and Patricia Begin, Director for Research and 
Policy, at the offices of Health Canada. Pieterson led the 
discussion by making clear Canada would continue to approach 
drug abuse primarily as a health issue. She admitted that 
GoC\'s previous drug strategy suffered from inadequate funding 
and attention.  Pieterson said this was not the case now, 
that GoC is committed to providing funding for research, 
rehabilitation and, most importantly, counter-narcotics 
education and messaging. Pieterson said Health Canada is 
studying how best to get its \'don\'t do drugs\' message across 
to Canada\'s youth, and is looking at the approaches followed 
by other countries to determine what has worked, and what 
hasn\'t. She commented that one aspect of Canada\'s strategy is 
to encourage parents to take a mor 
e active part in directing their children away from drug use. 
 
8.(C) Cathy Airth said the renewal of Canada\'s drug strategy 
had been recommended by the Auditor General of Canada, 
following a review of the federal government\'s past 
expenditures on drug abuse prevention. As a result of this 
review, she indicated the Canadian government plans to almost 
double the amount it spends annually on drug control.  Airth 
repeated that Canada\'s drug strategy would emphasize 
prevention, that they want to reach people before they begin 
using drugs. Dr. Crane noted it is important to emphasize 
both prevention of drug use and law enforcement,that there 
should be a balance. He pointed out that, according to recent 
U.N. drug reports, the U.S. is making progress in reducing 
the demand for illegal drugs by Americans. 
 
9.(C) Carole Bouchard, Director of the Office of Controlled 
Substances at Health Canada, then presented an update on the 
implementation of Canada\'s precursor chemical regulations. 
Phase I of the regulations, directed at the importing, 
exporting, production, and packaging of Class A precursor 
chemicals, took effect in January 2003. Phase II of the 
regulations, focusing on domestic transactions in precursor 
chemicals, went into effect July 7, 2003. Bouchard noted that 
under the regulations, the GoC has authority to inspect 
licensed chemical facilities if there is evidence diversions 
are taking place; however, compliance by Canada\'s drug 
importers and manufacturers remains voluntary. She indicated 
Health Canada hopes to obtain additional financial resources 
to carry out further inspections at production facilities. 
 
10.(C) Richard Viau, Director of Canada\'s Drug Analysis 
Service, took issue with U.S. concerns about the increased 
potency of marijuana grown in Canada. Viau said a lab at 
Health Canada regularly measures the potency of marijuana 
seized by law enforcement officers for use in criminal 
trials, and presented a detailed graph reflecting the potency 
of marijuana seized in recent years. Viau indicated the 
majority of the marijuana tested at Health Canada contains 
THC levels averaging 10%; they see very little marijuana 
exceeding a 20% THC level. He acknowledged Canadian growers 
are becoming smarter in terms of choosing the best species, 
methods of cultivation, and the optimal time for harvesting 
the plant. Dr. Crane said he would like to study Dr. Viau\'s 
data more closely. 
 
11.(C) Justice Canada - Dr. Crane met Paul Saint-Denis and 
Donald Piragoff, senior counsels in the Criminal Law Policy 
Section.  Piragoff stated the problem for GoC is that the 
current marijuana law is not respected. He said police 
officers and prosecutors refuse to pursue cases involving 
small amounts of marijuana, and marijuana users know this. 
Saint-Denis said that under the current law, only one of 
every two possession incidents results in a charge by the 
police (he noted that this statistic does not include the 
province of Quebec). The government believes, therefore, that 
decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
will free up law enforcement officers and prosecutors so they 
can devote more attention to large suppliers and grow 
operations. The government also believes the proposed 
marijuana law will be more fairly enforced in all areas of 
Canada, as under the present system non-white and rural 
Canadians are more likely than others to be prosecuted for 
marijuana possession. 
 
12.(C) Saint-Denis noted the percentage of persons using 
marijuana in Canada has increased each year for the past 10 
years. He said the government wants an enforcement mechanism 
and penalty that will work. Under the government\'s cannabis 
reform law, as it is now written, persons found in possession 
of up to 15 grams of marijuana will be given a ticket and 
required to pay a fine, similar to traffic or other health 
and safety violations. If the violator is a minor, parental 
notification will be required. Piragoff cited the example of 
Australia, where enforcement of the marijuana law increased 
significantly after it was revised to permit tickets and 
fines for persons possessing small amounts. Saint-Denis 
suggested that by notifying parents of marijuana violations, 
adults would be encouraged if not forced to take a more 
active role in educating their young. He said he expects C-38 
(the cannabis reform bill) to fully complete the 
parliamentary process before the end of the year. (Comment: 
Post believes Saint-Denis 
  and Piragoff were the principal drafters of C-38. End 
comment.) 
 
13.(C) Solicitor General Canada - Dr. Crane met with a large 
group of officials at the Department of the Solicitor 
General, including Christine Miles, Director General, 
Policing and Law Enforcement; Anita Dagenais, Acting Director 
of Hemispheric Cooperation; Policy Analyst Lyndon Murdock; 
and Superintendent Mike Gaudreau, Director of the Drug Branch 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Miles directed the 
presentation, which repeated Health Canada\'s message that 
Canada views its drug abuse problem primarily as a health 
issue, and that attention and resources should be focused on 
that aspect of the drug problem. She said law enforcement 
does play an essential role not only in supply reduction, but 
also in educating the Canadian public of the harm drugs can 
cause (citing the DARE program as an example of an 
educational program led by law enforcement). Miles noted 
proudly that the counter-narcotics budget for Canadian law 
enforcement will increase incrementally over the next five 
years. She admitted, however, th 
at there is much to be learned in the law enforcement area, 
for example, how to assess impaired driving caused by 
marijuana use. 
 
14.(C) Mills stated that Canada looks forward to assuming the 
chairmanship of CICAD (Inter-American Drug Abuse Control 
Commission) in Montreal in November, and welcomed 
opportunities to make the Multilateral Evaluation Mechanism 
stronger. Mills said the Office of Solicitor General is 
encouraged by the progress made in addressing Canada\'s 
precursor chemical diversion problem through the enactment of 
new regulations, and that Canada\'s pharmaceutical companies 
are cooperating.  She noted, however, that more needs to be 
done and that, at present, it is difficult to measure the 
success of the new regulations because there \"just has not 
been enough time.\" (Comment: when asked specifically if RCMP 
has been able to initiate prosecutions or make arrests for 
any precursor chemical diversions since the first of this 
year, Gaudreau said no, there have been no arrests or 
prosecutions under the new regulations. End comment.) 
 
15.(C) Canadian grow operations were also discussed during 
this meeting. Gaudreau indicated the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP) is beginning to work with the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police to develop a more coordinated 
approach to going after \"grow ops\". According to Policy 
Analyst Lyndon Murdock, this is the first time federal and 
provincial law enforcement have had a shared focus on grow 
ops. In the past, the RCMP often had to struggle with the 
attitudes of local law enforcement, which did not look on 
marijuana offenses as a priority. Gaudreau said the RCMP 
intends to utilize the additional resources and officers it 
will receive, as part of the renewed national drug strategy, 
to pursue the organized crime elements which operate grow 
houses. Gaudreau commented, however, that the RCMP might not 
actually receive funding for new operations until early 2004. 
(Comment: DEA Ottawa\'s RCMP sources have indicated that RCMP 
has decreased the number of its drug-dedicated units this 
year. End comment.) 
 
 
16.(C) It was noted that, under the government\'s cannabis 
reform bill, the maximum prison sentence for conducting a 
grow operation will increase from 7 to 14 years. When asked 
if mandatory minimum sentences had been considered by the 
government, Miles commented that Canada takes a different 
view of incarceration than the U.S. Miles said it is not the 
\"Canadian way\" to impose mandatory minimum sentences, as the 
purpose for incarcerating an offender is rehabilitation, not 
punishment. 
 
----------------------------------- 
A Different View on Parliament Hill 
----------------------------------- 
 
17.(C) Parliament Hill - During a lunch meeting on Parliament 
Hill, members of Parliament had a frank exchange of views 
with Dr. Crane, primarily on C-38. The members present at the 
meeting either have serious reservations about C-38, or are 
outright opponents of it. MP Dan McTeague, the leader of the 
Liberal opponents of C-38, presented a detailed critique of 
the bill. Several members expressed their concern that the 
House leadership will try to push the bill through, 
regardless of the possible consequences for members from more 
conservative ridings. The members also voiced concern about 
the negative impact decriminalization might have on U.S. - 
Canada relations, and expressed a desire for Dr. Crane and 
other U.S. officials to become involved in the marijuana 
debate. Senator Anne Cools raised the possibility of inviting 
a U.S. drug control official to testify about 
decriminalization at a hearing, and several of the House 
members present expressed interest in this idea. (Comment: 
The House of Commons is now i 
n recess and will not reconvene until September.  It is 
uncertain, particularly in light of Prime Minister Chretien\'s 
lame duck status, how hard the government intends to push 
C-38 when the House reconvenes. But the bill cannot be 
declared dead yet. End comment.) 
 
------------------------- 
Navigating the Road Ahead 
------------------------- 
 
18.(C) Dr. Crane\'s tour d\'horizon among Canadian government 
officials was informative and useful.  He made clear 
throughout the day that the USG is concerned about the flow 
into the U.S. of Canadian-produced marijuana and diverted 
precursor chemicals, and highlighted that the U.S. must, and 
will, act to stem that flow - for the sake of our children 
and our future. His Canadian interlocutors echoed their 
concerns about the impact that drug abuse, whether of 
marijuana, cocaine, heroin, or alcohol and tobacco, has on 
Canadian children and society at large. However, the Canadian 
officials also emphasized that they intend to address their 
drug demand and supply issues in a way that conforms to their 
style of problem solving. They made it clear that while they 
will listen to U.S. experts and do want to learn from our 
experiences, they will not be lectured to, or forced to take 
measures (including abandoning Canadian initiatives) because 
Washington says so. In this atmosphere, post believes Crane\'s 
presentations str 
uck the right balance between learning and teaching. 
Undertaking research studies is all well and good; however, 
post questions the utility of waiting a year or more to 
complete an academic analysis of a problem when the harmful 
effects of that problem are being experienced now. We suggest 
Canada does not see that the wolf is at the door. 
 
19.(C) We clearly have an uphill battle in front of us. 
Though post thought (perhaps wishfully) that the GoC\'s 
marijuana decriminalization bill had died when the House 
recessed in late June, the bill may well be revived in the 
fall as part of Prime Minister Chretien\'s final push for a 
legacy. The self-selected Liberal Party back-benchers who met 
with Dr. Crane are clearly concerned their Party\'s leadership 
may choose to force C-38 through the House. While Dr. Crane 
said, loudly and clearly, that the U.S. respects Canada\'s 
right to make its own legislative choices, the pleading of 
these MPs for Washington intervention was startling.  They 
obviously feel powerless to oppose their leadership. This 
leads us to wonder whether others, even more influential in 
the Party structure, would pay heed to their constituents if 
the Canadian public at large voices opposition to the 
government\'s decriminalization plan. 
 
20.(C) The Canadian approach to the precursor chemical 
diversion problem may be just as worrisome, albeit less 
openly debated. Keeping in mind that U.S. chemical diversion 
regulations and procedures took years to develop and refine, 
we appreciate that 6 months of a new regime is too short a 
time to prove the success of Canada\'s regulations. We regret, 
however, that Canadian authorities have declined offers of 
assistance from U.S. experts on the development of such 
regulations, a decision that could cost the Canadians many 
man-years of valuable lessons learned. 
 
21.(C) Yes, the Canadians will do it their way and we hope 
they will succeed. Perhaps the best way we can help is to 
remain consistent in our message:  we stand ready to help, 
but in the end the U.S. government will do what it must to 
stem the flow of drugs that are produced in or transit Canada 
from crossing the U.S. border.

       SAYS INDUSTRY IS \"ON A SOLID FOOTING\" 
 
 
SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE TREAT ACCORDINGLY.  NOT 
FOR DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE USG CHANNELS. 
 
 
SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
-------------------- 
 
1.   On July 8 the GOC announced cuts/changes to its funding 
programs in support of Canadian magazines.  These programs 
were the key measures put in place in 1999 following 
resolution of a U.S.-Canada bilateral dispute concerning 
periodicals.  In making the cuts, the GOC pronounced the 
magazine industry to be \"on a solid footing and enjoying 
healthy growth\" - a striking shift from predictions made in 
1998-99 to the effect that any significant concession to the 
U.S. meant disaster for the Canadian industry.  The GOC also 
adjusted its programs in order to reach more and smaller 
magazines - an open admission that its support measures have 
tended to benefit relatively large, profitable media firms. 
END SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION. 
 
 
BACKGROUND:  THE MAGAZINES DISPUTE 
---------------------------------- 
 
2.   Canada obtained exemptions from the 1989 FTA and 1994 
NAFTA for \"cultural industries\" (media), and the GOC 
continues to maintain a range of policy measures to support 
Canadian-owned \"cultural\" enterprises and encourage/require 
the use of \"Canadian content\" in TV, radio and other media. 
In the mid-1990\'s the United States challenged various GOC 
measures to support Canadian magazines (the so-called 
\"Sports Illustrated\" dispute).  Several of these measures 
were found to be WTO-inconsistent by WTO panels.  Canada\'s 
proposed replacement regime, Bill C-55, which the USG did 
not consider adequate, became the focus of a highly 
politicized bilateral dispute in 1998-99. 
 
3.   The controversy around this dispute in 1998-99 was far 
out of proportion to the modest commercial interests at 
stake for two reasons.  First, Canadian Heritage Minister 
Sheila Copps, who still holds the portfolio, indulged in 
considerable anti-U.S. rhetoric.  She warned publicly of an 
impending \"cultural onslaught\" from U.S. publishers if they 
were to obtain greater access to the Canadian advertising 
market.  Second, Canadian media, which had a direct interest 
in sustaining the GOC\'s cultural protections and subsidies, 
presented the U.S. case less objectively than they might 
have done. 
 
THE 1999 RESOLUTION 
------------------- 
 
4.   Under the terms of an agreement reached in mid-1999, 
U.S. magazines exported to Canada can now fill 18 percent of 
total advertising space with ads aimed at Canadians. Canada 
also committed to provide non-discriminatory tax treatment, 
and to permit foreign ownership of magazine businesses. 
Canada\'s magazine industry obtained a promise of substantial 
direct subsidies to compensate for their reduced level of 
trade protection.  This was introduced in 2000 via the 
Canadian Magazine Fund and Publications Assistance Program, 
which allocated an average of roughly C$70 million (US$50 
million) annually to the industry for three years. 
 
 
NO \"CULTURAL ONSLAUGHT\" 
----------------------- 
 
5.   Following the dispute\'s resolution, Canadian media 
continued to suggest that \"American\" magazines were 
preparing a major drive into the Canadian market against 
which \"Canadian\" magazines were ill-equipped to compete. 
However, contrary to many expectations, there was little 
subsequent pressure from U.S.-based magazine publishers to 
enter the Canadian market. 
 
 
SUPPORT TRIMMED, SINCE INDUSTRY IS \"SOLID\" AND \"HEALTHY\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.   On July 8, Canadian Heritage Minister Copps announced 
changes to the three-year-old direct subsidy programs, 
reducing GOC expenditures on these programs from C$78.1 
million last year (FY 2002-03) to C$61.4 million in three 
years\' time (FY 2005-06).  Copps\' office declared that \"the 
Canadian periodical and magazine industry is now on a solid 
footing and enjoying healthy growth.  Given these 
developments, the Canadian Magazine Fund has been evaluated 
and readjusted to a level that better reflects the Canadian 
industry\'s current situation.\"  It also noted that more than 
50 percent of the periodicals available in the Canadian 
marketplace are Canadian, as are 12 of the 20 most popular 
titles.  Finally, the Ministry restructured its programs in 
order to deliver assistance to a larger number of smaller 
publications - an implicit concession to long-standing 
criticism (from both Canadian and U.S. observers) that, 
while Copps portrayed herself as the defender of small, 
struggling Canadian magazines, it was really large, 
financially sound publishing firms who benefited the most 
from both protection and subsidies. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.   COMMENT:  In retrospect, Minister Copps, and advocates 
for the Canadian magazine industry (and cultural policy more 
broadly), significantly overstated the menace posed by U.S. 
publications to the Canadian industry in 1998-99, and the 
announcement of cuts to GOC support for the industry is a 
virtual admission of this.  Nevertheless, as a direct result 
of the magazines dispute, Copps concluded that WTO panels 
were likely to undermine Canadian cultural protections, and 
that Canada therefore required a \"New International Treaty 
Instrument on Cultural Diversity\" to buttress those 
protections against WTO trade liberalization.  When 
commenting on the GOC\'s drive for such a treaty, we might 
wish to point out that it was originally sparked by fears 
that the GOC now admits were not realized.

1. (U) This is an action request; see para 4. 
 
2.  (C) Post continues to seek information about the TSA 
\"no-fly list (ref. a).\"  Our understanding from discussions 
with TSA is that there is a written policy on the no-fly list 
that describes, among other things, information that is to be 
shared with foreign governments, and with U.S. and foreign 
air carriers.  We also understand that TSA provides the 
no-fly list itself to air carriers worldwide, to certain 
Canadian government officials, and to certain U.S. agencies. 
 
3.  (C) Several agencies at post deal regularly with Canadian 
officials on matters related to terrorism and aviation 
security policy and operations. In addition, the Department 
of Homeland Security Bureau of Customs and Border Protection 
(DHS/CBP) has approximately 400 inspectors serving as 
preclearance officers at seven Canadian airports. 
Preclearance inspectors have observed that, on occasion, 
names that are on the no-fly list have not been found in the 
Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) widely used 
by DHS/CBP inspectors. 
 
4. (C) Action Requests:  Please provide the policy on the 
no-fly list.  We also request that no-fly lists be made 
available on a regular and timely basis to DHS/CBP inspectors 
and other appropriate USG personnel at the Embassy and other 
locations in Canada.

SUBJECT: CANADA: DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MANLEY DROPS OUT OF 
LEADERSHIP RACE 
 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (U) John Manley, Canada\'s Deputy Prime Minister and 
Finance Minister, withdrew from the Liberal Party leadership 
race on July 22, saying that Paul Martin\'s lead is 
insurmountable.  Manley said that his campaign reviewed party 
membership lists over the weekend, and determined that it 
would not have been supported by more than 15-20% of the 
delegates at party caucus meetings in September.  He endorsed 
Paul Martin\'s candidacy, saying that Martin will make an 
excellent Prime Minister. 
 
2. (U) Manley said that his campaign had accomplished its 
mission of putting out his message and ensuring healthy 
debate in the leadership race.  He told reporters that the 
\"numbers aren\'t there for me this time,\" an indication that 
he plans to seek the leadership again in the future.  The 
only other candidate still in the race now is Heritage 
Minister Sheila Copps, who has a small core of supporters in 
the left wing of the party. 
 
3. (C) Paul Martin is expected to win an overwhelming 
majority of delegates to the party leadership convention in 
November, and to take over as Prime Minister some time 
between then and February.  Prime Minister Chretien\'s staff 
maintains that he will not be stepping down until February, 
but he could decide to leave earlier - perhaps after the 
December 5-8 Commonwealth Summit in Nigeria.  Martin is 
expected to seek his own mandate from the voters by calling a 
national election in Spring 2004. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: Given the weakness of the opposition parties, 
the Liberals - Canada\'s only party that is truly competitive 
nation-wide at this point - are expected to win again in 
2004.  Despite Manley\'s strong performance in the Chretien 
Cabinet, including his oversight of U.S.-Canada border 
issues, his candidacy for the party leadership was a long 
shot from the start.  Martin, who served as Chretien\'s 
Finance Minister from 1993 until 2002, had a huge advantage 
in organization and funding, while Manley had little grass 
roots support outside of Ottawa.  Manley also had a difficult 
time differentiating himself from Martin; both are party 
centrists who want to keep the budget balanced and improve 
relations with the U.S. after the strains caused over Iraq. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT CONT\'D:  It is unclear if Martin will keep 
Manley on in a new government.  Manley certainly would not 
remain as Deputy Prime Minister, nor would he have the vast 
portfolio he has held over the past year under Chretien.  But 
his early withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Martin 
increases his chances of being kept on in some capacity.

SUBJECT: UNDOF: DRAWDOWN OF CANADIAN CONTINGENT 
 
REF: (A) STATE 210528 (B) OTTAWA 1779 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Canada confirmed to us that is does intend to reduce 
its contribution to the UN Disengagement Observer Force 
(UNDOF) over the next 12 months, but that it will not do so 
before ensuring adequate backfill by others.  We discussed 
reftel (A) concerns with Barbara Martin, Director of Foreign 
Affairs\' Peacekeeping Division, including reports from third 
parties that Canada plans to withdraw from UNDOF.  Martin 
said that Canada has explicitly told UN, Israeli and Syrian 
officials that Canada intends to draw down, but not withdraw 
altogether, from UNDOF.  Martin said Canada hopes to end up 
with approximately 40 \"front-line observers\" in UNDOF a year 
from now, with Canadian specialty support personnel being 
replaced by other countries, most likely Japan. 
 
2. (C) Martin emphasized that Canada will not take any steps 
that will undermine the UNDOF mission.  She said the GoC will 
be working closely with the UN to identify backfill, and that 
the drawdown of Canadian personnel will be done in 
consultation with the UN.  She said that Japan has expressed 
interest in playing a more prominent role in UNDOF, and that 
Canada\'s decision should give Japan the impetus to move 
forward.  Canada will continue encouraging Japan to do so, 
and will approach other countries as well if needed. 
 
3. (C) Martin said that Canada continues to support UNDOF, 
but that there are a number of other countries capable of 
filling the support roles that the Canadian contingent is now 
providing.  After 30 years in UNDOF, Canada is looking to 
free up such specialty personnel for other missions. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: Given Canada\'s strong commitment to peace in 
the Middle East, we do not believe it will leave UNDOF in the 
lurch.  We will stay in close touch with the GoC over the 
issue of backfill, and would be interested in USUN and 
Embassy Tokyo\'s thoughts on an increased Japanese role. 
Canada\'s drawdown plans reflect a more general desire to 
rationalize the Canadian Forces\' presence, focusing more on 
higher-impact missions.  They also reflect the fact that the 
Canadian Forces are badly overstretched, a problem that is 
being exacerbated by the deployment of 1800 troops to ISAF.

SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: IRAQ; AFRICA; ICC 
 
 
IRAQ 
1.   \"Fallout from Iraq\" 
The centrist Winnipeg Free Press observed (7/8): 
\"...Mr. Bush\'s reasons for going to war may be 
questioned more and more sharply, as next year\'s 
presidential election approaches, if popular support 
for the Iraq invasion ebbs and poor performance of the 
U.S. economy saps confidence in the president\'s 
leadership. In such a context, a conclusion that Mr. 
Bush unwittingly misled the country could be a further 
blow to his political support.\" 
 
2.   \"A casualty of war\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Exaggerating Saddam\'s sins was 
foolish and unnecessary,\" the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen editorialized (7/11): \"...If Mr. Bush knowingly 
cited false intelligence, his credibility is profoundly 
damaged. If he believed in the intelligence because his 
subordinates misled him, the credibility of the entire 
administration is damaged. The ones who 
benefit from the controversy are those who seek to 
delegitimize the deployment of U.S. power. The next 
time Mr. Bush sounds the alarm about a mad dictator or 
terrorist organization, critics will ask why they 
should believe him.... As we and others argued from the 
beginning, Saddam\'s fetish for ugly weapons was only 
one of the reasons why he had to go. Liberating 
millions of Iraqis, and trying to light the spark of 
democratization and reform in the Arab world, were - 
and still are - worthy goals.\" 
 
3.   \"Small Lies\" 
Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(7/12):  \"It has now been proven that 10 Downing Street 
and the White House lied about Iraq. Lied on relatively 
minor points. But that is not what it important.... The 
unilateralism of the American offensive, its real 
justification which was to launch a new and dangerous 
preventive strike strategy, the lack of post-war 
planning and consequently the present situation in 
Iraq...which was predictable and had been predicted by 
the international community tends to give credence to 
an almost brutal thesis: the Bush administration is not 
fit to govern such a big, influential, powerful 
nation.... This administration is showing itself to be 
unable to correctly absorb the long term shock of 
September 11, the toughest ever taken by the Americans 
since the Civil War. Add to this the economic 
quagmire...and you reach a wish, a prayer, a necessity: 
George W. Bush must not be reelected in 2004.\" 
 
AFRICA 
4.   \"Blame America for conflict in Liberia\" 
Writer Gerald Caplan observed in the leading Globe and 
Mail (7/11): \"...The Bush administration now believes 
it needs Africa to combat terrorism, as a giant market 
for American products, and for its abundance of high- 
quality oil. It needs Liberia to be stable. But after a 
century of American-backed regimes and corporations, 
the Liberian people also need to become a nation 
again - an enormously difficult and expensive project. 
Mr. Bush should intervene not out of great humanitarian 
motives, but out of basic accountability. For damages 
knowingly incurred, his country owes Liberians 
compensation in full.\" 
 
5.   \"Trip to Africa\" 
The conservative Saskatoon StarPhoenix commented (7/8): 
\"...While campaigning, Bush complained about how the 
U.S. was overextended overseas. Yet, since being 
elected, he has used the U.S. army more than any other 
president since the Vietnam war but so far has been 
unsuccessful at destroying al-Qaida, catching its 
leaders or even corralling Saddam Hussein. Despite 
this, his stock continues to be high with Americans. 
One wonders, however, how long that can continue. As he 
hops through five African nations this week (adding the 
likes of Senegal, Uganda and Botswana to the list of 
countries - unlike Canada - to which he\'s had a state 
visit), Bush must hope he can deflect attention from 
the final leg of his current mandate.... The 
continent is awash in small and medium arms. Basic 
family and community infrastructures have been 
destroyed by war and disease. Both conditions have 
been made worse by Bush\'s decision to stop aid to 
groups advocating birth control (and hence battling 
AIDS and promoting of women\'s rights in Africa) 
and his withdrawal from global efforts to curb small- 
arms trade. He has further alienated would-be democrats 
by trying to coerce countries (all of 
the Caribbean, for example) which refuse to exempt the 
U.S. from terms of the International Criminal Court. It 
would be dangerous to underestimate the determination 
of Americans to carry the war on terror to a decisive 
conclusion. It would be equally dangerous to believe 
that an American president can indefinitely get away 
with riding the economy into the ground, alienating 
allies and allowing U.S. interests and GIs to get 
picked off one at a time without delivering tangible 
results. Bush\'s African trip promises to be the 
harbinger of an interesting year.\" 
 
6.   \"Going into Liberia\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (7/4): \"The United 
States appears poised to send troops into Liberia at 
the head of a multinational peacekeeping force. 
President George W. Bush says he will not be hurried 
into a decision, but the longer he waits the more dire 
the humanitarian crisis grows.... As the Liberian 
violence escalates, the flood of refugees poses yet 
another threat to regional stability. And here\'s a 
point made by several U.S. experts: Chaos, violence and 
the lack of economic opportunities create a 
prime breeding and recruiting ground for killers and 
terrorists, as the Americans found in Somalia. All of 
this adds up to a compelling case for a U.S.-led rescue 
mission. And the sooner the better.\" 
 
7.   \"\'George Bush, save Liberia\'\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee commented in the leading Globe and 
Mail (7/4): \"In a world ablaze with anti-Americanism, 
the Liberians\' plea for U.S. intervention is more than 
just a curiosity. It is a golden opportunity.... A 
forceful intervention in Liberia by the world\'s 
superpower would demonstrate that the United States is 
genuine when it says that it stands for human rights 
and democracy.... If Mr. Bush listens to his allies and 
does the right thing in Liberia, it will help show that 
his country is indeed a benevolent - not just a self- 
interested - superpower. If he doesn\'t, skepticism 
about American motives will only rise. The UN\'s Mr. 
Annan put it best: All eyes, he said, are on the United 
States.\" 
 
ICC 
8.   \"U.S. speaks loudly and carries a big stick to 
dodge international court\" 
Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe wrote in the left-of- 
center Vancouver Sun (7/10): \"...Having failed to 
convince much of the world that the International 
Criminal Court, established a year ago in the Hague, is 
a dangerous piece of political tomfoolery, Washington 
has moved to arm-twisting and bribery to limit the 
court\'s effectiveness. The administration of President 
George W. Bush, with the backing of Congress, intends 
to withdraw military aid to about 37 of its allies 
because they refuse to exempt American servicemen and 
women from possible prosecution by 
the ICC.... If the reaction to America\'s attempt to 
protect its people is over the top, so too is 
Washington\'s analysis of the dangers of the 
international court. The Rome treaty is full of 
safeguards - many injected by the U.S. - against 
frivolous, politically inspired prosecutions. 
Moreover, the court is designed to function only in 
those areas where national governments are unwilling or 
unable to act. The court is staffed by highly qualified 
judges and prosecutors, none of whom wants to waste 
time or effort on anti-American witch hunts. The 
court\'s concern is systematic abuses of human rights in 
places where local people have no other recourse to 
justice. So its focus is on places like the Balkans, 
Congo, Burma and West Africa. It would be a travesty if 
this valuable effort at justice-without-borders was 
undermined because of hysterical political 
campaigns on both sides.\"

TAGS: PREL, PHUM, IR, CA, Iran 
SUBJECT: CANADA RECALLS AMBASSADOR FROM IRAN OVER 
JOURNALIST\'S DEATH 
 
REF: OTTAWA 1875 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (U) Foreign Minister Graham announced on July 23 that 
Canada is recalling its Ambassador to Iran after Iran 
proceeded to bury photojournalist Zahra Kazemi rather than 
return her body to Canada.  Kazemi\'s son in Montreal had 
called for the body to be returned to Canada, and Graham said 
that Kazemi\'s mother requested this as well at the Canadian 
Embassy in Tehran, but that Iranian authorities forced her to 
proceed with a burial in Iran.  Graham described this case as 
part of a bigger struggle between Iran\'s 
police/judicial/religious authorities on the one hand and the 
Khatami Government on the other. 
 
2. (U) Kazemi, who was born in Iran but has Canadian 
citizenship and is based in Montreal, was detained on June 23 
after taking (forbidden) photographs of a prison north of 
Tehran.  According to a report issued by the Iranian 
Government, Kazemi went through 77 hours of interrogation by 
police, prosecutors and intelligence officials before being 
hospitalized on June 27.  She died on July 10 from a \"blow to 
the head by a hard object,\" a blow delivered on June 25 or 
26.  Iranian President Khatami commissioned the inquiry which 
produced this report, and which also recommended an 
independent judge be appointed to identify those responsible. 
 
3. (C) Chrystiane Roy, Foreign Affairs\' Desk Officer for 
Iran, told us that Canada is now reviewing all aspects of its 
relations with Iran, which the GoC had previously described 
as \"controlled engagement.\"  The Canadian Embassy will remain 
open and there will be no break in relations, but Roy 
expected a decrease in Ministerial contacts, official visits, 
and cooperation with Iran in international fora, as well as 
possible action in the UN Human Rights Commission.  She said 
that the GoC would determine triggers for the return of its 
Ambassador to Tehran, probably including action against those 
responsible for Kazemi\'s death. 
 
4. (C) Roy said that the Kazemi case has become a lightening 
rod in the power struggle now going on in Iran.  She viewed 
the Khatami Government\'s extraordinary response - holding an 
inquiry, admitting the death was caused by a blow to the head 
while in custody, and posting the report on the Government\'s 
website - as an effort to deal a blow to anti-reform forces. 
She added that Iranian Government officials have been helpful 
to the Canadian Embassy in this case, but that they do not 
recognize dual citizenship and so are officially treating 
this as an internal matter.  Kazemi never renounced her 
Iranian citizenship, and had travelled to Iran on her Iranian 
passport. 
 
5. (C) Roy was pleased that Prosecutor General for Tehran 
Mortazavi (aka \"the butcher of journalists\"), who was present 
at Kazemi\'s interrogation and had initially been named to 
pursue the inquiry, had withdrawn in favor of a military 
prosecutor.  But she still expected Iran\'s judiciary, 
controlled by the clerics, to thwart the process. 
 
6. (C) COMMENT: By taking the rare step of recalling its 
Ambassador, Canada has underscored the seriousness of the 
Kazemi case.  Canada has long maintained that its \"controlled 
engagement\" with Iran allows it to make a positive impact in 
Tehran (similar to its Cuba policy), but the circumstances of 
the death of this Canadian citizen could not be ignored.  Her 
burial in Tehran, against her family\'s wishes and limiting 
further investigation, was the last straw.  The fact that 
Canada is extremely concerned about Iran\'s nuclear weapons 
program (reftel) will also be factored into its reassessment 
of the relationship.

BARADEI REPORT BUT DOUBTS AUGUST 15 IS DOABLE 
 
REF: (A) STATE 210913 (B) OTTAWA 1670 (C) OTTAWA 2109 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Canada agrees with us that the IAEA Director General\'s 
next report on Iran needs to be issued prior to August 29 in 
order to mount an effective campaign before the September 
8-12 Board of Governors meeting (ref. A), but believes that 
August 15 may not be feasible.  Terry Wood, Foreign Affairs\' 
Deputy Director for Non-Proliferation, told us on July 23 
that the extended absences of El Baradei and of Deputy DG 
Goldschmidt (who will be returning from leave on August 18) 
and the need for a thorough report will make it difficult for 
the IAEA to proceed two weeks earlier.  But Wood said that we 
must have more time to prepare for this BOG meeting than we 
had in June, when the DG\'s Iran report came out on the 6th 
and the BOG meeting was held on the 16th.  Exactly how far in 
advance of August 29 is the challenge. 
 
2. (S) Wood said that Canada has an added complication if the 
DG\'s report is moved up to August 15.  Another GoC agency is 
preparing to provide \"sensitive information\" on Iran to the 
IAEA Secretariat, and had not planned to do so before 
mid-August (the Secretariat\'s informal deadline for 
submissions to be considered in the report is August 15). 
Wood was unsure whether or how much the sharing of this 
information, which was out of Foreign Affairs\' hands, could 
be accelerated.  Wood was not suggesting the report be held 
up on account of this, but said that Canada wanted to bring 
the information to bear on the report if at all possible. 
(NOTE: Canada has not previously shared intelligence with the 
IAEA, and is grappling with how to do so.  The GoC has 
informed us (ref. B) that it has intelligence from the late 
1990s regarding nuclear activity at Kalaye.  END NOTE.) 
 
3. (C) The GoC continues to push both the Iranian Government 
and the IAEA on full disclosure and full accountability. 
Wood said that Canada\'s Ambassador in Vienna is meeting with 
IAEA Acting DG Waller on July 24 to reiterate Canadian 
concerns, including moving up issuance of the Iran report, 
maintaining a rigorous approach to inspections, and using all 
the IAEA\'s tools, including special inspections.  Wood told a 
Secretariat official earlier this month that if Iran did not 
 
SIPDIS 
agree to environmental sampling at Kalaye, Canada would push 
for a special inspection to be conducted there.  Wood was 
preparing a letter from Minister Graham to El Baradei 
reiterating these messages, and said that Graham discussed 
Canadian concerns again this month with Iranian FM Kharazzi. 
He noted that Canadian access in Tehran will be more limited 
now that the Canadian Ambassador has been recalled over the 
death in custody of Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi 
(ref. C). 
 
4. (C) Overall, Wood was pessimistic about bringing Iran 
around.  He noted that experts who travelled with El Baradei 
to Iran this month had returned early because of the lack of 
cooperation by the Iranians.  Wood said that the IAEA\'s 
investigation was showing additional Iranian work with 
nuclear materials that had not been declared.

E.O. 12958:  N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, CA 
SUBJECT:  CANADA\'S FIRST NATIONS ELECT A NEW GRAND CHIEF; 
PATH OPEN FOR A RENEWED DIALOGUE WITH OTTAWA 
 
1.  Summary:  Canada\'s Assembly of First Nations (AFN) met 
for their 24th annual meeting on July 15-17 and elected Phil 
Fontaine to a three-year term as National Grand Chief. 
Chief Fontaine, a self-described conciliator, brings a less 
confrontational style than his predecessor, Matthew Coon 
Come, to First Nation relations with the federal government. 
He is, however, on record as opposing the First Nations 
Governance Act, one of three First Nations bills currently 
under consideration by Parliament.  Some politicians, and 
even some aboriginals themselves, have recently questioned 
whether the AFN adequately represents aboriginal people to 
the government of Canada (GOC).  The election of a more 
conciliatory Grand Chief, and the prospect of a new Prime 
Minister, who may be more willing to listen to the concerns 
of the AFN, will augur for an improved dialogue between 
Ottawa and the First Nations. End Summary 
 
2.  Canada\'s Assembly of First Nations (AFN) met for their 
24th General Assembly July 15-17.  Phil Fontaine defeated 
incumbent Matthew Coon Come to reassume, after a three-year 
interim, the position of National Grand Chief.  The AFN, 
viewed by its members as a type of parliamentary gathering, 
is comprised of the 633 First Nation chiefs, each of whom 
represent a tribe or band.  It is comprised of status First 
Nation chiefs, who represent some 650,000 - 700,000 \"status\" 
natives, but critics claim it represents the chiefs 
themselves (some of whose positions are hereditary) more 
than the First Nation rank and file.  The GOC does not 
recognize the First Nations as a separate nation, but rather 
as another \"order of government\" like the provinces.  Order 
of government is used instead of level of government (which 
refers to provinces and municipalities) in order to avoid a 
connotation of hierarchy. 
 
3.  In the past, Minister Robert Nault of the Department of 
Indian Affairs described the AFN as ineffective and 
irrelevant, and \"structurally incapable of working with the 
government.\"  Many observers describe the AFN as more as a 
lobby group than an effective legislative body, and in the 
campaign Fontaine rued the fact that the AFN had been 
\"marginalized\" and had been made of \"little or no 
consequence to Ottawa.\"  Dwindling attendance at the annual 
meetings has become a problem, as it is becoming a problem 
for the Assembly, as the rank-and-file perceived they were 
no longer being represented. 
 
4.  Three candidates ran for the position Grand National 
Chief:  Roberta Jamieson (a lawyer and First Nation civil 
rights advocate), Matthew Coon Come (the incumbent Grand 
Chief), and Phil Fontaine, who had served as Grand Chief 
prior to the election of Coon Come in 2000.  Mr. Coon Come, 
whose confrontational negotiating style was said to have 
repeatedly alienated federal officials, was dropped after 
the first ballot when he only earned 18 percent of the vote. 
Fontaine won the election in the second round with 292 of 
550 votes, edging out Ms. Jamieson, who had positioned 
herself midway between her two rivals.  Phil Fontaine 
campaigned on the promise to work with the government, 
instead of alienating it with \"noisy rhetoric,\" but has 
declared his opposition to the First Nations Governance Act, 
Bill C-7, which is an important piece of legislation 
currently before Parliament.  Our contacts in the Department 
of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) are 
complimentary regarding Mr. Fontaine\'s abilities, but say it 
is premature to comment on how his election would affect the 
substance of GOC-AFN relations, particularly regarding the 
possible passage and implementation of C-7. 
 
5.  Minister for Indian Affairs Nault introduced the First 
Nations Governance Initiative in 2001 as a way to modernize 
the Indian Act of 1867, and provide first nations people 
with better governance.  It is meant to make native 
leadership more accountable, and to open up the voting 
process to aboriginals living off of the reserves.  While 
many of the chiefs in the Assembly are opposed to Bill C-7, 
the First Nations Governance Act, federal officials claim it 
is an important, long-overdue piece of legislation which 
will permit natives to improve their quality of life.  Other 
critics go farther and suggest that the chiefs\' opposition 
is based on a desire to protect inappropriate privileges and 
powers. 
 
6.  During his campaign, Fontaine acknowledged the need for 
changes in First Nation affairs, but he called Bill C-7 
regressive.  He sees poverty as the underlying cause for 
many of the problems the First Nations face.  It stands to 
reason that the AFN would not support the legislation; many 
Assembly representatives see their role and status as being 
threatened by the law, which would essentially disband the 
Assembly in favor of an allegedly more effective group.  The 
Director of International Affairs at the AFN told the 
embassy that the real issue behind the bill is not 
accountability of the chiefs, but the need for self- 
governance.  According to this view, most chiefs do not have 
problems with accountability and, in fact, spend much of 
their time writing reports and keeping others aware of their 
actions.  Many within First Nation communities see the bill 
as a continuance of assimilation policies they oppose, 
saying it imposes non-native cultural structures onto native 
groups.  At the same time, they are tired of not having a 
say in how their governments operate.  To remedy this, the 
AFN proposed the First Nations Plan, an internal initiative 
that would review the structure of the AFN, voting, and 
other First Nation governmental issues without GOC 
involvement. 
7.  Paul Martin, who is expected to become the Liberal 
Party\'s leader in November and Prime Minister shortly 
thereafter, has his own reservations regarding Bill C-7.  He 
received wide praise among native leaders for blocking the 
passage of the bill this spring by filibustering in 
committee.  He does not want it to proceed without further 
consultation with the First Nations.  Martin stated that the 
proposed legislation \"severely poisoned the well of federal- 
aboriginal relations,\" noting that the government, in 
pushing ahead with the legislation despite an AFN boycott 
announced in 2001, had created a quagmire.\"  (Note: Bill C-7 
is considered a part of the so-called \"legacy legislation\" 
of the outgoing Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, himself a 
former Minister of Indian Affairs, who may recommend quick 
passage when Parliament returns to work in September.) 
 
8.  Comment:  The AFN is a diverse and unwieldy group, not 
surprising given Canada\'s huge geographical expanse, its 
propensity for regional political discord, and the varying 
governance structures currently in place among its First 
Nations.  The Assembly is essentially a lobby group whose 
prestige rises and falls with its ability to influence 
policy.  Much of the recent decline is attributed to former 
AFN Chief Matthew Coon Come whose acerbic style alienated 
potential allies within the Department of Indian Affairs. 
The Department delivered a strong signal last year when it 
cut the AFN\'s GOC-derived funding in half, ostensibly 
because of his inability to work effectively with the GOC. 
Martin, the Prime Minister-in-waiting has not only earned 
the AFN\'s gratitude by questioning C-7 and announcing that 
would seek equal representation for the AFN in all federal- 
provincial meetings, but he has also reflected a 
conciliatory, consultative management style.  The stage is 
set for a renewed dialogue, even though some tension will 
likely remain.

 1.  (C)  Summary:    The Canadian response to U.S. priority 
initiatives for the UNGA 58 (ref A) was largely supportive. 
The GOC, however, hoped the U.S. would show more flexibility 
on the issue of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  The 
GOC was also uncertain about its stance on a human rights 
resolution against Iran, as its opinion of that country,s 
human rights practices is currently being shaped by the 
unfolding events surrounding the death of the Canadian 
journalist, Zahra Kazemi (ref B).  End summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Post delivered points contained reftel to various 
Canadian officials at Canada,s Department of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (DFAIT) on July 21.   On the issue of the Middle 
East peace process, poloff spoke with Peter Taylor, Deputy 
Director of DFAIT,s UN and Commonwealth Affairs Division. 
He said the GOC was very pleased with the U.S. led Roadmap 
and thought the results were, thus far, a cause for optimism. 
 According to Taylor, the GOC also agreed that the UNGA was 
the wrong venue to address the Middle East peace process.  He 
said the GOC would support a U.S. led effort to keep 
resolutions on the topic out of the General Assembly, 
however, he doubted the success of any such campaign, saying 
that negotiations between the EU and Arab states were sure to 
produce resolutions.  He felt confident that Canada would 
play no role in the drafting process, however, once these 
resolutions came up for vote, Canada would look at each of 
them individually and support those that it felt were 
evenhanded.  He said Canada would oppose any resolution that 
threatened the security or independence of Israel. 
 
3.  (C) Regarding the International Criminal Court  (ICC), 
poloff spoke with Darryl Robinson, Legal Advisor in DFAIT,s 
UN, Human Rights, and Economics Division.  He said Canada 
understands the U.S. has strong concerns about the ICC.  He 
further stated that Canada would be amenable to developing 
agreed upon approaches to reference the ICC if it helped 
minimize conflicts over UNGA resolutions.  According to 
Robinson, however, the GOC feels the U.S. has weakened or 
stricken several ICC references in recent years without any 
\"quid pro quo\" being granted.  He felt that if further 
compromises were to be achieved, the U.S. would have to 
exhibit more flexibility on the subject and allow some debate 
that it has previously tried to squash.  Robinson also felt, 
that in the past, the U.S. and its allies have achieved 
difficult compromises on ICC language only to have the U.S. 
reject the previously agreed upon language the following 
year.  He said the GOC hoped that all sides would, where 
possible, adhere to previously agreed upon language from 
year-to-year. 
 
4.  (C) On the topic of General Assembly resolutions 
condemning human rights abuses in Burma, Cambodia, Zimbabwe, 
and Iran, poloff spoke with Kelty Peterson, Human Rights 
Officer in DFAIT,s Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs, and 
Women,s Equality Division.  She suggested that the GOC would 
likely support resolutions condemning human rights violations 
in Burma, Cambodia, and Zimbabwe.  On the subject of Iran, 
however, the GOC opinion is currently in a state of flux. 
Both Peterson and Taylor felt that the recent case of Zahra 
Kazemi, the Canadian journalist who died in an Iranian jail, 
is causing the GOC to reevaluate its opinions about Iran and 
the country,s human rights practices (ref B).  They 
suggested that how Iran handles this situation may influence 
Canada,s decision to support a resolution against it. 
Taylor asked if the U.S. would sponsor the resolution on Iran 
itself. 
 
5.  (C) Poloff spoke with Taylor about counterterrorism and 
he said Canada agreed with the U.S. that the General Assembly 
provided another excellent opportunity to focus the world,s 
attention on the importance of global counterterrorism 
efforts.  He further said that the GOC has \"a high view\" of 
the UN,s Committee for Counter Terrorism (CTC) and its 
program to build the capacity of member nations to combat 
terrorism.  He noted that Canada has signed and ratified all 
12 of the International Conventions and Protocols pertaining 
to global terrorism.

SUBJECT: CANADA: HIGH ON HYDROGEN 
 
REF: REF: (A) STATE 146268 (B) OTTAWA 01721 
 
1. SUMMARY:  This cable provides an overview of Canada\'s 
public and private efforts to develop technologies for the 
use of hydrogen as a fuel.  Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) 
is drafting a detailed national plan for directing Canadian 
hydrogen efforts (\"Canadian Hydrogen Roadmap\"), but it is at 
least one year away from completion, according to GOC 
officials.  On April 15, Industry Canada released its 
\"Canadian Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap,\" a document 
that will complement the expected \"Hydrogen Roadmap.\" 
Research teams at the National Research Council (NRC) labs in 
Ottawa and Vancouver are working on the next generation of 
PEM (proton-exchange membrane) and solid oxide fuel cell 
(SOFC) components to find ways to lower the cost, reduce the 
size, and improve the efficiency of fuel cells.  High-profile 
Canadian corporations, some of them world leaders in their 
field, are also doing their part to spur the development of 
hydrogen-related technology and infrastructure in Canada (see 
paras 10-11).  Given its expertise in some hydrogen 
technologies, Canada could contribute significantly to the 
development of the hydrogen economy in North America, and we 
recommend continued close collaboration between governments 
and the private sectors of the US and Canada.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOC:  BRING ON THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  The Canadian Government (GOC) has made a multi-agency 
commitment to developing the hydrogen economy.  Natural 
Resources Canada\'s (NRCan\'s) hydrogen-related research and 
development (H2 R&D) is handled by the CANMET Energy 
Technology Centre (CETC).  Vesna Scepanovic, Hydrogen and 
Fuel Cell Program Manager of the CETC, highlighted for Emboff 
the GOC\'s strong interest in supporting private H2 R&D, as 
well as performing some of its own.  She emphasized NRCan\'s 
leading role in 20 years of H2 R&D for a total expenditure of 
C$183 million (US$133 million), not including the new 
Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance (see para 3).  She 
pointed out that more recently involved GOC agencies include 
Transport Canada, the National Research Council (NRC), and 
Environment Canada.  Scepanovic said that Industry Canada and 
the Department of National Defence (DND) are becoming more 
interested in the use of hydrogen, as shown by Industry 
Canada\'s release of the Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap 
in April (see paras 7-9).  Scepanovic mentioned that NRCan is 
currently working on a Canadian Hydrogen Roadmap that will 
take at least one year to develop.  She commented that it 
should have predated the Fuel Cell Roadmap because the new 
Hydrogen Roadmap will be a more comprehensive plan, 
including, but not limited to, fuel cell technology. 
 
3.  In 2000, under the Canadian Climate Change Action Plan, 
CETC created the Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance 
(CTFCA).  The CTFCA is an organization that brings together 
more than 60 universities, private companies, and government 
agencies.  Richard Fry, CTFCA\'s Fuel Cell Infrastructure 
Program Manager, told Emboff that his program will receive 
C$23 million (US$17 million) over five years (ending in 2005) 
through NRCan to fund projects on hydrogen fueling stations 
and demonstrations of hydrogen production from methanol, 
natural gas, electrolysis, and recovery of waste hydrogen. 
Fry acknowledged some GOC interest in hydrogen production 
from nuclear power sources and observed that Geoffrey 
Ballard, founder of Canadian fuel cell producer Ballard 
Power, publicly supports the idea.  However, Fry and other 
officials indicate a preference for renewable sources of 
hydrogen production, although current government funding of 
wind and solar projects is weak.  For now Canada continues to 
produce the majority of its hydrogen from fossil fuels. 
Major CTFCA partners include Ballard Power Systems, Ford 
Motor Company, Hydrogenics Corporation, QuestAir 
Technologies, and Stuart Energy Systems (for more details on 
these Canadian companies see para 10). 
 
4.  The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) does 
significant research related to PEM (proton-exchange 
membrane) fuel cells and SOFCs (solid-oxide fuel cells). 
Senior researchers in Ottawa are applying their expertise and 
lab capacity in materials science towards specific fuel cell 
applications, while a more focused fuel cell program is 
growing at NRC\'s Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation in 
Vancouver.  One project involves reducing the amount of 
platinum needed in fuel cell catalysts, which could 
drastically lower their cost.  NRC officials emphasize that 
they are a \"crown corporation\" distinct from the GOC (which 
in any case provides most of their funding).  NRCan and its 
CANMET labs form the epicenter of GOC hydrogen research and 
policy. 
 
KYOTO RATIFICATION PROVIDES IMPETUS 
----------------------------------- 
5.  The GOC ratified the Kyoto protocol in late 2002 and 
views hydrogen as a potential tool for important reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions.  Technology Early Action 
Measures (TEAM), a division of the Climate Change Action Fund 
(CCAF), provides investment for technology that promises to 
reduce emissions while sustaining social and economic 
development.  TEAM, which encourages clean energy solutions 
that can be marketed quickly, was initially budgeted C$60 
million (US$44 million) from its inception in 1998 to 2001. 
An additional C$35 million (US$25 million) will see it 
through to 2004.  In one example of hydrogen technology 
investment, TEAM provided C$1.1 million (US$822,000) for an 
Ontario Power Technologies project in 2000 to build a 
prototype heat and power plant to run on fuel cells. 
 
6.  Hydrogen has also attracted attention and funding from 
Technology Partnerships Canada (TPC), a loan program that 
supports private sector R&D.  For example, TPC invested 
C$4.34 million (US$3.24 million) in Stuart Energy Systems in 
1999 for the design of a cost-effective refueling system for 
hydrogen-powered buses. 
 
\"CANADIAN FUEL CELL COMMERCIALISATION ROADMAP\" 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7.  Industry Minister Allan Rock released the \"Canadian Fuel 
Cell Commercialisation Roadmap\" on April 15 of this year 
(information available at www.strategis.ic.gc.ca).  In it, 
the GOC identifies the economic and environmental goals of H2 
fuel cell development, such as cleaner air and lower 
climate-changing emissions levels (towards Kyoto 
requirements).  It views hydrogen as an important energy 
resource for transportation, heating, and power generation. 
The GOC believes it holds a world leadership position in this 
sector and endorses the roadmap as a way to maintain a 
Canadian edge in a global hydrogen economy.  The Roadmap 
profiles no fewer than 96 Canadian players, 42 of which are 
GOC agencies (Environment Canada, TPC, NRCan\'s TEAM, Industry 
Canada, Transport Canada) or NGOs (CHA, Fuel Cells Canada). 
The other 54 profiles are broken into three categories:  Fuel 
Cell Producers (Hydrogenics, Ballard Power), Parts and 
Systems Suppliers (QuestAir, Vandenborre), and Fueling 
Infrastructure (Stuart Energy).  (For details on these 
participants see para 10). 
 
8.  Most economic data in the Roadmap is from 2001.  The GOC 
estimates 1,800 Canadian jobs are directly connected and 
dedicated to the fuel cell industry, 76% of which are located 
in Western Canada (concentrated in British Columbia).  This 
number is thought to have remained stable over the last two 
years and represents mostly university and community college 
graduates.  According to the GOC, 2001 fuel cell industry 
revenues were estimated at C$96.9 million (US$70.1 million), 
with 70% coming from Western Canada.  The GOC predicts 70% 
revenue growth between 2001 and 2003, resulting in an 
estimated C$165.2 million (US$119.5 million) in Canadian fuel 
cell industry revenue this year.  For purposes of comparison, 
the US fuel cell market is estimated to be worth about US$1.4 
billion this year (according to a report from the Business 
Communications Company, Inc., website www.bccresearch.com). 
Using those numbers, the Canadian fuel cell market is roughly 
5% the value of the US fuel cell market, which may seem 
insignificant until one realizes that 2002 nominal Canadian 
GDP was about 7% of US GDP.  Thus one can see that the fuel 
cell market is playing an equally important role in the 
Canadian economy proportionate to the US fuel cell market and 
economy. 
 
ROADMAP TO GREATER EFFICIENCY 
----------------------------- 
 
9.  The \"Roadmap\" recommends strategies to stimulate early 
market demand by showcasing technology and educating the 
public.  To improve product quality while reducing cost, the 
Roadmap promotes information sharing and the adoption of 
common performance and technical standards between 
researchers and developers, the private sector, and academic 
institutions.  To help in the financing of H2 fuel cell R&D, 
the Roadmap proposes tax incentives and matching funds for 
related investments.  The GOC intends to \"take a lead role in 
setting codes and standards for fuel, fuel cells, and fueling 
systems.\"  The Roadmap concludes with the goal of \"developing 
a national fuel cell strategy within the next year\" and 
incorporating Roadmap working groups into Fuel Cells Canada, 
an industry association that actually began as part of 
Industry Canada (see para 14). 
 
SAMPLING OF CANADIAN COMPANIES RECEIVING GOC FUNDS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
10.  The bulk of Canadian private sector H2 R&D efforts (87% 
of all Canadian fuel cell R&D) is clustered around Vancouver, 
British Columbia (B.C.), only 150 miles north of Seattle. 
Another center of private hydrogen activity is in the Toronto 
area.  Following is a summary of some major private sector 
players with their location, their focus, and their GOC 
funding: 
 
COMPANY:  Ballard Power Systems

                 city buses; C$8m (US$5.8m) from NRCan, 
                 Industry Canada, Environment Canada,and 
                 Transport Canada for fuel cells in Ford 
                 cars.

                 10-kilowatt fuel cell power module for use 
                 in forklifts, utility and mining vehicles. 
 
 
 
SOME CANADIAN COMPANIES ARE WORLD LEADERS IN THEIR FIELD 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
11.  The above list details only four of a large group of 
Canadian companies making significant steps forward in the 
development of hydrogen technology.  The following Canadian 
firms are considered to be among the world\'s leaders in their 
fields: 
 
Ballard Power 
     PEM (proton-exchange membrane) technology 
 
Dynetek 
     Compressed hydrogen storage 
 
Greenlight Division of Hydrogenics 
     Fuel cell systems testing 
 
HERA Hydrogen Storage Systems 
     Hydrogen storage in light-weight hydride materials 
     and R&D on carbon-based materials for H2 storage. 
 
 
HYDROGEN ECONOMY OFF TO A GOOD START 
------------------------------------ 
 
12.  The Canadian private sector foresees strong consumer 
demand for hydrogen-powered products in the near future and 
many products are already on the market.  Stuart Energy has 
mobile and permanent hydrogen refueling stations running; 
Hydrogenics offers portable and stationary hydrogen-run power 
generators; Ballard fuel cells are in both Coleman Powermate 
generators and Daimler/Chrysler buses and cars.  According to 
Stuart Energy, modifying a current internal combustion engine 
to run on hydrogen (cutting emissions dramatically) costs 
only about US$700, meaning that large numbers of Canadians 
(and Americans) could be driving hydrogen-powered vehicles 
today.  Companies such as Stuart Energy that are not 
primarily involved with fuel cell technology (whose practical 
applications are still 15-20 years away) see the \'hydrogen 
economy\' as a more immediate subset of the larger economy. 
Instead of replacing contemporary energy sources, hydrogen 
can complement them and help optimize their use through its 
ability to store energy during off-peak hours for emergency 
use during times of heavy demand. 
 
BUSINESS ACROSS THE BORDER 
-------------------------- 
 
13.  Private sector players in the US and Canada are showing 
a healthy degree of teamwork with regard to hydrogen 
technology and applications.  Companies on both sides of the 
border belong to the same H2 industry organizations (Ballard 
Power, for example, is a member of the Canadian Fuel Cell 
Partnership, and Ford Motor Company is a partner of the 
Canadian Transportation Fuel Cell Alliance).  Some companies 
are conducting joint projects; for instance, US General 
Motors is working with Canadian firms Hydrogenics and General 
Hydrogen, and Ford is working with Stuart Energy and Ballard 
Power.  Canadian and American businesses would both benefit 
from a compatible, balanced and strong hydrogen 
infrastructure on both sides of the border, so they have an 
incentive to cooperate in working towards that goal.  GOC 
officials confirmed that any multinational with an office 
based in Canada qualifies for hydrogen-related government 
funds, which might make American private investment in 
hydrogen projects in Canada even more attractive. 
 
H2 INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS IN CANADA 
---------------------------------- 
 
14.  A host of organizations have sprung up in efforts to 
coordinate the hydrogen-related activities of industries, 
universities, research institutions, the GOC and provincial 
governments.  Two examples are Fuel Cells Canada (based in 
the NRC\'s Institute for Fuel Cell Innovation in Vancouver) 
and the Canadian Hydrogen Association (CHA, offices in 
Toronto and Montreal).  Fuel Cells Canada, a non-profit 
industry association that began with support from the 
National Research Council (NRC), provides support and 
services for continuing demonstration, development, and 
deployment of hydrogen fuel cell technology.  The CHA, also 
non-profit, sponsors and organizes meetings and conferences 
for its members and promotes educational activities in 
schools.  CHA members include Ballard Power, Dynetek, General 
Hydrogen, Hydrogenics, and Stuart Energy.  These two 
associations form the industry framework for plans like the 
Fuel Cell Commercialisation Roadmap that call for a wide 
variety of players dealing in different sectors of the 
hydrogen economy. 
 
US-CANADIAN COORDINATION: KEEPING THE LIGHT ON 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
15.  Although NRCan already collaborates with DOE on hydrogen 
safety standards and educational outreach projects, their 
hydrogen managers at the working level are eager for further 
bilateral coordination.  Fortunately NRCan officials say that 
they do not feel they are duplicating US H2 R&D efforts. 
While both countries\' scientists are researching many of the 
same issues, they are \"developing very specific 
technologies.\"  In the recent bilateral energy consultations 
held in Ottawa, the GOC committed to participation in the 
International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy (IPHE, REF 
A), despite concerns of potential overlapping with the 
International Energy Agency\'s (IEA\'s) Hydrogen Control Group 
(HCG) (REF B). 
 
16.  COMMENT:  While the GOC has a long track record of fuel 
cell funding and research, its attention to the significant 
matters of hydrogen production, storage, and transport is 
relatively new.  These areas would benefit greatly from 
USG-GOC coordination.  It is still unclear to some GOC 
officials how best to engage in successful North American H2 
R&D collaboration with the US, which they all agree is very 
desirable.  Post believes that US and Canadian bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation on hydrogen technologies will help 
cement both countries\' leading positions in the coming global 
hydrogen economy.  END COMMENT.

IRAQ 
1.   \"Two down, one to go\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"The good news from Iraq: 
There\'s food in the markets, a new governing council 
and Saddam\'s sons are dead,\" columnist Margaret Wente 
wrote in the leading Globe and Mail (7/24): \"As for the 
situation in Iraq, I have a hunch it\'s going better 
than the daily dose of woe dished up by the media might 
lead us to believe. According to the media, Iraq is 
Vietnam, with an all-out guerrilla war, a hostile local 
population, anarchy in the streets, and American troops 
who are ready to frag the brass.... Don\'t get me wrong. 
Iraq will be a three-Excedrin headache for a long time 
to come. Maybe it will all blow up. But please allow me 
a tiny scrap of optimism. It could be going a whole lot 
worse. And it\'s probably going a whole lot better than 
you\'d think if you watched the news.\" 
 
2.   \"Bush needs the UN\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (7/24): \"This past week, the White House has 
been juggling again with the UN. More precisely, 
Secretary of State Colin Powell is dueling with the two 
 
SIPDIS 
most UN-allergic people, Vice-President Dick Cheney and 
his mentor Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Between 
the lines, Powell is letting it be known that a new 
resolution could be presented to the members of the 
Security Council in order to envision a larger 
coalition. This about-face is caused by the 
difficulties facing the military on the ground and the 
interim administration of Paul Bremer.... According to 
Bush\'s legal position, Resolution 1483...allows any 
country that so wishes to support the military effort 
without rewording the [UN] resolution. France and 
Germany, for example, could send troops under the aegis 
of NATO. Nothing is less certain or desirable.... More 
fundamentally, if an increase in the number of soldiers 
is vital for the security of the Iraqis, then the Blair- 
Bush duo should take a lower profile while the case is 
handed over to the UN.\" 
 
3.   \"Pacifying Iraq\" 
Editorialist Julie Lemieux wrote in the centrist Le 
Soleil (7/24): \"The key to the success of the military 
operations in Iraq resides in the ability of the 
Americans to raise the standard of living of the Iraqi 
people. This won\'t be achieved as long as the country 
remains mired in chaos, violence and crime.... In light 
of the difficulties facing the British-American troops 
on the grounds, one can wonder if the time has not come 
for the Americans to admit they need help. By calling 
on Old Europe to create a UN-led neutral coalition, the 
U.S. would give itself all the chances in the world of 
restoring order in Iraq and helping it recovering its 
freedom. For now the Americans still seem to be 
considered an occupation force rather than an army of 
liberation by a good part of the Iraqi people. But one 
could think this scenario would change if the 
international community were called upon to play a 
greater role.\" 
 
4.   \"Two troubling questions about Iraq\" 
Columnist Gilles Paquin wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(7/24): \"Iraqis are waiting for irrefutable evidence. 
After having been fed propaganda for thirty years, we 
can understand their skepticism towards the powers that 
be.... The evidence unveiled by General Sanchez is 
essentially based on the identification of the bodies 
by old regime officials detained by the Americans.... 
It also rests on X-rays that made it possible to 
identify old wounds suffered by the two men.... 
Meanwhile doubts remain.... Iraqis will remember with 
bitterness the bragging of American military officials 
who claimed to have killed General Ali Hassan al-Majid, 
aka Chemical Ali, this past April 7.  On June 6, 
General Myers admitted the man was still alive.\" 
 
5.   \"The Failure\" 
Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(7/23): \"Yesterday Koffi Annan presented to the 
Security Council a first report on the post war 
situation in Iraq.... Let\'s not insist too much on the 
apparent contradiction between the concern for security 
and the desired withdrawal of the only group which can 
at the present time insure that security...precisely 
because no on else wants to step in. Let\'s rather focus 
on the fact that the debate will center on the 
opportunity of voting on a second resolution at the 
Security Council (which roughly speaking is wished for 
by `Old Europe,\' deemed superfluous by the U.S. and put 
on hold by the UN).  This is more a matter of power 
than legal correctness.  The point is to extract from 
Washington the control over the reconstruction of Iraq, 
the flow of money that will be funneled into it and 
eventually the important levers for the economic future 
of the country. This time, the Americans find 
themselves in the position of having to make some 
concessions.\" 
 
6.   \"Better than they deserved\" 
The conservative National Post opined (7/23): \"The U.S. 
military turned up two aces in Mosul, Iraq yesterday - 
Uday and Qusay Hussein, respectively 
the aces of hearts and clubs in the \'most-wanted\' card 
decks issued to U.S. troops.... Indeed, our single 
regret is that the brothers were not taken alive. Uday 
and Qusay were spoiled, pampered men who - like most 
cruel bullies - would no doubt have spilled out 
everything they knew once they found themselves on the 
wrong side of the interrogation table. An Iraqi 
court might then have passed sentence on them for their 
crimes against humanity, and they would have spent the 
rest of their lives in jail (assuming an Iraqi mob did 
not tear them limb from limb first). Death in battle 
was too dignified a fate for these foul human 
specimens.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
7.   \"Israel\'s prisoners dilemma\" 
The conservative National Post opined (7/24): \"Will the 
road map to Middle East peace go the way of the Oslo 
accords? We hope not. But there are many troubling 
signs. Principal among them is Israel\'s recent 
announcement that it may accede to demands to release 
several thousand of the roughly 6,000 Palestinian 
prisoners held in the nation\'s jails and detention 
centres - even without first obtaining a promise from 
Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas to disarm the 
very terrorist groups in whose ranks many of Israel\'s 
prisoners once served.... The Bush administration, 
which is pushing Israel to release as many prisoners as 
possible, should learn from history. 
Israel released 415 members of the terrorist group 
Hamas in 1992; many of them returned to the practice of 
terror.... There is some room for compromise here. Many 
of Israel\'s Palestinian prisoners are not terror 
suspects, and Israel might be able to release these men 
without too much risk. Such a gesture would go some way 
to validating Mr. Abbas in the eyes of ordinary 
Palestinians -a worthy objective given that he is a 
sensible man whose loss would set the peace process 
back years. Any compromise along these lines will 
likely fail to satisfy the Palestinians: They demand 
the release of the imprisoned terrorists, too - whom 
they refer to euphemistically as \'political prisoners.\' 
But unless and until Mr. Abbas agrees to liquidate and 
disarm the terrorist groups who operate in the West 
Bank and Gaza, any talk of releasing Palestinians 
implicated in terrorism from Israeli jails is 
premature.\" 
 
AFRICA 
8.   \"Bush must not fail to pick up the challenge of 
Liberia\" 
The left-of-center Vancouver Sun (7/23) commented: 
\"...Intervention in Liberia is a tough call for 
President George Bush. His country has no direct 
national interest in the country where President 
Charles Taylor is under UN indictment for war crimes in 
neighbouring Sierra Leone, one of a patchwork 
of regional civil wars that include Guinea and Ivory 
Coast.... There are good arguments against Americans 
being the first on the ground to try to halt the war, 
and equally good ones for it to intervene. But the tone 
coming from the White House on Liberia is one of dither 
and indecision. The U.S. and Liberia have strong 
historic links. The country was established in the 
1840s as a homeland for freed American slaves.... While 
the U.S. may have no direct and contemporary interest 
in Liberia, that presents President Bush 
with an opportunity. Critics say the U.S. is only using 
its pre-eminent military power in its own self- 
interest; Liberia could prove that\'s not so. The U.S. 
could show it\'s willing to shoulder responsibilities 
shirked by the UN. It may be the most practical 
strategy is for a West African force supported by the 
U.S. But president Bush does no favour for either 
himself or his country by failing to pick up this 
challenge.\" 
 
ARGENTINA 
9.   \"Argentina\'s popular President\" 
Foreign affairs columnist Marcus Gee observed in the 
leading Globe and Mail (7/24): \"When Nestor Kirchner 
was elected president of Argentina in May, his chances 
of success seemed slim.... Many said that the 
colourless 53-year-old with a pronounced lisp was 
doomed to become a lame duck. Some duck. Barely 
two months later, Mr. Kirchner, who travelled to 
Washington this week for his first official meeting 
with President George W. Bush, is the most popular man 
in his country, with a 75 per cent approval rating. 
Promising to bring \'a cold wind of change\' from his 
chilly southern province, Mr. Kirchner has thrilled the 
public by taking on just about every power bastion 
in the country. First, he forced most of the military 
top brass into early retirement.... Then he forced the 
unpopular chief justice to resign. Most inspiring has 
been his decision to take on Argentina\'s unpunished 
human-rights abusers.... To make sure that justice is 
done, Mr. Kirchner is preparing to repeal a decree that 
made it impossible for human-rights violators to be 
extradited for trial abroad.... Mr. Kirchner and his 
ministers have also indicated they will seek to 
overturn two much-disputed 1987 laws that bar the 
prosecution of military officers for dirty-war 
crimes.... Cynics say that Mr. Kirchner is only making 
a fuss about human rights to draw attention away from 
the country\'s present-day troubles, such as the 
crippled banking system and the country\'s $197-billion 
debt. But he has a point about impunity. People who 
don\'t face up to the misdeeds of their past are not 
likely to be happy or successful in life. Countries are 
no different.... A country with a recent past as 
terrible as Argentina\'s cannot just pretend it never 
happened. Like a festering wound, the unpunished crimes 
of the dirty war have infected the nation, undermining 
faith in government and contributing to the deep and 
bitter disillusionment that afflicts almost every 
Argentine. In his inaugural address, Mr. Kirchner 
promised to govern \'without rancour but with memory.\' 
More power to him.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Bush\'s 16 words\" 
The conservative National Post opined (7/22): \"...As 
things stand, the pro-and anti-Bush camps sit at a sort 
of stalemate, both sides waiting for the leak that will 
definitively vindicate their version of events. But it 
is more likely the brouhaha will end with an 
inconclusive anticlimax, one whose ultimate effect is 
to vindicate the President. Far from being a scandal 
\'worse than Watergate,\' or an effort to deliberately 
\'mislead\' the public, the State of the Union glitch 
seems to have resulted in large part from the interplay 
between an overzealous, but well-intentioned, White 
House staffer and an insufficiently assertive, but 
equally well-intentioned, CIA analyst.... [T]here is 
every reason to expect the false scandal surrounding 
Mr. Bush\'s January speech will subside. Enemies of the 
President may find an 
issue to bring him down in the 2004 election. But it 
won\'t be this one.\" 
 
2.   \"The tragic cost of a rash Iraq war\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (7/22): \"British 
scientist David Kelly should be alive today. But like 
thousands of others, he has become a casualty of the 
American/British rush to make war on Iraq.... Blair has 
ordered a judicial probe of this tragedy, seeking to 
absolve his government of blame. But he already has 
lost the public\'s confidence.... In Washington, U.S. 
President George Bush is also under siege for 
exaggerating Saddam\'s nuclear ambitions to justify war. 
His support is fading. There is a savage 
irony in this postwar blame game. Tragic as his death 
is, Kelly is just one victim of Bush\'s obsession with 
\'regime change\' in Baghdad, and Blair\'s eager 
compliance. Some 275 American and British troops have 
also died, along with more than 8,500 Iraqi civilians 
and military. They are the other casualties in Bush\'s 
drive to \'save\' the world from weapons of mass 
destruction that Washington has yet to produce. The 
American taxpayer, meanwhile, is on the hook for more 
than $60 billion for the war and $1 billion a week 
since.... This is a mess, and a fearsome price for a 
war that U.N. inspectors cautioned against from the 
start. They loathed Saddam\'s vicious regime. But they 
believed, rightly, that sanctions were working. That 
Baghdad was contained. That there was no need to rush 
to war. They were right.\" 
 
3.   \"Through the fog of war\" 
Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis observed in 
the conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (7/20): \"...As the 
furor in Washington grows over Bush\'s admission of now- 
discredited claims about Iraqi uranium imports from 
Africa in his keynote state of the union address, 
administration officials are viciously blaming one 
another... Blame rightly belongs to Bush himself, and 
to his woefully inadequate national security adviser, 
Condoleezza Rice. Either they knew the uranium story 
was false, or they were unfit for high office. For one 
thing, uranium ore is no more threatening than cake 
mix.... Bush\'s crusade against Iraq was designed to 
assuage Americans\' fury and fear over 9/11 by making 
Saddam Hussein a whipping boy for the attack in which 
he had no part. The jolly little wars against 
Afghanistan and Iraq were also designed to make 
Americans forget the Bush White House had been caught 
with its pants down by 9/11, and was asleep at the 
switch in the Enron financial disaster. Who now 
remembers that Attorney General John Ashcroft actually 
cut spending on anti-terrorism before 9/11, or that 
Washington was giving millions to the Taliban until 
four months before 9/11? How better to get Americans to 
support a war than by insinuating, as did Bush, that 
Iraq was responsible for 9/11, and claiming Saddam was 
about to attack the U.S. with weapons of mass 
destruction? A pre-emptive attack on Iraq was urgent to 
save America, insisted Bush. A weak-kneed Congress and 
credulous public went along with White House 
warmongering, while the spineless UN secretary 
general, Kofi Annan, and UN arms inspector Hans Blix 
wriggled like jellyfish. Most Democrats, including some 
presidential candidates, joined Bush\'s lynch mob.... A 
torrent of lies poured from the administration, all 
aimed at justifying a war of aggression, thwarting the 
UN Security Council, 
ending UN inspections in Iraq and grabbing Iraq\'s oil 
riches. Virtually all administration claims about 
Iraq\'s weapons had been disproved by UN inspectors 
before Bush went to war.... And the biggest canard of 
all: Bush\'s absurd claims there was \'no doubt that the 
Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of 
the most lethal weapons ever devised,\' and that it 
\'threatened all mankind.\' Thanks to the shameful 
complicity of the U.S. media, which amplified White 
House propaganda, Americans were led to believe 
Iraq attacked the U.S. on 9/11, and was in league with 
al-Qaida. Bush\'s faux war on terrorism was redirected, 
by clever White House spin, into a hugely popular 
campaign against Iraq. The failure to kill terrorist 
leader Osama bin Laden was covered up by the rush to 
kill Saddam. The litany of lies produced by the White 
House and its neo-con allies would be farcical were it 
not for the deaths of so many Americans and Iraqis. Of 
course, all politicians lie. But lying to get one\'s 
country into an unnecessary war is an outrage, and 
ought to be an impeachable offence.\" 
 
4.   \"Intelligence blunder\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"War in Iraq was justified, but 
misleading public was not,\" the right-of-center Calgary 
Herald commented (7/22): \"The fact that weapons of mass 
destruction have not yet been found in post-war Iraq is 
a sore spot for those who supported the war. But the 
recent public furor in the U.S. and Britain over 
inaccurate intelligence reports shows that half the 
truth is worse than a whole lie....  Historians may 
forgive Bush\'s and Blair\'s use of hyped-up intelligence 
reports, but voters tend to be far less forgiving. It 
is not yet clear whether the world is a safer place now 
with Saddam out of Iraq, but Americans and Britons have 
good reason to be less trusting of their leaders.\" 
 
5.   \"Where are WMDs?\" 
The conservative tabloid Winnipeg Sun (7/15) remarked: 
\"It\'s a simple question for U.S. President George Bush 
to answer: Where are Iraq\'s weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) - whether nuclear, chemical or biological?... 
Iraq\'s WMD - not its WMD program, a word now starting 
to enter the Bush/Blair vocabulary - was the main 
justification for this war. We believed it was a valid 
one.... The moral justification the coalition gave for 
invading Iraq was that it was, in effect, an act of 
self-defence because of Iraq\'s WMD, Saddam\'s proven 
willingness to use them and his known support of 
terrorism. If the coalition cannot produce convincing 
evidence of the WMD it said Iraq had, the moral case 
for launching a pre-emptive war will have been fatally 
undermined.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
6.   \"The real \'road map\' lies behind the scenes\" 
Ottawa Citizen contributor David Warren wrote in the 
conservative National Post (7/19): \"...The Israel- 
Palestine negotiations are a U.S. State Department 
task, and the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, is the 
chief ball-carrier. But the team behind him is 
remarkable, both for its informality and small size. 
President Bush\'s idea was to keep it this way on 
purpose: to avoid creating the kind of institutional 
force field that pushes problems further away as it 
advances toward them, keeping them insoluble. He 
has instead created the diplomatic equivalent of one of 
the Pentagon\'s special forces, which go in and out of 
hot spots without embedded reporters.... The sort of 
real problems that are being dealt with behind the 
scenes, by truly tireless multi-person shuttle 
diplomacy, include the intifada legacy of Palestinian 
terror cells and media incitement, on the one 
side; and specific, over-visible Israeli security 
measures, on the other. It is less like a 
constitutional progression toward a new Palestinian 
state, and more like a protracted mutual disarmament 
and disengagement between two already existing 
governments. The point is to snuff out the intifada, 
and the Israeli response to the intifada, while 
building a new, and co-operative, security arrangement 
between the two sides, modelled specifically on that 
which already exists between Israel and Jordan. While 
I\'m going out on a limb to write this, I think the 
grander, operatic questions of border drawing and 
refugee settlements are already answered, or 
more precisely, mutually assumed.... It remains, 
unfortunately, in Yasser Arafat\'s interest to wait for 
his moment to blow everything up - since his own power 
increases with conflict and diminishes with peace. It 
is an elaborate game getting him and keeping him 
sidelined - one that\'s still being played. And the 
Europeans, led by the French, continue to indulge the 
soft-headed and immodest policy of throwing him 
diplomatic lifelines, by publicly recognizing him in 
defiance of U.S. pressure. That is the chief external 
thing getting in the way.\"

SUBJECT: INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT FOR CANADA 
- 2003 (REVISED) 
 
REF: A. STATE 194330 B. OTTAWA 01480 
 
1. Sensitive but Unclassified - please protect accordingly. 
 
2. (SBU) The following constitutes Ottawa\'s submission for 
the 2003 International Religious Freedom Report. 
 
Introduction and Overview -- No changes. 
 
Section I:  Religious Demography 
 
Paragraph that begins \"There is no state or dominant 
religion...\"  - revise as follows: 
 
While there is no state or dominant religion, an estimated 
74.6 percent of the Canadian population belongs to Christian 
denominations or claims Christianity as their religion. Roman 
Catholics (43 percent of the population) constitute the 
largest single religious denomination, followed by Protestant 
denominations (29 percent). United Church, Anglican, 
Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, and Pentecostal are the 
largest Protestant denominations in Canada. 1.1 percent of 
the Canadian population is Jewish.  According to a recent 
government census, the percentage of the population who are 
members of the Muslim faith has increased to 2 percent of the 
population; the number of Muslims in Canada has doubled in 
the 10-year period since the last census. Other religious 
groups in Canada include Buddhists (approximately 1 percent 
of the population); Hindus (1 percent); and Sikhs (1 
percent). The number of persons professing other religions, 
such as Scientology, Baha\'i, Shinto, Taoism, aboriginal 
spirituality, and pagan religions, constitutes 0.2 percent of 
the population. The census also reflected that the percentage 
of Canadians claiming no religious affiliation is 16 percent 
of the total population, an increase from 12 percent in the 
last census. 
 
A 2002 poll on religious attitudes by the Pew Research Center 
indicated that approximately 21 percent of Canadians attend 
church on a weekly basis. 30 percent of Canadians, according 
to the survey, said that religion is very important to them. 
 
 
Section II: Status of Religious Freedom 
 
Add the following as paragraph 2 (new):  Some religious 
holidays are national holidays, specifically, Christmas Day, 
Good Friday, and Easter Monday. These holidays do not have a 
negative impact on any religious group. 
 
Paragraph 3 that begins, \"The Constitution and...\" -- this is 
now paragraph 4 and should be revised as follows: 
 
The Constitution of Canada and the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms protect the rights or privileges possessed by 
denominational schools at the time of national union in 1867. 
 In practice this protection has meant that some provinces 
have funded and continue to fund Catholic school education, 
and some provinces (such as Quebec) have funded some 
Protestant education.  In recent years, the Quebec provincial 
government took steps to abolish Catholic and Protestant 
status for public schools; public schools in Quebec are no 
longer faith-based and are open to all. And, the Ontario 
provincial government, which previously had allowed tax 
credits only for tuition paid to Roman Catholic private 
schools, began allowing tax credits for tuition paid to all 
private schools, provided such schools satisfy certain 
educational standards. 
 
There is no official government council for interfaith 
dialogue, but the government of Canada provides funding for 
individual ecumenical projects on a case-by-case basis. 
 
Restrictions on Religious Freedom 
 
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally 
free practice of religion. 
 
Remainder of paragraph beginning \"(H)owever, in May 2001...\", 
and paragraph beginning \"(I)n July 2001...\" - delete. 
Replace with the following: 
 
The Supreme Court of Canada recently agreed to hear cases 
brought by groups in Quebec that claim their religious rights 
have been unduly restricted by condominium contracts, and 
municipal bylaws. One case involves a group of Orthodox 
Jewish families living in a Montreal condominium complex, who 
were barred by the condominium association from constructing 
temporary huts on their balconies to celebrate the fall 
festival of Sukkot. The second case involves a group of 
Jehovah\'s Witnesses who are seeking the rezoning of a tract 
of land they own, so that a church hall can be built on the 
land. The municipality where the land is located refused to 
rezone the land, because the land would no longer be subject 
to property taxes if a place of worship was built on it. 
A standing committee on justice and human rights organized by 
the Parliament of Canada is currently conducting public 
hearings around Canada on the issue of whether homosexual 
couples have the right to marry.  The hearings were organized 
after an Ontario court ruled that the legal definition of 
marriage as a union of one man and one woman violated the 
equality rights of homosexuals. Some of the hearings have 
resulted in spirited debates between gay rights advocates and 
representatives of religious faiths, who assert that marriage 
is a religious and not a political matter, and that religious 
denominations should not be forced into ordaining same-sex 
marriages. The committee is expected to bring its 
recommendations on the issue to Parliament later this year. 
 
There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees. 
 
Forced Religious Conversion 
 
No changes to this paragraph. 
 
Improved and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious 
Freedom. 
 
Delete sentence beginning \"In September 2001...\" 
 
Section III.  Societal Attitudes 
 
The generally amicable relationship among the religions in 
society contributes to religious freedom in Canada.  (After 
this sentence, delete remainder of first paragraph, and the 
second, third and fourth paragraphs of this section.  Replace 
with the following:) 
 
However, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in Canada 
increased again during this period, and there are continuing 
expressions of anti-Muslim feeling as well. There appeared to 
be a correlation between this increase, and the continuing 
violence in the Middle East. 
 
The B\'nai Brith Canada League for Human Rights received 459 
reports of anti-Semitic incidents in 2002, an increase of 173 
incidents from 2001. Incidents included general harassment of 
Jews (282 or 61 percent of the reported incidents), vandalism 
of property (148 or 32 percent), and violence (29 or 6 
percent). In an incident in Montreal on September 9, 2002, 
pro-Palestinian demonstrators assaulted a number of Jews 
during a riot on the Concordia University campus, where 
former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was 
scheduled to give a speech.  In Toronto, there was 
controversy following the July 2002 murder of an orthodox 
Jew. The accused murderer was a young skinhead, and many 
members of the Jewish community believed the victim had been 
killed because of his religion, thus making the murder a hate 
crime. 
 
Expressions of anti-Muslim sentiment continued in Canada 
during this period, according to the Canadian chapter of 
CAIR. The build-up to the war in Iraq stirred up some 
anti-Muslim feeling, but also resulted in some expressions of 
compassion toward Muslims. The main forms of prejudice 
experienced by Muslims were verbal abuse, religious or ethnic 
profiling, and discrimination in the workplace. Mixed 
feelings arose when a Christian evangelical group sent 
humanitarian aid to Iraq. Some Muslims believe the government 
of Canada is indifferent to anti-Muslim attitudes and 
discrimination. 
 
In November 2002, an information center in Quebec run by the 
Raelian religion was vandalized. Damage to the center, known 
as \"UFO Land,\" amounted to more than C$100,000. The Raelian 
Church of Canada is an officially recognized religion in 
Quebec. The religion, which is based on the idea that 
extraterrestrials created humanity as part of a lab 
experiment, had recently targeted Quebec high schools as part 
of its ongoing campaign to persuade Roman Catholics to 
renounce their faith.

IRAQ 
1.   \"Bush can\'t afford to go it alone\" 
Columnist Carol Goar commented in the liberal Toronto 
Star (7/25): \"On the one hand, there\'s pride. It would 
be humiliating for U.S. President George Bush, who 
dismissed the United Nations as ineffectual and 
irrelevant just four months ago, to turn to the 
international body for help now. On the other hand, 
there\'s politics. The president\'s approval ratings are 
slipping. Iraq has become a dangerous morass. Without 
money and troops from other countries, the U.S. stands 
little chance of stabilizing - let alone rebuilding - 
the hostile country it now occupies. At United Nations 
headquarters in New York, diplomats from around the 
world wait and weigh the odds. This could be the 
organization\'s best chance to prove that it is still 
capable of global problem solving. Or it could be a 
historic lost opportunity.... [I]n practical terms, 
Washington does have to go back to the U.N. if it wants 
help.... Bush has a choice to make. He can continue to 
flex his muscles on the world stage, with the support 
of a few embattled allies such as Britain\'s Tony Blair. 
Or he can admit he is in trouble. Both options have 
their risks.... Still, Bush\'s best bet, by any rational 
analysis, would 
be to swallow hard and ask for help. Even a superpower 
can\'t bring peace to a resentful, violence-ridden 
country.... It is unlikely that Bush will ever embrace 
the notion of multilateral engagement. Most of the 
time, the world needs America more than America needs 
the world. Nor is it probable thatBush will return to 
the United Nations willingly or contritely. The 
president of the United States doesn\'t bend or beg. But 
if Bush is smart - or if his chief political 
strategist, Karl Rove, is as shrewd as people say 
- he will agree to a new U.N. resolution on post-war 
Iraq. There are timeswhen pragmatism trumps pride.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
2.   \"Mad moves\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (7/25): \"Kim Jong-il demands...that the U.S. 
sign a pact of non-aggression, guarantee the continuity 
of the regime, which would mean granting impunity to 
the dictator and accept the principle that negotiations 
be conducted exclusively between Pyongyang and 
Washington. According to the signals sent by the Bush 
administration, the pact of non-aggression poses no 
problem. The rest however does.  Since the renewal of 
verbal hostilities between the two countries, 
Washington has always favored, and rightly so, regional 
talks. President Bush is adamant about South Korea, 
Japan, Russia and especially China being present at the 
negotiation table.... In order to try to conciliate the 
one-on-one Korea wants with the multilateralism 
Washington wants, China is proposing to mix bilateral 
meetings with multilateral discussions. One wonders if 
Chinese diplomacy is not closer to a labyrinth than to 
common sense. All that remains for us to do is to 
wonder if the fears expressed by the former Defense 
Secretary William Perry are founded or not. The latter 
 
SIPDIS 
said he was certain Korea would have eight nuclear 
bombs by the end of the year. If that is the case then 
the goose is cooked and has been cooked to the bone by 
a mad chef.\"

AFRICA 
1.   \"The Plague\" 
Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(7/29): \"Five years ago the main obstacle to fighting 
AIDS was the cost: $10,000 per year per patient. Today 
AIDS victims can be treated for less than a dollar a 
day. Important financial contributions are presently 
being made: the main donors are the United States, 
Great Britain, the World Bank and the Gates Foundation. 
More have been announced: the White House pledged $15 
billion over the next five years - although Congress 
has pared down that figure - and the E.U. has pledged 
$5 billion. Other problems remain: patents...logistics 
and culture. The latter two being the most difficult to 
solve.... Speaking before the African Union early this 
month, Kofi Annan said Africa has to take its own 
responsibilities and that at all levels, the fight 
against AIDS should be the top priority. This implies 
defusing conflicts, democratizing and fighting 
corruption. That is a much taller order than smashing 
shop windows, but it is the only thing that can really 
work.\" 
 
ECONIMIC ISSUES/WTO 
2.   \"Leaving the jungle behind\" 
Editorialist Jean-Marc Salvet wrote in the centrist Le 
Soleil (7/29): \"The UN Report points out that the 
subsidies given to the American cotton farmers are 
three times bigger than American Aid to sub-Saharan 
Africa. And that each European dairy cow gets more 
support than Europe gives to each human being in that 
same African region.... Unless one prefers the law of 
the jungle, it goes without saying that an agreement on 
agriculture and drugs will be better than no agreement 
at all. Not to discuss these topics would favor the 
status quo. The Montreal mini-summit is not a calamity 
but an opportunity. We need to strive for more 
regulations of international trade; we need fair 
regulations. Otherwise the law of the jungle will keep 
on prevailing.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
3.   \"Ariel Sharon and the wall\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (7/29): \"In Washington, Mahmoud Abbas\' message 
was clearly heard. To wit, President Bush has been 
hammering the point that a wall winding its way through 
the West Bank would considerably slow down the trust 
being developed between the parties.... These past two 
days the Sharon government has had to make concessions 
to...maintain the credibility or the sympathy it had in 
the days of Yasser Arafat. Several experts have noted 
that the Palestinian cause is perceived differently 
since Abbas has taken over.... Abbas has even been able 
to manoeuvre with enough craftsmanship to contain his 
troops without having his leadership strongly 
challenged. It is now up to Sharon to show some 
goodwill. He eventually will have to pledge to stop the 
construction of the wall. It remains to be seen if he 
will be able to convince the extremists in his 
coalition. If that is not the case, there will be new 
elections within twelve months.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Questions remaining about the war on Iraq\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (7/26): \"...The 
months since military victory have been difficult, but 
hardly disastrous. U.S. soldiers have good reason to be 
dismayed by extensions of their tours of duty. Indeed, 
U.S. planning for postwar Iraq was stunningly 
inadequate. But the recent establishment of a 25-member 
Iraqi Governing Council, composed of credible 
leaders representative of the country\'s religious and 
ethnic communities and including female 
representation, is a major step toward the devolution 
of power. And steps are being taken to reopen schools 
and hospitals, and create civil defence forces. It is 
not a shambolic occupation. Furthermore, the injection 
of U.S. might into the heart of the Middle East appears 
to be paying dividends regionally. The road map to 
Israeli-Palestinian peace has new impetus, and radical 
regimes such as Iran and Syria are more receptive to 
fighting international terrorism.... The Bush 
administration\'s controversial doctrine of pre-emptive 
attack requires a credible assessment of risk. Mr. 
Hussein did have illegal weaponry, at least not so long 
ago. Of that there is no doubt. And the world will 
eventually know the truth about it. But if no live 
weapons or weapons programs are found, there will be 
good reason for the international community to question 
Washington even more closely the next time it sounds 
the alarm - about Iran, say, or North Korea. 
Still, is there clear evidence that the U.S. and 
British governments deliberately lied in a rush to war? 
There is not, at least as yet.... But it 
is wrong to damn the Bush administration\'s commitment 
in Iraq, short of new damning revelations about its pre- 
war actions. The same is true for Mr. Blair. Much 
should still flow from this risky enterprise, and for 
the good.\" 
 
2.   \"Bush boys blow it again in post-war Iraq\" 
Editorial page editor emeritus Haroon Siddiqui 
commented in the liberal Toronto Star (7/27): \"If 
deception and unilateralism characterized America\'s 
war on Iraq, then navet, incompetence and, 
increasingly, desperation mark its shaky occupation of 
that troubled land. The killings of Saddam Hussein\'s 
sons, the exhibition of grisly photos of their corpses 
and the macabre reconstruction of their shattered 
bodies for public display are only the latest indices 
of the quagmire America has got itself into. It is a 
sad day when the U.S. secretary of defence has to fend 
off suggestions that he may have placed America in the 
e 
same league as the Taliban.... It is good that Uday and 
Qusay are accounted for. It is bad that they won\'t be 
around to be tried for crimes against humanity.... 
Besides Saddam loyalists, some Islamists and thousands 
of angry laid-off soldiers and police officers, the 
populace is clearly most upset with the Americans for 
botching the occupation. Despite improvements in recent 
days, essential services are yet to be restored to even 
pre-war levels. But the real sleeper issue is 
cultural: American soldiers know how to kill but not 
how to make and keep peace.... But America cannot do it 
all alone. It needs the United Nations, yet the Bush 
administration is trying to do an end-run around the 
world body, as it did in waging war. It is ready to 
internationalize the Iraq operation but not U.N.-ize 
it.... There is also an urgent need to restore 
American credibility, at home and abroad, starting with 
the narrative on weapons of mass destruction.... There 
is also the little issue of widespread American bombing 
of Iraq prior to the war. It was presented as continued 
enforcement of the two no-fly zones. It was nothing of 
the sort.... It is vital for the world that America 
succeeds in Iraq. It is vital for America that the Bush 
administration fails in its attempts to obfuscate the 
truth.\" 
 
3.   \"Doubting Thomases\" 
Editorialist Mario Roy wrote in the centrist La Presse 
(7/26): \"Should the pictures have been published?... 
Let\'s turn the question around. What would have been 
the reaction of the Iraqis or of the press and of 
public opinion in the West if no pictures had been 
showed?... Armchair quarterbacks always win the game. 
Which bring s us to the question: Can we always accuse 
the Americans of being both too weak and too strong at 
the same time? Too interventionist and not prepared 
enough to act? That is one of the questions raised by 
the Congressional Report on the events of September 
11.... Everybody knows that for twenty years the CIA, 
once accused of ruling the planet is in fact a paper 
tiger. An over-bureaucratized, comfy, under high 
surveillance agency, much less efficient than the 
Israeli, secret services. Or even those of the Cubans 
or East Germans during the Cold War. IN short it is the 
super weakness of the super power.\"

Canada takes the situation in Liberia very seriously, and is

But because Canada\'s forces and military assets are stretched 
thin by deployments in Bosnia and, more recently, in 
Afghanistan, Martin was \"not optimistic\" it will find a way

1. (SBU) Canada has committed to providing US$215 million in 
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for post-conflict 
Iraq, with emphasis on access to basic services (water, 
sanitation, health care); building democratic institutions; 
reforming judicial, police and correctional services; 
strengthening civil society; and promoting human rights.  As 
part of this effort, the GoC is trying to deploy two 
officials to Baghdad who would serve as a national liaison to 
the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and as police 
advisor to the CPA, respectively. 
 
2. (SBU) Ann Flanagan, Deputy Director of Foreign Affairs\' 
Middle East Division, has requested our assistance in getting 
CPA approval for these Canadian officers.  The GoC has 
proposed that FSO Ben Rowswell be attached to the CPA as 
Canadian national liaison, and that RCMP officer David Beer 
be deployed as police advisor to the CPA.  Beer was part of 
the multinational police assessment team that visited Iraq 
for 4 weeks in June, during which time he served for 3 weeks 
as principal advisor to the Chief of Police for Baghdad West. 
 Both Rowswell and Beer are available to deploy immediately, 
and they have already been proposed by the Canadian Embassy 
in Washington. 
 
3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Please advise ASAP on the Canadians\' 
proposals to deploy Rowswell and Beer to the CPA.  Having 
these two individuals in place will help bolster policing 
efforts and speed the delivery of Canadian assistance, 
especially given the absence of a Canadian Embassy in Baghdad.

SUBJECT: NATURAL GAS VS. NUCLEAR:  CANADIANS STUDY FEASIBILITY 
       OF REACTORS FUELLING OILSANDS 
 
REF: OTTAWA 1924 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.   SUMMARY:  THE CANADIAN ENERGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CERI) 
SAYS THAT, AT NATURAL GAS PRICES OF USD 3.50 / MCF OR MORE, 
NUCLEAR REACTORS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY SUPERIOR TO NATURAL 
GAS IN SUPPLYING THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF STEAM REQUIRED TO 
EXTRACT CRUDE OIL FROM CANADA\'S VAST OILSAND RESOURCES.  IF 
THIS ANALYSIS IS CORRECT, AND IF POLITICAL CONDITIONS ALLOW 
THE NUCLEAR OPTION, THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FREE UP 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CANADA\'S NATURAL GAS FOR U.S. 
MARKETS, WHILE FURTHER STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMICS OF 
CANADA\'S SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   THE CERI STUDY IS AVAILABLE AT WEBSITE CERI.ORG.  WHILE 
THE STUDY WAS SPONSORED BY ATOMIC ENERGY OF CANADA LIMITED 
(AECL), WHICH IS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE TO SUPPLY REACTORS IN 
CANADA, IN POST\'S OPINION CERI\'S ECONOMIC WORK IS CREDIBLE. 
 
3.   WESTERN CANADA\'S OILSANDS (REFTEL) CONTAIN PROVEN 
RESERVES EQUIVALENT TO 175 BILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, 
WHICH ARE ALREADY ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE AT CURRENT OIL 
PRICES.  EXTRACTING MOST OF THIS OIL DEMANDS LARGE AMOUNTS 
OF STEAM, WHICH IS INJECTED INTO THE GROUND IN ORDER TO 
SEPARATE OIL FROM SAND.  CURRENTLY, THIS STEAM IS SUPPLIED 
BY BURNING NATURAL GAS - WHICH IS ABUNDANT IN THE OILSAND 
REGION, BUT SUSCEPTIBLE TO TIGHTENING SUPPLY-DEMAND 
CONDITIONS ON A CONTINENTAL BASIS.  POSSIBLE RISING NATURAL 
GAS PRICES ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF ECONOMIC RISK FOR 
OILSAND PRODUCERS. 
 
4.   THE OILSANDS ARE CURRENTLY PRODUCING A MILLION BARRELS 
OF OIL DAILY, AND MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR EXPANSIONS ARE 
UNDERWAY, SO THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL GAS CONSUMED IS 
SIGNIFICANT.  ANALYSTS SAY THAT GAS FROM THE PROPOSED 
MACKENZIE VALLEY NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT, WHICH IS 
PROJECTED TO DELIVER ROUGHLY 0.8-1.2 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF 
GAS PER DAY TO NORTHERN ALBERTA BEGINNING AROUND 2009-2010, 
IS LIKELY TO BE ENTIRELY ABSORBED BY OILSANDS DEMAND. 
 
5.   THE CERI STUDY COMPARES CURRENT GAS-FIRED STEAM 
GENERATION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE ACR-700, THE COMING 
GENERATION OF AECL\'S \"CANDU\" LIGHT WATER REACTORS.  THESE 
REACTORS BURN NATURAL-GRADE URANIUM, OF WHICH CANADA IS THE 
WORLD\'S LARGEST PRODUCER.  AECL HAS UP-TO-DATE EXPERIENCE 
WITH REACTOR CONSTRUCTION; IT HAS CURRENT OR RECENT 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN CHINA, KOREA AND ROMANIA, AND 
COMPLETED CANADA\'S NEWEST NUCLEAR POWER PLANT AT DARLINGTON, 
ONTARIO IN THE EARLY 1990\'S.  AECL ALSO CLAIMS A GOOD RECORD 
OF COMPLETING REACTORS ON SCHEDULE AND ON BUDGET. 
 
6.   ACCORDING TO THE CERI STUDY, AT GAS COSTS OF USD 3.50 / 
MCF, TOTAL COSTS FOR THE TWO OPTIONS ARE SIMILAR, WITH 
NUCLEAR HAVING AN EDGE ($8.61 VS. $9.42 PER TONNE OF STEAM). 
HOWEVER, THE STUDY STRESSES THAT BECAUSE FUEL ACCOUNTS FOR 
ABOUT 90 PERCENT OF THE COST OF THE GAS OPTION, THIS OPTION 
IS MUCH MORE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FUEL COST.  MOREOVER, THE 
GAS OPTION IS ALSO EXPOSED TO POSSIBLE COSTS RELATED TO ITS 
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS, A FACTOR WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE 
NUCLEAR OPTION. 
 
7. COMMENT:  THE FINDING THAT NUCLEAR IS AN ECONOMICALLY 
COMPETITIVE SOURCE OF HEAT FOR OILSANDS PRODUCTION IS NO 
SURPRISE.  CANDU REACTORS HAVE GOOD SERVICE RECORDS, AECL 
HAS RECENT CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE, URANIUM IS ABUNDANT, AND 
CANADA\'S NUCLEAR POWER REACTORS HAVE PROVIDED COMPETITIVE 
BASE-LOAD ELECTRICITY FOR DECADES.  ALL THE QUESTIONS ARE ON 
THE POLITICAL SIDE.  WESTERN CANADIANS CURRENTLY HAVE 
VIRTUALLY NO EXPOSURE TO NUCLEAR INDUSTRIES OTHER THAN 
URANIUM MINES, WHEREAS THEY KNOW AND TRUST FOSSIL FUELS.

-------------------------- 
Summary and Action Request 
-------------------------- 
 
1.  Officials of Environment Canada and the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans expect a public rollout of a draft 
framework for managing Alien Invasive Species in autumn 
2003.  There may not be much meat on the bones of the draft 
strategy, and a year of consultations and further drafting 
will be required before the framework takes its final form. 
On the other hand, existing law and regulation does provide 
significant scope for action and the GoC intends to focus on 
achieving near-term results within the existing statutory 
and funding framework.  These GoC interlocutors have set a 
high priority on establishing a shared \"binational\" set of 
priorities for dealing with Alien Invasive Species and would 
like to meet with American counterparts very soon (perhaps 
as early as late August), to begin to establish a strategy 
that will work for both governments.  Post strongly supports 
this initiative and recommends that Washington agencies 
enter into a more intensive dialogue as soon as possible. 
Beginning that dialogue now will allow the U.S. to influence 
development of the Canadian draft framework and lay a 
foundation for more detailed work once pending legislation 
in the U.S has been adopted.  End Summary and Action 
Request.

2.  The GoC made a pledge in 1992, when it signed the United 
Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to prevent 
and/or control Alien Invasive Species.  The problem, 
however, according to the Commissioner of Environment and 
Sustainable Development (part of the GoC Auditor General\'s 
organization), is that this commitment (and the 1995 
Canadian Biodiversity Strategy it precipitated) have not 
triggered any concrete action.  In an October 2002 report, 
the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development characterized federal government efforts to deal 
with the Alien Invasive Species (AIS) issue as being in 
disarray, with \"no clear understanding of who will do what 
to respond\" and noting that \"no federal department sees the 
big picture or has overarching authority to ensure that 
federal priorities are established and action taken.\" 
Nevertheless, Canada indicated in its second national report 
to the CBD in 2002, that \"federal, provincial and 
territorial governments have agreed that the development of 
a Canadian strategy to address alien invasive species is a 
national priority.\" 
 
3.  Embassy ESTH Counselor, ESTH Specialist and Intern met 
with representatives from Environment Canada and the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans on July 30th to discuss 
progress in the Canadian effort to develop a national 
strategy, to discuss the extent of bilateral cooperation on 
AIS and to elicit GoC views on how to foster further 
integration of Canada-U.S. efforts, including their views of 
a potential reference to the IJC.

EC and DFO Officials acknowledge slow start - but plan is 
coming

4.  Emboffs met Robert Mclean, Acting Director General, 
Conservation Strategies Directorate, Environment Canada 
along with George Enei, Director, Conservation Priorities 
and Planning Branch, and Mark Hovorka, Scientific Advisor in 
that Branch.  Sylvain Paradis, Director of the DFO 
Environmental Science Group, represented the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans. 
 
5.  McLean, who led the discussion for the Canadian side, 
acknowledged the long lag between the commitment made in the 
CBD and mid-September 2003 when a targeted action plan, the 
\"National Invasive Species Management and Policy Framework\" 
as it is tentatively referred to, will be outlined for 
federal, provincial and territorial ministers.  McLean 
anticipates that the Framework will be unveiled in a public 
rollout as a \"White Paper\" (i.e., draft public policy) in 
autumn 2003 shortly after the briefing to ministers.  This 
will be followed by a period of seeking stakeholder and 
broad public comment and a final, official, Policy Framework 
in place around autumn 2004. 
 
6.  McLean underscored that although the Framework is still 
under construction, the priorities contained in the nascent 
plan reflect the views of the provincial, territorial and 
federal ministers responsible for the environment, for 
forests and for fisheries.  Obtaining consensus for the 
priorities was facilitated by the fact that the provincial 
and federal ministers in each of the three domains meet 
annually in Coordinating Councils, and since 2001 the three 
Councils have held a joint meeting on biodiversity.  The one 
major set of ministries that has been missing from the joint 
meetings on biodiversity has been Agriculture.  McLean did 
not elaborate on why the Agriculture ministries were not 
part of that process (there is indeed a Joint federal- 
provincial Council of Ministers of Agriculture who clearly 
could have participated in the biodiversity meetings), but 
indicated they are a major player that needs to be engaged 
in the national framework process.  Even at this late stage, 
however, there is much work still to be done.  For example, 
it is not clear to GoC officials, what form the political 
governance structure will take, it may or may not emulate 
the U.S. National Invasive Species Council. 
 
7.  In this same vein, the GoC has not yet done an 
assessment on the need for new statutory instruments. 
McLean noted that there are a number of existing statutes 
and regulations, both federal and provincial that can be 
employed to address the AIS threat (to be reported septel). 
Moreover, he contends that in order to demonstrate to the 
senior political and bureaucratic leaders in the Prime 
Minister\'s Office and Privy Council Office that the 
objectives of the Invasive Species Framework are credible 
and \"deliverable\" it will be imperative that GoC agencies 
make progress employing the existing mandates and agency 
programs to address high profile invasive species problems 
(such as Asian Carp) in the near term. 
 
8.  McLean also noted that in addition to the ministerial 
level engagement, federal-provincial working level groups 
are engaged in the development of the plan.  Given the 
division of powers in Canada between the federal and 
provincial orders of government (to be reported septel), 
Mclean highlighted the high degree of challenge in producing 
a coordinated set of actions with respect to AIS.  As just 
one example, provinces are responsible for management of 
fish stocks whereas the federal government has jurisdiction 
in regulating and managing fish habitat.  Thus banning 
possession of live Asian Carp (an emerging federal 
objective) will require enacting provincial law and 
regulation. 
 
9.  Our GoC interlocutors emphasized that the message from 
the provinces is that the federal government should focus on 
policies for prevention rather than dealing with remediation 
and already established AIS.  For many established invasive 
pest species (excluding perhaps Sea Lampreys in the Great 
Lakes, for which a comprehensive plan and funding has been 
in place for decades) our GoC interlocutors noted that there 
is no clear road ahead and that it will probably be the 
provinces that have to lead this effort.  Comment: The 
provinces will, however, be looking to the federal 
government to help fund their efforts at remediation. End 
Comment. 
 
10.  McLean commented that if GoC agencies can produce 
tangible success in the near-term on AIS, the issue is well- 
situated to gain a higher profile in the GoC as a new Prime 
Minister takes over the government in February 2004, perhaps 
even earlier.  And an election is widely expected in the 
spring.  Comment: It can be safely assumed that there will 
be many competing priorities for the attention, and the 
budget, of the new government.  Without a formal policy 
statement of the priorities of Paul Martin, widely 
anticipated to be the next PM, it is difficult to judge 
whether McLean\'s hope is justified.  Indeed, a review of 
Martin\'s public statements over the past year has not 
revealed any reference to Alien Invasive Species.  End 
Comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Bilateral cooperation requires much greater coordination 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
11.  McLean noted that there has been long-standing 
bilateral cooperation on AIS, for example with respect to 
the Sea Lamprey problem in the Great lakes, and more 
generally, on AIS important to agriculture and forestry. 
But cooperation has typically been ad hoc, species and 
project specific, agency-to-agency and regional in focus 
rather than as a coordinated overall approach guided by a 
shared bilateral set of priorities.  McLean and Enei noted 
the desire of the EC Assistant Deputy Minister (Karen Brown) 
responsible for AIS that those senior officials responsible 
for AIS policy should meet very soon to begin working on a 
set of shared bi-national priorities.  The outcomes of this 
meeting (or series of meetings) could feed into our 
bilateral consultations on a reference to the IJC, should 
the U.S and Canadian governments deem that mandate 
desirable. 
 
12.  With respect to the expected IJC reference, GoC 
officials emphasize that clear and tangible goals for the 
IJC effort are required.  In their opinion \"new money\" for 
the IJC effort will not be allocated from the Treasury, 
rather an IJC effort will likely be funded from existing 
departmental budgets.  Without a clear, tangible and \"value- 
added\" goal, GoC agencies will resist ponying up the cash. 
 
13.  Mclean agreed with ESTH Counselor\'s suggestion that it 
would be beneficial to have a catalogue/inventory of 
existing collaborative efforts on AIS, but the GoC 
representatives admitted that they have not compiled any 
such inventory.  They indicated it is something they intend 
to construct, but gave no timeline.  Comment: Post strongly 
believes that an inventory of areas in which the two 
governments already collaborate would be very valuable and 
would appreciate receiving such information if it already 
exists with Washington agencies.  End comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
IJC Views provide their comment of GoC effort 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
14.  ESTH staff sought the views of the International Joint 
Commission to provide an assessment of developments in 
Canada.  James Houston, Environmental Advisor at the Ottawa 
office of the International Joint Commission (IJC) told 
Emboffs that political awareness of the Invasive Species 
issue has grown markedly in the past 18 to 24 months; he 
pointed to the role that Canadian IJC Co-Chair Herb Gray has 
played since coming to the IJC in January 2002 to champion 
GoC engagement in addressing the problem.  Houston 
reiterated that the key problem in Canada has been lack of 
accountability.  Over the past decade GoC ministries have 
simply passed the buck on AIS, he emphasized that a critical 
component therefore of any new framework is to have a strong 
governance system.  Houston pointed to the management 
structure described by the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy 
of February 2000 as an example of what might work, but he 
noted that Chairman Gray is an advocate of the American NISC 
governance model. 
 
--------------------------- 
Comment and Action requests 
--------------------------- 
 
15.  The key message provided by our GoC interlocutors is 
that they view it as essential for USG and GoC senior 
officials responsible for AIS to meet very soon to begin 
crafting a shared set of priorities.  More generally a 
bilateral meeting will also help our GoC interlocutors to 
flesh out the draft Framework and give us a chance to 
influence its development.  The Autumn 2003 timeline for 
unveiling the draft Framework (as a policy White Paper) to 
the public for input and comment may well be met, but it 
remains to be seen how substantive it may actually be. 
According to McLean (1) the federal and provincial 
agriculture ministries have not been engaged in the 
development of the draft plan; (2) no assessment has yet 
been done to determine whether any new statutory instruments 
are required; and (3) the governance structure to oversee 
the implementation of the plan, a critical element, is still 
undetermined.  Our GoC interlocutors did not explicitly 
state this, but one presumes they believe that the public 
consultation process and final drafting scheduled for the 
period Autumn 2003 to Autumn 2004 will fill in these 
details. 
 
16.  ACTION REQUEST: We understand that McLean or Enei 
expects very soon to arrange with Lori Williams, Executive 
Director of the National Invasive Species Council setting a 
meeting of GoC and USG policy officials with AIS 
responsibilities.  We understand that the target date for 
the meeting is late August or early September.  Post would 
appreciate details of the meeting agenda and USG 
participants once those are available.  The embassy intends 
to be fully engaged on this issue and wishes to contribute 
to the bilateral effort.  In that vein, we believe that an 
inventory of collaboration between U.S and Canada Ian 
agencies would be useful and request that the department 
provide such information if it is available.

withdrawal of Russian forces, and will seek opportunities to 
do so.  Embassy Political Minister Counselor discussed reftel 
demarche with Norbert Kalisch, Acting Assistant Deputy

2. (C) Kalisch noted that during a Trubnikov visit to Ottawa 
in 2002, Canada had suggested that Moldova/Transnistria be 
one of the topics for discussion with POLDIR Jim Wright, but 
that Russia vetoed the suggestion.  Kalisch said that a 
Harder visit would be a good opportunity to press on this

MIDDLE EAST 
1.   \"Stumbling block on road to peace\" 
The liberal Toronto Star opined (8/5): \"...Bush has 
been pressing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to 
divert the path of the barrier so it consumes less West 
Bank territory. But Sharon last week dismissed Bush\'s 
request to dismantle or move the fence.... Israel has 
every right to build a security fence, or wall, along 
its borders. Many countries have such barriers. The 
U.S. has built high-tech fences, complete with barbed 
wire, along much of its border with Mexico. Washington 
even flirted with the idea of a similar security fence 
along parts of its border with Canada after the World 
Trade Center terrorist attack. But it is a mistake to 
build the fence on land that might become part of a 
separate Palestinian state, or be controlled by 
Palestinians, if the current Mideast peace process is 
successful. Sharon 
knows the fence won\'t stop terrorists determined to 
attack Israel.... However, Bush must continue to 
pressure Sharon to dismantle the fence. At the least, 
the U.S. president must demand it follow the Green 
Line. Sharon needs to be told firmly that he cannot 
indirectly annex parts of the West Bank. To do so will 
damage this oh-so-fragile peace process.\" 
 
IRAQ 
2.   \"U.S. wants Saddam, but dead - not alive\" 
Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis wrote in the 
conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (8/3): \"...Chances are 
Saddam, like his sons, will be killed in a Bonnie and 
Clyde-style shootout. He is unlikely to be captured, 
unless incapacitated. The Bush administration will be 
delighted not to put Saddam on public trial. Dead 
dictators tell no tales.... Saddam should be handed 
over by the U.S. to the UN War Crimes Tribunal in The 
Hague that is trying Serbia\'s Slobodan Milosevic and 
other accused Balkan war criminals. After all, it was 
Washington that engineered Milosevic\'s delivery to The 
Hague, an act for which the U.S. deserves high praise. 
What applies to Milosevic applies equally to Saddam 
Hussein. In fact, it would be better for the Iraqi 
leader to stand trial at the newly constituted 
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. But the 
Bush administration, in one of its most 
shameful acts, has refused to join this tribunal or co- 
operate with it. Should Saddam be gunned down, like his 
two sons, there will be glee among many Americans and 
rejoicing in the White House. But Saddam Hussein is not 
John Dillinger or a prize elk. However odious, he was 
the leader of a sovereign nation and a government 
recognized by the U.S. Killing foreign 
heads of state violates international law and the 
directives made by three American presidents.... 
America, the world\'s greatest democracy, has no 
business murdering foreign leaders. Such behaviour is 
criminal, immoral, undemocratic and reeks of the law of 
the jungle. Past U.S. attempts to murder foreign 
leaders have proved self-defeating.... George Bush may 
yearn to drape the body of Saddam over his Jeep and 
show it off to the folks around Crawford, Texas, but he 
should be forcefully reminded that the president 
represents the laws of the land. Bad enough the White 
House waged a totally unnecessary, unprovoked, 
undeclared war on Iraq based on spurious charges. This 
egregious offence should not be compounded by cold- 
blooded murder, no matter how odious the intended 
victim.\" 
 
AFGHANISTAN 
3.   \"The Afghan trenches\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (8/4): \"The UN report on Afghanistan says the 
present climate of danger is seriously threatening the 
peace process.... [Afghanistan] is a general state of 
chaos accompanied by an increase in violence.... The 
vast and essential demining program has been suspended 
in more than ten provinces.... The burka is now almost 
as visible as in the days of the Taliban. Women in fear 
of men remain basically prisoners in their own 
homes.... This general degradation is due to two 
political factors: The first is that the foreign 
countries involves, mainly the U.S. and Europe hesitate 
to order additional deployment of troops.... The 
other...is Iraq. Several American analysts have stated 
that the preparation of the war in Iraq guaranteed that 
the Afghan file would be relegated to the background by 
the Bush administration.\" 
 
TERRORISM 
4.   \"Bush\'s Cassandras\" 
Editorialist Serge Truffaut wrote in the liberal Le 
Devoir (8/5): \"President Bush does not want to 
declassify that famous chapter the senators wrote on 
Saudi Arabia despite the demands of these senators and 
the Saudi Government itself. According to information 
revealed by elected officials who worked on the report, 
Saudi agents informed their government about the 
intentions of the perpetrators of September 11.  If the 
Saudi government is so intent on having the chapter 
concerning itself made public, why is Bush refusing? Is 
it to protect the CIA and the FBI. Is it not to hurt 
some Saudi sensitivities.... While we wait for an end 
to this confusion...we can only observe that the war 
against Iraq has indeed slowed down the war on 
terrorism on its most delicate front: the reform of the 
intelligence services.\" 
 
5.   \"U.S. must take hard look at Saudi alliance\" 
The conservative Montreal Gazette opined (8/6): \"The 
American reluctance to confront its relationship with 
this quaintly pathological kingdom is perhaps 
understandable. Through the vicissitudes of Mideast 
power politics, the Saudis have been one of the few 
constants, a reliable if eccentric ally and a 
dependable source of crude oil. But the time has come 
for the U.S. to start at least questioning its links to 
the world\'s most medieval monarchy. Releasing those 28 
pages would make a good start.\"

LIBERIA 
1.   \"Share the burden\" 
The conservative National Post opined (8/1): \"Liberia\'s 
14-year-old civil war may finally be ending. Last 
Wednesday, the country\'s giant neighbour, 
Nigeria, agreed to send 1,300 peacekeepers to help end 
hostilities.... On Monday, the European Union voiced 
support for a multilateral intervention -- but did not 
promise funding for it. Also on Monday, Ottawa pledged 
$1.75-million in humanitarian assistance to displaced 
Liberians. We find it interesting, however, that these 
moves came only after George W. Bush\'s July 4 decision 
to send military observers to the war-plagued nation. 
Two thousand U.S. Marines and three U.S. naval ships 
are now en route to West Africa. This sequence of 
events typifies the international community\'s standard 
operating procedure when it comes to humanitarian 
emergencies. It waits for the United States to agree to 
do the heavy lifting, and then parcels out the less 
onerous tasks. But U.S. manpower, capital and political 
will have limits. Washington cannot be expected to bear 
the burden of intervention during every crisis. What 
the world needs is what international relations 
theorists call \'burden sharing.\' Responsibility for 
global public goods - such as international stability, 
or the care and feeding of refugees - must be be 
carried by a coalition of wealthy, Western states.... 
Today\'s burden shirking may exact a high price 
tomorrow. Isolationism always has a significant 
constituency in the United States. And if ordinary 
Americans gets the sense that their country\'s goodwill 
is being exploited by other nations, they will retreat 
from trouble spots like sub-Saharan Africa and the 
Balkans entirely - emerging only to fight wars that 
suit Washington\'s self-interest. The better strategy is 
for Europe and Canada to ante up now, before it\'s too 
late.\"

1.   \"Secrets of Sept. 11\" 
The leading Globe and Mail (7/31) editorialized: 
\"...The intelligence and technical flaws, many of which 
were already known or the subject of intense 
speculation, are detailed in a damning report [the 
joint U.S. congressional inquiry into the terrorist 
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001] that numbers close to 
900 pages. But perhaps the most explosive section, 
which deals specifically with the possible foreign 
assistance made available to the 19 suicide hijackers 
responsible for the attacks, remains secret by order of 
President George W. Bush.... Although complete 
transparency is always preferable, there are times when 
information is simply too sensitive to be made public. 
This may very well be one of those times.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
2.   \"Not all fences make for good neighbours\" 
Foreign affairs columnist Marcus Gee observed in the 
leading Globe and Mail (7/31): \"Good fences make good 
neighbours, they say. But the security fence that 
Israel is building around the West Bank could have the 
opposite effect, further poisoning relations between 
Israelis and Palestinians and making a peace settlement 
even harder to reach. Even Israel\'s closest ally, the 
United States, thinks the fence is a mistake.... Israel 
claims that the barrier will keep bombers out and cut 
the number of Israeli casualties, but even the best 
fence will not be able to keep out determined 
terrorists. What it will do is prevent thousands of 
Palestinians from working inside Israel 
by making permanent the ban on Palestinians crossing 
into Israel from the West Bank. The result will be ruin 
for the already devastated Palestinian economy.... 
Construction of the fence continues. Eventually it will 
stretch 700 kilometres and cost $1.5-billion (U.S.). 
Israel says it is not a political border, just a 
security barrier. Perhaps. Perhaps not. What is clear 
is that it is becoming a serious barrier to peace.\" 
 
ECONOMIC ISSUES/WTO 
3.   \"Failing the fair trade test\" 
National affairs writer Jim Travers commented in the 
liberal Toronto Star (7/31): \"After years of 
confronting protesters in the streets, the World 
Trade Organization is finally face-to-face with the 
much more dangerous enemy within. It is now sadly 
evident that efforts to infuse international 
trade rules with a little equity and a lot of 
enlightened self-interest are bumping headlong into 
more powerful forces.... Unless the U.S. and Europe 
discover new wisdom and generosity in a trade report to 
be released in August, the industrialized world will 
continue to preach the merits of open borders and 
markets, democracy and the rule of law, while denying 
developing countries access to lucrative markets and 
proving that even principles supporting freedom are 
flexible. Those contradictions are loaded with 
implications for an international community standing at 
the clich of a crossroads.... What\'s needed now is 
evidence that those with wealth are willing to share; 
that rights are universal and inviolate; that security 
is not the exclusive preserve of the most heavily 
armed; that the suffering of one is the suffering of 
all and won\'t be tolerated. It\'s a lot to ask of 
those who have so much and find it so difficult to give 
so little.\" 
 
4.   \"The obligation to succeed\" 
Editorialist Michle Boisvert wrote in the centrist La 
Presse (7/30): \"Did the 146 WTO member countries get 
carried away by the enthusiasm present in Doha to the 
point of underestimating the amount of work to be 
e 
accomplished? In agriculture alone, the sums involved 
are gigantic. The total amount of agricultural 
subsidies is estimated to be $300 billion, 60 percent 
of which are export subsidies. It is the EU countries 
followed by the U.S. who are the champions of 
agricultural subsidies. In light of the discussions 
held in Montreal these two actors do not seem intent on 
modifying the existing scenario. WTO members have to 
succeed even if it means pushing back the deadlines in 
order to establish more realistic calendars.... Major 
economic powers could very well do without the WTO, but 
it is quite a different story for developing countries. 
The WTO is not perfect but it is the only international 
forum where small countries can be heard just as loudly 
as the trade giants.\" 
 
5.   \"The impossible agreement\" 
Chief editorialist Jean-Robert Sansfaon wrote in the 
liberal Le Devoir (7/30): \"Poor countries are justly 
demanding the end of the mind-boggling subsidies paid 
each year to producers by countries like the U.S. and 
Europe. But yesterday in Montreal, American farmer 
representatives came to shout loud and make clear their 
opposition to such a change. For their part, European 
farmers and their respective governments also refuse 
any reduction to the assistance received under the 
Common Agricultural Policy.... There are so many bones 
of contention in the present cycle of discussions that 
there is little chance the desired consensus will be 
reached by the December 2004 deadline.... Because of 
what is at stake, it is better to push back the 
deadline a few years than to agree to an agreement 
which would only benefit some of the most powerful 
countries.\" 
 
6.   \"Weak protests are good news\" 
The conservative Montreal Gazette opined (7/30): \"What 
if they gave a world trade conference, and nobody 
protested? That\'s pretty nearly what happened this week 
in Montreal. Opponents of the World Trade Organization 
talked big, but could stir up only a few hundred 
individuals to demonstrate on the streets against a 
meeting of trade ministers from certain WTO 
countries.... So the good news this week is `the 
system\' is tackling some of the issues that fall under 
the general heading of global social justice. The 
additional good news is the public, in Canada at least, 
seems to be coming to accept globalization holds more 
promise than menace. The bad news is the trade 
ministers are moving only very slowly on these matters 
so far. We\'re almost tempted to suggest what\'s really 
needed is a great big street demo - a peaceful one, of 
course - in support of more globalization, now.\"

Leadership Convention in six weeks\' time.  Some 400,000 
registered Liberals across 301 ridings nationwide will choose 
representatives (13 per riding) to the November Convention 
the weekend of September 20-21.  This year\'s process will 
inaugurate reforms designed to bring the selection of the 
party leader and eventual PM of the country closer to the 
grass roots level of the party:  Delegates will be chosen 
according to a procedure incorporating the percentage results 
of a popular vote taken among the membership of each riding 
association to reflect actual candidate support. 
 
3. (C) Following Deputy PM John Manley\'s decision to bow out 
of the race (reftel), general expectations are high that the 
delegate selection process will demonstrate overwhelming 
support for Paul Martin--a centrist candidate--as the next 
party Leader.  Though Heritage Minister Sheila Copps, the 
remaining other candidate, enjoys a certain \"cult following,\" 
her left-of-center ideological bent is deemed too narrow for 
most Liberals. 
 
4. (C) Martin insiders still are careful to maintain a 
\"cautiously optimistic\" demeanor on prospects for their 
candidate.  At the same time, public political support for 
Martin\'s bid has continued to grow even during Canada\'s 
traditionally slower summer cottage season. The most recent 
Cabinet-level endorsement came last week from International 
Cooperation Minister Susan Whelan, a Manley supporter, whose 
support brings to \"at least 31\" (out of a possible 39) the 
number of Cabinet members backing Paul Martin. 
 
5. (C/NF) COMMENT:  Given Chretien\'s ingrained antipathy 
toward his likely successor and longstanding political rival, 
veteran political observers expect the PM -- against all 
reason -- to throw obstacles in Martin\'s path.  This would 
include staying on as PM until the bitter end.  At the same 
time, at least one senior official told Ambassador Cellucci 
that Chretien likely will depart in December, and that a 
Martin cabinet could be sworn in before year-end.  Adding 
credence to this scenario is reliable information from a 
contact of the DCM (please protect) that a senior advisor 
close to the PM has lined up employment with a prominent 
Ottawa firm beginning January 1, 2004. 
 
6. (C/NF) COMMENT (cont\'d):  The Martin camp is maintaining 
silence on what they do or do not know about Chretien\'s 
plans. Other than to acknowledge that transition issues (such 
as prospective Cabinet appointments) are on hold until after 
the September delegate selection results, Martin\'s campaign 
advisors claim no contact with the Chretien team. The 
candidate himself (protect) commented to Ambassador Cellucci 
that their recent meeting far exceeded the sum of his 
exchanges with the Prime Minister in the past year.

MIDDLE EAST 
1.   \"The liberties taken by Israel\'s wall\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/8): \"...U.S. 
opposition to the wall - not the right to build it, but 
the path it is taking - may have forced Israel to drop 
a plan to extend it about 30 kilometres into the West 
Bank to include the large Jewish settlement of Ariel. 
Nevertheless, the Bush administration is reportedly 
considering the imposition of limited economic 
sanctions against Israel for other incursions. It need 
not come to that. Israel should heed the concerns of 
the international community and adjust its plans for 
the wall, minimizing the seizure of Palestinian land 
and forgoing construction along the Jordan Valley. This 
would help build confidence between the two sides just 
as further strains are showing between Mr. Sharon and 
Mr. Abbas.... Israelis have an absolute right to be 
free of terror, but this should not come at the expense 
of Palestinian land.\" 
 
IRAQ 
2.   \"A league of self-deceit\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Arab states shouldn\'t criticize 
Iraq\'s fledgling democracy,\" the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen commented (8/8): \"...Rather than 
face up to their own responsibilities for what has gone 
wrong, too many Arab leaders prefer to fault others - 
imperialism, globalization, Americans, Jews 
- for the repressiveness, poverty and despair that 
characterizes much of the Arab world.... [W]ith Saddam 
gone, would the Arab League refuse to recognize 
a body that is the most representative Iraq has ever 
known? Could it be because Arab leaders fear that a 
\'successful\' Iraqi experiment in democracy will expose 
their own illegitimacy? If the United States 
transforms Iraq into even a modestly democratic, 
constitutionally-ordered society, every Arab leader 
will face reformist pressures. It\'s as if the Arab 
League wants post-Saddam Iraq to fail in order to 
justify the continuance of their own authoritarian 
regimes.... In refusing to welcome Iraq\'s governing 
council, the Arab League has showed that many in the 
Arab elite continue to wander in the deserts of denial, 
maintaining their power and masking their failings by 
refusing to face the geo-political realities of today\'s 
Middle East.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
3.   \"Some reasons for hope on North Korea this time\" 
The left-of-center Vancouver Sun observed (8/6): \"After 
insisting for nine months that it would engage only in 
bilateral talks with the United States 
- with no other country at the same table - North Korea 
agreed on the weekend to multilateral talks on the 
future of its nuclear weapons program. That\'s important 
because the Americans were just as stubbornly refusing 
to engage in the bilateral talks the North Koreans 
wanted. We don\'t know for sure what prompted North 
Korea to be the one to blink. Nonetheless, we applaud 
this diplomatic breakthrough for several reasons.... 
[I]t\'s a relief that North Korea has finally agreed to 
sit down with Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and the 
U.S. to figure out ways of dismantling its nuclear 
program in exchange for economic aid and assurances 
that it won\'t be 
attacked. But our optimism is tempered because 
Pyongyang isn\'t known as a government that keeps its 
word.... A White House spokesman acknowledges that 
there will be opportunities during the multilateral 
meetings for North Korea and the U.S. or any other 
party to talk directly to each other. Such a flexible 
attitude could go a long way towards convincing North 
Korea to give up its nuclear dreams. So while the 
Chinese and the Russians are twisting Mr. Kim\'s arm, 
Japan, South Korea - already a major donor of aid to 
the North - and the U.S. can and should be easing his 
discomfort by offering economic assistance. Enticements 
alone haven\'t worked, and neither has the 
threat of force. But offering the carrot and wielding 
the stick together have a much better chance of 
success.\"

SUBJECT: NATO SYG RACE: SPECULATION ABOUT CANADIAN DEPUTY 
PM MANLEY 
 
REF: USNATO 832 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: While NATO has never before had a 
non-European Secretary General, the name of Canadian Deputy 
Prime Minister John Manley has now surfaced as a possible 
candidate.  While we do not have a sense for what Manley\'s 
prospects are in Brussels, we expect that he would jump at 
the chance to serve in this prestigious position.  The GoC 
will be seeking U.S. and European views on a Manley 
candidacy, and Manley may want to discuss the NATO SYG 
position during an upcoming visit to Washington (date tbd). 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The Canadian press reported on August 8 that Deputy PM 
Manley is being considered as a potential successor to Lord 
Robertson as NATO Secretary General.  Manley, who is on 
vacation, has not yet made any public statement concerning a 
potential candidacy.  Manley\'s spokesman said that the Deputy 
PM \"is not campaigning for this.  He\'s not a candidate.  This 
idea did not come from us.  It\'s coming out of Brussels and 
we\'re not going to speculate on it any further.\" 
 
3. (C) Manley, who dropped out of the Liberal Party 
leadership race on July 22, in fact told the Ambassador on 
July 28 that he was exploring the possibility of becoming 
NATO SYG.  The timing would work well for Manley, as Paul 
Martin (the prohibitive favorite to replace PM Chretien) is 
expected to form a new Cabinet when he becomes Prime Minister 
sometime in the December 2003 - February 2004 timeframe. 
Manley has expressed interest in serving in a Martin 
Government, but Martin\'s plans are unclear and Manley 
certainly would not have the vast portfolio he has held over 
the past year under Chretien.  In addition to being Deputy 
Prime Minister, Manley is Finance Minister, Political 
Minister for Ontario, and oversees the sensitive U.S./Canada 
border file. 
 
4. (C) Manley did a solid job overall during two years 
(2000-2002) as Foreign Minister, and shifted Canada\'s foreign 
policy away from Lloyd Axworthy\'s \"human security\" agenda and 
toward stronger partnership with the U.S.  During his 
leadership candidacy, Manley called for reforming and 
bolstering the United Nations.  He is steeped in the Liberal 
Party\'s multilateral tradition, but he has publicly rejected 
the anti-American attitudes of some Liberals, including in 
the aftermath of the Iraq War.  According to unconfirmed 
press reports, Manley was one of the Cabinet members who 
supported Canadian participation in the war but were 
overruled by Chretien. 
 
5. (C) Manley has worked closely with Homeland Security 
Secretary Ridge to make the U.S./Canada border more secure 
 
SIPDIS 
and more efficient in the wake of September 11.  On the 
defense front, Manley has admitted that Canada is not pulling 
its weight, and in his only budget as Finance Minister he 
approved a significant increase in military spending.  Manley 
has called for Canadian participation in North American 
missile defense, and negotiations over a U.S.-Canada 
cooperation agreement are ongoing. 
 
6. (C) Manley has not weighed in personally on some of the 
key issues confronting NATO, but the GoC shares our 
commitment to NATO remaining the pre-eminent security 
organization in Europe and has the same concerns as we do 
about competing EU efforts (reftel).  Canada supports NATO 
transformation, including creation of a NATO Response Force, 
and is open to NATO taking on out-of-area missions (as in 
Afghanistan, where NATO leadership is facilitating Canada\'s 
large contribution to ISAF).

AFRICA 
1.   \"Taylor\'s odious exit\' 
The liberal Toronto Star opined (8/12): \"Charles Taylor 
has finally been pried from power in Liberia, and 
that\'s a relief. It offers hope, however faint, for the 
3.3 million people who have endured 14 blood-spattered 
years under his kleptocratic reign of terror first as a 
warlord, then as president.... Yet welcome as his 
ouster is, it offers no assurance that he will face a 
United Nations war crimes indictment. A tribunal in 
Sierra Leone says he bears the \'greatest 
responsibility\' for a 10-year war there in which 
70,000 died. Taylor, who denies the charge, should have 
been escorted from his Monrovia mansion straight into 
the prosecutor\'s arms. Instead, he quit Liberia 
yesterday seeking safe haven in Nigeria. If he finds 
it, his removal will be an odious deal, made at too 
high a price. Taylor was under U.N. indictment and 
sanctions, some American pressure, and siege by rebels 
who held 80 per cent of the country. His time was up. 
There was no need to cut a deal letting him dodge 
justice.... At a time when former Yugoslav leader 
Slobodan Milosevic is on trial for war crimes and 
Rwanda\'s prime minister Jean Kambanda has been jailed, 
Taylor\'s pain-free exit is a blow to the U.N., to the 
International Criminal Court and to the rule of law. 
Peace talks among Liberia\'s warring factions may yet 
result in a government that can put the worst days 
behind. That would be a mercy. But the manner of 
Taylor\'s removal exposes the international community\'s 
spinelessness in failing to bring an indicted war 
criminal to justice. It is a betrayal of his many 
victims across West Africa. And it can only encourage 
other lawless leaders.\" 
 
NATO 
2.   \"Putting things in order\' 
Under the sub-heading, \"In a dangerous and unstable 
world, NATO finds new purpose,\" the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen editorialized (8/12): \"... The proliferation of 
failed, or failing states, and the terrorists incubated 
therein, have made NATO more necessary than ever. This 
renewed purpose was demonstrated yesterday when, for 
the first time in its 54-year existence, 
NATO stepped beyond the borders of Europe and assumed 
command of the 5,000-strong International Security 
Assistance Force in Afghanistan.... Despite the rift 
between the U.S. and \'old\' Europe over Iraq, the 
alliance\'s 19 members recognize that the U.S. can\'t 
fight alone against fanatics trying to acquire nuclear 
weapons. To those who object to \'defensive 
imperialism,\' we reply: The West will keep its armies 
at home when the enemy stops training suicide bombers.\" 
 
IRAQ 
3.   \"Bush called Saddam\'s bluff\" 
Editorials editor Jonathan Kay commented in the 
conservative National Post (8/7): \"Evidence that Saddam 
Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction 
could theoretically emerge any day.... War supporters 
have to prepare themselves for the eventual admission 
that Iraq, as attacked, was likely WMD-free. This 
admission should not be particularly toxic. The legal 
basis for war was never that Saddam had WMDs, but that 
he\'d flouted the many Security Council resolutions 
requiring him to come clean on inspections, and 
that he had never accounted for the WMD precursor 
materials we know he purchased. As for the moral 
justification, it is already crystal clear. 
Dozens of mass graves have been found, and thousands of 
Iraqis have come forward to tell stories of torture and 
unimaginable brutality under Saddam. The mere fact WMDs 
aren\'t found won\'t change the reality that the 
dictator\'s ouster has made the world, and Iraq in 
particular, a far better place.... Why would a dictator 
fool two major Western powers into invading his 
country?... [T]he Iraqi dictator kept the world 
guessing because he wanted to look strong in the eyes 
of other nations.... Simply put, Saddam sought to 
fool the world into thinking he still had a powerful 
WMD program - and he succeeded brilliantly. Even the 
intelligence agencies of France and Germany, whose 
governments so vehemently opposed the war, believed 
Saddam was hiding something. Through his ruse, Saddam 
forced Messrs. Blair and Bush to decide between war and 
acceptance of the risk that Iraq\'s madman really was 
building deadly toys. Faced with this choice, and given 
the information they had, the two leaders correctly 
concluded the costs of inaction far outweighed the 
costs of military conflict. Thus was a just war fought 
and won, no matter what the victors find in the sand.\" 
 
4.   \"What language is U.S. speaking in Iraq?\" 
Editorial page editor emeritus Haroon Siddiqui observed 
in the liberal Toronto Star (8/11): \"One cringes on 
hearing some Americans analyze non-Americans.... What 
planet do these Americans live on? Or are they so 
preoccupied spinning propaganda that they have no sense 
of reality? Or is it that they just don\'t care what 
anyone thinks beyond their core constituency of fellow 
citizens and foreign fellow travellers? So monumental 
has the mismanagement of post-Iraq been that essential 
services and law and order are still not back to pre- 
war levels. Looting has given way to carjacking and 
kidnapping. Iraqi frustrations over rampant crime have 
the eerie echo of 
women in U.S.-controlled Afghanistan who lately have 
been complaining that, under the Taliban, they were at 
least safe from rape. The Americans are operating in 
chaotic conditions under which many are getting killed. 
But they have contributed to the chaos by being ill- 
prepared for post-war Iraq, by being culturally 
clueless and trigger-happy.... The bombing of the 
Jordanian embassy in Baghdad Thursday had the stamp of 
Al Qaeda terrorism. If so, the Americans have been 
going after the wrong people on false assumptions and 
weak intelligence.... American forces have been given 
the benefit of the doubt because they\'ve been facing 
guerrilla attacks. But their actions and, in fact, 
their entire approach to the occupation raise 
disturbing questions, summarized in what Iraqis most 
often ask visitors: \'How do Americans think of us, as 
Iraqis or as animals? Why do they treat us like 
cattle?\'\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
5.   \"Next stop, North Korea?\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/11): \"Is the 
United States starting to prepare for war against North 
Korea? One might think so, considering the 
sabre-rattling in Washington even as the American 
military is fully engaged in Iraq. The latest warning 
came last week from James Woolsey, a former CIA 
director.... The prospect will strike many observers as 
the height of folly - how, for a start, would the U.S. 
expect China to react to an American invasion next 
door? - but in some quarters in Washington it is being 
taken very seriously. Mr. Woolsey, who is thought to 
reflect much Pentagon thinking, was an early proponent 
of an invasion of Iraq. That he has turned his 
attention to North Korea is hardly insignificant.... To 
what degree, however, is this merely geopolitical 
gamesmanship? The blunt talk is 
occurring when there is also tangible progress in 
diplomatic efforts to negotiate an end to the 
impasse..... The six-party talks, expected to begin 
this month or early in September, should clarify 
matters. Some form of non-aggression agreement is 
certain to be opposed by those in Washington who 
are convinced regime change is as legitimate an 
objective in North Korea as in Iraq. And, they point 
out, any deal to shut down North Korea\'s nuclear 
facilities will be only as good as the verification 
process. It will have to include sweeping inspections, 
given North Korea\'s history of duplicity. Still, a 
multilateral pact appears significantly more attainable 
now than just a few months ago, and would be infinitely 
preferable to a war that might result in a loss of life 
not unlike what occurred 50 years ago in the Korean 
War. As long as progress is being made at the 
negotiating table to blunt the threat from North Korea, 
it should be pursued with full effort.\" 
 
ICC 
6.   \"In dire need of international court\" 
London-based independent journalist Gwynne Dyer wrote 
in the liberal Toronto Star (8/11): \"...Current 
attempts to bring genocidal killers to justice around 
the world are scattered and stumbling. Cambodia has 
just announced that only the 10 most senior surviving 
Khmer Rouge leaders will stand trial for the slaughter 
of the killing fields that cost 1.7 million lives in 
the late \'70s.... Or look at the U.S. and British 
attempts to remove Carla Del Ponte as chief prosecutor 
for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The 
stated reason is because she is too busy as chief 
prosecutor for former Yugoslavia, but it\'s really about 
stopping her from expanding the indictments beyond 
members of the former Hutu government to include 
members of the current Tutsi-led government of 
Rwanda.... If no permanent and independent body has the 
authority to deal with this sort of crime, then it 
will be politics that decides who is punished and who 
gets off. The International Criminal Court, which came 
into formal legal existence on July 1, 2002, was 
designed to move the world on from that primitive 
system. But it is under heavy assault by the current 
U.S. administration, which loathes the very idea of the 
ICC. Why? The United States says it fears that American 
service personnel engaged in international peacekeeping 
operations might become victims of nuisance 
prosecutions brought by the ICC, whose judges it does 
not control.... The ICC has become an obsession of the 
Bush administration, which sees all international 
structures that are beyond Washington\'s control as 
potentially hostile curbs on the exercise of American 
power. Latterly, Washington has even been cutting 
military aid to poor countries that refuse to sign 
treaties promising never to hand American 
personnel over to the ICC. Yet the ICC is up and 
running. Its 18 judges - distinguished jurists from 18 
different countries - were selected last year, 
and chief prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former 
prosecutor of the Argentine junta, was inaugurated in 
June.... It will take time for the ICC to have an 
impact, because it cannot deal with crimes committed 
before July, 2002. It will take even more time because 
of American attempts to sabotage it, but since U.S. 
hostility is driven by ideology rather than national 
interest, that could change as soon as the next 
administration. The goal is to create a single standard 
and a single authority for dealing with 
genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when 
local governments are unable or unwilling to act. Ten 
years from now we will probably be a lot closer to that 
goal.\"

-------- 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
1.  The Canadian Government desires to work closely with USG 
on biosecurity and harmonize forthcoming regulations 
stemming from the Bioterrorism Act (BTA).  During an August 
12 meeting with Robert Wright, number two at the Privy 
Council Office (PCO) and overseer of Canada\'s border 
security efforts, Wright emphasized that a principal 
objective of the GoC is to act in concert with the USG in 
order to enhance the collective physical and economic 
security of Canada and the United States.  Wright focused on 
FDA advance prior notice rules as a specific example of an 
area where collaboration would enhance collective security. 
Wright expressed a strong desire that USG and GoC work 
closely and share information during the development of such 
regulations that may have an effect on the physical and 
economic security of both countries.  More immediately, 
Wright asked how the GoC and USG might, even at this late

account for the deeply integrated nature of the Canada-U.S.

information that may further assuage GOC concerns.  End 
Summary 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
GoC wants to contribute to \"Collective Security\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  Deputy Chief of Mission, accompanied by other State, 
Agriculture and Customs officers met with Robert Wright, 
Assistant Secretary to Cabinet and Coordinator for Security 
and Intelligence, for the Privy Council Office (PCO) August 
12. Also present were Graham Flack, Director of the PCO 
Border Task Force, Anthony Ritchie, Senior Policy Advisor, 
Security and Intelligence, and other PCO staff.  The PCO 
manages the Canadian government bureaucracy, combining some 
of the functions of the U.S. National Security Council, the 
Office of Management and Budget, and the White House staff. 
Wright is also the principal assistant to Deputy Prime 
Minister Manley and Canada\'s point man on the Ridge-Manley 
\"Smart Border\" process. This is a new job for Wright - who 
is a long-time GOC senior mandarin.  The intent of the 
meeting was an introductory call and to allow Wright to 
discuss issues we knew were on his mind. 
 
3.  Wright started the meeting by expressing his 
professional and personal appreciation for the mature and 
helpful manner in which the U.S. responded to the SARS and 
BSE crises.  Unlike other countries, the U.S. based its 
actions on sound science with a view toward assisting its 
close ally.  Wright then turned to the subject of new USG 
border-crossing rules that require pre-notification, some 
developed by U.S. Customs and others by the FDA.   He 
explained how well the process had gone, in his view, with 
US Customs in formulating the new rules, in particular U.S. 
and Canadian rules on pre-notification times and other 
details of cross-border trade.  The new rules in each 
country are now nicely meshed, Wright said.  He wants to 
accomplish the same with the upcoming FDA rules on food 
importation, but, unfortunately, he remarked, the stage is 
not being set as effectively with FDA as it was with US 
Customs. 
4.  Embassy officials outlined to Wright the USG rulemaking 
process, including the opportunity to provide comments 
during the appropriate period but not after the comment 
period has closed.  Emboffs also noted that we are confident 
that FDA is taking fully into account the detailed comments 
provided by the GoC, provincial governments and private 
sector players on the FDA rules. 
 
5.  Wright acknowledged the constraints in this particular 
rule-writing process, but emphasized that the GoC objective, 
because of the deep integration between the two countries, 
is to act in concert with the USG in order to enhance the 
collective security of Canada and the United States.  Wright 
told us Canada\'s modus operandi is for Canadian security and 
customs rules to mirror US regulation as closely as is 
possible, thus producing a harmonized security perimeter 
around Canada and the U.S.  In particular, Wright repeated 
his view that the pre-notification rules proposed by U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection on July 23, 2003 are an 
example of a collaborative process that enhances collective 
security. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Discussion Needed to Smooth Implementation 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. Wright suggested that the new FDA rules would be a good 
subject for the upcoming Shared Border Accord (SBA) meeting 
in San Francisco in September.  According to Wright, a forum 
is required to discuss the forthcoming rules and 
(ostensibly) how the GOC might begin to craft its own rules 
(but clearly also to allow GoC to gain a \"comfort level\" 
with the forthcoming rules). Note:  Mission understands that 
the BTA regulations are on the SBA agenda. End Note. 
 
7.  Wright observed that this autumn will be a sensitive 
period in Canadian politics due to a leadership transition 
and selection of a new Prime Minister, which will be 
completed this winter.  He signaled that immediate attention 
to working in concert on the FDA rules will attenuate the 
potential for any political difficulty arising in the wake 
of the rollout of the final rule in mid-October.   Wright 
suggested he did not want broad US-Canada cooperation to be 
derailed by the perception that the United States Government 
is imposing new rules that do not conform to the commitment 
of the two governments to work collectively on security and 
border issues. 
 
------------------- 
FYI:  Trade in Food 
------------------- 
 
8.  In the first phases of implementation, Wright is afraid 
the new FDA rules will hold up perishable traded goods.  US 
exporters are the dominant suppliers of Canadian 
agricultural imports, accounting for nearly two-thirds of 
the total, while Canadian exporters ship more than half of 
their agricultural exports to the United States.  Canadian 
exports of perishable food items, namely fresh and frozen 
meats, fresh fish, fruits and vegetables are vulnerable to 
spoilage and deterioration under lengthy border delays. 
According to the Ontario Food Terminal, Canada\'s largest 
produce terminal, virtually all U.S. exports of fresh 
produce to Canada are by truck. Rather than return to the 
United States empty, the trucks commonly return with back- 
haul. In fact, their original departure from U.S. points is 
often dependent upon timely back-haul arrangements. 
--------------------------- 
Comment and Action Requests 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  Wright conveyed two messages during the meeting: 
 
(A) From a strategic point of view, GoC believes it is in 
the interests of both the USG and GoC to collaborate closely 
and share information during the development of new 
regulations and rules that may have an effect on the 
collective physical and economic security of the two 
countries.  The shared border and the huge volume of trade 
make Canada a special case.  The \"ideal\" example presented 
by the GoC is of the cooperation between CBP and CCRA. 
 
(B) More immediately, the GoC wants some indication of what 
the final FDA pre-notification rule will contain (for 
example will the final FDA rule simply employ CBP pre- 
notification timelines).  Armed with this information the 
GoC would be able to begin to craft their own rules 
harmonized with those of the FDA. 
 
10.  Comment:  Apart from the issues of process and 
cooperation between Canada and the United States, 
inefficient implementation of the rules could pose the 
possibility of major disruptions in cross border traffic and 
trade, which is not in our interests.  The fear we heard the 
other day was that when the BTA goes into effect in 
December, if dozens or hundreds of trucks must wait for FDA 
approval, or turn around in cramped border facilities, the 
resulting back-ups at the border would not just be a problem 
for Canada, but for the United States as well. 
 
11.  Action Request:  In general, we assume Washington views 
favorably Canadian desire for additional collaboration 
during the development of regulations that would have a 
major impact on the border.  Specifically, with respect to 
the BTA prior notification rules being drafted now by FDA, 
what might be done (if anything) to assuage GoC concerns?

SUBJECT: CANADA: INITIAL FALLOUT FROM THE BLACKOUT 
 
Classified By: POLMINCOUNS BRIAN FLORA. REASON 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Residents of Ontario, with the exception of 
some 50,000 public sector workers in Ottawa, were expected to 
resume \"normal\" work routines on Monday.  Businesses 
throughout Ontario have been asked to cut energy consumption 
in half over the next week as the province tries to recover 
from last week\'s massive blackout.  Meanwhile, finger 
pointing within and between the federal (Liberal) and 
provincial (Progressive Conservative) governments was in full 
gear as the media sought to exploit miscommunication and 
disarray in both bureaucracies.   End summary. 
 
2. (U) With power more or less restored over the weekend, 
residents of Canada\'s most populous province (33 percent of 
the national population) warily resumed work on Monday, 
August 18.  In Ottawa, 50,000 federal, provincial and 
municipal public sector workers --except for emergency and 
other essential services personnel--were ordered to stay home 
\"until further notice,\" part of an effort to halve the city\'s 
power consumption until power is fully restored across the 
province.  In a live broadcast Sunday evening, Ontario 
Premier Ernie Eves urged businesses to help avert rolling 
blackouts through \"reasonable and prudent and conservative\" 
energy consumption.  Not all of the province\'s power stations 
are back on line and authorities are concerned about the 
possibility of over-taxing the still fragile electrical grids 
throughout the province. 
 
3. (SBU) Prime Minister Chretien, who remained in his home 
riding of Shawinigan, Quebec, throughout the power failure, 
was strongly criticized in the press and by members of his 
own governing party for failing to demonstrate leadership. He 
was due to set foot in Ontario today for the first time since 
the crisis started, to participate in this week\'s annual 
meeting of the Liberal Party Caucus in North Bay, northern 
Ontario.  The PM is drawing fire for his lack of visibility 
in the present crisis and for too-hastily attributing the 
power failure to a lightning strike on the U.S. Niagara 
Mohawk power grid, prompting some Liberal MPs to call for his 
early resignation.  Defense Minister McCallum has been 
criticized as well for adding to the public confusion in the 
early stages of the outage by suggesting, also incorrectly, 
that the failure involved a nuclear power plant in 
Pennsylvania. 
 
4. (C) Comment:  Efforts to reach host government officials 
about the power situation and the government\'s handling of 
the crisis met with little success this first day back to 
work. We will pass along new information as it comes 
available. 
 
5. (C) Comment continued: Though electric power is a 
provincial responsibility, ordinary citizens and a number of 
MPs have voiced fresh outrage over the apparent lack of 
communication within the federal government throughout the 
power crisis and the Prime Minister\'s disengagement. Such 
expressions of disappointment are almost futile, however, 
given the few months remaining in Chretien\'s political tenure 
and his focus on pending retirement. Nonetheless, in view of 
the already existing rifts within the Liberal Caucus (one 
third oppose gay unions being pushed by the administration), 
this week\'s annual meeting promises to be lively. End 
comment.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (C) Canada\'s Foreign Ministry (DFAIT) informed us on 
August 15 that should the USG decide to press for a 
resolution of non-compliance at the September IAEA Board of 
Governors meeting, Canada will \"fully and actively\" support 
us.  Foreign Minister Graham has written to IAEA DG El 
Baradei, urging him to take a tough approach in his report on 
Iran\'s nuclear program.  The case of Canadian photojournalist 
Zahra Kazemi, who died in Iranian custody in June, continues 
to be a flash point for reformists and conservatives in 
Tehran.  Iran\'s inquiry into Zazemi\'s death and Canada\'s 
review of the bilateral relationship (also looking at the 
nuclear issue) are still ongoing. END SUMMARY. 
 
---- 
IAEA 
---- 
 
2. (C) On August 12, FM Graham signed a letter to IAEA DG El 
Baradei expressing Canada\'s deep concern over the Iranian 
nuclear program, which poses a \"grave challenge to regional 
and international peace and security.\"  Graham\'s letter tells 
El-Baradei that Canada and other countries have bent over 
backwards in funding IAEA verification and safeguards, and 
that the Agency in turn must be prepared to use all the means 
at its disposal in Iran, including special inspections. 
 
3. (S) Graham also informed El Baradei that arrangements are 
being made for Canada to share sensitive information on Iran 
(ref. A) with the IAEA in time to be taken into account in 
the August 25 report.  Terry Wood, DFAIT Deputy Director for 
Non-Proliferation, told us that the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service (CSIS) recently signed an information 
sharing agreement with the IAEA, and that CSIS would send a 
high-level official to Vienna in September to launch this 
process.  In the meantime, CSIS would provide some \"very 
fresh information\" on Iran\'s nuclear program to the IAEA 
Secretariat through British or U.S. officials. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
4. (C) DFAIT Iran Desk Officer Chrystiane Roy told us that 
Iran\'s internal debate continues over whether to sign an 
additional protocol.  She said that reformists were trying to 
decide whether signing the protocol would relieve external 
pressure, while Ayatollah Khameni did not care what the rest 
of the world thought on this issue.  Roy speculated that the 
government might try to sidestep Khameni through de facto 
implementation of an additional protocol without actually 
signing. 
 
5. (C) Wood noted that an effort to adopt a resolution of 
non-compliance at the BOG meeting might not be successful, 
but that the onus should be on others to show why this should 
be put off.  Should a resolution not be possible, Wood 
continued, we might pursue two interim steps: invoking 
Article 18 of Iran\'s safeguards agreement and/or Article 77. 
Wood felt these steps would keep the heat on Iran and build 
momentum in the BOG. 
 
-------------- 
KAZEMI INQUIRY 
-------------- 
 
6. (C) In the Kazemi case (ref. B), Roy told us that Canada\'s 
Ambassador remains in Ottawa and that the bilateral 
relationship is still under review.  Of the five officials 
Iran detained in July in connection with Kazemi\'s death, two 
female prison officials were released on bail.  The other 
three, all from the Ministry of Intelligence, apparently 
remain in custody.  Judge Esmaili has not yet issued his 
report on Kazemi\'s death.  Roy said that Esmaili has a fairly 
good reputation, and is perceived as neutral in the battle 
between reformists and conservatives. 
 
7. (C) Roy said that the Kazemi case continues to attract 
much attention in the Iranian parliament and media.  She 
noted that at an annual demonstration held in early August to 
remember the death of Iranian journalists at the hands of the 
Taliban, the journalists also commemorated the death of 
Kazemi.  Some Iranian MPs, she continued, have called for the 
prosecution of Tehran Prosecutor General Mortazavi, who was 
present during Kazemi\'s interrogation.

AFGHANISTAN 
1.   \"What should NATO do in Afghanistan?\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/18): \"What\'s to be 
done when your raison d\'tre has disappeared? That has 
been the question faced by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization since the end of the Cold War. Who is 
NATO\'s enemy now that the Soviet empire is gone - 
indeed, now that Russia is an associate member of the 
Western military alliance and nations that once were 
part of the Communist Warsaw Pact are full NATO 
members? NATO\'s military action in Kosovo in 1999, 
which included Canadian participation, was one 
answer. Work jointly to end bloodshed in your own 
backyard. But to the United States (and this was during 
the Clinton administration), the operation in Kosovo 
was a kind of war-by-bureaucracy. Other NATO members 
played a larger strategic role than their firepower 
warranted.... Now, however, NATO has gone to 
Afghanistan. Twenty-one months after U.S. forces drove 
the Taliban from power, the 19-member NATO alliance has 
taken on responsibility for keeping the peace in 
Kabul.... [I]t is less clear to what degree NATO is to 
become a force for pro-viding nation-building as well 
as security. One goes hand in hand with the other in a 
place such as Afghanistan, where the Taliban left 
behind an institutional vacuum. NATO, though, has 
little experience in matters such as the training of 
police and judges.... The Bush administration welcomes 
NATO\'s new responsibilities, and for good reason. The 
U.S. military\'s hands are full, largely in Iraq. The 
White House may have sidelined NATO after Sept. 11, but 
now it needs the help. Washington has also noticed with 
some satisfaction that nations which opposed the 
invasion of Iraq - Canada, for one, but also the 
dastardly duo (in Republicans\' eyes, anyway) of Germany 
and France - are contributing troops to ISAF, or did so 
in the past 18 months. There is evidence that the 
transatlantic rift earlier this year may quietly be 
healing, aided by the fact that ISAF\'s mandate is 
authorized by the UN. Indeed, some in Washington 
suggest NATO could be the perfect organization to take 
over the military occupation of Iraq. This, for now 
anyway, represents a reach. NATO must act successfully 
in Kabul before it should consider further 
deployments.... Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan\'s President, 
has urged NATO to consider an 
expanded deployment, as has Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN\'s 
special representative to Afghanistan. This would 
require, by most estimates, at least another 10,000 
troops - a contribution NATO is not yet willing to 
make. Canada\'s military, for one, is already stretched 
to the limit. Other NATO countries, though, are capable 
of providing additional soldiers. A NATO force that 
would patrol all of Afghanistan is worth serious 
consideration. Start with Kabul, certainly, but if that 
deployment is successful, NATO should be prepared to 
take the next step.\" 
 
2.   \"What a mess we\'re in\" 
Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis observed in 
the conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (8/17): \"...NATO 
troops are in Kabul not because the alliance wanted to 
get involved in Afghanistan\'s 24-year-old conflict, but 
because Washington browbeat Canada and its European 
allies into helping share the burden of garrisoning a 
conquered nation. Better, figured NATO 
governments, to placate Washington by sending troops to 
lower threat Afghanistan than to dangerous Iraq.... Not 
only are the U.S. and its allies mired in an 
intensifying guerrilla war in a chaotic nation, they 
now find themselves in league with world-class drug 
dealers. Afghanistan was the world\'s leading grower and 
exporter of opium, the base for morphine and heroin. 
When the Taliban regime drove the Afghan Communists 
from power in 1996, they vowed to eradicate opium, 
though it was the dirt-poor nation\'s only cash crop. By 
2001, according to UN drug agencies, the Taliban had 
totally eradicated opium production in areas it 
controlled. The only production of opium during the 
Taliban era was done by its bitter foe, the 
Northern Alliance. The Bush administration was giving 
millions in anti-drug aid to the Taliban until four 
months before the 9/11 attacks. After 9/11, the Taliban 
was demonized by the Bush administration and U.S. media 
for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden without first 
seeing evidence of his guilt. The U.S. invasion 
followed, the Taliban was overthrown and retreated into 
the mountains. When the Northern Alliance seized power 
in Kabul with help from Russia and the U.S., it revived 
opium growing and soon began 
producing morphine and refined heroin, processes 
formerly performed in Pakistan. Today, Afghanistan, a 
U.S. protectorate, is again the leading producer of 
heroin, accounting for 4,000 tons annually, 75% of 
total world production.... By helping protect Karzai 
and the Northern Alliance, Canada, like the U.S., has 
become an unwitting, but very real, accessory to the 
international heroin trade, and the partner of a 
criminal regime.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
3.   \"Negotiation still best way to de-fang North 
Korea\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Rogue nation is the greatest 
source of instability in the region,\" the left-of- 
center Vancouver Sun commented (8/18): \"Six-way talks 
aimed at defusing a standoff between the United States 
and North Korea over the latter\'s claims it is 
developing nuclear weapons could begin as soon as Aug. 
26. Originally, North Korea insisted on bilateral 
meetings with the U.S., but last week it agreed to 
talks that would also include South Korea, Russia, 
China and Japan. Behind-the-scenes diplomacy from China 
apparently brokered the change in position.... The 
participation of the other great regional powers in 
helping to move this delicate negotiation 
forward is good news both for the U.S. and for the 
concept of multilateralism.... [B]ut the rhetoric 
between North Korea and the U.S. reached a new level of 
rancour when John Bolton, the seasoned American 
diplomat who is undersecretary of state for arms 
control, made a recent speech that personally attacked 
Mr. Kim for turning his country into a \'hellish 
nightmare.\' North Korea responded by referring to Mr. 
Bolton as a \'bloodsucker\' and \'human scum.\' All this 
might easily be dismissed as the over-inflated rhetoric 
that sometimes characterizes political negotiations. 
Some suggest it is part of a two-track American 
strategy for weakening the North Korean dictator\'s 
position by drawing a distinction between him and his 
unfortunate subjects. Nevertheless, the escalating 
insults do take place against a background of rising 
tension. While it makes sense to prepare for 
the worst in dealing with a rogue state, the best hope 
for resolving the impasse and persuading the North 
Koreans to forgo nuclear weapons still looks like a 
multilateral forum in which the regional stakeholders 
most at risk can also have a say. And, as frustrating 
as the search for a solution might seem, the present 
White House would do well to hearken to the tested 
policies of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Margaret 
Thatcher. They argued persuasively that the best way to 
improve odious regimes like the then-apartheid 
government of South Africa was not by isolating them, 
but by patiently drawing them into engagement with 
western-style capitalism and its benefits.\"

------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  An effective Canadian plan to deal with Alien Invasive Species 
(AIS) will require close coordination between provincial and 
federal governments, as well as renewed accountability and 
collaboration between federal government departments.  This cable 
outlines the federal-provincial jurisdiction and federal 
departmental mandates and roles.  At the federal level, a variety 
of legislative instruments are already in place that can be 
employed to address AIS; and federal government departments have, 
in their annual business plans, publicly stated their commitment 
to dealing with AIS problems.  We expect these existing federal 
tools will be used more actively in the near term as GOC 
departments seek to demonstrate to the incoming Prime Minister 
that they are serious about AIS, and as a consequence gain 
support for the nascent National Invasive Species Management and 
Policy Framework (reftel).  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  In an October 2002 Report, the Canadian Commissioner of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) devoted an entire 
chapter to the pressing issue of alien invasive species (AIS). 
The report noted that AIS are the 2nd leading cause of 
biodiversity loss in Canada (after habitat destruction) and 
inflict billions of dollars of damage to the economy every year. 
In 1992, Canada signed the United Nations Convention on 
Biological Diversity, which included a pledge to prevent and/or 
control AIS.  According to the Commissioner\'s report, however, 
there has been no effective GOC action on AIS. Indeed, the report 
found that, despite increasing numbers of invasive species 
entering Canada and their growing destructive influence, federal 
government efforts to deal with this issue remain in disarray, 
with \"no clear understanding... who will do what to respond.\" 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Federal-Provincial Jurisdictional Split 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  Invasive species involve an expansive category of environmental 
responsibilities apportioned between the various levels of 
government in Canada.  The federal and provincial governments 
share jurisdiction for the protection of the environment 
according to the distribution of their legislative powers as 
described in the Canadian Constitution.  For example, federal 
agencies such as Transport Canada and the Department of Fisheries 
and Oceans (DFO) have authority on environmental issues relating 
to: inter-provincial and international transportation and 
communication; navigation and shipping; and sea coast and inland 
fisheries.  On the other hand, management of public lands and 
wildlife, considered \"natural resources,\" come under provincial 
jurisdiction and responsibilities.  On some issues, such as 
agriculture, the Canadian Constitution gives concurrent 
jurisdiction to Ottawa and the provinces. 
 
4.  Clearly, for a coordinated nationwide approach to AIS, both the 
federal and provincial levels of government must be involved. 
However, the federal agencies usually have a role to play 
whenever provincial borders are crossed; thus the federal 
agencies are best positioned to take the lead in coordinating an 
overarching national plan.  The focus of this cable is, 
therefore, on describing the mandates and activities of key 
federal departments with a stake in the AIS issue.  We intend to 
provide a description of provincial activities and 
responsibilities in future reporting on this issue. 
 
------------------ 
Environment Canada 
------------------ 
 
5.  Environment Canada (EC) (www.ec.gc.ca) is the coordinating federa 
department in the development of a national invasive species 
strategy.  The Department of the Environment Act establishes EC\'s 
authority over \"all matters relating to the preservation and 
enhancement of the quality of the natural environment,\" making it 
the natural choice to play a central role in any AIS effort. 
The mandate includes \"the enforcement of rules and regulations 
arising from the advice of the International Joint Commission 
relating to boundary waters\" and entitles EC to deal with 
questions arising between the US and Canada related to 
environmental quality. 
 
6. Within EC, the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) handles the 
federal government\'s responsibilities on wildlife issues, 
including protecting nationally important wildlife habitat 
and conducting scientific research.  Of key significance, 
the CWS, with the assistance of other federal departments 
and provincial and territorial wildlife agencies, 
administers the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and 
Regulation of Inter-provincial and International Trade Act 
(WAPPRIITA).  WAPPRIITA regulates the movement of wild 
species to and from Canada and within its provinces and 
territories in order to \"protect Canadian ecosystems from 
the introduction of harmful wild species.\"  According to 
Robert McLean, Acting Director General, Conservation 
Strategies Directorate of EC, WAPPRIITA was designed 
expressly for the purpose of allowing the government to 
identify and place on a \"prohibited\" import list any species 
that could be invasive if it were to establish itself in 
Canada.  Indeed, the House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans (SCOFO) has recommended that grass, 
bighead, silver and black carp and any other aquatic alien 
species deemed harmful to Canadian wildlife or ecosystems be 
immediately listed in Schedule II (the prohibited list) of 
the WAPPRITTA regulations in order to prohibit their 
importation into Canada in a live state. 
 
7. Environment Canada also administers the Canadian Environmental 
Protection Act (CEPA) that provides a safety net for 
government action on AIS.  The Act provides the federal 
cabinet the authority, subject to advice from the Federal- 
Provincial Environment Ministers\' Council, to regulate 
\"toxic substances\".  Under the Act a \"substance\" is \"any 
distinguishable kind of organic or inorganic matter, whether 
animate or inanimate;\" and \"a substance is toxic if it is 
entering or may enter the environment.under 
conditions.having, or that may have an immediate or long- 
term harmful effect on the environment.constituting.a danger 
to the environment on which human life depends.or.to human 
life or health.\"

Transport Canada 
---------------- 
 
8.  Transport Canada (TC) (www.tc.gc.ca) works to maintain a Canadian 
transportation system that, among other things, is 
environmentally friendly.  TC\'s Environmental Protection and 
Sustainable Development efforts focus on ensuring the 
department\'s compliance with applicable environmental laws and 
regulations.  They are also directed to the need for TC to assess 
and address the impact its operations have on the environment. 
TC\'s environmental impact would include the risk of importing AIS 
along human and cargo transportation pathways.  Currently TC\'s 
main effort related to AIS concerns the arrival of AIS in ships\' 
ballast water (BW).  BW is internationally recognized as one of 
the most pernicious pathways for aquatic AIS and is presumed 
responsible for the presence of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, 
one of the most well known cases of an invasive species in 
Canada.  TC has \"the authority to regulate the control and 
management of ballast water\" in Canadian waters under the latest 
series of amendments made in 1998 to the Canadian Shipping Act. 
 
9. According to the 2002 assessment by the CESD, however, TC, despite 
having a clear statutory mandate, \"does not regulate ballast 
water discharges; nor does it monitor or report on compliance 
with existing guidelines.\"  The CESD also noted that \"Canada 
relies exclusively on US inspection and enforcement\" of BW 
practices in the Great Lakes and that \"there is no official 
arrangement between Transport Canada and the US authorities to co- 
operate on inspection or enforcement or to exchange information.\" 
Furthermore, the report points out that TC does not intend to 
apply planned mandatory BW regulations from its sustainable 
development strategy to Canada\'s coasts, leaving some areas open 
to new AIS.  TC has responded to the CESD criticisms by stating 
that it relies on the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) 
\"to identify criteria that could form the basis of an effective 
ballast water regulation\" and that these criteria have not yet 
been forthcoming. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
---------------------------------- 
 
10.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) (www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca) 
is charged with the support of economic, ecological, and 
scientific interests in Canadian oceans and inland waters.  DFO\'s 
Fish Habitat Management Program \"plays a pivotal role in the 
conservation and protection of fish habitat in Canada\" supported 
by its enforcement of the related provisions in the Fisheries 
Act.  The Fisheries Act, Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, and 
Fish Inspection Act could enable DFO to prohibit and monitor the 
possession or release into the wild of potentially harmful 
aquatic AIS.  The House of Commons SCOFO determined in its May 
2003 report on aquatic AIS that DFO \"has the jurisdiction and the 
legislative authority under section 43 of the Fisheries Act to 
ban the sale of... potentially invasive species of fish.\" 
COMMENT:  This recommendation may seem redundant in the face of 
WAPPRIITA\'s Schedule II list of potentially harmful species 
illegal to import.  It appears, however, that DFO, under the 
Fisheries Act, can prohibit the sale of these fish species 
anywhere in the country, regardless of their movement into, out 
of, or within Canada.  END COMMENT. 
 
11.  In its response to the CESD Report of April 2002, DFO committed 
to \"take the lead role with respect to the portion of the 
national action plan that deals with aquatic invasive species.\" 
It expects to have defined science priorities for researching and 
addressing the threat of aquatic AIS by fall 2003.  It remains to 
be seen how ballast water management fits in to these DFO 
priorities.  It told the CESD: \"it is not responsible for 
developing science-based criteria that could form the basis of a 
ballast water regulation.  This, of course, contradicts TC\'s 
position (para. 9) and illustrates the challenges of overlapping 
jurisdictions and responsibilities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency & Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
12.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) 
(www.inspection.gc.ca), which reports to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, conducts all Canadian federal food, 
animal, and plant health inspection programs.  It committed to 
addressing the threat of invasive species in its 2000 plan for a 
national import strategy and testifies to continued collaboration 
with other federal agencies on AIS in its 2003-2008 Corporate 
Business Plan.  Since its inception in 1997, the CFIA has been 
the agency of implementation for some of Agriculture and Agri- 
Food Canada\'s policies and laws, including the Plant Protection 
Act and the Seeds Act (see paras 13 and 14). 
 
13.  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) (www.agr.gc.ca), as well 
as the provincial agricultural ministries, have been conducting 
operations against AIS in one form or another for decades. 
Maintaining environmental health in conjunction with agricultural 
activity is part of AAFC\'s mandate.  Its Agricultural Policy 
Framework, developed in cooperation with provincial ministries of 
agriculture, recognizes the need to preserve Canadian 
biodiversity.  A Canadian Wildlife Service report (1993) on 
invasive plant species described the federal Seeds Act 
(administered then by AAFC but now by the CFIA) to have \"minimal 
utility\" for AIS control efforts, instead acting as a weak method 
of prevention.  (The report saw promise, however, in retooling 
the Provincial Weed Acts to improve efforts to prevent, control, 
or eradicate invasive species in Canada, via modifications to 
these Acts to update and expand the list of target species, 
enlarge the area of the laws\' application, and increase 
administrative resources for monitoring and enforcement.) 
 
14.  According to the Summary of Environmental Law in North America 
prepared for the North American Commission for Environmental 
Cooperation (www.cec.org), the Plant Protection Act (PPA), 
administered by the CFIA, is the most comprehensive piece of 
Canadian federal legislation that is relevant to controlling and 
combating AIS.  The PPA is designed to protect the agricultural 
and forestry sectors of the Canadian economy from pests.  Through 
this Act, the CFIA can potentially prevent the importation and 
spread of AIS and control or eradicate established pest 
infestations.  It gives CFIA the authority to conduct 
inspections, searches, and seizures of materials suspected of 
harboring AIS.  Except as permitted under the PPA\'s regulations, 
\"no person shall move, grow, raise, culture, or produce any thing 
that there are reasonable grounds to believe is a pest, that is 
or could be infected with a pest or that constitutes or could 
constitute a biological obstacle to the control of a pest.\" 
COMMENT:  The AAFC, CFIA, and PPA are concerned primarily with 
the safeguarding of Canadian agricultural interests against pests 
of all types.  Nevertheless, many AIS are included among these 
harmful pests and the language of the PPA allows for 
comprehensive measures to be put into place to protect against 
importing new AIS and to control the spread of established AIS. 
The umbrella the PPA sets up to protect certain economic 
interests can shelter other interests, both economical and 
environmental, against the harmful influence of AIS. End comment. 
 
----------------------- 
Canadian Forest Service 
----------------------- 
 
15.  Canada is home to 10% of Earth\'s forests, which shelter about 2/ 
of plant and animal species in Canada.  The Canadian Forest 
Service (CFS) (www.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/cfs-scf), part of Natural 
Resources Canada, has federal responsibility for the state of 
Canada\'s forests and it recognizes the increasing threat of AIS. 
The Forestry Act is the legal basis for CFS, through the mandate 
of the Minister of Natural Resources, to conduct \"research 
relating to the protection, management and utilization of the 
forest resources of Canada\" and to \"establish and maintain 
laboratories and other necessary facilities for those purposes.\" 
One goal of the CFS\'s action plan \"Biodiversity in the Forests\" 
is \"to further the understanding of the impacts of forest 
management... such as the introduction of exotic tree species\" 
and it identifies exotic pest species as a \"key biodiversity 
issue.\"  NOTE:  The CFS and Natural Resources Canada are absent 
from most of the major documents detailing the GOC efforts on 
AIS.  While the Canadian Council of Forestry Ministers is playing 
a role in the development of the national plan, the CFS does not 
appear to have a central role in a national AIS strategy.  Its 
mandate in this matter appears to focus on research efforts 
concerning the measure of biodiversity and taxonomy issues.  The 
CFS publication of \"Alien Invaders in Canada\'s Waters, Wetlands, 
and Forests\" in the fall of 2002 provides a useful comprehensive 
overview of AIS in Canada including invasion pathways, affected 
sectors, management and control efforts, and national and 
international collaboration on AIS, information on the 
publication is available at the CFS website noted above.  END 
NOTE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  Despite the absence of a comprehensive act or law addressing AIS 
federal GOC agencies can effectively employ a number of 
legislative tools in their efforts to curb environmental, social 
and economic threats posed by invasive species.  The Plant 
Protection Act (PPA), in place since 1990, provides a general 
framework for actions against exotic pest species, including the 
establishment of inspection facilities, checkpoints, and the 
authority of the inspectors to enforce regulations.  The PPA\'s 
broad focus lays the foundations for follow-up acts, such as 
WAPPRIITA in 1992, to reinforce and further define efforts to 
control AIS.  DFO and Transport Canada have the mandate and the 
resources to act quickly to protect against aquatic AIS under 
such legislation as the Fisheries Act and the Canadian Shipping 
Act.  As documented in the SCOFO and CESD reports, explicit 
action can be taken now to fight AIS, if these federal agencies 
have the necessary will and can commit needed resources to the 
task, as well as improve their level of cooperation.  GOC 
officials focusing on AIS know that their agencies must use these 
existing tools expeditiously and effectively to gain credibility 
for the nascent National Invasive Species Management and Policy 
Framework (reftel).  That \"national strategy\" is, in turn, an 
essential first step for Canada in its progress toward a North 
American strategy on AIS.

1.   \"Terrorists sproutinq under nose of American 
troops?\" 
Under the sub-headinq, \"Americans don\'t quite know 
what they are talkinq about when it comes to where the 
resistance is cominq from,\" editorial paqe editor 
emeritus Haroon Siddiqui wrote in the liberal Toronto 
Star (8/14): \"...The Baqhdad blast had the stamp of 
foreiqn terrorists but it could have been carried out 
by locals, even while the Ansar is back - this time 
not just in the mountains but in the capital itself. 
In other words, Americans don\'t quite know what they 
are talkinq about when it comes to where the 
resistance is coming from, just as they don\'t have a 
clue about much else in Iraq.... The two wars launched 
by the Georqe W. Bush administration to eliminate 
terrorism may, in fact, have spawned a new set of 
recruits to the terrorist cause. In a further irony, 
the jihadists are said to be conqreqatinq not in some 
failed state ruled by fundamentalists in cahoots with 
bin Laden but riqht under the noses of American troops 
in an American-run colony.\" 
 
MIODLE EAST 
2.   \"Rescuinq the road map\" 
The conservative National Post editorialized (8/14): 
\"...Achievinq the \'unconditional cessation of 
violence\' required by the road map will require the 
Palestinian Authority to crack down on terrorist 
qroups such as Hamas and the al-Aqsa Martyrs\' 
Briqades. While PA Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas has 
taken a firm line aqainst terrorism in his public 
statements, he must combine words with deeds. Indeed, 
he is obliqed to do so.... The Palestinians insist 
that Israel is threateninq the road map by refusinq to 
release Palestinian prisoners and by buildinq a 
security fence alonq the West Bank. This is nonsense: 
The aqreement says nothinq about either issue.... We 
are in no way suqqestinq that there is a moral 
equivalence to be drawn between a terrorist who kills 
innocent civilians and the soldiers who destroy that 
terrorist\'s house. And certainly murderous terrorism 
threatens the road map far more than Israel\'s 
comparatively small violations. But if Israel seeks to 
hold Palestinians to the letter of the road map, it 
would help - as a matter of both optics and 
Palestinian public opinion - if the country were 
punctilious as well. The road map for peace is not 
dead yet. And the aqreement may yet yield the stated 
lonq-term qoal of \'a permanent two-state solution to 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\' But both sides must 
do more. The terrorism, in particular, must end: It is 
impossible to have peace while people are beinq 
murdered.\" 
LIBERIA 
3.   \"Liberia after Taylor\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/13): \"...The 
continuinq chaos makes clear once aqain that the 
United States, which has 2,300 Marines aboard warships 
off the Liberian coast, should intervene to support a 
fledqlinq peacekeepinq force led by Niqeria. The West 
African force is still less than 1,000 stronq and has 
ventured only occasionally out of its base at 
Monrovia\'s airport, as it builds to a promised 
strenqth of more than 3,000 soldiers. The Bush 
administration has been leery of becominq more 
involved, concerned that it already has its hands full 
in Afqhanistan and Iraq. Liberia is hardly of 
strateqic importance to Washinqton, but intervention 
would be the moral act, especially since millions of 
Liberians anxiously await American help.... As for Mr. 
Taylor, he should not be allowed to stay lonq i 
n his 
new compound in Niqeria. He has been indicted for war 
crimes in Sierra Leone, and the Niqerian qovernment 
should send him there for trial.\" 
 
NORTH KOREA 
4.   \"Nuclear blackmail is the only card North Korea 
has to play\" 
Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe observed in the left-of- 
center Vancouver Sun (8/12): \"Senior officials from 
the United States, Japan and South Korea will meet in 
Washinqton later this week to try to hammer out a 
common front to deal with the nuclear threat posed by 
North Korea. It is by no means certain they will be 
able to do so. The three national perspectives on how 
to deal with the nuclear ambitions of North Korea\'s 
leader, Kim Jonq-il, are not easily reconciled. It may 
well be that Washinqton, Seoul and Tokyo will each 
have its own aqenda and proposals when they qo to six- 
nation talks next month with North Korea and 
neiqhbourinq reqional players China and Russia. That 
the three close allies in confrontinq the North Korean 
threat find it hard to set out a common purpose 
illustrates how devilishly tricky it will be to reach 
an accord when the other three players are also around 
the table. Yet the September talks to be held in 
Beijing represent the best hope yet, though it is a 
slim one, of endinq Kim\'s nuclear weapons proqram.... 
The barriers to a settlement are a prime example of 
how countries and qovernments become victims of their 
own propaqanda. Kim Jonq-il appears to truly believe 
the administration of Georqe W. Bush is set on 
removinq him from power....  Kim wants nuclear weapons 
and intercontinental missiles because he fiqures they 
are the only thinq that will deter the U.S. from 
attackinq him. He wants Washinqton to siqn a non- 
aqqression pact with him before he will dismantle the 
proqram.... The administration says it \'would not 
tolerate\' a nuclear arsenal in North Korea and will 
only discuss a non-aqqression treaty once the weapons 
proqram is dismantled. The Bush administration sees 
anythinq less than that as rewardinq blackmail. But 
nuclear blackmail is the only card Kim has to play. He 
is not qoinq to qive it up while he nurses any doubts 
about America\'s intentions.... [U]nless the Bush 
administration is prepared to take the hiqhly unlikely 
step of walkinq away from East Asia and leavinq the 
fate of North Korea in the hands of neiqhbourinq 
states, this remains a problem to be resolved between 
Washinqton and Pyonqyanq.... Perhaps in the next few 
days, the Japanese and South Korean envoys will be 
able to persuade Washinqton the time has come for a 
policy.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Bittersweet liberty\" 
Andre Pratte editorialized in Montreal\'s centrist 
French language daily La Presse (8/20):  \"...No one 
knows who is trying to put a spoke in the American\'s 
wheel...but one thing is certain, their macabre task 
will be rendered easier by the fact that they will find 
support among the general population. This is why the 
head of the provisionary government in Iraq, Paul 
Bremmer, must do everything in his power to win over 
the hearts of the Iraqis, if it\'s not already too 
late.... The American invasion was based on a 
simplistic vision of the world, the Middle East and 
Iraq. George Bush dreamed of killing four birds with 
one stone: Get rid of Saddam Hussein, weaken 
international terrorism, create a liberal democracy in 
the heart of the Arab nation and achieve a breakthrough 
toward peace in Palestine. Yesterday\'s events show 
that, for three out of the four, the President is still 
very far from his goal.\" 
 
2.   \"Complicated Middle-East\" 
Serge Truffaut commented in Montreal\'s 
intellectual/nationalist French-language daily Le 
Devoir (8/19): \"...Viera de Mello made a comment less 
than a month after his nomination that is now as much 
enlightening as it is topical. He estimated that the 
United Nations were in `a bizarre situation\' in Iraq 
because they are playing second fiddle behind two of 
its members, namely the United States and Great 
Britain.... In point of fact, however, if the UN 
Security Council saluted the provisional government in 
Iraq, it never recognized it. But it seems that this 
has convinced some Iraqi opponents to attack directly 
U.N. officials and their leader. They must perceive the 
U.N. as an ally of Washington and London.  A junior 
ally but an ally nonetheless.\" 
 
3.   \"Wrong target\" 
Pierre Jury editorialized in Ottawa\'s only French- 
language daily Le Droit (8/21): \"...Thousands of Iraqis 
are opposed to the American-British presence in their 
country. This should not surprise us. Some are loyal to 
Saddam Hussein and will fight to the death for him. 
Others are simply nationalists who do not accept the 
strong-arm method used by the Americans to invade their 
country, or the rationale used to justify it. The U.N. 
is not the United States. The U.N. is not an invader: 
The terrorists who killed do not have the capacity to 
discern between the two.... So long as these monolithic 
thoughts persist in Iraq, peace will remain a distant 
illusive objective.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Rebuilding Iraq remains crucial\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/21): \"Horrific as 
Tuesday\'s bomb attack was on Iraq\'s United Nations 
headquarters, no one who has followed events in 
that country can be surprised that matters have taken a 
turn for the worse. From the moment the United States 
attacked Saddam Hussein, it was clear that 
handling the instability caused by his departure might 
be as difficult as dealing with Iraq while he was in 
power, if not more so. The question is what Washington 
and the international community should do about it.... 
The bombing of the UN clearly marks an escalation of 
anti-American and anti-Western tendencies in Iraq.... 
This too should come as little surprise. It was all but 
inevitable that a host of anti-U.S. forces both inside 
and outside Iraq would seize on any opportunity to 
imperil the reconstruction effort, in order to make the 
West look as bad as possible and to drive disaffected 
Iraqis into the arms of the militant Islamist movement. 
There are any number of countries nearby with 
extremists to spare, including Syria, Iran and Saudi 
Arabia. That is precisely why the United States and 
others involved in the effort to rebuild Iraq should 
stay the course, if not redouble their efforts to bring 
about stability as quickly as possible. Any sign of 
weakness - any sign, for example, that President George 
W. Bush is wavering as a result of simplistic 
criticisms that his country is in for \'another 
Vietnam\'...will only encourage anti-U.S. forces in Iraq 
and elsewhere.... Rather than pull staff or troops out, 
the United States needs to provide more of both, and 
other countries need to help as part of a broad UN 
effort.... Rebuilding countries - or, rather, helping a 
beaten and starving populace to rebuild them - is not 
easy. It took years in Japan and even longer in 
Germany, and cost billions of dollars to finance. The 
reconstruction is likely to take just as long in both 
Iraq and Afghanistan. 
American and international forces don\'t want to take 
too much on themselves for fear of being seen as 
occupiers. Yet if they don\'t do enough, quickly enough, 
they will be seen as uncaring. More than anything, they 
cannot give up.\" 
 
2.   \"Sometimes it is \'us\' and \'them\'\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee observed in the leading Globe and 
Mail (8/21): \"If Tuesday\'s bombings in Jerusalem and 
Baghdad did anything, they served to remind us what we 
are up against. Any act of terrorism is savage, 
senseless, cowardly - the past couple of years have 
exhausted our language of condemnation. But these were 
acts of particular barbarism.... The United Nations 
says it will stay, despite Tuesday\'s attack, and that 
is good. However, Washington has had trouble persuading 
other countries to join a multinational force that 
would help relieve U.S. troops. Those countries should 
step up to help. The United States, in return, should 
be more willing to share interim control of Iraq with 
the UN and other international 
partners. In the Holy Land, confronting terrorism means 
taking a still harder line with countries in the region 
that support violence, such as Syria, Iran and Sudan. 
It means supporting Israel when it acts in its own 
defence to combat terrorist organizations. It means 
pressing the Palestinian leadership to crack down on 
terrorist groups. It means encouraging both 
sides to move toward a negotiated settlement that would 
help undermine support for terrorism. Just as 
important, confronting terrorists requires clear 
thinking about us and about them. And, yes, sometimes, 
there is an \'us\' and a \'them.\' This is one of those 
times. The fight we are waging is nothing less than the 
fight between civilization and barbarism. If Tuesday\'s 
murderous bombings did not prove that, then they proved 
nothing.\" 
 
3.   \"A truckful of evil\" 
The conservative National Post editorialized (8/21): 
\"The ongoing guerrilla war against U.S. troops in Iraq 
provides ample proof that, contrary to the Polyannish 
predictions offered by some American officials, a 
substantial number of Iraqis are bristling at the 
presence of foreign troops in their land. But Tuesday\'s 
truck bombing of the United Nations Iraqi headquarters 
in Baghdad...shows that the United States is dealing 
with something far more pathological than militant 
nationalism. The function of United Nations 
personnel in Iraq is to provide aid and alleviate 
hardship. Yet the terrorists who struck on Tuesday were 
willing to slaughter these good Samaritans merely so 
they could discredit the United States and its ability 
to maintain order.... Those who delight in skewering 
the U.S. war effort have pointed out that Iraq is home 
to more terrorists now, in the wake of 
its liberation, than when it suffered under Saddam 
Hussein\'s jackboot. That\'s true - but it misses the 
point. The perceived threat from Iraq, as we 
have noted often in this space, was not merely garden- 
variety terrorism - it was the intersection of 
terrorism, rogue power and weapons of mass 
destruction.... Iraq is now a magnet for Arab and 
Muslim terrorists worldwide.... Washington should warn 
Tehran, Riyadh and Damascus that if they wage war 
against the United States through terrorist proxies, 
they will be treated accordingly. Another crucial 
ingredient in any terrorist struggle is the support of 
the local civilian population. Despite the terrorists\' 
best efforts, the United States must win over as many 
Iraqis as possible by providing them with a better life 
- which means food, clean water, dependable electric 
power and as much security as circumstances permit. A 
homegrown army and police force should also be trained 
and deployed as soon as possible. In blowing up foreign 
soldiers and aid workers, terrorists can hide behind 
the conceit that they are martyrs and patriots. Once 
they are forced to confront Iraqis in uniform, it will 
become apparent to all that 
they are merely murderous thugs bent on denying the 
country a better future.\" 
 
4.   \"Attack in Iraq must be answered by greater 
international effort\" 
The left-of-center Vancouver Sun commented (8/20): \"It 
is a struggle to imagine what was going through the 
minds of the terrorists who engineered the massive 
truck bomb attack on the United Nations compound in 
Baghdad on Tuesday afternoon. What did they imagine 
they would accomplish by killing and wounding dozens of 
civilians whose only purpose was to help to rebuild 
an Iraq stricken by war and decades of brutal 
dictatorship? The question may contain the seeds of the 
answer. The purpose was perhaps a coldly  conceived, 
brutal act of terror against a soft target and aimed 
with malign forethought at the vanguard of civilian 
reconstructors. The message to the UN and to 
countries contemplating involvement in the rebuilding 
of Iraq is that they take their lives in their hands 
undertaking such work.... Iraq needs a functional, not 
necessarily perfect, level of security behind which the 
work of reconstruction can go on. And essential to that 
task must be a recognition by Washington that, like it 
or not, it is in the business of nation-building in 
Iraq. So far Washington has envisaged only a highly 
restricted role for the UN in the work of 
reconstruction. The attack on the UN in Baghdad should 
give Washington stark forewarning of the quagmire that 
awaits it if the terrorists succeed in isolating the 
coalition from the international community. Equally, 
the international community - Canada included - must 
recognize this attack on it cannot be allowed to serve 
the bombers\' purpose.\" 
 
5.   \"The tragedy of denial\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"A truck bomb forces the United 
Nations to confront terrorism,\" the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen observed (8/20): \"In the weeks after the Sept. 
11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the United 
Nations Security Council passed various resolutions 
calling on its members to cut off funding and support 
for terrorist groups. Nevertheless, the 15-member 
council could not bring itself to define terrorism. Now 
that the UN itself has been attacked by terrorists, 
perhaps it can.... The attack, like the one that 
followed a few hours later in Israel, is to be 
condemned, and, no doubt, there will be Security 
Council resolutions to that effect. But will the UN 
grasp its deeper significance and its lesson?  It\'s a 
sad irony that the UN has long been criticized as the 
patron of illiberal Arab-Muslim regimes.... Why would 
terrorists attack an institution that has been such a 
self-abasing apologist for Arab dictatorships? It is 
not hard to discern the \'mind\' and the motive behind 
the Baghdad bombing. On one level, this attack, like 
the recent acts of sabotage on oil and water pipelines, 
is intended to undermine the efforts of the U.S. and 
its partners to foster a stable and democratic society 
in Iraq. The terrorists want to show that the U.S. 
cannot provide the security Iraqis need to feel before 
they actively turn away from 
Saddam\'s lingering hold on the country. But there is 
also a deeper significance to this attack. Even though 
the UN has become an instrument of Third World 
appeasement, it is also regarded by Muslim extremists 
to embody western ideas of pluralism, human rights and 
cosmopolitanism.... The Islamists may have no rational 
political program beyond nihilism, but blowing up the 
UN headquarters, and killing a man like Mr. de Mello, 
who was once the UN\'s human rights commissioner, 
suggests a hatred for modernity, tolerance and 
globalism. How should the UN respond to this 
\'rejection\'? It can start by having the courage to 
define terrorism.... The UN, for so many years, ignored 
or minimized the crimes of states known to sponsor 
terror. Perhaps the UN wanted simply to be an honest 
broker. Instead, it became weak and ineffective, and 
all the while still despised by the very people it 
hoped to appease. 
 
AFRICA 
6.   \"No tears for a brute\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Idi Amin\'s legacy was to 
entrench the cult of African strongmen,\" the 
nationalist Ottawa Citizen opined (8/21): \"...Uganda 
was in bad shape when Mr. Amin took control, but he 
took his country to new depths. In the process, he 
entrenched a tradition that haunts the entire continent 
to this day, the cult of African strongmen - strongmen 
who plunder their countries\' natural wealth for their 
personal gratification, all the while repressing their 
own people with sadistic, almost bestial glee.... Other 
African strongmen such as Charles Taylor and Robert 
Mugabe are spiritual descendants of Mr. Amin. Mr. 
Mugabe in particular, through his persecution of 
Zimbabwe\'s white farmers, has carried on Mr. Amin\'s 
legacy of Afro-centric racism.... Today, Robert Mugabe 
continues to confiscate white-owned farms and 
distribute them to his cronies, just as Mr. Amin 
confiscated property belonging to non-black Ugandans. 
Mr. Mugabe is 
condemning Zimbabwe to poverty, just as Mr. Amin did 
Uganda. There is a lesson here, and some hope. Mr. 
Amin\'s long exile was morally unsatisfying, 
but the best thing for Ugandans. And last week, 
Liberian dictator Charles Taylor surrendered power and 
went into exile in Nigeria. Even Mr. Mugabe is losing 
control, as his African neighbours begin to lose 
patience with him. The developed world has done much, 
and could always do more, to help Africa, but 
ultimately it is up to Africans themselves to stop 
producing military strongmen who plunder rather than 
govern.\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"Going the distance\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Acts of sabotage must not 
disrupt the rebuilding of Iraq,\" the nationalist Ottawa 
Citizen   opined (8/19): \"...Unquestionably, the 
escalating attacks against coalition soldiers, 
embassies and, most recently, utilities - a pipeline 
supplying Baghdad with water was blown up and an oil 
pipeline set on fire over the weekend - threaten 
American plans for a stable Iraq. Yet it is an 
exaggeration to think the violence means the U.S.-led 
effort is faltering. Mr. Bush anticipated a long and 
hard war.... The challenge for the coalition is to 
create conditions that will allow Iraqis to feel 
secure. Acts of sabotage and random violence are 
demoralizing, inducing the kind of uncertainty that 
tempts people to support a return to dictatorship, so 
desperate are they for stability and order. This is 
what the saboteurs and assassins seek to accomplish: 
Undermine Iraqis\' confidence in the ability of the U.S. 
and its partners to bring order and freedom to the 
country.... The West needs to contribute more 
(police, administrators, engineers and doctors are also 
badly needed) to help Iraq\'s recovery. If not, the 
effort to reform Iraq, spark democratization in the 
Arab world, and ultimately win the war on terrorism 
will be jeopardized.\" 
 
2.   \"Mideast carnage tests our resolve\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (8/20): \"The 
limits of American power were on raw display yesterday 
in the smoking rubble of the United Nations 
headquarters in Iraq, and in the mangled wreckage of a 
bus in Jerusalem. After easily shattering Saddam 
Hussein\'s regime, U.S. President George Bush 
is finding it hard to win the peace in Iraq and restore 
order. And his drive for Mideast peace is faltering. 
The heavy-handed American occupation in Iraq is fast 
becoming the tragic shambles the critics predicted.... 
Whatever the rights or wrongs of American policy in 
Iraq, the U.N. is there to restore 
civilian rule after Saddam\'s criminal rule, and to 
rebuild.... The terrorists\' crimes must reinforce our 
resolve to rebuild a democratic Iraq and a peaceful 
region. In Iraq, Bush should recognize that American 
military rule cannot stretch out indefinitely. He 
should begin to extricate the U.S. by seeking a new 
Security Council resolution putting the U.N. in charge 
of a truly empowered Iraqi interim regime, replacing 
the Pentagon\'s fumbling provisional authority. The 
U.S./British occupation must give way to a broader 
international peacekeeping and rebuilding effort, 
underwritten by U.S. military muscle but drawing on 
Turkey, India, France and others.... There is no 
accommodating terror. It marches to a perverse logic 
all its own. But offering Iraqis a speedier return to 
self-rule and normalcy, and offering Palestinians and 
Israelis hope, are the surest ways to subvert terror\'s 
murderous appeal.\" 
 
AFRICA 
3.   \"Idi Amin\'s end\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/20): \"It\'s a 
modern image so commonplace that it verges on the 
clich: A deposed dictator, driven from his country by 
a popular uprising or international diplomacy, relaxes 
with his retinue in a palatial mansion in some 
accommodating country, shopping in the local market and 
occasionally giving interviews. It seems laughable, and 
it is. But it is also an outrage.... Death should never 
be celebrated, but Ugandans must feel a certain comfort 
at the passing of the man who tormented them for eight 
long years.... There is no conclusive tally of the 
deaths Idi Amin caused, but it is estimated at between 
200,000 and 500,000.... At no 
time during those 24 years of luxurious exile did 
anyone try to interrupt his country-club lifestyle and 
hold him to account for his vicious rule or genocidal 
tendencies, and that is a slap in the face to the 
hundreds of thousands he oppressed.\" 
 
LIBYA 
4.   \"Libya pays for terror\" 
The liberal Toronto Star editorialized (8/19): \"It has 
taken 15 years, but Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi\'s 
pariah regime is finally being forced to shell out some 
compensation for bombing a Pan Am airliner over 
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people.... 
Over the years, U.N. sanctions and isolation have cost 
Libya a breathtaking $50 billion in lost oil sales and 
other costs. That loss will never be recovered. The 
U.N. squeezed Libya hard in 1992. Diplomatic ties were 
downgraded. An air travel and arms blockade were 
imposed. Sales of machinery to Libya\'s oil industry 
were stopped. And Libyan assets were frozen. This 
resolve forced Gadhafi to surrender al-Megrahi for 
trial. The Security Council deserves credit for keeping 
the pressure on. Gadhafi\'s offer of compensation now 
has France pressing for hefty reparations in the 
similar 1989 mid-air bombing by Libyans of a French 
aircraft with 170 aboard. Payments cannot bring back 
the victims. But Gadhafi\'s regime has at least been 
held to account for a hideous crime. And that is some 
comfort. It puts others on notice that the world is 
resolved to exact a price from those who practise 
terror.\" 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
5.   \"Bombings rattle Bush\'s Middle East strategy\" 
Washington correspondent Barry McKenna offered the 
following analysis in the leading Globe and Mail 
(8/20): \"...[Y]esterday\'s bombings, which killed at 
least 40 people and injured more than 100, have raised 
troubling new questions about the administration\'s 
Middle East strategy, particularly in Iraq.... So far, 
the U.S. people have remained strongly supportive of 
U.S. polices. Polls show that Americans overwhelmingly 
support the Bush administration\'s policies in Iraq and 
in the war on terrorism, in spite of considerable 
skepticism elsewhere in the world. But the danger of 
support eroding at home increases if the situation in 
the Middle East continues to deteriorate. It\'s becoming 
increasingly clear to many analysts that Mr. 
Bush\'s ambitious Middle East goals won\'t come easily.\" 
 
6.   \"Another reason to build the fence\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Separating Israel from the West 
Bank will help prevent attacks such as yesterday\'s bus 
bombing,\" the conservative National 
Post commented (8/20): \"...The real reason Israel is 
building the fence is to prevent acts of terrorism - 
such as yesterday\'s brutal suicide-bomb attack on a 
Jerusalem bus. Every nation in the world has the right 
- and, in fact, duty - to protect its citizens, and 
Israel is correctly asserting that right.... Almost all 
of the attacks have originated in the West Bank - none 
from Gaza, though its residents bristle equally at the 
Israeli presence. The reason is simple: Unlike the West 
Bank, Gaza is already separated from Israel proper by a 
fence. This fact provides grounds for optimism that the 
new fence, once complete, may cut terrorism 
dramatically. This helps explain why Palestinian 
supporters condemn the fence. Many falsely believe that 
terrorism - or the threat thereof - will force Israel 
to make dramatic concessions to the Palestinians, and 
perhaps might even lead to the 
destruction of Israel entirely. And so they naturally 
oppose any security measure that will impede the 
violence. It is only because expressing support 
for terrorism openly would be outr that fence 
opponents instead give us cynical claims about 
\'apartheid.\' All this said, Israel should proceed 
cautiously with the fence.... As far as is consistent 
with Israel\'s security needs, Mr. Sharon must also 
ensure the security fence does not penetrate unduly 
into Palestinian areas in a manner that suggests a land 
grab.... Moreover, wherever the fence is ultimately 
located, Mr. Sharon must ensure that the Palestinians 
whose lands lie in its path are treated fairly - and, 
where necessary, compensated financially for their 
hardship.... Ultimately, the fence will not bring 
peace: That won\'t come until Palestinians - and Arabs 
generally - accept the existence of a Jewish state in 
their midst. But the fence will at least reduce the 
human toll wrought by Palestinian extremism. In the 
meantime, it is not Israel\'s security measures that 
should be the target of condemnation, but the terrorism 
that necessitates them.\"

MIDDLE EAST 
1.   \"Shared vision can spare us from descent into 
barbarism\" 
Columnist Catherine Ford observed in the right-of- 
center Calgary Herald (8/22): \"...Moderation shouldn\'t 
be the dirtiest word in the lexicon of the Middle East, 
but it might as well be. As soon as the voice of 
reasonable compromise raises its head and suggests both 
Palestinians and Israelis are wrong in their separate 
ways, accusations of bias start. To be against the 
actions of the Israeli government is not to be an anti- 
Semite. It should never have to be necessary to point 
this out, but unlike all of the previous attempts to 
broker peace, extremists of both sides have hijacked 
the public debate. Israelis don\'t all support the 
actions of their government - and never have - any more 
than Canadians do. Or Americans. But nobody else has 
apologists with the ear of powerful people like the 
Jewish diaspora. And in no other case is political 
criticism seen as racism.... That the Jewish 
settlements on the West Bank are illegal is a fact, 
acknowledged around the world. That the Israeli 
government must dismantle them is obvious. But the 
extremists in Israel and their supporters have 
prevented their government from taking this drastic 
action and a democratic government that depends on 
coalitions to survive can\'t take the chance of losing 
in a non-confidence vote. There is precedence for 
choosing peace over accommodation, no matter how one 
wants to define the word.... We Westerners - Jewish, 
Arab or otherwise - can rail against the useless 
bloodshed and the suicide bombers, against the 
intransigence of the Jewish settlers and the chilling 
message of Israel\'s wall around the West Bank. But 
little we do will have any effect. We can, though, 
insist on the message of moderation and compromise not 
falling off the table.... No one can control the 
extremist factions allied against each other, but the 
countries they represent can call upon whatever values 
they share. Our sole job is to remind both sides in any 
conflict of that truth.\" 
 
IRAQ 
2.   \"Americans are stuck in Iraq for a long time\" 
Columnist Jeffrey Simpson commented in the leading 
Globe and Mail (8/22): \"...The Americans, having 
conquered Iraq on largely false premises, are now 
stuck there for a very long time, yet the longer they 
remain, the more likely resentment at their presence 
will grow. They have appointed a Governing Council, but 
cannot yet give it any power, since the first 
responsibility of any government is to ensure order, 
and this only the Americans can do. Order without 
popular consent means military rule, which is what 
Iraqis now have. Except that the order comes from a 
foreign power, or powers, and that kind of order, by 
definition, is proconsular government that, if 
extended, means imperial rule. A long time ago, former 
U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower advised president 
Lyndon Johnson that the Americans had to win the \'minds 
and hearts\' of the Vietnamese to win that 
war. The Americans never did, although they deluded 
themselves that they could, because Americans have this 
enduring conviction that their self-ascribed purity of 
motive, the one now being embraced by the 
neo-conservatives and liberal internationalists alike, 
will be welcomed by those they intend to \'help.\'\"

IRAQ 
1.   \"U.S. mired in a mess of its own making\" 
Contributing foreign editor Eric Margolis commented in 
the conservative tabloid Ottawa Sun (8/24): \"First, 
President George W. Bush, VP Dick Cheney and a coterie 
of neo-conservatives led by Paul Wolfowitz and Richard 
Perle misled Americans into an unprovoked, unnecessary 
war by claiming Iraq was about to attack the U.S. with 
nuclear and biowarfare weapons. This was a grotesque 
lie.... Next, the White House gravely misread the 
strategic situation by swallowing neo-con assurances 
the \'liberation\' of Iraq would be a cakewalk and oil 
bonanza. Last week, Iraqis responded to Bush\'s foolish 
challenge...by blowing up UN headquarters in Baghdad 
and inflicting serious sabotage on Iraq\'s oil 
infrastructure. These attacks show the U.S. has got 
itself into a truly awesome mess in Iraq. Far from 
easily plundering Iraq\'s oil wealth, U.S. occupation 
troops - almost half the U.S. Army\'s combat forces - 
are now under siege, at a cost of $1 billion US weekly. 
Bush has literally stuck his head in a hornet\'s nest in 
Iraq and is now getting royally stung. He, his 
scandalously inept national security advisers, and the 
media\'s so-called `Iraqi experts\' failed to comprehend 
that a U.S. occupation would be a frightful, expensive, 
bloody mess - a disaster that 
was totally predictable. Worse, the U.S. occupation is 
clearly creating the kind of violence and car bomb 
terrorism that Bush used as an excuse to invade Iraq. 
Call this a terrorism perpetual motion machine. Iraqis 
who resist U.S. occupation are branded \'terrorists\' and 
lumped into Bush\'s crusade against Islamic militancy. 
When the U.S. finds itself unable to 
crush Iraqi resistance, it will blame neighbouring Iran 
and Syria for \'fueling terrorism,\' and may attack them. 
Tehran and Damascus thus have every reason to stir the 
pot in Iraq to tie down American forces and make it 
less likely the U.S. will next invade them, as neo-cons 
are urging.... Worse for the U.S., Iraq may be emerging 
- like Afghanistan - as a new, pan-national cause for 
the Muslim world.... President Bush has conveniently 
provided anti-American militants and fanatics across 
the Mideast with an ideal target: the U.S. army in 
Iraq.... Each passing day makes Bush\'s 
ill-fated invasion of Iraq increasingly resemble 
Lebanon\'s ugly civil war in the 1980s.... The U.S. 
finds itself in a disturbing analogue of the long 
Lebanese civil war, with confused American troops, like 
Israeli soldiers in Lebanon, not knowing why they are 
there or who is the enemy and venting their frustration 
on civilians. Protracted guerrilla warfare eventually 
turns even the best-disciplined troops into brutes, and 
corrupts entire armies. The very neo-cons who fathered 
this disaster are now calling for more American troops 
to be sent to Iraq.\" 
 
2.   \"Baghdad bombing puts U.S. back on the defensive\" 
Columnist Jonathan Manthorpe observed in the left-of- 
center Vancouver Sun (8/22): \"It is an unpleasant truth 
to admit, but whoever launched the truck bomb attack 
against the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 
Tuesday has reason to be pleased with the initial 
results of their bloody work.... However, the 
purposeful targeting of the UN, whose prime commitment 
now and for the past decade has been improving the 
lives of ordinary Iraqis, has rewritten the equation. 
The truck bomb announced that the coalition forces 
may be occupying Iraq, but they do not control what 
happens there. It said Iraqis should have no confidence 
that America, the UN or anyone else will be 
able to deliver on promises to rebuild the country on 
the basis of a sound civil society.... It is no 
coincidence that this escalation in the type of 
violence comes amid increasingly detailed reports of 
radical Islamic fighters slipping into Iraq from all 
over the Middle East to join the fight against the 
U.S.... An alliance of convenience is forming between 
these `jehadis\' (holy warriors) and the remnants of 
Saddam\'s secularist Baath Party. A result is the 
creation of a much more sophisticated command structure 
among the resistance guerrillas and a more coherent 
strategic objective.... In Washington, there is an 
effort to grasp the truck bombing as an opportunity to 
persuade allies and others who were opposed to the war 
to now come on board. The administration of George W. 
Bush is very keen to 
make the occupation forces in Iraq more visibly 
international by drafting in contingents from such 
countries as India, Pakistan and even Japan. To that 
end, Secretary of State Colin Powell...was on Thursday 
working the corridors of the UN headquarters in New 
York.... Powell was hobbled, however, by an adamant 
refusal in the heart of the Bush administration to cede 
any military authority in Iraq or to give the UN any 
significant role in the reconstruction of the 
country.... Somewhat understandably, countries such as 
France and Germany which argued for international 
legality before the invasion, aren\'t rushing to assist 
Washington now.... Behind this too is the more mundane 
matter of money. The way things are structured at the 
minute, Washington is ensuring it will be American 
companies almost exclusively that get contracts to 
rebuild Iraq. But reports from Washington say the 
administration is reluctantly considering giving the UN 
some authority to share the contracts pie more widely. 
Because the alternative for the Bush White House 
probably would be increasing isolation in the midst of 
an unwinnable guerrilla war, it would be worth the 
money.\"

SUBJECT: CANADA\'S VISA ISSUING PROCESS 
 
 
1.  (U) (Summary) Canada,s visa issuing process closely 
resembles that of the United States.  There exist, however, a 
number of structural and procedural differences between the 
two countries.  In general, the United States tends to have 
stronger security measures in place and rejects a higher 
percentage of its applicants than does Canada.  In the last 
few years, Canada has taken a few steps to improve its visa 
issuing process, but a number of additional actions are 
needed to bring its practices in line with U.S. standards. 
(End summary) 
 
--------------------------------- 
The Structure and Staffing of CIC 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Poloff met recently with Keith Carter, Director of 
Citizenship and Immigration Canada\'s (CIC) Western 
Hemispheres Bureau, and received a broad overview of the 
Canadian visa issuing process.  Poloff also met separately 
with H.G. Pardy, Director General of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade\'s (DFAIT) Consular Affairs Bureau 
and received additional information pertaining to Canadian 
visa issues. 
 
3.  (U)  According to Carter, Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada (CIC) is the agency responsible for issuing both 
immigrant and non-immigrant Canadian visas to citizens of 
other countries.  It was once a part of Canada,s Department 
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), but broke 
off to form its own agency in 1994 and currently employs 
4,700 employees worldwide.   DFAIT continues to maintain a 
Bureau of Consular Affairs, but officers in this bureau do 
not issue visas; rather they have the responsibility of 
aiding Canadians abroad.  They perform duties roughly 
analogous to the American Citizen Services duties performed 
by U.S. consular officers. 
 
4.  (U)  There are relatively few Canadian posts that are 
actually staffed and equipped to issue visas.  There are, for 
example, only 18 such posts in the Western Hemisphere and six 
of these are located within the United States.  CIC uses 
these posts as hub-centers and applicants often have to 
travel outside of their home countries to one of these 
hub-centers to apply for visas.   Carter explained that CIC 
is experimenting with a drop-box system in which smaller 
regional centers collect applications and forward them on, 
without interviewing, to a hub-center for adjudication.   To 
illustrate, someone in El Salvador (a regional center) can 
currently drop off his/her application in El Salvador and it 
will be sent via the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing 
System (CAIPS) to Guatemala (a hub center) where an officer 
can decide to either accept, reject, or call the applicant to 
Guatemala for a personal interview. 
 
5.  (U)  Carter explained that CIC staffs its posts with both 
Canadian Foreign Service Officers and Locally Engaged Staff 
(LES).  The local hires are given a great deal of 
responsibility.  Most significantly, CIC allows them to 
adjudicate both immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Because 
they are given such a high degree of responsibility, these 
local hires are usually either Canadian expatriates or 
trusted Embassy employees who have served in the Embassy for 
several years.    While the Canadian Foreign Service Officers 
are technically the supervisors of the locally hired staff, 
the two groups, in fact, work side-by-side and perform many 
of the same duties.  This sharing of duties occurs even 
though the local hires receive both less training and a 
significantly less comprehensive security check than their 
commissioned colleagues. It should be noted, however, that 
only Canadian Foreign Service Officers have access to the 
actual visa foils, which are kept locked away, and the 
locally hired staff is also denied access to all classified 
information. 
 
6.  (U) Carter could not remember any recent occasions when 
locally hired staff abused their right to adjudicate visas. 
He said that when scandals occur, they usually arise as money 
is moved back-and-forth during the accounting part of the 
process, not from malfeasance in the visa issuing process. 
Carter did admit, however, that there are some regions where 
CIC feels that local staff could be easily compromised. 
Therefore, in these areas, CIC does not allow local staff to 
adjudicate visas.  There are, for example, no local staff 
adjudicating visas in Moscow or the Middle East, and in 
Beijing only Canadian expatriates are used.  The place where 
local staff adjudicators are most greatly utilized is in the 
United States. (Note: Despite Carter,s claims, there have 
been several incidents recently in which Canadian local hires 
have been found guilty of malfeasance.  Two weeks ago, a 
Syrian Embassy worker (part of the PA office and not 
affiliated with CIC) was fired after allegedly taking a bribe 
to help someone illegally obtain a visa.  In 2002, two 
locally hired CIC employees were fired in New Delhi after 
recommending favorable decisions for their relatives. End 
note). 
 
----------------------------- 
Canada,s Visa Issuing Process 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  Canadian non-immigrant visas come in only three 
types: tourist, student, or worker visas.  Canadian officers, 
however, have a wide variety of choices for rejecting these 
non-immigrant visa applicants.  The most often cited reasons, 
according to Carter, for rejection are \"insufficient funds\" 
or \"lack of bona fides;\" however, there is no overarching 
reason for rejection equivalent to the United States, 214 
(b).  A Canadian officer writes notes on all of his/her 
refusals and these notes are stored in the CAIPS computer 
system for two years. During this time, all other 
adjudicating officers can view these notes.  There is no time 
restraint on reapplying and an applicant has the right to 
reapply for a visa immediately if he/she desires. 
 
8.  (U)  Canada,s process for immigrant visas differs from 
the non-immigrant visa process.  The immigrant visa process 
involves a point system in which candidates receive points 
for meeting certain criteria (5 points for a high school 
diploma, 24 points for speaking both French and English, 10 
points at the discretion of the interviewer, etc.).  Once an 
applicant reaches the 75-point threshold, he/she qualifies 
for the immigrant visa.  The rejection notes for immigrant 
visas are kept for five years, three years longer than 
non-immigrant visas. 
 
9.  (U)  It is not unusual to have a high discrepancy between 
the visa rejection rate of an American mission and a Canadian 
mission located in the same country.  In Albania, for 
example, the U.S. rejection rate is close to 70% while the 
Canadians reject only about 40%.  This is most often the 
case, although not the rule: American visa rejection rates 
are usually higher than their Canadian counterparts.  Carter 
theorized that this discrepancy might occur because, at many 
Canadian consulates, a secretary acts as an initial vetter 
for applications and tells those with no chance not to waste 
their money.  This eliminates many potential rejections and 
deflates the Canadian rejection average as compared to the 
U.S. average.  It should also be noted that Canada,s refusal 
rate has been consistently climbing over the last few years. 
Statistics furnished by CIC show that the refusal rate for 
visitor visas to Canada this year are 3.5% higher than last 
year and student visa rejection rates are up 4.2 % over 2002 
numbers. 
 
----------------- 
Security Measures 
----------------- 
 
10.  (U)  According to Carter, the Computer Assisted 
Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) is not directly 
connected to any type of security lookout list.  There is, 
however, a domestic lookout system called the Field Operation 
System (FOS) that is maintained by CIC.  Adjudicating 
officers can perform security name checks using this FOS 
system.  Carter said that there are plans to integrate FOS 
into CAIPS by 2005 so that the two will no longer be separate 
systems.  Since FOS is not integrated with the databases of 
either the Canadian Security and Intelligence Services (CSIS) 
or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), its usefulness 
as a security mechanism is not fully developed.  Carter was 
not aware of any plans to consolidate these agencies, 
databases in the way that databases were combined in the U.S. 
after September 11th. 
 
11.  (SBU)  One of the larger security changes that CIC 
adopted following September 11th was reducing the number of 
countries that qualify for the Canadian visa waiver program. 
A few years ago, Canada allowed a great many more countries 
to travel visa free than did the United States.  The 
differences between the two countries have narrowed over the 
past few years; however, many of the countries that Canada 
has removed are considered by the U.S. to be relatively 
insignificant security threats.   After significant U.S. 
pressure, Canada did recently remove Saudi Arabia and 
Malaysia from its visa waiver program; however, there still 
remain some significant differences between the U.S. and 
Canadian visa waiver programs.  Most significantly, citizens 
of Greece, Mexico, and Korea are allowed to travel to Canada 
without a visa.  Carter said that Canada realizes how 
concerned the U.S. is about these three countries being on 
the visa waiver program.  He said that there have been some 
discussions about removing these three from the program, but 
he did not have any information regarding their imminent 
removal.  Carter was able to report that Costa Rica, the last 
country in Latin America able to travel visa free, would be 
removed from the visa waiver program shortly. 
 
12.  (U)  Comment:  Communication and cooperation between the 
United States and Canada on visa procedures have improved 
over the last few years.  The Canadians appear to be 
sensitive to U.S. concerns and are beginning to take steps to 
alleviate them.  The increase in Canada,s visa rejection 
rate and the decrease in the number of countries on the visa 
waiver list are steps in the right direction.  Canada, 
however, still has much left to do to reassure U.S. 
authorities that the country is not being used as a Trojan 
horse by aliens whose ultimate goal is to bypass U.S. visa 
requirements on their way into the United States.  Three 
significant actions that Canada should undertake are: 1) to 
reduce the level of responsibility currently enjoyed by its 
locally hired staff; 2) to create a consolidated database 
system that allows its Foreign Service Officers to do 
thorough security name check searches on applicants; and, 3) 
to remove Greece, Korea, and Mexico from its visa waiver 
program.

REF: STATE 245203 
 
Classified By: POLMIN COUNSELOR BRIAN FLORA, REASONS 1.5 (a), 
(c) and (d) 
 
1. (S) In response to reftel demarche, DFAIT Deputy Director 
for the Western Balkans Margaret Moores and Defense and 
Security Relations desk officer Kelly Anderson affirmed to 
poloff the GOC\'s commitment to seeing PIFWCs brought to 
justice.  Moores noted that while Canadian law precludes 
adoption of a \"black list\" targeting war criminals and their 
supporters, the GOC employs a rigorous and detailed screening 
process for visa applicants, including name-checks with law 
enforcement/intelligence sources. 
 
2. (S) Kelly Anderson, who follows Western Balkans issues in 
the NATO/NORAD Unit of her office, said that the GOC 
nonetheless does have the ability to blanket-designate 
members of a particular regime (which it has done in the case 
of Milosevic) for travel sanctions and restrictions.  One 
difficulty with this approach, however, is that the 
designation is \"in perpetuity\" and covers very senior 
political officials down to functionaries at the level of 
first secretary of a diplomatic mission.  Thus any 
bureaucrats surviving the fall of a regime to participate in 
a new government may require special waivers to subsequently 
travel to/through Canada. 
 
3. (S) Regarding the Trillium Foundation, Moores acknowledged 
the existence of an entity by that name in Hamilton, Ontario, 
as well as the \"Hamilton Chapter\" of an organization called 
Serbian Chetniks Ravna Gora (same name as entity in E.O. 
13304), ostensibly founded by Serbian immigrants who arrived 
in Canada post-WWII.  Serbian Chetniks Ravna Gora lists a 
Serbian Orthodox Church as its headquarters and bills itself 
as a \"cultural, political and social organization\" founded by 
veterans that \"fought under General Mihajlovic during World 
War II against the Nazi and Communists.\"  The Trillium 
Foundation (named for the official flower of Ontario) appears 
to be a longstanding organization that operates as a regular 
recipient of Ontario provincial government funding for 
community-based activities.  According to Moores, unless the 
Foundation and Serbian Chetniks Ravna Gora are registered as 
federal not-for-profit organizations, investigation of their 
activities would come under the purview of the province and 
not/not the federal government, an area for the 
\"intergovernmental process.\" 
 
4. (S) Moores said the Foundation came to the attention of 
DFAIT officials several weeks ago when an individual named 
Emir Ramic launched a letter-writing campaign with provincial 
and federal officials to discredit Trillium.  Ramic claims 
the position of \"Vice President, Canada\" of the Congress of 
North American Bosniaks (www.bosniak.org) based in the U.S. 
(NOTE: Access to parts of the website from SBU-internet at 
post appears to have been blocked due to Department Policy. 
END NOTE). According to Moores, Ramic has yet to substantiate 
his allegations.  The information in the Bosnian press 
article (reftel) tracks with what Ramic has claimed in his 
correspondence, although the fund transfer of USD 75,000 is 
actually a Canadian dollar amount.  Moores (protect) 
indicated that her office recently prepared a briefing 
package for Foreign Minister Graham, with whom Ramic has 
solicited a meeting (NFI).  She volunteered her personal view 
that Ramic seems to have a special agenda in trying to 
besmirch the reputation of the Trillium Foundation to cut off 
funding to the Serbian community group in Hamilton.

SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION: MIDDLE EAST 
 
 
MIDDLE EAST 
1.   \"Blowing apart Mideast hope\" 
The liberal Toronto Star opined (8/26): \"Millions of 
Israelis and Palestinians feel betrayed today, as the 
Middle East lurches back into chaos after a brief 
respite. Most endorse the American-brokered \'road map\' 
to peace. Yet they\'ve just seen their leaders fritter 
away a precious two-month truce. Palestinian President 
Yasser Arafat, furious at being sidelined by 
the Americans and Israelis, never did give Prime 
Minister Mahmoud Abbas the backing he needs to suppress 
extremists. Instead, Arafat undermined him.... Last 
week\'s horrific bus bombing in Jerusalem by Hamas, in 
which 21 Israelis died, was one of the most vicious 
attacks yet. But Israeli Prime Minister 
Ariel Sharon, too, has failed to live up to the spirit 
of the road map.... And Sharon\'s policy of hunting down 
and killing Hamas and Jihad leaders has spurred new 
attacks.... The violence of the past week should 
inspire Bush to get more actively involved, if only to 
salvage his own flagging credibility. This post 9/11, 
terror-fighting president has broad interests in Iraq, 
Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan and 
elsewhere. He has to be seen to be even-handed, as he 
tries to end three years of violence in which 2,300 
Palestinians and 840 Israelis have died. Yet he is 
being thwarted by regional actors who can\'t bring 
themselves to take the first steps. Bush must step up 
pressure on Arafat and Abbas to crack down hard on 
terror, so that Israelis can safely ride buses again. 
But he must also press Sharon to speedily quit the 
occupied areas so that the road map\'s pledge of a 
Palestinian state by 2005 looks like more than wishful 
thinking. The Palestinian and Israeli leaders must be 
prodded to places where they would not willingly go, 
left to their own blinkered vision. America\'s 
credibility rides on it. So do the hopes of millions.\" 
 
2.   \"Stand Firm\" 
Under the sub-heading, \"Western nations must not shrink 
from the escalating threats of terrorism,\" the right-of- 
center Calgary Herald observed (8/25): \"Middle East 
developments have led all parties to a critical 
confluence, which future historians will judge to be 
one of that blood-soaked land\'s pivotal moments. From 
western leaders, the situation demands wisdom, courage 
and, above all, resolution. At stake are two key 
pillars of U.S. Middle East policy. Failure does not 
mean the political status quo, but a fundamental 
reordering of the area, to the West\'s detriment. 
America\'s two regional objectives are a liberal 
democracy in Iraq and peace in Israel/Palestine, 
through the so-called road map process. Success would 
mean a better tomorrow for people who have never known 
hope. If the Americans can be forced out, however, 
Islamic theocracies from Iraq to Saudi Arabia are the 
most likely result - and even, perhaps, Israel\'s 
isolation.... The Americans cannot find Osama bin 
Laden. Powerful they are, but not omnipotent.... 
Likewise, they have deposed Saddam Hussein, but cannot 
find him. Nor have they brought peace to Iraq, much 
less the hoped-for better life.... Therefore, Iraqi 
nationalists have accepted aid from whomever offers. 
Facilitated by Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia, America- 
hating militants come to Iraq from all over the region, 
as well as Chechnya and even Bosnia.... Meanwhile in 
Israel, old hatreds - guided, we suspect, by those with 
a larger picture - have been manipulated in an attempt 
to demolish the second pillar of U.S. Middle East 
policy, a permanent peace settlement. The terrorist 
plan is manifest: inflame the whole region, force out 
the U.S. and remake the Middle East, not as a 
constellation of liberal democracies but as Islamic 
republics, nests of terrorism, a Taliban culture with 
Saddam\'s efficiency. The West cannot tolerate such an 
outcome. If we do not win today, we will have to fight 
again some other time. Fortunately, the English- 
speaking people can draw inspiration from their own 
defining moments, as when Abraham Lincoln took up the 
Confederate challenge or Great Britain\'s years standing 
alone against Nazi Germany. Today is another such 
moment, and it belongs to U.S. President George W. 
Bush. We must hope he can keep the American people with 
him long enough to see that his vision, not the default 
one, becomes reality.\"

1. (C) Post delivered points contained reftel on August 26 to 
Adrian Norfolk, Acting Director of DFAIT\'s Human Rights, 
Humanitarian Affairs and International Women\'s Equality 
Division. Norfolk said that Canada takes a long-term view 
towards the human rights situation in China. While Canada 
does not believe the human rights situation in China is good, 
Norfolk said, the situation is at least better now than it 
was 20 years ago. Canada is hopeful this long-term trend will 
continue, Norfolk said. 
 
2. (C) Planning is underway in Norfolk\'s division for two 
upcoming human rights dialogues with Chinese officials, a 
bilateral meeting in Ottawa in October and a trilateral 
meeting with China and Norway in December. Norfolk said that 
Canada and China have held bilateral meetings focusing on 
human rights each year since 1997. Norfolk feels these 
dialogues have been productive and that Chinese officials 
have reacted well to Canadian concerns. He noted, 
however,that unlike the U.S.,the Canadians have not set any 
real benchmarks by which to measure China\'s progress on human 
rights. 
 
3. (C) With respect to a China resolution at next spring\'s 
CHR session, Norfolk indicated it is too early to say whether 
Canada would sponsor or co-sponsor. He noted that such 
country-specific resolutions are an extremely sensitive 
matter for Canada. Norfolk said that if such a resolution is 
brought forward, Canada would oppose a no-action motion by 
the Chinese, although he noted that China would likely 
prevail on such a motion.

FUNDS USED FOR ISAF 
 
1.  This message is sensitive but unclassified.  Please 
treat accordingly. 
 
2. Summary:  Finance Minister Manley has asked government 
departments to cover unforeseen expenditures in 2003 from 
reallocation of existing funds.  Canada is using C$200 
million in \"contingency reserve\" funds earmarked for 
defense expenditures (over and above the C$800 million 
increase budgeted for FY 2003/04) to cover its 
participation in ISAF.  End summary. 
 
3. (SBU) Front-page headlines in Canada\'s major 
newspapers on August 27 erroneously stated that Finance 
Minister Manley planned to cut $200 million from defense 
spending and C$130 million from foreign aid.  Senior 
sources at the Department of Finance said this was 
inaccurate.  They explained to Mission officers that 
Manley is committed to maintaining a balanced budget and 
in February confirmed that government departments were 
expected to do the same; that unforeseen expenses would 
be covered from reallocation of existing funding.  His 
office also confirmed \"Defense will get what it needs for 
Afghanistan.\" 
 
4. (SBU) The FY2003-04 federal budget increased defense 
spending by C$800 million over the next 3 years, with an 
additional C$200 million earmarked for contingency 
expenditures in FY2003-04.  Manley expects the 
Department of Defense to use its $200 million 
contingency reserve to cover costs associated with 
sending troops to Afghanistan. 
 
5.  (SBU) The same holds true for foreign aid:  the 
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has not 
had its funding reduced; it has been asked to stay within 
its initial (generous) budget. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment: The newspaper headlines did not seem 
credible.  Canada\'s federal government still enjoys a 
budget surplus and the GOC had not indicated any need to 
dig into its emergency funds or the money set aside for 
fiscal prudence.  Therefore, spending cuts, especially 
in defense and foreign aid, which comprise a relatively 
small share of the federal budget, made no sense. 
Finance officials confirmed our suspicions.  End 
Comment.

SPECULATIVE 
 
 
Classified By: BRIAN FLORA, MINISTER-COUNSELOR FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS FO 
R REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (S)  Persistent Canadian press reports which surfaced over 
the weekend and have since been picked up in the U.S. allege 
that at least some of the 19 foreign \"students\" arrested 
recently in Canada (18 Pakistanis and one Indian) have links 
to al Qaeda and may have been plotting terrorist operations 
in Canada and the U.S.  Contacts of Embassy law enforcement 
offices have been told that the reports are sensationalist 
and appear to have little basis in fact.  The nineteen 
detainees, one of whom has since been released, are being 
held on suspicion of immigration violations.  No evidence of 
terrorist intentions or threats to national security have yet 
surfaced, though the investigation into their activities is 
ongoing.  Our contacts have assured us that they will share 
any significant findings with us. 
 
2. (S)  Last February, several in the group came to the 
attention of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) fraud 
investigators, who then initiated an investigation.  Most had 
bogus documents and many claimed to be attending a defunct 
business school in Toronto.  The press alleged that they 
engaged in a pattern of suspicious behavior (some were seen 
at a lake near an Ontario nuclear power plant at 4:00 am, 
another took an extended flying course, few had a visible 
means of support, several had apparently traveled to the 
U.S., etc.), but Embassy sources in both the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Security and 
Intelligence Service (CSIS) have questioned the accuracy and 
significance of the press reports, describing them as highly 
speculative and thus far unproven.  Something more serious 
could turn up for one or more of the detainees as CSIS and 
the RCMP sift through the evidence, but the most likely 
explanation for the roundup is immigration fraud. 
 
3. (S)  Our CSIS and RCMP contacts claim that they were not 
informed regarding the specifics of the CIC immigration fraud 
investigation.  Once the story broke, they were belatedly 
given the names and personal data of the nineteen detainees, 
which they have since shared with us.  Until proven 
otherwise, they see the nineteen as economic migrants who, 
typically, used fraudulent methods to gain access to Canada. 
Both organizations have promised to keep us informed as the 
investigation continues.  The RCMP also claims to have 
drafted a press report to downplay the terrorism angle and 
reassure the public, but the papers have declined to use the 
release, preferring instead to continue to speculate on the 
group\'s possible terrorist link. 
 
4. (S)  Comment:  It\'s a slow news period and the Canadian 
press has decided to take a sexy story and run with it.  We 
assume the press blowup came as the result of a leak from one 
or more of the CIC investigators, who may have been trying to 
promote their own reputations.  Responsible journalism it is 
not, but it attracts attention and seems to sell newspapers.

Ottawa Citizen (8/27): \"...[T]he situation [in Iraq] 
continues to improve. It was never going to be a rose 
garden, but it is clear to impartial observers within 
the country that Iraqis themselves are co-operating - 
the overwhelming majority within each of its religious 
and ethnic groups, including even the Sunnis, co- 
operating with each other and with the U.S. military to 
hunt down Baathists and insurgents, and rebuild the 
country both physically and institutionally, even 
through the baking summer heat. It is the most 
promising event in post-colonial Arab history. Yet it 
could all be overthrown tomorrow if the U.S. decides it 
cannot stay the course. Terrorism achieves its results 
by drama.... [T]he problem, from the political view, is 
that while the U.S. soldiers may be risking their lives 
for the good of Iraq, what they are doing for the folks 
back home is much less obvious. It is very real - for a 
functioning, non-totalitarian Iraq will make a huge 
difference in the fate of nations - but this requires 
some explanation. Back home in the U.S., people want to 
know how they are benefiting, by 
putting the lives of \'our boys\' on the line.... The 
American people have grown tired of being in Iraq, and 
want to move on. Their attention is refocusing on 
domestic threats, and the Democrats are making hay with 
the notion that progress against the enemy abroad is 
made at the cost of progress at home. This is a lie, 
but it is a good one.... The question on my 
mind is thus, will the Americans funk out? And the only 
thing I can say for sure is that if they do, it will be 
an unparalleled disaster. For 9/11 itself was the 
payback for the last U.S. funk-out from its 
responsibilities as a superpower.\" 
 
WTO 
2.   \"WTO: the rich get more\" 
Columnist Paul Knox commented in the leading Globe and 
Mail (8/27): \"...[I]f globalization is a win-win no- 
brainer, why are international trade negotiations in 
such a mess? There\'s continued pessimism about the 
chances of a comprehensive free-trade-area-of-the- 
Americas deal clicking into place on schedule at the 
beginning of 2005. That\'s also the deadline for 
finishing the Doha Round of negotiations under the 
World Trade Organization, and Doha isn\'t shaping up as 
a slam dunk either. Sharp splits among rich and poor 
countries, and those in between, will be exposed next 
month at a key meeting of WTO ministers in Cancun, 
Mexico.... Social activists have worked hard the 
past few years to challenge the notion that globally 
integrated markets will necessarily bring prosperity to 
the poor. Maybe they should relax. No one is 
working harder to discredit globalization than the 
representatives of rich countries at the WTO. When you 
cut through the verbiage, the message from the First 
World is this: globalization when it works for us; self- 
interest when it doesn\'t.\" 
 
AFRICA 
3.   \"The result in Rwanda\" 
The leading Globe and Mail opined (8/28): \"...Mr. 
Kagame now begins a new seven-year mandate. Helped by 
large amounts of Western aid, he has made the economy 
grow and promoted reconciliation at the community 
level. He has the chance to lead the survivors of 
appalling atrocities toward a genuinely democratic, 
prosperous and harmonious future.... For their part, 
Western governments must move beyond genocide-related 
guilt and begin to measure Mr. Kagame by the standards 
they apply to others. They and he need look no further 
than Zimbabwe, a few borderlines to the south, to see 
what happens when power goes to a strongman\'s head. 
History will judge Mr. Kagame by his ability to ensure 
that the poison of ethnic hatred is not supplanted 
by the vices of one-man rule.\" 
 
U.S. POLITICS 
4.   \"Howard Dean and the U.S. buzz\" 
The leading Globe and Mail editorialized (8/28): \"Is 
George W. Bush vulnerable in 2004? Until recently, the 
answer has been an unequivocal no.... But there are 
signs that may be changing.... Why the sudden buzz? For 
one thing, Dr. Dean is a ferocious and tireless 
campaigner. In the past five days he has made nine 
campaign stops in eight states. For another, his 
speeches pay scant attention to his Democratic rivals, 
focusing instead on attacking Mr. Bush and his 
policies.... Dr. Dean also appears to be tapping 
a growing vein of unease about the President\'s economic 
policies. He is a no-nonsense fiscal conservative, 
widely credited with balancing Vermont\'s 
books. He dismisses Mr. Bush\'s economic policies as 
\'borrow and spend.\'... Nor is Dr. Dean the only 
prospective Democratic candidate generating a buzz. 
General Wesley Clark, most recently CNN\'s top military 
analyst and formerly NATO\'s commanding general in 
Kosovo, has hinted that he may jump into the 
race. In addition to being a decorated Vietnam veteran, 
Gen. Clark is a Rhodes scholar and former lecturer in 
economics at West Point. Dr. Dean, no 
fool, has already named Gen. Clark as a potential 
running mate. Mr. Bush\'s second term is no longer a 
given.\" 
 
3.   \"If only money grew on bushes\" 
Columnist Marcus Gee wrote in the leading Globe and 
Mail (8/28): \"...If Mr. Bush and the Republican- 
controlled Congress make the tax cut permanent, as 
they have promised, it will cost Washington a total of 
$1.5-trillion over the course of a decade. As if that 
were not enough, the White House also wants to start 
providing old people with subsidized medicines. The 
cost over 10 years: $400-billion.... Of course, it 
would be hard for Mr. Bush to change course now. He 
sees himself as a man of his word. When he says he 
will do something, whether defanging Iraq or cutting 
taxes, he does it. But real leaders know that a change 
of circumstances sometimes requires a change of course, 
however embarrassing. Instead of stubbornly sticking to 
an outdated and irresponsible fiscal plan, he should 
cancel or delay at least some of his tax cut. Americans 
would surely understand. As they must know, the only 
thing worse for the United States than a tax-and-spend 
liberal is a spend-and-don\'t-tax conservative.\"

SUBJECT: NEW CANADIAN TRANSPORT MINISTER INTERESTED IN 
EXPANDING AVIATION AGREEMENT, ACCELERATING BORDER 
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, AND TIGHTENING PORT SECURITY 
 
REF: A) OTTAWA 2876 B) OTTAWA 2766 
 
 SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED--PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador met Minister of Transport 
Jean Lapierre on October 26 and learned his views on 
upgrading the bilateral aviation agreement and accelerating 
infrastructure improvements at land border crossings.  The 
Minister indicated he will push for both, and that port 
security will be assigned a high priority while he is in 
office.  The Ambassador and Minister pledged to keep in close 
contact and to work together on strengthening U.S.-Canada 
transportation links and border security activities.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) On October 26 the Ambassador met with new (since 
July 2004) Minister of Transport Jean Lapierre.  The 
Ambassador wanted to make an initial courtesy call and 
congratulate the Minister, and seek clarification regarding 
press reports of early October (reftel B) indicating that 
Lapierre wished to further liberalize the 1995 U.S.-Canada 
air transport agreement. 
 
3.  (SBU) Lapierre told the Ambassador that with Air Canada 
now on its feet, the Government of Canada (GOC) is ready to 
pursue an enhanced aviation agreement.  (Note:  On October 1 
Air Canada emerged from 18 months under creditor protection. 
Septel follows.  End note.)  Lapierre said he had told 
Cabinet that Transport Canada (TC) would prepare a formal 
proposal for how the GOC should proceed in improving the 
aviation agreement.  Lapierre plans to present this proposal 
to Parliament\'s Transportation Committee and ask its members 
to consider it.  Subsequently, TC intends to publicize a 
final, polished proposal (incorporating Parliament\'s input) 
and organize nation-wide public debates on its merits. 
Lapierre views an expanded aviation agreement with the United 
States as \"a non-partisan issue\" and is confident that all 
parties would join the present minority government of Paul 
Martin in endorsing an enhanced agreement--if the Canadian 
public signals it believes such an agreement is in its 
interest.  Lapierre promised to provide more details of the 
TC proposal after it has been vetted with Parliament. 
Lapierre added that Canada will follow with interest U.S.-EU 
aviation negotiations with a view to determining how U.S.-EU 
issues might impact negotiation of a new GOC-U.S. agreement. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Turning to the land border, the Ambassador reported 
that DHS Secretary Ridge and Deputy Prime Minister McLellan 
had a successful October 14 meeting which produced many 
deliverables.  Significantly, both the U.S. and Canadian 
sides had identified the Windsor-Detroit border crossing as 
\"a critical area\" that required attention.  The Ambassador 
noted that the two leaders agreed on the need to meet 
personally with the stakeholders and affected communities to 
demonstrate high-level commitment and identify viable 
solutions.  (Comment:  As reported in reftel A, Ridge and 
McLellan, or their representatives, are expected to visit the 
region within the next three months.  End comment.)  Minister 
Lapierre remarked that he had visited the area three weeks 
ago.  He was surprised to be told that the long-term 
solutions can\'t be operational before 2013.  \"That\'s too 
long,\" the Minister said.  The Ambassador expressed 
agreement.  The Ambassador continued that in the interim, 
until the long-term solutions are decided upon, the two 
governments should implement short-term fixes for the 
congestion at Windsor-Ontario, such as the recently opened 
new booths that had markedly increased traffic flows. 
Another short-term remedy might be conversion of the railway 
tunnel to a truck tunnel.  The Ambassador suggested that 
Canada and the U.S. should also look at alternative modes of 
transport, such as short-sea shipping to handle all-cargo 
ferries.  Lapierre agreed. 
 
5.  (SBU) Regarding plans for Transport Canada during his 
tenure, Minister Lapierre said that port security is his 
first priority.  Lapierre recalled that during several years 
as a news broadcaster in Quebec, he reported frequently 
(\"every two weeks\") on problems at the Port of Montreal.  He 
said that he wants to see more secure port operations at 
Montreal.  He observed that the registration process for port 
workers requiring background and security checks is a good 
step and one that is endorsed by the teamsters and dock 
workers themselves.  Lapierre urged that the clearance 
STATE FOR EB/TRA AND WHA/CAN 
process not be implemented too quickly, however, or too many 
port workers might abruptly lose their jobs.  The Minister 
said that five percent of current employees do not pass the 
clearance process, and he asked if the United States is 
having a similar problem with clearing port workers. 
 
6.  (SBU) The Ambassador and Minister Lapierre discussed 
other positive U.S.-Canada joint activities, such as 
registration of passengers for NEXUS-air in Vancouver and 
Seattle, Canadian partnership in the container pre-screening 
program at the Hong Kong port, and the joint operations 
between U.S. CBP officers and their Canadian counterparts in 
container targeting at Montreal.  In closing, Minister 
Lapierre said that they had covered all the ground except 
railways, and he proposed that the U.S. and Canada work more 
closely on this mode also.  The Ambassador agreed. 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment:  Minister Lapierre seems enthusiastic 
about his portfolio.  He appears to recognize both the 
challenges and the opportunities that present themselves in 
dealing with Canada\'s southern neighbor.  With a new 
government in Canada and a revitalized Air Canada, the GOC 
may determine that the time is right to review the aviation 
agreement with the U.S.  We will follow events and attempt to 
facilitate progress in the U.S-Canada transportation and 
border security relationship.  End comment. 
 
8.  (SBU) (FYI:  The GOC just announced appointment of a 
senior experienced intelligence officer as the Minister\'s new 
Senior Advisor for Security--another hopeful sign that the 
GOC will take transportation security more seriously.)

2.  (C) ACCORDING TO SOURCE A, DUTCH AMBASSADOR TO CANADA 
J.G.S.T.M. ((VAN HELLENBERG HUBAR)) IS SENDING A CABLE TO THE 
HAGUE STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE NOMINATION OF GENERAL HENAULT 
AS CMC.  AMBASSADOR VAN HELLENBERG HUBAR IS ALSO REPORTEDLY 
CALLING NATO SECRETARY GENERAL JAAP ((DE HOOP SCHEFFER)) TO 
COMMUNICATE HIS SUPPORT FOR HENAULT DIRECTLY TO SECGEN.  VAN 
HELLENBERG HUBAR SUPPORTS HENAULT BECAUSE HE BELIEVES 
SELECTING HENAULT WOULD BE THE BEST MOVE TO PROMOTE 
TRANSATLANTICISM AND TO ENSURE THAT INTERESTS &EXTERNAL TO

3. (C) ACCORDING TO SOURCE B, THE UNITED KINGDOM HIGH 
COMMISSIONER TO CANADA IS LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED TO SHOW 
LESS THAN VIGOROUS SUPPPORT FOR HENAULT.  HENAULT IS SEEN BY 
MANY UK OBSERVERS AS PERHAPS TOO POLITICALLY SENSITIVE AND AS 
NOT BEING VOCAL ENOUGH IN CALLING FOR MORE RESOURCES FOR 
CANADIAN FORCES.  WHILE POLITICAL SKILLS ARE CERTAINLY 
REQUIRED FOR THE CMC POSITION, SOURCE B BELIEVES HENAULT 
LACKS &THE BACKBONE8 FOR TOUGH ENGAGEMENT ON ISSUES FACING 
THE ALLIANCE SUCH AS TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THE NEW IRAQI 
ARMY. IN THE LAST MEETING BETWEEN HENAULT AND UK CHOD GENERAL 
SIR MICHAEL ((WALKER)), WALKER WAS REPORTEDLY VERY DIRECT IN 
A NO-NONSENSE REQUEST FOR CANADIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO ONGOING 
NATO, UN, AND COALITION MISSIONS.  HENAULT WAS APPARENTLY 
FLUSTERED IN THAT MEETING AND RESPONDED THAT HE COULD ONLY 
WORK WITH RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA. 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C) FIELD COMMENTS.  SOME CANADIAN SOURCES HAVE 
COMMUNICATED THAT CANADA WOULD WITHDRAW HENAULT,S NOMINATION 
IF HE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE U.S.  RO BELIEVES THIS IS 
UNLIKELY AND A HOLLOW MEANS OF ATTEMPTING TO FORCE SUPPORT 
SINCE THERE IS SECRET BALLOTING INVOLVED. 
 
2.  (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS.  WHILE CANADA MAY NOT BE LEADING 
IN NATO CONTRIBUTIONS, RO BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD BE PRUDENT 
FOR THE U.S. TO SUPPORT HENAULT,S CANDIDACY FOR THE POST OF 
CMC.  HENAULT IS VERY PRO-U.S., AND IS VERY POLITICALLY 
SAVVY.  HE IS ALSO SOLIDLY BEHIND EFFORTS TO TRANSFORM 
NATO,S MILITARY FORCES INTO AN EFFECTIVE EXPEDITIONARY 
FORCE.  AS CMC, HENAULT COULD BE RELIED UPON TO ADVANCE U.S. 
MILTARY AND POLITICAL AGENDAS WITHIN NATO.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, SNAR, PREL, KCRM, CA, Irwin Cotler 
SUBJECT:  CANADA: MARIJUANA LEGISLATION INTRODUCED ANEW 
 
1) (SBU) Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler re-introduced the 
marijuana decriminalization bill on Monday, November 1st. 
Along with a bill designed to give police powers to arrest 
and charge those who drive under the influence of drugs. 
The Decriminalization Bill was Bill C-10 in the pervious 
session of Parliament and is now numbered Bill C-17.  The 
second piece of Legislation was numbered C-32 during the 
last Parliament and is now numbered Bill C-16.  These Bills 
would decriminalize possession of small amounts of 
marijuana, replacing criminal charges with ticket fines 
similar those given for traffic offences.  At the same time 
they attempt to give increased power to police to deal with 
marijuana growing operations.  Minister Cotler went out of 
his way to try and avoid using the term \"decriminalization\" 
and instead referred to quote alternate penalty frameworks 
unquote.  He insisted that marijuana possession and 
consumption would still be illegal in Canada. 
 
2) (SBU) Just as in the old bill, under the current text of 
Bill C-17, criminal charges would be replaced with fines for 
anyone caught with up to 15 grams of marijuana.  Cotler 
stated that the goal of the proposed legislation is to help 
police forces with their efforts against on marijuana 
growing operations and related organized crime rather than 
minor possession cases.  In addition to replacing criminal 
charges with a system of fines, the bill doubles the maximum 
time penalties for those convicted of growing marijuana and 
creates new sentencing criteria for dealing with growing 
operations.  The new offences include; using a third party\'s 
property for a grow-op, creating a hazard to children, 
creating a general public safety hazard, and placing booby 
traps in a grow-op.  The maximum sentence has increased to 
fourteen years, but the Government of Canada has not yet 
addressed how often judges actually employ the maximum 
sentence. 
 
3) (SBU) The second bill, C-16 attempts to address the 
problem of impaired driving under the influence of drugs. 
Currently, Canadian drivers cannot be forced to submit to 
drug testing.  Under the new bill police would have the 
power to conduct simple `physical coordination\' tests if 
they have quote reasonable grounds to believe unquote that a 
driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  If 
satisfied that the evidence from the first test suggests 
impairment, the police may then demand that the person 
provide oral fluid, urine or blood for testing.  Reasonable 
Grounds are not further defined in the bill but it does 
state that police may begin to conduct their evaluation if 
they believe that a person has taken drugs quote at any time 
within the preceding three hours unquote.  Cotler announced 
that a $5.5million fund was being created to train police in 
impairment testing.  Critics state that drugs can remain in 
a person\'s system for weeks, which could result in false 
positives. 
 
4) (SBU) In the House of Commons the initial responses to 
the re-introduction of these bills fall along predictable 
lines.  The Bloc Quebecois is reported in the national media 
to have only minor concerns, and is generally accepted to be 
supporting of the Bill.  The Conservative and Official 
Opposition Justice Critic Vic Toews has warned that his 
party is concerned about the effects such legislation could 
have on economic ties to the United States, particularly the 
ability of Canadian goods to cross the U.S. border 
efficiently.  NDP Justice Critic and House Leader Libby 
Davies says the NDP will seek an amnesty for the 600 000 
Canadians she says have already been convicted of simple 
possession and therefore have criminal records.  The NDP 
also wants reduced fines for people with three plants or 
less in their home. 
 
5) (SBU) Comment:  One Senior Policy Advisor in the Ministry 
of Justice told Pol Off that he thought the chances of this 
marijuana de-criminalization bill passing unscathed through 
a split Parliament were nil.  He noted however, that since 
the PM had promised to reintroduce the bill, it had to be 
done.  Of the ten or so Members of Parliament who chose to 
speak about C-17 during the November second Question Period, 
six members raised concerns over the possible negative 
impact of that Government of Canada\'s De-Criminalization 
proposal could have on the U.S.-Canada border.  End Comment.

AND WORKS TO ENSURE SOLID ATTENDANCE AND SUBSTANTIVE AGENDA. 
 
TEXT.  1.  (C) THIS IIR RESPONDS TO CITED AHR ON THE DEFENSE 
MINISTERIAL OF THE AMERICAS (DMA).  CANADA IS KEEN ON SEEING 
DMA BE AN EFFECTIVE FORUM AND IS PROVIDING AIRBUS TRANSPORT 
TO CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THEIR 
ATTENDANCE.  CANADA WILL FLY AN AIRBUS TO MIAMI TO PICK UP 
MINISTERIAL CONFEREES BEFORE FLYING ON TO QUITO, EQUADOR FOR 
THE MINISTERIAL.  (FIELD COMMENT ) CANADA BELIEVED THAT 
WITHOUT FULLER PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY FROM CARIBBEAN 
BASIN COUNTRIES, THE DMA MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL). 
 
2. (C)  CANADA,S OBJECTIVES FOR DMA VI ARE FOCUSED ON 
DEVELOPING CONSENSUS AMONG MEMBER COUNTRIES ON THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES (OAS) DEVELOPING A JURIDICAL 
LINKAGE TO THE INTERAMERICAN DEFENSE BOARD (IADB).  SOURCE A 
SEES THIS AS BEING A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH 
CHILE WHO BELIEVES (ACCORDING TO SOURCE A) THAT THE IADB HAS 
OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS, IS INEFFECTUAL AND SHOULD BE ALLOWED 
TO WHITHER AWAY.  ACCORDING TO SOURCE B, CANADA WORKED TO 
ENSURE THE PRESIDENT OF THE IADB WAS INVITED TO DMA VI IN 
ORDER TO RAISE THE PROFILE OF THE IADB. 
 
3. (C)  ACCORDING TO SOURCE A, CANADIAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND 
DEFENSE INSIDERS REMAIN TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE MONIKER 
NARCO-TERRORISM APPLIES TO THE COUNTERNARCOTICS ENVIRONMENT 
IN COLOMBIA.  THEY ARE CIRCUMSPECT AND BELIEVE THE GOVERNMENT 
OF CANADA HAS FOCUSED ON BRINGING THEIR COUNTERNARCOTICS 
EFFORTS UNDER THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM TO GLEAN MORE 
RESOURCES FROM THE UNITED STATES AND GAIN MORE POLITICAL 
SUPPORT FOR THEIR BATTLE AGAINST NARCO-TERRORISM.  MANY 
CANADIANS VIEW THE COUNTERNARCOTICS CHALLENGES IN COLOMBIA AS 
A LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE AND VIEW THE PRIMARY CHALLENGES AS 
ORGANIZED CRIME, MONEY LAUNDERING, COERCION, AND DRUG 
OPERATION FUNDING IN THE TRI-BORDER AREA.  WHILE COLOMBIAN 
OFFICIALS CLAIM NARCO-TERRORISM IS BEING EXPORTED OUTSIDE 
COLOMBIA, CANADiAN OFFICIALS SAY BORDERING NATIONS ARE LESS 
CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL NARCO-TERRORISM ORIGINATING FROM 
COLOMBIA; AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MIGRATION AND REFUGEES 
FROM COLOMBIA, AND THE SPECTRE OF TRANSNATIONAL CRIME. 
 
4. (C)  CANADIAN DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE HAS NO 
POSITION ON VENEZUELA AND, ACCORDING TO SOURCE B, HAS NOT

SUBJECT: U.S. AND CANADIAN POLICY PLANNERS SEEK SYNERGY ON 
KEY ISSUES 
 
Classified By: Minister Counselor Brian Flora, reasons 1.4 (b) (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In policy planning talks October 28-29 in 
Toronto, U.S. and Canadian colleagues exchanged views and 
sought ways to synergize efforts on a range of global and 
regional issues.  The Canadian team briefed on Canada,s 
attempt through its International Policy Review to enhance 
public support for international issues and better focus the 
country,s foreign affairs resources on a few key countries 
and issues, notably Afghanistan.  They believe it would help 
Canada and all players in Afghanistan if there were an 
integrated international assistance plan that synchronized 
outside help, similar to that developed for Bosnia after 
seven years of ineffective ad hoc approaches.  The Canadian 
team believes that one of the key niches for Canada in this 
realm is that of assistance and mentoring to improve 
governance, and they are looking for ways to get more 
Canadians involved in this sort of field work.  The two teams 
also exchanged views on post conflict stabilization, with our 
Canadian colleagues expressing envy over the headway that we 
have made in this area, and briefing us on their more modest 
effort to have teams ready to launch when the post crisis 
balloon goes up.  Author Margaret MacMillan joined the teams 
for a closing lunch, and offered a historian,s perspective 
on current issues, identifying the rise of powerful sub-state 
actors as the key issue for our age.  End Summary

Canada Seeks Synergy in International Policy Review 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3. (SBU) The Canadians kicked off the talks by briefing their 
American counterparts on the status of the Canadian 
International Policy Review (IPR), a lengthy effort to bring 
much-needed focus to Canada,s foreign policy apparatus in an 
age of scarce resources.  The Canadians explained that the 
80-page document will attempt to integrate the efforts of all 
arms of foreign policy around the three-D,s of defense, 
development, and diplomacy. 
 
4. (SBU) The IPR begins with an overview of Canada,s 
international interests and why international affairs should 
matter to Canadians (the document will be public and will be 
part of a much needed debate in Canada, so is written as much 
to move the Canadian public as to synchronize and energize 
the bureaucracy).  The document has three key sections: 
security (terrorism, peacekeeping, regional conflicts); 
sustainable development and economic opportunities (trade, 
education, financial stability); and global citizenship (good 
governance, public diplomacy, and how to express what Canada 
stands for in the world). 
 
5. (SBU) There is a lengthy discussion in the document on 
what the various agencies can do to better implement the 
program and synchronize their efforts, and then a final 
section on how to best engage multilateral institutions and 
bilateral partners.  Chris Cooter clarified later that there 
was talk of having the U.S. partnership as a stand-alone 
section in the latter part of the document, but the staff 
realized that the U.S. was so central to each of the various 
elements that it needed to be addressed throughout. 
 
6. (SBU) The IPR also attempts to divide the world into 
categories to provide better focus.  These are: 
--    Global partners: G-8 and advanced democracies. 
--    Emerging Global Players: Brazil, India, China, etc. 
--    Pathfinders: Emerging middle powers that play a key 
regional role -- e.g. Korea, South Africa, Jordan. 
--    Third World: Developing nations without any particular 
significance. 
--    Failed or Failing States: States that are in crisis and 
cannot be ignored, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Haiti. 
 
A Canadian Niche 
---------------- 
 
7. (C)  Cooter said that the purpose of this exercise is to 
help focus Canada,s efforts on a limited range of countries 
where it can make a difference rather than disburse resources 
broadly.  The strategy is basically to engage with current 
and emerging global players to assist the pathfinder states 
who will then have a secondary impact on their regions, and 
to lift the failed states.  The design effectively skips over 
the mass of third world countries where development 
specialists have traditionally worked on small, diffused 
&feel good8 programs.  Hornby hinted at a turf battle 
between Foreign Affairs and CIDA over where to put Canada,s 
shrinking resources.  &They have money and we have ideas,8 
he said, and questioned whether it would be possible to get 
the &agrarian romantics8 to &discover cities,8 for 
example.  To the extent there is a need to work in 
non-essential third world countries, the policy planning 
recommendation is to do it from regional hubs.  From a total 
of as many as 30 program areas, the IPR would try to reorient 
CIDA to the three key areas of health, education, and private 
sector development. 
 
8. (SBU) The IPR will be completed in mid-November when it 
will go to Parliament for a public debate.  Other ministries 
such as finance, trade, and aid will also have input.  Hornby 
said part of the purpose is to engage Canadians broadly on 
the issue of foreign affairs, to show how foreign policy 
serves Canada,s vital interests and is linked to domestic 
issues.  Canadians, MacRae said, simply do not feel a threat 
and have trouble focusing on foreign policy.  In response to 
a question about resources, Hornby said the review would make 
it explicit that Canada is globally engaged and should fund 
its agencies accordingly.  The plan calls for an improvement 
in the efficiency of the bureaucracy to support such a global 
engagement, specifically by adding 8% per annum to Canada,s 
aid budget and resourcing a new brigade for the military. 
 
9. (SBU) Finally, there was a positive discussion of 
Canada,s search for a niche in the world that would support 
the advance of democracy while making a noticeable 
contribution.  Cooter said that Canada has traditionally been 
seen as an effective bridge (e.g., between the U.S. and 
Europe), but the question now is a bridge to what?  Dr. Reiss 
praised this effort as an effective way to find its niche and 
urged Canada to be like the College of William & Mary, which 
realized it did not have the resources to do all things well 
and has focused instead on doing a few things superbly. 
 
Coordinated Road-Map for Afghanistan? 
------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) The U.S. side briefed next on the positive trends in 
Afghanistan (elections, ANA, NATO commitment), and the 
ongoing threat from warlords, narcos, and insurgents.  Hornby 
said that Canada is definitely in Afghanistan for the long 
run but is trying to come to grips with how long that is. 
Again he inferred a split between the realists at Foreign 
Affairs and the dreamers at CIDA, the former seeing 
Afghanistan as Canada,s most important mission in the world 
at present, and the latter seeing it as taking away resources 
from places where they can help people in a zero-sum game. 
The political commitment is there for Afghanistan, however, 
Hornby said, and he is not worried about fatigue taking a 
toll on that commitment.  Still, he believes Canada worries 
about the continuing commitment of Europeans and already 
detects some drift.  MacRae asked whether we are at the point 
where we need a roadmap to help integrate political and 
security programs in Afghanistan.  It took seven years to 
produce a coordinated plan for Bosnia, he said, but we don,t 
have that kind of time for Afghanistan, and need to focus 
resources and synchronize our efforts now.  He thought this 
would help the Europeans and would certainly help Canada. 
 
Iran 
---- 
 
11. (C) Dr. Reiss led a discussion of Iran by reviewing U.S. 
concerns about proliferation by Tehran and discussing recent 
activities in the G-8 and by the EU-3.  The Canadians were 
interested in how adept we thought the Iranians were at 
playing the U.S. and Europe off against each other and what 
Canada could do to ensure their efforts strengthen, rather 
than weaken our hand.  Dr. Reiss concluded by saying that we 
were very concerned with the European effort to simply extend 
more carrots without contemplating the need for sticks, and 
that we need better overall coordination on our approach to 
prevent Iran from becoming another divisive issue in the 
transatlantic relationship. 
 
Iraq 
---- 
 
12. (C) The U.S. team also led the discussion on Iraq, 
outlining our plan for the next 100 days.  It emphasized the 
importance of security to get through the elections, and the 
U.S. hope that there would then be enhanced security because 
of the elections.  Cooter wondered whether it would be 
possible to place too much emphasis on the elections, given 
all the hurdles to doing them well.  Dr. Reiss responded that 
there is no good reason to believe that conditions would 
improve down the road, and they might actually deteriorate. 
Cooter suggested that the worst possible outcome would be an 
anti-Western nationalism and wondered whether, like 
Afghanistan, we would collectively benefit from a strategic 
plan for Iraq that included free trade agreements and a 
coordinated development strategy. 
 
Middle East 
----------- 
 
13. (C) Dr. Reiss began the discussion on the Middle East by 
sharing the reality (despite the illogic) with which the 
Israeli-Palestinian issue is placed at the center of all 
issues in the Middle East.  Dr. Lowenkron shared the key 
challenges we face with regards to the BMENA process -- that 
it not become the APEC of the Middle East, where much is 
discussed and little resolved; that we actively engage civil 
society; and that it be self-sustaining. 
 
14. (C) Cooter agreed with this assessment, suggesting that 
it would be easy to make this kind of forum one where leaders 
make their standard pitch and return home, rather than 
developing the sort of evolving and dynamic structures that 
could make real progress.  Hornby suggested the need to find 
a way to help our European colleagues to &get over8 Iraq 
and get down to work with us on this and other initiatives. 
MacRae added that in this particular framework the best niche 
for Canada is probably the improvement of local governance 
and the delivery of services.  Both sides agreed that a 
mentoring role in this area would make sense for Canada.  Dr. 
Reiss closed by suggesting that recent events present an 
opportunity for progress on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. 
 
Cross Cultural Dialogue 
----------------------- 
 
15. (C) Our Canadian interlocutors led a discussion of public 
diplomacy and cross-cultural dialogue with an eye to the 
Muslim community.  Cooter said Canada has initiated a 
dialogue with its own Muslim community, most of whom are from 
South Asia and not the Middle East, in the hope that the GOC 
can leverage their support.  They do not want a simple series 
of meetings that don,t go anywhere, and are concerned that 
if the effort is misconstrued it could actually do more harm 
than good.  One of the key targets of this dialogue is city 
dwellers, particularly those in slums, with an eye to 
reducing the &hostile underclass.8 
 
16. (SBU) On the Canadian action list is the following: 
 
--    Try to initiate a horizontal rather than a top-down 
approach to partnerships in the cross-cultural dialogue, to 
avoid patronizing and counterproductive engagements. 
--    Emphasize respect for diversity, not just as an 
abstract cultural values but as a firm foreign policy goal. 
--    Look for targets of opportunity, e.g. Pakistan,s debt 
forgiveness in exchange for changing its curriculum. 
--    Take the time to openly learn from one,s hosts. 
Demonstrate that the cross-cultural dialogue is not one-way. 
--    Focus efforts on the right issues at the right place 
and the right time. 
--    Synergize efforts with Parliament, NGOs, etc.  Develop 
key links, e.g. urban to urban links with police to do 
community policing. 
 
Post Conflict Stabilization 
--------------------------- 
 
17. (SBU) The U.S. side led the discussion of new approaches 
to post conflict stabilization with a review by Stewart 
Patrick of the new S/CRS office in the State Department.  The 
Canadians said they have a similar concept but on a more 
modest scale.  They hope to develop a small unit of military 
officers who would have an expandable roster of individuals 
they can call up quickly in a crisis -- an inner circle from 
government and an outer circle from NGOs and the private 
sector.  They were impressed by the depth of planning that 
has already gone into our effort and were envious of the fact 
that full responsibility for post conflict operations is 
fully vested in the State Department.  MacRae offered that he 
believes we could both be applying more lessons from the 
Balkans as we conduct this sort of planning and 
restructuring. 
 
Author Margaret MacMillan - From 1919 to 2004 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
18. (U) Margaret MacMillan, author of the current bestseller 
&1919,8 joined the group for lunch to offer an historian,s 
perspective on the contemporary world.  MacMillan said the 
end of the Cold War leaves the West in a period somewhat 
reminiscent of 1919, in which an old order had been 
overturned but there was no clear candidate to replace it. 
Then as now there was a single hegemon (Britain after WWI, 
America now) who is reaching imperial overstretch, and then 
as now there are irrational nationalist passions that are not 
well understood (ethnic nationalism then, religious tribalism 
now). 
 
19. (U) MacMillan believes we are not seeing the fulfillment 
of Huntington,s clash of civilizations -- both the West and 
the Muslim world are more complex than he makes them out to 
be.  But we are, she believes, seeing a more important rise 
of sub-state actors and the world is slow to come to grips 
with their newly acquired power.  It is the rise of 
irrational sub-state actors and how they are dealt with by 
the developed world, that MacMillan believes is the key to 
the future.  She hopes for a construct that would avoid a 
repeat of the failure of 1919, when the wrong assumptions and 
the wrong model required a second world war to sort the world 
out.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN BROADCAST REGULATION ON THE ROPES? 
 
REF:  03 OTTAWA 2657 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.   A Quebec court ruled on October 28 that the GOC\'s 
measures to prevent Canadians from subscribing directly to 
U.S.-origin satellite television services are 
unconstitutional.  Industry lawyers are scrambling to 
interpret the repercussions of this ruling, which could be 
read as striking down any GOC measure to prevent Canadians 
from viewing foreign-origin television broadcasts.  If it 
stands, it would come into broad effect in one year and, 
based on initial analysis, would undermine Canada\'s 
obsolescent broadcast regulatory structure - which is 
already under attack, notably for its restrictions on \"third 
language\" channels (those in languages other than French or 
English). 
 
2.    Until the ruling takes broad effect, it remains 
illegal for non-Canadian satellite TV services (such as 
DirecTV) to market directly in Canada.  Canadians who want 
such services must either steal the signal using 
unauthorized decoding equipment (\"black market\"), or 
subscribe via a U.S. mailing address (\"gray market\").  It is 
not yet clear whether the ruling \"decriminalizes\" only the 
latter activity, or the former as well. 
 
3.   Canada has long-standing, complex regulatory 
arrangements to restrict non-Canadian \"cultural products,\" 
particularly in broadcasting, and to promote the 
availability of Canadian content.  In recent years, this 
included raiding and prosecuting businesses which provided 
hardware and services to connect Canadians to foreign 
satellite TV by \"black\" or \"gray\" methods.  In 2003, the 
government announced plans to increase the associated 
penalties (reftel). 
 
4.   The October 28 court ruling, known as \"R. c. Theriault\" 
(criminal charges against two accused, Theriault and 
d\'Argy), found the charges to be inconsistent with the 
Canadian constitution\'s guarantee of \"freedom of thought, 
belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the 
press and other media of communication.\"  (The ruling is 
available, though as yet only in French, at website 
\"jugements.qc.ca\" under \"Cour du Quebec\"). 
 
5. The Coalition Against Satellite Signal Theft (CASST), a 
Canadian broadcast industry group which has struggled to 
preserve the existing broadcast regulatory structure, says 
that a GOC appeal is both necessary and certain.  If the 
ruling stands, according to CASST, it would mean \"the end of 
the existing Canadian broadcasting system.\"  (Comment: 
While they may be right, CASST tend to identify the \"system\" 
with the current structure.  It may not adequately represent 
those whom that structure excludes or disadvantages.  End 
comment).

SUBJECT: U.S. GOALS FOR GLOBAL FUND BOARD MEETING IN 
ARUSHA, TANZANIA: CANADA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 232461 
 
1. (SBU)  SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST: Canadian aid officials 
take a more sanguine view than the US both of future funding 
prospects for the Global Fund and of performance of grants 
awarded so far, possbily because they rely for information on 
the Global Fund secretariat.  They would welcome more details 
of U.S. analysis of the problems we see in this area. Action 
request: please provide further details on U.S. views 
regarding specific grants and our overall analysis; we 
believe more detail might change Canadaian views on the 
issue.  On the Board review procedure, Canadian have promised 
us an answer next week. 
 
2. (U)  Post Delivered reftel demarche and paper to Dr. 
Ernest Loevinsohn, CIDA Director General for Program against 
Hunger, Malnutrition and Disease, (Canada, Germany, 
Swtizerland, UK rep) and followed up with Canadian Senior 
Coordinator Suzie Djakcasu. 
 
3.  (SBU) Responding to our arguments against proceeding with 
Round Five at this point, Djakcasu said that Canada is less 
concerned about the availability of funds than we are. 
CIDA\'s analysis is that actual donations have outpaced 
pledges to date and that, extrapolating from experience,  it 
is reasonable to expect that sufficient funds will be 
available for both Round 5 and renewal of existing grants. 
She commented that she understood why we might want to take a 
more conservative approach and want the funds actually in 
hand, but CIDA sees the planned replenishment mechanism, the 
first conference on which will take place next year, as 
evidence that we are moving toward a more predictable funding 
environment.  Djakcasu argued further that the Fund already 
makes commitments that are not fully funded, i.e. five-year 
grants for which only three are granted up front; in essence, 
the Fund is already effectively banking on the future.  She 
also observed that there is always substantial time between 
the calling of a new Round and the actual awarding of the 
grants in which Board members and the secretariat can get a 
clearer picture of the financing situation.  She promised to 
see if she could share CIDA\'s internal analytical papers with 
us. 
 
4. (SBU) Performance and accountability:  Djakcasu questioned 
our view that many grants are in trouble, and asked for more 
information on the precise proportion, or indeed which 
specific loans, we feel are in trouble and/or are 
inadequately reported and documented.  She noted that CIDA 
has relied for its evaluation of how grants are doing on  the 
performance review of the first 25 grants discussed at the 
Partnerships Forum.  CIDA\'s assessment from that meeting was 
that 8 were doing well, 12 were adequately documented, and 
that 5 were underperforming.  CIDA does not necessarily 
believe all is well, however.  The GoC has received scattered 
reports of trouble through its own missions,  and would 
welcome more detailed information on where we think the 
problems are.  ACTION REQUEST: Any further analysis that we 
can share with the Canadians would be helpful. 
 
5. (U)  With regard to the U.S. points on the proposed 
procedure for Board review of grants, CIDA will give us a 
response after a planned conference call early next week with 
the other constituency countries.

SUBJECT: GETTING TO KNOW YOU:  MEXICAN PRESIDENT FOX VISITS 
CANADA 
 
REF: OTTAWA 1687 
 
1.  (U) Introduction and Summary:  Mexican President Vincente 
Fox marked the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations and 
the 10th anniversary of NAFTA with a working visit to Canada 
October 24-26.  Accompanied by eight cabinet-level officials, 
three senators,  and about 40 business leaders, the 
President\'s schedule ranged from addressing a joint session 
of Parliament to hosting a ballet gala and speaking to 
university students. The most significant deliverable was 
agreement on a Canada-Mexico Partnership, explicitly modeled 
on the U.S.-Mexico Partnership for Prosperity. Both Mexican 
and Canadian officials confirm that discussions focussed on 
the bilateral relationship, with NAFTA issues to be raised in 
the upcoming NAFTA deputy\'s meeting. Canada still has not 
adopted Mexico\'s vision of a \"strategic alliance\" and active 
engagement in NAFTA plus, but the visit does mark 
re-invigoration of a neglected bilateral relationship.  End 
introduction and summary. 
 
A complete success 
------------------ 
 
2. (SBU)  Officials at Foreign Affairs Canada report that 
this was the most complex working visit they have ever hosted 
(due to the size and diversity of the delegation and the 
variety of events) and that \"it couldn\'t have gone better.\" 
The Prime Minister\'s personal commitment made possible 
signing of the Partnership agreement and facilitated the 
unusually broad involvement by cabinet members.  PM Martin\'s 
focus on the visit is especially noteworthy as the Provincial 
Premiers were in Ottawa at the same time for negotiations on 
federal-provincial finances.  The PM went so far as to summon 
the Director of the Mexico desk to add some Spanish to his 
toast for the official dinner, so as not to be outdone by 
Parliamentary leaders who had addressed President Fox in 
Spanish during his visit to the Hill. 
 
3.  (SBU) The Mexican embassy characterized the visit, 
positioned as an opportunity for political dialogue, 
promoting business, and liaising with the (approximately 
36,000 members of) the Mexican community in Canada, as a 
complete success.  Official functions included the Martin-Fox 
bilateral followed by an expanded meeting with cabinet 
ministers, a warmly-welcomed address to Parliament and 
ministerial bilaterals.  But the official side was leavened 
with glamor and outreach.  The Foxes started the visit Sunday 
night by hosting the Prime Minister and his wife, as well as 
other officials, at a glittering gala around the performance 
of the Ballet Folklorico de Mexico.  The Prime Minister 
reciprocated the following night with a dinner for 900 
guests.  The visit also included outreach to the Mexican 
Community (in which a surprising 500 members of Ottawa\'s 
limited Mexican population participated), a speech at 
Carleton University and a solid schedule for the business 
community.  A private sector retreat in Montreal for business 
leaders on both sides was capped Monday with a lunch with 
President Fox in Ottawa hosted by the Mexcian Ambassador. 
 
4.  (U) Fox also met with Opposition leaders of Parliament 
and with Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who will shortly be 
accompanying the French President to Mexico.  This is Fox\'s 
third visit to Canada, and had been postponed from July due 
to the difficulty in scheduling so soon after the election. 
Although the July visit would have included stops in several 
cities (but not Ottawa), this visit covered the national 
capital area only. 
 
Canada-Mexico Partnership leads a long list of little 
deliverables 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) The headline deliverable was agreement on a 
Canada-Mexico Partnership modeled on the US-Mexico 
Partnership for Progress. A working group is being 
established to identify areas for further cooperation through 
a private-public partnership.  Although the agreement does 
not include specific commitments, we are told that the PM 
does not sign such bilateral agreements lightly and this 
signifies a renewed commitment to the neglected bilateral 
relationship. Canadian business groups strongly supported the 
intiative.  GoC and business sources commented to us, 
however, that Canada will resist duplicating the high-profile 
(and expensive) P4P format favored by the Mexican side and 
hopes to develop a format, e.g. with working groups, that 
will provide some continuity and produce pragmatic results. 
One contact commented that the Canadian side had also pushed 
for a broadly economic theme but that the Mexicans had 
insisted on an emphasis on development. 
 
6.  (U) In addition to this headline agreement, the visit 
resulted in new money from Export Development Canada and 
signature of letters of intent on climate change initiatives 
and renewal of an LOU on health sector collaboration.  There 
were deliverables in 13 other areas, including medical 
research, housing and sustainable cities, migration, 
professional and academic exchanges, and tourism promotion. 
 
Open Exchange With University Students 
-------------------------------------- 
7.  (U) President Fox addressed university students on 
\"Mexico\'s Vision of North America:  Working Together for a 
Common Future\" but spoke instead on democracy and good 
governance in Mexico.  The speech drew a strong press 
contingent, as well as representatives from the diplomatic 
and academic community.  Canadian and Mexican contacts were 
impressed by the warmth of the President\'s connection with 
the Mexican community, including the students.  (Organizers 
anticipated that if there were demonstrations or problems 
they would occur at the university.)  The Mexican students 
clearly appreciated his responses to their pointed but 
on-topic questions. The speech (given in English) did not 
break new ground, but in response to questions President Fox 
noted that: 
 
--The GOM is working to provide health coverage for those 
outside the formal economy.  They are starting with the 
poorest and hope to have 7 million people covered by the end 
of this year, and about 25 million covered within three 
years.  That will require expanding medical infrastructure. 
 
--  In response to a question on NAFTA institutions, such as 
a North American court of justice, he said the three 
governments are discussing the new vision for NAFTA.  A court 
is not yet on the radar, but things will move in that 
direction. 
 
--  On whether NAFTA is heading towards an EU-type 
arrangement or something more laissez-faire, he said \"Europe 
is not yet the trilateral inspiration.\"  Perhaps that will be 
the case in 40-50 years, but for now we are working on 
NAFTA-plus.  All three NAFTA economies are losing jobs to 
China, and need to react by increasing competitiveness and 
productivity by uniting their resources. 
 
--  Given US domination and the fact that there are, in fact, 
two bilateral relationships, what are the realistic 
possibilities for a North American Union?  Fox responded that 
often the most powerful have the biggest weaknesses and 
painted an extremely gloomy picture of the fate of aging 
populations in the US and Canada that will need to rely on 
Mexico\'s abundant, talented, hardworking human resources. 
 
--  Asked about what his government will do to halt 
brain-drain, he admitted that right now Mexico has a 
population boom and there is a lack of space:  inadequate 
educational opportunities, jobs or housing. 
 
Trade Minister\'s Bilaterals:  Introductory Calls, Not NAFTA 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Trade contacts on both the Mexican and Canadian 
sides said the 45-minute bilateral between the two trade 
ministers on Monday morning would include discussion of 
ongoing NAFTA work-in-progress, such as rules of origin on 
textiles, and a review of progress thus far.  Canada\'s trade 
minister Peterson was not briefed to raise \"beyond NAFTA\" 
issues, and both sides noted that such discussions would be 
inappropriate in the bilateral context, but would be 
discussed at the upcoming NAFTA deputies meeting.  Secretary 
of Economy Canales\' bilateral with Industry Minister Emerson 
on Tuesday was even briefer, scheduled as a 30-minute 
introductory call. 
 
A \"Strategic Alliance\"?  But without a Strategy 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  At a pre-visit conference on \"Mexico & Canada at the turn 
of the 21st Century:  Sixty Years of Diplomatic Relations,\" 
Mexico\'s Ambassador to Canada opened the discussion with 
remarks stressing the desire of both \"strategic allies\" for 
deeper cooperation.  She noted that since the early 1990s, 
both Canada and Mexico have been seeking to diversify their 
foreign relations and gain greater autonomy from the U.S. 
She claimed that the greatest benefit in sharing such a long 
border with the U.S. is the fact that it facilitates 
rapprochement with Canada.  There is, she said, a perception 
that the US designs policy for itself, but world events have 
reinforced the Mexico-Canada strategic alliance.  The two 
countries are looking for ways to reduce or eliminate the 
power asymmetry, so should coordinate priorities, not just 
react to policies imposed by the U.S. 
 
10. (U) During the subsequent panel discussion, which the 
Mexican Ambassador was not able to attend, academic panalists 
characterized the bilateral relationship as \"evolving but 
embryonic,\" providing statistics to demonstrate the room for 
growth.  (Canada has 4% of the total stock of FDI in Mexico, 
but that is 40 times more than all Mexican FDI in Canada. 
Mexican FDI in Canada accounts for 0.8% of the total stock.) 
The final panelist of the morning quipped that while Canada 
and Mexico may have a \"strategic alliance,\" it lacks a 
strategy.  He characterized the situation as two North 
Americas, rather than one integrated market.  He called for 
strengthening relations at the elite level (which this visit 
will do) and noted that while \"managing the US is no cup of 
tea,\" the two countries have much to celebrate as 
demonstrated by the higher density of bilateral linkages over 
the years. 
 
11.  (U) Canada\'s Assistant Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Marc Lortie summed up the conference with a realistic 
but hopeful assessment of Canada-Mexico relations.  He said 
that during the upcoming visit the two countries would launch 
a new mechanism to deepen economic relations.  He used the 
term \"strategic partnership\", with the two countries trying 
to establish strong links on trade, border issues, and 
security.  Lortie said it is still an open question how much 
of this strategic partnership can be put in an institutional 
framework and how much will continue to be carried out on an 
ad hoc basis.  Is there a place for EU style engagement, for 
example?  (He asked a number of open questions during his 
remarks). 
 
12.  (U) Lortie said that after three years of trying to 
manage the Americas, Fox realizes that he must be more 
pragmatic and more precise.  He now knows the limits of 
trilateral mechanisms.  Lortie said that Canada and Mexico 
have each been overwhelmed since 9/11 in managing the 
\"relationship of all relationships,\" and have not dedicated 
time in a strategic sense to their bilateral relations.  They 
both know that the economy will take a backseat to security. 
On September 20th, 2001 FM Castaneda suggested to then-deputy 
Prime Minister John Manley that they focus on trilateral 
cooperation on the border, but Canada was also cool to the 
idea of forming a strategic partnership with Mexico to 
\"manage\" the United States.

1. (C) Summary - Canada would welcome a January visit by 
President Bush to set a tone of partnership for the next four 
years, according to Alex Himelfarb and Tim Murphy, the Prime 
Minister,s top aides.  They would like to use the visit to 
emphasize Canada,s commitment to North American security in 
general, to address if possible beef and any of the other 
trade irritants, to underscore our cooperation on a range of 
international issues, such as Haiti and Afghanistan, and then 
finally to launch a &Beyond Smart Borders8 initiative.  End 
Summary 
 
2. (C) On November 8, 2004, Ambassador Cellucci hosted Alex 
Himelfarb, Clerk of the Privy Council and Tim Murphy, Chief 
of Staff, Prime Minister,s Office representing both the 
civil service and political arms of Canada,s executive 
branch.  The two had requested the meeting to discuss initial 
thinking on the invitation to President Bush to visit and, 
connected to that, their plans on the current hot topic of 
Canada,s participation in missile defense. 
 
3. (C) Missile defense ) The government has &gotten itself 
into8 accepting that there will be a vote in parliament on 
whether and/or how Canada will participate in missile defense 
beyond the decision last August to place the early warning 
component under NORAD.  Himelfarb explained that the minority 
government is not sure it has the numbers to win such a vote, 
explaining that the Conservative support is not guaranteed as 
they are concerned about their share of the urban vote in a 
future election.  With his own party split, Himelfarb 
explained they would prefer to hold no timetable for a 
Canadian decision.  With an invitation to the President to 
visit, they would commit publicly to the broad agenda of 
North American security and give private assurances on 
missile defense, but that vote pending the political reality. 
 
4. (C) Presidential visit ) A January timing for the visit 
would better suit the Canadians, to allow more time to 
prepare and to hold the visit while Parliament is not in 
session, thereby precluding a speech before Parliament which 
has its &uncontrollables8.  Himelfarb laid out components 
to the visit: 
 
a. Tone ) Setting a tone of partnership for the coming four 
years. 
b. North American security ) Committing to the broad range 
of security in North America, including NORAD renewal, border 
security enhancement, law enforcement cooperation and with a 
possible Great Lakes security component. 
c. NAI by any other name ) Launching a next phase of 
integration facilitating trade and enhancing security. 
Calling it &Beyond Smart Borders8, we can address the 
package of issues discussed under NAI, but without the name. 
Under this would be -- again with deference to language 
sensitivities ) those items which would &eliminate the 
differences which don,t matter8. 
d.  Trade irritants ) Demonstrating movement towards 
resolution of at the very least the beef issue, and if 
possible any of the other issues of dispute between the two 
countries. 
e.  International, third-country issues - Discussing a broad 
range of global and international issues where Canada and the 
U.S. have worked or can work in lock-step: Middle Ease Peace 
Process, Haiti, Sudan, Afghanistan, Iran, proliferation, etc. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador indicated he would seek to get more 
concrete ideas on the timing of a visit this week and that 
the Embassy would begin to work on substance of the meetings 
both with our Washington colleagues and GOC counterparts. 
 
6. (C) Comment ) A year after the Prime Minister announced 
his intention to work more closely and cooperatively with the 
U.S., this visit represents an opportunity, delayed by 
elections here and in the U.S., to put in place practical and 
concrete demonstration of such a relationship.  For some time 
now, the Canadians have been at pains to stress how much on a 
broad range of issues they cooperate with us, despite their 
decision not to have forces on the ground in Iraq.  In 
addition to all the points above, a Presidential visit would 
underline for the Canadians just how important getting it 
right in Iraq is for the international community, for many 
years to come.  We would welcome their expanding their 
support so far ) ships in the gulf, exchange officers on the 
ground, $300 million of reconstruction funding, training of 
Iraqi law enforcement.  End Comment.

SUMMARY/ INTRODUCTION 
--------------------- 
 
1. On October 29, the Information and Privacy Commissioner 
for the Canadian Province of British Columbia released a 
report titled \"Privacy and the US Patriot Act.\"  The report 
(reftel) finds a \"general consensus\" that, under the Patriot 
Act, U.S. authorities could order a U.S.-based corporation 
to produce records held in Canada.  The example in question 
is personal health data on Canadian citizens which the 
corporation might hold as part of a data services 
arrangement with a Canadian province\'s health ministry.  On 
November 4, in an annual report, the Privacy Commissioner of 
Canada proposed (among other things) an audit of the cross- 
border flow of Canadians\' personal information and the 
impact this may have on their rights to privacy. 
 
2.   These reports have intensified discussion in Canada of 
privacy issues, particularly those raised by the interplay 
of the world\'s largest cross-border commercial relationship 
with U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorist activity.  As 
background to inevitable USG participation, this message 
outlines the Canadian context of such issues.  END 
SUMMARY/INTRODUCTION 
 
CANADIAN LEGAL CONTEXT 
---------------------- 
 
3.There are two key Canadian laws governing privacy: 
 
-- The 1983 Privacy Act required some limits on the GOC\'s 
collection, use and disclosure of personal information, and 
gave Canadians the right to access and correct it. 
 
-- The 2001 Personal Information Protection and Electronic 
Documents Act (PIPEDA), which extended privacy protections 
beyond the federal government to personal information 
collected in any commercial activity. 
 
4.Key guidelines of PIPEDA are that (a) the individual\'s 
knowledge and consent are required; (b) purposes must be 
identified at or before the time of collection, and the 
information cannot be used or disclosed for other purposes; 
and (c) individuals generally must be given access to the 
information about themselves, and be able to challenge it. 
 
5.The key difference between the Canadian and U.S. legal 
approaches to privacy is that independent offices, called 
Privacy Commissioners, exist to enforce these laws at both 
the federal and provincial levels in Canada.  While these 
officials\' direct power is constrained by their very limited 
staff resources, they comment regularly on privacy issues 
(including on government policy and legislation) through 
publications, media, and Parliamentary channels, and their 
views are widely reported.  The federal Privacy 
Commissioner\'s website is privcom.gc.ca. 
 
 
HISTORY OF ISSUES 
----------------- 
 
6.EU DIRECTIVE:  Beginning in 1995, the European Union\'s 
Policy Directive on Personal Data accented differences 
between EU and US practices, and threatened to bar the 
commercial transmission of personal data across the 
Atlantic.  Canada\'s privacy regime, with its (albeit modest) 
enforcement capacity, was significantly closer to the EU 
model than the United States\'.  While the EU and the United 
States spent several years negotiating USDOC\'s \"safe harbor\" 
compromise, the GOC responded by developing the legislation 
which eventually resulted in PIPEDA. 
 
7.CUSTOMER DATA:  Throughout Canadian society in the late 
1990\'s, as in the United States, there was heightened 
concern about telephone and Internet privacy: 
telemarketing, customer \"loyalty\" or \"reward\" programs, the 
sale of mailing lists and other customer data, and the 
collection and distribution of personal information through 
the Internet.  These mainly focussed on practices in the 
private sector, rather than in government.  Privacy 
Commissioners commented extensively on these issues, which 
PIPEDA was also intended to address. 
 
8. OPENING MAIL:  In 2001, the federal Privacy Commissioner 
successfully rolled back Canadian customs officials\' right 
to open international mail.  Until then, customs inspectors 
could not open letters under 30 grams without consent or a 
warrant, but they could legally open any correspondence 
contained in a larger package, such as a courier envelope. 
The GOC admitted that this was done regularly to assist in 
the enforcement of immigration law.  Immigration lawyers 
appealed to the Privacy Commissioner, who persuaded the GOC 
to exclude the weight of courier envelopes from the 30-gram 
rule. 
 
9/11 REACTION 
------------- 
 
9.   In the rush to enact anti-terrorist measures in both 
Canada and the United States in the wake of September 11, 
2001, advocates viewed privacy rights as being threatened by 
over-hasty government action.  In addition, Canada\'s federal 
Privacy Commissioner repeatedly cautioned the GOC against 
relying too heavily on pressure from the USG as a 
justification for its measures.  In his view, national 
security could well provide reasonable grounds for 
diminishing Canadians\' privacy rights, but the GOC had to do 
so in a Canadian legal context.  In his words, \"The 
Americans made us do it\" could not be a sufficient excuse. 
 
PUBLIC SAFETY ACT 
----------------- 
 
10. The GOC unveiled an extensive Public Safety Act which 
worked its way through Parliament during 2003, to close 
scrutiny from the media and the Privacy Commissioners.  Much 
of the Act dealt with transportation security questions, 
such as the provision of airline passenger data to the 
federal police and intelligence services (RCMP and CSIS).  A 
key issue in this context was the extent to which this data 
might be used not just for counter-terrorist purposes, but 
for broader law enforcement and surveillance.  Again, the 
Privacy Commissioner stressed that if this were to occur, it 
should be done transparently and not hidden behind a \"mask\" 
of counter-terrorism.  The Act also touched on other privacy 
issues, such as federal authorities\' access to financial 
records of non-governmental organizations. 
 
STATUS AND NEXT STEPS 
--------------------- 
 
11.   At the beginning of 2004, PIPEDA became applicable 
across the private sector, i.e. to all personal data 
gathered in the course of commercial activity.  Enforcement 
of PIPEDA (and its provincial equivalents) is complaints- 
driven and is expected to be constrained by the size of 
Privacy Commissioners\' staffs.  The Public Safety Act became 
law on May 6, 2004.  The appropriate use of airline 
passenger data continues to be discussed both within Canada 
and between U.S. and Canadian authorities. 
 
12.  GOC privacy concerns and constitutional constraints 
present significant barriers to information sharing with the 
U.S. law enforcement community.  In 2002, as part of our 
efforts to facilitate the Border Action Plan, Embassy 
recommended a joint USG-GOC review of privacy regimes in 
order to provide for effective law enforcement, national 
security, the rule of law, and protection of constitutional 
liberties. 
 
13.  While the Public Safety Act was before Parliament in 
2002-2004, Embassy made efforts to raise the level and 
frequency of our contacts with the federal Office of the 
Privacy Commissioner (OPC).  These efforts - and the work of 
the Office - were disrupted by an administrative and 
financial scandal at OPC in 2003, and we intend to renew 
them in coming months.

APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS. 
 
2. (U)  THE EXERCISE SCENARIO WAS BASED UPON A MUSTARD GAS 
ATTACK WITHIN THE OTTAWA CITY HALL BY AN UNSPECIFIED 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  THE FOCUS OF THE EXERCISE WAS THE 
RECOVERY OF CASUALTIES FROM CITY HALL AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT 
DECONTAMINATION, TRIAGE, MEDICAL TREATMENT, AND EVACUATION 
FROM THE EXERCISE SITE (THE LARGE LAWN AREA ADJACENT TO CITY 
HALL).  THE OTTAWA CITY POLICE WERE IN COMMAND OF THE 
EXERCISE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR PERIMETER SECURITY.  ALL 
EXERCISE PARTICIPANTS, EXCLUDING SIMULATED CASUALTIES, WERE 
IN FULL PROTECTIVE POSTURE CLOTHING (GAS MASKS, OVERGARMENTS, 
GLOVES, AND BOOTS). 
 
3. (U)  THE REGIMENT DE HULL, AN ARMORED RECONNAISSANCE UNIT, 
WAS TASKED TO CONDUCT NBCD RECONNAISSANCE AND SITE 
DECONTAMINATION OF THE EXERCISE AREA.  THE RECON TEAM OF THE 
REGIMENT WAS EQUIPPED WITH A CHEMICAL AGENT MONITOR (NATO 
STOCK NUMBER:  6665-99-420-3628).  NBCD RECONNAISSANCE DATA 
WAS TRANSMITTED VIA RADIO TO THE GEOMATICS DETACHMENT OF THE 
THIRD FIELD ENGINEERS, WHICH PRODUCED REAL-TIME EXERCISE SITE 
MAPS FOR USE BY ALL ELEMENTS.  THE GOVERNOR GENERAL\'S FOOT 
GUARDS, AN INFANTRY REGIMENT NORMALLY ASSIGNED CEREMONIAL AND 
GUARD DUTIES, WAS TASKED TO ERECT AND OPERATE A PERSONNEL 
DECONTAMINATION STATION TO AUGMENT THE ONE OPERATED BY 
CIVILIAN PARAMEDICS.  THE FOOT GUARDS ACCOMPLISHED THIS 
WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES AND THEIR DECONTAMINATION STATION WAS 
SUPERIOR TO THE CIVILIAN STATION THROUGH CREATIVE USE OF 
MILITARY TENTAGE, FIELD SHOWER PLUMBING, AND SPACE HEATERS. 
 
4. (U)  NOTABLES WHO ATTENDED THE TRAINING EXERCISE INCLUDED 
MR. GEORGES ((BEDARD)), DEPUTY MAYOR OF OTTAWA; MAJOR GENERAL 
MARC ((CARON)), ASSISTANT CHIEF OF THE LAND STAFF; AND MAJOR 
GENERAL ED ((FITCH)), PROGRAM MANAGER FOR LAND FORCES RESERVE 
RESTRUCTURE.  CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR ABSENCE WERE ANY 
REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
CANADA (PSEPC).  SEVERAL MEDIA PHOTOGRAPHERS RECORDED THE 
EVENT, BUT NO COVERAGE APPEARED IN THE OTTAWA CITIZEN 
NEWSPAPER ON EITHER 20041107 OR 20041108. 
 
 
COMMENTS:  1.  (C/NF)  FIELD COMMENTS.  THE MILITARY ELEMENTS 
THAT PARTICIPATED IN THIS EXERCISE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE 
CAPABILITY OF CANADIAN ARMY RESERVE UNITS TO AUGMENT CIVILIAN 
FIRST-RESPONDERS IN THE EVENT OF A NBCD EMERGENCY.  IN FACT, 
AS CIVILIAN FIRST-RESPONDER ASSETS WERE QUICKLY OVERWHELMED 
BY A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CASUALTIES, AUGMENTATION BY 
ARMY RESERVE UNITS, IF PROPERLY EQUIPPED AND TRAINED, COULD 
PROVE TO BE ESSENTIAL DURING AN ACTUAL EMERGENCY.  ALTHOUGH 
THIS TEST WAS OBVIOUSLY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE ARMY, THE ISSUE IS 
NOW WHETHER SUCH TASKS BECOME PART OF RESERVE UNIT MISSION 
STATEMENTS.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE NOT ONLY A POLICY DECISION AT 
THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE LEVEL, BUT ALSO THE ALLOCATION OF 
RESOURCES TO EQUIP AND TRAIN RESERVE UNITS.

SUBJECT: CANADA: CONSERVATIVES DIVIDED ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
FOR CANADA; GOVERNMENT LIKELY TO AVOID DECISION IN NEAR 
FUTURE 
 
REF: OTTAWA 2990 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: POL MC Brian Flora.  Reason 1.4 (b), (d), (e). 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY:  Despite broad speculation in media and 
academic circles that the government was poised to take a 
(positive) decision on Canada\'s participation in missile 
defense, PCO Clerk Alex Himelfarb indicated to the Ambassador 
that the government would seek to avoid a debate and vote on 
MD anytime soon (reftel/NOTAL).  Coincidentally, in a 
separate meeting the same day (November 8), Conservative 
Defense Critic Gordon O\'Connor voiced his party\'s 
(unexpected) reservations on MD to poloffs and DATT; he 
shared privately his assessment that missile defense is so 
politically divisive that the minority government will not 
risk bringing it to a vote.  Discussions with House Foreign 
Affairs Committee Chair Bernard Patry, and FAC Assistant 
Deputy Minister (ADM) Jim Wright\'s comments on his MD 
briefing to the Liberal Caucus bear out the judgment that 
Parliamentary ignorance and misinformation about missile 
defense are key factors in Canadian reluctance to make a 
decision about the program.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OFFICIAL OPPOSITION (CONSERVATIVE) NOT CONVINCED MD IS FOR 
CANADA 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
2. (C/NF) At Ambassador\'s request, Poloffs and DATT met with 
Conservative M.P. Gordon O\'Connor, Opposition defense critic, 
ostensibly to help fill the Opposition\'s knowledge gap on 
missile defense.  Elected to the Commons for the first time, 
O\'Connor is a retired Army Brigadier General who also worked 
as a consultant for the PR firm Hill & Knowlton.  O\'Connor 
spoke candidly, noting at the outset that he was less 
concerned with technical details (obtainable from web sites, 
he said), than with what role the Liberal government is 
considering for Canada in the missile defense framework.  The 
Opposition wanted to know \"what\" the government would be 
signing up for, and \"what\" will be debated when the issue 
comes to the Commons floor. In light of the five years the 
government had worked the issue, O\'Connor said, there must be 
\"some kind of arrangement\" that the U.S. and Canada had 
discussed.  He added that while he fully appreciates the 
American view that the threat is increasing over time and the 
U.S. needs to be prepared, at present he doesn\'t see a clear 
benefit to Canada.  O\'Connor reflected that Canada might be 
better off sitting it out for now and, if the threat became 
compelling, perhaps \"re-engaging\" with the U.S. five or ten 
years hence. 
 
3. (C/NF) Polmiloff responded that there is no \"Agreement\" 
per se at this time.  Rather, the Embassy\'s understanding 
drawn from the public debate was that in putting missile 
defense to a vote, the government would seek Parliament\'s 
blessing to commit to and negotiate Canadian terms of 
participation in the program.  O\'Connor said that the 
government possesses full authority to negotiate and sign 
treaties; therefore, in his view, it does not need 
\"permission\" to negotiate MD participation.  Rather, he 
agreed with what Defense Minister Graham had said on public 
radio -- that the government should negotiate a package with 
the U.S. and present the terms to Parliament for 
ratification.  On delayed Canadian participation, DATT 
acknowledged that while it was clearly Canada\'s prerogative, 
Canadians should be made aware of the opportunity cost of 
waiting, as the program continues to evolve independently of 
and without consideration for issues of potential 
interest/concern to Canada. 
 
4. (C/NF) O\'Connor added that he believes there is no/no 
incentive for the government to bring the issue to a vote at 
this time.  In his estimation, the anti-federalist Bloc 
Quebecois (54 votes) and left-of-center NDP (19 votes) would 
\"absolutely oppose\" any missile defense proposal, and a 
considerable number of Liberal MPs clearly would like to 
follow suit.  He believes that the Liberals, knowing that a 
missile defense vote will expose the rifts in the Party, will 
simply push it further down the road, perhaps even to the 
next election.  Politically, O\'Connor said, the issue also 
was tricky for the Opposition.  In essence the Conservatives 
would like to continue opposing the government without 
betraying their basic advocacy for strong defense.  They see 
four options if and when the issue comes to the floor: 
Support, Oppose, Abstain, Allow the caucus to vote its 
conscience (a free vote). 
 
5. (C/NF) O\'Connor concluded that he did not want to leave 
the impression that he and the Conservatives do not 
understand the nature of the post-9/11 threat and the need 
for a strong, united defense.  They take the issue very 
seriously, he said, and are committed to improving Canada\'s 
defenses. But they cannot just fall into line without knowing 
precisely what the government is proposing and how MD fits in 
the overall defense picture. 
 
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE CHAIR UNSURE WHAT MISSILE 
DEFENSE IS ABOUT 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
6. (C/NF) In a meeting on November 4, House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Chairman Bernard Patry told poloff and visiting 
WHA/CAN desk officer that he \"expected\" the missile defense 
debate to take place in December, with Parliament adjourning 
on December 12th.  Patry said the vote would be non-binding 
and that the government would brief Parliamentarians in the 
lead-up to the vote. He added that the likelihood was high 
that it would be a \"free\" vote for the Liberal Caucus and 
that, regardless of the outcome, the government would proceed 
with the program. 
 
7. (C/NF) Patry said the key concern for him was the 
potential for \"weaponization of space.\" (NOTE: Rather 
tellingly, on at least one occasion Patry called the missile 
defense program the \"space weapons program\").  He did not 
know what the involvement of Canada would be, the cost, nor 
the impact of Canadian participation on NORAD.  Patry said 
that Canada accepts that the U.S. has a clear vision and 
rationale for the missile defense program and will proceed 
with it regardless of others\' participation:  But that 
doesn\'t answer the question of whether MD is a \"good idea\" 
for Canada. 
 
FAC BRIEFING TO THE LIBERAL CAUCUS FURTHER REVEALS KNOWLEDGE 
GAP 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
8. (C/NF) Assistant Deputy Minister for Global and Security 
Policy Jim Wright provided a readout to DCM of his November 
30 briefing on missile defense to about 50 Liberal MPs. 
Wright, whose expertise and grasp of the issue are well known 
to USG interlocutors at post and in Washington, shared the 
key points he made: 
 
-- Regarding sovereignty: This is a Canadian decision and 
always has been; there is no pressure from the U.S. to sign 
onto missile defense. He argued that \"it is an exercise of 
sovereignty to decide to participate\" and it was difficult to 
imagine Canada not participating on an issue related to North 
American security. 
 
-- Regarding cost: Level of participation is a matter of 
choice.  Wright said he went into some detail about different 
levels opted by other countries in response to one MP\'s 
rejoinder that Japan had contributed $25 billion \"but they 
got something for that\". 
 
-- Regarding national security interests: Canada\'s decision 
should be part of a bigger strategy of prevention (consistent 
with involvement in PSI and Global Partnership) as well as 
protection (missile defense).  Moreover, MD should be seen as 
part of a comprehensive security package that includes smart 
borders, NORAD renewal, and BPG renewal. 
 
9. (C/NF) Wright told DCM that a minority of MPs want it 
\"both ways\": protection without paying, and command and 
control input but no assets on Canada territory.  He said he 
was careful not to raise expectations on industrial 
opportunities and notions of influence over the U.S.  Wright 
assesses the way ahead to be blurry. The FAC bureaucracy 
needs a political green light that will only happen once the 
politicians are comfortable that this is really \"their\" 
sovereign decision.  Wright said he took some criticism that 
this briefing was long in coming.  He confided that FAC has 
done \"preliminary thinking\" of what a framework might look 
like based on the US-UK agreement. Finally, while there was 
no green light on briefing other parties yet, Wright thought 
a decision to go ahead and offer briefings to the opposition 
caucuses might be made next week. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (C/NF)  From our collective discussions with Canadian 
interlocutors it is clear that misinformation and plain 
ignorance about missile defense are factors in the 
government\'s inability to move the issue forward.  While 
parliamentary briefings by credible professionals such as Jim 
Wright can help to de-mystify MD, at this point the issue is 
so starkly politicized that only time--and perhaps a stronger 
government--may enable common sense to prevail.

1.  We conveyed the points in reftel to officials at Foreign 
Affairs Canada (FAC), the Canadian International Development 
Agency, Export Development Canada (the ECA) and the 
Department of Finance.  Although there is no opposition in 
principle to signing a framework agreement with the Trade 
Bank of Iraq, there is, thus far, no demand from Canadian 
businesses and there is unlikely to be any until the security 
situation is more inviting.  We were told that EDC also has 
concerns about the long-term reliability of the oil revenue 
flows that would back up TBI guarantees. The GOC is open to 
approaches from TBI \"once peace breaks out\" and believes a 
Canadian bank may have already signed some sort of protocol 
with Iraq. 
 
2.  A publication by International Trade Canada had a 
front-page article in October encouraging Canadian firms to

next April, noting that it will \"offer international 
suppliers a safe meeting place to present their products and 
technologies to Iraqi entrepreneurs, regional and 
international contractors and subcontrators, traders and 
importers, and Iraqi officials responsible for the Iraq 
Development Fund.\" The FAC contact person reports there has 
been no interest from Canadian firms, but he is optimistic 
that business will improve as the security situation settles. 
 He will be attending the November conference in Amman as a 
delegate and will look for counterparts from Embassy Amman.

SUBJECT: CANADA FORGES AHEAD ON CLEAN COAL 
 
REF: OTTAWA 2263 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  (U) Summary:  The Canadian Clean Power Coalition, an 
association of coal and energy producers, is developing a 
\"roadmap\" for building a clean coal power plant in Canada by 
2012.  The group comprises public and private entities which 
are responsible for over 90 percent of Canada\'s coal-fired 
electricity generation capacity, and is supported by the 
Canadian federal government and several provincial 
governments.  The goal of the Canadian project will be to 
construct a demonstration coal-fired power plant whose 
emissions are comparable to a similar sized unit using 
natural gas feedstock.  The project will also examine 
retrofit technologies for existing coal plants, and will seek 
to lower costs for both new plants and for retrofits.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) Coal currently accounts for about 19 percent of 
Canada\'s total electricity generation (reftel).  As plants 
age, their replacement or retrofitting with clean coal 
technology would be fully consistent with Canada\'s 
commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, which it signed in 
2002.  Figures vary considerably regarding Canada\'s coal 
reserves, but at current production of about 70 million short 
tons per year, Canada\'s proven reserves of 6,200 million tons 
would last at least 85 years.  Canada\'s ultimately 
recoverable coal reserves may be as high as 43,000 million 
tons of all types of coal. 
 
3.  (U) The recently completed Phase I of the Canadian Clean 
Power Coalition (CCPC)\'s activities was a technical and 
economic comparison of different potential clean coal 
technologies, and the potential of each with various types of 
coal found in Canada.  Among the CCPC members are TransAlta, 
Luscar Ltd., Ontario Power Generation, SaskPower, Nova Scotia 
Power, and the California-based Electric Power Research 
Institute.  The federal government and the provincial 
governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia also 
actively support the CCPC. 
 
4.  (U) The Phase I study concluded that Integrated 
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), although not a fully 
developed technology for power plant applications, presented 
the best option for a clean coal power plant in Canada.  The 
CCPC also examined other possible clean coal technologies 
such as oxyfuel (combustion with oxygen and CO2) and amine 
scrubbing, but noted that IGCC potentially can deliver lower 
cost electricity and more efficient sequestration of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) than the other options.  The study also noted 
that IGCC is the best technology for producing hydrogen from 
coal, and can thus support Canada\'s burgeoning hydrogen 
technology industry. 
 
5.  (SBU) According to officials at the Canadian government\'s 
CANMET Energy Technology Centre, GOC spending on clean coal 
is about C$25 million annually (one Canadian dollar equals 
approximately .84 U.S.).  Support for the CCPC accounts for a 
major portion of the GOC\'s clean coal budget, with the GOC 
providing overall policy coordination and the use of its 
research facilities.  CANMET officials told ESTOFF that 
Canadian government and private sector researchers are 
closely following the progress of the U.S. zero-emission 
FutureGen project, but have no plans to formally participate. 
 
6.  (SBU) The CCPC\'s Phase II will consist of identifying 
sites for a demonstration project, as well as recommending 
which types of coal offer the best potential for power 
production and CO2 storage.  The study is currently 
considering sites in Saskatchewan (using lignite coal) and 
Alberta (where sub-bituminous coal is abundant).  The CCPC is 
also examining retrofit technology for better capture of 
sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides at existing plants.  GOC 
officials commented that Alberta is probably the best 
candidate for construction of Canada\'s first clean coal 
facility, due to energy requirements in the oil sands, 
abundance of coal, and opportunities for sequestration of CO2 
in depleted oil wells. 
 
7.  (SBU) According to GOC officials, a key part of the 
CCPC\'s Phase II study will also be to make a business case 
for an IGCC power plant.  While CO2 capture can raise the 
cost of electricity by as much as 50 percent over current 
rates, officials believe that this cost will be reduced 
through technology development, and further offset by 
producing hydrogen and other chemical by-products.  GOC 
officials see the issue of reducing cost as the key to clean 
coal\'s success, especially for retrofitting of existing 
plants.  The older plants may require extensive 
re-engineering to capture CO2, and retrofitting is especially 
problematic if there is no adequate site nearby for 
sequestration. 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment: GOC officials readily acknowledge that 
Canada has thus far made halting advances on clean coal 
technology, but believe they are now catching up with the 
United States and other countries which are pursuing the 
technology.  While interested in the progress of FutureGen, 
they believe that Canada has a sufficient industrial and 
scientific infrastructure, as well as vast deposits of 
specific types of coal, to justify its own continuing work on 
clean coal technology.  Progress on changing the political 
environment for clean coal may be more difficult, however. 
Ontario\'s energy minister, showing no signs of backing down 
on his pledge to close all coal plants in Canada\'s most 
populous province, recently declared that the term \"clean 
coal\" is an \"oxymoron.\"  In Canada, as in other places, 
coal\'s image as a dirty fuel may linger in the public mind 
until clean coal becomes a proven technology.  End comment.

SUBJECT: 214TH MEETING OF THE PERMANENT JOINT BOARD ON 
DEFENSE, OCTOBER 20-21, 2004 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora.  Reason 1.4 (b 
) and (d). 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  At its October 21-22 meeting in Ottawa, 
the U.S.-Canada Permanent Joint Board on Defense (PJBD) 
 
-- recommended expeditious negotiation of an agreement to 
replace the current NORAD agreement expiring May 2006, with a 
further recommendation that the new Agreement have no 
termination date; 
 
-- recommended that the functions of the Bi-National Planning 
Group (BPG) be made permanent under a bi-national entity and 
that the U.S. and Canada explore the future placement of 
those functions during the NORAD renewal negotiations; 
 
-- recognized the need for enhanced bi-national maritime 
defense cooperation and recommended defining avenues to 
achieve that goal.  Both governments were invited to provide 
a progress report at the next PJBD meeting; 
 
-- recommended that the long-term requirements of the North 
Warning System be actively considered, inviting the North 
Warning System Office and the Air Defense Responsibility 
Sharing Working Group to update on developed options at the 
next PJBD meeting; 
 
-- supported the efforts of the Canadian Government \"to 
identify specific problems arising from insufficient 
information sharing\" and encouraged both governments to 
\"consider ways to improve information sharing\"; 
 
-- agreed to expand its membership to include U.S. Northern 
Command and the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff on a permanent 
basis. 
 
2. (SBU) Representatives from the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness 
Canada (PSEPC) participated in meetings for the first time as 
observers and briefed the Board on the structure and mandates 
of their respective agencies.  Canada\'s new co-Chairman, M.P. 
Judi Longfield, officiated for the first time.  She voiced 
great appreciation for U.S. co-Chairman Jack David\'s service 
and regret that this was his last meeting. 
 
CO-CHAIRMEN\'S REMARKS 
 
3. (C) Hon. Judi Longfield, in her debut as Canada\'s 
co-Chairman and host of the meeting, spoke of the 
\"indivisible cooperation and security\" between the U.S. and 
Canada that she witnessed at first hand on her introductory 
visit to NORAD in September.  She welcomed the August 5 
signing of the Amendment to sanction NORAD\'s air warning 
functions (ITW/AA) in support of missile defense as 
reinforcing NORAD\'s vital role in defense of the continent. 
Mrs. Longfield provided assurances that formal approval of 
the BPG extension would be forthcoming very soon.  She cited 
other benchmarks relevant to shared defense, including 
Canada\'s April 2004 rollout of a comprehensive national 
security policy and the Canadian government\'s commitment, 
over several years, of C$8 billion in support of security 
objectives.  Similarly, she highlighted the presence of DHS 
and PSEPC representatives at the PJBD as a noteworthy 
development. Longfield added that the new government\'s pledge 
to increase Canadian armed forces by 5,000 active duty and 
3,000 reserves, and C$7 billion to modernize the military, 
was another manifestation of Canada\'s commitment to 
continental defense and security and the desire to be more 
effective overseas.  She alluded to the government\'s ongoing 
defense and policy review which may identify other areas for 
improvement. 
 
4. (C) U.S. co-Chairman Jack David welcomed first-time U.S. 
participants to the PJBD.  He commended the successful 
conclusion of ISAF V under the leadership of Lieutenant 
General Hillier and the Canadian contributions to 
stabilization efforts in Haiti.  Alluding to the excellent 
work of the Bi-National Planning Group (BPG), Mr. David said 
the U.S. and Canada have a historic opportunity to transform 
NORAD.  With reference to the \"long-overdue review\" of 
Canada\'s defense capabilities, the U.S. co-Chairman hoped 
that the review would provide Canada with resources to 
\"project power to the farthest reaches of the globe.\"  On the 
topic of missile defense, he said the U.S. is open to 
Canadian participation, but recognizes it is a decision for 
Canada alone to make and is \"not pushing\" on this; the U.S. 
would press ahead to meet necessary deadlines regardless of 
Canadian participation.  At the same time, he concluded, the 
missile defense concept \"makes sense for Canada and 
continental defense.\" 
 
MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
5. (C) Barbara Martin, Acting Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC) 
Director General for International Security, expressed 
appreciation for the U.S. co-Chairman\'s comments on missile 
defense.  Acknowledging that political momentum for a 
Canadian decision on the U.S. missile defense program had 
slowed considerably due to domestic political developments, 
Martin thought that a parliamentary debate (the third this 
year) and non-binding vote later this Fall nonetheless would 
likely produce a favorable outcome.  At the same time, Martin 
concluded, the political environment for the minority 
government at this time was \"complex and difficult.\" 
 
6. (C) Martin cited the January 2004 letter of intent to 
explore missile defense cooperation with the USG and the 
August 2004 NORAD Agreement amendment as two important 
milestones for Canada.  She asserted the current government\'s 
rejection of Canadian opponents to MD that the program is 
merely \"Star Wars\" under another name, that the ABM Treaty 
prohibits establishment of national defense systems, or that 
a missile defense system will stimulate an arms race.  Though 
the Canadian government continued to oppose the 
\"weaponization of space\" as a core belief, Martin concluded, 
Canadians also supported collaboration with the U.S. in the 
defense of North America. 
 
NORAD\'S ROLE IN MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
7. (C) Lt. Col. Doug McCarty presented a briefing on NORAD\'s 
role in missile defense which reviewed the operational impact 
of the January 2004 Letters of Intent and the NORAD Agreement 
amendment.  Though the amendment did not explicitly enable 
Canadian operational training (for ITW/AA) alongside the 
U.S., a separate OSD policy memo subsequently paved the way. 
Lt. Col. McCarty noted that integration worked well up to the 
point of a \"defendable missile event.\"  In such a situation, 
a Canadian Command Director (CD) at NORAD,s Combined Command 
Center must defer to the senior U.S. officer on duty, who 
would then relay assessments to USNORTHCOM.  A U.S. 
NORAD-assigned CD can recommend action to USNORTHCOM.  State 
Department Representative Terry Breese reminded that missile 
defense execution for North America is assigned to USNORTHCOM 
by POTUS but questioned the interpretation given the NORAD 
Agreement amendment with respect to a CD\'s advising 
USNORTHCOM.  He undertook to review the issue in Washington. 
 
ENHANCED NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY AND NORAD RENEWAL 
 
8. (C) Presentations by Lt. Col. Creig Rice, from the Joint 
Staff, Col. Mike Hache of the Department of National Defense 
(DND) and NORAD Plans Director, Major General William 
Hodgkins, USAF, set the stage for discussion of enhanced 
North American security and NORAD renewal.  From the Canadian 
perspective, issues to discuss in the renewal process 
included information sharing, maritime surveillance and 
control, land surveillance and control, defense support for 
civil authorities, military assistance to civil authorities, 
and information operations. 
 
9. (C) Col. Hache and Major General Hodgkins noted the 
importance of establishing and sticking to milestones in the 
NORAD renewal process.  Assuming extension of the Bi-national 
Planning Group mandate to May 2006, the expiration date of 
the current NORAD Agreement, milestones would include: 
 
-- government mandates to negotiate by December 2004 
-- bilateral negotiations January-July 2005 
-- U.S. and Canadian internal government reviews in Fall 2005 
-- final NORAD Agreement ready by December 2005. 
 
ENHANCED MARITIME SECURITY COOPERATION 
 
10. (C) In the lively discussion of options for enhanced 
maritime security cooperation, Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) representative Mr. Matthew Broderick argued 
that much work would be needed for Washington to agree, by 
Fall 2005, to give to NORAD responsibility for maritime 
defense threat warning and control, similar to its role in 
aerospace defense.  While NORAD had demonstrated an 
unprecedented level of U.S. collaboration with a foreign 
government, he said, it remained unclear that this type of 
fusion necessarily was \"desirable\" in the maritime domain. 
Moreover, in his view an incoming vessel that posed a threat 
was more \"homeland security\" than \"defense.\"  Colonel Hache 
and others noted that there clearly was need to better 
monitor the maritime domain because the vulnerability existed 
and some form of bi-national cooperation was needed to 
address the vulnerability. 
 
BI-NATIONAL PLANNING GROUP 
 
11. (C) In her introductory remarks on the Bi-National 
Planning Group briefing, Ms. Longfield regretted the delay in 
Canada\'s formal agreement to the BPG extension.  The document 
was \"in the works,\" she said, awaiting the signatures of the 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Ministers.  USAF Col. Lauri Cross 
and CF Col. David Fraser provided an update on 
accomplishments within the Enhanced Military Cooperation 
Agreement mandate of the BPG.  These included establishment 
of the Bi-National Document Library; improved conference 
procedures; updated basic security document (and interim 
adoption pending completion of Canadian Defense Policy 
Review); progress on the blueprint for bi-national mil-to-mil 
support to civil authorities; ongoing work to update and 
further develop the existing plan for the combined defense of 
the CANUS region, such that it accounts for the current and 
future security environments and allows for synchronization 
across multiple domains; a range of activities in support of 
the mandate; and the BPG Interim Report, which captures ideas 
for enhanced military cooperation and identifies 42 
additional areas for study. 
 
12. (S) Col. Fraser added that the BPG was \"mapping\" U.S. and 
Canadian organizations to find gaps in the flow and 
coordination of information between/among them.  In the 
ensuing discussion, Maj. Gen. Hodgkins noted that 
\"releasability\" was the biggest impediment to the flow of 
information, and that bureaucratic inertia must be overcome. 
OSD Representative Jim Townsend observed that not all 
classified information qualified as \"intelligence.\"  He noted 
that whereas the BPG had done its job in identifying gaps in 
the information sharing process, it was up to each of the 
different \"communities\" to implement the remedy.  The BPG 
position was that each of the different communities needed 
incentives or directives to help them find remedies for 
sharing, not just within their communities but across 
agencies and the border, from senior leadership to action 
officers. 
 
13. (C) Mr. Victor Tise, of the BPG, guided Board members 
through a table top exercise designed to increase awareness 
of CANUS bi-national challenges and issues that can be 
expected while confronting asymmetric threats.  His notional 
scenario centered on two events in the Puget Sound area:  the 
sinking of a ferry with 2,500 passengers on board by an 
explosive-laden fast boat, and the attack on a nuclear 
submarine at Bangor Submarine Base by two seaplanes.  Within 
this context, the Board discussed the likely response, both 
by civilian and military authorities; measures for ensuring 
that necessary intelligence/information sharing was available 
for Dod and DND elements to act; and a responsive public 
affairs strategy to calm fears and ensure that Canadian and 
American national authorities send the same or complementary 
messages to the public related to these acts of terrorism. 
 
 
CANUS THREAT ASSESSMENT 
 
14. (C) Yves Levesque, DND Directorate of Strategic 
Intelligence, briefed on the cruise missile threat to North 
America, arguing that cruise missiles today pose the greatest 
missile threat to the continent.  He noted that there is 
little difference in the technology for a 1000-KM cruise 
missile and that of a short-range missile; and while there 
are more than 200 documented types of UAV in some 85 
countries, only 22 of those countries are members of the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).  Moreover, most of 
the MTCR controls are geared to ballistic missile 
proliferation.  Though the MTCR covers the guidance systems 
used for cruise missiles, monitoring and control of the 
latter poses a serious challenge due to ready availability of 
components.  Levesque said that the future asymmetric threat 
to the continent lay in the use of unconventional platforms 
for missile launches, proliferation behavior by state and 
non-state actors, and dual use technologies.

SUBJECT: CANADA: DEMARCHE ON SECOND ROUND OF UKRAINIAN 
ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 240442 
 
Classified By: Minister Political Counselor Brian Flora, reasons 1.4 (b 
) (d) 
 
1. (C) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to FAC Deputy 
Director for Eastern Europe Habib Massoud and Desk Officer 
Claude Demers November 12, the latter of whom recently 
returned from observing the first round of elections in 
Ukraine.  Massoud thanked us for the points and commented 
that we are generally in synch on the key issues.  He did 
note however, that the GOC is somewhat constrained in how 
forceful it can be with Ukraine because of the million strong 
Ukrainian Diaspora living in Canada.  The Ukrainian community 
wants a genuine democratic outcome, but more importantly it 
does not want Canada to curtail relations with Ukraine 
regardless of the outcome.  He said they are heavily 
concentrated in the Alberta region, which the PM has 
identified as a key political target and in fact the Deputy 
PM,s riding is heavily Ukrainian.  When they have an issue, 
&they don,t call me, they call the Minister,8 he said. 
This pressure, Massoud said, tends to moderate any response 
Canada has to electoral irregularities and Canada has 
generally reached the limits of its forcefulness.  Canada has 
issued several statements in the lead up to the vote and 
before the elections will issue an OSCE press statement. 
 
2. (C) That said, Massoud expressed that his department is 
genuinely more optimistic about how the election will turn 
out.  He said they have been surprised there has not been 
more violence and intimidation and believe there may be an 
acceptance on the part of many of the elites and oligarchs 
that Yushchenko is going to win and they will have to work 
with him.  Massoud also wonders if many key supporters of the 
current regime concede that the government has been so 
incompetent in its campaign of intimidation that it has 
simply lost the opportunity to swing the election.  They do 
not want to end up on the wrong side of the new regime. 
Massoud said he was demarched by the Russians recently, who 
said their government is prepared to work with either party; 
he believes they too appear to accept that Yushchenko may be 
the winner and are starting to make their peace with him. 
 
3. (C) Massoud said his department has considered several 
scenarios.  If Yushchenko wins a clear victory things will be 
the simplest.  A more difficult scenario will be if 
Yanukovych wins a clean vote after conducting a dirty 
campaign.  This becomes very problematic in terms of how to 
accept the results.  The third scenario is one in which 
Yanukovych wins, but with a small (5-10 percent) margin which 
is widely recognized to be roughly the number of stolen 
votes.  In the third scenario, and possibly in the second, 
Massoud said he is convinced there will be violence in the 
election,s aftermath. 
 
4. (C) A critical issue for Canada, Massoud added, will be 
the OSCE mission statements after the vote.  They will rely 
heavily on these statements as a declaration of legitimacy 
and will use them to defend their position on the outcome. 
The Government of Canada will be sending 15 long-term and 21 
short-term observers for the second round, and in addition 
three MPs will represent the Parliament and 60 members of the 
Ukrainian-Canadian Congress will observe as an independent 
group.  Massoud described the official delegation as &huge8 
by Canadian standards.  Canada welcomed the news that we 
would be funding an additional 1,000 observers and urged high 
standards in terms of training and credentialing of these 
observers to protect the integrity of the process, which can 
be diluted when there are less well-qualified observers. 
Finally, he said they had heard that the U.S. was considering 
sanctions if the vote is confirmed to be rigged in a 
Yanukovych victory, and wondered what those sanctions might 
entail, in addition to the visa blocks referred to in reftel.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. PREVIOUS MESSAGES HAVE EXPLAINED WHY PHARMACEUTICAL 
PRODUCTS MAY SELL AT CONSIDERABLY LOWER PRICES IN 
CANADA THAN IN THE U.S. MARKET.  IN ORDER TO TRACK 
EFFECTS OF THE CROSS-BORDER \"INTERNET PHARMACY\" TRADE 
ON CANADA\'S PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS, THIS MESSAGE CITES 
SOME KEY SOURCES OF DATA AND ANALYSIS.  WHILE THERE IS 
NO FIRM STATISTICAL EVIDENCE YET THAT CANADIAN 
PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETS ARE BEING DISRUPTED, THE 
PHARMACEUTICAL PRICE REGULATOR HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN 
ABOUT REPORTS OF PRICE INCREASES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
RECENT PMPRB CONCERN 
-------------------- 
 
2. THE CANADIAN REGULATOR, THE PATENTED MEDICINE PRICES 
REVIEW BOARD (PMPRB), COLLECTS AND ANALYZES DATA ON 
DRUG PRICES IN CANADA, AND COMPARES THEM WITH THE U.S. 
AND SIX EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT (SEE 
WEBSITE PMPRB-CEPMB.GC.CA).  FOR 2003, IT SHOWS THAT 
PRICES FOR PATENTED DRUGS IN CANADA INCREASED BY LESS 
THAN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX, CONTINUING A TREND OF 
MORE THAN A DECADE.  A PMPRB OFFICIAL TOLD US THAT LAGS 
IN COLLECTING PRICE DATA MEAN THAT CERTAIN CURRENT 
UPWARD PRESSURES MIGHT NOT BE MEASURED FOR SOME TIME. 
 
3. IN OCTOBER, THE PMPRB\'S CHAIRMAN WROTE:  \"OVER THE 
PAST YEAR, THE PMPRB HAS RECEIVED QUESTIONS CONCERNING 
PUBLISHED REPORTS OF PRICE INCREASES FOR PATENTED 
DRUGS. . . WE HAVE REMINDED PHARMACEUTICAL PATENTEES OF 
THE PMPRB\'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT PRICES FOR 
PATENTED MEDICINES ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN ANY MARKET IN 
CANADA (EMPHASIS IN ORIGINAL).  THE PMPRB HAS RECEIVED 
INFORMATION THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE ADVISED THE TRADE 
OF PRICE INCREASES FOR CLOSE TO 35 PERCENT OF ALL 
PATENTED DRUG PRODUCTS IN 2004 (RAISING) THE QUESTION 
OF WHETHER WE ARE SEEING A CHANGE IN PRICING BEHAVIOR 
AND, IF SO, WHY.  . . . THE PMPRB IS DOING FURTHER WORK 
TO ASSESS WHETHER THE REPORTS OF PRICE INCREASES IN 
2004 REPRESENT A NEW TREND AND, IF SO, WHETHER THE 
CURRENT REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES ARE STILL 
APPROPRIATE.\" 
 
OTHER SOURCES 
------------- 
 
4. A COMPREHENSIVE 2003 PAPER BY DANZON AND FURUKAWA OF 
THE WHARTON SCHOOL (\"PRICES AND AVAILABILITY OF 
PHARMACEUTICALS:  EVIDENCE FROM NINE COUNTRIES\") FOUND 
THAT IN 1999 (WHEN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR WAS 
UNDERVALUED), AVERAGE CANADIAN PRICES WERE LOWER THAN 
THOSE IN OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPED MARKETS, AND 33 PERCENT 
LOWER THAN U.S. PRICES.  DANZON\'S WEBSITE AT 
HC.WHARTON.UPENN.EDU IS AN EXCELLENT SOURCE FOR SERIOUS 
WORK ON PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET ECONOMICS, BUT SUCH WORK 
IS GENERALLY BASED ON DATA WHICH IS AT LEAST TWO YEARS 
OLD. 
 
 
5. THE CANADIAN INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH INFORMATION (CIHI) 
MAINTAINS VERY DETAILED DATA ON CANADIAN PRESCRIPTIONS 
(INCLUDING PATIENTS\' POSTAL CODES).  WHILE THIS DATA 
COULD BE HIGHLY REVEALING OF PRICE AND DEMAND TRENDS, 
FOR EXAMPLE IN BORDER AREAS, THE CIHI IS A SELF- 
FINANCING BODY AND ONLY SHARES THIS DATA ON A 
COMMERCIAL BASIS.  HOWEVER, A CIHI EXPERT TOLD US IN 
EARLY NOVEMBER THAT SHE HAS YET TO SEE HARD STATISTICAL 
EVIDENCE OF ACCELERATING PRICES OR OTHER CHANGES IN THE 
MARKET.

THE CHARTER OF THE CANADA-U.S. BI-NATIONAL PLANNING GROUP 
(BPG) UNTIL 20060500.  THE BPG WILL BE ASKED TO CONTINUE 
THEIR WORK AND RECOMMEND WAYS TO INSTITUIONALIZE THEIR 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
TEXT:  1. (C/RELCAN) ON 20041104 CANADA\'S CABINET APPROVED 
THE EXTENSION OF THE CANADA-U.S. BI-NATIONAL PLANNING GROUP 
(BPG) UNTIL THE END OF MAY 2006 COINCIDENT WITH THE 
TERMINATION OF THE CURRENT NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENSE 
COMMAND (NORAD) AGREEMENT.  THE EXTENSION NOW ONLY REQUIRES 
THE FORMALITY OF AN ORDER-IN-COUNCIL TO PASS (EXPECTED 
MID-NOVEMBER 2004). 
 
2. (U) THE BPG HAS BEEN WORKING VERY EFFECTIVELY SINCE 
20021200 TO STUDY AND RECOMMEND NEW AREAS OF POTENTIAL CANUS 
MILITARY COOPERATION.  THEY HAVE INCREASED DIALOGUE AMONG 
U.S. AND CANADIAN MILITARY STAFFS, ADVOCATED ENHANCED 
INFO-SHARING, CATALOGUED OVER 350 BINATIONAL MILITARY 
PLANNING DOCUMENTS, AND STUDIED THE POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCED 
COOPERATION IN THE MARITIME, CYBER, AND CIVIL SUPPORT 
DOMAINS. 
 
3. (U)  THE BPG WILL CONTINUE ITS CURRENT WORK HIGHLIGHTED BY 
THE COMPLETION OF THE CANUS DEFENSE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT 
(CDSA); A COMPLETE REWRITE OF THE CANUS BASIC SECURITY 
DOCUMENT (BSD); A NEW CANUS CRISIS ACTION PLAN (CAP); AND A 
NEW CANUS COMBINED DEFENSE PLAN (CDP).  THESE NEW PLANS WERE 
WRITTEN TO FACILITATE THE CONDUCT OF JOINT AND COMBINED 
TRAINING AND EXERCISES IN SUPPORT OF BI-NATIONAL, 
CROSS-BORDER HOMELAND DEFENSE AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO 
CIVIL AUTHORITIES (MACA), ALSO KNOWN AS DEFENSE SUPPORT TO 
CIVIL AUTHORITIES (DSCA).  ALL SHOULD INCREASE BI-NATIONAL 
INTEROPERABILITY. 
 
4. (U) IN ADDITION, SEVERAL NEW MISSION AREAS FOR ENHANCED 
COOPERATION MAY BE TAKEN ON BY AN EXTENDED BPG: 
 
A. (U) JOINT AND COMBINED CANUS EXERCISES; 
 
B. (U) MISSILE DEFENSE ARRANGEMENTS (SUBJECT TO CANADA 
DECIDING TO PARTICIPATE); 
 
C. (U) ENHANCED CANUS INTERAGENCY COOPERATION AND 
COORDINATION; 
 
D. (U) INFORMATION OPERATIONS; 
 
E. (U) MULTI-NATIONAL DEFENSE AGREEMENTS. 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS. THE BPG HAS BEEN VIEWED 
BY BOTH THE U.S. AND CANADA AS AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.  WHILE 
THE EXTENSION OF THE BPG MANDATE COMES AS NO SURPRISE, IT WAS 
HELD UP IN GOVERNMENT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BECAUSE THE MARTIN 
GOVERNMENT SAW THE MISSILE DEFENSE ISSUE AS MORE PRESSING 
WHEN IN FACT THE BPG EXTENSION WAS THE MORE TIME SENSITIVE 
ISSUE SINCE IT WAS DUE TO EXPIRE IN 20041200. 
 
2. (C/NF) THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR THE BPG WILL BE TO 
CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO UNCHARTED TERRITORY AS THE ISSUES AND 
EQUITIES BECOME MORE AND MORE SENSITIVE WITH MARITIME DOMAIN 
AWARENESS AND SECURITY MISSIONS; CYBER SECURITY AND 
INFORMATION OPERATIONS; AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROTOCOLS SHOULD 
CANADA DECIDE TO JOIN.  THE BPG WILL ALSO HAVE TO PLAN FOR 
ITS OWN SUNSET IN MAY 2006, FIGURING OUT HOW TO 
INSTITUTIONALIZE ITS FUNCTIONS AND WHERE THEY SHOULD RESIDE - 
WHETHER IN NORAD, NORTHCOM, OR ELSEWHERE.

SUBJECT: CANADA: INTERIM TIP ASSESSMENT INPUT 
 
REF: STATE 228298 
 
1.  Poloff met with Alain Tellier, Deputy Director of the 
International Crime and Terrorism Division at Foreign Affairs 
Canada, on November 1, to discuss the requirement for an 
interim Trafficking in Person (TIP) assessment, based on 
Canada being elevated from a Tier 2 to a Tier 1 country in 
this year\'s TIP report.  Tellier is the co-chair of the 
Government of Canada Interdepartmental Working Group on TIP 
issues (GOC IWG-TIP), comprised of 17 GOC departments and 
agencies. 
 
2.  The following inputs are keyed to the questions on Canada 
contained in reftel: 
 
Q1.  What general anti-trafficking progress has the 
Government of Canada made since May 2004?  Provide details of 
salient achievements or setbacks. 
 
A1.  The GOC IWG-TIP notes the following achievements: 
 
a) TIP was identified as a government priority in the Speech 
from the Throne that opened the new session of the Canadian 
Parliament in October. 
 
b) Prime Minister Martin specifically raised the matter of 
TIP in his speech to the UN General Assembly in September. 
 
c) A roundtable discussion, with participants from the 
federal government, provincial government of British 
Columbia, the Vancouver Police, the RCMP, academics and a 
cross section of local NGO\'s, was held in Vancouver in 
November, to discuss issues related to TIP, including 
prevention and awareness and local issues. 
 
d) At the Cross Border Crime Forum, held in October, a 
proposal was approved to conduct a joint U.S.-Canada threat 
assessment on TIP. 
 
Q2.  Have Canadian law enforcement personnel started using 
the 2003 TIP law? 
 
A2.  According to the GOC IWG-TIP, there are at least five 
ongoing TIP investigations. 
 
Q3.  Have steps been taken to close down the large flow of 
Korean trafficking victims transiting British Columbia en 
route to the U.S.? 
 
A3.  According to the GOC IWG-TIP, \"Information currently 
held by Canadian authorities does not lead to the conclusion 
that such a situation exists and we would welcome any 
additional information available in this respect.  Canada 
remains committed to maintaining its close cooperation with 
U.S. authorities in securing the safe and efficient 
management of our common border.  The Canada/U.S. Integrated 
Border Enforcement Teams (IBETs) remain an important tool in 
this respect, as was recently reiterated by the Deputy Prime 
Minister to the Secretary of Homeland Security, when they met 
in October.  IBETs are multi-agency law enforcement teams 
that emphasize a harmonized approach to Canadian and U.S. 
efforts to target cross-border criminal and terrorist 
activity.  Regarding the fact that nationals from the 
Republic of Korea can travel visa free to Canada, it should 
be noted that Canadian visa policy is based on the premise 
that all persons require a visa to enter Canada unless 
specifically exempted.  Decisions to amend visa policy are 
based on a thorough analysis of a number of risk and benefit 
factors associated with the movement of foreign nationals. 
Canada reviews visa requirements on an ongoing basis.  As 
this is a secret process, it is not possible to disclose 
which countries have or may be under review.\"

SUMMARY: (C/NF) CANADA\'S LONG-AWAITED DEFENCE REVIEW IS 
LIKELY TO BE A WATERED DOWN UPDATE RATHER THAN 
TRANSFORMATIONAL.  DEVELOPED IN PARALLEL WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL POLICY REVIEW IT WILL HAVE POLICY AND RESOURCE 
DISCONNECTS. BUDGETARY ENVIRONMENT DIFFICULT. 
 
TEXT:  1. (C/NF) CANADA\'S DEFENCE REVIEW EXPECTED BEFORE THE 
END OF CY2004 WILL LIKELY BE DELAYED INTO CY2005.  THE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS CANADA (FAC) INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY 
REVIEW BEING DEVELOPED IN TANDEM, BUT WITHOUT COMPLETE 
TRANSPARENCY, IS LIKELY TO PROVE A MISMATCH WITH SOME DEFENSE 
OBJECTIVES AND BOTH ARE LIKELY TO BE UNDER-RESOURCED. 
ACCORDING TO SOURCE B, THE DEFENCE REVIEW WILL NOT CASCADE 
FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY REVIEW AND THE 
20040417 FIRST-EVER NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY AS ONE MIGHT 
EXPECT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE DEFENCE REVIEW IS UNLIKELY TO BE 
RELEASED IN TIME TO INFLUENCE THE 20050200 BUDGET FOR FY2005 
BEGINNING 20050401. SOURCE C AND OTHER SENIOR DEFENSE LEADERS 
ARE CONCERNED THAT THE FY2005 BUDGET WILL BE THE LAST 
OPPORTUNITY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS TO GET A PLUS-UP FOR 
DEFENSE BECAUSE THE FY2006 BUDGET WILL LIKELY BE AN ELECTION 
BUDGET AND FOCUS HEAVILY ON MORE POPULAR SOCIAL SPENDING TO 
GARNER VOTES.  THE INITIAL COUPLE OF BUDGETS AFTER THE NEXT 
ELECTION (WIDELY EXPECTED IN 2006) WILL STRUGGLE TO KEEP 
THOSE SPENDING PROMISES FOR SOCIAL PROGRAMS. 
 
2. (C/NF) THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY REVIEW WILL FOCUS 
ON THE CANADIAN 3DT APPROACH OF DIPLOMACY, DEFENSE, 
DEVELOPMENT, AND TRADE.  THE 3DT APPROACH WILL CARRY THROUGH 
INTO DEFENSE, BUT ACCORDING TO SOURCE E THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 
DISCONNECTS IN THE POLICIES AND RESOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME, 
DEFENSE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO TRANSITION FROM A PEACEKEEPING 
FOCUS TO A \'NATION-BUILDING\' FOCUS, INTEGRATING THE ELEMENTS 
OF DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE. THE DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO HOLD 
THE LINE ON ONLY PROVIDING TROOPS WHERE THEY CAN MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE MILITARILY.  ACCORDING TO SOURCE F, THE DEPARTMENT 
OF NATIONAL DEFENCE (DND) IS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE CANADIAN 
ARMY IN THE NICHE OF PROVIDING FORCES FOR \'HIGH-END 
INTERVENTION\', NOT HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE (HA) AND CIVIL 
AFFAIRS (CA). ACCORDING TO SOURCE C, TROOPS PARTICIPATING IN 
SFOR IN BOSNIA OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
CIVIL SUPPORT AND LIGHT DUTY MISSIONS RATHER THAN HARD 
SECURITY AND THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A DECLINE IN THE MORALE 
OF THOSE SOLDIERS  AND LESS WILLINGNESS TO DEPLOY FOR SOFT 
SECURITY MISSIONS.  (FIELD COMMENT:  THIS IS A PRIME REASON 
WHY CANADA IS SEEKING A CHALLENGING PROVINCIAL RECONSTRUCTION 
TEAM (PRT) MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN.) 
3. (U) ACCORDING TO SOURCE H, THE IMPACT OF THE 3DT APPROACH 
IS THAT THE SUCCESS OF CANADIAN FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES 
WILL BE INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THE FUNDAMENTAL 
CAPABILITIES OF THE CANADIAN FORCES (CF) TO UNDERTAKE 
SECURITY OPERATIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND FACILITATE THE 
\'DIPLOMACY\' AND \'DEVELOPMENT\' PILLARS OF 3DT.  SOURCE NOTES 
THE CAPABILITY OF THE CF TO UNDERTAKE THOSE OPERATIONS IS 
DEGRADED BY A FIXED OR DECLINING (IN REAL TERMS) DEFENSE 
BUDGET; RISING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) COSTS; 
SHRINKING CAPITAL BUDGETS; AND BY A \'DEFACTO DEFENCE 
CAPABILITIES TRIAGE AS CAPABILITIES SIMPLY DROP OFF THE TABLE 
DUE TO CAPITAL EROSION\'. 
 
4. (C/NF)  THE DEEPER ONE DELVES INTO THE ONGOING REVIEW THE 
MORE SCHIZOPHRENIC IT SEEMS. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CALLED FOR 
5,000 NEW REGULAR TROOPS AND 3,000 RESERVISTS, YET THEY HAVE 
NO CAPACITY TO TRAIN AND FIELD THEM FOR YEARS.  PM MARTIN HAS 
PROMISED MORE MONEY FOR THE TROOPS YET HE HAS NO SPECIFICS 
OTHER THAN TO REFER TO THE INVESTMENTS ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR IN 
MARITIME HELICOPTERS, MOBILE GUN SYSTEMS, AND JOINT SUPPORT 
SHIPS (A 6-10 YEAR PROJECT).  THIS, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
A 9 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLAR (USD 7.2 BILLION) SURPLUS 
EQUIVALENT TO 70 PERCENT OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET.  NO ONE IS 
TALKING ABOUT USING ANY OF THE SURPLUS FOR DEFENSE. 
ACCORDING TO SOURCE H, THERE IS A 1.6 BILLION CD (USD 1.3 
BILLION) (OVER 10 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL BUDGET) STRUCTURAL 
DEFICIT IN THE DEFENSE O&M BUDGET DRIVEN BY: 
 
A. (U) THE NEED TO RENT CIVILIAN EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES SUCH 
AS AIRLIFT IN PLACE OF INOPERATIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT (E.G., 
19 OF 32 C-130 HERCULES WHICH ARE NON-OPERATIONAL); 
 
B. (U) THE VAST AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES BEING POURED INTO THE 
MAINTENANCE OF OBSOLETE EQUIPMENT WAITING FOR THEIR 
REPLACEMENTS TO COME ON LINE (E.G., CH-124 SEA-KING MARITIME 
HELICOPTERS AND CC-115 BUFFALO FIXED WING SEARCH AND RESCUE 
(SAR) AIRCRAFT); 
 
C. (U) THE HIRING OF EXPENSIVE CIVILIAN CONTRACTORS WHO DRAW 
MASSIVE OVERTIME TO SUPPLY FIELD LOGISTICS SUPPORT IN PLACES 
LIKE AFGHANISTAN AND THE BALKANS; AND: 
 
D. (U) THE INCREASING COSTS OF REAL PROPERTY MAINTENANCE OF 
WORN-OUT INFRASTRUCTURE ON CANADIAN BASES WHICH ARE KEPT OPEN 
FOR POLITICAL RATHER THAN MILITARY OPERATIONAL REASONS. 
 
5. (C/NF) ACCORDING TO SOURCE D, THE DEFENCE REVIEW WILL ALSO 
CALL FOR AN INCREASE IN STRATEGIC LIFT, BUT MAY POINT TO THE 
JOINT SUPPORT SHIP AS SATISFYING THAT REQUIREMENT WHILE THE 
MILITARY CONTINUES TO RENT UKRAINIAN AN-124 AIRLIFT TO DEPLOY 
THE ARMY.  EVEN THOUGH A NO-COST OPTION OF LEASING FOUR C-17S 
(THROUGH RETIREMENT OF OLDER C-130S AND REDUCTION IN AN-124 
RENTAL COSTS) HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA, 
ACCORDING TO SOURCE B THE GOVERNMENT STILL HAS A HANGOVER 
FROM THE CANCELLATION OF THE PREVIOUS C-17 LEASE OPTION BY 
THEN MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENCE ((MCCALLUM)) WHO REMAINS IN 
CABINET AND HAS MADE DEFENSE PLANNERS RELUCTANT TO READDRESS 
THE ABYSSMAL STRATEGIC AIRLIFT SITUATION. (FIELD COMMENT: 
THE ISSUE OF HAVING ORGANIC AIRLIFT MAY GET ADDITIONAL 
ATTENTION AFTER CANADA HAD TO RENT AN AIRPLANE TO EVACUATE 
CANADIANS FROM COTE D\'IVOIRE.  SEVERAL SENIOR OFFICERS MADE 
THE POINT THAT CANADA SHOULD NOT BE DEPENDENT UPON RENTING 
AIRLIFT WITHOUT DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS TO ACCOMPLISH NONCOMBATANT 
EVACUATION OPERATIONS (NEO)). 
 
6. (C/NF) IN A RECENT MEETING WITH U.S. GENERAL AND FLAG 
OFFICERS, SOURCE G ANNOUNCED THAT \'CANADA REQUIRED A NATO OR 
UNITED NATIONS MANDATE BEFORE DEPLOYING TROOPS.\'  WHEN A FLAG 
OFFICER QUERIED SOURCE G ON WHAT ADDITIONAL MANDATE IS 
REQUIRED WHEN NATO HAS ALREADY CALLED FOR TROOPS TO TRAIN THE 
IRAQI ARMY AND THE UN IS REQUESTING TROOPS TO SECURE UN 
PERSONNEL ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE FREE AND SAFE ELECTIONS IN 
20050100, SOURCE G OPINED THAT \'THIS IS WHEN CANADA INVOKES 
THE STRATEGIC PAUSE AND THE FACT WE DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY.\' 
 
7. (C/NF) SOURCE F HAS BEEN HIGHLY FRUSTRATED BY THE ENTIRE 
DEFENSE REVIEW PROCESS AND CALLED IT \'SCHIZOPHRENIC.\'  EVEN 
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PLANS MADE AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHIEF 
OF DEFENCE STAFF TO STUDY HOW CANADA MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO 
TRAINING AND EQUIPPING THE IRAQI ARMY, THE IRAQ ISSUE IS SO 
CHARGED IN PARLIAMENT AND DOMESTICALLY THAT CANADA WILL BE 
UNLIKELY TO EVEN PROVIDE IRAQI ARMY TRAINING OUTSIDE IRAQ, 
SUCH AS INVITING IRAQI OFFICERS AND NCO\'S TO PARTICPATE IN 
MILITARY TRAINING COURSES IN CANADA. 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS. FRUSTRATIONS ARE RUNNING 
HIGH AS THE DEFENCE REVIEW ENTERS ITS FINAL PHASE. 
INTER-SERVICE RIVALRIES ARE REEMERGING WITH SOME CAPITALIZING 
ON THE CHICOUTIMI SUB ACCIDENT TO CALL FOR AN END TO SUBS IN 
THE CANADIAN FORCES, WITH THE ARMY NOT SUPPORTING STRATEGIC 
AIRLIFT FOR THE AIR FORCE (\'WE\'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN THERE 
SOMEHOW, HAVEN\'T WE?\'). BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLLS ARE 
SAYING MORE SHOULD BE SPENT ON DEFENSE WHILE, AT THE SAME 
TIME, THE GOVERNMENT IS ASKING FOR MONEY BACK FROM DEFENSE. 
OF THE 800 MILLION CD (USD 650 MILLION) ADDED ANNUALLY TO THE 
DEFENSE BUDGET TWO YEARS AGO, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS BACK 135 
MILLION CD (USD 110 MILLION) THIS YEAR, 185 MILLION CD (USD 
150 MILLION) IN FY2005, AND 480 MILLION CD (USD 400 MILLION) 
FOR FY2006 AND BEYOND (FROM A DEFENSE BUDGET OF JUST OVER 12 
BILLION CD (USD 10 BILLION)) TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE, CHILD 
CARE, AND OTHER SOCIAL PROGRAMS. OPTIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED 
SUCH AS CUTTING THE OPERATIONAL BUDGET BY FIVE PERCENT, 
CLOSING BASES (EXTREMELY POLITICALLY SENSITIVE - AN ORDER OF 
MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN BRAC), AND RETIRING NAVAL RESERVE 
VESSELS. 
 
2. (C/NF) WHILE THE TOP-HEAVY CANADIAN MILITARY TOTTERS 
ALONG, THERE IS LITTLE CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM THAT THIS DEFENCE 
REVIEW IS GOING TO BE THE CATALYST FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN 
PRESERVING EXISTING SERVICE EQUITIES, SALAMI-SLICING OF A 
BUDGET TOTALLY INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINING AND RECAPITALIZING

Summary and Key Themes 
 ---------------------- 
 
1. (C/NF) The Canadian Government and the Embassy strongly 
welcome your visit and the opportunities it will afford to 
advance our broad bilateral relationship.  The two key themes 
I would stress for your visit are partnership and 
reassurance.  The Canadians need to be reassured that at the 
end of the day, whatever tactical disagreements we may have 
over Iraq and individual trade cases, we are firmly united 
across the world,s longest undefended border by common 
values, shared political heritage, and the largest bilateral 
trading relationship in the planet,s history.  We need to 
send the message that we value Canada with no strings 
attached.  The early timing of this visit will help make this 
point. 
 
2. (C/NF) Specifically, it would be very helpful if you came 
to Ottawa with three key public messages.  First, a positive 
signal demonstrating movement on BSE, short of resolution but 
beyond &we,re working on it.8  A firm date for completion 
of the regulation would give PM Martin a huge political boost 
and help beleaguered Canadian ranchers get through the 
winter.  Second, appreciation for the positive role Canadians 
play in the world as peacekeepers and in transmitting our 
shared political and cultural values to failed and failing 
states.  And third, personal thanks for our close cooperation 
in defending the continent against terrorism, both in border 
security, and in the larger fight to roll back the 
availability of weapons of mass destruction, contain the 
activities of terrorist groups, and support development that 
will provide alternatives to terrorism. 
 
3. (C/NF) Several themes about the future would also be 
helpful for your private meetings.  You should note the 
substantial Canadian support to date for Iraq reconstruction 
and encourage Canada to play a larger role in the development 
of political and security institutions there.  You should 
promise continued close cooperation in places such as Sudan, 
Afghanistan, and Haiti, and solicit PM Martin,s views on how 
to best synergize our efforts.  And finally, you should 
commit to focus on settling our trade and environmental 
disputes.  End Summary 
 
Martin,s Minority Government Stable, but Weak 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) After governing in majority for ten years, the Liberal 
Party called elections June 28 to gain a mandate for PM 
Martin, who succeeded Jean Chretien in December 2003.  The 
Liberals were hurt by a scandal involving the disbursement of 
public monies in Quebec, and the Martin government was 
reduced to minority status, the first in Canada since 1979. 
In the first week of Parliament, Martin was able to loosely 
win over the New Democratic Party, putting him neck-and-neck 
with the Conservatives and the separatist Bloc Quebecois. 
Both the Liberal-NDP and the Conservative-Bloc alignments are 
very tentative, however, and different issue-driven 
coalitions are likely to emerge on an ad hoc basis. 
 
5. (SBU) Predictions on how long the government will last 
range from six months to two years.  Canadians do not want to 
go to the polls soon and the Government and Opposition know 
it.  But given the nature of Canada,s political system, the 
Government,s fall is never more than one bad decision away. 
 
6. (C/NF) The Liberal\'s thin margin leads Martin to exercise 
extreme caution, which some observers are now touting as weak 
leadership.  The PM has made it clear that he will not try to 
carry out an aggressive agenda, and on issues such as missile 
defense, would just as soon wait rather than try to tackle it 
now and risk a negative vote. 
 
Seeking Canada,s Place in the World 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) All of this is taking place in the context of a 
certain amount of soul-searching here on Canada,s decline 
from &middle power8 status to that of an &active 
observer8 of global affairs, a trend which some Canadians 
believe should be reversed.  In the short term the country,s 
priorities are improving the quality of life for Canadian 
citizens and there is little support for increasing defense 
spending (currently among the lowest per capita in NATO) or 
the foreign affairs budget.  PM Martin has promised to focus 
his government on policies to perpetuate the &Canadian 
economic miracle,8 help cities, improve health care, and 
provide easier access to child-care.  However, he has also 
made modest increases in the defense budget and has announced 
plans to add 5,000 troops to the armed forces. 
 
Engagement on Homeland Security 
------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Within the constraints of weak public support and 
low funding, PM Martin has made his foreign affairs and 
homeland security bureaucracies more capable and has kept 
Canada selectively active in global issues.  In the wake of 
the September 11 attacks, Canada has implemented a range of 
practical measures that improve Canada,s homeland security 
while facilitating the flow of people and commerce across our 
common border.  Starting with the December 2001 Smart Border 
Action Plan with the U.S., changes include enhancements to 
aviation security, full compliance with UN and other 
multilateral conventions, and strengthening of financial 
controls.  In the fall of 2003 Canada undertook an aggressive 
reorganization of its security and border agencies, 
consolidating them into a structure similar to that of DHS, 
and in April 2004 rolled out its first-ever national security 
strategy.  Bilateral efforts have resulted in better 
information sharing, joint targeting, and smoother flow of 
low-risk traffic. 
 
9. (S/NF) A potential irritant on the Canadian side that may 
be raised has to do with sharing of intelligence regarding 
Iraq operations.  The government is aware that we are 
creating a separate US-UK-Australia channel for sharing 
sensitive intelligence, including information that 
trationally has been U.S. eyes only.  The GOC has expressed 
concern at multiple levels that their exclusion from a 
traditional \"four-eyes\" construct is \"punishment\" for 
Canada,s non-participation in Iraq and they fear that the 
Iraq-related channel may evolve into a more permanent 
\"three-eyes\" only structure.  PM Martin may raise this with 
you privately. 
 
A Modest but Effective Agenda on Global Affairs 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
10. (C) PM Martin has also kept Canada in the game 
internationally.  In 2002 Ottawa sent 750 soldiers to 
Afghanistan where they served with distinction in Khandahar, 
and Canada led the maritime task force monitoring movement in 
the Persian Gulf, a service that began with an eye on 
Afghanistan but later was useful in the lead-up to Operation 
Iraqi Freedom.  Ottawa continued to support democratization 
in Afghanistan, leading the ISAF mission from February to 
August 2004, and contributing 2,300 of 7,100 troops.  Canada 
has been active in development and elections support for 
Afghanistan, committing USD 500 million to a wide-variety of 
programs through 2009.  Finally, Canada has pledged to deploy 
a Provincial Reconstruction Team, possibly to Khandahar, in 
the fall of 2005. 
 
11. (C) In Haiti, Canada has provided civilian police 
officers, a sizable aid budget, and positive involvement in 
diplomatic efforts on the ground.  Canada has been largely in 
synch with our efforts to seek a durable solution to Sudan,s 
current and chronic crisis.  PM Martin, who met with 
President al-Bashir in Sudan last week, supports the 
&responsibility to protect8 as an obligation of each 
government and a core function of the international community 
through the United Nations.  Canada has allocated US$16 
million to support the African Union in Sudan. 
12. (SBU) Despite opposition to our invasion of Iraq, Canada 
has offered strong support for Iraqi reconstruction, saying 
\"we can\'t afford to fail.\"  The GOC quickly committed funds, 
pledging about US$ 240 million in Madrid, and made active 
efforts to leverage contributions from countries that were 
initially hesitant.  Over two-thirds of Canada\'s aid has been 
allocated and over half has been disbursed on projects such 
as police trainers in Jordan. Canada also supports Paris Club 
efforts on debt reduction. 
 
Trade and the Border: Vital Links for Canada 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13. (SBU) The U.S. and Canada have the largest bilateral 
trade relationship in the history of the world and over 95% 
of that trade is trouble-free.  The billion dollars a day in 
trade with the U.S. generates about a third of Canada,s GDP, 
with energy exports and the integrated North American auto 
industry dominating the picture. 
14. (SBU) Since implementation of NAFTA ten years ago, 
US-Canada trade has doubled.  Most Canadians see NAFTA as a 
success but are frustrated by its limits, thrown into relief 
by U.S. trade remedy actions on softwood lumber and pork. 
Expectations that NAFTA would give Canadians greater control 
over US actions have largely been disappointed.  The softwood 
case remains a long-running and intractable irritant; even 
so, Canadian lumber exports boomed last year in response to 
US housing demand. 
 
15. (SBU) There are trade disputes and then there is beef. 
Reopening the border to trade in live cattle is Canada\'s most 
pressing bilateral concern and our top priority for this 
visit.  Cut out of our highly integrated North American 
market since 2003, Canadian ranchers have lost over $2 
billion to date.  Canada has spent $400 million on relief for 
the cattle industry, but many farmers and their suppliers may 
not survive another winter. Indefinite delays and the 
perceived unpredictability of the U.S. regulatory process 
have soured views of the U.S. in some of the most 
traditionally pro-American regions of Canada.  Issuance of 
the new rule, or at least a firm commitment to a date for 
completion, would help restore public confidence and give the 
GoC some political room to respond to other U.S. priorities. 
In the long term, failure to resolve the problem will result 
in two North American beef industries, reducing efficiencies 
and stiffening competition in traditional US export markets. 
Significantly, movement on beef will give Martin political 
space to cooperate more on security. 
 
16. (U) Canada enjoys an enviable economic situation, with 
steady budget surpluses and the most sharply-reduced debt 
burden in the G-7.  Although the economic outlook is rosy, 
the currency\'s rapid appreciation against the U.S dollar, 
driven partly by rising commodity prices, could put a damper 
on exports, and there are concerns here about global 
imbalances and the sustainability of the U.S. economic 
recovery.  Even with strong economic fundamentals, Canadian 
GDP growth is projected to lag that of the U.S. in 2004. 
 
17. (U) In addition to worries about exchange rate risk and 
perennial trade disputes, Canadians feel increasingly 
vulnerable to &border risk8.  Exporters worry about 
lengthening border delays due to infrastructure overload and 
to tighter security measures such as prior notice 
requirements.  Application of USVISIT fingerprint and photo 
requirements to Canadian non-citizen residents, and the 
possibility that eventually Canadians will require passports 
to enter the U.S., have sparked public anxiety among 
Canadians.  Businesses fear that future terrorist incidents 
could lead to catastrophic border closings and strongly 
support the GoC,s efforts to strengthen bilateral security 
cooperation.  Continued DHS engagement with Canada via the 
Smart Border Action Plan, the Ridge-McLellan dialogue, and 
regular working-level meetings, is a key element in managing 
this anxiety and addressing underlying problems.  The GoC is 
pushing to accelerate progress and add to the &Smart 
Border8 agenda in its version of the North American 
Initiative, &Beyond Smart Borders8. 
 
Energy Inter-Dependency 
----------------------- 
 
18. (U) Canada is by far the United States\' largest foreign 
source of energy.  It is our largest supplier of petroleum, 
as well as our leading external source of natural gas, 
uranium, and electric power.  With Alberta,s oil sands now 
classified as &proven reserves,8 Canada,s petroleum 
resources of 180 billion barrels are second only to Saudi 
Arabia,s. 
 
19. (U) Canada,s northern territories contain large energy 
resources, notably natural gas deposits in the delta of the 
Mackenzie River, several hundred miles east of Alaska,s 
Prudhoe Bay.  The energy industry expects that two gas 
pipelines will be built, one from the Mackenzie Delta and the 
other from Alaska,s North Slope.  As the regulatory 
framework for the Alaska line develops, industry will have to 
determine the pipeline,s exact route both in Alaska and as 
it passes through Canada. 
 
20. (U) Canada\'s electric power sector is interconnected at 
numerous points with the U.S. grid and has for decades been a 
large supplier of power to the U.S. market.  The U.S./Canada 
Joint Task Force that investigated the August 2003 power 
outage recommended the creation of a North American Electric 
Reliability Organization, which would implement mandatory 
standards for electricity transmission in both countries. 
Canadian players in this industry are intensely interested in 
the shape of proposed U.S. energy legislation, as it affects 
their future strategies. 
 
Environmental Issues 
-------------------- 
 
21. (U) The U.S. and Canada cooperate closely on a broad 
range of environmental issues. Together we have made 
significant progress on key issues, including trans-boundary 
air and water pollution, regulation of pesticides and 
chemicals and protection of the Great Lakes. 
 
22. (C) There are, however, a number of thorny cross-border 
water issues still unresolved, including Canadian demands 
that the U.S. move a derelict fishing vessel (Victoria M) 
mistakenly scuttled in Canadian waters, controversy over the 
proposed clean-up of pollution of the Columbia River from a 
Canadian smelter in British Columbia and North Dakota,s 
plans to mitigate flooding at Devils Lake by pumping water 
through a canal system to the Red River. 
 
23. (C) The Canadians have raised these issues before at 
senior levels and are likely to do so again.  The most 
pressing of these problems is Devils Lake, where Canada 
believes that the state outlet from the lake to the Red River 
would violate the Boundary Waters Treaty.  North Dakota has 
almost completed its canal system and plans to start pumping 
water in the spring of 2005.  Canada has asked for U.S. 
agreement to &refer8 this issue to the International Joint 
Commission for study and recommendations, but we have not yet 
responded to that request.  The Embassy believes it would be 
in our interest to agree to a &reference,8 tightly limited 
in scope and time-frame. 
 
24. (U) Canada formally ratified the Kyoto Accord at the end 
of 2002, despite vocal opposition from some provincial 
governments and industries.  While political approaches to 
the climate change issue have differed between the U.S. and 
Canada, practical cooperation has been close.  In 2002, we 
signed agreements on Renewable Energy and Climate Science, 
and formed a bilateral Working Group on Climate Change.  Few 
Canadians understand just how much we do on climate change, 
reducing U.S. efforts only to Kyoto.  Canada participates in 
several U.S.-led multilateral initiatives, such as the Carbon 
Sequestration Leadership Forum and the International 
Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy.  We expect that they 
will soon join the Methane to Markets Partnership.

1. (C/NF) Summary: Just over ten days in advance of President 
Bush\'s visit to Canada (reftel), PM Martin,s Liberals were 
hit from three sides in Parliamentary Question Period 
November 18.  Conservatives criticized the PM,s slow 
disciplining of anti-American MP Carolyn Parrish, questioned 
the Party\'s knowledge of a former Liberal Minister,s alleged 
mafia ties, and accused the Immigration Minister of 
impropriety.  The three cases received front-page attention 
the following day, and their negative impact for the PM and 
his Liberal caucus will likely drag on for some time.  The 
Liberal Party is already hamstrung by its minority government 
status, and this will make things even more difficult for 
Martin to pursue his agenda.  The only good news is that 
anti-American MP Parrish\'s ejection from the Liberal Party 
will save Martin from the guilt by association that he has 
been enduring because of her.  End Summary 
 
2. (C) This cable offers additional political background in 
advance of President Bush\'s visit to Canada November 30 to 
December 1 (see reftel). 
 
PARRISH THE THOUGHT: CAROLYN GETS THE BOOT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3. (C) Thursday,s Question Period in Parliament brought to 
the public three embarrassments for the Martin government. 
Just prior to the Question Period Martin finally put his foot 
down and gave Carolyn Parrish the boot.  In a tersely worded 
statement he said &After speaking with the caucus executive 
earlier this afternoon, I am announcing the decision, 
effective immediately, to dismiss Carolyn Parrish from the 
government caucus. . . I told her that, while I have defended 
her right to express her views frankly, I cannot, as Leader 
of our Party and the government caucus, tolerate behavior 
that demeans and disrespects others. . .8 
 
4. (C) The decision came after two incendiary incidents, 
Parrishisms as they are known here.  First, a Parrish skit 
that will air tonight on a popular Canadian television 
program of political satire -- &This Hour has 22 Minutes,8 
was previewed in the press Thursday.  In the skit, Parrish is 
seen crushing a George W. Bush doll with her boot, laughing 
as she grinds it into the carpet.  This of course, was added 
to Parrish,s many &off camera8 remarks about the American 
bastards8 and the &coalition of the idiots.8  Parrish 
followed this up by stating in an interview that the reason 
Martin can,t control her is that she has &absolutely no 
loyalty to this team -- none.  After what they put me through 
and lots of my colleagues, they can all go to hell.8  She 
went on to state that she would not be upset if Martin loses 
the next election, and continued her diatribe Friday by 
stating that she was relieved to be out of the party,&which 
is no longer the party of Trudeau, Pearson, or Chretien.8 
 
5. (C) Parrish will still be a member of Parliament, joining 
the other independent Chuck Cadman.  (Cadman, a staunch 
conservative, will probably be less than thrilled by the 
prospect of sharing a bench with Parrish.)  The move leaves 
the Liberals with 132 seats (taking out Speaker Milliken who 
only votes to break a tie), which, when added to the 19 NDP 
totals 151.  The Conservatives and Bloc together have 153 (99 
and 54).  The two independents thus become very significant 
players in contentious votes, as does the Speaker. 
Presumably, Parrish will be less likely to help the 
government than Cadman will be to help the opposition. 
 
6. (C) The Conservatives used question period to spotlight 
the fact that Martin did not move against Parrish for her 
many attacks against the United States, but when she attacked 
him she was put out immediately.  Parrish,s riding outside 
Toronto is reported by the Globe and Mail to be reacting with 
a combination of &pride, anger, and amusement8 to 
Parrish,s antics and her ouster from the Liberal Party. 
 
ALL IN THE FAMILY: FORMER MINISTER ACCUSED OF MOB TIES 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (C) Staying on the offensive, Opposition Leader Stephen 
Harper then raised allegations in Question Period that former 
Liberal Cabinet Minister Alfonso Gagliano had ties to the 
Bonanno crime family in New York.  The accusations, which 
were reported November 18 in the New York Daily News, were 
based on FBI documents which are quoted in the National Post, 
as follows: & was shown a picture of 
Alfonso Gagliano.  Lino stated he recognized Gagliano from 
his trip to Montreal in the early 1990,s.  Lino advised that 
Gagliano was introduced to him as a soldier in the Bonanno 
family by Joe Lopresti, another Bonanno member in Canada.  At 
a dinner, Lopresti bragged to the individual that the 
Montreal Bonannos had such extensive connections, including 
to Gagliano, a politician.8 
 
8. (C) Harper asked the PM in Question Period whether the 
government was aware of these accusations and when it became 
aware of them?  Martin replied that he had not seen the 
report until that morning, but stated that the accusations 
were very serious and &everyone should be careful about 
accepting or in fact repeating such allegations in a 
premature way.8  The story was front page above the fold 
news in all major dailies, and the details as reported in the 
press cut several different ways.  Lino, according to some 
involved in the Bonanno family case, has questionable 
credibility (he reportedly pleaded guilty to six murders and 
is an admitted drug user).  On the other hand, Gagliano, an 
accountant, admitted in 1994 to keeping books for a convicted 
mob figure in Montreal (the RCMP later cleared Gagliano of 
any wrongdoing in the case but the individual in question 
served six years).  It is the kind of case that will drag on 
for weeks or months as accusations and counter-accusations 
surface. 
 
THE CITIZENSHIP FOR STIPPERS PROGRAM 
------------------------------------ 
 
9. (C) In a rare triple-header, the Conservatives then turned 
on Immigration Minister Judy Sgro, who was accused of 
fast-tracking the citizenship petition of a Romanian stripper 
who worked on Sgro,s campaign part-time.  Tory MP Monte 
Solberg also demanded an explanation for the $11,000 lodging 
and per diem expenditures for Ms. Sgro,s political staff in 
Toronto during the election.  Sgro responded regarding the 
nude dancer petition that &all the things I have done have 
been based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  How 
dare they question a person,s lifestyle and suggest that 
they are less worthy.8  She then defended the temporary duty 
during the election by stating that all the spending by her 
staff conformed completely with treasury department rules. 
Solberg responded for the Opposition: &I do not think the 
immigration minister understands how serious the situation 
is.  If she will not answer, will she step aside until the 
ethics commissioner finishes his investigation?8 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C/NF) Overall it was not a good day for PM Martin, who 
departed later in the afternoon for a 10-day trip to Latin 
America and Africa.  The Parrish dismissal was inevitable and 
takes away an ongoing thorn in the PM,s side.  Parrish will 
retain the capacity to embarrass Canada, but will no longer 
heap shame on the Liberal Party and provide such rich 
material for the Conservatives in Question Period.  The 
significance of the Gagliano case, according to one 
commentator, is not what actually happened, but the fact that 
a mob figure has been tied to the Liberals at all, at a time 
when they are still digging out of the sponsorship scandal. 
It will be a millstone around the Liberal,s neck and 
Harper,s team will look to milk it for everything it is 
worth.  And the Sgro controversy will likewise conjure up 
images of a Liberal Party that skirts the rules whenever it 
suits it. 
 
11. (C/NF) While the minority Liberal government does not 
seem to be in danger of falling anytime soon, taken together 
these cases further weaken Martin personally, who comes out 
looking tepid for his slow disciplining of Parrish and his 
failure to investigate earlier allegations against Sgro.  It 
was probably a good time to get away.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SENV, CA, Environment, Devils Lake 
SUBJECT: RESOLVING OUR DIFFERENCES ON DEVILS LAKE 
 
1. At the top of our environmental agenda\'s list of 
unfinished business and disasterous consequences of inaction 
is Devils Lake.  With the U.S. elections now behind us and 
the President planning to visit Ottawa later this month, it 
is time for us to revisit this issue and our long-overdue 
response to the Canadian request that it be referred to the 
International Joint Commission (IJC) for study and 
recommendations.  The Prime Minister and other senior 
Canadian officials have raised the Devils Lake issue 
repeatedly and they are likely to raise it again during the 
President\'s upcoming visit. In the past, we always had the 
luxury of putting off a decision pending the outcome of 
various legal challenges and the fact that no water transfer 
was imminent.  We no longer have the luxury of delaying our 
decision.  North Dakota\'s outlet is expected to be completed 
shortly and the state reportedly will be ready to start 
pumping water into the Sheyenne River next spring. 
 
2. It is the Embassy\'s view that a reference on Devils Lake 
to the IJC is in the best interests of both countries and 
offers an opportunity to resolve our differences amicably. 
The IJC was created under the Boundary Waters Treaty for just 
this type of situation.  Unfortunately, the Canadians were 
unwilling to move ahead with a reference when we made the 
initial proposal a couple of years ago.  In April this year, 
they recognized their mistake (although they wouldn\'t put it 
quite that way) and requested a broad reference on Devils 
Lake and other water issues involving North Dakota. 
 
3. While we see no basis for including those other North 
Dakota water issues or the proposed federal outlet project at 
Devils Lake, which was the subject of a separate review 
process for compliance with the Boundary Waters Treaty (BWT), 
 we should agree to a reference on the state outlet at Devils 
Lake, strictly limited in scope and time frame.  Failure to 
do so will leave us open to Canadian accusations that the 
state outlet does not comply with U.S. obligations under the 
BWT and could lead to acts of retaliation by the provincial 
government of Manitoba.  The Premier of Manitoba reportedly 
has asked his engineers to look at the possibility of 
blocking some cross-border water flows if North Dakota starts 
pumping water from Devils Lake.  This issue clearly has the 
potential to become a major irritant between our two 
countries.  Premier Doer has, however, said that he would 
abide by the outcome of an IJC reference on this issue, a 
position which represents significant movement on his part. 
Both countries rely heavily on the BWT to challenge projects 
and activities that could potentially pollute our shared 
water resources.  It is important in this case, that we act 
to preserve confidence in the treaty. 
 
4. We recognize the damage that rising water levels and 
flooding have caused in North Dakota around Devils Lake.  The 
state and federal governments have had to expend hundreds of 
millions of dollars to move buildings, rebuild roads and 
dikes and compensate farmers and local residents.  We would 
like to see the state project proceed, but we should be sure 
that it complies with our treaty obligations to Canada before 
it begins pumping water.  Therefore, we propose that the U.S. 
position contain the following elements. 
 
a) We should agree to a joint reference to the IJC, limited 
in scope to the state outlet and strictly limited in its time 
frame. 
 
b) We should further frame the reference so as not to derail 
the state outlet.  If the IJC finds that the outlet fails to 
meet U.S. obligations under the BWT, its recommendations 
should be directed at what can be done to correct 
deficiencies. 
 
c) The reference should address the still outstanding issue 
of the possible transfer of invasive species not already in 
the Sheyenne and Red Rivers. A biota study, as provided for 
in the Secretary\'s letter of January 2004 on the proposed 
federal outlet, is a must, but it should be on a very tight 
time schedule to avoid unnecessarily delaying operation of 
the state outlet. 
 
5. The Canadians are likely to raise Devils Lake during the 
President\'s visit, either directly with the President or 
separately in the Secretary\'s meetings.  We should be 
prepared to give the Canadians a positive response to their 
request for a reference to the IJC along the lines noted 
above.

improved global environmental governance.

STATUS QUO HAS GOT TO GO 
 
REF:  A) Ottawa 2893

------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Canadian Transport Minister Jean Lapierre has 
signaled his interest in reviewing Canada\'s civil aviation 
policy.  He has proposed a broad examination of barriers to 
a more innovative and efficient civair system in Canada, 
including questioning foreign investment limits and cabotage 
prohibitions.  This is the first time that a Minister of 
Transport has so enthusiastically questioned the status quo, 
but not the first time that these questions have been 
raised.  Most recently, in autumn 2002, Canada\'s Independent 
Transition Observer on Airline Restructuring called for the 
Government of Canada (GOC) to vigorously pursue a program of 
liberalization of the airline market-- unilaterally if 
necessary.  Those recommendations, and others like them from 
2001, 1999 and earlier, all fell on deaf ears when David 
Collenette was Minister of Transport (from June 1997 to 
December 2003).  The new Minister is clearly more amenable 
to change, but this will depend on USG willingness to engage 
on this issue as well as Canadian Cabinet interest in 
dealing with a potentially divisive issue while in a 
Minority government position.  For its part, Air Canada, the 
national flag carrier, has indicated that it is ready for a 
more open bilateral aviation agreement with the United 
States.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------- 
The Minister Talks Liberalization 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) The federal government is mulling a dramatic 
overhaul of the country\'s airline industry, including the 
elimination of limits on foreign ownership in Canadian 
airlines and even letting U.S. carriers fly passengers 
between Canadian destinations.  Jean Lapierre, the Transport 
Minister since June 2004 (Tony Valeri was Minister from 
December 2003 to June 2004), said in early October that he 
would reopen the question of a more liberal aviation 
agreement with the United States and initiate public debate 
on the issue (reftel B).  In late October Lapierre said that 
Canada must open up its airline sector and force Air Canada 
to survive on its own.  In his comments to airline 
executives on October 29 in Toronto Lapierre noted that: 
\"For nearly a quarter of a century, the federal government\'s 
air policies have been built on protecting what we have, 
rather than building something better, protecting against 
loss of service, against the loss of our national flag 
carrier.\"  \"The time for this approach is over,\" the 
Minister stated. 
 
3.  (U) At the Toronto meeting Lapierre questioned whether 
it is time to relax airline ownership restrictions, if it is 
time for Canada to consider allowing foreign carriers to 
provide domestic passenger service, and whether cargo 
cabotage should now be allowed.  Lapierre made similar 
allusions to liberalization in discussions with Ambassador 
Cellucci during their October 26 meeting (reftel A). 
 
4.  (U) Minister Lapierre said he intends to task the House 
of Commons Standing Committee on Transport with addressing 
these questions and, once he has their views, to \"move 
swiftly\" toward implementation.  Lapierre presented his 
proposals to the Commons Transport Committee in early 
November for its review and recommendations.  In a speech 
before the Air Transport Association of Canada in Vancouver 
on November 15, Lapierre said that he would ask the 
Transport Committee to consider not only a \"fully open skies 
agreement with the United States,\" but also an expanded, 
integrated market that includes Mexico. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The Issue Has Already Been Exhaustively Studied 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
5.  (U) This is not the first time that these questions have 
been raised in Canada, although this is the first time that 
the Minister of Transport has been so clearly enthusiastic 
about possibly altering the status quo. 
 
6. (U) In September 2002 Debra Ward, the \"Independent 
Transition Observer on Airline Restructuring,\" released her 
final report with long- and short-term policy 
recommendations on how to improve market competition in 
Canada\'s airline industry.  Ward\'s position was established 
in August 2000 (by then-Minister David Collennette) in the 
wake of the take-over of Canadian Airlines International by 
Air Canada, and the consequent establishment of Air Canada\'s 
monopoly position in the Canadian air travel market.  Ward 
had the mandate to examine the overall impact of airline 
restructuring on the following:  consumers; urban, rural and 
remote communities; travel agents and airports; and airlines 
and their employees.  (FYI:  Ward\'s 2002 report is available 
online: 
www.tc.gc.ca/pol/en/Air/Airline_Restructuring _menu_page.htm. 
End FYI.) 
 
7.  (U) In addition to liberalization, Ward\'s 
recommendations encompassed a wide array of subjects, such 
as the need for a \"Passenger Bill of Rights,\" provision of 
air service to small and isolated communities, and travel 
agency regulation.  Liberalization was identified as a long- 
term policy goal and four specific recommendations for 
action were made: 
 
A.  \"That the government make every effort to reach 
reciprocal agreements, but be prepared to liberalize air 
service without direct or immediate reciprocal benefits for 
carriers, if there is an obvious advantage for Canadians and 
consumers, and when the liberalization has either no impact 
on the carrier industry, or when the carrier interests are 
clearly subsumed by a greater benefit.\" 
 
B.  \"That, within the context of a liberalization framework, 
the Government of Canada liberalize the current rules of 
ownership to allow foreign-ownership of domestic Canadian 
carriers and a 49% ownership level of international 
carriers.\" 
 
C.  \"That the Government of Canada rigorously pursue and 
accelerate a program of liberalization under the bilateral 
regime.\" 
 
D.  \"That the Government of Canada work to achieve 
liberalized air agreements with key multinational partners 
and plan towards the establishment of common aviation 
areas.\" 
 
(Comment:  Ward identified the United States as the country 
that Canada should target first for enhanced liberalization 
negotiations.  End comment.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
Ward\'s Findings Echo Prior Reports 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) Over the past 12 years the Canadian Competition 
Bureau has consistently advised the GOC to liberalize 
domestic air transport, unilaterally if necessary, in order 
to enhance competition.  In the more recent past (since 
1999), the Competition Bureau has recommended that the GOC 
permit foreigners to hold up to 49 percent of voting shares 
in Canadian air carriers. 
 
9.  (U) The Canadian Transportation Act Review Panel, in its 
June 2001 report, also recommended that the limit on the 
voting shares of Canadian airlines that can be held by 
foreigners be raised to 49%.  That panel recommended that 
the government enter into negotiations with the United 
States and Mexico to create a North American Common Aviation 
Area in which carriers from Canada, the U.S., and Mexico 
would compete freely.  And, as a back-up option in the event 
those negotiations did not succeed, the Panel recommended 
that the government negotiate with other countries for the 
granting of reciprocal modified sixth freedom rights and of 
rights of establishment for foreign-owned domestic carriers. 
 
10.  (U) In addition, the House of Commons Standing 
Committee on Transport recommended in late 1999 that the GOC 
should raise the foreign ownership limit in Canada\'s 
airlines from the current 25 percent to 49 per cent; 
initiate negotiations with the United States on reciprocal 
cabotage; and examine the viability of licensing foreign- 
owned carriers to operate solely on Canadian domestic 
routes. 
 
------------------------ 
Will Liberalization Fly? 
------------------------ 
 
11.  (U) In 2002 then-Minister of Transport David Collenette 
reacted to Ward\'s recommendation to open Canada\'s passenger 
airline industry to foreign competition by noting the strong 
counter-argument that has been applied previously; i.e., 
that unilateral opening of Canadian air markets would lead 
to only the most passenger-intensive and lucrative routes 
receiving extra attention, while low-load routes serving 
smaller communities would be further marginalized. 
Collenette also declared that homegrown Canadian competition 
to Air Canada, such as Calgary-based WestJet, is 
increasingly successful and would only be damaged by 
unilateral liberalization.  Furthermore, Collenette pointed 
out that the United States had shown little enthusiasm for 
further reciprocal liberalization, e.g., passenger cabotage. 
 
12.  (U) Air Canada has recently indicated that it would be 
interested in liberalizing the aviation relationship. 
Speaking to reporters November 15 in Toronto, Air Canada 
Chief Executive Officer Robert Milton urged the USG and GOC 
to \"get on with\" expanding the existing bilateral aviation 
agreement, observing that he thinks that would be good for 
Air Canada\'s business.  Asked about reports that Minister 
Lapierre appears to have become the champion of a more 
liberal bilateral aviation policy, Milton was quoted as 
saying that he is as happy with that news as Red Sox fans 
were with the World Series. 
 
13.  (SBU) Embassy discussions in recent weeks with local 
Air Canada officials and industry insiders confirm Air 
Canada\'s interest in an enhanced aviation agreement, 
particularly for cargo.  There are reports that Air Canada 
would like to switch its air cargo operation from one which 
currently only carries cargo in the hold of passenger 
flights, to a full-service, all-cargo branch.  The carrier 
has reportedly started making inquiries for the acquisition 
of cargo freighters.  Air Canada officials suggest that the 
carrier\'s code share partner, United, would be supportive of 
negotiations for a broader bilateral aviation agreement, but 
we have not heard that directly from United. 
 
14.  (SBU) Comment:  We expect that many of the familiar 
protectionist arguments will be made against liberalization 
as Parliament debates Minister Lapierre\'s proposals.  There 
are many objective advocates of liberalization, however, 
such as Debra Ward, the Competition Bureau, and the 
Transportation Act Review Panel, all arguing in favor of 
opening up the aviation environment.  Now there is a 
Minister in place who seems to want to act on this body of 
well-reasoned advice.  He is clearly convening a 
parliamentary group to examine the issue to smoke out in 
advance any obstructionist views.  We will be speaking with 
Liberal, Conservative, Bloc Quebecois and NDP Members of 
Parliament to determine what their thinking might be on 
liberalization.  Post would also appreciate learning the 
views of the USG and U.S. aviation interests regarding 
reciprocal liberalization with Canada.  End comment.

SUBJECT:  THE CASE FOR RESTORING TRADE WITH CANADA 
          IN BEEF AND LIVESTOCK 
 
1. (U) This cable is sensitive, but unclassified.  This 
cable was prepared jointly by Ottawa\'s Economic and 
Foreign Agricultural Service staff. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.   (U) This message describes the economic costs which are 
estimated to stem from continued trade restrictions put in 
place to control BSE on the U.S.-Canada border.  These costs 
are so manifold that we do not attempt to quantify them, 
though the order of magnitude must certainly be multiple 
billions of dollars per year.  They include: 
 
-- Direct subsidy costs. 
 
-- Efficiency costs, not just in beef and livestock 
industries but throughout the economy. 
 
-- Possible eventual trade remedy cases. 
 
-- Distortion of consumers\' buying habits. 
 
-- Environmental costs. 
 
-- Harm to third-country exporters. 
 
-- Delayed or derailed trade negotiations. 
 
-- Increased competition between U.S. and Canadian 
exporters in third country markets. 
 
3. (U) In addition to these economic costs, continued 
trade disruption is exacting political costs for U.S. 
interests in Canada.  END SUMMARY. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
------------ 
 
4. (U) In May 2003, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
stopped imports of Canadian cattle and beef products 
after an animal in Canada tested positive for bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).  Although resumed 
trade in some products such as boxed beef in the fall 
of 2003 alleviated some of the worst economic losses, 
this trade - which is valued in billions of dollars - 
remains severely disrupted, not just across the U.S.- 
Canada border but also with third markets (Japan, 
Korea, Mexico). 
 
5. (U) Cattle is a big industry which had evolved into 
a highly integrated cross-border sector before the BSE 
event stopped trade literally overnight.  We know much 
about the gains from trade; BSE gives us a salient case 
study of the losses from stopping trade.  The 
integration of the U.S. and Canadian economies since 
1940 generated vast benefits, even if the analysis is 
limited to specific sectors.  When markets are suddenly 
disintegrated, even in a single sector, we can expect 
correspondingly large damage.  Because Canada\'s economy 
is smaller, the damage may be somewhat more obvious on 
this side of the border, but this does not mean that 
the U.S. is not being hurt on a comparable scale. 
 
\"REPOSITIONING\" THE CANADIAN LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
6. (U) In general, prior to 2003 Canada exported live 
cattle to the U.S. where the cattle were slaughtered 
and processed.  An immediate result of the border\'s 
closing was that livestock inventories built up rapidly 
in Canada.  After more than a year went by without full 
reopening of the border, Canadian attention turned 
toward expanding slaughtering and processing capacity 
within Canada - in order to help cull this inventory 
but, more importantly, to reduce dependence on cross- 
border trade and thus insure against possible future 
restrictions. 
7. (U) On September 10, 2004, Canada\'s federal 
government announced a multi-faceted strategy to 
\"reposition\" the industry, including up to C$488 
million (about US$400 million) in federal funding.  The 
goal of this repositioning project is to develop 
independent slaughterhouse and processing capacity for 
Canadian live cattle indefinitely excluded from their 
traditional export market.  Provincial governments have 
announced related measures (e.g. Manitoba committed 
C$11.5 million to a new slaughter plant).  Further 
measures are being considered. 
 
8. (U) These are painful decisions for Canadian 
governments, who generally are committed to market 
mechanisms and would far prefer to see the border 
reopened.  The longer BSE-induced trade restrictions 
remain in place, the more deeply Canadian players will 
commit themselves to the \"repositioning\" strategy.  And 
to the extent that it is implemented, this will distort 
the structure of the whole North American industry and 
raise its costs. 
 
9. (U) Economists foresee several obvious kinds of harm 
flowing from this strategy: 
 
-- Direct costs to governments (who pay the subsidies). 
Canadian governments have spent the past two decades 
reining in their deficits and reducing economic 
intervention of just this kind.  Indeed, we might 
encourage other countries to emulate their performance. 
Now, suddenly, they are held responsible for bailing 
out an industry that was globally competitive just 
eighteen months ago. 
 
-- Efficiency costs to the beef industry, whose 
\"repositioned\" continental pattern is sure to be less 
efficient than the one that existed pre-BSE. 
 
-- Efficiency costs to the rest of Canada\'s economy, 
which will be taxed to pay for the strategy and/or will 
pay higher prices for beef and related products. 
 
10. (SBU) In the long term, these subsidies may well 
have long-term disruptive effects on the bilateral 
relationship if competing U.S. producers file 
countervailing duty petitions.  GOC policymakers, who 
are veterans of repeated bilateral disputes over live 
swine and pork, are acutely aware of such risks and 
would prefer not to run them.  Nevertheless, the 
dramatic impact of the BSE event on their cattle and 
beef industries and the communities depending on them 
make some kind of support program both economically and 
politically necessary. 
 
LOSS OF SUPPLY TO U.S. MEAT AND DAIRY INDUSTRIES 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
11. (U) The BSE restrictions of May 2003 removed 
Canadian animals from the supply stream available to 
U.S. slaughter and processing plants.  In 2002 Canadian 
animals provided 32 percent of U.S. beef imports and 
nearly four percent of U.S. beef consumption.  The U.S. 
meat industry\'s supply options are narrower and 
presumably, its costs higher than they would be if 
trade had remained unrestricted.  Similarly, Canada was 
a major source of replacement heifers to U.S. dairy 
herds, so the stoppage of trade reduces their 
competitiveness as well. 
 
SURGE IN U.S. VEAL IMPORTS 
-------------------------- 
 
12. (U) BSE restrictions stopped Canada\'s access to 
U.S. markets for live veal calves, but not for veal 
meat.  As a result, Canadian processing plants 
increased their veal output and Canada\'s exports of 
veal meat to the United States approximately doubled. 
U.S. veal calf slaughter appears to have decreased as a 
result.  We are not surprised to hear that U.S. 
producers are now contemplating trade remedy action 
against Canadian veal. 
 
 
RESTAURANTS AND CONSUMERS 
------------------------- 
 
13. (U) Upscale Canadian restaurants and consumers 
normally buy U.S. prime beef in preference to Canadian 
product.  These imports were interrupted for several 
months after December 2003, during which a \"Buy 
Canadian Beef\" campaign took root.  While imports of 
these cuts of meat have resumed, elements of the \"Buy 
Canadian\" campaign have continued in order to support 
the hard-hit domestic industry, reduce its dependence 
on U.S. markets, and bring pressure on U.S. players to 
reopen trade completely. 
 
LOSS OF CANADIAN MARKET FOR U.S. PUREBREDS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
14. (U) Under normal commercial conditions, U.S. 
purebred beef breeders are important vendors at 
Canadian livestock shows.  BSE control measures 
prevented these breeders from bringing their animals to 
Canadian trade events, to the detriment of their 
business. 
 
 
RENDERING INDUSTRY RECYCLING SERVICES 
------------------------------------- 
 
15. (U) The rendering industry, which turns animal by- 
products and used cooking oils into saleable goods, 
also normally provides services to farmers and other 
businesses in the form of free disposal of animal 
carcasses and oils.  We understand that the oversupply 
of animals due to the trade stoppage has interrupted or 
terminated these services, imposing new costs on 
farmers, landfills and the environment. 
 
SECONDARY TRADE EFFECTS 
----------------------- 
 
16. (U) Prior to May 2003, the healthy beef trade 
situation in North America led Canada to allow 
significant supplementary imports from third countries, 
above its \"tariff rate quota\" (TRQ).  The stoppage of 
trade due to BSE forced Canada to stop allowing these 
imports, harming exporters in non-NAFTA countries such 
as Australia. 
 
17. (U) Prior to 2003 Canada had restricted imports of 
U.S. live cattle due to veterinary concern over an 
infection called \"bluetongue,\" but a successful pilot 
project was operating which exempted imports of U.S. 
feeder cattle under certain conditions.  In 2003-2004, 
U.S. and Canadian negotiators significantly increased 
year-round access for U.S. feeder cattle by eliminating 
the testing and treatment requirements for cattle 
imported from the United States.  This would have 
significantly benefited U.S. cattle exporters. 
Unfortunately, this progress was derailed by the 
imposition of control measures for BSE - even though 
BSE is, in objective scientific terms, a less likely 
risk to animals or humans than bluetongue. 
 
17. (U) Finally, the restriction of cross-border trade 
has forced Canadian beef exporters and GOC trade 
officials to scour third countries for new markets for 
Canadian beef and livestock.  Any success in this 
effort is likely to be found in markets where U.S. meat 
is already sold -- to the detriment of U.S. beef and 
livestock exporters. 
 
18. (SBU) COMMENT: Continued delays in reopening the 
border are exacting large economic costs.  In the long 
run, however, the political costs may be even higher. 
The BSE crisis has hit hard in some of the regions of 
Canada that are most traditionally pro-U.S., and where 
there has been broad support for U.S. political and 
security agendas.  Pro-U.S. individuals and politicians 
in these areas are clearly feeling a sense of betrayal, 
as a number of MPs have pointed out to us.

REF: A) STATE 242059 B) RABAT 02086 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul Cellucci, reasons 1.4 (b) (d) 
 
1. (U) Ambassador Cellucci delivered ref A demarche with 
Moroccan Ambassador Mohammed Tange November 24 to Mark 
Bailey, Acting Assistant Deputy Minister for Africa and the 
Middle East.  Ambassador Cellucci stressed the importance the 
United States, and Secretary Powell personally, place on 
high-level attendance at the Forum for the Future and urged 
the GOC to make every effort for Foreign Minister Pettigrew 
to attend.  Bailey said that while several days ago it looked 
unlikely that the FM could travel due to key votes in 
Parliament (in the current minority Parliament every vote is 
needed to pass legislation), it now appears more likely he 
will be able to attend.  Pettigrew has invited several 
opposition legislators to accompany him to Morocco so that 
his missing vote will be balanced out.  Bailey said it 
appears this will do the trick.  Ambassador Tange said he 
also hoped the Finance Minister would be able to attend the 
parallel meetings on economic reform.  Bailey responded that 
the Minister would be unable to attend, but he will be 
represented by Associate Deputy Minister Paul Booth.  Bailey 
said he would be attending the sub-cabinet meeting on 
December 10.  Keith Chang, CIDA,s Director General for North 
Africa and the Middle East will also attend the main 
conference. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador then asked Bailey if there was any decision 
on Canada,s taking a lead role in election monitoring in 
Iraq.  Bailey responded that his colleagues are looking at it 
&feverishly.8  They are cautious about getting 
overextended, however, having to balance competing 
instructions by the Prime Minister to do anything possible to 
help with the Palestinian elections.  There are limited 
resources for such missions, Bailey said, and Canada is 
already heavily involved in several.  He said the government 
understands the importance of the Iraqi elections, however, 
and indicated that Canada is looking for a way to be helpful. 
 
 
3. (U) An article in today,s Globe and Mail was the first 
public announcement that Canada is involved in talks about an 
election monitoring role, and reported that &a formal 
announcement could coincide with the official visit to Canada 
next week of President George W. Bush.8   The article was a 
factual rundown of the issue to date, and covered the hurdles 
of security and preparation time as key impediments to Canada 
taking on the mission. 
 
4. (C) Comment: It sounds like FM Pettigrew will, in the end, 
be able to attend the conference.  If we do not have a firm 
answer by the end of the week, however, this would be a good 
item for discussion with the Secretary Powell when he travels 
to Ottawa next week.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN PARLIAMENT\'S INITIAL REACTION TO 
PRESIDENT\'S VISIT FOCUSES ON BSE AND MISSILE DEFENSE 
 
 
Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission John Dickson, reasons 1.4 (b) (d 
) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Initial public and political reaction to the 
visit of President Bush has been largely positive; we have 
received the \"bounce\" to the bilateral relationship that we 
were hoping for.  Attention has quickly come to focus on the 
issues of immediate concern to Canadians however, which are 
missile defense and BSE.  PM Martin was handed what one 
commentator called a &ticking time bomb8 when missile 
defense was made a priority in the bilateral relationship 
during the visit and he now must develop a strategy to 
deliver the goods while minimizing any political fallout.  In 
the December 1 Parliamentary question period the NDP and Bloc 
wasted no time in pressing the government to make a decision 
on missile defense and signaled that the Parliament will not 
be an idle bystander during the debate.  The Conservatives, 
for their part, attacked the lack of movement during the 
visit on the BSE issue, and Martin\'s lack of strategic focus 
on the bilateral relationship in general.  BMD remains 
Martin\'s open flank, and without inferring any form of 
linkage between the two issues, rapid movement on BSE could 
go far to strengthen Martin,s hand on this and other issues 
in which Canada\'s help is desirable by showing his ability to 
deliver for Canada.  It would also reinforce the visit as the 
new beginning in the bilateral relationship that we have been 
hoping for.  End Summary 
 
2. (C) Coverage of the President\'s visit has dominated the 
press here for three days.  It has been generally positive, 
acknowledging the effort the White House put into making the 
visit a success and the President and Mrs. Bush\'s 
multi-faceted meetings and appearances.  The Halifax speech 
was carefully scrutinized both for its Canada content and its 
broader international themes, again largely positive.  But by 
the afternoon of December 1 the Parliament and PMO were 
quickly pulling to the top of their in-boxes the issues that 
mattered most to Canadians -- namely BSE and Missile Defense, 
and more broadly the management of the bilateral relationship 
in general.  A view of the domestic political framework of 
the debate could be seen in PM Martin,s press conference in 
Halifax December 1 and the Parliamentary question period 
later in the day. 
 
3. (C) The Conservatives did not even allow their leader and 
the PM to return from Halifax before they criticized the 
Liberals for not delivering on the BSE issue during the 
visit.  During question period December 1, Peter McKay 
accused the PM of being more concerned with photo ops than 
substance and asked the Agriculture Minister to give a 
specific date when the border would be open to cattle 
exports.  Belinda Stronach complained that the issue is 
locked in a bureaucratic process that could take an 
additional six months and cost another $2 billion.  When the 
Agriculture Minister suggested the Conservatives not use the 
issue to score cheap political points, Stronach retorted that 
Canada was not making any movement on the issues that matter 
to Canada because U.S.-Canadian relations are simply not a 
strategic priority for this government.  NDP MP Charlie Angus 
(no kidding) returned to the issue later, saying that most 
Canadian cows will die of old age before they get mad cow 
disease and urged the government to work faster to get the 
issue resolved. 
 
4. (C) Bloc Quebecois, Michel Gauthier then asked whether 
the discussions on missile defense during the visit would be 
the beginning of cooperation on the weaponization of space. 
He said it was embarrassing that President Bush was providing 
more information on BMD to the Canadian people than the 
government had, and suggested that since President Bush has 
now openly stated that negotiations are well advanced (sic), 
the government should admit that there is an agreement in 
process.  (Note: Like the Conservatives, the BQ incorrectly 
believes that officials negotiations have taken place). 
 
5. (C) NDP Leader Layton then struggled through a BMD 
question after being shouted down three times by the entire 
house when he broke the cardinal rule of not naming names in 
the Parliament.  He said that Secretary Powell had told him 
that there would be weapons in space but they would not be 
aimed at earth.  He asked whether the government is now 
prepared to simply say no to putting a Canadian flag on 
President Bush,s missile defense program (this comment truly 
did have a Stranglovian feel to it -- with images of missiles 
hurling through space flying the Canadian flag). 
 
6. (C) PM Martin, mindful of the split in his own caucus on 
the BMD issue and the Liberal\'s united opposition to the Iraq 
war, needed to show a warming of relations with the United 
States while maintaining a healthy independence on these 
contentious issues.  In a press conference following the 
Halifax speech, Martin placed the missile defense debate in 
the larger context of continental security, stating clearly 
that &we will make our decisions on the wider interests of 
Canadian sovereignty.8  He reiterated in December 2 question 
period that questions of timing and involvement would be made 
by Canada for Canada.  He also needed to deflect the 
implication that he is no MacKenzie King, whom it was implied 
would have been more forward looking in dealing with the 
evolving threats in the world.  &Terrorism is a global 
threat that,s very, very different from the situation we 
were facing in the Second World War,8 he told reporters. 
Above all, Martin felt he could not be seen as blindly 
following an American lead, but rather as working in full 
partnership with the U.S. on issues of mutual concern, while 
delivering on Canada\'s key interests. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C) The President,s Halifax speech will certainly 
accelerate the BMD debate here.  It is an issue that is 
fraught with minefields for all parties, but especially this 
minority government.  The NDP and Bloc will oppose any BMD 
proposal and will attempt to score as many political points 
in the process as they can.  It has been suggested that one 
of these entities could bring the BMD debate to the floor and 
force a non-binding vote before the government is ready.  The 
Conservatives, who themselves view BMD as a political 
liability in Ontario and especially Quebec, will probably at 
this point back off from using the issue to beat up the 
government -- the President,s meeting with Party Leader 
Harper was very well received by Harper personally and by the 
party.  They can be expected to go along with a moderate and 
well-presented proposal on BMD.  The Liberals will remain 
split on the issue and could either allow members to vote 
their conscience, thus exposing cracks in the caucus, or 
attempt to impose party discipline, eliciting back-bench 
complaints to the press.  Either way it will be a contentious 
issue for the Liberal Party, which has a number of hard-core 
opponents of anything related to missile defense. 
 
8. (C) Martin would be helped in shepherding the program by 
several things.  First, he needs to be able to credibly, and 
technically, show that BMD categorically will not lead to 
\"weaponization\" of space.  Second, he needs to persuade 
Canadians that Canada\'s refusal to take part in the missile 
defense program would sour relations with the U.S. in the 
same way as the Iraq war (this point is already being made by 
columnists and pundits).  Third, he would be greatly helped 
by visible movement on the BSE issue.  No Canadian believes 
there is linkage between BSE and BMD, but all Canadians are 
sore about the former and most are hesitant about the latter. 
 If the USG could demonstrate good faith in quickly pushing 
the BSE review through OMB well ahead of the three month 
limit, it would generate good will that would make it easier 
for Martin to line up the votes on BMD, and would allow him 
some flexibility on other difficult requests in the U.S. file.

SUBJECT: CANADA SEEKS BALANCE IN MIDDLE EAST POLICY 
 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, reasons 1.4 (b 
) (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: In an effort to be a more effective player in 
the Middle East, Canada will vote against two contentious 
resolutions on Palestine rather than abstaining as in years 
past, and will support the resolution on a Middle East 
nuclear free zone.  These votes will bring Canada,s formal 
UN voting record more in line with its desire to have a 
balanced policy on Middle East issues, and will support its 
effort to push a reformist agenda in the UN.  The move 
generated some concern about domestic Canadian-Arab backlash, 
but in the end the government felt strongly enough about it 
to weather the storm.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) After years of abstaining on two UN resolutions (1 - 
Work of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian 
People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories; and 2 - 
Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the 
Palestinian People), Canada has decided to oppose these 
resolutions this year.  According to DFAIT Desk Officer Eric 
Walsh, the move is not so much a change in policy, as an 
effort to bring Canada,s voting record more in line with its 
policy -- which is one of balance in dealing with the parties 
in the Middle East.  In the spirit of balance, however, 
Canada will now support the resolution on the Risk of Nuclear 
Proliferation in the Middle East, also a change from its 
normal position of abstention. 
 
3. (C) Walsh confirms that there was a fairly involved 
political debate on the decision within the Canadian 
government.  On the surface it could be construed (and indeed 
in the press has been presented) as a tilt toward Israel. 
Many ridings, including that of FM Pettigrew, have large 
immigrant Arab populations and there was concern of a 
backlash against the Liberals.  This may have been the 
impetus to put the nuclear free zone resolution on the table 
at the same time.  But in the end the PMO decided that the 
issue was important enough to weather any storm that it 
causes and do the right thing. 
 
4. (C) In addition to policy balance, the new approach was 
intended to support Canada,s effort to reform the UN. 
Canadian Permrep Allan Rock gave a speech in New York 
November 30th outlining the new policy and stated that Canada 
has &consistently urged . . . the sponsors to make real 
efforts to reduce the number of resolutions, many of which 
are redundant and outdated.  This fact not only damages UN 
credibility but also gives the impression that their 
objectives are more rhetorical than results-oriented. . 
.Canada encourages a more innovative approach to drafting 
resolutions which are pragmatic, reality-driven texts, with 
mechanisms for follow-up on agreed benchmarks.8 
 
5. (C) Comment: Canada,s niche in the Middle East is one of 
honest and balanced broker and its niche in the UN is one of 
spirited reformer.  This small but significant gesture will 
strengthen Canada in both roles, part of PM Martin,s effort 
to promote a new multilateralism with Canada playing a 
constructive role in the Middle East and in the United 
Nations.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT BUSH VISIT BRINGS TOGETHER DISPARATE 
ARRAY OF DEMONSTRATORS 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, reasons 1.4 (b 
) (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Preparations were in place for large protests 
during the visit of President Bush but in the end it was a 
small, albeit at times unruly lot that demonstrated.  The 
stalwarts, such as the Raging Grannies and \"No War/No to 
Bush\" coalition, were paralleled by anarchists and others, 
but overall there did not seem to be widespread popular 
support for the anti-Bush display.  There were no more than 
5,000 total in Ottawa, with some 4,000 overall in Halifax. 
Demonstrators were of two persuasions, one group reasonably 
orderly and passive, and another group that engaged in 
sporadic incidents of violence throughout the two-day visit 
which left ten policemen hospitalized.  The modest numbers 
appear to reflect an inability by protest organizers to 
develop a compelling theme more than anything, but may also 
show the practical side to Canadians, and a desire to move 
beyond particular policies and see bilateral relations 
improve more broadly.  End Summary 
 
Raging Grannies and Belly Dancers vs. Bush 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Police and public security officials were braced for 
the worst in Ottawa during the President,s visit but in the 
end the demonstrations were modest in size, although at times 
violent.  There appeared to be a good deal of mobilizing in 
the week preceding the visit, with &No to Bush8 and &Rally 
Against BMD8 posters all over the city and protest websites 
reporting large numbers of hits.  There was talk of 
largescale bussing from other cities.  Some organizers were 
hoping for numbers in the tens of thousands and while 
expressing the desire for a peaceful protest, did not promise 
there wouldn,t be conflict.  Police brought in hundreds of 
officers from Toronto and other districts and riot police 
were staged throughout the central downtown district. 
 
3. (U) But lack of information on scheduling and the 
motorcade, as well as an apparent weak interest, apparently 
helped disrupt the plans of the disrupters.  One key rally 
was set to start at noon in front of Parliament, just about 
when the Bush party was leaving the grounds.  There were no 
more than 400 demonstrators on the grounds when the President 
met with PM Martin in Centre Block.  The crowd grew 
throughout the day and by evening there were several thousand 
protestors milling about downtown.  By then there were 
apparently two groups -- one largely passive and contained, 
and another looking for a fight.  One protest leader 
apparently defused a possible conflict when he successfully 
used a bullhorn to ask protestors to move back from the 
barricades while other groups threw objects at the police and 
engaged in shoving matches with public security officers. 
There were several incidents when the riot police had to push 
back against the crowd and a handful of arrests, but overall 
the protests were peaceful and orderly.  The rowdiest crowd 
showed up at the Hotel Chateau Laurier as the delegation left 
Ottawa December 1, doing mild damage to the outside of the 
building and putting ten policemen in the hospital (this 
unfortunately was the kind of incident CNN focused on). 
 
4. (U) In Halifax there was a similar crowd of about 4,000 
that staged outside the immigration museum where the 
President delivered his speech.  They had common themes of 
&No War8 and &Bush Go Home,8 but were, like their Ottawa 
counterparts, fairly subdued. 
 
Five Finger Waves 
----------------- 
 
5. (U) In both Ottawa and Halifax there were also scattered 
Bush supporters who did their best to ensure the President 
saw their positive message.  One group was given a tip by the 
local police and staged outside the airport on the motorcade 
route.  They were given a thumbs up sign by the President, 
who later thanked them for their &five finger salute8 in 
his speech. 
 
6. (C) What appeared to hurt the demonstrators most was a 
general lack of any theme.  Some commentators have suggested 
that there will, for any event, be a hard-core of 
&professional protestors.8   The Raging Grannies are fairly 
reliable, one of whom said she was protesting because of 
President Bush\'s stand on homosexuality, Iraq, and missile 
defense (this sort of potpourri of issues led one commentator 
to complain that protestors were &inventing protest.\")  The 
Belly Dancers Against Bush were nowhere to be seen and did 
not make a statement after the visit (they do tend to be more 
active in the summer for obvious reasons).  One of the key 
groups was &No War8 and &No to Bush,8 a coalition that 
grew out of the run-up to the Iraq war and focuses on Iraq 
and missile defense.  But there was little intelligent 
discourse on Iraq either during or after the visit, and other 
than demanding a pull-out from Iraq, the demonstrators had 
little to say.  There were also anarchists and other violent 
protestors sprinkled in, including some anti-Semitic skinhead 
type groups who were responsible for the violence that 
accompanied the protests.  All of this contrasts distinctly 
with the 20,000 demonstrators who came out to oppose the 
invasion of Iraq in 2003 when they may have believed their 
voice, and their numbers, would count. 
 
7. (C) Missile defense was the one theme that got people out 
with a coherent and manageable message.  There was a small 
demonstration on the Saturday preceding the visit against 
Canadian participation in the BMD program, which had fewer 
than a hundred demonstrators on Parliament Hill in a very 
well-organized display.  Anti-BMD demonstrators and themes 
were also sprinkled in the crowds during the visit. 
 
Jack Layton Multi-Tasks 
----------------------- 
 
8. (C) NDP,s Jack Layton was the only party leader to get 
involved in the protests.  Layton used party funds to hire an 
auto-dialing telemessage service to call 2000 Ottawa-area NDP 
supporters to encourage them to attend a candlelight vigil on 
Parliament Hill.  He also gave them the times and locations 
for several protests throughout the day.  Ironically, Layton 
went from the Parliament Hill protest directly to the 
President,s reception at the Museum of Civilization.  (Or 
perhaps not so ironically, since Layton apparently used his 
time with US officials to continue his protest against BMD). 
 
9. (C) Comment: The President,s visit was a good time to 
take stock of popular opposition to U.S. policies.  In the 
end an optimist could be somewhat encouraged.  One columnist 
went so far as to suggest that the protests were so small as 
to be embarrassing and &President Bush deserved a better 
show.8   While there is still widespread antipathy for 
certain U.S. policies here and for the current administration 
in particular, there is also a rising sense that the 
bilateral relationship is simply too important to allow such 
antipathy to overcome traditional Canadian practicality and 
it is time to move forward.

SUBJECT: CANADA: MARITIME COOPERATION 
 
 
1.  summary:  Canada\'s Minster of Justice, Irwin Cotler, 
informed Ambassador Cellucci on November 22 that the 
Government of Canada would be open to exploratory discussions 
with representatives of the US Government concerning an 
evaluation of need and then possible development of a 
maritime agreement, or shiprider protocol between the US and 
Canada. Cotler thought that the best existing mechanism for 
these talks would be within the Border Enforcement Subgroup 
of the Cross Border Crime Forum thus allowing eventual 
shiprider exercises, if agreed upon, to become operational 
extensions of already on-going and successful Integrated 
Border Enforcement Team (IBET) activities. 
end summary 
 
2.  During a one-on-one meeting in his Parliament Hill office 
on November 22, Canada\'s Minister of Justice, Irwin Cotler 
told Ambassador Cellucci that he and his Ministry are pleased 
to have become a more active participant in the US-Canada 
Cross Border Crime Forum.  Cotler commented that the Crime 
Forum has over the years proven itself a energetic and 
positive mechanism for the promotion of bi-lateral law 
enforcement cooperation and coordination by identifying 
problems and then developing the solutions to them.  Cotler 
suggested that in his experience, most Canadians have long 
recognized that just as the US homeland cannot be fully 
secure without the help of Canada, neither can Canada be 
truly safe without close cooperation with the United States. 
He noted that this was especially evident in the post-9/11 
era and that Canadian law enforcement officials are sensitive 
to the need to do more with their US counterparts. 
 
3.  As a result, Cotler said that Canada would be open to 
exploratory discussions with representatives of the US 
Government to ascertain if there is a need for an expanded 
law enforcement presence in the Great Lakes, Saint Lawrence 
Seaway and possibly along our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. 
He noted that on the Canadian side such discussions should 
include representatives from Transport Canada, Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness (PSEPC), Foreign Affairs Canada 
(FAC), the Ministry of Justice, the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police (RCMP), The Prime Minister\'s Office (PMO), and other 
interested stakeholders including the pertinent provincial 
authorities.  The key, Cotler stressed, would be to ensure 
that an agreed to enhanced maritime law enforcement 
commitment would be consistent with Canada\'s quote 
constitutional framework and law unquote. 
 
4.  As a practical step forward, Cotler said he thought that 
the most appropriate existing mechanism for these talks could 
be within the Border Enforcement Subgroup of the Cross Border 
Crime Forum.  This he suggested might allow eventual 
shiprider exercises, if agreed upon, to become operational 
extensions of already on-going and successful Integrated 
Border Enforcement Team (IBET) activities.  Cotler said he 
would confer with his counterpart and Canadian co-chair of 
the Cross Border Crime Forum, Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness Canada, Deputy Prime Minister Ann McLellan as 
well as US Department of Justice Forum organizers about 
tasking the Border Enforcement Subgroup with quote defining 
the problem and then offering solutions unquote. 
 
5.  Minister Cotler\'s remarks to the Ambassador mirrored a 
Canadian Government position expressed earlier to poloff.  On 
November 19, PSEPC Director General Caroline Melis said that 
DPM McLellan made clear that enhanced US-Canadian border 
security remains a national priority and that PSEPC stands 
ready to begin discussions with US officials with an eye 
towards an eventual maritime, or shiprider protocol.  Melis 
noted that the DPM\'s Senior Policy Advisor for Border 
Services, David Thelan, had underscored the value of a 
maritime agreement, to be spearheaded by a two week shiprider 
proof of concept exercise on the Great Lakes, but that the 
Ministry of Justice\'s Senior Legal Advisor as well as the 
RCMP\'s senior counsel advised that a shiprider exercise as 
described in the proof of concept was inconsistent with 
Canadian law and therefore should not be implemented within 
Canadian waters. (Note: the proof of concept discussed here 
was prepared by DHS and given to the RCMP in June.  Though 
the RCMP\'s Director General for Border Integrity fully 
endorsed the proposal, it appears to have languished in the 
RCMP\'s legal office until October.  Only then did the RCMP\'s 
senior legal advisor pass the proposal to the Ministry of 
Justice for the Government of Canada\'s official review and 
decision.  Post was advised in mid-October that Canada 
Justice found the proposal quote inconsistent with Canadian 
law unquote.  This appears to be the same fate suffered by a 
similar shiprider proposal given to the Canadian Government 
in the late 1990s.) 
 
6.  Comment:  Many of our Canadian interlocutors agree that a 
shiprider program would greatly enhance both US and Canadian 
law enforcement capabilities in and around our shared lakes, 
waterways and coasts and therefore should be done.  The 
seemingly contradictory hesitancy to conduct a early and 
quick proof of concept however, stems from a Canadian 
insistence that Canadian civil liberties and protections not 
be infringed upon by foreign officers of the law -- 
especially if armed.  As Miles was quick to point out the 
last thing we (Canadians) want is quote for another 31 
year-old mother of three to be killed by a US cop engaged in 
a high speed chase on Canadian streets -- with or without 
permission unquote.  This leads to the conclusion that the 
devil remains in the details and as we\'ve been told an 
eventual joint maritime exercise and hoped for protocol will 
require interagency consensus among all stakeholders within 
the Canadian Government. Therefore, Cotler\'s suggestion to 
task the Border Enforcement Subgroup of the Cross Border 
Crime Forum may be the best place to start.

SUMMARY: (U) THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE\'S TRANSFORMATION DOCUMENT 
IS LONG ON VISION BUT SHORT ON RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT IT. 
EXPECT THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE TO BECOME MORE HOMELAND AND 
CONTINENTALLY FOCUSED RATHER THAN A GLOBAL AIR FORCE. 
ENCLOSURE. 
 
TEXT:  1. (C/NF) THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE\'S TRANSFORMATION 
VISION HAS BEEN RELEASED FOR SOME FIVE MONTHS BUT PRECIOUS 
LITTLE PROGRESS IS TAKING PLACE AND THE AUTHOR OF THE VISION 
HAS MOVED ON TO NEW RESPONSIBILITIES, LEAVING THE NEW 
DIRECTOR OF AIR FORCE DEVELOPMENT TO FIND A WAY TO IMPLEMENT 
THE STRATEGY WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. 
 
2. (U)  THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS SUMMARIZE THE AIR FORCE\'S 
VISION FOR TRANSFORMATION.  FURTHER INFORMATION CAN BE 
OBTAINED FROM THE ENCLOSURE OR SOURCE D WEBSITE.  A 
SUBSEQUENT REPORT WILL DESCRIBE THE CONTEXT AND STRATEGIC 
DIRECTIONS (VECTORS) THE AIR FORCE HOPES TO TAKE TO 
ACCOMPLISH THIS TRANSFORMATION. 
 
3. (U) ((BEGIN SUMMARY)) CANADIAN AIR FORCE VISION:  AN AIR 
FORCE THAT IS EQUIPPED, TRAINED AND READY TO PREVAIL IN 
COMBAT REQUIRES FORCES ABLE TO WORK ALONGSIDE ALLIES TO CARRY 
OUT CHALLENGING MISSIONS AGAINST HIGH-QUALITY ADVERSARIES. 
THIS LEVEL OF CAPABILITY MEANS THE AIR FORCE REQUIRES: 
 
A. (U) AIRCRAFT AND OTHER SYSTEMS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR 
ANTICIPATED OPERATIONAL ROLES. PROPER EQUIPMENT IS VITAL. 
WHILE AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED FOR COMBAT CAN GENERALLY PERFORM 
PEACETIME ROLES, THE REVERSE IS NOT TRUE. 
 
B. (U) AIRCRAFT EQUIPPED TO OPERATE DURING THE DAY, AT NIGHT 
AND IN A VARIETY OF WEATHER CONDITIONS. SUCH AIRCRAFT MUST 
ALSO BE EQUIPPED WITH SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO WARN OF, AND HELP 
PROTECT AGAINST, INTEGRATED AIR DEFENCE SYSTEMS (IADS) 
COMPOSED OF ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY (AAA) AND SURFACE-TO-AIR 
MISSILE (SAM) SYSTEMS. 
 
C. (U) PROPERLY TRAINED FORCES ABLE TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE SPECTRUM OF CONFLICT. 
SINCE AIRCREWS ARE MOST LIKELY TO DIRECTLY ENGAGE THE ENEMY 
AND SINCE COMBAT SKILLS ARE PERISHABLE, AIRCREW MUST BE 
PROVIDED ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO REGULARLY PRACTICE THEIR 
SKILLS. 
 
D. (U) UNITS HELD AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF READINESS. 
READINESS RELATES TO HOW QUICKLY A FORCE CAN RESPOND AND IS A 
DIRECT PRODUCT OF TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT AVAILABILITY. 
RESPONSIVENESS IS ONE OF THE KEY ADVANTAGES OF AEROSPACE 
POWER. TO BE RESPONSIVE, AIR FORCE UNITS MUST BE KEPT AT 
RELATIVELY HIGH STATES OF READINESS. 
 
E. (U) SUFFICIENT DEPTH TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS ONCE ENGAGED. 
DEPTH DEPENDS ON NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND 
AIRCRAFT, PLUS STOCKPILES OF AMMUNITION AND OTHER 
CONSUMABLES. WHILE DEPTH DOES NOT OF ITSELF 
DETERMINE QUALITY, IT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE ABILITY OF THE AIR 
FORCE TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS OVER TIME. 
 
F. (U) AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT. 
WHILE THE RAISON D\'ETRE OF THE AIR FORCE IS OPERATIONS, 
ROBUST SUPPORT CAPABILITIES ARE ESSENTIAL IF UNITS ARE TO BE 
CAPABLE OF DEPLOYING, CONDUCTING SUSTAINED OPERATIONS AND 
RE-DEPLOYING EFFECTIVELY. 
 
G. (U) APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS AND 
ACCOMMODATE PERSONNEL. GIVEN THE REQUIREMENT TO OPERATE FROM 
AUSTERE BASES, AT LEAST SOME CAPABILITY MUST BE AVAILABLE TO 
PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS AT BASES IN CANADA AND 
ABROAD. 
 
H. (U) INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER SERVICES AND NATIONS. 
INTEROPERABILITY MEANS HAVING THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE 
SECURELY, AND, FOR COMBAT OPERATIONS, TO SHARE INFORMATION BY 
DATALINK.  COMBAT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO 
AVOID FRATRICIDE. FOR OFFENSIVE MISSIONS, PRECISION-GUIDED 
MUNITIONS (PGMS) ARE NEEDED TO ACCURATELY AND EFFECTIVELY 
ATTACK TARGETS WHILE MINIMIZING COLLATERAL DAMAGE. 
INTEROPERABILITY WITH THE U.S. IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION 
GIVEN THE LEADING ROLE THE U.S. EXERCISES IN REGIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY OPERATIONS. AND, 
 
I. (U)  SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF AIR FORCE PERSONNEL AND 
PLATFORMS TO ENSURE CRITICAL MASS.  CRITICAL MASS 
MEANS HAVING AN ABILITY TO MAINTAIN READINESS AT ASSIGNED 
LEVELS OR CONDUCT OPERATIONS WHILE 
STILL CARRYING OUT APPROPRIATE FORCE GENERATION FUNCTIONS. 
 
4. (U) REACH AND POWER.  REACH AND POWER APPROPRIATE TO 
GLOBAL INTERESTS MEANS THE AIR FORCE MUST HAVE ABILITIES TO: 
 
A. (U) FLY COMBAT AIRCRAFT (USING AIR-TO-AIR REFUELLING IF 
NECESSARY) TO, FROM AND WITHIN AN INTENDED AREA OF OPERATIONS. 
 
B. (U) PRECISELY LOCATE, IDENTIFY AND DESIGNATE TARGETS FROM 
THE AIR DURING THE DAY, AT NIGHT AND IN A VARIETY OF WEATHER 
CONDITIONS. 
 
C. (U) APPLY FORCE FROM THE AIR WITH PRECISION AGAINST 
AIRBORNE, SURFACE-BASED AND SUB-SURFACE TARGETS DURING THE 
DAY, AT NIGHT AND IN A VARIETY OF WEATHER CONDITIONS. 
 
D. (U) CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF APPLIED FORCE AND THE NEED TO 
RE-APPLY FORCE TO ACHIEVE DESIRED EFFECTS. 
 
E. (U) TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND PERSONNEL TO, FROM 
AND WITHIN AN INTENDED AREA OF OPERATIONS. 
 
F. (U) CONDUCT AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS (INCLUDING COMBAT 
OPERATIONS) IN THOSE REGIONS WHERE THE GOVERNMENT DETERMINES 
IT HAS (OR MAY HAVE) SECURITY INTERESTS. AND 
 
G. (U) WORK EFFECTIVELY WITHIN A COMBINED, INTER-AGENCY OR 
JOINT ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF C4ISR (COMMAND, CONTROL, 
COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, INFORMATION, SURVEILLANCE AND 
RECONNAISSANCE), COMBAT IDENTIFICATION, DOCTRINE, TRAINING 
AND EQUIPMENT. 
 
5. (U) AEROSPACE CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK.  TRANSFORMING CANADA\'S 
AIR FORCE IS ABOUT BUILDING THE RIGHT AIR FORCE FOR THE 
CANADA OF THE FUTURE AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW. 
IT IS ABOUT AN AIR FORCE THAT EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTES TO THE 
SECURITY OF CANADA AND ITS PEOPLE, AND ONE OF WHICH CANADIANS 
CAN BE PROUD.  AFTER THE COLD WAR, THE AIR FORCE AGGRESSIVELY 
REACTED TO A SERIES OF SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE REDUCTIONS AND 
ADAPTED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY 
ALTERED STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT. AS A RESULT OF THESE CUTS, 
CANADA\'S AIR FORCE HAS BECOME A FRAGILE ORGANIZATION; ONE 
THAT REQUIRES FURTHER CHANGES - A TRANSFORMATION - TO MEET 
THE DEMANDS OF THE FUTURE. THROUGH PRUDENT PLANNING AND 
FORWARD THINKING, THE AIR FORCE HAS DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE 
AND REASONED 
STRATEGIC VISION FROM WHICH TO BASE THIS TRANSFORMATION. 
IN ADDITION TO STRENGTHENING HOMELAND SECURITY, THIS VISION 
DESCRIBES A FORCE THAT WILL HAVE CAPABILITIES TO STRENGTHEN 
NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY AND INCREASE CANADA\'S INFLUENCE ON 
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. THIS VISION WAS BUILT ON A 
COMPREHENSIVE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE THAT CAN 
ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE, 
THE CANADIAN FORCES, AND THE AIR FORCE IN MAKING INFORMED 
DECISIONS FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
6. (U) THE STRATEGIC PATH TO TRANSFORMATION - FROM AIR TO 
AEROSPACE.  AEROSPACE, MEANING AIR AND SPACE, DEFINES THE 
ENVIRONMENT THAT SURROUNDS THE EARTH AND EXTENDS VERTICALLY 
INTO SPACE FROM THE EARTH\'S SURFACE.WE USE THE TERM 
DELIBERATELY TO UNDERSCORE THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE 
THAT SPACE WILL PLAY IN FUTURE MILITARY OPERATIONS.  OUR 
EXPLOITATION OF SPACE IS LIMITED TO COMMUNICATIONS, 
NAVIGATION, SURVEILLANCE AND WARNING, ENVIRONMENTAL 
MONITORING AND INTELLIGENCE AND RECONNAISSANCE ACTIVITIES. BY 
USING THE TERM AEROSPACE, WE DO NOT ENVISAGE OR SUGGEST THE 
\'WEAPONIZATION\' OF SPACE, SOMETHING THAT CANADA OPPOSES. 
 
7. (U) CHARACTERIZING THE FUTURE FORCE. THE VISION STRATEGIC 
VECTORS ANNOUNCES OUR INTENT TO TRANSFORM THE AIR FORCE FROM 
A PRIMARILY STATIC, PLATFORM-FOCUSED 
ORGANIZATION INTO AN EXPEDITIONARY, NETWORK-ENABLED, 
CAPABILITY-BASED AND RESULTS-FOCUSED AEROSPACE FORCE TO 
EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO SECURITY AT HOME AND ABROAD WELL 
INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A QUALITY FORCE 
BASED ON TEAMWORK, EXCELLENCE AND PROFESSIONALISM. 
 
A. (U) THE MISSION. THE MISSION OF THIS AEROSPACE FORCE WILL 
BE TO CONTROL AND EXPLOIT THE AEROSPACE ENVIRONMENT FOR 
MILITARY PURPOSES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CANADIAN SECURITY AND 
NATIONAL OBJECTIVES. 
 
B. (U) THE ATTRIBUTES.  THE ATTRIBUTES OF THIS FORCE WILL 
INCLUDE COMBAT CAPABILITY AS THE BASIS FOR OTHER CAPABILITY, 
INTEROPERABLE AND NETWORKED FORCES, MEANINGFUL AND 
SUSTAINABLE FORCES, EXPEDITIONARY REACH AND POWER, AND 
RESPONSIVENESS IN OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR MILITARY 
ETHOS OF SERVICE BEFORE SELF, THE MISSION COMES FIRST; 
HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE ARE OUR FOUNDATION AND 
FUTURE. IT IS THEY WHO WILL PROUDLY BUILD THIS AEROSPACE 
FORCE THROUGH LEADERSHIP, PROFESSIONALISM, AND EXCELLENCE. 
 
C. (U) BECOMING THE FUTURE FORCE.  AN AEROSPACE FORCE 
TRANSFORMING THE AIR FORCE OVER THE LONG-TERM INTO AN 
AEROSPACE FORCE MEANS BECOMING RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING 
PERSONNEL WITH THE SPACE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING REQUIRED 
FOR EFFECTIVE CANADIAN FORCES OPERATIONS. AN EXPEDITIONARY 
FORCE BECOMING AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE MEANS HAVING THE 
CAPABILITIES TO BE RESPONSIVE, DEPLOYABLE, SUPPORTABLE AND 
SUSTAINABLE WHEREVER THE GOVERNMENT SENDS US, DOMESTICALLY 
AND ABROAD. NETWORK-ENABLED BECOMING A NETWORK-ENABLED FORCE 
MEANS CONNECTING SENSORS, OPERATORS, AND DECISION-MAKERS IN 
ORDER TO SHARE HIGHER QUALITY AND MORE TIMELY INFORMATION, 
WHICH WILL FACILITATE IMPROVED JOINT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS, 
DECISION-MAKING, COLLABORATION, SYNCHRONIZATION, AND 
OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. 
 
D. (U) CAPABILITY-BASED AND RESULTS-FOCUSED. BECOMING 
CAPABILITY-BASED MEANS FOCUSING ON OUR CORE COMPETENCIES AND 
HAVING THE CAPABILITIES TO MEET OUR NATIONAL SECURITY 
RESPONSIBILITIES. BECOMING RESULTS-FOCUSED MEANS FOCUSING ON 
STRATEGIC LEVEL OUTCOMES, OR RESULTS, THAT CONTRIBUTE TO 
CANADIAN SECURITY, OUR BOTTOM LINE. 
E. (U)  VECTORS TOWARDS THE FUTURE. RESULTS-FOCUSED 
OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY MEANS ACQUIRING THE CAPABILITIES 
NEEDED TO KEEP CANADIANS SECURE AND TO PROTECT NATIONAL 
INTERESTS ABROAD: 
 
(1) (U) DOMESTICALLY - A DEFENDED AND SOVEREIGN CANADA WHOSE 
CITIZENS AND NATIONAL RESOURCES ARE PROTECTED; 
 
(2) (U) ABROAD - NATIONAL INTERESTS PROTECTED, AND WHEN 
NECESSARY, DEFENDED. 
 
F. (U) RESPONSIVE EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITY MEANS ACQUIRING 
THE CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO SWIFTLY AND EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO 
CHALLENGES AT HOME AND 
ABROAD BY BEING GLOBALLY DEPLOYABLE, SUPPORTABLE AND 
SUSTAINABLE.  TRANSPARENT INTEROPERABILITY MEANS ACQUIRING 
CAPABILITIES NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE WITH THE UNITED 
STATES, COALITION PARTNERS, OUR ARMY AND NAVY, AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. 
 
G. (U) TRANSFORMED AEROSPACE CAPABILITIES MEANS EXPLOITING 
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, NEW CONCEPTS OF OPERATIONS AND 
SYNTHETIC, DISTANCE, AND E-LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE EFFECTIVENESS IN OPERATIONS. 
TRANSFORMATION-ENABLING LEADERSHIP MEANS NURTURING COMPETENT, 
EFFECTIVE, AND ETHICAL LEADERSHIP TO EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT 
OPERATIONS AND PREPARE US 
FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
H. (U)  MULTI-SKILLED AND WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE MEANS 
DEVELOPING MULTI-SKILLED PEOPLE TO ENHANCE PERSONNEL 
FLEXIBILITY AND VERSATILITY, AND PROVIDING THESE 
PROFESSIONALS WITH THE EXPERIENCE AND AEROSPACE POWER 
EDUCATION NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY CONDUCT OPERATIONS AND PLAN 
FOR THE FUTURE. 
 
I. (U) ACTIVELY ENGAGING CANADIANS MEANS ACTIVELY REACHING 
AND INFORMING CITIZENS, BUSINESS LEADERS AND OUR POLITICAL 
LEADERSHIP ON HOW THE AIR FORCE 
CONTRIBUTES TO THE SECURITY AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NATION. 
 
J. (U) IMPROVED RESOURCE STEWARDSHIP MEANS CONTINUING TO BE 
INCREASINGLY EFFICIENT WITH THE NATIONAL RESOURCES WITH WHICH 
WE ARE ENTRUSTED. 
 
8. (U) COMPETENCIES AND CAPABILITIES.  WHILE TRANSFORMING, WE 
NEED TO CAPITALIZE ON OUR CORE COMPETENCIES, WHICH ARE THOSE 
AREAS OF INSTITUTIONAL EXPERTISE THAT DESCRIBE WHY WE EXIST. 
THEY ARE: 
 
A. (U)  DEVELOPING PROFESSIONAL AIRMEN (A DND/CF APPROVED 
TERM THAT WE USE TO DESCRIBE THE COLLECTIVE OF OUR PERSONNEL); 
 
B. (U) GENERATING RELEVANT AEROSPACE POWER CAPABILITIES FOR 
THE CANADIAN FORCES; AND 
 
C. (U) EFFECTIVELY APPLYING JOINT AEROSPACE POWER TO MEET 
MILITARY OR NATIONAL OBJECTIVES. 
 
D. (U) CAPABILITIES ARE THOSE ABILITIES THAT ALLOW THE AIR 
FORCE TO GET THE JOB DONE. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE MORE FULLY 
DESCRIBED IN THE AEROSPACE CAPABILITY FRAMEWORK. FUNDAMENTAL 
CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS AEROSPACE CONTROL, ARE ESSENTIAL FOR 
CONTROLLING AEROSPACE AND ENABLING JOINT MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
CONTRIBUTING CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS COUNTER-LAND OPERATIONS 
AND MARITIME SURFACE AND SUB-SURFACE SURVEILLANCE AND 
CONTROL, ALLOW FOR ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE OPERATIONS 
OF THE ARMY AND NAVY, AND OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. 
ENABLING CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS AIR MOBILITY, AND 
INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE, ARE ESSENTIAL 
TO MANY CANADIAN FORCES OPERATIONS. SUPPORT CAPABILITIES, 
SUCH AS AIR MAINTENANCE AND LOGISTICS, ARE ESSENTIAL TO 
SUPPORT AND SUSTAIN AIR FORCE OPERATIONS. 
 
9. (U)  COMBAT-CAPABLE AND MULTI-PURPOSE FORCES. 
COMBAT-CAPABLE, MULTI-PURPOSE FORCES PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY 
AND FREEDOM OF ACTION TO RESPOND TO A RANGE 
OF CHALLENGES ACROSS A SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY AND CONFLICT. 
THESE CHALLENGES CAN, AND HAVE INCLUDED HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE, DISASTER RELIEF, SEARCH AND RESCUE, PEACEKEEPING, 
PEACE ENFORCEMENT, AND COMBAT. THESE TYPES OF FORCES WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT IN A VOLATILE AND UNCERTAIN SECURITY 
ENVIRONMENT. 
10. (U) IDENTIFYING THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED BY OUR VISION. 
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE CAPABILITIES REQUIRED BY OUR VISION 
WHICH: 
 
A. (U) EMPHASIZE HOMELAND SECURITY, 
 
B. (U) ANTICIPATE THE CONTINUATION, AND POTENTIAL 
STRENGTHENING, OF CANADA-UNITED STATES COOPERATION ON NORTH 
AMERICAN SECURITY, AND 
 
C. (U) ANTICIPATE THE CONTINUATION OF CANADA\'S 
ENGAGED-INTERNATIONALISM. 
 
11. (U)  TO ENHANCE HOMELAND SECURITY CANADA NEEDS IMPROVED 
AIRSPACE SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL CAPABILITIES TO EFFECTIVELY 
DETECT AND ACTIVELY RESPOND TO UNWANTED AND UNAUTHORIZED 
ACTIVITY, EITHER APPROACHING OR OPERATING, WITHIN OUR 
NATIONAL AIRSPACE. THESE CAPABILITIES ARE NEEDED TO BETTER 
PROTECT 
CANADIAN CITIES, CANADIAN CITIZENS AND CANADA\'S CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
12. (U) ALSO NEEDED ARE CAPABILITIES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL OF CANADA\'S MARITIME APPROACHES. TO 
ADD FLEXIBILITY, THESE CAPABILITIES SHOULD ALSO BE CAPABLE OF 
OVERLAND SURVEILLANCE. TO EFFECTIVELY AID PEOPLE IN DISTRESS 
FROM SUCH THINGS AS MARINE INCIDENTS AND AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS, 
WE NEED TO IMPROVE ELEMENTS OF OUR DOMESTIC SEARCH AND RESCUE 
CAPABILITY. FINALLY, THE CANADIAN FORCES NEEDS CAPABILITIES 
WITH THE SPEED, RANGE, AND CAPACITY 
NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY AND RESPONSIVELY CARRY PEOPLE, CARGO 
AND EQUIPMENT, WHEN AND WHERE NEEDED ACROSS CANADA. 
 
13. (U)  TO CONTINUE, AND POTENTIALLY STRENGTHEN, 
CANADA-UNITED STATES COOPERATION ON NORTH AMERICAN SECURITY 
CANADA NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT OUR AEROSPACE AND MARITIME 
SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL CAPABILITIES ARE INTEROPERABLE WITH 
UNITED STATES CAPABILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN COMMAND AND 
CONTROL, COMMUNICATION, DATA SHARING, SURVEILLANCE, WARNING, 
AND ACTIVE CONTROL OF AEROSPACE AND MARITIME AREAS. 
 
14. (U) TO CONTINUE CANADA\'S ENGAGED-INTERNATIONALISM CANADA 
WILL REQUIRE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THREATS AGAINST 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY. TO DO THIS AND TO EXERCISE 
AN INDEPENDENT AND DISTINCTIVE CANADIAN VOICE IN CONTRIBUTING 
INTERNATIONALLY, EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITIES ARE NEEDED THAT 
PERMIT THE AIR FORCE TO OPERATE FAR ABROAD WITH JOINT, 
ALLIED, OR COALITION 
PARTNERS. TO CONFRONT THREATS AT THEIR SOURCE, WE NEED TO BE 
ABLE TO SWIFTLY PROJECT AND APPLY FORCE WITH PRECISION FROM 
THE AIR. TO DO THIS EFFECTIVELY, WE NEED AN ABILITY TO 
PROJECT DOMESTIC AEROSPACE CONTROL CAPABILITIES ABROAD TO 
PROTECT FRIENDLY MILITARY FORCES AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE 
FREEDOM OF ACTION NEEDED TO EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISH THEIR 
MISSIONS.  EFFECTIVE MISSION ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THE FUTURE 
WILL DEPEND ON HAVING INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND 
RECONNAISSANCE CAPABILITIES THAT CAN DETECT AND TRACK TARGETS 
IN THE AIR, ON THE SURFACE, AND UNDERWATER. WE ALSO NEED 
AEROSPACE CAPABILITIES THAT DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
OPERATIONS OF CANADA\'S ARMY AND NAVY AND AIRLIFT CAPABILITIES 
TO MOVE CANADIAN FORCES PERSONNEL, EQUIPMENT, AND SUPPLIES 
TO, FROM, AND WITHIN AREAS OF OPERATION WHEN AND WHERE NEEDED. 
 
15. (U) ADVANCING TRANSFORMATION.  TRANSFORMATION WILL 
REQUIRE APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT IN NEW CAPABILITIES AND, 
POTENTIALLY, THE ELIMINATION OR REFOCUSING OF OTHERS. IT WILL 
REQUIRE CHANGES TO AIR FORCE STRUCTURE, CULTURE, AND 
OPERATIONS. WHILE THIS STRATEGIC REORIENTATION WILL NOT BE 
EASY, IT IS ESSENTIAL. EACH NEW CAPABILITY HAS RESOURCE 
IMPLICATIONS, BOTH HUMAN AND FINANCIAL, THAT WILL NEED TO BE 
ADDRESSED AS TRANSFORMATION IS EFFECTED.  AIR FORCE 
TRANSFORMATION WILL REQUIRE A COMBINATION OF REPRIORITIZATION, 
REALLOCATION, AND THE INFUSION OF NEW RESOURCES. THE AIR 
FORCE IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO MAKE THE MOST 
EFFICIENT USE OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ENTRUSTED TO IT. TO 
BEGIN TRANSFORMATION, THE AIR FORCE IS COMMITTED TO FINDING 
RESOURCES THROUGH REPRIORITIZATION AND REALLOCATION. WHILE 
SUCH MEASURES WILL BE TOUGH, THEY ARE OF FUNDAMENTAL 
IMPORTANCE. WHERE THESE MEASURES MAY BE INSUFFICIENT, THE AIR 
FORCE WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. 
16. (U)  SUCCESSFUL TRANSFORMATION.  THE SUCCESSFUL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS VISION WILL RESULT IN AN AEROSPACE 
FORCE THAT IS TRANSFORMED IN ITS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY 
CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELAND SECURITY, NORTH AMERICAN DEFENCE AND 
GLOBAL STABILITY. AS A MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE CANADIAN FORCES, 
THIS AEROSPACE 
FORCE WILL BE A VITAL NATIONAL SECURITY INSTITUTION, A USEFUL 
INSTRUMENT OF NATIONAL POLICY AND AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF 
NATIONAL POWER.  THE DEDICATED MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS FORCE 
WILL EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE SECURITY OF CANADIANS AND 
THE PROTECTION OF CANADIAN NATIONAL INTERESTS WELL INTO THE 
21ST CENTURY. ((END SUMMARY)). 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS.  INCREDIBLY THIS AIR 
FORCE VISION WAS RELEASED BEFORE THE LAST ELECTION, OVER SIX 
MONTHS AHEAD OF THE DEFENCE REVIEW, AND WAS LITTLE INFORMED 
BY THAT DOCUMENT WHICH IS STILL BEING REVISED.  WHILE THE AIR 
FORCE VISION IS STRONGLY ADAPTED FROM U.S. AND ROYAL AIR 
FORCE TRANSFORMATION VISIONS AND DOCTRINE, IT IS LIKELY TO 
RECEIVE PRECIOUS FEW OF THE RESOURCES IT ENVISIONS TO BECOME 
A TOTAL AIR FORCE. 
 
2.  (C/NF)  THE VISION WAS WORKED ON FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND 
RESULTED IN A SERIES OF GLOSSY BROCHURES WHICH WERE DESIGNED 
TO BUILD PUBLIC AND DEFENSE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE AIR 
FORCE AND ITS REQUIREMENTS.  THE AIR FORCE IS PAYING A HEAVY 
PRICE FOR BEING PROACTIVE AT THE END OF THE COLD WAR, CUTTING 
ITS FORCE STRUCTURE DRAMATICALLY ON ITS OWN WHILE THE OTHER 
SERVICES MADE FEWER CHANGES.  AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SERVICE 
(ENVIRONMENT) THE AIR FORCE IS ALWAYS UP AGAINST RESOURCE 
LIMITS AND HAS FURTHER ERODED ITS RESOURCES BY THE 
REQUIREMENT TO POUR VAST AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO LEGACY SYSTEMS 
WHICH ARE ALMOST TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE THAN 
MODERN ONES. 
 
3. (C/NF) WHILE THE FUNDAMENTAL THRUST OF THE TRANSFORMATION 
VISION IS EXCELLENT AND ALIGNS NICELY WITH WHAT THE ROYAL AIR 
FORCE AND U.S. AIR FORCE ARE DOING IN TERMS OF CAPABILITY AND 
DOCTRINE, IT REALLY PRESENTS A FANTASY WITH ALMOST NO CHANCE 
OF BEING FULFILLED GIVEN CURRENT BUDGETS.  A DECLINING NUMBER 
OF AGEING FIGHTERS COUPLED WITH INCREASED NORAD COMMITMENTS 
POST-9/11 HAVE STRETCHED THE FIGHTER FORCE.  WHILE THEY ARE 
BEING MODERNIZED, CANADIAN CF-18S STILL FALL SHORT IN 
USABILITY WITH NO ALL-WEATHER PRECISION-GUIDED MUNITION (PGM) 
CAPABILITY AND NO MULTI-SENSOR RECONNAISSANCE OR BDA 
CAPABILITY; AND IN DEPLOYABILITY WITH A DECLINING NUMBER, 
HOMELAND COMMITMENTS, AND LIMITED SUPPORT AIRCRAFT.  TACTICAL 
UAV\'S ACQUIRED FOR AFGHANISTAN NEED TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE 
CANADIAN FORCES, AND A PREDATOR B SOLUTION IS YEARS AWAY. 
MARITIME PATROL AIRCRAFT (MPA) AVAILABILITY IS LOW BECAUSE OF 
MODERNIZATION EFFORTS AND THE TRANSPORT CAPABILITY OF THE 
CANADIAN AIR FORCE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO ALL. WITH ANCIENT 
C-130S  MISSION CAPABLE ONLY 20 PERCENT OF THE TIME, ALL 
AIRLIFT CAPABILITY IS USED TO SUPPORT INTERNAL MUST-SUPPORT 
MISSIONS IN CANADA AND THEATER AIRLIFT ABROAD.  THERE IS ZERO 
EXCESS CAPACITY AND MANY AIRLIFT SUPPORT MISSIONS ARE NOW 
BEING FLOWN BY LEASED OR CONTRACT AIRCRAFT (AT VERY HIGH COST 
PER FLIGHT HOUR). 
 
4. (C/NF) WHILE THE DEFENCE REVIEW UNDERWAY MAY CALL FOR A 
STRATEGIC AIRLIFT SOLUTION IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GET THE 
RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CHIEF OF THE LAND STAFF IS NOT 
ACTIVELY SUPPORTING A CANADIAN ORGANIC STRATEGIC AIRLIFT 
CAPABILITY IN LIEU OF RENTED TRANSPORT WHICH THE ARMY SAYS 
HAS ALWAYS GOTTEN THE JOB DONE.  THE AIR FORCE WILL ALSO ONLY 
GET A HANDFUL (LESS THAN 50) OF THE 5,000 NEW TROOPS THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAS PROMISED. 
 
5. (C/NF) WHILE CHIEF OF THE AIR FORCE LGEN KEN ((PENNIE)) 
HAS BEEN CALLING HIS AIR FORCE \'FRAGILE\' FOR THE PAST YEAR, 
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT IS DANGEROUSLY NEAR THE BREAKING 
POINT.  THERE ARE TOO MANY AIRBASES WHICH ARE OPEN ONLY FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS; PILOTS ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH HOURS; 
MAINTENANCE TROOPS ARE BEING DRIVEN INTO THE GROUND 
MAINTAINING OLD SYSTEMS; LONG AND FREQUENT DEPLOYMENTS HAVE 
SAPPED MORALE; AND A MAJOR PORTION OF SENIOR MAINTENANCE 
SUPERVISORS ARE SLATED TO RETIRE IN THE COMING TWO YEARS. 
THE NAVY JUST HAD A SUB ACCIDENT WHICH RESULTED IN A FLURRY 
OF INQUIRIES; AN AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR 
RESULT - A HUNT FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME, BUT NO MENTION OF 
FURTHER FUNDING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE VISION SOUNDS GOOD 
BUT UNLESS A LOT OF RESOURCES (2-3 BILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS) 
FOLLOW IT, THE AIR FORCE IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE ON ITS PATH OF 
ATROPHY.

SUMMARY: (U) THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE LAYS OUT FUTURE VECTORS 
TO FOLLOW IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH ITS TRANSFORMATION VISION. 
ENCLOSURE. 
 
TEXT:  1. (C) THIS REPORT SUPPLEMENTS PREVIOUS REPORTING ON 
THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE TRANSFORMATION VISION.  SEE CITED IIR 
FOR SUMMARY OF THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE TRANSFORMATION VISION. 
 
2. (U)  THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE CONTEXT AND STRATEGIC 
DIRECTIONS (VECTORS) THE AIR FORCE HOPES TO TAKE TO 
ACCOMPLISH ITS TRANSFORMATION VISION.  THERE ARE FIVE MISSION 
THEMES AND EIGHT \"STRATEGIC VECTORS\" THE AIR FORCE INTENDS TO 
EMBARK ON TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS.  IN ORDER TO IMPROVE 
READABILITY, FIELD COMMENTS WILL BE INCLUDED AFTER EACH TOPIC. 
 
3. (U)  ((BEGIN SUMMARY)) STRATEGIC VECTORS OUTLINES OUR 
VISION FOR THE FUTURE: TO TRANSFORM THE AIR FORCE FROM A 
PRIMARILY STATIC, PLATFORM-FOCUSED AIR FORCE TO AN 
EXPEDITIONARY, NETWORK-ENABLED, RESULTS-FOCUSED AEROSPACE 
FORCE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY. THE CORE ELEMENT OF THIS 
TRANSFORMATION IS TO ENSURE THE HIGH QUALITY AND JOINT 
RELEVANCE OF CANADA\'S AIR FORCE TEAM BY LEVERAGING THE 
INTELLECTUAL SKILLS OF OUR HIGHLY SKILLED, WELL-EDUCATED, 
PEOPLE.  WE WILL RELY ON IMPROVED OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS AND 
ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE BEST RESULTS FOR CANADIANS. 
THIS STRATEGIC INTENT WILL GUIDE ALL OTHER AIR FORCE PLANNING 
DOCUMENTS. 
 
4. (U) ALTHOUGH THIS TRANSITION WILL TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT, 
THE AIR FORCE LEADERSHIP IS COMMITTED TO THIS LONG-TERM GOAL. 
APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW CAPABILITIES 
AND, POTENTIALLY, THE ELIMINATION OR REFOCUSING OF OTHERS 
WILL BE REQUIRED. WE ARE COMMITTED TO FINDING THE NECESSARY 
RESOURCES THROUGH REPRIORITIZATION AND REALLOCATION. WHILE 
SUCH MEASURES WILL BE TOUGH, THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. WHERE THESE 
STEPS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE, WE WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. 
 TRANSFORMING THE AIR FORCE WILL NOT BE EASY; SIGNIFICANT 
ELEMENTS OF OUR STRUCTURE, CULTURE AND OPERATIONS MUST 
CHANGE. BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE PROFESSIONAL MEN AND 
WOMEN OF THE AIR FORCE ARE UP TO THIS TASK. CANADIANS EXPECT 
AND DESERVE NO LESS. (FIELD COMMENT: THE MOST DIFFICULT 
ASPECT OF COMPLETING THE TRANSFORMATION WILL BE GETTING THE 
GOVERNMENT TO ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES.  SEEKING THE RESOURCES 
IN CANADA IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN FINDING THEM.  MOST OF THE 
POTENTIAL SAVINGS FROM REPRIORITIZATION AND REALLOCATION HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN HARVESTED.  THIS SECTION CLEARLY OPENS THE DOOR 
TO CANADA RELINQUISHING OR DRAMATICALLY DOWNSIZING 
CAPABILITIES IT CAN NO LONGER AFFORD.) 
5. (U) CANADIAN FORCES BACKGROUND.  THE CANADIAN FORCES IS 
COMPRISED OF THREE COMMANDS: MARITIME, LAND FORCE AND AIR 
COMMAND. THEY ARE COLLECTIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ORGANIZING, 
EQUIPPING AND TRAINING 
CANADIAN MILITARY FORCES EMPLOYED ON OPERATIONS. WHILE THE 
CANADIAN FORCES REMAINS A UNIFIED FORCE, AND BY LAW IS ONLY 
ONE SERVICE, IT HAS BECOME COMMON PRACTICE TO REFER TO THE 
THREE COMMANDS AS THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE AND TO DISCUSS 
THEM AS IF THEY WERE SEPARATE SERVICES.  THE ARMY, NAVY AND 
AIR FORCE HAVE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT CULTURES AND TRADITIONS, 
AND THEY UNDERTAKE IDENTIFIABLY DISTINCT OPERATIONAL 
ACTIVITIES.  EACH SERVICE MAINTAINS DISTINCTIVE CAPABILITIES 
TO UNDERTAKE THEIR ACTIVITIES, BUT ALL 
THREE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY IN JOINTLY DEFENDING 
OUR COUNTRY AND PROTECTING CANADIAN SECURITY INTERESTS. 
TOGETHER, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO A FORCE THAT IS GREATER THAN THE 
SUM OF ITS PARTS. 
 
6. (U) ONE AIR FORCE.  THE LAND AND NAVAL FORCES OF SOME 
COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR OWN AIR AND AVIATION ASSETS, BUT 
CANADA\'S ARMY AND NAVY DO NOT. THEY RELY ON THE AIR FORCE TO 
PROVIDE SUCH ASSETS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR OPERATIONS. FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE AIR FORCE PROVIDES AIRCRAFT FOR SOVEREIGNTY 
PATROLS WITHIN CANADA\'S MARITIME AREAS AND OVER ITS NORTHERN 
TERRITORY. 
IT ALSO PROVIDES HELICOPTERS TO EMBARK ON NAVY SHIPS AND TO 
DEPLOY WITH ARMY UNITS.  AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC PLANNING, 
THE AIR FORCE WILL ENSURE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF LAND AND MARITIME COMMANDERS. IT WILL ALSO 
PURSUE IMPROVED INTEROPERABILITY, AND EXPLORE NEW METHODS OF 
JOINT OPERATIONS WITH THE NAVY AND ARMY.  (FIELD COMMENT: 
THE FACT THE AIR FORCE SUPPORTS ARMY AND NAVY AVIATION 
REQUIREMENTS IS ASSUMED AND NOT VERY WELL RESPECTED BY THE 
NAVY AND ARMY.  THEY GIVE LITTLE SUPPORT TO RECAPITALIZING 
THE AIR FORCE ASSETS WHICH SUPPORT THEM AND ACTIVELY COMPETE 
FOR THE DOLLARS THAT SUPPORT AIR FORCE ARMY/NAVY SUPPRT 
AIRCRAFT, ADVOCATING EXPENDITURES ON NAVY SHIPS AND ARMY 
MODERNIZATION OVER SUPPORT AIRCRAFT.) 
 
7. (U) VISION.  TO REMAIN A RELEVANT INSTRUMENT OF NATIONAL 
POLICY, THE AIR FORCE MUST BE CAPABLE OF CONTRIBUTING 
EFFECTIVELY TO THE SECURITY OF CANADIANS AND THE PROTECTION 
OF CANADIAN SECURITY INTERESTS WELL INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. TO 
DO THIS, THE AIR FORCE WILL MOVE FROM A PRIMARILY STATIC, 
PLATFORM-FOCUSED AIR FORCE TO AN EXPEDITIONARY, 
NETWORK-ENABLED, 
CAPABILITY-BASED AND RESULTS-FOCUSED AEROSPACE FORCE. IN 
BECOMING THIS FORCE, WE INTEND TO BUILD ON THE 
CHARACTERISTICS, DESCRIBED IN THE MISSION STATEMENT BELOW, 
THAT HAVE ENABLED THE AIR FORCE TO EFFECTIVELY DISCHARGE ITS 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MANY DECADES. 
 
8. (U) AEROSPACE FORCE TRANSFORMATION.  TRANSFORMING THE AIR 
FORCE OVER THE LONGER-TERM INTO AN AEROSPACE FORCE MEANS 
BECOMING RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING CANADIAN FORCES PERSONNEL 
WITH THE SPACE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING REQUISITE TO 
EFFECTIVE CANADIAN FORCES OPERATIONS.  THE AIR FORCE WILL 
EMBRACE THIS BROADER RESPONSIBILITY AND INCORPORATE THIS 
KNOWLEDGE, GAINED FROM ITS LONG-STANDING INVOLVEMENT IN U.S. 
SPACE-RELATED ACTIVITIES, INTO AIR FORCE OCCUPATIONS, 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, DOCTRINE AND OPERATIONS. 
 
9. (U) AN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.  EXPEDITIONARY OPERATIONS ARE 
THOSE THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN AWAY FROM WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR 
ROUTINE TRAINING AT HOME INSTALLATIONS. THEY INVOLVE 
OPERATIONS UNDERTAKEN THROUGHOUT CANADA\'S VAST TERRITORY AND 
MARITIME AREAS. THEY ALSO INVOLVE OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OUR 
NATIONAL BORDERS, WHETHER WITHIN NORTH AMERICA OR FURTHER 
ABROAD.   RECENT OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE HAS REINFORCED THE 
NEED FOR THE AIR FORCE TO DEPLOY TO MEET OUR NATIONAL, 
CONTINENTAL AND GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS DEPLOYMENT 
CAPABILITY NEEDS TO BE SYSTEMATIC AND SUSTAINABLE. (FIELD 
COMMENT:  CANADA HAS THE CAPABILITY TO DEPLOY ONE \"SIX-PACK\" 
OF F/A-18\'S, INCLUDING REQUIRED SUSTAINMENT AND SUPPORT 
EQUIPMENT). 
 
10. (U) FUTURE NETWORK-ENABLED AEROSPACE FORCE. 
NETWORK-ENABLED OPERATIONS ARE THOSE THAT EMBODY MANY 
CONCEPTS OF THE INFORMATION AGE TO INCREASE COMBAT POWER AND 
MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS. THEY INVOLVE NEW WAYS OF THINKING 
ABOUT HOW WE ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSIONS AND THEY EMPLOY ROBUST 
NETWORKED FORCES TO IMPROVE INFORMATION SHARING, AND ENHANCE 
THE QUALITY OF INFORMATION AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. THIS 
ENABLES IMPROVED COLLABORATION, SYNCHRONIZATION AND SPEED OF 
COMMAND THAT, IN TURN, DRAMATICALLY INCREASES MISSION 
EFFECTIVENESS.  THE AIR FORCE CURRENTLY EMPLOYS AIRCRAFT 
INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT TO 
ACCOMPLISH OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES. WHILE ADVANCED-TECHNOLOGY 
BASED PLATFORMS WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
THE FUTURE, THEY WILL NEED TO BE INCREASINGLY NETWORKED WITH 
A GREATER NUMBER AND TYPE OF PLATFORMS, SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE 
FOR SUCCESS IN OPERATIONS. THIS WILL INVOLVE CONNECTING 
SENSORS, OPERATORS AND DECISION-MAKERS WITH NETWORKS TO 
COMMUNICATE AND SHARE QUALITY DATA FOR EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY 
DECISION-MAKING AND SUCCESS IN OPERATIONS. THIS CONNECTIVITY 
IS THE ESSENCE OF A NETWORK-ENABLED FORCE.  NETWORK-ENABLED 
FORCES WILL NEED TO OPERATE SIMULTANEOUSLY IN SEVERAL 
DOMAINS.  (FIELD COMMENT:  CANADA HAS CHOSEN \"NETWORK-ENABLED 
OPERATIONS\" VICE NET-CENTRIC OPERATIONS\" AS THEIR MANTRA FOR 
IMPROVING C4ISR IN OPERATIONS.  CANADIANS FEEL THAT THE 
NETWORK IS NOT THE CENTER OF THE OPERATION, MERELY A 
FACILITATOR AND THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON GETTING THE INFORMATION 
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE, VICE FOCUSING ON THE INFORMATION 
ITSELF.) 
 
11. (U) CAPABILITY-BASED AND RESULTS-FOCUSED.  THE AIR FORCE 
HAS ADOPTED CAPABILITY-BASED PLANNING AS THE MEANS BY WHICH 
AEROSPACE CAPABILITIES ARE ACQUIRED AND MAINTAINED.  THE TERM 
CAPABILITY IS USED TO REFER TO OUR ABILITIES TO DO THINGS AS 
AN AIR FORCE. OUR CORE COMPETENCIES ARE: 
 
A. (U) DEVELOPING PROFESSIONAL \'AIRMEN\'; 
 
B. (U) GENERATING RELEVANT AEROSPACE POWER CAPABILITIES; AND 
 
C. (U) APPLYING EFFECTIVE JOINT AEROSPACE POWER. AT AN AIR 
FORCE LEVEL, WE UNDERTAKE OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY WITH 
FUNDAMENTAL, CONTRIBUTING, ENABLING AND SUPPORT CAPABILITIES. 
FUNDAMENTAL CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS AEROSPACE CONTROL, ARE 
ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTROL OF AEROSPACE AND AS ENABLERS FOR 
SUCCESS IN JOINT MILITARY OPERATIONS.  CONTRIBUTING 
CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS MARITIME ANTI-SURFACE WARFARE AND 
AIR-TO-SURFACE SURVEILLANCE, MAKE ESSENTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
THE OPERATIONS OF OTHER SERVICES AND GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS. 
ENABLING CAPABILITIES SUCH AS AIR MOBILITY AND INTELLIGENCE, 
SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE, ARE ESSENTIAL ENABLERS FOR 
MANY OPERATIONS OF THE ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE. 
 
12. (U) MISSION THEME ONE: COMBAT CAPABILITY.  THE FIRST 
MISSION THEME IS TO BE COMBAT-CAPABLE FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. 
AS STATED EARLIER, THE FUNDAMENTAL AND MOST DEMANDING ROLE 
FOR THE AIR FORCE IS TO GENERATE, APPLY AND SUSTAIN AEROSPACE 
POWER IN COMBAT OPERATIONS - DOMESTICALLY IN DEFENCE OF THE 
NATION OR ABROAD ALONGSIDE ALLIES OR COALITION PARTNERS. THIS 
REQUIRES COMBAT CAPABLE FORCES THAT ARE EQUIPPED, TRAINED AND 
READY TO CARRY OUT DEMANDING MISSIONS AGAINST HIGHLY CAPABLE 
ADVERSARIES.  WHILE AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED FOR 
COMBAT CAN GENERALLY BE USED TO EXECUTE 
PEACETIME ROLES, AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED FOR PURELY 
PEACETIME ROLES OFTEN HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, VALUE IN COMBAT. 
COMBAT-CAPABILITY, THEREFORE, SHOULD FORM THE BASIS OF OTHER 
CAPABILITIES. AIRCRAFT AND OTHER SYSTEMS MUST BE EQUIPPED FOR 
THEIR ANTICIPATED OPERATING ROLES AND AIRCREW TRAINED TO 
OPERATE DURING THE DAY, AT NIGHT, IN A VARIETY OF WEATHER AND 
AGAINST INTEGRATED THREAT SYSTEMS.  FUTURE COMBAT 
CAPABILITIES WILL REQUIRE INCREASINGLY AGILE, PRECISE, LETHAL 
AND SURVIVABLE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. SUFFICIENT NUMBERS 
OF PEOPLE, AIRCRAFT, STOCKPILES OF 
AMMUNITION AND OTHER CONSUMABLES MUST BE ACQUIRED TO SUSTAIN 
COMBAT OPERATIONS ONCE ENGAGED. SINCE COMBAT SKILLS ARE 
PERISHABLE, THEY MUST BE PRACTICED REGULARLY. 
13. (U) MISSION THEME TWO:  MEANINGFUL AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES 
RELEVANT FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. TO BE RELEVANT, THE AIR FORCE 
NEEDS MILITARILY MEANINGFUL AND SUSTAINABLE FORCES CAPABLE OF 
BEING EMPLOYED ACROSS A SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY AND CONFLICT. 
HAVING MILITARILY MEANINGFUL FORCES MEANS BEING APPROPRIATELY 
EQUIPPED, TRAINED AND READY TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIVE MILITARY 
CONTRIBUTION TO A COALITION EFFORT OR DOMESTIC SECURITY TASK 
AND NOT SIMPLY ONE THAT IS SYMBOLIC. HAVING SUSTAINABLE 
FORCES MEANS HAVING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PERSONNEL, 
AEROSPACE PLATFORMS AND SYSTEMS, EQUIPMENT, WEAPONS, 
MATERIEL, INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSUMABLES TO MAINTAIN 
CAPABILITY AND SUSTAIN OPERATIONS OVER TIME WHETHER AT HOME 
OR WHILE DEPLOYED ABROAD.  COMBAT-CAPABLE, MULTIPURPOSE 
FORCES AND AEROSPACE PLATFORMS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF BEING USED 
FOR MORE THAN ONE PURPOSE PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY NECESSARY 
TO BE CAPABLE OF BEING EMPLOYED ACROSS A SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY 
AND CONFLICT. 
 
14. (U) MISSION THEME THREE: RAPID RESPONSE -- TO BE 
RESPONSIVE FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. RESPONSIVENESS IN MILITARY 
OPERATIONS IS AMONG THE STRENGTHS OF AIR FORCES AND IT STEMS 
FROM READINESS AND SPEED. READINESS REFERS TO THE PROFICIENCY 
AND PREPAREDNESS REQUIRED TO DEPLOY FORCES IN A TIMELY MANNER 
AND TO EMPLOY THEM EFFECTIVELY IN OPERATIONS. THE READINESS 
OF SOME AEROSPACE FORCES MUST BE KEPT HIGH TO CAPITALIZE ON 
THE FUNDAMENTAL SPEED ADVANTAGE OF AEROSPACE POWER PLATFORMS. 
THIS SPEED CONFERS AN ADVANTAGE OVER SURFACE-BASED PLATFORMS 
SUCH AS SHIPS AND VEHICLES. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH READINESS 
AND SPEED ALLOWS THE AIR FORCE TO RESPOND RAPIDLY WHEN AND 
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES IT HAS A NEED TO SEND MILITARY 
FORCES.  (FIELD COMMENT:  BAGOTVILLE, C-130 READINESS) 
 
15. (U) MISSION THEME FOUR: EXPEDITIONARY REACH AND POWER -- 
TO BECOME \'EXPEDITIONARY\' FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS.  THIS MEANS 
HAVING SUSTAINABLE REACH AND POWER APPROPRIATE TO NATIONAL 
AND GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THE AIR FORCE IS TASKED WITH 
NATIONAL, CONTINENTAL AND GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES. 
DURING THE COLD WAR, CANADA\'S AIR FORCE GREW TO BECOME 
ACCUSTOMED TO STATIC OPERATIONS FROM ESTABLISHED BASES. THE 
VOLATILE POST-COLD WAR ENVIRONMENT HAS PLACED A PREMIUM ON 
BEING FULLY DEPLOYABLE, OFTEN AT SHORT NOTICE, TO LOCATIONS 
FAR FROM HOME.  THE AIR FORCE MUST NOW BE CAPABLE OF 
DEPLOYING, BEING EMPLOYED, SUSTAINED AND RE-DEPLOYING FROM 
LOCATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE UNPREPARED, AROUND THE 
GLOBE. HAVING REACH APPROPRIATE TO GLOBAL INTERESTS MEANS 
HAVING THE ABILITY TO MOVE EQUIPMENT, SUPPLIES AND PERSONNEL 
TO, FROM, BETWEEN AND WITHIN THEATRES OF OPERATION. MOVEMENT 
BY AIR IS NORMALLY THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS OPTION, ESPECIALLY 
WHEN LONG DISTANCES ARE INVOLVED - WHETHER OVERSEAS OR WITHIN 
CANADA. HAVING REACH ALSO MEANS BEING ABLE TO DEPLOY AND 
SUSTAIN FORCES IN OPERATIONS WHEREVER THE GOVERNMENT SENDS 
US, DOMESTICALLY OR ABROAD. 
 
16. (U) MISSION THEME FIVE:  INTEROPERABLE AND NETWORKED 
FORCES.  THE FIFTH MISSION THEME IS TO BE INTEROPERABLE AND 
\'NETWORKED\' FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. 
WHILE AIR FORCES CAN BE EMPLOYED ON INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS, 
THERE ARE FEW FUTURE SITUATIONS ENVISAGED WHERE CANADA\'S AIR 
FORCE WOULD OPERATE ALONE. WITHIN NORTH AMERICA, OUR AIR 
FORCE WILL NEED TO BE INTEROPERABLE WITH THE UNITED STATES 
AIR FORCE. DOMESTICALLY, JOINT AND INTER-AGENCY OPERATIONS 
WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF 
CANADA AND ITS PEOPLE. SUCCESS IN FUTURE OPERATIONS WILL 
DEPEND ON BEING NETWORKED WITH MANY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS, 
SYSTEMS AND PLATFORMS THROUGH DATA-LINKS, SECURE AND 
NON-SECURE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND COMBAT IDENTIFICATION, 
AIRSPACE CONTROL, AND AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. 
ABROAD, WE WILL NEED TO BE INTEROPERABLE WITH COALITION 
FORCES - ONES THAT WILL OFTEN BE LED BY THE UNITED STATES AND 
GENERALLY BE COMPRISED OF ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE 
FORMATIONS. EQUIPMENT, DOCTRINE AND PLANNING MUST TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT INTEROPERABILITY REQUIREMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
AND THOSE OF OTHER COALITION PARTNERS. 
 
17. (U) PEOPLE - OUR FOUNDATION AND FUTURE.  THE SUCCESSFUL 
EXECUTION OF AEROSPACE OPERATIONS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE 
DEPENDS ON EFFECTIVE COMMAND AND LEADERSHIP. 
18. (U) VECTOR 1 - RESULTS-FOCUSED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. 
ACHIEVING EFFECTIVE RESULTS FOR CANADA AND ITS PEOPLE IS OUR 
TOP PRIORITY. WE WILL 
EMPHASIZE RESULTS THROUGH DOMESTIC MISSIONS THAT PROTECT 
SOVEREIGNTY, PROTECT CANADIANS, PROTECT CANADIAN RESOURCES 
AND DEFEND CANADA. WE WILL EMPHASIZE RESULTS ABROAD THAT 
PROTECT CANADIAN SECURITY INTERESTS THROUGH OPERATIONS OTHER 
THAN WAR AND DEFEND CANADIAN SECURITY INTERESTS THROUGH 
COMBAT OPERATIONS.  TO ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS, WE WILL: 
 
A. (U)  ACTIVELY PURSUE THE ACQUISITION OF AEROSPACE 
SURVEILLANCE CAPABILITIES CAPABLE OF MONITORING, DETECTING, 
AND IDENTIFYING UNAUTHORIZED AND UNWANTED ACTIVITY IN, AND 
APPROACHING, CANADA\'S AIRSPACE AND MARITIME AREAS. 
 
B. (U) WE WILL ALSO ACTIVELY PURSUE THE ACQUISITION OF ACTIVE 
CONTROL CAPABILITIES AGILE ENOUGH TO DETECT AND ACTIVELY 
RESPOND TO A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL THREATS, INCLUDING 
CRUISE MISSILES. 
 
C. (U) WE WILL EXPLORE NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE NAVY SO 
AEROSPACE CONTROL AND MARITIME SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL ARE 
EXECUTED JOINTLY WITHIN CANADA. 
 
D. (U) WE WILL ENTER INTO EARLY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ARMY AND 
NAVY ON AEROSPACE POWER CAPABILITIES THAT COULD MORE 
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS. 
 
E. (U) WE WILL IDENTIFY AND APPLY LESSONS FROM THE RECENT USE 
OF AEROSPACE POWER WORLDWIDE AND ACQUIRE INCREASINGLY PRECISE 
TARGETING, WEAPONS AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS TO ACHIEVE EFFECTS 
WHILE MINIMIZING CASUALTIES AND COLLATERAL DAMAGE TO MORE 
EFFECTIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO COALITION OPERATIONS. 
 
F. (U) WE WILL ALSO APPLY LESSONS THAT HAVE CONFIRMED THE 
NEED TO MOVE TO INCREASINGLY NETWORK-ENABLED AND 
EFFECTS-BASED OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR TIMESENSITIVE 
TARGETING TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN ALL 
OF OUR OPERATIONS. 
 
G. (U) WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OPERATIONS OF 
OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS FOR SUCH THINGS AS EMERGENCY AND 
DISASTER RELIEF, ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE. WE WILL ALSO EXPLORE MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS OF 
CONDUCTING AIR MOBILITY OPERATIONS AND DOMESTIC SEARCH AND 
RESCUE. 
 
19. (U) VECTOR TWO - RESPONSIVE EXPEDITIONARY CAPABILITY. 
THE AIR FORCE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RESPONDING TO CHALLENGES 
AT HOME AND ABROAD IN 
THE PAST, BUT TO DO SO MORE EFFICIENTLY, IT WILL NEED TO 
TRANSFORM INTO AN EXPEDITIONARY AIR FORCE. THE AIR FORCE WILL 
CREATE TACTICAL SELF SUFFICIENT UNITS OF AEROSPACE 
CAPABILITY, CALLED AIR EXPEDITIONARY UNITS. THESE UNITS WILL 
BE DESIGNED WITH INTEGRAL MILITARY AIR MAINTENANCE, COMMAND, 
CONTROL AND SUPPORT ELEMENTS. OUR AIR FORCE SUPPORT 
CAPABILITY WILL BE RE-DESIGNED SO THAT IT BECOMES ALIGNED TO 
THIS REVISED OPERATIONAL FORCE STRUCTURE. BEING AN 
EXPEDITIONARY AIR FORCE ALSO MEANS HAVING THE ABILITY TO 
DEPLOY AND RE-DEPLOY GLOBALLY SO AS TO OPERATE AND SUSTAIN 
FORCES FROM DEPLOYED LOCATIONS WITHIN CANADA AND AROUND THE 
GLOBE, INCLUDING UNPREPARED LOCATIONS.  THE AIR FORCE WILL 
REQUIRE ACCESS TO INTER-THEATRE AIRLIFT, INTRA-THEATRE 
AIRLIFT AND AIR-TO-AIR REFUELLING CAPABILITY THAT WILL MOST 
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY MEET THESE NEEDS AND THE AIRLIFT 
NEEDS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY. THIS EXPEDITIONARY FRAMEWORK WILL 
ENABLE THE AIR FORCE TO SUSTAIN DEPLOYED OPERATIONS BETTER. 
IT WILL ALSO SERVE OUR PEOPLE BETTER BY PROVIDING SOME 
PREDICTABILITY IN THEIR LIVES AND PROVIDE THEM THE MEANS TO 
CLEARLY ARTICULATE WHAT THE AIR FORCE CAN AND CANNOT DO, FROM 
TOP TO BOTTOM. 
 
20. (U) VECTOR THREE - TRANSPARENT INTEROPERABILITY TO 
ACHIEVE TRANSPARENT INTEROPERABILITY, WE WILL NEED TO PURSUE 
SPECIFIC MEASURES. 
 
A. (U)  WE WILL IMPROVE INTEROPERABILITY WITH UNITED STATES 
MILITARY THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LARGE-SCALE COALITION 
\'FLAG\' EXERCISES, COMBINED AIR OPERATIONS CENTRE TRAINING, 
PERSONNEL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, SQUADRON DEPLOYMENTS AND 
DISTRIBUTED MISSION OPERATIONS. OPERATIONAL INTEROPERABILITY 
IN THE FUTURE WILL REQUIRE ABILITIES TO COMMUNICATE SECURELY 
AND WITH SOME DEGREE OF ASSURANCE, TO SHARE INFORMATION AND 
AWARENESS BY DATA-LINK, TO AVOID FRATRICIDE AND, IN THE CASE 
OF OFFENSIVE PLATFORMS, TO BE CAPABLE OF PRECISELYDELIVERING 
AIR-TO-SURFACE MUNITIONS. TO ENABLE THIS INTEROPERABILITY, 
THE AIR FORCE NEEDS TO ACQUIRE SYSTEMS SUCH AS LINK 16, A 
DATA LINK SYSTEM USED BY MANY AIR FORCES WITH WHICH TO SHARE 
DATA AND ENHANCE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. 
 
B. (U) WE WILL ALSO NEED TO ACQUIRE  COMBAT IDENTIFICATION 
SYSTEMS THAT EFFECTIVELY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FRIENDLY AND 
ADVERSARY FORCES. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING INTEROPERABILITY, 
THESE SYSTEMS ARE NECESSARY TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY IN 
NETWORK-ENABLED ENVIRONMENTS. 
 
C. (U) WE WILL EXPLORE NEW TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE 
ARMY AND NAVY, INCLUDING SYNTHETIC ENVIRONMENT TRAINING, TO 
IMPROVE JOINT INTEROPERABILITY. TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL 
INTEROPERABILITY, WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO ENSURE OUR 
COMMAND, CONTROL, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE 
INTEROPERABLE. THE AIR FORCE WILL ALSO IMPROVE 
INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER COALITION PARTNERS.  SINCE 
SECURITY OPERATIONS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON 
INTERAGENCY COOPERATION, EQUIPMENT, DOCTRINE AND PLANNING 
MUST ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT REQUIREMENTS TO WORK WITH OTHER 
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, INTERNATIONAL AID 
AGENCIES AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
21. (U) VECTOR FOUR: TRANSFORMING AEROSPACE CAPABILITIES. 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF AEROSPACE POWER CAPABILITIES WILL 
REQUIRE CHANGES IN CONCEPTS OF OPERATION, CAPABILITIES, 
TRAINING AND DOCTRINE. SUCH TRANSFORMATION WILL LEVERAGE THE 
INTELLECTUAL SKILLS OF OUR PEOPLE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.  A 
CANADIAN FORCES AEROSPACE WARFARE CENTRE WILL BE FORMED TO 
EXPLORE FUTURE JOINT AEROSPACE POWER CONCEPTS AND GUIDE 
EXPERIMENTATION ACTIVITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO TRANSFORMATION. 
THIS CENTRE WILL BECOME A FOCAL POINT AND CENTRE OF AEROSPACE 
OPERATIONS EXCELLENCE IN AREAS SUCH AS SYNTHETIC MISSION 
REHEARSAL, IDENTIFYING AND APPLYING LESSONS FROM ACTUAL 
OPERATIONS, CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTATION, 
AEROSPACE EDUCATION, AND DOCTRINE DEVELOPMENT. TO TRANSFORM 
CAPABILITIES, THE AIR FORCE WILL CONTINUOUSLY EXPLOIT NEW 
TECHNOLOGY TO REALIZE SIGNIFICANT CAPABILITY ENHANCEMENTS. 
TO TRANSFORM TRAINING, THE AIR FORCE WILL CREATE A 
DISTRIBUTED SYNTHETIC ENVIRONMENT FOR FLYING TRAINING AND 
OPERATIONAL MISSION REHEARSAL. THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL ALSO BE 
USED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT, REQUIREMENTS 
DEFINITION, ACQUISITION, AND OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION. 
WHILE THIS CAPABILITY WILL NOT REPLACE FIRST-HAND SPATIAL AND 
TEMPORAL EXPERIENCE SUCH AS FLYING, IT WILL COMPLEMENT 
EXISTING CAPABILITIES SO THAT OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND 
EFFICIENCY ARE ENHANCED. 
 
22. (U) VECTOR FIVE: TRANSFORMATION-ENABLING LEADERSHIP. 
PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE IS AN IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY OF 
THE AIR FORCE. THE AIR FORCE LEADERSHIP HAS EMBRACED THIS 
STEWARDSHIP RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL INCREASE THE LEVEL OF 
EFFORT WITH WHICH IT IS DISCHARGED. WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE 
LONG-TERM TRANSFORMATION GOALS ESTABLISHED IN THIS DOCUMENT 
AND TO ENSURING THE AIR FORCE REMAINS CAPABLE OF EFFECTIVELY 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE SECURITY OF CANADIANS.  AIR FORCE LEADERS 
NEED TO BE PROVIDED WITH A RANGE OF EXPERIENCE AND 
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OVER THEIR CAREER WITH WHICH TO 
ACQUIRE THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF AEROSPACE KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED 
TO EFFECTIVELY DEVELOP AND EMPLOY AEROSPACE POWER ACROSS A 
SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY AND CONFLICT. 
 
23. (U) VECTOR SIX: MULTI-SKILLED AND WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE. 
DURING THE MID-1990S, THE AIR FORCE CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL 
OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES 
TO PRODUCE MULTI-SKILLED PROFESSIONALS. WHILE LESSONS ARE 
STILL BEING IDENTIFIED AND ANALYZED, THE CONCEPT OF HAVING 
MULTI-SKILLED PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER TO PROVIDE PERSONNEL 
FLEXIBILITY IN A CONTEMPORARY, PROFESSIONAL AIR FORCE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE PURSUED AND APPLIED WHERE IT MAKES SENSE.  THE 
AIR FORCE WILL EXPOSE A GREATER NUMBER OF PERSONNEL TO 
OPERATIONS THROUGH ITS EXPEDITIONARY FOCUS AND INCREASE ITS 
EMPHASIS ON AEROSPACE POWER EDUCATION FOR ALL OF ITS 
PERSONNEL. 
 
24. (U) VECTOR SEVEN: ACTIVELY ENGAGING CANADIANS.  THE 
DEPARTMENT\'S STRATEGY IDENTIFIES ENGAGING CANADIANS AS A 
CRITICAL ACTIVITY OF THE FUTURE CANADIAN FORCES. THE AIR 
FORCE DOES MANY THINGS TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR CANADIANS, BUT 
THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT ALWAYS WIDELY PUBLICIZED. THE AIR FORCE 
IS ALREADY BEGINNING TO PRODUCE INFORMATIVE MATERIAL AIMED AT 
EXPLAINING HOW CANADIANS CURRENTLY BENEFIT, OR COULD BENEFIT, 
FROM OPERATIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE AIR FORCE ACROSS ITS 
SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY. 
 
25. (U) VECTOR EIGHT:  IMPROVED RESOURCE STEWARDSHIP. 
TRANSFORMATION TAKES TIME AND REQUIRES RESOURCES. THE COSTS 
OF ALL INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD AND 
PRIORITIZED. AS THE AIR FORCE TRANSFORMS, RESOURCE TRADE-OFFS 
WILL NEED TO BE MADE. A COMBINATION OF THESE MEASURES AND NEW 
RESOURCES WILL ENABLE AIR FORCE TRANSFORMATION. 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS.  THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE 
HAS TAKEN A MAJOR STEP TO TRY TO FORGE THEIR FUTURE, 
PUBLISHING A SERIES OF VISIONARY FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS TO GUIDE 
THEM TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. 
 
2.  (C/NF)  WHILE THE GOALS ARE ADMIRABLE, THE BIG QUESTION 
IS - AS IT ALWAYS IS WITH DEFENSE SPENDING IN CANADA - WHERE 
WILL THE RESOURCES COME FROM?  WITHOUT REDUCING 
INFRASTRUCTURE, RETIRING LEGACY AIRCRAFT, AND MOVING INTO 
NICHE MISSION AREAS, THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE WILL BE UNLIKELY 
TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS.  THE GOAL OF HAVING WORLDWIDE 
DEPLOYABLE, COMBAT-READY, LEADING EDGE FORCES IS VERY 
OPTIMISTIC AND THE BILLS TO PAY ARE HUGE.  PLANNING FOR THE 
RECAPITALIZATION OF THE FIGHTER FORCE NEEDS TO BEGIN IN A FEW 
YEARS.  CANADA DESPERATELY NEEDS UAV\'S FOR MARITIME AND 
ARCTIC SURVEILLANCE MISSIONS SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY. 
THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR A FIXED WING SEARCH AND RESCUE 
(SAR) AIRCRAFT; THEATER AIRLIFT (C-130 CLASS); AND STRATEGIC 
AIRLIFT.  THE ARMY WANTS HEAVY LIFT HELICOPTERS AND THE AIR 
FORCE WANTS TO INVEST HEAVILY IN DISTRIBUTED MISSION 
SIMULATION (DMS) - NOT LEAST BECAUSE THEY CAN SAVE OPERATING 
COSTS AND FATIGUE LIFE ON THEIR AIRCRAFT. 
 
3. (C/NF) STILL, THE FUNDAMENTAL FIRST STEP HAS BEEN TAKEN 
AND THE AIR FORCE HAS PROACTIVELY MADE THEIR CASE BOTH TO THE 
OTHER SERVICES AND TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC AT LARGE. 
HOW WELL THEY CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE VISION WILL 
DEPEND UPON NEW RESOURCES BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THE AIR 
FORCE, POLITICAL WILL TO EXECUTE THE PLAN, AND STAYING POWER 
OF THE AIR FORCE ON THE TASK.

SUMMARY: (U) SECOND PHASE OF THE CANADIAN F/A-18 
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM FUNDED.  F/A-18 FATIGUE LIFE 
MICRO-MANAGED TO STRETCH FLEET UNTIL 2017-2020.  MANY DOUBT 
CANADA HAS ENOUGH FIGHTERS. 
 
TEXT:  1. (U)  IN OCTOBER 2004, THE TREASURY BOARD OF CANADA 
APPROVED THE SECOND PHASE OF A CDN$2.6 BILLION PROGRAM TO 
RETROFIT CANADA\'S AGEING 1980\'S F/A-18A/B AIRCRAFT.  OF THE 
ORIGINAL 138 AIRCRAFT ONLY 80 WILL BE FULLY MODERNIZED TO A 
STANDARD SIMILAR TO THE F/A-18C/D. 
 
2. (U)  THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF THE MODERNIZATION PROJECT 
HAVE NOW BEEN FUNDED.  MODERNIZATION WILL BE COMPLETE WITH 
THE INTEGRATION OF THE ADVANCED SHORT-RANGE AIR-TO-AIR 
MISSILE (ASRAAM); ADVANCED MEDIUM RANGE AIR-TO-AIR (AMRAAM); 
ALL WEATHER PRECISION-GUIDED MUNITIONS (LIKELY THE JDAM) AND 
AN ADVANCED MULTI-ROLE INFRARED SENSOR.  THE TWO FULLY FUNDED 
PHASES: 
 
A. (U)  ECP-583R1 CHANGES.  NEW MISSION COMPUTER; APG-73 
RADAR; NEW DIGITAL ANTI-JAM RADIOS; COMBINED IFF INTERROGATOR 
TRANSPONDER; NEW STORES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM; NEW COLOR 
DISPLAYS; GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS); AND NIGHT VISION 
GOGGLES. 
 
B. (U) ECP-583R2 CHANGES.  LINK-16 DATALINK; DEFENSIVE 
ELECTRONIC WARFARE SUITE; JOINT HELMET-MOUNTED CUEING SYSTEM; 
AND FLIGHT DATA RECORDER. 
 
3. (C)  EVEN WITH THE MODERNIZATION PROCESS STILL UNDERWAY, 
CONCERNS HAVE ARISEN ON FLEET AVAILABILITY AND ESTIMATED LIFE 
EXPECTANCY(ELE).  OF THE EIGHTY MODERNIZED AIRCRAFT, ONLY 
HALF WILL RECEIVE CENTER BARREL FUSELAGE REPLACEMENTS GIVING 
THEM A SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED ELE.  BECAUSE OF COSTS, OF THE 
80 MODERNIZED AIRCRAFT ONLY 48 WILL ASSIGNED TO FOUR 
OPERATIONAL SQUADRONS (TWO AT CFB COLD LAKE, ALBERTA AND TWO 
AT CFB BAGOTVILLE, QUEBEC).  GIVEN EVEN OPTIMISTIC READINESS 
RATES OF 70 PERCENT AND NO OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENTS, THIS MEANS 
THAT CANADA WILL ONLY HAVE A MAXIMUM OF 34 F/A-18 AIRCRAFT 
AVAILABLE ON ANY GIVEN DAY.  ACCORDING TO SOURCE A, 34 
AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN RATIONALIZED AS A NUMBER WHICH COULD 
SUPPORT FOUR 24/7 POINT DEFENSE PATROLS (CAPS) - AT EIGHT 
AIRCRAFT REQUIRED PER 24/7 CAP - TO DEFEND FOUR POPULATION 
CENTERS OR FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION.  ACCORDING 
TO SOURCE B, IF CUED AND PRE-POSITIONED AT A HIGH STATE OF 
READINESS, THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE COULD COVER VANCOUVER, 
EDMONTON/CALGARY, OTTA 
WA/MONTREAL, AND TORONTO. THIS WOULD LEAVE ALMOST NO 
CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE ALERT AIRCRAFT FOR WINNIPEG, HALIFAX, 
OR QUEBEC CITY. 
 
4. (C/NF) ACCORDING TO SOURCE D, CANADIAN AUDITOR-GENERAL 
SHEILA ((FRASER)), WHILE FINDING THE MODERNIZATION TO BE A 
GOOD IDEA, QUESTIONED WHETHER 80 AIRCRAFT WAS A SUFFICIENT 
NUMBER TO MODERNIZE GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF INCREASED NORAD 
MISSIONS IN THE POST-9/11 ENVIRONMENT. ONE MAJOR CONCERN IS 
THAT 17 OF THE 80 AIRCRAFT WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR TRAINING; 17 
AIRCRAFT WILL BE IN PHASE/DEPOT REPAIR; TWO AIRCRAFT ARE 
DEDICATED TO THE AEROSPACE ENGINEERING TEST ESTABLISHMENT 
(AETE); AND ONE WILL BE DEDICATED TO MAINTENANCE TRAINING. 
COUPLED WITH NORMAL ATTRITION OF ONE TO TWO AIRCRAFT PER YEAR 
OVER A DECADE, CANADA COULD BE LOOKING AT LESS THAN 20 
OPERATIONAL FIGHTERS AVAILABLE ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN THE 
2015-2020 TIMEFRAME. 
 
5. (C) CANADA IS A LEVEL ONE PARTICIPANT IN THE JOINT STRIKE 
FIGHTER (JSF) PROGRAM, BUT DELAYS IN THAT PROGRAM MAKE 
CANADA\'S DESIRE TO REPLACE THE CF-18S IN 2015-2018 SEEN VERY 
OPTIMISITC AND NO ONE SEES CANADA COMMITTING TO JSF UNTIL AT 
LEAST 2012.  INTERNAL AIR FORCE DOCUMENTS CALL FOR A NEW 
GENERATION FIGHTER CAPABILITY (NGFC) STUDY TO BEGIN IN 2008, 
ALLOWING SELECTION OF A REPLACEMENT FIGHTER BY 2011, AND 
PLACING A CONTRACT BY 2012 FOR 2015 DELIVERIES.  STATED 
COMPETITORS AT THIS POINT ARE THE F/A-22 RAPTOR AND THE F-35 
JSF (FIELD COMMENT:  PURCHASING THE RAPTOR IS A PIPE DREAM 
FOR THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE AS THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 
AFFORD ONE SQUADRON. INSIDERS BELIEVE EVEN THE POTENTIAL JSF 
BUY WOULD BE AT MOST 50-55 AICRAFT AND PERHAPS AS LOW AS 40. 
EVEN WITH THE INCREASED RELIABILITY OF THE JSF, WHEN ONE 
FACTORS OUT ALL THE TRAINING AND SUPPORT AIRCRAFT, CANADA 
COULD VERY EASILY BE IN A POSITION OF ONLY HAVING 24 FIGHTERS 
OPERATIONALLY AVAILABLE EVEN AFTER MAKING A TRANSITION FROM 
CF-18 TO JSF TOWARD 
S 2020. 
 
COMMENTS: 1. (C/NF) FIELD COMMENTS.  GETTING THE FUNDING FOR 
PHASE 2 OF THE MODERNIZATION WAS A MONTH-LONG ODYSSEY AND 
PROGRAM MANAGERS WERE SKITTISH ABOUT GETTING THE DEAL 
APPROVED RIGHT UP UNTIL THE TREASURY BOARD BRIEFING. 
 
2. (C/NF) WHEN THE CF-18 ENTERED SERVICE, THERE WERE 96 
OPERATIONAL AIRCRAFT FROM WITHIN A TOTAL FLEET SIZE OF 138. 
THE 1994 WHITE PAPER GAVE DIRECTION TO REDUCE THE CF-18 FLEET 
SIZE TO BETWEEN 48 AND 60 OPERATIONAL FIGHTERS.  BUDGET 95, 
THE NEXT SPRING, CONFIRMED 60 TO BE THE MINIMUM NUMBER. WHITE 
PAPER DIRECTION TO REDUCE FIGHTER OPERATING COSTS BY 25 
PERCENT WERE MET. IN 1997, THE SYNOPSIS SHEET IDENTIFICATION 
(SS(ID)) FOR CF-18 MODERNIZATION CALLED FOR THE MODERNIZATION 
OF UP TO 100 CF-18S (60 IDENTIFIED AS \'OPERATIONAL\' 
AIRCRAFT).  IN JUNE 2000, DND ISSUED DIRECTION TO REDUCE THE 
SCOPE OF MODERNIZATION PLANS TO 80 AIRCRAFT, BASED MUCH MORE 
UPON BUDGETARY REASONS THAN OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. 
 
3. (C/NF) THE AUDITOR-GENERAL WILL LIKELY FORCE THE 
GOVERNMENT TO GO BACK AND REVIEW WHETHER 80 FIGHTERS IS 
ENOUGH FOR CANADA.  THEY ARE LIKELY TO DETERMINE IT IS NOT, 
BUT LEAVE IT AS AN UNFUNDED REQUIREMENT OR PERHAPS EXTEND THE 
MODERNIZATION TO ANOTHER 4-6 AIRCRAFT. 
 
4. (C/NF)  FLYING HOURS FOR CF-18 PILOTS HAVE BEEN IN STEADY 
DECLINE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS FALLING FROM 240-270 HOURS IN 
THE 1980S TO AN AVERAGE OF 182 HOURS IN CY2003.  NUMBER OF 
PILOTS HAS DROPPED FROM 92 TO 68 AND THE AIR FORCE IS HAVING 
TROUBLE RECRUITING EVEN VERY SMALL NUMBERS TO TRAIN EACH 
YEAR.  THE YEARLY F/A-18 FLYING PROGRAM HAS DROPPED FROM 
28,045 HOURS IN FY93/94 TO LESS THAN 17,000 HOURS FOR 
FY03/04.  LESS FLYING MEANS LOWER PILOT MORALE; LACK OF SPARE 
PARTS AND MAINTENANCE SUPERVISORS QUALIFIED FOR INSPECTIONS 
INCREASES PERSTEMPO; AND NEW TRAINING ON THE MODERNIZED 
AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS ALL STRESS THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE FIGHTER 
FORCE.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, UP, CA, Canadian Ukrainian Community, Elections 
SUBJECT: CANADA TO SEND A LARGE CONTINGENT TO OBSERVE 
UKRAINE ELECTION RUN-OFF 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary.  The Canadian Government, and especially 
the large Canadian Ukrainian community, are eager to play a 
major role in ensuring the December 26 run-off elections run 
smoothly and fairly.  However, Canada\'s decision to send a 
significantly larger observer contingent to Ukraine than 
previously announced may pose organizational problems for the 
Canadian government.  Many questions remain, including the 
number of official and unofficial observers, and the training 
that they will receive.  A potential problem could be the 
perception that Canadian observers may not be neutral in 
their activities.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew, in conjunction 
with International Cooperation Minister Aileen Carroll, 
announced on December 6 that the Government of Canada (GOC) 
is prepared to send up to 500 Canadians to monitor the 
Ukraine election run-off on December 26.  The size of the 
monitoring contingent is unprecedented for Canada.  The GOC 
had been planning to send a contingent of 75 observers, at 
the request of the OSCE, after having sent some 40 observers 
to the run-off on November 21 (in addition, approximately 50 
Canadian private citizens traveled to the Ukraine as well). 
Normally, the GOC sends fewer than 10 individuals to monitor 
an election.  The move to increase the size of the GOC 
contingent came after public calls from the Ukrainian 
Canadian Congress (UCC), supported by several key members of 
parliament, for the GOC to send as many as 1,500 observers to 
the Ukraine. 
 
3.  (SBU) The relatively sudden decision of the GOC to 
increase from 75 to 500 the number of Canadians to be sent to 
the Ukraine may in itself pose problems for the GOC. 
Conservative MP Peter Goldring, who traveled to Ukraine to 
monitor the run-off on November 21, told us that his office 
is already receiving dozens of calls from potential 
volunteers.  The Ukraine Desk officer at Foreign Affairs 
Canada (FAC) also advised poloff that his phone has been 
ringing off the hook in the last day or so.  Goldring 
believes that the GOC may not be prepared to adequately 
screen and train such a large number of observers before the 
December 26 elections.  Somewhat paradoxically, Goldring also 
expressed his concern about why the GOC agreed \"only\" to send 
500 observers.  In an interview in the local press, he said 
that he believed that 1,500 Canadian observers is the bare 
minimum that the GOC should send to the Ukraine. 
 
4.  (SBU) A related issue to how many observers will go 
centers on the question of who will comprise the observer 
contingent.  Minister Carroll, in making the announcement, 
said that observers would be drawn from all qualified 
Canadians, and would be recruited by CANADEM, a non-profit 
organization that has previously handled election monitoring 
for the GOC.  (The Ukraine Desk noted to poloff that FAC 
prefers to rely upon CANADEM to handle personnel issues 
involving recruiting and training election monitors.) 
According to the its web site, CANADEM is seeking individuals 
who have either previous elections experience and/or 
Ukraine-related experience.  CANADEM also indicates that in 
addition to the official observation mission organized by the 
OSCE, a second mission of Canadian observers may also be 
deployed, possibly attached to the Central Elections 
Committee of the Ukraine. 
 
5.  (SBU)  However, Liberal MP Borys Wrzesnewskyj, in a 
pre-announcement conversation with us, noted that the 
Canadian observer contingent will be composed largely of 
Ukrainian-Canadians, and organized by the UCC.  UCC Executive 
Director Ostap Skrypnyk further noted that the UCC is 
undertaking a completely separate recruiting effort (replete 
with its own application form on its web site, with no 
mention of the application process underway at CANADEM), but 
that the UCC is in quote informal negotiations unquote with 
the GOC to have UCC observers included in the CANADEM 
mission.  It\'s unclear at this point how may UCC observers, 
if any, will be absorbed into the CANADEM force. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Wrzesnewskyj (a first generation Canadian of 
Ukrainian descent) believes that it is essential that 
Canadians of Ukrainian heritage comprise the observer 
contingent.  He stated that he has traveled to the Ukraine 
five times in the past six weeks and is convinced that the 
success of Canadian observers is directly related to their 
Ukrainian heritage, and has little to do with them being 
Canadian.  Due to their regional connections and language 
skills, the Ukrainian-Canadian observers had much more 
freedom of movement and action than other OSCE observers, and 
were therefore  quote three to four times as effective as 
individual OSCE counterparts unquote.  He pointed out that 
the Ukrainian Supreme Court used a large amount of documents 
prepared by Ukrainian-Canadian observers, because of the 
volume produced, the clarity of the information, and the 
perception of impartiality. 
 
7.  (SBU) Underscoring this last point on the subject of 
impartiality, Goldring noted that Wrzesnewskyj had been 
photographed hugging Viktor Yuschenko, and questioned his 
impartiality as an observer.  Goldring also mentioned that 
NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, who likewise had traveled to 
Ukraine to observe the November 21 run-off, routinely wore 
orange scarves while in the House of Commons, clearly 
demonstrating her support for Yushchenko, in Goldring\'s 
opinion. 
 
8.  (SBU) Exactly how many official observers the GOC ends up 
sending to Ukraine is still being worked out, as is the 
question of the number of concurrent unofficial observers 
that the UCC may end up sending.  With a Ukrainian population 
in Canada exceeding one million, the election turmoil in 
Ukraine has been followed closely in the local press (not to 
mention extensive Internet and BLOG coverage).  The UCC is 
making a concerted effort to have as many Canadian-Ukrainians 
as possible travel to Ukraine, and has called for up to 
10,000 international observers to go to monitor the upcoming 
election. 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment.  The logistical challenges to the GOC will 
be significant, given the limited lead time (according to the 
CANADEM web site, the observers will arrive in Ukraine 
on/about December 21), the size of the monitoring contingent, 
and the somewhat competing interests between CANADEM and the 
UCC.  More importantly, however, will be the perceived 
impartiality of the Canadian observers (whether official or 
unofficial), particularly if there isn\'t adequate time for 
the GOC to screen and train such a large contingent. 
Ostensibly, the election observers should project their 
impartiality, but it is possible, given the pro-Yushchenko 
sentiments in Canada reported widely in the local press, that 
many observers may well be supporters of Yushchenko.  If even 
a few of the Canadian observers are overtly partisan (even by 
wearing orange apparel), their best intentions could be 
compromised.  Any perceived bias will likely be exploited by 
anti-Yushchenko elements in Ukraine, and Moscow, as further 
evidence (in their view) of western interference into 
internal Ukraine political affairs.

(U) 
 
1. (C) CANADA-U.S. POL-MIL RELATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER MARTIN 
LEADS A MINORITY GOVERNMENT, WHICH MUST MOVE FORWARD 
CAUTIOUSLY ON POLICY ISSUES AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE 
VIEWS OF THE OPPOSITION BEFORE PROCEEDING. PM MARTIN HAS 
GIVEN STRONG SIGNALS HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF AND 
WISHES TO IMPROVE CANUS RELATIONS. SHORTLY AFTER TAKING 
OFFICE LAST DECEMBER, PM MARTIN ESTABLISHED A NEW CABINET 
COMMITTEE ON U.S.-CANADA RELATIONS WHICH HE CHAIRS, 
ESTABLISHED A DHS-LIKE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT (DEPT OF 
PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CANADA) HEADED BY 
THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, DEVOTED MORE RESOURCES FOR BORDER 
AND MARITIME SECURITY, AND TIGHTER IMMIGRATION SCREENING.  IN 
APRIL, 2004 HE PUBLISHED CANADA\'S FIRST-EVER NATIONAL 
SECURITY POLICY WHICH FOCUSES ON: 
 
A. (U) PROTECTING CANADA AND CANADIANS AT HOME AND ABROAD; 
B. (U) ENSURING CANADA IS NOT A BASE FOR THREATS TO OUR 
ALLIES; 
C. (U) CONTRIBUTING TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
 
MARTIN ALSO PUSHED THROUGH THE AMENDMENT TO THE NORAD 
AGREEMENT, ALLOWING NORAD TO PERFORM THREAT WARNING 
(INTEGRATED TACTICAL WARNING/ATTACK ASSESSMENT) FOR THE 
MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION.  STILL, WHEN POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT 
DURING THE SPRING 2004 ELECTION SEASON, HIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC 
FOCUSED ON DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN CANADA AND THE U.S. IN 
ORDER TO BUILD ROOM BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE CONSERVATIVES WHO 
SUPPORT MUCH STRONGER TIES TO THE U.S. AND A MORE PROGRESSIVE 
DEFENSE AND SECURITY RELATIONSHIP. 
 
2. (U) PRO-U.S. DEFENSE MINISTER DAVID ((PRATT)) LOST HIS 
PARLIAMENT SEAT IN THE JUNE 2004 ELECTION AND WAS REPLACED BY 
THE HONOURABLE WILLIAM ((GRAHAM)), THE OUTGOING FOREIGN 
MINISTER. GRAHAM MOVED TO DEFENSE WITH A GOOD UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES FACING CANADA. 
ONE OF GRAHAM\'S STRENGTHS IS THAT HE IS WELL KNOWN IN NATO 
CIRCLES 
AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE IN MINISTERIALS AND DEALING WITH NATO 
ISSUES. HE HAS SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS LEARNING THE DEFENSE 
BUREAUCRACY AND LEADING A DEFENSE REVIEW.  HE ALSO SHOWED 
GOOD JUDGMENT WHEN HE CHOSE SEASONED CANADIAN BUREAUCRAT WARD 
ELCOCK AS HIS DEPUTY MINISTER (ELCOCK WAS FORMERLY HEAD OF 
CSIS - CANADIAN CIA EQUIVALENT).  GRAHAM HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN 
ON THE NEED FOR CANADA TO PARTICIPATE IN MISSILE DEFENSE. 
 
3. (U) CANADIAN DEFENSE SPENDING.  DUE TO PRESSURE FROM 
DEFENSE INTEREST GROUPS AND ECHOING CALLS BY U.S. AMBASSADOR 
PAUL CELLUCCI DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS, A GENERAL 
RECOGNITION IS SETTLING INTO THE CANADIAN BODY POLITIC THAT 
DEFENSE HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR TOO LONG AND MAJOR 
REINVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED. 
INCREASED DEFENSE FUNDING HAS EMERGED AS AN OFTEN-DISCUSSED 
POLITICAL AND EDITORIAL ISSUE.  WHILE PM MARTIN HAS ANNOUNCED 
NEW DEDICATED FUNDING FOR MISSIONS ABROAD AND FUNDED SOME NEW 
ACQUISITION PROGRAMS, THE CANADIAN DEFENSE BUDGET IS STILL 
WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED AND NEAR THE BOTTOM OF NATO MEMBERS IN 
DEFENSE SPENDING (1.1% GDP). 
 
4. (C) CANADIAN FORCES BACKGROUND.  A 20-YEAR LEGACY OF 
UNDERFUNDING AND REPEATED DEPLOYMENTS ON PEACEKEEPING 
OPERATIONS HAVE GENERALLY GUTTED THE CANADIAN FORCES. 
CAPITAL ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS ARE RAIDED ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO 
SUSTAIN O&M REQUIREMENTS.  BOTH EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL ARE 
STRETCHED.  A STRENGTH OF 82,000 IN 1990 HAS ATROPHIED TO 
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 50,000, OF WHICH ROUGHLY 19,000 IS 
DEPLOYABLE.  THE RESERVES CANNOT DEPLOY AS UNITS, EVEN DOWN 
TO THE COMPANY LEVEL, AND ARE PRIMARILY USED AS A LABOR POOL 
AUGMENTING REGULAR FORCES ON BOTH DOMESTIC AND OVERSEAS 
OPERATIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE QUALITY OF CANADIAN FORCES 
LEADERSHIP AND PERSONNEL AT ALL RANKS KEEPS THE FORCES GOING. 
 PM MARTIN ANNOUNCED CANADA WOULD ADD 5,000 ACTIVE SOLDIERS 
AND 3,000 RESERVISTS; HOWEVER, THESE SOLDIERS WOULD BASICALLY 
JUST ROUND OUT THREE UNDER-MANNED BRIGADES AND THEY WILL TAKE 
UP TO SIX YEARS TO BE RECRUITED, TRAINED, AND FIELDED. 
 
5. (C) CURRENT AND PROJECTED FORCE DEPLOYMENTS.  THE CANADIAN 
FORCES ARE JUST ENDING A SERIES OF MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITMENTS THAT LEAVES THE FORCES WITH LITTLE CURRENT 
DEPLOYABLE COMBAT CAPABILITY. MAJOR DEPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS 
(FROM ISAF IV - V LEADERSHIP IN AFGHANISTAN AND HAITI) TOOK 
PLACE IN AUGUST 2004, AS THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE ENTERED INTO 
A ONE YEAR \'OPERATIONAL PAUSE\' TO RECONSTITUTE THEIR FORCES. 
(AUGUST 2004 FORECAST IN PARENS; *AIR FORCE DEPLOYMENT): 
 
AFGHANISTAN - 2300 (700) 
SFOR - 650 (80) 
HAITI - 500 (100 CIVILIAN RCMP POLICE VICE SOLDIERS) 
GOLAN HEIGHTS (UN OBSERVERS/LOGISTICIAN) - 225 (225) 
AFRICA - 20 (20) 
ARABIAN GULF/OEF-DEPLOYED WITH GW CSG - 225 (0) 
*ARABIAN GULF C-130 TRANSPORT DETACHMENT - 240 (200) 
 
6. (C/NF) CANADIAN MILITARY FORCES CAPABILITIES:  WHAT LIES 
AHEAD.  ALL SERVICES OF THE CANADIAN FORCES ARE STRETCHED AND 
OVER-TASKED, SURVIVING PRIMARILY ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR 
PEOPLE.  INSIDERS INVOLVED WITH DEFENSE ISSUES BELIEVE THAT 
CANADA IS STILL UNABLE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE KINDS OF 
CHOICES IT MUST MAKE IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS MILITARY FROM 
BECOMING IRRELEVANT.  WHILE SMALL NUMBERS OF HIGHLY CAPABLE 
FORCES EXIST, SUCH AS JTF-2 
TIER-1 SOF COUNTER-TERRORISM FORCES (LESS THAN 300 SOLDIERS 
OF WHICH ABOUT 150 ARE TRIGGER-PULLERS), CANADA IS UNWILLING 
TO MOVE INTO THE NICHE AREAS WHICH THE BUDGET CAN SUPPORT. 
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, CANADIAN FORCES WILL REMAIN 
AROUND 50,000 - CERTAINLY NOT EXCEEDING 60,000.  EVEN WITH A 
DOUBLING OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET CANADA COULD NOT RECAPITALIZE 
ITS EXISTING FORCE STRUCTURE FOR PERHAPS 15 YEARS, AND NO ONE 
PREDICTS THOSE SORT OF FUNDING LEVELS (UNLESS PERHAPS IN THE 
UNFORTUNATE EVENT CANADA WERE TO EXPERIENCE A MAJOR 9-11 TYPE 
ATTACK).  GIVING UP ON MAJOR MISSION AREAS, SUCH AS AN 
OPERATIONAL BLUE WATER NAVY (AND MOVING TO SUPPORT/TRANSPORT 
AND 200 MILE SECURITY MISSIONS), IS THE ONLY WAY CANADA CAN 
FULLY FUND AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS WITH EXISTING (OR FORECAST) 
BUDGETS.  THE CURRENT DND LEADERSHIP IS VERY NAVY-HEAVY, SO 
THIS IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. CANADA SEEMS DESTINED TO HOBBLE 
ALONG WITH ONE OF THE SMALLEST MILITARIES IN THE WORLD TO 
FIELD A COMPLETE ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE.  THE FACT OF THE 
MAT 
TER IS CANADIAN FORCES AND THE DEFENSE BUDGET HAVE BEEN 
NEGLECTED SO LONG THERE IS NO WAY WITHIN THE CURRENT CANADIAN 
POLITICAL CONTEXT AND WITH COMPETING BUDGETARY PRESSURES FOR 
THEM TO RETURN TO PREVIOUS CAPABILITIES. 
 
7. (U) CURRENT MILITARY RELATED ISSUES: 
 
A. (U) HOMELAND DEFENSE.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION, 
THE PM CREATED A NEW MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY 
PREPAREDNESS CANADA (PSEPC), AN INSTITUTION ANALOGOUS TO THE 
U.S. DEPT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.  THE AGENCY\'S GOAL IS TO 
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND COORDINATE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSES. ALTHOUGH THE LINES OF AUTHORITY OF THIS MINISTRY 
ARE STILL BEING DRAWN AND THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED ON INTERNAL 
ORGANIZATION THAN STANDING UP A WORKING ORGANIZATION, IT 
ALREADY HAS ESTABLISHED LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH 
COUNTERPART USG AGENCIES, ALBEIT WITHOUT THE SAME SENSE OF 
URGENCY. 
 
B.  (U) MARITIME SECURITY.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS SLOWLY CHANGING, 
CANADA\'S MARITIME SECURITY STRUCTURE HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED IN 
AN UNCOORDINATED FASHION BETWEEN A PLETHORA OF GOVERNMENT 
AGENCIES. IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY, THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) IS 
THE ONLY NATIONAL AGENCY WITH A DAY-TO-DAY, LEGISLATED 
MANDATE TO POLICE ALL TERRITORIAL CANADIAN WATERS.  IN SOME 
CIRCUMSTANCES, CANADIAN MARITIME FORCES (NAVY) CAN AND HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT POWERS AND BECOME INVOLVED IN 
MARITIME SECURITY OPERATIONS IF SPECIAL AUTHORITY IS GRANTED 
BY GOVERNMENT. THE CANADIAN COAST GUARD, ON THE OTHER HAND, 
IS A SUB-AGENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND 
OCEANS (DFO), IS TASKED WITH A COLLECTION OF MARINE PROGRAMS 
AND SERVICE MISSIONS, AND DOES NOT FULFILL A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
FUNCTION.  BOTH THE CANADIAN COAST GUARD AND NAVY USUALLY 
PROVIDE THE PLATFORMS FOR RCMP AGENTS TO CONDUCT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT MISSIONS OFF THE CANADIAN COAST. SINCE THE 
INCEPTION OF CANADA\'S FIRST EVER NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY IN 
APRIL 2004, COLLECTIVELY THE NAVY, COAST GUARD, RCMP AND 
OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT THE DETAILS 
OF OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO MEET THE SPECTRUM OF 
OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE MARITIME SURVEILLANCE 
AND SECURITY OF CANADIAN WATERS.  CANADA WITH THE WORLDS 
LONGEST COASTLINE MEASURING ALMOST 150 MILLION MILES IS 
WOEFULLY UNDER RESOURCED WHEN IT COMES TO NUMBERS OF MARITIME 
VESSELS AND APPROPRIATING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET 
DOLLARS. THE FIELDING (AND EVEN THE ACQUISITION PROCESS) OF 
FOUR USED SUBMARINES RECENTLY PURCHASED FROM THE UK IS BEING 
CALLED INTO QUESTION IN THE WAKE OF AN ACCIDENT (FIRE AT SEA) 
DURING THE MAIDEN VOYAGE TRANSIT TO CANADA OF ONE OF THE SUBS 
THAT CLAIMED THE LIFE OF A CANADIAN NAVAL OFFICER. A RECENT 
STUDY BY CANADA\'S SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
DEFENSE CONCLUDED, \"THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO END THE 
FRAGMENTED AND LARGELY AD HOC DEFENSE OF CANADA\'S COASTLINE\". 
 
C. (C/NF) MISSILE DEFENSE.  ON 5 AUG 04, CANADA ANNOUNCED 
THAT IT HAD AGREED TO AMEND THE NORAD AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE 
THE MISSILE DEFENSE THREAT WARNING AND ATTACK ASSESSMENT 
MISSION WITHIN NORAD.  THE MARTIN GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO 
KEEP THIS DECISION SEPARATE FROM MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM, A 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN CANADA, WHERE SOME OPPOSITION PARTIES 
EQUATE MISSILE DEFENSE WITH WEAPONIZATION OF SPACE. 
 
D. (C/RELCAN) NORAD RENEWAL/TRANSFORMATION.  NEGOTIATIONS 
HAVE BEGUN FOR THE 2006 RENEWAL OF THE NORAD AGREEMENT. THERE 
IS AN APPETITE AMONG SOME, NORAD/NORTHCOM IN PARTICULAR ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER TO TRANSFORM NORAD INTO A 
MULTI-DOMAIN COMMAND, IN LIEU OF ITS CURRENT AEROSPACE 
CHARTER.  MANY ENVISION NORTH AMERICAN DEFENSE COMMAND WITH 
USNORTHCOM AS ITS U.S. COMPONENT.  THE BINATIONAL PLANNING 
GROUP HAS BEEN STUDYING NEW MISSION AREAS INCLUDING MARITIME 
SURVEILLANCE/DOMAIN AWARENESS, CROSS-BORDER MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES (MACA), CROSS-BORDER 
CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT, AND THE ADDITION OF THE MISSILE 
DEFENSE MISSION.  WHILE U.S. AND NORAD STAFFS ARE 
READY TO PROCEED WITH INCORPORATION OF THESE MISSIONS/TASKS. 
THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT GIVEN THE MANDATE TO 
NEGOTIATING ENTITIES.  HOW FAR AND HOW FAST NORAD TRANSFORMS 
WILL BE DETERMINED DURING NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE COMING 
MONTHS, BUT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO NORAD ARE CERTAINLY NOT 
ASSURED, GIVEN THE 
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN OTTAWA. 
 
E. (C) NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY.  IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE 
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A NEW NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY 
THAT - WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED - WOULD INTEGRATE DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES TO ENHANCE AND ENSURE SAFETY AND 
SECURITY OF CANADIANS AND THEIR ALLIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.   THE PROPOSED 690 MILLION CANADIAN 
DOLLARS (520 MILLION USD) INITIATIVE WILL FOCUS IN SIX KEY 
AREAS - INTELLIGENCE, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH, 
TRANSPORTATION, BORDER SECURITY, AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. 
PREVENTING ATTACKS UPON ALLIES (READ U.S.) FROM CANADIAN SOIL 
AND ENHANCING MARITIME SECURITY ARE TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. 
 
F. (C) DEFENSE REVIEW.   CANADA IS CONDUCTING BOTH 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND DEFENSE REVIEWS BEFORE THE END OF 
CY2004.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FORMAL 
DEFENSE REVIEW SINCE THE 1994 WHITE PAPER, GRAHAM HAS NIXED A 
FORMAL REVIEW IN FAVOR OF INTERNALLY-STAFFED ONE. SOME 
BELIEVE THIS DEFENSE POLICY REVIEW IS SHAPING UP TO BE A 
WATERED DOWN DOCUMENT WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES OR NEW 
INVESTMENTS FOR THE FY05 BUDGET (APRIL 2005).  EXPECTED 
CHANGES INCLUDE:  MORE ROBUST MARITIME SURVEILLANCE AND 
SECURITY CAPABILITIES; IMPROVED C4ISR; STRATEGIC SEA AND 
AIRLIFT REQUIREMENTS; MORE SPECIAL FORCES; SOLDIER C3, 
MOBILITY EQUIPMENT, AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS MORE INTEROPERABLE 
WITH U.S. 
FORCES; AND A DRAMATIC DOWN-SIZING OF TANKS AND HEAVY 
ARTILLERY PLATFORMS. THE NEW CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY 
POLICY IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW/PCO-BCP.GC.CA.  SEARCH ON 
\'NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY\'. 
 
8. (U) RECOMMENDED THEMES AND TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR TALKS 
WITH DEFENSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIALS: 
 
A. (U) WE NEED TO BRING MORE DOMAINS CRITICAL TO HOMELAND 
DEFENSE INTO A NORAD-LIKE STRUCTURE.  IT IS TIME TO 
INSTITUTIONALIZE THE FINE WORK OF THE BINATIONAL PLANNING 
GROUP (BPG) IN COLORADO SPRINGS.  I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT 
WE NEED TO ENHANCE OUR COOPERATION ON MARITIME DOMAIN 
AWARENESS AND MARITIME SECURITY. 
 
B. (U) WHAT OTHER DOMAINS DOES CANADA ENVISION AS APPROPRIATE 
FOR A TRANSFORMED NORAD? CYBER SECURITY?  MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES?  CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT? 
 
C. (U) THE PERMANENT JOINT BOARD ON DEFENSE HAS A KEY ROLE IN 
OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP.  HAPPY TO SEE CANADA HAS A NEW 
AND ACTIVE CHAIR (JUDI LONGFIELD).  WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
RESULTS OF THE PJBD MEETING IN MARCH 2005. 
 
D. (U) AS PSEPC MOVES FORWARD IN ITS INTERAGENCY 
RELATIONSHIPS PLEASE CONSIDER ASD-HD AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN 
BENCHMARKING ALONG OTHER U.S. AGENCIES SUCH AS DHS.  WE ARE 
ALL IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING HOW TO FUSE THE RIGHT 
CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE HOMELAND DEFENSE MISSION.  ONE 
PLACE PSEPC LEADERS SHOULD DEFINITELY VISIT IS NORTHCOM AND 
THEIR INTERAGENCY COORDINATING GROUP.  ANOTHER IS JTF-CIVIL 
SUPPORT WHERE THEIR PLANNERS ARE DOING GREAT WORK IN 
DOCUMENTING BOTH CRITICAL AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN 
CASE OF A CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT EVENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SENV, ENRG, EWWT, CA, Environment, Air Quality 
SUBJECT: MEETING OF U.S./CANADA AIR QUALITY COMMITTEE 
 
 
1.  Summary: The U.S./Canada Air Quality Committee met 
December 2 in Ottawa to review air quality issues affecting 
the two countries.  The meeting included discussions of acid 
rain, ozone, scientific cooperation and research, 
consultations and notifications, particulate matter, marine 
vessel emissions, border air quality projects, and health 
science initiatives.  The United States was represented by 
officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Department of State, and Embassy ESTOFFs.  Representing 
Canada were officials from the ministries of Environment, 
Health, Natural Resources and Foreign Affairs, as well as 
provincial officials from British Columbia, Ontario, and 
Quebec.  Bilateral meetings on air quality have taken place 
regularly since 1991, when the two countries signed the 
U.S./Canada Air Quality Agreement.  An Ozone Annex was added 
to the Agreement in 2000, and negotiation of a Particulate 
Matter Annex is under consideration.  End summary. 
 
Acid Rain 
--------- 
 
2.  Both countries reported considerable progress in reducing 
emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
the precursors of acid rain.  The U.S. SO2 and NOx emissions 
reduction programs were cited as major successes, with the 
United States achieving emissions reductions well beyond 
targets.  There was a slight increase in SO2 emissions in 
2003, as industry used \"banked\" allowances, but the overall 
emissions trend will continue to be downward.  U.S. SO2 
emissions in 2003 were 38 percent below 1980 levels, and NOx 
emissions in 2003 were 37 percent below 1990 levels. 
 
3.  Canada has also reduced SO2 and NOx emissions beyond the 
national targets, although Canada\'s strategy is to pursue an 
effects-based approach rather than the U.S. tradable 
allowance system.  SO2 emissions in Canada are down by 50 
percent from 1980 levels.  Environment Canada officials said 
they are concerned, however, about tests showing increased 
soil acidification in forests in Eastern Canada.  The two 
countries have prepared a joint proposal for an Acid Rain 
Symposium at the meeting of the Ecological Society of America 
(ESA) in October 2005 in Montreal, a venue which would 
provide a broader forum for discussion and publication of 
data. 
 
Ozone Annex Compliance 
---------------------- 
 
4.  The United States and Canada signed the Ozone Annex to 
the Air Quality Agreement in December 2000 to reduce NOx and 
volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, the precursor 
pollutants to ground-level ozone.  The affected areas, a 
transboundary region known as the Pollution Emission 
Management Area, or PEMA, includes most of the U.S. midwest 
and northeast and large portions of Ontario and Quebec.  In 
the United States, the NOx SIP (State Implementation Program) 
Call requires affected states to ensure that NOx emissions do 
not exceed specified seasonal levels.  Reduction strategies 
include implementing a cap and trade program for power plants 
and large industrial boilers, motor vehicle standards and low 
sulfur standards for fuels, as well as measures to address 
VOC controls on smaller sources. 
 
5.  Canada reported that it will meet its commitment to cap 
NOx emissions from power plants in Ontario and Quebec. 
Representatives from Ontario said that fulfilling the 
provincial government\'s pledge to close coal plants will 
enable the province to achieve targeted NOx emissions 
reductions, and that any new power plants in the province 
must be at least as clean as natural gas facilities.  The 
government of Ontario is also considering a Renewable 
Portfolio Standard, a requirement that a set percentage of 
electricity come from renewable sources, for any power 
imported into the province. 
 
Scientific Cooperation and Research 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  In the last several years, joint air quality science 
efforts have focused on particulate matter (PM).  The United 
States and Canada recently completed a joint transboundary 
assessment report on PM, which may serve to guide future 
discussions regarding a possible PM Annex to the Air Quality 
Agreement (see paragraph 10).  The two countries have also 
made progress on developing emission inventories, as well as 
coordination of research and development of protocols and 
formats for sharing of data. 
 
Consultations and Notifications 
------------------------------- 
 
7.  Officials from Environment Canada expressed satisfaction 
with notification protocols regarding transboundary issues, 
citing the example of the Algoma Steel Mill Consultation 
Group.  The mill, located on the border in Sault Ste. Marie, 
Ontario, is responsible for depositing pollutants on the U.S. 
side, as well as having an affect on visibility in a National 
Park on Michigan\'s Upper Peninsula.  The consultation group 
provides an opportunity for stakeholders on both sides of the 
border, including tribal governments, to address the problem 
cooperatively.  Similarly, the consultation process has 
provided a framework for the United States to express its 
concerns regarding a proposed petroleum coke gasification 
power plant in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about 50 kilometers from 
the U.S. border. 
 
Particulate Matter 
------------------ 
 
8.  According to EPA officials, PM is now one of the highest 
U.S. air quality priorities.  There are significant health 
effects from PM, and EPA expects that many areas of the 
United States will be exceeding the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards for fine PM in 2004.  The current U.S. 
focus is on inorganic precursors of PM, such as sulfates. 
Analysis of the pending U.S. proposal to further reduce fine 
PM has shown that health benefits far outweigh the cost of 
controlling PM. 
 
9.  Canadian officials said they are compiling database links 
to track PM sources such as wood burning, cement and steel 
manufacturing, and vehicle emissions.  Canada is also 
studying the contributions of agricultural ammonia to PM, and 
officials said that this year\'s drastic culling of chickens 
in British Columbia because of the Asian Bird Flu is serving 
as the basis of a study to compare PM concentrations from 
ammonia before and after the cull. 
 
10.  The two countries agreed to hold an informal meeting 
before September 2005 to identify issues of common interest 
regarding PM, including steps towards consideration of a PM 
Annex to the Air Quality Agreement. 
 
Marine Vessel Emissions 
----------------------- 
 
11.  Both the United States and Canada cited the need to 
institute stricter emissions standards for large marine 
vessels.  The problem is evident in the Georgia Basin/Puget 
Sound area, where both Seattle and Vancouver operate 
competitive port facilities as well as large fleets of 
passenger ferries.  According to Canadian officials, a 2000 
study showed marine vessels contributing to 33 percent of SO2 
and 22 percent of NOx emissions in the lower Fraser Valley, 
where Vancouver is located. 
 
Border Air Quality Strategy Pilot Projects 
------------------------------------------ 
 
12.  The United States and Canada are currently conducting 
three pilot projects under the Border Air Quality Strategy 
announced in June 2003.  The projects include the U.S.-Canada 
Emissions Trading Feasibility Study, the Georgia Basin-Puget 
Sound International Airshed Strategy, and the Great Lakes 
Basin Airshed Management Framework.  The latter has focused 
on the Detroit-Windsor area, with a U.S./Canada steering 
committee and four subgroups addressing airshed 
characterization, policy needs, voluntary early actions, and 
outreach/communications.  Both the United States and Canada 
are conducting joint air quality modeling, sharing data, and 
looking at the feasibility of transboundary emissions 
trading.  For the Georgia Basin/Puget Sound project, 
activities currently center on conducting airshed 
characterization of ozone, PM, and visibility patterns. 
 
Health Science Initiatives 
-------------------------- 
 
13.  Officials on both sides acknowledged significant gaps in 
the understanding of health effects of specific types of air 
pollution, especially PM.  Canada is conducting a study in 
Windsor, Ontario, on the effects of PM on children, while the 
United States is conducting a complementary study in Detroit, 
just across the border. 
 
Next Steps 
---------- 
 
14.  In addition to preliminary discussions in September 2005 
regarding a PM Annex and the possibility of an Acid Rain 
Symposium in October 2005, the two countries tentatively 
agreed to hold next year\'s Air Quality Committee meeting the 
week of November 9 in Washington.  The Committee also 
accepted the recently released 2004 Air Quality Agreement 
Progress Report, which may be accessed at

TAGS: MARR, PREL, CA, Missile Defense 
SUBJECT: RAYTHEON BRIEFS AMBASSADOR ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
CONSULTATIONS WITH CANADIANS 
 
Classified By: POL M/C BRIAN FLORA.  REASON 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C/NF) SUMMARY: In a December 8 office call, Raytheon 
representatives (U.S. and Canadian) briefed the Ambassador 
and mission officers on recent meetings with Canadian 
Ambassador Kergin in Washington and senators on Parliament 
Hill. Raytheon assesses that the Canadian government \"may be 
interested\" in finding a way to host the X-Band Radar (MLX) 
on Canadian soil.  It is proposing a joint Canadian/USG and 
industry study to examine elements of a Canadian contribution 
to missile defense.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C/NF) US VP for Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (BMDS) 
Peter Franklin said that Raytheon\'s meeting with Ambassador 
Kergin and Canadian defense attache RADM Mack went very well; 
both officials were receptive to what Raytheon had to say. 
At the Canadian Embassy\'s request, the Missile Defense Agency 
(MDA) was scheduled to provide a classified briefing next 
week regarding the potential benefit (to the MD system) of a 
radar based in eastern Canada. 
 
3. (C/NF) Franklin characterized the luncheon with fourteen 
senators as particularly useful and generally positive. 
Business Development Manager Dennis McKay commented that the 
senators\' principal concerns were consistent with those 
articulated by other Canadians both publicly and privately: 
i.e., a) what happens to NORAD cooperation if Canada doesn\'t 
participate in MD; b) the effect/impact of debris from a 
missile intercept on the environment and humans; and c) the 
financial implications for Canada of participation in missile 
defense.  Franklin noted that Raytheon was proposing a joint 
government and industry dialogue that would address the 
senators\' concerns and also inform Canadians of the range of 
options for and benefits of MD particpation. 
 
3. (C/NF) Ambassador Cellucci welcomed Raytheon\'s read-out 
and thanked them for their initiative with Canadian 
officials.  He noted that Defense Minister Graham and Senator 
Colin Kenny had spoken out in favor of missile defense, and 
many other government interlocutors agreed that it made sense 
for Canada.  The problem was political, the Ambassador 
continued, compounded by a lack of leadership in the 
governing party and the Opposition.  The Prime Minister was 
psychologically hamstrung by his party\'s \"minority\" status in 
the Parliament, and the Conservatives had decided to play 
politics with national security.  Without an assurance of 
Conservative support, the governing Liberals did not dare 
move forward on missile defense.  Asked what Raytheon could 
do to try and turn things around, the Ambassador urged 
Raytheon representatives to talk to Conservative Opposition 
Leader Stephen Harper. \"Tell him I sent you,\" he quipped, 
adding that he himself would continue to work on persuading 
Mr. Harper to change tack for the good of the country. 
 
4. (C/NF) In a separate meeting, a Canadian Raytheon 
representative (protect) told polmiloff that Defense Minister 
Graham\'s staff, at the Minister\'s behest, were brainstorming 
proposals to try and advance Canadian participation in 
missile defense.  One of Graham\'s executive assistants wanted 
to know informally (without directly approaching the Embassy) 
if the USG would be receptive to Canada hosting the X-Band 
Radar \"as part of NORAD\" rather than as explicit 
participation in missile defense.  Polmiloff responded that 
it might be useful to explore this line of thought with the 
parties involved and invited the Minister\'s staff to contact 
Mission staff.

SUBJECT: OPPOSING A THIRD TERM FOR IAEA DIRECTOR GENERAL 
ELBARADEI 
 
REF: SECSTATE 264699 
 
Classified By: POL M/C BRIAN FLORA.  REASON 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) In response to ref demarche, Foreign Affairs Canada 
Deputy Director for nuclear non-proliferation Terry Wood 
re-affirmed to polmiloff that Canada shares USG\'s view on 
limiting the term of the IAEA Director General to two years. 
At the same time, Wood said, the next DG must be someone who 
enjoys the general support and full confidence of the 
membership; a \"protracted and messy\" process to bring in El 
Baradei\'s successor would not be good for the institution. 
Asked if Canada had a successor candidate in mind, Wood 
replied in the negative. 
 
2. (C) Wood noted that in a one-on-one meeting with DG El 
Baradei on November 18th, FAC Global and Security Affairs 
Assistant Deputy Minister Jim Wright encouraged the DG to \"do 
the right thing\" and not/not stand for a third term.  El 
Baradei reportedly told Wright that there were a lot of 
things he could do (for the institution).   He said he had 
not sought out a third term; rather, other member states 
wanted him to do this.  Moreover, the DG also said he had not 
seen an \"unequivocal\" response from the U.S. opposing his 
third term.  The DG felt his support among members was strong 
enough that he would be able to defeat any other candidate. 
 
3. (C) Wood said that Canada was mindful of the USG request 
for a response by December 15; the Canadian 
governmentnonetheless would continue discussing the issue 
over the next week.  He noted that instructions were sent to 
the  Canadian Embassy in Washington on Friday to engage 
Department contacts (NFI) on this topic.  Ottawa was keen to 
hear USG\'s proposed strategy.  Wood felt that Step One should 
be to open up the position but getting the requisite 12 votes 
to do so would not be easy, and at this particular time the 
odds did not favor \"us.\"  Once El Baradei was \"eased out\" of 
the way, he concluded, it would be much easier to locate a 
suitable successor candidate.

Committee on Justice, Human Rights, and Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness.  The Ambassador hosted a luncheon for 
the Congressman and Mr. Kiko with five Members of Parliament 
serving on the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Committee: 
Wayne Easter, Marlene Jennings, Peter Stoffer, Lee 
Richardson, and Greg Thompson.  The Deputy Chief of Mission 
hosted a luncheon with Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Peter Harder and Assistant Deputy Minister (Americas) Bill 
Crosbie, and Assistant Deputy Minister of International Trade 
and Chief WTO Negotiator John Gero.  Prior to his departure 
from Ottawa\'s McDonald-Cartier International Airport, 
Congressman Sensenbrenner met U.S. pre-clearance officials 
and observed pre-clearance operations for outgoing 
passengers. 
 
4.  (U) Comment:  Post believes that Congressman 
Sensenbrenner\'s discussions with Canadian officials and 
Parliamentarians were highly productive in taking stock of 
improvements the United States and Canada have made in border 
security--and in identifying what more needs to be done.  We 
anticipate that these these exchanges will prove to be 
helpful in advancing Mission Canada\'s priorities regarding 
border security.  Post appreciates the efforts of Congressman 
Sensenbrenner and Chief of Staff Kiko in moving the ball 
forward on border security.  End comment.

2.  Post delivered request for Canadian maritime patrol 
aircraft assistance to Foreign Affairs Canada on December 10 
as per reftel.  Deputy Director for Regional Security and 
Peacekeeping, Foreign Affairs Canada, Sarah Fountain-Smith 
responded on December 15 that the GoC was not yet in a 
position to respond, but will continue to explore the 
possibility of future cooperation.  She noted that her 
counterparts in the Department of National Defense had been 
told that Canadian military units quote can\'t take on 
anything new unquote, but ventured that by considering this 
US request for air reconnaissance assistance in terms of 
North American Security, there might be some flexibility down 
the line.  She noted that no decision would likely be made 
before the middle of January at the earliest. 
 
3.  Comment:  Given the state of Canada\'s current CP 140 
inventory (there are 17 aircraft in total and all of them are 
either in Canada\'s deployed operational squadrons or their 
one replacement squadron), Post suspects Canada may not have 
the capability in the short term to respond positively to the 
US request.  However, Canadian law enforcement officials 
informally told Post today that Colombian drug traffickers 
and money launderers in Canada are about to be designated 
national law enforcement intelligence targets.  Once this 
happens and it is made public, it may be easier for the 
Canadian Government to link the effectiveness of fighting 
Colombian drug runners and their surrogates in Canada with 
participating in maritime patrol aircraft deployments in the 
Caribbean.

SUBJECT:  CANADIAN SENATE RELEASES REPORT OUTLINING DEFENCE 
AND SECURITY PROBLEMS 
 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  The Canadian Senate\'s Standing Committee 
on National Security and Defence released a report, \"The 
Canadian Security Guidebook:  An Update of Security Problems 
in Search of Solutions\" on December 8.  In the report, the 
committee cites eighty-six problems in the following areas: 
Border Crossings, Coasts, Canadian Forces, Structure and 
Coordination of Government, Ports, Airports, and Emergency 
Preparedness.  Among the primary recommendations of the 
Senate Committee are:  the Canadian Defence Budget requires 
an increase of $3.2 Billion USD per year, a judicial inquiry 
is required to examine the presence of organized crime in 
Canada\'s ports, mail and cargo should be scanned at 
airports, and all airport staff should be given complete 
background checks.  End summary. 
 
2. (U)  The Canadian Senate\'s Standing Committee on National 
Security and Defence released a report, \"The Canadian 
Security Guidebook:  An Update of Security Problems in 
Search of Solutions\" on December 8.  The report is the 
result of a three-year study of border security and defence 
issues that began in January 2001.  It is widely accepted 
that Senate Committee reports maintain a higher standard 
than those of the House of Commons for the following 
reasons:  1) Senators are considered very capable and 
experienced, 2) investigations are non-partisan, 3) Senate 
investigations are not over-exposed in the media, 4) 
Senators are free to invest time in research and analysis, 
and 5) Senators can work on a topic for years without 
election or reassignment. 
 
3. (U)  The Senators identified the following problems and 
made recommendations to address the issues. 
 
A.  Border Crossings 
 
 
-- Poor Threat Identification at the Border.  The committee 
recommends that the government invest in training and give 
access to police databanks to border personnel.

board and made operational as soon as possible. 
-- Lack of Oversight.  The committee recommends that the 
government review whether or not organizations aside from 
CSIS or CSE require oversight. 
 
 
-- Coordination Lacking In Coastal Defence.  The committee 
recommends the creation of maritime surveillance centres. 
(pending) 
 
-- Allocations of Proceeds of Crime.  The committee 
recommends that confiscated goods be sold and the proceeds 
be directed back into border policing capabilities. 
 
-- Canada Too Inward Looking.  The committee recommends that 
the government study how other countries are upgrading their 
port security. 
 
E.  Ports 
 
--  Vulnerable Ports.  The committee recommends a public 
inquiry to investigate organized crime and how port police 
are recruited and trained.

-- Airport Policing is Inadequate.  The committee recommends 
that all policing responsibility be placed in the hands of 
the RCMP (who can contract work to the Canadian Air 
Transport Authority). 
 
-- Lack of Transparency for Security Improvements.  The 
committee recommends that the Canadian Air Transport 
Authority should make a complete, annual report on its 
activities and expenditures. 
 
-- Air Travellers\' Security Charge.  The committee 
recommends that the government completely account for the 
$12 CDN Air Travellers Security Charge. 
 
-- Unnecessary Secrecy.  The committee recommends that 
Transport Canada be transparent and no longer use secrecy as 
a blanket means to avoid scrutiny. 
 
-- Lack of Financial Transparency.  The committee recommends 
that the Auditor General be given the authority to examine 
airport authorities. 
 
G.  Emergency Preparedness 
 
-- Lack of Emergency Management.  The committee recommends 
that the government examine the ability of all government 
departments and agencies to function in an emergency. 
 
 
-- Emergency Ad Hockery.  The committee recommends that 
Health Canada present a report on its ability to respond to 
a disease outbreak. 
 
-- Inability to Deploy Police in an Emergency.  The 
committee recommends that the federal government negotiate 
with the provinces for the rapid transfer of police across 
the country in response to an emergency. 
 
-- No Role for Reserves.  The committee recommends that the 
Canadian Forces improve its ability to act as a first 
responder by more efficiently preparing the reserves for 
such a role. 
 
-- No Domestic Role for the DART.  The committee recommends 
that the CF Disaster Assistant Response Team be given a 
domestic role. 
 
-- Emergency Caches Mismanaged.  The committee recommends 
that Health Canada make information on emergency storage 
caches available to first responders and local authorities. 
 
-- Lack of Equipment for First Responders.  The committee 
recommends that the federal government should provide 
resources to purchase chemical, biological, radiological and 
nuclear response training and equipment. 
 
-- Institutional \"Lessons Learned\" Memory Bank.  The 
committee recommends that the Department of Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness act to keep its lessons learned 
files up to date, and that the information be completely 
shared with first responders across the country. 
 
-- Lack of Centralized Health Protection.  The committee 
recommends the establishment of a Health Protection and 
Promotion Agency to prepare for and manage events like the 
SARS crisis. 
 
-- Poor Collaboration.  The committee recommends that the 
government negotiate jurisdiction management agreements with 
Provinces and Municipalities. 
 
-- Emergency Public Communications.  The committee 
recommends that the government prepare a system for 
emergency communication with the public. 
 
-- Poor Communications Equipment.  The committee recommends 
that first responders across Canada be given uniform 
communications equipment. 
 
 
-- First Responders Out of Loop.  The committee recommends 
that local first responders be included in core planning. 
 
-- Weak Central Knowledge Base on Critical Infrastructure. 
The committee recommends that the government cooperate with 
provinces and municipalities to create a list of vital 
infrastructure. 
 
-- Lack of Leadership on Best Practices.  The committee 
recommends that the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness take on a role of leadership across 
jurisdictions and provincial and municipal borders. 
 
-- Large Cities Should Be Helping Regions.  The committee 
recommends that additional resources be given to urban 
centres that is tied to their willingness to support rural 
areas in the event of a crisis. 
 
3. (U)  The government has started to act on some of the 
report\'s recommendations and the introduction outlines some 
of the successes of Paul Martin\'s Liberal Government.  These 
are:  the creation of the office of the Deputy Prime 
Minister Responsible for Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness, the release of the National Security Policy, 
the new maritime surveillance operations centres, and the 
acknowledgement that the Canadian Forces have been 
overstretched and that both resource increases and a period 
of rest are required. 
 
4. (SBU)  Note:  Canadian Senators are patronage appointees 
who hold their positions until retirement.  Calls for Senate 
reform are common.  However, it is the responsibility of 
Senate Committees to monitor, investigate and report on 
issues of interest to their mandate.  Senate committees 
strive to maintain their role as relevant investigators and 
reporters.  End note.

TAGS: MARR, PREL, CA, Missile Defense 
SUBJECT: CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAND-WRINGING ON MISSILE 
DEFENSE 
 
REF: OTTAWA 03336 
 
Classified By: JOHN DICKSON, DCM, FOR REASONS 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (S/NF)  In a series of end-of-year interviews, the press 
has cast a negative spin on Prime Minister Martin\'s comments 
on Canadian participation in the Missile Defense Program 
(MDP).  Nonetheless, the government is leaning toward 
submitting the issue for a debate and vote in Parliament when 
it comes back in session in March.  Defense Minister Graham 
has come out publicly in favor of MDP, and Privy Council 
Clerk Alex Himelfarb, the Secretary of the Cabinet, told the 
Ambassador that the government, after agonizing for months on 
the issue, felt it had to \"lance the missile defense boil.\" 
 
2.  (S/NF)  Prime Minister Martin, for his part, is in favor 
of Canadian participation, but for political reasons has had 
to protect his flank by setting parameters, as reflected, for 
example, in his two widely publicized television interviews 
this week reviewing his first year in office.  These 
parameters include his rejection of the so-called 
weaponization of space, no missiles based in Canada, and 
opposition to a major financial contribution by Canada, while 
guarding a \"say\" in missile defense implementation and 
operations.  In the wake of sensational press headlines 
indicating Martin\'s opposition to the MDP, Senior Foreign 
Policy Advisor Fried, at the Prime Minister\'s behest, called 
the Ambassador to reassure him that press coverage of the 
Prime Minister\'s missile defense statements had taken 
comments out of context.  He confirmed that the cabinet was 
moving the issue ahead.  What was needed from the U.S. was an 
indication of what useful role Canada might play, beyond the 
recent amendment to the NORAD Agreement which assigned to it 
the warning and threat assessment mission.  Ambassador 
Kergin, who had recently been briefed by Raytheon on possible 
placement on Canadian soil of an X-Band Radar array (Reftel), 
would be seeking a more detailed clarification in Washington 
of what further Canadian participation might entail. 
(Comment:  Given the Prime Minister\'s parameters, something 
like a radar system would be something the government could 
sell to skeptical public as a worthwhile contribution to the 
program.  End Comment.) 
 
3.  (SBU)  Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper told POL 
M/C that his party was ready to support participation in the 
MDP, but was waiting for the Prime Minister to come forward 
with a concept for Canada\'s role in the program.  In a 
foreign policy address on December 14, he criticized the 
government for its lack of political courage and leadership 
on missile defense and stated that he quote did not want to 
see Canada isolated from any move the United States might 
take to protect the continent unquote. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  A senior Liberal MP (protect) confirmed to POL/MC 
on December 21 that the Liberal Caucus was screwing up its 
courage for a February or March debate on Missile Defense. 
He criticized Martin\'s dithering and noted that the issue, 
while it wouldn\'t win any votes for the Liberals in the next 
election, was quote no big deal unquote. Once the fireworks 
were over in parliament and Canada\'s proposed role and 
caveats made clear, it would blow over.  The MP said it was a 
big mistake to have delayed so long; Martin, who during his 
leadership campaign had been on the record as in favor of the 
program, should have addressed it a year ago, shortly after 
becoming Prime Minister. 
 
5.  (S/NF)  Comment:  President Bush\'s public and private 
comments during his visit to Canada, in which he said he 
would welcome Canadian participation in the program, have 
moved the debate to the political front burner.  The polls 
show that the electorate is evenly split on the issue.  The 
Prime Minister and the key members of his cabinet are in 
favor, if mainly to help solidify what they see as Canada\'s 
paramount relationship with the U.S., but the political 
tacticians keep pointing out that it will cost the Liberal 
Party votes in critical urban ridings in Toronto and Quebec. 
With an election expected within the next 18 to 24 months, 
they fear that the handful of seats they expect to lose would 
jeopardize their hold on government.  That said, a limited 
form of participation in MDP such as hosting a radar array, 
might be billed as an extension of NORAD\'s warning function 
and would probably be politically marketable.

STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) PART I 
 
REF: STATE 249035 
 
1.  Unclassified entire text. 
 
----------- 
I.  Summary 
----------- 
 
2.  The Government of Canada is committed to reducing the 
harm and availability of illicit drugs within its borders. 
Health Canada has responsibility for overall coordination of 
the nation\'s drug strategy although other departments, as 
well as municipal and provincial/territorial governments, are 
equally involved in addressing the domestic use of illicit 
drugs.  In addition, Canadian law enforcement officials 
coordinate closely with U.S. counterparts to stem the flow of 
narcotics into North America. 
 
3.  In September 2004, the government reintroduced 
legislation (now Bill C-10) to change the penalties 
associated with the possession of small amounts of marijuana 
for personal use. It is expected to pass.  Highlights of the 
Canadian Addiction Survey were made public in November and 
reported that substance abuse among Canadians has increased 
over the past decade, with alcohol and cannabis being the 
most commonly used substances. According to the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), cannabis cultivation, because 
of its profitability and relatively low risk of penalty, is a 
thriving industry in Canada. In 2004, the RCMP estimated that 
annual Canadian marijuana production ranges between 960 and 
2400 metric tons.  Additionally, the RCMP estimates, the 
overall drug trade in Canada has the potential to generate 
proceeds for criminal groups in excess of USD 3 billion at 
the wholesale level and USD 13.5 billion at the street level. 
In early 2005, the Government of Canada is expected to 
designate Colombian drug traffickers and money launderers in 
Canada as law enforcement intelligence targets. 
 
---------------------- 
II.  Status of Country 
---------------------- 
 
4.  Canada has been and continues to be a significant 
producer and transit country for precursor chemicals and 
over-the-counter drugs that are used to produce illicit 
synthetic drugs.  For instance, Pseudoephedrine (PSE), a 
common cold remedy and the main component in the 
manufacturing of methamphetamine, is legally imported into 
Canada from China, India, and Germany. Until recently, the 
flow of large quantities of PSE from otherwise legitimate 
Canadian supply sources to methamphetamine \'Super Labs\' in 
the United States highlighted law enforcement concerns 
regarding the diversion and the eventual cross-border 
trafficking of PSE for illegal purposes.  In 2003, licensed 
dealers in Canada were authorized to import 49,407 kilograms 
of PSE and to export 43,860 kilograms of PSE to the United 
States.  The implementation of new regulations in Canada in 
2003 together with increased US and Canadian law enforcement 
efforts appear to have had a substantial impact in reducing 
the trafficking of this substance. 
 
5.  Nevertheless, traffickers continue to attempt chemical 
diversion from legitimate importers and have sought to 
supplement or replace PSE with ephedrine.  This is reflected 
in both law enforcement intelligence and recent seizures at 
US ports of entry.  In 2004, 1,240 pounds of ephedrine were 
seized entering the US from Canada by US law enforcement 
officials. Data shows that increasing amounts of ephedrine 
have been imported into Canada mainly from China and India 
during the last several years, and authorities suspect that 
some of this is being diverted to the domestic production of 
synthetic drugs. 
 
6.  An increase in laboratory seizures over the last few 
years indicates increasing ecstasy (MDMA) production, 
particularly in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, 
and Quebec.  According to the RCMP, Canadian law enforcement 
dismantled 6 labs in 2000, 8 labs in 2001, 11 labs in 2002, 
and 12 labs in 2003. In addition to synthesis labs, 
sophisticated tableting operations are increasingly being 
discovered in Canada.  In a 2003 Canadian investigation 
involving the dismantling of major organized crime MDMA 
tableting operations, intelligence determined that the pill 
presses seized at the sites originated from legitimate 
sources in China and the United States.  Canada does not have 
regulations in place requiring the registration of pill 
presses. 
 
7. According to the RCMP, the importation of ecstasy from 
Europe (notably, the Netherlands) to Canada continues at a 
significant level.  At the same time, the domestic 
manufacture of ecstasy and its analogue, MDA, appears to be 
on the rise.  In 2004 there were four large MDMA lab and 
storage facility seizures in the Toronto area.  In 2004, 642 
pounds of ecstasy was seized entering the US from Canada by 
US law enforcement officials. 
 
8. Other precursor chemicals available in Canada and used in 
the production of synthetic drugs are sassafras oil, 
piperonal, and gamma buturolactone (GBL).  These precursors 
are used in the manufacture of ecstasy 
(methulenedioxyamphetamine or MDA), and gamma hydroxybutyrate 
(GHB).  A variety of other synthetic drugs are also produced 
in Canada, including MDA and GHB, and are trafficked into the 
United States. In 2003, licensed dealers were authorized to 
import 0.67 kilograms of ephedrine hydrochloride into Canada. 
 There have been no legal exports of this substance to the 
United States. 
 
9.  Law enforcement reports indicate that cross-border 
smuggling of methamphetamine occurs in both directions, but 
is limited. According to the RCMP the bulk of methamphetamine 
available in the Canadian illicit market derives from 
domestic supply. The RCMP also reported that clandestine 
methamphetamine laboratories seized in Canada were 24 in 
2000, 13 in 2001, 25 in 2002, and 37 in 2003.  In 2004, 46 
pounds of methamphetamine were seized entering the US from 
Canada by US law enforcement officials. 
 
10.  While Canadian-produced marijuana accounts for 
approximately 2 percent of overall US marijuana seizures at 
its borders, the two governments are very concerned about an 
upward trend in seizures, which have increased 259 percent 
since 2001. Both countries recognize that, despite their best 
efforts, law enforcement authorities likely seize only a 
small portion of marijuana smuggled across the border.  The 
RCMP estimates that annual Canadian marijuana production 
ranges between 960 and 2400 metric tons.  While viewed as a 
nationwide problem, marijuana is heavily cultivated in 
British Columbia.  Significant production levels are now 
reported in Ontario and Quebec with combined seizures 
exceeding those in British Columbia.  In 2004, 40,064 pounds 
of marijuana was seized entering the US from Canada by US law 
enforcement officials. 
 
11. Some US experts suggest that the value of Canadian grown 
marijuana entering the United States annually approaches USD 
5 billion or more. The RCMP reports that Vietnamese 
organizations may have mastered technologically advanced 
organic grow methods and that hydroponic hothouse operations 
in Canada are now producing high THC level marijuana. 
Canadian law enforcement officials have also seized a few 
aeroponic installations, where roots are suspended in mid-air 
and sprayed regularly with a fine midst of nutrient-enriched 
water. The widespread demand for marijuana in Canada, however 
does not appear to be met by domestic production. Between 
2000 and 2003 inclusive, Canadian authorities seized a total 
of 7.8 metric tons of marijuana at Canadian ports of entry. 
Countries of origin include the US, Mexico, Colombia, the 
Caribbean, the Middle East, and to a lesser degree, Thailand 
and Morocco. In addition, the RCMP estimates that hashish 
seizures in Canada in 2003 amounted to approximately 10,903 
kilograms while liquid hashish smuggled into Canada is 
estimated at between 6 and 8 tons. 
 
12. Canada is also a narcotics consuming country. In November 
2004, Health Canada, the Canadian Executive Council on 
Addictions and the Canadian Center on Substance Abuse 
published highlights from the Canadian Addiction Survey, the 
first major survey on the use of substance abuse among 
Canadians since 1994.  This survey suggests that reported use 
of alcohol, cannabis and other drugs has increased in Canada 
over the past decade -- with alcohol and cannabis being the 
most commonly used drugs. This report suggests that 14 
percent of all Canadians have used cannabis in the past year, 
a rate nearly double that reported in 1989.  Reported youth 
rates showed almost 30 percent of 15 to 17 year-olds and just 
over 47 percent of 18 to 19 year olds as having used cannabis 
in the past year. In 2003, a total of 41,237 marijuana 
possession charges were reported in Canada.  Cannabis 
possession accounts for nearly half of all reported drug 
crimes.  In 2004, 22 pounds of hashish were seized entering 
the US from Canada by US law enforcement officials. 
 
13. The Statistics Canada study reveals that the increase 
hasn\'t been confined to cannabis, which includes marijuana, 
hashish and hash oil.  The survey also found that a higher 
proportion of Canadians were taking other illegal drugs: 
cocaine or crack, ecstasy, LSD and other hallucinogens, 
amphetamines (speed) and heroin.  Continuing, it states that 
2.4 per cent of the survey\'s almost 37,000 respondents, all 
aged 15 or older, reported using at least one of these other 
drugs in the previous year, up from 1.6 percent in 1994.  And 
1.3 percent, or an estimated 321,000 Canadians, had used 
cocaine or crack, making it the most commonly used of these 
illicit, harder drugs. 
 
14. The report also found that British Columbia has the 
highest rate of drug crimes among the provinces for the past 
20 years.  It was the only province to show an increase (by 6 
percent) in reported drug charges in 2003, including a 3 
percent hike in prosecutions of cannabis possession. The 
Correctional Service of Canada suggests that almost 70 
percent of offenders entering federal institutions have 
problems with alcohol and/or other drugs and that more than 
half of all offenders were under the influence of alcohol or 
other drugs when they committed their offense. 
 
15.  Outlaw motorcycle gangs and Asian, Colombian, and 
Italian-based criminal organizations cooperate with one 
another to varying degrees in the trafficking and 
distribution of illegal drugs. According to the RCMP, 
Colombian drug trafficking organizations and Italian 
organized crime groups are the most influential smugglers of 
cocaine into eastern Canada. Over the past few years, the 
importation of hundred kilogram quantities of cocaine into 
Canada is increasingly being carried out via sailing or 
fishing boats.  This trend departs from earlier trends when 
the preferred smuggling method involved the use of marine 
containers. It is estimated that approximately 15 to 24 tons 
of cocaine enter Canada annually, and it is it is believed 
that approximately 25 percent of the seized cocaine destined 
for Canadian markets either transits or is intended to 
transit the United States. Between 2000 and 2003 inclusive, 
Canadian authorities seized a total of 4.7 metric tons of 
cocaine at Canadian ports of entry.  Law enforcement 
reporting indicates that relatively little cocaine is 
smuggled from Canada into the United States (1.4 pounds were 
seized entering the US from Canada by US law enforcement 
officials). 
 
16.  Other illegal substances are also used by Canadians. 
Asian-based organized crime dominates the trafficking of 
heroin from Southeast Asia to Canada.  The RCMP estimates 
that one to two tons of heroin are required annually to meet 
the demand of Canada\'s estimated 25,000 to 50,000 heroin 
users and that this amount is smuggled into Canada yearly. 
Canadian authorities seized a total of 305 kilograms of 
heroin at Canadian ports of entry in 2003.  Also in 2003, 
Canadian authorities reported seizing 5.64 million ecstasy 
(MDMA) tablets at ports of entry, representing a 213 percent 
increase over 2002.  Members of Asian, Eastern European and 
Israeli organized crime groups, as well as OMGs, particularly 
the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, are involved in 
cross-border MDMA trafficking.  Asian crime groups based in 
Canada are known to be extensively involved in the production 
and importation of MDMA for the North American market. 
According to the RCMP and Health Canada, the demand for MDMA 
in Canada is increasing, and the drug appears to be preferred 
among adolescents and young adults.  The results of a 
national study of Canadian university students in 1999 
concluded that 2.4 percent of the students have used MDMA in 
the past year.  The Ontario Student Drug Use Survey, 
published in 2003, revealed that adolescent MDMA use 
increased from 0.6 percent in 1993 to 6 percent in 2001. 
 
17.  In addition, law enforcement intelligence indicates that 
the abuse of methamphetamine has increased, particularly in 
western Canada. According to the RCMP, the domestic 
production and trafficking of methamphetamine has 
dramatically increased while its distribution and use have 
reportedly skyrocketed in some regions in Canada.  The number 
of methamphetamine labs dismantled by Canadian law 
enforcement has varied each year since 2000 with 24 labs 
seized in 2000, 13 in 2001, 25 in 2002 and 39 in 2003. 
Between 2000 and 2003, Canadian authorities seized a total of 
6,510 pills and 14.1 kilograms of methamphetamine at Canadian 
ports of entry. 
 
18.  Overall, the RCMP estimates, the drug trade in Canada 
has the potential to generate proceeds for criminal groups in 
excess of USD 3 billion at the wholesale level, and USD 13.5 
billion at the street level. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Country Actions Against Drugs in 2004 
------------------------------------- 
 
19.  POLICY INITIATIVES:  The Government of Canada recognized 
that Canada needed to adopt a regulatory and administrative 
framework to better control precursor chemicals.  As a 
result, in early 2003 Canada enacted new regulations to its 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which strengthened 
Canada\'s ability to monitor and control precursors and other 
substances used in the clandestine manufacture of synthetic 
drugs.  Companies must now be properly licensed in order to 
import, export, produce, or distribute precursor chemicals. 
The Government of Canada has granted licenses to almost 300 
companies and issued over 400 export and 800 import permits 
for class A precursors.  The new legislation encourages 
legitimate companies to work with Canadian authorities to 
identify suspicious trafficking activity; however, to date 
reporting of such activity is voluntary rather than 
compulsory.  In addition, the legislation does not require 
companies to undergo mandatory on-site visits prior to being 
registered and fails to grant law enforcement officials 
access to all records of regulated transactions. 
Nevertheless, the implementation of these new regulations 
together with US and Canadian law enforcement efforts appears 
to have had a substantial positive impact in reducing the 
trafficking of these substances. 
 
20.  On November 1, the GoC re-introduced legislation that 
proposes changing the penalties associated with the 
possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use. 
Should it pass in its current form, an adult caught with 15 
grams or less of marijuana could receive a fine of USD 115. 
A youth caught with 15 grams or less of marijuana could 
receive a fine of USD 75.  The bill also proposes new 
graduated sentencing criteria for the cultivation of 
cannabis, based on the number of plants seized, as follows: a 
fine for cultivating 1-3 plants; a maximum five years 
imprisonment for cultivating 4-25 plants; a maximum ten years 
for cultivating 26-50 plants; and a maximum of 14 years for 
cultivating 51 or more plants.   This bill is complemented 
with another, also introduced on November 1, which if passed, 
would give Canadian police authorities the powers to arrest 
and charge individuals found driving under the influence of 
drugs. It could also make resources available to law 
enforcement officers for training in the detection of 
automobile drivers operating their vehicles while under the 
influence of narcotic substances and marijuana.  Canadian law 
currently provides for the legal use of marijuana for medical 
purposes and Health Canada makes marijuana available to some 
700 Canadians with medical authorization. 
 
21.  To address the organized crime element behind the 
proliferation of marijuana grow operations in Canada, the 
RCMP is establishing teams across the country to identify and 
dismantle these threats.  A National Coordinator oversees the 
activities conducted by these special investigative teams, 
which are currently active in British Columbia, Alberta, and 
Quebec. 
 
22.  In September 2003, the first supervised drug injection 
site in North America opened in Vancouver.  This site costs 
approximately USD 1.5 million a year to operate, is located 
in the downtown Eastside of Vancouver, and services an 
estimated 4,000 injection drug users.  The government of 
British Columbia is financing the project; however, Health 
Canada commits about USD 1.15 million for research as to the 
site\'s viability and public good. 
 
23.  ACCOMPLISHMENTS:  In May 2003, the GoC announced the 
renewal of its comprehensive drug strategy.  Health Canada 
committed USD 186 million over five years to reducing both 
the demand for, and the supply of illegal drugs in Canada. 
The renewed strategy will attempt to accomplish its goals 
through education, prevention, and health promotion 
initiatives, as well as stronger enforcement efforts.  The 
strategy also provided new funding for statistical research 
on Canadian drug trends to enable more informed 
decision-making.  Under the renewed Comprehensive Drug 
Strategy, the RCMP in January 2004 established dedicated 
investigative teams to target and dismantle marijuana grow 
operations and clandestine laboratories that produce 
synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in Canada.  These 
teams are placed throughout the country where organized crime 
operations are most prevalent.  Also in 2004, a National 
Coordinator was selected to oversee their efforts. In 
November, health-care workers, police and social service 
providers from western Canada met in Vancouver to discuss the 
prevalence of methanphetamine and develop approaches to 
counter its use and availability.  In early 2005, the 
Government of Canada is expected to designate Colombian drug 
traffickers and money launderers in Canada as law enforcement 
intelligence targets. 
 
24.  LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: 
 
--In January 2004, Canadian law enforcement uncovered a large 
indoor grow operation inside a former brewery in Barrie, 
Ontario and seized 20,100 marijuana plants. 
 
--In March 2004, as a result of Operation Candy Box / Project 
Okapi / Project Codi, Canadian and US law enforcement jointly 
dismantled a large criminal network producing MDMA and 
marijuana in Canada and distributing it throughout the United 
States.  Over 130 individuals in 19 cities were arrested, and 
more than 877,000 MDMA pills, 120 kilograms of MDMA powder, 
over USD 6 million in currency, and more than 1,000 marijuana 
plants were seized by US and Canadian law enforcement. 
 
-- Also in March 2004, Toronto police seized over 800 
marijuana plants being grown on the 18th floor of a high rise 
apartment building. Several apartments reportedly contained 
some USD 40,000 in specialized growing equipment. 
 
-- In June, DEA announced the arrest of 50 drug traffickers 
in Colombia, Panama, Jamaica, the Bahamas, the US and Canada 
believed responsible for the US distribution of three metric 
tons of cocaine every month. 
 
-- Also in June, Canadian police made a series of arrests in 
the Toronto and Windsor area resulting in 157 charges with 49 
counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and the 
Criminal Code of Canada against 24 individuals. 
 
-- In July, the York Regional Police seized two MDMA labs in 
Markham, Ontario with approximately 100 kilograms of ecstasy, 
2 pill presses, and Canadian currency. 
 
-- In August, US Coast Guard officials seized a Canadian flag 
vessel in the Caribbean and interdicted 350 kilos of cocaine. 
 
-- In September, RCMP and DEA enforcement officials conducted 
Operation Brain Drain and executed 53 search warrants in 
western Canada and the US and the RCMP obtained arrest 
warrants for 25 individuals in Canada.  Resulting illegal 
substance seizures in Canada included approximately 1.5 
million tablets of ephedrine, 600 kilos of bulk ephedrine and 
between USD 1.5 and 2.5 million in currency.  Additionally, a 
third MDMA facility was seized in Markham, Ontario with over 
200 kilograms of MDMA and precursor chemicals that could have 
produced an additional 300 kilograms. 
 
--  From October 15 through November 7 a Canadian police task 
force seized 15,000 marijuana plants, with a street value of 
some USD 15 million, in Southern Alberta.  During this 
operations 42 search warrants were issued, all but one were 
for residential houses.  One warehouse was also raided. 
Canadian law enforcement speculated that most of the seized 
drugs were heading to the US where they would be exchanged 
for cocaine. 
 
-- In November local police authorities seized 116 pounds of 
MDMA from three Toronto residences. 
 
25.  CORRUPTION:  Canada holds its officials and law 
enforcement personnel to a very high standard of conduct and 
has strong anti-corruption controls in place.  Government 
personnel found to be engaged in malfeasance of any kind are 
removed from office and are subject to prosecution. 
Investigations into accusations of wrongdoing and corruption 
by government officials are thorough and credible.  As a 
matter of government policy, Canada neither encourages nor 
facilitates illicit production or distribution of narcotic or 
psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the 
laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions. 
 
26.  CULTIVATION/PRODUCTION:  Cannabis cultivation, because 
of its profitability and relatively low risk, is a thriving 
industry in Canada.  In 2004, the RCMP estimated that annual 
Canadian marijuana production ranges between 960 and 2400 
metric tons.  While viewed as a nationwide problem, marijuana 
is heavily cultivated in British Columbia, although 
significant production levels are now reported in Ontario and 
Quebec.  According to RCMP seizure data, 1,102,198 marijuana 
plants were seized in 2000, 1,367,321 in 2001, 1,275,738 in 
2002, and 1,400,026 in 2003. In January 2004, Canadian law 
enforcement uncovered the largest indoor grow operation to 
date inside a former brewery in Barrie, Ontario, seizing a 
total of 20,100 marijuana plants. Though outdoor cultivation 
continues, use of indoor grow operations is increasing 
because it allows production to continue year-round; they are 
also becoming larger and more sophisticated. 
 
27.  DOMESTIC PROGRAMS (DEMAND REDUCTION):   Health Canada is 
the focal point for the nation\'s drug control policy and 
emphasized demand reduction as an integral component of its 
drug control strategy.  In an effort to decrease demand, 
Health Canada has financed a number of public education 
campaigns, many with a specific focus on youth.  The GoC, 
along with NGOs, also offers extensive drug abuse prevention 
programs  Drug treatment courts in Vancouver and Toronto 
offer alternatives to jail for convicted drug abusers facing 
incarceration for non-violent drug possession offenses. 
 
28.  AGREEMENTS AND TREATIES:  Canada is party to the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances, and the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic 
Drugs as amended by the 1972 Protocol.  Canada is a party to 
the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in 
Criminal Matters and the Inter-American Convention Against 
the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, 
Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materials.  Canada 
has also signed the Inter-American Convention Against 
Corruption.  Canada has ratified the UN Convention against 
Transitional Organized Crime.  Canada has ratified all 12 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions pertaining to 
terrorist financing. 
 
29.  Canada actively participates in international activities 
aimed at eliminating illicit drugs.  From November 2003 until 
November 2004 Canada held the Chairmanship of the 
Organization of American States\' Inter-American Drug Abuse 
Control Commission (CICAD).  In 2004, Canada provided 
technical assistance and USD 115,000 to CICDA for specific 
counter-narcotics related projects, including developing 
partnerships between health and law enforcement officials on 
drug issues. The GoC participates actively in the Dublin 
Group and the Commission on Narcotic Drug (CND) of the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). 
 
------------------------------------ 
U.S. POLICY INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS 
------------------------------------ 
 
30.  BILATERAL COOPERATION:   Canada and the United States 
have an extensive cooperative law enforcement relationship. 
The two countries collaborate closely at both the federal and 
state/local levels, and this also extends into the 
multilateral arena. An important bilateral cooperative forum 
is the annual Cross-Border Crime Forum, which engages 
policy-makers in a joint effort to guide the relationship and 
to enhance coordination.  The Forum\'s technical working 
groups continue to identify areas and priorities, such as 
intelligence sharing, where the two countries can better 
advance a common agenda.  For instance, at the October 2004 
Forum, the US Department of Justice and the Canadian 
Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada 
(PSEPC) released a joint threat assessment on the common 
threat posed by the cross-border illegal drug trade.  In 
addition, Project North Star is an ongoing mechanism for law 
enforcement operational coordination.  The two governments 
also have a broad array of agreements in place to facilitate 
cooperation in legal matters, such as the extradition and 
mutual legal assistance treaties, an information-sharing 
agreement, and an asset sharing agreement. 
 
31.  Canada is one of the USG\'s principal extradition 
partners. 
 
32.  The RCMP and US law enforcement agencies provide 
reciprocal direct access to each other\'s criminal databases, 
including the Canadian Police Information Center (CPIC), a 
firearms identification database, and a unique automotive 
paint chip database.  Canadian law enforcement benefits from 
access to the El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) and the 
USG\'s tactical National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC). 
However, some aspects of Canada\'s criminal justice system, 
such as Canada\'s strict privacy laws, limit timely 
information exchange in some areas. 
33.  THE ROAD AHEAD:  The US is confident that law 
enforcement cooperation and coordination with Canada will 
continue to expand in the future.  Specifically, the USG 
remains particularly interested that Canada continues its 
efforts to strengthen its chemical control regulations so 
that these regulations can become even more effective 
instruments in the effort to stem the diversion of precursor 
chemicals into the United States or other countries. 
Additionally, given the already significant amount of 
Canadian-produced marijuana entering the US, the USG is 
concerned that Canada\'s proposed cannabis reform package now 
in Parliament would have negative consequences for our 
bilateral efforts to keep our shared border open to 
legitimate goods, services, and travelers while keeping 
illicit substances from being trafficked into the United 
States. 
 
34.  To further improve cooperation with Canada, the USG is 
committed to: 
 
-- supporting  Canadian efforts to further strengthen 
chemical control legislation and regulatory practices, 
consistent with international standards and practices; 
 
-- maintaining and expanding two-way intelligence sharing to 
include the timeliness and relevance of the information 
provided; 
 
-- expanding professional exchanges and cooperative training 
activities between our law enforcement agencies; 
 
-- working with the GoC to increase the risks and penalties 
for criminals engaged in drug trafficking and other organized 
crimes; 
 
-- maintaining joint cross-border investigations and 
operations, and expanding these to include joint operations 
on the Great lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway; and 
 
-- actively promoting drug abuse awareness and prevention, 
particularly among our young people. 
 
---------------- 
Chemical Control 
---------------- 
 
35.  Canada is a transit and producer country for precursor 
chemicals and over-the-counter drugs used to produce 
synthetic drugs, particularly methamphetamine.  The chemical 
most widely used for this purpose is pseudoephedrine, a 
regulated chemical on Table 1 of the 1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 Other precursor chemicals available in Canada that are used 
in synthetic drugs manufacture include sassafras oil, 
piperponal and gamma butyrolactone.  Canada is party to the 
1988 UN Drug Convention. 
 
36.  Until 2003, Canada did not effectively control imports 
of pseudoephedrine, with the result that legal imports 
increased, primarily from China, India and Germany. 
Significant amounts of these imports were smuggled into the 
United States, either in bulk, or in tablet form as an 
antihistamine, for use in U.S. methamphetamine labs.  Canada 
tightened its Controlled Drug and Substances regulations in 
early 2003.  The new regulations provided for control of the 
23 chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and for 
the proper licensing of companies in order to import, export, 
produce, or distribute controlled substances.  The agency 
with primary responsibility for implementing the new 
regulations is Health Canada, but the lead law enforcement 
responsibility lies with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
Cooperation on regulatory matters between DEA and Health 
Canada is very good and ongoing. 
 
37.  Law enforcement cooperation is excellent and includes 
information sharing.   In March 2004, as a result of 
Operation Candy Box / Project Okapi / Project Codi, Canadian 
and US law enforcement jointly dismantled a large criminal 
network producing MDMA and marijuana in Canada and 
distributing it throughout the United States.  Over 130 
individuals in 19 cities were arrested, and more than 877,000 
MDMA pills, 120 kilograms of MDMA powder, over USD 6 million 
in currency, and more than 1,000 marijuana plants were seized 
by US and Canadian law enforcement.  In July, the York 
Regional Police seized two MDMA labs in Markham, Ontario with 
approximately 100 kilograms of ecstasy, 2 pill presses, and 
Canadian currency.  And, in September, RCMP and DEA 
enforcement officials conducted Operation Brain Drain and 
executed 53 search warrants in western Canada and the US and 
the RCMP obtained arrest warrants for 25 individuals in 
Canada.  Resulting illegal substance seizures in Canada 
included approximately 1.5 million tablets of ephedrine, 600 
kilos of bulk ephedrine and between USD 1.5 and 2.5 million 
in currency.  Additionally, a third MDMA facility was seized 
in Markham, Ontario with over 200 kilograms of MDMA and 
precursor chemicals that could have produced an additional 
300 kilogram

1. (SBU) Summary:  There is strong political pressure 
on the GoC to find a way to support Bombardier, 
especially given its current financial troubles. 
However, decisions on how or when to come up with money 
are likely to be made at the political level, leaving 
officials scrambling to find a funding mechanism.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  Post made reftel points to a range of GoC officials 
at Industry Canada and International Trade Canada, as 
well as to the executive director of Technology 
Partnerships Canada (TPC) and parliamentary officials. 
 
3.  (SBU) TPC Executive Director Tom Wright told us 
that Bombardier had not made a formal application for 
TPC funding, and that it was not clear that TPC would 
necessarily be the mechanism to provide launch aid. 
(Comment: TPC is under review in the GoC at the moment 
and has attracted media criticism for a repayment rate 
of less than 3% on $2 billion in disbursements over the 
last eight years.  End comment)  Econ officer also 
eventually reached Ron Watkins, Director General for 
the Aerospace and Automotive branch of Industry Canada. 
Watkins said that no decision was imminent, and that 
the GoC would not decide on its policy on launch aid 
until Bombardier had actually decided whether or not to 
go ahead with the launch of the C-series.  He also 
groused that press reporting on the issue, especially 
about sources and amounts, had been largely inaccurate. 
The press has reported that anywhere from $300-$380 
billion CAD has been earmarked for Bombardier out of a 
proposed aerospace industry aid package.  Almost 
immediately after that conversation, however, Industry 
Minister David Emerson told reporters that he plans to 
seek cabinet authority for financial aid for 
Bombardier, as part of a package of more than $1 
billion in aid for the Canadian aerospace sector. 
 
4. (SBU) A contact in the House of Commons told us 
December 16 that the Cabinet Committee had already 
discussed the issue but had not made any solid 
decision, and that the issue of WTO/NAFTA obligations 
had come up during those discussions. 
 
5. (SBU) One MP commented to us that regional politics 
are likely to increase pressure on the government to 
support Bombardier.  The separatist Bloc Quebecois has 
argued that Ontario has received almost a billion 
dollars in subsidies in the last few years - notably to 
induce Ford to maintain operations and build a new 
plant in the region - while Quebec companies have 
allegedly been left out in the cold.  Quebec regional 
interests explain the prominent role that Transport 
Minister Jean Lapierre has played in public discussion 
of the issue; ordinarily Transport would have no role 
in such a decision.  In the meantime, Bombardier, 
despite its financial troubles, has reportedly hired a 
lobbying firm in Ottawa and is pushing hard for 
funding. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment:  Bombardier\'s current quest for 
funds is the latest round in the long history of its 
entanglement in Canadian regional politics.  Ever since 
the Mulroney government handed a $1.4 billion contract 
to service the CF-18 fighter jet to Bombardier in the 
late 1980s (over a British-owned company based in 
Winnipeg), the Montreal-based company has been a symbol 
for Western Canadians of Quebec\'s \"spoiled child\" 
status with Ottawa.  Bombardier, one of the flagships 
of Quebec Inc., has also enjoyed and depended on 
subsidies from the provincial government. 
 
7. (SBU) The company has fallen on tough times in 
recent years, letting go thousands of workers in the 
worldwide aerospace and airline downturn since 9/11. 
(The surprise resignation of CEO Paul Tellier last week 
drew attention to its shaky financial condition and 
furthered battered stock prices.) All players -- from 
trade unions, to opposition parties to employers groups 
- have demanded that the Liberal government in Quebec 
find whatever it takes to compete with offers made by 
Northern Ireland or U.S. states, to ensure that final 
assembly of Bombardier\'s next generation of jets will 
be in Montreal.  On Dec. 3, Quebec Opposition leader 
Bernard Landry argued that the reluctance of the 
Canadian government to help Bombardier compete in 
international markets was a reason to have an 
independent Quebec and that an independent Quebec would 
have no such reticence.  The Province of Quebec 
subsequently announced a package of up to $700 million 
in loan guarantees for Bombardier\'s current production. 
Support goes beyond Quebec, however; Buzz Hargrove, 
head of the Canadian auto workers\' union, has called 
for joint financing by Ottawa and the provinces for the 
C-series, citing the success of European support for 
Airbus and commenting that \"we need to learn the same 
lesson.\" 
 
8. (SBU) Quebec officials have told us that they are 
pushing for the GoC to take on funding for Bombardier 
as a federal issue.  Ontario has reportedly just made 
an offer to support Bombardier production in the 
province, for which the mayor of Toronto has been 
actively lobbying.  Bombardier is rumored to have 
received offers from three U.S. states as well; Quebec 
may be seeking to avoid a bidding war. 
 
(SBU) Post will continue to monitor developments 
closely. Our discussions suggest that federal funding 
of some kind for Bombardier is likely and that the 
decision is essentially out of the hands of Industry 
Canada officials; timing and amounts are likely to be 
decided at the Cabinet level, leaving officials with 
the task of finding the right channel for funding.

SUBJECT: CANADA: 2004 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 245841 
 
1.  Unclassified entire text. 
 
2.  The Government of Canada remained steadfast in its 
condemnation of international and domestic terrorism and has 
been a helpful and strong supporter of the United States in 
the fight against international terror.  Overall 
antiterrorism cooperation with Canada remains excellent and 
serves as a model for bilateral cooperation.  Despite 
occasional differences, antiterorrism cooperation with Canada 
remains excellent and serves as a model for a cooperative 
bilateral relationship. 
 
3.  Canada has contributed to military activities in the 
global war on terror.  Canadian Armed Forces participated in 
Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001, and, as of December 2004, 
approximately 700 Canadian troops continue to be stationed in 
Kabul in support of ISAF VI.  In addition, approximately 200 
Canadian personnel are located in the United Arab Emirates, 
where they are providing airlift and logistics support to 
deployed troops in the Southwest Asia theater. Although 
Canada chose not to join the Operation Iraqi Freedom, it has 
contributed USD 280 million to the reconstruction of Iraq and 
has also given USD 18 million to help with the January 2005 
Iraq transitional elections. 
 
4. Day-to-day cooperation between the US and Canadian law 
enforcement agencies is close and continuous.  Under the 2001 
Anti-Terrorism Act, Canada strengthened its ability to 
identify, deter, disable, prosecute, convict, and punish 
terrorist groups.  It also provides investigative tools for 
Canadian law enforcement agencies while providing substantial 
safeguards to privacy and due process.  In December 2003, the 
Government of Canada established the Department of Public 
Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEPC), which roughly 
parallels the US Department of Homeland Security, and gave it 
the mandate of protecting Canadians from criminals and 
terrorists. 
 
5.  Canada cooperates closely with the United States on 
investigations, and there is a heavy volume of extradition 
requests between the two countries.  Canadian privacy laws, 
limited resources, and criminal procedures are more favorable 
to the defendant than in the United States.  This could 
occasionally inhibit a more full and timely exchange of 
information and may benefit supporters of terrorism. 
 
6.  Canada was the first country to ratify the Inter-American 
Convention Against Terrorism in December 2002.  Canada 
implements terrorist finance listings in compliance with UN 
requirements and coordinates closely with the United States 
on plans to freeze assets.  Efforts to counter terrorist 
financing include implementing UNSCR 1373, promoting the 
Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing of the 
Financial Action Task Force, and actively participating in 
the G-7, G-8, and G-20.  As of November 2004, Canada had 
listed all terrorist entities listed by the United Nations. 
Although they are subject to prosecution under the Criminal 
Code of Canada, the law remains untested and no prosecutions 
have taken place. 
 
7.  Canada and the United States take part in a number of 
joint counterterrorism forums.  In October 2003, they 
participated in a new round of talks under the auspices of 
the Bilateral Consultative Group (BCG) on Counterterrorism 
Cooperation which was formed in 1988.  Preparations are now 
underway to hold a new round of BCG talks in the spring of 
2005, to be hosted by Canada.  In May 2003, Canada and the 
United States participated in the second Top Officials 
simulation to test local, state/province, and federal 
disaster responses to a terrorist attack against civilian 
populations.  Canada will also participate with the United 
States and the United Kingdom in the next scheduled Top 
Officials simulation, scheduled for the spring of 2005.  In 
addition, the US Attorney General and Canada\'s Ministers for 
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and Justice 
coordinate policy at the US-Canadian Cross-Border Crime 
Forum, which last met in Ottawa in October 2004.  The forum 
has a sub-group on counterterrorism, and future efforts 
include continued implementation of provisions of the Smart 
Border Accord and the further integration of border 
enforcement teams that are now operating in 15 regions. 
 
8.  Canada has signed and ratified all 12 UN conventions and 
protocols relating to terrorism, including the International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 
and has listed all terrorist entities designated by the UN. 
In June the Government of Canada declined the opportunity to 
join the US and other nations to publicly reiterate the 
policy of not negotiating with terrorists even for the sake 
of securing the safety and release of the hostages.

TAGS: ENRG, ETRD, EPET, CA, John Efford, Alaska Pipeline, Energy 
SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES NORTHERN PIPELINES WITH 
ENERGY MINISTER EFFORD 
 
 1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for distribution 
outside USG channels. 
 
2.  (SBU) Summary: The Ambassador paid a courtesy call 
December 14 on Minister of Natural Resources John Efford, 
reviewing a range of topics relating to plans for natural 
gas pipelines from Alaska\'s North Slope and Canada\'s 
Mackenzie Valley.  Regarding the Alaska pipeline, Minister 
Efford said that any move to issue construction permits for 
the Canadian portion of the line that did not recognize 
TransCanada PipeLine Ltd.\'s exclusive construction 
\"certificates\" would raise a host of legal, regulatory and 
financial issues.  As for the Mackenzie Valley project, 
Efford said that the issue of compensation for the Deh Cho 
aboriginal band is currently before the courts, and he 
expressed hope that the judicial process would move 
quickly.  Minister Efford also touched on the prospects for 
liquid natural gas (LNG) facilities in Canada, and trilateral 
energy initiatives with Mexico under the North American 
Energy Working Group (NAEWG).  He expressed hope that the 
Energy Secretary-designate would be able to visit Canada 
soon.  End summary. 
 
Alaska Gas Pipeline 
------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Meeting with the Ambassador and ESTOFF in a 
conference room in Ottawa\'s Parliament Building, Minister 
Efford underlined that TransCanada believes very strongly 
that it has, through its Foothills Pipe Lines subsidiary, 
exclusive \"certificates of convenience and public 
necessity,\" issued in the 1970s, to construct the Canadian 
portion of the Alaska natural gas pipeline.  The authority 
for the certificates is derived through the Northern 
Pipeline Act (NPA) of 1977, currently the only Canadian law 
specifically addressing the Alaska gas pipeline.  Through 
another wholly owned subsidiary, TransCanada also holds 
certificates for the Alaska portion of the line under the 
1976 Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act.  The U.S. 
portion of the line may also be built under the separate 
authority of the Natural Gas Act, in which case 
TransCanada\'s certificates would have no standing. 
 
4.  (SBU) Referring to a recent round of lobbying in Canada 
against the exclusivity of TransCanada\'s certificates by 
North Slope gas producers BP and Conoco-Phillips, Efford 
said that the producers yet to come up with a realistic 
alternative pipeline proposal (the third producer, 
ExxonMobil, has told us that they believe it is premature 
to address the certificates issue until the producers 
establish financial terms for the pipeline).  Efford said 
that while the producers have voiced a general complaint 
that they do not want to be locked into doing business only 
with TransCanada, he believes that there is ample room for 
negotiation among all the stakeholders regarding who will 
build the pipeline. 
 
5.  (SBU) Efford opined that any challenge to TransCanada\'s 
NPA certificates would \"absolutely\" provoke an immediate 
court challenge, as the company believes it has maintained 
the validity of its certificates for nearly thirty years. 
Efford also voiced concern that any move by Canada to 
revise its legislation and issue certificates to another 
company could force a renegotiation of the 1977 U.S.-Canada 
Transit Pipeline Treaty.  He further noted that the 
environmental permitting process, always difficult in 
Canada, would become even more complicated if a route other 
than TransCanada\'s were to be proposed.  As an aside, 
Efford told us that he has argued within the GOC for 
instituting timetables for Environmental Impact 
Assessments, but that writing a timetable into legislation 
is \"almost impossible.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) Efford noted that the U.S. Congress inserted a 
\"Sense of Congress\" resolution in the 2004 Alaska Natural 
Gas Pipeline Act that the steel for the Alaska pipeline be 
made in North America, but that the 52-inch pipeline 
favored by BP and Conoco-Phillips could only be 
manufactured in Asia.  Efford acknowledged that the 
pipeline requirements have changed since 1977, when 
certificates were issued for a 48-inch pipeline, but said 
the technology for pipeline construction and operation has 
advanced greatly in the past 25 years.  He stated that a 
48-inch pipeline, manufactured in North America using 
modern methods, should be adequate for the pipeline\'s 
current requirements. 
 
Mackenzie Valley and the Deh Cho Process 
---------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Efford told us that the Deh Cho band is using the 
Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline project to gain leverage for 
tribal land claims.  About 40 percent of the proposed 
pipeline\'s route would pass through Deh Cho lands, and the 
band is suing the Government of Canada to gain more 
representation on the pipeline review panel.  Efford 
expressed hope that the judicial process will move quickly 
to resolve the Deh Cho\'s claim, and noted that the issue of 
the Deh Cho\'s participation has not yet led to delays in 
the project. 
 
Other Energy Matters 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Regarding the construction of LNG projects in 
Canada, Efford said that the Irving Oil Company is already 
performing preliminary work on a new terminal in Saint 
John, New Brunswick.  He also stated that that there is 
unlikely to be serious opposition to other proposed LNG 
terminals in Atlantic Canada.  Efford said that he 
understood U.S. initiatives to make Mexico a full partner 
in North American energy issues, and that Canada supported 
the effort.  At the conclusion of the meeting, Efford told 
us that he hoped the new U.S. Energy Secretary-designate 
would be able to visit Canada as soon as possible.  The 
Ambassador responded that a visit might usefully include a 
tour of the Alberta oil sands or the James Bay 
hydroelectric projects in Quebec.

REF: State 224924 
 
1.  Post regrets delay in response to reftel. 
 
2.  Econ Counselor discussed the pros and cons of developing 
an IPR toolkit for Canada with FCS colleagues, who have 
experience with the highly successful China IPR toolkit. 
Our conclusion is that developing a similar project for 
Canada is not the most effective way of approaching IPR 
concerns here. 
 
3.  As an English-speaking country with a reasonably 
accessible regulatory process, and an effective law 
enforcement system and judiciary, Canada does not present 
the same kinds of challenges as China, e.g. corruption and 
lack of transparency and enforcement.  U.S. IPR owners do 
not appear, from our experience, to have trouble navigating 
the system.  We therefore do not see the need to go beyond 
the information in the Country Commercial Guide with IPR- 
specific materials. 
 
4.  Rather, U.S. company concerns about IPR protection in 
Canada are focused primarily on the substance of Canadian 
IPR rules, e.g. failure so far to ratify WIPO, which has 
resulted in damaging ambiguity about the illegality of 
filesharing in Canada.  U.S. firms, and Canadian IPR 
enforcement experts, are also frustrated by some aspects of 
the Canadian legal system related to IPR enforcement.  These 
include the higher thresholds of evidence, and highly 
specific information, required to initiate an IPR 
enforcement case, the limited powers of Canada Customs 
officials to pursue suspected violations on their own 
authority, and the competition for law enforcement resources 
with other priorities.  IPR enforcement and related issues 
are part of the Mission law enforcement agenda discussed at 
the annual Cross-Border Crime Forum in October 2004, and US 
DHS/ICE officials have attended RCMP-sponsored events such 
as a week-long workshop in Toronto on IPR enforcement.  U.S. 
firms have actively pursued enforcement cases here, often in 
conjunction with their Canadian counterparts.  Mission DHS 
officers are also involved in efforts to energize bilateral 
cooperation on IPR cases through the NAFTA Enforcement 
Working Group.

SUBJECT: SUMMIT AGENDA ON COMMON PROSPERITY: THOUGHTS ON 
NEXT STEPS ON THE REGULATORY FRONT 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: AT THE BILATERAL SUMMIT ON NOVEMBER 30, 
2004, THE PRESIDENT AND CANADIAN PM PAUL MARTIN AGREED TO AN 
AGENDA FOR \"COMMON SECURITY, COMMON PROSPERITY\" THAT 
COMMITTED THE TWO SIDES TO \"PURSUE JOINT APPROACHES TO 
PARTNERSHIPS, CONSENSUS STANDARDS, AND SMARTER REGULATIONS 
THAT RESULT IN GREATER EFFICIENCY AND COMPETITIVENESS, WHILE 
ENHANCING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CITIZENS\".  WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT DISCUSSIONS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY AMONG 
CAPITALS ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS COMMITMENT. 
 
2.  (SBU) CANADIAN INTEREST IN THIS AGENDA PROBABLY STEMS 
FROM THE RELEASE OF THE \"SMART REGULATION\" REPORT, WHICH 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT NORTH AMERICAN STANDARDS AND REGULATORY 
REGIMES SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR CANADIAN REGULATORS.  WE 
BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF A BILATERAL COMMITMENT TO 
JOINT APPROACHES AND GOC CONSIDERATION OF THE SMART 
REGULATION AGENDA PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A 
PROCESS THAT CAN EVENTUALLY REDUCE REGULATORY DIVERGENCE - 
THE \"TYRANNY OF SMALL DIFFERENCES\" THAT INHIBITS TRADE AND 
REDUCES CONSUMER CHOICE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.  THIS 
CABLE DESCRIBES THE \"SMART REGULATION\" INITIATIVE AND 
OUTLINES OUR IDEAS FOR MOVING TOWARD MORE LONG-TERM, BROAD- 
BASED REGULATORY COOPERATION. END SUMMARY 
 
INTRODUCTION: THE SMART REGULATION INITIATIVE 
--------------------------------------------- 
2.  (U) FOR CANADA, THE BENEFITS OF NAFTA HAVE BEEN CLEAR, 
INCLUDING THE DOUBLING OF TRADE THAT IS NOW STRAINING BORDER 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  FURTHER GROWTH, HOWEVER, WHILE LIKELY, WILL 
BE CONSTRAINED BOTH BY BORDER INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITATIONS, 
WHICH ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN THE SMART BORDER PROCESS, AND 
BY REGULATORY DIFFERENCES WHICH CONTINUE TO IMPEDE ENTRY OF 
NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET AND LIMIT CONSUMER CHOICE. 
 
3.(U)  CANADA HAS JUST COMPLETED A THOROUGH STAKEHOLDER 
REVIEW OF ITS REGULATORY PROCESSES AND STRUCTURE.  THE 
CANADIAN \"EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SMART REGULATION\", 
CONVENED IN 2003, RELEASED ITS FINAL REPORT IN SEPTEMBER 
2004.  THE COMMITTEE OBSERVED THAT \".CANADA AND THE UNITED 
STATES MAINTAIN PARALLEL PROCESSES AND STRUCTURES ACROSS 
ALMOST ALL AREAS OF REGULATORY ACTIVITY. THEIR TWO SETS OF 
PROCESSES REFLECT A CONVERGENCE IN POLICY OBJECTIVES AND 
REGULATORY PROCEDURES. HOWEVER, MUCH OF THIS WORK IS 
DUPLICATIVE, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE INTEGRATED NORTH 
AMERICAN MARKET. THE OUTCOME CAN BE POOR REGULATORY AND 
ECONOMIC RESULTS AND HIGHER COSTS FOR GOVERNMENTS, CONSUMERS 
AND BUSINESSES.\" 
 
4.(U)  THE COMMITTEE MADE THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS, 
AMONG OTHERS: 
 
--THE GOC SHOULD INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY 
COOPERATION AS A DISTINCT OBJECTIVE OF CANADIAN FOREIGN 
POLICY, WITH A PRIMARY AND IMMEDIATE FOCUS ON NORTH AMERICA, 
AND DEVELOP AN AGENDA FOR NORTH AMERICAN REGULATORY 
COOPERATION. 
 
--CANADA-SPECIFIC REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SHOULD DIFFER FROM 
INTERNATIONAL OR NORTH AMERICAN MODELS ONLY WHERE THERE ARE 
IMPORTANT NATIONAL PRIORITIES, UNIQUE CANADIAN CONDITIONS OR 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES, OR EXISTING MODELS ARE INADEQUATE TO 
CANADIAN POLICY OBJECTIVES; 
 
--CANADA SHOULD PROMOTE JOINT PRODUCT REVIEWS AND MOVE 
TOWARD ACCEPTING U.S. AND EU PRODUCT APPROVALS IN SECTORS 
WITH WELL-ESTABLISHED CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES; 
 
--CANADA SHOULD STRENGTHEN INTERAGENCY REGULATORY 
COORDINATION AND DEVELOP OVERARCHING REGULATORY POLICY 
FRAMEWORKS FOR KEY SECTORS. 
 
 
IN ORDER TO PUT THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INTO OPERATION, THE 
COMMITTEE PROPOSED THAT THE GOC FORM MULTISTAKEHOLDER \"SWAT 
TEAMS\" TO IDENTIFY TROUBLESOME REGULATORY DIFFERENCES AND 
PROPOSE SOLUTIONS.  THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY 
AREAS: 
 
--MANUFACTURING/PRODUCT APPROVAL; 
--BIOTECHNOLOGY/LIFE SCIENCES; 
--ENABLING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR FIRST NATIONS; 
--ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PROCESSES; AND 
--OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT.

A \"SMART\" NORTH AMERICAN PROCESS? 
--------------------------------- 
5.(SBU)  We suggest that, in the context of our commitments 
in the November 30 statement, Washington agencies think 
about developing a broad-based bilateral or trilateral 
review of regulations that draws on these recommendations. 
While such a process could yield short-term deliverables, 
more importantly, it would set the stage for real progress 
in finding and eliminating a broader list of longstanding 
regulatory barriers than the NAI process has addressed so 
far. 
 
BRINGING REGULATORY EXPERTS TOGETHER 
------------------------------------ 
6.(SBU)  In our view, the logical first step would be to 
develop channels of communication between the regulatory 
oversight bodies, OMB and the GoC Privy Council Office (PCO) 
to exchange information on regulatory initiatives underway, 
set compatible timetables where possible and review existing 
regulations to identify areas for revision, or areas where 
we could negotiate mutual recognition agreements.  U.S. 
officials could also share experience on strengthening 
regulatory oversight and interagency coordination, a key 
recommendation of the Smart Regulation report. 
 
7.(SBU)  The agenda for these exchanges could include review 
of existing promising models, such as the joint PMRA and EPA 
pesticide review process, and a look at sectors identified 
in the Smart Regulation report and previous NAI discussions. 
These could include some aspects of drug approvals, 
processed food containers, and federal/state/provincial 
regulatory requirements for construction products. 
 
INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS 
---------------------- 
8.(SBU)  Second, Washington agencies may also want to 
explore how to involve business and other stakeholders. 
Options include expanding the Canadian approach to convene 
North American \"SWAT teams\" of government, industry and 
consumer representatives that review regulatory issues by 
sector and report back to governments.  Another model might 
be a North American equivalent of the \"Transatlantic 
Business Dialogue (TABD)\" which effectively articulated 
business priorities for US-EU regulatory cooperation in the 
1990s. 
 
9.(SBU)  Alternatively, or in parallel, both (or all three) 
governments could encourage maximum participation by 
stakeholders in the \"smart regulation\" process within 
Canada.  The Committee urged the GoC to designate a Minister 
to invite interested stakeholders to identify those 
regulatory differences for which elimination would not 
impede Canadian social (including health and safety) and 
environmental objectives. In any case, we should ensure that 
the USG and the U.S. private sector participate in this 
process as stakeholders and make recommendations by June 
2005. 
 
TIMETABLE AND DELIVERABLES 
-------------------------- 
10.(SBU)  Under this framework we could call on regulatory 
officials to reach certain objectives within twelve months, 
to serve as deliverables at a future NAFTA Summit or meeting 
of the New Partnership in North America.  Examples of twelve- 
month deliverables include: 
 
--Swat Team Reports: Stakeholder groups or \"Swat Teams\" 
issue reports on priority list of regulatory differences to 
address via harmonization or mutual recognition.  Such a 
list could include both bilateral and trilateral priorities, 
depending on feasibility. 
 
--Regulatory oversight bodies: OMB and PCO develop mechanism 
for consulting on new regulatory projects, decision 
mechanism for selecting regulations for parallel 
consideration or MRAs.  (e.g. applying EPA/PMRA pesticide 
model to other agencies) 
 
--Joint approvals: Independent agencies develop consultation 
process for joint approvals.  Example: CFIA and USDA could 
look into simultaneous approval processes for new seed 
varieties. 
 
--Initiation of joint reviews: An 18-month deliverable could 
be announcement/Federal Register/Gazette notices of first 
joint reviews of regulations in priority sectors. 
 
11.(SBU)  Such a framework would be a long-term investment 
in addition to an effort to identify \"low-hanging fruit\" in 
the regulatory sphere, although such a broad-based process 
might bring to light additional areas where early results 
are possible beyond those already identified in NAI 
discussions.  Post (Econ and FCS) would be prepared to 
support the process by working intensively with local U.S. 
and Canadian business contacts and regulators, DOC, and USTR 
to identify possible items for short, medium and long-term 
work programs across a number of sectors.

MERGERS 
 
REF: A. TORONTO 1986 
 
     B. TORONTO 1386 
 
1. (U)  Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge included a pitch 
for bank mergers in his December 9 speech on Financial System 
Efficiency, emphasizing that \"scale does matter\" and that 
Canada\'s financial markets must compensate for their limited 
\"size, depth and liquidity\" with greater relative efficiency. 
 Dodge, who was Deputy Minister of Finance while current 
Prime Minister Paul Martin was Finance Minister, is believed 
to closely reflect the PM\'s views on most issues. He pointed 
out that other markets, specifically the US and UK, have 
surpassed Canada\'s post-war lead in revising financial 
regulations, a trend reflected in the slide by Canadian banks 
down the scale of the world\'s banks.   The IMF\'s December 20 
call for clarification of the regulatory framework on bank 
mergers headlined the story in the business section of 
Ottawa\'s newspaper.  Financial sector observers now think 
that the uncertainty posed by a minority government might not 
prevent the GOC from having to clarify its position on bank 
mergers (an outright ban is not a feasible option), which 
could open opportunities for US banks.  Dodge also spoke 
about the need for a national securities regulator (septel). 
 
When, not If? 
------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The final decision on bank mergers rests with the 
Prime Minister and Finance Minister.  In 1998, Paul Martin, 
the then-Finance Minister, refused to approve proposed 
mergers between the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and the Bank 
of Montreal, and between CIBC and Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
Pressure has been building over the past year for a clear 
statement on bank mergers by Finance Minister Ralph Goodale, 
but his \"clarification\" was postponed from June to October, 
and is now on hold indefinitely.  Claiming the need to 
complete consultations with bank CEOs (of which there aren\'t 
that many), Goodale has refused to indicate a possible date 
for the much-awaited statement.  A banking insider finds the 
delay laughable, pointing out that GOC policy already permits 
mergers, and that no financial institution has requested 
clarification of the process.  They are \"horribly frustrated 
and the whole process is a sham.\" 
 
3.  (U) The is widespread agrement that Canada\'s biggest 
banks need to merge domestically in order to be globally 
competitive.   RBC, the largest, is now ranked 50th in the 
world by bank asset size, behind seven U.S. banks.   Four 
other Canadian banks are clumped between 61 and 66 in the 
rankings.  By market capitalization, RBC is the 36th largest 
financial institution in the world, followed by Scotiabank at 
41st. 
 
4.  (U) In the absence of Finance Ministry support for 
domestic mergers, Canadian banks have used some of their 
surplus cash to expand into the U.S. market (reftels).  The 
years of pent-up demand make multiple merger requests likely 
should banks receive a green light, so the GOC is wrestling 
with competition concerns in the highly-concentrated 
industry.  (Note:  Current betting, should mergers be 
approved, is on applications for a Scotiabank merger with the 
Bank of Montreal; Toronto Dominion (TD) with CIBC; and 
possibly a union between RBC and an insurance company. 
However, banks have kept their plans close-hold to avoid 
controversy.  End note.) 
 
Mergers could open the market 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  A contact at the Canadian Bankers\' Association, 
speaking personally, sees the GOC\'s best option as permitting 
the mergers, which are necessary to boost Canadian banks\' 
international competitiveness, while requiring significant 
divestiture of domestic branches.  Sale of 300-500 branches 
by merging banks would open opportunities for a mid-level 
Canadian bank (possibly National) and for foreign banks to 
expand in Canada\'s saturated market.  HSBC has the largest 
foreign-bank presence in Canada, but the availability of 
branches nationwide is also mentioned as an opportunity for 
players such as Citibank, which don\'t have a retail presence 
in Canada. 
 
6.  (U) Note:  U.S. banks in Canada welcome the uncertainty 
over mergers, which they believe provides them with a 
competitive edge. Institutional clients tend to become more 
interested in partnering with a large US bank when asked if 
they  really want their financing from an institution that 
may or may not be dealing with a major merger in the near 
future.  End note. 
 
Lack of Majority in Parliament may not prevent movement 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
7.  (U) Conventional wisdom has held that approval of bank 
mergers would be extremely unlikely in the context of a 
minority government and banks had been focusing their 
lobbying efforts on the upcoming review of the Bank Act in 
2006.  In October, the head of the House of Commons finance 
committee said \"mergers between Canada\'s big banks and 
insurers are \"going to happen\" if the financial sector 
requests it, but bank-bank mergers have been more sensitive 
given the limited number (six) of large national banks. 
Although the opposition Conservative party contains an 
anti-big bank element, leaders such as Steven Harper and 
Finance Critic Monte Solberg recognize the need for financial 
sector efficiency. 
 
8.  (U) Solberg\'s position is that they would like to see 
bank mergers and think that \"the industry and Canadians 
deserve\" the benefits.  However, the Conservative party would 
want to see the specific proposals and have each case 
considered on an issue-by-issue basis. (Comment:  leaving 
open the possibility of objections in specific cases.  End 
comment.)  The negotiations needed to gain support from 
opposition parties in a minority government could, in fact, 
facilitate the decision by providing cover for the governing 
Liberal party. Governor Dodge\'s comments, the coverage given 
to the IMF statement, and the apparent willingness of the 
parties to work together on a range of issues in parliament 
may bring the merger issue back into play.

1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  For USG use only. 
 
2. (U)  Summary: In a December 9 speech, Bank of Canada 
Governor David Dodge characterized the provinces\' proposed 
\"passport\" system of securities regulation (Ref A) as 
\"unworkable.\"  While \"declining to weigh in\" on the debate 
over a national securities regulator, the Governor said that 
\"efficiency does dictate that Canada should have uniform 
securities laws and regulations.\"  In post-speech remarks, 
Dodge also called for stronger steps to crack down on the 
perception that Canada\'s financial markets are a \"Wild West,\" 
a sensationalist comment that could go far to build public 
support for reform. 
 
3. (U) Finance Minister Ralph Goodale, responding to 
questions on Dodge\'s remarks, said the federal government 
does not have infinite patience to wait for the provinces to 
establish a single securities regulator.  Dodge and Goodale 
have subsequently received support from parliament and the 
IMF.  The House Finance Committee has called for 
implementation of a national securities regulator by June 30, 
2005 and the IMF said that adopting a single national 
securities regulator \"would reduce compliance and 
administrative costs,\" a statement that headlined reporting 
in a national newspaper.  These comments by top financial 
officials and the IMF signal a new focus on long-pending 
issues in the financial sector. (Dodge\'s comments on bank 
mergers are being reported septel.)  End summary. 
 
BOC Governor leads the offensive 
-------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU)  Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge strayed from 
his prepared remarks on Financial System Efficiency to 
characterize the provinces\' proposed passport system (ref A) 
as \"unworkable.\"  While declining to weigh in on the debate 
over a national securities regulator, the Governor (returning 
to his text) said that \"efficiency does dictate that Canada 
should have uniform securities laws and regulations.\"  Given 
the limited size, depth and liquidity of Canada\'s financial 
markets, he said, they must compensate with greater relative 
efficiency.  Our contacts in the financial sector welcome 
Dodge\'s voice in the debate and believe that he would be 
unlikely to address an issue as contentious as this (and one 
that is not strictly in his jurisdiction) without some 
coordination with the Department of Finance.  As Paul 
Martin\'s former deputy at the ministry of finance, Dodge is 
assumed to reflect the Prime Minister\'s views. 
 
Lawless Capital Markets? 
------------------------ 
 
5. (U) Press reports have seized on Dodge\'s post-speech 
statement that foreigners have a perception that Canada\'s 
capital markets are \"a Wild West.\"  The head of the Canadian 
Securities Administration disputed the claim, saying Canada\'s 
securities regulation does not lag that in the U.S., but 
admitted that the perception that Canada isn\'t tough enough 
is \"becoming a reality.\"  Working-levels at the federal 
Department of Finance also regret the phrase, saying it 
distracts from the real issue. 
 
6. (SBU)  Comment:  A colleague at ConGen Toronto with long 
experience of Canada\'s financial sector offers a somewhat 
Machiavellian interpretation, pointing out that Dodge, of 
course, does not consider Canada\'s capital markets to be 
lawless.  Buy tossing such headline-grabbing rhetoric into 
the public debate, the BOC Governor has put supporters of the 
status quo on the defensive and planted the seed in the 
public\'s mind that securities regulation might, in fact, need 
reform.  No one with whom we spoke believes Dodge would speak 
inadvertently on such a sensitive issue.  End comment. 
 
Feds More Active in Support of a National Securities 
Regulator? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (SBU) Asked about Dodge\'s remarks on securities 
regulation, current Minister of Finance Ralph Goodale said 
December 9 that the federal government does not have infinite 
patience to wait for the provinces to establish a single 
securities regulator.  Although Goodale has made clear his 
longstanding support for a single securities regulator, the 
comment, made during a media scrum after Parliament\'s 
question period, was unexpected. (He was \"not shooting from 
the hip, but not well-scripted,\" in the words of an official 
at Finance). 
8. (SBU) A Department of Finance official confirmed that 
Minister Goodale\'s remarks reflect the tenor of internal 
discussions.  The recent arrival of Deputy Minister Ian 
Bennett (from the IMF) and Senior Associate Deputy Minister 
Mark Carney (from Goldman Sachs via the Bank of Canada) has 
added new energy to the debate on how to move towards a 
single national securities regulator.  Both are reportedly 
\"keenly interested\" in moving the process forward. The 
minister\'s advisors have pointed out to him that although the 
business community must take primary responsibility for 
convincing provincial securities regulators of the need for a 
single regulator, he had not spoken on the subject since his 
March budget message and needed to be more engaged.  In their 
pre-budget consultations with interested parties in each 
province over the coming weeks, senior officials at Finance 
will be pushing for support for a single regulator.  Those 
involved with this issue over the decades feel that lack of 
progress by the end of this year (or the fiscal year and new 
budget in March) would once again derail the single regulator 
debate (ref B). 
 
Parliament is on board, sort of 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) The House of Commons Finance Committee\'s position 
paper in response to the GOC\'s pre-budget consultations, 
released December 20, strongly endorses adoption of a 
national securities regulator \"no later than 30 June 2005.\" 
In a minority-party supplementary opinion, the opposition 
Conservative party seconded that view in the context of 
increasing productivity and streamlining regulations, 
criticizing the Liberals for lack of progress thus far.  In a 
dissenting opinion, the Bloc Quebecois reiterated that a 
Canadian securities commission would be \"completely 
unacceptable to Quebec.\"  (Note:  Ref B describes the more 
nuanced view of Quebec\'s financial regulators.  End note.) 
The NDP stuck to fiscal concerns and did not refer to 
securities regulation. 
 
And the IMF joins in 
-------------------- 
 
10. (U) The IMF\'s Preliminary Conclusions on Canada\'s 2005 
Article IV Consultation, released December 20, highlights the 
desirability of single securities regulator in the context of 
further regulatory reform.  Noting that both \"the banking and 
insurance sectors have posted a remarkable performance in 
recent years,\" it adds that improvements such as clarifying 
the framework for bank mergers (septel) and adopting a single 
national regulator, \"as recommended by the Wise Persons 
Committee,\" (Ref C) would reduce compliance and 
administrative costs.  The report received prominent coverage 
in the business section of all the major papers, and adds to 
the base of support for progress on this decades-old issue. 
 
Ontario pleased but not optimistic 
---------------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) An official at the Ontario Securities Commission 
(OSC) found Governor Dodge\'s comments positive, but doesn\'t 
believe the dynamic has changed.  The OSC also felt that 
Finance Minister Goodale\'s remarks in support of a national 
regulator would carry more weight if the Liberals had a 
majority in Parliament and could thus be counted on to carry 
through on initiatives.  (However, the Liberals and 
Conservatives together do have a healthy parliamentary 
majority.) 
 
12. (SBU) Ontario, the only province that did not endorse the 
MOU on the passport system for the 13 provincial and 
territorial regulators (Ref A), is calling for more definite 
commitment to move towards a national regulator.  However, on 
the theory that any improvement is helpful, the OSC is still 
committed to bringing about the planned August 1, 2005 
implementation of the passport system.  Ontario\'s Finance 
Minister remains very interested in engaging securities 
regulators in the other provinces to build momentum for a 
single regulator and hopes to announce an expert study group 
on the subject in February.  However, it is not clear that 
any of the other provinces are on board.  Ontario regulators 
see Alberta, fresh from provincial elections, as stable in 
the coming year but believe officials in British Columbia 
will be distracted by elections there in May.  Quebec\'s 
position is consistent, and officials there won\'t be engaging 
in the process. 
13. (SBU) A Canadian Bankers\' Association expert who follows 
the issue closely considers Dodge\'s comments \"a big step, not 
your typical Central Bank Governor\'s statement.\"  He said 
Dodge is \"deliberately pushing the envelope.\" He interprets 
Goodale\'s comments as prodding the provincial regulators, 
showing that the Federal government is willing to play a more 
active role in the debate.  Members of Toronto\'s financial 
sector told us last spring that if there was not progress on 
the proposals in the Wise Persons Committee report by the end 
of this year, the issue would lose momentum and fade away. 
It will still be a slow and difficult process, but the recent 
flurry of activity does support the Ontario Securities 
Commission\'s lonely push for a single regulator and the 
private sector\'s efforts with provincial regulators.

1. (C) POL M/C followed up on our December 13 conversation 
(Ref B) with Foreign Affairs Deputy Director for 
Non-Proliferation, Terry Wood on December 23. Canada remains 
strongly in favor of a two-term limit.  However, it did not 
have a candidate of its own and others rumored to be 
interested in running for the IAEA Director General position 
had not been nominated.  Unless ElBaradei bows out, it was 
unlikely that anyone would be nominated prior to the December 
31 deadline.  Furthermore, Canada\'s sense was that support 
for him  was growing, especially within the G-77, but also 
including France, Germany, Russia, and Belgium.  He is close 
to having the support he needs to be re-elected and the G-77, 
confident that the votes can be rounded up, is apparently 
pressing for an early vote. Canada does not yet see where the 
twelve votes needed to oppose his bid for a third term would 
come from. 
 
2.  (C) The key factor, according to Wood, is how forcefully 
the U.S. willing to fight in an attempt to turn things 
around.  Thus far, the U.S. has made its views known publicly 
and privately, but without going after ElBaradei, who is 
viewed as competent and relatively effective by much of the 
IAEA membership.  Any serious effort to force him out would 
leave blood on the floor and might not be successful. 
Lastly, one consideration was that a divisive and protracted 
fight would likely have negative consequences for the 
Agency\'s ability to carry out its responsibilities.

SUBJECT: CANADIAN DIP NOTE EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT 
CONGESTION AT TORONTO PRECLEARANCE 
 
 
1. Summary: The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
delivered a diplomatic note (no. NUE-0139) to Acting Econ M/C 
and Dept. of Homeland Security (DHS) Attache on December 22, 
expressing concern about congestion at the Toronto 
preclearance facility and requesting that DHS take steps to 
reduce the congestion.  Text of the note is provided below in 
paragraph 2 and talking points used by DFA Director Bruce 
Levy  are provided in paragraph 3.  Copies of attachments 
referred to in the note will be forwarded to WHA/CAN and DHS. 
 DHS Attache Considine gave Levy an update on recent measures 
that have been taken by DHS to address the problem of 
congestion (see paragraph 4).  Levy expressed appreciation 
for those measures and said the GOC would monitor conditions 
at Toronto in hopes of continued improvement.  Post requests 
that Dept provide text of a diplomatic note for response to 
DFA, as needed, and updates on any additional steps DHS may 
take to reduce congestion at the Toronto preclearance 
facility.  End Summary. 
 
2. TEXT OF GOC NOTE NO. NUE-0139 
 
Foreign Affairs Canada presents its compliments to the 
Embassy of the United States of America and has the honour to 
refer to the attached materials which collectively document a 
serious and growing problem with congestion at preclearance 
facilities at Toronto,s Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport (PIA), Canada,s most important gateway for 
cross-border air travel. 
 
The Department has the further honour to note that 
transborder passengers, including a large number of United 
States citizens and permanent residents, are experiencing 
substantial and growing delays when being processed through 
preclearance at Terminals 2 and 3 at PIA, especially at early 
morning peak-hour times.  Delays result in long line-ups in 
front of the preclearance areas as well as terminal 
congestion, flight cancellations, missed flights and missed 
connections. 
 
Canadian authorities are concerned that the Greater Toronto 
Airports Authority might have to ration access to 
preclearance during peak hours of cross-border traffic, or 
that United States preclearance officers might do so.  Such a 
development would be contrary to the spirit and intent of the 
2001 Agreement on Air Transport Preclearance and would hinder 
the ability of Canadian and United States airlines to take 
full advantage of the 1995 Agreement on Air Transport. 
 
Canadian authorities recognize that United States authorities 
are giving serious attention to this issue.  Canadian 
authorities also wish to express their appreciation for the 
efforts by United States preclearance officers to try to 
accommodate this congestion, including a pilot project to 
open preclearance a half hour earlier, that is at 4:30 a.m. 
at Terminal 3 on Mondays.  Canadian authorities also 
appreciate that preclearance at Terminal 3 will open at 4:30 
a.m. during the December 17-25 peak travel period.  The pilot 
should be extended indefinitely to cover the full week and to 
include Terminal 2.  It is clear, however, that this will not 
be sufficient.  Canadian authorities therefore also ask that 
the number of preclearance officers at Terminals 2 and 3 be 
increased on an urgent basis.  These steps should be 
considered as a matter of high priority to avoid a further 
deterioration of an already difficult situation. 
 
Foreign Affairs Canada avails itself of this opportunity to 
renew to the Embassy of the United States of America the 
assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
Ottawa, December 22, 2004 
 
End text of diplomatic note. 
 
3. CANADIAN TALKING POINTS ON PRECLEARANCE CONGESTION AT 
TORONTO 
 
--    We understand that CBP sent a &jump team8 to look 
into the preclearance congestion problem at Toronto. 
 
--    Congestion at preclearance at Toronto,s Terminals 2 
and 3 has important implications because Toronto accounts for 
approximately 40% of cross-border traffic and is a network 
hub. 
 
--    Average processing time at preclearance has increased 
since 9/11.  This is understandable and by itself has not 
been a problem because of the sharp decline in traffic after 
9/11.  Recently, however, transborder traffic has recently 
recovered sharply. 
 
--    The attachments to the Note are analyses of this 
problem by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), TBI 
Canada (the manager of Terminal 3), Air Canada and Air 
Transat.  Each has taken a different approach but they are 
consistent in identifying the serious negative impact of 
congestion at preclearance. 
 
--    Post-clearance would not be a practical solution 
because the GTAA would not be able to provide sufficient 
international gates or check-in counters which are already 
congested.  The availability of landing slots at certain 
United States airports is also an issue. 
 
--    Shifting flights from peak hours to off-peak hours 
would disrupt Canadian and US airlines, schedules.  It would 
also be inconvenient for travelers and undermine Toronto,s 
role as Canada,s most important gateway for cross-border 
traffic. 
 
--    Rationing of preclearance would raise issues of equity 
and competitiveness for any Canadian and US airlines that 
might be denied preclearance during peak hours. 
 
--    We recognize that preclearance officers are doing their 
best to cope with a demanding situation.  This might explain 
what we understand is an increasing absenteeism rate among 
preclearance officers.  Increasing the capacity of 
preclearance would be beneficial to all concerned. 
 
End text of Canadian talking points. 
 
4. DHS RESPONSE ON CONGRESTION AT TORONTO PRECLEARANCE 
FACILITY 
 
In response to the Canadian diplomatic note and expression of 
concern, DHS Attache, John Considine, provided Levy an update 
on recent measures institute by DHS to address the problem of 
congestion at Toronto\'s preclearance facility.  A summary of 
those comments follows: 
 
-- In the last month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has 
taken vigorous action in response to problems with passenger 
queuing, delayed flights and missed embarkations at the 
preclearance operation in Toronto. 
 
-- CBP sent a team of experienced personnel to Toronto to 
review operations and to determine what actions could be 
taken to improve service. 
 
-- As a result of that review, CBP has replaced its top 
managers on site with a new team of individuals with 
experience in air preclearance operations, from both a 
customs and immigration perspective.  These three individuals 
will be in place for 60 to 90 days until new permanent 
management is assigned. 
 
-- The new managers have been tasked with taking any action 
necessary to ensure increased efficiency of operations while 
still maintaining a strong security posture.  Changes in 
assignment of work hours and overtime, more effective use of 
personnel, and training of all personnel in both immigration 
and customs issues are among the first issues to be 
addressed.  Twelve new inspectors have been selected to 
report to Toronto and are in the process of being approved 
for foreign assignment. 
 
-- After improvements with the CBP workforce are under way, 
the new CBP managers will work with the airport and airline 
management to see what logistical and scheduling changes 
might be made to increase efficiency of the airport 
operations.  While it is understood that flight times are 
chosen to optimize scheduling at both the departure and 
arrival airports, there are physical limits to the current 
configuration of the inspectional area.  CBP cannot solve 
these delays alone. 
 
5.  Action Requested:  Request that Department provide text 
of response to DFA\'s diplomatic note, as needed.  Post would 
also appreciate continued attention to this problem by State 
and DHS, and updates on any additional measures that may be 
taken by CBP to reduce congestion at the Toronto preclearance 
facility.

Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, reasons 1.4 (b 
) (d) 
 
(S) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Wendy Gilmour, Deputy 
Director in the Regional Security and Peacekeeping Division 
of Foreign Affairs Canada.  Gilmour said that they were 
expecting the demarche and were leaning in the \"favorable\" 
direction in terms of helping.  There were several caveats, 
however, that she wanted us to be aware of up front.  First, 
Canada does not blend SOF and CIMIC missions, it is 
doctrinally opposed to doing so and its forces are simply not 
configured to do CIMIC missions while waiting for direct 
action the way U.S. Special Forces are.  So a unit deployed 
to fulfill this request would not be able to do the soft 
tasks that we suggest, they would be trigger pullers only and 
would be deployed to pull triggers.  Second, Canada would 
need to look closely at the required support structure for 
the force.  She assumed it would be based in Bagram Air Base 
where the majority of SOF forces are.  This would require a 
logistical support structure to sustain the new force and the 
GOC would need to look closely at cost and requirements. 
Third, while the force is ready to go and would prefer this 
mission to other options (e.g. ISAF), its main priority is 
currently to pave the way for the introduction of a Canadian 
PRT in Khandahar.  This would have priority over any new 
missions and Canada would need to ensure it would have 
adequate forces to do both.  Gilmour promised to get back to 
us and asked if the same demarche would be made in military 
channels.  Poloff answered that it would.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PGOV, CA, Danny Williams, Newfoundland and Labrador 
SUBJECT: NEWFOUNDLAND\'S PREMIER ORDERS CANADIAN FLAGS 
LOWERED ON PROVINCIAL BUILDINGS 
 
REF: OTTAWA 2896 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland and 
Labrador took the unusual step of ordering the Canadian Flag 
removed from all provincial buildings on Thursday, December 
23.  Williams was reacting to another failure to negotiate a 
deal with the Federal government on offshore oil revenue and 
equalization transfer payments, and contends that PM Martin 
broke his word, leaving Newfoundland and Labrador yet again 
on the short end of the federal-provincial stick.  While 
Newfoundland and Labrador thrive on a sense of historical 
alienation and the move may play well locally, it could also 
serve to generate ill will for his cause nationally.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
2. (SBU) Premier Danny Williams of Newfoundland and Labrador 
ordered that the Canadian Flag be removed from all provincial 
buildings on Thursday, December 23.  Williams was reacting to 
another failure to negotiate a deal with the Federal 
government on offshore oil revenue and equalization transfer 
payments.  The cities of St. John\'s and Corner Brook have 
joined the Premier by ordering that the Canadian flag be 
removed from municipal buildings, and Mount Pearl, a bedroom 
community of St. John,s, raised a pre-confederation 
Newfoundland flag.  To the best of post,s knowledge this is 
the first time in the recent past that a province has lowered 
the Canadian flag in a protest against the Canadian 
government. 
 
3. (SBU) Premier Williams and Premier John Hamm of Nova 
Scotia were invited to Winnipeg, Manitoba last week to 
negotiate an offshore petroleum revenue deal with Federal 
Finance Minister Ralph Goodale and Natural Resources Minister 
John Effort.  Williams left the meetings on December 22 very 
unhappy with the government,s proposal, stating &they have 
slapped us in the face at Christmas time. I can tell you we 
will not forget this, believe me.8  He immediately returned 
to Newfoundland and called a press conference where he 
announced the lowering of the Canadian flag.  Williams has 
not been quoted on the issue since the press conference. 
(NOTE: Minister Effort is the only Federal cabinet minister 
from Newfoundland. He has supported the Prime Minister on 
this issue, while other Liberal backbench MPs from 
Newfoundland have not. END NOTE) 
 
4. (SBU) PM Martin has responded strongly to the Premier,s 
actions, calling it &disrespectful8 and stating that the 
flag should not be used as a tool for partisan politics. 
Opposition Leader Harper has previously noted his general 
support for Premiers Williams and Hamm in their fight with 
the Feds and states that the problem is an example of the 
Prime Minister,s &chronic inability to make a decision.8 
He has, however, been conspicuously silent since the flag 
lowering. 
 
5. (SBU) William,s argument is that PM Martin broke his word 
in a deal he made with the Premier to change the offshore oil 
revenue transfer payment formula, and says this is only the 
latest example of an ongoing pattern of Newfoundland and 
Labrador getting bad deals from the Federal Government. 
Other historical examples, Williams contends, include 
hydro-electric power, fishing rights, and mineral rights. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: Premier Williams may be taking this 
dramatic action to further solidify local public opinion, and 
by using the Canadian flag he gains a national stage for the 
offshore revenue issue as well.  Newfoundland and Labrador 
possess a sense of historical alienation as a resource rich 
province that is stuck in have-not status and Political 
Science Professor Stephen Tomblin of Memorial University in 
St. John\'s predicts that Williams\' local popularity will only 
grow as a result of this recent action.  But bringing the 
flag into the debate also raises the risk of creating 
ill-will among potential supporters elsewhere, and could make 
it difficult for other provincial premiers or federal 
officials to support him in the future.

SUBJECT: SCENE-SETTER FOR ASD/HD VISIT TO OTTAWA, CANADA, 
11-13 JAN 05 (U) 
 
1. (U) THIS MESSAGE IS A READAHEAD FOR THE 11-13 JANUARY 2005 
VISIT TO OTTAWA OF ASST SECDEF (HOMELAND DEFENSE) PAUL 
MCHALE; DASD SCOTT ROWELL; AND NORTHCOM CHIEF OF STAFF MG 
FRED REES.  RECOMMENDED TALKING POINTS AT PARA 8. 
 
2. (C) CANADA-U.S. POL-MIL RELATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER PAUL 
MARTIN LEADS A MINORITY GOVERNMENT WHICH MUST MOVE FORWARD 
CAUTIOUSLY ON POLICY ISSUES AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE 
VIEWS OF THE OPPOSITION BEFORE PROCEEDING. PM MARTIN HAS 
GIVEN STRONG SIGNALS HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF AND 
WISHES TO IMPROVE CANUS RELATIONS. SHORTLY AFTER TAKING 
OFFICE LAST DECEMBER, PM MARTIN ESTABLISHED A NEW CABINET 
COMMITTEE ON U.S.-CANADA RELATIONS WHICH HE CHAIRS, 
ESTABLISHED A DHS-LIKE HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT (DEPT OF 
PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CANADA) HEADED BY 
THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER, DEVOTED MORE RESOURCES FOR BORDER 
AND MARITIME SECURITY, AND TIGHTER IMMIGRATION SCREENING.  IN 
APRIL, 2004 HE PUBLISHED CANADA\'S FIRST-EVER NATIONAL 
SECURITY POLICY WHICH FOCUSES ON: 
 
A. (U) PROTECTING CANADA AND CANADIANS AT HOME AND ABROAD; 
B. (U) ENSURING CANADA IS NOT A BASE FOR THREATS TO OUR 
ALLIES; 
C. (U) CONTRIBUTING TO INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
MARTIN ALSO PUSHED THROUGH THE AMENDMENT TO THE NORAD 
AGREEMENT, ALLOWING NORAD TO PERFORM THREAT WARNING 
(INTEGRATED TACTICAL WARNING/ATTACK ASSESSMENT) FOR THE 
MISSILE DEFENSE MISSION.  STILL, WHEN POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT 
DURING THE SPRING 2004 ELECTION SEASON, HIS CAMPAIGN RHETORIC 
FOCUSED ON DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN CANADA AND THE U.S. IN 
ORDER TO BUILD ROOM BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE CONSERVATIVES WHO 
SUPPORT MUCH STRONGER TIES TO THE U.S. AND A MORE PROGRESSIVE 
DEFENSE AND SECURITY RELATIONSHIP. 
 
2. (U) PRO-U.S. DEFENSE MINISTER DAVID PRATT LOST HIS 
PARLIAMENT SEAT IN THE JUNE 2004 ELECTION AND WAS REPLACED BY 
THE HONORABLE WILLIAM GRAHAM, THE OUTGOING FOREIGN MINISTER. 
GRAHAM MOVED TO DEFENSE WITH A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
STRATEGIC DEFENSE AND SECURITY ISSUES FACING CANADA.  ONE OF 
GRAHAM\'S STRENGTHS IS THAT HE IS WELL KNOWN IN NATO CIRCLES 
AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE IN MINISTERIALS AND DEALING WITH NATO 
ISSUES. HE HAS SPENT THE LAST SIX MONTHS LEARNING THE DEFENSE 
BUREAUCRACY AND LEADING A DEFENSE REVIEW.  HE ALSO SHOWED 
GOOD JUDGMENT WHEN HE CHOSE SEASONED CANADIAN BUREAUCRAT WARD 
ELCOCK AS HIS DEPUTY MINISTER (ELCOCK WAS FORMERLY HEAD OF 
CSIS - CANADIAN CIA EQUIVALENT).  GRAHAM HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN 
ON THE NEED FOR CANADA TO PARTICIPATE IN MISSILE DEFENSE. 
 
3. (U) CANADIAN DEFENSE SPENDING.  DUE TO PRESSURE FROM 
DEFENSE INTEREST GROUPS AND ECHOING CALLS BY U.S. AMBASSADOR 
PAUL CELLUCCI DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS, A GENERAL 
RECOGNITION IS SETTLING INTO THE CANADIAN BODY POLITIC THAT 
DEFENSE HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR TOO LONG AND MAJOR 
REINVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED. INCREASED DEFENSE FUNDING HAS 
EMERGED AS AN OFTEN-DISCUSSED POLITICAL AND EDITORIAL ISSUE. 
WHILE PM MARTIN HAS ANNOUNCED NEW DEDICATED FUNDING FOR 
MISSIONS ABROAD AND FUNDED SOME NEW ACQUISITION PROGRAMS, THE 
CANADIAN DEFENSE BUDGET IS STILL WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED AND 
NEAR THE BOTTOM OF NATO MEMBERS IN DEFENSE SPENDING (1.1% 
GDP). 
 
4. (C) CANADIAN FORCES BACKGROUND.  A 20-YEAR LEGACY OF 
UNDERFUNDING AND REPEATED DEPLOYMENTS ON PEACEKEEPING 
OPERATIONS HAVE GENERALLY GUTTED THE CANADIAN FORCES. 
CAPITAL ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS ARE RAIDED ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO 
SUSTAIN O&M REQUIREMENTS.  BOTH EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL ARE 
STRETCHED.  A STRENGTH OF 82,000 IN 1990 HAS ATROPHIED TO 
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 50,000, OF WHICH ROUGHLY 19,000 IS 
DEPLOYABLE.  THE RESERVES CANNOT DEPLOY AS UNITS, EVEN DOWN 
TO THE COMPANY LEVEL, AND ARE PRIMARILY USED AS A LABOR POOL 
AUGMENTING REGULAR FORCES ON BOTH DOMESTIC AND OVERSEAS 
OPERATIONS.  NEVERTHELESS, THE QUALITY OF CANADIAN FORCES 
LEADERSHIP AND PERSONNEL AT ALL RANKS KEEPS THE FORCES GOING. 
  PM MARTIN ANNOUNCED CANADA WOULD ADD 5,000 ACTIVE SOLDIERS 
AND 3,000 RESERVISTS; HOWEVER, THESE SOLDIERS WOULD BASICALLY 
JUST ROUND OUT THREE UNDER-MANNED BRIGADES AND THEY WILL TAKE 
UP TO SIX YEARS TO BE RECRUITED, TRAINED, AND FIELDED. 
 
5. (C) CURRENT AND PROJECTED FORCE DEPLOYMENTS.  THE CANADIAN 
FORCES ARE JUST ENDING A SERIES OF MAJOR INTERNATIONAL 
COMMITMENTS THAT LEAVES THE FORCES WITH LITTLE CURRENT 
DEPLOYABLE COMBAT CAPABILITY. MAJOR DEPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS 
(FROM ISAF IV - V LEADERSHIP IN AFGHANISTAN AND HAITI) TOOK 
PLACE IN AUGUST 2004, AS THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE ENTERED INTO 
A ONE YEAR \'OPERATIONAL PAUSE\' TO RECONSTITUTE THEIR FORCES. 
CANADA HAS NUMEROUS OPERATIONS ABROAD, BUT THEY REFER TO THE 
DEPLOYMENT OF EVEN ONE SOLDIER OR LNO AS AN &OPERATION.8 
CURRENTLY DEPLOYED FORCES (SPRING 2004 LEVEL; *AIR FORCE 
DEPLOYMENT): 
 
AFGHANISTAN ) 700 (DOWN FROM 2300) 
SFOR - 80 (DOWN FROM 650) 
HAITI - 100 CIVILIAN RCMP POLICE (VICE 500 SOLDIERS) 
GOLAN HEIGHTS (UN OBSERVERS/LOGISTICIAN) - 225 (225) 
AFRICA - 20 (20) 
ARABIAN GULF/OEF-DEPLOYED WITH GW CSG - 0 (WAS 225) 
*ARABIAN GULF C-130 TRANSPORT DETACHMENT - 200 (DOWN FROM 240) 
6. (C/NF) CANADIAN MILITARY FORCES CAPABILITIES:  WHAT LIES 
AHEAD.  ALL SERVICES OF THE CANADIAN FORCES ARE STRETCHED AND 
OVER-TASKED, SURVIVING PRIMARILY ON THE QUALITY OF THEIR 
PEOPLE.  INSIDERS INVOLVED WITH DEFENSE ISSUES BELIEVE THAT 
CANADA IS STILL UNABLE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THE KINDS OF 
CHOICES IT MUST MAKE IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS MILITARY FROM 
BECOMING IRRELEVANT.  WHILE SMALL NUMBERS OF HIGHLY CAPABLE 
FORCES EXIST, SUCH AS JTF-2 TIER-1 SOF COUNTER-TERRORISM 
FORCES (LESS THAN 300 SOLDIERS OF WHICH ABOUT 150 ARE 
TRIGGER-PULLERS), CANADA IS UNWILLING TO MOVE INTO THE NICHE 
AREAS WHICH THE BUDGET CAN SUPPORT.  FOR THE FORESEEABLE 
FUTURE, CANADIAN FORCES WILL REMAIN AROUND 50,000 - CERTAINLY 
NOT EXCEEDING 60,000.  EVEN WITH A DOUBLING OF THE DEFENSE 
BUDGET, CANADA COULD NOT RECAPITALIZE ITS EXISTING FORCE 
STRUCTURE FOR PERHAPS 15 YEARS, AND NO ONE PREDICTS THOSE 
SORT OF FUNDING LEVELS (UNLESS PERHAPS IN THE UNFORTUNATE 
EVENT CANADA WERE TO EXPERIENCE A MAJOR 9-11 TYPE ATTACK). 
GIVING UP ON MAJOR MISSION AREAS, SUCH AS AN OPERATIONAL BLUE 
WATER NAVY (AND MOVING TO SUPPORT/TRANSPORT AND 200 MILE 
SECURITY MISSIONS), IS THE ONLY WAY CANADA CAN FULLY FUND AND 
SUPPORT OPERATIONS WITH EXISTING (OR FORECAST) BUDGETS.  THE 
CURRENT DND LEADERSHIP IS VERY NAVY-HEAVY, SO THIS IS 
EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. CANADA SEEMS DESTINED TO HOBBLE ALONG 
WITH ONE OF THE SMALLEST MILITARIES IN THE WORLD TO FIELD A 
COMPLETE ARMY, NAVY, AND AIR FORCE.  THE FACT OF THE MATTER 
IS CANADIAN FORCES AND THE DEFENSE BUDGET HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED 
SO LONG THERE IS NO WAY WITHIN THE CURRENT CANADIAN POLITICAL 
CONTEXT AND WITH COMPETING BUDGETARY PRESSURES FOR THEM TO 
RETURN TO PREVIOUS CAPABILITIES.  IF THE CURRENT TREND OF 
SALAMI-SLICING THE BUDGET CONTINUES, IT WILL RESULT IN THE 
CANADIAN FORCES BECOMING MORE AND MORE A DOMESTIC, 
CONTINENTAL/HOMELAND DEFENSE FORCES.  THE CANADIAN AIR FORCE 
WHICH JUST 15 YEARS AGO HAD TWO ROBUST BASES IN GERMANY CAN 
NO LONGER DEPLOY MORE THAN FOUR TO SIX CF-18S AND WOULD HAVE 
DIFFICULTY REPEATING ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE BALKANS.  WITH 
LESS THAN 100 ACTIVE FIGHTER PILOTS AND AN INVENTORY FALLING 
TO 50 AVAILABLE  FIGHTERS, THE NORAD MISSION IS ABOUT ALL THE 
CANADIAN AIR FORCE CAN HANDLE.  TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT ARE IN 
EVEN WORSE SHAPE AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER TEN YEARS, 
CANADA DOES NOT HAVE A FRIGATE FLOATING WITH A U.S. CARRIER 
GROUP.  EXPECT THE CANADIAN FORCES TO BE UNABLE TO SUSTAIN 
MORE THAN 2,000 SOLDIERS DEPLOYED WORLDWIDE EVEN AFTER FEB 
2006. 
 
7. (U) CURRENT MILITARY RELATED ISSUES: 
 
A. (U) HOMELAND DEFENSE.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS INAUGURATION, 
THE PM CREATED A NEW MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY 
PREPAREDNESS CANADA (PSEPC), AN INSTITUTION ANALOGOUS TO THE 
U.S. DEPT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.  THE AGENCY\'S GOAL IS TO 
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND COORDINATE EMERGENCY 
RESPONSES. ALTHOUGH THE LINES OF AUTHORITY OF THIS MINISTRY 
ARE STILL BEING DRAWN AND THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED ON INTERNAL 
ORGANIZATION THAN STANDING UP A WORKING ORGANIZATION, IT 
ALREADY HAS ESTABLISHED LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH 
COUNTERPART USG AGENCIES, ALBEIT WITHOUT THE SAME SENSE OF 
URGENCY. 
 
B.  (U) MARITIME SECURITY.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS SLOWLY CHANGING, 
CANADA\'S MARITIME SECURITY STRUCTURE HAS BEEN ADMINISTERED IN 
AN UNCOORDINATED FASHION BETWEEN A PLETHORA OF GOVERNMENT 
AGENCIES. IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND 
RESPONSIBILITY, THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP) IS 
THE ONLY NATIONAL AGENCY WITH A DAY-TO-DAY, LEGISLATED 
MANDATE TO POLICE ALL TERRITORIAL CANADIAN WATERS.  IN SOME 
CIRCUMSTANCES, CANADIAN MARITIME FORCES (NAVY) CAN AND HAVE 
BEEN GIVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT POWERS AND BECOME INVOLVED IN 
MARITIME SECURITY OPERATIONS IF SPECIAL AUTHORITY IS GRANTED 
BY GOVERNMENT. THE CANADIAN COAST GUARD, ON THE OTHER HAND, 
IS A SUB-AGENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
(DFO), IS TASKED WITH A COLLECTION OF MARINE PROGRAMS AND 
SERVICE MISSIONS, AND DOES NOT FULFILL A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
FUNCTION.  BOTH THE CANADIAN COAST GUARD AND NAVY USUALLY 
PROVIDE THE PLATFORMS FOR RCMP AGENTS TO CONDUCT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT MISSIONS OFF THE CANADIAN COAST. SINCE THE 
INCEPTION OF CANADA\'S FIRST EVER NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY IN 
APRIL 2004, COLLECTIVELY THE NAVY, COAST GUARD, RCMP AND 
OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT THE DETAILS 
OF OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO MEET THE SPECTRUM OF 
OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE MARITIME SURVEILLANCE 
AND SECURITY OF CANADIAN WATERS.  CANADA WITH THE WORLD,S 
LONGEST COASTLINE MEASURING ALMOST 150 MILLION MILES IS 
WOEFULLY UNDER RESOURCED WHEN IT COMES TO NUMBERS OF MARITIME 
VESSELS AND APPROPRIATING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET 
DOLLARS. THE FIELDING (AND EVEN THE ACQUISITION PROCESS) OF 
FOUR USED SUBMARINES RECENTLY PURCHASED FROM THE UK IS BEING 
CALLED INTO QUESTION IN THE WAKE OF AN ACCIDENT (FIRE AT SEA) 
DURING THE MAIDEN VOYAGE TRANSIT TO CANADA OF ONE OF THE SUBS 
THAT CLAIMED THE LIFE OF A CANADIAN NAVAL OFFICER. A RECENT 
STUDY BY CANADA\'S SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND 
DEFENSE CONCLUDED, \"THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO END THE 
FRAGMENTED AND LARGELY AD HOC DEFENSE OF CANADA\'S COASTLINE\". 
 
C. (C/NF) MISSILE DEFENSE.  ON 5 AUG 04, CANADA ANNOUNCED 
THAT IT HAD AGREED TO AMEND THE NORAD AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE 
THE MISSILE DEFENSE THREAT WARNING AND ATTACK ASSESSMENT 
MISSION WITHIN NORAD.  THE MARTIN GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO 
KEEP THIS DECISION SEPARATE FROM MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM, A 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUE IN CANADA, WHERE SOME OPPOSITION PARTIES 
EQUATE MISSILE DEFENSE WITH WEAPONIZATION OF SPACE.  THERE IS 
A GOOD DEAL OF POLITICAL HAND-WRINGING IN THE WAKE OF 
PRESIDENT BUSH BRINGING UP MISSILE DEFENSE DURING HIS 30 
NOV-1 DEC 04 VISIT.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN RHETORIC FROM 
MARTIN WHICH DOWNPLAYED CANADIAN PARTICIPATION MISSILE 
DEFENSE, THE EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED ASSURANCES THAT THE ISSUE 
WILL LIKELY BE FAVORABLY TABLED EARLY IN THE NEW 
PARLIAMENTARY SESSION THIS SPRING. 
 
D. (C/RELCAN) NORAD RENEWAL/TRANSFORMATION. NEGOTIATIONS HAVE 
BEGUN FOR THE 2006 RENEWAL OF THE NORAD AGREEMENT. THERE IS 
AN APPETITE AMONG SOME, NORAD/NORTHCOM IN PARTICULAR ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE BORDER TO TRANSFORM NORAD INTO A MULTI-DOMAIN 
COMMAND, IN LIEU OF ITS 
CURRENT AEROSPACE CHARTER.  MANY ENVISION NORTH AMERICAN 
DEFENSE COMMAND WITH USNORTHCOM AS ITS U.S. COMPONENT.  THE 
BINATIONAL PLANNING GROUP HAS BEEN STUDYING NEW MISSION AREAS 
INCLUDING MARITIME 
SURVEILLANCE/DOMAIN AWARENESS, CROSS-BORDER MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES (MACA), CROSS-BORDER 
CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT, AND THE ADDITION OF THE MISSILE 
DEFENSE MISSION.  WHILE U.S. AND NORAD STAFFS ARE READY TO 
PROCEED WITH INCORPORATION OF THESE MISSIONS/TASKS. THE 
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT GIVEN THE MANDATE TO NEGOTIATING 
ENTITIES.  HOW FAR AND HOW FAST NORAD TRANSFORMS WILL BE 
DETERMINED DURING NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE COMING MONTHS, BUT 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO NORAD ARE CERTAINLY NOT ASSURED, GIVEN 
THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN OTTAWA. 
 
E. (C) NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY.  IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE 
CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED A NEW NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY 
THAT - WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED - WOULD INTEGRATE DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES TO ENHANCE AND ENSURE SAFETY AND 
SECURITY OF CANADIANS AND THEIR ALLIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY.   THE PROPOSED 690 MILLION CANADIAN 
DOLLARS (520 MILLION USD) INITIATIVE WILL FOCUS IN SIX KEY 
AREAS - INTELLIGENCE, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH, 
TRANSPORTATION, BORDER SECURITY, AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. 
PREVENTING ATTACKS UPON ALLIES (READ U.S.) FROM CANADIAN SOIL 
AND ENHANCING MARITIME SECURITY ARE TWO PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. 
THE NEW CANADIAN NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY IS AVAILABLE AT 
WWW/PCO-BCP.GC.CA.  SEARCH ON \'NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY\'. 
 
F. (C) DEFENSE REVIEW.   CANADA IS CONDUCTING BOTH 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY AND DEFENSE REVIEWS WHICH WERE 
EXPECTED BEFORE THE END OF CY2004.  DEFENSE MINISTER GRAHAM 
SAID TODAY THAT INFIGHTING BETWEEN FOREIGN AFFAIRS CANADA, 
DND, AND THE CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCY WILL LIKELY 
CAUSE A DELAY IN THE RELEASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY 
POLICY REVIEW UNTIL AT LEAST THE END OF JANUARY 2005, AND THE 
DEFENCE REVIEW WILL FOLLOW THAT.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE 
HAS NOT BEEN A FORMAL DEFENSE REVIEW SINCE THE 1994 WHITE 
PAPER, GRAHAM HAS NIXED A FORMAL REVIEW IN FAVOR OF AN 
INTERNALLY-STAFFED REVIEW (BY THE SAME ASST DEPUTY DEFENSE 
MINISTER FOR POLICY WHO AUTHORED THE 1994 REVIEW ) DR KEN 
CALDER). SOME BELIEVE THIS DEFENSE POLICY REVIEW IS SHAPING 
UP TO BE A WATERED DOWN DOCUMENT WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES OR NEW 
INVESTMENTS FOR THE FY05 BUDGET (APRIL 2005).  EXPECTED 
CHANGES INCLUDE:  MORE ROBUST MARITIME SURVEILLANCE AND 
SECURITY CAPABILITIES; IMPROVED C4ISR; STRATEGIC SEA AND 
AIRLIFT REQUIREMENTS; MORE SPECIAL FORCES; SOLDIER C3, 
MOBILITY EQUIPMENT, AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS MORE INTEROPERABLE 
WITH U.S. FORCES; AND A DRAMATIC DOWN-SIZING OF TANKS AND 
HEAVY ARTILLERY PLATFORMS. 
 
8. (U) RECOMMENDED THEMES AND TALKING POINTS FOR YOUR TALKS 
WITH DEFENSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICIALS: 
 
A. (U) WE NEED TO BRING MORE DOMAINS CRITICAL TO HOMELAND 
DEFENSE INTO A NORAD-LIKE STRUCTURE.  IT IS TIME TO 
INSTITUTIONALIZE THE FINE WORK OF THE BINATIONAL PLANNING 
GROUP (BPG) IN COLORADO SPRINGS.  I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT 
WE NEED TO ENHANCE OUR COOPERATION ON MARITIME DOMAIN 
AWARENESS AND MARITIME SECURITY. 
 
B. (U) WHAT OTHER DOMAINS DOES CANADA ENVISION AS APPROPRIATE 
FOR A TRANSFORMED NORAD? CYBER SECURITY?  MILITARY ASSISTANCE 
TO CIVIL AUTHORITIES?  CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT? 
 
C. (U) WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO BE THE MAJOR THEMES OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY POLICY REVIEW BEYOND CODIFYING YOUR 3D 
APPROACH) DIPLOMACY, DEFENSE, AND DEVELOPMENT? 
 
D. (U) WHAT DO YOU EXPECT WILL BE THE KEY FINDINGS OF YOUR 
DEFENCE REVIEW IN THE AREAS OF HOMELAND DEFENSE AND 
CONTINENTAL DEFENSE/SECURITY? 
 
E. (U) AS A RESULT OF THE TWO REVIEWS, WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT 
TO SEE MORE OF FROM CANADA IN THE COMING YEARS?  SPECIAL 
FORCES ) TIER 1 OR TIER 2?  STRATEGIC AIRLIFT?  COASTAL AND 
INLAND WATERWAY PATROLCRAFT?  ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE FOR 
HOMELAND DEFENSE?  UAV,S? 
 
F. (U) AS A RESULT OF THE DEFENSE REVIEW ARE THERE MISSION 
AREAS AND COMPETENCIES YOU EXPECT TO MOVE OUT OF OR 
DEEMPHASIZE (BEYOND HEAVY ARMOR)? 
 
G. (U) THE PERMANENT JOINT BOARD ON DEFENSE HAS A KEY ROLE IN 
OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP.  HAPPY TO SEE CANADA HAS A NEW AND 
ACTIVE CHAIR (JUDI LONGFIELD).  WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
RESULTS OF THE PJBD MEETING IN MARCH 2005. 
 
H. (U) AS PSEPC MOVES FORWARD IN ITS INTERAGENCY 
RELATIONSHIPS PLEASE CONSIDER ASD-HD AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN 
BENCHMARKING ALONG OTHER U.S. AGENCIES SUCH AS DHS.  WE ARE 
ALL IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING HOW TO FUSE THE RIGHT 
CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE HOMELAND DEFENSE MISSION.  ONE 
PLACE PSEPC LEADERS SHOULD DEFINITELY VISIT IS NORTHCOM AND 
THEIR INTERAGENCY COORDINATING GROUP.  ANOTHER IS JTF-CIVIL 
SUPPORT WHERE THEIR PLANNERS ARE DOING GREAT WORK IN 
DOCUMENTING BOTH CRITICAL AND SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN 
CASE OF A CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT EVENT.

TAGS: EAID, AEMR, CASC, CA, Tsunami, FAC 
SUBJECT: TFX001: CANADA RESPONDS QUICKLY TO TSUNAMIS 
 
1.  Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC) tells us that as of December 
29, three Canadians are confirmed dead, and approximately 60 
are still missing.  Of the three dead, two died in Thailand 
and one in Sri Lanka.  Forty-eight of the missing Canadians 
were in Thailand, with the majority of the rest missing from 
Sri Lanka.  Although volume is down today, FAC\'s emergency 
hotline is still busy, and of the original roughly 2000 
welfare/whereabouts inquiries received so far, 600 have been 
resolved.  FAC has called in 25 officers to respond to 
callers. 
 
Initial response 
---------------- 
 
2.  On December 26, Prime Minister Paul Martin issued a 
statement of condolence and pledged Canada\'s support.  The 
GOC promised an initial C$1 million (about US$800,000) in 
humanitarian assistance and followed up the next day with a 
further pledge of C$3 million (US$2.4 million). 
 
3.  The GOC has sent a CC-150 Polaris plane to Colombo 
(expected to land tomorrow) with essential emergency 
materials such as blankets, water tablets, and generators but 
does not yet have plans to mobilize the Canadian Forces 
Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), stating that no 
government has yet made a formal request for the mobile field 
hospital team.  The Canadian International Development Agency 
(CIDA) will assess the situation to determine what additional 
assistance will be required. 
 
Tragedy strikes close to home for many in Canada 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
4.  Canada\'s Diaspora from the affected region numbers in the 
hundreds of thousands.  FAC is directing private citizens who 
wish to donate money to contact the International Red Cross, 
OXFAM, and CARE Canada.  Private donations from Canadian 
residents and citizens have reached over C$3 million (US$2.4 
million) and are growing quickly.  NGOs are still being 
flooded with contributions.  Families with relatives in 
affected areas have been directed to contact the Department 
of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa at 1-800-387-3124, the hotline 
mentioned above.

STATE FOR TSUNAMI TASKFORCE 1, EAP AND WHA/CAN 
 
E.O. 12958: DECL: 12/30/2005 
TAGS: EAID, AEMR, CASC, CA, Tsunami 
SUBJECT: TFXO01: DECEMBER 30 UPDATE FROM OTTAWA 
 
REF: OTTAWA 03474 
 
Death toll likely to rise steeply 
-------------------------------- 
1.  (SBU)  The FAC emergency task force manager confirms that 
the number of Canadian deaths has risen to four.  The task 
force has opened welfare and whereabouts files on 2,500-3000 
cases, half of which remain unresolved.  They are beginning 
the process of calling back to see if some of the missing 
people have since been in touch.  Although they could not 
provide a range of likely total missing, noting that many of 
the W&W cases involve more than one person and that the 
volume of calls remains high, hundreds of Canadians who were 
known to be in the affected region are still unaccounted for 
and FAC expects many if not most of the missing to become 
deaths. 
 
Facilitated immigration 
----------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) has 
announced that after assisting FAC in providing emergency 
assistance, visa offices in Colombo, Bangkok, New Delhi and 
Jakarta will give priority consideration to immigration 
applications from those directly and significantly affected 
by the disaster and who have immediate family members in 
Canada.  For immigrant applications, applicants must contact 
CIC in writing and explain their circumstances.  Case-by-case 
consideration will be given to visitors, students and workers 
seeking to extend status in Canada if they are from the 
disaster area. 
 
And more money 
-------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  As has been conveyed by the Canadian Embassy to 
WHA/CAN, on December 30, GOC increased its pledged support 
for humanitarian aid after the earthquake and tsunamis to 
C$40 million (approximately US$32 million) and plans to send 
another planeload of emergency supplies to Indonesia, similar 
to the plane that left yesterday for Sri Lanka (reftel), and 
is expressing strong interest in being part of the Core 
Group.
