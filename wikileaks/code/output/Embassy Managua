E.O. 12958: DECL: 06/17/2014 
TAGS: EAID, PHUM, SOCI, NU, ECLAC, UN 
SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO ECLAC DEMARCHE: NICARAGUA WILL SUPPORT 
USG POSITION 
 
REF: STATE 120607 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Barbara C. Moore, Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Ambassador delivered demarche contained reftel to 
Nicaraguan Minister of Health Jose Antonio Alvarado.  After 
carefully reviewing the materials, Alvarado subsequently 
informed the Ambassador that he completely agreed with the US 
position.  He noted that though he is not likely to attend 
the San Juan meeting, he would make sure that the Nicaraguan 
delegation supported the US approach in Puerto Rico. 
 
2. (C) USAID Director then met with Secretary of the 
Presidency (SECEP) Mario De Franco and Vice Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Mauricio Gomez to follow up on Ambassador\'s 
earlier demarche and reiterate points contained reftel. Key 
points made to De Franco and Gomez were: (1) the proposed 
language points to an unqualified re-affirmation of the ICPD 
Cairo 1994 Program of Action, and the US, Nicaragua and many 
other LAC countries have, in fact, filed reservations with 
this language; (2) support for \"adolescent reproductive 
health services\" must be linked to parental rights and 
responsibilities and language about abstinence before 
marriage should be the preferred method/message for 
adolescents; (3) the proposal includes code language which 
could be interpreted as support for abortion rights; and (4) 
in the discussion of HIV/AIDS there is no recognition of the 
validity of an A-B-C approach. 
 
3.  (C)  USAID Director noted that since it appears that Luis 
Angel Hernandez of SECEP would attend the San Juan meeting, 
the USG wanted to ensure that Hernandez had instructions 
regarding Nicaragua\'s position as Minister Alvarado had 
promised the Ambassador. (Note: Hernandez attended the 
preparatory Santiago meeting in March where the objectionable 
proposed language for San Juan was drafted and, despite 
earlier stated Nicaraguan public positions opposing this 
language, Hernandez had not expressed this opposition in 
Santiago.  End Note.)  De Franco stated that he would ensure 
that Hernandez would have a copy of the draft declaration 
that the Ambassador provided the Minister of Health. He 
reaffirmed that the GON had no issue with the U.S. position 
and would instruct the Nicaraguan delegation accordingly.

c. 9:00 am        Depart via milair to San Jose. 
 
5.  U.S. citizens are not required to have a Nicaraguan visa 
to enter the country, however upon arrival holders of 
passports other than diplomatic are required to purchase a 
tourist card for $5.  Non-diplomatic passport holders are 
also charged a departure tax of $32. 
 
6.  Security assessment: While the Embassy has no 
information to indicate that official or private U.S. 
travelers to Nicaragua are specifically targeted for 
terrorist or criminal activity, there is a continuing risk. 
Violent crime in the capital is increasing and street 
crimes, including robbery and pickpocketing, are common. 
 
7.   Based on safety recommendations made by the police 
and published in various newspapers, the RSO recommends 
the following when considering utilizing taxi service: 
(1) Avoid taking taxis if possible, especially after 
7:00 p.m.  The majority of crimes have been reported at 
night. After 10:00 p.m., both taxi drivers and 
passengers automatically become potential victims of an 
assault, sexual assault, or even murder. (2) Before 
taking a taxicab, make sure that it has a red plate and 
that the number is legible.  Also, check that the taxi 
is properly labeled with the Cooperativa name and logo. 
Theses are the names of the most reliable taxi 
cooperatives: Cooperativa de Radio Taxis 25 de Febrero - 
Ph: 222-5218; Cooperativa de Radio Taxis El Gueguense - 
Ph: 249-7036 or call at Hotel Intercontinental 
Metrocentro at 278-4545 (Supervisor\'s name is Nelly 
Morales); Cooperativa de Radio Taxis 23 de Agosto at 
Hotel Princess - Ph: 270-5045; Cooperativa de Taxis 
Ruleteros Guardabarranco - Ph: 248-2026; Cooperativa de 
Taxi Urbano de Managua La Union - Ph: 249-8536. 
 
8.  Medical assessment: Malaria in Nicaragua is endemic - 
particularly in low-lying areas - especially Managua and the 
beaches. As in most of Central America, dengue is also a 
problem.  Personnel are urged to drink bottled water 
particularly in the chancery.  Visitors can check in with 
the medical unit for further information. 
 
9.  Access to certain sections of the chancery requires a 
security clearance.  Please advise Embassy of the travelers\' 
level of clearance prior to their arrival. 
 
10.  This is the rainy season in Managua with daytime highs 
in the 90\'s and evening temperatures falling to 80\'s.  Coat 
and tie business attire are required for calls on GON 
officials, but informal dress (open-collar shirts and slacks 
for men and summer dresses and skirts and blouses for women) 
is appropriate for other calls.
