1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT WAS DERIVED 
FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IN QATAR WHERE THE ISLAMIC DA\'AWA 
ORGANIZATION HAS A PRESENCE.  THE INFORMATION HAS NOT 
BEEN INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED AND IS PROVIDED SOLELY AS 
BACKGROUND FOR COMPARISON WITH INFORMATION SOURCES 
AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT, OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER 
POSTS CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT, STRUCTURE, AND 
OPERATIONS OF THE ISLAMIC DA\'AWA ORGANIZATION (IDO) 
HAVING ITS ROOTS IN THE SUDAN. 
 
-------------------- 
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
-------------------- 
 
3.  DA\'AWA MEANS \"CALL\" OR \"INVITATION\", REFERRING TO 
THE CALL OF NON-MUSLIMS TO CONVERT TO ISLAM.  VARIOUS 
ISLAMIC SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT VIEW SUCH A CALL AS 
\"SACRED.\"  THE QURAN STIPULATES THAT MUSLIMS SHOULD 
INVITE NON-MUSLIMS TO BE CONVERTED TO ISLAM AND STANDARD 
ISLAM-BASED LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE INDICATED THAT 
THERE ARE SEVERAL WAYS THROUGH WHICH MUSLIMS CAN HONOR 
SUCH A SACRED COMMANDMENT.  ONE WAY IS BY DONATING FUNDS 
TO SPECIALIST ISLAMIC AGENCIES ESTABLISHED FOR THIS 
PURPOSE. 
 
4.  THE DETERIORATING SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN THE 
CONTINENT OF AFRICA HAS PROVIDED FERTILE GROUND FOR 
MUSLIMS WORLDWIDE, RICH AND POOR, TO CARRY OUT THEIR 
SACRED DUTY.  THE FOUNDERS OF IDO ASCERTAINED THAT SOME 
MUSLIMS IN AFRICA WERE STARVING AND SUFFERING FROM THE 
ECONOMIC BURDENS BROUGHT ON BY ILLITERACY.  THEY ALSO 
BELIEVED THAT CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATIONS IN THE WEST HAD 
INVADED AFRICA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHRISTIANIZING MUSLIMS 
BY PROVIDING THEM WITH BASIC DAY TO DAY NEEDS.  IDO WAS 
ESTABLISHED TO COUNTER THE PROCESS OF \"CHRISTIANIZATION\" 
BY PROVIDING RELIEF AID, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL 
DEVELOPMENT, HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING FOR 
MUSLIMS. 
 
------------------------ 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 
------------------------ 
 
5.  THE IDO ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS BELIEVED TO 
CONSIST OF A BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THE TOP, AN ISLAMIC 
RELIEF AGENCY, AN AFRICAN ISLAMIC BENEVOLENT SOCIETY FOR 
MOTHER/CHILD CARE, AN AFRICAN COUNCIL FOR PRIVATE 
EDUCATION, AND THE DON FODUE (SIC) BENEVOLENT 
CORPORATION, AN ECONOMIC, COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND 
AGRICULTURAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION WHOSE SHARES AND 
PROFITS ARE ALLOCATED FOR IDO OPERATIONS.  THIS 
CORPORATION OPERATES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC BANKING 
RULES.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHERE THIS CORPORATION IS 
REGISTERED. 
 
6.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY SOURCES, BOARD MEMBERS CONSIST 
OF A PRESIDENT, SECRETARY-GENERAL, REPRESENTATIVES AND 
OBSERVERS.  GCC POSTS MAY WISH TO VERIFY NAMES INCLUDED 
IN THE LIST.  POST DOES NOT HAVE INFORMATION ON WHETHER 
THE LIST IS INCLUSIVE OR UP TO DATE: 
 
-  PRESIDENT -  ABDULRAHMAN SIWAR AL-DAHAB 
- 
-     AL-DAHAB IS A FORMER PRESIDENT OF SUDAN\'S 
GOVERNING COUNCIL.  HE WORKED FOR QATAR\'S MINISTRY OF 
INTERIOR IN THE EARLY 1970S AS AN ASSISTANT TO THE 
COMMANDANT-IN-CHIEF OF THE QATAR POLICE FORCE.  HE IS 
WELL-KNOWN TO QATARI OFFICIALS, INCLUDING SOME FROM 
RULING FAMILY CIRCLES.  HIS EMPLOYMENT IN QATAR WAS ON 
\"SECONDMENT\" FROM THE SUDAN POLICE FORCE.  IN THE 
MID-1970S AND UPON EXPIRY OF HIS CONTRACT IN QATAR, 
AL-DAHAB RETURNED TO THE SUDAN WHERE HE LATER LED A COUP 
AGAINST JAAFAR AL-NUMEIRI, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE SUDAN. 
 
-     AL-DAHAB IS BELIEVED TO BE WELL-RECEIVED AT 
OFFICIAL AND PRIVATE LEVELS IN OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES. 
POST UNDERSTANDS AL-DAHAB HAS THE SOLE HONOR OF HAVING 
LED A MILITARY REGIME IN THE SUDAN FOR ONLY A FEW YEARS 
THEN PASSING GOVERNMENT TO AN ELECTED REGIME.  THIS 
UNPRECEDENTED STEP IS VIEWED IN HIS FAVOR BECAUSE HE IS 
PERCEIVED AS THE ONLY ARAB MILITARY LEADER WHO HAS DONE 
SO FOLLOWING A STINT IN POWER.  OTHERS WHO LED COUPS 
AGAINST ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENTS DECLINED TO ABANDON 
THEIR POSITIONS VOLUNTARILY.  AL-DAHAB IS GIVEN CREDIT 
HERE FOR THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF IDO IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

Classified By: AMBASSADOR MAUREEN QUINN FOR REASONS 1.5 (b) AND (d) 
 
1. (S) SUMMARY. The organizations named in ref B, Qatar 
Charitable Society (QCS), Sheikh Eid bin Mohammed Charitable 
Society and the Qatari Joint Committee for Relief, are three 
of the four charitable entities in Qatar (the fourth is the 
Qatar Red Crescent Society). The GOQ is committed to 
combating terrorist financing and has demonstrated a strong 
willingness to cooperate with USG efforts. Absent concrete 
information specifically linking these organizations to 
terrorist activity, post has not engaged the GOQ regarding 
them. To designate these organizations now, individually or 
as a group, without apparent cause or justification, would 
send a strong negative signal to the GOQ and the Qatari 
public about the bilateral relationship. END SUMMARY. 
 
QATAR CHARITABLE SOCIETY 
 
2. (S) The \"United Way\" of Qatar, Qatar Charitable Society is 
the largest charitable organization in Qatar and conducts the 
majority of charitable activities and fundraising in the 
country. QCS took decisive measures in late 2002 to prevent 
misuse of funds or other resources for illegal purposes 
(detailed ref D).  These steps included a new focus on 
domestic charitable activities and reorganization of 
management. The GOQ has tightened every aspect of charitable 
oversight without USG prodding. Designating QCS at this time 
would suggest that these efforts were not sufficient or 
effective. Qatar Charitable Society has kept an office open 
in the Palestinian territories given the plight of the 
Palestinian people. This office might have some contacts with 
Hamas. If Washington agencies have specific information in 
that regard, we would want to share it with the GOQ for 
investigations and any appropriate action. 
 
3. (S) Additionally, in late 2002 a new QCS Chairman, Sheikh 
Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman al Thani, was named. In addition to 
his position with QCS, Sheikh Abdulaziz also serves as the 
Chairperson of the Royal Family Council, which has the 
constitutional mandate of investing the nation\'s ruler. 
Designating QCS could be interpreted as a slur against Sheikh 
Abdulaziz and the ruling al Thani family as a whole. Sheikh 
Abdulaziz works closely with the Organization of Islamic 
Conference Fund for Afghanistan, established in Doha in 2001. 
He is also involved with Microsoft and supported their 
opening an office in the Qatar Science and Technology Park 
this spring. 
 
QATARI JOINT COMMITTEE FOR RELIEF 
 
4. (S) Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman also serves as the 
Chairperson of this committee. To the best of post\'s 
knowledge, this is not an operating charitable organization 
as much as a relief entity that targets specific needs. 
Usually the organization is addressed as the Qatari Joint 
Relief Committee for Afghanistan, Qatari Joint Relief 
Committee for Iraq, etc. GOQ officials have previously 
reported that the Joint Committee is a quasi-government 
entity and donations may be both public and private. 
 
5. (S) In the past two years, the Joint Committee has been 
very active in Afghanistan and has recently focused on Iraq. 
The Joint Committee for both was announced publicly along 
with information on how Qatari citizens and others could make 
donations for the specific needs in these countries. 
Fundraising telethons are generally used to solicit initial 
donations. Ref A outlines Sheikh Abdulaziz\'s recent visit to 
Afghanistan to discuss application of Qatari Joint Relief 
Committee for Afghanistan projects, as well as private and 
GOQ donations, with the Afghan and U.S. officials. 
 
SHEIKH EID BIN MOHAMMAD CHARITABLE SOCIETY 
 
6. (S) This, the smallest charity in Qatar, is not well known 
to the Embassy due to its small size. GOQ officials have 
previously reported that the organization does little 
international charitable work. Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad al 
Thani is a royal family member. If Washington agencies have 
significant concerns about this group, post would like to 
have the opportunity to engage key GOQ decision-makers on the 
organization\'s activities in order to gather more useful 
details. The organization has at least two offices in Doha. 
One office is about a half mile from the Embassy and the 
second is around the corner from the Ambassador\'s residence. 
Post has not visited either facility to date. Post might also 
be able to develop more information by pursuing some contacts 
with this group. 
 
7. (S) COMMENT. Qatar remains a committed and active partner 
in the international war on terrorism and efforts to combat 
terrorist financing. As reported previously, the GOQ has 
repeatedly taken independent steps to control local 
charitable organizations and strengthen oversight over 
foreign donations. These steps have shown tangible and 
immediate results. Post strongly argues against designating 
these three organizations. They are either doing the right 
thing or we have not shared information beforehand with the 
GOQ that allows it to take pre-emptive action. Post believes 
engaging the GOQ directly and privately regarding our 
concerns for these three organizations\' connections to Hamas 
is the best way to achieve desired results.

SUBJECT: 2005 INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT: QATAR 
 
1. This report serves as the 2005 Investment Climate 
Statement for Qatar.  It will be provided to assist U.S. 
investors wishing to do business in Qatar. 
 
2. A.1  Openness to Foreign Investment: 
 
3. The Government of Qatar, under the leadership of His 
Highness the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, 
strongly encourages international investment in Qatar. 
Qatar has attracted more foreign investment during the 
last decade than it did throughout the first two decades 
following independence from Britain in 1971.  The main 
economic stimulus in Qatar is the development of its huge 
natural gas reserves in the North Field, the largest non- 
associated natural gas reservoir in the world.  Qatar\'s 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry has attracted 
foreign investment worth nearly USD 70 billion.  The oil 
and gas industry will continue to be the most attractive 
sector for foreign investors, as Qatar Petroleum expects 
investments in upcoming projects will exceed USD 50 
billion by 2010. 
 
4. Law No. 13/2000 allows for 100 percent ownership by 
foreign investors in certain sectors, including services, 
agriculture, industry, health, education and tourism, and 
projects involving the development and exploitation of 
natural resources, pending approval by decree from the 
government.  In 2004, Qatar enacted Law No. 31/2004 which 
allows foreign investment in the banking and insurance 
sectors pending approval by decree from the Cabinet of 
Ministers.  When approving majority foreign ownership in 
a project, Law No. 13/2000 states that the project should 
fit into the country\'s development plans.  Law No. 13 
adds that preference should be given to projects that use 
raw materials available in the local market, manufacture 
products for export, produce a new product or use of 
advanced technology, facilitate the transfer of 
technology and know-how in Qatar, and promote the 
development of national human resources. 
 
5. In 2004, Qatar passed Law 17 which allows foreigners 
to own residential property in select projects of the 
Pearl of the Gulf Real Estate Development Project. 
International firms interested in obtaining commercial 
registration under the provisions of laws No. 13/2000 and 
17/2004 should make an application to the Department of 
Commercial Affairs at the Ministry of Economy and 
Commerce.  U.S. firms have received commercial 
registration allowing 100 percent foreign ownership in 
recent years. 
 
6. In general, foreign investment is limited at 49 
percent, with the Qatari partner(s) holding at least 51 
percent. It should be noted that foreign firms continue 
to be required to use a local agent for the purposes of 
immigration (sponsorship and residence of employees). 
 
7. The Government of Qatar has embarked on a 
privatization program designed to encourage and 
strengthen the Qatari private sector.  To date, this 
effort has focused on the privatization of state-owned 
industries and corporations.  For example, in early 2003, 
15 percent of the Government\'s shares in Qatar 
Petrochemical Company, Qatar Fertilizer Company, Qatar 
Fuel Additives Company and Qatar Steel Company were made 
available to Qatari investors through an initial public 
offering.  There are no fully privatized companies in 
Qatar, but the Government does allow non-Qataris to own 
shares in selected semi-privatized companies. 
 
8. Judicial decisions in commercial disputes are 
primarily based on contractual agreements, provided these 
agreements are not in conflict with applicable Qatari 
laws.  U.S. firms are strongly encouraged to consult a 
local attorney before concluding any commercial agreement 
with a local entity. 
 
 
9. A2.  Conversion and transfer policies: 
 
10. Qatar\'s official currency, the Qatari riyal (QR), is 
a floating currency.  Due to little demand for the riyal 
outside Qatar and national economy\'s dependence on oil 
and gas revenues, the Government has pegged its exchange 
rate to the U.S. dollar.  The official rate is QR 1.00 
for USD 0.27 or USD 1.00 for QR 3.64, as set by the 
Government in June 1980.  This was reaffirmed by an Amiri 
decree issued July 9, 2001, as a step towards 
establishing a common currency for the Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) countries, a decision agreed upon at a GCC 
Summit held in Bahrain in December 2000 and expected to 
take effect in 2010.  The Government maintains a floating 
rate against all other currencies, with the exception of 
four GCC countries - Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab 
Emirates and Bahrain - whose currencies are similarly 
pegged to the dollar. 
 
11. Qatar does not delay remittance of foreign investment 
returns nor does it restrict transfer of funds associated 
with an investment such as return on dividends, return of 
capital, interest and principal payments on private 
foreign debt, lease payments, royalties and management 
fees.  Similarly, there are no limitations on the inflow 
or outflow of funds for remittances of profits, debt 
services, capital, capital gains and other returns. 
However, local as well as foreign contractors may 
confront a delay of over three months in receiving their 
amount due without interest.  Normally, such a delay is 
attributed to bureaucratic red tape. Foreign exchange is 
available at all times through banks and branches and 
exchange companies. 
 
12. In accordance with government regulations to combat 
money laundering and terrorist financing, all financial 
transactions in excess of QR 100,000 (USD 27,472) must be 
reported to Qatar Central Bank.  Any repeated cash 
transactions of QR 30,000 (approximately $10,000) or 
higher made by an individual or entity must be reported. 
Any transfer of funds into Qatar in excess of QR 100,000 
must have valid documentation regarding the use of these 
funds. 
 
13. A3.  Expropriation and compensation: 
 
14. There have been no cases of expropriation or 
sequestration of foreign investment in Qatar since the 
nationalization in the mid-1970s of Shell and Dukhan 
Services (the latter was a combination of six 
international oil companies handling Qatar\'s onshore 
operations on the country\'s West Coast.) The foreign 
interests were compensated promptly and fairly, in an act 
the Government refers to as \"negotiation,\" not 
\"nationalization\" or \"sequestration\". 
 
15. A4.  Dispute settlement: 
 
16. Qatar is not a member of the International Center for 
the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).  In March 
2003 Qatar became a signatory to the New York Convention 
of 1958.  If and when investment disputes do occur, Qatar 
accepts binding international arbitration between the 
Government and foreign investors.  However, Qatari courts 
do not enforce judgments of other courts in disputes 
emanating from investment agreements made under the 
jurisdiction of other nations. 
 
17. U.S. firms are advised to consult with a Qatari or 
foreign-based law firm when executing contracts with 
local parties, in order to protect their own interests. 
Contracts between local and foreign parties serve as the 
basis for resolving any future commercial disputes.  The 
process of resolving disputes in the Qatari legal system 
can be time-consuming. 
 
 
18. A5.  Performance requirements/incentives: 
 
19. Performance requirements for foreign investment in 
Qatar, including a counter-trade offset program, do not 
exist.  While screening investment proposals, the 
Government may indicate preferences for locating 
facilities, capital investments and other matters. 
Disclosure of financial and employment data is required 
but proprietary information is not. 
 
20. The Government offers a variety of incentives to 
foreign investors, which may include tax exemptions, 
property grants, energy subsidies, and low-cost 
financing.  The following is a list of possible 
incentives offered to foreign investors: 
 
--Natural gas priced at USD 60-75 cents per mbtu; 
--Electricity offered at less than USD two cents per kWh; 
--Industrial land offered at USD 27 cents per square 
meter per year for a period of 50 
   years including options for renewing the lease; 
--Exemption from customs duties on imports of machinery, 
equipment and spare 
   parts; 
--Exemption on export duties; 
--Exemption from corporate earnings taxes for five years 
extendable to ten years; 
--Exemption from income taxes; 
--Absence of quotas on imports; 
--Low cost financing through Qatar Industrial Development 
Bank; and, 
--Flexible immigration and employment rules to enable 
import of foreign labor. 
 
 
21. A6.  Right to private ownership and establishment 
 
22. The Commercial Companies Law, Law No. 5/2002 
(replacing Law No. 11/1981) controls the establishment of 
all private business concerns in Qatar.  The updated law 
provides for corporate mergers, corporate bonds, and the 
conversion of corporate partnerships into joint stock 
companies. 
 
23. Joint ventures involving foreign partners almost 
always take the form of limited liability partnerships. 
Law No. 15/1990, which controls foreign investment in 
commercial companies, does not allow foreign investors to 
enter into a joint stock company with Qatari partners. 
Foreign investors may own up to 49 percent, and the 
Qatari partners no less than 51 percent, of a limited 
liability concern.  Foreign partners in ventures 
organized as limited liability partnerships must pay the 
full amount of their contribution to authorized capital 
in cash or in kind, prior to the start of operations. 
Usually, such firms are required to set aside 10 percent 
of profits each year in a statutory reserve, until it 
equals 50 percent of the venture\'s authorized capital. 
 
24. Foreigners are generally not allowed to own property 
or invest in privatized public services.   However, some 
residential and commercial areas of Doha and corporate 
stocks have been made available to foreign investors.  On 
July 4, 2004, the Emir ratified Law No. 17/2004, allowing 
foreigners to own some residential property in select 
projects of the Pearl of the Gulf Real Estate Development 
Project.  Foreigners may also own land in select real 
estate development projects in the West Bay Lagoon and Al- 
Khor areas. 
 
25. A7.  Protection of property rights: 
 
26. Within Qatar, owners of trademarks and copyrights and 
holders of patents depend on Qatari laws and regulations 
for protection.  Intellectual property rights in Qatar 
are protected by Law No. 7/2002 (Copyright and 
Neighboring Rights Law) and Law No. 9/2002 (Trademarks 
and Geographical Indicators Law).  Qatar has adopted the 
GCC Patent Law and created a GCC Patent Office.  The 
Ministry of Economy and Commerce is responsible for 
enforcing these laws and other intellectual property 
rights matters. 
 
27. The Ministry of Public Health requires registration 
of all pharmaceutical products imported into the country 
and will not register unauthorized copies of products 
patented in other countries. 
 
28. A8.  Transparency of the regulatory system: 
 
29. In Qatar, the Government is the major buyer and end- 
user of a wide range of products and services. 
Government procurement regulations provide a ten percent 
preference for Qatari bidders and five percent for GCC 
bidders. 
 
30. The Central Tenders Committee (CTC) of the Ministry 
of Finance is responsible for processing the majority of 
public sector tenders.  The CTC applies standard 
tendering procedures and adheres to established 
performance norms. It also sets the standards for rules 
and regulations for bidding procedures. 
 
31. Information on CTC tenders may be obtained from the 
CTC office in Doha or on the Internet at 
http://www.ctc.gov.qa.  In tenders valued in excess of QR 
100 million (USD 27 million), the CTC may invite and pre- 
qualify international firms to bid for a specific product 
or service.  Technical bids submitted to the CTC are 
referred to the appropriate government end-user for short- 
listing.  The CTC then opens the commercial bids and 
recommends the lowest priced, technically qualified 
bidder to the entity concerned, which will make the final 
award decision.  Inquiries about specific award decisions 
should be directed to the CTC. 
 
32. Some governmental entities have internal tender 
committees.  The Ministry of Energy and Industry and 
Qatar Petroleum process all tenders independently.  Qatar 
Armed Forces and the Ministry of Interior are responsible 
for issuing tenders for classified materials and 
services.  The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and 
Agriculture may tender consultant contracts valued at 
less than QR three million (USD 822,000) and works 
contracts valued at less than QR 1 million (USD 274,000). 
 
33. Foreign firms wishing to participate in government 
procurement programs may be required to have a local 
agent and provide bid and performance bonds. 
International bidders should contact end-users directly 
for information on local agent requirements. 
 
34. Other regulatory policies do not significantly affect 
foreign investment decisions.  The Government continues 
to strive to facilitate private investment (foreign and 
national) in the Qatari economy. 
 
35. The lack of transparency in Qatari Government 
procurement has become a growing issue.  Some U.S. 
companies have expressed concerns about the lack of 
transparency in government procurement.  The Government 
of Qatar is aware of these concerns and the United States 
will continue to engage Qatar on this issue. 
 
36. A9.  Efficient capital markets and portfolio 
investment 
 
37. In Qatar, there are no restrictions on the free flow 
of capital. 
 
38. Qatar Central Bank (QCB) adheres to conservative 
policies aimed at maintaining steady economic growth and 
prudent and responsible banking sector. 
 
39. Qatar\'s banking sector assets at the end of September 
2004 was estimated at QR 82 billion (USD 22.5 billion), 
15.25 percent over the previous year\'s corresponding 
figure.  Qatar National Bank (50 percent state-owned) is 
the largest bank in the country. Its total assets at the 
end of 2003 was QR 34.8 billion (USD 5.5 billion), 12 
percent over the previous year\'s total.  As in previous 
years, this represented over 50 percent of the total 
assets of all commercial banks in Qatar. 
 
40. Almost all import transactions are controlled by 
standard letters of credit (L/Cs) processed by local 
banks and their correspondent banks in the exporting 
countries.  Credit facilities are provided to local and 
foreign investors within the framework of standard 
international banking practices.  Foreign investors are 
usually required to have a guarantee from their local 
sponsor/local equity partner.  However, in accordance 
with QCB guidelines, banks operating in Qatar give 
priority to Qataris and to public development projects in 
their financing operations.  Moreover, QCB prohibits 
banks from lending an amount greater than seven percent 
of a bank\'s capital base to any single customer. 
 
41. In addition, the Qatar Central Bank does not allow 
\"cross-sharing\" and \"stable shareholder\" arrangements 
among banks and other business concerns that result in 
fewer shares of some corporations actually trading freely 
in the market. 
 
42. The Doha Securities Market (DSM) is considered the 
second most active stock market in the Middle East and 
North Africa.  DSM has grown from 2, 323.84 points in 
2002 to 3, 946.70 at the end of 2003, an increase of 
approximately 70 percent.  In 2003, DSM has attracted 
approximately USD 26.7 billion in investment.  DSM has 
benefited from Qatar\'s current economic boom, low 
remuneration of bank deposits, an excess of liquidity in 
the economy and policies that foster an open economy 
attractive to the private sector and foreign investment. 
 
43. Qatar\'s current regulations allow foreigners to 
invest in two stock options, Qatar Telecom (Q-Tel) and 
Salam International Investment.  Gulf Cooperation Council 
(GCC) nationals are allowed to invest in up to eight 
stocks.  In December 2003, the Cabinet of Ministers 
approved a law allowing foreigners to own up to 25 
percent of a company listed in the DSM.  The implementing 
regulations for this law are expected in 2005.  In May 
2004, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce issued the 
implementing regulations for the Mutual Fund Law (Law. No 
25/2002), which allows expatriates to invest indirectly 
the stock market. No bond loans have been traded on the 
DSM. 
 
44. International Credit Ratings companies have 
recognized Qatar\'s management of the economy, banking and 
finance sectors.  According to 2004 Qatari Government 
statistics, Standard and Poor\'s rated Qatar with a long 
term foreign currency rating of A+ (positive) and a long 
term local currency rating of A+ (positive).  Standard 
and Poor\'s also rated Qatar with an A-1 (positive) for 
short-term foreign and local currency.  Moody\'s rated 
Qatar A3 for long-term stability in the bond market and 
deposits and Prime-2 (stable) for short-term stability. 
Capital Intelligence rated Qatar as A- for its sovereign, 
long-term rating and A2 for its sovereign, short-term 
rating. 
 
 
45. A10.  Political violence: 
 
46. Qatar is politically stable.  The crime rate is low. 
There are no political parties, labor unions or trade 
associations.  There is no known organized domestic 
political opposition.  These facts combine to minimize 
dissent. 
 
47. With regard to possible terrorist attacks, the U.S. 
Government considers the potential for acts of 
transnational terrorism to occur in Qatar as high. 
Potential investors and U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
stay in close contact with the Embassy for up-to-date 
threat information. 
 
48. A11.  A. Corruption: 
 
49. A bribe to an official or a foreign official in Qatar 
is viewed as a crime.  Law No. 14/1971 stipulates that a 
government official who is convicted of corruption may 
receive up to seven years\' imprisonment.   According to 
Law No. 14, corruption should be investigated by the 
Ministry of Interior\'s Office of the Attorney General and 
Criminal Investigation Department.  Final judgments are 
made by the criminal court, which falls under the 
Ministry of Justice. While normal punishment for 
giving/taking a bribe is imprisonment of up to seven 
years, the minimum is one year\'s imprisonment and/or a 
fine worth QR 1,000 (USD 275). 
 
50. The Government of Qatar has begun a major initiative 
to combat corruption in government procurement.  Several 
cases of alleged corruption at a variety of government 
entities are currently under investigation or 
adjudication.  State-owned entities are increasingly 
sensitive to appearances of corruption and are working to 
establish more open and transparent processes. 
 
51. Qatar is not a participant in regional anti- 
corruption initiatives.  No regional or local watchdog 
organization operates in this country. 
52. U.S. investors are subject to the provisions of the 
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
 
53. B.  Bilateral Investment Agreements: 
 
54. Over the past ten years, Qatar has signed protocol 
investment promotion agreements with several countries, 
including Armenia, Bangladesh, Bosnia, China, Eritrea, 
France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Romania, 
Senegal, South Korea, Thailand and most Arab countries. 
 
55. Qatar has not entered into a bilateral investment, 
trade or taxation treaty with the United States. 
 
 
56. C.  OPIC and other investment insurance programs: 
 
57. Due to concerns about labor practices in Qatar, OPIC 
suspended its operations in Qatar in 1995.  However, 
Qatar is working diligently to improve its labor 
standards in order to reinstate OPIC coverage.  In May 
2004, Qatar passed a new labor law which provides more 
rights and protections for Qataris and non-Qataris. 
 
58. Qatar has no plans to become a member of the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). 
 
59. D.  Labor: 
 
60. Qatar\'s labor force consists primarily of expatriate 
workers.  With a total estimated population of 744,000 
and Qataris constituting no more than one fourth of this 
number, the role of expatriates in the economy is very 
important.  The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of 
Civil Service and Housing Affairs\' Department of Labor 
regulate recruitment of expatriate labor. 
 
61. The largest group of foreign workers come from South 
Asia.  Recently, the Government has begun to diversify 
the sources of expatriate labor, increasing the 
percentage of workers from outside this region.  Qatar\'s 
plan to develop its own manpower resources continues to 
receive attention at all government levels. 
 
62. In May 2004, Qatari passed a new labor law which 
allows Qatari workers to right to strike, to form 
worker\'s committees and to join international labor 
organizations with ministerial approval.  Strikes are 
forbidden in vital industries including oil and gas, 
water and power, transport, communications and hospitals. 
Under the new law, all workers have the right to conduct 
collective negotiations over all work-related issues 
through the formation of joint committees with employers. 
Where workers\' committees exist, they will represent the 
interest of all employees; in other cases, provided there 
are 30 or more employees, they may directly elect 
representatives. 
 
63. Where joint committees cannot resolve disputes, they 
must be submitted to the Labor Department in the Ministry 
of Civil Service Affairs and Housing for mediation.  If 
still unresolved, they go to a \"Committee of Settlement\" 
composed of representatives of the Ministry, employer and 
employees.  If still unresolved, disputes will then be 
brought before an Arbitration Committee headed by a 
judge, and composed of representatives of the Minister, 
the Qatar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Qatar 
General Union of Workers. 
 
64. All expatriate labor must have a Qatari sponsor. 
Therefore, foreign investors are urged to negotiate labor 
visa issues with their sponsors/local agents/partners in 
the early stages of contract negotiation.  The Ministry 
of Interior and the current sponsor must approve all 
transfers of sponsorship of an expatriate from one Qatari 
national or firm to another.  With the approval of the 
Ministry of Interior, sponsorship of employees who filed 
valid complaints of abuse by employers can be transferred 
without the current employer\'s agreement. By law, an 
expatriate hired locally is only entitled to two 
sponsorship transfers during his/her residence in Qatar, 
provided he/she is below 60 years of age.  Expatriates 
hired abroad are not allowed to change sponsorship.  If 
for any reason a residence permit is canceled, the 
expatriate is not allowed to return to Qatar on a work 
visa for a period of two years. 
 
65. It is common practice in Qatar for expatriate workers 
to be provided accommodation, end of service benefits and 
homeward passage allowance, in addition to salaries. 
There is no minimum wage regulation.  While salaries and 
wages are negotiable, end of service benefits are subject 
to three different laws. 
 
66. Qatar has become increasingly active in the 
International Labor Organization and is currently 
drafting a new labor law. 
 
67. E.  Foreign trade zones/Free ports: 
 
68. There are currently no foreign trade zones or free 
ports in Qatar.  However, there are plans to develop a 
free trade zone in Qatar at the site of the new Doha 
International Airport, which will be operational by 2008- 
09. 
 
69. F.  Foreign direct investments statistics: 
 
70. The Government of Qatar does not publish detailed 
statistics for foreign direct investment in Qatar or the 
Government\'s direct investments overseas. 
 
71. In recent years, Qatar has attracted sizeable 
investments in the areas of enhanced oil recovery and 
production, as well as the development of Qatar\'s gas 
industry.  During the past ten years, QP and its partners 
have invested an estimated USD 100 billion in upstream 
and downstream operations.  The development of Qatar\'s 
offshore natural gas reserves in the North Field will 
continue to dominate all other sectors in attracting 
foreign investors.  Qatar\'s gas industry has attracted 
investors/creditors from the around the world.  The U.S. 
firm ExxonMobil alone has invested approximately USD 40 
billion, in part as equity shareholder in Qatar Liquefied 
Natural Gas Company (Qatargas) (10 percent) and Ras 
Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co. (RasGas) (26.5 percent). 
 
72. Leading U.S. oil companies such as Occidental and 
Anadarko are currently operating under production sharing 
agreements for enhanced oil recovery/production.  U.S. 
investment in Qatar (mainly in the oil and gas sector) is 
estimated to be USD 60-70 billion.  Government officials 
expect an additional approximately USD 70 billion will be 
invested in Qatar\'s energy sector by 2010. 
 
73. The following is a list of foreign equity 
participation investors, U.S. firms included, in some 
major state-owned industrial/petroleum related
