SUBJECT:  CHRISTIAN CHURCHES BOMBED IN TRIPOLI 
 
1.  (U)  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS AGAINST 
CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS IN TRIPOLI DURING THE 
PERIOD JANUARY 8-9.  TWO CHURCHES, MARONITE AND 
GREEK ORTHODOX, WERE BOMBED ON TUESDAY, CAUSING 
SERIOUS DAMAGE, WHILE ANOTHER GREEK ORTHODOX 
CHURCH AND AN EVANGELICAL INSTITUTION WERE DAMAGED 
IN ATTACKS WEDNESDAY.  A CHRISTIAN CEMETARY WAS 
ALSO BOMBED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
 
2.  (U)  ISLAMIC UNIFICATION MOVEMENT (TAWHIID) 
HAS ISSUED TWO CONSECUTIVE CONDEMNATIONS OF THE 
ATTACKS, NOTING THAT TRIPOLI HAS TRADITIONALLY 
BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF RELIGIOUS UNITY, AND DEPLORING 
EFFORTS \"TO FRIGHTEN THE CHRISTIANS OUT OF THE 
CITY.\"  WEEKLY MEETING OF ISLAMIC DAR AL-FATWA 
WEDNESDAY ALSO CONDEMNED THE BOMBINGS, AS DID 
BRIG. OTHMAN OTHMAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF 
INTERNAL SECURITY FORCES DURING A VISIT TO 
TRIPOLI WEDNESDAY. 
 
3.  (C)  CHRISTIAN NOTABLE AND LEBANESE FORCES 
CHARTER MEMBER, CHARLES MALIK, TOLD POLOFF THAT 
FOUR CHRISTIANS HAVE, AS WELL, BEEN MURDERED ON 
ROADS NEAR TRIPOLI, AND THAT CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS 
OF AREA FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES.  HE SAID THAT 
\"LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY\" IS THINKING OF 
PREPARING A DEMARCHE TO STATE DEPARTMENT ON 
TRIPOLI VIOLENCE. 
 
4.  COMMENT (C):  AS ALWAYS IN BEIRUT, LIST OF 
POSSIBLE PERPETRATORS OF THESE ATTACKS IS A LONG 
ONE, BEGINNING WITH TAWHIID ITSELF.  MANY 
OBSERVERS ATTRIBUTE BOMBINGS, WHICH COME SOON 
AFTER RECENT DEPLOYMENT OF LAF INTO TRIPOLI 
AS PART OF NORTHERN SECURITY PLAN, AS EFFORT 
TO EMBARASS GOL (WHILE AT SAME TIME INTIMIDATING 
CHRISTIANS).  ELABORATING ON THIS HYPOTHESIS, 
CHRISTIAN LEBANESE EMBASSY EMPLOYEE FROM KOURA 
REGION HAS TOLD US THAT MUCH BLAME IS BEING LAID 
AT FEET OF STILL-ACTIVE COMMUNISTS IN TRIPOLI, 
WITH RATIONALE BEING THAT LATTER ARE TRYING TO 
DISRUPT SECURITY PLAN THERE AND PLACE THE BLAME 
ON TAWHIID \"PRINCE\" SHA\'BAN, WHO RECENTLY 
BOASTED IN A PUBLIC SPEECH THAT THE COMMUNISTS 
HAD BEEN CRUSHED IN TRIPOLI.  A SIMILAR ARGUMENT, 
HOWEVER, COULD BE MADE THAT TAWIID\'S MAIN RIVAL 
IN TRIPOLI, THE ARAB DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IS 
BEHIND BOMBINGS.

SUBJECT:  BOMBS IN WEST BEIRUT 
 
1.  (C)  SINCE THE SMUGGLER\'S INN BLAST OF JANUARY 
9, THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR MORE BOMBINGS IN WEST 
BEIRUT, KILLING SEVEN MORE PEOPLE AND INJURING 
AS MANY AS 80 MORE.  IN ADDITION, A LARGE EXPLOSIVE 
CHARGE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING HOUSING THE 
EMBASSY\'S CHIEF POLITICAL SECTION LOCAL EMPLOYEE 
FAILED TO DETONATE WHEN ITS FUSE EXPLODED SUNDAY NIGHT. 
DETAILS FOLLOW. 
 
2.  (U)  THREE PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 27 INJURED 
FRIDAY WHEN A BOMB EXPLODED OUTSIDE THE BANK OF 
BEIRUT AND ARAB COUNTRIES ON CORNICHE MAZRA\' IN WEST 
BEIRUT.  EXPLOSION DEVASTATED THE INSIDE OF BANK, 
DUG A LARGE CRATER IN SIDEWALK, AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE 
DAMAGE TO VEHICLES AND OTHER BUILDINGS. 
 
3.  (U)  THREE BOMBS EXPLODED SATURDAY, KILLING 
THREE PEOPLE AND INJURING AS MANY AS 60.  TWO OF 
THE BOMBS, BOTH PACKED WITH NAILS, WENT OFF WITHIN 
FIVE MINUTES OF EACH OTHER IN THE PSP-CONTROLLED 
MUSSEITBEH AREA WHILE THE THIRD INJURED SIX PERSONS 
AND DAMAGED PROPERTY ON HAMRA STREET NEAR A PSP 
CHECKPOINT. 
 
4.  (C)  EMBASSY POLITICAL SECTION EMPLOYEE GABY 
AKKAR, A CHRISTIAN, SAID THAT UNLIKE BOMB WHICH 
DESTROYED HIS CAR LAST MONTH, HE IS CERTAIN THAT 
LAST NIGHTS ABORTED EXPLOSION WAS IMED AT HIM. 
HE SAID THAT CHARGE WAS PLACED DIRECTLY UNDER THE 
BALCONY OF HIS APARTMENT.  AKKAR SAID THAT HE IS 
NOW MAKING PLANS TO MOVE HIS FAMILY INTO THE EAST 
WHERE IT IS SAFE. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  LEBANESE PUBLIC FIGURES HAVE 
INEVITABLY ACCUSED ISRAEL OF BEING BEHIND BLASTS, 
WHILE THE SYRIAN BA\'ATH PARTY HAS SINGLED OUT 
PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS.  JOURNALISTS RESIDENT IN 
THE WEST VARIOUSLY ATTRIBUTE THE BLASTS TO THE MUR- 
ABITUN, WHICH THEY SAY IS RETURNING TO THE AREA IN 
FORCE AND REINVIGORATING THE OLD MURABITUN-PSP FEUD, 
OR HIZBALLAH,SIGNS OF WHOSE PRESENCE THEY SAY ARE 
INCREASINGLY DAILY.  IN THIS REGARD, U.S. JOURNALISTS 
DESCRIBED THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN WEST BEIRUT AS 
HAVING SUNK TO TRULY HOBBESIAN LEVELS OF NASTINESS 
IN LAST MONTH, WITH THE COMBINATION OF CAR BOMBS 
AND ARMED ROBBERIES KEEPING MQST PEOPLE LOCKED 
INDOORS AT NIGHT.  THERE ARE PRESENTLY REPRESENTA- 
TIVES OF ONLY THREE AMERICAN NEWS MEDIA RESIDENT 
IN BEIRUT (ASSOCIATED PRESS, LOS ANGELES TIMES, 
AND NEW YORK TIMES); SOME OF THESE ARE THINKING ABOUT 
LEAVING.

REF:  BEIRUT 992 
 
1.  AS REPORTED REFTEL, HIZBALLAH PUBLISHED ON FEBRUARY 16 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN LEBANON A POLITICAL \"MANIFESTO.\" 
HIZBALLAH\'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES, AS CITED FROM THE 
MANIFESTO BY THE LOCAL FRENCH-LANGUAGE PRESS, FOLLOW. 
 
BEGIN TEXT. 
 
--  THE DEPARTURE OF THE ISRAELIS, PRELUDE TO THE 
ANNIHILATION OF ISRAEL AND THE LIBERATION OF THE HOLY CITY 
OF JERUSALEM. 
 
--  THE DEFINITIVE DEPARTURE FROM LEBANON OF THE UNITED 
STATES, FRANCE, AND THEIR ALLIES AND THE END OF THE 
INFLUENCE OF ANY COLONIALIST STATE OVER THE COUNTRY. 
 
--  THE JUDGMENT OF PHALANGE PARTY MEMBERS FOR ALL THE 
CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED AGAINST MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS, 
WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. 
 
--  THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION FOR ALL THE SONS OF OU 
PEOPLE, AND FREEDOM OF CHOICE OF THE POLITICAL REGIME 
WHICH THEY DESIRE. 
 
WE DO NOT HIDE, HOWEVER, OUR PREFERENCE FOR AN ISLAMIC 
REGIME AND CALL ON EVERYONE TO CHOOSE IT, BECAUSE IT ALONE 
GUARANTEES JUSTICE AND DIGNITY FOR ALL AND PREVENTS ANY 
ATTEMPTS AT NEOCOLONIALIST INFILTRATION INTO OUR COUNTRIES 
 
END TEXT. 
 
2.  ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL PRESS, THE ABOVE OBJECTIVES 
WERE CONTAINED IN A FIFTY-PAGE MANIFESTO ENTITLED \"OPEN 
LETTER TO THE OPPRESSED OF LEBANON AND THE WORLD.\"  THE 
MANIFESTO WAS PRESENTED BY SHEIKH HASSAN GHIBRISS, 
SPOKESMAN OF THE \"HIZBALLAH NATION,\" TO A GATHERING OF 
ABOUT 1000 SUPPORTERS ON FEBRUARY 16 IN THE SOUTHERN 
BEIRUT SUBURB OF SHIYAH. 
 
3.  SEVERAL SHIITE AND SUNNI RELIGIOUS LEADERS REPORTEDLY 
ATTENDED THE GATHERING, MOST NOTABLY SHEIKHS SOBHI TUFAYLI 
HASSAN NASRALLAH, AND JALAL EDDIN ARKANDAN.  HOWEVER, BOTH 
HIZBALLAH \"SPIRITUAL GUIDE\" SHEIKH FADLALLAH AND TAWHIID 
MOVEMENT LEADER SHEIKH SHA\'BAN WERE ABSENT DUE TO THEIR 
CURRENT VISIT TO IRAN WHERE, ACCORDING TO LEBANESE 
TELEVISION, THEY WERE RECEIVED BY AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI ON 
FEBRUARY 15. 
 
4.  WE WOULD ALSO DRAW ADDRESSEES\' ATTENTION TO FBIS 
GF190720 AND GF190722 IN WHICH TEHRAN RADIO REPORTS 
A MEETING ON FEBRUARY 16 BETWEEN SHEIKH FADLALLAH AND 
GRAND AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI FOLLOWING WHICH THE TWO 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS CALLED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN 
ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT IN LEBANON.

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: PINT, LE 
SUBJECT: HIZBALLAH ON THE MOVE 
 
1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  SOME WEEKS AGO, IN A MESSAGE ON 
POTENTIAL NEW HIZBALLAH TACTICS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
JENCO KIDNAPPING AND THE MURDER OF TWO FRENCH MILITARY 
OBSERVERS, EMBASSY BEIRUT SPECULATED THAT HIZBALLAH IS 
BEGINNING TO SHIFT TOWARD A MORE PUBLIC, VISIBLE STANCE, 
PARTLY BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THEY FELT STRONG ENOUGH.  WE 
NOW HAVE MORE EVIDENCE OF THIS.  FIRST, ON FEBRUARY 16 
HIZBALLAH ISSUED ITS FIRST PUBLIC PROGRAMMATIC MANIFESTO 
(BEIRUT 1013), INTER ALIA, CALLING FOR THE DEPARTURE OF 
THE US, FRANCE AND THEIR ALLIES FROM LEBANON AND THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC REGIME.  SECOND, ON 
FEBRUARY 18, ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, VARIOUSLY 
NUMBERED AT 1500-12,000, WERE BUSSED TO SIDON FROM BEIRUT 
AND CONTROLLED THE CITY\'S STREETS FOR A DAY AS ARMY 
STOOD BY.  THIS WAS AN OMINOUS DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH 
AND WILL AND ABILITY TO ACT THAT WILL SHARPEN EXISTING 
BATTLE LINES AND TENSIONS IN LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  BUSLOADS OF HEAVILY ARMED HIZBALLAH DEMONSTRATORS, 
BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND ESTIMATED BY WESTERN NEWS AGENCIES 
TO NUMBER 1500-12,000, DROVE FROM BEIRUT TO SIDON ON 
FEBRUARY 18 TO MARCH THROUGH CITY STREETS, BURNING THE 
LEBANESE FLAG AND SHOUTING SLOGANS AGAINST PRESIDENT 
GEMAYEL.  SOME 20 SHOPS SELLING ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
WERE SACKED.  AS SIDON RESIDENTS AND LAF TROOPS LOOKED 
ON WITHOUT INTERVENING, DEMONSTRATORS ARMED WITH AK-47S 
AND ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES RALLIED IN CITY SQUARES, 
SHOUTING SLOGANS SUCH AS \"DEATH TO GEMAYEL,\" \"SIDON IS 
MUSLIM AND CANNOT BE RULED BY A MARONITE,\" AND \"GEMAYEL 
IS AN AGENT.\"  DEMONSTRATORS WAVED IRANIAN AND HIZBALLAH 
FLAGS AND CARRIED PICTURES OF AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI.  A 
SMALLER GROUP OF AMAL MEMBERS CONDUCTED THEIR OWN 
DEMONSTRATION SEPARATE FROM THAT OF HIZBALLAH.  (AMAL 
LATER ISSUED A STATEMENT DENOUNCING THE HIZBALLAH RALLIES 
AND CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE.) 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AT THE ARMY CHECKPOINT AT 
KHALDE, LAF TROOPS CHEERED AND WAVED THE BUS CONVOY 
THROUGH, WHILE PSP MILITIAMEN FURTHER SOUTH ALSO 
WELCOMED IT. 
 
5.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY STAR, SIDON DEPUTY 
NAZIH BIZRI, A SUNNI, EXPRESSED DISMAY THAT THE 
MILITIAMEN IGNORED THE AGREEMENT REACHED BY SIDON\'S 
LEADERS NOT TO ALLOW THE BEARING OF ARMS IN THE CITY.  HE 
SAID THAT THE PEOPLE OF SIDON WERE CROSS AND ANGRY, BUT 
THAT THE INCIDENT WILL NOT SPOIL THE UNITY OF THE CITY. 
HE SAID THAT THE ARMY DID NOT INTERVENE IN ORDER NOT TO 
PROVOKE A CLASH.  ON MONDAY, A GROUP OF SIDON SUNNI 
NOTABLES ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE CONDEMNING MONDAY\'S \"ARMED 
AND MASSIVE\" DEMONSTRATION.  \"WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE, 
REGARDLESS OF FACTION, TO VIOLATE THE DECISION TO BAN 
ARMS FROM THE LIBERATED CITY, OTHER THAN THOSE OF THE 
ARMY AND THE ISF.\" 
 
6.  COMMENT: THE FEBRUARY 16 MANIFESTO AND MONDAY\'S 
DEMONSTRATION MARK A NEW STEP BY HIZBALLAH TOWARDS BE- 
COMING AN ACTIVE POLITICAL MOVEMENT OVERTLY DECLARING 
AND PURSUING ITS GOAL OF THE ISLAMICIZATION OF LEBANON. 
AT A MINIMUM, THIS MEANS THAT THE TENSIONS AND BATTLE 
LINES AMONG COMPETING FORCES IN LEBANON WILL BE MUCH 
MORE SHARPLY DRAWN: 
 
A.  WITHIN THE SHIA COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS 
PROVIDED GRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF AMAL-HIZBALLAH RIVALRY. 
PRESS REPORTS SPOKE OF EVIDENT DISPLEASURE ON THE PART 
OF AMAL DEMONSTRATORS, WHILE AMAL\'S LATER DENUNCIATION 
OF THE DEMONSTRATION IS THE FIRST EXPLICIT DISAPPROVAL OF 
THIS TYPE THAT WE CAN RECALL.  MOREOVER, HIZBALLAH HAS 
CLEARLY MARKED OUT ITS FUTURE POLITICAL IDENTITY IN 
LEBANON--IN THE SIDON RALLIES, ITS SLOGANS SUPPORTING 
AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC TOOK PRIDE OF PLACE OVER AMAL\'S 
CALLS FOR THROWING THE ISRAELIS OUT OF THE SOUTH. 
 
B.  SUNNI-SHIA.  HIZBALLAH\'S RALLY IN THE VERY HEART 
OF THE SUNNI CAPITAL OF THE SOUTH RECALLS THE WORST FEARS 
OF THE SUNNIS, AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR COMMUNIQUE.  IN 
FURTHER SUNNI REACTION, A DELEGATION FROM THE SUNNI 
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION MAQASSAD (WHICH IS HEADED BY 
SAIB SALAM\'S SON TAMAM) IS TRAVELLING TO SIDON ON 
TUESDAY IN THE WAKE OF REPORTS THAT A PTT EMPLOYEE HAS 
BEEN KILLED BY ARMED MEN NEWLY APPEARING ON CITY STREETS. 
 
C.  THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  THE MONDAY DEMONSTRATIONS 
WILL ALSO EVOKE THE WORST FEARS OF THE CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITY, FURTHER PROVOKING A DEFENSIVE, SEIGE 
MENTALITY AND PUTTING MORE OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF THE 
POLITICAL PROCESS.  WE ARE STRUCK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY 
HIZBALLAH\'S SINGLING OUT THE PHALANGE IN ITS WEEKEND 
COMMUNIQUE AND BY ITS ATTACKS ON GEMAYEL.  THIS, 
TOGETHER WITH JUMBLATT\'S HEATED RHETORIC AGAINST THE 
REGIME AND MIMICKING OF THE ISLAMIC CAUSE OVER THE 
WEEKEND (BEIRUT 0993),WILL HARDLY ENCOURAGE ANY 
CHRISTIAN TENDENCIES TOWARD FLEXIBILITY. 
D.  SECURITY AND THE ROLE OF THE ARMY.  THE LIMP 
AND EVEN HARMFUL PERFORMANCE OF THE ARMY ON MONDAY HAS 
ABRUPTLY NULLIFIED THE EUPHORIA OF THE SIDON CITIZENRY 
AS A RESULT OF THE LAF\'S TRIUMPHAL ENTRY INTO THE CITY 
ON SATURDAY.  PRECISELY WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN 
ORDER AND TO SUPPORT SIDON NOTABLES\' CALLS FOR 
\"DISARMAMENT,\" THE LAF FAILED ITS FIRST, AND PERHAPS 
MOST CRUCIAL, TEST. 
 
7.  IN ONE SENSE, IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THE MORE 
HIZBALLAH COMES OUT OF THE WOODWORK AND BATTLE LINES 
ARE DRAWN, THE BETTER THE SITUATION IS IN TERMS OF 
GALVANIZING BARRI (WHOM WE HAVE BEEN WARNING ON THIS 
VERY TOPIC FOR SOME TIME) AND THE SUNNIS, AT LEAST 
IN SIDON.  ONE THING IS CLEAR: FEW LEBANESE OF ANY 
COMMUNITY OR PERSUASION WANT TO LIVE IN AN ISLAMIC 
REPUBLIC.  (THE BULK OF THE SHIA DO NOT FOLLOW THIS LINE 
YET, ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLE LATENT STRENGTH.) 
IN ANY EVENT, ON THIS POINT, THERE IS A TIE THAT BINDS 
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS TO THE GREAT MAJORITY 
OF CHRISTIANS.  ACCORDINGLY, IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO 
FIND A BASIS FOR CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM COOPERATION IN MEETING 
A THREAT TO ALL OF THEM WHICH IS GREATER THAN ANY 
DIFFERENCES THAT MAY SEPARATE THEM.  THEN AGAIN, THIS 
IS LEBANON.  IN ANY CASE, WE WILL BE CLOSELY TRACKING 
THE REACTION TO THE SIDON DEMONSTRATIONS, PARTICULARLY 
ON THE PART OF THE MODERATE SHIAS.

\"HIZBULLAH\" DEFINES ITS MILITANT POLICY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
\"HIZBULLAH\" (PARTY OF GOD) HAS NOW PUBLICLY DEFINED ITS 
POLICY, GOALS AND IDEOLOGY.  AS A GROUP OF FUNDAMENTALIST 
SHIITES, THEY ARE DEDICATED TO PROMOT ISLAM ON THE 
PATTERN OF KHOMEINI\'S REVOLUTION IN IRAN.  THEY DERIVE 
THEIR APPELATION FROM TWO KORANIC VERSES WHICH READ: 
(1) \"AND WHO SO TAKETH ALLAH AND HIS MESSANGER AND THOSE 
WHO BELIEVE FOR FRIEND (WILL KNOW THAT), LO* THE PARTY 
OF ALLAH THEY ARE THE VICTORIOUS.\" (SURAH 5/56); (2) 
\"THOU WILT NOT FIND FOLK WHO BELIEVE IN ALLAH AND HIS 
MESSENGER, EVEN THOUGH THEY BE THEIR FATHERS OR THEIR 
SONS OR THEIR BRETHREN OR THEIR CLAN.  AS FOR SUCH, HE 
HATH WRITTEN FAITH UPON THEIR HEARTS AND HATH STRENGTHENED 
THEM WITH A SPIRIT FROM HIM, AND HE WILL BRING THEM INTO 
GARDENS UNDERNEATH WHICH RIVERS FLOW, WHEREIN THEY WILL 
ABIDE.  ALLAH IS WELL PLEASED WITH THEM, AND THEY ARE 
WELL PLEASED WITH HIM.  THEY ARE ALLAH\'S PARTY, LO* IS 
IT NOT ALLAH\'S PARTY WHO ARE THE SUCCESSFUL.  (SURAH 
58/22-23). 
 
ANNIVERSARY: MARKING THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
VIOLENT DEATH OF THE MOSLEM CLERIC SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB, 
THE IMAM OF THE VILLAGE OF JABSHIT IN SOUTH LEBANON, 
\"HIZBULLAH\" STAGED A MASS RALLY AT THE CHIYAH SUBURB 
SATURDAY, FEB. 16, 1985.  SHEIKH HARB WAS A STAUNCH 
OPPONENT OF ISRAEL OCCUPATION, AND AN ADVOCATE OF 
\"HIZBULLAH\" AND THE RISE OF A PAN-ISLAMIC \"NATION OF THE 
PARTY OF GOD.\"  HE WAS ASSASSINATED REPORTEDLY BY 
ISRAEL\'S AGENTS IN HIS NATIVE VILLAGE ON FEB. 16, 1984. 
 
THE ORGANIZATION SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFUTE THE 
ACCUSATION THAT IT WAS A HAND OF TERRORISTS.  IT UNDER- 
LINED ITS ALLEGIANCE TO \"WELAYAT AL FAQIH\" (RULE OF THE 
THEOLOGIAN) UNDER IRAN\'S AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. 
AMERICA, FRANCE, ISRAEL AND THE PHALANGE PARTY WERE 
DECLARED AS ITS PRIME ENEMIES.  IT DESCRIBED THE PRESENT 
LEBANESE SYSTEM AS \"DESPOTIC\" AND RENOUNCED THE REGIME 
OF PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL. 
 
OPENING THE MEETING, SHEIKH GHABRIS SAID THAT \"HIZBULLAH\" 
WAS \"MISLEADINGLY DESCRIBED AS A HANDFUL OF FANATICS BENT 
ON KILLING, PLUNDER AND ROBBERY;\" AND THAT THEY WERE 
\"BLAMED FOR EVERY UNPLEASANT INCIDENT.\"  \"BUT,\" HE 
EMPHASIZED, \"IT WAS \"HIZBULLAH\" WHICH ACTIVATED THE 
(FREEDOM) FIGHTERS AND EXPELLED THE ENEMY.\" 
 
MANIFESTO: LATER SHEIKH IBRAHIM AL AMIN READ OUT AT THE 
RALLY A 48-PAGE \"MESSAGE\" DEDICATED TO THE \"MARTYR 
SHEIKH RAGHEB HARB\" WHICH WAS TANTAMOUNT TO A MANIFESTO 
OF THE PARTY. (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE \').  THIS WAS 
THE FIRST TIME \"HIZBULLAH\" DEFINED ITS MILITANT POSITION 
AND IDEOLOGY SINCE IT MADE ITS IMPACT ON LEBANESE 
POLITICS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  THE MESSAGE IDENTIFIED 
THE MOSLEM FUNDAMENTALIST MEMBERS OF \"HIZBALLAH\" AS \"THE 
CHILDREN OF THE NATION WHOSE VANGUARD IN IRAN WAS 
BESTOWED WITH VICTORY.\" 
 
\"THIS VANGUARD,\" THE MESSAGE WENT ON, \"HAS LAID THE 
FOUNDATION OF A PAN-ISLAMIC STATE UNDER THE WISE GUIDANCE 
OF THE FULLY QUALIFIED FAQIH AYATULLAH RUHALLAH KHOMEINI. 
\"HIZBULLAH\" MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT HAD NO CARD-CARRYING 
MEMBERS, \"BUT IT IS LINKED TO ALL MOSLEMS IN THE WORLD 
BY THE STRONG IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL BOND OF ISLAM.\" 
 
EAST AND WEST:  THE STATEMENT ATTACKED THE \"HAUTY\" POWERS 
OF THE EAST AND WEST ALIKE.  IT SAID: \"AMERICA HAS TRIED, 
THROUGH ITS LOCAL AGENTS, TO CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT 
THOSE WHO DESTROYED ITS ARROGANCE IN LEBANON AND FOILED 
ITS CONSPIRACIES WERE BUT A HANDFUL OF FANATIC TERRORISTS 
WHO HAVE NO MISSION BUT TO BLOW UP LIQUOR STORES, 
GAMBLING CASINOS AND AMUSEMENT MACHINES.\" 
 
THE STATEMENT POINTED OUT THAT SUCH PRACTICES WERE ONLY 
MARGINAL DEALING WITH THE TAIL INSTEAD OF THE HEAD. \"WE 
ARE HEADED FOR DEALING WITH EVIL AT THE ROOTS, AND THE 
ROOTS ARE AMERICA,\" IT SAID, AND STRESSED THAT NOTHING 
WILL TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER FIGHTING THE U.S. 
\"HIZBULLAH\" BELIEVES THAT BOTH WESTERN CAPITALISM AND 
EASTERN COMMUNISM HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE THE REQUIREMENTS 
OF THE MASSES.  \"THE ANSWER LIES IN THE MISSION OF ISLAM,\" 
IT SAID. 
 
DEMANDS:  THE DECLARATION DEMANDED: 1. COMPLETE EVACUATION 
OF ISRAEL ARMY FROM LEBANON \"AS A PRELUDE FOR THE REMOVAL 
OF ISRAEL FROM EXISTENCE AND LIBERATING JERUSALEM FROM 
CLAWS OF OCCUPATION.\"  2. \"AMERICA, FRANCE AND THEIR 
ALLIES MUST LEAVE LEBANON ONCE AND FOR ALL, AND ANY 
IMPERIAL INFLUENCE IN THE COUNTRY MUST BE TERMINATED.\" 
3. \"THE PHALANGISTS MUST BE SUBJECTED TO JUSTICE AND BE 
BROUGHT TO TRIAL FOR ALL THE CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED 
AGAINST THE MOSLEMS AND THE CHRISTIANS WITH ENCOURAGEMENT 
FROM AMERICAN AND ISRAEL.\"  4. \"ALL OUR LEBANESE PEOPLE 
MUST BE GIVEN THE CHANCE OF DETERMINING THEIR FUTURE 
AND CHOOSES THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THEY WANT, BEARING 
IN MIND THAT WE WILL NOT GIVE UP OUR COMMITMENT TO THE 
RULE OF ISLAM.\" 
 
POLITICAL \"MARONISM\":  THE POLICY OF THE LEADERS OF 
\"POLITICAL MARONISM\" AS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE \"LEBANESE 
FRONT\" AND THE \"LEBANESE FORCES\" MILITIA CAN NEVER 
ACHIEVE PEACE OR STABILITY FOR THE CHRISTIANS, SAID 
\"HIZBULLAH\".  \"IT IS A POLICY BASED ON FANATICISM, 
SECTARIAN PRIVILEGES AND ALLIANCE WITH IMPERIALISM AND 
ISRAEL,\" IT ADDED. 
 
UNIFIL:  THE INTERNATIONAL PEACE-KEEPING FORCE 
(UNIFIL) OPERATING IN SOUTH LEBANON, IS ACCUSED 
BY \"HIZBULLAH\" OF STANDING AS A \"BUFFER\" IMPEDING 
THEIR RESISTANCE AND \"MAINTAINING ISRAELI\'S 
SECURITY AND INVADING FORCES.\"  \"HIZBULLAH\" 
DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWDOWN 
WITH UNIFIL \"IF IT CONTINUED TO CONNIVE WITH THE 
ENEMY.\" 
 
OTHER ARAB STATES \"ANXIOUSLY SEEKING PEACE WITH 
ISRAEL\" ALSO CAME UNDER FIRE FROM \"HIZBULLAH\". 
THEY WERE URGED INSTEAD TO CLOSE THEIR RANKS, 
DEFINE THEIR AIMS PRECISELY AND BREAK THE 
FETTERS RESTRICTING THEIR WILL. 
 
MARCH:  ARMED MEMBERS OF \"HIZBULLAH WERE REPORTED 
TO HAVE MARCHED INTO SIDON MONDAY, FEB. 18, 
AND TORE LEBANESE FLAGS AND PICTURES OF PRESIDENT 
GEMAYEL.  (SEE MER OF FEB. 19, PAGE 2).  THEY 
SMASHED A NUMBER OF STORES AND SUPER MARKETS 
SELLING LIQUOR, AND RAISED IRANIAN FLAGS AND 
PORTRAITS OF THE IRANIAN RELIGIOUS LEADER 
AYATULLAH KHOMEINI.  THE ACTION WAS SEEN AS A 
BACKLASH TO THE VISIT TO THE CITY THE DAY BEFORE 
BY PRESIDENT GEMAYEL JEERED BY THE ARMED DEM- 
ONSTRATORS \"THE SHAH OF LEBANON\". 
 
THE GEMAYELS:  IN ITS STATEMENT, \"HIZBULLAH\" 
LASHED OUT AGAINST PRESIDENT AMIN GEMAYEL AND HIS 
BROTHER THE LATE BASHIR.  IT SAID:  \"THE BUTCHER 
BASHIR HAD REACHED THE PRESIDENCY WITH THE 
HELP OF ISRAEL, THE ARAB OIL PRINCES AND SYCOPHANT 
MOSLEM MPS FLATTERING THE PHALANGISTS.\" 
 
\"THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN ATTEMPT TO RECTIFY HIS 
REPUGNANT IMAGE BY AN EXERCISE CALLED THE 
\"SALVATION COMMITTEE,\" WHICH WAS BUT AN 
AMERICAN-ISRAELI BRIDGE USED BY THE PHALANGISTS 
TO ACHIEVE CONTROL OVER THE OPPRESSED PEOPLE. 
HOWEVER, OUR PEOPLE COULD NOT TOLERATE SUCH 
HUMILIATION.  THEY DASHED THE DREAMS OF THE 
ZIONISTS AND THEIR ALLIES.  AMERICA NEVERTHELESS, 
PERSISTED IN ITS FOLLIES AND BROUGHT (PRESIDENT) 
AMIN GEMAYEL TO SUCCEED HIS BROTHER.  THE FIRST 
THING HE DID WAS TO DESTROY THE HOUSES OF THE 
DISPLACED PEOPLE FROM THE SOUTH, DEFILE THE 
ISLAMIC MOSQUES, ORDER THE ARMY TO BOMBARD THE 
DOWN-TRODDAN SUBURB AND DESTRUCT  THE HOUSES 
ON THEIR OCCUPANTS, AND TO CALL IN NATO FORCES 
TO HELP HIM AGAINST US, CONCLUDE THE NOTORIOUS

TRANSFORMED LEBANON INTO AN ISRAELI PROTECTORATE

U.S. AND NATO:  \"HIZBULLAH\" DECLARED \"CLEARLY

WE CANNOT TOLERATE INJUSTICE, AGGRESSION AND

EXERCISING AGGRESSION ON US WITH A VIEW TO

REF: BEIRUT 1635 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY. A COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE 
MARONITE PARTIARCH CONTINUES ITS EFFORTS TO 
RECONCILE DIFFERENCES WHICH ERUPTED ON MARCH 13 
WITHIN THE LEBANESE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY BETWEEN 
JA\'JA\'S \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT\" AND 
PHALANGISTS LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT.  THERE HAS 
BEEN NO SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS SO FAR, BUT 
RECONCILATION EFFORTS CONTINUE. 
 
2.  (U) THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND REMAINS 
LARGELY UNCHANGED, WITH JA\'JA\'S MILITIAMEN 
CONTROLING MOST OF THE CHRISTIAN REGION FROM 
JUBAYL (BYBLOS) SOUTH TO THE DOG RIVER AND ALSO 
MUCH OF EAST BEIRUT ITSELF, INCLUDING 
ASHRAFIYAH.  PHALANGE MILITIAMEN LOYAL TO THE 
PRESIDENT CONTROL ONLY THE METN, THE GEMAYEL 
FIEFDOM SITUATED BETWEEN THE AREAS HELD BY 
JA\'JA\'.  ALL OF THESE AREAS REMAIN TENSE BUT 
CALM, EXCEPT FOR SOME ISOLATED CLASHES BETWEEN 
RIVAL LF GROUPS AT DAWRA (NEAR BEIRUT PORT) ON 
MORNING OF MARCH 15.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (U)  THE SEVEN-MEMBER CHRISTIAN 
RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE, ESTABLISHED BY THE 
CHRISTIAN CONCLAVE CONVOKED URGENTLY BY GEMAYEL 
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE FOLLOWING JA\'JA\'S 
MARCH 13 UPRISING, MET FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 
BKERKE ON MARCH 14.  AT THIS SECOND MEETING, THE 
RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS CHAIRED BY 
MARONITE PARTRIARCH KHURAYSH, WAS ABLE TO MEET 
WITH VARIOUS LF OFFICIALS, INCLUDING FOR THE 
FIRST TIME JA\'JA\' HIMSELF AND HIS MAIN 
SUPPORTERS.  BESIDES THE PARTRIARCH, THE 
RECONCILATION COMMITTEE INCLUDES CHRISTIAN MP\'S 
ELIAS HRAOUI, MICHEL MURR, KHATCHIG BABIKIAN, 
GEBRANE TOK, MIKEAL DAHER, AND KHALIL ABUHAMAD. 
AT THE MARCH 14 BKERKE MEETING, THEY MET WITH THE 
FOLLOWING MEMBERS OF THE LF COMMAND COUNCIL: 
SAMIR JA\'JA\', ELIE HOBEIKA, TONY BRIDI, CHARLES 
GHOSTIN, NAOUM FARAH, ELIE ASSWAD, SAMIR TAWILE, 
AND FAWZI MAHFUZ.  LF COMMANER FUAD ABU NADIR DID 
NOT ATTEND, BUT HIS PREDECESSOR, FADI FREM, DID. 
 
4.  (U) JUDGING FROM THE COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AFTER 
THE BKERKE MEETING, LITTLE PROGRESS WAS MADE 
DURING THIS FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH JA\'JA\'.  \"THE 
CHRISTIAN DECISON MOVEMENT,\" AS JA\'JA\'S GROUP NOW 
OFFICIALLY CALLS ITSELF, REAFFIRMED ITS POLITICAL 
NATURE, ITS DESIRE TO AVOID VIOLENCE, AND ITS AIM 
OF \"REINFORCING THE INDEPENDENCE AND GLOBALITY OF 
CHRISTIAN DECISION ACCORDING TO DEMOCRATIC 
RULES.\"  IN THE COMMUNIQUE, JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT ALSO 
REAFFIRMED ITS RESPECT FOR EXISTING LAWS AND 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.  IT CLAIMED THAT IT WAS 
\"PURELY AND UNIQUELY LEBANESE CHRISTIAN,\" I.E., 
NOT ISRAELI BACKED.  FOLLOWING THE MEETING, 
HOBEIKA CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL OF ROADBLOCKS 
WHICH HAVE ISOLATED CERTAIN CHRISTIAN AREAS, MOST 
NOTABLY THE ROADBLOCK ESTABLISHED BY LOYALIST 
FORCES AT THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE METN 
IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE DOG RIVER TUNNEL ON THE 
COASTAL HIGHWAY BETWEEN DUBAYYAH AND JUNNIYAH. 
 
5.  (U) FOLLOWING THE BKERKE MEETING, THE 
RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE REPORTEDLY TOLD 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL THAT (A) JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT WAS A 
MATTER WITHIN THE PHALANGE PARTY AND BETWEEN THAT 
PARTY AND THE LEBANESE FORCES AND (B) THAT JA\'JA\' 
HAD NO INTENTION OF LEADING A COUP D\'ETAT.  THE 
RECONCILATION COMMITTEE THEN MET WITH THE 
PHALANGE PARTY POLITBURO. 
 
6. (C) SIMULTANEOUSLY FOLLOWING THE BKERKE 
MEETING, JA\'JA\' AND HIS MAJOR SUPPORTERS MET AT 
THE HOME OF BASHIR GEMAYEL\'S WIDOW, SOLANGE, AND 
FORMED AN \"EMERGENCY COMMITTEE\" COMPOSED OF ABU 
NADIR, JA\'JA\', HOBEIKA, FREM, BRIDI, GHOSTIN, 
KARIM PAKRADUNI, AND GEORGES ADWAN.  SO 
FAR, THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS NOT BEEN 
ANNOUNCED BUT NAOUM FARAH (SEPTEL) CONFIRMED 
THAT IT IS AN EMBRYONIC POLITBURO OR COMMAND 
COUNCIL FOR JA\'JA\'S \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT.\" 
 
7.  (U) EARLIER ON MARCH 14, PRESIDENT GEMAYEL 
RECEIVED GENERAL MUHAMMAD KHOLI, AN EMISSARY SENT 
BY SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD REPORTEDLY TO REAFFIRM 
SYRIAN SUPPORT.  IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AT THIS 
POINT THAT SYRIAN VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM WILL 
RETURN TO LEBANON ON MARCH 16 TO CONTINUE THE 
INTERCOMMUNAL POLITICAL TALKS UNTERTAKEN LAST 
MARCH 9-10 AT BIKFAYYA. 
 
8.  (U) IN REACTION TO JA\'JA\'S CHALLENGE, DRUZE 
LEADER WALID JUMBLATT, SPEAKING FOR THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT, LENT SUPPORT TO THE PRESIDENCY 
AND VEHEMENTLY CRITICIZED JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT AS \"AN 
ISRAELI ATTEMPT TO TORPEDO THE POLITICAL ACCORD 
BEING DRAWN UP UNDER THE AUSPICES OF SYRIAN 
LEADERS.\"  THE NDF REITERATED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE 
\"SYRIAN OPTION.\" 
 
9. (C) LATE NOTE:  ACCORDING TO NAOUM FARAH (SEPTEL), 
THE \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT\" DOES,IN FACT, 
SUPPORT THE REOPENING OF THE DOG RIVER TUNNEL AND 
SEVERAL BRIDGES BLOCKED BY PHALANGE MILITIAMEN FROM 
THE METN LOYAL TO GEMAYEL.  AS OF EARLY AFTERNOON 
MARCH 15, THE LATTER HAD AGREED TO REMOVE THE 
BLOCKADES AND TURN THE CHOKE POINTS OVER TO THE LAF.

SUBJECT:  JA\'JA\'S MOVEMENT COMMUNIQUE 
 
1.  ON MARCH 14, SAMIR JA\'JA\'S FORCES, NOW 
CALLED THE \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT,\" 
ISSUED THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE OUTLINING THEIR 
AIMS. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
\"THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUERIES LATELY ABOUT WHAT 
EVER HAPPENED TO THE AUTONOMOUS DECISION OF THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, ON WHETHER THIS COMMUNITY 
HAD ACTUALLY LOST THE INITIATIVE, ON WHETHER 
SUBSISTANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL UPHEAVAL EMBODIED 
BY BASHIR GEMAYEL\'S POLICY HAS BEEN OVERSTEPPED 
BY TIME AND ON WHETHER CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS 
FOR CONSULTATION AND DECISION HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED 
OR HAVE JUST FALLEN INTO DISUSE, THE STATEMENT 
SAID. 
 
\"IN ANY CASE, WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE? THE STATE- 
MENT ADDED.  SOME SAY IT SHOULD BE THE POLITICAL 
COMPROMISES UNDERWAY WHILE OTHERS SPEAK, AFTER 
THE FALL OF INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES, OF 
REGIONAL GUARANTEES INSTEAD.  WHATEVER THE 
CASE MAY BE, ALL THESE MATTERS CAN BE DISCUSSED. 
BUT WHAT IS CRYSTAL-CLEAR IS THAT THERE CAN 
BE NO SOLID POLITICAL SOLUTION UNLESS COUPLED 
WITH AN ADEQUATE BALANCE OF FORCES BEARING 
CLEAR-OUT FEATURES AND AN UNEQUIVOCAL POLITICAL 
STRATEGY TO GO ALONG WITH AN AUTONOMOUS DECISION 
FREED FROM ALL TRUSTEESHIPS. 
 
\"THE RESTORATION OF THE DECISION AND THE SOCIAL 
CENTRALIZATION OF IT CAN, ALONE, PROVIDE THE 
PROPER FRAME FOR ANY SERIOUS DISCUSSION LIKELY 
TO LEAD US TO THE KIND OF PEACE ASPIRED TO, 
FOR WE REJECT THE PEACE RESULTING FROM SUBMITTING 
TO OTHER PEOPLE\'S WILL. 
 
\"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT HAS PROVIDED THE 
ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUERIES.  THIS MOVEMENT 
ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES THE ORGANIZED EXPRESSION 
OF THE WILL OF THE BASE OF ALL CHRISTIAN IN- 
STITUTIONS IN RECUPERATING THE DECISION AND THE 
INITIATIVE, AND THERE CANNOT BE, FROM THIS DAY 
FORWARD, NO RELIANCE BUT ON THE AUTONOMOUS 
DECISION AND NO GUARANTEE BUT THROUGH POLICIES THAT 
INCARNATE THIS DECISION. 
 
\"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THE SECURITY OF THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE DEPENDING ANYMORE 
ON THE CHANGES OF INTERNATIONAL OR REGIONAL 
POLICIES AND THERE WILL BE NO POLITICAL WILL 
LINKED TO THE MOODS AND DISPOSITIONS THAT 
GOVERN POLITICAL INTERCOURSE IN THIS TORMENTED 
COUNTRY. 
 
\"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THERE WILL BE NO 
CHRISTIAN SOCIETY WITH A CRIPPLED WILL AND KEPT 
DEPRIVED OF POLICYMAKING AT HOME AND ON THE 
REGIONAL PLANE AS WELL, AND RULED BY VIOLENT 
WARRING STRATEGIES. 
 
\"THE BASIS FOR AN OBJECTIVE COOPERATION WITH 
A REALITY OF THE KIND WE HAVE DEPICTED IS CLEAR 
AND CAN BE DEFINED, IN BRIEF, AS FOLLOWS: 
 
\"EXTREMISM CANNOT BE DETERRED OTHERWISE THAN 
BY STEADFASTNESS, AND HEGEMONY AND DISCRIMINATORY 
PHENOMENA CANNOT BE HANDLED BUT THROUGH CLEAR 
POLITICAL WILLS AND IDEAS AND ADEQUATE EXECUTIVE 
INSTRUMENTS. 
 
\"ONLY WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FREEDOM OF DECISION IS 
RESTORED AND THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF IT 
CLEARLY DEFINED CAN NEGOTIATION AND INTERCOURSE 
WITH ALL SIDES BECOME POSSIBLE, ON THE HOME FRONT 
AND ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD 
BE ENGAGED INTO A DANGEROUS TURNING POINT LIKELY 
TO WIPE OUT WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR ENERGIES, OUR 
CREDIBILITY AND OUR EFFICIENCY. 
 
\"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT CONSIDERS THAT 
THE SETTING UP OF NEW BASES FOR DEALINGS AND 
DIALOGUE HAS BECOME AN INDISPENSIBLE PRE- 
REQUISITE FOR LIBERATING THE LEBANESE INDEPENDENT 
DECISION WHICH, ALONE, IS CAPABLE OF ALLOWING 
US TO FACE SUCCESSFULLY THE SECOND DECADE OF 
OUR BITTER STRUGGLE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE MUST: 
 
\"FIRSTLY, RESHUFFLE THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND IN- 
 
STITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY; 
 
\"SECONDLY, REBUILD THE SOCIAL SECURITY OF THE 
CHRISTIANS ON NEW FOUNDATIONS BASED UPON: 
 
A)  AN INSTITUTIONAL AND CENTRAL CHRISTIAN 
INDEPENDENT DECISION; 
 
B)  A CO-ORDINATING, CONSULTATIVE AND EXECUTIVE 
FRAMEWORK GROUPING THE VARIOUS SOCIAL AND CHURCH 
LEADERSHIPS; 
 
C)  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRATEGIES OF A COMPLEMENTARY 
NATURE AIMED OVERRUNNING ALL STANDING DIFFICULTIES. 
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THIS IS THE CORRECTION OF 
THE STRUCTURES AS TO ENSURE THEIR ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL EFFICIENCY; 
 
D)LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY PERFORMING THEIR 
NATIONAL OVERALL REPRESENTATIVE ROLE; 
 
E)  AN ETHNIC AND CULTURAL IDENTITY WITH CLEAR- 
CUT FEATURES AND CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL BALANCED 
STRATEGIES. 
 
\"CHRISTIAN LEBANESE, 
 
\"WE ARE A PEOPLE WHOSE ENTITY IS BASED UPON RESPECT 
AND COMMITMENT TOWARDS ALL CAUSES INVOLVING THE 
FATE OF MAN OR HIS DIGNITY AND WHEREVER MAN\'S 
LIBERTIES ARE JEOPARDIZED OR UNSECURE. 
 
\"THERE CAN BE NO HAZARDS IN CHRISTIANITY BUT DECISIONS 
INSPIRED BY THE HOLY GOSPEL, BY JESUS-CHRIST\'S OWN 
WORDS:  SPEAK ALWAYS THE TRUTH AND BE STRAIGHT- 
FORWARD:  NO FOR NO AND YEST FOR YES\".  END TEXT.

SUBJECT:  JA\'JA\'S \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT\": 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., MOTIVES, AND OBJECTIVES 
 
REF:  BEIRUT 1635 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  POLOFF MET MARCH 15 WITH LONGTIME CONTACT NAOUM 
FARAH, DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THE LEBANESE 
FORCES AND NOW AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN JA\'JA\'S 
\"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT.\"  FARAH, WHO UNTIL 
EARLY MARCH WAS ALSO THE OFFICIAL LF SPOKESMAN, REQUESTED 
THE MEETING. 
 
----------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. 
----------------------- 
3.  FARAH STATED AT THE OUTSET THAT THE LEBANESE FORCES 
(WHICH HE CONSIDERS SYNONYMOUS FOR ALL INTENTS AND 
PURPOSES WITH JA\'JA\'S \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT\") 
HAD BEEN \"BOTHERED\" BY THE USG STATEMENT ON MARCH 13 
CHARACTERIZING EVENTS OF THAT DAY IN EAST BEIRUT AS 
A \"NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT.\"  HE ALSO EXPRESSED DISMAY 
OVER STATEMENTS ORIGINATING IN WASHINGTON THAT AMERICAN 
EMBASSY PERSONNEL WERE BEING EVACUATED BECAUSE OF EVENTS 
IN EAST BEIRUT.  SUCH STATEMENTS, HE SAID, GIVE A FALSE 
IMPRESSION OF THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND THE 
OBJECTIVES OF THE MOVEMENT. 
 
4.  WHILE HE SAID THE MOVEMENT FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE 
U.S. DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF \"LA LEGALITE,\" HE 
COULD NOT CONSIDER RECENT EVENTS A  \"NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT. 
TO THE CONTRARY, HE SAID, WHAT IS HAPPENING IS \"VERY 
HEALTHY FOR THE CHRISTIANS AND FOR THE WEST, STARTING 
WITH THE U.S.\"  \"WE HOPE,\" FARAH CONTINUED, \"THAT 
THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT CONTINUE TO TAKE FROM THE 
VERY BEGINNING A HOSTILE POSITION TOWARDS THIS MOVEMENT, 
A POSITION WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE THE FUTURE OF OUR 
RECIPROCAL RELATIONS.\"  \"WE WANT TO ENSURE,\" HE SAID, 
\"THAT OUR RELATIONS ARE EXCELLENT WITH THE U.S., BECAUSE 
WE CONSIDER THAT WE ARE FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHT, 
CONFRONTING THE SAME ENEMY.\" 
 
5.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT, AS FARAH WAS ALREADY AWARE 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT\'S STATEMENT AND FROM CONVERSATIONS 
EMBOFFS HAD ALREADY HAD WITH MEMBERS OF THE \"CHRISTIAN 
DECISION MOVEMENT,\" THE U.S. CONSIDERED THE EVENTS OF 
THIS WEEK A NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY DIVIDED 
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT 
PRECISELY WHEN THEY NEEDED TO BE STRONG AND UNITED 
TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL REFORMS. 
 
---------------------- 
MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES 
---------------------- 
6.  FARAH INTERRUPTED TO \"ASSURE THE U.S. OFFICIALLY\" 
THAT THE MOVEMENT (A) WAS  NOT AN ATTEMPTED COUP D\'ETAT, 
(B) WAS NOT DIRECTED AGAINST THE PRESIDENCY OR THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF (\"WE HAVE NOT ASKED HIM TO RESIGN.\"), 
AND (C) IS AGAINST THE USE OF FORCE AND AGAINST BLOODSHED. 
FARAH ADDED THAT THE MOVEMENT HAD CALLED FOR, SINCE 
YESTERDAY, MARCH 14R THE REOPENING OF THE DOG RIVER 
TUNNEL AND THE BRIDGES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOCKED BY THE 
\"FOLKS FROM THE METN,\" I.E., PHALANGE MILITIAMEN LOYAL 
TO THE PRESIDENT.  FARAH CLAIMED THAT THESE LATTER 
FORCES HAD TURNED OVER THESE CHOKE POINTS TO THE LAF 
AND THAT WITHIN A FEW HOURS TRAFFIC COULD FLOW FREELY 
AGAIN. 
 
7.  AS FOR THE MOTIVES UNDERLYING THE \"CHRISTIAN DECISION 
MOVEMENT,\"  FARAH SAID THAT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL HAS TRIED TO PLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY TWO 
INCOMPATIBLE ROLES:  FIRST THAT OF PRESIDENT OF THE 
REPUBLIC, I.E., OF ALL LEBANESE REGARDLESS OF THEIR 
CONFESSIONAL AFFILIATION, AND SECOND THAT OF LEADER OF 
THE CHRISTIANS.   THESE TWO ROLES ARE INCOMPATIBLE, 
FARAH EXPLAINED, BECAUSE, AS CHIEF OF STATE, GEMAYEL 
IS OBLIGED TO MAKE CERTAIN CONCESSIONS THAT HE SHOULD NOT 
MAKE AS LEADER OF THE CHRISTIANS. 
 
8.  FARAH CITED THE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THE MARCH 9-10 
BIKFAYYA TALKS WHERE GEMAYEL \"FACED FOUR ENEMIES:  KHADDAM 
KARAMI, BARRI, AND JUMBLATT,\" AND WHERE HE MADE CONCESSION 
WHICH WERE UNACCEPTABLE FOR HIM TO MAKE AS THE CHRISTIAN 
LEADER.  THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN, FARAH SAID, A SEPARATE 
CHRISTIAN REPRESENTATIVE PRESENT SO THAT THE PRESIDENT 
COULD HAVE PLAYED THE OVERARCHING ROLE OF CHIEF OF STATE. 
 
9.  FURTHERMORE, FARAH CLAIMED, GEMAYEL\'S PLAYING THESE 
TWO INCOMPATIBLE ROLES HAS STYMIED THE DECISION-MAKING 
PROCESS  WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  FOR SEVERAL 
MONTHS, HE SAID, NO ONE IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY HAS 
DARED TO SPEAK THEIR MIND. 
 
10.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT,\" 
FARAH STATED, IS TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BY THE 
FORMATION OF A COUNCIL COMPRISING REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
ALL LEBANESE CHRISTIAN GROUPS, INCLUDING BOTH POLITICAL 
AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS.  VARIOUS POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE 
LEBANESE FORCES WOULD BE REPRESENTED ON THE COUNCIL. 
THE ROLE OF THE COUNCIL WOULD NOT BE MERELY CONSULTATIVE, 
FARAH STRESSED, BUT ALSO \"DECISIONAL.\"  THE COUNCIL 
WOULD FORMULATE CHRISTIAN POLICIES,AND A REPRESENTATIVE 
SELECTED BY THE COUNCIL WOULD PARTICIPATE IN NEGOTIATIONS 
WITH THE MUSLIMS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CHIEF OF STATE. 
 
11.  FARAH THEN SET FORTH THREE STEPS WHICH GEMAYEL MUST 
NOT/NOT TAKE:  (A) HE MUST NOT ATTEMPT TO USE THE LAF 
AGAINST THE MOVEMENT BOTH BECAUSE THE LAF WOULD NOT FOLLOW 
HIS ORDERS AND BECAUSE THE LAF WOULD DISINTEGRATE AND 
MUCH OF ITS EQUIPMENT WOULD FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE 
LF MILITIA. (FARAH CLAIMED THAT GEMAYEL HAD ACTUALLY 
CALLED ON THE ARMY TO INTERVENE EARLY ON MARCH 13 BUT THAT 
THE ARMY LEADERSHIP HAD REFUSED.)  (B) HE MUST NOT PUSH 
THE PHALANGE PARTY TO USE WHAT REMAINS OF ITS METN-BASED 
MILITIA AGAINST THE LF BECAUSE THE LF WILL EASILY CRUSH 
THEM.  AND (C) HE MUST NOT EVEN THINK OF ASKING SYRIAN 
FORCES TO INTERVENE, BECAUSE IF ONE SYRIAN SHELL STRIKES 
THE CHRISTIAN REGION GEMAYEL WILL LOSE ALL CREDIBILITY AND 
THE \"CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT\" WILL SIMPLY GAIN SUPPORT 
 
12.  AS A FOOTNOTE, FARAH ADDED THAT THE RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE MARONITE PATRIARCH HAD ALREADY 
MET SEVERAL TIMES WITH JA\'JA\' AND OTHER FIGURES IN 
THE MOVEMENT (INCLUDING FARAH) AND THAT IT WAS CLEAR 
THAT THE COMMITTEE FOUND THE MOVEMENT\'S MOTIVES TO BE 
WELL-FOUNDED AND REASONABLE.  RECALLING WHAT POLOFF HAD 
SAID (PARA. 5) ABOUT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DIVISIONS 
WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AT THIS TIME, FARAH SAID 
THAT HE AND MANY OTHERS IN THE MOVEMENT HOPED THAT THE 
ULTIMATE RESULT WOULD BE POSITIVE, I.E., A MORE UNIFIED 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, SURE OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT 
IS HEADED, AND SOLIDLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENT.  HE CONCLUDED 
BY ASKING FOR U.S. \"UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE.\" 
 
13.  COMMENT.  FARAH WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO SET FORTH 
CLEARLY THE MOTIVES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE \"CHRISTIAN 
DECISION MOVEMENT.\"  AWARE OF THE TOUGH REPUTATION (TO 
SAY THE LEAST) OF THE MOVEMENT\'S LEADERS, HE EVIDENTLY 
WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAD WIDE BACKING WITHIN 
THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY , THAT THE MOVEMENT WAS PROCEEDING 
RATIONALLY AND REASONABLY, AND THAT IT DESERVED U.S. UNDER- 
STANDING IF NOT SUPPORT.

2.  MOD SOURCES HAVE INFORMED EMBASSY OF THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
SYRIAN LINES IN THE NORTH HAVE NOT REPEAT NOT 
CHANGED.  HOWEVER, REDISPOSITION OF UNITS HAS 
TAKEN PLACE TO INCLUDE POSITIONING OF TWO STALIN 
MULTIPLE 36 TWO ROCKET LAUNCHERS AND A PLATOON 
(5) OF TANKS ON KEY TERRAIN FEATURE (OVERLOOKING 
VILLAGE OF IBRIE WHICH FACES THE CAZA OF 
JUBAYL (BYBLOS) WHICH IS JA\'JA\'S TURF.)  ADDITIONALLY, 
WHAT APPEARS TO BE SYRIAN ARMORED BATTALION (20- 
25 TANKS) HAS TAKEN UP POSITIONS BETWEEN BATROUN 
AND SHIKA.  3,000 TROOPS OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION 
ARMY ALSO HAVE MOVED INTO POSITIONS AROUND 
BISHRI, WHICH IS HOME VILLAGE OF JA\'JA\', AND THEY 
ARE FORTIFYING THESE POSITIONS. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  ALL REDISPOSITIONS ARE WITHIN 
EXISTING SYRIAN LINES.  THAT SAID, THEY SEND 
A CLEAR AND OBVIOUS SIGNAL. 
WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF THIS 
INFORMATION.  BUT IF THE SYRIANS USE FORCE 
AGAINST THE DISSIDENTS IT WILL HAVE DEVASTATING 
IMPACT ON THE ENTIRE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND COULD 
WELL FORCE THEM TO RALLY ROUND THE FLAG CARRIED 
BY THE JA JA GROUP.  WE WOULD ALSO BE BLAMED 
BY SOME--CITING OUR \"DEFACTO ALLIANCE\" WITH THE 
SYRIANS AGAINST THE DISSIDENTS--AND SUBJECTED TO 
APPEALS TO INTERCEDE WITH THE SYRIANS. 
 
4.  SYRIA MAY, INDEED, BE ONLY RATTLING ITS 
SABER AT THIS POINT.  WASHINGTON AND DAMASCUS 
MIGHT NONETHELESS CONSIDER APPROACHING SARG 
TO CITE REPORTS OF SYRIAN REDISPOSITIONS AND TO 
SAY THAT CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY IS WORKING POLITICAL 
SOLUTION TO THE INTERNAL DISPUTE AND SYRIAN USE 
OF FORCE WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND 
DAMAGING FOR UNITY AND STABILITY OF LEBANON.  END

2.  SYRIA CONTINUES TO EXERT POLITICAL AND MILITARY 
PRESSURE AGAINST DISSIDENT ELEMENTS OF THE 
LEBANESE FORCES.  STATEMENTS FROM DAMASCUS BY 
SYRIAN AND LEBANESE LEADERS HINT AT RETALIATION 
IF THE REVOLT CONTINUES.  AFTER MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENT ASSAD, FORMER PRESIDENT SULEIMAN 
FRANJIEH MET ON MARCH 16 WITH MINISTERS BARRI 
AND JUMBLATT IN DAMASCUS.  AFTERWARD, THEY 
ISSUED A STATEMENT INCLUDING A VEILED THREAT: 
\"THE ACTION UNDERTAKEN IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF 
LEBANON BY A GROUP WITH SUSPECTED TIES TO 
ISRAEL AND SUPPORTED BY THE UNITED STATES 
THREATENS THE UNITY, PEACE, AND EXISTENCE OF LEBANON 
AND COULD LEAD TO RENEWED CIVIL WAR.\"  THIS IS 
ONLY THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MENACING STATEMENTS 
ISSUING FROM THE SYRIAN CAPITAL. 
 
3.  ON THE MILITARY FRONT, THE SITUATION DE- 
SCRIBED  IN REFTEL B CONTINUES.  THERE ARE 
NO INDICATIONS OF ANY INTENTION TO ENGAGE 
LF UNITS AT MADFOUN.  TO THE CONTRARY, L\'ORIENT- 
LE JOUR REPORTS PM KARAMI SAYING PRIVATELY THAT 
SYRIAN FORCES WOULD NOT INTERVENE WITHOUT AN 
OFFICIAL GOL REQUEST. 
 
4.  JA\' JA\' AND HIS DISSIDENTS ARE RESPONDING TO 
THIS SYRIAN INTIMIDATION.  THEY SHOW GREAT 
CONCERN AT SYRIAN TROOP MOVEMENTS (SEPTEL).  IN 
ADDITION, THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT (CDM) 
EMERGENCY COUNCIL STATED ON MARCH 16, FOR THE 
THIRD CONSECUTIVE DAY, ITS AVERSION TO THE USE 
OF FORCE AND ITS PREFERENCE FOR A POLITICAL 
ROLE.  IT ALSO DECLARED ITS WILLINGNESS TO OPEN 
CONTACTS WITH THE SYRIANS AND ALL OTHER CONCERNED 
PARTIES.  COMMAND COUNCIL MEMBER KARIM PAKRADOUNI 
HAS NOW HAD TWO CONVERSATIONS WITH SYRIAN FIRST 
VP KHADDAM IN WHICH HE DENIED ANY CDM TIES TO 
ISRAEL.  THE MOVEMENT SEEMS TO BE MAKING THE 
MAXIMUM EFFORT TO ALLEVIATE SYRIAN CONCERNS. 
 
5.  IN RESPONSE TO PM KARAMI\'S MARCH 15 BLAST AT 
THE DISSIDENTS (SEPTEL), THE JA\'JA\' FORCES 
HAVE PROPOSED THE FORMATION OF A CHRISTIAN NATIONAL 
COUNCIL TO SERVE AS A FORUM FOR UNIQUELY CHRISTIAN 
VOICES.  THIS IS AN IDEA  WHICH HAS BEEN DUSTED 
OFF AT INTERVALS SINCE 1981.  ONLY TIME WILL 
TELL IF IT IS ONCE AGAIN A NON-STARTER. 
 
6.  THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND REMAINS TENSE BUT 
QUIET.  TRAFFIC CONTINUES UNIMPEDED ALONG THE 
COASTAL HIGHWAY FROM BEIRUT AS FAR NORTH AS 
MADFOUN.  AT MADFOUN, HOWEVER, WHILE NORTH- 
BOUND TRAFFIC IS PERMITTED THROUGH, TRAFFIC 
FROM TRIPOLI SOUTH TOWARD BEIRUT IS HALTED AND 
TURNED BACK.

VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM HAS CANCELLED HIS 
MARCH 18 VISIT TO BEIRUT. THE WEEKLY WEDNESDAY 
MEETING OF THE LEBANESE CABINET HAS ALSO BEEN 
POSTPONED BECAUSE MINISTERS JUMBLATT AND BARRI 
WOULD NOT ATTEND.  JUMBLATT IS IN MOSCOW, 
WHILE BARRI CLAIMS THAT THE ROAD TO BAABDA IS 
UNSAFE.  THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE ROAD 
WILL NOT BE SAFE UNTIL THE CHRISTIAN DISSIDENTS 
ARE BROUGHT INTO LINE.  IN A SPEECH IN MUKHTARA 
SUNDAY TO COMMEMORATE THE EIGHTH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE ASSASSINATION OF KAMEL JUMBLATT, WALID 
JUMBLATT URGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO REASON FOR 
A POSSIBLE NEW ROUND OF FIGHTING.  HE THREATENED 
TO \"BREAK THE NECKS\" OF THE CHRISTIAN REBELS. 
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE SCHEDULED FOR LATE 
TODAY (3/18), BARRI IS EXPECTED TO STEP UP THE 
POLITICAL PRESSURE AGAINST JA\'JA\"S CHRISTIAN 
DECISION MOVEMENT (CDM). 
 
3.  IN THE FACE OF THIS CONTINUING PRESSURE, 
RECONCILIATION EFFORTS CONTINUE WITHIN THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  A TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE 
COMPOSED OF MINISTER OF PUBLIC HEALTH  JOSEPH 
AL-HASLEM, FORMER MINISTER AND PHALANGE POLITICAL 
ALLY MICHEL AL-MURR, AND CDM EMERGENCY COMMITTEE 
MEMBER KARIM PAKRADOUNI HAS BEEN MEETING TO 
DRAFT A POLITICAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FACTIONS. 
L\'ORIENT-LE JOUR REPORTS THAT THIS COMMITTEE 
HAS SUCCEEDED IN HAMMERING OUT THE OUTLINES OF 
AN AGREEMENT BASED ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
-  KEEPING CURRENT LEADERS IN PLACE 
 
-  RESTRUCTURING THE PHALANGE PARTY 
 
-  CLARIFYING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PHALANGE AND THE LF 
 
-  MAINTAINING THE AUTONOMY OF THE LF 
 
-  PUSHING FOR THE RAPID CREATION OF A CHRISTIAN 
NATIONAL COUNCIL 
 
DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED 
PENDING THE MARCH 18 MEETING OF THE PHALANGE 
PARTY POLITICAL BUREAU. 
 
4.  IN A MARCH 17 PRESS CONFERENCE HELD IN 
JOUNIEH, PAKRADOUNI TRIED TO PRESENT THE CDM 
IN A MANNER WHICH WOULD ALLAY SYRIAN CONCERNS. 
REFTEL PROVIDES THE TEXT OF THE CONFERENCE. 
FOLLOWING ARE THE MAJOR POINTS: 
 
A.  CDM\'S MAJOR PRINCIPLES ARE 1)  SUPPORT FOR 
THE UNITY OF LEBANON AND ITS FULL LIBERATION; 2) 
SUPPORT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW FORMULA 
FOR MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN RELATIONS;  AND 3) ACTION 
TO GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITY. 
 
B.  CDM\'S \"UPPERMOST OBJECTIVE\" IS THE SPEEDY 
ELECTION OF A NATIONAL CHRISTIAN COUNCIL TO 
SERVE AS A CHRISTIAN PARLIAMENT. 
 
C.  CDM HAS RECEIVED NO AID FROM ISRAEL.  HOWEVER, 
PAKRADOUNI QUALIFIED THIS DENIAL BY ADDING, 
\"THE COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP HAS NOT YET DECIDED 
ITS POLICY TOWARD ISRAEL.\" 
 
D.  CDM DOES NOT INTEND TO HARM THE PRESIDENT OR 
THE PRESIDENCY.  HE STATED, \"WE WANT THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC TO REMAIN ABOVE PARTY 
AND SECTARIAN DISPUTES.  WE WANT HIM TO BE THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC-OF ALL LEBANON- AND 
WE DO NOT WANT HIM TO BE MERELY THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE CHRISTIANS OR OF MILITIAS.\" 
 
E.  CDM IS A \"COUP\" WITHIN THE LF AND THE PHALANGE 
PARTY AIMED AT MAKING THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY 
MORE DEMOCRATIC. 
 
F.  CDM SEEKS DIRECT MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN NEGOTIATIONS, 
ESPECIALLY WITH MINISTERS BARRI AND JUMBLATT, 
AIMING TOWARD A \"PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE CHARTER.\" 
 
G.  CONTACTS WITH THE SYRIANS WILL CONTINUE. 
PAKRADOUNI WILL MAKE A THIRD CALL TO SYRIAN VP 
KHADDAM.  FURTHER, HE STATED THAT HIS \"COMMUNICATIONS 
WITH SYRIAN OFFICIALS PERMIT ME TO SAY THAT THERE 
WILL BE NO SYRIAN INCURSION INTO OUR AREAS.\" 
 
H.  CDM OPPOSES THE REMOVAL OF THE BARBARA 
CHECKPOINT. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT 
THE CDM ORIGINALLY CRITICIZED PRESIDENT GEMAYEL 
FOR DEALING WITH THE SYRIANS AND FOR MAKING 
CONCESSIONS AS PRESIDENT THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE 
MADE AS A STRICTLY CHRISTIAN LEADER.  NOW, 
FACED WITH THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF 
THEIR SITUATION, THE CDM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH 
DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THE SYRIANS AND ENCOURAGING 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL TO REMAIN ABOVE THE SECTARIAN 
FRAY.  END COMMENT. 
 
6.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION HAS ALSO SURFACED 
CONCERNING THE STATUS OF TITULAR LF COMMANDER 
FUAD ABU NADER.  IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 
PAKRADOUNI ASSERTED THAT, \"FUAD ABU NADER IS 
STILL THE COMMANDER OF THE LEBANESE FORCES. 
HE HAS SUPPORTED IN AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT THE 
POLICY OF THE UPRISING WITHIN THE LEBANESE 
FORCES.  A TEMPORARY COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP 
CALLED THE \'EMERGENCY COMMITTEE\' HAS BEEN 
FORMED.  WE WILL SOON ANNOUNCE A NEW LEADERSHIP 
FOR THIS COMMITTEE.\"  ABU NADER IS THUS STILL 
FUNCTIONING AS A LEADER OF THE LF, THOUGH THE 
DEGREE OF HIS PRESENT INFLUENCE AND HIS FUTURE 
PROSPECTS REMAIN UNCLEAR.

SUBJECT:  SOLVING THE CHRISTIAN CRISIS:  THE PHALANGE 
VIEW 
 
1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR CALLED ON MINISTER OF PTT 
JOSEPH HASHEM MARCH 18.  HASHEM IS A PHALANGE 
PARTY LEADER AND CLOSE ASSOCIATE OF PRESIDENT 
GEMAYEL.  HE IS ON THE COMMITTEE OF THREE (WITH 
KARIM PAKKRADOUNI REPRESENTING THE DISSIDENTS 
AND MICHEL MURR AS THE THIRD MAN WITH LINKS BETWEEN 
BOTH SIDES)  THAT HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH HAMMERING 
OUT A SOLUTION.  HASHEM SAID HE HAD JUST LEFT A 
PHALANGE POLITICAL BUREAU MEETING TO MEET WITH 
THE AMBASSADOR AND WOULD SHORTLY BE GOING INTO 
A MEETING OF THE THREE-MAN COMMITTEE TO FINISH 
A COMMUNIQUE WHICH WOULD \"REASSURE EVERYONE.\" 
THE CHIEF ELEMENT OF THE COMPROMISE APPEARS TO 
BE A RESTRUCTURING\" OF THE PHALANGE AND THE LF 
WHICH WOULD GIVE THE LF DISSIDENTS MORE OF A 
VOICE AND MORE INDEPENDENCE.  HASHEM SAID THAT 
THE  USG HAD CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY AND APPRECIATED WHAT 
THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN SAYING.  AMBASSADOR 
EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH PROGRESS ON THE 
POLITICAL SOLUTION BUT NOTED IT SHOULD NOT COME 
AT PRICE OF WEAKENING THE POSITION OF THE 
PRESIDENT, OR THE COHESION OF THE CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITY, AND THE COMMITTMENT TO REALISM AND 
FLEXIBILITY IN THE POLITICAL REFORM PROCESS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  HASHEM ARGUED THAT THERE WERE NO MAJOR POLITICAL 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE DISSIDENTS, WITNESS THEIR 
OWN CONTACTS WITH SYRIA (A REFERENCE TO 
PAKRADOUNI\'S DISCUSSIONS WITH KHADDAM OVER THE 
LAST FEW DAYS.)  HE SAID THE PHALANGE PARTY 
STRUCTURE HAD NOT BEEN REVAMPED FOR TEN YEARS 
AND IT WAS NORMAL TO THINK OF RESTRUCTURING IT 
NOW IN A WAY THAT WOULD GIVE THE DISSIDENTS 
MORE PARTICIPATION AND POSITION, POLITICAL, 
MILITARY, AND FINANCIAL.  THIS WAS THE FOCUSS 
OF THE CURRENT COMPROMISE EFFORT.  THERE WOULD 
PROBABLY ALSO BE A \"NATIONAL CHRISTIAN COUNCIL\" 
WHICH WOULD BE A BROADENED LEBANESE FRONT REPRESENTING 
ALL CHRISTIAN GROUPS.  IT WOULD BE ADVISORY AND 
NOT \"PARLIAMENTARY\" (AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT 
UNDERCUT THE PRESIDENT\'S AUTHORITY  OR SMACK 
OF AN INDEPENDENT CHRISTIAN \"CANTON\".)  HASHEM 
SAID THE CHIEF CONCERN WAS THAT THE LEBANESE 
FORCE MOVEMENT THREATENED TO UNDERCUT THE 
PRESIDENT, TRIGGER ADVERSE REACTIONS FROM THE 
LEBANESE MOSLEMS AND FROM SYRIA,  AND UNDERMINE 
THE EFFORTS AT REACHING POLITICAL ACCOMODATION.  HE 
KNEW THE USG SHARED THESE CONCERNS AND THE AMBASSADOR 
WAS MAKING THIS CLEAR TO \"ALL SIDES.\" 
 
4.  HASHEM SAID HE THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS 
HAD BEEN MADE IN THE THREE-MAN COMMITTEE.  HE HAD 
BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUE JUST NOW IN THE SESSION 
OF THE PHALANGE POLITICAL BUREAU WHICH HE HAD LEFT 
TO MEET WITH THE AMBASSADOR.  HE WOULD BE 
MEETING WITH MURR AND PAKRADOUNI UPON LEAVING THE 
MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR AND THOUGHT 
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REACH A COMMUNIQUE WHICH 
WOULD \"REASSURE EVERYONE.\" 
 
5.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT SINCE HASHEM WAS SO 
WELL AWARE OF THE USG VIEWS ON THE SITUATION 
HE WOULD NOT REPEAT  THEM IN DETAIL.  HE HOPED 
THAT HASHEM WAS RIGHT THAT THE LF DISSIDENTS DID 
NOT DIFFER GREATLY FROM THE MAIN POLITICAL 
LINES THE PRESIDENT AND THE CHRISTIAN 
COMMUNITY WERE ON.  THAT SAID, MUCH OF WHAT 
THEY SAID IN THE PAST, AND INDEED NOW, RAISED 
QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER THEY WOULD SHOW THE 
REALISM AND FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED TO PROTECT THE 
NATION\'S  DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS STARTING WITH 
THE CHRISTIAN PRESIDENCY, WORK POLITICAL REFORMS 
WITH THE MOSLEMS, PRESERVE THE WELL-BEING 
OF THE CHRISTIANS, AND CONTAIN SYRIAN INFLUENCE. 
IF THE COMPROMISES BEING WORKED ON IN THE 
THREE-MAN COMMITTEE BEGAN A PROCESS WHICH 
WOULD UNDERCUT THESE OBJECTIVES, THEN IT WOULD MEAN 
A PYRRHIC VICTORY FOR THE CHRISTIANS AND FOR 
LEBANON. 
 
6.  HASHEM SAID THAT HE FELT THINGS WERE ON TRACT 
TOWARD A SOLUTION WHICH WOULD ASSURE EVERYONE 
(INCLUDING THE MOSLEMS AND SYRIA) THAT LEBANON\'S 
\"POLITICAL SYSTEM AND POLITICAL LINE\" WILL BE 
MAINTAINED.  HE SAID HE WAS NEVERTHELESS CONCERNED 
THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS AMONG THE LF DISSIDENTS 
ESPECIALLY IDENTIFIED WITH ISRAEL COULD OBSTRUCT 
THE PROCESS.  HE THOUGHT THE USG COULD HELP HEAD 
THIS OFF BY GETTING THE RIGHT WORD TO THESE IN- 
DIVIDUALS AND TO THE ISRAELIS.  THE AMBASSADOR 
REPLIED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE 
ISRAELIS WERE NOT A MAJOR FACTOR IN EITHER THE 
GENESIS OR THE DIRECTION OF THE LF DISSIDENT 
MOVEMENT.  DAVID KINCHE HAD YESTERDAY MADE 
THIS PUBLIC AND UNDERSCORED THE LIMITS OF THE 
ISRAELI    INTEREST AND ROLE IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING 
INSIDE THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  IN FACT, THE 
ISRAELIS HAVE NO INTEREST IN SIGNIFICANTLY 
\"RE-ENGAGING\" IN LEBANON BY PLAYING A MAJOR ROLE 
IN THIS FRACAS -- OR ITS CONSEQUENCES. 
THE ISRAELIS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT OF LEBANON, 
AND NOT ON THEIR WAY BACK IN (HASHEM NODDED 
AGREEMENT TO THIS LAST STATEMENT.) 
 
7.  HASHEM CLOSED CONVERSATION BY REFERRING TO 
AMBASSADOR\'S UPCOMING MEETING WITH KARIM 
PAKRADOUNI (ANNOUNCED OVER THE LF CONTROLLED 
VOL.)  HE REITERATED THAT THE U.S. HAS CONSIDERABLE 
INFLUENCE IN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  HE, THEREFORE, 
THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT THE AMBASSADOR MAKE 
CLEAR IN ANY CONTACTS WITH THE DISSIDENTS THAT THEY 
SHOULD NOT UNDERMINE LEBANON\'S \"POLITICAL 
SYSTEM AND POLITICAL LINE\", AND THAT THEY WILL 
HAVE NO SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE, FROM EITHER THE 
U.S. OR OTHERS IF THEY DO.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID 
HE HAD MADE THE USG VIEW CLEAR IN ALL HIS 
CONTACTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 
 
8.  COMMENTS:  HASHEM WAS OBVIOUSLY TIRED FROM 
THE UNENDING SERIES OF LATE-NIGHT MEETINGS THAT 
HE AND ALL OTHER ACTORS IN THE MELEE HAVE BEEN 
LIVING THROUGH.  HE DID NOT APPEAR SPECIFICALLY 
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE POLITICAL COMPROMISE THAT 
IS SHAPING UP, AND CERTAINLY DID NOT CONVEY THE 
IMAGE OF A MAN READY TO CLAIM SUCCESS IN PUTTING THE 
GENI BACK IN THE BOTTLE.  IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
TO SEE WHAT PAKRADOUNI HAS TO SAY IN HIS 
MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR LATER TODAY.  END 
COMMENT.

2.  PHALANGE POLITBURO MEMBER ALFRED MAHDI, WHO REMAINS 
PERSONALLY CLOSE TU JA\'JA\', 29 MARCH PROVIDED CHARGE 
WHAT WE SENSE IS ACCURATE WRAP-UP OF CURRENT STATE OF 
PLAY BETWEEN JA\'JA\' FORCES AND PHALANGE. 
 
3.  MAHDI SAID CURRENT INTERMINABLE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT 
REORGANIZED PHALANGE PARTY, ENLARGED LEBANESE FRONT, AND 
NEW CHRISTIAN COUNCIL REPRESENT DESIRE OF BOTH CHRISTIAN 
DECISION MOVEMENT (CDM) AND PHALANGE TO STRING OUT 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
4.  PHALANGE SEES TIME AS BEING ON ITS SIDE AS IT ATTEMPT 
TO EXPLOIT DISAFFECTION AND SPLITS IN CDM RESULTING FROM 
GROWING AWARENESS OF LACK OF SPECIFIC REALISTIC POLICIES 
AND OF DANGERS CDM HAS CREATED OF SYRIAN INTERVENTION 
AND WEAKENED CHRISTIAN UNIT. 
 
5.  CDM SEES TIME ON ITS SIDE AS IT ATTEMPTS TO SEDUCE 
REMAINING GEMAYEL BACKERS AMONG LF IN METN, TO REASSURE 
SYRIANS WHILE OPENING UP DIRECT CONTACT WITH THEM 
(NUMEROUS SOURCES REPORT HOBEIKA HAS REGULAR CONTACT 
WITH RIFFAT), AND TO STRENGTHEN ITS APPEAL AT GRASSROOTS

6.  MAHDI BELIEVES THAT TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THIS

HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS NOT SEEN GEMAYEL SINCE 
MARCH 14, HE BELIEVES GEMAYEL SHARES HIS VIEW THAT TWO 
SIDES MUST SERIOUSLY PURSUE RESOLUTION OF THEIR 
DIFFERENCES.  IF NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE TO DRAG ON 
UNCONCLUSIVELY, MAHDI SAID, ALL DANGERS PREDICTED BY 
BOTH SIDES WILL COME TRUE -- SYRIAN INTERVENTION, 
WEAKENED AND DIVIDED CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, SHARP MUSLIM 
REACTION, ETC.  IN ADDITION, MAHDI SAID INCREASINGLY 
DANGEROUS SITUATION IN SOUTH, CUTTING OFF OF NORTH, AND 
DEGRADATION OF SECURITY IN WEST BEIRUT, CREATES BACKDROP

REF:  BEIRUT 1961 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  HEAVY FIGHTING 
IN THE SIDON AREA CONTINUED ON MARCH 30-31 CAUSING 
NUMEROUS CASUALTIES.  ACCORDING TO MOST REPORTS 
REACHING BEIRUT, THE FIGHTING, WHICH FOLLOWS 
RECENT LF-LAF CLASHES IN THE AREA (REFTEL), 
INCLUDED THE STRONG, DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF ARMED 
PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
 
2.  (U) WIDELY PORTRAYED HERE AS PART OF AN 
ISRAELI PLAN TO REDISTRIBUTE THE POPULATION OF 
SOUTH LEBANON AND TO FORM A PREDOMINANTLY 
CHRISTIAN BORDER SECURITY STRIP, THE CLASHES IN 
SIDON HAVE PREOCCUPIED LEBANESE GOVERNMENTAL, 
POLITICAL, AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS OVER THE 
WEEKEND.  PRIME MINISTER KARAMI CALLED INDIRECTLY 
ON THE U.S. TO USE ITS INFLUENCE TO HALT THE 
ALLEGED ISRAELI PLAN.  SYRIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF GENERAL KHOLI IS EXPECTED IN 
BEIRUT TODAY, APRIL 1, TO DISCUSS RECENT POLITICAL 
AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS WITH PRESIDENT GEMAYEL. 
END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
2.  (U) FIGHTING INTENSIFIED IN THE SIDON AREA ON 
MARCH 30-31 BETWEEN LF MILITIAMEN AND LAF UNITS. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HOWEVER, THE LAF\'S 
ROLE WAS ECLIPSED WHEN PALESTINIAN UNITS BASED IN 
THE REFUGEE CAMPS TOOK A STRONG, ACTIVE ROLE IN 
THE FIGHTING AGAINST THE LF. 
 
3.  U) ON MARCH 30, THE LF REPORTEDLY BEGAN 
HEAVY, ALMOST CONTINUOUS SHELLING OF THE REFUGEE 
CAMPS AT AYN AL-HILWAH AND MIYAH MIYAH AND OF 
OTHER RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN SIDON.  PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIAN FORCES, BACKED BY OTHER MUSLIM 
MILITIAS, RESPONDED AND HEAVY FIGHTING ENSUED. 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, CLASHES BETWEEN THE LF AND LAF 
WERE REPORTED ALONG A LINE INCLUDING KANAYA, 
KAHAYA, HLALIYAH, AND BRAMIYAH.  THERE ARE ALSO 
REPORTS OF AMAL UNITS TAKING PART IN THE FIGHTING 
IN SIDON, BUT WE HAVE NO DETAILED INFORMATION. 
THE MARCH 30 CASUALTY TOLL AMOUNTED TO 
TWENTY-EIGHT KILLED AND FORTY WOUNDED, MOSTLY 
CIVILIANS. 
 
4. (U) ON MARCH 31, THE FIGHTING CONTINUED, WITH 
THE MOST INTENSIVE ACTION CENTERED AROUND THE AYN 
AL-HILWAH REFUGEE CAMP.  ACCORDING TO FOREIGN 
CORRESPONDENTS CITED IN THE LOCAL PRESS, THE CAMP 
CAME UNDER HEAVY SHELLING FROM LF ARTILLERY 
POSITIONS NEAR JEZZIN.  HEAVY FIGHTING WAS ALSO 
REPORTED BETWEEN LF UNITS AND LAF POSITONS ON MAR 
ELIAS HILL. THE MARCH 31 CASUALTY TOLL AMOUNTED TO 
FIVE KILLED AND FIFTEEN WOUNDED.  THERE ARE 
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS 
FLEEING THE CAMPS FOR SIDON ITSELF AND OF SUNNI 
AND CHRISTIAN RESIDENTS OF SIDON MOVING NORTHWARD 
TO BEIRUT. 
 
5.  (U) ELSEWHERE IN THE SOUTH, ISRAELI UNITS 
REPORTEDLY CROSSED BACK INTO PREVIOUSLY EVACUATED 
TERRITORY FOR THE SIXTH TIME AS PART OF A DRAGNET 
OPERATION IN THE IQLIM AL-TIFFAH REGION SOUTH OF 
SIDON.  LENGTHY LOCAL PRESS REPORTS INDICATE 
TWENTY-THREE PERSONS KILLED AND FORTY-FIVE PERSONS 
WOUNDED, MOSTLY IN THE VILLAGE OF JBAA. 
 
6.  (LOU) IN THE ONLY OTHER SIGNIFICANT FIGHTING 
OVER THE WEEKEND, LAF UNITS EXCHANGED ARTILLERY 
FIRE WITH PSP MILITIAMEN ON MARCH 30 ALONG THE SUQ 
AL-GHARB/AYTAT RIDGELINE FRONT SOUTHEAST OF 
BEIRUT.  TWO LAF SOLDIERS WERE REPORTEDLY KILLED. 
WHEN THE SHELLING SPILLED OVER ONTO THE 
EAST-BEIRUT RESIDENTIAL AREAS OF BAABDA, 
HAZIMIYAH, AND MKALLAS, SEVERAL SHELLS HIT JUST 
OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER OF THE AMBASSADOR\'S 
RESIDENCE AT YARZE.  EMBASSY PERSONNEL HAD ALREADY 
TAKEN REFUGE IN THE SHELTER. 
 
7.  (U) EFFORTS TO HALT THE DETERIORATION OF THE 
SITUATION IN SOUTH LEBANON PREOCCUPIED LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENTAL, POLITICAL, AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.  ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS, FOLLOWING A MEETING ON MARCH 30, 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL, PRIME MINISTER KARAMI, AND 
SENIOR LAF OFFICERS DECIDED TO REINFORCE LEBANESE 
ARMY UNITS IN THE SOUTH, IN PART WITH EQUIPMENT 
NOW BEING DELIVERED FROM THE U.S.  MINISTERS HOSS 
AND BARRI, WHO TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS MARCH 31 TO 
MEET WITH SARG VICE PRESIDENT KHADDAM AND DRUZE 
LEADER JUMBLATT, HAVE DEMANDED SUCH A 
REINFORCEMENT OF LAF UNITS IN THE SOUTH FOR 
SEVERAL WEEKS. 
 
8.  (U) FOLLOWING THE MARCH 30 MEETING, PRIME 
MINISTER KARAMI ACCUSED ISRAEL OF PROVOKING THE 
VIOLENCE IN SIDON \"IN THE HOPE OF OBTAINING A NEW 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION (ON A CONFESSIONAL 
BASIS) AND EVENTUALLY ESTABLISHING A BUFFER ZONE 
(ALONG THE BORDER STRIP).\"  STATING THAT THE 
SITUATION IN THE SOUTH MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE 
REGIONAL CONTEXT, KARAMI SAID THAT THE GOL WOULD 
UNDERTAKE CONTACTS WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHICH 
HAVE INFLUENCE IN THE REGION. 
 
9.  (U) NOTING THAT \"THE UNITED STATES IN 
PARTICULAR CAN ACT TO CLEAN UP THE SITUATION,\" 
KARAMI ADDED THAT THE GOL HAD NOT/NOT BEEN 
INFORMED OF A VISIT TO LEBANON BY ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY MURPHY DURING THE LATTER\'S FORTHCOMING 
TRIP TO THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
10. (U)  SHIITE AMAL LEADER NABIH BARRI DENOUNCED 
THE INTENSIFICATION OF FIGHTING IN SIDON IN 
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WORDS AS KARAMI.  \"ISRAEL,\" 
HE SAID, \"AIMS AT PROVOKING A NEW DEMOGRAPHIC 
REDISTRIBUTION AND TO RESHAPE ITS FRONTIER WITH 
LEBANON SO THAT THE CHRISTIANS IN SIDON AND JEZZIN 
ARE MOVED TO THE BORDER ZONE AND THAT THE MUSLIMS, 
MORE PRECISELY THE SHIITES, ARE FORCED BACK INTO 
THE INTERIOR OF LEBANON.\"  \"IT IS IN THIS 
CONTEXT,\" BARRI ADDED, \"THAT ONE CAN UNDERSTAND 
THE RECENT EVENTS IN SIDON AND ORDERS WHICH WERE 
GIVEN TO THE \'INTIFADA\' (I.E., JA\'JA\'S CHRISTIAN 
DECISION MOVEMENT)...\" 
 
11. (U) IN A MARCH 31 TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH 
SARG PRESIDENT ASSAD, PRESIDENT GEMAYEL AGREED TO 
RECEIVE A SYRIAN ENVOY TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN 
SIDON AS WELL AS RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 
WITHIN THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  SYRIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF GENERAL KHOLI IS EXPECTED TO 
MEET WITH GEMAYEL TODAY, APRIL 1. 
 
12. (C) COMMENT.  THE CONTRADICTORY AND 
TENDENTIOUS REPORTS REACHING BEIRUT ABOUT THE 
FIGHTING IN SIDON ARE DIFFICULT TO UNRAVEL AND 
EVALUATE.  PALESTINIAN UNITS DO APPEAR TO BE 
TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN THE CLASHES.  IN SHORT, 
THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH APPEARS TO BE 
DETERIORATING, AS EVERYONE HAD FEARED, INTO A 
HEIGHTENED LEBANESE/ISRAELI CONFLICT AND BITTER 
INTERCOMMUNAL CLASHES WITH PALESTINIAN 
INVOLVEMENT.

MIYAH MIYAH CAMPS IN SIDON TO UNWRA CAMPS 
ELSEWHERE IN LEBANON.   OF A TOTAL OF 215 FAMILIES 
FLEEING SIDON, 187 HAVE COME TO CAMPS IN THE 
BEIRUT AREA, OF WHICH 76 TO SHATILA, 108 TO BURJ 
BRAJNAH, AND THREE TO MAR ELIAS.  THE TWENTY-EIGHT 
OTHER REFUGEE FAMILIES MOVED TO CAMPS AROUND 
TRIPOLI.  IN ADDITION, AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF 
REFUGEES HAVE RESETTLED IN THE RAWCHAH AND AYN 
MURAYSA NEIGHBORHOODS OF WEST BEIRUT.  THE UNWRA 
SOURCE PLACED THE NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN CASUALTIES 
IN SIDON SINCE MARCH 29 AT THIRTY-ONE KILLED AND 
ABOUT 100 INJURED.

KHOLI VISIT; MILITARY SUPPLIES FOR SOUTH 
---------------------------------------- 
6.  (U) ON APRIL 1, SARG PRESIDENT ASSAD 
DISPATCHED SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE CHIEF 
MAJOR GENERAL MUHAMMAD KHOLI TO BEIRUT TO MEET 
WITH PRESIDENT GEMAYEL AND OTHER SENIOR GOL 
OFFICIALS.  PRESS REPORTS INDICATE THAT IN A 
LETTER CARRIED BY KHOLI, ASSAD LINKED THE 
DETERIORATING SITUATION AROUND SIDON WITH 
\"PARTITIONIST PROJECTS\" ALLEGEDLY UNDERTAKEN BY LF 
LEADER JA\'JA\' WITH ISRAELI BACKING.  ACCORDING TO 
THESE REPORTS, ASSAD AGREED TO PROVIDE LEBANON 
WITH UNSPECIFIED ARMS AND OTHER MILITARY SUPPLIES 
FOR USE AROUND SIDON. 
 
7.  (U) LATER ON APRIL 1, GENERAL MICHEL AOUN MADE 
A HASTY TRIP TO DAMASCUS, HIS FIRST SINCE BECOMING 
LAF COMMANDER IN CHIEF IN JULY 1984.  HE MET THERE 
WITH SYRIAN ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF HIKMAT SHIHABI AND 
DEFENSE MINISTER TLASS, REPORTEDLY TO WORK OUT THE 
DETAILS OF THE SYRIAN ARMS SUPPLIES. 
 
8.  (C) ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS CONFIRMED BY 
OMC, THE LAF PLANS TO REINFORCE ITS PRESENCE IN 
SIDON WITH TWENTY-EIGHT OF THE THIRTY RECENTLY 
DELIVERED, U.S.-ORIGIN M113 ARMORED PERSONNEL 
CARRIERS.  THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE 
LAF WILL ALSO SEND TO SIDON A BATALLION OF THE 1ST 
BRIGADE PRESENTLY STATIONED IN THE BIQA\'. 
 
---------------- 
MUSLIM REACTIONS 
---------------- 
9. (U) MUSLIM RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL LEADERS HAVE 
ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY ACCUSED THE CHRISTIAN LF 
MILITIA OF PROVOKING THE FIGHTING IN SIDON AT 
ISRAEL\'S INSTIGATION AS PART OF AN ALLEGED SCHEME 
TO PARTITION LEBANON INTO SECTARIAN MINI-STATES. 
 
10. (U) ON APRIL 1, SUNNI RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS INCLUDING EDUCATION MINISTER SALIM AL-HUSS 
MET AT DAR AL-FATWA, THE SEAT OF THE SUNNI MUFTI 
OF THE REPUBLIC, TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION IN 
SIDON.  THEY ISSUED A STATEMENT WHICH (A) URGED 
THE GOL TO HONOR ITS POLITICAL COMMITMENT TO 
REINFORCE, WITH ADDITIONAL MEN AND EQUIPMENT, LAF 
UNITS IN SIDON AND ELSEWHERE IN THE SOUTH; (B) 
REQUESTED THE GOL TO MOBILIZE ALL FORCES TO HALT 
THE MASSACRES IN SIDON, ITS EASTERN SUBURBS, AND 
THE REFUGEE CAMPS; (C) WARNED AGAINST THE SPREAD 
OF VIOLENCE TO THE IQLIM AL-KHARRUB, THE WESTERN 
BIQA\', AND RASHAYA, AND TO THE COUNTRY AT LARGE; 
AND (D) URGED ALL LEBANESE POLITICAL AND FACTIONAL 
LEADERS TO \"ADOPT A RESPONSIBLE HISTORIC STAND 
THAT WILL CHECK THE GROUP INVOLVED IN THE ISRAELI 
CONSPIRATORIAL AND PARTITIONIST DESIGN.\" 
 
10. (U) SHIITE AMAL LEADER NABIH BARRI REJECTED 
RECENT PROPOSALS FOR A NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE 
SOUTH, STATING THAT SUCH A CONFERENCE WOULD ONLY 
\"COVER THE (GOL\'S) FAILURES AND INACTION.\"  BARRI 
CLAIMED THAT THE LF-LAF CLASHES WOULD NEVER HAVE 
OCCURRED IF THE (PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM) LAF UNITS 
IN THE SOUTH HAD BEEN REINFORCED AS AGREED. 
 
------------------ 
CHRISTIAN REACTION 
------------------ 
11. (U) FOLLOWING THE APRIL 1 MEETING OF THE 
LEBANESE FORCES \"EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,\" KARIM 
PAKRADUNI ACCUSED ISRAEL OF INCITING VIOLENCE 
AMONG LOCAL MILITIAS IN SIDON IN ORDER TO DIVERT 
THEIR ENERGIES AND THEREBY ENSURE ITS OWN 
SECURITY.  AT THE SAME TIME, HE ACCUSED THE 
PALESTINIANS OF PROVOKING COMMUNAL DISCORD IN 
SIDON IN ORDER TO REESTABLISH THEIR HEGEMONY IN 
SOUTH LEBANON. THE SOUTH, HE SAID, IS THE LAST 
PART OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PALESTINIANS CAN ACT 
FOLLOWING THEIR LOSSES IN BEIRUT AND TRIPOLI. 
 
12.  (U) PAKRADUNI STATED THAT THE LF HAD PROPOSED 
A PLAN TO CREATE A WIDE NO MAN\'S LAND BETWEEN THE 
COMPETING FORCES IN SIDON, THEREBY ENDING 
HOSTILITIES, PREVENTING THE INVASION OR 
INFILTRATION OF ANY GROUP, AND AVOIDING THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NARROW DEMARCATION LINE SIMILAR 
TO THE \"GREEN-LINE\" BETWEEN EAST AND WEST BEIRUT. 
TO BUTTRESS THIS MILITARY PLAN POLITICALLY, 
PAKRADUNI CALLED FOR A MEETING OF SIDON\'S 
POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND ALL THE 
PROTAGONISTS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN THE CONFLICT. 
 
13. (U) MEANWHILE, FORMER PRESIDENT CAMILLE 
CHAMOUN STATED THAT ONLY THE LAF CAN ENSURE THE 
SECURITY OF SIDON, SINCE IT IS \"THE ONLY FORCE 
WHICH ENJOYS THE CONFIDENCE OF ALL THE INHABITANTS 
OF THE REGION.\"

2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  FOLLOWING MAJOR 
FIGHTING ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 16-17, A TENSE CALM 
NOW PREVAILS IN WEST BEIRUT.  SHIITE AMAL MOVEMENT 
LEADER NABIH BARRI EMERGED AS THE PRIME VICTOR IN 
THE INTRAMUSLIM FIGHTING.  STATEMENTS MADE BY THE 
VARIOUS LEADERS TRACK WITH OUR ANALYSIS (REFTEL A) 
THAT THE FIGHTING REFLECTED TWO MAJOR CONFLICTS: 
LEBANESE SHIA VS. LEBANESE SUNNI AND LEBANESE SHIA 
VS. PALESTINIANS.  THE AMAL MOVEMENT, WITH THE 
SUPPORT OF THE DRUZE PSP AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
\"NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC FRONT,\" HAS DEALT A SEVERE 
BLOW TO THE SUNNI MURABITUN MILITIA AND HAS COME 
OUT OF THE AFFAIR WITH ITS POSITION AS THE 
STRONGEST POLITICAL AND MILITARY FORCE IN WEST 
BEIRUT CONFIRMED AND ENHANCED. 
 
3.  THE SYRIAN ROLE REMAINS UNCLEAR, BUT MANY HERE 
SPECULATE THAT DAMASCUS MUST HAVE CONDONED THE 
AMAL/PSP MOVE AGAINST THE MURABITUN AND ITS 
PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIAN ALLIES AND MAY HAVE, IN 
FACT, ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE CLASH. 
 
4.  IN HIS RESIGNATION STATEMENT, PRIME MINISTER 
RASHID KARAMI EXPRESSED DESPAIR OVER THE APRIL 
16-17 FIGHTING, POINTED AN ACCUSING FIGURE AT 
DAMASCUS, AND ASKED FOR SYRIA TO HELP RESOLVE THE 
ENSUING CRISIS.  IT IS TOO SOON TO MAKE ANY FIRM 
PREDICTIONS AS TO WHO THE NEXT PRIME MINISTER MAY 
BE OR WHAT FORM THE NEW CABINET MAY TAKE, BUT WE 
SET FORTH BELOW SOME OF THE RELEVANT FACTORS.  END 
SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
------------------------------- 
AMAL, BACKED BY PSP, VICTORIOUS 
------------------------------- 
5.  THE DUST IS NOW SETTLING IN WEST BEIRUT AFTER 
VERY HEAVY FIGHTING OCCURRED ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 
16-17, RESULTING IN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERSONS 
KILLED AND ONE HUNDRED WOUNDED.  BEIRUT AIRPORT 
REMAINS OPERATIONAL, AND THE GREEN LINE IS 
PARTIALLY OPEN, BUT SPORADIC SNIPING CONTINUES IN 
VARIOUS AREAS OF WEST BEIRUT. 
 
6.  IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, STATEMENTS BY KEY 
LEADERS CONFIRMED OUR EARLIER ANALYSIS THAT THE 
EVENTS OF APRIL 16-17 REFLECTED A SHIA-SUNNI 
CONFLICT.  THE SHIITE AMAL MILITIA, BACKED BY THE 
DRUZE PSP, HIT HARD AT THE SUNNI MURABITUN MILITIA, 
REPORTEDLY TAKING CONTROL OF ALL SIGNIFICANT 
MURABITUN POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE \"VOICE OF ARAB 
LEBANON\" RADIO STATION LOCATED IN THE ABDUL NASR 
MOSQUE. 
 
7.  THE REACTION OF SUNNI LEADERS HAS BEEN STRONG. 
PRIME MINISTER KARAMI RESIGNED (SEE BELOW), AND THE 
GRAND MUFTI OF THE REPUBLIC, SHEIKH HASSAN KHALID, 
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE SHIA FOR STRIKING AGAINST 
TRADITIONALLY SUNNI WEST BEIRUT.  \"IT IS 
INADMISSIBLE FOR BEIRUT TO BE STRUCK AND HUMILIATED 
AND ITS AUTHORITY SEIZED BY THOSE VERY PEOPLE THAT 
IT PROTECTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROTECT...BY 
THOSE THAT IT WELCOMED AND HONORED AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO WELCOME AND HONOR.\"  THE MUFTI ADDED 
THAT THE SUNNIS WOULD NOT PERMIT THE INHABITANTS OF 
WEST BEIRUT TO BE \"STRUCK AS IF THEY HAD BECOME 
ISRAELI AGENTS.\"  EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH PRIME 
MINISTER KARAMI, FORMER PM TAKIADDIN SOLH STRONGLY 
REGRETTED THE FIGHTING WHICH \"OPPOSED PARTIES 
STRUGGLING FOR A COMMON CAUSE...WHO SHOULD DIRECT 
THEIR WEAPONS EXCLUSIVELY AGAINST THE ISRAELI 
ENEMY.\" 
 
8.  AMAL LEADER NABIH BARRI RESPONDED VEHEMENTLY TO 
THE MUFTI\'S NOTION THAT THE SHIA WERE GUESTS IN 
TRADITIONALLY SUNNI WEST BEIRUT.  \"BEIRUT IS MY 
CITY AND MY CAPTIAL,\" HE SAID, \"WE WILL NOT ACCEPT 
CANTONS THAT DEFINE US AS FOREIGNERS WHEN WE ARE 
PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE.\"  SUPPORTING BARRI\'S 
STATEMENT, THE DRUZE PSP SAID IT \"COULD NOT 
UNDERSTAND...HOW HE (THE MUFTI) COULD QUALIFY 
CERTAIN RESIDENTS OF WEST BEIRUT (I.E., THE SHIA) 
AS INTRUDERS. ...THOSE WHO DEFEND WITH THEIR BLOOD 
THE CAPITAL AGAINST FASCIST-PHALANGE AGRESSION, 
THOSE WHO STRUGGLE SO THAT BEIRUT WILL REMAIN ARAB 
AND FREE CANNOT BE CALLED INTRUDERS.\" 
 
9.  IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, THE APRIL 16-17 
FIGHTING WAS A SHIA-PALESTINIAN SET-TO.  THE SHIA, 
BACKED BY THE DRUZE, STRUCK HARD NOT ONLY AT THE 
SUNNI MURABITUN BUT ALSO AT THE PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIANS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
MURABITUN.  THEIR SUCCESS IN DOING SO, HOWEVER, WAS 
LESS OVERWHELMING, IN PART BECAUSE THE PALESTINIANS 
APPARENTLY DID NOT \"RISE TO THE BAIT\" AND 
PARTICIPATE IN THE FIGHTING WITH ALL THEIR FORCE. 
SINCE THE FIGHTING, AMAL AND PSP HAVE REPORTEDLY 
ESTABLISHED CHECKPOINTS AROUND THE PALESTINIAN 
REFUGEE CAMPS, TIGHTENING CONTROL OVER THE INFLUX 
OF ARMS. 
 
10.  IN A MAJOR PUBLIC STATEMENT, AMAL HIT HARD AT 
THE PALESTINIANS.  BARRI CALLED THE FIGHTING A 
\"NIGHTMARE\" IN WHICH HIS AMAL MILITIA CONFRONTED 
\"AN UPRISING CAREFULLY PLANNED BY ARAB HANDS 
EXPLOITING SECTARIAN IDEAS, FOREIGNERS, INTRUDERS, 
AND GUESTS IN BEIRUT.\"  BARRI ASKED RHETORICALLY 
\"WHY SOME OUTSIDERS (I.E., THE PALESTINIANS) ARE 
CONSIDERED AS GUESTS, EVEN IF THEY COME FROM 
ANOTHER REGION AND ANOTHER CONFESSION, WHILE THE 
REAL GUESTS IN BEIRUT (I.E., THE SHIA), WHO HAD THE 
HONOR OF LIBERATING THE CITY FROM THE CHAINS OF MAY 
17 AND THE AGENTS OF ISRAEL, ARE NOT WELL LOOKED 
UPON...\" 
 
11.  ON THE GROUND, THE VICTORS HAVE MOVED TO 
CONSOLIDATE THEIR GAINS.  LEADERS OF AMAL, PSP, AND 
THE SMALLER MEMBERS OF THE LEFTIST \"NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT\" (SYRIAN SOCIALIST NATIONAL PARTY, 
LEBANESE COMMUNIST PARTY, SYRIAN ARAB BAATH PARTY) 
MET AT BARRI\'S WEST BEIRUT RESIDENCE ON APRIL 17 
AND ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF A UNIFIED MILITARY 
COMMAND TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ORDER IN WEST 
BEIRUT (A THROW-BACK TO AN IDEA FIRST FIELDED AFTER 
THE FEBRUARY 6, 1984, FIGHTING AND DROPPED AFTER 
STIFF SUNNI RESISTANCE).  THIS GROUP PLANS TO SET 
UP AN OPERATIONS ROOM AND A BUREAU OF CITIZENS 
AFFAIRS.  IT SAYS IT WILL ALSO COMMAND A JOINT 
\"STRIKE FORCE\" INITIALLY COMPRISING 300 MEN, TO BE 
DOUBLED TO 600, DRAWN IN EQUAL NUMBERS FROM AMAL, 
THE PSP, AND THE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF THE NDF. 
ACCORDING TO THE BEIRUT DAILY, \"LE REVEIL,\" WEST 
BEIRUT NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BEEN PARCELED OUT AMONG 
THESE GROUPS.  AMAL IS REPORTEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR 
SECURITY IN TARIQ AL-JADIDAH, FAKAHANI, MAZRAH, AND 
KARAKAS; THE PSP IN RAS BEIRUT, HAMRA, AYN 
AL-MURAYSA, MINAT AL-HISN, MUSAYTIBAH, AND RAWSHAH; 
AND THE VARIOUS SMALLER GROUPS UNDER THE EGIS OF 
THE PSP IN SMALL, TOKEN  SECTIONS OF TERRITORY. 
 
12.  NOTABLY ABSENT FROM REPRESENTATION ON THE 
UNIFIED MILITARY COMMAND OR IN THE DIVISION OF 
SPOILS IS ANY SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP.  LACK OF GOL OR 
LAF PARTICIPATION GOES WITHOUT SAYING.  MORE THAN 
EVER BEFORE, NABIH BARRI HAS ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS 
THE STRONGMAN OF WEST BEIRUT.  THROUGH THE 
FORMATION OF THE UNIFIED MILITARY COMMAND AND THE 
ANNOUNCED FORMATION OF A \"POLITICAL HIGH COMMAND,\" 
THE SHIITE AMAL MOVEMENT WITH ITS ALLIES IS 
CONSOLIDATING AND FORMALIZING ITS CONTROL OF WEST 
BEIRUT.  THIS WILL BE A BITTER PILL FOR THE SUNNI 
COMMUNITY TO SWALLOW. 
 
----------- 
SYRIAN ROLE 
----------- 
13.  THERE AS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION AND LITTLE 
CONCRETE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE ROLE THAT SYRIA 
MAY HAVE PLAYED IN THE APRIL 16-17 FIGHTING.  AS WE 
ANTICIPATED (REFTEL A), THE FACT THAT NABIH BARRI 
HAD JUST RETURNED FROM DAMACUS BEFORE THE FIGHTING 
HAS FUELED SPECULATION THAT SYRIA CONDONED AND 
PERHAPS ACTIVELY SUPPORTED THE MOVE AGAINST THE 
MURABITUN AND, ESPECIALLY, AGAINST THE PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIANS.  ACCORDING TO THIS LINE OF REASONING, 
SYRIA MAY NEXT UNLEASH AMAL AND THE PSP AGAINST THE 
PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS IN THE BEIRUT SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS AND IN SIDON.  IN ANY EVENT, SYRIA IS 
CERTAINLY WATCHING DEVELOPMENTS HERE CLOSELY AND IS 
APPARENTLY NOT UNHAPPY WITH THE COURSE THEY HAVE 
TAKEN SO FAR. 
 
14.  IN HIS RESIGNATION STATEMENT (REFTEL B.), 
PRIME MINISTER KARAMI EXPRESSED DEEP DESPAIR OVER 
THE VIOLENCE IN WEST BEIRUT.  HE OBLIQUELY BUT 
CLEARLY BLAMED SYRIA FOR THE \"GRAVE AND SERIOUS\" 
EVENTS AND CALLED ON IT TO HELP SORT OUT THE 
CRISIS.  ON APRIL 18, KARAMI DEPARTED FOR DAMASCUS 
TO MEET WITH SARG LEADERS. 
 
---------------------------- 
REPLACING THE PRIME MINISTER 
---------------------------- 
15.  THE IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LATEST 
BATTLE IN WEST BEIRUT WAS TO FORCE THE RESIGNATION 
OF PRIME MINISTER KARAMI WHO, CONFRONTED WITH 
BARRI\'S SUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON SUNNI INTERESTS, HAD 
NO CHOICE BUT TO RESIGN.  THE SELECTION OF A NEW 
SUNNI PRIME MINISTER IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF 
RESTRAINTS.  FOREMOST IS THE UNLIKELIHOOD OF ANY 
SUNNI NOTABLE AGREEING TO REPLACE THE DESPAIRING 
KARAMI UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS.  KARAMI 
CLEARLY FELT HUMILIATED BY THE EVENTS OF APRIL 
16-17; NO SELF-RESPECTING SUNNI WOULD OVERTLY 
ATTEMPT TO PROFIT BY THE \"EFFENDI\'S\" DISCOMFITURE. 
SECONDLY, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO PERSUADE A SUNNI 
LEADER TO PRESIDE OVER A CABINET WITH AN 
UNREPENTANT BARRI AND JUMBLATT PRESENT.  FINALLY, 
SYRIA\'S APPROVAL OF THE NEW PRIME MINISTER WILL BE 
REQUIRED.  NOT KNOWING SYRIA\'S EXACT ROLE AND 
INTENTIONS IN THE EVENTS IN THE WEST, THE 
PROSPECTIVE SUNNI CANDIDATES WILL BE WARY. 
 
16.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CAN FORESEE ONE 
FORM WHICH A POSSIBLE SOLUTION MIGHT TAKE.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, A MEETING OF SUNNI RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL 
NOTABLES AT THE DAR AL-FATWA, THE SEAT OF THE GRAND 
MUFTI, MIGHT ISSUE A SET OF CONDITIONS THAT WOULD 
HAVE TO BE MET BEFORE A SUNNI COULD ACCEPT THE 
PREMIERSHIP.  THIS WOULD ALLOW THE NEW PRIME 
MINISTER TO CLAIM THE BACKING OF THE SUNNI 
COMMUNITY FOR NEW TERMS FOR HIS PARTICIPATION, THUS 
MORE OR LESS TURNING THE PAGE ON KARAMI\'S 
RESIGNATION.  WE CANNOT PRECLUDE THAT, UNDER THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, KARAMI HIMSELF MIGHT NOT BE 
REINCARNATED. 
 
17.  POSSIBLE PRECONDITIONS (APART FROM 
CONCILIATORY STATEMENTS AND GESTURES FROM AMAL AND 
THE PSP) INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT THAT BARRI AND 
JUMBLATT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN CABINET MEETINGS, AND 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY PLAN 
FOR THE SUNNI HEARTLANDS OF WEST BEIRUT, SIDON, AND 
POSSIBLY TRIPOLI.  ANY OF THE ABOVE CONCESSIONS 
WOULD BE HARD TO EXTRACT FROM THE SHIA, WHO ARE 
RIDING HIGH AT PRESENT.  THUS THE CABINET CRISIS 
MIGHT BECOME A DRAWN-OUT AFFAIR. 
 
------------------------ 
FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT 
------------------------ 
18.  AS FOR THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT, WE 
SEE TWO PRIMARY OPTIONS.  THE FIRST, A SMALL 
CABINET MUCH LIKE THE OUTGOING \"NATIONAL UNITY 
GOVERNMENT,\" APPEARS DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE UNDER 
PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  BASICALLY THE SAME 
PERSONALITIES WOULD BE INVOLVED, AND THE SAME 
ANIMOSITIES WOULD REAPPEAR.  IN SUM, THE 
DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE KARAMI GOVERNMENT ARE 
PROBABLY TOO DEEP TO BE SIMPLY PAPERED OVER, 
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE RISE OF SHIA POWER VIS-A-VIS 
THEIR SUNNI CORELIGIONISTS.  THE SECOND, AN 
ENLARGED GOVERNMENT, RUMORS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN 
CIRCULATING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, MIGHT PROVE A MORE 
FEASIBLE OPTION.  IN THIS CASE, WE WOULD POINT OUT 
THE REPUTATION OF FORMER PRIME MINISTER TAKIADDIN 
SOLH AS A CONCILIATOR PRESIDING OVER LARGE 
GOVERNMENTS (THOUGH AGAIN, WE RECALL KARAMI\'S 
PHOENIX-LIKE QUALITIES).

2.  ISRAEL REPORTEDLY CONTINUES CONTACTS AIMED AT 
USING INDIGENOUS FORCES TO MAINTAIN BORDER SECURITY 
AFTER THE JUNE 1 WITHDRAWAL OF ISRAELI TROOPS. 
ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS, THE ISRAELIS HAVE REACHED 
A COMPROMISE WITH THE DRUZE OF THE HASBAYA REGION 
WHEREBY THE DRUZE INHABITANTS WILL FORM A 
\"CIVIL GUARD,\" BUT WILL NOT HAVE DIRECT TIES TO THE 
ASL OR ANY OTHER ISRAELI-BACKED ORGANIZATION.  IF 
THESE REPORTS ARE TRUE, THIS DEAL REPRESENTS A VICTORY 
FOR THE LOCAL DRUZE WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY BEEN RESISTING 
ISRAELI PRESSURE (WHICH INCLUDED A BLOCKADE OF THE 
VILLAGES OF AKA KAMA AND MIMAS) TO RECRUIT THEM INTO 
THE ASL. 
 
3.  IN THE JAZZIN AREA, LOCAL PRESS REPORTS THAT 
EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH A 300-400 MAN 
CHRISTIAN FORCE INDEPENDENT OF THE ASL.  THESE 
REPORTS SUPPORT OTHER INFORMATION THE EMBASSY HAS 
RECEIVED CONCERNING A DEAL ALLEGEDLY STRUCK BETWEEN 
WALID JUMBLATT AND THE CHRISTIANS OF JAZZIN CONCERNING 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR JAZZIN AND THE IQLIM 
AL-KHARRUB.  DETAILS WERE REPORTEDLY HAMMERED OUT AT 
A MEETING HELD LAST WEEK IN MUKHTARA ATTENDED BY 
JUMBLATT, JEAN AZIZ, JAZZIN DEPUTY EDMOND RIZK, AND 
AN UNIDENTIFIED ISRAELI OFFICER.  AT THIS MEETING, 
JUMBLATT REPORTEDLY ACCEPTED THE FORMATION OF THIS 
CHRISTIAN FORCE, PROVIDED IT HAD NO OVERT CONNECTION 
WITH THE ASL; HE ALSO APPARENTLY SAID HE WOULD NOT 
ATTACK THE CHRISTIANS OF THE JAZZIN AREA OR THE 
IQLIM AL-KHARRUB AND OFFERED TO OPEN THE CHUF ROAD TO 
CHRISTIAN TRAFFIC IF THE COASTAL ROADS WERE CLOSED TO 
THEM.  IN RETURN, JUMBLATT ASKED FOR AN OPEN ROAD 
FROM THE CHUF TO THE DRUZE VILLAGES OF HASBAYA AND 
ROSHAYYA IN THE SOUTH, AND REMOVAL OF LF ELEMENTS 
FROM OUTSIDE THE AREA. 
 
4.  IN SIDON, THE TWO AXES OF CONFRONTATION REMAINED 
ACTIVE OVER THE WEEKEND.  ONE FRONT PITS LF FIGHTERS 
IN THE VILLAGES OF ABRA, HLALIYAH, AND QAYYA 
(SOUTHEAST OF SIDON) AGAINST SUNNI AND PALESTINIAN 
MILITIAMEN SUPPORTED BY THE LAF\'S SUNNI TAWEED 98TH 
BRIGADE FROM TRIPOLI LOCATED ON THE HILL OF MAR ELIAS. 
ON THE OTHER FRONT, ALSO LOCATED IN THE EASTERN 
SUBURBS, LF MILITIAMEN BASED IN THE VILLAGES OF 
MIYAH MIYAH, MAGHDUSHEH, AND DARB AL-SIM CONFRONT THE 
PALESTINIAN CAMPS OF MIYAH MIYAH AND AYN AL-HILWAH. 
ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 155 MM 
SHELLS FELL ON THE LAF\'S ZGHAYB BARRACKS IN CENTRAL 
SIDON.  LOCAL PRESS REPORTS CASUALTY FIGURES AS 
HIGH AS 26 KILLED AND WOUNDED IN WEEKEND FIGHTING. 
 
5.  ON THE POLITICAL FRONT, SIDON DEPUTY NAZIH BIZRI, 
CLAIMING TO HAVE LOST ANY HOPE FOR LAF REINFORCEMENT 
OR LF WITHDRAWAL, CALLED APRIL 19 ON THE 
CITIZENS OF SIDON TO TAKE UP ARMS IN THEIR OWN 
DEFENSE.  USAMA SAAD, VP OF THE \"NASSERITE POPULAR 
ORGANIZATION,\" WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED BIZRI TO DAMASCUS 
EARLIER IN THE WEEK, ALSO CALLED UPON THE AREA\'S 
CHRISTIAN VILLAGERS \"TO FORCE THE LF FROM THEIR 
VILLAGES SO THEY DON\'T BECOME THE TARGETS OF A 
MILITARY SOLUTION.\" 
 
6.  IN CONTRAST TO THE INFLAMMATORY RHETORIC EMANATING 
FROM SIDON\'S MUSLIMS, THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY SEEMS 
INTENT ON DAMPING DOWN THE LEVEL OF TENSION. 
FOLLOWING A VISIT TO ISRAEL (REF B) DURING WHICH 
HE WAS REPORTEDLY WARNED BY THE ISRAELIS NOT TO 
MAKE TROUBLE IN SIDON, AND AFTER A WEEKEND OF 
CONSULTATIONS WITH FORMER PRESIDENT CAMILLE CHAMOUN, 
SAMIR JA\'JA\' HELD A MORNING PRESS CONFERENCE ON 
APRIL 22 TO ANNOUNCE LF MEASURES AIMED AT DEFUSING THE 
CRISIS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE TEXT OF JA\'JA\'S 
STATEMENT, WE UNDERSTAND THESE TO INCLUDE: 
 
--  A.  A UNILATERAL CEASEFIRE EFFECTIVE 1600 LOCAL 
TIME ON APRIL 22; 
 
--  B.  A WITHDRAWAL OF NON-INDIGENOUS LF FORCES FROM 
THE SIDON AREA BEGINNING 1100 LOCAL TIME ON APRIL 23. 
THIS WITHDRAWAL IS IN ORDER TO \"GIVE THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT A CHANCE TO UNDERTAKE ITS RESPONSIBILITIES.\" 
(MILITIAMEN NATIVE TO THE AREA WILL REMAIN); 
 
--  C.  A CALL FOR THE PRESIDENT, PM, GOVERNMENT, AND 
LAF COMMAND TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURITY 
VIOLATIONS. 
 
JA\'JA\' FURTHER STATED HIS HOPE THAT THESE MEASURES 
WOULD CONSTITUTE A FIRST STEP TOWARD A SETTLEMENT 
AND CALL FORTH PEACE INITIATIVES FROM THE OTHER 
PARTIES INVOLVED.  HE INVITED JOURNALISTS TO WITNESS 
TOMORROW\'S WITHDRAWAL. 
 
7.  ON THE MILITARY LEVEL, THE QUADRIPARTITE MILITARY 
COMMISSION IS REPORTED BY THE PRESS TO BE WORKING 
FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL LAF UNIT TO 
SIDON.  NO DETAILS OF ARMAMENT OR CONFESSIONAL 
COMPOSITION ARE AVAILABLE.  IN ANY EVENT, PAST HISTORY 
INDICATES THAT IT CANNOT BE DEPLOYED IN THE ABSENCE 
OF A PRIOR POLITICAL AGREEMENT. 
 
8.  ONE USUALLY WELL INFORMED LOCAL PRESS SOURCE TELLS 
US THAT SYRIA IS TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE A SCENARIO 
WHEREBY SUNNIS OF SIDON CAN CLAIM VICTORY OVER THE LF 
AS A SOP FOR RECENT SUNNI LOSSES IN WEST BEIRUT.  THE 
PRICE OF SUCH A DEAL, HOWEVER, IS ALLEGED TO BE 
RENUNCIATION BY SUNNIS OF THEIR LINKS WITH PRO-ARAFAT 
PLO PALESTINIANS AND ACCEPTANCE OF RELIANCE UPON DRUZE 
AND ABU MUSA PALESTINIANS IN THEIR STEAD.  THE ALTERNA- 
TIVE, ACCORDING TO THIS SOURCE, IS FOR DRUZE, ABU MUSA 
MILITIA, AND AMAL TO ADMINISTER THE SAME LESSON IN 
SIDON THAT THEY DID IN WEST BEIRUT. 
 
9.  IN TYRE, ISRAELI FORCES CONTINUE THEIR 
PREPARATIONS FOR WITHDRAWAL.  IDF SPOKESMEN HAVE 
ANNOUNCED A WITHDRAWAL DATE OF APRIL 24, BUT ACTIVITIES 
ON THE GROUND INDICATE IT MAY OCCUR UP TO 24 HOURS 
EARLIER.  ALL BUILDINGS AND INSTALLATIONS OF 
POTENTIAL USE TO THE RESISTANCE ARE BEING DYNAMITED, 
THERE IS AS YET NO WORD ON POSSIBLE LAF DEPLOYMENT 
AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.

1.(U)  LOCAL PRESS REPORTS THE COMPLETION ON APRIL 24 
OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF 450 LF MILITIAMEN FROM THE SIDON 
AREA TO EAST BEIRUT.  HOWEVER, THESE REPORTS 
CONTINUE, LAF UNITS HAVE STILL NOT OCCUPIED THE 
FORMER LF POSITIONS EAST OF THE CITY, AND SPORADIC 
EXCHANGES OF FIRE CONTINUE TO MAR THE CEASE-FIRE.  LF 
MILITIAMEN NATIVE TO THE AREA ARE SAID TO REMAIN 
ARMED AND IN UNIFORM.  SCATTERED FIGHTING WAS 
REPORTED ON BOTH MAIN AXES OF CONFRONTATION WITH LF 
FIGHTERS IN QAYAA EXCHANGING FIRE WITH THE LAF, AND 
PALESTINIANS FROM THE MIYAH MIYAH CAMP FIRING MORTAR 
ROUNDS INTO THE VILLAGE OF MIYAH MIYAH.  LF OFFICIALS 
DENY THAT THE CHRISTIANS RETURNED FIRE, BUT THE 
PALESTINIANS CLAIM NINE WERE WOUNDED BY CHRISTIAN 
FIRE.  THE CITY REMAINS TENSE. 
 
2.(U)  PRESS REPORTS ALSO DESCRIBE THE APRIL 24 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE WESTERN BIQA\', JABAL 
BARUK, AND JAZZIN.  THE NEW ISRAELI FRONT LINE THUS 
STRETCHES FROM THE COAST EAST ALONG THE LITANI RIVER, 
THEN NORTHEASTERLY TO KFAR HUNA, AND EAST AGAIN TO 
MT. HERMON.  ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE REPORTEDLY DISMANTLED 
THEIR POSITIONS IN AND AROUND TYRE, THE ISRAELIS HAVE 
NOT YET LEFT THE CITY.  AS THEY LEFT THE WESTERN 
BIQA\', THEY DROPPED LEAFLETS WARNING THE LOCAL 
INHABITANTS AGAINST COOPERATING WITH THE SHIA 
RESISTANCE FIGHTERS:  \"WE MUST REMIND YOU THAT THE 
ISRAELI FORCES WILL NOT HESITATE TO DEAL FIRMLY AND 
WITHOUT MERCY WITH THOSE WHO COOPERATE WITH 
TERRORISM.\" 
 
3.(U)  OF THE NEWLY EVACUATED AREAS, ONLY THE WEST 
BIQA\' HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY THE LAF, ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS.  THERE, UNITS OF THE SHIA FIRST 
BRIGADE WERE WARMLY GREETED BY AREA RESIDENTS.  PSP 
FORCES, HOWEVER, OCCUPIED THE STRATEGIC HILL OF JABAL 
BARUK, ALTHOUGH THE ISRAELIS HAD DISMANTLED THEIR 
INSTALLATIONS BEFORE DEPARTING.  THE SITUATION IN 
JAZZIN, REPORTED REFTEL, REMAINS UNCLEAR. 
 
4.(C)  COMMENT.  EMBASSY CONTACTS HAVE LONG INDICATED 
THAT PSP LEADER WALID JUMBLATT INTENDED TO OCCUPY 
JABAL BARUK ONCE THE ISRAELIS LEFT.  IT IS UNLIKELY 
HE WILL BE CONVINCED TO YIELD THIS STRATEGIC POSITION 
TO AN LAF FORCE HE DOES NOT CONTROL.  END COMMENT.

1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  CONFUSION CONTINUES ABOUT EXACT SITUATION IN VILLAGES 
EAST OF SIDON (REFTEL) WITH BEIRUT PARTIES PLAYING USUAL 
ROLES IN GREEK CHORUS ON SIDELINES.  PALESTINIAN AND 
FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM FORCES APPARENTLY CONTINUE TO OCCUPY 
SEVEN CHRISTIAN TOWNS THEY SEIZED EAST OF SIDON.  REPORTS 
FILTER IN ABOUT SOME 25,000 TO 75,000 CHRISTIAN REFUGEES 
FROM REGION FLEEING TO EITHER JEZZIN OR BEIRUT. 
 
3.  MEANWHILE, ESLEWHERE: 
-  ASL COMMANDER LAHAD REPORTEDLY ISSUED STATEMENT 26 
APRIL THREATENING TO SHELL SIDON UNLESS PALESTINIANS AND 
MUSLIM MILITIA CEASE OFFENSIVE.  HE ALSO IS QUOTED AS 
WARNING LAF AGAINST SENDING TROOPS TO JEZZIN \"BEFORE 
BRINGING THE SECURITY SITUATION IN SIDON UNDER CONTROL AND 
FORCING THE PALESTINIANS BACK INTO THEIR CAMPS.\" 
 
-  PRESIDENT GEMAYEL TELEPHONED SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSAD TO 
BRIEF HIM ON DEVELOPMENTS IN SIDON; TWO LEADERS AGREED 
TO KEEP IN TOUCH. 
 
-  CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS LEADERS MET 26 FRIDAY AND DEPLORED 
SITUATION IN SIDON, CALLED ON FRIENDLY COUNTRIES 
(\"PARTICULARLY SYRIA\"), \"ALL FREE NATIONS\", AND POPE TO 
HELP.  OTHER CHRISTIAN LEADERS, LED BY CAMILLE CHAMOUN, 
ISSUED SIMILAR STATEMENTS 
 
-  GEMAYEL, PARLIAMENT SPEAKER HUSSEINI, AND PM KARAMI 
MET 26 APRIL TO REVIEW SITUATION.  KARAMI AFTER MEETING 
COMMENTED IN PART THAT RECENT ATTACKS IN SIDON WERE 
\"REACTIONS WHICH EXPOSED OUR BROTHERS...TO WHAT HAD 
HAPPENED TO THEIR BROTHERS IN SIDON\", COMMENT WHICH 
SPARKED SHARP CHRISTIAN REACTION AGAINST WHAT THEY 
VIEWED AS EXAMPLE OF KARAMI\'S LACK OF CONCERN FOR 
CHRISTIANS WOES.  REMAINDER OF KARAMI\'S REMARKS AND THOSE 
OF HUSSEINI AND OTHER MUSLIM LEADERS WERE DUTIFULLY 
SOLEMN. 
 
-   SIDON DEPUTY NAZIH BIZRI ISSUED A STATEMENT 
CONGRATULATING THE INHABITANTS OF SIDON FOR 
THEIR, \"VICTORY AGAINST THE LEBANESE FORCES AND 
THE AGENTS OF ISRAEL.\"  ACCORDING TO BIZRI, 
\"WHAT HAS COME TO PASS IS THE WORK OF 
SIDONIANS,\" NOT OF ARAFAT PALESTINIANS.  HE 
CALLED THE EXODUS OF CHRISTIAN VILLAGERS AN 
\"ISRAELI PLOT,\" AND CALLED ON THE REFUGEES TO 
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES. 
 
-  JA\'JA\'S CALL FOR A GENERAL STRIKE IN EAST 
BEIRUT FOR APRIL 27 AS A PROTEST AGAINST SIDON 
EVENTS, A CALL IN WHICH THE PHALANGE PARTY 
JOINED 26 APRIL, HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL, WITH 
ONLY OCCASIONAL GAS STATIONS, BAKERIES, MOM AND 
POP CORNER GROCERY STORES, PHARMACIES, AND 
SIDEWALK NEWSTANDS OPERATING. 
 
-   CHRISTIAN STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS 26 APRIL 
NUMBERING AN ESTIMATED 500 STUDENTS, MOSTLY FROM 
THE SOUTH, MARCHED ON THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE TO 
CRITICIZE THE FAILURE OF LAF TO DEPLOY TO 
PROTECT THE VILLAGES AFTER THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE 
LEBANESE FORCES.  DELEGATIONS OF DEMONSTRATORS 
MET WITH LAF COMMANDER GENERAL A\'OUN.  THE ONLY 
LAF REACTION THUS FAR HAS BEEN A CALL BY GENERAL 
A\'OUN FOR LAF SOLDIERS IN THE SIDON REGION TO 
REPORT TO THEIR UNITS. 
 
-  ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION BY SOUTHERNERS 
RESIDING IN BEIRUT OCCURRED 26 APRIL ON THE 
AUTOSTRADE NORTHEAST OF THE CAPITAL, WITH 
DEMONSTRATORS BLOCKING ROADS, BURNING TIRES, AND 
FIRING IN THE AIR.  OTHER DEMONSTRATIONS IN EAST 
BEIRUT ARE REPORTEDLY SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 27. 
 
-   APPARENTLY AS THE RESULT OF AMAL LEADER 
BARRI WORKING WITH CHRISTIAN LEADERS, AMAL HAS 
REPORTEDLY DEPLOYED IN STRENGTH OUTSIDE THE 
CHRISTIAN VILLAGE OF MAGHDUSHAH (POP. 8000) NEAR 
MIYAH MIYAH TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO THE VILLAGE 
AGAINST ADVANCING PALESTINIAN/MUSLIM FORCES. 
MAGHDUSHAH REMAINS CALM AND SECURE 27 APRIL. 
 
4.  COMMENT.  ESTIMATES OF NUMBERS OF REFUGEES 
APPEAR EXAGGERATED, AS DO LOCAL STORIES OF 
\"PALESTINIAN HORDES LOOTING AND BURNING.\" 
NONETHELESS, THIS PERSPECTIVE REFLECTS DEEP 
CHRISTIAN ANXIETY OVER THE SIDON EVENTS.  THE 
MAIN TARGETS FOR CHRISTIAN REACTION ARE LAF, FOR 
ITS FAILURE TO DEPLOY AS AGREED TO REPLACE 
DEPARTING LF FORCES, AND MUSLIM LEADERS FOR 
\"FAILING TO KEEP THEIR WORD\" TO PROTECT 
CHRISTIANS IN THE SOUTH AS AGREED ALSO AS THE 
PRICE OF LF PULLOUT.  BARRI\'S AMAL GETS GRUDGING 
CREDIT FOR DEPLOYING OUTSIDE MAGHDUSHAH. 
 
5.  LAF DEPLOYMENT AWAITS \"POLITICAL COVER\" 
WHICH A\'OUN TRIES TO INSIST ON BEFORE ACTING. 
SATURDAY, APRIL 27, IS FULL OF MEETINGS, 
CONSULTATIONS, TRAVELS, ETC., TRYING TO SET UP 
BACKSTAGE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE SUCH 
COVER. 
 
6.  SOME CHRISTIANS INTERPRET THE ABSENCE OF 
\"POLITICAL COVER\" FOR LAF DEPLOYMENT AS A 
REFLECTION OF AN AGREEMENT TO COMPENSATE THE 
SUNNIS IN SIDON FOR WHAT THEY LOST IN WEST 
BEIRUT.  THE MAIN WINNER THUS FAR, HOWEVER, 
APPEARS TO BE THE ARAFATI PLO, WHICH HAS 
EXPANDED ITS CONTROL AND STRENGTHENED ITS 
POSITION AROUND THE CAMPS, A RESULT WHICH 
PRESUMABLY WILL NOT WARM ASSAD\'S HEART. 
 
7.  THE PHALANGE\'S JOINING IN THE CALL FOR A 
GENERAL STRIKE IN PROTEST AGAINST THE SIDON 
EVENTS AND GOVERNMENT/LAF INACTION MAKES IT MORE 
DIFFICULT TO PORTRAY BEIRUT DEMONSTRATIONS AS 
LF-INTIFIDA ALONE DEFENDING CHRISTIAN INTERESTS, 
BUT FASTER REACTION WOULD HAVE GAINED THEM MORE 
CREDIT.  END COMMENT.

1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE NIGHT OF MAY 6-7 WITNESSED SOME OF THE HEAVIEST 
GREEN LINE FIGHTING SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
JULY 4, 1984, BEIRUT SECURITY PLAN.  AS ALWAYS, IT IS 
IMPOSSIBLE TO RECONSTRUCT THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS. 
HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE FIGHTING BEGAN AS AN 
EXCHANGE OF SHELLING (TANKS, ROCKETS, AND ARTILLERY BY 
BOTH SIDES), THEN ESCALATED INTO BLIND SHELLING OF 
RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN BOTH EAST AND WEST BEIRUT.  THE 
HEAVIEST FIGHTING WAS APPARENTLY CONCENTRATED IN THE 
PORT AND RAS AL-NABAH AREAS, WITH SHELLS HITTING THE 
EASTERN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF ASHRAFIYAH AND SIN 
AL-FIL, AS WELL AS VARIOUS WEST BEIRUT NEIGHBORHOODS. 
SCATTERED ROUNDS ALSO FELL IN THE GENERAL AREA OF AWKAR, 
RABIYAH, AND NACCACHE, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE 
THAT THESE AREAS WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. 
 
3.  ALTHOUGH EXACT FIGURES ARE UNAVAILABLE, IT IS CLEAR 
THAT CASUALTIES WERE HEAVIER THAN IS USUAL IN GREEN LINE 
FIGHTING.  EMBASSY SOURCES REPORT SEEING UP TO 
TWENTY-FIVE BODIES IN THE PORT AREA, AND THE LAF REPORTS 
LOSING ONE KILLED AND TWELVE INJURED.  THERE ARE 
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS THAT THE PSP AND AMAL REQUESTED A 
CEASE-FIRE FOR 1600 HOURS LOCAL TIME IN ORDER TO 
RETRIEVE THE DEAD AND WOUNDED FROM THE NO-MAN\'S LAND 
SEPARATING THE WARRING FACTIONS.  THE RIZK TOWER IN EAST 
BEIRUT WAS HIT BY A TANK ROUND, DESTROYING GOL 
REPEATER EQUIPMENT AND DAMAGING THE ANTENNA OF A 
GOVERNMENT TELEVISION STATION. 
 
4.  AUB SOURCES INDICATED THAT THE UNIVERSITY SUFFERED 
ONLY LIGHT DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH ONE STUDENT SUFFERED 
INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.  SCHOOL IS OPEN 
TODAY, MAY 7, BUT ATTENDANCE IS SPARSE.  THIS SOURCE 
REPORTED THAT THE PREVAILING ATTITUDE AMONG AMERICAN 
CITIZENS IN WEST BEIRUT IS ONE OF \"DEPRESSION.\"  THEY 
SEE NO DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE THREAT, SUCH AS OF THE LF OR 
LAF CROSSING THE GREEN LINE TO ATTACK WEST BEIRUT, BUT 
RECENT EVENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A FEELING OF 
HOPELESSNESS ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE OF LEBANON. 
THIS SOURCE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AUB AMCIT FACULTY MEMBERS 
ARE NOT PLANNING TO LEAVE BEIRUT NOW IN RESPONSE TO A 
PERCEIVED THREAT, MANY ARE PLANNING ON LEAVING LEBANON 
AFTER THE END OF THE TERM IN LATE JUNE, EITHER BY NOT 
RENEWING THEIR CONTRACTS OR BY TAKING A YEAR\'S 
SABBATICAL. 
 
5.  THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND REMAINS TENSE MAY 7, 
WITH MOST STORES REPORTEDLY CLOSED IN MUCH OF WEST 
BEIRUT AND THE ASHRAFIYAH SECTION OF EAST BEIRUT.  THOSE 
SHOPS THAT ARE OPEN ARE MOSTLY OF THE MOM AND POP FOOD 
STORE VARIETY.  THE SITUATION APPROACHES NORMAL IN 
EASTERN AREAS FURTHER FROM THE GREEN LINE.  ALL GREEN 
LINE CROSSINGS ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSED. 
 
6.  COMMENT.  IT IS STILL TOO SOON TO TELL IF RECENT 
OUTBREAKS REPRESENT SPONTANEOUS OUTBURSTS OR ARE 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.  WE EXPECT THE SHARP FIGHTING 
ALONG THE GREEN LINE TO CONTINUE.  HOWEVER, DESPITE 
UNSUBSTANTIATED RUMORS OF TROOP MOVEMENTS AND FEARS OF 
IMPENDING CLASHES, SUQ AL-GHARB HAS REMAINED CURIOUSLY 
QUIET.  END COMMENT.

2.  AT 1153 LOCAL (0853 Z), HIJACKED TWA FLIGHT 847 
FROM ATHENS TO ROME LANDED AT BEIRUT AIRPORT. 
HIJACKERS THREATENED TO KILL AN AMCIT CURRENTLY 
BEING HELD IN COCKPIT IF AIRCRAFT DID NOT RECEIVE 
40,000 LB OF FUEL.  MONITORED COCKPIT/TOWER RADIO CONVERSATIONS 
INDICATE THAT HIJACKERS ARE BEATING PASSENGERS AND

OFFICIAL IS REPORTEDLY AT AIRPORT TO CONDUCT 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIJACKERS.  AT 0910 ZULU, AIRCRAFT 
APPROACHED TERMINAL BUILDING;  PLANE THEN MOVED TO

MANAGER, REFUELING BEGAN AT 0912 Z. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO \"VOICE OF LEBANON\" RADIO AND MFA, THE 
HIJACKERS BELONG TO THE \"MUSA SADR (EL-HUSAYN) 
SUICIDE BRIGADE.\"  THIS IS THE SAME SHIA GROUP THAT 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ALIA HIJACKING 
JUNE 11-12.  THEY ARE SAID TO BE THREE IN NUMBER AND 
TO BE ARMED WITH THREE MACHINE GUNS AND FIVE HAND 
GRENADES.  AT LEAST ONE OF THE HIJACKERS REPORTEDLY 
SPEAKS WITH A LEBANESE ACCENT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 
BIQA\' VALLEY. 
 
4.  EMBASSY HAS ESTABLISHED VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE 
AIRCRAFT FROM THE AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE IN YARZE. 
EMBASSY IS ALSO MONITORING AIRCRAFT/CONTROL TOWER 
COMMUNICATIONS. 
 
5.  MFA INFORMED US BEFORE PLANE TOUCHED DOWN THAT 
GOL (PRIME MINISTER KARAMI AND INTERIOR MINISTER 
SKAFF) HAD TAKEN DECISION NOT TO ALLOW THE PLANE TO 
LAND.  WE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, NO ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK 
THE RUNWAY.  NEITHER THE GOL NOR THE AIRPORT 
AUTHORITIES HAVE CONTROL OF THE AIRPORT.  DE FACTO 
CONTROL LIES IN THE HANDS OF THE PSP, AMAL, AND 
OTHER MILITIAS PRESENT AT THE AIRPORT.  WHILE 
AIRBORNE, ONE OF THE HIJACKERS REPORTEDLY PULLED THE 
PIN FROM A GRENADE, AND THE PILOT SAID THAT HE WAS 
GOING TO FORCE A LANDING WITH OR WITHOUT GOL 
PERMISSION.  TRANSPORATION MINISTER JUMBLATT 
REPORTEDLY ORDERED THAT THE PLANE BE ALLOWED TO LAND 
WHEN HE LEARNED IT WAS SHORT OF FUEL. 
 
6.  THE HIJACKERS HAVE NOT MADE KNOWN ANY DEMANDS 
OTHER THAN TO REQUEST FUEL. 
 
7.  AMBASSADOR IS URGENTLY ATTEMPTING TO CONTACT 
AMAL AND PSP LEADERS AND MIDDLE EAST AIRLINES 
OFFICIALS IN AN ATTEMPT TO HALT THE BEATING AND TO 
ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PASSENGERS SHOULD THEY BE 
DEPLANED HERE.  WE DO NOT WANT THE AMCIT PASSENGERS 
TO BE REMOVED FROM THE AIRPORT FOR ANOTHER LOCATION 
IN WEST BEIRUT, BUT RATHER PLACED ON THE NEXT 
AVAILABLE OUTBOUND FLIGHT.

AND MEASURES AGAINST U.S. EFFORTS TO SHUT DOWN BIA 
 
1.  (U) AMIDST MUCH FANFARE, LEBANESE AUTHORITIES 
HAVE SET OUT THE FIRST STEPS OF WHAT IS ULTIMATELY 
INTENDED TO BE A NEW SECURITY PLAN FOR BEIRUT 
AIRPORT.  THE PLAN WAS REPORTEDLY DRAWN UP AT A 
MEETING HELD AT THE AIRPORT ON JULY 3 WHICH WAS 
ATTENDED BY AIRPORT SECURITY OFFICIALS AND 
MILITIA REPRESENTATIVES, AND IS THEORETICALLY 
TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS. 
 
2.  (U) IN A SEPARATE BUT RELATED DEVELOPMENT, 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL, AT A JULY 4 MEETING AT THE 
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE ATTENDED BY A WHO\'S WHO OF 
THE LEBANESE MILITARY, INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY, 
CUSTOMS, AND AVIATION SECTORS (AS WELL AS THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY), 
INSTRUCTED THE PARTICIPANTS TO DRAW UP A SIX- 
PRONGED CAMPAIGN TO COUNTER THE U.S. MOVES TO 
SHUT DOWN THE AIRPORT. 
 
3.  (U) UNDER THE SECURITY PLAN, ARMED MILITIAMEN 
WOULD BE BARRED FROM THE AIRPORT, ALL UNAUTHORIZED 
ENTRANCES TO THE TWO RUNWAYS WOULD BE CLOSED OFF, 
AND CARS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO APPROACH THE MAIN 
TERMINAL BUILDING.  BEIRUT TELEVISION THURSDAY 
EVENING SHOWED FOOTAGE OF DIRT BERMS BEING CON- 
STRUCTED TO BLOCK TWO DIRT ROADS LEADING TO THE 
RUNWAYS, AND MEMBERS OF THE LAF SIXTH BRIGADE 
RIGOROUSLY SEARCHING PASSENGERS BOARDING MEA 
FLIGHTS AT THE AIRPORT.  THE PRESS QUOTES 
AIRPORT SECURITY PERSONNEL AS SAYING THAT THE 
PLAN WILL BE OBSERVED BY ALL PARTIES DUE TO A 
HIGH LEVEL \"POLITICAL DECISION.\" 
 
4.  (U) CONTROVERSY OVER THE SECURITY PLAN HAS 
ALREADY BROKEN OUT.  GEN. YASSIN SWAYD, THE HEAD 
OF THE AIRPORT SECURITY APPARATUS, WHO SUBMITTED 
HIS RESIGNATION SEVERAL MONTHS AGO TO PROTEST THE 
CHAOS AT THE AIRPORT, ANNOUNCED THURSDAY THAT HE 
WILL NOT RETURN TO HIS JOB.  (THE GOL HAS NOT 
ACCEPTED HIS RESIGNATION.)  SWAYD, WHO ATTENDED 
THE THURSDAY MEETING AT BA\'ABDA, PROTESTED THAT 
IN SPITE OF PRESS REPORTS THAT MEMBERS OF THE 
AIRPORT\'S SECURITY APPARATUS ATTENDED THE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT MEETING AT WHICH THE SECURITY PLAN WAS DRAWN 
UP, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE.  MOREOVER, HE SAID, 
\"THE SITUATION AT THE AIRPORT WILL REMAIN AS IT 
IS UNTIL THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT FORCES TAKE 
REAL CONTROL OF THE AIRPORT.\" 
 
5.  (U) THE SIX-PRONGED PLAN ORDERED BY THE 
PRESIDENT TO COUNTER THE U.S. MEASURES INVOLVES A 
SERIES OF \"LOCAL, ARAB, AND INTERNATIONAL MOVES 
TO EXPLAIN LEBANON\'S POSITION, AND THE MEASURES THAT 
LEBANON MIGHT TAKE TO PROTECT ITS RIGHTS AND TO 
PREVENT THE DAMAGE THAT MIGHT BE CAUSED TO ITS 
ECONOMY, NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND INTERNATIONAL 
REPUTATION.\"  THE PLAN WOULD INVOLVE A DIPLOMATIC 
OFFENSIVE, WHILE TASK FORCES HAVE BEEN CREATED IN 
THE AREAS OF DIPLOMACY, POLITICS, SECURITY, 
INFORMATION, CIVIL AVIATION, AND \"ELECTRONIC 
FACILITIES.\"  A MILITARY SECURITY COMMITTEE, 
HEADED BY ARMY COMMANDER GEN. \'AWN, WAS CHARGED 
WITH DRAFTING A SECURITY PLAN (APPARENTLY SEPARATE 
FROM THAT ALREADY DRAWN UP) TO CONTROL THE SITUATION 
INSIDE AND AROUND THE AIRPORT.  ARMY CHIEF OF 
STAFF GEN. MAHMUD TAY ABU DARGHAM WILL CHAIR A 
COMMITTEE \"TO ENSURE SECURITY BASED ON A POLITICAL 
AGREEMENT,\" MFA SYG TURK WILL HEAD THE COMMITTEE 
ON A DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE.  THE SIX TASK FORCES 
ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET AGAIN ON TUESDAY, JULY 16. 
 
6.  (C) COMMENT:  THE JADED LEBANESE HAVE LONG 
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING SECURITY CONCERNS 
ADDRESSED BY YET ANOTHER \"SECURITY PLAN.\"  THE 
GOL HAS OUTDONE ITSELF IN SPADES THIS TIME, WITH 
THE HAPLESS GEN. DARGHAM HAVING DRAWN THE UNENVIABLE 
TASK OF RESOLVING THE KEY PROBLEM OF ENSURING 
SECURITY BASED ON A POLITICAL AGREEMENT--A GOAL 
WHICH HAS ELUDED THE LEBANESE FOR THE PAST TEN 
YEARS OF CIVIL WAR.

REFERRED TC THEM AS \"INDISPENSABLE MEASURES\". 
 
4.  HE SAID THAT    AFTER PRESENTATION OF HIS REPORT 
PRESIDENT GEMAYEL HAS INSTRUCTED THE CHIEF JUSTICE TO 
INSTRUCT THE PROCUREUR GENERAL TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY 
LEGAL ACTIONS TO BRING THE HIJACKERS TO JUSTICE.  TURK 
STRESSED THAT THE PRESIDENT AND THE ENTIRE GOL IS TAKING 
THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S 
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE  HAD BEEN\"VERY FIRM\". 
 
5.  TURK THEN TURNED TO SECURITY MEASURES AT BIA.  HE 
STRESSED GOL AGREED WITH USG THAT IT WAS ABSOLUTELY 
NECESSARY TO TAKE STEPS TO INSURE THAT EVENTS SUCH AS 
THE HIJACKING DO NOT AND CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN. 
 
6.  TURK SAID THAT IN THE AREA OF \"TECHNICAL MEASURES,\" 
SUCH AS THE INTRODUCTION OF IMPROVED RADAR, REORGANIZED 
CONTROL TOWER, AND IMPROVED AND INCREASED SECURITY 
DEVICES AND LUGGAGE INSPECTION, GEMAYEL HAS PUT THE 
HEAD OF THE COUNCIL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION 
(CDR) MALEK SALEM IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING THE GOL 
EFFORT. 
 
7.  IN THE AREA OF BROADER SECURITY MEASURES, TURK SAID 
THAT ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL DARGHAM HAS BEEN CHARGED 
BY GEMAYEL AND PRIME MINISTER/FOREIGN MINISTER KARAMI 
TO CONTACT THE MILITIAS CONCERNED TO ENSURE THAT BIA 
IS SEPARATED FROM OTHER MILITARY/POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND 
IS BROUGHT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE LEGAL AUTHORITIES, 
I.E., THE ARMY AND THE ISF.  HE NOTED THAT DARGHAM HAD 
TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF BARRI FROM DAMASCUS TO BEGIN 
SECURITY CONVERSATION WITH AMAL. 
 
8.  AS FOR THE SECURITY PLAN FOR THE ROAD TO THE AIRPORT, 
TURK SAID LAF CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL AOUN HAS BEEN PUT 
IN CHARGE OF SECURING THE ROAD AND HAS PUT FORTH A PLAN 
TO DEPLOY THE ARMY ALONG THE THREE ROADS LEADING TO THE 
AIRPORT.  TURK SAID A\'OUN IS PURSUING THE NECESSARY 
POLITICAL CONTACTS TO ENABLE HIM TO IMPLEMENT HIS PLAN. 
 
9.  TURK CONCLUDED BY ASSURING DCM THAT GOL IS TAKING 
THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY. 
 
10.  COMMENT:  TURK IS NOT IN INNER DECISION-MAKING 
CIRCLE, BUT IS TAKING A PROMINENT LEAD IN THE GOL\'S 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO LINE UP SUPPORT TO KEEP BIA OPEN. 
TURK FIT DCM IN BETWEEN OTHER ALREADY SCHEDULED 
APPOINTMENTS AND THERE WAS NO TIME FOR DISCUSSION. 
TURK SUGGESTED THAT HE AND DCM MEET NEXT WEEK TO DISCUSS 
ISSUES FURTHER.  DCM AGREED.

1.(U)  BEIRUT PRESS REPORTS CONTINUING CLASHES BETWEEN 
SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST \"ISLAMIC MEETING\" FORCES AND 
PRO-SYRIAN ARAB DEMOCRATIC (ADP) PARTY MILITIAMEN IN 
TRIPOLI.  ACCORDING TO THESE ACCOUNTS, DURING THE JULY 
15 FIGHTING ELEMENTS OF THE LAF SECOND BRIGADE (CHARGED 
WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TRIPOLI SECURITY PLAN) FOUGHT 
SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS AGAINST THE

COMPROMISED ITS ABILITY TO PLAY ITS ASSIGNED ROLE AS 
IMPARTIAL ARBITER IN THE CONTINUING DISPUTES. 
 
2.(U)  ACCORDING TO THESE ACCOUNTS, SYRIAN EFFORTS TO 
CONTAIN THIS MOST RECENT OUTBREAK ARE TAKING TWO FORMS. 
ADP AND TAWHID LEADERS HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN SUMMONED BY 
SYRIAN VP KHADDAM TO DAMASCUS FOR TALKS TO TAKE PLACE 
THE WEEK OF JULY 22.  SYRIAN MILITARY OBSERVERS ARE ALSO 
EXPECTED IN TRIPOLI ITSELF TO SUPERVISE THE CURRENT

3.(C)  COMMENT.  THE SYRIANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY USED THE 
ADP TO EXERT PRESSURE ON THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS, MOST 
OF WHOM ARE ARAFAT SUPPORTERS, AND MANY OF WHOM ARE 
FORMER FATAH MEMBERS WHO JOINED TAWHID WHEN ARAFAT WAS

REF:  DAMASCUS 4580 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION.  SIX WEEKS AFTER 
ISRAEL ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF ITS MILITARY 
WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH LEBANON, THAT REGION 
REMAINS TENSE AND UNSETTLED.  ALTHOUGH RELIABLE, 
FIRST-HAND REPORTS ARE SPARSE, IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT 
POTENTIALLY EXPLOSIVE SITUATIONS CONTINUE TO 
PREVAIL IN SIDON AND JAZZIN.  TROUBLES LINGER 
ALONG THE BORDER STRIP BUT APPEAR TO HAVE 
DIMINISHED. 
 
3.  IN SIDON, INCREASED FEARS OF AN OPEN CONFLICT 
INVOLVING PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS, THE PNSF, AMAL, 
LOCAL MUSLIM MILITIAS, AND PERHAPS THE PSP HAVE 
LED TO SYRIAN-SPONSORED EFFORTS TO HEAD OFF ANY 
SUCH SHOWDOWN AND TO AVERT ANOTHER \"WAR OF THE 
CAMPS.\"    MEANWHILE, SYRIA IS REPORTEDLY 
BOLSTERING THE AMAL MILITIA WITH ADDITIONAL 
EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF DOUBTS 
ABOUT THE STEADFASTNESS OF ITS OTHER ALLIES. 
END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
4.  THE LOCAL PRESS AND MOST OF OUR LEBANESE 
POLITICAL CONTACTS ARE REPLETE WITH STORIES THAT 
TENSIONS ARE ESCALATING IN SIDON.  THESE STORIES 
ARISE, IN PART, FROM REPORTS THAT PLO LEADER 
ARAFAT IS REINFORCING HIS LOYALISTS IN THE THE AYN 
AL-HILWAH AND MIYAH MIYAH REFUGEE CAMPS AND IN 
SIDON PROPER WITH ADDITIONAL MEN AND MATERIEL. 
ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT CONFIRM OR QUANTIFY THESE 
REINFORCEMENTS, THE LEADERS OF SIDON ARE, WE HEAR, 
EXTREMELY EDGY\" ABOUT THE ESCALATING TENSIONS 
THERE AND THE PROSPECTS FOR A FLARE-UP SIMILAR TO 
THE \"WAR OF THE CAMPS\" IN BEIRUT. 
 
5.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS REPORTS, IN EARLY 
JULY, SYRIAN TROOPS IN EASTERN LEBANON FORCED THE 
PRO-ARAFAT \"BADR BATTALION\" OF THE PALESTINIAN 
LIBERATION ARMY OUT OF THE BIQA\', WHERE IT HAD 
BEEN SINCE 1982, AND BACK TO JORDAN.  THE PRESS 
ALSO CITED REPORTS FROM CAIRO THAT ARAFAT HAD 
PERSUADED THE GOE TO ALLOW HIM TO TRANSFER A PLA 
UNIT, THE AYN JALUT BRIGADE, FROM EGYPT TO SOUTH 
LEBANON.  ON JULY 18, MUSTAFA SA\'AD\'S \"POPULAR 
NASSERITE ORGANIZATION\" CLAIMED TO HAVE 
INTERCEPTED TWO SHIPMENTS OF ARMS DESTINED FOR THE 
CAMPS AND TO HAVE CAPTURED THE SMUGGLERS, WHO WERE 
IDENTIFIED AS FOUR PRO-ARAFAT PALESTINIANS BEARING 
JORDANIAN PASSPORTS.  IN A \"RADIO MONTE CARLO\" 
INTERVIEW, SIDON MP NAZIH BIZRI SAID THE TWO 
CONTAINERS OF ARMS HAD BEEN SENT FROM JORDAN VIA 
THE NORTHERN LEBANESE PORT OF TRIPOLI.  MOST 
RECENTLY, ON JULY 23, AN ISRAELI NAVAL VESSEL 
FIRED ON AND SET ABLAZE A HONDURAN-REGISTERED 
FREIGHTER IN SIDON HARBOR.  ALTHOUGH RELIABLE 
DETAILS ARE SPARSE, THE CARGO VESSEL WAS EVIDENTLY 
SUSPECTED OF CARRYING ARMS; ITS MOVEMENTS WERE 
DESCRIBED BY ISRAELI RADIO AS \"SUSPICIOUS.\" 
 
6.  ON THE GROUND, THE RECENT ESCALATION OF 
TENSIONS IN SIDON HAS SO FAR BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY 
STILL RELATIVELY MINOR SHIA VS. PALESTINIAN 
CLASHES.  (WE HAVE SEEN NO RECENT REPORTS OF 
SIGNIFICANT CLASHES BETWEEN LEBANESE SHIA AND 
SUNNI IN SIDON, THOUGH ANIMOSITIES BETWEEN THEM 
RUN HIGH.)  AMAL AND PNSF FIGHTERS CLASHED BRIEFLY 
ON JULY 15 WHEN THE LATTER ATTEMPTED TO REOCCUPY 
PREVIOUSLY EVACUATED POSITIONS NEAR AYN AL-HILWAH 
CAMP.  OTHER AMAL-PALESTINIAN CLASHES OCCURRED THE 
SAME DAY NEAR BA\'LABAKK AND ON JULY 21 AT THE BURJ 
AL-BURAJINAH CAMP IN BEIRUT.  ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 
22-23, SHIITE-PALESTINIAN TENSIONS ALSO SURFACED 
IN TYRE, WHERE AMAL FORCES ENCIRCLED BASS REFUGEE 
CAMP, FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING OF AN AMAL MILITIAMAN. 
 
7.  FACED WITH PERSISTENT SHIITE-PALESTINIAN AND 
BROADER SHIITE-SUNNI TENSIONS IN VARIOUS AREAS OF 
LEBANON, SYRIA APPEARS TO BE GOING TO CONSIDERABLE 
LENGTHS TO PUSH ITS ALLIES --- BOTH LEBANESE AND 
PALESTINIAN --- TO AVERT A REPETITION IN SIDON OF 
A BEIRUT-STYLE \"WAR OF THE CAMPS.\" 
 
8.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE 
SYRIAN-SPONSORED CONFERENCE OF JULY 8-9, LEBANESE 
MUSLIM LEADERS DECLARED THEY WOULD NOT TOLERATE 
THE REESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRE-1982 SITUATION IN 
LEBANON, WHEN THE PLO WAS VIRTUALLY A STATE WITHIN 
A STATE.  THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID THEY WOULD NOT 
ALLOW THE \"SEDITION\" WHICH HAD PREVAILED IN BEIRUT 
AND ITS PALESTINIAN CAMPS TO EXTEND TO SIDON. 
 
9.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE DAMASCUS CONFERENCE, 
AND REPORTEDLY WITH SYRIAN VICE PRESIDENT 
KHADDAM\'S BACKING, PRO-SYRIAN PARTIES ANNOUNCED A 
PLAN TO FORM A \"NATIONAL ALLIANCE FRONT,\" ONE OF 
WHOSE OBJECTIVES WOULD BE TO AVOID FRICTIONS IN 
SIDON.  THE FRONT WOULD INCLUDE, INTER ALIA, NABIH 
BARRI\'S AMAL MOVEMENT, WALID JUMBLATT\'S \"NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT,\" AND THE \"NATIONAL POLITICAL 
COUNCIL\" OF SIDON, WHICH IS CHAIRED BY NAZIH BIZRI 
AND INCLUDES MUSTAFA SA\'AD\'S \"POPULAR NASSERITE 
ORGANIZATION.\" 
 
10.  CONCOMITANTLY, SYRIA HAS REPORTEDLY BEEN 
TRYING TO ACHIEVE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE AMAL 
AND THE PNSF.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, KHADDAM 
ARRANGED A MEETING IN DAMASCUS ON JULY 9 BETWEEN 
BARRI AND PNSF LEADERS WHICH JUMBLATT ALSO 
ATTENDED.  ON JULY 12, THE MAIN PRO-SYRIAN GROUPS 
IN SIDON --- AMAL, THE NATIONAL POLITICAL COUNCIL, 
THE POPULAR NASSERITE ORGANIZATION, AND THE 
ISLAMIC SOCIETY --- AND THE PNSF ISSUED A JOINT 
STATEMENT GIVING ARAFAT\'S SUPPORTERS IN SIDON ONE 
WEEK TO LEAVE THE CITY.  THE STATEMENT 
SPECIFICALLY BRANDED FOUR INDIVIDUALS AS \"SYMBOLS 
OF ARAFAT\'S CAPITULATIONIST POLICY\":  ABDEL AZIZ 
ABU FADAH, RAJI AL NAJMAH, HUSSEIN AL HAIBI, AND 
MOEMEN. 
 
11. MOST RECENTLY, ON JULY 22-24, SYRIAN VICE 
PRESIDENT KHADDAM HOSTED A LARGE MEETING OF 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PNSF, THE NATIONAL 
POLITICAL COUNCIL OF SIDON, AMAL, AND THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC FRONT.  ACCORDING TO BANNER REPORTS IN 
THE BEIRUT PRESS, THIS DAMASCUS MEETING RESULTED 
IN THE APPROVAL OF A PNSF PROPOSAL TO FORM A MIXED 
COMMITTEE TO \"REDEFINE ON PAPER\" LEBANESE- 
PALESTINIAN RELATIONS.  AS FOR SIDON ITSELF, THE 
CONFEREES ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR (A) THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF ALL ARMED PALESTINIAN ELEMENTS FROM 
THE CITY AND A PROMISE NOT TO ORGANIZE NIGHT 
PATROLS IN THE SUBURBS; (B) THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMAL 
MILITIAMEN FROM THE SECTOR EXTENDING FROM RMAYLAH 
TO THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE OF SIDON; (C) THE NDF TO 
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING ORDER IN THE 
CITY AND CONTROLING ACCESS ROADS, UNDER THE 
SUPERVISION OF THREE SYRIAN ARMY OFFICERS; AND 
(D) A \"POLITICAL CONTROL COMMISSION\" CHAIRED BY 
KHALID JUMBLATT AND COMPRISING NAZIH BIZRI, ANWAR 
FATAYRI, INAAM RAAD, AND USSAMA SA\'AD. 
 
12.  THE MAJOR QUESTION WHICH REMAINS UNANSWERED 
IS WHAT THE LINE-UP WILL BE WHEN AND IF SERIOUS 
FIGHTING ERUPTS IN SIDON.  AS NOTED ABOVE, SYRIA 
IS APPARENTLY PUSHING HARD FOR ITS LEBANESE ALLIES 
--- BE THEY SHIA, SUNNI, OR DRUZE --- AND THE PNSF 
TO STAND FIRM AGAINST THE PRO-ARAFAT PALETINIANS. 
WE AND MANY OBSERVERS HERE, HOWEVER, BELIEVE THAT 
FIGHTING WOULD MOST LIKELY ERUPT BETWEEN AMAL AND 
THE ARAFATISTS AND THAT THE PNSF FORCES WOULD 
QUICKLY JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THEIR PALESTINIAN 
BRETHREN AGAINST THE LEBANESE SHIA.  THIS SCENARIO 
WOULD MIRROR THAT OF THE \"WAR OF THE CAMPS\" IN 
BEIRUT IN WHICH PRO AND ANTI-ARAFATISTS COMBINED 
FORCES AGAINST THE SHIA. 
 
13.  THE ROLE OF THE SIDONESE SUNNI MILITIAS IS 
LESS PREDICTABLE.  WOULD THEY FIGHT AS LEBANESE, 
I.E., WITH THE SHIA AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS? 
WOULD THEY FIGHT AS SUNNI, I.E., WITH THE 
PALESTINIANS AGAINST THE SHIA?  OR WOULD THEY TRY 
TO REMAIN NEUTRAL?  WE AGREE WITH REFTEL THAT, FOR 
NOW, BIZRI AND SA\'AD HAVE PERHAPS SEIZED UPON AN 
ANTI-ARAFATIST STANCE AS A LOW-COST WAY TO PLEASE 
THE SYRIANS.  ONCE FIGHTING BEGINS, HOWEVER, WE 
ARE FAR FROM CERTAIN THAT THE SUNNI WILL CONTINUE 
THIS LINE.  SHIITE-SUNNI TENSIONS IN SIDON, AS IN 
WEST BEIRUT, RUN HIGH, AND WE RECALL THAT DURING 
THE \"WAR OF THE CAMPS\" THE REMNANTS OF THE SUNNI 
MURABITUN MILITIA JOINED WITH THE PALESTINIANS TO 
MAKE NIGHTTIME RAIDS ON AMAL AND PREDOMINANTLY 
SHIITE LAF 6TH BRIGADE POSITIONS. 
 
14.  THE PSP REMAINS ANOTHER WILD CARD.  AS THE 
\"WAR OF THE CAMPS\" IN BEIRUT PROCEEDED, THE 
DRUZE-SHIA ALLIANCE BECAME INCREASINGLY STRAINED, 
AND, AS FIGHTING IN WEST BEIRUT EARLIER THIS MONTH 
DEMONSTRATED, TENSION BETWEEN AMAL AND THE PSP 
CONTINUES TO RUN VERY HIGH.  AN ADDITIONAL 
COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND 
SUNNI MILITIAMEN HAVE REPORTEDLY JOINED THE PSP 
SINCE THE DEFEAT OF THE MURABITUN MILITIA IN APRIL. 
 
15.  FACED WITH THE PROSPECT THAT THE SUPPOSEDLY 
PRO-SYRIAN PNSF, POPULAR NASSERITE ORGANIZATION, 
AND PSP MAY, IN FACT, SIDE WITH THE PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIANS OR AT LEAST AGAINST AMAL, SYRIA HAS 
REPORTEDLY BEGUN TO REINFORCE THE AMAL MILITIA 
WITH ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING (SEE DATT 
SEPTEL).  DURING THE APRIL 16-17 \"BATTLE OF 
BEIRUT\" AND THEN THE \"WAR OF THE CAMPS,\" THE AMAL 
MILITIA\'S WEAKNESSES AND LIMITATIONS WERE 
EXPOSED.  SYRIA IS NOW APPARENTLY TRYING TO 
BOLSTER THE STRENGTH OF ITS MOST RELIABLE ALLY.

SUBJECT: A BAD WEEK FOR BEIRUT 
 
1.(U) SUMMARY. THE WEEK AUGUST 11-18 WITNESSED THE WORST 
OUTBREAKS OF VIOLENCE IN BEIRUT SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THE SYRIAN SECURITY PLAN FOR WEST BEIRUT. TWO MASSIVE 
CAR BOMBS ROCKED EAST BEIRUT ON AUGUST 14 AND 17, AND 
SHELLING ACROSS THE GREENLINE INTENSIFIED UNTIL A 
FRAGILE CEASEFIRE WAS PUT BACK IN PLACE ON AUGUST 15. 
OTHER VIOLENCE WAS REPORTED IN ZAHLE, NEAR THE PALESTINIAN 
CAMPS, AND IN TYRE. MEANWHILE THE INABILITY OF THE 
CABINET TO MEET SYMBOLIZED THE CONTINUED STALL IN THE 
POLITICAL PROCESS. END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(U) EARLY IN THE WEEK BLIND SHELLING ACROSS THE 
GREEN LINE RESUMED, CULMINATING IN A SIX HOUR EXCHANGE 
OF HEAVY ARTILLERY AND ROCKET FIRE ON AUGUST 15 THAT 
ENDED FINALLY AT THE FOURTH ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE A CEASE- 
FIRE. INTERMITTENT SHELLING HAS SINCE OCCURED, BUT AT 
A REDUCED RATE. A WEDNESDAY NOON CAR BOMB IN SADD AL 
BASHURIYAH CAUSED 13 DEATHS. 
 
3.(U) SATURDAY\'S CAR BOMB, OUTSIDE A BUSY SUPERMARKET 
ON THE MAIN COASTAL ROAD IN ANTILYAS, CAUSED 67 DEATHS 
AND 122 WOUNDED. MOST OF THE DEATHS WERE CAUSED BY THE 
FIRE  THAT TRAPPED SHOPPERS AND EMPLOYEES INSIDE THE 
BOMBED BUILDING, BUT THE BLAST ITSELF, ESTIMATED AT THE 
FORCE OF 1,000 KILOS OF TNT, WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HURL 
FIVE BODIES ACROSS THE COASTAL HIGHWAY AND INTO THE SEA. 
ACCORDING TO THE PRESS AGENCY \"MARKAZIA\" RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE BOMB HAS BEEN CLAIMED BY A GROUP CALLING ITSELF 
\"THE RED HAND - BRIGADE OF SADR.\" 
 
4. (U) DURING THE WEEK ZAHLE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO 
EARLY MORNING ATTACKS THAT HAVE CAUSED ONLY MATERIAL 
DAMAGE. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, LF LEADER ELIE 
HOBAYKA AGREED AT A FRIDAY MEETING WITH A LOCAL GREEK 
CATHOLIC DELEGATION  TO CLOSE PHALANGE OFFICES IN THE 
CITY AND TO WITHDRAW LF MILITIAMEN. 
 
5. (U) IN OTHER EVENTS THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON AMAL OFFICES 
IN TYRE ON AUGUST 15. LEBANESE STATE TV REPORTED FIRST 
THAT THIS ATTACK HAD BEEN COMMITTED BY HIZBALLAH FORCES 
TO PROTEST AMAL RESTRICTIONS ON HIZBALLAH ACTIVITIES IN 
THE SOUTH AND THEN SUGGESTED THAT THE FIRE COULD HAVE 
COME FROM A ISRAELI PATROL VESSEL. ON AUGUST 17 THERE 
WAS A CLASH USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND RPG\'S BETWEEN 
AMAL AND PLO FORCES OUTSIDE THE SABRA CAMP. PALESTINIANS 
CLAIMED THAT AMAL WAS HOLDING MOUSTAPHA DIAB, AKA 
ABOUL FATEH, HEAD OF THE ARAFAT FORCES IN LEBANON. AN 
AUTHORIZED AMAL SPOKESMAN SAID THAT AMAL WAS NOT NOW 
HOLDING ANY PALESTINIANS. 
 
6. (U) THE WEEK ALSO FAILED TO REGISTER ANY FORWARD 
PROGRESS IN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. IN FACT AFTER THE 
ANTILYAS CAR BOMB PRIME MINISTER KARAME WAS QUOTED AS 
SAYING HE \"DIDN\'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHETHER TO RESIGN OR 
TO CONTINUE ON.\" SHIITE CABINET MINISTERS USAYRAN AND 
BARRI, AFTER ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WOULD ATTEND A MEETING 
OF MUSLIM CABINET MINISTERS ON AUGUST 19, STATED THAT 
\"IT IS TIME THAT THE SECURITY CONDITION IMPROVES AND THAT 
SYRIA CONTRIBUTES TO AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE GROUND.\" FOR 
ITS PART THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE LF ISSUED A 
STATEMENT \"PROMISING  TO TAKE REVENGE FOR INNOCENT 
VICTIMS AND TO UNDERTAKE A RESPONSE AT A LEVEL COMMEN- 
SURATE WITH THE CRIME.\" 
 
7. (C) COMMENT. LAST WEEK\'S EVENTS HAD NO POSITIVE ASPECT. 
LITTLE IS EXPECTED TO COME FROM TODAY\'S MEETING OF 
MUSLIM CABINET MINISTERS, FROM WHICH THE TRAVELING 
WALID JUMBLATT WILL BE ABSENT. ON THE CHRISTIAN SIDE 
CONSULTATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN PREPARATION 
FOR FRANJIYYAH\'S RELEASE ON SEPT. 1 OF HIS PROPOSALS 
FOR REFORM. ON THE SECURITY FRONT THERE ARE TOO MANY 
FLASHPOINTS - ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER STRIP, NEAR THE 
PALESTINIAN CAMPS, ALONG THE GREEN LINE, IN ZAHLE OR 
IN TRIPOLI, TO PREDICT A QUIET WEEK AHEAD.

SUBJECT:  CONFLICT BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND THE LEBANESE 
          COMMUNIST PARTY 
 
REF:  BEIRUT 1006 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DURING BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF ON FEBRUARY 26, 
DR. JAMIL NAHMI, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF PUBLIC SECURITY 
(SURETE GENERALE), OFFERED HIS ANALYSIS OF THE RECENT 
CLASHES IN WEST BEIRUT BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND LEBANESE 
COMMUNIST PARTY(LCP) MILITIAS. 
 
3.  NAHMI FIRST NOTED THE DEEP IDEOLOGICIAL DIVIDE WHICH 
SEPARATES RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM AND COMMUNIST 
DOCTRINE.  UNLIKE MANY OTHER OPPOSING MILITIAS IN LEBANON 
WHICH MAINTAIN SOME CONTACTS DESPITE THEIR ANIMOSITIES, 
THE IDEOLOGICAL DIVIDE BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND THE LPC WAS 
SO DEEP THAT IT HAD PRECLUDED ANY WORKING CONTACTS 
BETWEEN THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
4.  AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, NAHMI SITUATED THE ORIGIN OF 
THE CURRENT HIZBALLAH/LPC CONFLICT IN SOUTH LEBANON.  HE 
ASSERTED THAT OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS AMAL HAD SUCCEEDED 
IN REDUCING SSNP AND LPC PRESENCE IN SOUTH LEBANON AND 
THAT MANY COMMUNIST MILITIAMEN HAD MIGRATED TO WEST 
BEIRUT.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
HIZBALLAHI HAD ALSO COME TO WESMV BEIRUT FROM THE SOUTH. 
THUS, NAHMI EXPLAINED, THESE TWO FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSING 
MILITIAS FOUND THEMSELVES CONCENTRATED IN WEST BEIRUT, 
WHICH IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AREA.  THIS CONCENTRATION OF 
FORCES IN WEST BEIRUT, THE GENERAL LAWLESSNES AND 
DISORDER THERE, AND THE LACK OF ADEQUATE COUNTERVAILING 
SECURITY FORCES HAD PROVIDED FERTILE GROUND FOR A 
HIZBALLAH/LPC CONFLICT.  THE CLASHES HAD APPARENTLY 
ERUPTED AT THE STREET LEVEL AND SIMPLY ESCALATED. 
 
5.  ASKED ABOUT REPORTS (REFTEL) THAT SHIITE AND SUNNI 
MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALISTS WERE COOPERATING IN WEST BEIRUT 
AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS, NAHMI RESPONDED THAT THERE WAS 
SOME \"COINCIDENCE OF OBJECTIVES\" BETWEEN PRO-IRANIAN 
FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS, BE THEY SHIITE OR SZNNI.  THEY 
BOTH TOOK GUIDANCE FROM TEHRAN, WHOSE OWN RELATIONS WITH 
SYRIA HAVE DETERIORIATED, AND THEY BOTH HAD THEIR OWN 
REASONS TO OPPOSE PRO-SYRIAN LEFTIST GROUPS SUCH AS THE 
LCP AND THE SSNP.  SUNNI FUNDAMENTALISTS SUCH AS THE 
TAWHIID MOVEMENT REMAINED BITTER OVER THEIR DEFEAT IN 
TRIPOLI LAST FALL BY SSNP XD LCP FORCES BACKED BY 
SYRIA.  THE SHIITE FUNDAMENTALISTS SUCH AS HIZBALLAH WERE 
NOW DETERMINED TO OPPOSE MORE DIRECTLY PRO-SYRIAN LEFTIST 
GROUPS, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE RELIGIOUS-VERSUS-SECULAR 
IDEOLOGICAL SPLIT AND BECAUSE OF THEIR DETERIORATING 
RELATIONS WITH SYRIA ITSELF.  NAHMI PREDICTED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE TRADITIONAL RIFT BETWEEN SHIITE AND SUNNI 
FUNDAMENTALISTS WOULD QUICKLY REAPPEAR WHEN THEY NO 
LONGER FACED A COMMON ENEMY. 
 
6.  IN A BRIEF ASIDE, NAHMI MENTIONED THAT HE HAD MET 
SEPARATELY WITH PSP LEADER JUMBLATT AND AMAL LEADER BARRI 
OVER THE PAST TEN DAYS.  HE SAID JUMBLATT SEEMED TO KNOW 
WERE HE STANDS WITHIN HIS COMMUNITY AND SPOKE WITH SOME 
CONFIDANCE AND AUTHORITY.  BARRI, HOWEVER, SEEMED 
\"EXTREMELY ILL AT EASE\" ABOUT HIS POSITION AND ACTED AS 
IF HE WERE \"WALKING ON SHIFTING SANDS.\"  UNFORTUNATELY, 
THE CONVERSATION WAS PREEMPTED AT THIS POINT, AND WE 
CALD NOT DRAW NAHMI M FURTHER ON HIS ASSESSMENT OF 
BARRI\'S POSITION WITHIN THE SHIITE COMMUNITY. 
 
7.  BIOGRAPHIC NOTE.  JAMIL NAHMI HAS A DOCTORATE IN 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE LEBANESE 
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL.  A STAUNCH GEMAYEL LOYALIST, NAHMI 
WAS ALSO AFFILIATED WITH THE \"HOUSE OF THE FUTURE,\" THE 
PRESIDENT\'S THINK TANK AND PUBLISHING HOUSE.  ALTHOUGH A 
PHALANGIST, NAHMI COMES FROM KFAR AKKA NEAR AMIUN IN 
NORTH LEBANON, I.E., FROM THE FRANJIYYAH HEARTLAND.

1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. WE READ WITH CONSIDERABLE INTEREST REFTEL ON THE 
JOCKEYING OF SYRIAN AND IRANIAN INTERESTS IN LEBANON. 
EMBASSY BEIRUT, HOWEVER, MIGHT WELL EMPHASIZE DIFFERENT 
POINTS IN JUDGING THE STATUS OF SYRIAN, IRANIAN, AND 
ISRAELI POLICY IN LEBANON. 
 
3. WE JUDGE THAT SYRIA AND ISRAEL ARE IN A CLASS BY 
THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF ABILITY TO EXERCISE POWER 
IN LEBANON. THEY BORDER ON LEBANON; THEY CONTINUOUSLY 
PROJEC CONVENTIONAL MILITARY POWER INTO LEBANON; 
AND, THEY BOTH HAVE ESTABLISHED NETWORKS OF LEBANESE 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES. OF THESE THREE INGREDIENTS OF POWER 
IRAN HAS ONLY A LESS EXTENSIVE, BUT GROWING, NETWORK 
OF FRIENDS AND ALLIES. 
 
3. WE AGREE WITH DAMASCUS REFTEL THAT THE ASPIRATIONS 
OF FUNDAMENTALIST IRAN AND SECULAR SYRIA IN LEBANON ARE 
IN CONFLICT. PRACTICALLY EVERYWHERE, HOWEVER, THE 
IRANIANS ARE PLAYING CATCH-UP BALL AGAINST SUBSTANTIAL 
SYRIAN ADVANTAGES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INTERPRETATION OF 
SEVERAL RECENT PHENOMENA WOULD BE DIFFERENT: 
 
--THE TRUCE IN THE CAMPS WAR ARRANGED BY IRANIAN 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER BESHARATI WAS EXCEPTIONALLY 
TRANSITORY; IT LASTED ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO EVACUATE 
A HANDFUL OF PALESTINIANS FROM THE CAMPS. GIVEN 
IRAN\'S LACK OF LEVERAGE OVER AMAL AND THE PALESTINIANS, 
THE SIGNIGICANCE OF THIS TRUCE WAS HEAVILY DISCOUNTED 
BEFORE IT WENT INTO EFFECT. 
 
--ALTHOUGH THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION MAY BE THE MOST 
DYNAMIC MOVEMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST OVER THE PAST 
DECADE, IT IS OUR FIRM IMPRESSION THAT A MAJORITY 
OF LEBANESE SHIA CONSIDER IT TO BE MORE THREATENING 
THAN ALLURING. OF COURSE IT HAS ALLURE FOR THE MORE 
FUNDAMENTALIST ELEMENTS, BUT THEY ARE STILL A MINORITY. 
EVEN HIZBALLAH\'S SHAYK FADLALLAH MAINTAINS THAT IRAN\'S 
REVOLUTION CANNOT BE DUPLICATED IN LEBANON. 
 
--SYRIA\'S FORBEARANCE IN NOT CLAMPING DOWN ON IRANIAN 
ACTIVITIES IN LEBANON SEEMS TO BE A PRODUCT OF SYRIAN 
CONFIDENCE IN ITS ABILITY TO DO SO AND ITS SENSITIVITY 
REGARDING IRANIAN-SYRIAN TIES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT IT IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY A LACK OF CAPACITY.

SUBJECT:  THE CAMPS WAR IN LEBANON 
 
1.  (SECRET/NOFORN - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE WAR OF THE CAMPS IN LEBANON CONTINUES 
UNABATED WITH FIERCE FIGHTING.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, 
LEBANESE POLITICIANS HAVE DIFFERING VIEWS ON THE WAR, 
DEPENDING ON THEIR POLITICAL OPTIC.  THERE FOLLOWS OBSER- 
VATIONS BY SEVERAL LEBANESE POLITICIANS IN CONVERSATIONS 
WITH AMBASSADOR DECEMBER 3 AND 4.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE CAMPS WAR BETWEEN THE PALESTINIANS AND THE SHIA 
AMAL FORCES CONTINUES TO RAGE.  NOW IN ITS SIXTH WEEK, 
A MAJOR STRATEGIC CONFRONTATION CONTINUES AROUND SIDON. 
THE RASHADIYAH CAMP NEAR TYRE  REMAINS ENCIRCLED. 
SHATILA AND BURJ AL-BURAJINAH IN BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS CONTINUE UNDER RELENTLESS BOMBARDMENT.  AS 
REPORTED BY DAO/BEIRUT, ELEMENTS OF THE MUSLIM 6TH AND 
1ST BRIGADES OF THE LEBANESE ARMY HAVE JOINED WITH AMAL 
IN THE SIEGES OF SHATILA AND BURJ AL-BURAJINAH.  THE 
SYRIANS ARE PROVIDING AMMO AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO AMAL. 
THERE ARE UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF UP TO 300 SYRIAN TROOPS 
IN AMAL UNIFORMS JOINING THE FIGHTING. 
 
4.  NATIONAL LIBERALS PARTY PRESIDENT DANY CHAMOUN 
(MARONITE CHRISTIAN) TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT HE IS DELIGHTED 
WITH THE WAR OF THE CAMPS.  CHAMOUN SAID THAT AS LONG AS 
THE SHIA AND THE PALESTINIANS ARE KILLING ONE ANOTHER AND 
LEAVING THE CHRISTIANS ALONE, THE SITUATION IS JUST FINE. 
 
5.  FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER FUAD BUTROS (ORTHODOX 
CHRISTIAN) SEES THE CAMPS WAR AS ENHANCING THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN LEBANESE PRESIDENT GEMAYEL 
AND SYRIAN PRESIDENT ASSD.  BUTROS SAID THAT SYRIAN 
FAILURE TO HAVE THEIR SURROGATE AMAL FIGHTERS ACHIEVE 
VICTORY OVER THE PALESTINIANS HAS FURTHER UNDERMINED 
ASSAD\'S POSITION, WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN WEAKENED BY 
WESTERN PRESSURE FOLLOWING THE REVELATIONS OF SYRIAN- 
SPONSORED TERRORIST ACTS.  BUTROS BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE 
ASSAD IS WEAKENED, HE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO BE 
ACCOMMODATING TO GEMAYEL. 
 
- 
6.  SHIA MODERATE DEPUTY RAFIQ SHAHIN (WHOSE CONSTITUENCY 
OF NABATIYAH INCLUDES THE MAGHDUSHAH AREA WHICH COMMANDS 
THE HEIGHTS OVERLOOKING SIDON) VIEWS THE WAR AS A SERIOUS 
CHALLENGE TO THE SHIA POSITION.  SHAHIN TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT THE SHIA CANNOT AFFORD TO ALLOW THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A PALESTINIAN ENCLAVE CENTERED AROUND 
SIDON AND INCLUDING THE HEIGHTS OF MAGHDUSHAH.  IF THE 
PALESTINIANS SUCCEED IN ESTABLISHING AND HOLDING SUCH AN 
ENCLAVE, SOUTHERN LEBANON AND THE SHIA WILL BE CUT IN 
HALF.  THE PALESTINIANS WILL CONTROL ACCESS BETWEEN 
BEIRUT AND THE SOUTH AND WILL BE IN A POSITION TO CHOKE 
IT OFF AT ANY TIME.  FURTHERMORE, PALESTINIAN RETENTION 
OF MAGHDUSHAH WILL PUT THE PALESTINIANS WITHIN A 
KILOMETER OR TWO OF LAHAD\'S ISRAELI-SPONSORED \"ARMY OF 
SOUTH LEBANON.\"  SHAHIN SAID LAHAD\'S MILITIA OCCUPIES THE 
TERRAIN BETWEEN JEZZINE AND SIDON, OVERLOOKING MAGHDUSHAH. 
SHAHIN ASSERTED THAT A PALISTIANH CLAVE AROUND SIDO, 
WOULD MEAN UNREMITTING PALESTINIAN OPERATIONS AGAINST 
LAHAD AND ISRAEL. 
 
7.  SHAHIN DESCRIBED AMAL LEADE NABIH BERRI\'S POSITION 
AS UNDER GREAT PRESSURE FROM ALL SIDES.  IF BERRI AND 
AMAL CANNOT REMOVE THE PALESTINIANS AROUND SIDON AND FORCE 
THEM BACK INTO THE CAMPS, BERRI AND AMAL AS A COHESIVE 
MOVEMENT WILL BE FINISHED.  THE DIVIDED SHIA COMMUNITY 
WOULD THEN BE PREY TO EVEN MORE EXPLOITATION BY THE 
IRANIAN-SPONSORED HIZBALLAH EXTREMISTS. 
 
- 
8.  SHAHIN SAID THAT BECAUSE OF OQE CURRENT SITUATION, 
HIZBALLAH FIGHTERS ARE FIGHTING AND DYING WITH AMAL. 
SHAHIN\'S SON IN NABITIYAH DESCRIBED TO SHAHIN DECEMBER 3 
THE FUNERAL OF 15 SHIA FROM ONE VILLAGE:  12 AMAL 
FIGHTERS AND 3 HIZBALLAH.  SHAHIN SAID HIZBALLAH IS ALSO 
COOPERATING WITH AMAL AROUND TYRE AND IN BEIRUT.  THE 
HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP DOES NOT LIKE SUPPORTING BERRI BUT 
BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE BLOODSHED, THE SHIA ARE UNITED 
AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS. 
 
9.  SHAHIN ALSO DESCRIBED BLOODY ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY 
BOTH SIDES AGAINST NON-COMBATTANTS, WOUNDED, AND 
PRISONERS. 
 
10.  SHAHIN ALSO THOUGHT THAT THE FAILURE THUS FAR OF THE 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED AMAL EFFORT ENHANCES GEMAYEL\'S 
LEVERAGE WITH ASSAD. 
 
11.  COMMENT:  IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS THIRD VERSION OF THE 
CAMPS WAR DIFFERS FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO.  IF THE 
PALESTINIANS SUCCEED IN SECURING AN ENCLAVE IN AND AROUND 
SIDON, THEY WILL HAVE SUCCEEDED IN CHANGING THE MILITARY 
AND POLITICAL MAP OF LEBANON FROM BEIRUT TO THE 
ISRAELI BORDER.

SUBJECT:  LEBANON:  EXCHANGE WITH MFA ECONOMIC DIRECTOR 
          ON U.S. WHEAT AID AND SALES 
 
REF:  BEIRUT 2062 (NOTAL) 
 
1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT) 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  MFA DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
SALLOUKH MADE DEMARCHE TO DCM ON FAMILIAR THEME OF A 
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT WHEAT PROGRAM WITH THE U.S. 
SALLOUKH ARGUED THAT FREE WHEAT WOULD HAVE GOOD 
PROPAGANDA VALUE FOR THE U.S. AND WOULD HELP THE 
GOL\'S FINANCES.  REGARDING DISTRIBUTION, SALLOUKH 
THOUGHT THAT ALL FOREIGN ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO LEBANON 
WERE FLAWED IN THIS REGARD AND CONTENDED THAT LEBANON 
WAS NO WORSE THAN OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE SMUGGLING 
PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO HIM, IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED; 
ONLY \"5 PERCENT\" OF LEBANESE BREAD IS DIVERTED TO 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  THE DCM STRESSED THAT THE USG 
IS CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION TO ALL 
CONFESSIONS WITHOUT MILITIA INVOLVEMENT.  EVEN IF 
LEBANON WERE GRANTED FREE WHEAT FROM THE U.S., IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH OUR WORLDWIDE POLICY, IT WOULD BE TIED 
TO THE GOL\'S ENACTING ECONOMIC REFORMS.  SPECIFICALLY, 
THE GOL WOULD HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF ITS 
38.7 MILLION USD BREAD SUBSIDY.  THE DCM STATED THAT 
RECENT PRESS REPORTS, CITING AMBASSADOR BOUHABIB AS 
BLAMING THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIRUT FOR BLOCKING A 
WHEAT PROGRAM, WERE ERRONEOUS AND THE DECISION TO 
PROVIDE AID INVOLVES VARIOUS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS 
IN THE USG.  REGARDING WHEAT SALES, THE DCM UNDERLINED 
OUR STRONG DESIRE TO BE GIVEN A FAIR OPPORTUNITY TO 
COMPETE IN GOL WHEAT TENDERS.  SALLOUKH PLANS TO ENLIST 
ECONOMY MINISTER QASSIR\'S HELP IN PREPARING A REPORT 
ON THE WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON.  HE WILL ALSO RAISE 
U.S. INTEREST IN COMPETING FOR GOL WHEAT TENDERS WITH THE 
MINISTER.  THE DCM REPLIED THAT WE WELCOMED ANY 
INFORMATION SALLOUKH COULD PROVIDE ON BOTH SUBJECTS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ON APRIL 12, DCM, ACCOMPANIED BY ECON COUNSELOR, 
PAID INTRODUCTORY CALL ON AMBASSADOR FAWZI SALLOUKH, 
LEBANESE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS ECONOMIC DIRECTOR. 
MEETING LASTED APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR.  THE PRINCIPAL 
TOPIC OF DISCUSSION WAS WHEAT FOR LEBANON. 
 
4.  AMBASSADOR SALLOUKH MADE A STRONG PITCH FOR A 
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT WHEAT PROGRAM, WITH THE USG 
PROVIDING FREE WHEAT TO LEBANON.  SALLOUKH INDICATED THAT 
AMBASSADOR BOUHABIB HAS ALREADY RENEWED THIS REQUEST IN 
WASHINGTON.  FIRST AMONG THE REASONS CITED BY SALLOUKH 
FOR A WHEAT PROGRAM WAS THE \"PROPAGANDA\" VALUE FOR THE 
U.S. IN SO DIRECTLY HELPING THE GOL.  SECONDLY, SALLOUKH 
STATED THAT FREE WHEAT WOULD ASSIST THE GOL IN COPING 
WITH ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE SHORTAGE.  SALLOUKH PROPOSED A 
U.S. WHEAT GRANT BE HANDLED AS A REGULAR WHEAT PURCHASE. 
THAT IS, THE GOL WOULD SELL THE FREE WHEAT TO THE 
MILLERS WHO IN TURN WOULD SELL THE FLOUR TO BAKERS.  THE 
HARD CURRENCY SAVED FROM NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE WHEAT 
COULD BE SPENT ELSEWHERE, TOWARD PAYING LEBANON\'S 
EXTERNAL DEBT OR PURCHASES OF FOREIGN-MADE EQUIPMENT FOR 
LEBANON\'S PUBLIC UTILITIES, FOR EXAMPLE. 
 
5.  SALLOUKH STATED THIS FRIDAY, APRIL 15, HE WILL BE 
MEETING ECONOMY MINISTER VICTOR QASSIR.  SALLOUKH WILL 
SEEK THE MINISTER\'S SUPPORT IN PREPARING A REPORT ON 
THE WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON TO BE PROVIDED TO THE 
U.S. 
 
6.  DCM TOOK THAT OPENING TO EXPLAIN TO SALLOUKH THAT 
PRESS REPORTS APPARENTLY STIMULATED BY LEBANESE 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. ABDALLAH BOUHABIB THAT 
WASHINGTON FAVORED WHEAT AID TO LEBANON BUT THAT IT WAS 
OUR EVIL EMBASSY IN BEIRUT THAT WAS BLOCKING IT WERE 
UNINFORMED.  FIRST OF ALL, ON THE BASIS OF THE SEVERE 
NEED WE PERCEIVED HERE LAST FALL WHEN THE LEBANESE POUND 
AND PRICES HAD GONE CRAZY, WORSENING THE PLIGHT OF 
ALREADY POOR PEOPLE, WE HAD INCREASED THE FOOD AID THAT 
WE PROVIDED LEBANON THROUGH PVO\'S BY 35 PERCENT, TO A 
VALUE OF SOME USD 23 MILLION.  SECONDLY, THE DECISION TO 
PROVIDE THE FOOD AID BY THAT ROUTE, AS OPPOSED TO 
THROUGH A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, HAD BEEN 
ARRIVED AT BY OUR USUAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, 
INVOLVING VARIOUS OFFICES IN WASHINGTON (AID, STATE, 
COMMERCE, AGRICULTURE, THE CONGRESS) AS WELL AS THE 
EMBASSY. 
 
7.  THE DCM THEN CONTINUED THAT ANY INFORMATION ON THE 
WHEAT SITUATION IN LEBANON IS MOST WELCOME.  HE STATED 
THAT OUR CURRENT FOOD ASSISTANCE TO LEBANON IS CHANNELED 
THROUGH PRIVATE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE OF THE 
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT\'S WEAKNESSES.  HE UNDERLINED THAT THE 
PVO\'S SEEM THE BEST VEHICLES TO ENSURE THAT OUR 
ASSISTANCE REACHES NEEDY LEBANESE, REGARDLESS OF CON- 
FESSION.  AMONG THE QUESTIONS DEBATED IN CONSIDERING 
WHEAT FOR LEBANON, THE DCM EXPLAINED, WERE EQUITABLE 
DISTRIBUTION, BREAD SMUGGLING OR \"EXPORTS\" TO NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES AND REFORM OF THE GOL\'S BREAD SUBSIDY.  DCM 
MADE IT CLEAR THAT BY \"EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION\" WE MEAN 
HONEST DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WITHOUT 
REGARD TO CONFESSION AND WITHOUT MILITIA INVOLVEMENT. 
 
8.  SALLOUKH RESPONDED THAT THE SUBSIDY MIGHT BE 
REDUCED, BUT SAID THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE 
\"GRADUALLY,\" GIVEN THE CURRENT PUBLIC PRESSURE OVER 
SALARY INCREASES AND THE PERCEIVED HIGH COST OF LIVING. 
THIS DECISION IS \"POLITICAL,\" HE DECLARED.  DCM REPLIED 
THAT WE ESTIMATED THE BREAD SUBSIDY TO COST THE GOL 
USD 38.7 MILLION PER YEAR IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND 
STRESSED OUR WORLDWIDE POLICY INTEREST IN REFORMS DIRECTE 
TOWARD MORE OPEN MARKET-ORIENTED ECONOMIC POLICIES. 
 
9.  REGARDING BREAD EXPORTS, SALLOUKH CLAIMED 
THAT THIS PROBLEM IS \"NOT AS DANGEROUS AS IMAGINED,\" 
HE DID NOT DENY THAT BREAD IS BEING SENT ABROAD. 
\"FRANKLY SPEAKING,\" SALLOUKH SAID HE IS AWARE THAT THERE 
ARE TAXI DRIVERS DRIVING FROM LEBANON TO DAMASCUS WITH 
5 KILOS OF LEBANESE BREAD WHO MAY GIVE ONE KILO AT THE 
BORDER TO SYRIAN OFFICIALS TO FACILITATE CROSSING. 
HE ALSO THOUGHT SOME LEBANESE BREAD GOES TO CYPRUS, 
BUT IS ONLY CONSUMED BY LEBANESE RESIDENT THERE, \"A 
SMALL NUMBER.\"  REGARDING SMUGGLING TO ISRAEL, SALLOUKH 
THOUGHT IT NON-EXISTENT.  IN TOTALY, SALLOUKH ESTIMATED 
THE TOTAL BREAD DIVERTED FROM LEBANON AT NO MORE THAN 
5, AND PROBABLY CLOSER TO 1 PERCENT OF THETOTAL 
PRODUCED, NOT THE 25 PERCENT SOMETIMES CITED.  WE 
LISTENED BUT DID NOT AGREE, INDICATING INTEREST IN ANY 
INFORMATION SALLOUKH COULD PROVIDE IN THAT REGARD. 
 
10. ON DISTRIBUTION, SALLOUKH THOUGHT MOST AID TO 
LEBANON IS NOT HANDLED AS IT SHOULD BE.  HE SAID THAT 
SAUDI ASSISTANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAD BEEN HANDED-OUT 
LOCALLY, REGARDLESS OF INCOME LEVEL; ALL 23 FAMILIES 
IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDING WERE OFFERED KING FAHD FOOD 
PACKAGES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS FAMILY AND TWO 
RELATIVES LIVING IN THE SAME BUILDING, THE TWENTY 
OTHERS ACCEPTED THE AID, THOUGH NOT IN NEED.  SALLOUKH 
BELIEVED MALDISTRIBUTION EXISTS IN OTHER FOREIGN 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO LEBANON AND FOR THAT MATTER 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  SALLOUKH CONTENDED THAT COMPARED 
TO OTHER COUNTRIES RECEIVING U.S. WHEAT, DISTRIBUTION 
AND SMUGGLING WOULD BE NO WORSE IF NOT SLIGHTLY LESS 
OF A PROBLEM IN LEBANON. 
 
11.  THE DCM STATED THAT THE USG WAS NOT ONLY 
CONSIDERING GIVING LEBANON WHEAT, BUT IS ALSO VERY 
INTERESTED IN SELLING IT AS WELL.  HE POINTED TO 
OUR STRONG DESIRE TO COMPETE FOR GOL WHEAT TENDERS 
UNDER OUR EEP PROGRAM AND THE NEED TO GIVE AMPLE 
NOTICE TO U.S. EXPORTERS, CITING THE MOST RECENT 
EXPERIENCE IN REFTEL.  (GOL INFORMED US--DELIBERATELY 
LATE--THAT IT HAD OPENED THE TENDER ON MARCH 28, WITH 
A DEADLINE OF MARCH 30.)  SALLOUKH SAID HE WOULD 
RAISE THIS ISSUE WITH MINISTER QASSIR IN THEIR UPCOMING 
MEETING. 
 
12.  COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE SALLOUKH IS SINCERE IN HIS 
PLEDGE TO RAISE THE WHEAT TENDER ISSUE WITH QASSIR. 
WE WOULD, HOWEVER, BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IF THIS 
RESULTS IN A REAL OPENING FOR U.S. EXPORTERS, GIVEN 
ALLEGATIONS  THAT QASSIR  HIMSELF BENEFITS 
FROM THE TRANSACTION AS IT OCCURS.  END COMMENT. 
 
13.  BIO DATA:  AMBASSADOR SALLOUKH, TWENTY-EIGHT YEAR 
VETERAN OF THE MFA, APPEARS TO BE IN HIS EARLY TO 
MID FIFTIES.  HE IS A SHI\'ITE MUSLIM FROM BETWEEN 
ALEY AND SOUK-EL-GHARB IN THE SHOUF MOUNTAINS.  ALTHOUGH 
HE HAS SERVED THREE MONTHS AS MFA ECONOMIC AFFAIRS 
DIRECTOR, HE ALREADY SEEMS MORE ON TOP OF THE JOB THAN 
HIS PREDECESSOR GEORGE KHOURY, WHO HAD BEEN THERE 
ONE AND A HALF YEARS AND IS NOW OFF TO SANAA.  MOST OF 
SALLOUKH\'S YEARS ABROAD HAVE BEEN SPENT IN THE AFRICAN 
CONTINENT:  2 YEARS IN LIBERIA, 7 IN SIERRA LEONE, 9 
IN NIGERIA AND 4 IN ALGIERS.  FOR THE SAKE OF HIS 
CHILDREN\'S EDUCATION, MANY OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN 
SPENT WITHOUT HIS WIFE, DAUGHTER AND 2 SONS WHO 
REMAINED IN LEBANON.  SALLOUKH SAYS HE HAS KNOWN 
MANY AMERICAN AMBASSADORS, MOST RECENTLY AMBASSADOR 
JOHNSTONE.

ATTENTION| 
 
PURSUANT TO THE POSITIVE INITIATIVE PROPOSED TO SOLVE 
THE ISSUE OF THE HOSTAGES AND THE SUBSEQUENT RESPONSES 
OF THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THE ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR 
THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCES THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
FIRST - THERE WILL BE NO NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN 
ADMINISTRATION.  THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS ENDING THE HOSTAGE 
ISSUE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR NEGOTIATIONS.  RATHER, IT 
COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MORAL AND HUMAN VALUES THAT 
WE BELIEVE IN.  THE DAY WILL NEVER COME THAT WE 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF KILLING AND CRIME. 
FOLLOWING A CAREFUL, ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE STUDY OF 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLITICAL DETENTE IN THE REGION, 
HOWEVER, WE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE THIS DEVELOPMENT 
FORWARD WITH A POSITIVE INITIATIVE REGARDING THE HOSTAGE 
ISSUE, WHICH CONSTITUTES BOTH A PROBLEM AND A SOLUTION 
IN THE CONTEXT OF REGIONAL EVENTS. 
 
THIS IS A CHANCE FOR THE LEADING PERSONALITIES OF THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER AND THINK 
RESPONSIBLY OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE OF THIS ISSUE, FOR 
THIS IS A CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER COME AGAIN.  ALL WE ASK 
IN RETURN IS WHAT IS STIPULATED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS PACT 
(SIC) REGARDING THE INTIFADA OF OUR HEROIC PALESTINIAN 
PEOPLE ON THE ONE HAND, AND NHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF SUPPORTING THE DETENTE WHICH HAS BEGUN 
IN THE REGION, ON THE OTHER. 
 
SECOND - THE JUST CAUSE OF OUR PEOPLE IS PART OF A 
GREATER WHOLE; THE SUPPORT OF LEGAL RIGHTS IS PART OF A 
GREATER WHOLE, AND THE ISSUE OF THE USE OF POWER AND 
VIOLENCE OR INITIATIVES OF PEACE AND STABILTY ARE ALSO 
FUNDAMENTAL.  THIS IS THE BASIS OF WHAT IS ACHIEVED 
THROUGH OUR IDEOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES.  WEAKNESS WAS NEVER 
AN INCENTIVE FOR CHANGING OUR COURSE AND POWER HAS NEVER 
FORCED ANY CHANGES.  WHAT IS NECESSITATED BY OUR 
PRINCIPLES AND FUNDAMENTALS IS WHAT WILL BE.  WE ARE 
ALWAYS PREPARED FOR VIOLENCE AND FOR CALM AND PEACEFUL 
ATTITUDES.  THIS IS A TIME OF POSITIVE RESPONSES.  DO 
NOT WASTE THIS OPPORTUNITY THROUGH HAUGHTY WORDS THAT 
PROVOKE US AND ENCOURAGE US TO DRAW BACK AND RESORT TO 
VIOLENCE AND FORCE TO GAIN RECOGNITION.  THIS ISSUE MUST 
BE SOLVED POSITIVELY AND THE ADMINISTRATION MUST ASSUME 
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. 
 
THIRD - WE ARE ASTONISHED AT THE RIDICULOUS DEALS MADE 
BY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DUKAKIS IN ANNOUNCING THE 
TRANSFER OF THE AMERICAN EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM IN ORDER 
TO OBTAIN THE SUPPORT OF ZIONIST PRESSURE GROUPS IN THE 
ELECTIONS.  HE HAS BLATANTLY DEFIED THE FEELINGS OF OUR 
HEROIC PEOPLE AND THE MOSLEMS OF THE WORLD.  THIS 
FOREBODES A DARK FUTURE.  WE DECLARE, HOWEVER, THAT 
JERUSALEM IS AN EVER-BURNING VOLCANO IN WHICH THE 
AMERICAN EMBASSY WILL MELT.  UNTIL THEN, WE HAVE VARIOUS 
POSITIONS.  WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS VIEW OF HIS 
(DUKAKIS) DOES NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE.  THAT IS WHY IT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE 
HOSTAGE ISSUE, OVER WHICH ALL THE SUITABLE CONDITIONS 
FOR A SOLUTION ARE GATHERED. 
 
FINALLY, THE INITIATIVE IS STILL THERE AND EXISTS.  WE 
ARE WAITING FOR RESPONSES, IN THE LIGHT OF WHICH WE WILL 
DECIDE SUBSEQUENT STEPS, ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS 
REQUIRED BY OUR GLORIOUS INTIFADA. 
 
PEACE BE UPON HE WHO SERVES THE TRUTH FOR THE TRUTH. 
 
(SIGNED) ISLAMIC JIHAD FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
ORGANIZATION.

1.  FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF TYPEWRITTEN TEXT 
OF COMMUNIQUE FROM THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION, 
DELIVERED AFTERNOON NOVEMBER 4 TO BEIRUT DAILY NEWSPAPER 
\"AN-NAHAR.\"  COMMUNIQUE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A

IN THE NAME OF GOD THE MERCIFUL, THE COMPASSIONATE 
 
(KORANIC OPENING PHRASE) 
 
TO THE LIBERALS OF THE WORLD 
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO THE FAMILIES OF THE DETAINEES 
 
DAY AFTER DAY THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE ITS DECEPTIONS, LIES AND COMPLETE   MISLEADING 
OF THE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FAMILIES OF THE 
DETAINEES, IN ORDER TO REDUCE ANY ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE THE 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION TO COMMENCE PRACTICAL STEPS TO 
RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF THE DETAINEES AND TO SAFEGUARD ITS 
POSITIONS, PRIVILEGES AND SPECIAL INTERESTS.  AFTER THE 
COMMENTS OF REAGAN AND BUSH ON THE CONTENTS OF THE 
VIDEOTAPE ISSUED BY TERRY ANDERSON, WE WISH TO CLARIFY 
THE FOLLOWING: 
 
1 - THE VIDEOTAPE, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT INCLUDED, WAS 
ISSUED DIRECTLY BY TERRY ANDERSON WITHOUT ANY PRESSURES 
AND AS A RESULT OF WRITTEN AND PHOTOGRAPHED MESSAGES SENT 
TO HIM THORUGH NEW AGENCIES.  THE TAPE WAS ISSUED AFTER A 
SHARP AND LARGE DEBATE BETWEEN US AND HIM CONCERNING ALL 
THE IDEAS HE PRESENTED IN IT, WHICH WE FOUND WERE GREATLY 
INCOMPLETE.  TERRY ANDERSON WILL HAVE A SUITABLE REPLY TO 
THE CLAIMS (OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION - ED.). 
 
2 - AMERICA ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO \"EVADE\" THE CONTENTS OF 
THE TAPE AND LETTERS, WHICH REPRESENT A TRUE REALITY 
WHICH CANNOT BE DEBATED, BY RAISING DOUBTS AS TO THE 
CONTENT OF THE TAPE AND (CLAIMING - ED.) THAT IT WAS 
ISSUED BY THE KIDNAPPERS. 
 
3 - THE DETAINEES IN OUR POSSESSION ARE NOT ISOLATED FROM 
THE EXTERNAL WORLD.  THEY RECEIVE ALL THE NEWS THROUGH 
NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND TELEVISION.  THEY KNOW 
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED OR HAPPENS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR 
SITUATION, BIG OR SMALL.  WHAT REAGAN SAID IN THIS CASE 
IS LIKE THE OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN THE GROUND SO 
THE HUNTERS WILL NOT SEE IT. 
 
4 - THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION, THROUGH ITS PRESIDENT, 
HIS VICE PRESIDENT, STAFF AND ASSISTANTS, MADE ALL THE 
DEALS PERTAINING TO THE ISSUE OF DETAINEES; IF THIS WERE 
NOT SO, WHO ELSE NEGOTIATED THE CASE OF THE TWA 
AIRLINER?  HOW WERE THE FORTY PASSENGERS AND 735 
DETAINEES IN THE PRISONS OF ISRAEL RELEASED?  WHO 
NEGOTIATED THE ISSUE OF \"IRAN-CONTRA?\"  WHO GAVE THE 
ARMS, TOOK THE FUNDS AND TRANSFERRED SOME TO THE 
CONTRAS?  WE WERE SURPRISED THAT REAGAN RECENTLY 
ANNOUNCED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW UNTIL NOW WHO GAVE THE 
ARMS AND WHERE THE FUNDS CAME FROM IN THE \"IRANGATE\" 
ISSUE.  WAS IT NOT THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION?  OR ARE 
THEY ALL ON A FARM WHERE EACH CROWS ON HIS OWN?  IF THEY 
WERE AWARE, IT IS A CATASTROPHE WHICH CANNOT BE DENIED. 
IF THEY WERE UNAWARE, THE CATASTROPHE IS GREATER. 
 
5 - AS FOR CLAIMS THAT THE CEASEFIRE IN THE GULF WILL 
SPEED THE RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES WITH US, WE REITERATE 
FOR THE ONE-THOUSANDTH TIME OUR INSISTENCE THAT THE ISSUE 
OF ALL THE DETAINEES IS UNCONNECTED, IN PART OR IN WHOLE, 
NEAR OR FAR, WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE GULF.  THE 
HOPE WHICH PREVIOUSLY PREVAILED HAS GONE AND CANNOT COME 
BACK.  THE NON-RELEASE OF THE DETAINEES IS NOW DUE TO THE 
AMERICAN SANCTIMONY, FRAUD AND THE FACT THAT PROMISES AND 
GUARANTEES HAVE NOT BEEN FULFILLED. 
 
6 - THE ONLY SAFE WAY FOR THE FREEDOM AND SAFETY OF THE 
DETAINEES IS ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR JUST DEMANDS.  THIS IS 
THE PRINCIPAL FOCAL POINT OF THIS ISSUE; NOTHING ELSE.

2.  ON JUNE 23 (PRIOR TO THE SERIES OF PKK ATTACKS ON 
TURKISH INTERESTS IN EUROPE), THE AMBASSADOR RAISED 
WITH INTERIOR MINISTER BISHARA MIRHIJ THE JUNE 8 OCALAN 
PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE BIQA\' IN WHICH HE EFFECTIVELY 
DECLARED WAR ON TURKEY, INCLUDING TOURIST FACILITIES IN 
TURKEY.  THE AMBASSADOR TOLD MIRHIJ THAT WE HAD 
DELIVERED A DEMARCHE IN DAMASCUS EXPRESSING OUR CONCERN 
OVER THESE STATEMENTS.  WHILE HE HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS TO 
DO THE SAME IN LEBANON, THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE 
LEBANESE GOVERNMENT SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRESENCE 
OF SUCH INDIVIDUALS ON LEBANESE TERRITORY AND ACTIONS 
OF THIS NATURE ARE VERY HARMFUL TO THE LEBANESE EFFORT 
TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT THE 
YEARS OF CHAOS AND CIVIL CONFLICT ARE AT AN END, AND 
THAT LEBANON IS NO LONGER A SANCTUARY FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM. 
 
3.  MIRHIJ READILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT OCALAN\'S 
STATEMENTS HAD BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT 
AND THE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN A RECENT CABINET 
MEETING.  DURING TALKS THE PREVIOUS WEEK WITH HIS 
SYRIAN COUNTERPART ON JOINT EFFORTS TO CONTROL 
SMUGGLING, MIRHIJ SAID THAT HE HAD RAISED OCALAN\'S 
PERFORMANCE, ASKING FOR SYRIA\'S COOPERATION IN ENSURING 
THAT THERE WAS NO REPETITION.  MIRHIJ SAID HE DID NOT 
GET A COMMITMENT, BUT FELT THAT THE SYRIANS WERE ALSO 
TAKEN ABACK BY THE VEHEMENCE OF OCALAN\'S STATEMENTS.

CURTAIN-RAISER 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY:  VIRTUALLY EVERY PROMINENT MARONITE POLITICAN 
IN LEBANON (AND IN PARIS) HOPES TO SUCCEED PRESIDENT 
HRAWI, WHOSE TERM IS SET TO EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 1995. 
FURIOUS JOCKEYING HAS BEGUN, AND A DIZZYING ARRAY OF 
POSSIBLE SCENARIOS EXISTS, BEGINNING WITH AN EXTENSION OF 
HRAWI\'S TERM.  THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS IS WIDELY 
VIEWED AS A KEY DETERMINING FACTOR.  THE LEBANESE 
HISTORICAL REFLEX TO SEEK FOREIGN BACKERS WILL MARK THE 
1995 PROCESS: SYRIA WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER, BUT 
CANDIDATES ARE ALSO SEEKING U.S., FRENCH, SAUDI, AND 
VATICAN SUPPORT.  AS OF NOW, HRAWI, LAF COMMANDER EMILE 
LAHOUD, AND FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. NASSIB LAHOUD 
ARE THE FRONT-RUNNERS.  THE PRINCIPAL USG INTEREST SHOULD 
BE IN URGING THE SELECTION OF A PRESIDENT WITH 
ACROSS-THE-BOARD CREDIBILITY, BUT IN PARTICULAR WHO CAN 
HELP STEER THE MARONITES TOWARD POSITIVE PARTICIPATION IN 
FORMAL POLITICAL LIFE.  SEPTEL REPORT WILL \"HANDICAP\" THE 
MOST PROMINENT CONTENDERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A PRESIDENT IN EVERY MARONITE\'S MIRROR 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE SIX-YEAR TERM OF ILYAS HRAWI IS SLATED TO EXPIRE 
IN NOVEMBER 1995, AT WHICH TIME PARLIAMENT WILL SELECT A 
SUCCESSOR.  SHI\'I NABIH BERRI AND SUNNI RAFIQ HARIRI BOTH 
HOPE ONE DAY TO BE THE FIRST MUSLIM PRESIDENT OF LEBANON, 
BUT NOBODY PREDICTS THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A MARONITE. 
 
4.  THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS IN THE 
MARONITE COMMUNITY.  AT A RECENT SOCIAL EVENT FOR 
PARLIAMENTARIANS, A DRUZE MP ILLUSTRATED THE POINT WHEN HE 
TOASTED \"TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT IN OUR MIDST--ALL SIX OF 
THEM.\"  THE LIST OF MARONITE \"WANNABES\" BRIDGES THE GAP 
BETWEEN THOSE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1992 ELECTIONS AND 
THOSE WHO BOYCOTTED THE PROCESS, AND RUNS THE SPECTRUM 
FROM VIRULENT ANTI-SYRIANS TO THE SHAMELESS SURROGATES OF 
DAMASCUS.  IN ADDITION TO THE SURFEIT OF WOULD-BE LEADERS 
IN THE COUNTRY, SUCH EXILES IN PARIS AS RAYMOND EDDE, 
AMINE GEMAYEL, AND MICHEL AOUN WANT TO EITHER GAIN THE 
PRIZE OR PLAY KINGMAKER. 
 
THE SYRIAN ROLE, AS USUAL, KEY 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  REGIONAL REALITIES AND THE PRESENCE OF A PRO-SYRIAN 
MAJORITY IN THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT ASSURE THAT SYRIA WILL 
HAVE THE DOMINANT VOICE IN THE SELECTION OF A NEW 
PRESIDENT.  TO DATE, THE SARG HAS NOT TIPPED ITS HAND 
ABOUT ITS PREFERENCES.  IN LEBANON, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE 
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION WILL BE CLOSELY TIED TO THE PEACE 
PROCESS, AND THAT THE SARG WILL CALCULATE ITS INTERESTS AS 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL PLAY THEMSELVES OUT. 
 
6.  EVEN THE MARONITES NOW JOCKEYING FOR POSITION BELIEVE 
THAT THE SYRIAN STRATEGY WILL BE TO LET THE CANDIDATES 
STRATCH, JOSTLE, AND ELBOW EACH OTHER TO THE POINT OF 
IMPASSE, AT WHICH POINT \"BIG BROTHER\" WILL STEP IN TO 
\"HELP\" THE LEBANESE SORT OUT THEIR SELF-MADE MESS.  IN THE 
MEANTIME, DAMASCUS WILL HOST A CONSTANT STREAM OF 
CANDIDATES WHO SALLY ACROSS THE BORDER IN HOPE THAT ASAD 
WILL GIVE A FAVORABLE WORD, WINK, OR NOD. 
 
THE U.S. ROLE: DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  IT IS AXIOMATIC AMONG LEBANESE THAT THE USG WILL PLAY 
A KEY ROLE, EITHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, IN THE MAKING OF THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT.  USG DRUTHERS ARE JUDGED TO BE DEPENDENT 
ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. 
PLANS TO \"SELL OUT\" LEBANON FOR THE SAKE OF A 
SYRIAN-ISRAELI PEACE AGREEMENT FEAR THAT THE SARG AND THE 
USG WILL COOPERATE TO CREATE A LEBANESE QUISLING WHO WILL 
FAITHFULLY EXECUTE SYRIAN DIKTAT. 
 
8.  A MORE POSITIVE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT BELIEVES THAT THE 
USG, AT AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT, SHOULD URGE THE SARG TO 
EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE TO GUARANTEE THE SELECTION OF A 
PRESIDENT WHO HAS A DEGREE OF CREDIBILITY ON ALL SIDES. 
THEY HOPE THAT DAMASCUS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD-MINDED 
TO SEE THE NEED FOR A UNIFYING FIGURE, IN PARTICULAR 
SOMEONE WHO CAN LEAD THE MARONITES TOWARD POSITIVE 
PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL POLITICAL LIFE.  SUCH SYRIAN 
ALTRUISM, HOWEVER, WOULD IN THEIR ESTIMATION BE DEPENDENT 
ON A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE PEACE PROCESS. 
 
9.  THE MARONITE HARD CORE HOPES THAT A BREAKDOWN OF THE 
PEACE PROCESS WILL SOMEHOW LEAD THE USG (AND ISRAEL) TO 
SUPPORT A VOCAL OPPONENT OF SYRIA.  THEY HOPE TO MOBILIZE 
MARONITE COMMUNITIES IN THE U.S. TO PRESSURE THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT \"THE LEBANESE POWER OF DECISION\" 
-- WHICH IN THEIR CIRCLES MEANS RESTORING UNRIVALED 
MARONITE DOMINANCE. 
 
OTHER PLAYERS: FRANCE, SAUDI ARABIA, THE VATICAN 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10.  MANY MARONITES ARE HOPING THAT FRANCE WILL INVOLVE 
ITSELF IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE BY URGING SYRIA OR THE USG 
IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION, OR, IN SOME FEVERED IMAGININGS, 
BY RESUMING THE ROLE OF GUARANTOR OF MARONITE POWER. 
THOSE MARONITES WHO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE TO FOGGY BOTTOM 
SEEKING USG BLESSING USUALLY STOP OFF IN PARIS TO 
PRACTICE THEIR PITCH.  THEORIES OF FRENCH PREFERENCES VARY 
WILDLY -- FROM BACKING AOUN AND \"MARONISME\" TO SELLING OUT 
CHRISTIAN INTERESTS FOR THE SAKE OF CEMENTING WIDER FRENCH 
INTERESTS IN THE ARAB WORLD.  IN PARTICULAR, MANY 
MARONITES FEAR THE WARM RELATIONS BETWEEN JACQUES CHIRAC 
AND SUNNI PRIME MINISTER HARIRI. 
 
11.  SAUDI ARABIA IS ALSO SEEN AS HAVING A ROLE TO PLAY, 
BUILDING ON ITS EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH HARIRI.  SOME 
SPECULATE THAT RIYADH WILL POUR MONEY INTO LEBANON -- OR 
EVEN SYRIA -- TO SUPPORT HARIRI\'S FAVORITE MARONITE, OR 
THAT, CONVERSELY, HARIRI WILL BE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS WHOM 
TO SUPPORT.  MOREOVER, ONE PROMINENT CANDIDATE, NASSIB 
LAHOUD, HAS INDEPENDENT TIES TO RIYADH (SEPTEL).  SOME 
EXPECT THE USG TO URGE THE SAUDIS TO SUPPORT ITS FAVORED 
CANDIDATE. 
 
12.  PUNDITS EXPECT THAT THE VATICAN, THROUGH THE 
INFLUENCE IT MIGHT EXERCISE ON THE MARONITE PATRIARCH AND 
THUS HIS CHURCH, WILL INVOLVE ITSELF DEEPLY.  THEY SEE THE 
ELEVATION OF PATRIARCH SFAYR TO CARDINAL AS A SIGN OF 
VATICAN INTEREST IN GUARDING CHRISTIAN \"RIGHTS.\"  THE HARD 
CORE HOPES THAT THE POPE WILL PRESSURE THE USG AND FRANCE 
TO SUPPORT A \"NATIONALIST\"; MODERATES HOPE THAT THE 
VATICAN WILL STRONGLY URGE MARONITES TO PARTICIPATE IN 
POLITICAL LIFE; SOME BELIEVE THAT PAPAL NUNCIO PUENTE\'S 
ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH HIZBALLAH LEADER FADLALLAH WILL HELP 
PRODUCE A PRESIDENT WITH BROAD CREDIBILITY.  PUENTE SAYS 
THAT, HEALTH PERMITTING, THE POPE WILL VISIT LEBANON IF A 
PEACE AGREEMENT IS REACHED: IF THE VISIT HAPPENS, LOCAL 
EARS WILL BE KEEN TO SIGNALS OF A VATICAN PRESIDENTIAL 
PREFERENCE. 
 
THE MUSLIM CONTRIBUTION 
----------------------- 
 
13.  MOST PRESIDENTIAL MANEUVERING, OF COURSE, IS A 
STRICTLY MARONITE GAME.  MUSLIMS--SHIA, SUNNI, AND 
DRUZE--ARE RELEGATED TO SECONDARY ROLES:  EITHER TO BE THE 
GREEK CHORUS IN PARLIAMENT TO ECHO THE WISDOM RECEIVED 
FROM DAMASCUS, AND/OR TO STRIKE DEALS WITH MARONITE 
HOPEFULS TO OBTAIN THE POSITIONS TO WHICH MUSLIMS AT THIS 
POINT CAN ASPIRE.  MUSLIM LEADERS ALREADY HAVE BEGUN 
CAUTIOUSLY TO ALIGN THEMSELVES, AS OFTEN AGAINST AS FOR A 
PARTICULAR MARONITE.  UNTIL NOW, THE HIZBALLAH SHI\'A HAVE 
NOT DISCUSSED THE RACE OPENLY: INSTEAD, THEY ARE 
PREOCCUPIED WITH WHAT SYRIA, AND PERHAPS IRAN, HAVE IN 
STORE FOR THEM AFTER PEACE WITH ISRAEL. 
 
EXTENSION FOR HRAWI? 
-------------------- 
 
14.  IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION OF 
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW PRESIDENT 
HRAWI TO EXTEND HIS TERM BY PERHAPS TWO YEARS.  DESPITE 
PUBLIC DISAVOWAL OF THE IDEA, HRAWI IS WORKING TOWARD THIS 
GOAL BEHIND THE SCENES.  HE APPARENTLY WANTS TO BE SEEN AS 
THE PRESIDENT WHO TOOK OFFICE IN THE MIDST OF TURMOIL, 
THEN PRESIDED OVER A PERIOD IN WHICH LEBANON ENDED ITS 
CIVIL WAR, MADE PEACE WITH ISRAEL, THEN PUT ITSELF ON THE 
PATH TO ECONOMIC REVIVAL.  WE HAVE ALSO DETECTED WHAT MAY 
BE A NASCENT EFFORT BY HRAWI TO BOOST HIS DOMESTIC 
CREDIBILITY BY PUTTING A BIT OF DAYLIGHT BETWEEN HIMSELF 
AND DAMASCUS. 
 
15.  THE LEBANESE SAY THAT THE SYRIANS HAVE SENT 
CONFLICTING SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF EXTENSION, AND THAT 
THE ISSUE MAY DEPEND ON THE FATE OF THE PEACE PROCESS. 
THE THINKING IS THAT, IF THE PROCESS STALLS, HRAWI WOULD 
REMAIN IN OFFICE, AND THE QUESTION OF THE PRESIDENCY, LIKE 
SO MANY OTHER ISSUES, WOULD REMAIN BLOCKED UNTIL THE SHAPE 
OF REGIONAL POLITICS BECAME CLEAR. 
 
16.  THERE ARE CONFLICTING REPORTS ON HOW PM HARIRI, 
SPEAKER BERRI, AND OTHER GOL FIGURES VIEW AN EXTENSION OF 
HRAWI.  HARIRI AND BERRI DISLIKE HRAWI, BUT FEAR THAT A 
NEW, STRONGER PRESIDENT COULD JEOPARDIZE THE PREROGATIVES 
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARVE OUT.  PREDICTABLY, TO THE 
EXTENT THAT AN EXTENSION OF HRAWI WOULD ALSO HELP FREEZE 
THEM IN PLACE, THE IDEA IS ATTRACTIVE.  IN THE ULTIMATE 
ANALYSIS, THEY WILL WAIT FOR SYRIA\'S DEFINITIVE SIGNAL ON 
THE ISSUE. 
 
17.  INTERESTINGLY, THERE ARE VIRULENT OPPONENTS OF BOTH 
HRAWI AND SYRIA WHO SUPPORT AN EXTENSION.  THEIR THINKING 
IS THAT THE ENEMIES OF SYRIA SHOULD CONCENTRATE THEIR 
EFFORTS ON THE 1996 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, SEEKING 
INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS AND GUARANTEES.  THE NEW, 
PRESUMABLY LESS SYRIAN-INFLUENCED PARLIAMENT WOULD THEN 
ELECT A PRESIDENT UNDER LESS SYRIAN SWAY. 
 
THE USG INTEREST 
---------------- 
 
18.  THE USG\'S VERY ACTIVE, UNSUCCESSFUL SUPPORT IN 1988 
FOR MIKHAEL DAHER PROVIDES A CAUTIONARY LESSON FOR THE 
1995 PRESIDENTIAL SELECTION PROCESS.  ACTIVE USG BACKING 
FOR A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE WOULD PROBABLY SET IN MOTION A 
SERIES OF REACTIONS THAT WOULD DAMAGE THE CHANCES OF 
\"AMERICA\'S CHOICE.\"  THAT SAID, IT WOULD BE ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE USG TO KEEP SILENT ABOUT THE SELECTION 
PROCESS: IF EXTENSION OF HRAWI REMAINS A LIVE ISSUE, WE 
WILL BE ASKED AT LEAST FOR COMMENT.  IF A NEW PRESIDENT IS 
TO BE CHOSEN, WE WILL BE ASKED FOR OUR INPUT EVERY STEP OF 
THE WAY.  PRESUMABLY, AT A MINIMUM, WE WOULD LIKE TO 
ASSURE THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT IS NOT HOSTILE TO USG 
INTERESTS. 
 
19.  UP TO THIS POINT, EMBASSY HAS ANSWERED INQUIRIES BY 
AVOIDING NAMES AND SAYING THAT WE HOPE A NEW PRESIDENT 
WILL FIT A CERTAIN PROFILE:  HE/SHE SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO 
FINDING WAYS TO RECONCILE THE VARIOUS LEBANESE COMMUNITIES 
WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE NEEDS OF THE COMING ERA OF 
PEACE.  HE/SHE SHOULD HAVE CREDIBILITY WITH ALL SIDES, AND 
IN THIS SENSE SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS OVERLY TIED TO ANY 
FOREIGN SPONSOR.  HE/SHE SHOULD ALSO VIEW AS A PRINCIPAL 
TASK ENCOURAGING THE MARONITES TOWARD MORE ACTIVE, 
POSITIVE PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL LEBANESE POLITICAL LIFE. 
IF THE TREND TOWARD CHRISTIAN NON-PARTICIPATION CONTINUES 
OR DEEPENS, THE PROSPECTS FOR INTERNAL RECONCILIATION AND 
STABILITY--WITHIN AND PERHAPS EVEN BEYOND LEBANON\'S 
BORDERS--ARE POOR.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY AND COMMENT.  PM HARIRI, SPEAKER BIRRI, 
AND SHI\'A SPIRITUAL LEADER SHAMS AD-DIN MET JULY 11 
AND RESOLVED DIFFERENCES OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF TWO 
SHI\'A-RESERVED SEATS ON THE BOARD OF THE SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME, ELYSSAR.  A HIZBALLAH 
AND BIRRI MAN WILL TAKE THE TWO SEATS, AND FADLALLAH 
AND SHAMS AD-DIN EACH WILL WITHDRAW HIS CANDIDATE. 
THIS DECISION -- STILL TO BE RATIFIED BY THE CABINET 
ON JULY 13 -- COMPLETES THE YEARS-LONG TRANSFORMATION 
OF HIZBALLAH\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD HARIRI\'S SWEEPING 
DEVELOPMENT PLANS IN THE SUBURBS FROM OPEN HOSTILITY 
TO ACCOMMODATION.  WHILE THE NATURE OF THIS ODD AND 
LIMITED ALLIANCE OF HARIRI AND HIZBALLAH WILL TAKE 
TIME TO CLARIFY, HIZBALLAH\'S DECISION TO JOIN THE 
BOARD SUGGESTS A REALIZATION THAT IN FUTURE IT CAN 
WORK WITH, NOT AGAINST THE STATE TO RETAIN ITS GAINS 
IN THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
3.  PM RAFIQ HARIRI, PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER NABIH 
BERRI, AND SHI\'A SPIRITUAL LEADER MUHAMMAD MAHDI 
SHAMS AD-DIN GATHERED LATE JULY 11.  THEY TOLD THE 
PRESS THAT THE TALKS CENTERED ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
SOUTH.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO MUHAMMAD SAMMAK, A KEY 
AIDE TO HARIRI AND CONFIDANT OF SHAMS AD-DIN, THE 
REAL TOPIC WAS A DISPUTE OVER ELYSSAR, THE 
CORPORATION BEING FORMED TO DEVELOP PARTS OF THE 
SOUTHERN SUBURBS. 
 
4.  THE DISPUTE INVOLVED THE NOMINATION OF FOUR 
CANDIDATES FOR TWO RESERVED SHI\'A SEATS ON THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS.  BERRI, SHAMS AD-DIN, HIZBALLAH 
SPIRITUAL GUIDE MUHAMMAD HUSAYN FADLALLAH, AND 
HIZBALLAH EACH PROPOSED A NAME.  AFTER LENGTHY 
GRIDLOCK, FADLALLAH AND HIZBALLAH AGREED THIS WEEK TO 
PROPOSE A SINGLE CANDIDATE (THAT THEY TOOK SO LONG TO 
AGREE REFLECTS THE DIVISION BETWEEN FADLALLAH AND THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY).  ON THE LLTH, SHAMS AD-DIN 
AGREED TO WITHDRAW HIS PREFERRED CANDIDATE IN FAVOR 
OF BERRI\'S. 
 
5.  THERE WAS LITTLE APPARENT CONTROVERSY OVER THE 
OTHER SEATS, WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR TWO SUNNIS, ONE 
MARONITE, AND ONE GREEK CATHOLIC.  THE CABINET IS 
EXPECTED TO APPROVE THE RESULTS OF HARIRI\'S BACK-ROOM 
NEGOTIATIONS ON JULY 13. 
 
6.  THESE DEVELOPMENTS REFLECT A MARKED 
TRANSFORMATION IN THE ATTITUDES OF HARIRI AND 
HIZBALLAH TO EACH OTHER, AND IN HIZBALLAH\'S VIEW OF 
THE FUTURE.  WHEN IN THE WINTER OF 1992 HARIRI FIRST 
UNVEILED THE ELYSSAR CONCEPT -- MODELED ON THE 
EQUALLY CONTROVERSIAL SOLIDERE COMPANY SET UP TO 
REDEVELOP DOWNTOWN BEIRUT -- HIZBALLAH RAISED 
STRIDENT OBJECTIONS IN THE STREETS, MOSQUES, AND 
PARLIAMENT. 
 
7.  THE PARTY WHIPPED UP A FRENZY BY REMINDING ITS 
AUDIENCE OF AMIN GEMAYEL\'S ATTEMPTS IN THE 80\'S TO 
BULLDOZE THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS AND DISPLACE ITS 
CITIZENRY UNDER THE GUISE OF REDEVELOPMENT. 
HIZBALLAH PREYED ON THIS POPULAR FEAR AMONG THE SHI\'A 
IN AN OBVIOUS PLOY TO KEEP THE STATE OUT OF THE 
SUBURBS, SO HIZBALLAH COULD REMAIN THE SOLE PROVIDER 
OF SERVICE AND SECURITY. 
 
8.  HARIRI, FOR HIS PART, WAS JUST AS DETERMINED TO 
CHALLENGE HIZBALLAH THROUGH HIS MASSIVE REAL ESTATE 
DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES, WHICH INTEND TO HARNESS PRIVATE 
CAPITAL TO THE DAUNTING TASK OF REBUILDING GREATER 
BEIRUT.  PARALYSIS RESULTED FROM THIS STANDOFF. 
 
9.  IN THE SUMMER OF 1995, HOWEVER, CHANGED 
CIRCUMSTANCES BORE FRUIT.  IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
HIZBALLAH, HARIRI AGREED THAT THE THOUSANDS OF 
SQUATTERS NOW SETTLED IN THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT 
ZONE -- HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS, FOR THE MOST PART -- 
WOULD BE PERMITTED TO STAY PUT, AND THAT ELYSSAR 
WOULD REPLACE THEIR RAMSHACKLE HOUSING WITH NEW 
APARTMENTS IN KEEPING WITH THE RESORT-TOWN LOOK 
ENVISIONED BY ALYSSAR FOR THE ZONE.  THIS REMOVED THE 
PARTY\'S RALLYING CRY AGAINST THE SCHEME. 
 
10.  WIDER POLITICAL CALCULATIONS, HOWEVER, PROBABLY 
ACCOUNT FOR THE PARTY\'S WILLINGNESS TO JOIN TOGETHER 
WITH HARIRI IN DEVELOPING ONE OF ITS STRONGHOLDS. 
THE DECISION IS IN KEEPING WITH A PRAGMATIC CURRENT 
WITHIN THE PARTY WHICH WANTS TO READY HIZBALLAH FOR 
THE TRANSFORMATION FROM A MILITIA WHICH CHALLENGES 
THE STATE TO A SERVICE-ORIENTED PARTY WITH A PLACE 
INSIDE LEGITIMATE POLITICS.  IN SIGNING UP WITH 
ELYSSAR, HIZBALLAH MAY ALSO HAVE RECOGNIZED THE VALUE 
OF ASSOCIATION WITH THE NEXT LARGE SOURCE OF 
INVESTMENT IN THE SUBURBS, ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE 
IRANIAN CASH FLOW WHICH SUPPORTS HIZBALLAH\'S SERVICE 
ACTIVITIES IN THE SUBURBS MAY SOON DIMINISH.  HARIRI 
GAINS THE SUPPORT OF THE MOST VOCAL ELEMENT IN THE 
SUBURBS, AND THUS PEACE FOR HIS LUCRATIVE PLAN. 
 

11.  THIS MUTUAL COZYING UP BY HARIRI AND HIZBALLAH 
COMES CHIEFLY AT THE EXPENSE OF SHI\'A SPIRITUAL 
LEADER SHAMS AD-DIN.  WHILE SHAMS AD-DIN -- THE 
SUCCESSOR OF IMAM MUSA SADR AS HEAD OF THE HIGHER 
ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL (HISC) -- WOULD BE THE STATE\'S 
NATURAL ALLY IN SHI\'A AFFAIRS, HIS SIMULTANEOUS FEUDS 
WITH BERRI AND HIZBALLAH PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE. 
HE ALSO LACKS HIZBALLAH\'S MUSCLE IN THE SUBURBS, SO 
DOES NOT NEED TO BE ACCOMMODATED.  IN THE LONG RUN, 
HOWEVER, THE SIDELINING OF SHAMS AD-DIN CAN ONLY 
ENCOURAGE A FURTHER RADICALIZATION OF SHI\'A POLITICS, 
DOMINATED BY THE MILITIA-TYPE NETWORKS OF BERRI AND 
HIZBALLAH.

ITS TWO TOP LEADERS AND SOME MODEST STRUCTURAL 
CHANGES, BUT HAS NOT RELEASED NAMES OF NEW 
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL MEMBERS, OSTENSIBLY ON SECURITY 
GROUNDS.  A SENIOR AMAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMED HIS 
PARTY\'S UNDERSTANDING THAT HIZBALLAH ULTRA-EXTREMIST 
SUBHI TUFAYLI IS OUT.  THE AMAL SOURCE SAID THE 
CHANGE CAME AMIDST A WIDER SHIFT IN POWER WITHIN 
HIZBALLAH, AWAY FROM BIQA\' VALLEY CADRES TOWARD 
SOUTHERN LEADERS.  WHILE THE CHANGES WITHIN HIZBALLAH 
ARE SEEN HERE AS FURTHER STEPS PREPARATORY TO AN 
EVENTUAL TRANSITION FROM MILITIA TO LEGITIMATE 
POLITICAL PARTY, AMAL BELIEVES (OR AT LEAST HOPES) 
THAT HIZBALLAH IS MISTAKEN IN ITS CONFIDENCE OF 
SYRIAN BACKING FOR ITS POLITICAL AMBITIONS IN AN ERA

3.  HIZBALLAH HAS ANNOUNCED THE RE-ELECTION OF 
SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH AND DEPUTY SECGEN 
NA\'IM QASSIM AT A GENERAL CONVENTION EARLIER THIS 
MONTH, BUT WILL NOT RELEASE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE 
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL (MAJLIS ASH-SHURA).  A PARTY 
SPOKESMAN CITED THE ISRAELI THREAT AS REASON FOR 
SECRECY.  THERE WAS NO WORD ON WHETHER NASRALLAH HAS 
RETURNED FROM IRAN, WHERE HE WAS PRESUMABLY VETTING 
THE CONVENTION RESULTS. 
 
4.  MUHAMMAD \'UBAYD, POLITICAL ADVISOR FOR AMAL 
MOVEMENT AND SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE INFORMATION 
MINISTRY, CONFIRMED TO US THAT SUBHI TUFAYLI, FORMER 
PARTY SECGEN AND A RECOGNIZED LEADER OF THE MOST 
RADICAL TREND IN HIZBALLAH, DID NOT WIN RE-ELECTION 
TO THE COUNCIL.  \'UBAYD SAW TUFAYLI\'S OUSTER AS PART 
OF A TREND AT THE CONVENTION TO EASE OUT BIQA\' VALLEY 
ELEMENTS IN FAVOR OF SOUTHERNERS (THE HOME BASE OF 
NA S RALLAH ) . 
 
5.  THE BIQA\'-SOUTH FAULT LINE COINCIDES GENERALLY 
WITH A (COMPARATIVE) HAWK-DOVE SPLIT INSIDE THE 
PARTY.  HIZBALLAH HAS A STRONGER BASE IN THE BIQA\' 
AND AMONG SOUTHERN SUBURB RESIDENTS ORIGINALLY FROM 
THE BIQA\', THAN IT DOES IN THE SOUTH, WHERE POLITICAL 
LOYALITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO REST WITH AMAL AND THE 
OLD LANDED FAMILIES.  HIZBALLAH HAS WORKED TO MAKE 
IN-ROADS THERE, BUT THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE 
RESISTANCE IN MANY QUARTERS ALONG THE FRONT LINES HAS 
UNDERMINED THOSE EFFORTS. 
 
6.  CONSOLIDATION OF HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP IN SOUTHERN 
HANDS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THOSE 
FORCES WITHIN THE PARTY WHO ARE BRACED FOR AN END TO 
MILITIA ACTIVITIES, AND WANT TO PREPARE FOR MORE 
NORMAL POLITICAL ACTIVISM.  AMAL OFFICIAL \'UBAYD 
CLAIMED TO US, HOWEVER, THAT HIZBALLAH\'S MAINSTREAM 
HAS OVER-ESTIMATED SYRIAN WILLINGNESS TO PROTECT THE 
PARTY ONCE PEACE WITH ISRAEL IS REACHED.  COMMENT: 
THIS OBSERVATION COULD BE WISHFUL THINKING ON THE 
PART OF AMAL, WHICH IS STRUGGLING WITH HIZBALLAH FOR 
SHI\'A LOYALTIES.  IF DAMASCUS IS TRUE TO FORM, IT 
WOULD MOST LIKELY NOURISH BUT CONFINE HIZBALLAH, AS A 
TOOL TO KEEP SYRIA\'S PRINCIPAL SHI\'A ALLY, NABIH 
BERRI, IN LINE.  END COMMENT. 
 
7.  REF A CONVEYS OTHER DETAILS ON CHANGES MADE 
WITHIN HIZBALLAH, AS REPORTED BY IBRAHIM AL-AMIN IN 
\"AL-SAFIR\" NEWSPAPER.  IN SHORT, TYRE-BASED HIZBALLAH 
MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT MUHAMMAD RA\'D BECAME HEAD OF THE 
POLITICAL COUNCIL (THE RENAMED POLITBURO), BUMPING 
OUT HUSSEIN KHALIL.  KHALIL WAS NAMED POLITICAL 
ADVISOR TO NASRALLAH, IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE A 
COME-DOWN.  A JIHADI COUNCIL WAS MADE TO CONSOLIDATE 
CONTROL OVER ALL SECURITY AND MILITARY OPERATIONS, 
UNDER SOUTHERNER HASHIM SAFI-AD-DIN.  THE BLOC OF 
HIZBALLAH MPS GAINED A MORE FORMAL ROLE WITHIN THE 
PARTY WITH THE CREATION OF THE \"COUNCIL OF THE 
PARLIAMENTARY BLOC.\"  A LEBANESE REPRESENTATIVE OF 
AL-KHAMEIN\'I, THE BIQA\'-BASED MUHAMMAD YAZBEK, 
RETAINED A PLACE IN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE 
CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL. 
 
8. FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, PAPERS ALSO REPORT TRENDS 
WHICH SUGGEST BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR HIZBALLAH:  THE 
OFTEN INACCURATE DAILY \"NIDA\' AL-WATAN\" REPORTED THE 
RE-ELECTION OF IMAD MUGHNIYAH AS THE CENTRAL SECURITY 
CHIEF, WITH FOUR ASSISTANTS NAMED MUSTAFA BADR 
AD-DIN, TALAL HAMIYAH, HAJ MUHAMMAD AHMAZ, AND 
HUSAYNI ATRYSSI.  THE MORE RESPECTED \"AN-NAHAR\" 
REPORTS THAT HIZBALLAH HAS RECEIVED MORE 
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS FOR USE AGAINST THE ISRAELIS, 
BUT OFFERS NO FURTHER CLARIFICATION.

SUBJECT:  QADHAFI THREAT TO EXPEL PALESTINIANS 
STOKES LEBANESE PARANOIA RE \"IMPLANTATION\" 
 
1. (U) LIBYAN LEADER QADHAFI\'S THREAT TO EXPEL A 
REPORTED 50,000 PALESTINIAN WORKERS FROM LIBYA 
HAS PRODUCED LOCAL REPORTS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE 
OR WILL BE COMING TO LEBANON.  ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS, FATAH DISSIDENT MUNIR AL-MUQDAH 
HAS CLAIMED THAT 2,000 SUCH REFUGEES ALREADY 
HAVE RETURNED, MOSTLY TO CAMPS IN THE SOUTH. 
AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, WHOSE LOCAL OFFICE IS 
OFTEN SENSATIONAL AND UNRELIABLE, PUTS THE 
NUMBER AT ONLY 400. 
 
2. (U)  WHATEVER THE TRUE NUMBERS OF 
PALESTINIANS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE TRICKLED 
BACK FROM LIBYA IN RECENT WEEKS, THE GOL IS 
SENDING SIGNALS THAT IT WILL NOT BE, IN THE TERM 
USED IN LOCAL NEWSPAPERS, THE \"DUMPING GROUND\" 
FOR PALESTINIANS EXPELLED FROM OTHER REGIONAL 
STATES.  THUS THE GOL HAS REPORTEDLY ISSUED 
ORDERS TO PORT AUTHORITIES TO DENY ENTRY TO 
SHIPS CARRYING PALESTINIANS FROM LIBYA. 
ACCORDING TO VAGUE RUMORS--A STAPLE OF THE LOCAL 
POLITICAL DIET--FOUR SHIPS CARRYING PALESTINIANS 
HAVE DEPARTED TRIPOLI HEADED TOWARD LEBANON. 
OTHER REPORTS SAY THAT FM BUWAYZ TOOK A TOUGH 
LINE ON THE ISSUE WITH VISITING PLO POLITICAL 
DIRECTOR FAROUQ QADDOUMI IN THEIR SEPTEMBER 5 
MEETING. 
 
3.  (C) COMMENT:  THE GOL IS SEEKING TO SEND OUT 
SIGNALS OF \"TOUGHNESS\" ON THESE REPORTS, BUT IT 
IS UNCLEAR TO US HOW IT COULD OR WOULD STOP THE 
RETURN OF POSSIBLE MIGRANTS WHO HOLD VALID 
LEBANESE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS.  FOR PALESTINIANS 
WITHOUT SUCH DOCUMENTS, HOWEVER, WE ARE SURE 
THAT--UNLESS SYRIA ORDERED OTHERWISE--THE GOL 
WOULD DENY ENTRY (AS WITH THE HAMAS ACTIVITS 
EXPELLED BY ISRAEL IN 1992, WHO WERE ISOLATED TO 
A MAKESHIFT CAMP AT MARJ AL-ZAHOUR IN THE SOUTH). 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  AS PREVIOUS 
REPORTING HAS DETAILED, IF THERE IS ONE ISSUE 
THAT CAN FORGE SOMETHING APPROACHING A NATIONAL 
CONSENSUS IN FRACTIOUS LEBANON, IT IS A NEGATIVE 
ATTITUDE TOWARD RESETTLEMENT OF PALESTINIANS ON 
LOCAL SOIL.  THE ISSUE, WITH ITS THREAT OF 
DISTURBING THE TENUOUS SECTARIAN BALANCE AS IT 
HELPED DO IN 1975, EVOKES DEEP FEAR AND STRONG 
EMOTION.  ESPECIALLY IN A POLITICAL SEASON WHEN 
PRESIDENT HRAWI AVIDLY IS CURRYING MARONITE 
FAVOR AND SHI\'A SPEAKER BIRRI IS TRYING TO 
ASSERT HIS POWER AGAINST SUNNI PM HARIRI AND HIS 
HIZBALLAH RIVALS, WE CAN EXPECT A HARD GOL LINE 
ON ANY PALESTINIAN SETTLEMENT ISSUE THAT MIGHT 
ARISE.  END COMMENT. 
 
5.  (C) EMBASSY IS DISCREETLY FOLLOWING UP WITH 
LOCAL UNRWA CONTACTS TO SEE IF WE CAN SEPARATE 
FACT FROM FEARFUL FANTASY.

1.  CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL BY RONALD SCHLICHER, 
CHARGE.  REASONS 1.5 B AND D. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  PRESIDENT HRAWI, CITING PEACE 
PROCESS AND OTHER REASONS, HAS DECIDED AGAINST 
ALLOWING THE LAF TO ENTER \'AYN AL-HILWEH REFUGEE 
CAMP TO ARREST THE FUGITIVE LEADER OF THE 
RECENTLY DISCOVERED SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST 
MOVEMENT (REFTEL).  INFORMATION LEAKED FROM THE 
INVESTIGATION HAS SPECIFICALLY ACCUSED SUDAN AND 
OSAMA BIN LADEN OF TRAINING AND FINANCING THE 
GROUP.  MURKY INFO SUGGESTS THAT THERE MAY BE A 
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ORGANIZATION AND A 
SPLINTER GROUP OF THE ANO.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
\"ABU MUHJEN\" IN \'AYN AL-HILWEH, LAF AT GATES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) AHMED \'ABD AL-KARIM AL-SA\'ADI (\"ABU 
MUHJEN\"), THE LEADER OF THE LEBANESE-PALESITNIAN 
SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP (WHICH CALLS ITSELF 
\"\'ASBAT AL-ANSAR\") ACCUSED OF MURDERING 
\"AL-AHBASH\" LEADER NIZAR AL-HALABI AND OF 
PLOTTING TO MURDER OTHER LEBANESE AND SYRIAN 
PERSONALITIES, IS CURRENTLY IN SIDON\'S \'AYN 
AL-HILWEH REFUGEE CAMP.  INDEED, ON THE DAY 
FOLLOWING THE ARREST OF MOST MEMBERS OF HIS 
GROUP, ABU MUHJEN GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO 
\"AL-SAFIR\" NEWSPAPER. 
 
4.  (U) HE DENIED INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER AND 
PLOTTING, DESPITE HIS COMRADES\' TELEVISED 
CONFESSIONS AND RE-ENACTMENT OF THE 
ASSASSINATION.  HE ALSO DENIED ANY FOREIGN 
FUNDING OF HIS GROUP, AND HINTED DARKLY THAT HIS 
PROBLEMS WERE SOMEHOW A ZIONIST PLOT. 
 
5.  (C) THE LAF, WANTING TO CAP ITS SUCCESSFUL 
ROUND-UP OF THE GROUP VIA THE ARREST OF ABU 
MUHJEN, IS DEPLOYED AROUND \'AYN AL-HILWEH, AND 
REPORTEDLY SEARCHING ALL WHO ENTER AND EXIT. 
LAF COMMANDER LAHOUD ASKED PRESIDENT HRAWI FOR 
PERMISSION TO ENTER THE CAMP, BUT HRAWI TOLD 
CHARGE THAT HE HAS DECIDED NOT TO GIVE 
PERMISSION. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
HRAWI: TIMIMG WRONG FOR LAF TO ENTER CAMPS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) HRAWI SAID THAT AN OPERATION INSIDE THE 
CAMP WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE CASUALTIES AMONG THE 
INNOCENT OCCUPANTS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND 
CHILDREN.  HE ALSO ADDED THAT THE CURRENT 
DELICACY OF PEACE-PROCESS POLITICS DID NOT NEED 
THE POSSIBLE DISRUPTION THAT COULD BE ENGENDERED 
BY AN OPERATION GONE WRONG.  AND, ULTIMATELY, 
ADDED HRAWI, THE LAF NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE ON 
PLANS FOR EVENTUAL DEPLOYMENT TO THE BORDER 
INSTEAD OF ON THE REFUGEE CAMPS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
REPORTED SUDANESE AND BIN LADEN LINKS NOW PUBLIC 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
7.  (C) REFTEL NOTED INFO THAT SAUDI FINANCIER 
OF TERROR OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS 
THE BANKROLLER OF THE GROUP.  ON DEC. 27, LIKELY 
LAF SOURCES LEAKED TO THE MEDIA THAT THE LAF, IN 
HANDING OVER THE FILES TO THE CIVIL PROSECUTORS, 
HAD UNCOVERED EVIDENCE OF BIN LADEN\'S 
INVOLVEMENT, ALONG WITH EVIDENCE THAT \"SUDANESE 
OFFICERS\" HAD TRAINED THE GROUP\'S MEMBERS (WHO, 
WHEN, AND WHERE WERE NOT MENTIONED). 
 
8. (C) THE SUDANESE EMBASSY (NOTABLY OMITTING 
ANY REFERENCE TO REPORTED KHARTOUM RESIDENT BIN 
LADEN) HAS PUBLICLY DENIED ANY CONNECTION 
BETWEEN SUDAN AND THE GROUP, AND IS SUGGESTING 
PRIVATELY THAT EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR ADEL 
AL-KHUDARI IS SPREADING LIES ABOUT SUDAN AS PART 
OF THE ONGOING BILATERAL PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES. 
 
------------- 
AN ANO LINK? 
------------- 
 
9.  (C) IN REF B WE NOTED THAT, IN THE WAKE OF 
AL-HALABI\'S MURDER, AN APPARENT ANO SPLINTER 
GROUP ACCUSED ABU NIDAL OF ORDERING THE HIT.  WE 
HAVE SEEN NO PROOF, BUT ARE HEARING RUMORS FROM 
THE NORTH (FROM THE SOURCES THAT TIPPED US ON 
THE BIN LADEN CONNECTION) THAT THE ARRESTED 
GROUP MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DEC. 8 
MURDER IN TRIPOLI OF ANO FINANCIAL OFFICIAL 
MUSTAFA \'ATTOUR, WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN IN MUCH THE 
SAME FASHION AS AL-HALABI. 
 
10.  (C) AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE OTHER 
RUMORS, AGAIN WITH NO PROOF OFFERED, THAT ABU 
MUHJEN WORKS FOR PLO DISSIDENT MUNIR AL-MUQDAH, 
WHO CURRENTLY IS THE STRONG MAN IN \'AYN 
AL-HILWEH. 
 
11. (C) COMMENT: WE WILL WATCH CAREFULLY FOR 
CLARIFYING INFORMATION, BUT NOTE THAT, IN THE 
HOTHOUSE REJECTIONIST POLITICS OF \'AYN 
AL-HILWEH, VIRTUALLY ANY COMBINATION OF 
LOYALTIES AND ALLEGIANCES IS POSSIBLE.

SUBJECT:  EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA: ARE THERE ANY AMERICAN 
INTENTIONS TO ACCUSE LIBYA, IRAN, OR ISLAMIC RADICALS? 
 
---------- 
1. SUMMARY 
---------- 
 
THE TWO EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED ON THE FRONT-PAGE OF 
EVERY NEWSPAPER IN LEBANON.  MOST REPORTED THE EVENT 
WITH NO EDITORIALIST REACTION.  THE ONLY TWO 
EDITORIALS THAT WERE WRITTEN WERE CONTRADICTORY. 
JOSEPH SAMAHA OF ARAB NATIONALIST DAILY AS-SAFIR 
WARNED THAT \"BEING AN ENEMY TO THE US IS ONE THING AND 
PLANNING TERRORIST ATTACKS IS ANOTHER.\"  HE ADDED, 
\"WHOEVER PLANNED THESE ATTACKS MADE A BIG MISTAKE\". 
SYRIA\'S MOUTHPIECE IN LEBANON \'ASH-SHARQ\', HOWEVER, 
RIDICULED THE AMERICAN STATEMENT ON HAVING SOME IDEAS 
ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
EXPLOSIONS.  ASH-SHARQ ACCUSED THE US OF INTENDING TO 
IMPLICATE AN ARAB COUNTRY OR ARAB ISLAMISTS.  IT 
CONCLUDED THAT THE REAL ATTACKER IS THE CIA AND THE 
JEWISH LOBBY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
2.  HEADLINES: 
-------------- 
 
\"TERRORISM TERRORIZES AMERICA IN THE HEART OF AFRICA\" 
(ARAB AFFAIRS ASH-SHARQ AL-AWSAT HEADLINE) 
 
\"WASHINGTON HAS SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE IDENTITY OF THE 
TERRORISTS AND KENYA ARRESTED A SUSPECT IN ARAB 
CLOTHES\" (PRO-SUNNI AL-LIWA\' HEADLINE) 
 
\"UNKNOWN ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR EXPLOSIONS\" (ARAB AFFAIRS AL-HAYAT HEADLINE) 
 
\"WHO HIT AMERICAN TARGETS?\" (SENSATIONALIST AD-DIYAR 
HEADLINE) 
 
----------------------------- 
3.  EXCERPTS FROM EDITORIALS: 
----------------------------- 
 
\"WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA\" A FRONT- 
PAGE EDITORIAL BY AWNI AL-KA\'KI IN SYRIA\'S MOUTHPIECE 
PRO-BA\'TH DAILY \'ASH-SHARQ\' (08/8):\"IT IS TOO EARLY TO 
DETERMINE THE IDENTITY OF PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA.  HOWEVER, A FEW HOURS FOLLOWING 
THE EXPLOSIONS, THE US ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS SOME IDEA 
ABOUT WHO DID IT.  HOW DID THE US GET ITS IDEAS SO 
FAST?  THIS AMERICAN STATEMENT CARRIES DANGEROUS 
INDICATIONS.  IT MEANS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE INTENDS TO 
ACCUSE SOMEBODY, MOST PROBABLY AN ARAB STATE. 
WHAT IS THE US PLANNING TO DO?  PERHAPS IT INTENDS TO 
ACCUSE LIBYA FOLLOWING THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES\' DECISION 
TO LIFT EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA.  PERHAPS THE US INTENDS 
TO ACCUSE IRAN BECAUSE IRAN\'S NEW OPENNESS TOWARDS THE 
US BOTHERS ISRAEL.  FINALLY, THE US MAY ACCUSE ALL 
ISLAMISTS! 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPLOSIONS 
ARE THE JEWISH LOBBY AND THE CIA.\" 
 
\"WHO DARES\" A FRONT-PAGE EDITORIAL BY JOSEPH SAMAHA IN 
ARAB NATIONALIST AS-SAFIR (O8/8)\"THE MESSAGE SENT BY 
THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC \"JIHAD\" CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR THE EXPLOSIONS IN AFRICA, (WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY 
RESPONSIBLE OR NOT), ENFEEBLES THE ARABS\' ABILITY TO 
DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM BEING AUTOMATICALLY ACCUSED OF 
TERRORIST ACTS AGAINST US INTERESTS AROUND THE 
WORLD... WHOEVER PLANS TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE 
US IS COMMITTING A GRAVE MISTAKE.  TERRORIST ATTACKS 
OF THIS TYPE WILL NEVER OUST CLINTON OR CHANGE 
AMERICAN POLICY.  ON THE CONTRARY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
WILL NEITHER FORSAKE THEIR PRESIDENT IN TIMES OF 
CRISIS, NOR RELENT TO TERRORISTS\' DEMANDS.  THE 
RESULT?  MOST OF THE DEAD AND INJURED ARE INNOCENT 
PEOPLE WHOSE DEATHS WON\'T FULFILL THE TERRORISTS\' 
DESIRES AND DREAMS.\" 
 
4.  POC FOR THIS REPORT IS PETER VROOMAN, POL OFFICER.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV, PINR, KISL, MEPP, LE 
SUBJECT:  AMBASSADOR\'S CALLS ON PARLIAMENTARY LEADERSHIP 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR SATTERFIELD.  REASONS 1.5 
(B AND D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  DURING THE AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY CALLS 
AT THE PARLIAMENT, SPEAKER NABIH BERRI AND HIS DEPUTY ELIE 
FERZLI INDICATED THAT LAF COMMANDER GENERAL EMILE LAHUD IS 
THE MOST OBVIOUS CHOICE TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF 
LEBANON.  THEY HEDGED THEIR BETS BY NOTING THAT SEVERAL 
OTHER CANDIDATES (SUCH AS NASSIB LAHUD AND JEAN OBEID) ALSO 
HAD A CHANCE TO BECOME PRESIDENT.  BOTH EXPRESSED THE NEED 
TO ELECT A STRONG PRESIDENT TO COUNTERBALANCE THE POWER OF 
PRIME MINISTER RAFIQ AL-HARIRI.  THEY ALSO ASSERTED THAT THE 
ELECTION OF A MILITARY LEADER WOULD NOT ENDANGER \"DEMOCRACY\" 
IN LEBANON.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) AMBASSADOR PAID A COURTESY CALL ON SPEAKER BERRI ON 
24 SEPTEMBER.  AFTER EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT POLITICAL 
TURMOIL IN WASHINGTON WHICH HE CHARACTERIZED AS \"A PLOT TO 
UNDERMINE THE PRESIDENT,\" BERRI TURNED TO THE SITUATION IN 
SOUTHERN LEBANON AND DOMESTIC LEBANESE POLITICS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
SITUATION IN THE SOUTH: APPRECIATION FOR ILMG 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) BERRI EXPRESSED GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE ROLE OF 
THE ISRAEL-LEBANON MONITORING GROUP (ILMG) IN CALMING DOWN 
THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH.  HE SAID THAT THE LOCAL 
POPULATION\'S ATTACHMENT TO ILMG HAS BECOME SIMILAR TO THAT 
TOWARDS UNIFIL.  \"IF WE DID NOT HAVE THE ILMG, WE DON\'T KNOW 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SOUTH,\" BERRI EMPHASIZED.  BERRI 
ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE ALWAYS URGES  THE RESISTANCE (I.E., 
HIZBALLAH AND AMAL) NOT TO LAUNCH ATTACKS FROM INSIDE 
VILLAGES.  SUCH ADVICE, IF HEEDED, WOULD DEPRIVE ISRAEL OF 
AN EXCUSE TO RETURN FIRE AGAINST THESE VILLAGES.  BERRI 
BELIEVED THE SITUATION, ALBEIT UNSTABLE, WAS BETTER THAN IN 
THE PAST AND THAT DAMAGES WERE LESS THAN LAST YEAR.  HE WAS 
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE MEPP. 
 
------------------------------------- 
EMILE LAHUD AND PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS 
------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED BERRI ON HIS RECENT 
REELECTION TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE AMAL MOVEMENT. 
REFLECTING ON HIZBALLAH AS A RIVAL FOR POLITICAL PROMINENCE, 
BERRI SAID THAT \"ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING 
HIZBALLAH ALIVE,\" BY CONTINUING -- THROUGH ITS OCCUPATION OF 
THE SOUTH -- TO PROVIDE A PLATFORM FROM WHICH HIZBALLAH 
COULD ADVANCE ITS POLITICAL STANDING AS THE \"NATIONAL 
RESISTANCE.\"  BERRI WAS DISMISSIVE OF HIZBALLAH\'S ABILITY TO 
SUSTAIN A PROMINENT POLITICAL ROLE ONCE THE \"RESISTANCE\" 
ENDED.  (COMMENT:  THIS STRIKES US AS AN ALTOGETHER TOO ROSY 
VIEW OF A LIKELY POST-ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  SHI\'A POLITICS: 
AMAL -- AND BERRI IN PARTICULAR -- FACE SERIOUS CREDIBILITY 
AND IDENTITY PROBLEMS IN THE SOUTH AND ON A NATIONAL LEVEL. 
END COMMENT.) 
 
6.  (C) TURNING TO PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS, BERRI MENTIONED 
THAT GENERAL EMILE LAHUD APPEARED TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF 
BECOMING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF LEBANON.  HE NOTED IN PASSING 
THAT HE HAD ONCE RECOMMENDED NAMING EMILE LAHUD AS HEAD OF 
THE ARMY DURING AMINE GEMAYEL\'S TERM IN OFFICE IN THE EARLY 
1980S, BUT WAS OVERRULED IN FAVOR OF GEMAYEL\'S SELECTION OF 
MICHEL AOUN.  OTHER CANDIDATES SUCH AS NASSIB LAHUD AND JEAN 
OBEID ALSO HAD A CHANCE THOUGH, HE QUICKLY HEDGED.  BERRI 
SAID HE WANTED TO FINISH WITH THE ELECTION BEFORE OCTOBER 
15, BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER IMPORTANT LEGISLATIVE MATTERS 
BEFORE PARLIAMENT. 
 
7.  (C) BERRI POSTULATED THAT BUILDING \"INSTITUTIONS\" WAS 
THE BEST WAY TO FIGHT ENDURING SECTARIANISM WITHIN THE 
LEBANESE BODY POLITIC; HE ALSO DISCOUNTED THE NOTION THAT 
LAHUD\'S ELECTION MIGHT RESULT IN THE POLITICIZATION OF THE 
ARMY.  ASKED IF A LAHUD PRESIDENCY RAISED THE SPECTRE IN 
LEBANESE MINDS OF ARMY (OR MORE SPECIFICALLY G-2 MUKHABARAT) 
INTERFERENCE IN DOMESTIC POLITICS -- THE LEGENDARY \"DUALITY\" 
OR \"IZDIWAJIYAH\" OF PRESIDENT FUAD SHIBAB\'S RULE -- BERRI 
STATED FORCEFULLY THAT LAHUD \"WOULD BE AN EISENHOWER,\"  AND 
SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THE LAF ONCE IN OFFICE.  \"HE KNOWS 
NEITHER WE (THE POLITICIANS) NOR THE SYRIANS WOULD ACCEPT 
ANY \"DUALITY.\"  (COMMENT:  OTHER PROMINENT LEBANESE 
POLITICAL FIGURES -- AND WE -- ARE LESS CERTAIN, GIVEN THE 
PROMINENT ROLE NOW PLAYED BY THE LAF G-2 (AT LAHUD\'S -- AND 
UNDOUBTEDLY SYRIAN -- DIRECTION) IN MONITORING POLITICAL 
DEVELOPMENTS AND PERSONALITIES.  END COMMENT.) 
 
8.  (C) BERRI HIGHLIGHTED THREE MAJOR CHARACTERISTICS FOR A 
SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT: CREDIBLE TO THE CHRISTIANS, ACCEPTABLE 
TO THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND SATISFACTORY TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY (I.E., THE SYRIANS AND OTHER 
\"FRIENDS\").  HE EMPHASIZED THAT WHILE OTHER CANDIDATES MIGHT 
EXCEL IN SOME OF THESE AREAS, ONLY LAHUD EMBODIED ALL THREE 
CHARACTERISTICS. 
 
9.  (C) BERRI SAID HE WANTED TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD 
BE ABLE TO BRING THE CHRISTIANS BACK INTO THE POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMICAL LIFE OF THE NATION.  BERRI INSISTED THAT 
CHRISTIANS HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE WAKE OF THE 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS WHICH WERE CONDUCTED LAST MAY/JUNE. 
CHRISTIAN PARTICIPATION IN THE BALLOTING DOUBLED THAT OF THE 
SHI\'A IN PERCENTAGE TERMS AND REACHED 93 PERCENT 
PARTICIPATION IN THE 21 CHRISTIAN MUNICIPALITIES IN SOUTH 
LEBANON.  STRONGER CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP WOULD HELP TO OFFSET 
THE OVERBEARING INFLUENCE OF THE PRIME MINISTER \"AND CREATE 
A BALANCE\" IN THE (TRIPARTITE) PRESIDENCY (I.E., AN ALLY FOR 
ME AGAINST HARIRI).  LAUNCHING INTO A WELL-REHEARSED 
CRITIQUE OF THE PM, BERRI SAID HARIRI WAS NOT \"A MAN OF 
INSTITUTIONS.\"  IN A FINAL JAB AT THE PRIME MINISTER, BERRI 
CLOSED SAYING, \"HARIRI IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE 
OF HIS INTERNATIONAL STATURE, BUT HARIRI DEALS WITH DOMESTIC 
ISSUES LIKE A PRINCE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  WE HAVE NO PRINCES 
HERE.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
DEPUTY SPEAKER FERZLI ON SYRIAN INTEREST IN THE ELECTION 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
10.  (C) ILY FERZLI, THE GREEK ORTHODOX DEPUTY SPEAKER WHO 
HAS VERY CLOSE TIES WITH THE SYRIANS BUT LIMITED POLITICAL 
CREDIBILITY IN LEBANON, TOLD THE AMBASSADOR IN A SUBSEQUENT 
MEETING THAT GENERAL LAHUD HAD A GOOD CHANCE TO BECOME THE 
NEXT PRESIDENT. REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZING TO THE AMBASSADOR 
THAT HE, FERZLI, SHOULD BE SEEN AS A CHANNEL TO THE SYRIANS 
AND POINTING OUT HOW INTIMATE HIS CONTACTS WERE WITH SENIOR 
SYRIAN OFFICIALS, FERZLI STATED THAT LAHUD WAS BACKED BY 
SYRIA, AND THAT WITHOUT SYRIAN SUPPORT LAHUD WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO BUILD A UNIFIED ARMY.  \"SYRIA PROTECTED LAHUD 
AND MADE HIM A MINI-PRESIDENT,\" FERZLI ADDED.  FERZLI ECHOED 
BERRI\'S COMMENT THAT THE ELECTION OF A MILITARY LEADER WOULD 
NOT ENDANGER \"DEMOCRACY IN LEBANON.\" 
 
11.  (C) FERZLI ALSO HEDGED HIS BETS, HOWEVER, NOTING THAT 
\"NOTHING IS FINAL.\"  AS IF TO EMPHASIZE THAT POINT, FERZLI 
COMMENTED THAT NEITHER BERRI NOR HARIRI HAD A REAL INTEREST 
IN HAVING A STRONG PRESIDENT.  IN RESPONSE TO THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S QUESTION ABOUT HIZBALLAH PREFERENCES, FERZLI 
SAID THEY DO NOT WANT A STRONG PRESIDENT EITHER.  QUERIED ON 
WHETHER LAHUD HAD A KNOWN PROGRAM HE INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT 
IF ELECTED, FERZLI SAID EMPHATICALLY THAT LAHUD SHOULD NOT 
HAVE A \"PROGRAM,\"  SINCE THAT WOULD ONLY ENGAGE HIM IN PETTY 
DOMESTIC \"POLITICAL SQUABBLES.\"  (READ:  WOULD INTERFERE 
WITH THE ROLE OF THE PARLIAMENT.)  INSTEAD, THE NEW 
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A MORAL EXEMPLAR -- UNLIKE HRAWI -- AND 
ACT TO STRENGTHEN THE CREDIBILITY AND INTEGRITY OF STATE 
INSTITUTIONS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
PROSPECTS FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE HINGE ON THE PRESIDENCY 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
12.  (C) FERZLI WAS OPTIMISTIC THAT BETTER GOVERNMENT WAS 
POSSIBLE IN LEBANON IF THERE ARE \"ANGELS\" AT THE LEVEL OF 
THE TROIKA.  \"IF WE HAVE DEVILS AT THE TROIKA LEVEL, ALL 
OTHER OFFICIALS WILL ALSO TURN INTO DEVILS,\" FERZLI SURMISED 
WRYLY.  FERZLI EXPECTED THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, UPON THE 
RECOMMENDATION OF PRESIDENT HRAWI, TO CALL FOR AN 
EXTRAORDINARY SESSION OF PARLIAMENT TO CONSIDER A 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD PERMIT SENIOR CIVIL 
SERVANTS SUCH AS LAHUD TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.  IF THAT 
SCENARIO DOES NOT TRANSPIRE, THE SPEAKER OF PARLIAMENT CAN 
PROPOSE SUCH A SESSION ONCE PARLIAMENT CONVENES ON OCTOBER 
20.  AFTER OCTOBER 24, HOWEVER, PARLIAMENT CAN NO LONGER 
CALL A SPECIAL SESSION TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION.  (NOTE: 
THE LEBANESE CONSTITUTION IS COMPLEX ON THIS PROCEDURAL 
ISSUE, AND IT NOT INTERNALLY CONSISTENT.  IN FACT, MOST 
LEBANESE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
WITH BROAD SUPPORT COULD BE PASSED WHENEVER NECESSARY, 
THOUGH THE PERIOD BEFORE OCTOBER 24 WOULD SEEM MOST 
CONVENIENT.  END NOTE)

SYRIAN STRATEGY IN LEBANON: WIN OVER THE CHRISTIANS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
13.  (C) FERZLI BELIEVED THAT SYRIA WAS NOW \"INSIDE THE 
LEBANESE REGIME,\" AND NO LONGER HAD AN INTEREST IN 
DESTABILIZING LEBANON.  FERZLI ALSO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE 
OF THE SYRIAN ROLE IN LEBANON, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER A 
PEACE AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE ARABS AND ISRAEL. 
HE SAID \"SYRIA, AND IN PARTICULAR, HAFEZ AL-ASAD, IS THE 
ONLY ONE WHO CAN GIVE LEGITIMACY TO ANY PEACE BETWEEN THE 
ARABS AND ISRAEL\".  HE ALSO STATED THAT SYRIAN MILITARY 
PREPAREDNESS IN LEBANON WAS A GUARANTEE FOR PEACE. 
 
14.  (C) FINALLY, FERZLI -- GETTING IN ONE LAST PRO-SARG 
POINT -- ARGUED THAT ASAD WAS A \"STRATEGIC THINKER\" WHO 
WANTS TO IMPROVE HIS RELATIONS WITH THE WESTERN WORLD, 
ESPECIALLY THE U.S.  THE PROVING GROUND FOR ASAD TO PROMOTE 
HIS IMAGE ABROAD IS IN LEBANON.  FERZLI BELIEVED THE SYRIANS 
WANTED TO ACHIEVE A RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE CHRISTIANS OF 
LEBANON TO FACILITATE THIS END.

AMBASSADOR\'S PRESS COMMENTS 
--------------------------- 
 
15.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR MADE BRIEF REMARKS TO THE PRESS 
FOLLOWING HIS MEETINGS AT THE PARLIAMENT, NOTING THAT \"WE 
HAVE CLEARLY UNDERLINED OUR SUPPORT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 
INSTITUTIONS AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN LEBANON.  THE 
U.S. HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS A 
LEBANESE CHOICE.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE LEBANESE 
ELECTIONS.\"

TAGS: PGOV, KDEM, PINR, PREL, LE 
SUBJECT:  LEBANESE PARLIAMENT ELECTS ARMY COMMANDER EMILE 
          LAHUD AS PRESIDENT 
 
REFS:  A) STATE 190962  B) DAMASCUS 6387 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DAVID M. SATTERFIELD. 
REASONS 1.5 (B AND D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  RATIFYING THE NAME WHICH EMERGED FROM LAST 
WEEK\'S SUMMIT BETWEEN LEBANESE PRESIDENT HRAWI AND SYRIAN 
PRESIDENT ASAD, THE LEBANESE PARLIAMENT TODAY ELECTED LAF 
COMMANDER EMILE LAHUD AS LEBANON\'S ELEVENTH PRESIDENT BY A 
QUASI-UNANIMOUS VOTE OF 118 (AND 10 ABSTENTIONS).  WHILE 
UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES NO PRESIDENT COULD BE CHOSEN 
WITHOUT DAMASCUS\' BLESSING, LAHUD APPEARS TO BE A GENUINE 
NATIONAL CONSENSUS CANDIDATE -- WITH MOST LEBANESE TAKING 
HOPE FROM LAHUD\'S REPUTATION AS THE CORRUPTION-FREE 
REBUILDER OF A DECONFESSIONALIZED NATIONAL ARMY AND ABOVE 
ALL, A LEADER FROM OUTSIDE THE LARGELY DISCREDITED POLITICAL 
CLASS.  WITH MONTHS OF FEVERED SPECULATION OVER THE IDENTITY 
OF THEIR NEXT PRESIDENT NOW ENDED, AN EQUALLY INTENSE FOCUS 
WILL NOW TURN ON LAHUD\'S POLITICAL PROGRAM AND THE 
COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT.  LAHUD AND HIS SOON-TO- 
BE COLLEAGUES IN THE TRIPARTITE PRESIDENCY, PM HARIRI AND 
SPEAKER BERRI, WILL UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS ABOUT 
THE NEW GOVERNMENT SHOULD RUN -- AS WILL DAMASCUS. 
EXPECTATIONS OF POSITIVE CHANGE ARE RUNNING HIGH HERE, AS IS 
SKEPTICISM OVER WHETHER ANY OF THE PARTIES CONCERNED TRULY 
WANT TO SEE SUCH CHANGE TAKE PLACE.  OUR CONTINUED PUBLIC 
AND PRIVATE EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING LEBANON\'S INSTITUTIONS 
AND GOOD GOVERNANCE WILL BE IMPORTANT, BUT WHETHER LEBANESE 
(AND OUR OWN) HOPES WILL BE FULFILLED REMAINS VERY MUCH TO 
BE SEEN.    END SUMMARY. 
 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY (IN 
DAMASCUS) MAKES 
 
3.  (C)  MONTHS OF INTENSE SPECULATION AMONG LEBANON\'S 
POLITICAL ELITES REGARDING THE IDENTITY OF THE NEXT 
PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC WERE ENDED WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
LATE ON OCTOBER 5 -- FOLLOWING PRESIDENT HRAWI\'S SUMMIT WITH 
SYRIAN PRESIOENT ASAD -- THAT ARTICLE 49 OF THE LEBANESE 
CONSTITUTION WAS TO BE AMENDED TO PERMIT SENIOR GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS (LAF COMMANDING GENERAL EMILE LAHUD, FOR EXAMPLE) 
TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.  WHILE HRAWI CERTAINLY WAS SEEKING 
ASAD\'S APPROVAL FOR AN AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 49, IN HIS CASE 
TO PERMIT ANOTHER EXTENSION IN OFFICE, THE GENERAL CAME AWAY 
THE WINNER. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT: ARTICLE 49 WAS ADDED AT THE TIME OF THE 
TAIF ACCORD TO PRECLUDE THE POSSIBLE CANDIDACY OF THEN 
(REBEL)  LAF COMMANDER LTG MICHEL AOUN.  IRONICALLY, TODAY\'S 
VOTE  COINCIDED WITH THE ANNIVERSARY OF AOUN\'S FORCED 
DEPARTURE FROM LEBANON\'S PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AT THE HANDS OF 
THE SYRIAN MILITARY AND THEIR LEBANESE ALLIES (EN ROUTE TO 
ULTIMATE EXILE IN FRANCE) ON 13 OCTOBER 199O.  AOUN TOLD THE 
PRESS IN PARIS THAT HE IS PREPARED TO RETURN TO LEBANON 
SHOULD LAHUD MAKE THE REQUEST -- AN UNLIKELY SCENARIO.  END 
COMMENT. 
 
5.  (C) ACTING IN RECORD TIME AND WITH A VIGOR USUALLY 
UNKNOWN HERE, PRESIDENT HRAWI AND THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS 
PROMPTLY SENT TO THE PARLIAMENT THE REQUISITE AMENDMENT OF 
ARTICLE 49 WHICH WOULD PERMIT \"FOR ONE TIME ONLY\" AND ON AN 
EXCEPTIONAL BASIS THE CANDIDACY OF A SENIOR CIVIL SERVANT. 
MP BOUTROS HARB, A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
COMMITTEE OF PARLIAMENT AND A DECLARED PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE, VOTED AGAINST THE AMENDMENT IN COMMITTEE.  LEGAL 
ANALYSTS, INCLUDING A MEMBER OF LEBANON\'S CONSTITUTIONAL 
COUNCIL, TOLD EMBOFFS THAT THE DEBATE CENTERED ON WHETHER 
THE ONE-TIME EXCEPTION CLAUSE PROPOSED BY HRAWI WAS 
SUFFICIENT TO NULLIFY THE REQUIREMENT, EMBODIED IN LEBANESE 
ELECTORAL LAW, THAT THE CANDIDATE MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF 
ACTIVE MILITARY DUTY FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.  SINCE THE 
AMENDMENT WAS NOT SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CONSTITUTIONAL 
COUNCIL, THE POINT BECAME MOOT (ASSUMING THAT, UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, CONSTITUTIONAL SUBSTANCE AS OPPOSED TO FORM 
WAS EVER AT ISSUE) WHEN THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE APPROVED 
IT ON 12 OCTOBER. 
 
6.  (U) ON 14 OCTOBER THE FULL PARLIAMENT PASSED THE 
AMENDMENT BY A VOTE OF 113 TO 4 AGAINST (WITH 11 ABSTENTIONS 
-- COMPRISED MOSTLY OF DRUZE LEADER WALID JUMBLATT\'S 
PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST PARTY AND ITS ALLIES).  FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER, MP OMAR KARAME, CONTINUED HIS TWO-YEAR BOYCOTT OF 
PARLIAMENTARY SESSIONS AND REFUSED TO ATTEND THE SESSION 
DESPITE HIS PERSONAL SUPPORT FOR GENERAL LAHUD.  (COMMENT: 
THE HASTY AMENDMENT PROCESS DID HAVE ONE POSITIVE OUTCOME: 
IT BROUGHT PM HARIRI AND SPEAKER BERRI TO TALK WITH EACH 
OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS.  THE UNVEILING OF A 
STATUE OF LEBANON\'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER AND INDEPENDENCE 
HERO, RIYAD SOLH, ON 14 OCTOBER, ALSO PROVIDED AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TWO POLITICAL FOES TO COME TOGETHER, 
THIS TIME TO BASH THE TURKS (RECALLING OTTOMAN HEGEMONY AND 
OPPRESSION OF LEBANESE PATRIOTS SUCH AS AL-SOLH).  END 
COMMENT.) 
 
7.  (U) MP NASSIB LAHUD, AN UNDECLARED CONTENDER FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY, ARGUED FOR SIMPLY ABOLISHING THE PROBLEMATIC 
CLAUSES OF ARTICLE 49 RATHER THAN ADD A \"ONE-TIME ONLY\" 
PROVISION WHICH IN HIS VIEW WEAKENED THE CONSTITUTION.  \"BY 
AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION FOR ONE TIME ONLY AND 
EXCEPTIONALLY ON THE EVE OF EVERY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IS 
A STATE OF LAW AND INSTITUTIONS BEING BUILT?\" HE TOLD THE 
PRESS (A SENTIMENT OTHER POLITICIANS AND ANALYSTS HERE HAVE 
EXPRESSED TO US PRIVATELY.)  HOWEVER, LAHUD, ESTRANGED 
COUSIN OF EMILE, SUBSEQUENTLY INDICATED HIS INTENTION TO 
VOTE FOR THE GENERAL. 
 
ELECTION DAY ATMOSPHERICS:  A GOOD TIME HAD BY ALL 
 
8.  (U) THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS WERE SUMMONED TO ATTEND THE 
ELECTORAL SESSION OF PARLIAMENT AT 110O ON 15 OCTOBER.  WITH 
ALL BUT TEN (MOSTLY ALLIES OF DRUZE LEADER AND MINISTER OF 
DISPLACED WALID JUMBLATT) OF THE 128 DEPUTIES IN THEIR 
SEATS, SPEAKER NABIH BERRI MADE THIS TRAIN RUN ON TIME.  A 
SHOUT OF \"WHY CAN\'T WE JUST DECLARE THIS THING DONE\" WAS MET 
BY MIXED LAUGHTER AND CRIES OF \"GIVES US THE BALLOTS.\" 
AFTER COLLECTION OF THE SEALED UNMARKED ENVELOPES CONTAINING 
THE MPS\' CHOICE, DEPUTY SPEAKER FERZLI OPENED EACH AND READ 
ALOUD (118 TIMES) THE NAME \"EMILE LAHUD.\"  THIS PROCESS 
ELICITED STILL MORE GALES OF LAUGHTER AND BANTERING ON THE 
FLOOR, WITH BERRI AT ONE POINT ORDERING FERZLI TO \"SPEED IT 
UP.\"  AT 11:25, EMILE LAHUD WAS DECLARED THE PRESIDENT- 
ELECT.  AS THE DIPLOMATS AND DEPUTIES DECAMPED, FRENCH 
AMBASSADOR JOUANNEAU SUMMED UP THE PROCEEDINGS FOR THOSE 
PRESENT BY DRYLY NOTING \"QUELLE SURPRISE.\" 
 
HOPES FOR LAHUD 
 
9.  (C)  WHILE MOST LEBANESE RESENT SYRIAN DIRECTION OF THE 
ELECTORAL PROCESS AND THE HASTY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, 
THERE IS NEAR (AND TO US GENUINE) CONSENSUS SUPPORT FOR 
GENERAL LAHUD AS LEBANON\'S NEXT PRESIDENT -- AND AS A 
CATALYST FOR MUCH-NEEDED CHANGE.  THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND 
CAVEATS IN THIS SUPPORT, HOWEVER.  JUMBLATT AND HIS DRUZE 
ALLIES REMAIN DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE MILITARY AND HIS 
RELATIONS WITH LAHUD CAN BE EXPECTED TO BE (AT BEST) 
PROBLEMATIC.  WHILE MOST MARONITES SEE LAHUD AS AMONG THE 
BEST OF THE POSSIBLE CANDIDATES (THEIR HEARTS WERE WITH 
NASSIB LAHUD OR BUTROS HARB) AND FAR SUPERIOR TO THE LIKES 
OF JEAN OBEYD OR ELIE HOBEIQA, THERE IS A RESERVOIR OF 
CONCERN THAT SYRIA WILL NOW DICTATE THE CHOICE OF LAHUD\'S 
SUCCESSOR IN THE LAF AND WILL THUS HAVE BOTH THE PRESIDENT 
AND ARMY CHIEF BEHOLDEN TO THEIR WILL. 
 
10.  (C) ALTHOUGH FORMER PRESIDENT CHARLES HELOU TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR ON 14 OCTOBER THAT HE VIEWED A LAHUD PRESIDENCY 
WITH GREAT OPTIMISM, MANY FROM HIS POLITICAL GENERATION 
RECALL THE REIGN OF PRESIDENT FOUAD SHEHAB (ALSO LAF 
COMMANDER BEFORE HIS ELECTION) WHOSE USE OF THE LAF G-2 TO 
MONITOR AND SHAPE POLITICAL DECISIONS WAS WIDELY RESENTED 
AND FEARED.   DESPITE SUCH RESERVATIONS, FROM HIZBALLAH TO 
THE MARONITE LEAGUE, LAHUD HAS A WIDE BODY OF SUPPORT ACROSS 
CONFESSIONAL LINES AND AMONG THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  KEY 
LEADERS IN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT, NOTABLY PM HARIRI, HAVE 
BEEN QUICK TO PLEDGE PUBLICLY THEIR DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH 
THE NEW PRESIDENT. 
 
ITS THE ECONOMY, STUPID (AND THE SOCIETY, AND POLITICS) 
 
11.  (C) THE UNANSWERED QUESTION HERE IS WHAT, PRECISELY, 
THE NEW PRESIDENT INTENDS TO DO WITH THIS SUPPORT.  LEBANON 
FACES A VARIETY OF SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES:  THE NEED FOR 
URGENT ECONOMIC REFORMS, AN ALMOST WHOLLY DISCREDITED AND 
CORRUPT SPOILS SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AND CONTINUING DRIFT IN 
SEARCH OF A NEW, POST-CIVIL WAR IDENTITY AND SENSE OF 
NATIONHOOD.  NOT ONE OF LEBANON\'S MANY POLITICIANS, 
ECONOMISTS OR JOURNALISTS CLAIM TO KNOW WHAT IS IN LAHUD\'S 
MIND OR WHETHER, IN FACT, HE HAS A PROGRAM FOR GOVERNANCE. 
THE ROLE AND AUTHORITY OF THE POST-TAIF PRESIDENT IS ITSELF 
AMBIGUOUS.  UNLIKE THE PRIME MINISTER AND SPEAKER OF THE 
PARLIAMENT, WHO HAVE CLEARLY DEFINED EXECUTIVE AND 
LEGISLATIVE POWERS AND PREROGATIVES, THE PRESIDENT -- BY THE 
TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION -- PLAYS A LARGELY SYMBOLIC ROLE. 
PERSONAL CORRUPTION, LACK OF INTEREST AND LIMITED 
CREDIBILITY AS A NATIONAL OR INTERNATIONAL STATESMAN 
RENDERED CURRENT PRESIDENT HRAWI UNFIT OR UNABLE TO TAKE ON 
ANY LARGER, MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES.  MANY HERE 
ARGUE THAT LAHUD CAN INDEED ASSUME A SIGNIFICANT ROLE AS AN 
EXEMPLAR OF PERSONAL ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT AND, BUILDING ON 
HIS SUCCESS WITH THE LAF, IN REBUILDING AND REINFORCING THE 
INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT. 
 
12.  (C) ASSUMING THAT LAHUD DOES HAVE A CONCEPT OF WHAT HE 
WISHES TO DO AS PRESIDENT (THERE ARE SOME WHO ASSERT THAT 
LAHUD WANTS VERY MUCH TO BE PRESIDENT, BUT DOES NOT HAVE A 
CLEAR VISION OF WHAT HE WILL DO ONCE THERE), HE WILL FACE A 
FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE IN THE PERSON OF PM HARIRI -- WHO IS 
VIRTUALLY CERTAIN TO CONTINUE AS PRIME MINISTER -- TO ANY 
ATTEMPT TO ACT IN A MANNER WHICH HARIRI WILL VIEW AS 
THREATENING HIS OWN PREEMINENCE.  FOR ALL HARIRI\'S TALK OF 
SUPPORT FOR LAHUD AS \"A STRONG PRESIDENT,\" THE CLEAR SUBTEXT 
IS \"STRONG PRESIDENT, YES\" BUT AS AN ASSET FOR HARIRI\'S USE 
TO COUNTER SPEAKER BERRI.  THE PM TOLD AMBASSADOR SHORTLY 
BEFORE THE ELECTION THAT \"I HOPE LAHUD WILL BE AN ALLY.  BUT 
IF HE THINKS HE CAN DICTATE TO ME ON HOW A NEW GOVERNMENT 
WILL BE FORMED OR TRIES TO BLOCK ME, I WILL CRUSH HIM.\" 
 
13.  (C) FOR HIS PART, BERRI WANTS A NEW GOVERNMENT COMPOSED 
OF PARLIAMENTARIANS.  FORMER SPEAKER HUSSEIN HUSSEINI -- NO 
FRIEND OF BERRI BUT LOYAL TO THE PARLIAMENT AND ITS ROLE -- 
TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON 14 OCTOBER THAT HE, TOO, FAVORED A 
GOVERNMENT OF DEPUTIES REPRESENTING ALL CONFESSIONS \"IN THE 
SPIRIT OF TAIF.\"  THIS IS IN CONTRAST, HUSSEINI SAID, TO THE 
KNOWN INTENT OF THE PRIME MINISTER TO CREATE A CABINET OF 
\"TECHNOCRATS.\" 
 
SYRIA:  WHAT DOES ASAD WANT? 
 
14.  (C) EMBASSY DAMASCUS\' EXCELLENT DISCUSSION (REFTEL) OF 
THE VARYING INTERPRETATIONS POSSIBLE FOR SELECTION OF LAHUD 
MATCHES OUR OWN (AND OUR INTERLOCUTORS) UNCERTAINTY WHETHER 
DAMASCUS SEES IN LAHUD A STABILIZING FORCE IN THE BEST SENSE 
(STRENGTHENED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION) OR THE WORST 
(LAHUD AS YET ANOTHER PLAYER TO BE MANIPULATED IN ORDER TO 
PREVENT EMERGENCE OF ANY INDEPENDENT AND THUS THREATENING -- 
TO SYRIA -- LEBANESE POLITY).  THOSE WHO BELIEVE THE LATTER, 
E.G. MINISTER HOBEIQA, STATE FLATLY THAT THE SYRIANS WILL 
CONTROL THE OVERALL PROCESS OF FORMING A NEW GOVERNMENT -- 
WHICH WILL MERELY BE A \"RESHUFFLING\" OF THE MINISTERIAL 
DOSSIERS RATHER THAN ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN APPROACH TO 
GOVERNANCE IN LEBANON.  HOBEIQA TOLD THE AMBASSADOR ON 9 
OCTOBER THAT HE RECOGNIZED THAT \"THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN 
SYRIA,\" BUT BELIEVED THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE SYRIANS WANT 
A PRESIDENT LIKE LAHUD WHO HAS PROVEN HIMSELF PREDICTABLE, 
AND RELIABLE AS AN ALLY TO ASAD\'S SON BASHAR IN DAYS TO 
COME.  HOBEIQA (SPEAKING HERE FOR A WIDE SPECTRUM OF 
LEBANON\'S POLITICAL CLASS) DID NOT THINK LAHUD HAD THE 
EXPERIENCE NEED TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE.  \"WHO MAKES CHANGE 
HERE?,\" HOBEIQA ASKED SARCASTICALLY.  \"I HOPE THE GENERAL IS 
A GOOD TACTICIAN.  I AM SURE HE IS NOT.  PEOPLE SAY HE IS A 
GOOD GENERAL.  WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  HE NEVER HAD TO FIGHT, 
AND HE WILL FACE TESTS AHEAD.\" 
 
15.  (C) MOST LEBANESE HOPE LAHUD\'S LEADERSHIP WILL MARK AN 
END TO THE SQUABBLING, INEFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
\"TROIKA\" (I.E., THE PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER, AND SPEAKER). 
INDEED, REPORTS ARE CIRCULATING HERE THAT THE SYRIANS, 
PARTICULARLY ASAD HIMSELF, DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE RECEIVING 
STREAMS OF LEBANESE VISITORS PLEADING THEIR CASES AND 
PROBLEMS IN DAMASCUS.  LAHUD MAY WELL PUT AN END TO SOME OF 
THIS ACTIVITY (JUST AS HE FORBADE JUNIOR OFFICERS TO HAVE 
CONTACT WITH THE SYRIANS OUTSIDE OF LEBANON).  BUT HERE 
AGAIN, THERE IS A DARKER READING OF SYRIAN INTENTIONS FROM 
SOME OF LEBANON\'S MOST ASTUTE ANALYSTS, INCLUDING 
EDITORIALIST SARKIS NAOUM AND FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER FOUAD 
BUTROS.  THEY ARE CONVINCED THAT BEYOND HIS PROVEN RECORD AS 
A DEPENDABLE PARTNER TO SYRIA AND AN ASSET FOR THE FUTURE, 
SYRIA CHOSE LAHUD BECAUSE HE REPRESENTED THE MOST POTENT 
COUNTERWEIGHT THAT COULD BE POSED AGAINST HARIRI -- WHOSE 
PERCEIVED INDEPENDENCE NEEDED A MORE EFFECTIVE BALANCE THAN 
HRAWI COULD PROVIDE.  THEY ASSERT \"LAHUD IS SEEN BY THE 
SYRIANS AS AN ANTI-HARIRI.\" 
 
16.  (C) COMMENT:  WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN FOR US?  LAHUD 
REMAINS A POLITICAL ENIGMA AND SYRIAN INTENTIONS IN 
PERMITTING HIS ELECTION -- ALBEIT TO POPULAR ACCLAIM -- ARE 
EVEN HARDER TO READ.  MUCH OF THE SKEPTICISM PREVALENT HERE 
IS WORTH TAKING ON BOARD, BUT LAHUD WILL STILL HAVE SOME 
TIME TO NAME A NEW GOVERNMENT AND ELABORATE HIS PROGRAM. 
WHETHER THIS WILL AMOUNT TO THE FORMATION OF A \"THIRD 
REPUBLIC\" CHARACTERIZED BY MORE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT AND 
LESS VENAL POLITICAL LEADERSHIP, OR MORE OF THE SAME SORT OF 
TURF BATTLES BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE TROIKA REMAINS TO BE 
SEEN.  WE CLEARLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE FORMER.  THE 
DEPARTMENT STATEMENT WELCOMING LAHUD\'S ELECTION AND 
EXPRESSING OUR HOPE THAT GOOD GOVERNANCE AND STRENGTHENING 
OF INSTITUTIONS WILL MARK HIS TENURE MAKES THE RIGHT POINTS. 
WE WILL BE PRESSING THOSE SAME THEMES IN OUR OWN DIALOGUE 
WITH LAHUD AND IN OUR ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS FUTURE 
COLLEAGUES BERRI AND HARIRI.  END COMMENT

TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, PTER, ECON, EAID, SY, IS, LE 
SUBJECT:  JEZZINE:  LOOKING FOR NORMALITY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB. DAVID SATTERFIELD.  REASON: 1.5 (B, D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  EMBASSY STAFF VISITED THE SOUTHERN 
CITY OF JEZZINE RECENTLY, FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE 
WITHDRAWAL OF THE SOUTH LEBANON ARMY (SLA).  INITIAL 
FEAR AMONG RESIDENTS ABOUT SAFETY HAVE ABATED. 
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY IS INCREASING MODESTLY, 
BUT HAS NOT REPLACED THE ECONOMIC LOSS FROM THE 
SLA\'S PULLOUT, WHICH ENDED MILITIA SPENDING ON LOCAL 
GOODS AS WELL AS PAYMENTS TO LOCAL FIGHTERS AND 
WIDOWS, AND SEVERED TRADE LINKS TO THE SECURITY 
ZONE.  GOL RECONSTRUCTION AND ASSISTANCE ARE 
VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT, AND SO IS THE PRESENCE OF 
THE STATE.  FOLLOWING INITIAL VISITS BY TOP 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE REGION HAS SEEN LITTLE 
FOLLOW-UP WORK BY SERVICE MINISTRIES AND HAS 
SUFFERED A VIRTUAL BLOCKADE BY ARMY CHECKPOINTS SET 
UP OUTSIDE THE CITY (WHERE THE ARMY IS ABSENT), 
MAKING MOVEMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE IMPRACTICAL. 
CRITICS SEE A DELIBERATE SYRIAN/LEBANESE EFFORT TO 
TREAT JEZZINE AS ABNORMAL, IN ORDER TO DISCOURAGE 
FURTHER POLITICALLY EMBARRASSING UNILATERAL 
WITHDRAWALS BY ISRAEL.  WHATEVER THE MOTIVE, THE 
PEOPLE OF JEZZINE FEEL ISOLATED.  THE CONVICTION OF 
NEARLY 200 SLA MEMBERS FROM JEZZINE ACCENTUATES THIS 
MOOD, ALTHOUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS HAS BEEN 
TRANSPARENT AND AVERAGE ONE YEAR SENTENCES MODEST. 
 
2. (C) JEZZINE\'S FUTURE MAY LIE IN TOURISM, ITS 
TRADITIONAL REVENUE SOURCE.  UNTIL THE CHECKPOINTS 
ARE LIFTED, JEZZINE WILL REMAIN CUT OFF FROM ITS OLD 
MARKETS, REVENUE SOURCES AND ECONOMIC NETWORK IN THE 
ISRAELI-OCCUPIED SECURITY ZONE BUT NOT YET CONNECTED 
TO LEBANON\'S NATIONAL ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY UNABLE 
TO DRAW TOURISTS.  AGRICULTURAL REVENUE ALONE WILL 
NOT REVITALIZE THE REGION OR KEEP ITS YOUNG PEOPLE 
FROM MOVING AWAY.  ONE BRIGHT SPOT IS THE $500,000 
USAID PROGRAM FOR THE REGION.  U.S. PROJECTS HAVE 
BOOSTED THE MORALE OF VILLAGE RESIDENTS, RESULTING 
IN CROSS-CONFESSIONAL COOPERATION AMONG THEM INSTEAD 
OF FIGHTING OVER PROJECT FUNDING FOR THEIR OWN 
INTERESTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LUNCH WITH NOTABLES:  THE PARTY LINE 
 
3. (C) THE PARTY LINE BY OFFICIALDOM IN JEZZINE IS 
DEFINITELY TO ACCENTUATE THE POSITIVE.  WE HEARD AN 
UPBEAT ASSESSMENT OVER LUNCH HOSTED BY JEZZINE 
MARONITE MP SAMIR AZAR (A CLOSE ALLY OF AMAL 
MOVEMENT) AND LOCAL NOTABLES, INCLUDING THE POLICE 
COMMANDER.  AZAR AND HIS GUESTS EXPRESSED CAUTIOUS 
OPTIMISM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF JEZZINE FREE OF THE SLA 
PRESENCE.  THE SECURITY SITUATION WAS JUDGED GOOD, 
DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF THE ARMY, BECAUSE IT HINGED 
ON A POLITICAL CONSENSUS BY ALL PARTIES THAT JEZZINE 
SHOULD NOT BE DESTABILIZED.  GUESTS ECHOED 
DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LACK OF EU ACTION IN LOCAL 
DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION BUT PRAISED USAID FOR 
DELIVERING PRACTICAL PROGRAMS SPEEDILY.  AZAR AND 
HIS COLLEAGUES EXPRESSED PLEASURE WITH THE GOL\'S 
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN JEZZINE.  SO FAR, 
RENOVATION HAS BEGUN ON THE HOSPITAL AND MAIN 
GOVERNMENT BUILDING (SERAIL), AND FUNDS WERE 
RELEASED RECENTLY FOR ROAD ASPHALT. 
 
AND THE REAL MOOD 
 
4. (C) BUT IN A PRIVATE WALK IN THE GARDEN, AZAR 
ADMITTED THE NEED FOR MORE GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. 
THE AMAL-CONTROLLED, BUT STATE-FUNDED COUNCIL FOR 
THE SOUTH HAD DISPERSED ONLY LIMITED FUNDS FOR HOUSE 
RECONSTRUCTION IN THE JEZZINE POCKET -- BUT WAS SO 
STINGY TOWARD CHRISTIAN JEZZINE THAT THE PERCEPTION 
OF THE COUNCIL AS A SHI\'A SLUSH FUND WAS ONLY 
REINFORCED.  PRESIDENT LAHOUD, PRIME MINISTER HOSS, 
AND MOST CABINET MINISTERS VISITED JEZZINE AFTER THE 
PULLOUT, TO JOIN IN THE FESTIVE ATMOSPHERE; BUT NOT 
ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF A SERVICE MINISTRY HAS 
RETURNED, AZAR COMPLAINED.  BUREAUCRATIC DELAYS 
BLOCKED PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AS WELL; FOR 
EXAMPLE, ONE NATIONAL BANK PLANNED TO OPEN A BRANCH 
IN JEZZINE, BUT HAS FAILED TO OBTAIN A PERMIT FROM 
THE GOVERNMENT -- OSTENSIBLY BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT 
WANTS TO HOLD ACTIVITY UNTIL A MASTER PLAN IS IN 
PLACE.  AZAR AND OTHERS SUPPORT A COMPREHENSIVE 
APPROACH -- AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED IDEAS -- BUT WISH 
MORE HAD BEEN DONE TO ENCOURAGE THE CITIZENRY IN THE 
MEANTIME. 
 
5. (C) THE LOCAL ISF COMMANDER TOLD US THAT HIS JOB 
IS DIFFICULT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.  FIRST, HE IS 
WOEFULLY UNDERSTAFFED AND HAS FEW RESOURCES.  HE HAS 
ONLY ONE CAR AT HIS DISPOSAL FOR A RUGGED, RURAL 
AREA AND 33 MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND.  THE AVERAGE AGE 
OF THE MEN IS 55 TO 60.  THE ISF USES FIVE-MAN 
PATROLS IN JEZZINE AND FIVE MEN IN NEARBY SUPPORT 
ARRAY.  THE COMMANDER NOTED THAT HIS APPOINTMENT TO 
THE JEZZINE AREA IS ACTUALLY A VIOLATION OF THE LAW 
BECAUSE HE IS AN AREA NATIVE.  THIS POINT LEADS TO 
OTHER DIFFICULTIES AS HE SEEKS TO MAINTAIN LAW AND 
ORDER IN A REGION THAT FELL INTO BENIGN NEGLECT OF 
THE LAW DURING THE OCCUPATION.  HE IS FORCED TO 
INTERVENE IN PETTY DISPUTES INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH 
WHOM HE GREW UP, CAUSING SOME BAD FEELINGS TOWARDS 
HIM.  HE ADDED THAT THE AREA IS FULL OF GOL 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OPERATIVES. 
 
6. (C) LIKE AZAR, HE STRESSED THAT JEZZINE\'S EVIDENT 
SECURITY RESULTED NOT FROM HIS OWN MODEST PRESENCE, 
BUT FROM A \"POLITICAL DECISION\" BY SYRIA, HIZBALLAH, 
AMAL, THE ISRAELIS, AND THE SLA.  HE NOTED THAT HIS 
CURRENT FORCES COULD NOT POSSIBLY COPE WITH DEMANDS 
TO MAINTAIN ORDER DURING NEXT YEAR\'S PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS, SHOULD A DECISION BE TAKEN TO SET UP 
BALLOT BOXES IN JEZZINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
1972. 
 
7. (C) DESPITE ISF INADEQUACIES, USAID CONTRACTORS 
SAID MOST RESIDENTS HAVE OVERCOME INITIAL FEARS 
ABOUT SECURITY.  AT FIRST, MANY PEOPLE WERE 
RELUCTANT TO RETURN TO JEZZINE, FEARING THEIR 
SAFETY.  THOSE FEARS SUBSIDED AFTER A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS -- THERE HAVE BEEN NO KNOWN INFILTRATIONS OF 
POPULATED AREAS BY HIZBALLAH, CONTRACTORS NOTED. 
 
THE OPPOSITION:  NOT SO ROSY PICTURE 
 
8. (C) WE MET WITH FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. 
SIMON KARAM AT HIS FAMILY HOUSE IN JEZZINE.  KARAM 
SAID THAT JEZZINE NEEDS NORMALITY.  AT PRESENT IT IS 
ISOLATED FROM OTHER TOWNS.  ENTRY AND EXIT IS 
CONTROLLED BY GOL CHECKPOINTS.  ONLY RESIDENTS OF 
JEZZINE ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER.  AS A RESULT, 
JEZZINE IS NOT RE-INTEGRATED INTO THE NATION, YET 
ITS OLD TRADING AND REVENUE LINKS TO ISRAELI 
OCCUPIED SOUTH LEBANON ARE CUT.  (NB:  CUSTOMS 
SQUADS NOW PREVENT GOODS FROM ENTERING FROM 
MARJAYOUN, ENDING ONE FAMOUS JEZZINE SOURCE OF 
INCOME -- SMUGGLING -- AND BRINGING BEIRUT\'S SUPPLY 
OF VITAL ISRAELI-SOURCED GOODS, SUCH AS CHIVAS REGAL 
WHISKY, TO DANGEROUSLY LOW LEVELS.) 
 
9. (C) KARAM EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE FAMILIES 
AND WIDOWS OF SLA MILITIAMEN.  MANY OF THEM ARE 
DESTITUTE BECAUSE THE BREADWINNERS ARE EITHER IN 
LEBANESE JAILS OR DEAD, AND SLA PAYMENTS CEASED WITH 
THE EVACUATION.  KARAM SAID THAT HE IS WORKING TO 
ESTABLISH AN NGO TO SECURE FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR 
THESE FAMILIES.  HE IS WORKING TO SECURE A PARDON 
FOR THE APPROXIMATELY 200 FORMER SLA MEMBERS WHO 
TURNED THEMSELVES OVER TO THE GOL.  AS PROMISED 
PRIVATELY BY THE PRESIDENT AND HIS BROTHER, 
LEBANON\'S MILITARY PROSECUTOR, THE JUDICIAL PROCESS 
HAS BEEN TRANSPARENT AND MOST SENTENCES LIGHT -- ONE 
YEAR ON AVERAGE.  (COMMENT:  THIS IS ONE UNSUNG 
LEBANESE CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURE, INDICATIVE OF 
HOW THE BULK OF THE SLA RANK-AND-FILE MAY BE TREATED 
IN THE EVENT OF AN ISRAELI PULLOUT FROM THE SOUTH. 
END COMMENT.)  ACCORDING TO KARAM\'S FIGURES, 182 OF 
THE SLA\'ERS WHO SURRENDERED AT JEZZINE ARE SERVING 
SENTENCES; 10 WERE FREED; AND 20 AWAIT JUDICIAL 
REVIEW. 
 
10. (C) JEZZINE\'S GREEK CATHOLIC MP, NADIM SALEM, 
SPOKE BITTERLY TO US ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT\'S HANDLING 
OF JEZZINE (WE CALLED ON HIM IN BEIRUT, AS HE HAS NO 
HOME IN JEZZINE AND DOESN\'T GET ALONG WITH ANY OF 
OUR OTHER HOSTS).  SALEM IS ENGAGED IN A SPECTACULAR 
-- PERHAPS SUICIDAL -- FIGHT WITH SPEAKER/AMAL 
MOVEMENT HEAD NABIH BERRI, SO IS HAMMERING HARD ON 
POPULIST ANTI-GOVERNMENT LINES IN PREPARATION FOR 
NEXT YEAR\'S ELECTIONS.  HE CONDEMNED THE TRIALS OF 
SLA\'ERS AS UNFAIR COMPARED TO THE OPEN-HANDED 
TREATMENT OF HIZBALLAH TODAY, OR LEBANON\'S OTHER 
MILITIAS WHEN THEY VOLUNTARILY DISBANDED IN 1991. 
HE DISMISSED THE LACK OF A STATE PRESENCE IN JEZZINE 
-- WHETHER THE ARMY OR THE SERVICE MINISTRIES -- AS 
IN A STATE OF SUSPENSE.  THE MOTIVE:  TO DISCOURAGE 
FURTHER ISRAELI WITHDRAWALS AND TO KEEP ALL OPTIONS 
OPEN, IN CASE DAMASCUS WANTS TO TURN THE HEAT UP ON 
THE IDF/SLA IN ADJOINING AREAS. 
 
11. (C)  COMMENT:  HIS ARGUMENT MAY NOT BEAR 
SCRUTINY, BUT THE POINT IS THAT SOME RESIDENTS OF 
JEZZINE STILL FEEL EXPOSED AND VULNERABLE.  THEY ARE 
PREY TO POLITICIANS LIKE SALEM WHO WILL PLAY ON THAT 
MOOD -- AGGRAVATED BY CHRISTIAN JEZZINE\'S SENSE OF 
CONFESSIONAL ISOLATION WITHIN A MUSLIM OCEAN IN THE 
SOUTH -- IF IT SERVES THEIR PURPOSES.  WE EVEN 
ENCOUNTERED SOME IN JEZZINE WHO WERE CONVINCED THE 
AREA WAS BEING KEPT APART BY INTERNATIONAL 
AGREEMENT, SO IT COULD BE EMPTIED OF ITS NATIVES TO 
MAKE WAY FOR PALESTINIAN RESETTLEMENT.  THE 
EXISTENCE OF MYSTERIOUS, NEVER OCCUPIED APARTMENT 
BUILDINGS ON THE MARCHES OF JEZZINE WERE CITED AS 
SOLE EVIDENCE OF THIS PLOT.  END COMMENT. 
 
TOURISM IN JEZZINE:  BACK TO THE FUTURE? 
 
12. (C) MANY OF OUR CONTACTS BELIEVED THE REGION\'S 
FUTURE LIES IN ITS TRADITIONAL MONEYMAKER:  TOURISM. 
KARAM EXPLAINED THAT FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF 
THE AUTOMOBILE TO THE MIDEAST IN THE 1930\'S, RICH 
PALESTINIANS AND EGYPTIANS MOTORED IN THE SUMMER TO 
THE NEAREST NICE MOUNTAIN TOWN THEY COULD FIND, 
JEZZINE -- GIVING BIRTH TO A TOURIST INDUSTRY.  THE 
ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT CUT JEZZINE OFF FROM THIS 
FLOW, AND LEBANON\'S CIVIL WAR AND ISRAELI OCCUPATION 
\"PUT THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN.\"  A MODEST TOURIST 
INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS, AND HOTELIERS AND 
RESTAURANTEURS GOT A BOOST FROM JEZZINE\'S WEEK-LONG 
SHOPPING FESTIVAL HELD IN AUGUST UNDER THE AUSPICES 
OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND TRADE.  THE EVENT, 
HOWEVER, WAS LESS THAN SUCCESSFUL, SINCE NON- 
RESIDENTS COULD NOT CROSS ARMY HURDLES AT THE 
CHECKPOINTS.  JEZZINE MAY NEVER AGAIN ATTRACT MIDDLE 
EAST TOURISTS (ALTHOUGH KARAM, A NORMALIZATION TRUE 
BELIEVER, DREAMS OF ISRAELIS DRIVING FROM TEL AVIV 
TO ENJOY THE MOUNTAIN AIR IN A LIBERAL, CHRISTIAN 
ENVIRONMENT).  HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE A POSSIBILITY 
THAT THIS UNSPOILED REGION COULD BECOME A POPULAR 
SUMMER RETREAT FOR LEBANESE TOURISTS, ONCE THE GOL 
LIFTS THE CHECKPOINTS AND PERMITS OTHER THAN 
RESIDENTS TO VISIT JEZZINE -- AND IF, CONTRARY TO 
FORM, THE LEBANESE IMPOSE ZONING TO PRESERVE NATURAL 
BEAUTY. 
 
THE USAID EXPERIENCE 
 
13. (U) THE CURRENT MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IN JEZZINE 
IS AGRICULTURE.  THE AREA PRODUCES SOME 150,000 
CRATES OF APPLES PER YEAR.  ABOUT TWO TONS OF 
VALUABLE PINE NUTS -- A LOCAL DELICACY -- ARE 
HARVESTED ANNUALLY.  GRAPES ARE SOLD FOR USE IN THE 
PRODUCTION OF ARAK, THE NATIONAL BEVERAGE.  REVENUES 
FROM AGRICULTURAL SALES BY LAW REMAIN WITH THE 
MUNICIPALITY FOR LOCAL EXPENDITURE. 
 
14. (U) IT IS IN THIS FIELD THAT USAID HAS 
CONCENTRATED.  WE STOPPED IN THE SUNNI VILLAGE OF 
BENOUAITI, WHERE USAID FINANCED TWO IRRIGATION 
PROJECTS, CONSTRUCTION OF A RETAINING WALL, A ROAD, 
AND A BRIDGE.  THE PROJECT IS OVERSEEN BY MERCY 
CORPS INTERNATIONAL (MCI).  MCI\'S OFFICER IN CHARGE, 
HIAM SHEDID, SAID THAT FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL, 
THERE WAS NO COOPERATION AMONG THE VARIOUS VILLAGES, 
AS EACH FOUGHT FOR A PIECE OF THE USAID PIE.  THIS 
SQUABBLING HAS SUBSIDED, AS RESIDENTS REALIZED THAT 
THEY CAN BENEFIT ONLY AS A WHOLE INSTEAD OF AS 
FACTIONS.  BENOUATI\'S MAYOR PROUDLY SHOWED OFF THE 
PROJECTS IN HIS VILLAGE, AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 
RESIDENTS AT FIRST WERE SKEPTICAL THAT THE USAID 
PROJECTS WOULD EVER COME TO FRUITION.  THEY ARE NOW 
SO ENTHUSIASTIC THAT NEIGHBORING VILLAGERS HAVE 
DELUGED MERCY CORPS WITH PROPOSED PROJECTS, AND 
ALREADY HAVE RAISED THE REQUIRED LOCAL MATCHING 
FUNDS.  EU REPRESENTATIVES FROM FRANCE, GERMANY, AND 
ITALY VISITED THE REGION AND HAVE CARRIED OUT 
STUDIES, BUT NONE HAVE PROGRESSED BEYOND THE REPORT 
STAGE, IN CONTRAST TO WELL-KNOWN U.S. PROJECTS -- A 
POINT GLEEFULLY MADE BY VIRTUALLY EVERYONE WE MET.

DIVISIONS 
 
REF: A) BEIRUT 5373, B) BEIRUT 4669 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DAVID M. SATTERFIELD. 
REASON 1.5 B AND D. 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  SPECULATION OVER A FUTURE ISRAELI 
WITHDRAWAL (UNILATERAL OR THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS) FROM 
SOUTH LEBANON HAS GIVEN RISE TO DIFFERENCES AMONG 
HIZBALLAH\'S SENIOR LEADERS ABOUT THE PARTY\'S FUTURE. 
THE PROSPECT OF CHANGE HAS COMPELLED THE PARTY TO 
BEGIN SPECIFIC PLANNING FOR THE ROLE IT WILL PLAY IN 
A POST-PEACE, POST-WITHDRAWAL LEBANON.  ITS CHOICE 
IS REALLY NO CHOICE AT ALL:  WHETHER TO ACCELERATE 
ITS DECADE-LONG TRANSFORMATION INTO A LEGITIMATE 
POLITICAL PARTY (YET ONE ALWAYS LIMITED BY ITS 
SECTARIAN IDENTIFICATION) OR TO REMAIN A FRINGE 
ELEMENT IN LEBANESE POLITICS (UNDER EITHER SCENARIO, 
WE EXPECT EFFORTS TO INSULATE AND PROTECT HIZBALLAH 
TERRORIST CELLS, FOR USE BY IRAN AND SYRIA AS 
TRAINERS AND AGENTS OUTSIDE LEBANON). 
 
2.  (C) THE RESUMPTION OF ISRAELI-SYRIAN 
NEGOTIATIONS HAS INTENSIFIED THE DEBATE WITHIN 
HIZBALLAH ABOUT IDENTIFYING AND SECURING ITS FUTURE 
ROLE IN LEBANON.  IN THIS UNCERTAIN ATMOSPHERE, 
HIZBALLAH SECRETARY-GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH HAS 
REMAINED THE LOCUS OF POWER FOR THE PARTY, AND LEADS 
THE MORE PRAGMATIC, POLITICAL WING.  HIS DEPUTY, 
NA\'IM QASSIM, AND MILITARY OFFICIAL MUHAMMAD YAZBAK 
LEAD A MORE EXTREME WING TOUTING THE LIBERATION OF 
JERUSALEM AS A NEW GOAL TO RALLY THE TROOPS, AND 
RESIST ANY TYPE OF REGIONAL NORMALIZATION WITH 
ISRAEL. 
 
3.  (C) IF PRAGMATISM WINS OUT, AND THIS APPEARS 
LIKELY (EVEN WITHOUT SYRIAN URGING), HIZBALLAH FACES 
CHALLENGES IN BROADENING ITS BASE, FINDING A NEW 
MESSAGE TO INSPIRE SUPPORT, AND TRANSFORMING ITS 
PUBLIC IMAGE FROM RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS AND MILITIAMEN 
TO RESPONSIVE, LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PLAYERS. 
REMAINING TRUE TO ITS ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES WILL MEAN 
AVOIDING NEPOTISM, CORRUPTION, AND AUTHORITARIANISM 
-- TRADITIONAL FEATURES OF LEBANESE POLITICS.  CAN 
HIZBALLAH DEVELOP A COHERENT, CREDIBLE AND APPEALING 
MESSAGE -- ANTI-NORMALIZATION, SOCIAL GOOD DEEDS, 
ADVOCACY OF THE \"DISPOSSESSED\" -- WHILE MANEUVERING 
IN THE SNAKEPIT OF LEBANESE POLITICS?   CAN IT 
RETAIN ITS POPULARITY AS IT CUTS THE DEALS WITH 
LEBANESE POLITICIANS AND SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS THAT GET MPS ELECTED, WITH INEVITABLE 
COMPROMISES, AND  TARNISHED REPUTATIONS?  CAN ITS 
OFFICERS DELIVER ON HIGH-HOPES OF REVOLUTIONARY 
CHANGE SHOULD ANY ONE OF THEM GAIN A MINISTRY -- 
ASSUMING THAT INCLUSION IN GOVERNMENT IS DESIRED? 
 
4.  (C) UNTIL NOW, HIZBALLAH HAS HAD THE BEST OF TWO 
WORLDS:  IT IS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PARTY WITH A 
STRONG BLOC IN PARLIAMENT, YET IT IS ALSO AN ARMED 
MILITIA WHICH GAINS ENORMOUS, CROSS-CONFESSIONAL 
POPULARITY FOR FIGHTING OCCUPATION WHEN THE STATE 
DID NOT.  A LONG ERA, WHICH ALLOWED THE PARTY TO 
HAVE ONE FOOT IN THE SYSTEM AND ONE FOOT OUTSIDE 
CHALLENGING THAT SYSTEM, IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE.  AS 
IT UNDERGOES THE DEFLATING PROCESS OF MOVING FULLY 
INTO LEGITIMATE POLITICS AND -- MOST IMPORTANTLY -- 
A CRITICAL DECISION ON RETAINING ITS TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES, THE PARTY MAY FIND IT HAD AN EASIER TIME 
FIGHTING THE IDF IN THE SOUTH.  THIS CABLE CONTINUES 
OUR SERIES ON SOUTH LEBANON ON THE EVE OF CHANGE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
HIZBALLAH: UNITY IN PUBLIC, DEBATE IN PRIVATE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) THROUGHOUT THE LEBANESE MEDIA\'S DAILY 
SPECULATION OVER THE FUTURE PROSPECT OF AN ISRAELI 
WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH LEBANON, HIZBALLAH HAS 
MAINTAINED A PUBLIC POSTURE OF UNANIMITY DECLARING 
THAT AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WILL NOT FUNDAMENTALLY 
CHANGE THE MOVEMENT\'S STRATEGY AND TACTICS. 
HOWEVER, CONVERSATIONS WITH SEVERAL LEBANESE 
OFFICIALS AND ACADEMICS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.  THE 
SENIOR LEADERSHIP OF HIZBALLAH (PRIMARILY THE SHURA 
COUNCIL, THE POLITICAL WING, THE MILITARY WING), HAS 
BEEN ENGAGED IN A \"VIGOROUS DEBATE,\" IN THE WORDS OF 
ONE AUB POLITICAL SCIENTIST, OVER HOW TO RESPOND TO 
AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  THE STRATEGIC DEBATE HAS 
FOCUSED ON HOW BEST TO REMAIN A VIABLE AND EFFECTIVE 
PART OF THE LEBANESE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN THE 
SOUTH, AS WELL AS KEY CONSTITUENCIES IN BEIRUT, 
SHOULD THE ACTIVE MILITARY RESISTANCE END. 
 
6.  (C) THE RESUMPTION OF THE ISRAEL-SYRIA TRACK OF 
THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS IS LIKELY TO INTENSIFY 
THE DEBATE WITHIN HIZBALLAH\'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP 
ABOUT ITS FUTURE ROLE IN LEBANON.  IN THIS DEBATE, 
SECRETARY-GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH CONTINUES TO 
MAINTAIN HIS DOMINANCE AS THE DE JURE AND DE FACTO 
HEAD OF THE PARTY.  HOWEVER, TWO CAMPS HAVE EMERGED 
OVER HOW TO DEAL WITH THE WITHDRAWAL.  NASRALLAH AND 
THE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT REPRESENT WHAT 
HAS BEEN TERMED THE \"PRAGMATIC\" WING OF THE PARTY 
THAT WISHES TO DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES TO HIZBALLAH\'S 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AGENDA IN BEIRUT, THE BIQA\', 
AND THE SOUTH ONCE THE IDF/SLA VACATE THEIR 
POSITIONS.  LEBANESE OBSERVERS DOUBT THAT NASRALLAH 
WISHES TO DISMANTLE THE MILITARY WING OF HIZBALLAH, 
BUT HE REALIZES HE MAY HAVE LITTLE CHOICE IF THERE 
IS A PEACE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND SYRIA. 
 
7. (C) A MORE EXTREMIST WING IS LED BY DEPUTY SECGEN 
NA\'IM QASSIM AND MILITARY COMMANDER MUHAMMAD YAZBAK. 
THIS WING WISHES TO MAINTAIN A HARD-LINE AGAINST THE 
ISRAELIS BY TRUMPETING THE ISSUE OF JERUSALEM AS ITS 
\"CAUSE CELEBRE,\" AND AGITATING AGAINST ANY TYPE OF 
NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL SHOULD A FUTURE PEACE 
TREATY BE SIGNED.  THIS WAS EVIDENCED BY QASSIM\'S 
NOVEMBER REMARKS TO HIZBALLAH SUPPORTERS IN 
BA\'ALBACK-HERMEL.  IN CONTRAST TO NASRALLAH\'S PARTY 
MAINSTREAM, THIS WING CONTINUES TO ENOUNCE THE GOALS 
OF THE 1979 IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND ITS EXPORT TO 
OTHER COUNTRIES -- ESPECIALLY LEBANON. 
 
8. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER, MUHAMMAD HUSAYN 
FADLALLAH, REPRESENTS ANOTHER LEADERSHIP AXIS.  HIS 
AGENDA LIES IN HIS ASPIRATION TO BE REGARDED AS THE 
\"MARJA\'IYYA\" (SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY) OF THE SHI\'A OF 
LEBANON (AND IDEALLY, THE WORLD).  FADLALLAH AND 
NASRALLAH ARE OFTEN AT ODDS, AND FADLALLAH HAS OVER 
THE YEARS DRIFTED AWAY FROM ANY DIRECT INVOLVEMENT 
WITH THE PARTY -- YET RETAINS CONSIDERABLE MORAL 
AUTHORITY OVER ITS RANK-AND-FILE, AND THUS CANNOT BE 
IGNORED BY ITS LEADERSHIP.  HOWEVER, HE TOO MUST BE 
MINDFUL OF DIVISIONS WITHIN THE PARTY; HIS OWN 
AMBITION TO BE REGARDED AS A SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY 
REQUIRES THAT HE NOT TAKE SIDES BETWEEN PRAGMATISTS 
AND HARD-LINERS. 
 
9. (C) THE PRAGMATIC/HARD-LINE RIFT BECAME PUBLIC 
KNOWLEDGE WITH FORMER SECRETARY GENERAL SUBHI 
TUFAYLI\'S \"REVOLT OF THE HUNGRY\" DURING 1996-1997. 
TUFAYLI\'S REVOLT WAS A FORK IN THE ROAD FOR 
HIZBALLAH OVER ITS FUTURE ACTIVITIES.  TUFAYLI\'S 
SCHOOL OF THOUGHT ARGUED FOR MORE MILITANT 
ENGAGEMENT IN LEBANESE AND REGIONAL POLITICS -- 
PRIMARILY INCREASED RESISTANCE ATTACKS IN THE SOUTH 
-- WHILE THE OTHER SCHOOL ENCOURAGED GREATER 
EMPHASIS ON HIZBALLAH SOCIAL AND CHARITABLE 
PROGRAMS, AND MORE ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
LEBANESE POLITICAL SYSTEM.  QASSIM AND YAZBAK ARE 
THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN MORE SYMPATHETIC TO TUFAYLI\'S 
OVERALL STAND REGARDING A MORE MILITANT POLITICAL 
AND MILITARY AGENDA, BUT WERE AWARE THAT OPENLY 
SIDING WITH THE FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL MEANT 
POLITICAL SUICIDE.  THE SQUELCHING OF TUFAYLI\'S 
REVOLT WITH SYRIAN SUPPORT IS EVIDENCE THAT 
HIZBALLAH\'S EXTREME FACTIONS DID NOT, AND WILL NOT 
PREVAIL. 
 
HIZBALLAH CONSIDERING FUTURE SCENARIOS 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) MUCH OF THE TACTICAL DISCUSSION OF THE 
FUTURE CENTERS ON THE TYPE OF WITHDRAWAL THE IDF 
WILL IMPLEMENT, HOW TO RESPOND TO IT, AND HOW TO 
MANEUVER IF A SYRIA-ISRAEL PEACE TREATY IS 
CONCLUDED.  THE ACTIVE MILITARY RESISTANCE HAS BEEN 
ONE OF THE KEY PILLARS OF HIZBALLAH\'S LEGITIMACY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS THROUGHOUT LEBANON AND REMOVING IT IS 
LIKELY TO SAP PARTY STRENGTH.  AS A RESULT, 
HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERS HAVE BEEN PONDERING WHAT SOUTH 
LEBANON WILL LOOK LIKE WITH AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL 
COUPLED WITH OVERT, OR COVERT, SYRIAN SECURITY 
GUARANTEES.  STUDY GROUPS HAVE BEEN FORMED TO 
DISCUSS FUTURE POSSIBILITIES.  IN PUBLIC, HASSAN 
NASRALLAH REMAINS SILENT OVER HOW HIZBALLAH WILL 
REACT TO A WITHDRAWAL, OR A FUTURE PEACE TREATY 
BETWEEN SYRIA AND ISRAEL.  HIZBALLAH\'S REACTION TO 
THE RECENT SLA SHELLING OF A SCHOOL IN ARAB SALIM 
(REF A) MAY BE TELLING OF THE FINE LINE THAT 
HIZBALLAH WALKS IN LEBANESE POLITICS.  NASRALLAH WAS 
QUOTED ON NOVEMBER 17 AS SAYING THAT THE ATTACK 
\"DESERVES RETALIATION BY THE RESISTANCE ON 
SETTLEMENTS IN NORTHERN PALESTINE...HOWEVER, FOR NOW 
WE WILL JUST SEND A CLEAR AND FIRM WARNING TO THE 
ENEMY.\"  THIS IS BUT THE LATEST EPISODE TO SHOW THAT 
THE MILITIA IS ON A TIGHT SYRIAN LEASH, AND WILL LAY 
DOWN ITS ARMS WHEN DOING SO SERVES SYRIAN INTERESTS. 
THE PARTY THEN FACES THE OBVIOUS CHALLENGE, BEGUN 
NINE YEARS AGO WHEN IT ENTERED PARLIAMENT, OF 
TRANSFORMING ITSELF INTO A LEGITIMATE AND APPEALING 
POLITICAL PLAYER, BUT WITHOUT THE UNIFYING FORCE OF 
ACTIVE RESISTANCE.  YET ENTERING THE FRAY MORE FULLY 
MEANS DEALING WITH THE SMALL COMPROMISES AND 
CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE LEBANESE POLITICS SUCH AN 
UNDIGNIFIED SPORT. 
 
CONTINUING THE POLITICAL COMPETITION WITH AMAL 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11. (C) LIKE ALL OTHER POLITICAL FACTIONS HERE, 
HIZBALLAH IS PREPARING FOR THE Y2000 PARLIAMENTARY 
ELECTIONS.  NABIH BERRI\'S AMAL MOVEMENT HAS CAPTURED 
THE SUPPORT OF MANY OF THE TRADITIONAL FAMILIES OF 
SOUTH LEBANON INCLUDING THE \'USAYRANS AND BAYDOUNS 
OF SIDON AND TYRE RESPECTIVELY.  THESE FAMILIES HAVE 
STRONG TIES TO BEIRUT\'S RULING CLASS AND SYRIAN 
LEADERSHIP CIRCLES, AND SURPRISING RESILIENCE IN THE 
SOUTH AS DELIVERERS OF LARGE BLOCS OF WHOLESALE 
VOTES.  ONE OPTION FOR HIZBALLAH IS TO COURT THE 
NEWEST EMERGING ECONOMIC GROUP IN THE SOUTH -- THOSE 
POORER LEBANESE WHO LEFT THE SOUTH AFTER 1978 AND 
MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN ABIDJAN, CONAKRY, AND 
DETROIT.  SOME OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE RETURNED HOME, 
OR AT LEAST BUILT PALATIAL SUMMER VILLAS TO LET 
PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE MADE IT.  MANY OF THESE 
CITIZENS PUT CASH INTO AMAL\'S COFFERS.  HOWEVER, 
HIZBALLAH COULD WOO THIS CLASS -- ALREADY TAPPED FOR 
PARTY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE ORPHANS 
AND MARTYRS FUNDS -- TO HELP SUSTAIN A POLITICAL 
PRESENCE IN THE SOUTH.  THEY COULD BECOME AN 
IMPORTANT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE SHOULD IRANIAN 
FINANCIAL RESOURCES DRY UP. 
 
12. (C) HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES IN 
COMPETING WITH AMAL.  WHILE NABIH BERRI HAS KEPT 
MANY OF THE LARGE, TRADITIONAL FAMILIES OF THE SOUTH 
IN HIS POCKET, MOST OF THAT SUPPORT IS BASED ON 
BERRI\'S PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH FAMILY HEADS, 
BERRI\'S \"CULT OF PERSONALITY,\" AND FEAR OF BERRI\'S 
WRATH.  HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IS SYRIAN 
ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.  THEY USUALLY 
ENCOURAGE FORMATION OF PRE-COOKED \"GRAND ALLIANCES\" 
AMONG ALL MAJOR, ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL FACTORS, 
HOWEVER UNNATURAL SUCH AN ALLIANCE MAY BE.  THUS THE 
WINNING SOUTHERN TICKET FOR Y2000 ELECTIONS 
UNDOUBTEDLY WILL INCLUDE A PRE-DETERMINED NUMBER OF 
CANDIDATES FROM BOTH AMAL AND HIZBALLAH, WITH A 
SPRINKLING OF TRADITIONAL FAMILY ELDERS, WHO CAN 
DELIVER VOTES AND MONEY. 
 
13. (C) HIZBALLAH HAS TRUE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, THE BIQA\', AND IN THE SOUTHERN 
SUBURBS.  BUT THE NUMBER OF SEATS IT WILL GAIN IN 
THE HOUSE WILL BE A PRODUCT OF THE PRE-BALLOT, BACK 
ROOM NEGOTIATIONS WITH BERRI AND SYRIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF FOR LEBANON, GHAZI KANAAN OVER 
DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS IN THE \"GRAND ALLIANCE.\" 
KANAAN IS EXPECTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT HIZBALLAH WILL 
HAVE EARNED A FEW ADDITIONAL SEATS THIS YEAR (THREE, 
SAYS CURRENT SPECULATION:  TWO IN THE BIQA\' AND ONE 
IN THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS).  COMBINED WITH ANTICIPATED 
EFFORTS BY PRESIDENT LAHOUD TO CUT BERRI (A MAJOR 
OBSTACLE TO REFORMS) DOWN A NOTCH, Y2000 MAY BE A 
GOOD ELECTORAL YEAR FOR HIZBALLAH.  HOWEVER, THE 
RESULTS WILL HAVE ONLY A NOTIONAL CONNECTION WITH 
THE PARTY\'S VOTE-GATHERING CAPACITY.  THEY WILL ALSO 
BE A HARBINGER OF THE COMPROMISES AND 
DISAPPOINTMENTS, WHICH THE PARTY WILL FEEL AS IT 
MORE FULLY ENGAGES ITS ENERGIES IN THE LEBANESE 
POLITICAL FRAY.  (NOTABLY, OUR AMAL CONTACTS 
INDICATE AN EXPECTATION THAT IF A PEACE WITH ISRAEL 
PRECEDES ELECTIONS, DAMASCUS WILL HAVE LESS NEED FOR 
HIZBALLAH, AND BE MORE INTERESTED IN PROMOTING 
BERRI, GIVEN HIS GREATER UTILITY TO SYRIA IN 
LEBANESE DOMESTIC POLITICS.) 
 
A CABINET SEAT TO SWEETEN TRANSITION? 
------------------------------------- 
 
14. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S RELATIONS WITH THE GOL HAVE 
FURTHER FUELED DEBATE WITHIN ITS SENIOR LEADERSHIP 
ABOUT THE FUTURE.  HIZBALLAH FIRST BEGAN ITS LONG- 
TERM INVESTMENT IN LEGITIMACY WHEN IT ENTERED 
PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS, AND PARLIAMENT, IN 1992. 
THEY HAVE, HOWEVER, NOT BEEN OFFERED A CABINET SEAT 
-- IN PART BECAUSE OF RELUCTANCE ON THE PART OF THE 
HARIRI AND HOSS GOVERNMENTS TO BRING THEM IN AND IN 
PART DUE TO STRONGLY EXPRESSED U.S. OPPOSITION. 
PRESIDENT LAHOUD HAS COURTED THE PARTY (IN PART TO 
ANNOY NABIH BERRI, IN PART BECAUSE IT SEEMS POPULAR, 
AND IN PART BECAUSE HE THINKS IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER 
FOR HIM TO MANAGE THE PARTY LATER).  MUCH OF 
HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL AGENDA PARALLELS 
LAHOUD\'S -- ANTI-CORRUPTION, ADDRESSING SOCIAL 
PROBLEMS, AND CREATING VIABLE STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
IN APRIL, LAHOUD SPOKE AT \"THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE 
TO SUPPORT THE RESISTANCE\" EMPHASIZING THAT THE 
RESISTANCE IS NOT LIMITED TO A SINGLE PARTY, BUT IS 
PART OF A MUCH LARGER NATIONAL MOVEMENT. 
 
15.  (C) THIS ONGOING DANCE WILL RAISE EXPECTATIONS 
THAT THE PARTY WILL BE OFFERED A CABINET SEAT, TO 
RECOGNIZE ITS ROLE IN LIBERATING THE SOUTH AND AS A 
SWEETENER AS THE MILITIA DISARMS (THIS WAS THE 
TACTIC USED IN 1991 WITH MOST OTHER LEBANESE 
MILITIAS, AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR).  BUT IT IS 
NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER NASRALLAH IS PREPARED TO TAKE 
THE PLUNGE OF ENTERING THE CABINET -- THEREBY ENDING 
HIZBALLAH\'S ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE ITSELF FROM 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS IT MAY NOT APPROVE.  IN 
GOVERNMENT, HIZBALLAH WOULD FACE AN INEVITABLE 
PROCESS OF COOPTION.  IT WOULD BE DIRECTLY 
CHALLENGED TO PROVE THAT IT CAN DELIVER ON ITS 
PROMISES FOR SOCIAL WELFARE AND CHANGE, YET WOULD 
HAVE LITTLE REAL AUTHORITY, GIVEN THE CONSTRAINED 
NATURE OF LEBANON\'S CABINET SYSTEM. 
 
16. (C) WITH RESISTANCE GONE, HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE TO 
ADAPT TO A DIFFERENT POLITICAL-MILITARY SITUATION IN 
THE SOUTH, AS WELL AS BEIRUT.  HIZBALLAH WILL DEVOTE 
MORE RESOURCES TO ITS POLITICAL WING (A TREND 
ALREADY UNDERWAY).  IT HAS DROPPED -- BUT NOT 
REPUDIATED -- ITS CALL FOR AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC (A 
NON-STARTER IN A LAND OF MINORITIES).  HIZBALLAH HAS 
REACHED OUT TO CHRISTIAN PARTIES AND THE MARONITE 
PATRIARCH TO PROMOTE ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN LIKE 
ANTI-CORRUPTION AND TAX REFORM, AND POLITICAL 
DIALOGUE.  THIS PROCESS OF \"DE-DEMONIZATION\" OF THE 
PARTY AMONG CHRISTIANS IS WORKING, IF THE 
INFATUATION OF MANY OF THE MARONITE PATRIARCH\'S 
ADVISOR WITH THE DIALOGUE IS ANY GUIDE. 
 
17. (C) BUT WHAT WILL BE THE NEW MAINSPRING FOR THE 
PARTY?  ABSENT THE UNITING FORCE OF MILITARY 
RESISTANCE OR OF A CREDIBLE AGENDA FOR ISLAMIC 
CHANGE IN THIS PLURALISTIC SOCIETY, WHAT WILL BE 
HIZBALLAH\'S MESSAGE?  UNDOUBTEDLY, IT WILL FOCUS ON 
OPPOSING NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL, ON ANTI- 
CORRUPTION AND FAMILY VALUES, AND ON ADVOCACY OF THE 
POOR AND DISPOSSESSED SHI\'A OF THE SOUTH, BIQA\', AND 
BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN SUBURBS (THE ORIGINAL PLATFORM 
INSPIRING FORMATION OF AMAL MOVEMENT).  HIZBALLAH 
CAN MORE CREDIBLY PROMOTE THESE OBJECTIVES THAN ANY 
OTHER PARTY IN LEBANON.  HOWEVER, THE SECTARIAN 
NATURE OF LEBANESE POLITICS, REFEREED BY SYRIA, 
MEANS ANY SHI\'A PARTY WILL HAVE ONLY ON A NARROW 
PIECE OF THE PLAYING FIELD.  UNDER THIS CONDITION, 
IT CANNOT ASPIRE TO NATIONAL LEADERSHIP. 
 
COMING TO TERMS WITH CHANGE 
--------------------------- 
 
18. (C) HIZBALLAH IS NOT LIKELY TO FADE ONCE ISRAEL 
WITHDRAWS, BUT IT WILL FACE THE SAME TYPES OF 
CHALLENGES THAT OTHER LEBANESE POLITICAL ENTITIES 
FACE, AND THE IN-BUILT INHIBITING FACTOR OF 
REPRESENTING ONLY ONE RELIGIOUS SECT AMONG 17 IN 
LEBANON.  CHALLENGES INCLUDE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL 
RIVALRIES WITHIN THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY AND SYRIAN 
DOMINATION OF LEBANESE POLITICS.  BROADENING ITS 
BASE OF POLITICAL SUPPORT AND TRANSFORMING ITS 
PUBLIC IMAGE FROM RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS AND MILITIAMEN 
TO RESPONSIVE, LEGITIMATE POLITICAL PLAYERS WILL 
REMAIN THE PARTY\'S KEY CHALLENGES FOLLOWING AN 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL.  OTHER ISLAMIC PARTIES IN THE 
REGION HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS TRANSFORMATION FROM 
EXTREMISM TO THE MAINSTREAM, IN EGYPT, JORDAN, AND 
TURKEY.  REMAINING TRUE TO ITS ISLAMIC PRINCIPLES 
WILL MEAN AVOIDING THE NEPOTISM, CORRUPTION, AND 
AUTHORITARIANISM OF TRADITIONAL LEBANESE POLITICAL 
PARTIES.  HIZBALLAH WILL HAVE TO MANEUVER MORE 
ACTIVELY IN THE SNAKE PIT OF LEBANESE POLITICS, AND 
MAY WELL FIND IT HAD AN EASIER TIME FIGHTING THE IDF 
IN THE SOUTH. 
 
19.  (C) THIS PROCESS IS LIKELY TO CREATE A PARTY 
THAT FINDS ITS SELF-INTEREST REQUIRES MODERATION, 
NOT EXTREMISM, AND INSULATION FROM PARTY TERRORIST 
CELLS AND TERRORIST ASSOCIATIONS WHICH IRAN AND THE 
HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP ITSELF MAY SEEK TO PRESERVE IN 
LEBANON TO ADVANCE AIMS ABROAD.  SHOULD HIZBALLAH 
FIND A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. -- OR SIMPLY OUR 
RECOGNITION AS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL/SOCIAL 
ORGANIZATION -- IN ITS INTERESTS (AT PRESENT, ALL 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE GROUP HAS NO INTEREST IN 
CONTACT WITH THE USG, EVEN IF WE WERE WILLING), IT 
WILL HAVE TO ABANDON ALL INVOLVEMENT WITH TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES HERE AND ELSEWHERE, ON ITS OWN PART AND 
THROUGH ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER GROUPS. 
 
20.  (C) AS WITH IRAN ITSELF, HIZBALLAH WILL SEEK TO 
MAINTAIN ITS DUALITY OF CONDUCT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. 
AND AS WITH IRAN, WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE 
CLEAR TO ALL CONCERNED -- INCLUDING THE GOL -- THAT 
THE U.S. WILL NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN AN 
\"ACCEPTABLE\" HIZBALLAH AND THE HIZBALLAH WHICH IS 
INVOLVED IN TERROR.  IN THIS REGARD, WE ARE 
CONCERNED AT GROWING EVIDENCE THAT HIZBALLAH\'S 
INVOLVEMENT -- IN COORDINATION WITH IRAN -- WITH 
GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS AND THE PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD 
IS INCREASING, NOT DIMINISHING AS A RESOLUTION OF 
SOUTH LEBANON AND AN END TO THE LEBANESE RESISTANCE 
RAISON D\'ETRE APPROACHES.

CLASSIFIED BY AMB. DAVID SATTERFIELD.  REASON: 1.5 
(B, D) 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  AMAL MOVEMENT AND HIZBALLAH HAVE 
MADE A SYRIAN-INDUCED DEAL TO DISTRIBUTE SEATS AMONG 
THEMSELVES IN THE UPCOMING PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. 
IF THE DEAL HOLDS, HIZBALLAH WOULD HAVE A NET GAIN 
OF TWO SEATS, PLUS A STRONGER FIGURE IN A THIRD ONE. 
THESE EXPEDIENT PAIRINGS ARE TYPICAL OF LEBANESE 
LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGNS AND SYRIAN MACHINATIONS.  THIS 
YEAR, DAMASCUS SEEMS EAGER TO SEW UP WINNING 
COALITIONS NOW, BEFORE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, TO ENSURE 
THAT THE POLITICAL STATUS QUO IS PRESERVED AND TO 
MINIMIZE INTERNAL LEBANESE RIVALRIES.  HOWEVER, MANY 
OF THESE DEALS ARE BEING CUT SO EARLY, AND SO 
UNNATURALLY, THAT THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO HOLD TOGETHER 
UNTIL THE LATE SUMMER ELECTION.  BOTH HIZBALLAH AND 
AMAL MOVEMENT BELIEVE THEY CAN DO BETTER, AND GET 
MORE SEATS, POST-WITHDRAWAL:  HIZBALLAH BECAUSE OF 
THEIR \"VICTORY\" OVER ISRAEL, BERRI BECAUSE HE THINKS 
NEWLY LIBERATED CHRISTIANS IN THE SECURITY ZONE WILL 
VOTE FOR HIM AS THE STRONGEST ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
PARTY OF GOD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) THE HORSETRADING AND DEALMAKING ASSOCIATED 
WITH LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATE LISTS HAS BEEN UNDERWAY 
FOR SOME TIME, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE UP UNTIL THE 
EVE OF THE PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN EARLY AUGUST. 
AMONG THE MORE INTERESTING ELECTION DEVELOPMENTS IS 
WITHIN THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  THE SYRIANS HAVE GOD- 
FATHERED AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN AMAL MOVEMENT, LED BY 
PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER NABIH BERRI, AND HIS ARCH- 
RIVAL, HIZBALLAH. 
 
3. (C) ACCORDING TO ALI KHALIL, AMAL MP FROM TYRE 
AND THE PARTY\'S CAMPAIGN COORDINATOR FOR THE 
ELECTIONS, AMAL AND HIZBALLAH STRUCK THEIR DEAL IN 
FEBRUARY.  AMAL AND HIZBALLAH CANDIDATES WILL RUN ON 
A SINGLE LIST IN THE SOUTH, ACHIEVING MUTUAL 
AGREEMENT ON ALL NOMINEES FOR THE 23 SEATS THERE. 
NATIONWIDE, THE DEAL CALLS FOR A NET INCREASE OF TWO 
SEATS FOR HIZBALLAH, FROM NINE TO ELEVEN IN 
PARLIAMENT, BRINGING BACK INTO PARLIAMENT EX-MPS ALI 
AMMAR AND MUHAMMAD BERJAWI.  THE CHANGES WOULD COME 
AT THE EXPENSE OF AN INDEPENDENT SHI\'A IN BEIRUT 
CLOSE TO PM HOSS (EDUCATION MINISTER BEYDOUN) AND A 
SHI\'A FROM BAABDA ALLIED WITH HARIRI (EX-INFORMATION 
MINISTER SABA), THEREBY SPREADING THE PAIN AMONG 
OTHER ALLIES OF SYRIA.  IN ADDITION, NAZIH MANSUR, 
AN MP FROM BINT JUBAYL ALLIED TO HIZBALLAH, WOULD 
REPUTEDLY BE REPLACED BY A CARD-CARRYING PARTY 
MEMBER.  KHALIL SAID AMAL AND HIZBALLAH HOLD REGULAR 
ELECTION MEETINGS NOW TO COORDINATE CAMPAIGNS, 
EVIDENCE OF AN AT LEAST SUPERFICIAL EFFORT TO FORGE 
A TRUE PRAGMATIC ALLIANCE. 
 
4. (C) EVERY ELECTORAL YEAR, AMAL AND HIZBALLAH COME 
TO TERMS -- VIA SYRIAN MEDIATION -- ON A \"FAIR\" 
DISTRIBUTION OF SEATS.  IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE 
ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE SO EARLY THIS YEAR, AND 
THAT AMAL APPEARS WILLING TO CONCEDE THAT IT IS 
HIZBALLAH\'S TURN TO GROW.  JUDGING FROM THE 
ELECTORAL LAW AND THE ACTIVITIES OF SYRIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF FOR LEBANON GHAZI KANAAN, SYRIA\'S 
GOAL FOR THE 2000 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IS IN 
GENERAL THE STATUS QUO.  POLITICAL RIVALRIES LIKE 
THE ONE BETWEEN HIZBALLAH AND AMAL CAN ESCALATE INTO 
OPEN POWER STRUGGLES, POSSIBLY OPENING UP THE 
COMPETITION TO ANTI-SYRIAN ELEMENTS, SUCH AS FORMER 
SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD, WHOSE POWER BASE IS IN THE 
SECURITY ZONE.   BERRI\'S APPARENT WILLINGNESS TO 
CONCEDE ANY EXPANDED PRESENCE IN PARLIAMENT TO 
HIZBALLAH IS ALSO NOTABLE (HIS 19-MEMBER 
PARLIAMENTARY BLOC HAS ONLY  FOUR AMAL MEMBERS; THE 
OTHER 15 ARE LOOSE ALLIES.)  WHILE AMAL MOVEMENT 
REMAINS THE ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE FOR POLITICS IN 
SOUTH LEBANON, YEARS OF CORRUPTION HAVE DISCREDITED 
THE PARTY.  BERRI MAY HAVE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOCK IN 
A MODEST GAIN FOR HIZBALLAH NOW, RATHER THAN FACE 
HIZBALLAH DEMANDS FOR A GREATER SHARE OF THE SEATS 
AFTER THE EXPECTED SURGE IN POPULARITY FOR HIZBALLAH 
AT OCCUPATION\'S END. 
 
5. (C) SOUTHERN MPS YASSINE JABER AND SAMIR AZAR, 
ALLIES OF AMAL MOVEMENT, TOLD US SEPARATELY THAT THE 
AMAL-HIZBALLAH COALITION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A 
UNILATERAL WITHDRAWAL, HAS QUESTIONABLE LONGEVITY. 
THEY MAINTAIN BERRI WAS NOT COMPLETELY CONVINCED 
THAT ISRAEL WOULD ACTUALLY WITHDRAW UNTIL RECENTLY. 
AS REALITY SINKS IN, HIS CALCULATIONS ARE CHANGING. 
THEY CLAIM BERRI ASSUMES THAT NEWLY-LIBERATED 
CHRISTIANS OF THE SOUTH WILL LOOK TO HIM FOR 
REPRESENTATION, NOT HIZBALLAH, WHICH IS FEARED AS 
THE PARTY OF POSSIBLE RETRIBUTION.  HIZBALLAH\'S 
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS SLA AMNESTY PROPOSAL IN PARLIAMENT 
IS SEEN AS AN ABANDONMENT OF ITS EFFORT TO APPEAL TO 
SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN VOTES. 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. (C) SYRIAN HANDLERS FOR LEBANON MADE EVERY SIGN 
OF WANTING TO SEW UP THE ELECTION RESULTS EARLY ON. 
THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOL IN THIS PROCESS IS TO COMPEL 
ALLIANCES BETWEEN NATURAL RIVALS IN EACH DISTRICT 
WHICH EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE COMPETITION AND GIVE 
\"FIXED MENU\" COALITION OFFERINGS TO THE VOTERS.  IN 
SOME DISTRICTS FRACTIOUS LEBANESE, EVEN THOSE ON 
EXCELLENT TERMS WITH DAMASCUS, ARE DEFEATING THIS 
AIM, AS THE BARGAINING MELEE CONTINUES.  THIS HAS 
BEEN ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN THE NORTH, WHERE 
TRADITIONAL POWER CENTERS OF UMAR KARAME, SULEIMAN 
FRANJIYAH, AND NAYLA MUAWID CONTINUE TO MANEUVER IN 
WAYS WHICH UNDERMINE COALITION LIST FORMATION. 
 
7. (C) IN THE SOUTH, BERRI HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR 
HIM.  OF THE TWO PARTIES, HIZBALLAH CAN EASILY 
OUTSPEND AMAL.  IT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOR BERRI TO 
MARKET AMAL TO THE LIBERATED SECURITY ZONE.  AFTER 
DECADES OF OCCUPATION, DESTRUCTION, AND AN ABYSMAL 
ECONOMY, PEOPLE WANT ASSISTANCE, NOT RHETORIC. 
HIZBALLAH COULD GAIN SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL GROUND 
FROM AMAL IF, FOLLOWING AN IDF WITHDRAWAL, IT 
ACCENTUATES CONSTITUENT SERVICES.  HOWEVER, IN ITS 
PERPETUAL GAME OF PLAYING FACTIONS AGAINST EACH 
OTHER, THE SYRIAN REGIME MAY SEE A NEED TO DEFLATE 
HIZBALLAH FOLLOWING AN ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, TO KEEP 
IT OFF BALANCE AND DEPENDENT.  BERRI IS THE ONLY 
RELIABLE TOOL AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO COUNTER 
HIZBALLAH, AN ARGUMENT HE NO DOUBT MAKES IN 
DAMASCUS. 
 
8. (C)  ONE WILD CARD IS THE SUPPORT RETAINED BY 
KAMAL AL-ASAD.  ALTHOUGH A SEEMINGLY DISCREDITED 
SYMBOL OF THE OLD GUARD, VIEWED AS TOO ACCOMMODATING 
TO ISRAEL, ASAD POLLED A RESPECTABLE 30% OF THE VOTE 
IN 1992 AND 40% IN 1996, AGAINST THE AMAL/HIZBALLAH 
ALLIANCE LIST.  HIS APPEAL IN THE SECURITY ZONE -- 
THE FAMILY\'S TRADITIONAL POWER BASE -- IS UNTESTED 
BUT NO DOUBT STRONG.  ENSURING HE REMAINS FIRMLY AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE ELECTORAL SWEEPSTAKES IS A GOAL 
SHARED IN COMMON BY SYRIA, BERRI, AND HIZBALLAH.

REFS: A) BEIRUT 3914, B) BEIRUT 3962 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR DAVID M. SATTERFIELD. REASON 
1.5 B AND D. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  FORMER PM HARIRI IS EXPECTED TO BE 
NAMED VERY SHORTLY AS LEBANON\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER, 
WITH A NEW CABINET PRESENTED FOR PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL 
WITHIN THE WEEK.  THE GREEN LIGHT FOR HARIRI\'S 
APPOINTMENT WAS GIVEN BY SYRIA FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE 
CONSULTATIONS IN CAIRO AND HERE OVER THE WEEKEND, WITH 
ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF MINISTERIAL PORTFOLIOS AND 
CANDIDATES AGREED UPON.  SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR IS 
REPORTED TO HAVE PROVIDED OVERALL POLITICAL BLESSING TO 
THE DEAL AND ITS SELLING TO LEBANESE PRESIDENT LAHOUD, 
WHILE SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEBANON BOSS KANAAN 
HANDLED THE DETAILS WITH HIS LEBANESE COUNTERPART JAMIL 
AL-SAYYID.  WHILE SOME KEY PORTFOLIOS -- NOTABLY FINANCE 
-- REMAIN IN SUSPENSE BETWEEN HARIRI, LAHOUD AND SPEAKER 
BERRI, THE OUTLINES OF A NEW GOVERNMENT NOW APPEAR SET. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------- 
HARIRI GETS THE SYRIAN NOD 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (C) OUTGOING PM HOSS MET WITH AMBASSADOR OCTOBER 23 
TO DISCUSS LEBANESE-SYRIAN MEETINGS DURING THE COURSE OF 
THE CAIRO ARAB SUMMIT AND AGREEMENT REACHED ON 
COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT LEBANESE GOVERNMENT (OTHER 
TOPICS SEPTEL).  A VISIBLY RELAXED AND UNUSUALLY VOLUBLE 
PM HOSS TOLD AMBASSADOR THAT PRESS REPORTING WAS 
CORRECT; FORMER PM HARIRI WOULD BE NAMED AS HIS 
SUCCESSOR EVENING OCTOBER 23/MORNING OCTOBER 24, 
FOLLOWING PRO-FORMA CONSULTATIONS BY LAHOUD WITH THE 
PARLIAMENT.  (NOTE:  AT TIME OF DRAFTING, HARIRI HAD 
RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT OF 87 DEPUTIES (128 TOTAL). 
THE HIZBALLAH BLOC REFUSED TO BACK ANY CANDIDATE AND ARE 
NOW WIDELY EXPECTED TO REMAIN OUT OF THE CABINET.  END 
NOTE.)  WHILE LAHOUD HAD INDEED ATTEMPTED (REF A) TO 
DEFER THE DECISION AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, HOSS SAID THAT 
BASHAR AL-ASAD HAD BROUGHT MATTERS TO A HEAD IN CAIRO, 
PARALLELING SETS OF MEETINGS OVER THE WEEKEND HERE 
BETWEEN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE LEBANON HEAD GHAZI 
KANAAN AND PM HARIRI/DRUZE LEADER JUMBLATT/SPEAKER NABIH 
BERRI. 
 
3. (C) HOSS SAID THAT BASHAR\'S ROLE WAS NOT IN THE 
DETAILS -- \"HE HAS NO IDEA WHO MOST OF THE NEXT CABINET 
APPOINTEES ARE\" -- BUT IN GIVING HIS BLESSING TO THE 
BROAD OUTLINES OF THE GOVERNMENT AND SELLING THE DEAL TO 
LAHOUD.  THE SPECIFICS ON NAMES AND PORTFOLIOS HAD BEEN 
MANAGED, HOSS SAID, BY LEBANESE GENERAL SECURITY CHIEF 
JAMIL AL-SAYYID (IN CAIRO WITH LAHOUD) AND KANAAN. 
WHILE KAANAN WORKED THE PLAYERS ON THE GROUND IN 
LEBANON, SYRIAN VP KHADDAM AND FM SHARA DEALT DIRECTLY 
WITH AL-SAYYID TO PRESENT A NEAR-FINAL PACKAGE TO 
LAHOUD.  COMMENTING ON KHADDAM\'S ROLE, HOSS EXPLAINED 
THAT BASHAR WAS CONCERNED THAT HARIRI WOULD ATTEMPT TO 
USE HIS \"TRADITIONAL SYRIAN ALLIES\" (READ KHADDAM AND 
FORMER COS SHIHABI) TO MANEUVER FOR GREATER FREEDOM OF 
ACTION.  BASHAR HAD THEREFORE BROUGHT KHADDAM VISIBLY 
INTO THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE NEW LEBANESE CABINET 
AT HIS AND KAANAN\'S SIDE, \"SO HARIRI WOULD UNDERSTAND 
THAT HE CANNOT PLAY ALTERNATE CHANNELS.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
FINANCE AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS STILL IN PLAY 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) COMMENTING ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE NEXT 
CABINET, HOSS SAID THAT NEITHER HARIRI NOR LAHOUD GOT 
EVERYTHING (OR EVERYONE) THEY WANTED, BUT ON BALANCE THE 
GOVERNMENT \"SHOULD PROVE GENERALLY HOMOGENEOUS.\"  THAT 
SAID, SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES REMAINED IN SUSPENSE.  IN 
PARTICULAR, HARIRI WAS INSISTING ON THE RIGHT TO APPOINT 
HIS CANDIDATE (ECONOMIC CONSULTANT BASIL FLEIHAN) AS 
MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND BERRI WAS PUSHING FOR 
THE JOB TO GO TO A SHIA.  HARIRI HIMSELF WOULD BE 
FINANCE MINISTER, AS IN HIS LAST GOVERNMENT.   LAHOUD 
OBJECTED TO HARIRI OR BERRI PLACING THEIR LOYALIST IN 
THE FINANCE MINSTATE POST, AND THE SYRIANS -- HOSS 
CLAIMED -- HAD NOT SETTLED THE ISSUE.  THE OTHER MAJOR 
UNRESOLVED PORTFOLIO WAS FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  HOSS SAID 
THAT A FORMER CAREER DIPLOMAT AND BERRI SUPPORTER, 
MAHMOUD HAMMOUD (NOW RETIRED; LAST POST WAS AMBASSADOR 
TO LONDON), WAS THE PRIME SHIA CANDIDATE -- BUT IT WAS 
STILL A MARGINAL POSSIBILITY THAT THE MARONITES (BALKING 
AT HAVING TO SETTLE FOR THE MEANINGLESS DEFENSE 
MINISTRY) WOULD WIND UP WITH JOB. 
 
------------------------------ 
ONE MURR OUT; ANOTHER MURR IN? 
------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) CONTRADICTING EARLIER INDICATIONS (REF B), 
PRESENT DEPUTY PM AND INTERIOR MINISTER MICHEL MURR 
APPEARS TO BE OUT OF THE NEXT GOVERNMENT, REPLACED -- IN 
THE BEST LEBANESE TRADITION -- BY HIS SON, ELIAS.  HOSS 
SAID THAT HARIRI INSISTED ON OUSTING MURR SENIOR; THE 
SYRIANS, HOWEVER, BACKED MURR\'S DEMAND FOR COMPENSATION 
AND HAD AGREED TO LAHOUD\'S REQUEST THAT MURR THE YOUNGER 
(LAHOUD\'S SON-IN-LAW AND ADVISOR) TAKE HIS FATHER\'S 
PLACE AT THE INTERIOR MINISTRY.  WHILE THIS RESOLVED THE 
MURR ISSUE, HOSS NOTED THAT IT CREATED A NEW PROBLEM FOR 
BASHAR ALLY (AND 2004 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL) SULEIMAN 
FRANJIYEH, JR.  FRANJIYEH HAD COVETED INTERIOR AND WOULD 
NOW, IT APPEARED, HAVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH A LESSER 
POST -- POSSIBLY A RETURN TO THE HEALTH MINISTRY. 
REPLACING MURR AS DEPUTY PM WOULD BE NEWLY-ELECTED 
DEPUTY AND MULTI-MILLIONAIRE ISSAM FARES. 
 
-------------------------- 
BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN? 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (C) REFLECTING ON THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOSS TOLD 
AMBASSADOR THAT HE RECOGNIZED POPULAR DISAPPOINTMENT 
THAT MORE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY HIS 
GOVERNMENT.  HOSS DOUBTED, HOWEVER, THAT HARIRI\'S LUCK 
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER.  HOSS EXPECTED THAT, WHATEVER THE 
SHAPE OF THE NEW CABINET, LEBANON\'S DESTRUCTIVE 
CONFESSIONAL AND SELF-SERVING PERSONAL POLITICS WOULD 
ASSERT THEMSELVES AND THWART \"EVEN HARIRI\'S\" EFFORTS. 
IN ADDITION, HOSS EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL VIEW THAT 
LAHOUD AND HARIRI WOULD \"BE AT EACH OTHER\'S THROATS\" 
WITHIN MONTHS -- LEADING TO CONTINUOUS SYRIAN 
INTERVENTION TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES.  IN THE END, HOSS 
SAID THAT HE BELIEVED DAMASCUS WAS NOT UNAWARE OF THE 
LIKELY NEGATIVE COURSE AHEAD.  IF HARIRI WAS BURNED, 
THROUGH FAILURE TO RESOLVE LEBANON\'S ECONOMIC CRISIS, 
THEN \"ALTERNATIVES\" WOULD EMERGE TO TAKE HIS PLACE. 
HOSS SAW NAJIB MIQATI (CERTAIN TO BE IN THE NEW 
GOVERNMENT) AS THE MOST LIKELY REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE, 
BUT NOTED \"MAYBE I WILL BE BACK SOMEDAY IN THIS OFFICE, 
TOO.\" 
 
--------------- 
WHO RUNS SYRIA? 
--------------- 
 
7. (C) AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MEETING, HOSS ADVISOR 
MAHMASANI, WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE PM IN CAIRO, TOOK 
AMBASSADOR ASIDE.  MAHMASANI SAID THAT THE PM AND LAHOUD 
HAD BEEN \"VERY SURPRISED\" AT THE DEGREE TO WHICH BASHAR 
HAD NOT APPEARED \"IN CHARGE\" DURING THE MEETINGS WITH 
THE LEBANESE SIDE.  SHARA AND KHADDAM HAD DOMINATED THE 
SHOW, WITH BASHAR SHOWING ONLY A \"VERY BASIC GRASP\" OF 
LEBANESE PERSONALITIES AND ISSUES.  AMBASSADOR NOTED 
THAT THIS APPEARED VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH HAFIZ AL- 
ASAD\'S MANNER OF DEALING WITH THE LEBANESE, LEAVING 
DETAILS TO SUBORDINATES.  MAHMASANI CONCEDED THE POINT, 
BUT REITERATED WHAT HE TERMED \"OUR PERCEPTION\" THAT THE 
OLD GUARD IN DAMASCUS, INCLUDING \"THE MOST RETROGRADE 
ELEMENTS OF THE BA\'ATH REGIONAL COMMAND,\" WERE RUNNING 
THE SHOW -- NOT BASHAR.

REF: A) BEIRUT 136, B) 00 BEIRUT 4295 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAVID HALE.  REASON 1.5 B&D. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER/AMAL MOVEMENT 
HEAD NABIH BERRI, CORNERED BY SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR 
HARIRI\'S STRUCTURAL REFORMS WHICH WILL HARM HIS 
PATRONAGE MACHINE, IS TRIMMING SAILS.  HE HAS MET WITH 
ARCH-RIVAL HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH AND COMPROMISES ON 
TWO BONES OF CONTENTION ARE EMERGING.  FIRST, THEY 
HAVE CUT A DEAL IN WHICH A PRO-AMAL FIGURE BECOMES THE 
HEAD OF THE HIGHER ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL (SPIRITUAL 
LEADER OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTROLLER OF CLERICAL 
APPOINTMENTS AND FUNDS) WHILE A PRO-HIZBALLAHI GAINS 
THE DEPUTY SLOT.  SECOND, THEY HAVE WORKED OUT 
DIFFERENCES BLOCKING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER 
ISRAELI SECURITY ZONE, AND WILL FORGE A MADE-IN-SYRIA 
ALLIANCE WHICH WILL BLOCK OUT ANY THIRD FORCES, SUCH 
AS FORMER SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD.  THESE COMPROMISES IN 
PART REFLECT BERRI\'S SENSE OF POLITICAL VULNERABILITY, 
BUT ALSO A SIGN THAT HIZBALLAH IS COMING BACK DOWN TO 
EARTH AFTER THE HEADY POST-LIBERATION DAYS. 
NASRALLAH\'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA 
-- WHILE IT HAS PUT HIM ON THE MAP REGIONALLY -- HAS 
GAINED THE PARTY LITTLE IN THE DEEPLY ANTI-PALESTINIAN 
SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  THE RESULT IS A TEMPORARY, TACTICAL 
ALLIANCE WHICH WILL NOT CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE IN THE 
SOUTH, BUT MAY REDUCE INTERNAL SHI\'A TENSIONS FOR THE 
MOMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER/AMAL MOVEMENT HEAD NABIH 
BERRI HAS BEEN ON THE POLITICAL DEFENSIVE.  MOST 
RECENTLY, HE HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ACCEPT POTENTIALLY 
SWEEPING STRUCTURAL REFORMS ADVOCATED BY PM HARIRI 
WHICH WILL UNDERCUT A MAJOR SOURCE OF HIS POWER, 
PATRONAGE.  THE GOVERNMENT JOBS OF THOUSANDS OF HIS 
FOLLOWERS ARE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK -- ALBEIT 
INCUMBENTS WILL GET GOLDEN HANDSHAKES -- AS THE PRICE 
HARIRI HAS SAID MUST BE PAID TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN 
LEBANON\'S ECONOMY AND FINANCES.  BERRI\'S CLIMBDOWN IS 
GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO PRESSURE FROM DAMASCUS, WHOSE 
LOCAL OPERATIVES HAVE BEEN VISIBLE SUPPORTERS OF 
HARIRI\'S REFORM AGENDA. 
 
3. (C) AN UNUSUAL MEETING BETWEEN BERRI AND HIZBALLAH 
SECGEN NASRALLAH MAY REFLECT BERRI\'S RESPONSE TO HIS 
REDUCED CIRCUMSTANCES.  IT IS SAID THAT TWO 
COMPROMISES EMERGED ON ISSUES DIVIDING AMAL AND 
HIZBALLAH AND THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY:  THE SUCCESSION TO 
IMAM MUHAMMAD MAHDI SHAMS AD-DIN, WHO DIED IN JANUARY, 
AND ORGANIZATION OF MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER 
ISRAELI SECURITY ZONE. 
 
4. (C) SHAMS AD-DIN\'S POSITION AS SHI\'A SPIRITUAL 
LEADER AND HEAD OF THE HIGHER ISLAMIC SHI\'A COUNCIL 
(HISC) HAS BEEN FILLED BY HIS DEPUTY, AS ACTING 
CHAIRMAN, ABDEL AMIR QABALAN.  QABALAN IS A PRO-AMAL 
CLERIC WITH LITTLE NATIONAL FOLLOWING OR RESPECT 
(REFTEL).  ACCORDING TO A TOP HISC ADVISOR, BERRI AND 
NASRALLAH AGREED THAT QABALAN SHOULD BE ELECTED 
CHAIRMAN, AND A NEW, PRO-HIZBALLAH DEPUTY APPOINTED TO 
FILL QABALAN\'S POSITION -- AND BE POSITIONED TO BECOME 
CHAIRMAN WHENEVER QABALAN PASSES FROM THE SCENE. 
HIZBALLAH\'S CANDIDATE IS SHEIKH MOHAMED YAZBEK, THE 
LOCAL \"PERSONAL\" REPRESENTATIVE OF AYATOLLAH KHAMENEI 
(ALTHOUGH IRANIAN FM KHARRAZI WAS SAID DURING HIS 
VISIT LAST WEEK TO HAVE SAID TEHRAN FAVORED ANY 
CANDIDATE WHO GAINED CONSENSUS SUPPORT FROM AMAL AND 
HIZBALLAH.  AMAL IS STILL PUBLICLY SUPPORTING A RIVAL 
CANDIDATE, BAALBAK MUFTI KHALIL SHUQAIR, BUT A KEY 
CONTACT SAID THE DEAL HAS BEEN CUT FAVORING YAZBEK. 
THESE APPOINTMENTS MATTER BECAUSE OF HISC\'S CONTROL 
OVER ALL SHI\'A CLERICAL APPOINTMENTS AS WELL THE 
RELIGIOUS ENDOWMENTS, ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, AND AZ-ZAHRA 
HOSPITAL.  IN THE PAST, HIZBALLAH OFFICIALS WERE 
DISMISSIVE THE OF THE COUNCIL, AND RELIED ON THEIR OWN 
ASSETS TO PROMOTE SUPPORT.  HOWEVER, LOOKING TO THE 
DAY OF REDUCED IRANIAN SUPPORT, HIZBALLAH FIGURES MAY 
NOW FIND ACCESS TO HISC PATRONAGE AND MONEY MORE 
ATTRACTIVE. 
 
5. (C) THE SECOND COMPROMISE INVOLVED AGREEMENT ON 
PROCEEDING WITH MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN THE FORMER 
SECURITY ZONE, WHICH WILL BE THE FIRST SINCE 1963. 
THEIR CONSENSUS, BASED ON A MADE-IN-SYRIA ELECTORAL 
ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES, CLEARS THE WAY FOR 
SEPTEMBER POLLS.  THE TWO PARTIES\' DIVISION OF THE 
SPOILS WITH AGREED LISTS OF PRE-CHOSEN CANDIDATES WILL 
ENSURE A MINIMUM OF SURPRISES, AS WELL AS MINIMAL 
LOCAL CONFLICT BETWEEN ARMED SUPPORTERS.  KEY WILL BE 
TO SHUT OUT THIRD FORCE COMPETITORS, SUCH AS FORMER 
SPEAKER KAMAL AL-ASAD, WHO IS ANATHEMA IN DAMASCUS BUT 
RETAINS A CONSIDERABLE CORE OF SUPPORT IN THE FORMER 
ZONE. 
 
6. (C) KHIAM MP/AMAL MEMBER ALI HASSAN KHALIL 
CHARACTERIZED TO US THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS 
AS CRUCIAL FOR THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF THE REGION 
AFTER ALMOST A QUARTER-CENTURY OF ARTIFICIAL, 
EXTERNALLY-IMPOSED POLITICS.  THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS 
WOULD PREVIEW ANY NEW POLITICAL BLOOD THAT MAY COME TO 
THE FOREFRONT.  HOPING TO NIP THAT INDEPENDENT STRAIN 
IN THE BUD, DAMASCUS HAS ENCOURAGED BOTH SHIA PARTIES 
TO \"COORDINATE\" THEIR ELECTION STRATEGIES AND 
CANDIDATE LISTS.  TO DATE, KHALIL HAS HELD SOME SIX 
MEETINGS WITH HIZBALLAH POLITICAL ADVISOR, HUSSEIN 
KHALIL.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CONSENSUS ON ANY 
ISSUE, DAMASCUS WILL ENSURE THAT A UNIFIED POSITION 
WILL ARISE COME ELECTION DAY. 
 
7. (C) DESPITE THE FIERCE RIVALRY BETWEEN THE TWO 
PARTIES, BOTH AMAL NOR HIZBALLAH GAIN IN THIS 
COALITION.  AMAL IS A HOLLOWED OUT PARTY, STRIPPED OF 
ITS CIVIL WAR ERA LEGITIMACY BY POST-WAR CORRUPTION. 
WHILE ITS LONG POLITICAL EXPERIENCE AND SECULAR 
APPROACH REMAIN ATTRACTIVE DRAWS TO THE SHIA 
COMMUNITY, PATRONAGE HAS BEEN KEY TO BERRI\'S SUCCESS - 
- AND HARIRI\'S REFORMS ARE AT LEAST TEMPORARILY 
DILUTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT WEAPON FOR HIM. 
HIZBALLAH, ON THE DOWNSWING FROM THE HEADY DAYS OF THE 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL, IS SAID TO HAVE ENCOUNTERED SOME 
CRITICISM FROM SOUTHERNERS, WHO DISAGREE WITH THE 
PARTY\'S ADVOCACY OF THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA, 
UNWILLING TO GET DRAWN BACK INTO VIOLENCE WITH ISRAEL 
ON BEHALF OF UNPOPULAR PALESTINIANS.  VOICES ARE ALSO 
HEARD SAYING THAT HIZBALLAH HAS FAILED TO FILL THE 
SERVICE VACUUM LEFT BY THE STATE, AND HAVE SHOWN TO BE 
NO BETTER THAN OTHER LEBANESE POLITICAL FORCES WHICH 
FAIL TO DELIVER.

1. (C) SUMMARY:  IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHATAMI MET ON 
APRIL 25 WITH HIZBALLAH SYG HASSAN NASRALLAH AND 
PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER/AMAL LEADER NABIH BERRI ON THE 
MARGINS OF THE TEHRAN-SPONSORED CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT 
OF THE AL-AQSA INTIFADA.  KHATAMI LAVISHED PRAISE ON 
HIZBALLAH AND WAS SOMEWHAT MORE RESERVED WITH AMAL, 
THOUGH BERRI SCORED A VICTORY OF SORTS WITH THE 
RE-OPENING OF THE AMAL OFFICE IN TEHRAN.  FIRMLY 
FIXED BEHIND HIZBALLAH IN FUNDING AND POPULARITY, 
INCREASED IRANIAN ATTENTION AND PLEDGES OF FUNDING FOR 
RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTH ARE OPPORTUNITIES BERRI IS 
EAGER TO EXPLOIT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) AS BLUSTERING RHETORIC CONTINUED TO EMANATE 
FROM THE CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE INTIFADA HELD IN 
TEHRAN, IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHATAMI HELD MEETINGS ON 
APRIL 25 WITH HIZBALLAH SYG HASSAN NASRALLAH AND 
SPEAKER/AMAL CHIEF, NABIH BERRI.  LAUDING HIZBALLAH AS 
\"THE SPARKLING AND SHINING JEWEL IN THE SKY OF THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD,\" KHATAMI HAILED THE PARTY AS A \"MODEL\" 
FOR RESISTING ISRAELI AGGRESSION AND OCCUPATION. 
PRAISING THE SACRIFICES HIZBALLAH, ITS MARTYRS, AND 
SUPPORTERS HAVE MADE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THEIR 
RESISTANCE, KHATAMI CALLED ON THE PARTY TO CONTINUE 
SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS, \"THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE 
ISLAMIC UMMA.\"  POINTING TO THE GROUP\'S \"SUCCESS\" IN 
FORCING ISRAEL TO WITHDRAW FROM SOUTH LEBANON, KHATAMI 
NOTED \"AN ENEMY THAT WAS DEFEATED ONCE COULD BE 
DEFEATED AGAIN.\"  IN RESPONSE, NASRALLAH STRESSED ARAB 
AND ISLAMIC UNITY WAS NEEDED TO CONFRONT THE \"ANGERED 
ZIONIST ENTITY,\" AND TO ENSURE ADEQUATE MEANS TO 
SUPPORT THE INTIFADA AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. 
 
3. (U) FOLLOWING ON THE HEELS OF NASRALLAH WAS BERRI. 
SOMEWHAT OUT OF PLACE AT A CONFERENCE CHAMPIONING THE 
PALESTINIAN CAUSE, BERRI NONETHELESS SEIZED AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL ADVANCEMENT. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, HE THANKED KHATAMI FOR 
ALLOWING AMAL TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN TEHRAN; KHATAMI 
REPLIED \"IRAN IS YOUR OFFICE.\"   DOLING OUT AN OUNCE 
OF PRAISE FOR LEBANON\'S \"OTHER\" SHIA PARTY, KHATAMI 
THANKED AMAL FOR ITS \"STEADFASTNESS,\" AND BERRI FOR 
HIS \"GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION,\" REMARKING \"WE 
ALWAYS BENEFIT FROM MEETINGS WITH YOU.\"  BERRI WILL 
NO DOUBT SEEK TO USE THIS MEETING TO ASSOCIATE 
HIMSELF WITH ANY INCREASED STATE-TO-STATE FINANCIAL

CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE DAVID HALE.  REASON 1.5 B&D 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  LAST WEEK\'S UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE IN 
ISRAEL DREW WIDESPREAD CONDEMNATION FROM GOL 
OFFICIALS, THE MEDIA, HIZBALLAH, AND MUSLIM LEADERS. 
THE JULY 31 ATTACK AT NABLUS INTENSIFIED ANTI-ISRAELI 
RHETORIC, WHILE SPARKING CRITICISM OF THE U.S. 
HIZBALLAH CONDEMNED THE ISRAELI ATTACKS AND CALLED 
UPON ARAB STATES TO USE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
PRESSURE TO FORCE THE U.S. TO CHANGE ITS REGIONAL 
POLICY.  LEBANON\'S MOST PROMINENT SUNNI RELIGIOUS 
LEADER CALLED UPON THE ISLAMIC WORLD TO SUPPORT THE 
PALESTINIANS WHILE WAGING JIHAD TO PROTECT THE HOLY 
SITES IN JERUSALEM.  FORCED TO WATCH THE INTIFADA FROM 
THE SIDELINES, LEBANON\'S PALESTINIANS VENTED THEIR 
FRUSTRATIONS THOUGH A WEEK-LONG SERIES OF MARCHES AND 
RALLIES IN REFUGEE CAMPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  THE AL- 
AQSA MARTYRS BRIGADE, A RADICAL OFFSHOOT OF FATAH, 
WARNED OF ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELI AND U.S. TARGETS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) GOVERNMENT SPEAKS UP.  KNOWN FOR EXPRESSING 
ONLY THE MOST PERFUNCTORY SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIAN 
CAUSE, THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK 
OUT AFTER LAST WEEK\'S VIOLENCE IN JERUSALEM, THE WEST 
BANK, AND GAZA.  IN WHAT WAS FOR HIM A RARE PUBLIC 
EXPRESSION ON THE MATTER, PM HARIRI KICKED OFF THE 
WAVE OF GOL CRITICISM, CALLING ISRAEL\'S JULY 29 
\"ASSAULT\" ON THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE \"AN ATTEMPT TO EXPUNGE 
THE ARAB AND ISLAMIC IDENTITY\" FROM THE SITE. 
RETURNING TO A MORE MUTED TONE, PM HARIRI RESPONDED TO 
THE JULY 31 ATTACK IN NABLUS BY WARNING, \"THE FLOW OF 
BLOOD IS ABOUT TO THREATEN THE WHOLE REGION,\" AND 
CALLED ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO STOP THE 
MASSACRE OF PALESTINIANS. 
 
3. (U) SPEAKER/AMAL LEADER NABIH BERRI DELIVERED A 
HARSHER DENUNCIATION, CALLING THE ISRAELI ACTION \"THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL OF STATE TERRORISM.\"  SEEKING TO BOLSTER 
AMALQS POSITION IN THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN 
THE SOUTH, BERRI TOOK A SWIPE AT THE U.S., POINTEDLY 
NOTING THAT THE ISRAELIS \"USED THE MOST SOPHISTICATED 
AMERICAN WEAPONS.\"  ALONE OF THE TROIKA, PRESIDENT 
LAHOUD MADE NO COMMENT ON THE NABLUS ATTACK. 
 
4. (U) HIZBALLAH LASHES OUT AT U.S.  HIZBALLAH 
RESPONDED TO THE UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE WITH A VOLLEY OF 
SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS.  CALLING THE DEFENSE OF 
JERUSALEM \"A SACRED RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY MUSLIM AND 
ARAB,\" HIZBALLAH ARRANGED MARCHES AND PROTESTS ALONG 
THE LEBANON-ISRAEL BORDER TO PRESS THEIR PONT HOME. 
AFTER THE NABLUS KILLINGS, HOWEVER, HIZBALLAH LAUNCHED 
A FIERY ASSAULT AGAINST THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 
CLAIMING IT BEARS \"DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY\" FOR THE 
KILLINGS \"THROUGH THE SUPPORT IT EXTENDS TO THE 
ZIONIST ENTITY, AND THE JUSTIFICATION IT PROVIDES FOR 
THEIR CRIMES.\"  ALTHOUGH ACKNOWLEDGING SECRETARY 
POWELL\'S CRITICISM OF ISRAEL\'S POLICY OF TARGETED 
KILLINGS, SHIA CLERIC HUSAYN FADLALLAH IMPLIED THAT 
U.S. CONCERN WAS NOT GENUINE BECAUSE \"U.S. VICE 
PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY DESCRIBED THE MASSACRES AS SELF 
DEFENSE BY THE ISRAELIS... AND PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH 
CALLED FOR SELF-RESTRAINT AS IF THE PALESTINIANS WERE 
EQUALLY THE SOURCE OF THE VIOLENCE.\"  REITERATING HIS 
CALL FOR AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT ON THE U.S., FADLALLAH 
ALSO CALLED UPON THE ARABS TO \"EXERT PRSSURE ON 
AMERICAN TROOPS IN THE GULF TO MAKE WASHINGTON 
CONCERNED ABOUT ITS POLICIES AND INTERESTS IN THE ARAB 
AND MUSLIM WORLDS.\" 
 
5. (U) PUNDITS ALSO BLAME US, EXPECT WIDER CONFLICT. 
CRITICIZING THE NABLUS ATTACK AS A \"BLOODY MASSACRE\" 
MANY LEBANESE NEWSPAPERS CARRIED GRUESOME CLOSE-UP 
PHOTOS OF THE CHILDREN KILLED IN THE ISRAELI 
OPERATION.  ALTHOUGH THE SECRETARY\'S CRITICISM OF THE 
ATTACK DREW FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE, EDITORIALISTS TENDED 
TO BLAME THE U.S. FOR WHAT THEY SEE AS A WORSENING 
CRISIS.  IN AN EDITORIAL ENTITLED, \"THE REGION IS 
ABOUT TO EXPLODE\" PRO-LAHOUD DAILY, AL-BAYRAQ WROTE, 
\"SHARON WILL BE SATISFIED WITH HIS JOB AS LONG AS HE 
RECEIVES AMERICAQS BLESSING... THE ATMOSPHERE OF WAR 
IS GETTING HEAVIER AND... SHARON IS PUSHING THE REGION 
TOWARDS THE ABYSS... HOWEVER, ONLY WASHINGTON IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SITUATION.\" 
 
6. (U) SUNNIS JOIN THE FRAY.  AS THE WEEK DREW TO A 
CLOSE, THE HIGHEST-RANKING SUNNI FIGURE IN LEBANON, 
GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH MOHAMED RASHID QABBANI, ADDRESSED A 
GROUP OF 500 DEMONSTRATORS TO GARNER SUPPORT FOR THE 
PALESTINIANS.  DEPICTING THE CURRENT VIOLENCE AS A 
FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF MUSLIM SITES, QABBANI CALLED UPON 
ALL MUSLIMS TO JOIN THE JIHAD AGAINST ISRAEL BECAUSE 
IT \"INTENDS TO DESTROY THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE IN ORDER TO 
BUILD ITS ALLEGED TEMPLE ON TOP OF IT.\"  QABBANI 
PROMISED THAT \"WHEN THE TIME COMES, WE WILL JOIN YOU 
IN UPROOTING THE ISRAELI STATE.  WHEN THAT DAY COMES, 
NEITHER THEIR HELICOPTERS, NOR THEIR FLEETS NOR 
SUPPORTING POWERS WILL BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM.\" 
 
7. (U) PALESTINIAN PROTESTS.  PALESTINIANS IN LEBANON 
STAGED A SERIES OF PROTESTS AND SIT-INS THROUGHOUT THE 
WEEK.  THE OCCUPANTS OF THE AYN AL-HELWEH CAMP STAGED 
THE LARGEST DEMONSTRATION ON AUGUST 1, WITH NEARLY 
5,000 REFUGEES -- SOME 100 OF THEM REPORTEDLY ARMED -- 
TAKING TO THE STREETS OF THE CAMP.  THEY CHANTED DEATH 
THREATS TO SHARON, BURNT ISRAELI AND AMERICAN FLAGS, 
AND CARRIED BANNERS THREATENING TO \"LIQUIDATE\" 
PALESTINIAN COLLABORATORS.  SMALLER DEMONSTRATIONS 
WERE HELD IN SHATILA, BADDAWI AND RASHIDIYEH CAMPS, 
WHERE PROTESTORS CALLED FOR AN ESCALATION OF THE 
INTIFADA AND DEMANDED THAT THE ARAB STATES FULFILL 
THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE PALESTINIANS. 
 
8. (U) RADICALS THREATEN THE U.S.  THE AL-AQSA MARTYRS 
BRIGADE, A RADICAL OFF-SHOOT OF FATAH, DELIVERED A 
LETTER TO THE AFP OFFICES IN BEIRUT ON AUGUST 1 
CLAIMING THEIR \"FIGHTERS\' WEAPONS WOULD BE POINTED 
TOWARDS TARGETS INSIDE THE ZIONIST ENTITY AND IN ALL 
PLACES WHERE ITS AMERICAN ALLIES ARE.\"  THE GROUP 
PROMISED TO INFLICT A \"BLOODY INTERNATIONAL PUNISHMENT 
ON PRESIDENT BUSH\'S ZIONIST CLIQUE TO MAKE IT PAY FOR 
ITS SUPPORT TO SHARON.\" 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: WHILE SUPPORT FOR THE PALESTINIANS 
REMAINS (AT BEST) LETHARGIC IN LEBANON, PUBLIC 
SYMPATHY FOR THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE IS ON THE RISE 
GIVEN THE PAST WEEK\'S ENDLESS STREAMS OF MEDIA 
COVERAGE DEPICTING THE VICTIMS OF ISRAELI ROCKET, TANK 
AND SHOOTING ATTACKS.  CONFLICT AT AL-AQSA ALSO HITS A 
POPULAR CHORD IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, RALLYING 
POLITICIANS AND RELIGIOUS FIGURES TO TAKE A STRONG 
PUBLIC STAND -- OR RISK BEING LEFT BEHIND.

SUBJECT: TFUS01:  LEBANESE EXPRESS OUTRAGE AND SYMPATHY, 
APPEAL TO CONTAIN SENTIMENT AGAINST ARABS AND MUSLIMS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT BATTLE.  REASON 1.5 B&D 
 
1. (C)  SUMMARY.  AS THE MASSIVE SCALE OF TRAGEDY UNFURLED 
DRAMATICALLY ACROSS THE WORLD, LEBANESE OF ALL PERSUASIONS 
OFFERED FRESH OUTPOURINGS OF CONDEMNATION AND SYMPATHY FOR 
THE ATTACKS ON AMERICA.  ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF OFTEN 
FRACTIOUS SECTARIAN GROUPS, THE NATION UNITED IN THE 
CONVICTION THE ATTACKS WERE MORALLY REPUGNANT.  PRESIDENT 
LAHOUD, WHILE ACCEPTING AMBASSADOR\'S CREDENTIALS SEPTEMBER 
12, STRESSED LEBANON\'S DISAGREEMENT WITH ATTACKS ON INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS, WHILE PM HARIRI VOWED TO SUPPORT THE U.S. IN 
RESPONDING TO TERROR.  AT THE SAME TIME, HARIRI AND MANY 
OTHERS FEAR THE INVESTIGATION WILL CREATE A MENTALITY OF 
REVENGE AGAINST ARABS AND MUSLIMS.  THEY HOPE THE U.S. WILL 
INSTEAD FOLLOW UP ON THE SECRETARY\'S VOW TO INCLUDE MUSLIMS 
IN A COALITION TO FIGHT TERROR.  WE FOUND CONCERN IN SOME 
QUARTERS THAT ISRAEL WILL USE THE RECENT ATTACK AS A COVER 
FOR ACTION IN LEBANON.  CAPITALIZING ON THE RARE POLITICAL 
CONSENSUS, LEBANON\'S MYRIAD RELIGIOUS LEADERS UNLEASHED 
APPARENTLY HEARTFELT SENTIMENT TO CONDEMN THE ATTACKS, 
CALLING THEM UGLY, INHUMAN AND UNJUST.  IN A SURPRISING MOVE, 
HIZBALLAH\'S DE FACTO SPIRITUAL LEADER, SHAYKH HUSAYN 
FADLALLAH, HARSHLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS AS WELL AS THE 
CONCEPT OF JIHAD AGAINST CIVILIANS.  FADLALLAH\'S STATEMENT 
MAY NOT REPRESENT HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP, WHICH REMAINS 
SILENT ON THE EVENTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------ 
OFFERS OF SUPPORT, FEARS OF BACKLASH 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C)  CLOSELY FOLLOWING EVENTS IN WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK, 
LEBANESE (AND LEBANESE-AMERICANS) OF ALL BACKGROUNDS CONTINUE 
TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR HORROR AND GRIEF, WITH LEBANESE 
OFFICIALS LEADING THE PACK.  REINFORCING YESTERDAY\'S OFFICIAL 
STATEMENT AND REMARKS TO THE AMBASSADOR (WHILE ACCEPTING HIS 
CREDENTIALS), PRESIDENT LAHOUD SPOKE OUT AGAIN LATE SEPTEMBER 
12 TO EXPRESS \"LEBANON\'S SORROW FOR THE TRAGIC RESULTS OF THE 
DRAMATIC EVENTS IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON.\"  SPEAKING IN A 
CNN INTERVIEW ON SEPTEMBER 12, PRIME MINISTER HARIRI VOWED 
THAT LEBANON STANDS READY TO HELP THE U.S., NOTING \"EVERYONE 
IS SUFFERING AND FEELS THE SHOCK AND PAIN OF VICTIMS AND 
FAMILIES.\"  HE ADDED THAT THE GOL WOULD SUPPORT ANY U.S. 
DECISION TO PUNISH THOSE RESPONSIBLE, AS LONG AS CONCRETE 
EVIDENCE CONFIRMED GUILT.  WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT CELEBRATIONS 
IN PALESTINIAN CAMPS, HARIRI SAID THAT SUCH CELEBRATIONS DID 
NOT REPRESENT THE FEELINGS OF THE MAJORITY OF ARABS OR 
MUSLIMS, WHO WERE HORRIFIED BY \"ATTACKS THAT VIOLATE 
EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE IN.\" 
 
3.  (C)  HARIRI, IN A MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 
13, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT HINTS OF ARAB INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
ATTACKS, AND SKEWED COVERAGE OF ARAB/MUSLIM REACTIONS, COULD 
LEAD TO A PUNITIVE U.S. ATTACK THAT WOULD PARALYZE RELATIONS 
WITH THE ARAB WORLD.  IMPLYING THE U.S. MIGHT CONSIDER A MOVE 
AGAINST AFGHANISTAN TO AIM AT BIN LADEN, HE SAID THAT A 
PRECIPITOUS ATTACK IN THE MUSLIM WORLD WOULD REVERBERATE VERY 
BROADLY.  AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED TO THE PM AND IN COMMENTS TO 
THE PRESS THAT THE U.S. WOULD REPSECT THE RULE OF LAW AND 
ENSURE A TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION, ONLY PASSING JUDGMENT ON 
THE BASIS OF AN EVIDENTIARY PROCESS. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CONCERN OF ISRAELI ACTIONS ON BLUE LINE 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  IN PHONE CALLS, FAXES, AND OFFICIAL CONDOLENCE 
CALLS, MANY HUNDREDS OF LEBANESE OFFERED BLOOD, CASH, AND 
SHELTER.  THEIR GRIEF IS GENUINE, TRANSCENDING POLITICAL 
UNDERCURRENTS THAT OFTEN COLOR SUCH \"POPULAR\" ACTIONS.  MANY 
HAVE TOLD US \"THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. IS AN ATTACK ON US ALL.\" 
 (INDEED, LEBANESE-AMERICANS ARE ALREADY AMONG THE VICTIMS.) 
AMID THE CONDOLENCES, LEADERS ARE ASKING WHAT EFFECT THE 
ATTACKS WILL HAVE ON LEBANON.  SEVERAL SPECULATE THEY WILL 
CREATE A MORE PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ISRAEL, WHILE U.S. 
AND WORLD ATTENTION IS DIVERTED.  THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE DAILY 
STAR RAN THE HEADLINE \"ATTACKS IN AMERICA MAY BE FELT HERE: 
ISRAEL TO HAVE A FREE HAND IN THE EVENT OF TROUBLE ALONG (ITS 
NORTHERN) BORDER.\"  NABIH BERRI WAS AMONG THOSE WHO WERE 
WARILY CASTING THEIR EYES SOUTHWARD, POINTING TO \"ISRAELI 
PROPAGANDA AND INDICATIONS ON THE GROUND\" AS EVIDENCE THE GOI 
MAY AGGRAVATE LEBANON.  TURNING TO THE U.S. ANGLE IN HIS 
MEETING WITH THE AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 13, BERRI SAID HIS 
FAMILY IN THE U.S. WAS ALREADY FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A NEW 
ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
THE CLERGY SPEAKS OUT, FADLALLAH SURPRISES 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (U)  IN A RARE DISPLAY OF UNITY, LEBANON\'S RELIGIOUS 
COMMUNITY, UNIFORMLY CONDEMNED THE ATTACKS.  SPEAKING FOR THE 
SUNNI, LEBANON\'S GRAND MUFTI SHAYKH MOHAMED QABBANI CONDEMNED 
THE ATTACK AS AN \"UGLY TERRORIST ACTION AIMED AT INNOCENT 
PEOPLE.\"  MARONITES PATRIARCH SFEIR EXPRESSED SORROW THAT THE 
\"INCIDENT\" TOOK PLACE, DESCRIBING IT AS \"SHOCKING AND 
INHUMAN.\"  IN TURN, THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF THE HIGHER 
ISLAMIC SHIA COUNCIL (HISC) SHAYKH ABDEL AMIR QABALAN SAID 
THAT THE ATTACKS ARE CONDEMNABLE ON BOTH RELIGIOUS AND LEGAL 
GROUNDS, ADDING THAT \"INNOCENT CIVILIANS SHOULD BE LEFT 
UNSCATHED FROM POLITICAL DISPUTES.\" 
 
6.  (U) CAPPING THE THEOLOGIANS\' DISPLAY OF UNITY, 
HIZBALLAH\'S SPIRITUAL LEADER, HUSAYN FADLALLAH, DELIVERED A 
GROUND-BREAKING SPEECH ON SEPTEMBER 12 WHICH CONDEMNED THE 
ATTACKS, AND REFUTED THE LEGITIMACY OF JIHAD AGAINST 
CIVILIANS.  BYPASSING HIZBALLAH\'S PROPAGANDA ARM, AL-MANAR -- 
POSSIBLY INDICATING THAT THE GROUP DOES NOT AGREE WITH HIS 
POSITION -- FADLALLAH TOLD LEBANESE TV THERE WAS NO 
JUSTIFICATION UNDER ISLAMIC LAW FOR THE ATTACKS IN NEW YORK 
AND WASHINGTON.  SAYING \"NO RATIONAL PERSON CAN ACCEPT ANY 
PEOPLE BEING EXPOSED TO WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
EXPOSED TO.\"  HIMSELF AN AUTHOR OF FATWAS IN SUPPORT OF 
HIZBALLAH TERRORIST OPERATIONS, FADLALLAH CHALLENGED THE CORE 
CONCEPT OF JIHAD SAYING, \"THERE IS NO ROOM TO SUPPORT ANY 
KIND OF ATTACK ON CIVILIANS OF ANY RELIGION.  THERE IS NO 
DECLARED WAR BETWEEN ANY PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS ATTACK, AND 
THUS THEY ARE COMPLETELY INNOCENT.  MUSLIMS ARE NOT 
TERRORISTS.\"  STEPPING EVEN FURTHER AFIELD, THE SHIA LEADER 
EMPHASIZED \"WE REJECT METHODS OF THIS SORT.\"  IN AN EVEN 
RARER OUTREACH TO THE U.S. -- FADLALLAH HAS BEEN LEADING THE 
CALLS FOR A LEBANESE BOYCOTT OF AMERICAN PRODUCTS -- HE 
ACKNOWLEDGED HIS DIFFERENCES WITH THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION\'S 
POLICY, BUT ADDED, \"WE WANT TO REACH OUT TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO ESTABLISH JUST POLICIES ON SECURITY, ECONOMICS, AND 
POLITICS.\"  ALSO OUT OF CHARACTER, HIZBALLAH LEADERS CONTINUE 
TO REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON THE NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON 
ATTACKS.  MOREOVER, THE GROUP MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELED A RALLY 
SCHEDULED FOR SEPTEMBER 12 IN BEIRUT\'S SOUTHERN SUBURBS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7. (C)  COMMENT:  WHILE THE SHOCK AND HORROR HAVE BEEN 
VIRTUALLY UNIVERSAL IN LEBANON, AS TIME PASSES WE EXPECT THE 
FOCUS WILL SHIFT TO THE ISRAELI POLITICAL/MILITARY CALCULUS 
IN SOUTHERN LEBANON AND THE POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS OF A 
FEARED RETALIATORY ATTACK BY THE US AGAINST MIDEAST/MUSLIM 
PERPETRATORS.  WHILE PM HARIRI\'S OFFER OF SUPPORT IS GENUINE, 
ANY REQUESTS FOR GOL ACTION WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM 
OF LEBANON\'S LOCAL AND REGIONAL POLITICS, WHICH MAY PROVE A 
DIFFICULT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE GOL.  COMMENTS BY 
FADLALLAH (COUPLED WITH HIZBALLAH SILENCE AND ASAD\'S 
CONDEMNATION), ARE PERHAPS AN ATTEMPT TO DISTANCE HIZBALLAH 
FROM THIS ATTACK ON CIVILIANS AND DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THEIR 
OWN CONFLICT WITH ISRAEL.  LEBANON SURELY WOULD ASSIST THE 
USG IF THE PERPETRATORS PROVE TO BE SUNNI EXTREMISTS, 
PARTICULARLY BIN LADEN.  HOWEVER, THE GOL LIKELY WILL ONLY 
RESPOND IF WE LINE UP A COALITION THAT IS FOCUSED ONLY ON 
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT PROVE DIRECTLY CULPABLE IN THESE 
ATTACKS.  THE QUESTION FOREMOST ON THE MINDS OF LEBANESE 
LEADERS TODAY IS WHETHER THE U.S. COALITION TO FIGHT THIS 
BRAND OF TERRORISM WILL INCLUDE THEM OR BE LINED UP 
FORESQUARE AGAINST THEM.  END COMMENT.

REF: A. BEIRUT 3002 
     B. BEIRUT 2965 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: DCM CAROL R. KALIN.  REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  IN DISCUSSING HIZBALLAH\'S SIGNIFICANCE WITH 
THE AMBASSADOR DECEMBER 7, SPEAKER BERRI SAID THAT AMAL WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL \"ACTIONS\" PRIOR TO ISRAEL\'S 1984 
WITHDRAWAL FROM BEIRUT.  HE PREDICTED THAT HIZBALLAH WOULD 
CONTINUE TO LAUNCH CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS UNTIL A COMPREHENSIVE 
PEACE WAS REACHED.  BERRI ARGUED THAT ARAFAT WAS TOO WEAK TO 
COMBAT TERRORISM, AND WARNED OF CIVIL WAR AMONG THE 
PALESTINIANS.  ON THE ECONOMY, BERRI CLAIMED THAT HE DID NOT 
OPPOSE PRIVATIZATION, BUT WOULD USE HIS ROLE AS SPEAKER TO 
INFLUENCE THE PRIORITIZATION OF ECONOMIC REFORM MEASURES. 
BERRI THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS DECEMBER 3 TOUR OF SOUTH 
LEBANON FOCUSED ON DEMINING ISSUES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) HIZBALLAH\'S ROLE:  DURING A DECEMBER 7 MEETING WITH 
SPEAKER NABIH BERRI, AMBASSADOR, ACCOMPANIED BY LEBANON DESK 
OFFICER TIM POUNDS AND POLOFF, SOLICITED BERRI\'S VIEW ON 
WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT HIZBALLAH MAY BE REASSESSING ITS 
TACTICS.  BERRI SAID THAT THE PATH HIZBALLAH CHOOSES WOULD 
DEPEND ON THE COURSE OF U.S.-IRANIAN RELATIONS. RECALLING 
HIZBALLAH SYG\'S DECEMBER 1 REMARKS THAT SHEBA\' FARMS WERE NOT 
THE ONLY OCCUPIED LEBANESE TERRITORY (REF A), BERRI PREDICTED 
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO END TO CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS UNTIL 
THERE WAS A COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT.  HE ASSERTED THAT 
\"THE ISSUE IS WITH THE SYRIANS,\" AND GIVEN SYRIA\'S INFLUENCE 
IN LEBANON, THEIR \"BROTHERLY RELATIONS\" AND THE TWO 
COUNTRIES\' REJECTION OF SEPARATE PEACE AGREEMENTS, A 
CESSATION OF ATTACKS WAS UNLIKELY.  BERRI SAID THAT ISRAEL 
HAS INFLATED HIZBALLAH\'S STANDING BY CREDITING IT WITH ACTS 
COMMITTED BY AMAL OR OTHER GROUPS.  BERRI VOLUNTEERED THAT 
AMAL WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL \"ACTIONS\" PRIOR TO THE 1984 
ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM BEIRUT. 
 
3. (C) BERRI NOTED THAT THE TRADITIONAL RIVALRY BETWEEN 
HIZBALLAH AND AMAL HAS STRENGTHENED THE GOL\'S ROLE IN THE 
SOUTH.  FOLLOWING ISRAEL\'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE SOUTH, HE 
SAID, THE TWO GROUPS AGREED THAT THEY WOULD LEAVE SECURITY 
ISSUES TO GOL AUTHORITIES, IN ORDER TO AVOID OPEN CONFLICT 
BETWEEN THEM.  AS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT, HE NOTED 
THAT THE ISF HAD BEEN THE ORGANIZATION TO RESPOND TO A RECENT 
INCIDENT IN MARJAYOUN IN WHICH A FORMER SLA MEMBER WAS 
ATTACKED. HE ALSO CITED THE ISF\'S ROLE IN ENSURING SMOOTH 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN SEPTEMBER. 
 
4. (C) REGIONAL VIOLENCE:  THE AMBASSADOR UPDATED BERRI ON 
SPECIAL ENVOY ZINNI\'S WORK IN THE REGION, AND A/S BURNS\' 
PLANS TO VISIT BEIRUT ON DECEMBER 14. BERRI SAID THAT HE DOES 
NOT BELIEVE SHARON WANTS PEACE.  THE AMBASSADOR ARGUED THAT 
IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES OF SIGNIFICANT U.S. MOVES ON THE 
PEACE PROCESS AND THE DISPATCH OF ZINNI AND BURNS TO THE 
REGION, PALESTINIANS HAD LAUNCHED A SERIES OF TERRORIST 
ATTACKS.  BERRI ACCEPTED THE AMBASSADOR\'S POINT, BUT WARNED 
THAT ARAFAT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN FACING A CIVIL WAR OR A WAR 
WITH ISRAEL.  ARAFAT IS WEAK, HE SAID, AND DOES NOT HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO DO MORE.   \"IF WE END UP WITH HAMAS AND SHARON, IT 
WILL BE A DISASTER,\"  HE SAID.  THE AMBASSADOR RESPONDED THAT 
ARAB LEADERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT ARAFAT AND 
ENCOURAGE HIS COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS. 
 
5. (C) THE ECONOMY:  TURNING TO THE ECONOMY, BERRI CLAIMED 
THAT ALTHOUGH HE FAVORS PRIVATIZATION, AS A TACTICAL MOVE, HE 
WAS HOLDING UP PRIVATIZATION OF TELECOMMS UNTIL THE 
GOVERNMENT MOVED AHEAD ON THE MOST COSTLY SECTORS, SUCH AS 
THE ELECTRICAL UTILITY, EDL.  HOWEVER, BEFORE PRIVATIZATION 
OF EDL BEGAN, BERRI ADDED, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD FIRST 
COLLECT THE THOUSANDS OF UNPAID ELECTRICAL BILLS.  THE 
GOVERNMENT REALIZED AN ANNUAL INTAKE OF $400 MILLION FROM 
TELEPHONE LANDLINES, SO ITS PRIVATIZATION WAS NOT AN URGENT 
MATTER, AND BERRI SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY AGREED TO THE 
PRIVATIZATION OF THE CELL-PHONE NETWORK. 
 
6. (C) BERRI V. HARIRI:  BERRI SAID THAT HE WOULD WORK WITH 
HARIRI ON ECONOMIC ITEMS WHEN IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE 
BUDGET, BUT NOT WHEN HARIRI WAS \"BEING LAZY.\" FOR EXAMPLE, 
BERRI SAID, HE HAD RAILROADED THE VAT LAW THROUGH PARLIAMENT 
AS A PACKAGE, CONTRARY TO HIS USUAL PRACTICE OF VOTING ON 
EACH ARTICLE SEPARATELY, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED IT WAS AN 
IMPORTANT STEP.  HOWEVER, HE WOULD FIGHT HARIRI ON THE 
REDUCTION OF THE COUNCIL FOR THE SOUTH\'S BUDGET.  BERRI SAID 
THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED A 25 PERCENT REDUCTION, BUT HARIRI HAD 
TRIED TO SLASH THE BUDGET BY 40 PERCENT.  BECAUSE PARLIAMENT 
DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO INCREASE ALLOCATIONS, ONLY TO CUT 
THEM, BERRI SAID THAT HE HAD THREATENED TO RETALIATE AGAINST 
HARIRI BY CUTTING IN AREAS DEAR TO HARIRI.  BERRI SAID THAT 
THE FORMER ISRAELI-CONTROLLED AREA NEEDED SIGNIFICANT 
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF 
10,000 HOMES. 
 
7. (C) DEMINING:  THE AMBASSADOR BRIEFED BERRI ON HIS TRIP 
THROUGH SOUTH LEBANON DECEMBER 3 FOCUSED ON DEMINING ISSUES 
(REF B).  SUCH OPERATIONS, HE NOTED, IN ADDITION TO BEING A 
HUMANITARIAN IMPERATIVE, WERE CRUCIAL TO THE ECONOMIC 
REVITALIZATION OF SOUTHERN LEBANON.  BERRI THANKED THE 
AMBASSADOR FOR MAKING THE TRIP, SAYING HE HAD FOLLOWED THE 
EVENTS CLOSELY. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: BERRI\'S CLAIM TO ALL \"ACTIONS\" UNTIL 1984, 
LIKELY INTENDED AS A THROW-AWAY TO MINIMIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF AMAL\'S RIVAL HIZBALLAH ON THE LEBANESE SCENE, IS 
STARTLING, AND IT IS UNLIKELY IF ASKED AGAIN THAT HE WOULD 
CONFIRM AMAL\'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST 
U.S. FACILITIES.  BERRI\'S INFLUENCE HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED ON 
HIS ABILITY TO OFFER PATRONAGE TO HIS SUPPORTERS.  HIS 
ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE AN ECONOMIC RATIONALE ON BLATANT ATTEMPTS 
TO KEEP AS MANY JOBS FOR HIS RETAINERS FOR AS LONG AS 
POSSIBLE ARE UNCONVINCING AND THE INSISTENCE ON EDL BILL 
COLLECTIONS RUN CONTARY TO HIS OWN POLITICAL INTERESTS, SINCE 
MOST OF THE UNCOLLECTED FEES ARE AMONG HIS CONSTITUENTS.  HIS 
SUPPORT IS CRUCIAL, HOWEVER, TO THE ADOPTION OF LEGISLATION, 
AS HE MAINTAINS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE PARLIAMENTARY 
PROCESS. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: LAF CLASHES WITH PALESTINIANS IN BIQA\' 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  THE LEBANESE ARMED FORCES (LAF) EXCHANGED 
FIRE WITH PALESTINIANS NEAR BAALBECK THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 
4 DURING AN ARMS SEIZURE OPERATION AGAINST AN \"ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) ARMS DEPOT\" LOCATED JUST OUTSIDE THE 
AL-GALIL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP IN THE BIQA.  ONE LAF 
SOLDIER AND THREE PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) ACCORDING TO PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR WASSEF SERHAN, EARLY 
ON SEPTEMBER 4 THE LAF RAIDED AN ANO WEAPONS CACHE NEAR THE 
AL-GALIL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP, LOCATED ON THE OUTSKIRTS 
OF BAALBECK IN THE BIQA\' VALLEY.  SARHAN CLAIMED THAT AS THE 
LAF DEPARTED THE SCENE WITH CONFISCATED ARMS, A CROWD OF 
PALESTINIANS FORMED AND BEGAN TO THROW STONES.  ARMED 
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE CROWD THEN FIRED ON THE LAF, WHICH 
RETURNED FIRE, RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF ONE SOLDIER AND TWO 
PALESTINIANS. SARHAN SAID THE LAF DID NOT ENTER THE AL-GALIL 
CAMP DURING THE OPERATION. 
 
3.  (C)  DOUREID YAGHI, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE PROGRESSIVE 
SOCIALIST PARTY FROM BAALBECK, CONFIRMED THIS ACCOUNT.  HE 
SAID THE LAF UNIT RAIDED A FATAH REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL (ANO) 
WAREHOUSE, CONFISCATING A TRUCKLOAD OF WEAPONRY AND 
AMMUNITION.  THE LAF UNIT THEN CAME UNDER FIRE AS IT WAS 
LEAVING THE WAREHOUSE.  ONE SOLDIER WAS KILLED AND TWO WERE 
WOUNDED, WHILE TWO PALESTINIANS WERE KILLED AND 16 WERE 
WOUNDED.  YAGHI ALSO REPORTED THAT THE LAF SENT ABOUT 1000 
TROOPS, WITH TANKS AND APCS, TO ENCIRCLE THE CAMP.  OTHER 
SOURCES REPORTED THAT THE MAIN ROAD INTO BAALBECK WAS CLOSED 
BY THE LAF IN THE COURSE OF THE OPERATION. 
 
4.  (U)  LOCAL TELEVISION COVERAGE SHOWED PALESTINIANS 
THROWING STONES AND BLOCKING ROADS WITH BURNING TIRES TO 
PREVENT THE LAF FROM ENTERING THE AL-GALIL CAMP.  INTERIOR 
MINISTER ELIAS MURR, VISITING THE BIQA\' THE SAME DAY TO VIEW 
GOL DRUG ERADICATION EFFORTS, REPORTEDLY HELD AN EMERGENCY 
MEETING IN THE NEARBY TOWN OF ZAHLE.  MURR INDICATED TO THE 
PRESS THAT THE GOL WILL TIGHTEN MEASURES AGAINST THE CAMP IF 
THE KILLER OF THE LAF SOLDIER IS NOT TURNED OVER TO THE GOL. 
 
5.  (C)  COMMENT:  WHILE MURR\'S COMMENTS REFLECT SHADES OF 
THE LAF KILLINGS AND HANDOVER OF SUNNI EXTREMIST ABU OBEIDA 
FROM THE AIN EL-HILWEH CAMP IN JULY, THE TWO INCIDENTS ARE 
NOT LIKELY RELATED.  FOLLOWING THE ABU OBEIDA HANDOVER, 
HOWEVER, THE GOL HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY BOLDER IN ITS EFFORTS 
TO DEAL WITH WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE FUGITIVES AND DANGEROUS 
ELEMENTS IN/AROUND LEBANON\'S PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS. 
STILL, THE LAF HAS NOT CROSSED THE LINE AND ENTERED 
PALESTINIAN CAMPS, WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN NO-GO AREAS FOR THE 
GOL.  THE AL-GALIL CAMP IS RELATIVELY SMALL, WITH ONLY A FEW 
THOUSAND RESIDENTS, AND HAS NOT PRESENTED THE SAME DEGREE OF 
LAWLESSNESS AND CONCERN AS AIN EL-HILWEH (RESIDENT POPULATION 
OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000).  WE DO NOT KNOW WHY THE LAF DECIDED 
TO RAID THE ANO WEAPONS CACHE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME; THE 
ANO HAS NOT PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN LEBANON FOR SOME 
TIME.  WHILE THE GOL MAY HAVE ACTED NOW TO CAPITALIZE ON THE 
RECENTLY REPORTED DEATH OF ABU NIDAL IN BAGHDAD, THIS ACTION 
MAY SIMPLY BE PART OF SYRIAN/GOL EFFORTS TO BALANCE AND 
CONTROL PALESTINIAN FORCES IN LEBANON.  END COMMENT.

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  INTERIOR MINISTER ELIAS MURR ANNOUNCED ON 
OCTOBER 30 THAT HE WOULD NOT GRANT PERMISSION TO OPPOSITION 
GROUP QORNET SHEHWAN\'S (QS) \"PRO-FREEDOM\" PROTEST OR TO THE 
COUNTER-DEMONSTRATION PROPOSED BY THE PRO-SYRIAN ISLAMIC 
GATHERING, BOTH SCHEDULED FOR OCTOBER 31.  QS MEMBERS QUICKLY 
RESPONDED BY CANCELING THEIR DEMONSTRATION, WHILE THE AOUNIST 
FREE PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT VOWED TO CARRY ON WITH ITS PLANS TO 
DEMONSTRATE DESPITE THE BAN.  MURR SAID HIS DECISION WAS 
BASED ON THE NEED TO MAINTAIN CIVIL PEACE DUE TO THE 
\"REGIONAL SITUATION\" AND TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF PARIS II. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  IN A MOVE AGAINST THE OPPOSITION, INTERIOR MINISTER 
ELIAS MURR DECIDED ON OCTOBER 30 TO BAN ALL OCTOBER 31 
DEMONSTRATIONS, INCLUDING QS\'S DEMONSTRATION, THE ISLAMIC 
GATHERING\'S COUNTER-DEMONSTRATION AND ALL OTHER SCHEDULED FOR 
THIS DATE.  MURR JUSTIFIED HIS DECISION ON THE BASIS OF 
MAINTAINING CIVIL STABILITY AT A TIME WHEN THE REGIONAL 
SITUATION IS VOLATILE AND IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF 
THE UPCOMING PARIS II INTERNATIONAL DONOR\'S CONFERENCE. 
DESPITE REPORTED DISAGREEMENT WITHIN QS ON WHETHER TO GO 
AHEAD WITH THE DEMONSTRATION, QS ACTED QUICKLY TO CANCEL THE 
DEMONSTRATION AND AVOID ARRESTS.  (COMMENT:  THE DECISION TO 
CANCEL THE QS DEMONSTRATION ONCE THE GOL DENIED PERMISSION TO 
PROTEST WAS ALMOST GUARANTEED.  QS LEADERS ARE ALREADY 
NERVOUS ABOUT THE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS OF OPPOSITION 
MEMBERS FOR \"CONTACT WITH THE ISRAELI ENEMY\" AND WERE NOT 
LIKELY TO PUT THEMSELVES IN THE LINE OF FIRE OF THE INTERNAL 
SECURITY FORCES (ISF).  END COMMENT.) 
 
3.  (C)  THE FREE PATRIOTIC MOVEMENT, COMPRISED OF SUPPORTERS 
OF EXILE GENERAL MICHEL AOUN, LIVED UP TO ITS PROMISE TO 
DEMONSTRATE DESPITE THE BAN.  APPROXIMATELY 300 PEOPLE 
DEMONSTRATED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE INFORMATION 
UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN FANAR, A VILLAGE NEAR BEIRUT, THE 
AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 31.  FOLLOWING THE DEMONSTRATIONS, 
PROTESTERS ATTEMPTED TO CONGREGATE IN THE STREETS BUT WERE 
STOPPED BY THE ISF.  RSO SOURCES REPORT THAT ROCKS AND OTHER 
OBJECTS WERE THROWN AT POLICE BUT AS YET WE HAVE NO 
INFORMATION ABOUT ANY ARRESTS.  NO OTHER DEMONSTRATIONS 
OCCURRED. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT.  THE SAGA, WHICH BEGAN WITH THE CONTESTED 
METN ELECTIONS, FOLLOWED BY THE MARONITE CONFERENCE IN LOS 
ANGELES, THE CLOSURE OF MTV, AND THE DISINTEGRATION OF 
ATTEMPTED RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN PRESIDENT LAHOUD AND THE QS, 
CONTINUES UNABATED.  WHAT MANY BELIEVE STARTED AS A FAMILY 
FEUD HAS ENGAGED THE ENTIRE NATION AND LED TO A RISE IN 
SECTARIAN TENSIONS.  MURR\'S JUSTIFICATION ON THE GROUNDS OF 
REGIONAL INSTABILITY AND PARIS II IS THIN AND MORE 
OPPORTUNITIES REMAIN FOR THE ISSUE TO COME TO A HEAD.  THE QS 
WILL MEET NOVEMBER 7 TO DECIDE ITS NEXT MOVE.  IN THE 
MEANTIME, MTV LAWYERS HAVE MADE ANOTHER APPEAL OF THE 
STATION\'S PERMANENT CLOSURE.  END COMMENT.

TAGS: PTER, PREL, PGOV, LE 
SUBJECT:  LEBANON: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 201772 
 
1.  SECURITY CONDITIONS IN LEBANON WORSENED DURING 2002 WITH 
THE KILLING OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY, EXPLOSIONS AT SEVERAL 
AMERICAN FRANCHISE RESTAURANTS, AND A SPIKE OF CROSS-BORDER 
ATTACKS INTO ISRAEL IN MARCH-APRIL.  LEBANON, LIKE MANY 
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION, IS EXPERIENCING AN INCREASE IN 
TERRORIST EVENTS BY SUNNI EXTREMIST GROUPS. 
 
2.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON (GOL) REMAINS UNABLE TO EXERT 
CONTROL IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING PORTIONS 
OF THE BIQ\'A VALLEY, SOUTH LEBANON, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF 
BEIRUT, AND THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  EASY ACCESS TO 
ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES CONTINUES TO BE CONDUCIVE TO THE 
POTENTIAL FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  SYRIAN AND IRANIAN SUPPORT 
FOR HIZBALLAH \"RESISTANCE\" ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH, AS WELL 
AS ASSISTANCE TO HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN 
LEBANON, HELP PERMIT TERRORIST ELEMENTS TO FLOURISH. 
SEVERAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN 
LEBANON, INCLUDING HIZBALLAH, PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD 
(PIJ), THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE - 
GENERAL COMMAND (PFLP-GC), HAMAS, THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION 
(ANO), ASBAT AL-ANSAR, AND SEVERAL SMALL LOCAL SUNNI 
EXTREMIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
3.  DESPITE ITS LIMITED ABILITY TO COUNTER HIZBALLAH AND 
PALESTINIAN REJECTIONIST GROUPS, THE GOL HAS A FREER HAND IN 
DEALING WITH SUNNI EXTREMISM.  THE GOL HAS COOPERATED WITH 
THE U.S. IN COMBATING AL-QAIDA AND AFFILIATED LOCAL SUNNI 
EXTREMIST GROUPS SUCH AS ASBAT AL-ANSAR. 
 
4.  SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST-RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE 
IN LEBANON IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: 
 
-- ON MARCH 12, INFILTRATORS FROM LEBANON KILLED SIX 
ISRAELIS IN SHELOMI, A TOWN IN NORTHERN ISRAEL. 
 
-- DURING THE PERIOD MARCH-APRIL, HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN 
REJECTIONIST GROUPS PERPETRATED SEVERAL CROSS-BORDER ATTACKS 
INTO ISRAEL, INCLUDING THE FIRING OF KATYUSHA ROCKETS. 
 
-- ON APRIL 25, THERE WAS AN ABORTED ATTEMPT TO SET OFF AN 
EXPLOSION AT A PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT IN SHUWEIFAT (BEIRUT). 
 
-- ON MAY 9, AN EXPLOSION DAMAGED A KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN 
RESTAURANT IN TRIPOLI. 
 
-- ON JULY 11, A SUNNI EXTREMIST KILLED THREE LEBANESE ARMED 
FORCES (LAF) PERSONNEL IN SIDON AND FLED INTO THE NEARBY AIN 
EL-HILWEH PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP.  VARIOUS PALESTINIAN AND 
ISLAMIC GROUPS SUBSEQUENTLY FACILITATED THE HANDOVER OF THE 
SUSPECT TO THE GOL. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 23, AN EXPLOSION IN A PARKING LOT ADJACENT 
TO THE MCDONALD\'S IN JUNIEH, NEAR BEIRUT, DAMAGED SEVERAL 
VEHICLES. 
 
-- ON NOVEMBER 12, EXPLOSIONS DAMAGED PIZZA HUT RESTAURANTS 
IN TRIPOLI AND JUNIEH, AND A LOCAL FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT IN 
JUNIEH. 
 
-- ON NOVEMBER 21, AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY WAS SHOT AND 
KILLED IN SIDON. 
 
5.  ANSWERS THAT FOLLOW ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN REFTEL: 
 
A) THE GOL INFORMED THE EMBASSY THAT IT ARRESTED IN OCTOBER 
THREE SUSPECTED AL-QAIDA OPERATIVES.  THE INDIVIDUALS WERE 
ALLEGEDLY ATTEMPTING TO START AN AL-QAIDA TERRORIST CELL IN 
LEBANON.  THE GOL ALSO OFFERED COOPERATION WITH THE USG ON 
THE INVESTIGATION CONCERNING SEPTEMBER 11 HIJACKER ZIAD 
JARRAH (A LEBANESE NATIONAL). 
 
FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH MID-NOVEMBER, THE SPECIAL 
INVESTIGATIONS COMMISSION INVESTIGATED 113 CASES INVOLVING 
ALLEGATIONS OF MONEY LAUNDERING, 20 OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO 
TERRORIST FINANCING.  NO ACCOUNTS RELATED TO THE FINANCING 
OF TERRORISM WERE DISCOVERED IN LEBANESE BANKS AND FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS IN 2002. 
 
THE GOL AMENDED ITS LAW ON MONEY LAUNDERING AND ITS PENAL 
CODE THIS YEAR TO STRENGTHEN PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO COMBAT 
THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.  THE AMENDMENT TO THE PENAL CODE 
PROVIDES FOR THREE TO SEVEN YEARS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE 
FOR ANY PERSON THAT CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO 
THE FINANCING OF TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OR OPERATIONS. 
 
B) THE JUDICIARY IN OCTOBER INDICTED THREE MEN (TWO LEBANESE 
AND ONE SAUDI) AND 18 OTHERS IN ABSENTIA SUSPECTED OF AL- 
QAIDA CONNECTIONS, INCLUDING PLANNING TO TRAIN PERSONNEL TO 
CARRY OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THEY WERE ALSO CHARGED WITH 
FORGING DOCUMENTS AND PASSPORTS.  THE INDICTMENT CHARGED 
THEM ACCORDING TO ARTICLE 335 OF THE PENAL CODE, WHICH 
STIPULATES A SENTENCE OF NOT LESS THAN 15 YEARS 
IMPRISONMENT.  THE CASE WAS REFERRED TO THE MILITARY 
TRIBUNAL.  THE TRIAL IS EXPECTED TO START IN DECEMBER. 
 
FOLLOWING A SPATE OF ATTACKS ON AMERICAN FRANCHISE 
RESTAURANTS, THE GOL DISPATCHED LAF AND INTERNAL SECURITY 
FORCE (ISF) PERSONNEL TO PROTECT THESE FACILITIES ON A 24- 
HOUR BASIS.  THE GOL IS COOPERATING CLOSELY WITH U.S. 
OFFICIALS AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON ITS INVESTIGATION OF 
THE MURDER OF A U.S. CITIZEN IN SIDON. 
 
C) THE GOL DID NOT EXTRADITE ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR 
PROSECUTION DURING THE YEAR.  THE U.S. DID NOT REQUEST ANY 
NEW EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISM SUSPECTS OF THE GOL IN 2002. 
 
D) THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTING AND/OR 
EXTRADITING SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN LEBANON.  LEBANESE LAWS 
PROHIBIT THE EXTRADITION OF ANY LEBANESE NATIONAL TO A THIRD 
COUNTRY.  THE LEBANESE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS INDEPENDENT IN 
PRINCIPLE, BUT SUBJECT TO POLITICAL PRESSURE (FROM 
INFLUENTIAL LEBANESE POLITICIANS, AS WELL AS SYRIAN LEADERS 
AND INTELLIGENCE PERSONNEL) IN PRACTICE.  THE GOL 
ACKNOWLEDGES THE UN LIST OF TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED 
PURSUANT TO UNSCR 1267/1390.  HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT 
ACKNOWLEDGE TERRORIST GROUPS DESIGNATED SOLELY BY THE USG 
AND WILL NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THESE GROUPS. 
 
TO DATE, A COURT HEARING IN THE APPEAL MADE BY THE 
PROSECUTOR\'S OFFICE REGARDING THE ASSASSINATION OF U.S. 
AMBASSADOR FRANCIS MELOY AND TWO OTHERS IN 1976 HAS NOT BEEN 
SCHEDULED, FOLLOWING A COURT VERDICT DECLARING THE SUSPECT, 
TAWFIZ MUHAMMAD FARROUKH, NOT GUILTY OF MURDER FOR HIS ROLE 
IN THE KILLINGS. 
 
E) SENIOR GOL OFFICIALS HAVE REPEATEDLY DENOUNCED AND 
CONDEMNED THE SEPTEMBER 11 AND OTHER TERRORIST ATTACKS. 
PRIME MINISTER HARIRI ISSUED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE 
MURDER OF AN AMERICAN MISSIONARY IN SIDON. 
 
LEBANESE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE 
PAST ACTS OF TERRORISM.  ALTHOUGH NO ARRESTS HAVE YET BEEN 
MADE REGARDING RECENT BOMBINGS AGAINST AMERICAN FAST-FOOD 
RESTAURANTS AND THE MURDER OF AN AMERICAN IN SIDON, LEBANESE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS HAVE PLEDGED THEIR SUPPORT IN 
FINDING THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTS. 
 
F) NONE. 
 
G) THE GOL PROVIDES NO KNOWN MATERIAL OR FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  AT SYRIA\'S DIRECTION, HOWEVER, 
IT DOES PROVIDE SAFEHAVENS AND BASES FOR SEVERAL TERRORIST 
GROUPS.  SYRIA HAS GRANTED HIZBALLAH AND PALESTINIAN 
REJECTIONIST GROUPS, INCLUDING PIJ, PFLP-GC, AND HAMAS THE 
RIGHT TO MAINTAIN BASES AND OFFICES IN VARIOUS AREAS OF 
LEBANON, INCLUDING THE BIQ\'A VALLEY, THE SOUTHERN SUBURBS OF 
BEIRUT, AND PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL IS POWERLESS 
TO TAKE UNILATERAL STEPS TO REMOVE THESE SAFEHAVENS FROM 
LEBANESE TERRITORY. 
 
H) THE GOL HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
HOWEVER, GOL OFFICIALS HAVE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN, PUBLICLY 
AS WELL AS PRIVATELY, THAT HIZBALLAH IS A \"RESISTANCE,\" NOT 
A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
 
I) THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 2001 IN THE 
GOL\'S ATTITUDE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
THE GOL IN 2002 DEMONSTRATED GREATER EFFORTS TO PURSUE 
FUGITIVE SUNNI EXTREMISTS, INCLUDING SUSPECTS IN HIDING IN 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.  THE GOL HAS NOT ENTERED THE 
CAMPS TO PURSUE SUSPECTS, BUT SUCCESSFULLY PRESSURED 
PALESTINIAN AND ISLAMIC GROUPS TO HAND OVER A SUSPECT WANTED 
FOR KILLING THREE LAF PERSONNEL.  THE LAF ALSO UNDERTOOK AN 
OPERATION TO CONFISCATE WEAPONS FROM AN ANO WEAPONS 
WAREHOUSE ADJACENT TO THE AL-JILAL PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMP 
NEAR BAALBEK. 
 
J) THE GOL HAS ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED ALL LISTS PASSED BY 
THE U.S. UNDER E.O. 13224 AND UNSCRS 1267, 1333 AND 1373, 
EXCEPT FOR THE REQUEST TO FREEZE HIZBALLAH ASSETS.  IN 
RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, THE SIC ASKED FOR EVIDENCE OR 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION THAT WOULD WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION 
UNDER LEBANESE LAW. 
 
K) (I) THE U.S. HAS REPEATEDLY ASKED THE GOL TO TURN OVER 
THE LEBANESE TERRORISTS INVOLVED IN THE 1985 HIJACKING OF 
TWA 847 AND IN THE ABDUCTION, TORTURE, AND MURDER OF 
AMERICAN HOSTAGES FROM 1984 TO 1991.  U.S. COURTS HAVE 
BROUGHT INDICTMENTS AGAINST A NUMBER OF THESE HIZBALLAH 
OPERATIVES, SOME OF WHOM REMAIN IN PROMINENT POSITIONS IN 
THE ORGANIZATION TODAY.  THE GOL ARGUES THAT ITS PROVISION 
OF AMNESTY TO LEBANESE INVOLVED IN ACTS OF VIOLENCE DURING 
LEBANON\'S CIVIL WAR PREVENTS IT FROM PROSECUTING THESE 
CASES.  WITH REGARD TO THE THREE TWA 847 SUSPECTS, INCLUDING 
IMAD MUGHNIYA, THE GOL MAINTAINS THAT THEY ARE NOT IN 
LEBANON. 
 
(II) THE LAF PROVIDES IMMEDIATE PERIMETER PROTECTION OF THE 
U.S. EMBASSY AND ACCOMPANIES EMBASSY PATROLS OF THE 
SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS.  THE ISF PROVIDES PROTECTIVE EOD 
AND INVESTIGATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE EMBASSY.  THE LAF AND ISF 
HAVE RESPONDED FULLY TO OUR REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE. 
 
L)  NOT APPLICABLE.

SUBJECT: TFIZO1: LEBANESE, PALESTINIAN FACTIONS UNITED IN 
OPPOSITION TO IRAQ WAR 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  THE LEADERS OF 34 LEBANESE POLITICAL 
PARTIES AND 11 PALESTINIAN FACTIONS, A GROUPING THAT MEETS 
SEVERAL TIMES ANNUALLY, HELD AN \"EXCEPTIONAL AND URGENT\" 
MEETING MARCH 19.  THE GROUP ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE CALLING FOR 
BOYCOTTING U.S. PRODUCTS, \"ENCIRCLING\" U.S. AND COALITION 
EMBASSIES, AND DENOUNCING THE SYRIAN ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.  THE 
STATEMENT ALSO PRAISED THE PALESTINIAN INTIFADA AS THE BEST 
\"ROAD\" FOR THE PALESTINIANS VICE THE \"SO-CALLED ROADMAP,\" AND 
REASSERTED THE RIGHT OF THE \"RESISTANCE\" TO CONFRONT ANY 
ISRAELI AGGRESSION.  SOLIDARITY ACROSS FACTIONS HAS BEEN 
BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE BREWING REGIONAL CRISIS.  HIZBALLAH 
SECRETARY GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH EMERGED AS THE GATHERING\'S 
SPOKESPERSON, SUGGESTING THAT THE OTHER LEADERS CONSIDER HIM 
TO BE THE ACTOR BEST ABLE TO RALLY NATIONAL UNITY DURING THIS 
CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  THE LEADERS OF MANY OF LEBANON\'S DIVERSE, 
CONFESSIONALLY-BASED POLITICAL PARTIES AND 11 PALESTINIAN 
FACTIONS HELD AN EMERGENCY MEETING MARCH 19 TO DEVISE A 
\"NATIONAL\" APPROACH TO THE WAR IN IRAQ.  FOLLOWING THE CLOSED 
SESSION, HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
NASRALLAH SAID POLITICAL PARTY LEADERS WERE UNITED IN THEIR 
OPPOSITION TO THE U.S. WAR AGAINST IRAQ.  HE CALLED ON ALL 
ARABS TO CONTINUE TO REJECT WAR, TO BOYCOTT U.S. PRODUCTS AND 
THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND TO \"ENCIRCLE\" U.S. AND COALITION 
EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE.  NASRALLAH STRESSED THE \"READINESS OF 
THE RESISTANCE TO MEET ANY ISRAELI AGGRESSION,\" AND WARNED 
THAT EVENTS IN IRAQ WOULD LEAD TO A REDRAWING OF THE REGIONAL 
MAP WITH INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.  HE ANNOUNCED THAT A 
NATIONAL EMERGENCY COMMITTEE WOULD BE FORMED TO COORDINATE 
PLANS AND THAT ANTI-SYRIAN CHRISTIAN OPPOSITION GROUP QORNET 
SHEHWAN WOULD BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE.  DRUZE LEADER WALID 
JUMBLATT APPLAUDED THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT LAHOUD AND THE 
MARONITE PATRIARCH FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF SYRIAN PRESIDENT 
ASAD, AND STATED THAT WHILE NO ONE SUPPORTS SADDAM HUSSEIN, 
\"DEMOCRACY CANNOT BE BROUGHT IN ON AN AMERICAN TANK.\"  A 
WORKING LEVEL MEETING OF THE SAME FACTIONS IS SCHEDULED FOR 
MARCH 20 TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS. 
 
3. (C) COMMENT:  POLITICAL LEADERS\' EXPRESSION OF UNITY IN 
OPPOSITION TO WAR IN IRAQ APPEARS PREDOMINANTLY AIMED AT 
PROVIDING POLITICAL COVER, GIVEN SYRIAN PRESSURE TO KEEP A 
LID ON LEBANON DURING THE CONFLICT.  AMBASSADOR SPOKE WITH 
PRIME MINISTER HARIRI AND DRUZE MINISTER OF THE DISPLACED 
MARWAN HAMADEH ON MARCH 20, BOTH OF WHOM USED THE PHRASE 
\"SIT-IN\" TO DESCRIBE PLANS FOR POSSIBLE ACTIVITIES DIRECTED 
AT COALITION EMBASSIES IN BEIRUT.  FORMER MP MARWAN ABU FADEL 
TOLD US THE MEETING AND RESULTING COMMUNIQUE WERE NECESSARY 
IN ORDER TO DEFLATE TENSION IN THE STREET BY EXPRESSING 
CONDEMNATION OF THE WAR. 
 
4.  (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED:  HIZBALLAH SYG NASRALLAH\'S 
EMERGENCE AS THE GATHERING\'S KEY SPOKESMAN MAY BE 
SIGNIFICANT.  THERE APPEARS TO BE TACIT, IF BEGRUDGING, 
AGREEMENT AMONG CONFESSIONAL LEADERS THAT NASRALLAH IS THE 
ONLY FIGURE WHO CAN PUT SUBSTANCE BEHIND THEIR CALL FOR A 
UNIFIED POSITION.  NASRALLAH\'S CREDENTIALS AS LIBERATOR OF 
SOUTH LEBANON ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED BY LEBANESE OF ALL 
FACTIONS, HE LEADS A FORCE WHICH IS WELL PLACED TO THREATEN 
TO RESPOND TO ISRAELI ACTIONS DIRECTED AT LEBANON; AND HE IS 
COMFORTABLY UNDER THE ULTIMATE CONTROL OF BROTHER SYRIA. 
NASRALLAH, WHOSE ACTIONS IN PAST MONTHS SUGGEST AN INCREASING 
DESIRE TO PLAY A MORE ESTABLISHMENT ROLE, MAY BE CAPITALIZING 
ON THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE HIS TWO-PRONGED PUBLIC 
RELATIONS CAMPAIGN -- ONE FOR THE WEST AND ONE FOR THE 
REGION. (SEPTEL).  END COMMENT.

REF: (A) BEIRUT 896 (B) BEIRUT 899 (C) STATE 77620 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  AMBASSADOR MET WITH LEBANESE PARLIAMENT 
SPEAKER NABIH BERRI MARCH 31.  DISCUSSIONS CENTERED AROUND 
AMERICAN-LEBANESE RELATIONS, THE WAR IN IRAQ AND SHI\'ITE 
REACTION TO THE COALITION\'S CAMPAIGN, THE ROADMAP, AND USG 
WARNINGS TO SYRIA REGARDING TRANSSHIPMENTS TO IRAQ.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  MEETING WITH SPEAKER BERRI MARCH 31, AMBASSADOR 
HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON (GOL) ACTORS 
TO RECOGNIZE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANTI-WAR AND 
ANTI-AMERICAN RHETORIC IN MAKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE WAR, AS 
HE HAD PREVIOUSLY WITH OTHER GOL LEADERS (REFS A AND B). 
BERRI RESPONDED POSITIVELY -- \"I AM WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED 
PERCENT\" CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED STRONG 
BILATERAL RELATIONS, HE SAID, ADDING THAT HE HAD TOLD THE 
BRITISH AMBASSADOR THE SAME THING EARLIER THAT MORNING. 
HOWEVER, BERRI CONTINUED, THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE ACCEPT OR 
EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN IRAQ. 
 
\"THANKS TO YOU, SADDAM IS A HERO\" 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  AMBASSADOR ASKED THE SPEAKER WHY ANTI-WAR SENTIMENT 
COULD BE SO EASILY TRANSLATED INTO SUPPORT FOR SADDAM, 
PARTICULARLY AMONG SHI\'ITES, GIVEN THE IRAQI REGIME\'S HISTORY 
OF ATROCITIES AND REPRESSION AGAINST ITS OWN SHI\'A 
POPULATION.  BERRI RESPONDED \"NO WAY, WE ARE WITH THE IRAQI 
PEOPLE,\" NOT SADDAM, ADDING THAT SHI\'ITE PARTICIPANTS IN 
ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS IN LEBANON HAVE REFUSED TO CARRY 
PICTURES OF SADDAM.  AMBASSADOR PRESSED THE SPEAKER TO 
EXPLAIN WHY LEBANESE SHI\'ITES ARE BOARDING BUSES TO IRAQ AS 
VOLUNTEER FIGHTERS ON THE SIDE OF SADDAM.  BERRI EMPHATICALLY 
DENIED THAT ANY AMAL SUPPORTERS WERE AMONG THIS GROUP, BUT 
DID ACCEDE THAT HE CANNOT SPEAK FOR ALL SHI\'ITES (READ 
HIZBALLAH).  TO EXPLAIN ARAB ANTI-WAR FEELINGS TURNING 
PRO-SADDAM -- THE SPEAKER OFFERED THAT \"YOU ARE MAKING HIM A 
HERO.\"  AS FOR THE SHI\'ITES IN SOUTHERN IRAQ, BERRI 
CONTINUED, THE EXPECTATION THAT THEY WOULD WELCOME COALITION 
FORCES AS LIBERATORS AND FIGHT ALONG SIDE THEM BELIES RECENT 
HISTORY.  FOLLOWING DESERT STORM, THE U.S. HAD TURNED A BLIND 
EYE TO THE REPUBLICAN GUARD MASSACRE OF IRAQI SHI\'ITES WHO 
REBELLED AGAINST SADDAM. 
 
IRAQ IS A PENCIL, ISRAEL A CANNON 
--------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  BERRI REITERATED THE ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED 
BELIEF IN THE MIDDLE EAST THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL REGIONAL ISSUE 
IS THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT, NOT IRAQ.  \"IRAQ IS A 
PENCIL, ISRAEL A CANNON\" SAID BERRI, IN REFERENCE TO THE SIZE 
OF THE PROBLEM.  ARABS CANNOT SUPPORT U.S. ACTION IN IRAQ 
WHEN THE U.S. LISTENS ONLY TO THE ISRAELIS AND NOT TO ITS 
ARAB FRIENDS.  YOU CANNOT EXPECT THE ARAB WORLD TO ACCEPT 
AMERICA AS THE JUDGE OF THE IRAQI REGIME, THE SPEAKER 
CONTINUED, WHEN THE U.S. IGNORES THE INJUSTICES IN PALESTINE. 
 AS FOR THE ROADMAP, BERRI COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH ARAFAT HAS 
AGREED TO THE CHANGED CONSTITUTION AND ABU MAZEN HAS AGREED 
TO BE PRIME MINISTER, \"STILL, SHARON WILL NEVER ACCEPT IT.\" 
 
5.  (C)   BERRI RAISED SECRETARY RUMSFELD\'S WARNING TO SYRIA 
ON TRANSSHIPMENTS OF MILITARY MATERIAL TO IRAQ.  HE OPINED 
THAT THE SECRETARY WAS ATTEMPTING TO DEFLECT BLAME FOR THE 
CURRENT COURSE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ.  AMBASSADOR ASSURED THE 
SPEAKER THAT, TO THE CONTRARY, THE USG HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A 
LONG AND INTENSE DIALOGUE WITH SYRIA THAT PRECEDES THE 
COMMENCEMENT OF HOSTILITIES IN IRAQ.  THE SPEAKER REMAINED 
UNCONVINCED, ADVISING THAT, GIVEN ITS POWER AND IMPORTANCE IN 
THE WORLD, \"THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT GO AROUND ACCUSING 
SMALLER NATIONS OF THINGS UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN.\" 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  BERRI EXPRESSED VIEWS WHICH PARALLEL HIS 
RECENT PUBLIC STATEMENTS.  IN RESPONSE TO SECRETARY 
RUMFIELD\'S WARNING TO SYRIA, BERRI STATED MARCH 29 \"THE REAL 
SMUGGLING ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION, 
FROM ISRAEL TO THE UNITED STATES -- ISRAEL IS SMUGGLING IDEAS 
THAT EMBROIL THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION IN IRAQ.\"  BERRI 
DISCUSSED WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE A FAILURE ON THE PART OF 
ARABS TO EMPLOY ARAB CAPITAL PRESENT IN THE U.S. TO INFLUENCE

CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR VINCENT M. BATTLE; REASONS 1.5 (B), (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  SPEAKING AT THE FUNERAL OF HIS FATHER, 
FORMER HIZBALLAH SECRETARY GENERAL SHAYKH SUBHI TUFAYLI 
DENOUNCED GOL OFFICIALS AS \"MONSTERS,\" HIZBALLAH AS \"BORDER 
GUARDS FOR ISRAEL,\" AND IRAN AS AN ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THIS WAS THE FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE IN TWO YEARS BY 
TUFAYLI, FOR WHOM THE GOL HAS ISSUED SEVERAL ARREST WARRANTS. 
HOWEVER, HE IS EXPECTED TO EXIT THE LEBANESE POLITICAL STAGE 
AS QUICKLY AS HE REAPPEARED LAST WEEK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
2.  (U) SHAYKH TUFAYLI, WHO SERVED FROM 1987 TO 1989 AS 
HIZBALLAH\'S FIRST SECRETARY GENERAL, WAS STRIPPED OF HIS 
OFFICIAL POSITION WITHIN THE PARTY AFTER OPPOSING ITS 
DECISION TO TAKE PART IN THE 1992 PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. 
AFTER BEING FURTHER DISTANCED, AND THEN EXPELLED FROM THE 
PARTY IN JANUARY 1998, TUFAYLI AND HIS SUPPORTERS SEIZED 
CONTROL OF A HIZBALLAH RELIGIOUS SCHOOL ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF 
BAALBEK.  LAF TROOPS ATTEMPTED TO STORM THE BUILDING AND AT 
LEAST EIGHT PEOPLE WERE KILLED, INCLUDING AN LAF OFFICER AND 
A FORMER MP, SHAYKH KHODR TLEISS, TUFAYLI\'S CLOSEST AIDE. 
SINCE THEN, SEVERAL ARREST WARRANTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR 
TUFAYLI; HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERIOUS ATTEMPTS TO 
ARREST HIM AND HE IS KNOWN TO CONTINUE TO RESIDE IN HIS HOME 
VILLAGE OF BRITAL (NEAR BAALBEK) -- VIRTUALLY A NO-GO ZONE 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
DENOUNCES IRAN\'S ROLE IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER, TUFAYLI RESURFACED 
ON SEPTEMBER 8 TO SPEAK AT A BRITAL MOSQUE.  THERE, HE LASHED 
OUT AT IRAN (AND THE U.S.), SAYING \"THE PARTICIPATION OF 
IRAN\'S IRAQI SUPPORTERS IN IRAQ\'S INTERIM GOVERNING COUNCIL 
IS AN ENDORSEMENT OF AMERICAN PRESENCE THERE.\"  TUFAYLI HELD 
HE U.S. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AUGUST 31 ASSASSINATION OF 
MOHAMMAD BAQR AL-HAKIM, SAYING \"THE ONLY BENEFICIARY OF THIS 
CRIME IS AMERICA.\"  HE ADDED THAT \"AMERICA\'S DEFEAT IN IRAQ 
IS MUCH EASIER THAN ITS DEFEAT IN LEBANON.\"  TURNING TO 
AFGHANISTAN, TUFAYLI SAID, \"THERE ARE COUNTRIES BORDERING 
AFGHANISTAN WHO CLAIM THEY ARE MUSLIM NATIONS AT A TIME THEY 
ARE HELPING THE AMERICANS.\" 
 
CHALLENGES HIZBALLAH AND GOL LEADERSHIP 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) CHALLENGING HIZBALLAH\'S CURRENT LEADERSHIP, TUFAYLI 
CALLED FOR OPENING LEBANESE BORDERS TO DEFEND PALESTINIANS, 
SAYING THE PROPER DUTY OF THE \"ISLAMIC RESISTANCE\" IS TO 
FIGHT ISRAEL.  TUFAYLI SAID HIZBALLAH HAS TURNED INTO A 
\"BORDER GUARD FOR ISRAEL.\"  TUFAYLI ALSO DENOUNCED GOL 
OFFICIALS, SAYING \"WE DO NOT HAVE A GOVERNMENT, BUT RATHER 
MONSTERS,\" AND WARNING \"EVERY THIEF TO RETURN TO THE TREASURY 
WHAT HE HAS STOLEN.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5.  (C) TUFAYLI IS A TRUE DEAD-ENDER, REPRESENTING THE MOST 
EXTREME, RETROGRADE STRAIN OF KHOMEINI-ISM WITHIN HIZBALLAH. 
HIS UNEXPECTED, HIGH-PROFILE REAPPEARANCE CALLS INTO QUESTION 
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE GOL, WHICH HAS NEVER MADE ANY SERIOUS 
ATTEMPT TO ARREST HIM.  HIS INFLAMMATORY REMARKS ABOUT 
HIZBALLAH AND IRAN COULD REIGNITE FRICTIONS BETWEEN THE 
HIZBALLAH LEADERSHIP AND TUFAYLI\'S SUPPORTERS, ESPECIALLY IN 
THE BAALBEK-HIRMIL REGION, WHOSE SUPPORTERS THERE MAY 
INTERPRET TUFAYLI\'S REAPPEARANCE AS A SIGN OF SYRIAN BACKING 
FOR HIS CAUSE.  (NOTE: WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE CASE.) 
PARLIAMENT SPEAKER NABIH BERRI TOLD AMBASSADOR SEPTEMBER 9 
THAT, WHILE THE EVERYONE KNOWS THAT TUFAYLI LIVES IN BRITAL, 
THE \"DEAL\" HAS BEEN THAT HE WILL BE LEFT ALONE AS LONG AS HE 
REMAINS OUTSIDE THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.  IN THIS INSTANCE, 
BERRI EXPLAINED, THE SYRIANS \"CLOSED THEIR EYES\" BECAUSE OF 
THE DEATH OF TUFAYLI\'S FATHER.  BERRI ASSURED US THAT TUFAYLI 
WILL FADE BACK INTO THE WOODWORK -- AND IN FACT, MAY ALREADY 
HAVE DONE SO.  END COMMENT.

SYRIA ON IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 299270 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Vincent M. Battle; reasons 1.5 (b), (d). 
 
1. (C)  Summary:  Ambassador met with Parliament Speaker 
Nabih Berri October 27.  The discussion focused principally 
on Iraq and Syria.  Berri, having just returned from 
Damascus, again tried to impress upon us that Syrian 
President Asad desires a good relationship with the United 
States and that Syria is well-positioned to play a positive 
role in support of U.S. objectives in Iraq.  Berri was 
remarkably uninformed about the details of Hizballah\'s 
October 17 challenge to an embassy motorcade in south 
Lebanon, but expressed the view that embassy personnel should 
be able to travel freely in the south.  Berri intends to 
block any restoration of relations between Lebanon and Libya 
until Qaddafi responds satisfactorily on the disappearance of 
Imam Musa Sadr.  End summary. 
 
LEBANESE PARLIAMENTARIANS VISIT DAMASCUS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Berri visited Damascus October 25-26 with the new 
Lebanese Parliament committee heads.  Syrian President Bashar 
al-Asad met with the Lebanese deputies and, according to both 
Berri and Deputy Speaker Elie Ferzeli, was very frank about 
Syria not wanting any problems with the United States.  Berri 
will return to Damascus next weekend for an extraordinary 
meeting of Arab League parliamentarians, which he said was 
called to discuss Israel\'s October 5 air strike on Syria, and 
is being held in Damascus as an expression of solidarity with 
the Syrians.  Lebanon will assume the chairmanship of the 
group of Arab parliamentarians in February for the next two 
years. 
 
SYRIA, IRAQ AND THE U.S.: WHO NEEDS WHO? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Berri returned repeatedly to a theme he had 
emphasized prior to the war in Iraq: that the U.S. needs 
Syria to help stabilize Iraq -- more than Syria needs the 
United States.  Syria is the only one of Iraq\'s neighbors 
that can play such a role, Berri argued.  His analysis is 
that if Turkish troops enter Iraq, they will have trouble 
first with the Kurds, then with the Shi\'a and Sunnis.  While 
Iran might have some influence, the Shi\'ites in Iraq are 
Arabs and many fought against Iran in the Iran-Iraq war.  The 
Syrians, on the other hand, already have deep ties with the 
Kurds.  Barzani and Talabani have lived in Damascus.  When 
Saddam Hussein attacked Iraq\'s Shi\'a, many fled to Syria and 
found a welcome reception there.  Among the Sunni 
populations, elements in the Syrian and Iraqi Ba\'ath parties, 
nominally political opponents, do talk with each other. 
Finally, the patriarchs for Iraq\'s Christian minorities can 
all be found in Damascus.  The main impediment to Syria 
helping stabilize the situation in Iraq, according to Berri, 
is that Israel will not let the U.S. allow Syria to take on 
this role. 
 
4.  (C)  Ambassador reminded Berri that the issue of support 
for terrorism is very much on the table in our relationship 
with Syria.  Berri responded that Syria shares the fight 
against \"Sunni terrorism,\" but that no one can convince any 
Arab that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon\'s actions against 
Palestinian civilians are not terrorism.  Berri lamented that 
the problems between the U.S. and the Arab world all start 
with Israel.  He added that Bashar told the Lebanese 
parliamentarians that the Arabs are partially at fault for 
not reaching out effectively to make their case to the U.S. 
and to the American people. 
 
5.  (C)  Berri remains in close touch with many Shi\'ite 
leaders in southern Iraq, so Ambassador briefed Berri on the 
arrest of associates of Moqtada al Sadr, per reftel.  Berri 
noted he had received a communication October 27 from 
Ayatollah Sistani, who said that Sadr had arrived at 
Sistani\'s office and tried to see him, but Sistani refused 
and referred him to his staff.  Berri continues to discount 
Abdel Qadr al-Bakr Hakim as a possible political force, 
despite his transformation from a \"militia\" member to a 
\"civilian.\" 
 
HIZBALLAH CHALLENGE TO EMBASSY MOTORCADE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Ambassador recounted the October 17 incidents of 
Hizballah interference with an embassy motorcade in south 
Lebanon.  Berri was surprised; his impression of the 
incidents, based on local media reports, was that the U.S. 
had not provided proper notification to the GOL.  He was 
taken aback to learn that the motorcade was under ISF escort 
when challenged by Hizballah.  Berri\'s view is that everyone, 
including all foreign diplomats, should be able to travel 
freely anywhere in the south. 
 
BUDGET WOES 
----------- 
 
7.  (C)  Berri expressed frustration with the debate over the 
budget, which soon will move to Parliament for consideration. 
 He said he does not support the current budget, nor the fact 
that there are currently \"two budgets\" -- one introduced by 
the government, and one put forward by President Lahoud. 
Berri repeated a statement he made in a recent speech that 
Finance Minister Siniora does not have the right \"to give up 
on\" implementing Paris II (by submitting a budget not in 
accordance with Paris II targets), because the Paris II 
commitments were undertaken by the entire government of 
Lebanon. 
 
LIBYA NOT TO BE REHABILITATED 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Berri exploded when the Ambassador asked whether 
apple exports to Libya might be resumed, following the visits 
to Libya of Lebanese delegations of politicians and 
industrial association leaders.  Berri refuses to allow 
relations with Libya to be mended \"over commercial issues\" 
and has asked Agriculture Minister Ali Hassan Khalil to 
explore with the government of Tunisia the possibility of 
exporting Lebanon\'s bumper apple crop to Tunisia.  Berri said 
he has been waiting \"since 1978\" for an answer from Qaddafi 
on the fate of missing Lebanese Imam Musa Sadr.  Berri has 
sent many messages to Qaddafi, and the Libyan leader\'s 
response, until one and a half years ago, was always that 
Musa Sadr had disappeared in Europe, not Libya.  More 
recently, according to Berri, Qaddafi has \"confessed\" that 
Musa Sadr disappeared in Libya -- and Berri said he will not 
rest until Musa Sadr\'s body has been returned to Lebanon.

SUBJECT: LEBANON: INTERIOR MINISTER MURR DISCUSSES 
SECURITY, ELECTORAL ISSUES 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Vincent M. Battle; reasons 1.5 (b), (d). 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  Ambassador met with Interior Minister 
Elias Murr October 31 to discuss Hizballah interference with 
an embassy motorcade, progress on the McDonalds bombing 
investigation, and the preparation of 
municipalities/electoral laws.  Murr comprehends the 
seriousness of Hizballah interference with an embassy 
motorcade, especially since the convoy was being escorted by 
officers from his Ministry.  Murr said Hizballah officials 
told him the incident resulted from \"misbehavior\" by its 
personnel -- not Hizballah policy.  With the arrest of a 
Yemeni thought to be the mastermind of the April 5 McDonalds 
bombing, GOL authorities are looking into possible 
al-Qaida/UBL links, including funding connections.  The 
Minister is planning to introduce sweeping changes in a new 
electoral law and to implement electronic voting for the 2005 
parliamentary elections.  End summary. 
 
Hizballah motorcade incident 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Ambassador reviewed with Minister Murr the incidents 
of interference with an embassy motorcade in south Lebanon 
October 17, thanking the Minister for provision of an 
Internal Security Forces (ISF) escort for the trip.  He 
expressed Washington and the Embassy\'s concern and noted that 
we are still awaiting the GOL\'s official report. 
 
3.  (C)  Minister Murr seemed to grasp, more than any of our 
other GOL interlocutors, the potential danger stemming from 
the second incident in particular, when two Hizballah 
vehicles intercepted the motorcade.  Murr said he spoke 
directly with the ISF officer who serves as liaison officer 
with Hizballah to inform the organization that its actions 
contravened \"the strategic position of Lebanon.\"  Hizballah 
officials later responded to the Minister that the incident 
was the result of \"misbehavior\" by its operatives on the 
ground, and not any political decision by the organization. 
The Minister conveyed to Ambassador his confidence that there 
will be no similar incidents in the future.  He said he will 
be personally involved in every future request from the 
embassy for security support for embassy travel. 
 
Counter-terrorism: Arrest of UBL associate? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The Minister discussed progress on the McDonalds 
bombing investigation, principally related to the recent 
arrest of a Yemeni national, Muammar Abdallah al-Awama (also 
known as Ibn al-Shadid).  He said al-Shadid is still being 
interrogated by Lebanese Armed Forces G-2, and that he does 
not expect al-Awama to be handed over to the military 
tribunal for approximately two months.  (Note:  This will 
delay the tribunal that is hearing the cases of the other 
suspects, which was suspended last week due to al-Awama\'s 
arrest.  End note.) 
 
5.  (C)  Murr said al-Shadid has links to al-Qaeda associates 
in Yemen and Saudi Arabia.  Lebanese security services are 
investigating the extent of those links, and also will be 
looking into the financing, including from abroad, of the 
McDonalds and other attacks on U.S. franchises.  Murr said 
the GOL believes al-Shadid is the mastermind of all 
organizations linked to UBL in Lebanon, and it will be 
important to see whether, with al-Shadid\'s arrest, any 
\"dormant\" al-Qaida operatives take over.  The MOI has at 
least three more names of al-Shadid\'s associates, who are 
believed to be hiding in the Ain el-Hilweh refugee camp. 
Murr said they GOL would be trying to lure them out in order 
to arrest them. 
 
6.  (C)  Murr noted that attacks on foreign interests in 
Lebanon are generally carried out during the winter months. 
He believes this is because of the large numbers of Gulf 
Arabs visiting Lebanon for tourism during the summer.  In 
addition to plots uncovered that were directed at the 
Ambassador, the Minister said there were plans to target him, 
too, -- at the Ministry, at his private office, and at his 
home. 
 
MOI security plan, prison conditions 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Murr said the Ministry was putting the finishing 
touches on a tough six-month internal security plan to 
address terrorism, organized crime, money laundering and 
narcotics.  He undertook to provide a copy to the Ambassador 
upon completion.  He cited 26,000 arrests since he took 
office in 2000, compared to only 3,000 arrests during the 
period 1990-2000.  Murr admitted that prisons were crowded 
and that prison conditions were not good.  He asserted that 
the International Committee of the Red Cross was welcome to 
visit any MOI prisons at any time, per an MOI decree.  He 
explained that the ICRC had postponed a visit to Roumieh 
prison as part of a protest against the Ministry of Defense\'s 
refusal to allow the organization to visit military prison 
facilities. 
 
Municipalities, decentralization, and electoral laws 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  (C) The Minister discussed three laws being prepared 
under his supervision: the municipalities, decentralization, 
and electoral laws.  The municipalities law is currently 
being debated in parliament and should pass in about two 
months.  The decentralization law should be submitted to the 
government for approval in about three weeks.  This law would 
abolish the \"caza\" level between governorates and 
municipalities.  Under the law, there would be 5-6 governors 
in the south, 5-6 governors in the north, four in Mount 
Lebanon, three in the Biq\'a, and one in Beirut.  There also 
would be a governing council comprised of governors and 
mayors, each with one vote.  (Note:  The decentralization law 
basically renames the cazas as governorates, breaking up the 
power of the current, smaller number of governors and 
providing greater voice for municipal leaders.  End note.) 
 
9.  (C)  The Minister emphasized that the decentralization 
law is not linked to the parliamentary elections law.  He 
claimed the parliamentary election law being prepared will 
create \"an atomic bomb\" in Lebanon.  He did not elaborate, 
but said he was \"changing everything.\"  Murr plans to submit 
the law (through the Council of Minister) to parliament and 
\"let parliament refuse it,\" which he said will be difficult 
for the parliamentarians, who are accountable to the people, 
\"and the people want change.\" 
 
10.  (C) Murr revealed that he is planning for electronic 
\"e-voting\" for the parliamentary elections.  With electronic 
voting, he said, election results will be available as soon 
as the polls close.  This will help preclude allegations of 
tampering, because there will be no time lag between the 
election and the announcement of results.

TAGS: PTER, LE 
SUBJECT: LEBANON:  2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
Post\'s responses are keyed to questions in reftel: 
 
A)  Significant actions taken by the Government of Lebanon 
(GOL) to support the global coalition against terrorism: 
 
-- Lebanese authorities have arrested a number of individuals 
suspected of supporting al-Qa\'ida.  In July 2003, Lebanese 
security forces made numerous arrests in connection with the 
April 5, 2003 bombing of a McDonald\'s restaurant in the 
northern Beirut suburb of Dowra and with a planned attack on 
a Hardees restaurant in the Achrafieh neighborhood of Beirut. 
 In mid-October, GOL authorities arrested a Yemeni national 
purportedly linked to al-Qa\'ida, Muammar Abdallah al-\'Awama, 
on suspicion of involvement in these actual and planned 
attacks against U.S. interests. 
 
-- GOL intelligence and security services have been 
cooperative with Embassy requests for information and 
support, and GOL security services have been responsive to 
Embassy requests for protective security. 
 
B)  The response of the GOL\'s judicial system to acts of 
international terrorism and/or significant acts of domestic 
terrorism during 2003: 
 
-- In May, a military tribunal sentenced eight people (four 
of whom were in custody and four in absentia) to prison terms 
of three to 15 years after finding them guilty of attempting 
to establish an al-Qa\'ida cell in Lebanon. 
 
-- In September, a military tribunal began the trial of 35 
individuals, separately and in groups, charged with planning 
and/or executing the bombings described in (A), and also with 
planning to assassinate the U.S. Ambassador in Lebanon and 
launch a missile attack on the Embassy compound. 
 
C)  The GOL did not extradite or request the extradition of 
suspected terrorists for prosecution during 2003.  Although 
the GOL has charged two residents of Australia, Bilal Khazal 
and Maher Khazal, with involvement in the planned terrorist 
operations described in (B), there is as yet no extradition 
treaty between the two countries.  The U.S. did not request 
any new extraditions of terrorism suspects of the GOL in 2003. 
 
D)  Significant impediments to GOL prosecution and/or 
extradition of suspected terrorists during 2003: 
 
-- GOL security services and the Lebanese Armed Forces 
continue to have very limited control over Palestinian 
refugee camps in Lebanon, inside which a number of terrorist 
groups -- including Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command 
(PFLP-GC), Hamas, the Abu Nidal Organization, Al-Aqsa 
Brigades, and Asbat al-Ansar -- operate. 
 
-- The GOL remains unable or unwilling to exert control in 
certain parts of the country, including portions of the Biq\'a 
valley, south Lebanon, the southern suburbs of Beirut, and 
the Palestinian refugee camps.  Syrian and Iranian support 
allows terrorist elements to flourish in Lebanon, and the GOL 
is powerless to challenge Syria\'s policy of maintaining a 
Hizballah and Palestinian rejectionist presence in various 
parts of the country. 
 
-- The Lebanese judicial system is independent in principle, 
but subject to political pressure (from influential Lebanese 
politicians, as well as Syrian leaders and intelligence 
personnel) in practice.  To date, a court hearing in the 
appeal made by the prosecutor\'s office regarding the 
assassination of U.S. Ambassador Francis Meloy and two others 
in 1976 has not been scheduled, following a court verdict 
declaring the suspect, Tawfic Muhammad Farroukh, not guilty 
of murder for his role in the killings. 
 
-- Lebanese laws prohibit the extradition of a Lebanese 
national to any third country. 
 
E)  Host government responses to international terrorism 
other than prosecution included public statements by top GOL 
officials condemning terrorist bombings in Najaf, Iraq, in 
August; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in May and November; and 
Istanbul, Turkey, also in November.  Also, GOL authorities 
continued to cooperate with U.S. officials in the 
investigation of a November 2002 murder of a U.S. citizen in 
Sidon. 
 
F)  Other major counterterrorism efforts taken by the GOL 
during 2003: 
 
-- In October, the National Assembly passed two new bills 
strengthening existing legislation against money laundering 
and terrorism finance.  Law no. 547 expanded existing 
legislation on money laundering, making illicit any funds 
resulting from \"the financing or contribution to finance 
terrorism or terrorist acts or terrorist organizations, based 
on the definition of terrorism as it appears in the Lebanese 
Penal Code\" (which distinguishes between \"terrorism\" and 
\"resistance\").  Law no. 553 stipulated penalties for \"any 
person who voluntarily and by any means, whether directly or 
indirectly, finances or contributes to finance terrorism or 
terrorist acts or terrorist organizations....\"  President 
Lahoud signed the two bills into law later that month. 
 
-- From January to November, the Special Investigations 
Commission investigated 245 cases involving allegations of 
money laundering, including 22 that were related to terrorism 
financing.  No accounts used for terrorism finance have been 
discovered in Lebanese banks and financial institutions to 
date in 2003. 
 
G)  The GOL provides no known material or financial support 
to terrorist organizations.  At Syria\'s direction, however, 
it does provide safehavens and bases for several terrorist 
groups.  Syria allows Hizballah and Palestinian rejectionist 
groups -- including PIJ, PFLP-GC, and Hamas -- to maintain 
bases and offices in various areas of Lebanon, including the 
Biq\'a valley, the southern suburbs of Beirut, Palestinian 
refugee camps, and south Lebanon.  The GOL is powerless to 
challenge Syria by taking unilateral action against these 
groups, either by disarming and disbanding them or forcing 
them to depart Lebanon.  Many Lebanese officials and 
politicians routinely hail Hizballah as a \"resistance\" group, 
while criticism of Hizballah invites retribution from Syria 
or its Lebanese supporters.  More recently (in response to a 
circular on Hamas bank accounts issued by the Central Bank of 
Lebanon in October), some officials and politicians have 
publicly supported Hamas as yet another \"resistance\" 
organization. 
 
H) While the GOL has not made any public statements in 
support of a terrorist-supporting country specifically on a 
terrorism issue, many officials and politicians routinely 
defend Syria, such as in the aftermath of the October 5 
Israeli air strike on Syrian territory, which Israel claimed 
was in retaliation for a suicide bombing on Israeli territory 
planned by Palestinian rejectionist groups in Syria. 
 
I)  There were no significant changes since 2002, positive or 
negative, in the host government\'s attitude toward terrorism, 
international or domestic.

1.  (C) Summary.  Meeting in Beirut to address the misuse of 
Islamic endowments by extremist groups, the Executive Council 
of the Ministers of Islamic Endowments rejected any link 
between Islam and terrorism, denouncing terrorists as 
\"infidels.\"  Prime Minister Hariri called for reforming 
Islamic endowments and, more broadly, for internally-driven 
reform in the Muslim world.  Privately, Hariri\'s religious 
affairs advisor expressed cautious optimism about the outlook 
for Islamic reform, saying he was particularly impressed by 
the Saudis\' receptiveness at the conference.  End Summary. 
 
Three Goals for the Conference 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) On December 10, the Executive Council of the 
Ministers of Islamic Endowments opened a two-day conference 
in Beirut in response to growing international (namely, US) 
pressure to reform and control the use of Islamic charity 
funds.  The conference aimed at three goals:  1) confronting 
the linkage of the Arab and Muslim worlds with terrorism, 
going beyond the simple denunciation of specific acts of 
terrorism and carrying out a serious review of the current 
Islamic religious discourse; 2) improving the monitoring of 
\"awqaf\" (Islamic endowments) and turning them into more 
effective institutions for social and economic development; 
and 3) presenting the image of a tolerant, open Islam. 
 
3.  (U) Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait, and Indonesia sent their 
ministers of Islamic endowments to participate, while 
lower-ranking officials represented Jordan, Gambia, Morocco, 
and Pakistan.  The Mufti of the Republic, Mohammad Rachid 
Qabbani, represented Lebanon, whose multi-confessional 
government has no minister for Islamic endowments.  Prime 
Minister Rafiq Hariri and other Lebanese government officials 
attended, as did a number of Lebanese religious leaders, 
including Christian clergymen invited to observe the 
proceedings. 
 
Hariri Calls for Reform 
----------------------- 
 
4.  (U) Prime Minister Hariri told the Council that \"Islamic 
endowments are a great Muslim foundation that suffered from 
anarchy and mismanagement.\"  He called for change in Islamic 
societies, but added that \"we need to do so in accordance 
within our identity, traditions and interests.\"  Challenging 
the perception that change is being imposed on the Muslim 
world from outside, he said, \"We should not be afraid to seek 
improvement just because we are upset that others are 
demanding it.\" 
 
5.  (U) The chairman of the council, Saudi Minister for 
Islamic Endowments Saleh bin Abed al-Aziz Al-Shaykh, called 
on participants to \"reform our approach to the Muslim 
properties and to define the role of mosques in addressing 
true Islamic values and teachings.\"  Al-Shaykh called upon 
Muslim scholars to \"come up with new findings and fatwas that 
could preserve our nation and save it from the threats and 
challenges facing us today.\" 
 
Measures Adopted 
---------------- 
 
6.  (U) The Ministerial Council issued a final communique 
saying terrorism, violence, and extremism were not linked to 
Islam.  It called on \"wise men\" to eliminate root causes of 
terrorism and avoid fighting terrorism with more terrorism. 
It accused terrorists of being \"infidels,\" specifically 
denouncing the recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia.  It 
endorsed the call for the Islamic world to confront internal 
and external challenges, and agreed on the importance of 
\"renewing Islamic ideology.\"  The ministers also called for 
an end of the occupation of Iraq and for the establishment of 
a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. 
 
A Long Way to Go? 
----------------- 
 
7.  (C) Mohammad Sammak, Hariri\'s senior advisor on religious 
issues, said he was pleased with the results of the 
conference, describing it as laying the cornerstone for 
reform in Islamic endowments.  He described the Saudi 
delegation as \"quite receptive\" to the topic of Islamic 
reform; this represented a \"big shift\" in their thinking. 
While admitting that genuine reform will take time, a 
cautiously optimistic Sammak noted a clear desire for change 
among most of the conference\'s attendees. 
 
8.  (C) Sammak said the presence of Lebanese Christian clergy 
at the conference, while nothing out of the ordinary for 
similar events in Lebanon, showcased Lebanese 
multi-confessional tolerance to attendees.  It was a valuable 
example for representatives of certain countries whose record 
of religious tolerance left something to be desired (he 
mentioned Saudi Arabia and Pakistan).  Some of the same Saudi 
clerics attending this conference had once accused Sammak of 
being a \"kafir\", an infidel, for attending the Vatican\'s 
Synod for Lebanon in 1995.  This time, according to Sammak, 
they told him he had been right all along in seeking 
cooperation across confessional lines.

1.  (C) IN A JANUARY 15 CONVERSATION WITH AMBASSADOR, 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NABIH BERRI SAID HE AND HIS AMAL 
MOVEMENT FOLLOWERS LOOKED TO IRAQ\'S GRAND AYATOLLAH ALI 
AL-SISTANI AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY. 
ACCORDING TO BERRI, AMAL HAD PREVIOUSLY LOOKED TO ITS 
FOUNDER, IMAM MOUSA AL-SADR, THEN, FOLLOWING AL-SADR\'S 
DISAPPEARANCE IN LIBYA IN 1978, TO LEBANESE HIGHER SHI\'A 
COUNCIL HEAD MOHAMMAD MEHDI SHAMSEDDIN, WHO DIED THREE YEARS 
AGO. 
 
2.   (C) AL-SISTANI\'S FOLLOWING IN LEBANON WAS NOT LIMITED TO 
AMAL MEMBERS, ACCORDING TO BERRI.  IN FACT, THE MAJORITY OF 
LEBANON\'S SHI\'AS, INCLUDING SOME MEMBERS OF HIZBALLAH, LOOKED 
TO AL-SISTANI FOR GUIDANCE.  AL-SISTANI\'S INFLUENCE WAS ALSO 
STRONG IN IRAN.  COMPARING AL-SISTANI WITH THE LEBANESE SHI\'A 
LEADER MOHAMMAD HUSSEIN FADLALLAH, BERRI USED THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH AS AN ANALOGY:  AL-SISTANI IS \"LIKE THE POPE\" FOR THE 
WORLD\'S SHI\'AS, WHILE FADLALLAH\'S STANDING IS ANALOGOUS TO 
THAT OF LEBANON\'S MARONITE PATRIARCH.  \"NOT EVERY MARJ\'A 
(SHI\'A RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY) IS SMART,\" BERRI SAID. 
AL-SISTANI, HOWEVER, IS NOT ONLY WIDELY RESPECTED BUT ALSO 
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT. 
 
3.  (C) BERRI AT FIRST CLAIMED THE AMAL MOVEMENT WAS \"VERY 
ACTIVE\" IN IRAQ, ALTHOUGH HE LATER BACKPEDALED, SAYING HE 
MEANT AMAL WAS SIMPLY \"RESPECTED\" AMONG IRAQIS.  AS PROOF OF 
THIS, BERRI HAS RECEIVED A NUMBER OF HIGH-RANKING IRAQI 
OFFICIALS IN BEIRUT.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE HAS RECEIVED AN IRAQI 
OFFICIAL NAMED AL-ALLAWI (IGC MEMBER WITH LEBANON 
CONNECTIONS) THREE TIMES SO FAR, HE SAID.  REGARDING PLANS 
FOR A TRANSITION TO IRAQI SOVEREIGNTY, BERRI ADVISED THE USG 
TO \"PAY ATTENTION\" TO AL-SISTANI\'S DEMANDS FOR DIRECT 
ELECTIONS.  \"DON\'T MAKE A MISTAKE\" IN DEALING WITH IRAQ\'S 
SHI\'AS, HE SAID.  IT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE 
NO DIVISION OF IRAQ -- \"WE DON\'T WANT WHAT HAPPENED IN 
LEBANON.\"

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) Lebanese authorities inadvertently gave the \"Beirut 
Declaration\" -- a ringing denunciation of Lebanon\'s political 
status quo covered by the press in both Lebanon and France 
(Ref A) -- widespread publicity as a result of  their 
ham-handed attempt to block the document\'s public unveiling. 
Two Shi\'a political figures we talked to -- one a government 
minister, the other an independent, anti-establishment 
politician -- provided nuanced reactions to the document. 
End summary. 
 
An inside view from one of the authors 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) One of the drafters of the \"Beirut Declaration,\" 
Joseph Bahout, a professor at Beirut\'s University of St. 
Joseph, told us work began in March of this year, although 
the ideas behind it were \"not new\" but had come together over 
a long period of time.  His collaborators -- \"the usual 
suspects,\" as he put it -- included: 
 
-- Samir Franjieh and Fares Souaid, two members of parliament 
from the Qornet Shehwan Gathering, a moderate, anti-Syrian 
Christian opposition group; both are Maronites; 
 
-- Saoud el Mawla, a professor at Beirut\'s Lebanese-American 
University who began as a pro-Palestinian radical leftist in 
the 1970s but is now close to liberal Iranian reformers and 
Bahout\'s collaborator in the Arab Muslim-Christian Dialogue; 
he is a Shi\'a; 
 
-- Mohammad Hussein Shamseddine, a \"classic\" Shi\'a cleric 
with close connections to Shi\'a clerical circles in Najaf 
(and a former student of the late Grand Ayatollah Abdul Qasim 
al-Khoei, who was the highest Shi\'a religious authority in 
Iraq). 
 
3.  (C) The May 2-29 series of municipal elections delayed 
the release of the \"Beirut Declaration\" until June -- its 
authors had originally hoped to release it sooner, according 
to Bahout.  He was puzzled but pleased with the way Lebanese 
authorities had prevented him and his colleagues from holding 
a conference over the June 19-20 weekend, one that 2,000 
participants were expected to attend, and during which the 
\"Beirut Declaration\" was to be unveiled.  In doing so, the 
authorities had inadvertently given the \"Beirut Declaration\" 
and its organizers tremendous \"free publicity,\" far more than 
they would have received otherwise, according to Bahout. 
 
The organizers follow up 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) Following up on the June 21 publication of the 
\"Beirut Declaration\" in the French daily \"Le Monde\", Bahout 
said he planned to work with contacts at the French daily 
\"Liberation\" to provide further favorable press coverage. 
Bahout also expected the \"Beirut Declaration\" to be on the 
agenda of an annual conference of opposition and like-minded 
figures organized by Souaid, scheduled this year to take 
place on June 27. 
 
5.  (C) Bahout said the French Embassy in Beirut -- which he 
described as \"excited\" about the declaration -- had been 
quick to initiate contact with him, Franjieh, and other 
organizers once news of its stillborn public release hit the 
local press. 
 
Two Shi\'a reactions:  an establishment one... 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) In a June 24 conversation with the Ambassador, 
Agriculture Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, a leading figure of 
the Amal Movement led by parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri, 
said he had \"no problem\" with the \"Beirut Declaration\" or its 
backers.  He said he did not consider its release to be a 
very important development, however, and suggested it 
probably was not worth the Ambassador\'s time in following up. 
 
7.  (C) While some \"Beirut Declaration\" backers might 
represent a Shi\'a \"third force\" in Lebanese politics, those 
individuals did not have a \"program\" beyond opposing both 
Amal and Hizballah, Khalil said. 
 
 
... and an opposition one 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) Riad al-Ass\'ad, an independent Shi\'a politician from 
the South and sworn enemy of Berri and the Amal Movement (Ref 
B), said he saw the \"Beirut Declaration\" as a matter of \"good 
ideas but bad people,\" characterizing its organizers as 
\"elitish\" figures engaged in political \"maneuvering.\"  While 
the main points in the declaration, including those about 
Syria, were \"good,\" its timing was \"problematic\" and not 
helpful in the current situation, Ass\'ad said. 
 
9.  (C) Had the conference been allowed to take place, Ass\'ad 
said, its main results would have been to showcase MP and 
possible presidential contender Nassib Lahoud (a man of 
integrity who has needlessly diminished himself with an 
excessive focus on local politics in the Metn region, in 
Ass\'ad\'s view) as the chief \"defender of the constitution,\" 
and to serve as a platform for the Qornet Shehwan group. 
 
10.  (C) Ass\'ad said he had little use for the declaration\'s 
emphasis on \"Muslim-Christian understanding.\"  What Lebanon\'s 
Muslims and Christians really needed was a common sense of 
\"Lebanese identity,\" he said. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (C) As Bahout told us, the main ideas behind the \"Beirut 
Declaration\" are not new.  However, the document crystallizes 
widespread and multi-confessional dissatisfaction with the 
political status quo at a time when more and more observers 
see a renewal or extension of President Lahoud\'s term in 
office as inevitable.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C) A number of Lebanese observers who favor the idea of 
transforming Hizballah into a normal political party see 
hopeful signs of this happening.  Specifically, they point to 
expressions from some Hizballah members of common interest 
with Christian oppositionists and more recently the 
supporters of the \"Beirut Declaration\".  According to these 
observers, with Hizballah\'s leadership feeling \"cornered\" by 
regional and local developments, Hizballah\'s upcoming August 
conference is a potential milestone in its \"libanisation.\" 
Skeptics hold that, party conference or no party conference, 
Iran\'s Islamic revolutionaries, not the Hizballah 
rank-and-file, still set the organization\'s direction.  At 
least one independent Shi\'a politician would prefer to see 
Hizballah go the way of another, now-defunct civil war-era 
militia.  End summary. 
 
Signs of interest in the \"Beirut Declaration\" 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Several personalities involved in the \"Beirut 
Declaration\" (Ref A), a call for genuine post-civil war 
reconciliation and reassertion of Lebanese sovereignty, have 
suggested that their agenda struck a sympathetic chord within 
Hizballah, at least among many of the rank-and-file.  For 
example, Shi\'ite political scientist Saoud el Mawla pointed 
to the attendance of three members of Hizballah at a June 27 
gathering organized by Member of Parliament Fares Souaid (who 
belongs to the anti-Syrian Qornet Shehwan Gathering).  The 
event was a follow-on of sorts to the stillborn public 
launching of the Declaration, cancelled after GOL 
authorities, apparently nervous about any sign of 
Christian-Muslim consensus regarding Syria, clumsily 
intervened. 
 
3.  (C) While the three were not official representatives of 
Hizballah, Mawla said their attendance indicated growing 
interest among Hizballah\'s rank-and-file in the Declaration\'s 
message.  They were clearly interested in engaging \"Christian 
opposition\" elements (hence their attendance at Souaid\'s 
event), but seemed less interested in \"old leftist\" 
co-religionists like Mawla, whom they have known, and argued 
with, for years. 
 
4.  (C) Although the rank-and-file was showing interest in 
new directions, such as the \"Beirut Declaration,\" Mawla 
described a Hizballah leadership that is \"on the defensive,\" 
particularly in the aftermath of the Hay es-Selloum riots 
(Ref B).  Feeling \"cornered\" by post-9/11 developments in the 
Middle East, it is sticking to a doctrinaire position on Iraq 
and lashing out at its sometime partners, such as the General 
Confederation of Labor, as well as its chief political rival, 
the Amal movement of Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Berri. 
 
Discontent in the ranks? 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) Other observers have similarly described Hizballah as 
feeling \"cornered\" by developments in the region.  Nasir 
al-Ass\'ad, a political commentator with Beirut\'s 
\"al-Mustaqbal\" newspaper, described the Hay es-Selloum 
incident -- in which several people, all Shi\'as from the 
Biqa\' Valley, were killed by Lebanese soldiers -- as a 
watershed.  Many Hizballah members, with hindsight, saw Hay 
es-Selloum as a \"trap\" for Hizballah set by Syria\'s security 
apparatus and its Lebanese allies, supposedly telegraphing 
their readiness to clamp down on Hizballah as part of a 
U.S.-Syrian grand bargain (Ref C). 
 
6.  (C) Despite insinuations of U.S. involvement made by 
Nasrallah immediately afterward (Ref D), many in Hizballah\'s 
rank-and-file had come to believe this could not possibly 
have been the case, according to Ass\'ad.  Seeing their 
longtime protector, Damascus, now seemingly ready to offer 
them up, many Hizballah members were increasingly interested 
in making Hizballah less of a Syrian \"tool.\"  This 
rank-and-file discontent only grew after the June 11 meeting 
in the town of Chtaura between Nasrallah and Berri, brokered 
by Syrian military intelligence (Ref E), according to Ass\'ad. 
 
 
\"Libanizing\" Hizballah 
---------------------- 
 
7.  (C) Ass\'ad said that, during Hizballah\'s planned party 
conference in August, all issues were to be \"on the table,\" 
including Hay el-Selloum, a definition of \"resistance\" 
activities, dialogue with Lebanon\'s Christians, and relations 
with Iran and Syria.  He described the conference as a 
potential milestone in the \"libanisation\" of Hizballah, that 
is, the transformation of it into a normal political party. 
He saw the \"Christian opposition\" and Prime Minister Hariri 
supporting this, but at the same time looking to see the US 
reaction. 
 
8.  (C) Ass\'ad said that maximalist U.S. demands for the 
disarmament and dissolution of Hizballah would jeopardize the 
\"libanisation\" process, since the Hizballah leadership -- 
perhaps seeing \"libanisation\" as a slippery slope toward 
Guantanamo -- might resist it.  A political rather than 
military solution was necessary to defuse the many \"time 
bombs\" that make up Hizballah\'s paramilitary elements, 
according to Ass\'ad. 
 
9.  (C) Ziad Majed, a young independent political activist 
and member of the Cultural Council of Southern Lebanon, 
agreed that \"libanisation\" of Hizballah is the goal of 
Lebanon\'s oppositionists, both Christian and Muslim.  This 
was the implication of the \"Beirut Declaration,\" he added. 
 
Limits to growth 
---------------- 
 
10.  (C) Majed doubted Hizballah had a clear vision of its 
future, even though it appeared to be at a crossroads.  While 
it was the most popular political party in Lebanon, its 
identity as an organization of, by, and for Shi\'as put sharp 
limits on its ability to gather support from other 
confessional groups.  Among Shi\'as, it could bank on its past 
record of fighting Israeli occupation, a patronage network in 
the form of  social welfare programs, and the \"easy answers\" 
afforded by its brand of political Islam. 
 
11.  (C) While most ordinary Lebanese identify corruption as 
a serious national problem, Majed doubted Hizballah would try 
to rally broader national support through an aggressive 
anti-corruption stance.  Doing so would put Hizballah in an 
uncomfortable position with its ally, Syria, whose officials 
in Lebanon over the years have become deeply entangled in 
corruption. 
 
A splash of cold water 
---------------------- 
 
12.  (C) Nizar Hamzeh, an American University of Beirut 
political scientist and expert on Hizballah, dismissed 
predictions that Hizballah\'s upcoming party conference might 
lead to fundamental changes.  \"Libanisation\" has in fact been 
going on since the late 1980s, he pointed out, when Hizballah 
decided to accommodate (if not accept) Lebanon\'s confessional 
system of government, eventually participating in the 1992 
parliamentary elections. 
 
13.  (C) Hizballah\'s Members of Parliament, far from 
representing a \"libanising\" strain capable (as is sometimes 
suggested) of transforming Hizballah from an armed movement 
into a normal Lebanese political party, in fact serve mainly 
to give Hizballah a moderate face that other Lebanese (and 
many foreigners) are comfortable dealing with, Hamzeh said. 
They have no power base within Hizballah.  Instead, the real 
power base for Hizballah\'s leadership is Iran\'s supreme 
religious leader, Ayatollah Khameinei, and the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard Corps.  Hizballah\'s leadership is 
\"appointed\" by them, not elected from within the 
organization, Hamzeh said. 
 
14.  (C) Hamzeh suggested that Hizballah was fairly modest in 
its long-term aspirations.  Its leadership pins its hopes on 
demographic change in Lebanon, with Christian emigration and 
Shi\'a birth rates leading to a redistribution of power among 
Lebanon\'s confessional groups, and Hizballah receiving a 
share in a Shi\'a-dominated government. 
 
15.  (C) Although some of his Qornet Shehwan colleagues are 
intrigued by signs of Hizballah support for the \"Beirut 
Declaration,\" former Lebanese Ambassador to the U.S. Simon 
Karam expressed skepticism to us.  While Hizballah has made 
helpful gestures before (such as on behalf of Christian 
oppositionists detained by Lebanese authorities in 2001), 
efforts to engage Hizballah on the issue of Lebanese 
sovereignty always fall flat. \"They\'re not interested,\" he 
said.  Rather, their helpful gestures tend to be little more 
than political maneuvering aimed at getting other Lebanese 
actors to make reciprocal gestures in support of \"the 
resistance.\" 
 
Going the way of the LF? 
------------------------ 
 
16.  (C) Not everyone is holding out for \"libanisation\" of 
Hizballah.  One independent Shi\'a politician trying to 
compete against the Hizballah-Amal duopoly in the South, 
Ahmad al-Ass\'ad, told us he was convinced that, were Syria 
ever to turn off the tap of Hizballah\'s Iranian financial and 
material support, Hizballah would quickly become much less 
formidable.  It might well follow the path of another 
political-military movement that emerged during the Lebanese 
civil war, the Lebanese Forces (LF).  While the LF once 
challenged the army for dominance of Lebanon\'s civil war-era 
\"Christian enclave,\" it was quickly disarmed after 1990 and 
now exists as a group of squabbling, politically 
inconsequential factions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (C) At the same time that many Lebanese observers see 
hope for \"libanisation,\" others point to a contradictory 
trend.  Specifically, they see Hizballah becoming even more 
of a militant, transnational movement, with a disturbing 
resemblance to the Palestinian \"state within a state\" of the 
1970s and early 1980s, and with the same potential to invite 
Israeli military intervention and fuel civil strife.  Part 2 
of this series will examine this second face of Hizballah.

opposition and Walid Jumblatt\'s bloc, he said, could Lebanon 
face the challenges posed by UNSC 1559.  PM Hariri, he 
reported, met with him earlier that day, seeking Berri\'s 
support for a narrow, technocratic government; Berri rebuffed 
the PM, saying that broader political participation was 
essential to the new cabinet\'s ability to deal with the 
legislative elections law as well as other issues.  Berri 
said that, public comments from Walid Jumblatt and Christian 
opposition figures notwithstanding, he believed it was 
possible to lure their representatives to the cabinet.  Asked 
by the Ambassador about next steps, given widely divergent 
views among leading Lebanese figures on the next cabinet, 
Berri noted that Hariri would see President Lahoud again 
during the evening of 10/11 in an attempt to hammer out a 
cabinet deal.  Berri would not predict what Lahoud and Hariri 
might decide, or even whether they could agree, but he 
emphasized that no deal on a cabinet is possible without 
Berri\'s parliamentary blessing. 
 
2.  (C)  On spring 2005 legislative elections, Berri said 
that he cared less about the type of electoral districts to 
be drawn -- large (favored by Hariri) or small (favored by 
Maronite Patriarch Sfeir) -- as long as the same standard was 
applied across the country.  But when pressed, Berri 
acknowledged that he preferred the larger governorate 
(\"muhafeza\") system as opposed to small \"qada\" districts. 
The governorates, he said, are more consistent with the Taif 
accord and, by inclusion of more than one sect in each 
governorate, help move Lebanon away from a confessional 
system of representation. 
 
3.  (C)  Much of the hour-long meeting was devoted to Berri 
decrying UNSC 1559 as interference in Lebanon\'s domestic 
affairs and to Berri\'s attempt to convince the Ambassador 
that French and U.S. views toward implementation of UNSC 1559 
have already diverged (with the U.S. softening its line, 
according to this theory).  The Ambassador pushed back that 
the U.S. wants to see UNSC 1559 fully implemented, with a 
functioning cabinet addressing the needs of the Lebanese 
people rather than answering to Damascus.  After giving a 
strong condemnation of Sunni extremism in Iraq and al-Qaida\'s 
activities worldwide, Berri also lamented what he described 
as U.S. neglect of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, 
arguing that what he believed to be the absence of U.S. 
strong leadership in pushing the Israelis and Palestinians 
toward a two-state solution fanned the flames of extremism. 
 
4.  (C)  Comment:  In arguing for a national unity 
government, Berri is more likely to be motivated by what is 
best for Berri and his Amal movement than what is best for 
Lebanon.  Hariri\'s proposal for a narrow, technocratic 
government would likely leave out Amal figures; a 
technocratic government is also more likely to pursue 
Hariri\'s reform agenda at the expense of Berri\'s spoils and 
patronage instincts.  In a larger, national unity government, 
however, Berri will have Amal ministers who potentially can 
be deal makers or deal breakers, giving the Shia leader more 
influence on the direction of policy and debate with the 
cabinet.  As the Ambassador told Berri, whether the cabinet 
is narrow and technocratic or larger and drawn from a broad 
political spectrum is not of interest to the USG.  What we 
want to see is a cabinet that earns credibility among the 
Lebanese people by starting to address their needs.  This 
would signal to us that Lebanon is beginning the process of 
moving toward compliance with UNSC 1559.

SUBJECT: LEBANON: WHAT\'S WRONG WITH AMAL? 
 
REF: BEIRUT 4587 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Christopher W. Murray for reason 1.4 (d). 
 
1.  (S)  Summary and comment:  The Amal Movement is unable to 
keep up with Hizballah\'s popularity because Amal is seen as 
disorganized, corrupt, and based too much on party leader 
Nabih Berri.  Referred to as \"the thieves,\" Amal\'s leaders 
maintain party support through a patronage system that uses 
government and international aid funds to pay supporters. 
Amal enjoys little real popularity; many of its supporters 
are more anti-Hizballah than pro-Amal.  Berri is unwilling to 
reform Amal and has not prepared the party for the future, 
which suggests future Amal electoral losses to Hizballah. 
End summary and comment. 
 
------------------------ 
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? 
------------------------ 
 
2.  (S)  The Amal Movement, Hizballah\'s rival for leadership 
of Lebanon\'s Shia community, is corrupt and disorganized 
under the leadership of Parliamentary Speaker Nabih Berri, 
according to Shia politicians and citizens whom we 
interviewed.  None are supporters of Hizballah.  Amal\'s 
leadership is referred to as \"the thieves,\" according to 
Professor Nizar Hamzeh of the American University of Beirut. 
Berri delivers social services and development aid to 
predominantly-Shia southern Lebanon.  But the way he does it 
(\"wheeling, dealing, and stealing,\" according to a relative 
of Amal\'s founder Imam Musa Sadr) gives him a poor 
reputation.  While Hizballah uses Iranian money and donations 
to fund its social services, Berri simply redirects Lebanese 
taxpayer money to his supporters. 
 
3.  (S)  Much of the GOL\'s reconstruction and development 
contracts in southern Lebanon are awarded to Berri associates 
who hire Berri supporters, according to Hamzeh.  Berri 
directs government tobacco subsidies to Lebanon\'s inefficient 
tobacco farms in his political base along the southern 
Lebanese coast, according to Ahmad Assaad, an independent 
Shia politician.  Assaad added that the GOL-funded Council of 
the South rebuilds homes in southern Lebanon destroyed by 
Israeli bombing and shelling, but Amal supporters receive far 
more compensation for their homes than Hizballah supporters 
do.  Abdallah Bitar, the pro-Amal President of the Nabatiyeh 
Merchants\' Association, told econoff that municipalities that 
vote for Hizballah get little GOL development aid.  Nabatiyeh 
residents expressed concern to econoff that recent Hizballah 
gains on the municipal council will cost their town 
infrastructure aid. 
 
4.  (C)  Yasser Atwi, the English language coordinator at an 
Amal-run school, provided econoff with an example of Amal 
charity work that is mostly funded by taxpayer money.  Atwi 
said that Amal built the school with party money and private 
donations, but it does not pay for the operating costs. 
Tuition in the Tyre school is subsidized by the GOL at USD 
600 per student; the parents pay USD 400.  The school, though 
run by Amal party loyalists, is effectively funded by the GOL 
and tuition payments. 
 
5.  (C)  Berri has been successful in obtaining international 
development aid, but many Shia doubt if it goes to the 
Lebanese people.  Hamzeh told us that a center for 
handicapped and retarded children is closed for most of the 
year but opened when the center\'s Italian donors visit. 
Hamzeh said that there is a director and staff who collect 
paychecks, but they are Berri associates who do not normally 
show up for work. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
BERRI, MAN OF THE PEOPLE... HIS PEOPLE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (S)  Our contacts blame much of Amal\'s stagnation on 
Berri.  One who personally knows Berri described him as 
temperamental, easily angered, and egotistical.  Berri, 
unlike Hizballah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, is not 
accessible to his subordinates and is regarded as aloof. 
Mohammad Baydun, a member of the Chamber of Deputies from 
Tyre and former Amal member, told econoff that Berri tries to 
make all decisions himself, but he makes those decisions in 
the interests of his family members\' finances, not for the 
sake of the party.  Bitar said that Berri\'s inner circle acts 
as his gatekeepers; they use their access to information to 
increase their personal wealth.  Berri acknowledged Amal\'s 
shortcomings in his conversations with Bitar, but he appeared 
too old and tired to do anything about it.  \"He didn\'t care,\" 
said Bitar. 
 
7.  (S)  Berri has become wealthy and owns a large estate 
outside of Sidon.  No one knows how Berri became wealthy, but 
his practice of taking a cut of investments in southern 
Lebanon is one source of income.  Berri insists on becoming a 
partner in any new venture in southern Lebanon without 
investing any of his own capital, according to southern 
Lebanese businessmen (reftel).  Assaad confirmed this 
practice, saying that Berri scares off investment in the 
economically depressed south by demanding a share and the 
hiring of his cronies. 
 
8.  (S)  While Berri\'s wealth has increased, Amal appears to 
be having difficulty raising money.  Amal is losing members 
to Hizballah, according to Hamzeh.  Hamzeh said that Amal\'s 
street fundraising is also drying up.  More Shia imams are 
directing charity money to Hizballah projects, according to 
Baydun.  Wealthy Lebanese Shia expatriates in Africa are no 
longer sending donations to Amal because they do not trust 
Amal leaders to spend the money on the people, according to 
Baydun. 
 
9.  (C)  Iran is providing some funds to Amal, though not 
nearly as much as it gives to Hizballah, according to MP Ali 
Osseirran of Sidon, a member of Berri\'s parliamentary bloc. 
Hamzeh estimated that Iran gives Amal about USD 1 million 
annually. 
 
------------ 
SOFT SUPPORT 
------------ 
 
10.  (C)  Amal supporters are often more anti-Hizballah than 
pro-Amal.  Amal supporters Bitar and Atwi cited Hizballah\'s 
extreme Islamist ideology as the reason they lean to Amal. 
Atwi told econoff that he was afraid of what Hizballah might 
do if it were in charge.  At the same time, moderate, 
pro-Western Shia have admitted to us that Hizballah is clean 
of corruption, efficient at providing social services, and 
considered heroic for forcing the Israeli Army to withdraw 
from southern Lebanon in 2000. 
 
11.  (C)  Amal\'s armed element is no match for Hizballah\'s 
military wing, according to Professor Timur Goksel, former 
UNIFIL spokesman and political adviser for 24 years.  Goksel 
estimates that there are as many as 5,000 armed members of 
Amal, but they do not train or operate as an organized 
militia.  Goksel reflected on the days when Amal commanded 
15,000 militiamen and how far it has atrophied since then. 
Bitar had a similar view of Amal\'s armed element, saying that 
the party didn\'t have a \"real militia.\"  Syria and Iran 
restrain Hizballah from routing Amal by force, according to 
Georges Nasr, political officer in the UN mission to southern 
Lebanon. 
 
-------------- 
A BLEAK FUTURE 
-------------- 
 
12.  (S)  As a result of Amal\'s corruption and Berri\'s poor 
leadership, Hizballah\'s political strength is increasing. 
Hamzeh estimates that one-third of Lebanese Shia support 
Amal, while two-thirds support Hizballah.  Hizballah is 
increasing its political power in areas traditionally 
supportive of Amal, like Nabatiyeh and the southern Lebanon 
coast.  Hizballah gained control of Nabatiyeh\'s municipal 
council in elections this year and is seeking to expand its 
influence over this historically independent town of 30,000 
people.  Bitar told us that Hizballah in the past few months 
has opened 40-50 new offices to provide social services, in 
some cases leasing apartments for office space.  Support for 
Amal is weakening in Sidon and the Jezzine area, according to 
Baydun.  Amal is still strong only in the Tyre area, Baydun 
and Hamzeh told us.  They predict Hizballah will likely make 
gains against Amal in next spring\'s parliamentary elections. 
 
13.  (S)  Baydun believes that Amal\'s disorganization may 
lead Syria to replace Berri in the Shia-held position of 
Speaker of Parliament.  He cited as evidence the fact that 
Berri has met with Syrian President Bashar Asad only twice in 
the past 15 months, each time for less than a half hour. 
Baydun listed Surete Generale chief Jamil Sayyid among 
Berri\'s possible Shia successors, following parliamentary 
elections. 
 
14.  (C)  There is no heir apparent in Amal, according to 
Hamzeh.  All of the candidates come from Berri\'s family. 
Hamzeh said Berri\'s son, Abdallah, was being groomed, but 
Berri had not begun to prepare him until recently.  One of 
our contacts described Abdallah Berri as a \"fine young man\" 
as a student who has since become corrupt in his party 
involvement.  Berri\'s wife, Randa, reportedly prefers her 16 
year-old son Basil to Abdallah, but Randa is not well-liked 
in the Shia community. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15.  (S)  All of the people we talked to were anti-Hizballah, 
and some were pro-Amal.  Amal is near universally derided as 
corrupt to the core, but it is also considered the only 
alternative for moderate, secular Shia.  Ahmad Assaad hopes 
to start a third way for Shia by identifying clean 
politicians who do not have an extremist ideology.  This 
would be a positive development for the well-being and 
stability of southern Lebanon.  End comment.
