SUBJECT:  ROMANIAN PRESIDENT ION ILIESCU -- A 
POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY: THIS IS THE FIRST OF TWO CABLES FOCUSING 
ON ROMANIAN PRESIDENT ION ILIESCU, AND COVERS HIS 
POLITICAL HISTORY THROUGH THE 1992 ELECTIONS. 
SEPTEL WILL DEAL WITH HIS CURRENT POWERS AND ROLE IN 
THE ROMANIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM.  ILIESCU, WHO WAS 
BORN INTO A COMMUNIST FAMILY IN 1930, ROSE RAPIDLY 
IN THE PARTY HIERARCHY UNTIL HE BEGAN TO CRITICIZE 
THE EXCESSES OF DICTATOR NICOLAE CEAUSESCU IN THE 
EARLY 1970\'S.  ILIESCU THEN EXPERIENCED A SERIES OF 
DEMOTIONS, AND BY 1984 HAD FALLEN TO THE POSITION OF 
DIRECTOR OF AN OBSCURE PUBLISHING HOUSE.  HOWEVER, 
HE HAD BECOME KNOWN AS A PARTY DISSIDENT, AND WITH 
THE RISE OF GORBACHEV, ILIESCU BEGAN ADVOCATING AN 
OPENING OF ROMANIAN SOCIETY ALONG THE LINES THEN 
BEING PURSUED IN MOSCOW.  IN THE CHAOS WHICH 
FOLLOWED THE SUDDEN FALL OF THE CEAUSESCU REGIME IN 
DECEMBER, 1989, THE INTELLECTUALS WHO WERE SEEKING 
TO ESTABLISH A NEW POLITICAL ORDER TURNED TO THE 
MORE EXPERIENCED ILIESCU FOR LEADERSHIP, AND HE 
QUICKLY BECAME THE DOMINANT FIGURE IN THE AD HOC 
NATIONAL SALVATION FRONT (NSF) GOVERNMENT. 
 
3. GIVEN THE TOTAL LACK OF ORGANIZED OPPOSITION 
GROUPS IN ROMANIA PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION, ILIESCU 
HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO KEEP THE OLD BUREAUCRACY IN 
OFFICE, BUT THIS DECISION ALIENATED THE 
INTELLECTUALS AND THE EMERGING OPPOSITION PARTIES. 
ILIESCU AND THE NSF MOVED QUICKLY TO LAY THE 
FOUNDATIONS FOR A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM AND 
HE WON THE PRESIDENCY HANDILY IN THE MAY, 1990 
ELECTIONS -- WHICH, ALTHOUGH SERIOUSLY FLAWED, 
REFLECTED THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE -- BUT THE 
OPPOSITION PARTIES REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE LEGITIMACY 
OF THE GOVERNMENT AND CLAIMED THAT ILIESCU WAS A 
\"CRYPTO-COMMUNIST.\"  ILIESCU COMPOUNDED HIS PROBLEMS 
BY SUMMONING MINERS TO BUCHAREST IN JUNE, 1990, TO 
END THE OCCUPATION OF A MAJOR SQUARE BY PROTESTING 
STUDENTS.  IN SEPTEMBER, 1991, THE MINERS AGAIN CAME 
TO BUCHAREST AND FORCED THE RESIGNATION OF PRIME 
MINISTER PETRE ROMAN, WITH WHOM ILIESCU HAD EARLIER 
SPLIT DUE TO A DISPUTE ON THE PACE OF REFORM AS WELL 
AS S CLASH OF AMBITIONS.  HOWEVER, ILIESCU THEN 
APPOINTED A RESPECTED TECHNOCRAT AS PRIME MINISTER, 
WHO, WITH ILIESCU\'S BACKING, ORGANIZED THE FREE AND 
FAIR ELECTION OF SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1992.  ILIESCU 
AGAIN WON THE PRESIDENCY BY A WIDE MARGIN, HAVING 
CAMPAIGNED ON A PLATFORM OF GRADUAL REFORM AND A 
STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO EASE THE PAIN OF THE 
TRANSITION TO THE MARKET. 
 
4. GIVEN ILIESCU\'S POLITICAL HISTORY AND OUR CLOSE 
OBSERVATION OF HIM OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, WE HAVE 
NO DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING THAT HE IS COMMITTED TO 
THE DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HE PLAYED A 
LARGE PART IN ESTABLISHING.  HOWEVER, ILIESCU IS 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF RAPID MOVEMENT TOWARD 
PRIVATIZATION ON ROMANIA\'S WORKERS -- NOT 
SURPRISINGLY, IN VIEW OF HIS BACKGROUND.  HE TOLD 
AMBASSADOR MOSES RECENTLY THAT THE 1990 STUDENT 
PROTESTORS IN BUCHAREST WERE REALLY PAWNS OF THE 
REESTABLISHED HISTORIC PARTIES, WHICH WERE USING 
THEM IN AN EFFORT TO RESTORE THE PRE-WWII SOCIAL 
ORDER WITH ITS ENORMOUS DISPARITIES OF WEALTH. 
WHETHER THERE IS ANY TRUTH TO THIS INTERPRETATION OR 
NOT, IT IS INDICATIVE OF ILIESCU\'S VIEWS.  ON 
ECONOMIC MATTERS, HE IS PRO-REFORM BUT WANTS TO 
PROTECT THE WORKERS.  THIS IS BOTH IDEOLOGICAL AND 
REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT HIS POLITICAL BASE AND 
THAT OF HIS PARTY (PDSR) LIES WITH THE ROMANIAN 
WORKERS EMPLOYED FOR THE LAST FOUR DECADES BY STATE- 
OWNED BUSINESSES.  AS HE PUT IT IN THE 1992 
CAMPAIGN, HIS GOAL IS A \"SOCIAL MARKET ECONOMY\" -- 
AN ECONOMY WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE 
ENTERPRISE, BUT ONE IN WHICH STATE REGULATION IS 
USED TO PREVENT THE EXTREME INEQUALITIES AND MASSIVE 
POVERTY WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE PRE-WAR ORDER. 
SINCE 1992, ILIESCU HAS GIVEN MORE SUPPORT TO 
REFORMS, INCLUDING AUSTERITY MEASURES, THAN SUCH 
CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WOULD HAVE LED ONE TO EXPECT 
(SEPTEL), BUT IN OUR VIEW HE WILL NEVER BE PREPARED 
TO GO FURTHER TOWARD AN UNREGULATED MARKET THAN A 
TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN SOCIAL DEMOCRAT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
5. FROM COMMUNIST ORTHODOXY TO DISSIDENCE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
ILIESCU CAME FROM A WORKING CLASS COMMUNIST 
BACKGROUND AND ROSE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE PARTY RANKS 
UNTIL HIS 1971 BREAK WITH CEAUSESCU.  ILIESCU\'S 
FATHER, A RAILWAY WORKER, WAS ONE OF THE FEW ETHNIC 
ROMANIAN ACTIVISTS IN THE TINY PRE-WWII ROMANIAN 
COMMUNIST PARTY (RCP).  ILIESCU HIMSELF JOINED THE 
COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION IN 1944 AT THE AGE OF 
14 AND, AFTER OBTAINING HYDROENGINEERING DEGREES 
FROM THE BUCHAREST POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND THE 
MOSCOW ENERGY INSTITUTE, HELD POSITIONS ON THE YOUTH 
ORGANIZATION\'S CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  IN 1965 HE BECAME 
AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE RCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND 
IN 1967 HE WAS MADE A FULL MEMBER, AS WELL AS BEING 
APPOINTED MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS.  IN 1969 HE WAS 
NAMED AN ALTERNATE MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE\'S 
POWERFUL POLITICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE (POLITBURO). 
 
6. DESPITE HIS ORTHODOX COMMUNIST BACKGROUND AND 
RAPID RISE IN THE PARTY HIERARCHY, ILIESCU BEGAN TO 
CRITICIZE CEAUSESCU\'S GROWING CULT OF PERSONALITY, 
NEPOTISM, AND EXTREME ECONOMIC CENTRALIZATION 
POLICIES.  AS A RESULT, AND PROBABLY ALSO BECAUSE HE 
WAS VIEWED IN SOME QUARTERS AS A POSSIBLE EVENTUAL 
SUCCESSOR TO CEAUSESCU, HE WAS DISMISSED FROM THE 
YOUTH MINISTRY IN 1971 AND DEMOTED TO THE POSITION 
OF SECRETARY OF THE TIMIS COUNTY RCP.  IN 1974, 
ILIESCU OBTAINED THE MORE IMPORTANT POSITION OF 
FIRST SECRETARY OF THE IASI COUNTY RCP, BUT HIS 
OUTSPOKENNESS AND LOCAL POPULARITY AGAIN LED TO 
DEMOTION IN 1978, THIS TIME TO THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF 
THE WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL.  HE ALSO LOST HIS 
POLITICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE POSITION THAT YEAR. 
NEVERTHELESS, ILIESCU CONTINUED TO TAKE A CRITICAL 
STANCE TOWARD THE CEAUSESCU REGIME, AND IN 1984 HE 
LOST BOTH HIS RCP CENTRAL COMMITTEE SEAT AND EVEN 
HIS WATER RESOURCES COUNCIL POSITION.  FROM 1984 TO 
THE DECEMBER 1989 REVOLUTION, ILIESCU SERVED IN 
OBSCURITY AS THE DIRECTOR OF A TECHNICAL PUBLISHING 
HOUSE, BUT DURING THIS PERIOD HE BEGAN ADVOCATING AN 
OPENING OF ROMANIAN SOCIETY ALONG THE LINES BEING 
PURSUED BY GORBACHEV IN THE THEN USSR. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. ILIESCU STEPS INTO THE POST-REVOLUTIONARY 
   LEADERSHIP VACUUM 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
DESPITE HIS YEARS IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS, 
ILIESCU WAS WELL-KNOWN AND POPULAR AMONG POLITICALLY 
ATTUNED ROMANIANS ON THE EVE OF THE 1989 REVOLUTION. 
SINCE THERE WERE NO DISSIDENT GROUPS IN ROMANIA 
READY AND WAITING TO TAKE POWER FOLLOWING THE SUDDEN 
FALL OF CEAUSESCU, THE ISSUE OF WHO WOULD NOW RUN 
THE COUNTRY FELL BY DEFAULT INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE 
CITIZENS OF BUCHAREST -- PRIMARILY INTELLECTUALS -- 
WHO HAD GATHERED SPONTANEOUSLY AT VARIOUS SITES TO 
DISCUSS THE CHAOTIC SITUATION CREATED BY THE 
COLLAPSE OF THE DICTATORSHIP.  MANY OF THEM TURNED 
TO THE POLITICALLY MORE EXPERIENCED ILIESCU FOR 
LEADERSHIP BECAUSE HE HAD ANTI-CEAUSESCU CREDENTIALS 
AND SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND HOW ORDER COULD BE RESTORED 
QUICKLY.  ILIESCU ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EMERGED AS THE 
DOMINANT FIGURE IN THE AD HOC NATIONAL SALVATION 
FRONT (NSF) GOVERNMENT. 
 
8. COMMENT: OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF THE 1989 
REVOLUTION HAVE IT THAT ILIESCU AND LIKE-MINDED 
PARTY DISSIDENTS HAD EITHER BEEN PLOTTING A COUP AND 
USED THE REVOLUTION AS A COVER TO STAGE IT, OR 
STEPPED IN AND \"STOLE\" THE REVOLUTION AS IT WAS 
OCCURRING.  WE FIND THE FIRST INTERPRETATION TOO 
PARANOID TO BE ACCEPTABLE WITHOUT OVERWHELMING 
PROOF.  AS FOR THE SECOND, SINCE THE REVOLUTION WAS 
NOT LED BY AN ESTABLISHED ANTI-COMMUNIST GROUP SUCH 
AS SOLIDARITY, BUT BROKE OUT SPONTANEOUSLY, WHO IS 
ILIESCU SUPPOSED TO HAVE STOLEN IT FROM?  END 
COMMENT. 
 
---------------- 
9. TWO BAD YEARS 
---------------- 
 
DUE TO THE LACK OF ORGANIZED ANTI-COMMUNIST 
OPPOSITION FORCES PRIOR TO THE REVOLUTION, ILIESCU 
HAD NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO KEEP THE OLD POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC BUREAUCRACY IN OFFICE, EXCEPT AT THE VERY 
HIGHEST LEVELS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN HIS OWN BACKGROUND, 
HE PROBABLY FELT NO DESIRE TO PURGE THOSE OFFICIALS 
WHO WERE READY AND ABLE TO ADJUST TO A NEW POLITICAL 
SYSTEM.  (NOTE: A POINT OF VIEW MORE ACCEPTABLE NOW 
THAT FORMER COMMUNISTS HOLD POWER THROUGHOUT MUCH OF 
THE REGION.  END NOTE.)  MANY OF THE INTELLECTUALS 
WHO HAD INITIALLY SUPPORTED ILIESCU TURNED AGAINST 
HIM BECAUSE OF HIS FAILURE TO PURGE THE BUREAUCRACY 
AND HIS LATER DECISION TO TURN THE NSF INTO A PARTY 
-- ONE WHICH THE BUREAUCRATS HE HAD RETAINED IN 
OFFICE NATURALLY SUPPORTED.  GIVEN ILIESCU\'S OWN 
COMMUNIST PAST, IT WAS EASY FOR THE INTELLECTUALS 
AND THE EMERGING OPPOSITION PARTIES TO DISPUTE THE 
VERY LEGITIMACY OF THE PROVISIONAL NSF GOVERNMENT -- 
A TACTIC WHOSE CONTINUED USE STILL EMBITTERS 
ROMANIAN POLITICS TODAY. 
 
10. ILIESCU AND THE NSF QUICKLY MOVED TO ESTABLISH 
CIVIL LIBERTIES AND A PLURALISTIC POLITICAL SYSTEM. 
HOWEVER, THE MAY 1990 ELECTIONS, IN WHICH ILIESCU 
WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT WITH 85& OF THE VOTE, WERE 
SERIOUSLY FLAWED.  THE NSF HAD CONSIDERABLE 
ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF CONTROL OF AND/OR ACCESS TO 
THE MEDIA, FUNDS, AND OTHER RESOURCES BASIC TO AN 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN.  WORSE, NSF SUPPORTERS 
INTIMIDATED AND HARASSED OPPOSITION CANDIDATES IN 
THE RURAL AREAS.  ALTHOUGH ILIESCU AND THE NSF WOULD 
HAVE WON IN ANY CASE, THE NATURE OF THE CAMPAIGN 
ALLOWED THE OPPOSITION TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OF 
THE RESULTS, AND THEY CONTINUED TO ASSERT THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS ILLEGITIMATE AND ILIESCU A \"CRYPTO- 
COMMUNIST.\" 
 
11. ILIESCU THEN COMPOUNDED HIS PROBLEMS BY MAKING 
THE WORST MISTAKE OF HIS POST-REVOLUTION CAREER -- 
CALLING MINERS INTO BUCHAREST IN JUNE, 1990, TO 
BREAK UP A MONTHS LONG OCCUPATION OF A CENTRAL 
SQUARE BY STUDENT PROTESTORS.  (NOTE: ILIESCU HAS 
CLAIMED, NOT VERY CONVINCINGLY, THAT HE DID NOT CALL 
IN THE MINERS AND THAT THEIR ARRIVAL IN BUCHAREST 
RESULTED FROM THEIR OWN PATRIOTIC INITIATIVE.  END 
NOTE.)  THE MINERS NOT ONLY USED VIOLENCE AGAINST 
THE STUDENTS, BUT ATTACKED THE OFFICES OF OPPOSITION 
PARTIES AS WELL.  ILIESCU\'S IMAGE ABROAD SANK STILL 
FURTHER WHEN HE SPLIT WITH HIS NSF PRIME MINISTER, 
PETRE ROMAN, ON THE GROUND THAT ROMAN WAS MOVING TOO 
QUICKLY ON ECONOMIC REFORM, BUT ALSO DUE TO CLASHING 
AMBITIONS AND SHARPLY CONTRASTING PERSONAL STYLES. 
AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF DISSENSION WITHIN THE NSF, 
THE MINERS CAME TO BUCHAREST AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER OF 
1991 TO DEMAND ROMAN\'S OUSTER.  THIS TIME, HOWEVER, 
IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN SUMMONED OR 
HAD COME OF THEIR OWN VOLITION DUE TO A DROP IN 
THEIR REAL INCOME WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTED TO ROMAN\'S 
POLICIES.  WHATEVER THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE, ON 
ARRIVAL IN THE CAPITAL SOME OF THE MINERS BEGAN 
CALLING FOR ILIESCU\'S DEPARTURE AS WELL AS ROMAN\'S, 
AND MARCHED ON HIS OFFICE AT COTROCENI PALACE. 
ILIESCU RESPONDED BY OBTAINING ROMAN\'S RESIGNATION, 
WHICH DEFUSED THE SITUATION AND ENABLED HIM TO GET 
THE MINERS TO LEAVE BUCHAREST PEACEFULLY.  SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER THE NSF BROKE UP, AND ROMAN AND THE YOUNG 
TECHNOCRATS WHO SUPPORTED HIM FORMED THEIR OWN PARTY 
WHILE THE BUREAUCRATS REMAINED WITH ILIESCU. 
 
12. COMMENT: ILIESCU HAS TOLD US THAT THE STUDENTS 
PROTESTS OF SPRING 1990 WERE INSPIRED BY THE NEWLY 
REESTABLISHED HISTORICAL PARTIES -- THE NATIONAL 
PEASANT PARTY (PNTCD) AND THE NATIONAL LIBERAL PARTY 
(PNL).  THESE PARTIES, HE ARGUED, WERE ATTEMPTING TO 
USE THE STUDENTS TO \"STEAL\" THE 1989 REVOLUTION FOR 
THEIR OWN PURPOSES: REVERSAL OF THE TREND TOWARD 
EGALITARIANISM WHICH CAME WITH POST-WWII COMMUNIST 
RULE AND THE RESTORATION OF THE PRE-WWII SOCIAL 
ORDER, AN ORDER MARKED IN ILIESCU\'S VIEW (AND IN 
FACT) BY ENORMOUS DISPARITIES OF WEALTH AND MASSIVE 
POVERTY.  ALTHOUGH MORE PRO-REFORM THAN MANY OTHER 
OFFICIALS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PM 
VACAROIU, ILIESCU FAVORS A PARTIAL GRATIS 
DISTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP IN PRIVATIZED ENTERPRISES 
TO THE ROMANIAN PEOPLE, AS EVIDENCED BY THE RECENTLY 
ENACTED MASS PRIVATIZATION LAW WHICH PROVIDES THAT 
ALL CITIZENS WILL RECEIVE OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATES OF 
EQUAL VALUE TO EXCHANGE FOR STOCK IN THE ENTERPRISES 
TO BE TO BE PRIVATIZED.  ILIESCU IS ALSO ANXIOUS TO 
AVERT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE MASSIVE 
UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH COULD FOLLOW FROM PRIVATIZATION 
AND ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING.  IT IS ILIESCU\'S OWN 
LABOR CONSTITUENCY -- WHICH ENJOYED JOB SECURITY, IF 
LITTLE ELSE, DURING THE COMMUNIST REGIME -- WHICH 
WOULD BE MOST NEGATIVELY EFFECTED, AND HE IS 
NATURALLY RELUCTANT TO RISK ALIENATING IT BY TAKING 
THE LEAD IN FORCING RADICAL RESTRUCTURING.  ILIESCU 
MAY HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT THE HISTORICAL PARTIES -- 
WHOSE CONSTITUENCIES HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM 
PRIVATIZATION -- WOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN PERSUADING 
ROMANIANS TO ACCEPT THE TEMPORARY PAIN WHICH 
RESTRUCTURING ENTAILS; BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE 
NOT EVEN SUPPORTED THE GOR\'S OWN MOVES IN THE 
DIRECTION OF REFORM, PREFERRING TO CRITICIZE THEM 
FOR THE SAKE OF POLITICAL ADVANTAGE.  NEVERTHELESS, 
ILIESCU HIMSELF IS UNWILLING TO PUSH FOR RAPID 
RESTRUCTURING IF THE PRICE IS UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE 
MANY AND MASSIVE AGGREGATIONS OF WEALTH FOR A FEW. 
 
13.  COMMENT CONTINUED: AS ILIESCU PUT IT DURING THE 
1992 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- AND HE HAS NOT 
DEVIATED SINCE -- HIS GOAL IS \"A SOCIAL MARKET 
ECONOMY,\" NOT \"SAVAGE CAPITALISM.\"  IN OTHER WORDS, 
PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE ENTERPRISE ARE FINE SO 
LONG AS STATE REGULATION PREVENTS THE CREATION OF 
ENORMOUS INCOME AND CLASS DISPARITIES.  THUS, WHILE 
ILIESCU FULLY SUPPORTED THE POST-REVOLUTION SALE OF 
STATE-OWNED APARTMENTS TO THEIR TENANTS AT BARGAIN 
PRICES -- A MOVE WHICH CREATED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF HOME OWNERS AT A STROKE -- HE HAS JUST AS 
VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED THE PHYSICAL RETURN OF 
NATIONALIZED DWELLINGS TO THEIR FORMER OWNERS, WHOM 
HE PROBABLY CONSIDERS, BUT HAS NOT PUBLICLY 
DESCRIBED, AS PRE-WAR \"ARISTOCRATS\".  ILIESCU\'S 
VETOES OF ATTEMPTS BY EX-KING MICHAEL TO TRAVEL TO 
ROMANIA UNTIL HE FORMALLY RENOUNCES THE THRONE AND 
PLEDGES NOT TO USE A VISIT TO INCITE PRO-MONARCHIST 
DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE ALSO NO DOUBT BEEN INSPIRED IN 
LARGE MEASURE BY HIS AVERSION TO THE POLITICAL AND 
SOCIAL ORDER OF PRE-WAR ROMANIA.  IN ANY CASE, 
HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT FOR 
RESTORING THE MONARCHY (NO MORE THAN 20& HAVE EVER 
FAVORED IT, ACCORDING TO PUBLIC OPINION POLLS) AND 
EVEN THE PNTCD IS NOW DOWNPLAYING ITS TRADITIONAL 
MONARCHISM.  END COMMENT. 
 
------------------------ 
14. THE TURN OF THE TIDE 
------------------------ 
 
FOLLOWING THE FALL OF THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT, ILIESCU 
IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF STEPS 
WHICH REESTABLISHED HIS CREDENTIALS AS A POLITICAL 
DEMOCRAT AND AN ADVOCATE, HOWEVER CAUTIOUS, OF 
ECONOMIC REFORM. HE APPOINTED TEODOR STOLOJAN, A 
WELL-RESPECTED ECONOMIST WITHOUT PARTY AFFILIATION, 
AS PRIME MINISTER.  STOLOJAN, WITH ILIESCU\'S 
SUPPORT, DEFINED HIS PRIMARY TASK AS ORGANIZING FREE 
AND FAIR LOCAL AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS WITHIN A YEAR, 
AFTER WHICH HE WOULD RESIGN.  DURING THE RUN-UP TO 
THE FALL 1992 ELECTIONS, ILIESCU AND HIS PARTY -- 
SHORTLY TO BE RENAMED THE PARTY OF SOCIAL DEMOCRACY 
(PDSR) -- CAMPAIGNED ON A PLATFORM OF GRADUAL 
ECONOMIC REFORM AND A STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO 
MINIMIZE THE PAIN OF THE TRANSITION TO THE MARKET. 
THE PDSR WON 27& OF THE VOTE IN THE ELECTIONS -- 
WHICH ALL INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS CONSIDERED FAIR 
AND FREE --  WHICH GAVE IT A PLURALITY.  ILIESCU DID 
FAR BETTER THAN HIS PARTY.  RUNNING AGAINST FIVE 
OTHER CANDIDATES, HE WON 47& OF THE VOTE IN THE 
FIRST ROUND OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS.  IN THE 
SECOND ROUND, RUNNING ONLY AGAINST THE STRONGEST 
OPPOSITION CANDIDATE, ILIESCU TOOK 61& OF THE VOTE. 
 
15. COMMENT: MOST ANALYSTS HERE ATTRIBUTE ILIESCU\'S 
1992 VICTORY TO HIS COMBINATION OF DIGNITY, WHICH 
ROMANIANS EXPECT OF A PRESIDENT, AND A \"COMMON MAN\" 
APPROACH -- ONE OF ILIESCU\'S MOST EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN 
SLOGANS WAS \"FROM US, FOR US.\"  IN OUR VIEW, ILIESCU 
DOES CONSIDER HIMSELF TO BE, IF NOT A COMMON MAN, 
THEN AT LEAST THE COMMON MAN\'S DEFENDER.  THIS 
ATTITUDE IS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF HIS COMMITMENT TO 
EGALITARIANISM AND HATRED OF THE PRE-WAR SOCIAL 
ORDER, AND HAS BEEN REFLECTED NOT ONLY IN HIS 
POSITION ON SUCH ISSUES AS NATIONALIZED HOUSING, BUT 
IN HIS REPEATED -- BUT UNHEEDED -- DEMANDS THAT THE 
MP\'S OF HIS OWN PARTY EITHER RESIGN FROM LUCRATIVE 
ECONOMIC POSITIONS ON THE BOARDS OF STATE 
ENTERPRISES OR LEAVE PARLIAMENT,  AS WELL AS IN HIS 
DENUNCIATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN GENERAL.  IT IS 
SIGNIFICANT THAT ILIESCU IS ONE OF THE FEW POLITICAL 
LEADERS HERE WHO HAS NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO CONSTANT 
-- AND IN MANY CASES, WELL-GROUNDED -- ACCUSATIONS 
OF CORRUPTION.  IN FACT, SOME OPPOSITION LEADERS 
CRITICIZED ILIESCU\'S STATED DESIRE TO \"DIE A POOR 
MAN\" NOT ON GROUNDS OF HYPOCRISY, BUT OF 
\"STUPIDITY.\" 
 
16. COMMENT CONTINUED: HOWEVER, ILIESCU IS NOW 
CAUGHT IN A POLITICAL VICE BETWEEN HIS PRO-REFORM, 
PRO-WESTERN POLICIES AND HIS POLITICAL BASE, WHICH 
IS FIRMLY GROUNDED IN A CONSTITUENCY THAT FEARS 
RAPID CHANGE, BEING THE LEAST ABLE TO COPE WITH A 
FREE MARKET AND FULL LABOR MOBILITY.  CONTROLLING 
INFLATION AND RAISING REAL WAGES, EVEN MINIMALLY, 
HAVE HELPED, BUT IN THE LONG-RUN HIS PRO-REFORM 
POLICIES WILL UNDERMINE HIM AND HIS PARTY IN 
ROMANIA.  ILIESCU WILL CONTINUE TO BE PORTRAYED BY 
THE OPPOSITION AS A CRYPTO-COMMUNIST MASQUERADING IN 
WESTERN GARB.  BUT WHILE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE 
HISTORIC PARTIES (PEASANT AND LIBERAL) TALK REFORM, 
THEY VOTED AGAINST THE IMF AGREEMENT AND THE MASS 
PRIVATIZATION LAW TO DENY THE GOVERNMENT THE 
LEGITIMACY THAT THEIR CONCURRENCE WOULD HAVE 
BROUGHT.  ILIESCU IS ATTEMPTING TO SURVIVE ON THE 
HORNS OF THIS DILEMMA BY PROTECTING THE WORKER AT 
THE SAME TIME THAT ROMANIA PRIVATIZES, PRIMARILY BY 
MEANS OF MANAGEMENT-EMPLOYEE BUY-OUTS (MEBO\'S), 
WHICH CONTINUE TO BE PERMITTED UNDER THE MASS 
PRIVATIZATION LAW, COMBINED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATES TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS POLICY 
MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM POLITICAL BENEFITS BUT LONG-TERM 
NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR A COUNTRY THAT WILL SOON 
HAVE MORE THAN 3000 FORMER STATE-OWNED BUSINESSES 
OWNED AND OPERATED BY MANAGEMENT -- AND/OR MILLIONS 
OF NEW SMALL SHAREHOLDERS -- AND PRESENT EMPLOYEES, 
WITH CONFLICTING SHORT AND LONG-TERM INTERESTS. 
 
17. COMMENT CONTINUED: ILIESCU\'S \"COMMON MAN\" 
ORIENTATION IS ALSO REFLECTED IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. 
HE AND HIS WIFE ELENA, WHO HAS AN ENGINEERING 
DEGREE, ARE CHILDLESS AND LIVE MODESTLY IN AN 
APARTMENT BUILDING WHICH CONTAINS FOUR OTHER UNITS. 
THEY NEVER APPEAR ON THE BUCHAREST NIGHT LIFE 
CIRCUIT AND ELENA IS VERY RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC AT 
ALL, NOR DOES SHE ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND ON HIS 
OFFICIAL TRIPS ABROAD.  ILIESCU HAS LEARNED TO SPEAK 
ENGLISH QUITE WELL SINCE THE 1989 REVOLUTION, AND 
ALSO SPEAKS RUSSIAN, FRENCH, AND SOME SPANISH. 
ELENA ILIESCU DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH.  HOWEVER, SHE 
IS REPORTED TO HAVE INTELLECTUAL INTERESTS AND TO BE 
A READER OF AMERICAN FICTION.  ILIESCU, WHO 
RECOVERED RAPIDLY FROM GALL BLADDER SURGERY LAST 
SUMMER, APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH.  HIS WIFE, 
HOWEVER, REPORTEDLY HAS A SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEM -- 
PERHAPS CANCER.  END COMMENT.

1. (S) Summary.  President Traian Basescu told an interagency 
team led by Ambassador Richard Jones, Senior Advisor to the 
Secretary and Coordinator for Iraq Policy, July 21 that 
 
SIPDIS 
Romania is \"unconditionally committed\" to a continued troop 
presence in Iraq.  Basescu highlighted the armed forces\' 
financial burdens in light of recent massive domestic flood 
relief efforts and stated that additional USG financial 
support for defense reform might permit Romania to increase 
its contribution in Iraq.  Though not a member of the Paris 
Club, Basescu confirmed that Romania has agreed to Paris Club 
terms and will forgive 80 percent of Iraq\'s debts, which 
total USD 2.6 billion.  President Basescu also raised 
Romania\'s request to interview security detainee and 
Iraqi-American citizen Mohammed Munaf, who is a criminal 
suspect in Romania.  Defense Minister Atanasiu reaffirmed the 
GOR\'s commitment in Iraq but provided insights into cost 
saving measures under consideration by the MOD, including 
possible reductions of overseas deployments in 2006.  Senior 
MFA interlocutors also underscored the GOR\'s support for a 
continued GOR presence in Iraq, stressing the importance of a 
renewed UNSC mandate as well as an Iraqi government request 
for a Multinational Force (MNF) presence.  End Summary. 
 
President Basescu: Unconditional Commitment to Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
2. (C) Ambassador Jones initiated the meeting with President 
Basescu, accompanied by State Counselor for National Security 
General Constantin Degeratu and State Counselor for 
International Relations Anca Ilinoiu, by expressing gratitude 
for Romania\'s steadfast commitment in Iraq.  Ambassador Jones 
singled out Romania\'s contribution to UN force protection in 
Basra as particularly significant, given that an abiding 
international civilian presence in Iraq, such as the UN 
mission, remains a high priority and constitutes a bellwether 
for other international organizations of improved security 
conditions. 
 
3. (C) Basescu stated that the GOR faces deep budgetary 
problems in the wake of recent severe flooding across Romania 
(Ref B).  He characterized the flood-affected areas as 
covering a \"small surface but having a huge impact,\" with 
bridges, railroads and villages destroyed and thousands 
rendered temporarily homeless.  He noted that the GOR has 
incurred mammoth costs operating an \"air bridge\" between 
Bucharest and flood ravaged zones.  Naturally, he continued, 
Romania\'s armed forces have played a key role in providing 
relief and organizing cleanup and repair.  So far, the 
Romanian military has spent about USD 60 million and 
anticipates spending USD 100 million on flood related 
activities.  Flood relief costs have placed tremendous 
pressures on the armed forces\' budget.  In addition to limits 
imposed by fiscal constraints, Basescu said that despite the 
absence of \"signals from the population\" opposing Romania\'s 
overseas deployments, some journalists could begin to ask 
\"Why not use our troops here?\" given the urgency of the flood 
crisis. 
 
4. (C) Basescu explained that the armed forces face another 
\"major problem\" - delays in planned MOD modernization and 
reform this year and in 2004.  \"I am really disappointed that 
reform is not going fast enough, there are still too many 
conscripts,\" the President observed.  (Note: The MOD\'s goal 
is an all-professional armed forces by 2007.  End Note.) 
Basescu asked if it would be possible for the USG to increase 
support for defense reform. 
 
5. (C) Basescu immediately added, however, \"we will not put 
any condition on participation in Iraq and Afghanistan if 
support cannot be increased.\"  He promised that Romania will 
\"remain an ally until the end of the mission, we won\'t play 
politically.\"  Romania will not put a \"question mark\" around 
its participation and \"will not in any event diminish 
participation in Afghanistan and Iraq.\"  Nonetheless, he 
continued, financial support could permit the GOR to consider 
increasing its contribution in Iraq.  Basescu stated that, in 
any event, troop withdrawal by the end of 2006 is 
\"optimistic\" and \"we are mentally prepared for the extension 
of our presence in Iraq.\" 
 
6. (C) Ambassador Jones expressed appreciation for Basescu\'s 
realistic assessment of the need for a continued 
Multinational Force (MNF) presence beyond 2006.  Both the 
Ambassador and team member Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, US 
Army CENTCOM, discussed ongoing efforts to increase the 
quality of Iraqi security forces, such as embedding MNF teams 
in Iraqi units, with the ultimate goal of enabling the Iraqis 
to take over the fight against terrorists and insurgents.  BG 
Kimmitt underscored that on-the-ground conditions rather than 
an artificial calendar must drive MNF force contributions. 
 
Basescu Proposes Possible Gendarme Training 
------------------------------------------- 
7. (C) Basescu stated he had spoken with the Romanian 
Interior Minister Vasile Blaga regarding possible additional 
contributions Romania could make to strengthen Iraqi 
institutions.  He said that Romania \"could send trainers to 
train the gendarmerie in Iraq.\" BG Kimmitt described the 
enduring need for a well-trained Iraqi gendarmerie and 
outlined possible training modalities.  Basescu affirmed that 
although Romania is a small country with \"limited resources\" 
it will remain a \"solid partner\" and contribute in areas 
where it can, such as gendarme training. 
 
Debt Reduction Pledge 
--------------------- 
8. (C) President Basescu stated that following a recent Paris 
Club agreement Romania has decided to reduce its Iraq debt 
(which totals USD 2.6 billion) by 80 percent.  He noted that 
Romania is not a member of the Paris Club but voluntarily 
complied with its debt reduction Recommendation.  Ambassador 
Jones expressed appreciation for Romania\'s decision to 
substantially forgive its Iraqi debt, observing that among 
the three prongs of international support for Iraq - 
military, political and economic - economic assistance has 
been the weakest prong.  Ambassador Jones noted that Romania 
is a good example for other creditors, especially non-Paris 
Club members and nations like Romania that face financial 
constraints. 
 
Romanian Access to Security Detainee Munaf 
------------------------------------------ 
9. (S) Basescu raised the subject of Iraqi-American national 
Mohammed Munaf, now held as a security internee by Coalition 
Forces in Iraq under the authority of UNSCR 1546, asserting 
that Romanian \"prosecutors need to have a discussion with 
him\" because of his suspected involvement in the kidnapping 
of three Romanian journalists earlier this year.  He stated 
that the GOR continues to seek the approval of American 
authorities to meet with Munaf for a \"four hour discussion.\" 
He continued that the GOR believes Munaf can provide key 
information about the ongoing prosecution of alleged 
kidnapping mastermind, 
Syrian-Romanian businessman Omar Hayssam, whom Basescu 
asserted is suspected of providing \"financial resources to 
terrorists.\"  Basescu promised that the GOR would \"respect 
all procedures\" during the interview and would conduct the 
interview in any location designated by the USG, given that 
he is a security detainee.  He added that, pursuant to 
Romanian law, his lawyer would \"probably like to attend\" the 
interview.  In response to a direct query from Ambassador 
Jones, Basescu said that the interview did not need to take 
place in the Romanian Embassy as a previous diplomatic note 
had indicated.  Ambassador Jones promised to help facilitate 
appropriate GOR access to Munaf.  Regarding Munaf\'s final 
disposition, Ambassador Jones encouraged Romania to engage in 
a close dialogue with Iraq.  Basescu replied that Romania 
already has an \"extremely close\" dialogue with Iraq on Munaf 
and other issues. 
 
Committed - But Cautious - Defense Ministry 
------------------------------------------- 
10.  (C) In a separate meeting at the MOD, Defense Minister 
Teodor Atanasiu, accompanied by State Secretary for 
Euro-Atlantic Integration and Defense Policy Ion Mircea 
Plangu and CHOD General Eugen Badalan, began his comments by 
noting that the GOR has \"the commitment to remain until the 
Iraqi armed forces can take over.\"  Atanasiu asserted that 
costs related to the recent flooding compel Romania to 
consider either reducing its overseas deployments or seeking 
\"cofinancing.\"  Absent \"substantial financing,\" Atanasiu 
continued, Romania \"should consider reduction of its troops 
overseas by 300\" in 2006.  (Note: According to MOD 
statistics, about 1700 Romanian troops are currently deployed 
overseas, with more than 850 in Iraq and 540 in Afghanistan. 
End Note.) 
11.  (C) Atanasiu iterated that \"we will maintain our forces 
in Iraq until the Iraqi forces can take over\" but Romania 
must consider various options for its 2006 overseas 
deployments including \"proportional reductions\" or \"equal 
reductions.\"  In the latter alternative, Romania would 
withdraw a total of three companies (i.e. about one hundred 
troops in each company) from the Western Balkans, Afghanistan 
and Iraq.  Atanasiu added that the GOR is currently weighing 
whether to withdraw its frigate from participation in 
Operation Active Endeavor in Mediterranean, with a decision 
likely this month or in August.  Atanasiu and CHOD Badalan 
outlined several possible cost saving measures, including 
overseas deployment reductions, \"delay in equipment 
modernization,\" and cancellation of exercises, before 
concluding that the MOD will consider a \"mixture of options\" 
for cost saving.  Badalan interjected that the bottom line is 
that the MOD must seek a solution 
to save the 60 million dollars it has already spent on flood 
relief efforts.  Atanasiu explained that the GOR also faces 
\"budgetary concerns\" related to anticipated EU accession in 
2007, which limit excessive deficits.  BG Kimmitt encouraged 
the MOD and MFA to consult closely with the U.S. before 
making any changes in Romania\'s force presence overseas.  He 
emphasized that maintaining the force protection unit for the 
UN at Basra is and should remain a top priority. 
 
12.  (C) The CHOD added that the MOD needs to justify its 
activities in a post flood environment, which means telling 
the Romanian people either that money earmarked for overseas 
deployments comes from external sources (read: donors) or the 
MOD is reducing its overseas commitments.  The Charge noted 
that the USG is exploring ways to assist with flood relief. 
 
The Centrality of a UN Mandate 
------------------------------ 
13.  (SBU)  Following a working lunch with MFA officials, MFA 
Director General for Global Affairs Stelian Stoian chaired an 
interagency working group that discussed the GOR\'s continued 
commitment to a troop presence in Iraq.  Key GOR participants 
were MOD Director General Claudiu Degeratu, External 
Intelligence Service (SIE) Director General Silviu Predoiu, 
Internal Intelligence Service (SRI) Colonel Mihai Munteanu, 
MFA NATO Division Director Mirela Maghiar, and MFA Middle 
East Division Deputy Director Laura Mircea. 
 
14. (C) MFA State Secretary for Global Affairs Teodor 
Baconschi, the de facto number two Foreign Ministry official, 
joined the interagency meeting in progress and reaffirmed the 
GOR\'s commitment to a continued presence in Iraq as expressed 
earlier in the day by President Basescu\'s \"message.\"  He 
underscored that the GOR supports the \"extension of the 
mandate\" authorizing the presence of the MNF, as provided by 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546.  MFA DG 
Stoian stressed that a new UN mandate should be 
\"comprehensive, so that the MNF 
can defend itself and the people, covering all 
possibilities.\"  Stoian also asked whether the Iraqi 
government \"is ready to request officially that the UN 
authorize a military presence in Iraq post-elections?\" 
Ambassador Jones observed that Iraq recognizes that a 
continued MNF presence there is essential and the USG will 
engage in \"close consultations\" with the Iraqis.  (Note: 
UNSC 1546, Articles 9 and 10, provide that the \"presence of 
the MNF is at the request of the incoming Interim Government 
of Iraq and that the MNF will have the authority \"to take all 
necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of 
security and stability in Iraq.\"  Senior GOR leaders strongly 
seek a continued UN mandate and explicit Iraqi government 
request for an MNF presence.  Additionally, they recognize 
the importance of robust ROE for MNF participants.  End Note.) 
 
Engaging Reluctant Europeans 
---------------------------- 
15. (C) Baconschi asked about the possible impact on USG 
relations with \"new\" European states that have \"announced 
their intention to withdraw,\" opining that Romania and Poland 
are the United States\' \"strongest\" Eastern European allies in 
Iraq.  BG Kimmitt noted that the coalition remains solid; 
with the exception of Spain, no other nation in the 62-member 
coalition has formally announced that it is concluding its 
activities in Iraq, although some states have reduced or 
modified their contribution or already carried out their 
pledged contribution.  He continued that the leadership of 
Romania and Poland has been significant in maintaining the 
coalition\'s solidarity.  Ambassador Jones pointed out that 
after nearly two and one half years the coalition remains 
alive and well. 
 
16. (C) DG Stoian stressed that the GOR, an EU aspirant, now 
participates in the EU working group addressing the 
development of an EU common foreign policy.  The GOR is 
working to \"generate support\" from EU countries for 
engagement in Iraq and \"EU reluctance is not as strong as it 
was one year ago.\"  Stoian cited the possible engagement of 
gendarme units in training Iraqi forces as one example of how 
the U.S. \"can count on Romania to try to get more Europeans 
involved.\"  Baconschi underscored these remarks by promising 
that the GOR will remain \"proactive in the EU and seek a new 
climate among member states.\" 
 
UN Force Protection 
------------------- 
17. (C) During the interagency meeting, Ambassador Jones 
highlighted the importance of Romania\'s contributions to UN 
force protection, noting that a successful UN presence 
encourages the presence of other international organization. 
DG Stoian praised UN \"experience and expertise\" in preparing 
for Iraqi elections and observed that the UN presence boosts 
the electoral process\' credibility.  Stoian also solicited 
the team\'s views about NATO\'s role in Iraq.  BG Kimmitt 
responded that NATO provides \"value added\" in Iraq and that 
the MNF and NATO complement each other\'s activities. 
 
18.  (C) Comment.  The GOR has demonstrated steady progress 
on its defense modernization efforts notwithstanding 
Basescu\'s expressed concerns about the slow pace of reforms. 
According to a close presidential advisor, Basescu raised the 
topic in order to suggest a possible source of USG funding 
support that would, ultimately, allow the GOR to continue, 
possibly even increase, its impressive troop commitment in 
Iraq.  The Romanians\' worries about funding sources in the 
wake of this summer\'s flooding are well founded.  Over the 
past several weeks, Romania has faced its most serious 
humanitarian crisis since the fall of communism in 1989. 
Humanitarian concerns aside, the financial impact has been 
devastating, not just in the MOD but throughout the GOR, 
which is cash strapped at the best of times.  Against this 
backdrop, overseas deployments could \"backfire\" against the 
GOR as ordinary Romanians question the presence of Romanian 
troops overseas when their manpower, know how and equipment 
are needed to clean up and reconstruct in the wake of the 
flooding.  Under these circumstances, Romania\'s unequivocal 
promise to maintain troops in Iraq, its pledge to forgive the 
lion\'s share of its Iraq debt and its willingness to help 
train Iraqi gendarmes even if additional funding support is 
not available, demonstrate the depth of its engagement to 
building democracy and fighting terrorism in Iraq.   End

D D 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Joint U.S. and British Embassy discussions 
with Romanian government (GOR) officials reveal little 
enthusiasm for debt reduction for Iraq.  Instead, Romania is 
aiming for a &flexible8 solution that could involve oil 
deliveries, equity in joint ventures or debt restructuring. 
GOR officials will meet with Iraq officials next week to 
discuss the debt issue.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Embassy Econoffs on December 9 and 10, joined with the 
British Economic First Secretary to encourage the Romanian 
government to look favorably on the recent Paris Club debt 
reduction agreement to determine if, in its discussions with 
Iraqi officials, Romania could also grant Iraq relief from 
its Ceaucescu-era debt.  In approaches to Catalin Ionita, 
Deputy Director General of UN and Global Affairs in Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and Paul Ichim, State Secretary in 
the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the answer was the same: The 
Romanian government is still examining its position and 
options, but does not believe it can afford to forgive or 
reduce the debt Iraq owes to it.  Mr. Ionita mentioned some 
of the preliminary ideas that Foreign Minister Geoana had 
advanced during his visit to Iraq this summer, including debt 
restructuring, oil deliveries or equity in joint ventures as 
alternatives to debt reduction or forgiveness. 
 
3. (SBU) Romanian officials point out, that for their 
country, the Iraqi debt is significant.  According to the 
Romanian MOF, as of December 31, 2003, Iraq is indebted to 
Romania in the amount of approximately $2.6 billion, 
including total principal of over $1.7 billion and total 
interest of approximately $1.1 billion.  This amount includes 
the following: 
 
- $1.19 billion, of which $927 million is principal, and $262 
million is interest calculated up to February 1, 1996. 
- $537 million of additional principal, which includes $98 
million under verification and registration, as well as $439 
of non- rescheduled debt. 
- $845 million, which consists of additional interest 
penalties from February 1, 1996 to December 31, 2003.  The 
MPF calculated these penalties according to the same 
contractual rates of interest established in 1990 in the 
deferred payment agreement made with the Iraqis. 
 
Note: These claims are based on goods and services delivered 
to Iraq before December 31, 1989, when Romania was still 
controlled by communist dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu.  The debt 
owed by Iraq to Romania has been rescheduled on three 
separate occasions, in 1987, 1988 and 1999.  In Baghdad on 
February 1, 1990, the GOR signed a &Financial Agreement 
between the Government of Romania and the Government of the 
Republic of Iraq8.  This agreement stipulated that the 
principal debt would be deferred for six years, of which 
three were defined as a grace period beginning on February 1, 
1990.  The total amount of debt covered by this agreement was 
$1,190 million.  Although the claims recovery began in 
February 1990, it was halted on August 30, 1990 in conformity 
with United Nations Security Council Resolutions.  Three 
years later Romania submitted a claim for the debt to the 
United Nationals Compensation Commission (UNCC), which was 
charged with handling claims related to Iraq,s invasion of 
Kuwait. However, this claim was withdrawn when the UNCC 
deemed the debts too old to be within its jurisdiction. 
 
4. (C) Mr. Ichim volunteered that MOF Minister Tanasescu had 
recently sent a letter to other non-Paris Club creditor 
nations to urge them to develop a common position on Iraq,s 
debt (see Ref B).  He claimed that no country had yet replied 
formally to the letter, although Romania,s embassies were 
reporting some discussions with host country governments on 
the subject.  Ichim also mentioned that Romanian Ambassador 
to the United States, Sorin Ducaru, had discussed the Iraq 
debt issue with a (not further identified) USG official, who 
reportedly stressed that Romania was &not being put under 
any pressure8 to adhere to the Paris Club arrangement. 
Econoff replied that we were not/not trying to pressure the 
Romanians, but merely encouraging them to be as flexible as 
possible when talking to the Iraqis. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Romanian officials stress that they want Iraq 
to succeed and point to Romanian efforts on the ground to 
stabilize the country.  As a poor country itself, however, 
Romania does not seem at all inclined to accept that an 
oil-producing country could not eventually repay a 
significant portion of its debt in some way.  Embassy will 
follow up with Romanian officials after they discuss the debt 
issue with Iraqi officials next week in Bucharest. End 
Comment.

This cable is sensitive but unclassified.  Handle 
accordingly 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (U) In anticipation of the November 28 general 
elections, Romania\'s Parliament rushed to pass the budget 
this year, bypassing substantive debate.  Both the 2005 
state budget and social assistance budget laws, passed by 
both legislative chambers on November 10, and ratified by 
President Iliescu on November 22, changed little from the 
draft budget laws reviewed by the IMF and submitted to the 
Parliament in October.  The budget anticipates a deficit of 
1.5 percent of projected GDP.  End Summary. 
 
Parliament passed the 2005 budget with record speed 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
2.  (SBU) In an unprecedented move, the Senate and Chamber 
of Deputies gathered in a joint session to debate the budget 
provisions expeditiously.  Several members of Parliament 
were absent for the budget vote due to election campaign 
obligations. A few also used their absence as a protest 
against the superficial nature of the budget debates and the 
scant attention given to opposition proposals.  The ruling 
Social Democratic (PSD) party expressed its satisfaction 
with the efficiency of the debates that lasted only two 
weeks, rather than the typical one to two months.  The 
president ratified the legislative package on November 22, 
six days before the elections. 
 
3. (SBU) Although the Parliament followed all constitutional 
steps in its debate and passage of the budget, many analysts 
felt that the process was on the edge of the law.  Due to 
the incumbent party\'s desire to have the budget passed prior 
to elections, the debate and drafting was superficial and 
rushed. 
 
Everyone gains in 2005 
----------------------- 
4.  (SBU) The budget shows overall increases in every area, 
although certain ministries benefit to a greater extent than 
others.  The Ministry of Education and research gains 
approximately 29 percent in the new budget, giving it the 
largest overall increase.  The Ministry of Administration 
and Interior was granted the second largest gain, with 28 
percent, followed by the National Defense Ministry, with 21 
percent more funds next year.  With military spending pegged 
to a strict 2.38 percent of GDP until 2008, this gain is 
primarily a result of projected GDP expansion.  Although 
everyone wins to a certain extent in this optimistic budget, 
lower gains are slated for the Ministry of Justice, with 
only a 1.4 percent increase and the Ministry of Labor, 
Social Security and Family, with a 5.3 percent increase. 
 
Note:  Dollar amounts and percentages have been calculated 
using the average forex rate for 2004 compared with the 
current exchange rate.  The Ministry of Finance\'s projected 
2005 average exchange rate of ROL 35,150 for one USD now 
seems implausible due to current market conditions.  The ROL 
has been on a solid appreciation trend since the central 
bank switched to a managed float policy at the end of 
October.  Today the ROL trades at 28,780 to one USD, a 
difference of 22.1 percent with the Ministry of Finance\'s 
prediction for 2005. 
 
Revenue Projections Overly Optimistic 
------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) The Parliament based the 2005 state budget on the 
following leading indicators, which the IMF reviewed and 
sanctioned: 
- Consolidated budget deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, a 
decrease from 2004\'s 1.65 percent deficit target; 
- Inflation rate of seven percent, in comparison with 2004\'s 
nine percent; 
- Economic growth of 5.3 percent, much lower than the 8.1 
percent annualized growth announced for the first nine 
months of 2004; and 
-Current account deficit not exceeding 5.4 percent of 
targeted GDP. 
 
6. (U) Embassy notes that many analysts consider the 2004 
growth rate to be at least somewhat exaggerated and 
unsustainable, as high agricultural gains due to favorable 
weather can be regarded as atypical for the climate patterns 
of recent years.  The GOR is probably counting on revenue 
growth that will not materialize.  The GOR may, therefore, 
need to increase import duties or issue additional 
Eurobonds, as well as raise taxes, to make up revenue 
shortfalls. 
 
7. (U) As the basis for its tight budget policy, the ruling 
PSD party is counting on a projected 5.3 percent economic 
growth, a 10.3 percent increase in investments, lower tax 
evasion and higher excise taxes.  Year 2005 revenues are 
projected at $28.3 billion (31.2 percent of the GDP), while 
expenditures are programmed as US$ 29.7 billion (32.7 
percent of the GDP).  These figures are based on a 2005 GDP 
projected to reach US$ 90.8 billion.  The state budget will 
distribute funds amounting to 6.6 percent of GDP to counties 
and municipalities.  This is an increase of approximately 
12.4 percent over 2004. 
 
Intra-Ministerial Budget Gymnastics 
----------------------------------- 
8.  (SBU) Although the budget law itself is indistinct and 
thus does not specify individual projects or programs for 
which money will be used, it includes an annex describing 
specific projects.  This annex presents a more detailed 
level of information, often listing the budget indicators 
used to arrive at allocation decisions.  The budget law 
strictly disallows transfers of money between departments or 
projects; when needs arise for intra-ministerial money 
shifting, a bizarre mechanism is used for reallocation. 
Departments in need of cash declare an official emergency, 
and then team up with other departments who officially 
declare a surplus.  Only after these official statements 
occur can money be shifted from one area to another.  In 
practice, intra-department shifts due to emergency 
declarations occur frequently.  However, inter-ministerial 
shifts are much more rare and are approved only under 
official ordinance, only three of which occurred so far this 
year. 
 
Future Budget Changes Likely Ahead 
----------------------------------- 
9.  (U) PSD MPs and Minister of Finance Mihai Tanasescu 
presented the 2005 budget as an instrument of social 
welfare.  Social spending will reach approximately 30 
percent of the total budget expenditures or 9.8 percent of 
GDP.  Minimum wage is set to increase 11 percent from 2004, 
reaching the net equivalent of $108 per month.  State sector 
wages will increase 12 percent in comparison with 2004.  The 
new law also stipulates that the GOR will adjust pensions 
for inflation on a monthly basis, and that high payroll 
taxes will decrease two percentage points from the current 
49.5 percent in an almost invisible attempt to discourage 
tax evasion. 
 
10. (U) Opposition MPs criticized the majority party\'s quick 
passage of the budget as a means to bolster its election 
campaign.  National Liberal (PNL) MPs declared that the 
economy\'s growth is a charade, propped up by debt and 
foreign remittances.  Democratic Party (PD) MPs stated that 
the 2005 budget laws passed by the PSD-dominated Parliament 
legalize the discretionary allocation of funds based on 
waste and populist measures.  The political opposition vowed 
to enact revised budget laws if successful in winning the 
legislative elections. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11.  (SBU) The budget reflects the GOR agreement to the 
tight 2005 deficit target proposed by the IMF.  However, the 
estimated 5.3 percent economic growth is an optimistic 
target. In 2004, the unusually high economic growth rate was 
due primarily to a surge in agricultural output, a volatile 
sector susceptible to unpredictable weather patterns.  The 
GOR\'s goal of decreasing inflation to seven percent will 
also be a challenge, given rising international energy 
prices and increasing wages.  The change in the Romanian 
leu\'s (ROL) denomination in the third quarter of 2005 may 
also have an effect as the new \"heavy\" ROL prices (dropping 
4 zeros from the currency) are rounded up. In any case, this 
is a temporary document, with a new parliament and executive 
expected to make substantial amendments once the pressure 
and attention of the election season have passed.

1.4 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Center-right National Liberal-Democratic 
(PNL-PD) alliance candidate Traian Basescu has won Romania\'s 
presidency, according to official results released early 
afternoon December 13.  PNL-PD leaders tell post that the 
alliance is still absorbing the surprise win, but will soon 
begin efforts to form a parliamentary coalition.  Cheering 
supporters crowded Bucharest\'s University Square late 
December 12 and early hours the next day to hear Basescu 
predict a clear victory; similar spontaneous rallies took 
place in other cities.  Throughout the campaign, Basescu 
advocated strong trans-Atlantic relations.  His alliance has 
promised to combat corruption and to undertake more rapid 
economic and political reform. Post has begun hearing names 
of potential cabinet members, but much remains in the sphere 
of speculation.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Defying predictions in the media and by political 
insiders from all political persuasions, center-right 
National Liberal-Democratic (PNL-PD) alliance candidate and 
Bucharest Mayor Traian Basescu has emerged as the winner of 
Romania\'s December 12 second-round presidential run-off 
elections.  With 99 percent of the vote counted, the Central 
Electoral Bureau (BEC) announced early afternoon December 13 
that Basescu held 51.23 percent of the vote compared to 48.77 
percent for ruling Social Democratic-Humanist party (PSD-PUR) 
union candidate Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.  PSD insiders 
tell post that the party leadership is coming to terms with 
what they see as a clear defeat.  Nastase conceded at 2:10 PM 
local time December 13, noting that the vote indicated a 
broad urban-rural split in Romania and leaving open the 
possibility of political cohabitation. 
 
3. (C) Meanwhile, the PNL-PD leadership is meeting in a 
closed session to discuss options for forming a possible 
parliamentary coalition.  Given that most in PNL-PD were 
surprised at Sunday\'s result, the alliance has not engaged in 
serious discussions with other parties -- unlike the PSD-PUR 
-- since November 28 parliamentary elections and first-round 
presidential elections.  Senior PD leader Cosmin Gusa 
confided to PolChief -- \"We are just waking up to all of 
this.\" 
 
Possibilities for a Coalition 
----------------------------- 
4. (C) Gusa also cautioned the morning of December 13 that it 
remained too early to determine how the PNL-PD will attempt 
to form a coalition.  Nonetheless, he conceded that there is 
much speculation both inside and outside the alliance.  The 
possibilities are numerous.  Analysts note the first option 
may be a minority coalition with the ethnic Hungarian party 
(UDMR), the 18 Chamber of Deputies members reserved for 
ethnic minorities, and support from individual MPs from other 
parties, including defectors from the extreme nationalist 
Greater Romania Party (PRM) (Note: Basescu has repeatedly 
publicly and privately ruled out a coalition with the PRM. 
However, analysts note that this would not negate the 
possibility of many PRM MPs declining to vote against a new 
PNL-PD led government.  End Note.) 
 
5. (C) A second option would be co-opting the Humanist Party 
(PUR), which holds 18 positions in the Chamber of Deputies 
and ten in the Senate.  With the UDMR and ethnic minority 
seats, this would provide a clear majority.  The PUR released 
a communique early afternoon December 13 expressing the 
party\'s political independence, indicating that this might be 
a path PNL-PD could pursue.  A third option would be to call 
elections as allowed by the constitution if the parliament 
meeting in joint session fails to form a government after 
three votes.  Basescu could decide that PNL-PD could build 
upon momentum generated by the December 12 results to achieve 
a commanding parliamentary majority by holding new elections. 
 A final option would be cohabitation, allowing the PSD the 
possibility to form a government.  This last option is viewed 
as the least likely, as it would deny Basescu the capacity to 
implement PNL-PD\'s platform. 
 
Possibilities for a Cabinet 
--------------------------- 
6. (SBU) Throughout the campaign, Basescu repeatedly stated 
that PNL-PD\'s prime minister would be PNL acting president 
Calin Popescu Tariceanu.  This reflects the longstanding deal 
between PNL and PD that one party would hold the presidency 
while the other would be accorded the prime minister 
position.  Tariceanu remained at Basescu\'s side during 
celebratory comments made late December 12 and was the only 
other PNL-PD leader to share the microphone with the press. 
Beyond Tariceanu, Embassy contacts say the composition of a 
possible PNL-PD cabinet remains unclear.  Party insiders and 
reliable media sources bruit several well-known political 
figures for the top positions. 
 
7. (SBU) Leading PD member Adriean Videanu is touted as a 
potential Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Economy. 
Videanu is one of PD\'s richest politicians and currently 
heads the Romanian-American Investment Fund.  He was one of 
the few parliamentarians to voluntarily leave office in 
accordance with new conflict of interest legislation.  His 
managerial skills and discretion are widely respected across 
PNL and PD ranks.  PD\'s Sorin Frunzaverde appears to be a 
frontrunner for Minister of Defense.  He briefly held the 
position in 2000 and is well known by the Embassy.  PNL\'s 
Valeriu Stoica is a possibility for Minister of Justice, and 
PNL\'s leading female deputy Mona Musca will likely be 
appointed either as Minister of Culture or Minister of Labor. 
 PNL economic advisor Ionut Popescu, a well-known journalist 
and economist is a wildcard.  However, given his position as 
the chief proponent of PNL\'s liberal economic strategy, he is 
likely to receive a key position in a future alliance 
government. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8. (C) Basescu\'s win is seen here as a new beginning in 
Romanian politics, with many hopes and expectations. 
Upcoming days will focus on coalition building to include 
frenzied horse-trading for leadership positions in the 
parliament and senior government slots.  We expect PSD will 
emerge as a tough opponent, with popular outgoing President 
Ion Iliescu taking over party leadership and with the PSD 
still highly influential -- through formal and informal bonds 
-- over state institutions, including the judiciary and 
intelligence services.  Events are evolving quickly in 
Bucharest.  The only certainty is that Basescu and his allies 
have pulled off an unexpected victory with likely sweeping 
repercussions on Romania\'s economic and political life

VISIT TO BUCHAREST, ROMANIA, SEPTEMBER 25-28, 2004 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1.  (U) Summary: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 
Commissioner Jeffrey Merrifield visit to Romania in late 
September provided the USG insight into the strong Romanian 
civil nuclear program.  End Summary. 
 
First Visit to Romania by NRC Commissioner 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  (U) On September 25-28th, 2004, Commissioner Jeffrey 
Merrifield visited Bucharest, Romania and the Cernavoda 
nuclear power plant.  His Chief of Staff, Margaret Doane, 
and Jodi Lieberman, Office of International Programs, USNRC 
accompanied him.  While in Bucharest, the Commissioner met 
with Dr. Lucien Biro, Chairman of the Romanian National 
Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (CNCAN) and, at 
the close of his visit, participated in a press conference 
with Dr. Biro and local media.  He also traveled to the 
Cernavoda nuclear power plant, located roughly 1 hours 
outside of Bucharest.  This was the first visit of an NRC 
Commissioner or delegation to Romania.  The purpose of the 
visit was to discuss the regulatory and operating experience 
of the CANDU-6 reactor design in light of NRC\'s activities 
in connection with a U.S. utility\'s interest in the Advanced 
CANDU Reactor (ACR) 700. 
 
CNCAN President Discussions Reveal Operational Readiness 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
3.  (U) Commissioner Merrifield began his visit with a 
meeting at CNCAN headquarters in Bucharest with Dr. Lucian 
Biro, CNCAN President.  In addition to Dr. Biro, the 
Commissioner met with Camelia Liutiev, European Integration 
and International Cooperation Section, Viviana Grama, 
Director, Special Material Section and Lucian Goicea, 
Director, Quality Control Division.  Timothy Phillips, 
Economic Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest, also 
attended the meeting. 
 
4.  (U) Dr. Biro explained that the CNCAN President is 
appointed by the Prime Minister and has the status of State 
Secretary.  He reports to the Prime Minister through the 
 
SIPDIS 
Chancellor of the Prime Minister.  He added that much of 
CNCAN\'s regulatory structure was established using NRC as a 
model. 
 
5.  (U) Dr. Biro presented a brief history of civilian 
nuclear activities in Romania, the development of CNCAN and 
the current status of work being done to complete Unit 2 at 
the Cernavoda NPP.  Although there was significant political 
pressure to build Soviet-designed VVER reactors at 
Cernavoda, the CANDU-6 reactor design was ultimately chosen 
for the site because of its strong seismic design qualities, 
use of a containment structure, and better quality assurance 
features. 
 
6.  (U) Construction of the five CANDU-6 units began in 1980 
at the Cernavoda facility, during the regime of Nicolae 
Ceausescu.  Construction was halted with the demise of the 
Ceausescu regime, but work resumed in the mid-1990s with a 
decision by the new government to complete Unit 1 with the 
assistance of CANDU reactor vendor Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited (AECL) and Italian firm Ansaldo S.A., which provided 
the \"balance of plant\" equipment. 
 
7.  (U) Unit 1 was commissioned in 1996, with Unit 2 
scheduled for completion in 2006/7.  Dr. Biro stated that 
Nuclearelectrica S.A. (SNN), the utility operating 
Cernavoda, had already implemented nearly 160 safety 
improvements at Unit 2, and had secured both a 235 million 
Euro loan, and a $400 million loan from the Canadian 
government for completion of Unit 2.  He added that SNN is 
working to secure outside investment to fund completion of 
Unit 3, noting that South Korea has expressed interest in 
providing funding for the project. 
 
8.  (U) Dr. Biro stated that, although CNCAN has 175 
authorized slots for employees, only 130 positions are 
currently filled.  While salaries at CNCAN are reasonably 
high, SNN is able to offer still higher salaries, making it 
difficult for Dr. Biro to attract employees.  Moreover, he 
noted that CNCAN staff attrition is a problem, with 
employees either retiring, or emigrating to Canada, the U.K. 
and South Africa.  CNCAN is a full-fee recovery agency, 
relying principally on licensee fees for its budget (as does 
NRC).  Dr. Biro explained that, as a political appointee, 
his salary is capped, preventing the salaries of his 
employees from rising as well.  However, there is some 
interest in changing his status.  Housed in a rather cramped 
section of a larger government building, CNCAN will soon 
move to its own, more elaborate building.  Dr. Biro stated 
that he had secured a 10 million euro bank loan to construct 
a new CNCAN facility in Bucharest, scheduled for completion 
by 2006/7. 
 
9.  (SBU) With regard to Romanian EU accession in 2007,Dr. 
Biro noted that CNCAN had implemented many of the EU Aquis 
chapter requirements and had taken steps to revise CNCAN 
regulations to be in line with those of the EU in areas such 
as physical protection, quality assurance and safeguards. 
As CNCAN also has licensing responsibility for radioactive 
sources, Dr. Biro explained that all sources above a certain 
activity level (i.e. \"High-risk radioactive sources\") are 
tagged so that their movement can be tracked through a GPS 
system. 
 
10.  (U) In response to a question posed by Commissioner 
Merrifield regarding cooperation with other CANDU 
regulators, Dr. Biro noted that the CANDU Senior Regulators\' 
Group was the main forum for exchange of information.  That 
group meets annually.  He advised that Romania also has 
agreements with neighboring countries, including Greece, 
Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Russia for notification in 
the event of a nuclear accident or incident.  CNCAN and 
Cernavoda conduct emergency exercises and will host CONVEX 
3, an international emergency exercise organized by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), next year.  Dr. 
Biro invited NRC to observe the exercise.  Although CNCAN 
currently has no emergency operations center, one will be 
included in the new building.  Cernavoda also lacks an 
offsite emergency operations center, although Dr. Biro 
stated that one will be built in the future.  Through one of 
the three cellular telephones he always carries, Dr. Biro 
has direct access to the Romanian government civil command - 
and the Prime Minister, if necessary - in the event of a 
nuclear incident or accident.  In closing, Dr. Biro 
expressed interest in touring the NRC Headquarters 
Operations Center at some point.  He visited the backup 
emergency operations center in NRC Region IV in 2001. 
 
Site Visit to Cernavoda 
----------------------- 
11.  (U) Commissioner Merrifield and the delegation 
proceeded to the Cernavoda site later the same day, where 
they were met by representatives from SNN, the 
Canadian/Italian consortium \"CNE-Invest\", and the Romanian 
management/construction partner \"CNE-PROD\".  The 
Commissioner explained that a U.S. utility, Dominion Power, 
has expressed an interest in the possibility of building an 
advanced CANDU reactor, an ACR-700, at one of its stations. 
The NRC is performing a pre-application review for ACR-700 
design. 
 
12.  (U) Vic Stobie, the Canadian safety and licensing 
manager for CNE-Invest, presented background information on 
the construction project to complete Unit 2.  Of the 1664 
slots allocated for the project, 1457 are allocated for 
Romanian companies.  At present, the project staff consists 
of 109 AECL, 68 Ansaldo and 1288 Romanian workers.  199 
positions remain to be filled.  Mr. Stobie discussed the 
process AECL, SNN, and Ansaldo went through to review the 
existing materials and equipment in Unit 2, abandoned in the 
1980s, followed by an assessment and refurbishment program 
started in 2002.  He noted that preservation of the existing 
unit hardware was very good and that the majority of items 
to be replaced before work started on Unit 2 were so-called 
\"perishable\" items, e.g. those that were composed of 
elastomers.  The Commissioner asked the extent to which the 
construction/management team was able to apply efficiencies 
in Unit 2 based on lessons learned in the completion of Unit 
1.  Mr. Stobie indicated that much of the construction staff 
that had worked on Unit 1 is now working at Unit 2.  Staff 
is also coming from the CANDU plant in Qinshan, China. 
Procedures had also been updated based on Unit 1 experience. 
 
13.  (U) During the presentation, Dan Bigou, the Unit 1 
station manager, briefly described the inspection and 
licensing process for Cernavoda.  There are currently two 
CNCAN inspectors at Unit 1 and two at Unit 2.  All CNCAN 
inspectors have unescorted access to the plant and its 
facilities.  Unit 1 has a two-year operating license; SNN 
must apply for a license renewal every two years.  The 
process will remain the same for Unit 2.  Regarding 
licensing of Unit 2, SNN will need to seek authorization 
from CNCAN for a number of stages in the commissioning 
efforts, including authorization to receive and store heavy 
water and nuclear fuel, and authorization to load heavy 
water and for manual fuel loading.  The utility will also 
need to seek CNCAN approval for achieving criticality and 
subsequent increases of power at 25% increments until 100% 
power is reached.  CNCAN is extremely involved in licensing 
activities at Cernavoda involving Unit 1 and completion of 
unit 2.  During the visit, Dr. Biro spent a lengthy amount 
of time reviewing SNN submissions to CNCAN for permission to 
restart Unit 1, then in a maintenance outage. 
 
Commissioner\'s Visit to Unit 2 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
14.  (U) Following discussions with SNN, AECL, and Ansaldo, 
the Commissioner toured the partially completed Unit 2.  The 
tour included visits to the spent fuel pond, the partially 
completed calandria and supporting structures, and the 
refueling machine.  Because the stainless steel calandria, 
which holds the fuel and moderator, was not yet sealed, the 
team was provided a rare inside view of the calandria vessel 
through one of the nozzle holes.  This is typically not 
possible because this hatch is an access hatch that is 
welded shut at a later period during construction 
 
15.  (U) The plant tour concluded with a visit to the 
Intermediate Nuclear Spent Fuel Storage facility (DICA), 
which is based on the AECL-designed \"MACSTOR\" system.  When 
completed, DICA will permit storage of 300,000 spent fuel 
bundles from operation of Units 1 and 2 over the next fifty 
years.  The average transfer rate is 5000 bundles per year. 
There will eventually be 27 storage modules, each of them 
having a capacity of 12,000 spent fuel bundles.  Only one 
module has thus far been completed. 
 
Unit 1 Tour 
-------------------- 
16.  (U) On the second day of discussions at Cernavoda, the 
Commissioner met with Vasil Simonov, Health and Safety 
Manager (CNE-PROD), Marian Serban, Director for Technical 
Issues and Nuclear Safety (CNE-PROD) and Unit 1 manager 
Bigou.  Following a brief overview of Unit 1 operating 
information and technical characteristics, the delegation 
toured Unit 1, which was just coming out of a maintenance 
outage.  During pre-tour discussions, the Commissioner 
inquired whether the plant management maintains a corrective 
action program.  Plant Manager Bigou noted that the 
corrective action program at Cernavoda is a performance- 
based system that includes use of root cause analysis for 
events.  On average, Mr. Bigou stated that they identify and 
review roughly seven hundred events per year and hold weekly 
meetings to review the events and follow-on corrective 
action.  The plant management also maintains an event 
database. 
 
17.  (U) The Commissioner asked whether the plant uses level 
1 PSA to manage the backlog of corrective actions.  Mr. 
Serban responded by noting that the plant management has 
been trying to move to a more risk-based system in order to 
prioritize corrective actions in response to events and has 
been discussing this with CNCAN.  He indicated that the IAEA 
had conducted an International Probabilistic Safety 
Assessment Review Team (IPSART) mission that validated 
CNCAN\'s PSA model and expects to complete an external PSA by 
December 2004. 
 
18.  (U) The Commissioner asked if the plant management is 
confident that the staff can effectively identify problems 
for the corrective action program, to which Mr. Serban 
replied that, while the process is working well, there is 
always room for improvement.  In 2002, when the plant moved 
to an event analysis process, there was a significant 
increase in the number of events identified.  However, he 
did note that investigation reports remain an area for 
improvement. 
 
19.  (U) Mr. Bigou added that Cernavoda uses several other 
CANDUs to benchmark performance, including sister units 
Gentilly and Point Lepreau in Canada, but would also like to 
develop a relationship with a U.S. plant.  He continued 
that, as Canada moves to more U.S. style practices, 
Cernavoda can benefit indirectly because of its association 
with the Canadian plants.  Commissioner Merrifield suggested 
that the U.S. experience with restart of Browns Ferry Unit 1 
in Alabama might be helpful in completion of Unit 2 and 
potential completion of the other Cernavoda units. 
 
Press Conference at CNCAN Headquarters 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
--------- 
20.  (U) Following the delegation\'s return to Bucharest, Dr. 
Biro arranged for a press conference with Commissioner 
Merrifield and local media at CNCAN headquarters. 
Politically adept, Dr. Biro was able to convene a 
significant number of radio, television and print press 
outlets.  The press conference was extensively covered in 
local media.  During the press conference, Dr. Biro 
presented the Commissioner with a statuette commemorating 
thirty years of U.S.-Romanian peaceful nuclear cooperation. 
Media questions were fairly benign, although one reporter 
requested the Commissioner\'s opinion of the recent Slovak 
Government decision to complete Units 3 and 4 at the 
Mochovce nuclear power plant, alluding that these reactors 
were to be of the same design as those at the now closed 
Chornobyl site in Ukraine. [Note: The reporter was 
incorrect.  Units 3 and 4, begun during the Soviet era, are 
likely to be similar to Units 1 and 2 at Mochovce, which are 
not \"Chornobyl-style\" RBMK reactors but are instead VVER- 
440/213 style units.  End note.] 
 
Comment 
------- 
21. (SBU) Commissioner Merrifield\'s visit proved to be very 
informative, adding to NRC\'s knowledge of the unique 
Romanian civilian nuclear power programs.  CNCAN President 
Biro is a resourceful leader dedicated to ensuring a strong 
nuclear safety culture.  Although Dr. Biro\'s hands-on 
approach is admirable and his work thorough, CNCAN lacks 
\"defense-in-depth.\"  Dr. Biro does not have a deputy, and it 
evident that he does not delegate very much of the key 
decision making to CNCAN management.  Should Dr. Biro be 
unable to perform his duties as President of CNCAN, it is 
questionable who on his staff would be prepared to step up 
and keep the work moving.  End Comment.

Classified By: POLITICAL SECTION CHIEF ROBERT GILCHRIST FOR REASONS 1.4 
 B AND D 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  Romania\'s President-elect, National Liberal 
Party-Democratic Party (PNL-PD) alliance co-leader Traian 
Basescu, is a skilled political campaigner and popular 
politician, renowned for his tenacity, but also for his 
approachability and straightforward style.  Basescu is a 
long-standing domestic political figure, serving as 
Transportation Minister in the 1990\'s and Bucharest Mayor 
from 2000 until his presidential victory over Social 
Democratic Party (PSD) candidate and Prime Minister Adrian 
Nastase.  Basescu characterizes himself as a strong ally of 
the U.S. and a vocal advocate for strengthening transatlantic 
relations.  He strongly supports Romania\'s EU integration and 
is known for his tough stance on corruption and drive for 
economic reform and modernization.  Sometimes criticized for 
poor managerial skills in Bucharest City Hall, Basescu now 
faces the challenge of building a governing coalition and 
constructing a successful governing team.  End Summary. 
 
The Happy Warrior 
----------------- 
2.  (C) Bucharest\'s Mayor and President-elect Traian Basescu, 
the surprise winner in the December 12 runoff presidential 
election, is little known outside of Romania, as his entire 
political career has focused on internal politics until now. 
Within Romania, however, he is renowned as a consummate 
political wrangler and a longstanding thorn in the side of 
the center-left Social Democratic Party (PSD), which governed 
Romania from 2000 until Basescu\'s upset victory over PSD 
Prime Minister Adrian Nastase.  A native of the seaport city 
of Constanta, the 53 year-old Basescu will now take on the 
role of Chief of State from outgoing President and PSD leader 
Ion Iliescu later this month.  His next task is formal 
designation of a Prime Minister and formation of a government 
but at the time of this writing, Social Democratic leadership 
is still arguing that they have the prerogative to form a 
PSD-centered government based on the majority status of their 
newly forged parliamentary alliances.  (Comment: We may have 
a Constitutional crisis brewing, but our reading of the 
Constitutional Article clearly gives a free hand to Basescu 
to attempt to form a government.  End comment) 
 
From Sailor to Alliance Leader 
------------------------------ 
3.  (C) Basescu was thrust into the national spotlight in 
October 2004 following the surprise withdrawal from the 
presidential race of PNL-PD candidate and Liberal Party 
president Teodor Stolojan for undisclosed health reasons. 
However, Basescu is no newcomer to Romanian politics and has 
been a major player on the Romanian political scene since the 
early 1990\'s.  Prior to the end of communist rule, Basescu 
was in the merchant marines, finishing as an oil tanker 
captain before moving on to become a high-ranking civil 
servant in Romania\'s Transport Ministry.  Basescu served as 
Transportation Minister from 1991-92 and 1996-2000.  He was 
elected to parliament as a Democratic Party (PD) deputy from 
1992 to 1996.  He followed his first election as Mayor of 
Bucharest in 2000 with another victory in June 2004, handily 
defeating PSD candidate FM Mircea Geoana and quickly becoming 
the PD\'s most popular politician.  Indeed, Basescu was 
arguably the \"star\" of the PNL-PD local election campaign; 
his easy win in Bucharest over the popular FM helped energize 
the PNL-PD Alliance for upcoming parliamentary and 
presidential elections. 
 
4.  (C) Basescu was elected PD president in 2001 after an 
intense and sometimes acrimonious struggle for control of the 
party, leading to the defection of some former PD stalwarts. 
In September 2003, the nominally center-left PD entered into 
a formal alliance with the center-right National Liberal 
Party (PNL), elevating Basescu to co-president of the 
alliance. As alliance co-president, Basescu worked closely 
with PNL President Teodor Stolojan to forge a unified 
campaign and strong opposition challenger to the ruling PSD 
and its well-developed party machine in local and national 
elections. 
 
Promoting the Transatlantic Alliance 
------------------------------------ 
5.  (C) Basescu publicly and privately advocates a strong 
strategic alliance with the United States.  During the final 
televised presidential debate on December 8, Basescu 
highlighted the importance of the 
\"Bucharest-Washington-London\" alliance.  At the same time, 
Basescu insists that EU accession is Romania\'s number one 
foreign policy objective - a view shared by political leaders 
across the spectrum.  During the presidential campaign, 
however, Basescu hammered his opponent for making concessions 
to EU negotiators without first laying the necessary 
groundwork domestically.  In the course of his December 13 
victory speech, Basescu stressed that political leaders must 
\"explain the costs\" of EU accession to the population. 
 
6.  (C) Basescu, a fluent English speaker, has long been a 
candid and reliable interlocutor with the Embassy.  Indeed, 
one of his two daughters attended an American university, and 
Basescu has complained that Romania\'s rigid academic 
hierarchy is hesitant to recognize a U.S. diploma in some 
instances. Basescu\'s generally pro-American stance, however, 
did not prevent him from criticizing during the campaign a 
sole source highway construction contract awarded by the PSD 
government to Bechtel Corporation.  (Note:  Basescu also 
slammed the PSD government for awarding contracts to European 
companies under less than transparent circumstances.  End 
Note.)  In the past, Basescu has voiced reservations about 
the 2003 U.S.-led military intervention in Iraq. 
Subsequently, he has privately and publicly expressed his 
solid support for continued Romanian troop contributions in 
Iraq and Afghanistan -- even advocating a potential increase, 
provided Romania has the capacity to do so. 
 
Rolling Up the Shirt Sleeves 
---------------------------- 
7.  (C) Even Basescu\'s fiercest opponents acknowledge that he 
is a brilliant debater.  He punctuates his blunt speaking 
style with wry humor and a candid admission of his own 
weaknesses.  Indeed, during the last presidential debate, he 
bemoaned the fact that Romania\'s two presidential contenders 
were both ex-communists.  One political observer who had been 
with Basescu on the hustings in rural Romania during the 
campaign described audiences breaking into tears as Basescu 
eloquently described the disastrous impact of corruption and 
inefficient bureaucracy on the lives of ordinary citizens. 
Earlier, after his city administration came under attack for 
lagging road repairs, Basescu occasionally doffed his sport 
coat and pitched in with one of the repaving crews working in 
the evening under artificial light.  It was great politics 
and endeared him to the citizens of Bucharest. 
 
8.  (C) Basescu is famed for his approachable style.  As one 
Romanian remarked to Poloff, he is not intimidating and 
\"anyone can talk to him.\"  His favored public attire is an 
open collar polo shirt.  When forced by official business to 
don a tie, his cravat is invariably slightly askew, with top 
button often undone.  During the June mayoral race, the 
shirt-sleeved Basescu mocked his opponent, FM Mircea Geoana, 
who campaigned at factories and subway stops in tailored, 
Italian suits.  Basescu\'s informal, straightforward manner 
starkly contrasted with PM Nastase\'s button down reserve 
during the presidential campaign.  Indeed, during the debate 
Basescu consistently referred to his opponent by his first 
name and by using the informal form for \"you.\"  Those who 
know Basescu insist that his public demeanor accurately 
reflects his personal style.  In a meeting with the 
Ambassador, his chief of staff remarked that he was a 
wonderful person to work for and that what you see is what 
you get.  In stark contrast to many of Romania\'s political 
elite, whose lavish lifestyle occasionally is featured on 
tabloid front pages, Basescu has a reputation for dwelling 
with his wife in a relatively modest home decorated with 
model ships he has assembled. 
 
Foot in Mouth Disease 
--------------------- 
9.  (C) Nonetheless, Basescu\'s informal demeanor and shoot 
from the hip style - which can blend irony and pathos in a 
few sentences - has occasionally been his Achilles heel. 
During the campaign he caught flack from the powerful 
Christian Orthodox hierarchy for his statement that one in 
five Romanians is homosexual and for his reported endorsement 
of gay marriage.  In classic Basescu style, however, he 
bluntly admitted that he had \"made an error.\"  During the 
presidential campaign, his opponents attempted to portray him 
as \"unpresidential\" - perhaps a competent mayor but, at 
heart, a former merchant marine lacking the \"gravitas\" to 
steer Romania through the shoals of EU accession. 
 
Sharing the Reins of Power? 
--------------------------- 
10.  (C) Some former colleagues of Basescu bitterly complain 
that his management style is non-consultative and frequently 
disregards the concerns of colleagues.  Indeed, one of the 
most pointed questions leveled at him during the debate 
inquired whether he was capable of working with a team. 
Basescu insisted that he is a \"team player,\" but politicians 
who have worked with him insist that he is a poor manager. 
Political insiders caution that Basescu will need finely 
honed diplomatic skills to build a cohesive and consistent 
PNL-PD led government. 
 
Attacking Corruption 
--------------------- 
11.  (C) During the presidential campaign, Basescu identified 
eliminating rampant corruption as a national security 
priority.  His tough talking stance on corruption resonated 
with many voters who, despite Romania\'s impressive 
macroeconomic growth, continue to live in straitened 
circumstance fifteen years after the end of communist rule. 
The Nastase campaign\'s promises to continue fighting 
corruption were small beer compared to Basescu\'s insistence 
that many PSD leaders were directly or indirectly benefiting 
from a culture of corruption and that state institutions, 
including the judiciary, must be insulated from political 
influence. 
 
12. (C) Basescu himself, however, remains dogged by a 
National Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\'s Office (PNA) 
investigation launched in the summer of 2004 into his alleged 
profiteering from the sale of Romanian merchant marine ships 
during his tenure as Transport Minister in the 1990\'s (Ref 
G).  He has vigorously denied these charges, claiming that 
they are politically motivated.  Similar charges in 1996 were 
dropped due to lack of evidence, following Basescu\'s 
agreement to give up his parliamentary immunity to be 
investigated.  This gesture clearly boosted his popularity, 
marking him in stark contrast to other MP\'s that allegedly 
hid their misdeeds under the cloak of parliamentary immunity. 
 Many Romanians saw the case simply as an attempt by the PSD 
to tar Basescu with corruption charges.  He did not appear to 
have financially benefited from the fleet sale and any 
misdoings on his part appear to have been procedural, if 
that.  Constitutional lawyers now say that, with his election 
to the presidency, the \"Fleet File\" charges against Basescu 
will be suspended, as a sitting Romanian president can only 
be prosecuted for crimes of \"high treason.\" 
 
Economic Reform 
--------------- 
13.  (C) Since the mid-1990\'s, Basescu has been a stalwart 
advocate for economic reform, including transparent 
privatization of state-run enterprises, fiscal reform, and 
economic modernization to attract foreign investment.  During 
the presidential contest, Basescu reached out to the domestic 
and international business community, holding forums with 
leading business groups and pledging to institute 
market-oriented reforms.  Liberal economic reform -- 
including major changes to the tax code -- remained a central 
component of PNL-PD\'s campaign platform.  Political analysts 
are now watching to see if he will succeed in putting 
together a government capable of implementing this program.

Ref: State 245841 
 
1.  Post\'s submission in \"Patterns format,\" updating last 
year\'s \"Patterns of Global Terrorism\" report (reftel) 
follows: 
Romania is a staunch ally of the United States in the global 
war against terrorism, providing full public and diplomatic 
support for US goals to counter terrorism.  In 2004, about 
1,200 Romanian troops served at any one time in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, and Romania has promised to maintain its 
commitment of troops through mid-2005.  Romania has made its 
airspace, ground infrastructure, and naval facilities 
available to US and NATO forces engaged in the global war 
against terrorism and senior government leaders have 
promised to continue to do so in the future. 
The Romanian Government has established internal mechanisms 
to combat terrorism, including adoption of a \"National Anti- 
Terrorism Strategy\" and guidelines to prevent the use of the 
Romanian financial and banking system for the purpose of 
financing terrorist acts.   As part of its national 
strategy, Romania adopted legislation in 2004 that 
delineates the responsibilities of Romanian government 
institutions in battling terrorism, providing a clearer 
framework for interagency coordination and cooperation. 
Bucharest is the site of the Southeast European Cooperation 
Initiative, a regional center that provides law enforcement 
training and intelligence sharing on transborder criminal 
activities, including terrorism, for 12 member countries in 
Southeastern and Central Europe. 
Romania has fully ratified all 12 UN counter terrorism 
conventions. 
Romania has adopted adequate legislation to address 
financial crimes and terrorist financing.  Nevertheless, its 
strategic location bordering Ukraine, Moldova and Serbia 
makes Romania vulnerable to money laundering and other 
financial crimes that potentially finance terrorist 
organizations.  Romania\'s weaknesses include the lack of 
timely reporting of suspicious transactions and other 
evidence of criminal activity by Romanian banks and 
insufficient resources (funds and personnel) directed by the 
Romanian government to prosecuting financial crimes. 
2. In the following addendum, post includes relevant 
developments during 2004, which demonstrate Romania\'s 
commitment to battling terrorism: 
- Romania adopted on November 25 Law 525, a \"Law for 
Preventing and Fighting Terrorism,\" as part of its National 
Anti-terrorism Strategy.  The law delineates the 
responsibilities of Romanian government institutions in 
battling terrorism, providing a clearer framework for 
interagency coordination and cooperation.  The legislation 
also aims to provide a unified juridical approach to 
terrorist activities, including establishment of clear 
definitions of terrorist activities. 
This law provides for a special procedure to authorize 
electronic interceptions for threats against national 
security, including terrorist acts.  Governmental 
institutions with competence in the field of national 
security must forward a written request for authorization to 
the General Prosecutor of Romania.  If the request is found 
to be justified, the General Prosecutor submits it to the 
President of the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The 
final decision is made in chambers by a group of specially 
designated judges, after a careful analysis.  The warrant 
cannot exceed 6 months, but it may be extended several times 
for 3 months in justified situations.  The extension must 
also be decided by special judges designated by the 
president of the High Court of Cassation and Justice. 
 
The law also provides that in exceptional circumstances 
(when a present and clear danger to the national security 
occurs) governmental institutions may begin to intercept 
communications without the proper warrant issued by the 
judiciary.  The request for authorization must be submitted 
within a maximum of 48 hours from the commencement of the 
interception. 
 
- The GOR approved a list of persons and companies suspected 
of engagement in terrorist financing, citing 90 persons and 
40 companies engaged in terrorist financing.  In November, 
the GOR asked parliament to enact a draft \"Law on Fighting 
Against Money Laundering and Terrorism.\"  This proposed 
legislation includes substantive and technical measures 
aimed at fighting terrorist financing by tightening anti- 
money laundering legislation. 
 
- In June of 2004, the GOR responded to criticism of its 
National Office for the Combating and Prevention of Money 
Laundering (Romania\'s Financial Investigation Unit or FIU) 
by replacing its management.  The new management has taken 
aggressive action to increase the efficiency and security of 
the office and to improve its relationship with law 
enforcement institutions, other FIUs, and the banking 
industry.  Reforms have included new procedures and time 
limits for analyzing and reporting suspicious transactions. 
 
- On November 23, 2004, legislation (Law 508) went into 
effect that reorganizes police and prosecutorial resources 
into a directorate under the authority of the prosecutor 
general for the investigation of organized crime and 
terrorism.  The directorate is authorized to create a 
database from which it can develop proactive investigations 
of offenses within its jurisdiction. 
 
- The GOR has ratified the 1997 UN \"Convention for the 
Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\".  Romania has now 
ratified all 12 UN anti-terror conventions. 
 
- The GOR has enacted legislation ratifying the Protocol 
amending the European Convention for Suppressing Terrorism, 
enacted in Strasbourg on May 15, 2003.  The Protocol 
concerns penal measures aimed at fighting terrorism, 
including definition of crimes, establishment of sentencing 
guidelines and definition of extradition rules. 
- The GOR modified the Penal Code to contain a new, distinct 
chapter titled \"Crimes and Terrorist Acts\" which 
specifically penalizes terrorist-related crimes, such as 
terror killing, threats, and financing of terrorist acts.

SUBJECT: The Lion in Winter: Romania\'s Foreign Exchange 
Policy Changes 
 
 
This cable is Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for Internet 
distribution. 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The National Bank of Romania (BNR), the 
country\'s central bank, has recently shifted from its long- 
standing policy of closely managing the Romanian Leu (ROL) 
foreign exchange (forex) rate to an infrequently managed 
free float.  The BNR now limits its interventions on the 
forex market and refrains from announcing when they will 
occur in advance. The Leu (Romanian for \"lion\") is gaining 
strength, causing anxiety for exporters and prompting more 
interest in tools to hedge currency risk. End Summary. 
 
Increasing Unpredictability in Foreign Exchange 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2. (U) The National Bank of Romania (BNR), on October 29, 
switched to an infrequently managed float of the ROL on the 
foreign exchange market.  Since then, the ROL has 
appreciated 6.3 percent against the Euro and 11.4 percent 
against the USD, causing a boom for importers and increasing 
concern among local exporters.  The BNR\'s decision to cease 
almost daily interventions in the currency market is based 
primarily on its increasing forex reserves that have grown 
more than $4.2 billion from the beginning of 2004, now 
exceeding $14 billion.  This amount is well within the IMF- 
recommended range of reserves equivalent to four to six 
months of imports.  These robust reserves, coupled with a 
surplus of currency in the forex market originating from 
foreign remittances, foreign direct investment, and interest 
income on the BNR\'s reserves increased the Bank\'s comfort 
level with a freer float. 
 
Handling Hot Money 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) The BNR has defended its choice of allowing the ROL 
to float wider and more often as discouraging inflows of 
speculative or \"hot\" money.  Although Romania officially has 
always discouraged speculative foreign investments, they 
were not seriously considered a threat until recently. 
Historically, this so-called \"hot\" money naturally avoided 
Romania due to high investment risk.  Today, in spite of 
incomplete liberalization of the capital account, 
speculative foreign investment is dramatically increasing 
due to growing signs of an improved investment environment 
climate, including: 
-Fitch, the international credit rating agency, recently 
upgraded Romania to investment grade; 
-Macro-economic indicators, including inflation, 
unemployment and the budget deficits continue to stabilize; 
-The IMF precautionary standby agreement allows Romania to 
borrow up to approximately US$367 million if needed and 
authorized; 
-European Union membership is expected in 2007; and 
-Foreign investors have enthusiastically invested in 
Romanian Eurobonds, which, according to the central bank, 
may reach Euro one billion by the end of the year. 
 
4. (U) Improved economic conditions set the stage for 
increased hot money in the Romanian economy.  BNR Governor 
Mugur Isarescu predicts that speculative investments will 
total approximately Euro one billion by the end of 2004. 
Speculative investors have been particularly eager to 
exploit the high interest rates offered on ROL accounts 
through local banks.  Investors can easily benefit from the 
11.6 percent annual interest rate on ROL accounts by working 
through middlemen, a positive spread of 7 to 8.5 percent 
above Euro-denominated accounts.  Speculators exchange hard 
currency for ROL, invest in interest-bearing ROL accounts 
controlled by local brokers, then withdraw the money with 
the intention of quickly exchanging it for hard currency and 
then exporting the profits.  While exchange rates were 
stable due to central bank intervention, this positive 
spread was assured.  Today, with increasing exchange rate 
volatility, long-term bank investments, particularly those 
exceeding six months, may become less attractive for 
speculators if the ROL reverses its climb.  Investments with 
short-term maturities become more desirable; investors gain 
both higher interest and benefit from the current ROL 
appreciation trend. 
 
5. (U) Foreigners resident in Romania will also soon be able 
to join the group of potential speculators.  Currently 
prohibited from opening ROL accounts on their own, 
foreigners will be able to open local currency accounts in 
2005. 
6. (U) The BNR decided to discourage speculative investment 
by opting for a freer ROL float, rather than choosing to 
place restrictions on local banks, such as mandatory 
investment terms, interest-free short term accounts or early 
withdrawal penalties.  Although decreasing the spread 
between high interest rates on ROL accounts and low rates on 
hard currency accounts would also mitigate speculative 
investments, large cuts are unfeasible at this time due to 
relatively high Romanian inflation rates.  Nevertheless, the 
BNR has begun a process of lowering interest rates, which 
now stands at 18.25 percent for commercial banks deposits, a 
7.15 percentage point spread compared to the 11.1 percent 
inflation rate.  However, recalcitrant local commercial 
banks have avoided following the BNR\'s lead to cut their own 
interest rates on loans, due to a dearth of competition and 
risk associated with the domestic lending market. 
 
Keeping Inflation at Bay 
------------------------ 
7. (U) In addition to a desire to discourage speculative 
investment, the timing for the BNR\'s decision may also be 
linked to a desire to apply downward pressure on the 2004 
inflation rate, targeted for nine percent.  At the nine- 
month mark, the inflation rate stood at 6.6 percent, and, 
anticipating the need to purchase fuel for heating for the 
impending winter, the GOR recognized that maintaining the 
nine percent goal in the face of significant fuel imports 
was unlikely.  A rapidly strengthening ROL has served to 
keep inflation under control by making imports cheaper. 
 
Exporters Concerned about Impact... 
----------------------------------- 
8. (U) Not everyone is happy about the new managed float. 
Foreign imports are becoming cheaper for the Romanian 
population and Romanian export goods are becoming more 
expensive on foreign markets, hurting local manufacturers. 
The National Association of Exporters and Importers (ANEIR) 
recently declared that Romanian exporters lost seven to ten 
percent of revenue within one month as a direct result of 
the switch. Bank analysts are taking a more conservative 
stance, preferring to wait for two to three months of data 
to analyze to what degree the new forex policy affects 
exporters.  ANEIR is calling for dramatic cuts in interest 
rates to slow ROL purchases from speculative investors, 
which are a major factor in the currency\'s appreciation. 
 
9. (U) In addition, Romanian businesses are becoming 
increasingly interested in currency hedging strategies, 
although this is mainly coming from more sophisticated, 
medium- and large-sized firms.  This growing interest is 
apparent on the Sibiu commodities exchange where ROL-Euro 
futures contracts have increased from ten in June, 2004 to 
almost 1300 during the month of November.  ROL-USD contracts 
have also increased from 19 to 194.  Exporters who deal 
mainly in Euros, importing Euro-denominated inputs, and 
selling finished products priced in Euros, are virtually 
immune from the switch, although salaries and local 
utilities continue to be paid in ROL, which will have a 
negative effect on profits. 
 
10. (U) Romania\'s Minister Delegate for Foreign Trade 
recently defended the BNR\'s policy to let the ROL 
appreciate, in spite of criticism from exporters.  He has 
called on Romanian exporters to better prepare export 
strategies and examine ways to become more competitive.  He 
has also has insisted that lower inflation resulting from 
the new policy will greatly benefit Romanian businesses in 
the long term.  The BNR agrees with this assessment and has 
described the earlier ROL depreciation against major 
currencies as an implicit subsidy for uncompetitive Romanian 
exporters that could not continue. 
 
...But Consumers are Happy 
--------------------------- 
11. (U) While exports decline, imports are surging as 
Romanians eagerly purchase cheaper products from abroad, 
including machinery, textiles, minerals and automobiles. 
Embassy\'s discussions with a major U.S. car manufacturer and 
importer located in Romania found increasing first-time 
customer interest in U.S. vehicles and increasing sales 
overall on European imports.  Low cost imports are also 
benefiting Romanian businesses by allowing them to purchase 
tools and raw materials for lower capital costs, which will 
spur growth.  However, as imports increase and exports fall, 
the trade deficit is widening.  ANEIR believes that given 
the current ROL appreciation Romania may attain a record- 
high trade deficit by the end of the year. 
 
What the Future Holds 
---------------------- 
12. (U) Capital account liberalization will advance in April 
2005, with the anticipated availability of ROL denominated 
bank accounts for foreigners.  This will allow foreigners to 
benefit from high interest without requiring the services of 
a middleman.  This move may unleash a renewed ROL buying 
frenzy as speculators move into these accounts.  Soon 
afterwards, The Romanian government will create a secondary 
monetary market in which domestic T-bills, certificates of 
deposit and mortgages will be traded and which will likely 
also be open to foreign residents.  This market may also 
boost confidence in the ROL, perhaps again raising its 
value. 
 
13. (U) The BNR hopes that an additional important 
psychological boost for the public perception of the Leu as 
a serious and stable currency will occur next year when it 
introduces the \"new\" Leu to replace the old currency unit. 
The BNR, between July 2005 and December 2006, will divide 
all current denominations by 10,000, effectively removing 
four zeros from the bills.  The official currency trading 
designation of the Leu will change from ROL to RON 
(\"Romanian New\").  The BNR hopes that this denomination 
process will assist disinflation through a psychological 
effect, similar to the results that followed Poland\'s 
currency redomination.  In the long term, as Romania 
approaches European Union membership and eventual adoption 
of the Euro, possibly in late 2014, the BNR believes 
volatility between the two currencies will diminish. 
However, where the rate will stand at that time is 
impossible to predict, all the more so as a new president 
with center-right leanings and somewhat undefined policy 
preferences has just unexpectedly been elected. 
 
Comment 
------- 
14. (SBU) Recent foreign exchange policy has shown that 
Romania has subordinated exchange rate price stability to 
inflation targeting, a move that is consistent with 
international standards and best practices.  However, this 
move makes business difficult for those Romanian exporters 
that may be unprepared for increased international 
competition as their goods and services become more 
expensive.  This situation is a good test for the more 
competitive environment that Romania will face in the future 
as it approaches EU accession.  In the short term the ROL 
will likely continue to appreciate, absent significant 
interference from the BNR.  In the longer term, if Romania\'s 
taste for cheap imports continues, and the trade deficit 
expands, demand for hard currency should slow and reverse 
current Leu appreication.

KEY OBJECTIVES IN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH 
 
REF:  BUCHAREST 3160 
 
THIS CABLE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT 
ACCORDINGLY 
 
1. (U) Summary.  In his first speech after acknowledging his 
win in presidential run-off elections, Romanian President- 
elect Traian Basescu emphasized EU integration, poverty, 
political influence on state institutions and corruption, 
all key Basescu themes in his presidential campaign.  He 
highlighted another campaign plank - the importance of a 
strong trans-Atlantic alliance.  Basescu also stressed that 
the PNL-PD should lead a parliamentary governing coalition. 
End Summary. 
 
A Jubilant New President-Elect 
------------------------------ 
2. (U) President-elect Traian Basescu accepted victory 
December 13 in a brief, nationally televised speech in which 
he acknowledged the concession of his competitor, center- 
left Social Democratic Party (PSD) PM Adrian Nastase. 
Flanked by  senior members of his center-right Liberal- 
Democratic (PNL-PD) alliance bloc -- including PNL leader 
and potential Prime Minister Calin Popescu Tariceanu -- 
Basescu  outlined the priorities for his administration, 
stressing themes he had raised repeatedly throughout  the 
campaign. 
 
Seeking a PNL-PD led Majority 
----------------------------- 
3.  (U) Basescu said his first priority would be to form a 
parliamentary majority that would allow him to  implement 
with \"total force\" Romania\'s plans for integration into the 
European Union.  \"We are aware that after closing 
negotiations, there are still extremely difficult 
obligations,\" ahead for Romania, Basescu declared.  He 
stressed that Romania\'s EU accession obligations could only 
be implemented by a government led by the PNL-PD bloc.  He 
stressed that the alliance had obtained 161 seats in both 
parliamentary chambers, while PSD without its Humanist Party 
(PUR) ally, had obtained only 160.  Basescu said he intended 
to attract to the PNL-PD led coalition the parliament\'s 
\"democratic parties,\" namely PUR and the ethnic Hungarian 
party (UDMR).   Basescu said he will work to \"unite the 
Romanian nation,\" including Romanians  living abroad. 
 
The Costs of EU Integration: Informing the People 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
4.  (U)  Turning again to EU accession, Basescu said that 
Romania\'s primary foreign policy goal is joining the EU  in 
2007.  He said the process would surely fail if  Romania\'s 
leaders do not fully explain to the Romanian people the 
costs and implications of integration.  As long as the 
general public  sees \"Europe\" as a matter of concern only 
for the government, fewer and fewer Romanians would support 
integration once the costs become clear.  He underscored the 
need for an integration process with a \"unified people who 
accept the costs of  integration in exchange for the 
satisfaction that follows integration.\" 
 
Combating Poverty 
------------------ 
5. (U) Basescu said that Romania should not be allowed to 
\"hide poverty behind statistics.\" He said too many 
pensioners receive  allotments that are lower than their 
monthly bills for winter heating, or electricity, or gas; 
too many farmers become poorer and poorer even in years with 
good harvests; too many of Romanian youth have begun to 
believe that Romania is not a country where they have 
opportunities.  He said addressing these problems would be 
his priority as president.  He acknowledged that combating 
poverty would have to take into account the realities of the 
state budget, but stressed that the country would not 
achieve cohesion as long as the state \"humiliates millions 
of citizens\" through poverty. 
 
Securing the Independence of State Institutions 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
6. (U) Basescu announced that he viewed as a \"special 
priority\" the need to remove state institutions from 
political influence.  State institutions should function 
according to the constitution and laws, not through the 
\"involvement of politicians in justice, police, the 
prosecutors office\" or other places where \"serious issues 
concerning the legal process are dealt with.\"  Basescu vowed 
to be a president who would \"watch over and protect\" state 
institutions from any kind of political influence.  He 
cautioned that the replacement of the PSD would not simply 
mean the arrival of \"new political masters\" but that he 
would ask all of the leaders of Romania\'s institutions to 
fulfill their duties according to the law. 
 
Corruption:  \"A threat to National Security\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
7. (U) Echoing a theme he iterated during the presidential 
campaign, Basescu characterized high-level corruption as a 
\"threat to national security.\"  He promised to include the 
fight against corruption in Romania\'s National Defense 
Strategy. Basescu stressed that key governmental 
institutions, including the Justice and Interior Ministries 
and national intelligence agencies, would be charged with 
battling corruption. 
 
The Transatlantic Relationship: Bucharest-London-Washington 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
8. (U) Basescu declared that strengthening Romania\'s 
security relationship with the United States and United 
Kingdom is the foundation of Romania\'s national security 
strategy.  Hearkening to a theme that he first elaborated 
during a nationally televised presidential debate five days 
before the December 12 election, Basescu praised the 
\"Bucharest-London-Washington\" alliance.   Basescu described 
Romanian as a bridge between the western values, as 
represented by the EU and NATO, and former communist Eastern 
European states.   According to Basescu, Romania should 
maintain friendly relationships with Russian, Ukraine and 
Belarus in order to help provide a \"stabilizing force\" on 
NATO\'s frontiers.  Basescu also observed that Romania and 
Moldova (which share a common language, culture and history) 
constitute one nation living in two countries and that the 
\"Romania has the obligation to treat Moldovans as good 
Romanians.\" 
 
Praise from Independent Analysts 
--------------------------------- 
9.  (U) Journalist Bogdan Ficeac lauded Basescu for his 
insistence that state institutions should strive to be 
apolitical, observing that  \"I haven\'t heard any other 
politician speaking so firmly about this matter.\"\" 
Respected NGO Pro Democracy\'s leader Cristian Pirvelescu 
said that depoliticizing state institutions depends on the 
\"reconstruction of the lawful state,\" which was not 
respected during the PSD rule, when \"state institutions were 
captive.\"  He also stated that \"political equilibrium leads 
to economic equilibrium.\"  On the other hand, editorialist 
Bogdan Chirieac opined that Basescu\'s talk of a \"Washington- 
London-Bucharest\" had stirred uncertainty, confusion and 
perhaps even annoyance not only in the U.S. and UK, but also 
in France and Germany.  (Comment: EU Ambassadors here in 
Bucharest have been asking the Ambassador and U.K. 
Ambassador Quinton Quayle for an explanation for Basescu\'s 
remarks.  End Comment) 
 
Comment 
------- 
10. (SBU) Basescu\'s speech contained no surprises and 
tracked with themes he had stressed during the campaign. 
The speech\'s delivery reflected Basescu\'s typically up 
front, direct speaking style and represented an attempt to 
build on the momentum generated by his surprise victory 
December 12.  Basescu spoke with a victor\'s confidence: his 
insistence on a PNL-PD-led parliamentary government clearly 
rejects the possibility of a governing parliamentary 
coalition including the PSD.

the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) is pressing hard to

Party (PUR) and the ethnic Hungarian party (UDMR).  The deal, 
which had been worked out among the three parties in the two 
weeks between the two rounds of presidential elections, 
assumed a Nastase win.  Moreover, Nastase used the fact that 
he had secured an apparent parliamentary governing coalition 
as a point to boost his standing during the campaign, the 
logic being that a PSD-led parliament would work best with a 
PSD president. 
 
3. (C) Prior to Basescu\'s win, PUR and UDMR contacts told 
post their parties were \"extremely pleased\" with the terms 
they had received in negotiations with the PSD.  While full 
details were not disclosed, the PSD had reportedly promised 
the ethnic Hungarians a vice premier slot and at least three 
ministerial portfolios, including Health, Transport, and 
Education.  PSD had similarly promised the PUR key positions, 
including a second vice premier slot, a key economic ministry 
and a newly created Ministry of Small and Medium sized 
Enterprises.  The negotiated deal was much better than these 
two parties had received during their earlier alliance with 
the PSD. In addition, as political insiders have noted to 
post, UDMR and PUR \"feel comfortable\" working with PSD, as 
they have a long history of collaboration. 
 
4. (C) However, the foundations of the PSD-constructed house 
of cards were severely shaken by the seismic impact of a 
clear Basescu victory.  December 13-15, as Basescu\'s win sunk 
in, both PUR and UDMR issued a series of conflicting 
statements about their future intentions.  Contacts within 
the parties confided that this reflected intense pressure 
applied from both PSD and PNL-PD and the new 
rules-of-the-game set by Basescu.  In contrast, one PNL-PD 
contact told post that he remained alarmed by the high price 
each of the two small parties sought to exact as its 
admission fee into a PNL-PD-led government.  Late December 
14, UDMR leader Marko Bela met with Basescu and likely PNL-PD 
prime ministerial designee Calin Popescu Tariceanu.  The 
following day, UDMR declined to sign a planned formal 
protocol setting in stone an alliance with PSD and PUR.  UDMR 
issued a statement that discussions would continue with both 
sides and that any protocol should be postponed. One PSD 
insider confided to post that despite intense ongoing 
negotiations December 15 between PSD and UDMR, ultimately an 
alliance between the two was \"unlikely to gel.\"  Although PUR 
leader Dan Voiculescu has said his party would prefer an 
alliance with PSD, he also expressed a willingness to remain 
open to an agreement with PNL-PD as circumstances require. 
 
5. (C) Meanwhile, President-elect Traian Basescu remains 
firmly committed to a PNL-PD-led government, as he declared 
publicly during his December 13 presidential acceptance 
speech.  Given that the central plank in Basescu\'s campaign 
was combating what he called PSD-perpetrated corruption, few 
political analysts see any way he could allow PSD to remain 
in government.  To a great extent, the vote for Basescu was 
against PSD.  Despite some internal dissent, PNL-PD leaders 
meeting the week before December 12 elections formally set a 
policy that the alliance would exclude PSD from any 
PNL-PD-led coalition.  Any backtracking by the alliance would 
be perceived in the media and by the public as indication of 
insincerity by Basescu and the PNL-PD in their commitment to 
fight corruption and usher in reform.  Tariceanu reminded the 
press December 14 that PNL-PD had firmly ruled out any 
alliance or cohabitation with PSD.  Moreover, he asserted PSD 
efforts now to forge a parliamentary majority are only in 
play to allow PM Nastase\'s political survival. 
6. (C) At the same time, as president, Basescu will wield 
powerful constitutional prerogatives that give him an upper 
hand in shutting out PSD by designating a prime minister of 
his choice, likely to be Tariceanu.  Given that PSD on its 
own does not hold an absolute majority, post\'s view of the 
constitution indicates that Basescu is merely obliged to 
consult all the political parties represented in parliament. 
If Basescu\'s choice for PM does not succeed in forming a 
majority, he still has the option of forcing a minority 
government.  This is provided that such a government could 
survive a vote of no confidence.  Given that the parties and 
most MPs are reluctant to engage in another electoral 
campaign so soon, this is unlikely.  However, if a vote of no 
confidence were to pass, Basescu could call new elections as 
soon as 60 days after the first failed attempt to form a 
government. 
 
7.  (C) In a private conversation with the Ambassador on 
December 15, Basescu was clearly ebullient.  He presented a 
governing approach aimed at completing the 1989 revolution 
initiated, but subsequently hijacked, in his view, by second 
and third tier apparatchiks from the old regime. Like every 
other political adept in this town, Basescu had done the math 
and concluded that he can nominate a majority government, 
without cohabitation with the PSD.  Put quite simply, adding 
the UDMR, the PUR and 18 special seats reserved for ethnic 
minorities to seats won by the PNL-PD produces a 
parliamentary majority. 
 
8. (C) Naturally, the PSD has come to the same conclusion and 
has already made a serious effort at sabotage.  Basescu told 
the Ambassador that the PSD already showed him files throwing 
dirt on PUR leader Voiculescu, implying that such information 
could be brought to light to damage a future coalition.  The 
Ambassador observed that full transparency would be the best 
way of coping with this blackmail threat, but Basescu was 
quite confident he could build his government owing to his 
trump card ) the threat of new elections in which he 
believed he could handily prevail and win a clean majority of 
parliamentary seats.  In his words, &At the end of the day, 
if I explain to the population the situation, I will become 
more popular.8 
 
9.    (C) Basescu reiterated some of the same themes that he 
accented during his acceptance speech and campaign style 
appearance the previous night at Victory Square in front of 
the Palace of Parliament.  Basescu highlighted, however, the 
necessity of a fight against corruption, at both the top 
level of the political class and in the institutions of 
government that had come to serve the ruling party and 
favored individuals rather than the people.  Therefore, he 
concluded, he could not have cohabitation with those same 
individuals and political forces.  He offered that a few 
years in opposition would be good for both the PSD and 
Nastase, providing them the opportunity to rethink their 
politics and clean house.  He immediately added, however, 
that the PSD might be &irredeemable.8 
 
10. (C) Comment:  While PSD emerged with the largest 
parliamentary bloc in November 28 elections, Basescu\'s 
December 12 victory has delivered a tremendous blow to the 
bloc that has governed for 11 of the past 15 years.  Few 
Bucharest analysts believe Nastase can succeed in keeping his 
pre-set coalition intact, although tough bargaining positions 
by the PUR or UDMR with PNL-PD could change the outcome.  One 
Embassy contact has told us that the PSD is already 
undertaking internal changes, and that Iliescu is preparing 
to lead his party in opposition.  End comment.

SUBJECT: ROMANIA: BIOGRAPHICAL DATA ON KEY FIGURES IN THE 
NATIONAL LIBERAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY ALLIANCE 
 
Classified By: Political Section Chief Robert S. Gilchrist for Reasons 
1.4 B and D 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  In the wake of President-elect Traian 
Basescu,s upset victory over PM Adrian Nastase December 12, 
key members of the center-right National Liberal 
Party-Democratic Party (PNL-PD) Alliance, which Basescu 
heads, have moved to the center of Romania,s political 
stage.  While it is too early to determine precisely what 
roles these key players will assume in a Basescu presidency, 
post presents below brief bios of essential political figures 
within the Alliance, as well as two prominent independents 
with foreign policy credentials.  End Summary. 
 
Who,s Who in the Liberal Party 
------------------------------ 
2.  (C) The Alliance,s likely PM designate is respected 
businessman Calin Popescu Tariceanu, a PNL stalwart and 
leading party figure since the early 1990,s.  Within the 
party, Tariceanu is widely viewed as a conciliatory force, 
managing to avoid being too closely identified with any of 
the party,s factions.  Tariceanu has been acting PNL 
President -- and co-leader of the PNL-PD Alliance -- since 
Theodore Stolojan,s unexpected resignation from the 
presidential campaign and PNL leadership October 2. 
Tariceanu was Minister of Commerce and Industry from 1996 to 
1997.  His political adversaries cried foul during his 
ministerial tenure when one of his companies struck a deal 
with the national telecommunications company, RomTeleCom. 
His polished, urbane style coupled with a certain gravitas 
made him a logical pick for PNL-PD Alliance spokesman in 
2003.  Although he lacked the national name recognition of 
the center-left Social Democratic Party (PSD) PM designee FM 
Mircea Geoana, Tariceanu,s calm and collected style 
distinguishes him in a political atmosphere often 
characterized by hyperbole and florid rhetoric.  He is a good 
foil for rough-hewn President-elect Basescu.  One criticism 
occasionally aimed at Tariceanu by PNL insiders is that his 
relatively laid back style is perhaps a smidgen too relaxed 
for the hurly-burly of partisan politics; during the 
campaign, for example, Tariceanu reportedly insisted on 
regular rest days.  Tariceanu also is proud of his success as 
a \"self made man,\" having amassed a personal fortune through 
holding an exclusive franchise for Citroen sales in Romania. 
A respected and accessible interlocutor, Tariceanu met 
regularly with PolChief and other Embassy Officers before and 
throughout the campaign.  He speaks excellent English, is 
married and has two children. 
 
3.  (C) Theodor Stolojan remains a key player within the PNL 
despite his official resignation from the presidential 
campaign and party politics this fall for undisclosed health 
reasons.  On December 16, media reports indicated that 
Basescu had selected Stolojan to be Economic Counselor to the 
President.  Respected even by his political foes, including 
President Iliescu, he, like Tariceanu, is known for his 
bridge building ability in a party (and a nation) often 
notorious for its fractious infighting.  Indeed, Stolojan 
played a central role in reorganizing the PNL following the 
center-right,s electoral debacle in the 2000 general 
elections.  Many within the party felt, however, that the 
urbane, soft-spoken Stolojan lacked sufficient street 
fighting skills to tangle with the powerful PSD machine 
during the 2004 presidential contest. Some Alliance members 
secretly greeted his withdrawal from the campaign in favor of 
 
SIPDIS 
the tough talking Basescu with sighs of relief.  At the very 
least, Stolojan will be a trusted adviser to the new 
President. His role may be limited by bona fide health 
problems; some sources cite longstanding kidney ailments as 
the source of his woes.  Prior to his withdrawal from the 
campaign, many observers remarked on his waxen complexion, 
dark circles under his eyes and generally haggard demeanor. 
The Embassy maintains a close relationship with Stolojan and 
he met regularly with the Ambassador prior to his decision to 
pull out of the presidential race.  We expect those good 
relations will continue.  Stolojan was prime minister from 
1991-1992.  He also served as Finance Minister from 
1990-1991.  From 1992-1998 he worked as a Senior Economist at 
the World Bank.  In 2000, he was the PNL candidate in the 
first round of presidential elections. 
 
4.  (C) Energy mogul Dinu Patriciu, CEO and Chairman of the 
Board of Rompetrol, is one of the PNL,s most controversial 
figures.  A vocal critic of Stolojan,s leadership and the 
PNL,s alliance with PD, Patriciu nevertheless provided 
essential financial support to the Alliance during the 
campaign.  In September 2004, Patriciu and fellow PNL member 
Valeriu Stoica publicly aired the PNL,s dirty linen when 
they demanded more effective party leadership.  Although 
their complaints had little resonance among PNL,s rank and 
file, many observers touted their move as an example of the 
center-right,s historic lack of unity.  The National 
Anti-Corruption Prosecutor,s Office opened an investigation 
against him in summer 2004, but it remains unclear whether 
this was simply politically motivated.  Following the PSD,s 
successful showing in the first round of presidential and 
parliamentary elections, Patriciu and his confidantes were 
frequently cited as possible allies in a PSD-led government. 
Patriciu did nothing to dampen this speculation. 
 
5. (C) Former PNL President and Justice Minister Valeriu 
Stoica is widely credited as a mastermind behind the 
formation of the PNL-PD Alliance.  However, Stoica was forced 
to resign from PNL,s leadership in 2002 following his 
failure to boost the party,s public opinion ratings.  In the 
wake of the center-right,s 2000 electoral debacle, he 
skirmished constantly with Patriciu over PNL leadership, 
eventually bruiting Stolojan as a compromise candidate.  This 
summer, he again courted controversy by proposing a &swift 
merger8 between PNL and PD ) a step farther than most party 
members are willing to take.  His critics acknowledge his 
brilliant intellect, but observe that he lacks charisma. 
Although Stoica holds no formal position within the party, he 
continues to wield significant political clout and could 
return as Minister of Justice in a future alliance 
government.  The Embassy knows Stoica well, and PolChief and 
others have met with him regularly. 
 
6. (C) Mona Musca is PNL,s best-known female deputy and, 
together with Basescu and Stolojan, among the Alliance,s 
most popular figures.  A leading critic of corruption and 
widely respected for her own probity, she has proposed 
several bills protecting media freedom and favoring civil 
society.  Her commitment to clean government has earned her 
the nickname of the &First Lady8 of the PNL.  She 
petitioned the PNA to investigate an allegedly corrupt real 
estate transaction involving PM Nastase.  Musca, a valued 
Embassy interlocutor, has been bruited as a possible Culture 
Minister or Labor Minister in an Alliance-led government. 
 
7.  (C) Ionut Popescu took over the position of PNL-PD 
Alliance spokesman following Tariceanu\'s step up from 
Alliance spokesman to Alliance PM pick.  The former 
editor-in-chief of &Capital8 magazine and a well-known 
economic analyst and commentator, Popescu entered politics 
after PNL leader Theodor Stolojan asked him to become his 
personal adviser for economic issues.  Not surprisingly, 
Popescu is a strong advocate of a market economy and economic 
reform.  He was second on the Alliance Senate slate for 
Bucharest. 
 
8.  (C) Senator and ethnic Armenian Varujan Vosganian first 
entered parliament in 1990 as a representative of the 
Armenian minority.  In 1996, he was a cofounder of the 
Romanian Alternative Party (PAR), joining the PNL after the 
PAR-PNL merger in 2003.  He has served on the PNL Executive 
Bureau since the merger.  Vosganian is one of the authors -if 
not the principal author - of the Alliance\'s economic 
program.  He is a mathematician and economist by training. 
 
9.  (C) Soft spoken PNL Senator Gheorge Flutur, one of the 
party\'s leading electoral strategists and an agricultural 
specialist tops the list of likely choices for Agriculture 
Minister.  Flutur is a &Vice Leader8 of the PNL 
Parliamentary Group.   According to press reports, Flutur 
(along with Mona Musca) is one of the Alliance\'s top 
negotiators with UDMR and PUR, as PNL-PD aims to entice those 
parties to join a PNL-PD-led government. 
 
10.  (C) Controversial businessman Viorel Catarama has been 
linked to a series of business scandals, including 
investigations of the &SAFI8 investment fund and a 
furniture factory.  Catarama entered politics in 1990 and 
joined the PNL Youth Wing, that also included Dinu Patriciu 
and Calin Popescu Tariceanu.  He was a Deputy State Secretary 
in the Commerce Ministry in the early 1990,s.  Elected as a 
PNL Senator in 1996, he quit the party in 1999 and ran as an 
independent for Bucharest,s mayor, losing to Basescu. 
Catarama later became Chairman of the Romanian National Party 
(a party subsequently chaired by former Romanian Intelligence 
Agency (SRI) Director Virgil Magureanu) before leaving that 
party and joining the Alliance for Romania (APR) party in 
2000.  He returned in the PNL fold following the PNL-APR 
merger in  January 2002. 
 
11. (C) PNL Senator and Vice President Teodor Melescanu was a 
diplomat from 1966 to 1996, capping his foreign policy career 
as Foreign Minister from 1992 to 1996.  He entered politics 
as an ally of Ion Iliescu, but broke with Iliescu to form the 
Alliance for Romania (APR) party in 1997.  Following his 
unsuccessful bid for president in 2000 and the PNL-APR 
merger, Melescanu became a PNL Vice President. 
 
Three Young PNL Voices 
----------------------- 
12.  (C)  Three up and coming PNL Members - and valued 
Embassy interlocutors - are new Senator Christian David, 
Deputy Christian Boureanu and Deputy Bogdan Olteanu.  David 
is Director of the PNL,s Department of External Relations 
and was a close advisor to Tariceanu prior to and during the 
campaign.  He remains near the inner-circle of PNL-PD, 
including to Basescu, and is a close and reliable contact for 
the Embassy.  David is a businessman and an economist by 
training. 
 
13.  (C) Deputy Boureanu is a staunch advocate of market 
reform.  A regular Embassy interlocutor, he has complained 
about &old thinking8 among PNL leadership and also lamented 
that members of Romania,s intelligence services engage in 
partisan politics.  The telegenic and articulate Boureanu was 
a &regular8 on television talk shows during the electoral 
campaign.  He speaks fluent, idiomatic English.  He is a 
graduate of Romania\'s prestigious National Defense College. 
 
14.  (C) Deputy Bogdan Olteanu is very close to Alliance PM 
designate Tarticeanu, is chair of the PNL Honor and Mediation 
Council (an intraparty rules and ethics body) and has been 
bruited for a likely high position at a sub-ministerial level 
in a PNL-PD government.  Olteanu is one of two persons the 
PNL-PD has reportedly charged with drafting a \"protocol of 
cooperation\" if the Alliance can strike a deal with the 
ethnic Hungarian party (UDMR) and Humanist Party (PUR).  A 
lawyer by training and a PNL activist since the early 90\'s, 
he is former President of the PNL Youth Wing. 
 
Democratic Party Stars 
---------------------- 
15.  (C) Cluj Mayor Emil Boc is the best-known PD politician 
after President-elect Basescu.  He is number two in the PD 
hierarchy, after Basescu, holding the title of Executive 
President.  When Basescu is sworn in as President of Romania, 
Boc will take over as PD Acting President until the party 
convention in May 2005.  Boc is a canny politician, respected 
attorney and political science professor who helped establish 
the Political Science and Public Administration Department at 
Babes Bolyai University in Cluj.  Never one to skirt 
controversy, Boc is known for his outspokenness but leavens 
his idealism with pragmatism.  Boc\'s public performance can 
be uncontrollably garrulous, even erratic, leading one Cluj 
resident to remark that on occasion \"he speaks too fast, too 
long and too loud.\"  In the June 2004 municipal elections, 
Boc defeated both the incumbent mayor, a notoriously 
xenophobic member of Corneliu Vadim Tudor,s extreme 
nationalist Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the popular 
ex-PSD Interior Minister Ion Rus.  As a parliamentarian, Boc 
was a moving force behind drafting Romania,s revised 
Constitution in 2003 and anti-corruption legislation.  He 
enjoys good personal and professional relations with Basescu. 
 The President-elect is reportedly the godfather of one of 
Boc,s children, and Basescu recently stated that he would 
like more &Bocs8 in the Alliance.  Boc is a longstanding 
Embassy contact, appreciated for his candor and 
accessibility.  He speaks excellent English. 
 
16.  (C) A likely Alliance vice premier pick, Adrian Videanu 
is one of PD\'s richest politicians and currently heads the 
Romanian-American investment fund.  Videanu is one of the few 
parliamentarians to voluntarily leave office in accordance 
with new conflict of interest legislation.  His discretion 
and managerial skills are widely respected across PD-PNL 
ranks.  Videanu is widely regarded as president-elect\'s right 
hand man and returned to the public spotlight during the 
campaign among Basescu\'s inner circle of advisors. 
Additionally, Videanu is widely regarded as a source of cash 
) and economic credibility ) for the Alliance. 
 
17.  (C) Former Industry Minister Radu Berceanu has been 
tarred by corruption scandals, most notably allegations 
involving his involvement with petrochemical company Sunoil. 
The Prosecutor General,s office investigated Berceanu on 
allegations that during his tenure as Industry Minister he 
bled millions of dollars from state-owned petrochemical 
concerns while profits flowed into the coffers of Sunoil. 
Berceanu and three other PD officials denied the allegations 
and the results of the investigation were inconclusive. 
Berceanu is PD Vice Chairman and an influential figure within 
the PD, perhaps because he is a source of funding for the 
Alliance. 
 
18.  (C) Former Minister of Defense (March-December 2000) 
Sorin Frunzaverde often heads the list of names 
most-frequently mentioned as a Defense Minister in an 
Alliance government.  Frunzaverde is a PD Vice Chairman and 
member of the Chamber of Deputies, Defense and Intelligence 
oversight committees.  Many analysts describe his brief 
tenure as Defense Minister as less than stellar.  Moreover, 
Basescu stated during the campaign that he did not want 
members of the 1996-2000 failed center-right government to 
hold ministerial portfolios.  Frunzaverde holds pro-American 
views and is an Embassy interlocutor. 
19.  (C) PD Vice-President Vasile Blaga is widely bruited as 
under consideration for Minister of Administration and 
Interior in a PNL-PD government or as Chief of Presidential 
Administration.  Blaga, a Basescu confidant, is a former 
prefect with an insider\'s perspective on Romanian local 
administration.  He played a key role in Basescu\'s successful 
presidential campaign. 
 
20.  (C) Deputy Cosmin Gusa, like Vasile Blaga and Adrian 
Videanu, is a key member of Basescu\'s inner circle and a 
trusted adviser.  He is a member of the party\'s National 
Standing Bureau, was coordinator of the PD\'s local elections 
campaign in June 2004 and one of the key coordinators for the 
PNL-PD of this year\'s parliamentary and presidential 
campaigns.  Gusa is, literally, Basescu\'s right hand man, 
accompanying him virtually everywhere.  He is leader of PD 
MPs in the Chamber of Deputies.  Gusa began his professional 
career working in broadcasting for media magnate and PUR 
leader Dan Voiculescu.  Not surprisingly, he began his 
political career with PUR, but defected to the PSD where he 
rose quickly to prominence.  PM Nastase selected him as the 
PSD\'s Executive Secretary, which meant he was in charge of 
the party\'s day-to-day activities.  His defection to PD in 
2003 was a blow to the PSD, as Gusa departed with intricate 
knowledge of the PSD\'s inner workings.  Since joining the PD, 
Gusa has become a key dealmaker for the Alliance.  He 
recently told post that he would likely remain in the 
parliament for the time being, rather than entering the 
government, as he expected the lack of a clear majority for 
either major party would lead to \"turf warfare\" between 
PNL-PD and PSD heavyweights bitter they are out of 
government.  Gusa speaks fluent English and spent four months 
in the U.S. in the mid-1990\'s on a program sponsored by U.S. 
NGO Freedom House.  He meets regularly with PolChief and 
other Embassy interlocutors, as well diplomats from other 
countries. 
 
A Husband-Wife Team 
------------------- 
21.  (C) Journalists and married couple Adriana and Claudiu 
Saftoiu, both in their thirties, are trusted Basescu 
counselors who have worked for the President-elect for the 
past several years and are almost certain to play pivotal 
roles in a Basescu administration.  According to press 
reports, Adriana Saftoiu will likely be the Presidency,s 
spokesperson ) a logical choice since she was the press 
officer for Basescu,s winning 2004 mayoral and presidential 
bids and served as government spokesperson in 1999 under the 
center right government.  To be spokesperson, she will need 
to resign her position as a newly elected deputy.  Press 
reports state that Claudiu Saftoiu will probably be the 
Presidency,s political counselor.  Mr. Saftoiu is director 
of Capital Promotion, a political consulting firm, and author 
of a book about the relationship between politicians and the 
mass media.  The Saftoius both helped conceive and execute 
Basescu,s unconventional but successful media messages, 
whose eye catching advertisements during the 2004 mayoral 
campaign, for example, included sepia tinted &retro8 
photographs of Basescu and his team and the image of a red 
hot chili pepper to symbolize Basescu,s outspokenness. 
 
One Young PD Leader 
------------------- 
22.  (C) In a party known for its relative youth, one  young 
PD leader and valued Embassy contact is new Deputy Roberta 
Alma Anastase.  Anastase is Executive Secretary of the PD 
National Board and Secretary of the PD,s Parliamentary Group 
in the Chamber of Deputies.  She is widely recognized as one 
of PD,s up and coming politicians. 
 
Independent Foreign Policy Experts 
---------------------------------- 
23.  (C) In support of the alliance\'s pro-U.S. and pro-EU 
foreign policy, Mihai Razvan Ungureanu, an independent, is 
rumored to be among the Alliance,s top choices for Foreign 
Minister.  A former MFA State Secretary, he is a respected 
historian who did postgraduate studies at Oxford.   He 
distinguished himself as one of Romania\'s top young civil 
servants during his tenure as MFA State Secretary from 1998 
to 2001.  He followed his MFA State Secretary mandate by 
serving as the Special Envoy for the South-East Europe 
Stability Pact Coordinator.  Ungureanu has published numerous 
scholarly articles as well as three historical books.  The 
36-year-old Ungureanu is fluent in English, French, German, 
Italian and Hungarian. 
 
24.  (C) Another pro-American independent who may figure 
prominently in Basescu,s administration is former Foreign 
Minister Andrei Plesu.  According to press reports, Plesu is 
a likely choice for the Presidency,s Foreign Policy 
Counselor and a senior PD adviser recently confirmed to 
PolChief that Plesu would be an important figure in 
Basescu,s administration.  Although not a member of the PD 
and widely viewed as independent, Plesu was something of a 
protg of former PD leader and ex-PM Petre Roman.  Plesu, a 
dissident in the 1980s, was Culture Minister for almost two 
years in the early 1990,s.  As Foreign Minister from 
1997-1999, Plesu strongly supported Romania,s efforts to 
accede to NATO and took the unpopular position of supporting 
the NATO-led intervention in the former Yugoslavia.  In 1994, 
he founded the New Europe College; Mihai Razvan Ungureanu has 
been among its fellows.  Plesu recently resigned from the 
National Council for the Study of Securitate Archives when 
the Council implausibly cleared extreme nationalist and 
&court poet8 of communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor, of charges that he collaborated with 
the communist-era Securitate secret police.

SUBJECT:  INAUGURATION SPEECH DELIVERED BY NEWLY ELECTED 
ROMANIAN PRESIDENT TRAIAN BASESCU 
 
 
1. On December 20, 2004, before a joint session of 
Parliament, newly elected Romanian President Traian Basescu 
delivered his inauguration speech. 
 
2. The text of Embassy Bucharest\'s unofficial translation of 
President Basescu\'s inauguration speech follows below: 
 
\"Mr. President of the Senate, Mr. President of the Chamber 
of Deputies, President Ion Iliescu, distinguished MPs of 
Romania, distinguished representatives of the Diplomatic 
Core, distinguished representatives of the Church, esteemed 
citizens, dear compatriots: 
 
Through the democratic will of the people, I have been 
elected President of Romania.  This vote leads me to have 
greater respect for what I stated when I launched my 
candidacy for the supreme function of the state - to assure 
the citizens of this country once again that I will be the 
President of all Romanians, a powerful, impartial, active 
President, who will dedicate himself 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week to the Romanian nation. 
 
This is my promise to the Romanian people.  I assure you 
that the next five years of my Presidential term in office 
will be years in which Romania will become a different 
country, a functional country, through applying and 
respecting the laws, a country which will be made noteworthy 
through its people.  The Romanian nation needs a President 
who will represent it with dignity, who will work closely 
with state institutions in order to get Romania out of the 
sewer of poverty and corruption.  I will consider that I 
have succeeded in my mandate if I succeed in uniting the 
entire population around the objectives of domestic and 
foreign policies.  We cannot talk about dignifying 
integration in the E.U. without solving the major problems 
of Romania - corruption and poverty. 
 
Dear MPs, I assure you that I will collaborate well with 
state institutions to fight the corruption and poverty that 
has been eating away at society, at the Romanian public and 
at the political system.  Corruption at a high level 
provokes poverty.  These are two things that are necessary 
to one another - corruption and poverty.  Right now, 
corruption at a high level represents the most serious 
danger to [our] national security.  We don\'t need to mask 
poverty under statistics.  Too many retired people have 
pensions smaller than their heating bills in the winter. 
Too many peasants live in poverty, no matter how rich the 
crops are.  Too many young people have begun to believe that 
Romania is no longer a country that has opportunities.  This 
reality must be changed. 
 
To enter life as a poor young person because of an unjust 
system of promotions and careers is the heaviest burden that 
a young Romanian can bear.  Millions of retired people need 
a healthy old age, which must be protected by a health 
insurance system meant to help them, not to bring the ill 
and the old to desperation when they need medicines and, 
equally, respect for their years of work.  As President of 
the Supreme Council of National Defense, I will include the 
fight against high-level corruption in the strategy of 
defending the country.  A fundamental priority of my mandate 
will also be removing state institutions from political 
control.  I will not accept any political interference in 
state institutions, which must function according to the 
Constitution and the laws of the country.  They must be 
immediately de-politicized and put at the service of the 
citizens.  Messrs. MPs, the acute differences between the 
rural and the urban environments are another major problem 
of our society. 
 
I want to assure you and all the citizens of this country 
that there are not several Romanias - there are merely 
politicians who slice Romania up according to their parties\' 
interests and their power of influence.  As President of the 
state, I will defend and promote the interests of every 
Romanian citizen, be that citizen peasant, townsman, member 
of some minority group, child, youngster, pensioner, woman, 
man, rich or poor.  I will be the President of all Romanians 
in one and the same Romania.  I will mediate the 
relationship with the Parliament stubbornly and in good 
faith.  We need a Parliament that is active and reactive to 
the signals from this country\'s citizens.  We must act in 
such a manner that Romanians begin to trust the political 
and law institutions of the Romanian state, after 15 years. 
I will militate for a Parliament that will be an institution 
that represents the interests of those who have chosen it, 
and not a mechanism for the interests of political party 
clients.  I will be a dedicated defender of the freedom of 
the press, which in recent years has experienced serious 
setbacks due to unparalleled political constraints and 
pressures, applied against the Romanian media.  Confiscating 
the freedom of the press is the first step to confiscating 
the freedoms of the citizens. 
 
The successes of democracy cannot take place without the 
existence of a free press, the right to speech and the 
freedom of expression.  I want to assure you that the new 
President of Romania will support civil society.  Romania 
needs its civil society to step up its pace in the role of 
defender and promoter of the rights of every citizen. 
Education, religion, and culture are the surest and 
steadiest gates by which the Romanian spirit may enter the 
family of universal spirits. 
 
I will defend the strategic interests of Romania where 
foreign policy is concerned and I will make our country a 
partner with a highly regarded word.  I will open the 
horizons of Romania\'s foreign policy to all cardinal points, 
in a moment when our country needs allies, partners, and 
friends in all the democratic countries of the world.  A 
major priority in foreign policy and in the positive 
evolution of Romania is integration into the European Union. 
Integration into the European Union is an element of power 
in the foreign policy of Romania.  The integration process 
will include both the values of an action based on 
cooperation with the European Commission, and the values of 
making the best of the traditional bilateral relations that 
Romania has with countries such as France, Germany, Spain, 
Italy, Hungary, Poland, Italy and many other European 
countries.  It is extremely clear that now, after ending the 
negotiations for integration, the fight for integration 
takes place inside Romania.  Here is the place where we must 
fulfill the obligations assumed by Romania\'s government in 
the process of negotiations.  The tough fight to integrate 
into the E.U. must be won at home.  Here is where we must 
obtain the standards of economic and social compatibility 
with the European Union. 
 
Another priority in Romania\'s foreign policy will be to 
consolidate our position in NATO.  It is essential for 
Romania to obtain a position and an influence that reflect 
its real value in this organization, but that also reflect 
its value as a country able to ensure stability south of the 
Danube and east of the Prut River, developing good relations 
with the countries of the former Yugoslavia, with Ukraine 
and with Russia. 
 
We must bear in mind that there are more than six million 
Romanians who have become citizens of other countries, such 
as Canada, Australia, the U.S., Germany, France, Spain, 
Italy and many other countries of the world.  We have a duty 
to re-establish relations with the Romanian diaspora.  We 
have a duty to make these people, who have left their 
country for one reason or another, feel that the mother- 
country mourns for them, that their origin country treats 
them with respect, that Romania is a modern state, a 
powerful state, a state that respects foreign citizens of 
Romanian origins, making them feel that they are part of the 
Romanian people.  The Republic of Moldova will benefit from 
all the openness of the authorities in Bucharest, both in 
the processes of modernizing the country and in bolstering 
the sense that part of that country\'s people are a part of 
the Romanian people. 
 
Above these priorities, Romania will develop privileged 
relations with the U.S. and Great Britain, countries with 
which a strategic partnership has developed even since 1995. 
Distinguished MPs, we all have a very important mission.  If 
the politicians don\'t explain to the citizens what the costs 
of the integration process are, it can be transformed into a 
failure.  We need solidarity regarding integration, in order 
for every citizen to accept the costs of this process.  We 
need an integration process under which the Romanian people 
will be united, to be able to enjoy the benefits of joining 
the E.U.  I want us to be united in one common effort, and 
supported by the modernization of the economy based on the 
principles of rule of law; a dignified Romania, trusting its 
future.  Belonging to one political party or another must 
not prevent us from working together for the citizens who 
have invested us with equal amounts of power and 
responsibility. 
 
Please allow me to say a special word to the young 
Parliamentarians.  Dear novice Parliamentarians, I want to 
assure you of one thing: I have great confidence in you, 
regardless of your political affiliation.  Your promotion to 
the superior forum of this country leads me to congratulate 
all those party presidents who nominated you to the 
Parliamentary lists.  I have always been a supporter of 
rejuvenating the political class, against many skeptical 
voices.  This is why, to convince these skeptics, my wish is 
that you will be my main collaborators, and I urge you to 
consider me your supporter.  First, you must transform this 
institution, the Parliament, into a force and an engine of 
social, political, economical, cultural changes.  I have 
confidence that you will be active and courageous and that 
you will make all of us who are citizens of this country 
recognize and change the image of the Romanian politician. 
I thank you for being here and I hope that you will keep the 
freshness of your minds and souls. 
 
Parliamentarians, dear Romanians, citizens of my country, I 
ask you to be near me in the next 5 years.  I bear in my 
soul the flag of Romania and you around it.  You have my 
word as President that I will serve you with power, good 
faith, and trust.  We will be together during all trials and 
difficulties, but above all we will be together in a better 
life, marked by victories and success.  We will live well, 
in a Romania of Romanians, a European Romania.  So help us 
God!\"  End text.

1. (C) Summary.  Prime Minister designate Calin Popescu 
Tariceanu announced his proposed cabinet December 26, with 
parliament\'s vote of confidence on the list likely to take 
place as early as December 28.  Many of the proposed 
ministers are relatively young, with limited experience.  The 
Humanist Party (PUR), which shifted its allegiance to the 
center-right National Liberal Party-Democratic Party (PNL-PD) 
Alliance late last week, and the ethnic Hungarian party 
(UDMR) both hold key portfolios in the proposed cabinet.  End 
Summary. 
 
2.  (C) PM Designate Calin Popescu Tariceanu announced the 
new government\'s proposed list of twenty-four ministers 
December 26, affirming that the nominees were selected for 
their \"professional performance and moral integrity.\"  The 
widely expected announcement came after days of intense 
PNL-PD Alliance negotiations with UDMR, PUR and the Chamber 
of Deputies\' parliamentary minorities group.  According to 
sources in parliament, Parliamentary Commissions will begin 
reviewing the nominations December 27.  Tariceanu also is 
expected to submit to Parliament December 27 his proposed 
\"program of government,\" essentially the center-right 
Alliance\'s governing roadmap.  Parliament may meet in joint 
session as early as December 28 to vote on the slate and the 
program of government.  PUR\'s decision late last week to join 
forces with the UDMR and the parliamentary minorities group 
in supporting the PNL-PD alliance (Ref B) provides the 
necessary \"yes\" votes for parliamentary approval of the 
proposed cabinet. 
 
3.  (C) Although PNL and PD members dominate the cabinet 
list, both the UDMR and PUR emerged as big winners following 
their endorsement of the alliance, securing several key 
ministerial slots.  UDMR President Bela Marko and PUR Senator 
George Copos will each be Deputy Prime Ministers.  Marko will 
coordinate matters concerning culture, education, and EU 
integration.  Copos\' portfolio has not been formally 
established, but his title encompasses coordination of the 
\"business environment and small and medium enterprises\". 
 
4.  (C) While Tariceanu\'s proposed ministerial list contains 
many fresh - and young - faces.  The plethora of new faces 
has led many Romanian dailies to question whether the new 
cabinet will possess the professional skills and experience 
needed in Romania\'s rough and tumble political scene.  Rumors 
also circulated regarding newly elected President Basescu\'s 
\"meddling\" in the proposed cabinet, with one leading daily 
reporting that Basescu--renowned for his \"hands on\" 
managerial style (read: micromanagement) --changed the 
distribution of several portfolios after negotiations with 
the parties already had been concluded.  (Comment: Post views 
these news analyses with caution, since some of the print 
media is clearly hostile to the new team.  End Comment.) 
 
5.  (C) The proposed ministerial list is set forth below. 
Post provides biographical data on designees except in those 
cases where we have recently submitted biographical 
background information. (See Refs A and C.): 
 
-  Minister of State (Vice Prime Minister) for economic 
activities - Adriean Videanu. 
 
-Minister of State (Vice Prime Minister) for culture, 
education, and EU integration ) Bela Marko.  Marko is 
President of the UDMR and has served in the Romanian Senate 
for more than a decade.  During a nationally televised 
presidential debate prior to the November 28 parliamentary 
and first round of presidential elections, Marko infuriated 
extreme nationalists by delivering his opening statement in 
Hungarian.  He gained five percent in the first round of 
presidential elections.  Until a few weeks ago, Marko\'s UDMR 
was allied with the PSD; he was a mastermind of the PSD-UDMR 
alliance initially formed in 2001. 
 
-Minister of State (Vice Prime Minister) in charge of 
business environment and small and medium enterprises ) 
George Copos.  Recently elected Senator Copos is a newcomer 
to electoral politics, entering the Senate this fall under 
the PUR banner.  Indeed, he joined the PUR only a few weeks 
before the November 28 parliamentary elections, receiving a 
favorable position on PUR\'s parliamentary list.  He is one of 
Romania\'s wealthiest businessmen, holding a major share of 
Ana Holding (industry, trade and tourism).  He also owns the 
popular Bucharest soccer club \"Rapid.\"  Affiliated before the 
revolution with the youth branch of the Communist Party, 
Copos managed to get state aid for his companies both under 
the outgoing, center-left Social Democratic Party (PSD) 
government and previous governments.  The 52-year-old Copos 
appears a marked contrast with the proposed cabinet\'s 
youngish, reformist bent. 
 
-Minister of Foreign Affairs - Mihai Razvan Ungureanu 
 
-Minister of Interior and Administration - Vasile Blaga 
 
-Minister of Justice - Monica Macovei is not affiliated with 
any political party, insisting when she accepted the 
nomination for Justice Minister that she has no intention of 
joining any party.  She is a lawyer and the president of 
respected NGO APADOR-CH (Association for the Defense of Human 
Rights Romania ) Helsinki Committee).  She successfully 
represented Romanian citizens in lawsuits against the 
Romanian state.  APADOR-CH was a founding member of the 
Coalition for a Clean Parliament, which sought to educate 
voters on candidates\' anticorruption track records during the 
2004 parliamentary elections. 
 
-Minister of Public Finance - Ionut Popescu 
 
-Minister of Labor, Social Solidarity and Family - Gheorghe 
Barbu is a member of the Democratic Party and was President 
of the Hunedoara county council from 1996-2000.  Elected

Basescu confidant).  When Basescu took over the party, Barbu 
became the PD Vice President for Trade Union Partnerships.  A 
member of the Chamber of Deputies standing Commission on 
Labor, he focused on problems related to the pension system. 
The 53-year-old Barbu served as a MOD State Secretary for six 
months in 2000. 
 
-Minister of European Integration - Cristina Parvulescu. 
The 29-year-old Parvulescu has worked in Bucharest\'s City

at the Ministry of Industry.  She is a graduate of the 
Academy of Economic Sciences. 
 
-Minister of Economy - Codrut Seres.  Seres is one the PUR\'s 
most prominent politicians and is the party\'s spokesperson. 
He was nominated as the PUR presidential candidate after 
PUR\'s successful local elections campaign in June.  Seres 
withdrew his candidacy after PUR joined forces with PSD late 
summer this year.  As is the case with all PUR politicians, 
Seres owes his political career to PUR President and media 
magnate Dan Voiculescu.  Seres began working for Voiculescu 
at his Antenna 1 TV station before being promoted to Director 
for Development and Strategies at Grivco, one of 
Voiculescu,s most successful enterprises.  He is a graduate 
of a military academy and is an engineer by training. 
 
-Minister of National Defense - Teodor Atanasiu.  The 
42-year-old Atanasiu is a PNL member and became president of 
the Alba county council in June 2004.  He was manager of the 
Cugir armaments plant from 1987 to 1995, and from 1997 to 
2000, according to press reports.  He was a board member of 
the Privatization Authority from 1996 to 2000.  The choice of 
Atanasiu was widely viewed as a \"surprise\" pick. 
 
-Minister of Transportation, Construction and Tourism - 
Gheorghe Dobre.  Touted as one of Basescu,s right hand men, 
Dobre has been the Director of Bucharest City Hall,s 
Inspection and Control department since 2001.  He served as 
the MOT,s Secretary General (1998)2000) as well as in the

a Prefect for Dolj County in the 1990\'s. 
 
-Minister of Agriculture - Gheorghe Flutur 
 
-Minister of Education and Research - Mircea Miclea.  PD 
Member Miclea is chair of the Babes Bolyai University 
psychology department and is, at 41 years of age, reputedly 
the youngest professor at the university.  Miclea, who has a 
PhD in cognitive psychology, was Chancellor General for the 
university from 2000-2003. 
 
-Minister of Culture - Mona Musca 
 
-Minister of Health  - Mircea Cinteza 
 
-Minister of Communication and IT - Nagy Szolt.  Currently 
UDMR Executive Vice Chairman for territorial organizations

-General Secretary of the Government - Mihai Voicu.  Since 
2001, he has served as the PNL General Secretary, actively 
involved in party management and the PNL electoral campaigns. 
 The 36-year-old Voicu was president of PNL youth branch from 
1991 to 1994.  An engineer by training, he has experience as 
a manager and works as a consultant.  He kept a low profile 
until recently, when he successfully ran for deputy from Dolj 
County. 
 
-Minister of Environment - Sulfina Barbu.  The 37-year-old 
Barbu is a PD member recently promoted to Director of 
Bucharest City Hall,s Environment Department.  She

2000-2004.  He has a background in finance and insurance and 
has also studied engineering.  The 40-year-old Winkler speaks 
fluent English, as well as German and French, and is a 
graduate of the prestigious National Defense College.  He is 
a valued Embassy interlocutor. 
 
6.  (C) Comment.  In keeping with its campaign pledge, 
Tariceanu\'s cabinet list proposes to bring many relatively 
new faces into senior government positions.  Few played 
significant roles in the controversial center-right 1996-2000 
government.  Moreover, few of the proposed ministers, in 
marked contrast to the outgoing ruling center-left Social 
Democratic Party (PSD) cabinet, are tainted by association 
with Romania\'s communist past.  Many are simply too young. 
Assuming the Parliament green lights the proposed cabinet, 
Basescu and Tariceanu\'s \"fresh faces\" can anticipate a strong 
dose of realpolitik as they deal with savvy PSD legislators 
entrenched in key parliamentary leadership positions, 
including the presidencies of the Senate and Chamber of 
Deputies.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: ROMANIA: INVESTMENT CLIMATE STATEMENT, 2005 
 
REF: STATE 250356 
 
--------------------------------- 
A. Openness to Foreign Investment 
--------------------------------- 
 
Encouraging Investment 
---------------------- 
Romania actively seeks foreign direct investment.  A new 
center-right government that assumed power in late 
December 2004 has emphasized its desire to make Romania 
a more attractive investment destination and to improve 
aspects of the business climate.  To date, despite 
Romania\'s marketplace of 21.7 million consumers, a well- 
educated workforce, and abundant natural resources, 
investment remains below potential.  Favored areas for 
American investment include IT and telecommunications, 
biotechnology, manufacturing, and consumer products. 
 
Romania is moving to lower tax rates and strengthen tax 
administration, enhance transparency, and create legal 
means to resolve contract disputes expeditiously.  Until 
recently, legislative unpredictability continued to 
undermine investor confidence.  Prospective U.S. 
investors should consult legal counsel to receive up-to- 
date legal information. 
 
Successful U.S. companies tend to establish a local 
presence to familiarize themselves with the business 
climate.  Using this expertise, firms develop longer- 
term strategies and commitments necessary for building 
lasting partnerships with the Government of Romania 
(GOR), local government authorities, labor unions, and 
local partners.  These partnerships can ameliorate 
potential resistance to foreign investment that remains 
in some quarters, including nationalistic officials, 
workers fearful of losing their jobs, some managers of 
state-owned enterprises who are not accustomed to market 
economy business practices, and some local companies 
resisting competition through corrupt connections and 
practices. 
 
Investments that involve the public authorities (GOR 
ministries, local public authorities) are generally more 
complicated than greenfield investments or joint ventures 
with private Romanian companies.  Large deals involving the 
GOR - particularly public-private-partnerships- have been 
stymied by vested political and economic interests and 
bogged down by inaction within and lack of coordination 
among governmental ministries.  Privatizations by lesser- 
known buyers have been at times obstructed by the 
privatization agency\'s failure to honor its commitments or 
take other actions consistent with the best interests of the 
privatized enterprise. 
 
EU Accession 
------------ 
Romania has worked to create a legal framework 
consistent with a market economy and investment 
promotion, and is moving ahead with EU-compatible 
legislation in its quest to join the European Union. 
Implementation lags, however.  With an increasing number 
of EU-driven pieces of legislation, it is at times hard 
for Romania to balance its EU accession goals with its 
WTO undertakings.  To date, Romania has added into its 
national legislation over 2000 primary and secondary 
pieces of legislation from the EU acquis. 
 
Romania provisionally closed pre-accession negotiations 
with the EU in December 2004.  Pending continued 
progress in complying with membership criteria, Romania 
is to become a EU member on January 1, 2007.  However, 
the EU added a safeguard clause into Romania\'s Accession 
Treaty, which enables the EU to postpone Romania\'s 
accession by one year, to January l, 2008, if there is 
clear evidence that Romania is manifestly unprepared to 
meet the requirements of EU membership. 
 
The U.S. Department of Commerce recognized Romania as a 
market economy for anti-dumping investigation purposes 
in March 2003.  Romania also received functioning market 
economy status from the EU in October 2004, thus meeting 
a necessary condition for EU membership.  However, 
Romania\'s ability to withstand competitive pressures 
after EU accession remains a concern. 
 
Legal Framework 
--------------- 
Romania\'s legal framework for foreign investment is 
contained in a substantial body of law, largely passed 
in the late 1990s and subject to frequent revision 
since.  Local counsel should be engaged to navigate 
through the various laws, decrees, and regulations. 
 
Romanian legislation and regulation provides national 
treatment for foreign investors, guarantees them free 
access to domestic markets, and allows foreign investors 
to participate in privatizations.  There is no limit on 
foreign participation in commercial enterprises. 
Foreign investors are entitled to establish wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises in Romania (although joint 
ventures are more typical) and to convert and repatriate 
100 percent of after-tax profits.  Foreign firms are 
allowed to participate in the management and 
administration of the investment, as well as to assign 
their contractual obligations and their rights to other 
Romanian or foreign investors. 
 
Foreign investors may engage in business activities in 
Romania via any of the following methods: 
- Setting up new commercial companies, subsidiaries or 
branches, either wholly owned or in partnership with 
Romanian natural or legal persons; 
- Participating in the increase of capital of an 
existing company or the acquisition of shares, bonds, or 
other securities of such companies; 
- Acquiring concessions, leases or agreements to manage 
economic activities, public services, or the production 
of subsidiaries belonging to commercial companies or 
state-owned public corporations; 
- Acquiring ownership rights over non-residential real 
estate improvements, including land, via establishment 
of a Romanian company; 
- Acquiring industrial or other intellectual property 
rights; 
- Concluding exploration and production-sharing 
agreements related to the development of natural 
resources. 
 
Foreign investor participation can take the form of 
foreign capital, equipment, means of transport, spare 
parts and other goods, services, intellectual property 
rights, technical know-how and management expertise, or 
proceeds and profits from other businesses carried out 
in Romania.  Foreign investment must comply with 
environmental protection, national security, defense 
interest, public order, and public health regulations. 
 
Privatization 
------------- 
Romania has made significant progress in privatizing 
industrial companies.  To date, less than 5% of the 
industrial assets are still state-owned.  Privatization 
in the energy sector also has progressed, with the 
privatization of national oil company Petrom, two energy 
distribution companies, and two natural gas distribution 
companies.  Romania has granted some companies involved 
in energy privatizations with safeguards against paying 
for environmental remediation resulting from past 
contamination. 
 
Under current law, the government ministry or agency 
that has authority over a state-owned company (the State 
Asset Resolution Authority (AVAS), the Ministry of 
Economy and Commerce, Ministry of Transportation, 
Ministry of Communications and IT, or in some cases, 
local government) also has the authority to privatize 
it.  The law on privatization requires the setting up of 
pre-privatization management team to facilitate 
restructuring of the company and eventual privatization. 
The law permits the responsible authority to hire an 
agent to handle the entire privatization process. 
 
Buyers of state-owned companies must negotiate 
requirements and restrictions concerning the company\'s 
purpose, scope of activities, turnover, and social 
protections in the form of limited layoffs or funding 
for retraining programs.  Privatizing agencies continue 
the practice of rolling into privatization agreements 
provisions of previously negotiated collective labor 
agreements, which are labor-protective and restrict 
layoffs.  Prospective investors are strongly advised to 
make a thorough due diligence review before any 
acquisition. 
 
Property and Contractual Rights 
------------------------------- 
Property and contractual rights are recognized, but 
enforcement through the judicial process can be 
extremely difficult, costly, and lengthy.  Foreign 
companies engaged in trade or investment in Romania 
often express concern regarding the lack of commercial 
experience of Romanian courts.  Judges generally have 
little experience in the functioning of a market 
economy, international business methods, intellectual 
property rights, or the application of new Romanian 
commercial law. 
 
------------------------------------ 
B.  Conversion and Transfer Policies 
------------------------------------ 
 
Romanian legislation does not restrict the conversion or 
transfer of funds associated with direct investment. 
All profits made by foreign investors in Romania may be 
converted into hard currency and transferred abroad at 
the market exchange rate after payment of taxes. 
However, some conversion and transfer procedures can be 
time-consuming due to Romanian bureaucracy. 
 
The Leu is freely convertible on current-account 
transactions, in accordance with the IMF\'s Article VII. 
Proceeds from the sale of shares, bonds, or other 
securities, as well as from the conclusion of an 
investment, can also be repatriated.  There is no 
limitation on the inflow or outflow of funds for 
remittances of profits, debt service, capital gains, 
returns on intellectual property or imported inputs. 
 
In February 1998, the Romanian government implemented new 
regulations that liberalized foreign exchange markets. 
However, procedural delays in processing capital outflows 
remain, mainly from the lack of a domestic inter-bank 
electronic system, which is under development and scheduled 
to become operational in 2005. 
 
Capital inflows are relatively free from restraint. 
Only the opening of the ROL deposits by non-residents 
still requires approval by the Central Bank, in order to 
prevent inflows of \"hot money\" from abroad, but this 
restriction is expected to be removed in April 2005 as 
capital account liberalization advances.  According to 
Romania\'s agreements with the European Union and 
international financial organizations, Romania will 
gradually implement such liberalization prior to 
Romania\'s accession to the EU (i.e. enable  ROL- 
denominated deposit accounts to be opened by foreigners 
with resident financial institutions, and  current and 
deposit accounts by residents abroad). 
 
---------------------------------- 
C.  Expropriation and Compensation 
---------------------------------- 
 
The law on direct investment includes a guarantee 
against nationalization and expropriation or other 
equivalent actions.  The law allows investors to select 
the court or arbitration body of their choice to settle 
potential litigation.  Since 1989, there have been two 
American expropriation claims, one arising from a 
controversial privatization and the other the 
nationalization of an investor\'s assets.  Several cases 
involving property nationalized during the communist era 
remain unresolved. 
 
Investors should be aware, when purchasing land or a 
former state-owned company, that in those cases where a 
former owner wins title to a privatized asset, it may be 
restituted in kind and the investor compensated by the 
public institution that privatized it.  If restitution 
is not possible in kind, the public institution must 
compensate the former owners.  In either case, the 
current or former owners run the risk of less than fair 
market value compensation.  Prospective investors must 
conduct a careful due diligence review encompassing 
potential restitution claims. 
 
---------------------- 
D.  Dispute Settlement 
---------------------- 
 
Arbitration 
----------- 
Romania recognizes the importance of arbitration in the 
settlement of commercial disputes.  Many agreements 
involving international companies and Romanian 
counterparts provide for the resolution of disputes 
through third-party arbitration.  Romania is a signatory 
to the New York Convention of 1958 regarding the 
recognition and execution of foreign arbitration awards. 
Romania is also a party to the European convention on 
international commercial arbitration concluded in Geneva 
in 1961 and a member of the International Center for the 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). 
 
Romanian law and practice recognize applications to 
other internationally known arbitration institutions, 
such as the ICC Paris Court of Arbitration or the Vienna 
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 
(UNCITRAL).  Romania also has an International Commerce 
Arbitration Court administered by the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of Romania (the \"Arbitration 
Court\").  Arbitration awards are enforceable through 
Romanian courts under circumstances similar to those in 
Western countries. 
 
Bankruptcy 
---------- 
Romania\'s bankruptcy law contains provisions for 
liquidation and reorganization that are generally 
consistent with western legal standards.  These laws 
usually emphasize enterprise restructuring and job 
preservation.  Legal and economic education and the 
training of judges and lawyers lags behind law-making, 
which often results in inconsistent outcomes. Moreover, 
social concerns often prevail over economic reasoning, 
resulting in the survival of overstaffed loss-making 
companies which should otherwise be dissolved. 
 
To mitigate the time and financial costs of 
bankruptcies, Romanian legislation provides for 
administrative liquidation as an alternative to 
bankruptcy.  However, investors have complained that the 
liquidators lack the competence and incentive to 
expedite liquidation proceedings.  For state-owned loss- 
making companies, state subsidies, accumulation of 
arrears, debt rescheduling and debt-for-equity swaps are 
the preferred alternatives to putting such companies 
through insolvency or bankruptcy procedures.  Both state- 
owned and private companies tend to opt for judicial 
reorganization to avoid bankruptcy. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
E.  Performance Requirements/Incentives 
--------------------------------------- 
 
Incentives 
---------- 
Since 1991, Romania\'s legislation has seesawed between 
granting, amending and suspending investment incentives. 
The availability of incentives is dependent on the economic 
situation, with the government at times suspending 
incentives in order to tighten fiscal policy.  To meet the 
requirements of the EU body of law termed the \"acquis 
communitaire\" (short form: the \"acquis\"), Romania is 
revisiting its fiscal incentives to bring them in line with 
the EU state aid regulations.  Investors are encouraged to 
verify the current status of investment incentives. As a 
general rule, new fiscal regulations do not grandfather past 
incentives. 
 
As Romania prepares for EU accession, customs and tax 
incentives are being phased out for investors in free 
trade and economically disadvantaged zones.  In line 
with the revised state-aid law, Romanian has capped the 
state aid available for major investments based on the 
investment size and location.  The state aid available 
through incentives for companies in free trade zones and 
disadvantaged zones has been capped at 50% of the 
investment, and likewise state aid for small and medium- 
sized enterprises (SMEs) to 65% of the investment. 
Prospective investors are advised to investigate 
thoroughly the current status of fiscal incentives and 
consider possible future changes resulting from EU 
accession negotiations when drafting business and 
investment plans. 
 
To reduce initial startup costs, a system of industrial 
parks and technological parks is being created.  Tax 
incentives are available under the law solely for the 
industrial park operator, while companies that establish 
themselves in the park benefit from access to utility 
hookups and infrastructure, and eventual local tax 
rebates within state aid caps. 
 
Tax System 
---------- 
Romania has revised its tax system to bring it closer to 
EU models and more in line with the recommendations of 
the World Bank and IMF. 
 
In December 2004, a new government amended the Fiscal 
Code by emergency ordinance, abolishing tax brackets and 
establishing a 16% flat tax on personal incomes. 
Corporate taxation will likewise be reduced from 25% to 
16%.  Both of the measures are to come into force 
beginning January 1, 2005.  Offsetting these cuts is an 
increase in the micro-enterprise tax from 1.5% to 3%, 
and a rise of the tax on dividends obtained by 
individuals from 10% to 15%, in line with the corporate 
dividend tax of 15%. 
 
Tariff Preferences 
------------------ 
Like many other Central and Eastern European countries, 
Romania provides tariff preferences for EU goods under 
its association agreement with the EU.  In 2003, Romania 
came under generalized system of preferences (GSP) 
scrutiny because of preferential tariff treatment 
(reverse preferences) it offers the EU, but no formal 
review was taken because Romania reduced its tariffs on 
Bourbon - the main U.S. industry petitioner.  However, 
Romania took no further action to reduce tariff 
preferences for other U.S. products, and may actually 
raise some of the tariffs previously reduced.  In June 
2004, a pharmaceutical company petitioned USTR for 
review of Romania\'s GSP status. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
F.  Right to Private Ownership; Establishing Firms 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
The Romanian constitution, adopted in December 1991, and 
revised in 2003, guarantees the right to ownership of 
private property.  Mineral, air rights, and similar 
rights are excluded from private ownership.  At the 
present time, property can only be purchased by 
foreigners through their participation in a Romanian 
company.  As of January 1, 2007, EU citizens will be 
able to buy land without restrictions. 
 
Foreign investors involved with commercial companies 
having any foreign capital may acquire land or property 
necessary for fulfilling or developing the company\'s 
corporate goals.  If the company is dissolved or 
liquidated, the land must be sold within one year of the 
company\'s closure and may be sold only to a buyer(s) 
with the legal right to purchase such assets.  Foreign 
investors cannot purchase agricultural land at this 
time.  Under Law 268/2001, investors can purchase shares 
in agricultural companies that can lease land in the 
public domain from the State Land Agency. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
G.  Protection of Private Property Rights 
----------------------------------------- 
Mortgages 
--------- 
Law No. 190/1999 on mortgage loans for real estate 
investments allows a debtor\'s receivables to be used as 
a guarantee, and specifically addresses the protection 
of both borrowers and creditors, in an effort to 
minimize risk to the lender.  Domestic private and 
foreign capital banks and investment funds freely 
compete on the mortgage market with the state-supported 
Banca Comerciala Romana (BCR) and with the state-budget 
National Housing Agency (ANL).  Using its limited state 
budget resources, ANL targets young applicants and 
charges interest of 7% per annum in EURO for applicants 
under 35, and 9% for applicants over that age.  Banks 
charge an average 9.87% per annum for USD loans and 
9.185% for Euro loans, practice more flexible terms, and 
have greater resources available for mortgages. 
Usually, interest charged tracks LIBOR at six months for 
loans granted in USD and EURIBOR at six months for loans 
granted in Euro, with the addition of Romanian country 
spread. 
 
Intellectual Property Rights 
---------------------------- 
Romania is a signatory to international conventions 
concerning intellectual property rights (IPR), including 
TRIPS, and has enacted legislation protecting patents, 
trademarks, and copyrights.  Romania signed the Internet 
Convention to protect on-line authorship.  While the IPR 
legal framework is generally good, enforcement is 
woefully weak.  Romania has passed border IPR control 
enforcement provisions as required under the WTO, yet 
customs authorities and border police controls remain 
equally lax.  As result of persistent problems in the 
enforcement of intellectual property rights, the U.S. 
Trade Representative (USTR) kept Romania on its Special 
301 Watch List for 2004.  High piracy levels continued 
across all sectors, optical disc piracy grew, and poor 
border enforcement led to a surge in imports of pirated 
material.  The situation is further exacerbated by the 
lack of resources dedicated to enforcement.  Prosecution 
of IPR violators is rare, and when cases are 
adjudicated, penalties meted out are light.  No one has 
gone to jail for IPR piracy. 
 
Patents 
------- 
Romania is a party to the Paris Convention for the 
protection of industrial property and subscribes to all 
of its amendments.  Foreign investors are therefore 
entitled to the same treatment as Romanian citizens. 
Patents are valid for 20 years.  A patent application 
can be contested for six months.  A modern Patent Law 
(No. 64/91) broadens and clarifies the basis on which a 
patent is granted.  By GOR Decision 499 of May 2003, 
technical enforcement rules on the Patent Law came into 
force.  Several other laws (No. 129/92, on the 
protection of industrial drawings and designs; No. 
16/95, on the protection of integrated circuit designs, 
etc.) have helped bring Romanian patent legislation up 
to international standards.  Legislation providing for 
transitory (\"pipeline\") patent protection was enacted in 
early 1998.  The Romanian Parliament passed legislation 
to protect confidential drug test data submitted to 
regulatory authorities for marketing approval.  Law 123 
of April 2004 clearly articulates data exclusivity 
provisions. 
 
Trademarks 
---------- 
In 1998 Romania passed a new law on trademarks which is 
generally consistent with international standards. 
Areas that require improvement are administrative 
procedures and sanctions.  Romania is a signatory to the 
Madrid Agreement relating to the international 
registration of trademarks.  Trademark registrations are 
valid for 10 years from the date of application, and 
renewable for similar periods. 
 
Copyrights 
---------- 
Romania is a member of the Bern Convention on 
Copyrights.  Its 1996 law on protection of copyrights 
and neighboring rights is among the most modern in this 
field.  The Romanian parliament ratified the latest 
versions of the Bern and Rome conventions.  The Romanian 
Office for Copyright protection (ORDA) was established 
in 1997, and ostensibly oversees copyright enforcement. 
However, copyright law enforcement is a low priority for 
Romanian prosecutors, judges, police officers, and 
customs officers.  Some in government, including those 
responsible for enforcement, view copyright piracy as a 
\"victimless crime.\"  This attitude, coupled with lack of 
resources, has resulted in weak enforcement of copyright 
law and the failure to prosecute and punish violators. 
Copyright infringement in software, music, and video is 
pervasive throughout Romania.  Although on a decline 
over the past few years, piracy rates are still high. 
Latest estimated piracy rates by sector are: 73% of 
business software; 95% of entertainment software; 56% of 
music; and 55% of video. 
 
Semiconductor Chip Layout Design 
-------------------------------- 
Law No. 16/1995 protects semiconductor chip layout 
design.  In order to benefit from this law, the designs 
must be registered per GOR decision no. 535/1996 with 
the Romanian Trademark Office. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
H.  Transparency of the Regulatory System 
----------------------------------------- 
 
Cumbersome and non-transparent bureaucratic procedures 
are a major problem in Romania.  Foreign investors point 
to the excessive time it takes to secure necessary 
zoning permits, property titles, licenses, and utility 
hook-ups.  Furthermore, regulations change frequently, 
often without advance notice.  These changes, which can 
significantly add to the costs of doing business, make 
it difficult for investors to develop effective business 
plans. 
 
Recognizing the need for more effective communication 
with foreign investors and Romanian private businesses, 
in April 2002 the GOR instituted a preliminary 
consultation procedure before drafting business-related 
legislation.  As a result, some ministries, such as the 
Ministry of IT and Communications, do consult with 
businesses, but not all.  The labor code adopted in 2003 
is a glaring example of the GOR\'s failure to consult 
with or listen to the business community.  The 
controversial code gives extensive new rights to labor 
unions and employees and is a significant impediment to 
new foreign direct investment.  Following general 
elections in November and December 2004, the GOR pledged 
to amend some aspects of the code, but whether it will 
be able to do so in the face of labor unions\' objections 
remains to be seen. 
 
 
Many foreign investors feel they are unfairly targeted 
by Romanian tax authorities for audits and reviews and 
that Romanian authorities view them as \"cash cows\" that 
can be milked to fill government coffers.  Unlike most 
Romanian companies, foreign investors generally have 
good financial records, making investigation easier. 
Foreign investors also tend to be more conscious of the 
need to remain in compliance with local laws and 
regulations.  Despite the establishment of a new 
Minister Delegate for Control in June 2003 to coordinate 
the audits of the various ministries and government 
agencies, redundant or too-frequent audits and reviews 
continue to be a hindrance. 
 
The presence of large state-owned and government-subsidized 
enterprises in the economy is a major impediment to the 
efficient mobilization and allocation of investment capital. 
An EU-inspired law on state aid aimed to limit state aid of 
any form (direct state subsidies, debt rescheduling schemes, 
debt for equity swaps for utility arrears, or discount 
prices).  However, implementation of the law has been slow 
and preferential debt rescheduling (and on occasions 
forgiveness) by the GOR has continued. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
I.  Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
Capital Markets 
--------------- 
Romania seeks to develop efficient capital markets. 
Ordinance No. 18/93 and Government Decision No. 552/92 
established a National Securities Commission (CNVM) 
charged with regulating the securities market in order 
to protect investors.  The process provides for the 
registration and licensing of brokers and financial 
intermediaries, filing and approval of prospectuses, and 
approval of market mechanisms. 
 
Romania officially re-opened the Bucharest Stock 
Exchange (BSE) on June 22, 1995. On November 20, 1995, 
the stock exchange made its first transactions after a 
hiatus of 50 years.  The BSE operates a two-tier system 
that, at present, lists a total of 60 companies, with 
17 companies in the first tier.  The official index, 
BET, is based on a basket of the 10 most active stocks 
listed on the first tier.  The BSE has a home page at 
http://www.bse.ccir.ro. 
 
In September 1996, RASDAQ, an over-the-counter stock 
market, was inaugurated.  It is supported by several 
independent registries and is a depository for Romanian 
securities.  4,040 companies are listed on the RASDAQ, 
although less than 200 companies are actively traded on 
an average day.  RASDAQ has a home page at 
http://www.rasd.ro. 
 
The BSE and RASDAQ are set to merge in 2005.  The new 
Capital Markets Law 297/2004 allows the Bucharest Stock 
Exchange to incorporate as a stock company, which 
permits its merger with the OTC-market, RASDAQ.  Once 
the National Securities Commission (CNVM) approves the 
merger and the technical plan, the consolidation process 
should require 5-6 months to complete. 
 
Despite the presence of two stock exchanges, Romanian 
capital markets have developed more slowly than might be 
expected.  This is due in part to legislative 
instability, non-transparent privatization, lack of 
performance and liquidity of most listed companies and 
poor corporate governance.  In 2002, the GOR issued 
several ordinances designed to increase liquidity and 
transparency and encourage portfolio investment.  The 
GOR also granted additional power to the National 
Securities Commission (CNVM).  Securities Collective 
Placement Organizations are now allowed to invest 
locally and internationally in foreign currency- 
denominated instruments. 
 
Tight competition has brought trading fees down, but 
listed volumes make it difficult to place large purchase 
orders.  This, in conjunction with non-transparent 
disclosures and the lack of annual audit reports, tends 
to discourage large institutional investors.  Country 
funds, hedge funds, and venture capital funds continue 
to participate actively in the capital markets. 
 
The Romanian government has responded to complaints by U.S. 
investment funds regarding the abuse of minority shareholder 
rights by including some protections in a 2002 GOR ordinance 
on securities, financial investments and regulated markets. 
The new reforms allow shareholders owning more than 10% of a 
stock to request a general shareholders meeting.  Dividend 
payments must now remain in effect six months after the 
announcement.  An extraordinary shareholders\' meeting must 
approve purchase or sale/rent/lease of fixed assets worth 
over 20% of the company\'s total assets.  Law 525 of July 
2002 ratified the ordinance on securities and regulated 
markets, and was complemented by Law 512 on commodity 
exchanges and derivatives. 
 
Banking Sector 
-------------- 
Romania\'s largest bank, the state-owned Romanian 
Commercial Bank, with assets totaling $6.5billion (27% 
of total banking assets), is to be privatized in 
installments.  25% plus two shares were sold to two 
international financial organizations, EBRD and IFC, for 
a combined $222 million in 2004. The contract stipulates 
that the stock is to be purchased back by the GOR in 
2006 if no strategic investor acquires a majority stake 
in the bank by then.  If a strategic investor places a 
binding offer, the two international finance 
organizations are to redeem their shares to the GOR at a 
price per share not lower than the one initially paid. 
In turn, the GOR will re-sell the shares to provide the 
investor a 51% portfolio stake, (8% of the stock has 
already been sold to bank management and employees.) 
 
After BCR, of the 39 banks operating in Romania, the 
Romanian Bank for Development (BRD, Societe General), 
with $ 3.1 billion assets (12.95% of total), is the 
second largest bank, followed by Raiffeisen Bank ($1.4 
billion, 7.1%), ABN-AMRO Bank, ($1.3 billion, 6.6%), and 
the National Savings House (CEC), $1.28 billion, 6.5%. 
Citibank is the major U.S. brand name, with 
approximately $500 million in assets (market share of 
about 2.3%). 
 
Removing non-performing assets from the banking sector 
cost Romania $2.2 billion, almost 7% of the annual GDP 
in the late nineties.  According to the Romanian Central 
Bank, non-performing past due and doubtful loans now 
represent only 0.6% of the total loan portfolio, but 
this is probably a substantial underestimate. 
 
The GOR actively encourages foreign investments in the 
banking sector, and there are no restrictions on mergers and 
acquisitions.  Few hostile take-over attempts have been 
reported in Romania, with the result being that Romanian law 
has not focused on limiting potential mergers or 
acquisitions.  There are no Romanian laws prohibiting or 
restricting private firms\' free association with foreign 
investments.  Capital account liberalization is in progress 
and scheduled to be completed by 2005, with the exception of 
land purchase by non-residents, for which Romania was 
granted a 7-year phase-in period by the EU. 
 
---------------------- 
J.  Political Violence 
---------------------- 
 
There have been no incidents in Romania involving 
politically motivated damage to foreign investments 
(projects and/or installations).  Major civil 
disturbances are not expected to occur in Romania in the 
near future. 
 
-------------- 
K.  Corruption 
-------------- 
 
According to Transparency International, Romania is 
included in the tier of countries considered the most 
corrupt.  U.S. firms frequently complain of government 
and business corruption in Romania.  The customs 
service, municipal zoning offices, local financial 
authorities, and other bodies are influenced to some 
degree by corruption.  In some cases, demands for 
payoffs by mid- to low-level officials reach the point 
of harassment. 
 
Romanian law and regulations contain provisions intended 
to prevent corruption, but enforcement is generally 
weak.  Corruption is currently punishable under a 
variety of statutes in the penal code.  Prison sentences 
are sometimes imposed, but powerful and influential 
individuals often evade prosecution. 
 
The GOR announced a National Anti-Corruption Plan in 
spring 2003 and passed an anti-corruption law in April 
of that year.  The Plan contains an impressive list of 
measures and commitments that constitute key benchmarks 
for judging the GOR\'s commitment to combat corruption. 
The implementation of these measures and commitments has 
lagged, undercutting the state\'s professed commitment to 
follow through on its anti-corruption policies.  The new 
center-right government came to power in December 2004, 
in part based on a pledge to combat corruption.  At the 
time of drafting it was premature to make any judgment 
about GOR commitment to this pledge.  Nevertheless, the 
USG will continue to work actively with the GOR to 
secure more effective anti-corruption measures. 
 
A new criminal code came into effect in 2003.  Romania 
passed an anti-money laundering law in 1999 which set up 
the Romanian National Office for the Prevention and 
Control of Money Laundering (NOPCML).  Romania followed 
this legislation with the Law on the Prevention and 
Sanctioning of Money Laundering in 2002.  With U.S. 
help, the Romanian government established in September 
the National Anti-Corruption Prosecutors\' Office (PNA) 
in 2002, staffed by prosecutors and police to combat 
corruption.  Despite these measures, most anti- 
corruption efforts remain focused on low-level 
corruption.  To date, criminal prosecutions of only low 
and mid-level officials and functionaries have been 
carried to completion. 
 
Romania is a member country of the Southeast European 
Cooperation Initiative (SECI), and it has signed and 
ratified the Agreement on Cooperation to Prevent and 
Combat Transborder Crime of May 1999.  Bucharest hosts 
the SECI Regional Center for Combating Corruption and 
Organized Crime, and Romania is one of the three members 
of the Joint Cooperation Committee. 
 
To reduce corrupt practices in public procurements, in March 
2002 a web-based e-procurement pilot system was inaugurated 
and is available at www.e-licitatie.ro.  The system is a 
transparent listing of ongoing auctions and closed auctions, 
with the names of the winners and closing prices made 
available to the public.  The use of e-licitatie has 
increased government efficiency, reduced GOR vulnerability 
to corruption, and improved fiscal responsibility in 
government procurement.  E-procurement increased from 159 
government clients and 600 suppliers in its initial months 
matching the procurements of 1,000 state entities with 
offers from 10,000 bidders.  With a turnover of EURO 300 
million in 2003, the system resulted in an estimated average 
22% savings rate, saving the budget EURO 100 million in two 
years.  Initially used solely for standard products, the 
program has grown to include complex projects (e.g. state- 
financed sports halls for public schools).  The system does 
not take the human element completely out of the decision- 
making process, as the bids for complex supplies and 
projects are still reviewed by appraisal committees.  Pre- 
qualification criteria for prospective bidders and contract 
follow up by the end-user also leave room for corruption. 
 
Court System 
------------ 
The Romanian judicial system suffers from corruption, 
inefficiencies, lack of competence, and excessive workloads. 
Divergent and often contradictory rulings have alienated 
both investors and ordinary citizens and discredited the 
Romanian judicial system.  Companies routinely complain that 
commercial disputes take too long to resolve through the 
court system and once a verdict is reached, court orders are 
not enforced.  Low salaries result in clerks, attorneys and 
judges being susceptible to bribes or other \"extra-judicial\" 
payments, most commonly to \"speed up\" litigation or to 
assure a particular judge is assigned to a case.  Courts are 
overburdened and the number of magistrates and judges too 
small.  Significantly, litigants in virtually all cases have 
unrestricted right to appeal their cases all the way to the 
High Court of Cassation and Justice, which clogs court 
dockets throughout the system and introduces lengthy delays. 
 
Cyber Crime 
----------- 
Romania has one of the world\'s highest occurrences of 
internet credit card fraud.  The problem, which surfaced in 
the fall of 1998, has escalated to a steady stream of 
complaints, some of which involve U.S. companies being 
defrauded of millions of dollars.  The most common problems 
result from the use of stolen credit card numbers for the 
purchase of goods on-line.  An e-commerce law that defines 
and punishes cyber crime was passed in June 2002 and came 
into force in early July 2002. 
 
Romanian hackers also have gained notoriety for hacking into 
U.S. companies\' servers and stealing proprietary 
information, including customer credit card data.  There 
have been cases where Romanian hackers have offered to sell 
the U.S. company the means by which they hacked the 
company\'s server.  On other occasions, the hackers have 
threatened to release the sensitive data or the means to 
hack the system unless a specific amount of money is paid. 
Several recent investigations into and arrests of cyber- 
crime by Romanian authorities may serve as a deterrent to 
new hackers.

L.  Bilateral Investment Agreements 
----------------------------------- 
 
The U.S.-Romanian Treaty on the reciprocal encouragement 
and protection of investment (signed May 1992, ratified 
by the U.S. in 1994) guarantees national treatment for 
U.S. and Romanian investors.  It provides a workable 
dispute resolution mechanism, liberal capital transfer, 
prompt and adequate compensation in the event of an 
expropriation, and avoidance of trade-distorting 
performance requirements. 
 
In response to EU pressure on acceding countries to 
abrogate their bilateral investment treaties (BITS) with 
the U.S., the U.S. government negotiated an agreement 
with the EU and eight accession countries, including 
Romania, to cover any possible inconsistencies between 
the BITs and the countries\' future EU obligations. 
After two years of negotiations, the U.S. and EC signed 
a political understanding in Brussels that preserved, in 
slightly amended form, bilateral investment treaties 
with the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Poland, the Slovak Republic, Romania, and Bulgaria.  All 
eight revised BITS went to the U.S. Senate for 
ratification as a package.  The Senate ratified the new 
treaties in May 2004.  Romania\'s Parliament is expected 
soon to ratify the revised BIT, which will only take 
effect when Romania becomes an EU member. 
 
Romania also has concluded bilateral investment 
protection agreements or treaties with the following 
countries: Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Armenia, 
Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, 
Luxembourg, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, 
China, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, 
Egypt, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, 
Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, 
Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Moldova, 
Mauritania, Mongolia, Morocco, Nigeria, Norway, 
Netherlands, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Russia, Senegal, Singapore, 
Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, 
Sudan, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, 
Ukraine, United Kingdom, USA, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, 
Yugoslavia.

M.  OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) began 
operation in Romania in late 1992, following the signing 
of an investment incentive agreement in June 1992. 
 
Romania has been a member of the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) since 1992. 
 
--------- 
N.  Labor 
--------- 
 
Romania offers a large skilled labor force at 
comparatively low wage rates in most sectors.  The 
university system is regarded as high quality, 
particularly in technical fields.  Romanian craftsmen, 
engineers, and software designers win kudos for quality 
work from foreign managers.  With appropriate on-the-job 
training, local labor performs well with new 
technologies and more exacting quality requirements. 
However, there continues to be a shortage of western- 
trained managers. 
 
Since the revolution of December 1989, labor-management 
relations have occasionally been tense as a result of 
economic restructuring efforts and personnel layoffs. 
In mid-2003, unemployment officially stood at 7.8 
percent of the country\'s active labor-force.  Trade 
unions are vocal defenders of their prerogatives.  The 
government adheres to the ILO convention protecting 
worker rights. 
 
Many of the remaining state enterprises maintain that 
the first priority for an enterprise is to preserve jobs 
rather than turn a profit.  Individual dismissals for 
poor performance must be carefully documented and are 
subject to legal challenge by the affected employee. 
The new Labor Code passed in 2003 makes it even harder 
for employers to dismiss employees for poor performance, 
and requires the employer to provide three options to 
transfer positions within the company before actual 
termination of employment.  Foreign investors often 
encounter labor problems when they try to trim staff in 
loss-making product lines. 
 
Current law makes it very costly to locate expatriate 
staff in Romania.  Foreign companies often resort to 
expensive staff rotations, special consulting contracts, 
and non-cash benefits.  As a rule, work permits are 
issued for a period of six months for a fee of $200, and 
may be renewed for subsequent six-month periods at $100 
per renewal. 
 
-------------------- 
O.  Free Trade Zones 
-------------------- 
 
Free Trade Zones (FTZs) operate under Law No. 84/1992, 
amended in 2002 and 2004.  General provisions include 
unrestricted entry and re-export of goods, and an exemption 
from customs duties.  The law further permits the leasing or 
transfer of buildings or lands for terms of up to 50 years 
to corporations or natural persons, Romanian and non- 
Romanian. 
 
Currently, there are six FTZs: Sulina (located at the mouth 
of the Danube); Constanta-Sud Agigea (located close to the 
port of Constanta, at the entrance to the Black Sea-Danube 
Canal); Galati (located about 100 km from the Danube mouth); 
Braila (located 30 km up the Danube from Galati); Curtici- 
Arad (located about 30 km from the border with Hungary); and 
Giurgiu (located on the Danube, 60 km south of Bucharest) 
 
The Administrator of each FTZ is responsible for all 
commercial activities performed within the zone.  FTZs are 
under the authority of the Ministry of Transportation, 
Construction, and Tourism. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
P.  Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
---------------------------------------- 
 
Despite some substantial gains in recent years, direct 
investment flows into Romania have remained relatively low 
compared to other countries in the region.  According to 
data provided by the Romanian Trade Registry, cumulative 
foreign direct investment for the period between 1990-2003 
totaled $10.4 billion, of which $1.42 billion represents 
2003 inflows.

SUBJECT: ADOPTIONS 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1. On December 30, Consul General paid a final call on 
Gabriela Coman, outgoing Secretary of State at the National 
Authority for Child Protection and Adoptions (NACPA). Coman 
reported her discussions with the European Commission 
regarding a proposed commission on Romanian-origin 
international adoptions.  There has been little movement on 
the issue and it will depend on the new Romanian government 
whether the concept moves forward. 
 
2. Coman explained the reorganization of Romania\'s adoption 
and child welfare agencies under the new adoption law that 
takes effect on January 1.  As of that date, all domestic 
and international adoptions will be handled by the new 
Romanian Office for Adoptions (Oficiu Roman pentru Adoptii) 
in the General Secretariat of the Government.  The new law 
will not/not increase the likelihood that children formerly 
identified for inter-country adoption would be reassigned 
for domestic adoption, Coman said. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
COMAN LEAVES OFFICE 
------------------- 
3. On December 30, Consul General paid a final call on 
Gabriela Coman, Secretary of State for the National 
Authority for Child Protection and Adoptions (NACPA). Coman 
was a political appointee under the previous government, and 
will depart office the week of January 3.  As an outgoing 
official she could not speak with authority regarding the 
plans and intentions of the new government, but she provided 
useful details on discussions regarding a proposed 
commission to review international adoptions pending here, 
and on the reorganization of Romania\'s adoption and child 
welfare agencies. 
 
IMPACT OF NEW LAW ON MATCHES WITH U.S. FAMILIES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4. CG conveyed to Coman concerns, expressed by U.S. families 
with pending adoption cases, that after January 1 the new 
law virtually banning inter-country adoptions will prompt 
the GOR to revoke the matches it had made between those 
families and specific Romanian orphans and abandoned 
children, directing them instead towards domestic adoption. 
CG cited a recent report from the Greek Embassy here that 
this had happened in the case of a Greek couple seeking to 
adopt a Romanian child.  Coman said that there would be no 
change due to the new law. She explained that it has always 
been explicit that a Romanian court could, up to the last 
minute, direct domestic adoption for a child who previously 
had been matched for international adoption. Of the 
approximately one thousand cases of inter-country adoption 
out of Romania processed in the last four years, she said, 
this had happened in fifteen cases, of which one was 
American. 
 
PROPOSED INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON ADOPTIONS FROM ROMANIA 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
5. Coman reported there had been little progress towards 
establishment of an international commission to consider the 
disposition of pending applications by foreigners to adopt 
Romanian children, since former Prime Minister Nastase and 
French PM Raffarin proposed the commission October 18. 
Coman said she discussed the concept with European 
Commission officials in Brussels November 28-29, at the time 
the European Union (EU) voted to accept the EU Rapporteur\'s 
report on Romanian accession to the EU.  Those discussions 
were in accordance with PM Nastase\'s statement on October 18 
that any commission would have to be established in 
consultation with the EU. Coman highlighted the fact that 
the EU approved the Rapporteur\'s report including an 
amendment by Spain that endorsed the establishment of such a 
commission. 
 
6. In her EC discussions, Coman reported, nothing was set in 
place but various options were considered, including 
possible involvement in the commission of EU experts who had 
advised Romania on the drafting of the June law virtually 
banning international adoptions. It was left open whether 
the commission would be limited to setting parameters for 
which types of cases could be considered for processing to 
conclusion, or would be authorized to have access to and 
make decisions on individual cases. Coman favored the former 
model, but said the new Secretary of State of the ROA would 
have to pick which approach to recommend. 
 
REORGANIZATION 
-------------- 
7. Coman explained that, in compliance with the new law on 
adoptions passed in June 2004, as of January 1, 2005 NACPA 
will be divided into two entities. This organizational 
change will not, in itself, change policy on the processing 
of adoptions.  The Romanian Office of Adoptions (ROA) will 
be created within the General Secretariat of the Government 
and be responsible for all domestic and international 
adoption issues.  The National Authority for Protection of 
Children\'s Rights (NAPCR) will be within the Ministry of 
Labor, Social Solidarity and Family, as was the NACPA, and 
be responsible for general child welfare. 
 
8. The Romanian Committee for Adoption will cease operation 
on January 1.  At the local level, the Child Protection 
Departments are being combined with the Social Assistance 
Service into General Directorates for Child Protection and 
Social Assistance. 
 
THE NEW ROMANIAN OFFICE FOR ADOPTIONS 
------------------------------------- 
9. Establishing and launching the work of the ROA should 
take several weeks, Coman predicted.  Between January 1-10, 
the new Secretary General of the Government, Mihai VOIBU, is 
expected to name a Secretary of State to run the ROA.  So 
far, no location has been identified for the ROA.  Selection 
of staff will await the selection of the Secretary of State, 
who may choose some staff from among those at NACPA, or not. 
Physical files for adoptions will move from NACPA to the 
ROA\'s eventual facility. ROA may work out of NACPA for an 
initial period. Its budget will come from the General 
Secretariat of the Government. Coman predicted the ROA would 
 
SIPDIS 
enjoy greater autonomy than had the NACPA, by virtue of 
being out from under a Ministry and by being 
bureaucratically closer to the Prime Minister\'s office. 
 
BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION 
------------------------ 
10. Coman said she does not yet know what her next job will 
be. She expressed hope and concern that any interruptions in 
government services due to the long process of electing and 
changing the government would not have a negative impact on 
social service clients. 
 
11. Coman said the new General Secretary of the Government, 
Mihai VOIBU, was a young man not known to have a background 
on adoptions or social welfare issues, but rather was an 
official of the National Liberal Party (PNL).

UNGUREANU AND DEFENSE MINISTER ATANASIU 
 
REF: A. STATE 187 (AND PREVIOUS) 
 
     B. 04 BUCHAREST 3551 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jack Dyer Crouch II for Reasons 1.4 B and D 
 
1. (C) Summary.  The Ambassador January 3-4 made introductory 
calls on new Foreign Minister Razvan Ungureanu and new 
Defense Minister Teodor Atanasiu. Echoing a prominent theme 
in President Traian Basescu\'s electoral campaign, both 
incoming ministers expressed a firm commitment to a strong 
relationship with the U.S.  Ungureanu described the 
center-right governing coalition as \"heterogeneous,\" but 
expected the current cabinet to remain for at least 18 
months.  Atanasiu said the GOR would need to examine whether 
to \"increase or decrease\" its overseas deployments, including 
in Iraq and Afghanistan.  On the specific issue of UN Force 
Protection in Iraq, Atanasiu stated that an infantry company 
is \"ready\" for deployment but that UN funds available for 
salary support are insufficient; he promised to provide soon 
detailed information about Romanian needs for salary support 
(Refs) End Summary. 
 
2.  (C) Following the December 28 parliamentary confirmation 
of Romania\'s new government, the Ambassador met January 3-4 
with Foreign Minister Mihai Razvan Ungureanu and Defense 
Minister Teodor Atanasiu.  Both ministers noted they were 
still becoming acclimated to their new positions.  Both also 
said that over the next two weeks they would be preoccupied 
with filling key slots at the sub-ministerial level to ensure 
the presence of \"strong staffs\" they felt confident would 
support the new government\'s direction. 
 
FM Ungureanu:  \"Washington-London-Bucharest\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
3. (C) FM Ungureanu emphasized to the Ambassador in his 
January 3 meeting that President Basescu and the new PNL-PD 
led government placed strong ties with Washington at the top 
of Romania\'s foreign policy priorities.  Ungureanu noted that 
while Basescu had spoken frequently of a 
\"Washington-London-Bucharest axis\" throughout the 
presidential campaign, the inclusion of \"London\" was intended 
primarily to present a balanced approach to the EU. 
Ungureanu said the U.S. would find in him, personally, a very 
frank and open interlocutor.  He expressed that his previous 
experience as a State Secretary at the MFA during the 
1996-2000 center-right government and his previous experience 
with the Stability Pact had prepared him well for his new 
job. 
 
Politics of the Coalition 
------------------------- 
4. (C) Ungureanu also provided insight on the political 
mechanics of the new government, characterizing the governing 
coalition as \"heterogeneous\" but assessing that the current 
cabinet would remain \"untouched\" for at least 18 months.  He 
boiled it down to the fact that few MPs want new elections. 
He similarly described what he called the new core foreign 
policy team -- himself, PM Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, and 
Presidential Counselor Andrei Plesu -- as a melting pot. 
\"Plesu is German trained; Tariceanu is French trained; and I 
am British trained,\" but, he reiterated, one common 
denominator was their \"commitment to strong relationship with 
U.S.\"   The Ambassador asked about the role of the three new 
Ministers of State, de facto Vice Premiers, in this 
government.  Ungureanu said that while each had been assigned 
broad portfolios and ostensibly would be responsible for sets 
of ministries, in reality their positions were largely for a 
political purpose:  to tie together the coalition.  The PM is 
from the National Liberal Party; and the Ministers of State 
come from the ethnic Hungarian (UDMR), Humanist (PUR), and 
Democratic (PD) parties.  All four would be able to carry the 
government\'s program back to the parliament and ensure 
support. 
 
5. (C) The Ambassador asked Ungureanu how he predicted the 
Social Democratic Party (PSD) would behave in opposition. 
Ungureanu agreed the PSD would likely be tough but he had 
\"few doubts\" there would be any major differences over 
foreign policy: \"We both want good relations with the U.S. 
and EU accession in 2007.\"  He said that this was despite the 
fact that the government does not have a majority on either 
of the foreign affairs committees in the Parliament. 
Ungureanu said the PSD would likely pick its differences over 
social or economic policies, notably health care or aspects 
of economic liberalization. 
 
Moldova, Ukraine, Russia 
------------------------ 
6. (C) On politics in the region, Ungureanu opined that 
Moldova \"could become a problem.\"  Romania would be watching 
March elections closely.  Ungureanu said President Basescu 
had spoken with Ukrainian President-elect Yushchenko and that 
he, himself, knows many in Yushchenko\'s inner-circle.  He 
expressed a \"bit of worry\" that possible PM Iulia Tymoshenko 
could make relations difficult -- leaders may continue to use 
issues with Romania like the Bystroe Canal and Snake Island 
to rouse nationalist sentiments.  The Ambassador stressed 
that Romania should seek to focus relations on cooperation. 
Ungureanu agreed, but qualifying that Romania could not 
\"leave room\" for unwarranted concessions.  He said the new 
Romanian government realizes the potential for Romania, on 
eastern edge of the EU and NATO, to play a role building 
possible bridges with Kiev and even Moscow.  However, with 
regard to Russia, Ungureanu said he was \"personally\" 
concerned about Russian intentions inside and outside its 
borders, asserting that \"few in power there are truly 
interested in reform.\" 
 
7. (C) Ungureanu said Romania was eagerly awaiting a decision 
on possible U.S. military basing in Romania.  \"An 
announcement could not come too soon.\"  He saw \"absolutely no 
difference\" on the positions of the previous government or 
the new one on \"this fundamental issue.\" 
 
Defmin Atanasiu: A Strong Strategic Partnership 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
8. (C) Ambassador met with Defense Minister Teodor Atanasiu 
January 4 in his office at the Defense Ministry.  Speaking 
through an interpreter, Atanasiu began the meeting by 
observing that President Traian Basescu and PM Calin Popescu 
Tariceanu have both stressed the importance of \"strengthening 
the U.S.-Romanian strategic partnership.\"  Atanasiu stated 
that the Romanian \"military will play a key role\" in this 
process, noting that \"our intention and goal is to build an 
all-volunteer, professional armed forces by 2007.\" 
Ambassador expressed support for Romania\'s ongoing defense 
reform and stated that he and his team are working hard to 
assure that cooperation between the U.S. and Romania remains 
solid. 
 
9. (C) Atanasiu observed that Romania will \"continue 
cooperation with the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq and 
the Balkans.\"  He stated that discussions over the next 
several months should examine how Romania should proceed in 
regard to its overseas deployments.  Romania must decide 
whether to  \"increase or decrease\" its overseas deployments 
and also needs to explore which \"partnership forums should be 
developed.\"  (Note: Mihaela Matei, the head of the MOD\'s 
Strategic Affairs Directorate, told DATT in an earlier 
meeting that press reports had misquoted Atanasiu and 
erroneously quoted him as stating that when the mandate 
of Romanian troops in Afghanistan and Iraq expires in Summer 
2005, he would prefer to send only specialized intelligence 
units (Ref B).  Matei explained that Atanasiu had meant to 
express that the GOR would explore with the U.S. the 
appropriate \"mix\" of forces deployed so that Romania\'s 
resources, including intelligence units, could be best 
employed.  End Note.) 
 
UN Force Protection in Iraq 
--------------------------- 
10. (C) On the subject of the Romanian offer of one infantry 
company for UN force protection in Iraq (Refs), Atanasiu 
observed that the company is \"ready\" but that the GOR does 
not have \"budget allocations\" for 2005 to sustain salary 
costs for the company during an overseas deployment. 
Further, UN funds for salary allocations \"provide about half, 
or less\" than Romanian law requires for salary support for 
overseas deployments of this nature.  He promised to provide 
an \"exact calculus\" soon of the funds GOR needs to cover 
salary costs.  Ambassador observed that it would be difficult 
for the UN to pay more for salary support for Romanian troops 
than for troops from other nations, also noting that U.S. law 
forbids payment of salaries to foreign troops.  (Note: Post 
will report Septel when it receives the MOD\'s \"exact 
calculus.\"  End Note.) 
 
The Black Sea and regional security 
----------------------------------- 
11. (C) In general terms, Atanasiu observed that the Black 
Sea region and Caucasus region are of key strategic 
importance for both Romania and the U.S.  Ambassador stated 
that the U.S. shares the GOR\'s goal of enhancing Black Sea 
security, underscoring the importance of initially focusing 
on concrete projects rather than prematurely attempting to 
address grand regional themes.  Ambassador also stressed 
strong U.S. support for the development of democratic 
institutions in Ukraine and Moldova, observing that Romania - 
and NATO - can play a role in this process. 
 
12. (C) Atanasiu said he would like to meet again with the 
Ambassador in early February, stating also that he hopes to 
visit the U.S. in the latter half of 2005 \"once he has 
learned his brief.\"  Ambassador stated that when the visit 
dates have been set he would help arrange meetings with 
Secretary Rumsfeld and other appropriate interlocutors. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
13.  (C) Comment:  Both ministers were stark contrasts to 
their predecessors.  The straight-speaking and understated 
Ungureanu differed remarkably from former FM Geoana.  In 
contrast to ebullient ex-DefMin Pascu, who conducted his 
meetings with Embassy interlocutors in fluent, idiomatic 
English and encouraged a \"give and take\" exchange of 
information, Atanasiu proceeded cautiously and spoke through 
a translator (although his curriculum vitae describes him as 
an English speaker).  Atanasiu\'s approach may reflect the 
fact that he is still getting his sea legs: Although Atanasiu 
has been a longstanding leader of the National Liberal Party 
(PNL) in Transylvania, he possesses scant prior experience in 
central government and only limited background in the defense 
sector, having managed an arms factory for several years.

SUBJECT: ROMANIA: 2004-2005 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL 
STRAGEGY REPORT (INCSR), SECTION II, FINANCIAL CRIMES AND 
MONEY LAUNDERING 
 
REF: STATE 254401 
 
This report provides Embassy Bucharest\'s input for the 
International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, Part II, 
Financial Crimes and Money Laundering. 
 
I. Summary 
---------- 
Romania\'s   geographic location makes it a natural transit 
country for trafficking in narcotics, arms, stolen vehicles, 
and persons and, therefore, vulnerable to financial crimes. 
Romania\'s National Bank estimates the dollar amount of 
financial crimes to be between $1 - 1.5 billion per year. 
Tax evasion/VAT fraud constitutes about 45% ($500 - $600 
million per year) of this total.  Fraud in the financial- 
banking sector, fraudulent bankruptcy and smuggling are 
other principal financial crimes.  Romania also has one of 
the highest occurrences of online credit card fraud in the 
world.  As in several other countries in Eastern Europe, 
corruption and the presence of organized crime activity 
facilitate financial crimes.  Legislation and regulation 
designed to combat financial crime are of recent enactment 
and are fairly comprehensive.  Nevertheless, implementation 
lags, while reporting and investigations are not as timely 
or as effective as desired. 
 
II. Status of the Country 
------------------------- 
Money laundering results primarily from domestic criminal 
activity carried out by international crime syndicates, 
which often launder money through limited liability 
companies set up for this purpose.  The U.S. dollar is the 
preferred currency.  Endemic corruption in Romania and its 
neighboring countries abets money laundering.  The proceeds 
from the smuggling of cigarettes, alcohol, coffee, and other 
dutiable commodities are also laundered in Romania.  From 
Romania, most of the laundered funds go to off shore 
financial \"shelters\" in locations such as the Virgin 
Islands, Cayman Islands and Cyprus. 
 
III.  Actions Against Money Laundering 
-------------------------------------- 
Romania criminalized money laundering with the adoption of 
Law No. 21/99 \"On the Prevention and Punishment of Money 
Laundering\" in January 1999.  The law requires customer 
identification, record keeping, reporting transactions of a 
suspicious or unusual nature and reporting of all 
transactions over 10,000 euros.  The National Office for the 
Prevention and Control of Money Laundering (NOPCML), a 
financial intelligence unit (FIU) was established under the 
law, which mandated internal anti-money laundering 
procedures and training for all domestic financial 
institutions.  Entities subject to money laundering controls 
include banks, non-bank financial institutions, attorneys, 
accountants, and notaries, although in practice, these 
controls have not been as rigorous as those imposed on 
banks. 
 
The National Bank of Romania introduced Norm No. 3, \"Know 
Your Customer,\" in February 2002.  The \"Know-Your-Customer\" 
norm was amended in December 2003 to strengthen information 
disclosure for external wire transfers and correspondent 
banking, in keeping with new international standards.  Banks 
must include information about the originator\'s name, 
address and account in the wire transfer and to request the 
same information in case of incoming wires.  Banks are 
further required to take proper due diligence before 
entering into international correspondent relations and are 
prohibited from  opening correspondent accounts with shell 
banks. 
 
In December 2002, Law no. 656/2002 on the Prevention and 
Sanctioning of Money Laundering went into effect, changing 
the list of predicate offenses to the \"all-crimes\" approach 
and requiring that every cash operation and every external 
wire transfer involving a sum exceeding 10,000 euros be 
reported to the NOPCML and monitored.  In addition, the new 
law expands the number and types of entities required to 
report to the NOPCML.  Some of these new entities include 
art dealers, travel agents, privatization agents, postal 
officials, money transferors, and real estate agents. 
Training for these entities is necessary to ensure 
compliance with reporting, record keeping, recognition of 
suspicious transactions and development of internal 
controls. 
 
The new law also provides for both suspicious transaction 
reports (STRs) and currency transaction reports (CTR), with 
the CTR amounts conforming to European Union (EU) standards. 
The know your customer identification requirements have been 
honed so that identification of the client becomes necessary 
upon both the beginning of a relationship and upon single or 
multiple transactions meeting or approaching a 10,000 euro 
standard. 
 
The NOPCML receives and evaluates STRs as well as CTRs.  The 
law also provides for feedback to be given, upon request, to 
NOPCML from the General Prosecutor\'s Office, and for NOPCML 
to participate in inspections and controls in conjunction 
with supervisory authorities.  In 2003, the number of STR\'s 
increased to 882 and 1,241 reports were filed during the 
first three quarters of 2004.  Out of the 1,241 suspicious 
transaction reports received by the NOPCML, 1,134 were filed 
by reporting entities and 107 by the supervision 
institutions.  However, efforts to prosecute these cases 
have been hampered by delays in reporting suspicious 
transactions, by a lack of resources in some regions, and by 
insufficient training in conducting complex historical 
financial investigations.  The Law on the Prevention and 
Sanctioning of Money Laundering increased the powers of 
NOPCML, but it did not provide for an increase in 
administrative capacity. 
 
NOPCML has begun a process of international cooperation to 
exchange information with other FIUs.  In November 2004, the 
Department of Justice\'s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
Assistance and Training sponsored an assessment of the 
NOPCML by U.S. FINCEN and a future technical assistance 
project between the two FIUs is planned for 2005.  NOPCML 
also has been working closely with Italy to improve its 
efficiency and effectiveness through an EU PHARE project. 
 
A US Treasury OTA advisor is assisting the National Bank of 
Romania in strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and 
anti-terrorist financing through the introduction of 
improved bank examination procedures.  To insure that 
compliance is consistent across financial sectors, the 
advisor in cooperation with the World Bank has also assisted 
in strengthening AML compliance in the securities sector, 
including the drafting of new AML regulations for the 
National Securities Commission.  Plans are underway to 
replicate the project in the insurance industry. 
 
Romanian law has some, but limited, provisions for asset 
forfeiture in the Law on Combating Corruption, No. 78/2000, 
and the Law on Combating Tax Evasion, No. 87/1994.  The 
Directorate of Economic and Financial Crimes of the national 
police also has a mandate to pursue money laundering. 
Despite hundreds of money laundering cases investigated 
since 2001, the interface with the justice system remains 
ineffective. 
 
On November 24, 2204, the GOR approved a draft amendment to 
the Anti-money laundering law, which is expected to be 
passed in 2005.  The new law provides for a uniform approach 
to combating and the prevention of money laundering and 
terrorist financing.  The purpose of the law is to achieve 
the standard contained in European Union Directive 
2001/97/EC.  The draft law provides that money laundering 
and terrorist financing will be regulated under the same law 
to ensure consistent and effective measures against these 
crimes. 
 
The draft recommends the inclusion of additional categories 
of individuals and institutions with reporting obligations 
to the NOPCML.  These obligations include not only reports 
on specific suspicious transactions, but also generalized 
intelligence involving financial patterns and typologies. 
Among investigative innovations, the new law will provide 
for better seizure proceedings, the employment of undercover 
investigators and the surveillance of financial accounts and 
communications. 
 
The GOR announced a national anti-corruption plan in early 
2003 and passed a law against organized crime, codifying the 
provisions of the UN Convention in January 2003, as well as 
a new anti-corruption law in April 2003.  In the thirteen 
months since the September 2002 founding of the Anti- 
Corruption Prosecutor\'s Office (PNA), over 2200 cases of 
corruption have been investigated. Unfortunately, 
prosecutors have focused on low to mid-level officials and 
examples of the most egregious financial crimes have so far 
escaped serious attention.   A new Criminal Procedure Code 
was passed and became effective on July 1, 2003.  The new 
Code contains provisions for authorizing wiretapping, 
intercepting, and recording telephone calls for up to 30 
days, in certain circumstances.  These circumstances, as 
provided for within the new Code, include terrorism acts and 
money laundering. 
 
IV.  Actions to Combat Terrorist Financing 
------------------------------------------ 
Romania\'s political leadership has consistently and 
unequivocally condemned acts of terrorism.  After the events 
of September 11, 2001, Romania passed a number of 
legislative measures designed to sanction acts contributing 
to terrorism.  Emergency Ordinance 141, passed in October 
2001, legislates that the taking of measures, or the 
production or acquisition of means or instruments with an 
intention to commit terrorist acts, are offenses of the same 
level as terrorist acts.  These offenses are punishable with 
imprisonment ranging from five to 20 years. 
 
The Romanian Government and the National Bank of Romania 
(BNR) in particular have been fully cooperative in seeking 
to identify and freeze terrorist assets.  Emergency 
Ordinance 159/2001 established guidelines to prevent the use 
of the financial and banking system for the purpose of 
financing terrorist acts.  The BNR, which oversees all 
banking operations in the country, issued Norm No. 5 in 
support of Emergency Ordinance 159.  Emergency Ordinance 153 
was passed to strengthen the government\'s ability to carry 
out the obligations under UNSCR 1373/2001, including the 
identification, freezing and seizure of terrorist funds or 
assets.  The BNR receives lists of individuals and terrorist 
organizations from the U.S. Embassy Bucharest, UN Sanctions 
Committee, and the EU and circulates these to banks and 
financial institutions.  The new law on terrorism (Law no. 
535/2004) provides that the assets used or provided to 
terrorist entities will be forfeited, together with finances 
resulting from terrorist activity.  To date, in regard to 
terrorist financing, no arrests, seizures, or prosecutions 
have been carried out. 
 
In April 2002, the GOR\'s Supreme Defense Council of the 
Country (CSAT) adopted a National Security Strategy, which 
included a General Protocol on the Organization and 
Functioning of the National System on Preventing and 
Combating of Terrorist Acts.  This system, effective July 
2002 and coordinated through the Intelligence Service, 
brings together and coordinates a multitude of agencies, 
including 14 ministries, the General Prosecutor Office, the 
National Bank, and the National Office for the Prevention 
and Control of Money Laundering.  The GOR has also set up an 
interministerial committee to investigate the potential use 
of the Romanian financial system by terrorist organizations. 
 
In November 2004, the Parliament adopted Law 535/2004 on 
preventing and combating terrorism, which abrogated some of 
the previous government ordinances and took over most of 
their provisions.  The law includes a chapter on combating 
the financing of terrorism by prohibiting financial and 
banking transactions with persons included on international 
terrorist lists and requiring authorization for transactions 
conducted with entities suspected of terrorist activities in 
Romania. 
 
The GOR recognizes the link between organized crime and 
terrorism.  Bucharest is the site of the Southeast European 
Cooperation Initiative, a regional center that provides law 
enforcement training and intelligence sharing on criminal 
activities, including terrorism, for several Balkan 
governments. 
 
Romania participates in a number of regional initiatives to 
combat terrorism.  Romania has worked within SEEGROUP (a 
working body of the NATO Initiative for Southeast Europe) to 
coordinate anti-terrorist measures undertaken by the states 
of Southeastern Europe.  The Romanian and Bulgarian Interior 
Ministers signed an intergovernmental agreement in July 2002 
to cooperate in the fight against organized crime, drug 
smuggling and terrorism. 
 
V. Other International Agreements 
--------------------------------- 
The EU\'s Europe Agreement with Romania provides for 
cooperation in the fight against drug abuse and money 
laundering.  Romania is a member of the Council of Europe 
(COE) and participates in the Council of Europe\'s Select 
Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money 
Laundering Measures (MONEYVAL).  A mutual evaluation in 
April 1999 by that Committee uncovered a number of areas of 
concern, including the high evidence standard required for 
reporting suspicious transactions, a potential conflict with 
the bank secrecy legislation, and the lack of provisions for 
cases in which the reporting provisions are intentionally 
ignored.  Romania has been working to address these 
concerns, bringing in legal experts from the EU to consult. 
In late 2003, Romania also underwent a Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) by the World Bank as part of that 
organization\'s pilot program. 
 
The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty signed in 2001 between 
the United States and Romania entered into force in October 
2001.  Romania has participated in regional and global anti- 
crime efforts.  Romania is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention, the Agreement on Cooperation to Prevent and 
Combat Transborder Crime, and the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime.  With Law No. 263/2002, 
passed in 2002, Romania ratified the Council of Europe 
Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure, and Confiscation 
of the Proceeds from Crime.  During 2002, Romania also 
ratified the Council of Europe\'s Criminal Law Convention on 
Corruption, and in December signed the UN Convention Against 
Corruption.  Romania ratified the UN International 
Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism 
in January 2003. 
 
VI.  Country Vulnerabilities 
---------------------------- 
Romania should continue addressing the concerns of the 
Council of Europe evaluators by making further improvements 
in its anti-money laundering regime, and by continuing its 
progress on money laundering investigations and 
prosecutions.  The GOR needs to adopt procedures for the 
timely freezing, seizure and forfeiture of criminal or 
terrorist related assets.  Finally, the GOR must initiate 
reporting requirements for the cross-border movement of 
currency and monetary instruments. 
 
To assist the GOR, in November 2004, the Department of 
Justice\'s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Assistance and 
Training sponsored an assessment of NOPCML by U.S. FINCEN 
and a future technical assistance project between the two 
financial intelligence units is planned for 2005.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S MEETINGS WITH KEY ECONOMIC MINISTERS 
IN NEW GOVERNMENT 
 
REF: BUCHAREST 3293 
 
Classified By: ECONOMIC SECTION CHIEF JOHN R. RODGERS FOR REASONS 1.4 B 
 AND D 
 
1. (C) Summary: The Ambassador\'s first calls on new Romanian 
government ministers responsible for the economy reveal 
pro-business and pro-American attitudes.  They want to move 
ahead aggressively to change perceptions of Romania as a 
destination for foreign direct investment.  In particular, 
they intend to introduce more transparent procedures, root 
out corruption and pursue tax cheats.  Post assesses them as 
sincere and dynamic, but the government bureaucracy the 
previous government left behind will be difficult to motivate 
to make radical changes in the short term. Post will engage 
the new team to assist them and advance U.S. business and 
trade interests.  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador and Econ Chief met during the first week of 
January 2005, with three key Romanian government (GOR) 
economic ministers shortly after they took office. Minister 
for Economics and Commerce, Codrut Seres, Minister for 
Finance, Ionut Popescu; and State Minister for Economic 
Coordination, Adrian Videanu were all enthusiastic about 
making radical changes in how Romania does business and eager 
to work with the United States.  They also realize the 
hurdles and problems they have inherited in making the 
economy competitive and resilient as it enters the European 
Union in less than two years. 
 
The Young and the Restless 
-------------------------- 
3. (C) The ministers are young ) Videanu is 42, Seres is 35, 
and Popescu is 40 - and have significant exposure to Western 
business practices.  For example, Minister Videanu, a 
self-made millionaire, got his start in the marble business 
with a loan from the Romanian American Enterprise Fund and 
enthusiastically endorses American business practices and the 
culture of success in the U.S.  They are also extremely 
ambitious, planning to bring about change in a short amount 
of time.  Further, despite being from different parties in 
the governing coalition ) Videanu is from the Democratic 
Party (PD), Seres is from the Humanist Party (PUR) and 
Popescu is from the National Liberal Party (PNL), they all 
appear to speak (and truly understand) the same free market 
language. 
 
4. (C) They pointed to their coalition government,s swift 
introduction of a flat tax of 16 percent for corporate and 
personal income as a signal of their intention to re-shape 
the way Romania does business (Septel).  This is only their 
first step, they claim.  In addition, over the next 3 months 
Minister Videanu wants to modify the fiscal code, change the 
labor code, eliminate administrative barriers to companies, 
and criminalize tax evasion.  Minister Popescu also wants to 
use the nascent capital markets for more effective 
privatizations by selling state-owned shares in companies on 
the stock exchange. 
 
5. (C) The main objective of the legal changes the new 
government is pursuing is to attract greater volumes of much 
more foreign direct investment (FDI). Indeed, Romania lags 
significantly behind most other former communist countries in 
Central and Eastern Europe in per capita FDI inflows. 
 
Creating a Level Playing Field 
------------------------------- 
6. (C) In addition to legal changes, the new ministers also 
want to introduce a new climate of transparency and fairness 
in the way the GOR approaches improving the business climate. 
 The new government intends to create a more level playing 
field for competition and to treat foreign and domestic 
businesses equally under the law.  They also want to clamp 
down on the previous government,s penchant for granting tax 
relief to struggling enterprises or even bailing out bankrupt 
firms run by political cronies.  In this regard, they pointed 
to their government,s action to suspend the previous 
government,s decision to save a failed refinery (RAFO: see 
Ref B) run by politically well-connected &businessmen.8 
 
A Novel Approach: Go After the Crooks 
------------------------------------- 
7. (C) For all three ministers, another important element in 
creating a level playing field and improving the business 
climate is to attack the pervasive corruption in society. 
Each minister emphasized the importance of ensuring that the 
Justice Ministry is truly independent of political influence 
so that it can pursue criminal cases even against &the big 
fish.8  As Minister of Finance Popescu phrased it, the 
government wants to punish offenders, but &we would prefer 
to lose in court than to interfere in the justice process.8 
Ambassador,s Message:  We Can Help 
----------------------------------- 
8. (C) The Ambassador,s message to the ministers was that 
the United States will assist Romania with advice and 
cooperation to help Romania develop its economy even more 
rapidly.  In addition, he stated that many American firms 
want to do more business in Romania and will welcome the 
announced change of attitude to FDI. 
 
9. (C) The Ambassador also pointed out that some American 
exports to Romania are being hurt by tariffs that exceed 
those granted to EU countries and the USG wants to discuss 
this with the GOR.  This is linked with the lower tariffs 
Romania enjoys through the USG,s General System of 
Preferences (GSP).  Economic Minister Seres, confirmed that 
the Minister-Delegate for Trade, Iulius Winkler, had 
discussed this issue with him already.  Seres remarked that 
this is a delicate issue, since the EU wants Romania to 
maintain tariffs that give its companies an advantage over 
U.S. exports, but that the GOR is willing to discuss it to 
try to achieve a solution.  Minister Seres suggested 
convening a technical level discussion to explore approaches. 
 The Ambassador agreed, saying that the embassy would consult 
with USTR and Commerce. 
 
Comment: The Hard Part Has Just Started 
--------------------------------------- 
10. (C) The Embassy welcomes the forward-looking and 
market-oriented perspectives of the new set of economic 
ministers.  Nonetheless, the catch will be working with 
holdover bureaucracies less amenable to change than 
themselves.  In general, however, the embassy has a very 
favorable impression of the first steps of the new economic 
team in Romania and plans to engage intensively with the GOR 
to provide advice and assistance where appropriate.  Finally, 
the very pro-American stance of the new government even lends 
some hope to address the long-simmering GSP tariff issue.
