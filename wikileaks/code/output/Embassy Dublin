SUBJECT: TRIAL OF USMIL PLANE ATTACKERS: REQUEST FOR 
APPROVAL TO RELEASE DIPLOMATIC NOTE 
 
REF: 03 DUBLIN 824 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: DCM Jane B. Fort, reason 1.5 (d) 
 
 
1.   (U)  This is an urgent action request.  See Para 7. 
 
2.  ( C )  Embassy Dublin has received a request from the 
Irish Department of Foreign Affairs to release to the defense 
the text of a diplomatic note in the case of \"DPP v. Clancy 
(and others).\"  This case refers to the Irish Government,s 
prosecution of five individuals who are charged with 
illegally entered Shannon airport grounds on February 3, 
2003, vandalized a US Navy aircraft parked on the tarmac, and 
assaulted the Irish police officer guarding the plane. 
 
3.   ( C ) The defense, which is reportedly planning to argue 
that it committed the act in order to prevent the \"larger 
crime\" of allowing U.S. military aircraft to refuel at 
Shannon and fly to the Gulf in the build-up to the \"illegal\" 
Iraq war, has asked for the release of several documents from 
the GOI, including the text of the embassy,s diplomatic note 
of January 27, 2003 which requested clearance for the 
aircraft. 
 
4.   (C ) The defense has asked for the following information: 
 
a) the origin and intended destination of the aircraft 
b) the purpose of the journey 
c) the military  equipment and the equipment integral to it 
d) the cargo which the plane was carrying, including the 
personnel and the material and the military capabilities of 
all such items and persons 
 
5.   ( C )  Communications between the Embassy and the GOI 
are considered privileged, and are excluded from FOIA or 
other such requests.  In this instance, however, the 
Department of Foreign Affairs has asked that we reconsider 
withholding the document in order to help prosecute the case. 
 DFA officials tell us their legal counsel is concerned that 
failure to provide the document may enable the defense to 
claim insufficient \"discovery\" of material pertinent to their 
case, which may undermine the prosecution or even lead to the 
case being dismissed.  While we have informed DFA that the 
diplomatic note in question would not, in any event, address 
the question on cargo and personnel, DFA believes the 
information provided in the note would help the prosecution. 
 
6.    ( C )  While post is concerned about setting a 
precedent for the release of this information, we are equally 
concerned that the USG not be blamed for any unsuccessful 
prosecution of this case.  In addition to our desire to see 
the case prosecuted, we do not wish to potentially undermine 
our claim to compensation for the damage done to the 
aircraft.  We therefore recommend release of the January 2003 
under cover of a new diplomatic note which makes clear that 
this release is an exceptional case intended to support the 
prosecution.  (Note: We should also use this note to request 
confirmation of the date of the trial and request for 
official USG witnesses.) 
 
7.   (C )  ACTION REQUEST:   Department is asked to clear on 
the following proposed language.   The GOI has informed us it 
must respond to the defense on this issue NO LATER THAN MARCH 
16. 
 
8.   ( C )  BEGIN DRAFT TEXT OF COVER NOTE: 
 
The Embassy of the United States of America presents its 
compliments to the Department of Foreign Affairs and has the 
honor to refer to the attached correspondence from January 
27, 2003, in which the Embassy requested permission for a 
C-40 aircraft to land at Shannon Airport.   As requested by 
the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Embassy authorizes the 
release of the attached diplomatic note for the sole purpose 
of assisting the Government of Ireland in the prosecution of 
the case \"DPP v. Clancy (and others).\" 
 
The Embassy of the United States wishes to inform the 
Department of Foreign Affairs that the release of this note 
marks an exception to our policy of maintaining privilege on 
all correspondence between the Embassy and the Department of 
Foreign Affairs, and that, by the release of this note, the 
Embassy in no way waives its right to maintain privilege on 
all other correspondence, past or future, without written 
authorization. 
 
In addition, the Embassy of the United States requests 
confirmation of the date and location of the trial of the 
individuals charged with damaging the aircraft.  To 
facilitate the participation of the appropriate U.S. 
witnesses required for the trial, we also request 
confirmation of the names of the individuals the prosecution 
intends to call. 
The Embassy of the United States avails itself of the 
opportunity to renew to the Department of Foreign Affairs the 
assurances of its highest consideration. 
 
END DRAFT TEXT. 
 
9.   ( C )  BEGIN TEXT of January 27, 2003 Diplomatic Note:

REF: SECSTATE 108776 
 
1.  Ireland and UNDP have exchanged administration contracts 
for Ireland\'s one million Euro contribution to the 
International Reconstruction Trust Fund Facility for Iraq 
(IRGFFI).  In response to reftel demarche, Aine Hearns, 
Assistant Principal in the Development Cooperation 
Directorate, Rehabilitation Assistance office, told Poloff on 
May 17 that the GOI had tried to transfer the funds to UNDP 
already.  Something went wrong at the bank in New York and 
today they hope to sort it out. 
 
2.  Ireland earmarked the money for primary education 
programs run by UNICEF.  Hearns recalled that at the last 
donors conference, Ireland had mentioned a possible three 
million Euro contribution over three years.  She said Ireland 
would see how it went with the first million before 
committing further. 
 
3.  Hearns said that the Netherlands would represent the 
Presidency (as presidency sur place) at the meeting in Qatar 
May 25-26 and that the Commission would be there.  She added 
that she is fully briefed on Iraqi development issues since 
she serves as a member of the Iraqi Core Group, representing 
the EU Presidency.

REF: STATE 90316 
 
1.  Emboff, drawing on reftel points, on May 19 spoke to 
Assistant Principal Officer at the Department of Environment, 
Climate Change Division, Patrick O\'Sullivan.  O\'Sullivan 
stated that Ireland supports current EU thinking on 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCS) - containment and increased 
training in the handling of fluorinated gases and would not 
introduce language calling for a total ban.  However, he also 
said Ireland could support future tightening on HFCS 
regulations as long as they were economically and 
technologically feasible.  O\'Sullivan illustrated the point 
by noting that some companies already produce refrigerators 
and air conditioning equipment that do not use HFCS. 
 
2.  Regarding regulations involving domestic refrigeration 
and mobile air conditioning, O\'Sullivan said that Ireland 
follows EU regulations in lieu of a national policy.

1.  SUMMARY. DURING A MAY 19 DEBRIEF OF THE MAY 17-18 GAERC, 
IRISH EUROPEAN CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONMY AND IGC NEGOTIATOR 
BOB PATTERSON STRESSED THAT IRELAND REMAINS CONFIDENT OF 
SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATING THE NEW EU CONSTITUTION BY THE JUNE 
17-18 EUROPEAN COUNCIL.  THEY DISMISSED RECENT PESSIMISTIC 
MEDIA REPORTING AS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE BIGGER PICTURE OR 
THE CONTINUING POLITICAL WILL TO CLOSE THE DEAL. CONMY ALSO 
BRIEFLY REVIEWED GAERC CONCLUSIONS ON ESDP, WESTERN BALKANS, 
SUMMIT PREPARATIONS, MEPP AND IRAQ.  END SUMMARY. 
 
IGC DISCUSSIONS ON TRACK, ACCORDING TO THE IRISH 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  ON MAY 19 IRISH EUROPEAN CORRESPONDENT KEVIN CONMY AND 
IGC NEGOTIATOR BOB PATTERSON BRIEFED NON-EU AMBASSADORS ON 
THE RESULTS OF THE MAY 17-18 BRUSSELS GAERC/IGC, 
CONCENTRATING ON THE IGC NEGOTIATIONS.  IGC NEGOTIATOR BOB 
PATTERSON DESCRIBED THE TWO PAPERS PREPARED FOR THE 
GAERC/IGC, NOTING THAT ONE REPORT CONTAINED THOSE ITEMS ON 
WHICH THE IRISH FELT CONSENSUS HAD BEEN ACHIEVED, WHILE THE 
OTHER LAID OUT REMAINING INSTITUTIONAL AND NON-INSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED.  ON THESE LATTER ISSUES, HE NOTED 
GENERAL AGREEMENT ON A THREE-COUNTRY 18 MONTH PRESIDENCY 
ROTATION WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE CURRENT MODEL, BUT WOULD 
PROVIDE GREATER EFFICIENCY AND COORDINATION AND DESCRIBED THE 
DISCUSSION OF REMAINING ISSUES AS \"CONSTRUCTIVE\", 
PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE FUTURE 
COMMISSION.  PATTERSON NOTED THAT THE IRISH HAD PUT FORWARD A 
COMPROMISE PROPOSAL WHEREBY EACH COUNTRY WOULD RETAIN A 
REPRESENTATIVE ON THE COMMISSION UNTIL 2014, AT WHICH TIME 
ITS SIZE WOULD BE REDUCED.  MOST STATES ACCEPTED THE NEED TO 
REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE COMMISSION IN ORDER TO GAIN 
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND, ACCORDING TO PATTERSON, THE 
DISCUSSION CENTERED ON HOW MUCH OF A REDUCTION WAS NECESSARY 
WITH SOME SUPPORTING 15 MEMBERS, BENELUX PROPOSING 18, AND 
OTHERS SUGGESTING A FIXED RATIO OF TWO-THIRDS, WHATEVER THE 
FUTURE SIZE OF THE COMMISSION. 
 
3.  PATTERSON ANNOUNCED THAT A FURTHER MINISTERIAL IGC 
MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE MAY 24 WHERE THE FOCUS OF DISCUSSION 
WILL BE PRIMARILY ON THE SCOPE AND DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED 
MAJORITY VOTING (QMV).  REACTING TO AMBASSADORS\' QUESTIONS 
ABOUT PESSIMISTIC MEDIA REPORTS OF THE IGC MEETING, BOTH 
PATTERSON AND CONMY SUGGESTED THAT THE MEDIA WAS FOCUSING ON 
(AND EXAGGERATING) INDIVIDUAL CONCERNS OF MEMBER STATES AND 
DID NOT REFLECT THE CONTINUING POLITICAL WILL TO GET THE DEAL 
DONE WHICH THE IRISH STILL SEE REFLECTED IN THE IGC MEETINGS 
AND WHICH PRIME MINISTER AHERN WAS FINDING IN HIS TOUR OF 
CAPITALS. BOTH EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE ABOUT SUCCESS IN JUNE. 
 
COUNTER-TERRORISM FOLLOW-UP CONTINUING 
------------------------------------- 
 
4.  COMNY THEN REVIEWED THE GAERC CONCLUSIONS ON ESDP, 
WESTERN BALKANS, EU-RUSSIA AND EU-LATIN AMERICA SUMMIT 
PREPARATIONS, MEPP AND IRAQ.  HE NOTED THAT NATO SECRETARY 
GENERAL DE HOOP SCHEFFER ATTENDED THE MONDAY LUNCHEON WITH 
DEFENSE MINISTERS, EXPRESSED SATISFACTION WITH THE RESULTS OF 
THE MAY 4 QUARTET MEETING, AND PRAISED THE FACT THAT 
FOLLOW-UP ON THE EU\'S COUNTER-TERRORISM DECLARATION HAS BEGUN 
WITH EU MEMBERS REVIEWING THEIR CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE 
ASSISTANCE TO ANY VICTIM OF A TERRORIST ATTACK UNDER THE 
SOLIDARITY CLAUSE. 
 
BURMA - HARD ROAD AHEAD 
----------------------- 
 
5.  UNDER ANY OTHER BUSINESS, COMNY EXPRESSED DEEP 
DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE FAILURE OF BURMA TO RELEASE AUNG SAN 
SUU KYI OR MAKE ANY OTHER EXPECTED POSITIVE GESTURES AND SAID 
THAT A SPECIAL PRESIDENCY ENVOY (JOHN CAMPBELL) WOULD SOON 
BEGIN A TOUR OF ASEM COUNTRIES TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF BURMA 
AND ASEM ENLARGEMENT IN A MORE DIFFICULT ATMOSPHERE THAN HAD 
BEEN ANTICIPATED. 
 
6. COMNY ALSO NOTED THAT DENMARK AND SWEDEN HAD PROPOSED AN 
ITEM ON INTERNATIONAL RULE OF LAW AND THAT THE COMMISSION HAS 
BEEN ASKED TO CONSULT EU MEMBERS ON HOW BEST TO \"PROMOTE THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A RULES BASED INTERNATIONAL ORDER.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
DESPITE SOME QUITE OBVIOUS BUMPS IN THE ROAD, AS REFLECTED IN 
THE MEDIA REPORTING OF THE GAERC/IGC MEETING, THE IRISH HERE 
CONTINUE TO EXPRESS CONFIDENCE THAT THE DEAL WILL GET DONE, 
ECHOING IRISH FOREIGN MINISTER COWEN\'S PUBLIC COMMENTS 
FOLLOWING THE MEETING. THE ODDS ON SUCCESS MAY BE 
LENGTHENING, HOWEVER.

SUBJECT: EU-RUSSIA SUMMIT - ESTABLISHING A NEW FRAMEWORK 
FOR THE RELATIONSHIP 
 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES KENNY FOR REASONS 1.4 (c) AND (d) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  FOLLOWING THE EU\'S OWN ASSESSMENT OF 
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND THE APRIL 27 AGREEMENT ON THE 
EXTENSION OF THE PCA, DFA\'S RUSSIAN DIVISION HEAD, BARBARA 
JONES, IS HOPEFUL THAT THE MAY 21 EU-RUSSIAN SUMMIT WILL HELP 
ESTABLISH A MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR 
FUTURE EU-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, ALTHOUGH IF TODAY\'S (MAY 20) 
TRADE TALKS GO WELL IN BRUSSELS, THE HEADLINE OUT OF MOSCOW 
IS LIKELY TO BE ON RUSSIAN WTO MEMBERSHIP AND RELATED 
PROGRESS ON THE KYOTO ACCORD. 
 
2.  (C) THE AGENDA IS SHORT (OPENING STATEMENTS, COMMON 
SPACES, AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES OVER LUNCH, FOLLOWED BY A 
PRESS CONFERENCE) AND THERE WILL BE NO COMMUNIQUE, BUT THE EU 
WILL PUSH HARD FOR MORE POSITIVE RUSSIAN ENGAGEMENT IN 
MOLDOVA, AND GEORGIA, TELLING THE RUSSIANS THAT A PRODUCTIVE 
EU-RUSSIAN DIALOGUE SHOULD BEGIN \"IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.\" 
JONES EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE EXCELLENT U.S.-EU 
WORKING LEVEL COOPERATION DURING THE IRISH PRESIDENCY AND 
HOPED IT WOULD CONTINUE INTO THE DUTCH PRESIDENCY.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
NEW FRAMEWORK FOR THE RELATIONSHIP 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  EMBOFF CALLED ON BARBARA JONES, DFA DIRECTOR FOR 
EASTERN EUROPE, RUSSIA AND OSCE, MAY 19 FOR A PREVIEW OF THE 
MAY 21 EU-RUSSIAN SUMMIT.  JONES RECALLED THE EU\'S OWN 
SEVERAL MONTH LONG ASSESSMENT OF RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND 
THE APRIL 27 AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE PERMANENT COOPERATION 
AGREEMENT (PCA) AND SAID SHE HOPED THAT THE FORTHCOMING 
SUMMIT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO ESTABLISHING A NEW AND MORE 
PRODUCTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, BASED 
UPON THE EU-RUSSIA PERMANENT PARTNERSHIP COUNCIL (PPC), WHICH 
MET FOR THE FIRST TIME IN APRIL, AND THE EU ACTION PLANS 
RELATED TO THE FOUR COMMON SPACES ON ECONOMY; FREEDOM, 
SECURITY AND JUSTICE; EXTERNAL SECURITY; AND RESEARCH AND 
EDUCATION.  THE EU HANDED OVER ITS DRAFT PACKAGE AND ACTION 
PLANS FOR ALL FOUR COMMON SPACES TO THE RUSSIANS FOLLOWING 
THE APRIL AGREEMENT TO EXTEND THE PCA.  DESPITE THE SHORT 
TIME FRAME, THE EU IS HOPING THAT AT THE SUMMIT THE RUSSIANS 
WILL ENDORSE THE CONCEPT AND ACCEPT THE PACKAGE AS A BASIS 
FOR FUTURE DISCUSSION AND NEGOTIATION. 
 
4.  (C)  IF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS \"RIGHT\", JONES SAID THAT PRIME 
MINISTER AHERN MAY TRY TO OBTAIN PUTIN\'S AGREEMENT TO HOLD 
ONLY ONE EU-RUSSIAN SUMMIT PER ANNUM, RATHER THAN TWO, CITING 
THIS AS A FURTHER RATIONALIZATION OF THE INSTITUTIONAL 
RELATIONSHIP, ESPECIALLY SINCE FOREIGN MINISTERS WOULD NOW 
MEET TWICE A YEAR IN THE PPC. 
 
5.  (C)  ASKED ABOUT RUSSIAN REPRESENTATION TO THE EU, JONES 
SAID THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE FORMER RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
POLAND WOULD SOON BE NAMED AS RUSSIAN ENVOY TO THE EU. 
 
A SHORT, BUT BROAD AGENDA 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C)  ACCORDING TO JONES, PREPARATIONS FOR THE SUMMIT HAVE 
GONE EXCEEDINGLY WELL.  THE AGENDA CONSISTS OF OPENING 
STATEMENTS, DISCUSSION OF THE COMMON SPACE CONCEPT AND 
MATERIAL (WHICH PROVIDES A BROAD CANVAS FOR THE POINTS THE EU 
WISHES TO MAKE ON MOLDOVA, GEORGIA, AND CHECHNYA), AND 
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES (IRAQ, MEPP, WESTERN BALKANS, 
AFGHANISTAN AND CYPRUS), TO BE FOLLOWED BY A JOINT PRESS 
CONFERENCE.  THE EU SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A 
COMMUNIQUE SINCE TIME WAS BETTER USED DISCUSSING PRACTICAL 
ISSUES RATHER THAN IN DRAFTING.  (COMMENT: RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR 
TO DUBLIN RAKHMANIN TOLD AMBASSADOR MAY 19 THAT HE WAS NOT 
GOING TO MOSCOW FOR THE SUMMIT SINCE THE AGENDA WAS A SHORT 
ONE AND NO BILATERAL ISSUES WERE ON IT.) 
 
7.  (C) JONES SAID THE EU WILL PRESS HARD FOR MORE POSITIVE 
RUSSIAN ENGAGEMENT \"IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.\"  SHE NOTED THAT THE 
MAY 18 EU DEMARCHE IN MOSCOW URGING RUSSIAN SUPPORT FOR 
FIVE-SIDED TALKS ON MOLDOVA GOT NOWHERE, BUT THAT THE EU 
WOULD AGAIN RAISE THIS ISSUE DURING THE SUMMIT, SUGGESTING TO 
THE RUSSIANS THAT THE BEST PLACE TO BEGIN EU-RUSSIAN 
COOPERATION WOULD BE IN NEIGHBORING AREAS.  NO ONE EXPECTS 
ANY BREAKTHROUGHS, BUT THE EU WILL RESTATE THE CASE ON A WIDE 
VARIETY OF ISSUES, INCLUDING CHECHNYA, HUMAN RIGHTS AND NEED 
FOR A DEMOCRATIC OPEN RUSSIA.  THE EU WILL ALSO URGE RUSSIA 
TO NORMALIZE ITS BORDERS WITH THE BALTICS AND AGREE TO EXPAND 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE VARIOUS EXPORT CONTROL REGIMES TO INCLUDE 
THE NEW EU STATES.  JONES SAID SHE EXPECTED THE RUSSIANS WILL 
RESPOND BY RAISING MINORITY RIGHTS IN THE BALTICS AND 
RESTATING THEIR POLICY VIS-A-VIS EXPANDING EXPORT CONTROL 
REGIMES OF EXAMINING EACH REQUEST ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
 
BIG NEWS WILL BE WTO AND KYOTO, IF MAY 20 TALKS SUCCEED 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8. (5)  IF THE MAY 20 TRADE TALKS BETWEEN EU TRADE 
COMMISSIONER LAMY AND THE RUSSIANS ARE SUCCESSFUL (AND LAMY 
REPORTEDLY GAVE A VERY POSITIVE READ-OUT TO THE MAY 17 
GAERC), JONES FELT THE BIG HEADLINE OUT OF THE MOSCOW SUMMIT 
WOULD BE ON PROGESS TOWARD RUSSIAN WTO MEMBERSHIP AND RELATED 
(NOT LINKED) PROGRESS ON RUSSIAN SIGNATURE OF THE KYOTO 
ACCORD. 
 
U.S. - EU COOPERATION ON RUSSIA 
------------------------------- 
9. (C) CONCLUDING, JONES EXPRESSED HER APPRECIATION FOR THE 
EXCELLENT WORKING-LEVEL COOPERATION SHE HAS ENJOYED WITH HER 
U.S. COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON AND ELSEWHERE, WHICH SHE FOUND 
INVALUABLE, AND HOPED IT WOULD CONTINUE UNDER THE DUTCH 
PRESIDENCY.

1.  (SBU)  The EU-Latin American and Caribbean Summit 
convenes in Guadalajara, Mexico, May 27 - 29.  15 EU Heads of 
Government plan to attend a meeting the Irish hope will 
commit countries in the region to further social, economic 
and political development leading to expanded trade and 
better relations with the EU.  Irish-led negotiations in 
Brussels have produced a draft Summit Declaration they hope 
will focus the region\'s relationship with the EU more on the 
social, economic, and political goals laid out in the 
Monterrey Consensus.  Final stage Declaration negotiations 
move to Mexico next week in the run up to the Summit.  EU 
strategists hope to secure eventual Latin and Caribbean bloc 
voting support for EU positions at the UN.  End Summary.

occurs against the backdrop of ongoing EU/MERCOSUR trade 
negotiations on an association agreement that the EU still 
hopes to conclude by October this year.  The ambitions of the 
Central American and Andean regional groups, who are looking 
for similar agreements of association with the EU, will 
likely affect their moods and negotiating postures at the 
Summit. 
 
3.  (C)  The Irish strongly prefer discussions to focus on 
issues directly affecting both regions rather than stray into 
global issues.  However, global issues may well arise as they 
did at the last Summit in Madrid.  This time around, these 
could include current events in Iraq and in the Middle East. 
 
 
AGENDA 
 
4.  (U)   The two-part agenda addresses \"effective 
multilateralism\" and \"social cohesion.\" 
 
-- Effective multilateralism -- 
 
5.  (U)  Earlier this month, Ireland failed to get the phrase 
\"effective multilateralism\" approved at the 
Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial.  Ministers refused to accept 
the word \"effective.\"  Ireland is hoping include \"effective\" 
in the Latin-Caribbean declaration. 
 
6.  (C)  Ireland\'s draft addresses UN reform and EU/Latin 
American cooperation and coordination.  Agreement on a 
position for UN reform is proving difficult within the EU 
with their varying positions on a range of issues, 
overshadowed by German and Italian vying for permanent seats 
on the Security Council, Conlon said. 
 
7.  (C)  Significantly for the USG, Conlon revealed the EU 
hopes to find ways to capitalize on the strength of numbers 
from the blocs -- EU, Latins and Caribbean -- to sway UN 
negotiations their way.  Poloff pointed out that G77 politics 
could hamper coordinated bloc voting.  Conlon conceded this 
could happen but said it was worth starting the process to 
see how it would develop. 
 
-- Social Cohesion -- 
 
8.   (C)  Regarding social cohesion issues, Ireland hopes to 
address well-known EU social, economic, and political 
objectives that will commit Latin and Caribbean countries 
further to self-financed reform and sustainable development. 
 
9.  (C)  The EU wants to move countries further away from 
dependence on external aid and toward \"full implementation of 
the Monterrey consensus,\" including taxing domestic wealth, 
generating local capital, and setting policies that should 
attract foreign direct investment, Conlon added. 
 
10.  (C)  On the theme of \"Social Cohesion,\" the Irish hope 
the Latins and Caribbeans will endorse themes including: 
 
     -- fighting corruption; 
 
     -- working to overcome political and economic inequality 
and discrimination on any grounds; 
 
     -- formulating national plans that address social 
exclusion, including eliminating the marginalization of 
indigenous people; 
 
DECLARATION 
 
11.  (C)  A Declaration, drafted by the Chairs and submitted 
to ministers/heads of government at the Summit, has been 
under negotiations in Brussels.  These now move to 
Guadalajara for one last push next week before the Summit. 
 
12.   (C) Ireland\'s strategy is to set textual and political 
precedents for future association agreements between the EU 
and the Latins/Caribbeans.  They seek a \"shift of focus\" to 
concentrate more on Monterrey Consensus goals and related 
social, political and economic standards. 
 
13.  (C)  The Latin side is resisting somewhat.  Conlon said 
that Argentina has been particularly difficult.  Brazil began 
positively, but has recently cooled.  Chile has been 
cooperative.  Mexico, the host, is being helpful;  President 
Fox reportedly sent a letter to his Latin counterparts last 
week laying out Mexico\'s hopes for the Declaration, but 
Conlon could not share its contents.  The Caribbean nations, 
with significant interests divergent from the Latins, have 
been cooperative, especially toward British, Irish, and Dutch 
issues. 
 
14.  (C)  Negotiations in Brussels hit snags recently that 
led the EU to speculate whether Latin and Caribbean 
negotiators were reflecting merely the wishes of foreign 
ministries or were factoring in social and economic 
ministries\' points of view. Hoping to move things ahead, the 
EU demarched all capitals in Latin American and the Caribbean 
last week in the run up to the next round of negotiations in 
Guadalajara next week, Conlon said. 
 
ATTENDEES AND FORMAT OF DISCUSSIONS 
 
15.  (C)  The Irish expect 15 of the 25 EU heads of 
government to attend, including Germany\'s Chancellor 
Schroeder,  France\'s President Chirac, Spain\'s PM Zapatero, 
Austria\'s Chancellor Schussel, Dutch PM Balkenende, and 
Swedish PM Persson, as well as representatives from the new 
EU 10 either at the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister level. 
 Cuba is expected to attend, though it is not clear if Castro 
himself will travel, Conlon said. 
 
16.  (C)  On May 27, Foreign Ministers will meet.  On May 28, 
Heads of Government will meet in three groups of 20 each that 
will discuss the agenda and report back to a Plenary, where 
they will adopt the Declaration.  On May 29, in addition to 
meeting with MERCOSUR, the EU plans troika meetings with the 
Central American group, Andean group, CARIFORUM, Mexico, and 
Chile. 
 
COMMENT 
 
17.  (C)  In addition to improved economic ties with Latin 
American/Caribbean region, the EU hopes association 
agreements, such as that planned with MERCOSUR and perhaps 
others, could lead to improved political clout at the UN and 
elsewhere.  The EU\'s challenge will be to secure greater 
Latin American commitment to the ambitious targets of the 
Monterrey Consensus in exchange for greater access to EU 
markets and political support.

SUBJECT: SAID THE TIGER TO THE DRAGON: READOUT OF 
IRELAND-CHINA BILATERAL MEETINGS 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Jane B. Fort for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1.  (C)  Visiting Ireland May 11-12, Chinese Premier Wen 
Jiabao met Irish President Mary McAleese, Dail (Parliament) 
Speaker Rory O\'Hanlon, and Chairman of the Senate Rory Kiely 
before extended, substantive discussions with the Taoiseach 
(Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern.  Wen then visited Iona 
Technologies in Dublin, the Shannon Free Trade Zone, and the 
University of Limerick.  The Irish were left with the 
impression that Wen and his entourage were modern, pragmatic 
and eager-to-learn how the Chinese dragon could emulate the 
economic wonders of the Irish \"Celtic tiger.\" However, while 
ready to take on board Irish economic and education ideas, 
the Chinese were not ready to embrace the modern political 
practices that were the sine qua non of Ireland\'s success. 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (C)  Poloff spoke May 18 with Cliona Manahan Leslie, 
Director of the DFA\'s Asia and Oceana branch, who had just 
several completed days of meetings in Ireland and in Brussels 
covering China\'s visits.  She described a businesslike and 
open atmosphere for dialogue encouraged by the Chinese who 
clearly came \"to learn how Ireland succeeded.\"  Manahan 
Leslie, an experienced (and enthusiastic) China watcher, was 
left with \"real hope for the future\" regarding Chinese 
development and relations with the EU. 
 
3.  (U)  Meetings on May 17 included one with President Mary 
McAleese, which was cordial and pro forma.  A meeting with 
Dail Chair O\'Hanlon resulted in the call for more development 
of Irish-Chinese relations through enhanced exchanges with 
the Chinese National Peoples\' Congress and other agencies. 
 
LOOKING TO LEARN FROM THE CELTIC TIGER 
 
4.  (C)  The extended exchanges with the Taoiseach were 
substantive and wide ranging, according to Manahan Leslie. 
She recalled Wen saying he had come to Ireland \"to learn how 
Ireland\'s economy grew so fast.\" While open to a free 
exchange of ideas, the Chinese were not ready to admit the 
need for political liberalization, she added. 
 
5.  (C)  China has problems with sustainable development and 
they know it.  Their economy \"is growing too fast, there are 
too few controls on construction, and gas consumption is too 
high,\" Wen is reported to have said. 
 
6.  (C)  The Chinese were told that the Irish economy took 
off in the 1990\'s because economic support structures were in 
place, such as liberalized banking rules, a good educational 
system, and low taxes relative to the rest of the EU.  These 
in turn led to significant foreign direct investment from 
both sides of the Atlantic. 
 
7.  (C)  According to Manahan Leslie, Wen admitted that China 
would \"have to come more to Ireland (to learn) and to \"do 
more at home to improve conditions\" for sustainable 
investment.  This includes getting young people out of the 
country to travel and be educated abroad.  (Note:  Ireland 
already hosts 40,000 to 50,000 Chinese, mainly students on 
work-study visas in Dublin and other cities.  There are also 
many migrant workers and professionals, according to local 
press reports.  The Irish Chinese Information Center, which 
advises newly arrived students, reports that students come to 
Ireland to learn English because the education system here is 
substantially cheaper than in the U.S. or U.K., other prime 
destinations.  End note.) 
 
8.  (C)  And what about democracy and the rule of law?  \"The 
Chinese didn\'t want to discuss those,\"  Manahan Leslie 
admitted, although the Irish did \"cover all the expected 
topics,\" such as human rights. 
 
NO PRESS PLEASE, WE\'RE CHINESE 
 
9. (C)  The Irish, presumably at the behest of the Chinese, 
abruptly canceled a scheduled press conference in the late 
afternoon after the May 11 meetings.  The public reason given 
was that the meetings had run well over time so there was no 
time for the press.  Manahan Leslie added to Poloff that 
Dublin was the Chinese\'s last stop and everyone was tired. 
However, Poloff pointed out that if the Chinese were eager to 
present a new face to the West to attract investment, a press 
conference would have been a prime opportunity.  Thus 
pressed, Manahan Leslie admitted that the Chinese still \"just 
don\'t care about or respect the press.\"  She added that 
Chinese openness to modernization would have to \"translate 
into activity\" on press fronts for China to maintain its 
forward progress.  She based her long-term hopes for China\'s 
future on developments such as the planned EU-China 
professional exchanges, including meetings of 
Parliamentarians. 
 
COMMENT 
 
10. (C)  We caught up with Manahan Leslie shortly after Wen\'s 
entourage left Europe.  She was clearly enthusiastic over the 
visit.  Wen\'s tone and the bearing of the Chinese delegation 
impressed her deeply.  An outspoken China watcher for many 
years, she found this Premier and his entourage more 
professional and ready to face the future than previous ones. 
 Nevertheless, the Irish note that the Chinese dragon still 
ignores the elephant in the room, that is, the need for 
political reform, including press freedom, that is an 
essential part of the formula for sustainable development.

SUBJECT: Despite the Rumors, Irish PM Ahern Not 
        Likely as the Next President of the EU 
        Commission 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  European and Irish media have 
labeled Irish PM Ahern a front runner for the EU 
Commission president.  Ahern, one of the EU\'s longest 
serving PMs, has won wide approval for his management 
thus far of the EU Presidency, and his profile in 
Europe has never been higher.  However, Ahern has, on 
more than one occasion, ruled himself out of the 
running, and we believe him when he says he will not 
move to Brussels.  Current European Parliament 
president (and Irishman) Pat Cox is not seen here as 
emerging as a compromise choice.  End Summary. 
 
Ahern\'s EU Star In The Ascendancy 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  When Europe\'s media focused on Ireland for 
the May 1st accession celebrations, PM Bertie Ahern\'s 
name first cropped up as a candidate for the post of 
EU Commission president.  (Commission President 
Romano Prodi will step down from his job in October 
2004.)  Rumors in the Irish media spread when the 
Financial Times Germany (May 13), weighed in with a 
profile of Ahern, emphasizing his legendary powers of 
negotiation and stating how this would qualify him 
for the role of Commission president.  The \"Times\" of 
London followed suit. 
 
3.   (SBU)  In many respects, Ahern would be an ideal 
candidate.  He has rolled up his sleeves over the 
past five months and thrown himself into the job of 
President of the European Council, successfully 
defusing intra-EU friction from the previous 
Presidency, overseeing the smooth accession of 10 new 
EU members, and generating optimism on concluding the 
IGC and agreeing a constitutional treaty by the June 
16-17 EU Summit.  He has a wealth of EU knowledge 
from his position as one of the longest-serving EU 
leaders, and an Irish Commission President should be 
broadly acceptable to larger states like Germany and 
France.  Ahern also enjoys an excellent personal 
relationship with British PM Blair, forged in the 
Northern Ireland peace process. 
 
But There\'s No Place Like Home 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  However, when asked by a leader of one of 
the  opposition parties in the Parliament on May 19 
whether he would be seeking the position of President 
of the Commission, Ahern responded with a very 
definite \"no.\"  A savvy political operator, Ahern 
might well be playing coy were it not for the fact 
that Ahern is very much a domestic political animal. 
Until now, he has kept foreign travel to a minimum 
throughout his public life -- so much so, there are 
stories of Ahern traveling long and late to return to 
Dublin for the night.  Although a committed European, 
he has never immersed himself in EU politics, prior 
to the Presidency.  Nor does he speak French; he is a 
genuine \"old boy\" from north Dublin, with a distinct 
accent (in English and in Irish) to match.  Most 
observers bet that Ahern will seek another five-year 
term as PM in the next general election in 2007. 
While hard to predict now, Ahern\'s coalition would 
have a real chance at a third term, if the economic 
upswing continues. 
 
If Not Bertie, Who? 
------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  When asked, Ahern stated that the GOI 
could well support the candidature of outgoing 
European Parliament President Pat Cox, or any Irish 
candidate who could demonstrate that s/he had the 
support of other member states.  It was a clever 
formulation in response.  As EU President, Ireland is 
not supposed to lobby for any candidate.  We note, 
however, that Cox, an Independent MEP, is not close 
to Ahern\'s Fianna Fail party.  Instead, Ahern is 
likely to nominate a serving cabinet minister, 
possibly Finance minister Charlie McCreevy, as 
Ireland\'s next Commissioner.

SUBJECT: ANTI-WAR ELEMENTS PRESSURING GOVERNMENT ON 
PRESIDENT\'S VISIT TO IRELAND 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Jane B. Fort, reason 1.4 (d) 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary:  Some Irish opposition politicians are 
teaming up with anti-war organizations to protest President 
Bush,s visit to Ireland June 25-26.  Sinn Fein, the Greens, 
and Labour have announced their support for mass 
demonstrations, while various Parliamentary deputies have 
called on the GOI to take action ranging from canceling the 
visit to demarching the President on abuses at Abu Ghraib. 
Dismay over Iraq, especially the lack of an international 
mandate for military action, is key.  Electioneering for June 
11 local and MEP elections is in part responsible for this 
grandstanding, reflecting negative public sentiment against 
the President,s visit.  However, we do not anticipate any 
disruption to the Summit, which will highlight the strong 
TransAtlantic ties valued by the majority of Irish.  End 
Summary. 
 
Politicians Gauging Anti-War Sentiment 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.   (SBU)  The Irish Anti-War Movement is hoping for a 
repeat of the February 2003 rally which saw 100,000 on the 
streets of Dublin to protest the pending Iraq war and the 
GOI,s granting of refuel and overflight rights to the U.S. 
military.  A fundraising concert in Dublin featuring 
prominent Irish musician Christy Moore (among others), and 
backed by the largest Irish trade union, is scheduled for 
June 19.  Proceeds will be used to organize nation-wide 
demonstrations on June 25 and a march on June 26 from the 
Summit site to Shannon airport.  Opposition parties Sinn 
Fein, the Greens, and Labour have lent their support to the 
protests, along with several independent Deputies. 
 
3.   (C) In Parliament, the government has come under 
pressure from all the opposition parties to take a stand 
against U.S. action in Iraq.  Some have called on PM Ahern to 
close Shannon airport to the U.S. military, to make a 
personal demarche to President Bush on the Abu Ghraib abuses, 
and to relocate the Summit to Brussels.  With local and 
European Parliamentary elections scheduled for June 11, all 
parties are playing to populist elements -- including the 
government coalition.  PM Ahern and FM Cowen have gone on 
record to criticize USG prison abuses, while Mary Harney, 
Deputy PM, leader of the coalition partner Progressive 
Democrats, and -- in her own words -- \"one of the most 
pro-American politicians\" in Ireland, has made clear that she 
intends to raise the Abu Ghraib scandal during the 
President\'s visit.  She foresees public protests as well, 
characterizing them as \"no bad thing.\"  Enda Kenny, leader of 
the moderate opposition party Fine Gael, insisted to the 
Ambassador that a statement attributed to him that the Summit 
should move to Brussels was false. 
 
4.  (C)  PM Ahern,s Fianna Fail party may be hoping that, 
once past the June elections, there will be less impetus to 
grandstand on Iraq.  Barry Andrews, an up-and-coming, 
well-connected Fianna Fail Deputy, told us he thought the 
Irish public and politicians will have had their say on Iraq 
by the time of the visit, and said he was not concerned about 
high profile public statements or elaborate demonstrations 
during the Summit. 
 
Vocal, if Shallow, Opposition Centered on Iraq 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5.   (C)  We are more cautious.  An \"Irish Examiner\" poll 
released May 29 found 67 percent opposed to the President,s 
visit, with supporters only weighing in at 19 percent. 
Opposition to the U.S. military,s use of Shannon remains 
constant (though not universal), and a May 17-21 goodwill 
visit of the Sixth Fleet command ship USS LaSalle was greeted 
with deep suspicion by media and some members of Parliament. 
Dublin City Council approved a measure to fly white peace 
flags in lieu of the U.S. flag during the visit, and 
protestors have even seized on relatively low-key events (HHS 
Secretary Thompson,s participation in a health conference in 
 
SIPDIS 
Cork, a trip by the Ambassador to Galway) to demonstrate 
against U.S. foreign policy.  A group calling itself \"U.S. 
Citizens for Peace\" plans weekly vigils at the embassy 
throughout the month of June. 
 
6.   (C)  Unforeseen events on the ground in Iraq, and the 
impending transfer of sovereignty around the time of the 
Summit could also create new excuses for protests. 
Continued violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the 
perception of U.S. bias towards Israel and the Sharon 
government, may further fuel protests. 
 
Government Committed to TransAtlantic Ties 
------------------------------------------ 
7.   (C)  Notwithstanding popular (and populist) pressure, 
the GOI is committed to a smooth, secure, and productive 
summit which showcases the mutual benefits of the U.S.-EU 
relationship.  The Irish are fully engaged in both the 
substantive and logistical preparations for the visit, and 
working with their EU counterparts to hammer out language on 
a range of statements highlighting areas of cooperation. 
 
 
8.   (C)  The Irish are also taking very seriously the 
security arrangements for the visit.  Thousands of uniformed 
police and defense forces personnel will be drafted into the 
Shannon area to provide extensive perimeter security at 
Shannon airport and the Summit site.  In an April meeting 
with senior Irish police officials, the U.S. Secret Service 
and RSO reached agreement on many key security issues. 
USG-GOI cooperation and coordination continues, and we are 
confident that protestors will not disrupt the Summit. 
Comment 
-------- 
 
9.   (C)  Popular opposition to current U.S. foreign policy 
notwithstanding, it would be a gross misstatement to 
characterize the Irish mood as anti-American.  Family, 
travel, and business ties are as strong and healthy as ever, 
and we believe the view of the United States from the man in 
the street remains, on balance, positive.  Much of the 
\"anti-Bush\" sentiment expressed by protestors and opposition 
politicians is, in fact, aimed at trying to elicit from the 
Irish Government a clear statement opposing U.S. action in 
Iraq.  The GOI proved its mettle last year, weathering 
anti-Shannon protests at the onset of the Iraq war and 
maintaining a pragmatic position in support of both 
multilateralism and TransAtlantic ties.  We expect no less 
from them this time around.

the June 16 re-trial of Irish citizen Mary Kelly, charged 
with trespass and criminal damage to a US Navy aircraft at 
Shannon airport on January 29, 2003.  Ms. Kelly, an anti-war

illegally entered the tarmac area where a U.S. Navy C-40 
aircraft was parked, and used an axe to cause over USD 4 
million in damage to the aircraft, before being apprehended. 
A June 2003 trial ended in a hung jury, with the jury unable 
to determine whether the damage was criminal in nature.  The 
defendant argued that her actions were not criminal because 
they were intended to prevent \"illegal\" military action in 
Iraq.

Cooperation Division, on June 3.  Sexton said Ireland agreed 
with the urgency of the situation and was participating in 
the Donor\'s Consultative Meeting on Darfur in Geneva today in 
both its Presidential and national capacities. 
 
2.  Sexton said that Development Minister Tom Kitt, speaking 
at the Geneva meeting on behalf of the EU Development 
Ministers,  will announce 10 million Euro in new funding 
through ECHO, on top of the 3.2 million Euro already given in 
support of humanitarian operations.  Ireland itself has 
pledged an additional 1.5 million Euro, on top of the 1 
million Euro they announced a few weeks ago, of which 750,000 
Euro went to the consolidated appeal.  Sexton pointed out 
that Irish NGOs are strongly engaged on Darfur, which 
explains the large Irish contribution relative to the EU as a 
whole.

4.  Key issues for the EU are human security and protection, 
humanitarian access and protection for aid workers, and 
respect for human rights.  Sexton noted that the Africa Union 
requested funding to support deployment of its \"cease-fire 
mechanism\" in Darfur.  EU Development Ministers have approved 
the request, which is being fast-tracked through the EU\'s 
Africa Peace Facility now.

1.   (SBU)  Poloff was informed today by Irish DFA UN 
Division Chief John Deady that the Irish Government had taken 
a decision \"at the highest political level\" to extend their 
peacekeepers to the ISAF mission in Afghanistan.  The troops 
had been scheduled to withdraw this summer, and will now stay 
on for another twelve months. 
 
2.   (C)  This decision follows weeks of embassy outreach to 
the GOI to urge them to remain in the mission.  Our initial 
soundings (reftel and previous) indicated that the  Irish 
Defense Forces were balking at stretching personnel and 
resources to remain a part of the ISAF mission.  We are 
extremely pleased that our continued engagement at the 
political level resulted in this decision to push back on the 
military\'s reluctance, and to reaffirm the Irish commitment 
to global counterterrorism -- particularly as they prepare to 
host the U.S.-EU Summit on June 26.

1.   (C)  Summary:  Irish President Mary McAleese and Prime 
Minister Bertie Ahern are looking forward to welcoming the 
President to Dromoland Castle in the west of Ireland for the 
U.S.-EU Summit June 26.  Ahern can be justly proud of his 
management of the EU Presidency to date, including his 
leadership in helping to repair TransAtlantic ties.  His 
higher international profile is espeically useful as Ahern 
continues to struggle domestically.  His political party is 
predicted to lose seats in June 11 local and European 
Parliament elections, despite an economic upturn, as voters 
take out their frustration over the slow pace of reforms in 
basic services. 
 
2.   (C)  Although militarily neutral Ireland did not support 
the war in Iraq, and we expect a vocal (if harmless) turnout 
of protestors (reftel), the state of U.S.-Irish relations 
remains as strong as ever.  Ireland continues to allow the 
U.S. military to refuel at Shannon airport, to foster the 
vibrant commercial ties between our nations, and to support 
major peacekeeping operations such as ISAF and Liberia.  U.S. 
support for political progress in Northern Ireland is deeply 
appreciated, and is a subject of particular passion for 
President McAleese and her husband.  We should push the Irish 
Government to break the logjam in Parliament on new laws to 
criminalize international terrorism.  With a UN mandate, 
Ireland could send troops to Iraq, although this would be 
unpopular; we may wish to sound out Ahern on this.  End 
Summary. 
 
The Domestic Scene 
------------------ 
 
3.   (SBU)  On June 11, PM Ahern\'s coalition government faces 
its first real test since general elections in 2002, as 
voters elect local and city councillors, and Members of the 
European Parliament (MEP).  Voter unhappiness with perceived 
backtracking on promises to improve basic services has 
gradually diminished Ahern\'s approval ratings, currently in 
the low 40s.  Analysts expect that Ahern\'s coalition will 
lose a significant number of local seats, and possibly an MEP 
seat or two, with more left-leaning parties such as Sinn Fein 
and Labour predicted to benefit.  While a drubbing in these 
elections will by no means signify the end of the Ahern 
government, it could hasten a cabinet shake-up this summer. 
Public irritation with the government centers on its 
struggles to deliver adequate health care services, 
education, public transportation and infrastructure and 
policing. 
 
 
Irish Interests in the EU Presidency 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.   (C)  On a happier note for Ahern, the PM has won kudos 
throughout the EU for competent management of difficult 
issues facing the Union, including repairing the 
TransAtlantic relationship, the accession of ten new member 
states, valiant attempts at a Cyprus settlement, responding 
to the terror attacks in Madrid, and talks to negotiate a 
European Constitution.  The Irish government prides itself on 
being the bridge between \"Boston and Berlin\", and Ahern will 
reiterate that one of his top priorities is strengthening 
U.S.-EU ties.  The relationship is indeed in much better 
shape than it was six months ago, and Ireland will continue 
to push for reduced trade and investment barriers, and closer 
U.S.-EU coordination on Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
However, the Irish are also strong multilateralists, and 
Ahern will urge the fullest possible UN engagement in Iraq 
and the Middle East.  Ireland has a history of development 
assistance to Africa, due to a long tradition of missionary 
work, and Ahern will be particularly pleased to oversee a 
joint statement on HIV-AIDS cooperation.  Finally, Ahern is 
likely to briefly raise ITER, following up on a promise to 
French President Chirac during his recent visit to Dublin. 
 
Trade and Investment 
-------------------- 
 
5.   (SBU)  Our bilateral commercial relationship is 
impressive.  U.S. investment in Ireland is approximately USD 
42 billion, with over 550 companies employing close to 
100,000 Irish workers.  Information technology, 
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and financial services are the 
big investors here, with most of the Fortune 500 firms 
represented.  A well-educated, English-speaking workforce 
with an American-style work ethic and legal system are major 
factors, in addition to the low corporate tax rate of 12 
percent.  Ireland is the ninth largest foreign investor in 
the United States (USD 30 billion) and employs some 40,000 
Americans. 
 
6.   (SBU)  Ireland is anxious to maintain its favored 
investment status with the U.S. in the newly-expanded EU, as 
former Eastern European countries adopt the successful Irish 
model.  As a result, the Irish are aggressively working to 
move up the value-added chain into higher-end R&D programs to 
remain competitive. 
 
Counterterrorism Measures 
------------------------- 
 
7.   (SBU)  Ireland has tough laws to counter domestic 
terrorism, due to the legacy of paramilitary activity in the 
Northern Ireland conflict.  The Irish and British governments 
have excellent cooperation in cracking down on dissident 
republican paramilitary groups across the entire island.  In 
2003, the Irish -- with help from an FBI informant -- 
successfully prosecuted their first case of \"leadership in a 
terrorist organization\", jailing the leader of the Real IRA. 
 
8.   (C)  Unfortunately, legislation to criminalize 
international terrorism has been hung up in the Irish 
Parliament for over two years.  Ireland is party to five of 
the twelve UN Conventions Against Terorrism, but human rights 
concerns have stalled movement on legislation to allow 
Ireland to become party to the remaining seven.  The GOI 
hopes to push the legislation through the Parliament by the 
time of the Summit, but this appears unlikely.  Negotiations 
on a protocol to harmonize the U.S.-Irish Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with the U.S.-EU MLAT appear poised 
for completion by the end of June. 
 
Peacekeeping 
------------ 
 
9.   (C)  Irish Defense Forces are currently deployed to 
Kosovo, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Liberia, where Ireland is 
the largest non-African contingency.  The Irish Government 
recently took the decision to extend the ISAF and UNIFIL 
missions, for which Ahern should be congratulated.  There are 
no Irish forces in Iraq; under Irish law, troops cannot be 
deployed without a UN-authorized mission.  You should probe 
Ahern on his willingness to  send Irish peacekeepers to Iraq 
under a UN mandate.  There would be strong resistance from 
the Parliament and the public, but this is an opportunity for 
Ireland to reaffirm its belief in the primacy of the United 
Nations by contributing to a multinational force. 
 
Northern Ireland 
---------------- 
 
10.   (SBU)  Elections in November 2003 to the suspended 
Northern Ireland Assembly put the Democratic Unionist Party 
(DUP) and Sinn Fein as the largest parties, but did not bring 
the restoration of devolved government.  The DUP refuses to 
enter into government with Sinn Fein until the Irish 
Republican Army (IRA) ends all paramilitary activity. 
Despite tremendous demands on British PM Blair and Irish PM 
Ahern, the two leaders have dedicated enormous personal time 
and effort to try to put together a deal to restart the 
political process.  Under discussion is further 
decommissioning of IRA weapons, a political decision by 
republicans to end IRA paramilitary activity, Sinn Fein 
agreement to support the reformed Police Service of Northern 
Ireland, HMG delivery on demilitarization and devolution of 
security and justice functions, and DUP agreement to enter 
into negotations with Sinn Fein. 
 
11.   (SBU)  A non-violent summer of sectarian marches will 
be critical to the success of this effort, as will a second 
report this fall from the International Monitoring Commission 
-- a four member body of officials from Ireland, Northern 
Ireland, Britain, and the United States.  (Former CIA Deputy 
Director Richard Kerr is the U.S. member.)  The Commission, 
charged by the governments with monitoring and reporting on 
abuses of the Good Friday Agreement, issued its first report 
in April, in which it criticized republican and loyalist 
paramilitary groups for illegal activities. 
 
12.   (SBU)  Embassies Dublin and London, Consulate General 
Belfast, and your Special Envoy Mitchell Reiss have continued 
to facilitate dialogue among political leaders in Dublin, 
London, and Belfast.  We also continue to contribute to the 
International Fund for Ireland, a British-Irish project to 
generate employment and training in the neglected border 
areas and sectarian neighborhoods in Belfast, Derry and other 
cities, and to provide alternatives to joining illegal 
paramilitary groups. 
 
Shannon Airport 
--------------- 
 
13.   (SBU)  Shannon airport, in the west of Ireland, is an 
important gateway for U.S. commercial and military travel. 
We have a long-standing arrangement with the GOI whereby U.S. 
military aircraft land and refuel at Shannon, en route to the 
Gulf, Afghanistan, etc.   This policy was, and remains, the 
focal point of anti-war protestors who view this as a 
violation of Irish neutrality.  We appreciate the GOI\'s 
continued support, and steps it has taken to ensure the 
security of the nearly 126,000 U.S. forces who passed through 
Shannon in 2003. 
 
14.   (C)  The commercial use of Shannon by U.S. carriers is 
also a sensitive issue, as we negotiate a U.S.-EU Open Skies 
agreement which will see the phase-out of the \"Shannon 
stopover\", which currently forces half of U.S. flights to 
land at Shannon prior to traveling on to Dublin.  The Shannon 
airport authority and Shannon-area tourism industries insist 
the elimination of this requirement will be disastrous for 
the region\'s development and the airport\'s viability; 
TransAtlantic passenger and cargo traffic currently account 
for 40 percent of the airport\'s total annual revenues.  We 
believe these concerns can be addressed through smart 
marketing of products and services, and Open Skies talks will 
benefit both U.S. and Irish carriers by adding new routes in 
Ireland and the U.S., respectively. 
 
Travel and Security 
--------------------- 
 
15.   (SBU)  Approximately 900,000 Americans travel to 
Ireland each year for business and tourism, and over 300,00 
Irish visit the United States.  The implementation of the 
US-VISIT program at pre-clearance immigration facilities at 
Shannon and Dublin airports has been extremely smooth, in 
part because Ireland is on the Visa Waiver Program and most 
Irish travelers do not yet have to be fingerprinted.  Ireland 
is one of the few EU countries on track to meet the October 
24, 2004 deadline for introducing passports with biometric 
identifiers, an effort worth acknowledging.

SUBJECT: Local and European Elections in Ireland: 
        Ahern Government to Take Hits, But Not At 
        Expense of TransAtlantic Relationship 
 
REFERENCE:  Dublin 811 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Local and European Parliament 
elections on June 11 will be a referendum on Irish PM 
Ahern\'s Fianna Fail-led coalition government, as 
voters have their first say since returning the 
government to office in 2002.  Ahern\'s FF party is 
expected to take sizeable hits for failure to deliver 
on the domestic agenda; foreign policy issues, 
including Iraq, do not feature prominently in the 
debate.  The political opposition looks set to make 
healthy gains, particularly the left-leaning Labour 
and Sinn Fein parties.  After EU enlargement, Irish 
MEP seats were reduced from 15 to 13; with local 
issues dominant, we do not anticipate any hardening 
of views on the TransAtlantic relationship.  End 
Summary. 
 
Local Elections A Referendum on Ahern Government 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  (SBU)  Local and European elections were last 
held in Ireland in 1999, with PM Bertie Ahern\'s 
Fianna Fail taking 383 of the 883 county and city 
council seats nationwide.  Current polling indicates 
the party is down eight percent in support from 1999, 
and we expect Fianna Fail to lose anywhere from 50 to 
100 seats come June 11.  The public, while not openly 
hostile to the government, is still critical of the 
government\'s failure to deliver on its 2002 general 
election manifesto, with spending cuts in education 
and health care the most sensitive issues.  Anything 
over a 50 seat loss will spell trouble for Ahern, 
whose personal popularity rating is in the low 40s. 
A meltdown in the local elections may re-ignite 
rumors about Ahern\'s departure for the EU Commission 
(reftel).  Though unlikely to signal his imminent 
departure, a poor return may prompt Ahern to be more 
radical in a Cabinet shuffle expected during the 
summer recess. 
 
Growth of the Left 
----------------- 
 
3.   (SBU)  Despite the downturn in government 
support, moderate opposition party Fine Gael is 
failing to capitalize on voter unhappiness.  Fine 
Gael, decimated in the 2002 general election, is 
struggling to convince the electorate it is still 
relevant, and to hold on to its 278 local seats.  A 
loss of more than fifty seats would spell doom for 
party leader Enda Kenny, and leave many questioning 
Fine Gael\'s future. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The largest beneficiaries are likely to be 
the Labour Party, which has raised its profile with 
strong anti-war views, and Sinn Fein, which is 
focusing on marginalized inner-city communities. 
Polls indicate that Labour\'s bounce will be smaller 
than Sinn Fein\'s, with the latter expected to double 
its current low baseline of 21 local seats.  The 
Green Party and Independent candidates may attract a 
small protest vote, but are unlikely to figure in the 
overall scheme of things. 
 
European Parliament Candidates 
------------------------------ 
 
5.   (SBU)  Under the Nice Treaty, which paved the 
way for EU enlargement, Ireland\'s representation in 
the European Parliament was cut from 15 to 13 seats. 
With eight of the current MEPs retiring, the 
competition for seats is fierce and wide open. 
Fianna Fail will struggle to hold on to its six 
seats, while Fine Gael and Labour may add to their 
seats (four and one, respectively).  Fine Gael\'s 
likely success in the EP elections, in contrast to 
the local elections, is based on a smart selection of 
candidates, with a slate that balances youth with 
experience.  Sinn Fein hopes to win its first MEP 
seat, but polls suggest this will be a struggle.  The 
Greens may lose both their MEP slots. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Likely MEP winners include Dublin Lord 
Mayor (and Bertie Ahern protg) Royston Brady; Fine 
e 
Gael Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Gay Mitchell; and 
current Labour MEP Proinsias De Rossa.  De Rossa is a 
staunch critic of U.S. foreign policy, as would be 
the other strong Labour candidate Peter Cassells (a 
trade union leader).  Mitchell is an Atlanticist who 
has long argued for Ireland to rethink its position 
on military neutrality, and the other Fine Gael MEP 
contenders fall in behind this line.  Brady is 
inexperienced in foreign policy, but may be receptive 
to Ahern\'s counsel.  Sinn Fein announced a strong 
anti-war and pro-neutrality platform in launching its 
campaign.  The other MEP candidates are largely 
focused on domestic issues, particularly the impact 
of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms on Irish 
farmers.  Iraq and U.S.-EU ties do not feature 
prominently on the door steps, though this has not 
stopped the Labour Party, Sinn Fein, and, to a lesser 
extent, the Greens, from attempting to make it an 
election issue.

SUMMARY 
 
1.  (C)  Irish government concerns about the continuing 
detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and the lack of participation 
by pro-democracy groups at the constitutional convention will 
not result in public statements soon.  Ireland continues to 
work indirectly through its Asian partners.  Upcoming Asia-EU 
meetings (ASEM) present difficult options for the EU 25 on 
whether, and how, to attend meetings where the ASEAN side 
expects to seat Burma as a quid pro quo for meeting the 
formally enlarged EU.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U)  Poloff delivered demarche based on Reftel A to 
Caitriona Ingoldsby of the Asia and Oceana Section of the DFA 
on June 8.  DFA principals who cover Burma have been 
traveling.  Ingoldsby promised to share points with Cliona 
Manahan-Leslie, Director of the office, and Niall Brady, 
member of her staff, who are now in Brussels for an EU Asia 
directors meeting July 9 in the run up to the General Affairs 
and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting next week. 
 
3.  (C)  Cautious Ireland, equally concerned by the detention 
of Aung San Suu Kyi and the exclusion of pro-democracy groups 
from the convention, has no plans to comment publicly on 
Burma yet.  Irish influence and access to the Burmese 
government is limited and Ireland\'s experience is that 
\"shouting loudly by the EU drives Burma into its shell,\" 
Ingoldsby said, so Ireland has worked indirectly through 
Asian partners.  Demarches and parallel efforts by Irish 
special envoy Ambassador Robert Campbell in capitals have 
borne no fruit and the lack of progress from Rangoon has 
\"surprised everybody\" and \"made constructive engagement 
difficult,\" Ingoldsby complained. 
 
4.  (C)  The calendar will force more overt EU action.  The 
crux of the issue is the bloc admission of the ten new EU 
states to ASEM (Asia Europe Meeting), which the EU expects, 
versus the bloc admission of the three new ASEAN states, 
Laos, Cambodia and Burma, which ASEAN demands as a quid pro 
quo.  The last ASEM meeting of Foreign Ministers in Dublin in 
April (reftel B) adjourned hopeful that anticipated progress 
on Burma would ease the expansion issue.  Now disappointed, 
the EU, formally 25 States since May 1, feels it faces its 
first test of unity, Ingoldsby revealed. 
 
5.  (C)  Ingoldsby said that GAERC will ponder Burma and the 
ASEM dilemma it presents.  The EU needs a common position on 
group participation before ASEM ministerials in July and 
September in the Netherlands and the next ASEM Summit October 
8-9 in Hanoi; several options seem to be on the table: 
 
     a)  The EU refuses to meet with ASEM if Burma is 
included.  Ingoldsby said the EU would work hard to avoid 
this outcome so as to maintain the larger good of the ASEM 
meetings. 
 
     b)  The EU goes to the ASEM meeting as 15, thereby 
forcing ASEAN to exclude Burma and the other two.  Ingoldsby 
refused to be drawn on EU discussions of this difficult 
option, saying it was \"up to partners.\"  She noted that the 
simmering discussions of a \"two tier Europe\" would make this 
option most difficult for the new EU 10 to accept as \"an 
awful precedent so early on.\" 
 
     c)  The EU goes to the ASEM meeting as the troika, with 
ASEAN sending some form of parallel representation. 
Ingoldsby agreed that this option might formally preserve the 
ASEM format while keeping the Burma issue on the table. 
 
     d)  The EU goes as 25, ASEAN comes with Burma, and the 
issue is mooted. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6.  (C)  ASEAN ministers are reportedly as surprised and 
disappointed by current events in Burma as the Irish, who 
clearly feel stymied.  Irish quiet diplomacy, dependent on 
time, is bumping up against constraints imposed by formal 
ASEM meeting calendars.  Excluding the newly-admitted EU 10 
from ASEM meetings, to make a point on Burma, seems unlikely 
to gain consensus among the EU 25. So it remains a question 
of whether the EU sees its broader relationships with Asia 
bound up in ASEM or whether the ASEM vehicle will be 
sacrificed to make a point on Burma.

1.  (C)  Drawing on reftel points, pol/econ chief met on June 
9 with Irish Civil Aviation Director General John Lumsden to 
discuss how to move forward the U.S.-EU air services 
agreement before the June 26 US-EU Summit.  Lumsden noted 
that, following the excellent meeting last month in Ljubljana 
between Irish Minister of Transport Seamus Brennan and U.S. 
Secretary Mineta, Brennan is determined to do his utmost to 
 
SIPDIS 
secure support for an agreement among his colleagues in the 
June 10-11 EU Transport Ministers meeting in Brussels. 
Lumsden added that Brennan intended to start with phone calls 
today, beginning with his British counterpart.  Lumsden said 
that Brennan was not just doing this to further progress on 
an amended US-Ireland civair agreement, but because it was 
his responsibility as head of the Transport Council during 
the Irish EU Presidency. 
 
2.  (C)  Lumsden said that there is no prospect this week for 
a Ministers\' consensus approving the current U.S.-EU 
agreement.  Instead, Brennan\'s objective is to get a positive 
tone from his EU colleagues that minimizes opposition and 
achieves a broad consensus to further pursue a first-step 
agreement before the June 26 Summit.  Lumsden noted that we 
should, therefore, anticipate Irish Presidency vice Council 
conclusions on June 11.  Lumsden said one positive factor is 
that the US-EU agreement is scheduled for discussion over 
lunch on June 11, which is restricted to Ministers only. 
This should facilitate a full and frank airing of Member 
States\' political views.  While Lumsden confirmed that the UK 
is telling them it sees no prospect of an agreement before 
June 26, the Irish strategy between now and the Summit is to 
get a consensus of 24 Member States on the essential elements 
of an agreement, with only details left to be ironed out 
after June 26.  If that happens, the Irish believe the UK 
will reluctantly climb on board. 
 
3.  (C)  Lumsden stressed that the end of the Transport 
Council meeting on June 11 will provide clarity on whether 
the US and EU should engage again on an agreement before the 
Summit.  If there is a broadly held view that the U.S. and EU 
are close to an agreement and further negotiations may close 
the gap, then the EU will call for an additional round of 
negotiations to try and conclude a deal/package that can be 
announced at the Summit.  Otherwise, it will have to await 
the Dutch EU Presidency.  Lumsden added that, if there is a 
breakthrough on an agreement, then the Irish will want to 
conclude bilateral talks with the U.S. as quickly as possible 
after July 9, when the Irish Dail (parliament) is in recess, 
freeing up Brennan to travel to Washington to meet with 
Mineta to discuss the outlines of a final U.S.-Ireland 
agreement.

SUBJECT: Local and European Elections in Ireland:  A 
        Shift to the Left As Ahern Takes A Beating 
 
REFERENCE:  Dublin 868 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Irish PM Bertie Ahern will be 
recovering from a major political setback when he 
meets President Bush on June 26.  His Fianna Fail 
party turned in its worst performance since the 1920s 
in local and European Parliament (EP) elections June 
11.  The big winners were opposition parties Sinn 
Fein, Labour, and Fine Gael, all to the left of the 
current Fianna Fail - Progressive Democrats 
coalition.  Domestic issues appeared to carry the 
day: while anti-war Labour picked up support, the 
equally anti-war Greens lost ground, and we believe 
Sinn Fein\'s appeal is largely its ability to persuade 
voters it can deliver public services.  Ahern\'s 
government, looking towards 2007 general elections, 
faces a real battle to convince voters it has not 
lost touch with the people, and will likely realign 
itself to the center-left.  A refocusing on social 
issues might cause tensions, however, with the pro- 
enterprise Progressive Democrats.  A cabinet 
reshuffle is now likely to involve wholesale changes 
in the ministerial line-up.  End Summary. 
 
Ahern\'s Party Gets a Bloody Nose 
-------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  PM Ahern did not try to hide the extent of 
his disappointment when he met the press to answer 
questions relating to his party\'s hammering at the 
polls.  Fianna Fail\'s support fell by eight percent 
(from 38.9 to 31.9) from the last local elections in 
1999 - resulting in a loss of 84 council seats (from 
382 to 298).  On the European stage, support fell 
over nine percentage points, leaving the party with 
three MEP slots instead of six. 
 
Who Gains? 
---------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  On the surface, Sinn Fein is the big 
winner.  The party more than doubled its local 
authority representation from 21 seats to 54, and 
took its first MEP seat.  Analysts attribute this to 
Sinn Fein going into traditional Fianna Fail 
heartlands and promoting its anti-establishment 
platform to voters keen to punish the government for 
the poor provision of public services.  Sinn Fein 
appears to be widening its support base beyond inner 
city, working class communities to win seats in rural 
constituencies.  In the words of PM Ahern, \"Sinn Fein 
won this election.\" 
 
4.   (SBU)  On the surface, Ahern is correct. 
However, it should be remembered that Sinn Fein was 
starting from a very low position.  The party only 
began to seriously look at electoral politics in the 
\"South\" in the late 1990s and as a result had few 
local authority seats outside Dublin and the Border 
counties prior to last week.  Emboff heard 
predictions from senior Irish figures that Sinn Fein 
would turn a large number of its new local authority 
seats into Dail (Irish parliament) seats at the next 
general election. 
 
Fine Gael: Another Big Winner 
----------------------------- 
 
5.   (SBU)  The largest - and most moderate - 
opposition party, Fine Gael confounded all 
commentators by staging an impressive rally from its 
disastrous showing in the 2002 general election. New 
party leader Enda Kenny has turned the tide, with 
Fine Gael topping Fianna Fail in the European 
Parliament with five seats, and only marginally 
behind Fianna Fail in the number of local authority 
seats held.  While media focus is on Sinn Fein\'s 
gains, the government should be equally uneasy over 
the resurrection of its traditional rival, Fine Gael. 
 
Labour: the Bridesmaid in Future Government? 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Labour Party also gained ground, 
picking up 18 extra local authority seats (an 
increase from 83 to 101).  It is difficult to gauge 
whether the party made much political capital out of 
its opposition to the Iraq war and the June 26 visit 
of President Bush war.  Labour ran an equally strong 
platform accusing the government of broken promises 
on basic services. 
Labour and Fine Gael\'s improvement combine to present 
voters an emerging alternative to the present 
coalition government, when general elections are held 
in 2007. 
 
Greens and PDs: Also-Rans 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  The Green Party lost both its MEP slots 
and barely increased its percentage vote in the local 
authority elections.  The party appears to be a spent 
force for now.  The Progressive Democrats did not 
field any EP candidates, and actually lost local 
authority seats (a fall from 25 to 19). 
 
Comment: Cabinet Shuffle and Bertie to Brussels? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8.   (SBU)  While not exactly blaming each other for the 
government\'s poor showing, Ahern and Deputy PM (and 
Progressive Democrat leader) Mary Harney provided very 
different explanations.  Ahern stated that the government 
must open its ears to public concerns, and hinted that 
reforms in policy areas such as transportation 
deregulation may be moderated.  In contrast, Deputy PM 
Harney strongly opined that the speed of reform should be 
increased.  The coalition may experience a bumpy ride for 
the rest of its term in office, as Ahern makes plans for 
an expected Cabinet shuffle this fall, and realignment to 
the left.  During a stormy Fianna Fail parliamentary party 
meeting on June 15, backbench TDs called for the removal 
of Finance Minister McCreevy, Justice Minister McDowell, 
Health Minister Martin, and Environment Minister Cullen. 
However, we suspect that ministers closer to retirement, 
such as Agriculture Minister Walsh and Defense Minister 
Smith, are more likely to depart in a shuffle. 
 
9.   (SBU)  Ahern\'s poor showing - and the apparent UK and 
Italian rejection of Belgian PM Verhofstadt -  has 
reignited rumors he may allow himself to be put forward as 
a compromise candidate for President of the European 
Commission.  Ahern is viewed by many as second in line for 
the plumb post.  If consensus on Vehofstadt\'s candidature 
is not forthcoming at European Council Summit June 17-18, 
pressure will grow on Ahern to put his name forward. 
Close colleagues of Ahern continue to say this is 
unlikely, however, and Ahern himself reassured his party 
again on June 25 that he will lead them into the 2007 
general elections.

 1.  (U) We shared reftel points with Jonathan Conlon, in the 
DFA\'s Latin American and Caribbean office, and Bronagh Carr, 
development specialist at the DFA\'s Development Cooperation 
Ireland office.  Conlon said that Ireland had already 
contributed  EUR 500,000 to Haiti through UNICEF, OCHA, and 
the International Federation of the Red Cross. Ireland had 
also given an addition EUR 100,000 in response to the recent 
floods.  He could foresee that Ireland might provide further 
financial support for the donors conference, however he could 
not say whether Ireland would send someone to attend the 
meeting itself. 
 
2.  (U)  Carr pointed out that Ireland fully supports the 
coordinated donor approach. They are \"actively involved in 
the Liberia Core Group and played a significant role at the 
February Conference as part of their EU Presidency,\" she 
said.  Ireland has clearly supported calls on Haiti, although 
Haiti is \"a bit off their map,\" adding that Ireland \"focuses 
more on Africa.\" 
 
3.  (U)  Both Carr and Conlon suggested we engage the 
incoming EU President, the Dutch, as soon as practicable, on 
this appeal as well as on the upcoming Donor\'s Conference. 
They regretted they could not participate in planning for the 
Conference due to constraints of resources and capacity 
during the busy days at the end of the Irish Presidency.

TAGS: PREL, PGOV 
SUBJECT: THE PRESIDENT\'S MEETING WITH IRISH PRESIDENT MARY 
MCALEESE - JUNE 26, 2004 
 
REF: DUBLIN 867 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny, reason 1.4 (d) 
 
1.   (U)  This message provides information for the 
President\'s meeting with Irish President Mary McAleese at 
Dromoland Castle on June 26, prior to the start of the 
U.S.-EU Summit. 
 
The Role of Irish President 
--------------------------- 
 
2.   (U)  President McAleese became the eighth Irish 
President in November 1997.  She was directly elected by the 
people and serves a seven-year term as the head of state; the 
head of government is Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.  The 
President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, but 
Irish law requires approval by the Parliament and by the 
Government before any troops can be deployed overseas -- and 
then only to UN-mandated missions. 
 
3.   (U)  Although she does not have an executive or policy 
role in her capacity as President, Mary McAleese has been 
extremely active in representing Ireland around the world, 
receiving foreign leaders in Dublin, and promoting peace and 
reconciliation with Northern Ireland.  She has also been an 
active promoter of Ireland\'s economy, and led a delegation to 
China last year to encourage greater trade with that nation. 
 
Northern Ireland 
---------------- 
 
4.   (C)  Mary McAleese, a Catholic, is the first Irish 
President to come from Northern Ireland.  Both she and her 
husband Martin were born and raised in Belfast, and their 
families suffered attacks during \"The Troubles.\"  They are 
both deeply engaged in the Northern Ireland peace process. 
Martin -- whose childhood home was destroyed in an arson 
attack by loyalist paramilitaries -- spends almost all of his 
time working quietly behind the scenes with loyalist groups, 
one of the most disenfranchised communities in Northern 
Ireland.  Loyalist paramilitaries represent the most radical 
fringe of the unionist community, and Martin has taken on the 
challenge of persuading them to end their violent activity 
and enter the political process.  Whereas Sinn Fein has used 
its influence to bring republican paramilitaries into the 
fold, the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland have held 
loyalists at arms length in protest over their criminal 
activity (e.g. drug smuggling), violent intra-community turf 
wars, and attacks on Catholic nationalists. 
 
5.   (C)  Martin McAleese\'s work with loyalists is 
controversial, but he firmly believes in the value of Irish 
outreach.  Martin has brought loyalist groups to Dublin (a 
first) to meet with Irish officials for private and honest 
exchanges.  His efforts have the support of Prime Minister 
Bertie Ahern, who has also met with loyalist leaders. 
 
Personal Information 
-------------------- 
 
6.   (SBU)  President McAleese -- whose 53rd birthday is June 
27, the day after President Bush meets with her -- is married 
to Dr. Martin McAleese (an accountant and dentist).  They 
have three children.  Emma, aged 22, just graduated from 
university with a degree in electrical engineering and will 
spend six weeks in the U.S. this summer working at NASA 
headquarters in Washington.  Sara and Justin are twins, aged 
19; Justin is very interested in politics and hopes to attend 
the Republican National Convention in New York in August. 
President McAleese\'s professional background is in law and 
journalism.  She is a barrister and former Professor of Law. 
 
7.   (SBU)  Although President McAleese has not confirmed her 
intention to run for a second 7-year term this November, it 
is likely that that she will, and that she will face little 
serious opposition.  Her approval ratings are in the high 
80s/low 90s.

SUBJECT:  NO IMMIGRANTS NEED APPLY? IRISH OVERWHELMINGLY 
PASS CITIZENSHIP REFERENDUM 
 
Reftel: Dublin 00743 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary.  On June 11th, 2004, the Irish 
electorate overwhelmingly approved a referendum that 
eliminated the automatic right of Irish citizenship to all 
children born on the island of Ireland. While many 
referendum opponents claimed the voters were motivated by 
xenophobia, a more balanced view attributes the result to 
growing Irish anxiety about competition for jobs and 
services in a newly expanded European Union.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Ireland\'s days as a net exporter of people are 
long over.  The population of the country has climbed to 
3.9 million, and an unemployment rate well below the EU 
average has made Ireland an increasingly popular 
destination for immigrants, both legal and illegal.  Until 
now, Ireland was the only country in the European Union to 
grant citizenship to every person born within its 
sovereign territory, making Ireland an even more 
attractive immigrant destination.  In January 2003, the 
Irish Supreme Court held that non-national parents of 
citizen children were not automatically entitled to Irish 
citizenship.  However, this did little to combat the 
growing perception that many foreigners were coming to 
Ireland for the purpose of what Justice Minister McDowell 
dubbed \"citizenship tourism\" - exploitation of the social 
welfare system. 
 
3.  (SBU) As concerns mounted over Ireland remaining the 
sole EU nation with such generous citizenship laws, the 
government undertook to amend the constitution via the 
required referendum process.  The referendum campaign was 
lukewarm and stirred little public debate.  Several days 
before the election, newspaper reporting indicated that 
only 50% of the public considered itself well informed on 
the issue.  The phrasing of the referendum question added 
to the confusion, as a \"yes\" vote was actually a vote 
against automatic citizenship. 
 
The Referendum 
-------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The referendum passed by a four to one margin -- 
79% \"yes\" to 20%  \"no.\"  Voter turnout was unusually high 
(60%, a 10 % increase from 2002) with many commentators 
speculating that the decision to hold the referendum on 
the same day as local and European Parliament (EP) 
elections ensured voters would make the trip to the 
polling station.  The result was a surprise to many, as 
the liberal Irish press did a poor job gauging the 
electorate\'s mood on the subject.  Local and EP voters who 
supported Sinn Fein, Labour and the Greens (who all 
opposed the referendum) were as likely to vote for the 
referendum as those who plumped for the government 
parties. 
 
5.  (SBU) Now that the automatic right of citizenship has 
been removed from the constitution, the Dail will consider 
(and likely pass) legislation tightening Ireland\'s 
citizenship laws.  Under the proposed legislation, one 
parent must be resident in Ireland for three out of four 
years for the child to receive Irish citizenship.  This 
policy will bring Ireland much closer to the citizenship 
laws in other EU member states. 
 
6.  (SBU) The new laws will not apply to UK nationals. 
The government adopted this measure to assuage 
nationalists in Northern Ireland who were concerned that 
their automatic right to Irish citizenship (guaranteed 
under the Good Friday Agreement) would be brought into 
question. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU) The referendum result was anomalous in an 
election that saw the governing Fianna Fail and 
Progressive Democrat parties take a beating in both local 
and European Parliament elections.  It would be tempting 
to read the referendum as a positive sign for Ahern\'s 
government, but this would be a mistake.  The Irish 
economy has been sluggish for quite some time (though 
recent signs point to a speedy recovery, and the recent EU 
enlargement saw many Irish and British media outlets 
reporting stories about large numbers of poorer Eastern 
Europeans eager take advantage of their right to live and 
work throughout the EU.  Exit polling suggests that the 
electorate was concerned with economic competition from a 
growing immigrant population, as well as a perception that 
immigrants are abusing the asylum system.  In an election 
that otherwise saw Fianna Fail suffer huge losses, the 
referendum should not be viewed as a victory.

3.  There are no visa requirements for visitors traveling to 
Ireland on diplomatic or official passports. 
 
4.  Please note that as of March 29, 2004, Ireland has 
instituted a smoking ban in the work place, including all 
pubs, restaurants, and hotel common areas.  Violations of 
this law may result in a fine of up to Euro 3,000.  Check 
with hotel staff upon arrival to determine if smoking is 
permitted in hotel room. 
 
5.  Travelers may take the Dublin Aircoach (6 Euro one way, 
departure every 15 minutes) or a taxi (approximately 25 Euro 
one way) to city centre. 
 
6.  Accommodation Exchange:  Post does not have check cashing 
or money changing facilities.  Major credit cards are widely 
accepted; ATM machines accept most major U.S. bankcards, and 
offer the best exchange rates. 
 
SECURITY INFORMATION FOR IRELAND 
 
7.  Post is unaware of direct threats against Americans or 
U.S. interests in Ireland, and Ireland remains a relatively 
safe country where anti-American sentiment is rare.  For 
additional threat assessment information regarding Ireland, 
you may contact DS/DSS/ITA (Diplomatic Security\'s Office of 
Intelligence and Threat Assessment) in the State Department 
at 202-663-0787.  TDY visitors staying longer than 30 days 
should schedule a briefing with the Regional Security Officer. 
 
8.  Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin has its 
share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
9.  Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, shares an 
increased threat of terrorist incidents of international 
origin.  Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings 
and report suspicious people or activities to the police or 
RSO.

REF: A) STATE 135512 B) BRUSSELS 2733 
 
Classified By: DCM Jane B. Fort, reason 1.4 (d) 
 
1.   (C)  Per ref A, Ireland has used its January-June 2004 
EU Presidency to maintain a tougher EU line on Cuba in 
support of democracy and human rights.  During its 
Presidency, Ireland led the annual re-evaluation of the 
Common Position. which renewed the criticisms of the Castro 
regime from the prior year.  DFA First Secretary for Latin 
America and the Caribbean Jonathan Conlon told Poloff that 
the \"political freeze\" had blocked dialogue with and EU aid 
to Cuba, but that Ireland would not be deterred in advancing 
the Common Position goals of democratic reform. 
 
2.   (SBU)  Conlon referred to statements issued by the Irish 
EU Presidency in May and June of this year, condemning the 
trials and sentencing of human rights activists and 
journalists, and calling on the Cuban authorities to release 
all political prisoners. 
 
3.  (C)  Ireland shares our goals and objectives of reform in 
Cuba, and has worked hard - and successfully - throughout its 
Presidency to repair and renew TransAtlantic cooperation on 
foreign policy.  We agree with USEU\'s assessment (ref B) that 
an imposition of Title III measures against Ireland, as an EU 
member, would be highly counterproductive to our efforts to 
work cooperatively with the Irish and the EU to sustain 
pressure on the Castro regime.

SUMMIT:  LET\'S PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO FOR A CIVIL AVIATION 
DEAL NEXT YEAR 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES KENNY PER 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
 
1.  (U)  EUROPEAN COMMISSION VICE PRESIDENT AND COMMISSIONER 
FOR TRANSPORTATION LOYOLA DE PALACIO MET ON THE MARGINS OF 
THE JUNE 26 US-EU SUMMIT IN DROMOLAND CASTLE IRELAND WITH 
UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND 
AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS ALAN LARSON.  DE PALACIO REQUESTED THE 
MEETING TO DISCUSS PROSPECTS FOR A US-EU CIVIL AVIATION 
AGREEMENT OVER THE  NEXT YEAR.  SHE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE 
EU\'S CHIEF CIVIL AVIATION NEGOTIATOR, MICHAL AYRAL, AND AIDE 
DANIEL CALLEJA.  EUR PDAS RIES AND U.S. NOTETAKERS SAT IN 
WITH U/S LARSON. 
 
2.  (C)  DE PALACIO OPENED BY NOTING THAT SHE HAD INVESTED A 
GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT AND HAD \"DONE THE BEST I COULD\" TO 
SECURE A EU-US DEAL, BUT, IN THE END, RECEIVED A VERY 
DISAPPOINTING ANSWER FROM MEMBER STATES, \"ESPECIALLY THE ONE 
WITH 40 PERCENT OF THE MARKET.\"  SHE NOTED THAT THE MAIN 
PREREQUISITE FOR THE UK IS SECURING RIGHT OF ESTABLISHMENT 
(ROE) IN THE U.S. MARKET WHICH SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THE U.S. HAS 
REPEATEDLY SAID IS NOT POSSIBLE.  SHE SAID, HOWEVER, IF THE 
U.S. DID AGREE TO ROE, \"I COULD INITIAL A DEAL TODAY, WITHOUT 
FURTHER CONSULTATIONS.\"  IF THE U.S. ANSWER TO ROE CONTINUES 
TO BE \"NO\", THEN IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO RESIST THE STRONG 
PRESSURE FROM MEMBER STATES TO MOVE AHEAD WITH DENUNCIATION 
OF THE EXISTING U.S. BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH MEMBER STATES. 
 SHE SAID FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW DENUNCIATION COULD BE 
HELPFUL, AS IT WOULD GIVE U.S. AND EUROPEAN PARTIES A ONE 
YEAR TIMEFRAME TO WORK OUT A NEW ARRANGEMENT.  DE PALACIO 
SAID SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT A DEADLINE A U.S.-EU 
NEGOTIATION COULD DRAG OUT INDEFINITELY. 
 
3.  (C)  LARSON REPLIED THAT THE U.S.-EU DEAL THAT WAS 
REJECTED BY THE EU AT THE JUNE EU TRANSPORT MINISTERS COUNCIL 
WAS OF GREAT BENEFIT TO BOTH SIDES AND ITS REJECTION A LOST 
OPPORTUNITY.  HE CAUTIONED THAT THOSE IN THE EU INSISTING ON 
ROE ARE USING IT AS A MEANS TO KEEP A HAMMERLOCK ON THE 
HEATHROW MARKET; ROE IS A DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE PLOY. 
LARSON SAID IT IS IMPORTANT THAT, IF WE CAN\'T GET A DEAL NOW, 
BOTH SIDES TAKE TIME TO PAUSE, REFLECT, KEEP UP A DIALOGUE, 
AND THEN MEET AGAIN IN THE FALL.  HE STRESSED THAT IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE THE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE THAT ARE 
BENEFICIAL TO BOTH THE U.S. AND EU AND NOT UPSET THE 
CURRENTLY BALANCED TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIP. 
 
4.  (C)  DE PALACIO SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH THE UK HAS 40 PERCENT 
OF THE MARKET, ROE IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT TO IT BUT TO THE 
OTHER MEMBER STATES AS WELL.  SHE ADDED THAT HER RECENT 
PUBLIC COMMENTS ON A JULY 15 DEADLINE FOR AN AGREEMENT 
REFERRED TO THE TIME REMAINING FOR CODIFYING AN AGREEMENT 
PURSUANT TO CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION BUT \"THAT IS CLEARLY 
NOT POSSIBLE NOW.\"  THEREFORE, WE MUST PRESERVE THE CURRENT 
TEXT AS A STARTING POINT TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS AT A LATER 
DATE, WITH THE GOAL OF CONCLUDING A DEAL WITHIN ONE YEAR. 
HOWEVER, SHE CAVEATED THAT SHE CAN\'T PREDICT WHAT THE NEW 
COMMISSION IS GOING TO DO AND IT WILL BE THEIR CALL AS TO 
WHETHER TO SET A DEADLINE FOR CONCLUDING AN AGREEMENT.  SHE 
NOTED THAT SHE MUST STILL DISCUSS FURTHER INTERIM STEPS WITH 
THE COMMISSION IN LIGHT OF THE JUNE TRANSPORT COUNCIL 
RESULTS.  ONE CLEAR RESULT IS THAT U.S. BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS 
WITH TEN MEMBER STATES ARE SUSPENDED.  DE PALACIO ADDED THAT 
THE ECJ RULING HAS HAD A BROAD EFFECT ON EXISTING U.S. 
AGREEMENTS WITH MEMBER STATES AND SHE IS BEING SQUEEZED TO 
DENOUNCE THESE AGREEMENTS.  IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO HOLD THE 
LINE OVER THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS, AND SHE SUGGESTED A TECHNICAL 
MEETING IN JULY TO TRY AND GENERATE SOME FORWARD MOVEMENT. 
EU NEGOTIATOR AYRAL INTERVENED TO SUGGEST THAT SEPTEMBER 
MIGHT BE MORE CONVENIENT AS IT WOULD GIVE MORE TIME TO FLESH 
OUT VIEWS/UNDERSTANDINGS ON THE ROE ISSUE. 
 
5.  (C)  LARSON AGREED THAT SEPTEMBER WOULD BE A USEFUL TIME 
FOR U.S. AND EU EXPERTS TO CONVENE.  IF THE DRAFT AGREEMENT 
NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION COULD BE PRESERVED, IT WOULD ALLOW 
NEW MEMBERS OF THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION AND EU COMMISSION TO 
QUICKLY PICK UP WHERE NEGOTIATIONS LAST CONCLUDED.  LARSON 
STRESSED THAT THE U.S. HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS INTERNAL MARKET 
ISSUES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EU INTERESTS, AS WELL AS 49 
PERCENT RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP.  HE CAUTIONED THAT EU 
DENUNCIATION WAS A ROAD THE EU DID NOT WANT TO TAKE AS IT 
POSED LARGE DANGERS:  EVEN THOUGH DIRECTED AT MEMBER STATES, 
IT WOULD BE VIEWED IN THE U.S. AS VERY THREATENING, 
TANTAMOUNT TO TRADE BREAK/RETALIATION.  FURTHERMORE, IT WOULD 
GIVE GREATER LEVERAGE TO THOSE FORCES OPPOSED TO A DEAL BY 
RAISING THE PRICE, CREATING EVEN GREATER HURDLES/ROADBLOCKS 
FOR THE NEW TEAMS.  LARSON SUGGESTED THAT THE FOCUS SHOULD 
NOW BE ON LEAVING A CIVAIR \"ROADMAP\" FOR THE SUCCESSORS, 
NOTING THAT THE U.S. HAS ALWAYS BEEN WILLING TO ADDRESS 
ISSUES RAISED BY THE ECJ.   LARSON SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN 
REFLECTING A GREAT DEAL ON THE UPCOMING POLITICAL TRANSITION 
PERIOD COINCIDING -- UNUSUALLY -- ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
ATLANTIC.  HE AGREED THAT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT DURING THE 
REMAINING MONTHS UNTIL THE TRANSITION WAS COMPLETED TO KEEP 
ON AS CONSTRUCTIVE PATH AS POSSIBLE.  \"WE UNDERSTAND THAT ROE 
AND YOUR DIFFICULTIES WITH MEMBER STATES WILL STILL BE 
THERE.\" 
 
6.  (C)  DE PALACIO AGREED THAT THE RISK OF FUELING U.S.-EU 
TRADE TENSIONS WAS THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE TO EU DENUNCIATION OF 
EXISTING AGREEMENTS.  WHILE NOTING THAT SHE COULDN\'T GIVE A 
FULL ANSWER TODAY, SHE WOULD TRY TO FIND A WAY TO GET MEMBER 
STATE APPROVAL FOR DEFERRING DENUNCIATION TO HER SUCCESSOR. 
DE PALACIO STRESSED THAT WHILE DENUNCIATION CAN BE DELAYED, 
THE NEXT COMMISSION WILL HAVE TO ACT IF THERE IS NO U.S.-EU 
AGREEMENT.  SHE HOPED THAT THE TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS IN 
SEPTEMBER WOULD MORE CLEARLY DEFINE THE POINTS OF DIFFICULTY 
FOR THE NEW TEAM AND CREATE A STARTING POINT FOR CONCLUDING 
NEGOTIATIONS.

SUBJECT: GOI SHOULD SUPPORT US REVCON AIMS, BUT EXPECT A 
PUSH ON DISARMAMENT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 139286 
 
1.  Summary.  Emboff delivered reftel points to Sarah 
McGrath, Deputy Director, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation 
Section of the DFA.  The GOI agrees that proliferation via a 
vis Iran and the DPRK is a serious problem and supports USG 
non-proliferation efforts.  However, McGrath reminded emboff 
that \"compliance with the NPT is important and indivisible\", 
and the Irish strongly support a balanced approach to the 
RevCon that focuses equally on proliferation and disarmament. 
 End Summary 
 
The PrepCom 
----------- 
 
2.  The GOI shares the USG,s disappointment with the 
PrepCom,s results.  While the GOI believes there was a good 
exchange of views on the substantive issues, the Irish would 
have preferred to see some substantive recommendations for 
the RevCon.  The GOI is happy that many procedural issues 
were settled.  The RevCon agenda is a priority, and should be 
settled as quickly as possible.  Privately, McGrath confided 
that Sudjadnan was an extremely ineffective chair and that 
this contributed to the disappointing results.  The GOI does 
expect their Permrep in Geneva to play a role in the RevCon. 
 
Non-Compliance Is a Problem 
--------------------------- 
 
3.  The GOI agrees that non-compliance with the NPT is a 
serious problem.  On Iran-- McGrath reminded emboff that the 
EU has a common position on Iran, and that it is one that the 
Irish support.  McGrath agreed that the issue should be 
discussed in consultations prior to the RevCon, but noted 
\"it,s hard to know what,s going to happen in a year.\"  She 
added that the upcoming Iran/IAEA board meetings will clarify 
issues and give us a better picture of the situation.  On the 
DPRK -- the GOI believes this problem has moved beyond the 
NPT for the time being, but that if the DPRK does ultimately 
decide to honor its treaty obligations the GOI (and probably 
the EU) would be more comfortable with the position that the 
DPRK never left the treaty. 
 
4. The GOI strongly supports the USG,s efforts to make 
ratification of the Additional Protocol a condition of 
membership for the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  The GOI would 
like to see something to this effect in the Outcome Document. 
 
 
But Don,t Lose Focus on Disarmament 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  The GOI is very concerned about proliferation, but it 
sees disarmament as an equally important issue.  McGrath 
repeatedly emphasized that any review of the NPT must be 
balanced.  The GOI does not want to lose focus on disarmament 
in pursuit of non-proliferation, and does not want to see a 
one-sided RevCon in which the declared states force 
concessions on non-proliferation while avoiding any serious 
commitments to disarm.  The GOI also strongly opposes 
treating disarmament commitments less seriously than 
non-proliferation commitments.  McGrath stressed that if the 
non-proliferation provisions are legally binding, the 
disarmament provisions must be as well.  The GOI feels it 
will be easier to gain concessions on proliferation if the 
declared states show they are sensitive to Non-nuclear 
states\' disarmament concerns. 
 
Peaceful Use Is Not a High Salience Issue 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  Possible interference with peaceful uses in order to halt 
proliferation is not a major concern for the GOI because 
Ireland does not use nuclear energy and has no plans to do 
so.  However, the GOI is sensitive to the concerns of 
developing nations on this issue and does not want to see it 
turned into a north/south battle.  The GOI is only concerned 
about this issue so far as it affects the NPT, but still 
looks forward to consultations on either a bilateral or EU 
level.  McGrath did remind emboff that the Euratom treaty 
could complicate matters (because there can be no 
discrimination among EU member states with regard to atomic 
energy). 
 
Keep Up The Good Work With Article VI Communication 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  Disarmament has traditionally been an important issue for 
Ireland and other non-aligned countries, and they want 
information about the disarmament efforts of the declared 
nuclear powers.  McGrath said that the GOI notes USG Article 
VI efforts, and commends USG transparency on this issue.  She 
added that the USG does a much better job communicating on 
this subject then some of the other declared states.  While 
the USG,s annual presentation on disarmament is very good, 
the USG might consider submitting a more official \"annual 
report\".

SUBJECT: GOI \"OF ONE MIND\" WITH USG ON DARFUR 
 
REF: SECSTATE 145183 
 
 1. Summary.  Emboff delivered reftel talking points to Don 
Sexton and Brid McGraw of the DFA.  The GOI is strongly 
committed to alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, 
and promises robust support for USG efforts in the region. 
The GOI remains politically engaged at both the bilateral and 
the EU level.  Minister of State Tom Kitt will visit the 
Sudan in the near future, and the GOI will press to keep 
Darfur on the EU,s foreign policy priority list.  Besides 
remaining politically engaged, the GOI has provided generous 
humanitarian assistance and anticipates increasing aid levels 
for 2005. 
 
GOI Providing Humanitarian Assistance... 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  Sexton began by summarizing the GOI,s humanitarian 
efforts in Darfur.  To date, the GOI has pledged 2.4 million 
euro, and plans on disbursing 3.75 million euro in 2004. 
Because the GOI sees Darfur as a long-term crisis, it will 
maintain and almost certainly increase its donation for 2005. 
 The GOI has also donated to UNICEF, the ICRC, the World Food 
Program, Oxfam, and Concern.  Finally, the DFA is working 
hard to obtain visas and cut through the red tape the GOS is 
throwing up to block aid flows. 
 
... And Keeping Up the Diplomatic Pressure 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  The GOI plans to ratchet up its already strong political 
efforts and will continue to work both bilaterally and 
through the EU.  Minister of State Tom Kitt will visit the 
Sudan soon and will challenge the GOS to fulfill its promise 
to stop blocking aid to Darfur.  The GOI hopes his visit will 
help sustain the pressure brought by recent high-level USG 
and UN visits to the region. 
 
4.  Darfur will be a major priority for the GOI at Monday,s 
GAERC meeting, and the GOI plans to raise the possibility of 
an EU ministerial visit to the Sudan.  Sexton reminded emboff 
that the Irish Presidency turned Darfur into an EU foreign 
policy priority.  Informally, McGraw told emboff that while 
the Presidency is over, the GOI plans on using some of the 
political capital that follows a successful Presidency to 
push the EU on Darfur. 
 
5.  The GOI is especially concerned about security in the 
refugee camps.  There has been some talk about the African 
Union providing peacekeepers to guard the camps, and the GOI 
plans on raising the possibility during EU-AU consultations. 
The EU already funds the AU monitoring mission, and the GOI 
will press for an increase in funding to help the AU take a 
more active role in managing the crisis.

(C) Emboffs delivered reftel points on July 9 to Deputy 
Political Director Paul Kavanagh.  He offered the following 
comments: 
 
--In regards to the China arms embargo, Kavanagh said that if 
the UK holds a hard line against lifting the embargo, it 
likely will remain in effect; however, if the UK appears to 
be softening then the embargo likely would be lifted. 
 
--In regards to Asia and the EU-ASEM summit, Kavanagh stated 
the Dutch will appoint former Dutch Foreign Minster Hans van 
den Broek to be special envoy for Burma.  He also stated that 
there are differing views within the EU regarding how the 
worsening human rights situation in Burma will effect the 
October EU-ASEM summit.  While Germany, France, Italy, 
Poland, and Austria are willing to accept Burmese 
participation in the summit at the ministerial level (as 
opposed to PM level), the UK is holding firm to the position 
that the EU must take a strong stance (likely in the refusal 
of any Burmese participation) until Burma shows positive 
signs of reform.  Kavanagh stated the issue on how to address 
the Burma situation is unlikely to be resolved until the 
September GAERC.  He said Asian countries were aware of the 
divergent views within the EU and would play on that. 
 
--In regards to Helms-Burton, Kavanagh promised to inform 
Irish Foreign Minister Cowen on the status of Title III of 
the Act and also reiterated Irish concerns that Helms-Burton 
is an extra-territorial law. 
 
--Kavanagh confirmed Iraqi PM Allawi\'s attendance at the 
GAERC and added that reftel items regarding Iraq, 
Afghanistan, and Venezuela are still being considered within 
the EU. Post will report in septel if substantive information 
is made available.

THE INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION 
 
REF: STATE 145797 
 
1.  Summary.  Irish IWC Commissioner O\'Grady stated that 
Ireland\'s positions follow closely with all US positions 
mentioned in reftel.  O\'Grady, however, did elaborate on 
Ireland\'s positions regarding sanctuaries, and finance and 
administration.  O\'Grady stated that the GOI believes 
sanctuaries are undermined unless all IWC members agree to 
them; thus, Ireland will abstain on votes to create new 
sanctuaries unless there is consensus.  O\'Grady also stated 
the GOI shares the USG concern regarding the financial 
situation of the IWC and would advocate bi-annual meetings 
and the maintaining of English as the working language of the 
IWC to minimize costs.  End Summary. 
 
SANCTUARIES 
=========== 
 
2.  Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on July 9 with 
Chris O\'Grady, Director of National Parks and Wildlife at the 
Department of the Environment and Ireland\'s Commissioner to 
the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  Regarding 
sanctuaries, O\'Grady stated Ireland would abstain from all 
votes calling for the creation of new sanctuaries unless 
there is a consensus because the GOI believes sanctuaries are 
undermined unless IWC countries fully abide by them.  O\'Grady 
cited Japan as a prime example of a country that does not 
respect sanctuary boundaries.  O\'Grady also said that by 
abstaining the GOI wants to be seen as a country that favors 
conservation but also understands the concerns of countries 
that advocate increased whaling.  This, the GOI hopes, will 
allow Ireland to be seen as a country that can facilitate 
agreement between opposing sides.  He stated Ireland would 
continue to support the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. 
 
FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION 
========================== 
 
3.  O\'Grady stated that the GOI shares USG concerns regarding 
the IWC\'s financial situation.  O\'Grady stated that with new 
francophone members being admitted there may be a movement to 
implement translation of all IWC conferences and materials to 
other languages besides the working language of English.  He 
stated that while the GOI understands the reasoning behind 
the possibly proposal, it would be concerned about the cost 
translation would entail.  O\'Grady also stated that he 
previously suggested that the IWC meet on a bi-annual basis 
as opposed to annually.  Besides lowering costs, O\'Grady 
suggested that this would give countries \"time to catch their 
breath\" before the next meeting, possibly reducing the 
polarization experienced at the present annual meetings. 
According to O\'Grady, the Norwegians already expressed 
support to him for bi-annual meetings.

SUBJECT: IRISH RESPOND POSITIVELY TO REQUEST FOR CONTINUED 
SUPPORT IN DARFUR 
 
REF: STATE 153857 
 
1.  Summary.  Irish officials Don Sexton and Pat Kelly 
responded positively to the request for European support for 
deployment of an African Union (AU) protection force.  Both 
stressed Ireland\'s interest in African affairs, especially 
regarding humanitarian aid.  Ireland has given nearly three 
million euros in assistance for basic needs in Darfur and 
plans to lend more financial assistance upon the Minister of 
State for Development Tom Kitt\'s return from Darfur. End 
Summary. 
 
2.  Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on July 15 with 
Don Sexton, First Secretary in the Development Cooperation 
Division at the DFA.  Sexton stated that Ireland already 
supports the AU Mission in Sudan and that EU funding for the 
mission was fast-tracked during the Irish Presidency. 
Ireland also provides one of the EU observers in Darfur. 
Sexton informed emboff that Minister of State for Development 
Tom Kitt is in Darfur and is planning additional GOI 
contributions based upon his findings in the region.  Sexton, 
while not being able to provide an exact amount, stated he 
was confident the new funding would exceed the previous 2.9 
million euro donation. Sexton continued to stress that 
Ireland\'s main goal for the next 12-18 months is to meet 
Darfur\'s humanitarian needs, such as food and health care. 
 
3.  In regards to the GOI\'s willingness to play a direct role 
in organizing and deploying an international protection 
force, Sexton stated that Ireland is willing to listen to all 
suggestions and initiatives but generally follows a UN 
mandate. Sexton could not supply specifics in terms of what 
types of support could be expected from the GOI in the future. 
 
4.  Following the meeting with Sexton, emboff spoke with Pat 
Kelly, Deputy Director of African Affairs at the DFA.  Kelly 
reiterated the points made by Sexton in the earlier meeting, 
stressing Ireland\'s interest in Sudan and the GOI\'s 
willingness to assist the AU.  Kelly stated that their 
primary efforts will continue to go towards the AU mission, 
but they are willing to examine further initiatives.  Kelly 
also stressed that the GOI will continue to work within the 
UN.

CLOSE A DEAL 
 
REF: LONDON 4943 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR JAMES KENNY PER 1.4 (B) AND (D) 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  U.S. Special Envoy for Northern Ireland 
Mitchell Reiss  met on June 30 in Dublin with Irish Prime 
Minister Ahern and Foreign  Minister Brian Cowen to review 
Irish/British efforts to lay the ground work for another 
effort at restoring devolved government in NI.   Ahern 
confirmed that he and British PM Blair are prepared to host 
one last round of \"hot house\" negotiations with Sinn Fein 
(SF) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in the middle of 
September at a remote site in Scotland on an agreement to 
restore devolved government in Northern Ireland (NI).  If 
those talks fail, Ahern indicated that a \"plan B\" (along the 
lines suggested by the Social Democratic Labour Party (SDLP)) 
for standing up NI institutions with a caretaker technocratic 
government might be worth considering.  Subsequently, 
however, key Irish officials told the Ambassador and DCM that 
the GOI does not wish to float any notions of a \"plan B\" in 
advance of September meetings.  Ahern and Cowen both 
expressed concern that the traditional July-August summer 
holiday season may keep SF and DUP from adequately preparing 
for intensive negotiations in early September.  Cowen will 
have staff here in August working on plans.  End Summary 
 
MEETING WITH PM AHERN: THERE ARE DANGERS WITH A PLAN B 
BUT SDLP PROPOSAL MAY HAVE SOME MERIT 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (C) Attending with PM Ahern were his senior foreign 
policy advisor, Michael Collins, and Assistant Secretary Paul 
McGarry.  Accompanying Special Envoy Reiss were Ambassador 
Kenny, S/P Green, and Emboff.  Ahern said that there must be 
a concerted effort in September to get a SF-DUP deal; \"we 
can\'t keep going the way we have been.\"  He agreed with 
Reiss\' observation that the key ingredients for an agreement 
are convincing the parties that September is a make-or-break 
situation, helping SF leader Gerry Adams do a deal, and 
getting DUP commitments on implementation (of the deal). 
Also, there must be a credible \"plan B\" in reserve.  Ahern 
noted that SF now has the political power and position to 
move forward, \"but I don\'t know if they will.\"  Ahern said 
that he was impressed with the DUP, but its proposed 
six-month hiatus (between a deal and implementation) is a 
non-starter because republicans will not accept that long 
gap; and it brings events too close to UK elections and 
Blair\'s upcoming (1/1/05) responsibilities as G-8 Chairman 
and EU President. 
 
3.  (C) Reiss agreed that DUP was showing an encouraging 
willingness to engage, adding that the parties can always 
negotiate an agreement in principle and a shorter timeframe 
for implementation, such as three months.  The key is 
implementation because it is unrealistic to expect SF to \"pay 
up front\" with no guarantee of a deal.  Ahern said the 
elements of a deal are clear, but it is important to keep all 
of the other parties involved as well.  The last elections 
virtually eliminated the PUP and the Women\'s Coalition; the 
Alliance Party is significantly weakened; and SDLP and the 
UUP could lose all their Westminster seats in the next 
general election (to SF and DUP). 
 
4.  (C) Ahern said SF and the DUP cannot be allowed to hold 
up the entire devolution process indefinitely.  He noted that 
Blair,s October 2002 &Acts of Completion8 speech in 
Belfast failed spectacularly to bolster moderate unionism and 
the DUP continues to gain at UUP\'s expense.  The question is 
how to pressure the DUP to deal?  Ahern said two points were 
certain:  SF can\'t be excluded from a deal, and it must be 
done within the parameters of the Good Friday Agreement 
(GFA).  Without it, nationalist voters will walk away, and 
the NI public generally will grow more skeptical of 
devolution.  For this reason, of the plan B proposals being 
circulated, the SDLP,s proposal or some variation &is not a 
bad one.8 (Note: SDLP recently proposed that the two 
governments (London and Dublin) nominate 10 administrators 
for the 10 government departments in order to get some form 
of devolved government up and running.  End note.) 
 
5. (C)  Reiss said the U.S. agreed there are merits to the 
SDLP,s proposal.  Moreover, the threat of a viable plan B 
might be a useful inducement to get the parties to deal in 
September.  Reiss asked what Dublin and London were doing to 
prepare the ground for September and offered to send Ahern 
some thoughts on this soon.  Ahern said there were better 
prospects for success in September if the parties were 
working off one text that ring-fenced areas of agreement and 
bracketed the major remaining unresolved issues: fulfilling 
commitments under the Joint Declaration, the Finucane 
inquiry, On The Runs (OTRs), and release of the murderers of 
Garda Gerry McCabe.  Reiss asked whether the Finucane case 
was a potential deal breaker.  Ahern said it is not a 
republican, but a nationalist, issue.  Because there is such 
broad-based support across the nationalist community in the 
North for an inquiry, SF will insist on it.  Ahern added that 
the results of a Finucane inquiry report tomorrow would not 
surprise anyone and \"Tony (Blair) knows what he has to do.\" 
(Comment: Presumably, that the PM will have to overrule 
elements of the security-legal establishments to see that 
some form of public inquiry is held.  End comment.) 
 
6.  (C)  Taioseach advisor Collins noted that SF knows there 
can be no deal without decommissioning - \"everyone knows what 
needs to be done.\"  Ahern added that another secret 
decommissioning act will not work; SF must understand that 
without transparency it will get no credit from DUP leader 
Paisley.  Ahern noted that a clergyman in contact with Adams 
(Church of Ireland (Episcopal) leader Archbishop Eames) might 
act as a witness.  His participation might be seen by 
unionists as lending credibility.  Ahern said that the way to 
get SF on the policing boards is a deal that devolves 
policing/justice relatively quickly in exchange for an end to 
paramilitary activity and complete decommissioning.  But, he 
added, DUP does not yet understand this.  Reiss said that he 
would reinforce this when he met with DUP leaders on July 28. 
 
MEETING WITH FM COWEN: GOI READY FOR 
FULL COURT PRESS IN SEPTEMBER 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C) Reiss subsequently met with Irish Foreign Minister 
Brian Cowen, who was accompanied by DFA SecGen Dermot 
Gallagher, Anglo-Irish Division Head Brendan Scannell, and 
DFA officials Dermot Brangan and Kate Slattery.  Cowen said 
that, even though DUP leader Paisley wants to do a deal, the 
main worry going into the September talks is that the parties 
will delay an agreement to get a better deal:  \"this is why 
we discuss plan Bs.\" Cowen added that, nonetheless, the GOI 
is going into September \"with all guns blazing.\"  Reiss asked 
what will the market bear in terms of pain to the parties. 
That is, he suggested that the parties discuss a plan B 
publicly and privately to pressure both the DUP and SF. 
Reiss added that SF-DUP dialogue over the next two months 
approaching September is critical and asked whether a &stick 
and carrot8 approach to Sinn Fein (SF) might be adopted and 
result in forward motion.  Scannell cautioned that it is 
difficult to find a stick that won\'t alienate SF and 
destabilize/set back the entire process.  Cowen reiterated PM 
Ahern\'s endorsement that talks in September focus around a 
bracketed text. 
 
8.  (C) Cowen said that the key factor at present is the DUP 
willingness to pre-cook a deal.  This should allow SF to 
seriously engage, get an agreement, and then proceed with 
sequencing.  In terms of offering a carrot, Scannell 
suggested that the DUP needs to feel &flattered.8  He noted 
that party members are visiting the Kennedy School of 
Government in Harvard during the month of July, and it may be 
opportune to invite them to Washington for consultations and 
to drive home the message that the opportunity for a deal is 
there. Cowen said that the DUP must understand that changes 
on Strand One of the GFA would need to be offset by changes 
to Strand Two.  He added that the issue of First Minister and 
Deputy First Minister must be resolved sooner rather than 
later.  On decommissioning, Cowen suggested that one way to 
get transparency without breaching confidentiality would be 
to publish retrospectively the index listing a full inventory 
of guns and explosives following total decommissioning. 
 
9. (C)  Reiss asked how firm was the DUP\'s demand for a 
six-month &decontamination8 period prior to SF taking seats 
at the Executive table.  Cowen replied that 6 months is a 
negotiating position, and \"in fairness\" DUP is ready to do a 
\"big bang\" deal now.  Cowen noted that the devolution of 
justice is a critical issue for SF, and Finucane is a 
potential deal breaker -- it is a &hot button topic8 that 
is not going to go away.

concerned about the ongoing violence in Nepal, the EU is not 
ready to designate the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) as a 
terrorist organization.  The possibility was discussed at the 
June clearinghouse but the EU decided not to act, fearing 
that to do so would harden the CPN\'s position and close off 
the possibility of negotiations with the GON.  However, if 
the CPN does not make a good faith effort to negotiate with 
the new GON, the EU would consider designating the CPN as a 
terrorist organization and take appropriate action.  The EU 
will review the matter at the September clearinghouse, but 
the decision may be put off until October to allow for 
discussion at the September GAERC meeting.  Brady said it was 
\"possible\" that the clearinghouse would designate the CPN if 
it proves unwilling to enter into serious dialogue with the 
GON. 
 
2.  In addition, the Dutch Presidency will issue a statement 
on Nepal in the near future.  The statement will call on the

of the conflict.

Gallagher stated the GOI seriously considered becoming a

8.  Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin has its 
share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
9.  Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, shares an

ISSUES 
 
REF: A. STATE 168348 
 
     B. STATE 129597 
 
1.  On August 9, Post delivered ref A\'s talking points to 
Micheal O\'Mealoid and Niamh O\'Brien, Department of Transport 
Assistant Principals for Aviation Regulation and 
International Relations.  O\'Mealoid noted that several 
Department officials involved in ICAO issues, principally 
Robin McKay, Assistant Director General for Aviation, were on 
leave and that the GOI would refine its positions for the 
ICAO General Assembly upon their return.  O\'Mealoid, however, 
did give preliminary responses to ref A\'s talking points, per 
below. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Universal Safety Oversight Audit Program (USOAP) 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
2.  O\'Mealoid said he did not expect Ireland to have 
difficulties with U.S. positions on USOAP.  Specifically, 
Ireland would likely concur with U.S. suggestions for ICAO to 
provide full final audit reports to Contracting States and 
for the USOAP audit team to validate a Contracting State\'s 
statements on implementing ICAO standards or accomplishing 
corrective measures. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Regional Safety Oversight Organizations 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3.  Ireland supports regional safety oversight organizations 
and initiatives, as reflected in EU Member States\' support 
for the European Single Sky, the European Civil Aviation 
Conference (ECAC), and the European Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA). 
 
-------------------------------- 
Environment -- Emissions Charges 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  O\'Mealoid said that there was no Irish deviation from the 
EU position, which favors the implementation of CO2 emissions 
charges on planes flying in European airspace.  He added that 
Ireland would concur with the talking point that such charges 
would only cut CO2 emissions by cutting demand. 
 
--------------------------------- 
Flight Information Regions (FIRs) 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  Ireland agrees in principle with the U.S. position that 
ICAO should base its decisions regarding the allocation of 
airspace in FIRs on operational efficiency of air traffic 
management, according to O\'Mealoid.  He observed that Ireland 
was negotiating to take over from the UK the management of a 
North Atlantic flight information bloc.  He underscored that 
this would simply be a change in operational oversight, not 
partition of an existing FIR. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Increasing Electronic Communications 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  O\'Mealoid noted that Ireland would not have difficulty 
with the U.S. recommendation to limit the delivery of 
hard-copy documents to countries that can receive them 
electronically. 
 
--------------------------- 
U.S. ICAO Council Candidacy 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  In regard to ref B\'s talking points, O\'Mealoid said that 
Transport Department officials and Ireland\'s Mission to ICAO 
had received demarches from other countries seeking election 
to the ICAO Council and were now evaluating the candidates. 
He added that he would be surprised if Ireland did not 
support the U.S. bid for reelection to Part 1 of the ICAO 
Council, given the importance of the United States in 
international aviation. 
 
---------------- 
Irish Delegation 
---------------- 
 
8.  Anne McGinley, Ireland\'s Representative to ICAO, will 
lead the Irish delegation at the ICAO General Assembly.  The 
Transport Department\'s Assistant Director General for 
Aviation, Robin McKay, will be part of the delegation, which 
will also include at least one Department of Foreign Affairs 
official.  A final delegation list will probably not be 
available until early September.  (Econoff provided to 
O\'Mealoid and O\'Brien the letter of invitation to 
Transportation Secretary Mineta\'s lunch on September 28.)

1.  On August 11, Post delivered ref A\'s requested demarche

EU concerns about rising tensions in Moldova/Transnistria and

process.  She added that the EU concurred with the USG\'s 
position on the importance of transparency in the Russian 
Government\'s efforts to engage Moldovan and Transnistrian

2.  Consistent with ref B, Connelly mentioned that an EU 
delegation departed for the region on August 9 and was 
scheduled to meet that evening in Chisinau with Heads of EU 
Member States\' Missions and the representative of the OSCE. 
On August 10, the delegation was scheduled to consult with

delegation was due to travel to Kiev to meet with Ukrainian 
authorities.  Donnelly expected that a report on the trip\'s

Moldovan-language school closures.  The summer leave season 
in Brussels had delayed the process, however.

 1.  On August 11, Post delivered reftel\'s requested demarche 
to Brian Muldoon, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) First 
Secretary for Latin America and the Caribbean.  Muldoon noted 
 
SIPDIS 
that Ireland had participated in extensive EU consultations 
on Venezuela and endorsed the August 3 EU declaration on the 
importance of the August 15 referendum.  He observed that the 
EU declaration supported the observer mission that the OAS 
and Carter Center would perform.  He added that Ireland 
concurred with the EU\'s decision not to play an observer\'s 
role, given the restrictions that the Chavez Government 
attempted to place on the size of the EU observer team, its 
freedom of publicity, and the duration of its mission.  An 
observer team acting under such conditions would have lacked 
credibility, explained Muldoon.  He added that Ireland, 
having no embassy in Caracas, would likely not make a 
national-level statement on the referendum. 
 
2.  An August 9 Irish Times report on Venezuela had a 
pro-Chavez slant, with the journalist comparing Venezuelan 
opposition activists in Miami to the anti-Castro Cuban 
population in the city.  The report noted that, under Chavez, 
life expectancy in Venezuela had increased, infant mortality 
rates had dropped, school attendance had risen, and civil 
rights had expanded.  The report concluded that the 
opposition faced an uphill battle to unseat Chavez.

SUBJECT: IRELAND HAILS MCCREEVY\'S COMMISSION APPOINTMENT 
 
REF: DUBLIN 911 
 
1.  Irish political and business circles hailed Finance 
Minister Charlie McCreevy\'s August 12 appointment as EU 
Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services, one of the 
Commission\'s premier economic portfolios.  The post is widely 
viewed as a reward for Ireland\'s successful turn in the EU 
Presidency this past year.  Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who 
in July had proposed McCreevy for the Commission, expressed 
\"delight\" with the appointment in August 12 press comments. 
Ahern noted that McCreevy \"had overseen and managed 
unprecedented growth in Ireland for the past seven years as 
Finance Minister\" and \"had the political expertise and 
experience ... to deliver tangible benefits to all EU 
citizens.\"  Ireland\'s opposition parties, including Fine 
Gael, Labor, the Greens, and Sinn Fein, commended McCreevy\'s 
qualifications for the Commission, with Labor urging him to 
\"promote the interests of the consumers and workers of 
Europe, rather than simply big business.\"  Financial Services 
Ireland, one of several business groups to laud McCreevy\'s 
appointment, noted that his task as Commissioner to expand 
the EU\'s internal market into financial services would 
benefit Ireland\'s small, open economy.  McCreevy\'s move to 
the Commission clears the way for a Cabinet shuffle in 
September, which PM Ahern promised after his party, Fianna 
Fail (the Irish Parliament\'s majority party, which currently 
maintains a ruling coalition with the Progressive Democrats) 
fared poorly in June 11 local and European Parliament 
elections (reftel). 
 
--------------------------------- 
McCreevy\'s Biographic Information 
--------------------------------- 
 
2.  McCreevy has a reserved persona and is an accountant by 
training.  He entered the Irish Parliament (the Dail) in 1977 
as Fianna Fail representative for the Kildare North 
constituency and made his mark as a strident opponent of then 
Prime Minister Charles Haughey.  In 1992, he joined the 
Cabinet as Minister for Social Welfare and then worked 
briefly as Minister for Tourism and Trade before serving as 
Fianna Fail\'s front-bench spokesman on finance in 1995. 
McCreevy became Finance Minister in 1997 on the heels of 
Bertie Ahern\'s election as prime minister.  In seven years at 
Finance, he advocated low taxation, strict fiscal discipline, 
increased competition, open trade and investment, and an 
overall liberal, market-led approach to public policy.  While 
he is credited with overseeing Ireland\'s emergence as the 
\"Celtic Tiger,\" his opponents say that his tight management 
of public finances during the downturn that followed the 
dotcom crash came at the expense of public services.  He has 
a close friendship with both PM Ahern and Deputy 
PM/Progressive Democrat party leader Mary Harney and is 
reputedly on excellent terms with incoming Commission 
President Barroso.

4. (C) Manahan asked for additional input from the USG on

INITIATIVES 
 
REF: STATE 177369 
 
1.  Summary: Ireland is skeptical of innovative financing 
mechanisms for Official Development Assistance (ODA), such as 
the International Financing Facility and global taxation 
schemes.  The Irish Government, however, has not been public 
about its skepticism, due to diverse opinions among EU Member 
States on such mechanisms.  GOI development officials would 
appreciate Department guidance on how the USG intends to 
coordinate with other donors in African countries eligible 
for Millennium Challenge Account assistance.  End summary. 
 
2.  On August 24, Post delivered reftel talking points to 
Frank Sheridan and Thomas Haney, Counsellors for Programme 
Countries and Multilateral Assistance, respectively, in the 
Development Corporation Ireland (DCI, the Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DFA) division responsible for GOI foreign 
assistance).  Julian Clare, First Secretary in the DFA\'s UN 
Section, also participated. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Ireland Increasing ODA, But Skeptical of IFF 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  Ireland shares U.S. commitments to economic development 
and sees conventional forms of Official Development 
Assistance (ODA) as the primary mechanism to redress poverty, 
observed Haney.  He noted that Irish ODA had doubled since 
2000 to reach 0.4 percent of GNP.  The GOI planned further 
increases in ODA, but was uncertain of attaining an ODA level 
of 0.7 percent of GDP by 2007, in keeping with Millennium 
Declaration commitments made by Prime Minister Ahern.  (Irish 
GNP is noticeably lower than GDP, given significant 
productivity by foreign-owned firms in the high-tech sector.) 
 Haney said the GOI had taken serious note of UN assessments 
that an additional USD 50 billion in ODA per year was 
required to achieve Millennium Declaration goals, 
particularly in Africa.  The GOI\'s impression, he added, was 
that Africa has slipped several notches on the U.S. 
development agenda, given onerous U.S. commitments in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 
 
4.  Like the USG, the GOI was skeptical of innovative 
financing mechanisms for ODA, such as the International 
Financing Facility (IFF), observed Haney.  He said that such 
proposals were well-intentioned, but failed to address 
important questions, including how IFF-issued bonds would be 
repaid.  More importantly, the IFF proposal distracted 
countries from their Millennium development commitments to 
raise ODA levels.  Haney said that the GOI would not publicly 
oppose the IFF proposal, given diverse opinions among EU 
Member States on the subject.  He mentioned that the UK, 
France, and Sweden supported the IFF idea, while Germany and 
the Netherlands saw the proposal as adding additional 
complexity to ODA financing.  Haney believed that any 
statement by the EU Presidency on the IFF would be a 
lowest-common-denominator pronouncement urging further 
reflection on the proposal. 
 
5.  The UK had specifically pressed Ireland to make funding 
commitments to an IFF-like pilot project in 2005 for 
financing vaccines, noted Haney.  HMG planned to develop the 
project with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and 
Immunization (GAVI), an international coalition of public and 
private partners that is funded primarily by the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation.  According to Haney, the GOI had 
promised to consider the UK\'s offer, but would likely not 
participate, due partly to uncertainty about GAVI\'s role.  He 
added, however, that the GOI would not come out publicly 
against the proposal. 
 
---------------------- 
Skepticism on Taxation 
---------------------- 
 
6.  Ireland was even more skeptical of global taxation 
schemes as ODA financing mechanisms, said Haney.  Sheridan 
explained that such schemes would only work if accepted by 
all major economies, which would require impossibly long 
negotiations and cross-border harmonization of tax policies. 
He noted that the Irish Department of Finance viewed tax as a 
sovereign issue and would thus oppose moves toward 
harmonization.  Moreover, proposed global tax schemes had not 
clarified the mechanisms for channeling collected revenues to 
developing countries.  Sheridan argued that global taxation, 
like IFF proposals, acted as an \"escape valve\" to divert 
international attention from commitments to increase ODA 
levels in accord with the Monterrey Consensus. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
President Lula\'s World Leaders Meeting 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  Haney and Sheridan expected that Prime Minister Ahern 
would decline the invitation to participate in President 
Lula\'s September 20 World Leaders Meeting on Financing Hunger 
and Poverty Eradication.  The GOI would likely send a 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) representative, though it 
was unclear who.  Sheridan pointed out that Prime Minister 
Ahern planned to appoint a new Foreign Minister in an 
anticipated September Cabinet reshuffle, which would affect 
the availability of DFA personnel for the World Leaders 
Meeting.  Whoever attended, said Haney, would take part in a 
listening mode only.  He added that Ireland saw the meeting 
as an attempt to influence subsequent UNGA discussion on 
Millennium development goals, perhaps even to press for a 
UNGA resolution on innovative ODA financing mechanisms.  A 
UNGA resolution of this sort would be problematic for 
Ireland, since it would force the GOI to make public its 
opposition to IFF-like proposals. 
 
------------------------------ 
Coordination on MCA Assistance 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  The GOI had questions as to how Millennium Challenge 
Account (MCA) assistance would affect ongoing Irish 
development programs in Lesotho and Mozambique, two countries 
identified as eligible for MCA funds, said Sheridan.  The 
GOI, for example, had funded education projects in Lesotho 
for 30 years, but had had difficulties working with the 
Lesotho Government to make the projects successful.  Sheridan 
noted GOI concerns that a significant injection of MCA funds 
into Lesotho would be a \"welcome distraction\" for the 
Government from other donors\' existing programs.  He said his 
impression was that the USG had left MCA-eligible countries 
to drive the process of identifying projects for funding, 
allowing recipient governments to focus on large 
infrastructure programs.  Sheridan mentioned Lesotho\'s 
possible plans to use MCA assistance for an earlier conceived 
water project that had serious environmental implications. 
He asked whether Post could clarify how the USG intended to 
coordinate with other donors in MCA-eligible countries. 
 
9.  Comment: Post would appreciate, via e-mail to econoff Joe 
Young, any general guidance from MCC or EB/IFD that we could 
provide to Sheridan and Haney on the coordination issue, 
particularly with regard to Lesotho and Mozambique, if 
possible.  Alternatively, it would help if we could suggest a 
contact point in MCC or EB/IFD with whom the Irish Embassy in 
Washington could follow up.  Sheridan mentioned vaguely that 
his office had made an unsuccessful attempt to engage the 
State Department in 2003 on development questions.

SUBJECT: FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNS BOOKS, MEETS PM 
AHERN 
 
 
1.  Summary:  Former President Bill Clinton and Senator 
Hillary Clinton paid a private visit to Dublin August 24 - 
26.  While the main purpose of Clinton\'s trip was to promote 
his new book, he and the Senator also met with PM Ahern over 
dinner and a reception that included other ministers. 
Clinton publicly expressed optimism on Northern Ireland (NI) 
and accepted a GOI donation of approximately $7.2 million to 
kick-start a cooperative HIV/AIDS program in Mozambique 
involving the Irish Government and the Clinton Foundation. 
End Summary. 
 
============================================= =============== 
Clinton Meets with GOI Officials, Is Positive about Northern 
Ireland Peace Process, Receives Donation 
============================================= =============== 
 
2.  While in Dublin, the former President and Senator Hillary 
Clinton met privately with PM Bertie Ahern for an hour, 
followed by a dinner and reception hosted by the PM.  Several 
government ministers attended the reception, including 
Minster for Communications Dermot Ahern, Minister for 
Education Noel Dempsey, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs 
Tom Kitt, Minister for State for Europe Dick Roche, and the 
Attorney General Rory Brady.  Prior to the reception, former 
President Clinton told reporters that he was in a \"listening 
mode\" for the visit and was hopeful that progress could be 
made in the upcoming September talks on Northern Ireland.  He 
expressed optimism at recent constructive statements by Sinn 
Fein President Gerry Adams and Democratic Ulster Party (DUP) 
deputy leader Peter Robinson. 
 
3.  At the reception, Minister Kitt announced a contribution 
of $7.2 million to kick-start a cooperative HIV/AIDS program 
in Mozambique involving the Irish Government and the Clinton 
Foundation, the former president\'s charitable trust. 
 
======================= 
Media Reaction Positive 
======================= 
 
4.  At a book signing in Dublin on August 25, approximately 
1,500 people queued three hours for the event.  News articles 
focused on the former president\'s continued popularity in 
Ireland and the contents of his book.  Most articles were 
positive and reported large crowds that met him at his stops 
around Dublin.  Saturday\'s Irish Times, however, reported 
that a crowd jeered the Clintons outside the Clinton Centre 
for International Peace in Northern Ireland.  Apparently, the 
crowd was disappointed when the Clintons left the Centre 
without first crossing the road to meet them.

     B. DUBLIN 1260 
 
1.  On August 31, Post delivered ref A talking points on U.S. 
initiatives for the 59th UN General Assembly to John Deady 
and Julian Clare, Director and First Secretary, respectively, 
of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) UN Section. 
 
---------------- 
Economic Freedom 
---------------- 
 
2.  Ireland adheres to the principles of the Monterrey 
Consensus and is skeptical of innovative financing mechanisms 
for official development assistance, such as the 
International Financing Facility and global taxation schemes, 
said Deady (echoing views of Irish aid officials in ref B). 
Qualifying this remark, Deady noted that Ireland administered 
education programs in developing countries without making 
good governance a condition for assistance, in contrast, he 
said, to the approach used for the Millennium Challenge 
Account.  He explained that Ireland saw this as a 
\"chicken-and-egg situation,\" whereby improvements to primary 
and secondary education in such countries helped to improve 
the prospects for good governance. 
 
---------------------- 
Trafficking in Persons 
---------------------- 
 
3.  Ireland and the EU would support any UN resolution that 
would enhance international efforts to combat trafficking in 
persons (TIP), observed Deady.  He added that TIP was a 
serious problem that would continue to occupy the EU 
Commission\'s Directorate-General for Justice and Home 
Affairs, particularly with the trafficking of young persons 
out of eastern Europe. 
 
------------------- 
Promoting Democracy 
------------------- 
 
4.  Ireland is a member of the Democracy Caucus and supports 
increased cooperation among Caucus members on the promotion 
of human rights and the rule of law, according to Deady. 
Ireland hoped, however, that the Caucus would not complicate 
dealings with non-democracies in the UN on issues with 
cross-cutting interests. 
 
--------------------- 
Banning Human Cloning 
--------------------- 
 
5.  Ireland supported Costa Rica\'s draft UN resolution 
against human cloning, said Deady.  He noted that the cloning 
issue would continue to be divisive within and among EU 
Member States, with the UK the leading proponent of cloning 
research and Belgian and Sweden the strongest opponents. 
 
----------------------------- 
Reducing Middle East Tensions 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  Ireland would prefer to have fewer UN Middle East 
resolutions and to see EU positions reflected more clearly in 
such resolutions, said Deady.  He recalled that the EU had 
coordinated to vote against or abstain on three Middle East 
resolutions in 2003 that were biased against Israel.  Ireland 
had also sponsored a UN resolution against anti-Semitism in 
2003, but had withdrawn the measure after failing to receive 
sufficient General Assembly support.  Deady observed that 
there were likely to be more, rather than less, Middle East 
resolutions this year, due to concerns associated with the 
construction of Israel\'s security barrier.  He added his 
impression that a number of Middle East resolutions were not 
so much anti-Israel as pro-Palestinian, emphasizing 
Palestinians\' rights under international law.

SUBJECT: EU/IRELAND: FORMER IRISH PM BRUTON APPOINTED NEXT 
EU AMBASSADOR TO US 
 
 
1.  On September 9, Former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and 
current member of the Irish Parliament John Bruton was 
appointed EU Ambassador to the US.  He is the first EU 
ambassador to the US to be chosen since the European 
Commission\'s decision to give the appointment to a political 
heavyweight in order to gain wider influence in the US. 
Bruton\'s appointment was seen by all major Irish political 
parties as a positive step by the EU to increase its US 
profile and improve US-EU relations.  Newspapers state 
Bruton\'s appointment reflects the EU\'s hope to gain from 
Ireland\'s experience in building contacts with Members of 
Congress.  Bruton, who favors close ties between the US and 
EU, likely will take up his position in the US in November. 
Biographical information follows: 
 
=============== 
John Bruton Bio 
=============== 
 
2.  John Bruton was first elected to the Dail (Irish 
Parliament) in 1969 at the age of 22 and in 1980 took part in 
the USG\'s International Visitor (IV) program.  He had a 
successful career as a Fine Gael TD, twice serving as Finance 
Minister in the 1980s.  In 1990 he was elected as the leader 
of Fine Gael, following a disastrous performance by the party 
in the presidential election earlier that year.  Bruton 
reinvigorated the party and was elected Taoiseach in 1994. 
He led a coalition government of Fine Gael, Labour, and a 
small post-communist party called the Democratic Left. 
Observers widely expected Bruton to win the 1997 general 
election, but public anger with Labour caused the loss of 
critical seats and left the coalition short of a majority. 
This paved the way for Bertie Ahern\'s Fianna Fail to enter 
into government with the Progressive Democrats. 
 
3.  Bruton is a considered a conservative member of Fine 
Gael, and he spent most of the 1980s advocating Thatcherite 
economic steps such as reforming welfare, cutting public 
spending, and encouraging private enterprise.  While these 
views made him unpopular with many voters, his economic 
policies played a key role in creating the \"Celtic tiger\" 
economy and Ireland enjoyed annual double-digit GDP growth 
during Bruton,s leadership.  Although he identifies himself 
as a conservative Catholic, Bruton,s government was the 
driving force during the 1997 referendum legalizing divorce 
and the 1995 legislation that permitted Irish women to 
receive information on foreign abortion clinics. 
 
4.  Bruton favored a balanced approach to Northern Ireland, 
and won widespread approval from the public for his handling 
of the issue.  He was very critical of the IRA and Sinn Fein, 
and insisted on IRA disarmament before Sinn Fein was admitted 
to any negotiations.  His hardline stance against nationalist 
paramilitaries and well-known sympathies for Ulster loyalists 
led many nationalist leaders to nickname him \"Unionist John\", 
but he often antagonized the United Kingdom by criticizing 
the behavior of the British Army and the RUC (the former 
police force in Northern Ireland). 
 
5.  Bruton is a well-known Atlanticist who strongly favored 
allowing the United States to use Shannon Airport during the 
1991 Gulf War.  The 2003 Greek Presidency invited him and a 
number of other dignitaries to prepare a paper on improving 
US-European relations.  He is a strong supporter of European 
integration, and played a key role in the creation of the 
euro by negotiating the European Growth and Stability Pact at 
the 1996 Dublin summit.  He also was the Irish Parliament\'s 
representative at the EU Constitutional Convention and 
reportedly played an important role.

E.O. 12958: N/A

SUBJECT: IRELAND\'S GAME PLAN ON ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS 
 
 
1. Summary: Firms in Ireland must move increasingly into 
high-value goods and services in order to safeguard the 
country\'s prosperity, advises a high-profile, 
government-commissioned report on Ireland\'s economic 
competitiveness.  The report notes that rising costs, poor 
performance by indigenous firms, changes in EU policies, and 
accelerating globalization threaten to overpower the factors 
underlying Ireland\'s economic success during the past decade. 
 The report recommends that the Irish Government assist firms 
with the transition into high-value goods and services by 
promoting enhancements to sales/marketing expertise and 
technology/R&D capability.  An Irish Central Bank economist, 
however, questions that approach, arguing that indigenous 
enterprises should leave heavy R&D investment to 
foreign-owned firms.  Despite Ireland\'s worries about 
competitiveness, U.S. firms continue to see the country as an 
attractive investment destination and export platform.  End 
summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
The Focus on Competitiveness 
---------------------------- 
 
2.  Concerns about Ireland\'s competitiveness as an exporter 
and foreign direct investment (FDI) destination have featured 
prominently in recent Irish economic commentary, even as the 
country\'s economy continues to perform strongly.  In late 
August, for example, a Department of Finance report 
forecasting the second half of 2004 warned, \"We cannot afford 
to worsen our already deteriorating competitive position.\" 
By contrast, the same report upgraded projections for GDP 
growth in 2004 from 3.3 percent to 4.7 percent, lowered 
predictions for average annual inflation from 3.0 percent to 
2.2 percent, and forecast a government surplus of euro 600 
million.  In public comments on the report, Finance Minister 
Charlie McCreevy downplayed this rosy outlook and reiterated 
that \"regaining competitiveness is a key priority if we are 
to safeguard our economic success.\" 
 
3.  Recent attention to competitiveness derives primarily 
from a new, long-anticipated report entitled \"Ahead of the 
Curve: Ireland\'s Place in the Global Marketplace\" -- 
essentially, a game plan for Ireland to sustain exports, FDI, 
and economic prosperity in the face of international 
competition.  The report was written by the Enterprise 
Strategy Group (ESG), established by Deputy Prime Minister 
Mary Harney in 2003 with 21 representatives of industry, 
labor, academia, and government (primarily Forfas, the 
government office that coordinates Ireland\'s 
business-promotion agencies).  Eoin O\'Driscoll, Executive 
Vice President (and soon President) of the American Chamber 
of Commerce, chairs the ESG and was the Chamber\'s channel for 
significant input into the report.  With additional 
contributions from over 250 people, the ESG report is 
Ireland\'s broadest industrial policy statement since the 1992 
Culliton Report, which called for the development of an 
export-oriented enterprise sector and thus set the stage for 
the emergence of the Celtic Tiger economy. 
 
------------------- 
The Cause for Worry 
------------------- 
 
4.  The ESG report argues that the factors underlying 
Ireland\'s economic success over the past decade do not 
adequately address emerging challenges to the country\'s 
continued competitiveness.  These positive factors have 
included: ease of access to EU markets and EU regional aid; 
an open climate for trade and FDI; a favorable corporate tax 
regime (a single rate of 12.5 percent that applies to both 
foreign and Irish firms), fiscal policies that minimize 
government debt; burgeoning global trade (particularly in the 
IT and life-science sectors, recipients of substantial FDI in 
Ireland); and the availability of young, educated labor.  The 
challenges that threaten to overpower these factors, however, 
are primarily: 
 
A) Rising costs: Forfas ranks Ireland as the most expensive 
country in the euro zone (in a tie with Finland).  Although 
CPI inflation in Ireland has converged downward toward the EU 
average through mid-2004, annual inflation since the late 
1990s has consistently exceeded the EU average.  During the 
same span, wage increases have been two to three times the EU 
average. 
 
B) Poor indigenous performance: Except for a few 
high-performing firms, real growth in the sales and exports 
of indigenous Irish enterprises was negligible between 1990 
and 2002.  The ESG report noted that a relatively small 
number of foreign-owned firms that chose Ireland as their 
base for serving European markets drove Ireland\'s strong 
economic performance in that span.  Foreign-owned firms still 
account for over 85 percent of Ireland\'s exports by value. 
 
C) Changes in EU policies: Grant aid limits for the EU-15 
states will tighten after 2006, while those for the newer 
member states will be relatively high.  Ireland\'s ability to 
provide grant assistance to attract foreign investment, a key 
element of earlier enterprise strategy, could thus evaporate 
in much of the country. 
 
D) Accelerating globalization: China, India, and the new EU 
Member States have emerged as attractive FDI destinations, as 
they offer low costs, an ample supply of skilled labor, 
comparably low corporate taxes, and access to new markets. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
The Solution: Sales/Marketing Expertise and Technology/R&D 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
5.  The ESG\'s strategy to shore up Ireland\'s competitiveness 
is to enable enterprises to succeed in internationally traded 
services and high-value manufacturing through 
government-promoted enhancements in marketing/sales expertise 
and technological/R&D capability.  The strategy, in 
particular, targets indigenous small and medium-sized firms. 
 
A) Sales and Marketing: Ireland-based enterprises do not have 
strong outreach to international consumers when compared with 
firms in other trading countries, argues the ESG.  Negligible 
real growth during the 1990s in indigenous firms\' exports, 
most of which went to the UK, would suggest weak 
international sales management.  Foreign-owned firms in 
Ireland have focused primarily on production as a single step 
in their parent companies\' supply chains, with few selling 
directly to customers.  To help firms understand and provide 
what customers want, the ESG proposes a new government entity 
called \"Export Ireland,\" which would focus on export market 
intelligence and sales promotional activities.  The ESG also 
suggests a five-year plan to place, on a cost-sharing basis, 
1,000 graduates and internationally experienced professionals 
in Ireland-based firms to augment the stock of sales and 
marketing talent.  (In discussions with the Embassy, ESG 
Chairman O\'Driscoll highlighted this plan, expressing hope 
that the personnel could be sourced largely from the United 
States.) 
 
B) Technology and R&D: Enterprises should simultaneously 
upgrade their technological/R&D capability to develop 
innovative, higher-value products and services, urges the 
ESG.  The ESG report acknowledges Ireland\'s status as a world 
R&D leader in the IT and pharmaceuticals sectors.  The report 
points out, however, that Ireland\'s total business 
expenditure on R&D is 0.88 percent of GDP, only 73 percent of 
the EU average and 57 percent of the OECD average.  To 
encourage more R&D investment, the ESG proposes increased tax 
incentives and the establishment of \"Technology Ireland,\" a 
government office that would coordinate R&D strategy among 
business-promotion agencies, in consultation with business 
networks.  The ESG also recommends stronger collaboration 
between enterprises and academia,  so that the latter \"might 
generate the intellectual capital required to fuel an 
innovation-driven economy.\" 
 
------------------------------- 
Ireland: The European Singapore 
------------------------------- 
 
6.  The drive to improve competitiveness reflects Ireland\'s 
natural anxieties as a small, open economy, econoff was told 
by Andrew McDowell, Forfas Department Manager for Trade and 
Innovation and a principal contributor to the ESG report. 
McDowell compared Ireland to Singapore, as both were newly 
prosperous countries of comparable population size aiming to 
succeed in competitive markets against larger neighbors and 
aggressive new entrants.  As a euro-zone country, 
furthermore, Ireland could not rely on monetary policy tools, 
such as exchange rate adjustments, to enhance its 
competitiveness.  Echoing the ESG report, McDowell said that 
Ireland\'s best bet was to move up the value chain to provide 
higher-end, innovative goods and services, ceding lower-end 
manufacturing to the new EU member states and Asia.  He 
explained that higher relative costs in Ireland did not mean 
that enterprises could not achieve efficiencies to provide 
higher-value products.  He cited Hewlett-Packard as an 
example of a foreign-owned enterprise in Ireland that had 
moved out of assembly operations, introduced novel R&D 
programs, developed new product lines, and expanded its work 
force despite rises in domestic cost/wage levels. 
 
--------------- 
A Contrary View 
--------------- 
 
7.  Although competitiveness is a vulnerability in the Irish 
economy, the ESG\'s call to strengthen technological R&D and 
sales and marketing expertise in indigenous firms is overly 
ambitious,\" Irish Central Bank Assistant Director General 
Michael Casey told econoff.  He argued that Irish firms, 
lacking economies of scale and a deep pool of highly educated 
labor, should simply copy (though not pirate) from 
foreign-owned enterprises, rather than invest heavily in R&D 
to pursue innovations of their own.  Casey noted that Japan 
had used this strategy successfully in the formative years of 
its auto industry, with Japanese companies simply copying 
American car models before eventually developing their own 
distinctive styles.  He noted that the dissemination of 
technology from foreign-owned to indigenous firms was already 
underway and that Irish firms intent on R&D investment would 
do better to focus on niche areas.  Casey expressed 
confidence that foreign firms with substantial investments in 
Ireland would remain in country; his concern was that they 
would use their preponderant position in the economy to 
influence government policies on taxation and grant aid. 
Overall, he saw no downside to continued reliance on 
foreign-owned firms to sustain Ireland\'s economic success, 
quipping that \"we\'ve been getting away with that for 30 
years.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Comment: Steady as She Goes with U.S. Investment 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8.  Despite Ireland\'s concerns on competitiveness, it would 
seem that U.S. firms continue to view the country as an 
attractive investment locale and export platform.  In 2003, 
U.S. investment in Ireland was USD 4.7 billion, tripling the 
previous year\'s total and raising the total stock of U.S. 
investment (on a historical cost-basis) to USD 46.7 billion. 
This past year has seen the high-profile opening of Intel\'s 
new \"Fab 24\" wafer production facility, signaling the 
company\'s confidence in Ireland as a base to develop the next 
generation of micro-chip technology.  U.S. subsidiaries in 
Ireland, in fact, see the competitiveness issue more in terms 
of the challenge to out-perform sister subsidiaries in other 
countries.  The ESG\'s recommendations to help enterprises 
move further into high-value goods and services should thus 
be welcome news to U.S.-owned firms.  As the ESG report 
notes, firms that can succeed in such transitions will hold 
greater strategic importance to their parent companies and, 
in turn, become more embedded in the Irish economy.

SUBJECT: IRELAND\'S AUTHORITY TO FREEZE TERROR ASSETS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 193684 
 
Classified By: PEO Chief Mary Daly per reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C)Summary.  Ireland generally follows the European Union 
lead in the fight on terrorist financing.  Currently, Ireland 
can automatically freeze the assets of domestic terrorist 
groups or transnational terrorist groups designated by the 
EU.  In all other instances, Ireland can only freeze assets 
if an investigation reveals that the particular assets within 
Ireland are from the proceeds of crime.  Pending legislation 
would allow the GOI to seize assets of transnational 
terrorists groups independent of an EU decision and also 
regardless of whether the assets are the proceeds of a crime 
or are assets that will be used in the commitment of a future 
crime.  GOI officials state the new terrorist legislation 
likely will be passed by the end of 2004.   End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
National Authority to Freeze Terror Assets 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (C)Under the Offenses Against the State Act, the GOI can 
freeze assets of domestic terrorist groups regardless of EU 
designation.  In regards to transnational terrorist assets, 
Ireland can only freeze bank account assets if the group is 
on the EU terrorist list.  However, under the Criminal 
Justice and Terrorist Offenses Bill of 2002 (still pending 
ratification), Ireland will be able to freeze the assets of 
any terrorist group, foreign or domestic, independently of 
any EU designation.  Embassy government contacts from the 
Department of Justice and the Central Bank expect the 
Terrorist Offenses Bill to be passed by the end of 2004. 
 
3.  (C)In terms of criminal assets, Ireland freezes accounts 
on the basis of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994.  The 
current system is that of civil forfeiture.  The courts 
pursue ill-gotten assets, forcing suspected criminals to 
prove that their gains are legitimate.  The individuals are 
innocent until proven guilty, but their assets can be held if 
suspected of being the proceeds of a crime. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Current Law and The Process of Freezing Assets 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4.  (C)The Irish Central Bank is authorized to freeze the 
assets of terrorist groups that have been designated by the 
EU, which in turn takes its lead from the UN 1373 
Counter-Terrorism Committee.  EU designation has immediate 
legal effect in Ireland and is enforced.  The Central Bank 
uses exchange mechanisms to freeze the assets concerned. 
When the GOI receives information from entities other than 
the EU (such as the US Treasury Department) regarding 
terrorist groups, the Central Bank will notify financial 
institutions and Gardai (national police force) to conduct 
investigations and surveillance on suspect groups.  When this 
is done, the Central Bank will take one of three courses of 
action: 
 
 ---  Investigations reveal assets are not proceeds of a 
crime and no action is taken. 
 
 ---  There is some suspicion that assets are from the 
proceeds of a crime; therefore, the GOI may prevent 
international transfer of the money (i.e., the money cannot 
be moved from a bank in Ireland to a bank in the UK). 
However, this does not prevent the money from being 
transferred to another bank within Ireland or simply being 
withdrawn from the bank altogether. 
 
 ---  Investigation reveals that the assets are the proceeds 
of a crime and are frozen.  The legal standard for this 
action is higher than suspending assets from international 
transfer, and it is also important to note that for assets to 
be frozen they must be from the proceeds of the crime (i.e., 
robbed a bank).  Assets cannot be frozen on the suspicion 
that they will be used for the future commitment of a crime 
(i.e., using the money to buy the tools to rob a bank in the 
future). 
 
GOI officials stressed that when assets are frozen as a 
result of information given by non-EU entities, the assets 
are frozen only because police discovered the assets are the 
proceeds of a crime, not because the non-EU entity designated 
the group a terrorist group. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
Future Law - Criminal Justice and Terrorists Offenses Bill 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
5.  (C)When the Criminal Justice and Terrorist Offenses Bill 
of 2002 is passed, it will give the Minister for Justice the 
ability to freeze assets of terrorists groups, regardless of 
whether the assets are the proceeds of a crime or will be 
used to commit a future crime or terrorist act.  The GOI will 
be able to freeze assets regardless of any EU designation. 
The legislation has been delayed for two years because it 
contains three distinct parts - one dealing with terrorists 
financing, one dealing with ratifying language for an EU 
terrorist directive,  and one dealing with several other UN 
terrorist conventions.  Without giving specifics, a Justice 
contact stated that while the terrorists assets portion of 
the bill has been ready for several months, issues regarding 
the EU directive have prevented the bill from being submitted 
to Parliament.  However, the contact also assured Emboff that 
the issue was finally resolved this month, and his opinion is 
that the legislation will be passed before the end of the 
year. 
 
-------------------- 
Success Stories 
-------------------- 
 
6.  (C)The GOI has frozen all assets put forward by the EU 
that pertain to Ireland.  Ireland has also frozen assets 
based on information given from non-EU sources.  While not 
being able to supply specifics, a Justice official stated 
that \"a few\" tips given by the US Department of Treasury led 
to either the freezing or suspension of international 
transfer of assets of someone who was found to have committed 
a crime in Ireland. 
 
--------------------------- 
Significant Obstacles 
--------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)The Department of Justice says that it does not 
necessarily arrest each perpetrator, whether criminal or 
terrorist, but it is successful at snatching assets and 
eliminating opportunities.  Through the Central Bank, the 
Irish are successful at legislating and implementing freezes 
on assets. Recently, the UK and other EU members have been 
looking at the Irish model in terms of adopting such 
practices. 
 
8.  (C)Current laws that tie GOI actions to EU designations 
offer limited penalties.  The new legislation will give the 
Irish more authority to address terrorist financing and 
provide more severe penalties commensurate with terrorist 
crimes.

1.  (C) On September 17, DCM and French Charge d\'Affaires, 
Luc Serot Almeras, jointly delivered reftel talking points to 
James MacIntyre, Department of Foreign Affairs EU Division 
Counsellor, and Joseph Mooney, Department of the Environment 
Assistant Principal Officer for Nuclear Safety.  Almeras and 
the DCM noted that the talking points on the pending 
plutonium shipment had been agreed by the U.S. and French 
Governments and would also be delivered to the Spanish and 
Portuguese Governments.  At Almeras\' urging, the points were 
not left behind as a non-paper. 
 
2.  (C) MacIntyre expressed thanks for the notification, 
adding that the GOI was aware of the planned shipment and 
respected our position on the rights of freedom of navigation 
and passage.  Consistent with Ireland\'s long-standing 
position in the IAEA, however, the GOI had concerns about the 
safety, security, and potential environmental impact of the 
transportation of nuclear materials.  He explained that the 
Irish public shared these concerns and that environmental 
issues could figure significantly in the October 22 Irish 
presidential election.  (The Greens may be the only party to 
field a candidate against the incumbent president, Mary 
McAleese.)  MacIntyre said that advance notification would 
allow the GOI time to plan for any emergencies or risks 
associated with the nuclear material.  He also indicated that 
the GOI would appreciate prior notification of any future 
shipments. 
 
3.  (C) Mooney mentioned that the Minister of the 
Environment, Martin Cullen, planned to make a press statement 
on September 17 in response to Irish media inquiries prompted 
by a September 16 London newspaper article about the 
shipment.  In addition, on September 17 the Irish Times 
reported concerns voiced by Rep. Ed Markey (D - 
Massachusetts) about the adequacy of security arrangements 
for the shipment.  Post has also seen a September 16 internet 
statement by Greenpeace protesting the shipment.  DCM 
requested that the Minister\'s statement not formally 
acknowledge the shipment, primarily for safety and security 
reasons.  Mooney responded that it would help to have 
assurances on safety, and the DCM reiterated that the 
shipment would exceed the international maritime safety 
standards established by the protocols listed reftel.  DCM 
also stressed the experience of the Pacific Nuclear Transport 
Limited crew, the reinforced structures of the vessels, the 
availability of assets to address contingencies, and the 
distance of the ship\'s routing from Irish territorial waters. 
 Mooney asked when the shipment would occur, and Almeras 
cited the time frame of the \"near future.\" 
 
4.  (C) Comment: Minister Cullen had not issued a statement 
as of this writing, and Mooney told econoff the afternoon of 
September 17 that he could not guarantee that a statement 
would be issued before the weekend.  Post will forward to 
EUR/UBI any press statement that might be released.

2.  (C) In a follow-up discussion on September 30 with

as the GOI and Irish public shared international concerns 
about China\'s poor human rights record.  He described lifting 
the ban as a \"hard sell domestically.\"  The GOI agreed with 
the U.S. position, moreover, that lifting the ban could 
adversely affect the East Asian military balance.  Brady 
believed that the ban would be lifted eventually, but not 
before 2005 and certainly not in time for the December 
EU-China Summit.  He noted that the EU had not yet achieved a 
consensus on the issue, particularly with the UK\'s lack of 
enthusiasm for lifting the ban.  Like Cooney, Brady could not 
offer assurances that Ireland would actively oppose moves 
within the EU to lift the ban.

SUBJECT: IRISH PRIME MINISTER PICKS HIS NEW CABINET 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary and Comment.  On September 29, the Taoiseach 
(Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern announced a cabinet shuffle, 
anticipated since early summer.  The shuffle saw eight 
ministers switch portfolios, three members retain their 
positions, and four lower ranking officials join the Cabinet. 
  Ahern\'s goal is to strengthen his coalition\'s chances of 
re-election in 2007.  Despite the government\'s successes 
economically and as EU president, the government took a hit 
in the June local and EU elections.  Voters began to see the 
government as \"uncaring\" and to grow impatient at the pace of 
improvement in infrastructure and services following years of 
economic boom.  In announcing his new cabinet, Ahern said he 
would maintain the government\'s strong economic program, 
while seeking to improve infrastructure, health, and 
education.  The only foreign policy issue he mentioned is the 
Northern Ireland peace process, which he pledged to move 
forward, alongside the UK.  Five of the Ministers are former 
participants in the Department of State\'s International 
Visitor programs:  Mary Coughlan, Dick Roche, Dermot Ahern, 
Mary Harney, and Seamus Brennan.Comment:  The cabinet shuffle 
was done for domestic reasons and is not likely to lead to 
major changes in foreign policy.  Directors General at DFA 
told us they expect FM Dermot Ahern (no relation to the PM) 
to continue the government\'s current foreign policy.  His 
calendar will be driven by events, they suggest, not by 
personal agenda.  Thus, he joined the PM in meeting the Rev. 
Ian Paisley on September 30, and will then prepare for the 
GAERC in October.  DFA officials also say that decisions on 
Ireland\'s participation in EU battle groups have been on hold 
pending the cabinet re-shuffle.  We expect consistency in 
Irish foreign, defense, and economic policy, even as the PM 
seeks to find money on the margins to improve social services 
and infrastructure.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
-------------------- 
New Portfolios 
-------------------- 
 
The new cabinet is as follows: 
 
2. (U) Dermot Ahern: Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fianna Fail 
 
Ahern moves to Foreign Affairs from his position as Minister 
of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  He is 
considered well-versed on Northern Ireland issues, having 
represented Louth, a border county, in the Dil (Irish 
Parliament), since 1987.  On his first day in office, he will 
discuss Northern Ireland with Ian Paisley during the DUP 
leader,s first political visit to the Republic.  Ahern 
served as Government Chief Whip in 1991-92.  He received a 
junior ministerial portfolio as Minister of State at the 
Departments of Taoiseach and Defense in that same period. 
Ahern is sometimes mentioned as a possible future party 
leader.  He is not related to PM Ahern but is considered to 
be very close to the PM. 
 
3. (SBU) Brian Cowen: Minister of Finance, Fianna Fail 
 
Cowen,s move to Finance from Foreign Affairs was the least 
surprising of the Cabinet changes, having been rumored since 
former Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy was tapped in August 
to become EU Internal Market Commissioner.  A TD since 1984, 
the 44-year-old Cowen is widely believed to be PM Ahern,s 
preferred successor as party and government leader, and this 
appointment appears designed to round out his qualifications 
for those positions.  Formerly, he served as Minister of 
Labor, Minister of Health, and Minister for Transport, 
Energy, and Communications.  He became Foreign Affairs 
Minister in 2000 and was widely lauded for his handling of 
the Irish EU presidency, including his role in negotiations 
on the EU constitution.  At Finance, a projected year-end 
budget surplus will position Cowen to enhance social services 
as part of Fianna Fail,s bid to fashion a more compassionate 
political image.  Cowen is currently being coached by Irish 
economist, Alan Gray, and is positioning himself to become a 
future Taoiseach. 
 
4. (C) Willie O\'Dea : Minister of Defense, Fianna Fail 
 
O,Dea, from Limerick, is a former Minister of State at the 
Department of Justice, Equality & Law Reform with special 
responsibility for Equality Issues.  He was first elected to 
the Dail in 1982.  His political career includes appointments 
as Minister of State at the Department of Education in 1997, 
Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Health in 
1993 and Minister of State at the Department of Justice in 
1992-93.  O,Dea has virtually no experience in 
Defense-related issues.  However, he is a popular politician. 
 His appointment reflects his vote-getting potential, not his 
defense expertise.  The United Kingdom is very disappointed 
by this appointment. 
5. (U) Micheal Martin: Minister of Enterprise, Trade and 
Employment, Fianna Fail 
 
Martin, a former Minister of Education, served as Health 
Minister since 2000. A 2003 poll showed Martin as the most 
popular choice among voters to succeed PM Ahern, though Ahern 
appears to favor new Finance Minister Cowen.  Martin is 
considered a media hound and is best known for having pushed 
through the world,s first country-wide ban on smoking in 
enclosed public places, including pubs and restaurants, in 
2004.  Earlier in 2001, he introduced a national strategy to 
improve public health services, but the health care system 
remains plagued by hospital waiting lists, a bloated 
administrative bureaucracy, and inadequate insurance 
coverage.  Martin has represented Cork in the Dail since 1989 
and is the first Fianna Fail Minister of Enterprise, Trade, 
and Employment since that year.  His appointment to this key 
ministry gives his career a boost. 
 
6. (SBU) Mary Harney: Minister of Health and Children, Deputy 
Prime Minister (Tanaiste), Progressive Democrats 
 
Harney retains the office of Deputy Prime Minister 
(Tanaiste), but moves to the Health Department from her 
previous post as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and 
Employment.  If the government as a whole needs to show the 
Irish that it has a heart, Harney\'s Progressive Democrats 
need to do so even more; hence, her move from an economic 
ministry to a social ministry.  Political commentators see 
Harney,s move to Health as a serious political gamble.  She 
has only two years to demonstrate change in a dysfunctional 
health care system.  If she fails, Fianna Fail can let her 
take the blame; if she succeeds, she will have to share 
credit with Fianna Fail.  An Embassy contact suggested that 
the hospital hardships encountered by Harney,s disabled 
mother may have increased the Tanaiste\'s personal interest in 
the health portfolio.  She is a parliamentary veteran, having 
entered the Irish senate in 1977 as its youngest ever member 
at age 24.  In 1985, she left Fianna Fil and helped to set 
up a new right-of center political party, the Progressive 
Democrats (PD).  In 1989, she led the PDs into the first of 
several coalitions with Fianna Fil and later served as 
Minister of State for the Environment. 
 
7. (U) Mary Coughlan: Minister for Agriculture and Food, 
Fianna Fail 
 
Coughlan is the first woman to hold the agriculture 
portfolio, a surprise appointment given the traditionally 
conservative nature of the farming sector.  She was appointed 
Minister for Social and Family Affairs in 2002 after serving 
as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, 
Gaeltacht and the Islands.  She has represented the 
electorate of Donegal South West since 1987. 
 
8. (SBU) Martin Cullen: Minister of Transport, Fianna Fail 
 
Cullen moves from the Department of Environment and Local 
Government, where he had served as Minister since 2002.  He 
was first elected as a Progressive Democrat TD for Waterford 
in 1987.  He lost his Dil seat in 1989, but returned to the 
Dil in 1992, before switching to Fianna Fil in 1993. 
Cullen faced criticism for his Department,s failed attempt 
to introduce electronic voting in June, a misstep that, 
according to the September 28 Comptroller General,s report, 
cost taxpayers euro 50 million.  He has a tendency to 
grandstand for political purposes, as was likely the case in 
mid-September, when he publicly asked for U.S. assurances 
that a maritime plutonium shipment would not pass through 
Irish waters.  In his new portfolio he will face questions 
about the prospects for Aer Lingus, privatization, and for 
liberalizing the U.S.-Ireland civil aviation agreement. 
 
9. (U) Mary Hanafin: Minister of Education and Science, 
Fianna Fail 
 
Hanafin was first elected to the Dail in 1997, representing 
Dun Laoghaire, a wealthy Dublin suburb.  In 2002, she was top 
female vote-getter in parliament and promoted that year to 
Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of 
Defense.  As Chief Whip, she was effective in maintaining 
party discipline.  She is a convent educated, former 
secondary school teacher. 
 
10. (SBU) Dick Roche: Minister of Environment and Local 
Government, Fianna Fail 
 
Roche, a Wicklow TD and former university lecturer, moves up 
to the Cabinet from his position as Minister of State for the 
EU at the Department of Foreign Affairs, where he earned high 
praise during the EU presidency.  Roche, along with Foreign 
Minister Cowen, led the Nice treaty referendum campaign in 
2003 and is credited with reversing the electorate,s 
rejection of Nice the previous year.  He is close to PM 
Ahern, having managed Ahern,s first, though unsuccessful, 
campaign for the leadership of Fianna Fail in the early 
1990,s.  At the Department of the Environment, he may face 
pressure to revisit the government,s decision in September 
not to impose taxes on carbon emissions, a move publicly 
criticized by leading Irish think-tanks.  Roche is a good 
friend to the US, and the UK is likewise pleased with this 
appointment. 
 
11. (U) Noel Dempsey: Minister for Communications, Marine and 
Natural Resources, Fianna Fail 
 
Dempsey most recently served in the Cabinet as Minister for 
Education and Science, where he pressed unsuccessfully to 
reintroduce college-level tuition, a politically unpopular 
move.  He was Chief Whip in 1993-94 and was named Minister 
for the Environment and Local Government in 1997.  He has 
represented the constituency of Meath in the Dil since 1987. 
 
 
12. (U) Seamus Brennan: Minister of Social and Family 
Affairs, Fianna Fail 
 
Brennan\'s move is seen as a demotion from his position at 
Transport, where he served since 2002.  He reportedly desired 
to remain at Transport or take a new economic portfolio, but 
accepted Social and Family Affairs when it became evident, 
after tense September 29 meetings with the Taoiseach, that he 
might lose a Cabinet position altogether.  According to local 
economists, PM Ahern, a consensus-builder, took exception to 
Brennan,s brash dealings with the Irish police and with Aer 
Rianta, the airport union.  He was elected to the Dil in 
1981 and had previously served as Chief Whip and as Minister 
in the Departments of Tourism, Education, and Commerce. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Remaining Cabinet Members 
----------------------------------- 
 
13. (U) The following retained their cabinet seats: 
John O,Donoghue: Minister of Arts, Sports, Tourism, Fianna 
Fail

Fail 
Michael McDowell: Justice, Equality, and Law Reform,

1.  (U) This is an urgent action request.  See para 5 & 6. 
 
2.  (SBU) Summary.  The Office of the Director of Public 
Prosecutions (DPP) of Ireland has set the new trial date of 
Mary Kelly for Wednesday, October 20th, 2004.  The court 
requires Commander William Snyder, Lieutenant Commander Kurt 
B. Schaedel and Chris Ludmer to serve as witnesses, and

DPP vs. MARY KELLY - NEW TRIAL DATE 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions 
(DPP) has set a new trial date for Mary Kelly, accused of 
criminally damaging a US Military Aircraft at Shannon 
Airport.  The trial will take place on Wednesday, October 
20th, 2004 at the Ennis Circuit Court near Shannon Airport. 
 
------------------- 
WITNESSES REQUESTED 
------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Accordingly, the following US witnesses will be 
required in Ireland on 20th October 2004 until termination of 
court proceedings (the trial will take at least one week): 
 
-Commander William Snyder 
-Lieutenant Commander Kurt B. Schaedel 
-Chris Ludmer 
 
The prosecutor notes that Mr. Robert Saunders accompanied 
both officers at the previous trials as a legal advisor, and 
suggests that they might require his services on this 
occasion also.  Gardai (National Police Force) and the DPP 
will pay expenses and arrange lodging for US witnesses. 
 
5.  (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Please confirm ASAP availability 
of the above named requested witnesses for the October 20 
re-trial of Mary Kelly. 
 
6. (C) ACTION REQUEST - Re-Release of Dip Note:  In March 
2004, the USG gave permission for U.S. Embassy Dublin 
Diplomatic Note 55, dated January 27, 2003, to be released 
for use in the Clancy case (Ref A).  (Dip Note 55 requested 
permission from the Irish government to land a C-40 aircraft 
at Shannon Airport.  This is the aircraft the defendant 
damaged.)  The Irish government, on behalf of the prosecutor, 
has now asked that the USG release the note for the Mary 
Kelly trial.  Embassy requests authorization to do so.  We 
would propose doing so in the same manner as we did in the 
Clancy case.  In that case, we conveyed permission to use Dip 
Note 55 under cover of Diplomatic Note 129 of March 2004. 
Dip Note 129 noted that the release was a limited waiver of 
Article 24 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 
under which the archives and documents of the mission are 
inviolable at any time and wherever they may be.

BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
7.  (U) On January 29, 2003, Mary Kelly (aka Axe Lady), a 
member of the Catholic Workers/Pitstop Plowshares group 
attacked a US Navy aircraft, then parked on the ramp at 
Shannon Airport.  Her attack, combined with a restrike 
several days later, caused approximately $4.5 million damage 
to the aircraft.  There have been numerous court proceedings 
in the case to date.  The first trial ended in a hung jury on 
the charge of criminal damage.  A retrial was scheduled for 
June 2004, which resulted in the Defense Team quitting the 
case.  The Judge adjourned the case and continued it until 
October 2004.  Since the first court hearing in 2003, the USG 
has been committed to supporting GOI efforts to obtain 
justice in the case. At each of the hearings, we have, 
through DOS P/M, obtained witness support or provided other 
support as necessary.

SUBJECT: IRISH PRESIDENT MCALEESE DECLARED ELECTED FOR 2ND 
TERM 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  On Friday, October 1, incumbent Irish 
President Mary McAleese was constitutionally elected to 
office unopposed for a second term of seven years.  Her 
inauguration is scheduled to take place on November 11, 2004. 
 President McAleese told Ambassador Kenny that her primary 
motivation in running for a second seven-year term is to 
support the Northern Ireland peace process. End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
BUILDING ON THE FIRST TERM 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) At the Custom House in Dublin on October 1, the Chief 
Returning Officer, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, announced Mary 
McAleese\'s mandated re-election as President of Ireland. As 
no other candidate received the required twenty senatorial 
signatures or endorsement of four counties, President 
McAleese was constitutionally mandated to receive a second 
term, without voters going to the polls.  (The Irish 
Constitution has specific presidential election rules, 
declaring that if only one presidential nominee exists by the 
nomination deadline, then that person is automatically 
elected president.) McAleese is so popular that political 
parties deemed it a waste of resources to try to oppose her. 
The Green party and Labour party asked would-be candidates 
from among their ranks to stand down.  Independent Dana 
Rosemary Scallon fought longer for support, but failed to get 
the necessary signatures to run.  She has gained some 
sympathy questioning whether Ireland\'s rules are 
\"democratic,\" since they make it easier for an incumbent to 
run than a challenger, and provide for a mandated election 
instead of a ballot in the case of a one-candidate race.  In 
the end, though, given McAleese\'s popularity and the limited 
power of the presidency, the issue never gained real 
traction.  McAleese will be inaugurated on November 11, 2004, 
at Dublin Castle. 
 
3. (U) The theme of President McAleese\'s first term was 
\"Building Bridges\" and it is expected that her second term 
will revolve around similar issues. She is best known for 
supporting issues of justice, equality, social inclusion, 
anti-sectarianism, and reconciliation.  During her first 
term, McAleese attempted to \"build bridges\" through increased 
cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of 
Ireland.  She is very devoted to continuing the Irish peace 
process, creating quality social programs for the disabled, 
and enhancing cross-border cooperation within the European 
Union.

4. (U) McAleese was elected as the 8th President of Ireland 
in 1997. Born in Belfast, she is the first president from 
Northern Ireland. In 1994, after serving as the Director of 
the Institute of Professional Legal Studies at Queen\'s 
University of Belfast for seven years, McAleese became the 
first female Pro-Vice Chancellor at the university. McAleese 
also served as a Barrister and a Professor of Law at Trinity 
College. She has extensive experience as a current affairs 
journalist in radio and television. President McAleese is 
married to Martin McAleese, a well-known accountant and 
dentist who also hails from Northern Ireland.  They have 
three children.

GOALS 
 
REF: DUBLIN 1331 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In an October 4 meeting with Ambassador 
Kenny, EU Ambassador-designate to the United States John 
Bruton noted his plans to work with Congress and through 
public diplomacy to strengthen U.S.-EU relations.  Bruton 
said he would aim to underscore the policy objectives that 
both sides shared and to reduce the focus on trans-Atlantic 
differences.  Ambassador Kenny encouraged this approach and 
urged him to reach out to the U.S. business community and USG 
agencies.  Regarding key U.S.-EU issues, Bruton: 
 
-- avoided predictions on the decision that the EU would take 
on the China arms embargo; 
 
-- related that Brussels was \"desperately worried\" about a 
possible trade war over subsidies to aircraft manufacturers; 
 
-- said that the EU had instructed him to make the resolution 
of the FSC issue a priority in his dealings with Congress; 
 
-- expressed concern that DHS would not be ready by next 
autumn to implement biometric passport requirements; and 
 
-- expressed EU hopes to engage the USG on efforts to curtail 
international trade in small arms.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Bruton\'s Planned Approach to His Office 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) In an October 4 meeting with the Ambassador, EU 
Ambassador-designate to the United States John Bruton (bio 
reftel) said that he would focus on Congress in his efforts 
to strengthen U.S.-EU relations.  He noted his intention to 
foster exchanges between Congress and the European 
Parliament, with a view to preempting controversies that 
might arise through unilateral legislative action by either 
side.  Bruton mentioned that he was sensitive to the 
influence that interaction between Congress and the 
Administration had on the USG approach to Europe, having seen 
the occasionally contentious interplay among the European 
Commission, Council, and Parliament on U.S. policy.  He 
anticipated that Irish ethnic U.S. Representatives and 
Senators would provide entre for his dealings with Congress. 
He expressed concern, however, about the degree to which 
partisanship would hamper such outreach, noting that the 
bipartisan spirit that he had seen during his visits to 
Washington in the early 1970s had disappeared. 
 
3.  (C) Bruton also planned substantial public diplomacy 
during his tenure.  He envisioned speaking engagements to 
address possibilities for U.S.-EU cooperation on issues like 
democratization, which the European public had inaccurately 
associated with U.S. neo-conservatism.  He would also try to 
give his listeners a better sense of the way that EU 
authorities interacted with the EU Member States -- a subject 
that even most Europeans did not understand, he observed. 
Quoting Freud, Bruton said that the overall goal of his 
efforts would be to redress \"the narcissism of small 
differences\" in U.S.-EU relations and to highlight the 
abundance of shared objectives. 
 
4.  (C) The Ambassador encouraged Bruton\'s outreach to 
Congress and urged him to work with the U.S. business 
community and with USG agencies, including the State 
Department.  The Ambassador suggested, in particular, that 
Bruton meet with USTR Zoellick to review U.S.-EU trade 
issues, noting that trans-Atlantic trade relations were the 
foundation upon which cooperation in all other fields was 
built.  The Ambassador observed that segments of Congress 
were unfamiliar with the European Union and that Bruton could 
play a valuable role in filling in those information gaps. 
He added that Bruton could play a similar role with U.S. 
business groups and industry associations, many of whom had 
substantial investments in Europe and were hungry for input 
on U.S.-EU economic issues.  When Bruton asked what most 
annoyed Americans about the EU, the Ambassador cited the 
perception, fueled by the Microsoft case, that EU authorities 
hassled U.S. firms in Europe. 
 
---------------------------- 
Key Points on U.S.-EU Issues 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Bruton made the following points on key issues in 
U.S.-EU relations: 
 
A.  China arms embargo.  There would be no European arms 
exports to China even if the embargo were lifted, given the 
strictures of the Code of Conduct.  The Code of Conduct would 
thus have the same effect as the embargo, while appearing 
less hostile to China.  Bruton said he understood U.S. 
concerns, adding that he could not predict the final decision 
that the EU would take on the embargo. 
 
B.  Boeing-Airbus.  Brussels is \"desperately worried\" about a 
possible trade war over subsidies to aircraft manufacturers 
Airbus and Boeing.  A complicating factor is that some Member 
States, particularly France, have substantial interests at 
stake, while others have no interests at all. 
C.  FSC.  The EU had instructed Bruton to make the resolution 
of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) case (in which the WTO 
has authorized the EU to impose retaliatory fines for U.S. 
tax breaks to exporters) a priority in his dealings with 
Congress.  Bruton hoped that the matter could be finalized in 
this session of Congress. 
 
D.  Homeland Security.  The EU wants to be helpful on U.S. 
homeland security measures and has accepted the biometric 
passport requirements to be implemented in 2005.  As EU 
Member States move to put the necessary passport technology 
in place, however, they have concerns that DHS may not be 
ready by next autumn to bring its own requirements into 
effect. 
 
E.  The Middle East.  The Commission has not been clear with 
Bruton as to the role he could play regarding efforts by the 
Quartet in the Middle East.  He related the EU impression 
that Israeli Prime Minister Sharon wished to keep the U.S. 
from establishing a negotiating partner among the 
Palestinians. 
 
F.  Kyoto Protocol.  The EU is unsure whether the Bush 
Administration has remained outside the Kyoto Protocol 
because of the economic impact that adherence would have on 
U.S. industry, or because the Administration is simply not 
convinced of the science of climate change.  The EU believes 
that the Administration has overemphasized the potential of 
technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
G.  Small arms trade.  The Commission hopes to engage the USG 
on efforts to curtail international trade in small arms and 
light weapons, notwithstanding opposition to gun control in 
the United States.  In the EU view, easy access to small arms 
is a principal reason for the failure of poor states. 
 
H.  Africa.  Bruton agreed with the Ambassador that U.S.-EU 
cooperation on African issues, particularly the fight against 
HIV/AIDS, could be a positive experience upon which to build 
in mounting joint efforts on other difficult issues, like the 
Middle East.

1.  (C) Summary: In recent days, the Irish media have 
continued to focus on the U.S.-France Eurofab plutonium 
shipment, highlighting opposition by Greenpeace and Irish 
activists.  In reply, the Irish Government has claimed to 
have received assurances that the shipment will not harm 
Irish interests.  An op-ed in the October 5 Irish Times, the 
paper of record, echoes the Government\'s line that steps have 
been taken to protect Ireland\'s safety.  Irish naval assets, 
meanwhile, have monitored the progres of the vessels carrying 
the plutonium.  The media coverage reflects continued Irish 
sensitivities about nuclear power and nuclear weapons, which 
is aggravated by perceptions of UK apathy regarding possible 
pollution of the Irish Sea by the UK\'s Sellafield nuclear 
plant.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) Over the past week, the Irish media have continued to 
focus on the maritime Eurofab plutonium shipment from the 
United States to the French port of Cherbourg (reftels).  On 
September 29, the Irish Times reported a Paris press 
conference by Greenpeace, which claimed that the vessels 
carrying the plutonium would breach Ireland\'s 200-mile 
economic exclusion zone.  The report noted Greenpeace\'s 
concerns about the possibility of radiation release in a 
maritime accident and also about safety standards used by the 
French plant that would treat the plutonium.  The October 4 
Irish Independent reported that an Irish yacht had jointed an 
\"international flotilla\" in Cherbourg harbor protesting the 
shipment\'s arrival.  On October 5, the Irish Times carried an 
op-ed that defended the shipment, saying that the vessels had 
exercised their right of innocent passage.  The op-ed added 
that the Irish Government had taken all reasonable steps to 
protect the safety of Irish citizens and to uphold the 
country\'s nuclear-free policy. 
 
3.  (U) On October 4, the RTE 1 and RTE 2 television networks 
aired separate short interviews about the shipment with Dick 
Roche, appointed Minister of the Environment and Local 
Government on September 29.  Roche told RTE 1 that \"we\'ve 
been given assurances that this is not going to be a 
continuous trade, and short of asking the vessels to come 
into Irish ports and perhaps check them over, I don\'t see 
what else we can do.\"  Roche said to RTE 2 that the GOI had 
been given assurances \"that this shipment would not enter 
Irish coastal waters and it certainly seems that that has 
been honored.\"  (Per refs B and C, Embassy did not give the 
GOI assurances as to the routing of the vessels.)  Roche 
explained that \"this is a piece of good news for the whole 
world because this is part of the decommissioning of nuclear 
vessels.\"  He added that \"we would be happier if we didn\'t 
have any truck with any form of nuclear material, ... but we 
live in a world where that happens to be a reality.\" 
 
4.  (C) Besides Roche\'s comments, the only other Irish 
Government comment on the shipment was a September 20 press 
release by former Environment Minister Cullen, in which 
Cullen said he would pursue assurances that the shipment 
would not enter Irish territorial waters.  On October 5, the 
Department of the Environment\'s Assistant Principal Officer 
for Nuclear Safety, Joe Mooney (who received Embassy\'s ref B 
demarche) told emboff that there were no plans for additional 
GOI statements about the shipment.  He noted that his office 
had drawn on talking points provided by the Embassy (ref C) 
in drafting Minister Roche\'s talking points for the RTE 1 and 
2 interviews.  Mooney added that his office would continue to 
draw on those points if the nuclear issue were raised at 
formal question-and-answer sessions in the Dail (Irish 
Parliament) this month. 
 
5.  (C) The Irish Naval Service, Air Corps, and Coastguard 
have dispatched assets beyond Ireland\'s territorial waters, 
but inside the exclusive fishery zone, to monitor the 
movements of the vessels handling the plutonium shipment.  A 
contact of Embassy DAO reports that these naval sevices were 
under political pressure to monitor the vessels in response 
to media attention. 
 
6.  (C) Comment: Nuclear power continues to be an emotional 
subject for Ireland, as borne out by continuing media 
coverage of the Eurofab shipment.  This sensitivity derives 
mainly from the perception that materials from the nuclear 
reprocessing complex at Sellafield on the UK\'s Cumbrian coast 
have polluted the Irish Sea -- a concern that Ireland feels 
the UK has ignored.  The UK Ambassador to Ireland, Stewart 
Eldon, told emboffs during a recent lunch that Sellafield had 
become the single most serious irritant in UK-Irish relations.

noted that the Commission, at the most recent 133 meeting, 
had expressed disappointment that the USG had not attempted 
to resolve the dispute through mechanisms available under the 
1992 U.S.-EC Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.  The 
Commission had also attributed USG actions to the U.S. 
presidential election and to the growing strength of Airbus\' 
competitive position.  Per reftel, Emboff replied that the 
importance of this issue extended beyond the November 
elections and that the U.S. goal was a level playing field in 
the market.  Joyce said that the Irish Government would have 
preferred additional efforts by both sides to resolve the 
dispute before taking recourse to WTO settlement mechanisms. 
He also noted the GOI\'s hope for a resolution during the 
60-day WTO consultations period.

1. (S) Post has no objection to the domestic US designation 
of Islamic African Relief Agency (IARA) for asset freezing 
under E.O. 13224.  There is no known current activity of IARA 
in Ireland, but until recently, questionable activities were 
conducted under the name of the Islamic Relief Agency-Dublin 
(ISRA-Dublin).  Irish police and RMAS are investigating the 
activities of this group and key individuals and due 
diligence requires that continued attention remain on 
fund-raising activities in Ireland. 
 
-------------------- 
Limits of the Gardai 
-------------------- 
 
2. (S) The Gardai (Irish National Police Force) are 
investigating the Islamic Foundation of Ireland.  The mosque, 
on 163 South Circular Road is known to be frequented by 
nefarious individuals, including Mujahideen from Afghanistan 
and Bosnia.  There is little the Gardai can do beyond 
surveillance, even in cases of suspected terrorism financing. 
 Currently, the Irish do not have effective legislation in 
terms of terrorism financing.  The Gardai, Department of 
Justice and Central Bank can move to sanction and freeze 
assets of a group only after that group is added to the UN 
1267 Sanctions Committee list, and then added to the EU,s 
internal list.  Though Gardai remain suspicious of activities 
at the mosque, they are limited by current civil and criminal 
codes (see reftel B). 
 
3. (S)  The GOI is likely to welcome a UN designation on this 
group and affiliates working in Ireland.  If the designation 
is accepted under UN 1267, and then the EU, Ireland would 
likely support it.

Libya, China, Cyprus, Sudan, and Iraq to Gerard Keown, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) European Correspondent. 
 
---- 
Libya 
----- 
 
2.  (C) Keown affirmed that the October 11 GAERC would ratify 
the September 22 COREPER decision to lift the EU arms embargo 
against Libya (reiterating the DFA response to our September 
29 demarche, ref B).  He explained that the EU belives that 
lifting the embargo is consistent with the USG-supported 
removal of UN sanctions against Libya in 2003 and would be a 
first step in an incremental process that could lead to 
enhanced EU-Libya relations.  Each step would require 
demonstrations of Libyan good faith to move the process 
forward.  Keown mentioned, in particular, the need for the 
Libyan Government to resolve the situation with the Bulgarian 
medics.  He also explained that Libya\'s end goal was 
participation in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, a factor 
that the EU could use to solicit Libyan compliance with 
EU-stipulated actions on the road to better relations. 
 
------------------ 
China Arms Embargo 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C) Keown said that the October 11 GAERC would not decide 
on the China arms embargo, but would rather take stock of EU 
discussions to date on the issue (consistent with DFA views 
in ref C).  He noted that the GAERC would likely focus on 
suggestions to strengthen and enforce the Code of Conduct, 
the proposed alternative to the embargo.  He added that the 
likely outcome of the GAERC meeting would be a consensus on 
the need for additional discussion. 
 
------ 
Cyprus 
------ 
 
4.  (C) The EU\'s intention was precisely to deal with aid and 
direct trade measures for the Turkish Cypriots in a way that 
would continue to show support for the pro-solution forces in 
the north, said Keown.  He also mentioned that there would be 
euro 240 million immediately available in EU assistance to 
Cyprus if a solution could be reached. 
 
------------- 
Darfur, Sudan 
------------- 
 
5.  (C) According to Keown, the EU provides direct technical 
assistance to the African Union (AU) mission, and there are 
plans to increase aid to the mission in the near term.  Keown 
underscored the EU\'s stance on respecting and encouraging the 
AU\'s leadership role.  The EU was thus awaiting requests from 
the AU on its assistance needs.  Keown expressed EU concern 
that the Sudanese Government would use the Abjua process on 
Darfur to slow negotiations toward a North-South solution. 
The EU also hoped that visits to Sudan in recent days by UN 
representatives would help to accelerate the Commission of 
Inquiry\'s work. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Iraq - Elections and Police Training 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) Keown noted that Iraq was not on the GAERC meeting 
agenda, adding that election monitoring and police training 
remain under EU discussion at the technical level.

GENERAL TRAVEL INFORMATION 
 
5.  There are no visa requirements for visitors traveling to 
Ireland on diplomatic or official passports. 
 
6.   Please note that as of March 29, 2004, Ireland has 
instituted a smoking ban in the work place, including all 
pubs, restaurants, and hotel common areas.  Violation of this 
law may result in a fine of up to Euro 3,000.  Check with 
hotel staff upon arrival to determine if smoking is permitted 
in hotel room. 
 
7.  Post policy is to provide airport pickup for employees at 
the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary or above.  Other 
travelers should take the Dublin Aircoach (6 Euro one way, 
departure every 15 minutes) or a taxi (approximately 25 Euro 
one way).  Travelers arriving with excess equipment or having 
special transportation needs should communicate those 
requirements to their Embassy control officer prior to

offer the best exchange rates. 
 
SECURITY INFORMATION FOR IRELAND 
 
9.  Post is unaware of direct threats against Americans or 
U.S. interests in Ireland, and Ireland remains a relatively 
safe country where anti-American sentiment is rare.  For 
additional threat assessment information regarding Ireland, 
you may contact DS/DSS/ITA (Diplomatic Security\'s Office of 
Intelligence and Threat Assessment) in the State Department 
at 202-663-0787.  TDY visitors staying longer than 30 days 
should schedule a briefing with the Regional Security Officer. 
 
10.  Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin has 
its share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
11.  Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, shares 
an increased threat of terrorist incidents of international 
origin.  Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings 
and report suspicious people or activities to the police or 
RSO.

Classified By: Charge Jon Benton for reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C)  The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs confirms 
that proximity talks with the DUP and Sinn Fein will begin 
Friday October 15 in London.  Senior officials from the two 
governments will shuttle between Sinn Fein and DUP 
representatives.  The Irish government wants to keep this out 
of the press and believe they can, given that Gerry Adams has 
a separate reason for being in London. The Irish say it is 
time for both parties to show what is on offer, and then to 
see if they can come to terms on a comprehensive package, 
including modalities of decommissioning, DUP commitments on 
devolution and policing, and the issues surrounding how the 
institutions would work.  Substance would be agreed 
first,then sequencing and a time line.  Irish officials 
believe the elements of a deal are achievable, but caution 
that it always comes down to political will. 
 
2.  (C)  Sinn Fein officials in Dublin have told us they are 
optimistic about the London talks, and cite one basis of 
their optimism to be a comment FM Ahern made to the press, to 
the effect that it is \"only a matter of time\" before Sinn 
Fein is in government in the south (see transcript, para 3). 
Sinn Fein has long wanted such a statement, arguing that the 
Irish government is not in a position to put pressure on DUP 
to work with Sinn Fein if it continues to say Sinn Fein 
cannot be in government in the Republic.  DFA officials say, 
however, that there was nothing planned about the foreign 
minister\'s remarks.  Rather, he responded to a question from 
the press in the same way he always responded before becoming 
foreign minister, and in a way consistent with longstanding 
Irish policy.  Indeed, the day after Ahern\'s statement, the 
government emphasized that paramilitarism must end, 
decommissioning of weapons must take place, and private 
armies eliminated before Fianna Fail (the largest party in 
government) would review its current opposition to Sinn 
Fein\'s participation in government. Education minister 
Hanafin added that Sinn Fein had \"a long, long way to go.\" 
These statements aim to calm the Progressive Democrats, the 
junior party in the government coalition.  Privately, some 
Fianna Fail party members have told embassy that they are the 
last party that would ever form a government with Sinn Fein. 
Opposition parties, predictably, are making hay out of the 
foreign minister\'s remarks. 
 
3. (SBU) Remarks by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot 
Ahern, October 12 
 
Journalist:  \"Minister Ahern, if the question of IRA weapons 
is sorted conclusively, definitively, if the DUP are asked to 
accept Sinn Fein as potential coalition partners (in Northern 
Ireland), what does that say about Fianna Fail\'s attitude 
about Sinn Fein down South?  Will there be a change in those 
circumstances as well?\" 
 
Minister Ahern:  \"Well we have a particular stance as you 
know well but obviously if the circumstances change, the view 
in relation to SF going into government will change and I 
believe it is a matter of time, it is only a matter of time 
that SF will be in government in the future.  But until such 
time as the IRA demonstrably show that they have put down 
arms forever and a day, there cannot be two armies.  That the 
reality and it\'s the same in the north as it is in the 
republic....Obviously, circumstances will change.  There will 
come a time, I envisage, where Sinn Fein will be in 
government in the repbulic as they will be in the north and I 
hope that happens in the future.\"

CRISIS COOPERATION 
 
Classified By: DCM Jonathan Benton, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In an October 14 speech in Dublin, UNSYG 
Kofi Annan called for effective multilateralism to address 
global challenges and, in particular, increased UN-EU 
cooperation on crisis management.  He welcomed the EU 
battlegroup initiative as a potential model for UN-EU 
collaboration on conflict prevention.  In introductory 
remarks, Irish Foreign Minister Ahern emphasized Ireland\'s 
support for collective approaches to security, while 
highlighting Ireland\'s traditional military neutrality. 
Department of Foreign Affairs officials saw UNSYG Annan\'s 
speech as an opportunity to educate the Irish public that 
participation in UN-EU crisis management cooperation would 
not erode Ireland\'s neutrality.  Foreign Affairs and Defense 
officials confirm that GOI participation in EU battlegroups 
is under intensive review, in preparation for the EU\'s 
Capabilities Commitments Conference in November.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Annan\'s speech: Effective Multilateralism 
and UN-EU Cooperation 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) In an October 14 speech to the National Forum of 
Europe in Dublin, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for 
increased UN-EU cooperation to fulfill the goals of the 2003 
UN-EU Declaration on Crisis Management.  UNSYG Annan 
commended Ireland\'s efforts during its EU Presidency to make 
such cooperation more structured, substantive, and 
broad-based.  He welcomed, in particular, the development of 
EU \"capabilities\" in the context of the European Security and 
Defense Policy (a reference to the EU battlegroups 
initiative, whereby Member States would establish 10 
divisions of 1,500 troops within three years for rapid 
deployment to conflict zones).  Citing the French-led Artemis 
Operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003 as a 
model for UN-EU cooperation, UNSYG Annan noted that the EU 
could address crisis situations with speedier deployments and 
more specialized skills than typical UN peace-keepers.  He 
cautioned that these strengthened EU capabilities should not 
lead Member States to diminish their troop contributions to 
UN blue-helmet missions, and he lauded Ireland\'s decades-long 
participation in UN peace-keeping operations.  Continuing the 
theme of effective multilateralism, UNSYG Annan urged 
collective action to address other international challenges, 
such as HIV/AIDS, economic development, and the Darfur crisis. 
 
---------------------------------- 
Irish Comments: Differing Views on 
Neutrality 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) In remarks introducing UNSYG Annan, Foreign Minister 
Dermot Ahern emphasized that the UN was the \"ultimate 
guarantor\" of Ireland\'s freedom and safety.  He cited 
Ireland\'s view that unilateral action by any country or 
regional group could not resolve challenges facing the 
international community.  Ireland thus supported collective 
approaches to security and had made UN-EU cooperation in 
crisis management a central focus of its EU presidency.  FM 
Ahern emphasized that joint UN-EU efforts on conflict 
prevention spanned beyond military capabilities to include 
diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian instruments.  He 
pointed out that the GOI would not allow Ireland\'s stance of 
military neutrality to be eroded.  Rather, the \"triple-lock\" 
policy would remain: Ireland would only undertake overseas 
military action with UN, Cabinet, and Dail (Parliament) 
authorization.  Like UNSYG Annan, Ahern also called for 
effective multilateralism on issues like economic 
development, and he promised that Ireland would meet its 
Millennium goal of allocating 0.7 percent of GNP to 
development aid. 
 
4.  (U) Immediate reaction from the audience of several 
hundred included comments from opposition party Fine Gael 
leader Enda Kenny that Ireland was not neutral, but merely 
unaligned.  Kenny commended UNSYG Annan for re-energizing the 
UN, and he urged Annan to build a collective will among UNSC 
members.  A Fine Gael colleague, Gay Mitchell, called for an 
end to Ireland\'s triple-lock policy, which he described as 
\"nonsense.\"  Mitchell recommended that Ireland should instead 
decide to take part in overseas military missions on a 
case-by-case basis.  A member of the Sinn Fein party observed 
that the UN should have its own force, adding that 
\"outsourcing\" to the EU or the United States would not solve 
the world\'s problems and could make the UN redundant. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
DFA Reaction: An Opportunity for Public Education; 
Government Decision on Battlegroups Not Yet Ready 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
5.  (C) In a separate conversation with emboff, the GOI 
welcomed UNSYG Annan\'s speech as an opportunity to educate 
the Irish public on the legitimacy of Irish participation in 
UN-EU crisis management cooperation.  According to Julian 
Clare, Department of Foreign Affairs First Secretary for UN 
Affairs, Irish citizens are confused as to whether Ireland 
might be drifting away from its traditional military 
neutrality, having recently participated in NATO-led 
operations in Bosnia (SFOR) and Kosovo (KFOR).  Proposals for 
Ireland to join up with EU battlegroups contributed to the 
sense of drift.  UNSYG Annan\'s address, said Clare, made 
clear that joint UN-EU crisis management was consistent with 
the collective approach to international security that had 
long characterized Ireland\'s military/foreign policy  -- a 
point that Foreign Minister Ahern had stressed in his 
introductory remarks about the maintenance of Ireland\'s 
neutrality.  Clare recalled that the synergies involved in 
UN-EU crisis cooperation had featured prominently in a 
January 2004 discussion between UNSYG Annan and then Foreign 
Minister Cowen.  He added that the discussion had kicked off 
a concerted Irish effort during its EU presidency to shore up 
modalities for implementing the 2003 UN-EU Declaration on 
Crisis Management. 
 
6.  (C) The issue of Irish participation in battlegroups is 
still under consideration, with new ministers for defense and 
foreign affairs appointed only in late September.  DFA 
officials have said privately that they favor Irish 
participation, both on the merits and because they believe 
overall Irish weight in the EU would be helped by their 
ability to contribute to the EU\'s defense ambitions. 
Meanwhile, Irish Defense Forces are exploring the modalities 
of Irish participation, including whether to contribute niche 
forces that could latch onto any battlegroup or to commit 
troops to one specific battlegroup.  Officials note that the 
GOI does not view the EU\'s November 22 Capabilities 
Commitments Conference as a deadline for making specific 
commitments to the battlegroups, but recognize that they need 
to bring some indication of their intentions to the table. 
One contact said Ireland does not see UNSYG Annan\'s choice of 
Dublin for a speech on UN-EU crisis management cooperation as 
an attempt to pressure the GOI to contribute personnel to the 
battlegroups.  Rather, the Dublin venue helps to emphasize 
the collectivist model for UN-EU cooperation, as embodied in 
long-standing Irish participation in UN-sanctioned 
peace-keeping operations.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR WEIGHS IN WITH ENVIRONMENT MINISTER 
AGAINST GUM TAX 
 
 
1.  On October 18, the Ambassador, Chicago-based Wrigleys CEO 
Ronald Waters, and UK Wrigleys Chief Officer Alistair Whalley 
met with the newly appointed Minister for the Environment and 
Local Government, Dick Roche, to discuss alternatives to the 
Irish Government\'s proposed 5-cent-per-pack chewing gum tax. 
The tax, which would raise revenues to clean streets soiled 
by discarded gum, would not change Ireland\'s permissive 
attitudes toward litter, while dampening gum sales, explained 
the Wrigleys representatives.  As an alternative, Wrigleys 
had offered the GOI a financial commitment to establish an 
industry board that would build anti-littering social 
awareness through educational programs and stronger 
enforcement of littering fines.  Waters mentioned that pilot 
programs using this approach in the UK had reduced gum litter 
by 50 percent, and the Ambassador added that the civic pride 
fostered by such programs would help to diminish littering 
and clean-up costs over the long run.  Waters also stressed 
that the industry continued to work on making gum more 
bio-degradable, with the challenge of retaining anti-cavity 
ingredients that had led the dental profession to endorse 
gum-chewing. 
 
2.  Roche said that the GOI sought a well-rounded approach to 
gum litter problems and would seriously consider Wrigleys 
proposal before the October 29 deadline on the public comment 
period for the proposed gum tax.  He noted that 90 million 
packs of gum were sold annually in Ireland and that discarded 
gum accounted for roughly 18 percent of food-related street 
litter, with the proportion rising as smokers switched to gum 
with the recent ban on smoking in public places.  He added 
that gum\'s stickiness led typical small towns to spend euro 
40,000 per year on street sprayings.  Roche acknowledged the 
logic in Wrigleys\' argument that changes in social behavior 
offered the best long-run solution to gum litter problems, 
but cautioned that the GOI was under pressure from local 
governments to be seen as tackling these problems in the two 
years left before general elections.  The tax, if 
implemented, would be a visible measure that would help local 
governments to cover clean-up costs in that short span, said 
Roche.  He added that the Department of the Environment had 
not made a final decision on the tax and would continue to 
consult with Wrigleys and the industry over the coming weeks. 
 
3.  Comment: Roche, a former International Visitors Program 
participant, is a close Embassy contact and favorably 
disposed toward the United States.  In his former post as 
Minister of State for European Affairs at the Department of 
Foreign Affairs, he was an important USG interlocutor during 
Ireland\'s recent EU presidency.  Roche was also a central 
player in Member States\' negotiations on the EU Constitution, 
and his appointment to the Environment Department was seen as 
a reward for such efforts.  Roche made environmental issues a 
focus of his 12-year parliamentary career and has told the 
Ambassador that he entered politics out of anger over illegal 
waste dumps in his Wicklow constituency.

REF: SECSTATE 213824 
 
Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on October 19 to 
Maurice Biggar, Deputy Director for International Terrorism & 
Illicit Drugs, and his colleague, Eoin Duggan at the DFA. 
Biggar stated that the last EU Clearinghouse Meeting on 
Terrorism took place in June and the decision was made to 
postpone officially condemning the Maoists in Nepal. 
However, recent events in Nepal have changed the situation 
and the Clearinghouse will review the situation at the next 
meeting.  After 9/11, all terrorism responses have been 
handled at the EU level instead of by individual countries. 
Biggar explained that they would prefer to keep it at the EU 
level and that they won\'t independently freeze assets or 
condemn the group unless the EU collectively deems it 
necessary.  This is largely due to the fact that the GOI can 
not act alone as a member of the EU and not because of a lack 
of conviction in stopping terrorism financing.  On the 
contrary, Biggar emphasized the need for a political solution 
sooner rather than later.  He says the key issue is whether 
or not labeling the group as terrorists will indeed put 
pressure on the group to negotiate or if it will only 
aggravate the situation.  That being said, the EU and the GOI 
have the Maoist insurgency in Nepal under active 
consideration.

Classified By: POL/ECON COUNSELOR MARY DALY FOR 
REASONS 1.4.(B) AND (D) 
 
1.(C) Summary. Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on 
October 19 to Maurice Biggar, Deputy Director for 
International Terrorism & Illicit Drugs and his colleague, 
Eoin Duggan, at the DFA.  According to Biggar and Duggan the 
USG domestic designation of IARA is an issue of concern as it 
targets an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Buisir.  The GOI has no 
information on JTJ operations within Ireland.  The IARA 
designation came as a surprise, but not an unwelcome one. 
Ireland does not currently have legal recourse to freeze 
assets of suspected terrorism financiers.  The GOI also does 
not have far-reaching intelligence capabilities, so greatly 
appreciates information-sharing and cooperation with the USG. 
 If both such designations are approved through the UN 1267 
Sanctions Committee, the EU will follow suit, thereby 
requiring legal action in Ireland and allowing Irish 
authorities to freeze assets of Buisir.  The Irish are likely 
to welcome such action.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
List 62: The Islamic African Relief Agency (IARA), Ibrahim 
Buisir 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2.(C) Biggar had no new information to report regarding the 
IARA; however, Ibrahim Buisir, who was named last week as 
having ties to Al-Qaeda, is certainly of interest as a dual 
Irish-Libyan with links to terrorist financing.  Buisir\'s 
designation on the US domestic list came as a surprise to the 
Irish, and the Irish government would have appreciated a 
heads up.  That said, the Irish also consider Buisir to be a 
problem.  Recently, they tried to prosecute him for credit 
card fraud but he was released on a technicality.  He is now 
living on welfare. 
 
3.(C) The USG domestic designation of Buisir does not change 
his status.  As an Irish citizen, he is free to move his 
assets and to travel, both within country and abroad. 
Current Irish law does not allow for the arrest of an 
individual suspected of terrorism financing unless the EU has 
designated the person.  (Note: A criminal and terrorism law 
is pending ratification this fall.)  If the USG designation 
is pursued and approved by the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee, 
the EU will automatically adopt it, allowing Ireland\'s 
Central Bank legal means to freeze his assets.  The process 
from the EU approval to Irish application usually takes a 
matter of days.  The Irish are likely to welcome this 
designation. 
 
4.(C) Buisir has successfully used the press to gain sympathy 
in the past.  The DFA has concerns that he may do so again, 
claiming persecution by the USG.  To date, though, only one 
article has made it in the press regarding the designation 
and Buisir has refrained from public comments. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
List 63: Jama\'at Al-Tawhid Wa\'al-Jihad (JTJ) 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.(U) The GOI has no information on current activities of 
Jama\'at Al-Tawhid Wa\'al-Jihad (JTJ) in Ireland.  The DFA 
welcomes this designation and information sharing on 
terrorism financing.  Biggar emphasized that, as with Buisir, 
the Irish government cannot act until the UN and EU have 
acted. 
 
---------------- 
Working Together 
---------------- 
 
6. For the purposes of better understanding the GOI, it is 
important to highlight the eagerness and willingness the DFA 
expressed regarding the fight against terrorism.  Biggar 
mentioned that the DFA and the Gardai (Irish national police) 
do not have as close a working relationship as they would 
like. As a result, information sharing is limited and rare. 
Thus, the USG briefings with the DFA are well received and 
appreciated.  The free flow of information is always welcome.

SUBJECT: IRELAND EXPANDS LINKS THROUGH PM AHERN\'S ASIA TRIP 
 
REF: HANOI 2795 
 
1.  (SBU) Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern\'s October 
7-16 visit to Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Bahrain was 
an opportunity to pursue new diplomatic, commercial, and 
humanitarian links for Ireland in the region, according to 
Irish Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) officials who spoke 
with emboff.  The officials said that Ireland\'s status as a 
small, open economy, dependent on trade and foreign direct 
investment, mandated this form of international outreach.  On 
the diplomatic front, Ahern announced on the margins of the 
October 8-9 Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi that Ireland 
would open an embassy in Vietnam and include the country in 
its overseas development program.  In Ho Chi Minh City, Ahern 
opened the Christina Noble Center, an Irish charity for 
disadvantaged children.  In Malaysia, Singapore, and Bahrain, 
Ahern promoted Ireland as a foreigner-friendly gateway for 
Asian investment in Europe.  DFA officials noted that while 
no trade deals were signed, Ahern seeded the ground for 
commercial agreements involving the expat Irish business 
communities in those countries.  More generally, the stops in 
Malaysia and Singapore offered chances for Ahern to compare 
the lessons of Ireland\'s Celtic Tiger economy with his 
counterparts\' Asian Tiger experiences. 
 
2.  (SBU) The DFA officials pointed out that human rights had 
also featured on Ahern\'s agenda, as the Prime Minister 
reported during his October 20 briefing on the trip for the 
Dail (Parliament).  Ahern told the Dail that he had 
criticized Burma\'s ASEM representatives for not having made 
\"a semblance of progress\" and for having \"broken their 
promises\" regarding political reforms, human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.  Ahern also recounted that \"listening 
to the responses of their representatives, it appears that 
they do not accept any of the criticisms of the rest of the 
democratic world.\"  Ahern informed the Dail that GOI plans to 
establish diplomatic relations with Burma were on hold, due 
to the Burmese Government\'s failure to release Aung San Suu 
Kyi (ASSK) from house arrest.  (In April, during Ireland\'s EU 
presidency, the GOI had made known its plans to exchange 
ambassadors with Burma on a non-residential basis under 
certain conditions, including ASSK\'s release.)

Commission would reiterate its commitment to the six-party

McIntyre could not predict whether the Commission would

were unaware of the developments in Venezuela and, following 
our meetings, asked their embassy in Mexico to gather more

tend to take a strong stand on human rights and would likely 
support an EU statement; since they have no embassy in

-- Aer Lingus, the Irish national carrier.  The Irish 
Government, the airline\'s principal share-holder, recently 
announced that plans to privatize the airline have been put 
on hold indefinitely. 
 
-- An Post, the national postal service.  An Post also 
provides communication, distribution, logistics, and 
financial-related services. 
 
-- Bord Gais Eireann (Irish Gas Board).  The Irish Gas Board 
is Ireland\'s principal state-owned utility, along with the 
Electricity Supply Board, which is named on the list of 
covered Irish entities. 
 
-- Bord na Mona (Irish Peat Board).  Bord na Mona supplies 
peat, a traditional source of energy in Ireland, and 
peat-based fuels for generation of electricity and heating. 
 
-- Coilllte (Irish Forestry Board).  Coillte is responsible 
for management of state forests and is involved in log 
harvesting, transport, marketing, and sales. 
 
-- Irish Aviation Authority.  The Authority oversees air 
traffic management and air safety regulation for the Irish 
aviation industry. 
 
-- Radio Teilifis Eireann (RTE).  RTE is the Irish Public 
Service Broadcasting Organization, which operates several 
television and radio stations. 
 
-- Railway Procurement Agency.  This agency is responsible 
for the procurement of railway infrastructure and systems 
used by Iamrod Eireann (Irish Rail), which is named on the 
list of covered Irish entities.  The agency also oversees 
Dublin\'s new light-rail transit system, the Luas. 
 
-- Voluntary Health Insurance Board (VHI).  VHI is the 
largest provider of voluntary private health insurance in 
Ireland. 
 
8.  Post examined the Irish Government\'s procurement website 
and found that county and city councils featured most 
prominently among government entities that have solicited 
procurement bids.  Economic officer Joe Young 
(youngjm@state.gov) can be contacted for a comprehensive list 
of the councils. 
 
9.  Post has no specific recommendations with respect to 
prioritizing additional services openings.

implied.  He noted that the EU-3 were planning a follow-up 
meeting (now set for November 5, according to October 29 
media reports) with Iranian negotiators ahead of the November 
25-26 IAEA Board of Governors meeting.

4.  (C) EU views on the current situation in the Middle East 
were not significantly divergent from U.S. positions, said 
Keown.  He noted that the EU had set forth three criteria to 
judge whether Prime Minister Sharon\'s planned withdrawal from 
Gaza would be consistent with the Roadmap: (1) the withdrawal 
must not lead to increased settlement activity in the West 
Bank; (2) the withdrawal must be orderly; and (3) the 
withdrawal must be conducted in consultation with the 
Palestinians.  The EU hoped to avoid a worst-case scenario in 
which the withdrawal would create a political vacuum in Gaza, 
with the Palestinian Authority unable to assume governance in 
any meaningful way.  Keown recalled that the EU had made 
clear its support for the Palestinian Authority in the 
withdrawal process during October 25 discussions in Brussels 
with Foreign Minister Sha\'ath. 
 
5.  (U) In October 27 testimony before the Irish parliament\'s 
Joint Committee on European Affairs, Noel Treacy, Minister of 
State for European Affairs, said that the first item on the 
Irish and EU agenda with the new U.S. Administration would be 
a request for U.S. re-engagement in MEEP.  The Joint 
Committee also passed a resolution the same day calling for 
continued action beyond the Gaza withdrawal to sustain the 
peace process. 
 
------ 
Russia 
------ 
 
6.  (C) Keown said that the November 11 EU-Russia Summit in 
the Hague would address four subject areas as agreed at the 
2003 EU-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg: economic relations, 
security, justice and home affairs, and 
cultural/education/research ties.  He cited EU hopes that the 
upcoming Summit would yield action plans on each subject and 
that this form of engagement would offer opportunities to 
address concerns on media freedom, civil society, 
counter-terrorism cooperation, and regional conflicts.  Keown 
also pointed out that the centralizing tendencies apparent in 
Putin\'s administration have a deep historical basis. 
 
----- 
Sudan 
----- 
 
7.  (C) The EU had no differences with the United States on 
objectives for Sudan, particularly regarding the lead role to 
be played by the African Union (AU) in Darfur, observed 
Keown.  The EU\'s continuing impression, he said, was that the 
AU had the political will and personnel for stepped-up 
deployment in Sudan, but lacked the required infrastructure. 
The AU had thus come to the EU with extensive requests for 
assistance, and the EU had responded with commitments on 
funds and material, including basic items like boots.  Keown 
said he did not know whether the additional 80 million euros 
pledged by the EU on October 20 for Sudan would be in place 
by mid-November, but he noted the EU\'s intention to make the 
tranche available as quickly as possible. 
 
------- 
Somalia 
------- 
 
8.  (C) The EU welcomed recent progress in Somalia\'s 
reconciliation process as good news in the making, noted 
Keown.  He added that, as the process moved forward, the 
primary challenge would be whether the Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) headed by Abdullahi Yusuf, a leader from the 
northern Puntland, would be able to establish control in 
southern Somalia. 
 
------- 
Ukraine 
------- 
 
9.  (C) The EU, which was contributing a monitoring mission 
for the October 31 Ukrainian vote, shared U.S. disappoitment 
with failed attempts to promote a free and fair election 
process, observed.  He expected that the EU would continue to 
seek consultations with the United States once the election 
results were known. 
 
------ 
Kosovo 
------ 
 
10.  (C) Keown explained that the EU was deeply engaged in 
efforts to support the economic viability of Kosovo, which 
was tightly linked to progress on political and security 
issues.  Keown was unaware, however, of any specific progress 
on EU proposals to develop an economic development strategy, 
as called for in the Eide Report.  He said that while the EU 
had welcomed the outcome of the October 23 Kosovo Assembly 
elections, the effective boycott of the polls by more than 85 
percent of Kosovo Serbs had detracted from the outcome.  The 
EU was now focused on the international community\'s mid-2005 
review of progress made by Kosovo\'s elected officials in 
meeting standards of accountability. 
 
------ 
Cyprus 
------ 
 
11.  (C) It was unclear when there would be agreement within 
the EU on the regulation for direct trade with North Cyprus 
and on aid disbursements, acknowledged Keown.  He observed 
that progress on these fronts had been slow due to political 
and legal constraints, not because of any cooling in the EU\'s 
commitment to support movement toward a settlement.  These 
constraints derived from an unprecedented situation in which 
the EU was attempting to work with a region within a Member 
State that was occupied by a Candidate State.  Keown 
explained that the EU\'s decision before the April referendum 
to earmark funds for disbursement \"pending a future 
settlement\" had also complicated attempts to disburse aid now.

SUBJECT: IRISH/CHINA ARMS EMBARGO: NOT RIPE TO LIFT YET 
 
 
Classified By: Charge Jon Benton for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  On October 19, a delegation comprised of 
State DRL and PM and DoD J-5 visited members of the Irish 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Parliament, and Amnesty 
International-Irish Section, to argue against the EU lifting 
its arms embargo against China.  Until recently, Irish 
officials had said that the embargo would be lifted unless 
the UK blocked it.  This time, they said that no EU decision 
is imminent, and they described the EU as slowly and 
carefully reviewing whether to lift the embargo.  EU 
governments, the Irish said, are increasingly concerned about 
non-proliferation and security, while parliaments and the 
public largely oppose lifting the embargo on human rights 
grounds.  Cliona Manahan, Director for Asia and the Pacific, 
said the Irish government is concerned that lifting the 
embargo would adversely affect security in the region and 
send the Chinese the wrong signal on human rights.  She said 
the GoI makes those points in the EU. The Irish parliament 
and Amnesty International clearly supported maintaining the 
embargo. Comment:  The Irish government was much more 
forthcoming this time, even going so far as to say that it 
would not be \"ripe\" to lift the embargo now.  However, it 
studiously avoided saying that it opposes lifting the 
embargo.  We suspect that while Ireland is willing to raise 
concerns within the EU, it would not as a small country be at 
the center of opposition, nor be willing to be the sole 
nay-sayer.  End Summary and Comment. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
DFA Sees Little Progress on Human Rights; 
Shares Security Concerns 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Cliona Manahan, Director for Asia and the Pacific, 
said that China has made only limited improvements in its 
human rights situation.  She said that 15 years after 
Tianaman, there are persistent problems with torture, 
continued \"re-education\" through labor camps, and lack of 
progress on UN human rights mechanisms.  In general, she 
said, the increasing openness of the economy and society has 
not extended to civic or political life.  To lift the embargo 
now, Manahan said, would be seen by China as vindication of 
its token improvement in human rights and a sign of 
diminished EU interest in human rights.  At the same time, 
she said, the Irish parliament and public remain deeply 
concerned about human rights in China, including the 
situation in Tibet and of the Falun Gong, and about 
ramifications for Taiwan. 
 
3.(C)  In response to the U.S. description of security 
concerns, the Irish said that they shared those concerns and 
raised them regularly within the EU. Interestingly, they 
offered that Ireland does not see lifting the embargo as 
necessary for gaining investment opportunities.  Business, 
Manahan said, is booming anyway.  She also said that adding 
human rights clauses to a renewed U.S.-EU technical 
cooperation agreement would give the U.S. and EU another tool 
with respect to third countries. 
 
--------------- 
EU\'s Next Steps 
--------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Manahan said that the EU is sensing \"dialogue 
fatigue\" among the Chinese.  She suggested that it would be 
helpful to convene the Bern group so that all countries 
holding human rights dialogues could compare notes and 
coordinate future actions.  Ireland, she said, is beginning 
to wonder whether China engages in dialogue for optics only, 
with no intention of making changes.  Unfortunately, she 
said, the EU\'s review of China\'s human rights situation was 
done at the same time as Iran\'s, and China looked good in 
comparison.  Similarly, some in the EU consider that lifting 
the embargo on Libya sets a precedent for China. She noted 
that China is playing a very aggressive diplomatic game in a 
wide range of contacts in EU member states and international 
organizations.  She also said the EU is grappling with what 
it means, in the 21st century, to have a \"strategic 
partnership\" with a country such as China.  A strategic 
partnership would seem to be one without arms embargos 
attached.  While human rights arguments work well with the 
public, who in turn put pressure on governments, she said 
that among governments and elites, the political/military 
arguments against lifting the embargo are more effective. 
 
---------- 
Parliament 
---------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
Irish Parliament welcomed the opportunity to receive the U.S. 
delegation and to discuss the EU arms embargo against China. 
They said that Ireland is especially interested in this 
matter as it pertains to human rights, an important subject 
for the Irish public.  The parliamentarians noted that some 
progress has been achieved in human rights, but not enough. 
Dr. Michael Woods, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
stated that China has made considerable progress in 
socio-economic terms, but concerns remain in terms of freedom 
of the press, assembly, and religion.  Woods also expressed 
concern with Internet restrictions and violations of minority 
rights.  According to Woods, China is sending a mixed picture 
at best; the progress is commendable, but not enough. 
Another member of parliament, Bernard Allen, raised regional 
security issues surrounding Taiwan and expressed concern that 
the lifting of the embargo might start a new Asian arms race. 
 
--------------------- 
Amnesty International 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) In a meeting with Amnesty International\'s Irish 
Section, Director Sean Love voiced the same concerns about 
human rights as the DFA and parliament.  At the same time, he 
voiced his frustration at the lack of interest at the 
Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in requiring 
corporate responsibility for human rights in trade 
agreements.  In a separate follow-up conversation with 
emboff, a DETE official confirmed that there is no 
requirement for Irish businesses to raise human rights in 
their commercial dealings with China.  He also noted that 
there are no Irish plans to sell weapons to the Chinese.

7.  (U) Members of Parliament and Government officials: 
Dr. Michael Woods, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee 
(Fianna Fail), Dan Wallace, Former Lord Mayor of Cork (Fianna

met with senior members of the DFA, including Cliona Manahan, 
Director of Asia and Pacific, Mary O\'Connor-EU External 
Relations, Sean O\'Regan-Human Rights, and Paul 
Barnwell-Disarmament and Nonproliferation.  A further meeting 
convened with Amnesty International\'s Irish Section.

1. (C) Emboff raised points in reftels with contacts in the 
Justice Ministry and Department of Foreign Affairs.  Both 
ministries greatly appreciated the information in Ref B. 
Regarding Ref A, both ministries confirmed that there are no 
legal grounds under which they can prevent Buisir\'s travel at 
this time, nor can they limit the amount of money he could 
carry with him, should he decide to travel.  They did 
confirm, however, that he is under \"close observation\".  He 
is living openly and still receives welfare payments from the 
State.  According to DoJ, should designation move to the 
level of UNSCR 1267 or 1373, Ireland will automatically 
freeze assets of Buisir, including stopping his welfare 
payments.  The same would happen if the EU Clearinghouse were 
to designate Buisir.  We are asking the ministries to clarify 
under what conditions they could limit his travel.  (Buisir 
is an Irish citizen.) Both DFA and DOJ contacts added that 
they were pleasantly surprised at the lack of public 
attention on this case.  Since the initial designation, the 
press has published only two articles, both of which were 
accurate and fair.  In the past, Buisir has pled his case to 
the press to garner public sympathy.  For reasons unknown, 
this time, he has not. 
 
3. (C) Contacts also shared information on current and 
prospective laws. The current penalty for financing terrorism 
is a maximum fine of 3000 euros.  The Criminal Justice and 
Terrorist Offences Bill of 2002 will be debated the first 
week of November.  The DFA expects it to pass as an Act.  If 
so, the penalty for terrorism financing will become a fine of 
10 million euros and 20 years in prison.  The Minister of 
Justice will also have authority to place assets into High 
Court following a Gardai investigation.  One of the reasons 
for the delay of this Bill is that Ireland has very strong 
private property laws, which will cause some debate when the 
Bill is tabled.  When the Bill becomes Act, as expected, 
Ireland will have more recourse to act bilaterally, in cases 
such as Buisir, and not have to wait through UN 1267 or 1373 
clearinghouse processes.  GOI officials expect the Bill to 
pass, because authorities want more legislative power to 
fight terrorism financing.  In the meantime, they are likely 
to support and welcome designation of Buisir, and IARA onto 
either 1373 or 1267 lists.

SUBJECT: MARY KELLY CONVICTED FOR DAMAGING U.S. MILITARY 
AIRCRAFT 
 
 
1.  On October 28, anti-war activist Mary Kelly was convicted 
by a jury at Ennis Circuit Court of criminal damage without 
lawful excuse of a 737 U.S. navy plane at Shannon Airport on 
January 29, 2003.  The jury found Kelly guilty of causing 
damage of USD 1.5 million after she took an axe to the 
aircraft, which had landed at the airport en route from Fort 
Worth, Texas, to a military logistics base in Italy.  The 
conviction comes after a jury had failed to reach a verdict 
in the case in June 2003, the first time that Kelly had been 
tried for the offense. 
 
2.  In contrast to the first trial, Judge Carroll Moran did 
not permit Kelly in this six-day hearing to make a political 
argument in her defense.  Representing herself, Kelly had 
argued that she had lawful excuse to damage the aircraft as 
she was trying to save life in Iraq.  In comments to the 
jury, Judge Moran said that the defense of lawful excuse did 
not apply in this case, since there was \"no connection in 
time or space between the act carried out by Kelly and the 
person or property she was claiming to protect.\"  Moran also 
refused expert witness accounts on Kelly\'s behalf by former 
assistant UN Secretary General Denis Haliday and professor of 
international law, Curtis Doebbler.  The judge explained that 
this was not a case to \"consider the legality of the war in 
Iraq\" and that Kelly\'s act was \"simple vigilantism.\" 
 
3.  The sentencing was adjourned until November 5 to allow 
Kelly to consult attorneys to consider a plea for sentence 
mitigation.  The maximum sentence for the offense is ten 
years in prison, though attorneys with whom Post has 
discussed the case doubt that the final sentence will be that 
severe.  Any appeal would involve an application to the Court 
of Criminal Appeal, a process that could take between six and 
twelve months.

14-15 VISIT TO IRELAND 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The Irish Government and Embassy Dublin 
warmly welcome your upcoming visit to Dublin.  Past and 
present Irish policy-makers look forward to substantive 
discussion with you on the dramatic transformation of 
Ireland\'s economy.  I am planning a dinner in your honor that 
will include EU Commissioner-designate and former Irish 
Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.  You will also meet with 
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, Finance Minister Brian Cowen, 
and other \"architects\" of the Celtic Tiger economy.  Besides 
explaining Ireland\'s economic achievements, these leaders 
will likely question you about the recent U.S. elections, 
particularly the implications for Europe.  Ireland sees 
itself as a bridge between \"Boston and Berlin,\" and your 
interlocutors will seek the second Bush Administration\'s 
views on strengthening the trans-Atlantic relationship.  End 
summary. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Ireland -- A Confident EU Member State 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Ireland\'s economic and diplomatic successes have 
boosted the country\'s standing in the EU and have given Irish 
citizens unprecedented national confidence.  In less than a 
generation, Ireland has grown from one of the poorest EU 
Member States to one of the richest (in GDP per capita), 
largely on the strength of government policies that espoused 
open trade and investment, low corporate taxes, good labor 
relations, low government debt, and prudent use of EU support 
funds.  Although the Celtic Tiger stumbled somewhat with the 
post-9/11 global slowdown, a surge in housing construction 
has Ireland on track to achieve roughly 5% annual GDP growth 
in 2004, the highest in the EU.  Moreover, Ireland won high 
marks in Europe for its recent EU presidency, which saw the 
accession of ten new EU member states, the successful 
negotiation of the EU Constitutional Treaty, and the launch 
of the U.S.-EU Trans-Atlantic Economic Partnership.  These 
accomplishments have contributed to Ireland,s self-image as 
an effective broker within the EU and a role model for new EU 
Member States. 
 
------------------- 
Links with the U.S. 
------------------- 
 
3.   (SBU) While Ireland is a player in the EU and continues 
to benefit from EU markets and support funds, Irish leaders 
attach equal importance to relations with the United States. 
Beyond long-standing cultural ties, U.S. trade and investment 
have been the twin engines of the Celtic Tiger economy, as 
you will likely hear in your discussion with the American 
Chamber of Commerce.  There are roughly 570 U.S. firms 
operating in Ireland, employing over 90,000 people and 
accounting for a third of Ireland,s annual exports.  These 
firms include most major biotechnology, IT, and financial 
services companies, which use Ireland as a gateway to EU 
markets.  Last year, new U.S. investment in Ireland reached 
$9 billion, compared with $3.8 billion in China.  The central 
role that U.S. businesses have played in Ireland\'s economic 
transformation, however, is a story not often told by the 
Irish media, which tend to take a negative view of the United 
States, particularly our efforts in Iraq. 
 
-------------------- 
Political Background 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Ironically, the party that has led Ireland through 
most of the Celtic Tiger era, Fianna Fail, has seen a recent 
erosion in its political support.  In the June 2004 local and 
European Parliament elections, Fianna Fail lost a number of 
seats to opposition parties, led by Fine Gael and the upstart 
Sinn Fein.  Commentators attributed Fianna Fail\'s poor 
showing to the electorate\'s sense that not all segments of 
society have shared the benefits of the Celtic Tiger economy, 
as reflected in growing crime rates and other social 
problems.  In a bid to re-energize the party and government 
ahead of the 2007 general elections, Prime Minister 
(Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern re-shuffled his cabinet in late 
September.  The move presages an effort by Fianna Fail to 
recast its image as a party more attuned to social concerns. 
 
--------------------- 
The Government Budget 
--------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Estimates for the 2005 government budget, to be 
released on November 18, will set forth Fianna Fail\'s 
economic priorities in its bid to rebuild political support. 
Although a budget deficit was originally forecast for 2004, 
increased revenues tied to economic growth and one-off tax 
collections on off-shore bank accounts will yield a year-end 
budget surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP.  Some ruling party 
members have pressed new Finance Minister Brian Cowen to use 
this unexpected windfall to address hot-button social issues, 
including Ireland,s dysfunctional health care system and 
outdated transportation infrastructure.  The Irish Central 
Bank and most economists, however, have cautioned against 
steep increases in government spending that could fuel 
inflation, particularly with robust GDP growth predicted for 
2005.  In recent public comments, Minister Cowen has 
indicated that that the budget will offer tax relief for 
lower income groups, but will avoid inflationary pressures 
that could raise wage demands and erode Ireland,s 
competitiveness. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Competitiveness -- The Central Focus 
------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU) Maintaining Ireland\'s economic competitiveness is 
increasingly the focus of the Government as it attempts to 
safeguard the prosperity achieved during the Celtic Tiger 
period.  Although inflation in 2004 has converged toward the 
EU average of roughly 2%, EU studies indicate that Ireland is 
now the most expensive country in Europe.  Ireland\'s 12.5 
percent corporate tax rate remains a powerful draw for 
foreign direct investment.  Over the longer term, though, 
Ireland will face challenges in competing with alternative 
FDI destinations such as China, India, and the EU accession 
states, which boast educated, low-wage workers and 
opportunities for low-cost manufacturing.  Several 
government-commissioned task forces have advocated a strategy 
whereby Ireland would move increasingly out of simple 
manufacturing operations and into innovative, higher-value 
goods and services.  This strategy will require an education 
system that can produce graduates with skills in technology 
and physical sciences to support a knowledge-based economy.

Northern Ireland Negotiations 
----------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Negotiations on a final settlement for Northern 
Ireland are likely to intensify during the week of your 
visit.  The British and Irish Governments are preparing a 
proposal for Northern Ireland\'s unionist and republican 
political parties on a settlement that would restore Northern 
political institutions over the coming months.  This proposal 
will likely build upon progress that was achieved in the 
September Leeds Castle talks, where Sinn Fein signaled the 
IRA\'s willingness to cease paramilitary activity and 
decommission weapons as part of a final deal.  Northern 
Ireland is the fastest growing region in the UK, and a 
political settlement would help to accelerate growing 
inter-Ireland trade and investment.

DEADLINE

Summary 
------- 
 1.  (C)  On November 14, Michael Collins, advisor to PM 
Ahern, told Amb Kenny that Ireland and the UK had just agreed 
a timetable for the Northern Ireland peace process.  On 
Wednesday, November 17, the governments will present papers 
to the parties (the Irish will present to Sinn Fein and the 
British to DUP).  The parties will then have until November 
24 to respond.  On November 26, the two prime ministers will 
hold a joint press conference in Belfast, either announcing a 
deal, if one has been reached, or describing to the public 
what the deal could have been.  They hope the public then 
would pressure the parties to take the deal.  Collins 
described the two governments as being perfectly in sync, and 
in agreement that what is on offer now from Sinn Fein should 
be taken.  He said it was \"surreal\" that a deal has not yet 
been reached given the significance of Sinn Fein\'s offer and 
the fact that points of disagreement are very minor.  The 
problem, he said, is DUP reluctance.  The key is to bring the 
Rev. Ian Paisley on board.  This, he said, would be easier to 
do if the IRA would agree to publish photos of materiel as 
part of the decommissioning process. He asked that the USG 
raise this matter with Sinn Fein.  End Summary 
 
DUP named biggest obstacle to deal 
---------------------------------- 
2. (C)  Collins said the main problem now is DUP\'s reluctance 
to agree to anything before elections.  Both governments 
believe Paisley holds the key and that if he agrees, he can 
bring the rest of his party along. DUP, Collins said, already 
has agreed to all but one word of the IRA statement.  The 
only outstanding issue in the IRA statement is whether IRA 
will agree to define itself as being in a \"peaceful mode\" 
following decommissioning.  As for decommissioning, Collins 
said the parties have agreed that two independent witnesses 
would be allowed, but have not agreed on what the witnesses 
could say publicly.  More significantly, the Irish believe 
the Rev Ian Paisley is unlikely to accept a deal unless IRA 
agrees to publish photographs of materiel.  Sinn Fein has 
told the GOI that IRA twice has refused to publish photos. 
Collins said it would be very helpful if the U.S. would weigh 
in with Sinn Fein.  (The proposal is for the IRA to take 
photos of the materiel, with witnesses present, before 
decommissioning, not of the decommissioning itself.  They 
would only be made public after an Executive is formed.) 
 
Timeline if a deal is reached 
----------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Collins said that if a deal is reached, four 
statements will follow:  the IRA\'s statement on 
decommissioning; the UK\'s statement on demilitarization and 
\"On the Runs\"; a DUP statement accepting a timeline for 
devolution of policing and justice; and a Sinn Fein statement 
agreeing to joint policing.  The governments would foresee 
full decommissioning by the end of December, a shadow 
assembly in January, the UK lifting suspension of the 
assembly in February, and an executive in place in March.  If 
a deal is not reached, Collins said the governments have not 
fully fleshed out next steps, but will want to find a way to 
take the IRA\'s offer.  Sinn Fein, he said, has not clarified 
what its \"price\" would be, but the GOI assumes it would 
require a greater role for Ireland in Northern Ireland.

1. Emboff, drawing on reftel points, spoke on November 15 to 
UN Desk Officer at the DFA, Eoin Duggan.  Duggan said that 
Ireland will not initially look to contribute additional 
funds or personnel to UNFICYP. He said that Ireland has a 
strong record of support for peacekeeping efforts, dating 
back to 30 years of personnel, logistics and financial 
contributions.  He added that the GOI is in a \"wait and see\" 
mode with regards to Cyprus, and will bear in mind any EU or 
EU member states\' consideration of support, but will not be 
the first to offer more financial contribution. 
 
2. According to Duggan, Ireland currently has 19 civilian 
police and 2 military officers participating in UNFICYP.  He 
said that the Irish see that the situation in Cyprus is such 
that an increase in the number of military troops is no 
longer needed, and the current level of support is 
satisfactory.

1. (C) On November 16, Emboff, drawing on reftel points, 
spoke to Austin Gormley, the DFA\'s Deputy Director for 
Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  Gormley, who was on 
the ground personally during the first Ukrainian election, 
stated that the GOI would be actively monitoring the second 
round of elections as well.  The GOI will increase its number 
of monitors from three to four, including representatives 
from its Embassy in Prague, the OSCE Mission in Vienna, a 
former military officer, and a Refugee Appeals Board 
representative.  Gormley said the EU views the high voter 
turnout as a positive democratic sign, but still urges the 
Ukrainian Government to address any reported election 
deficiencies and to ensure a free and fair election, 
especially in regards to equal media access for both 
candidates.  Gormley stated that the GOI agrees with the 
overall findings of the OSCE report, but he did not 
personally witness any intimidation, disturbances, or 
disruptions firsthand at his posting Northeast of Kiev. 
 
2. (C) Gormley believes the EU has paid significant attention 
to the fair and democratic administration of Ukrainian 
elections, as the Ukraine is a valued neighbor and partner. 
In addition, Ukraine falls under the European Neighborhood 
Policy (ENP), which aims to share the benefits of the 2004 
enlargement with neighboring countries through increased 
stability, security, and overall well being. Under this 
Policy, a fair and democratic election would strengthen 
EU-Ukraine relations.  Gormley explained that the depth of 
this relationship is directly proportional to the depth of 
Ukraine\'s commitment to reform.  That being said, those who 
perpetuate election fraud could be subject to consequences 
such as visa restrictions.  At this time, no visa bans exist 
for Ukraine.  It is not currently on the EU agenda to deny 
visas to Ukrainians, but if an EU ban were applied, then the 
GOI would certainly comply.

1.  (U) On November 17, Post delivered reftels\' talking 
points to Gerald Keown, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) 
EU correspondent. 
 
------ 
Turkey 
------ 
 
2.  (C) In a November 12 conversation with the Ambassador, 
Michael Collins, senior advisor to Prime Minister Ahern, said 
that Ireland would support Turkey\'s EU candidacy.  He noted 
that Ireland saw Turkey as an important market and did not 
have the same social concerns as those EU Member States with 
large Muslim populations.  Keown amplified these remarks with 
a more detailed explanation of where things stood in the EU. 
Ireland would support a European Council decision to begin 
early EU accession negotiations with Turkey in the context of 
an EU consensus on that step, said Keown.  He noted that 
Ireland acknowledged Turkey\'s efforts to fulfill the 
Copenhagen criteria, as did the Commission\'s October 6 report 
on the accession issue.  Keown expected that a decision 
endorsing early accession negotiations would include 
safeguard mechanisms for suspending negotiations in the event 
of significant policy reversals by the Turkish Government. 
He also pointed out that the December 17 European Council 
meeting would discuss the option of placing conditions on 
accession negotiations related to the implementation of 
Turkey\'s legislative and other reform programs, but that the 
same conditions would apply generally to any candidate 
country.  When emboff asked whether the EU would seek to 
apply more specific conditions in Turkey\'s case, Keown said 
that this would depend on Member States in which Turkey\'s 
accession posed a more serious domestic issue.  He added that 
an outstanding issue for Turkey was recognition of the 
Republic of Cyprus and that the possible amendment of 
Turkey\'s customs union agreement with the EU to incorporate 
the new Member States would be a positive step in that 
direction. 
 
----------- 
Middle East 
----------- 
 
3.  (C) The EU looked forward to close coordination with the 
Bush Administration in advancing the Middle East Peace 
Process, said Keown.  He did not know whether Ireland was 
considering contributions to the International Finance 
Corporation\'s Private Enterprise Partnership -- Middle East 
and North Africa (PEP-MENA).  He noted that Ireland and other 
EU Member States were examining ways to support small and 
medium enterprises in the region through the 
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Barcelona Process).  He added 
that the November 30 Euromed ministerial meeting would 
possibly address such assistance. 
 
----- 
China 
----- 
 
4.  (C) Keown said that the situation regarding the China 
arms embargo had not changed since the EU had decided in 
October on the need for further consultations at the 
technical level.  No European consensus on lifting the 
embargo was at hand.  Keown acknowledged that the November 
16-18 visit of Chinese Vice Premier Huang Ju had been an 
occasion to discuss the embargo as well as other issues, such 
as trade and human rights.  Vice Premier Huang, said Keown, 
had made clear China\'s desire that the embargo be lifted. 
His Irish interlocutors had repeated that the EU had not 
achieved consensus on the embargo issue. 
 
------ 
Kosovo 
------ 
 
5.  (C) The GOI agreed that local government/decentralization 
pilot projects in Kosovo should get underway as soon as 
possible, said Keown.  He noted that the Kosovo Serb boycott 
of the recent Kosovo elections had been unhelpful, but he 
expressed reservations about the U.S. point that work in 
Kosovo would continue even if Kosovo Serbs refused to 
participate.  Keown elaborated that outstanding issues could 
only be addressed on a cross-community basis.  He noted that 
politicians in Serbia had used the election boycott to 
political advantage, and he observed that progress in Kosovo 
would therefore require efforts to engage both Serbia and 
Kosovo\'s Serbian population. 
 
------- 
Belarus 
------- 
 
6.  (C) According to Keown, EU Member States are deeply 
pessimistic about Belarus.  He conceded that EU policy had 
not only been unsuccessful, but had also worked to isolate 
Belarusian society.  Ireland agreed that it was important to 
broach that isolation; the question was how.  He noted that 
efforts to engage members of society could expose them to 
risks of arrest or personal harm.  Keown expressed confidence 
that the Dutch EU Presidency, following the line taken during 
Ireland\'s presidency, would maintain a tough stance against 
the Belarusian Government.  The November 22 GAERC meeting 
would issue conclusions to that end. 
 
------ 
Cyprus 
------ 
 
7.  (C) Keown described the Cyprus situation as a failure on 
both sides.  He said the EU would concur that a strong aid 
and trade package was critical to the prospects of 
pro-solution forces in the north.  Legal and technical 
factors, however, stood behind proposals to conduct 
Commission programs from the south.  He acknowledged recent 
USG efforts to engage north Cyprus, and he said the EU 
continued to explore ways that were legally permissible to 
provide assistance to the north. 
 
---- 
ESDP 
---- 
 
8.  (C) Keown said that GOI support for closer EU-NATO 
coordination was a given.  The GOI, he added, was pleased 
that preparations for SFOR\'s drawdown were proceeding 
smoothly.  On the question of Irish participation in EU 
battlegroups, Keown noted that the GOI would not take any 
decision until after discussions at the upcoming EU Military 
Capabilities Conference.

SUBJECT: CHINESE VICE-PREMIER\'S VISIT SPARKS MINOR 
CONTROVERSIES 
 
Ref:  STATE 247288 
 
1.  (U) Chinese Vice-Premier Huang Ju\'s November 16-18 visit 
to Dublin was a minor source of controversy in Ireland, with 
media complaints about a press blackout as well as calls by 
Falun Gong practitioners for Huang\'s arrest.  During his 
stay, Huang met with President McAleese, Prime Minister 
Ahern, Deputy Prime Minister Harney, and several cabinet 
ministers.  The Irish Government received media criticism, 
however, for the fact that Huang\'s schedule did not include 
a press conference.  The National Union of Journalists said 
in a press release that the absence of opportunities for 
media questioning amounted to censorship.  Labor Party 
spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, Michael Higgins, also 
criticized the Government as being complicit in censorship. 
In response, Foreign Affairs Minister Dermot Ahern told 
local press that the GOI had raised the possibility of press 
conferences before Huang\'s visit, but that the Chinese had 
rejected the suggestion. 
 
2.  (U) Lawyers for five Falun Gong practitioners called for 
the arrest of Vice-Premier Huang.  One of the practitioners, 
Ming Zhao, holds refugee status in Ireland on the basis of 
alleged torture in China.  The lawyers filed an application 
to have the Garda (National Police) arrest Vice-Premier 
Huang on charges of complicity in torture under the 2000 
Criminal Justice Act, which incorporated the UN Convention 
on the Prevention of Torture into Irish law.  The 
application failed in the District Court, however, after 
Judge Cormac Dunne said that the case lacked evidence. 
Judge Dunne also said that he could not proceed without 
clarification of Vice-Premier Huang\'s possible diplomatic 
immunity. 
 
3.  (SBU) On November 17, Department of Foreign Affairs 
(DFA) EU correspondent, Gerald Keown, told emboff that 
Huang\'s visit was a follow-up to Premier Wen Jiabao\'s visit 
to Dublin last May and also to Prime Minister Ahern\'s 
discussions with Premier Wen at the October Asia-Europe 
Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi.  Huang\'s visit has set the stage 
for Prime Minister Ahern\'s planned January 2005 visit to 
Beijing.  Keown noted that trade, investment, culture, 
tourism, and human rights were among the issues discussed by 
Huang and his Irish interlocutors.  According to Keown, 
Huang made clear China\'s interest in the lifting of the EU 
arms embargo, and the Irish side explained that China\'s 
human rights record would make such a move difficult to 
justify to the Irish public.  (In conversations with 
Embassy, the Irish DFA has not explicitly opposed the 
lifting of the embargo, but has alluded to China\'s human 
rights violations as a significant factor in its 
considerations.)  Deliverables for Huang\'s visit included an 
agreement signed by Education Minister Mary Hanifan for 
college and university exchanges between Ireland and China.

SUBJECT: GOVERNMENT SPENDING PROJECIONS FOR 2005 RELEASED 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The annual Book of Estimates released 
by Finance Minister Brian Cowen on November 18 projects a 
6 percent increase in public spending over 2004 as part 
of its forecast for the 2005 government budget, to be 
published December 1.  Minister Cowen characterized the 
expenditure plans as \"cautious,\" noting that a spending 
spree could create inflationary pressures and damage 
Ireland\'s economic competitiveness.  The Estimates, 
however, include noteworthy spending increases for 
health, education, and disability services, which will 
support Fianna Fail\'s bid to refashion its image as a 
ruling party attuned to social concerns.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U) In a November 18 press conference, Finance 
Minster Brian Cowen presented the annual Book of 
Estimates, a summary of government expenditure plans 
foreshadowing the final 2005 government budget, to be 
published December 1.  Minister Cowen noted that a total 
of euro 43.6 billion in exchequer funds (or roughly 30 
percent of projected 2005 GDP) would be distributed among 
the various government departments.  The estimates are 
subject to revision in the actual budget, with some 
spending plans, such as social welfare increases, to be 
revealed only on December 1.  Minister Cowen said that 
his aim in framing the 2005 Estimates and budget was to 
ensure continued economic growth and employment, while 
generating resources for key social/public services and 
investment priorities.  He added that annual GDP growth 
in 2004 would be roughly 5 percent, but identified a 
number of risks that could prompt a slowdown in domestic 
economic activity, including oil prices, U.S. dollar 
movements, and a possible weakening of the U.S. economy. 
 
3.  (U) Minister Cowen announced a spending increase for 
2005 of nearly euro 2.5 billion over 2004, a 6 percent 
jump, which would bring total public spending to euro 
43.6 billion.  The main allocations are: 
 
- Euro 11 billion for health, an increase of euro 915 
million or 9 percent over 2004; 
 
- Euro 7.1 billion for education, an increase of euro 530 
million or 8 percent over 2004; 
 
- Euro 2.8 billion for disability services, an increase 
of euro 290 million or 11 percent over 2004; 
 
- Euro 445.7 million for the Department of Arts, Sports 
and Tourism; 
 
- Euro 60 million for official development assistance 
(ODA), an increase of 15 per cent over 2004, with 
promises of further increases in 2006 and 2007; 
 
- Euro 2.1 billion for the Department of Transport, an 
increase of 7 percent over 2004, to be allocated mainly 
to new roads, integrated ticketing on public transport, 
and a new train station in Dublin\'s docklands; 
 
- A 5 percent increase for the Department of Justice, 
Equality and Law Reform, with euro 55.6 million to be 
allocated to the Garda (National Police); 
 
- Euro 1 billion for the Department of Defense, earmarked 
for the upgrading of equipment and training in the Air 
Corps, Army, and Navy. 
 
4.  (U) Minister Cowen characterized the government\'s 
2005 expenditure plans as \"cautious\" and warned that a 
spending spree would overheat the economy, damaging 
Ireland\'s economic competitiveness.  \"We have come too 
far to expose ourselves to such a threat,\" he said.  The 
Estimates provide latitude for increases in the number of 
teachers and health staff, but the Minister cited his 
objective to reduce public service employees by 5,000, in 
line with previous GOI commitments. 
 
5.  (U) Following the publication of the Estimates, a 
number of Ministers held press briefings to outline their 
respective departments\' outlays, based on their expected 
2005 allocations.  Minister for Health and Children Mary 
Harney said that 230,000 additional people would become 
eligible for medical cards (the Irish equivalent of 
medicare) and that an extra 300 hospital beds would be 
provided to hospitals.  She announced 10 initiatives 
costing euro 70 million to relieve pressure on Accident 
and Emergency departments.  (A lack of funds and a 
shortage of hospital beds account for long patient queues 
at Irish hospital emergency wards, a hot-button social 
issue.)  She also announced an increase of euro 205 
million to be spent on services for people with 
disabilities, including the recruitment of roughly 1,000 
staff for disability care facilities.  The Minister for 
Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell said 
that a new criminal court complex would be built in 
Dublin and that 1,000 extra Gardai (National Police) 
would be recruited.  Minister for Education Mary Hanafin 
noted that key features of the additional euro 544 
million available to her department were: an additional 
euro 47 million to tackle education for the 
disadvantaged; an extra euro 67 million for special 
education; and a 35 percent increase in library grants. 
Almost half of the euro 544 million education allocation 
will go to salaries for teachers at the primary and 
secondary (high school) level. 
6.  (U) Opposition party members claimed that the 
Estimates marked the beginning of Fianna Fail\'s campaign 
for the 2007 general elections.  Richard Bruton, Fine 
Gael spokesperson on Finance, said the Estimates were 
\"big on talk but low on delivery,\" insofar as they 
focused on small changes in individual budgets instead of 
fundamental reform of the system.  Labour\'s Finance 
spokesperson, Joan Burton, claimed that the medical card 
initiative would burden an already dysfunctional health 
care system, and she criticized the failure to include 
new capital spending in the package. 
 
7.  (U) Emboff contacted Dr. Michael Casey, Assistant 
Director General, Central Bank of Ireland who noted that 
the rate of increase was similar to 2004 and the Book of 
Estimates was \"roughly what we expected\". 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment: The Book of Estimates presages a 2005 
government budget that will balance the imperative to 
avoid inflationary pressures with Fianna Fail\'s need to 
refashion its image as a party attuned to social 
concerns.  The Estimates are thus a natural follow-on to 
the September 29 Cabinet shuffle that was prompted by 
Fianna Fail\'s poor showing in local and European 
Parliament elections last June.  Noteworthy spending 
increases for health, education, and disability services 
are aimed to redress perceptions that the ruling party 
has created wealth during the Celtic Tiger era, but has 
overlooked social needs.  The significant jump in 
overseas development aid specifically targets criticism 
that the Government has fallen behind in its Millennium 
commitment to spend 0.7 percent of GNP on ODA (though 
with this increase, the target will still not be met). 
Given this context, Post and most economic commentators 
anticipate that the final 2005 budget will include 
additional spending increases for social welfare.

you may contact DS/DSS/ITA (Diplomatic Security\'s Office of 
Intelligence and Threat Assessment) in the State Department 
at 202-663-0787.  TDY visitors staying longer than 30 days 
should schedule a briefing with the Regional Security Officer. 
 
10.  Street Crime: Like any large urban center, Dublin has 
its share of street crime, especially pick-pocketing and 
purse-snatching.  Valuables should not be left unattended in 
cars and should be kept in hotel safe deposit boxes.  Do not 
carry large amounts of cash.  Violent confrontations and use 
of firearms are rare, however, and with reasonable 
precautions and common sense visitors should be able to enjoy 
a safe visit.  Police services are excellent; the number for 
emergency services in Ireland is 999 or 112. 
 
11.  Terrorism: Ireland, like the rest of the world, shares 
an increased threat of terrorist incidents of international 
origin.  Travelers should remain aware of their surroundings 
and report suspicious people or activities to the police or 
RSO.

FOR REASONS 1.4.(B) AND (D) 
 
 1. (C) On November 23, Emboff, drawing on reftel points, 
spoke to Niall Brady, the DFA\'s Deputy Director for 
Asia-Pacific Affairs.  Brady stated that while Ireland 
remains concerned about human rights and regional stability, 
it would not block EU consensus, either on a decision to lift 
the embargo or a decision to announce an intention to lift 
the embargo at the EU-China summit.  He said that the lifting 
of the embargo is inevitable, and only a matter of modalities 
and time. He predicted that the lift will be implemented 
sometime during or after the British EU presidency.  The 
embargo, he said, is \"anachronistic\" and has failed to stop 
human rights abuses or prevent China from exerting pressure 
on neighboring countries. Ireland wants to see demonstrations 
of improvements in China, he said, but the EU has not set 
specific conditions and are not likely to, as the EU does not 
want to alienate the Chinese Government by making outright 
demands.  He said the Chinese Government recognizes the 
importance of economic relations with the EU as well as the 
fact that it will have to meet some of the EU\'s concerns in 
order for positive relations to continue.  Brady added that 
Ireland does not have an arms trade with China. 
 
2. (C) In a later conversation with Embassy\'s POL/ECON chief, 
Cliona Manahan, DFA Director for Asia-Pacific affairs, said 
that the EU continues to grapple with the inconsistency of 
calling China a strategic partner while still keeping the 
embargo in place.  She said that the Chinese Vice Premier 
made that point strongly in his visit to Ireland, and that 
that argument resonates with EU governments.  She said that 
there is a feeling among the EU that there should be a 
natural progression in relations with China, a logical 
extension of which would be lifting the embargo.  The 
question, she said, is how and when.  She noted the 
importance of strengthening the Code of Conduct.  She also 
noted continuing opposition from parliaments and publics to 
lifting the embargo, and said that NGOs have told the GOI 
there is more that China can be pushed to do on human rights. 
 At this point, she said, it is not yet clear how the EU will 
handle the summit with China, or what further progress the EU 
might require of China. 
 
3. (C)  Comment:  The Irish \"bottom line\" has been consistent 
since July, namely that they will follow EU consensus. 
However, their emphasis has changed.  In October, they 
focused more on their concerns about lifting the embargo. 
They said then that EU governments increasingly understood 
and shared regional security concerns and also were affected 
by parliamentary opposition, based on human rights concerns, 
to lifting the embargo. This week, they have returned more to 
the theme that lifting the embargo is inevitable and it is up 
to others (largely the Dutch, as EU president) to help shape 
the \"how\" and \"when.\"  We suspect that the Chinese Vice 
Premier\'s visit this month affected the Irish, switching the 
balance of the argument to what Manahan referred to as the 
inconsistency of maintaining an embargo on a \"strategic 
partner\". Both Manahan and Brady referred to the pressures 
they have felt from China and \"third parties,\" including the 
U.S.

SUBJECT: SECRETARY SNOW,S MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER AHERN 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary: On November 15, U.S. Treasury Secretary John 
Snow met with Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern. 
PM Ahern: 
 
-- Urged U.S. reengagement in the Middle East Peace Process, 
which Europe viewed as the world,s most pressing issue; 
 
-- Expressed concern about the ability of the new Palestinian 
leadership to deal with Hamas; 
 
-- Noted that the Irish Government had &moved beyond Iraq8 
and recognized the necessity of U.S. actions in Falluja; and 
 
-- Cited Ireland,s sensitivity to dollar movements, given 
the importance of U.S. trade and investment to the Irish 
economy. 
 
2.  (C) Secretary Snow: 
 
-- Noted that President Bush would be active in Middle East 
peace efforts during his second term; 
 
-- Observed that Arafat,s passing presented opportunities 
for a new, more moderate Palestinian leadership to emerge; 
 
-- Cited President Bush,s intention to pursue broad-based 
tax reform and the reduction of the fiscal deficit, working 
closely with the Treasury Department; 
 
-- Explained that the U.S. trade deficit and pressures on the 
dollar had linkages to the yuan-dollar peg and to the 
sluggishness of euro-zone economic growth; and 
 
-- Said that the USG believed in a strong dollar and that the 
dollar,s value would continue to be set in open, competitive 
currency markets.  End summary. 
 
-------------------- 
The Middle East 
-------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Re-engagement in the Middle East Peace Process would 
be the most effective U.S. measure to strengthen the 
trans-Atlantic relationship, Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) 
Bertie Ahern told visiting Treasury Secretary John W. Snow on 
November 15.  According to Ahern, Europe viewed the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict as the world,s most pressing 
issue and would support President Bush,s efforts to 
re-energize U.S. leadership of the Quartet.  Ahern said that 
he shared the European public,s empathy for the 
Palestinians, which was shaped by media images of Israeli 
attacks against Palestinian neighborhoods and also by the 
EU,s growing Muslim population.  Secretary Snow responded 
that President Bush would be active in Middle East peace 
efforts in his second Administration.  The Secretary 
expressed regret that Europeans tended to regard the United 
States as one-sided in its support for Israel, despite U.S. 
efforts to act as an even-handed broker in the peace process. 
 He recalled that he had visited previously with Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders at President Bush,s request, only to 
find a &poisonous atmosphere8 that was not conducive to 
progress. 
 
4.  (C) Ahern and Secretary Snow concurred that Arafat,s 
passing presented an opportunity for a new, more moderate 
Palestinian leadership to emerge.  Secretary Snow observed 
that the first Bush Administration had been unable to work 
with Arafat, who had denied other Palestinian interlocutors, 
such as Mahmoud Abbas, the authority to move the peace 
process forward.  Ahern replied that President Bush made the 
same points to him and Prime Minister Tony Blair in 
discussions earlier this year.  Ahern expected that a group 
of leaders, whom he described as highly intelligent and 
business-savvy, would take up Arafat,s mantle collectively. 
The test of the new Palestinian leadership would be its 
approach to Hamas, which had planted strong roots in the 
Palestinian community while continuing to use violence. 
Ahern noted that the Middle East could find lessons in 
Northern Ireland, where inclusive dialogue over time had led 
paramilitary groups to see the value of political engagement 
over violence. 
 
----- 
Iraq 
----- 
 
5.  (C)  &Iraq is Iraq, and Ireland has moved on,8 Ahern 
told Secretary Snow.  Ahern said that he and most European 
leaders recognized the necessity of U.S. actions in Falluja, 
and he expressed regret for U.S. military deaths and 
casualties in that offensive.  He observed that the majority 
of EU Member States were pro-American, as demonstrated by 
accession states, contributions of personnel and assets to 
the Coalition.  He also noted that Iraqi interim Prime 
Minister Allawi had been impressive during his November 5 
discussions with EU Member State leaders in Brussels.  Ahern 
believed that the media had made too much of President 
Chirac,s absence from the gathering, and he noted that 
Foreign Minister Barnier had been very positive about 
prospects for EU-Iraq cooperation in his contribution to the 
discussions. 
 
-------------- 
Tax Reform 
-------------- 
6.  (C) President Bush intended to pursue broad-based tax 
reform and the reduction of the fiscal deficit in his second 
term, working closely with the Treasury Department, said 
Secretary Snow.  The Secretary noted that President Bush,s 
 
SIPDIS 
strong electoral mandate gave him political capital to reach 
across party lines to achieve these goals.  Halving the 
fiscal deficit would depend on a strong U.S. economy that 
could generate growth in government receipts, and, in fact, 
receipts were now growing at 7-8 percent per year.  Secretary 
Snow noted that the 1990s, government surplus derived from a 
jump in receipts from 18 percent to 21 percent of GDP, while 
a drop in receipts to 15 percent of GDP following the 2000-1 
recession largely accounted for the current deficit.  To 
shrink the deficit, he added, it would also be necessary to 
control government spending, though not at the expense of 
outlays for defense and homeland security.  The Secretary 
said that the Bush Administration would have to demonstrate 
its seriousness on spending controls to bond traders, who 
were jittery about the deficit with Republican control of the 
White House and Congress. 
 
7.  (C) Ahern acknowledged the challenges with tax reform in 
the United States, saying that tax cuts in a small country 
like Ireland had been difficult enough.  He commented that 
reductions in Ireland,s corporate tax rates from 40 percent 
to roughly 10 percent in the late 1980s generated so much 
economic activity and employment that government receipts 
increased.  When economic growth and receipts faltered in 
2001-2 with the global economic slowdown, Ireland was forced 
to ratchet back sharply on government expenditures.  Ahern 
said that the fiscal situation had recently returned to 
normal, with a year-on-year 9 percent rise in government 
spending in 2004.  He noted that Ireland,s uniform, 
transparent tax system created confidence among foreign 
multinationals, as opposed to systems in some countries that 
allowed for separate tax deals with individual foreign firms. 
 Financial regulation that was independent of government 
influence was another confidence-building measure, Ahern 
added. 
 
------------- 
The Dollar 
------------- 
 
8.  (C) The U.S. trade deficit and accompanying pressure on 
the dollar had linkages to the yuan-dollar peg and to the 
sluggishness of euro-zone economic growth, said Secretary 
Snow.  He cited continued dissatisfaction with the 
yuan-dollar peg among U.S. manufacturers, and he recounted 
Chinese commitments to pursue more exchange rate flexibility, 
though with no clear timetable.  A more flexible rate for the 
yuan, he observed, would help to reduce pressure on the 
dollar and euro and also ease inflationary stresses in China. 
 A pick-up in the German and French economies, said Secretary 
Snow, would spur growth and buying power within the EU, which 
would also benefit U.S. exporters and help to reduce the U.S. 
trade deficit.  Ahern remarked that Chancellor Schroeder had 
pursued reforms to Germany,s pension and welfare systems, 
although the results of these initiatives remained unclear 
for an economy still burdened by the costs of the One-for-One 
reunification policy.  He added that France was also trying 
to address its economic problems, which were proving more 
intractable than expected. 
 
9.  (C) Ahern asked about the dollar,s prospects, and 
Secretary Snow replied that the USG believed in a strong 
 
SIPDIS 
dollar and that the dollar,s value would continue to be set 
in open, competitive currency markets.  Ahern noted that 
Ireland was sensitive to developments with the dollar and the 
U.S. economy generally, given the importance that investment 
and exports by U.S.-owned firms held for the local economy. 
He remarked that 14 major U.S. pharmaceutical firms and 18 
top U.S. ICT firms had subsidiaries in Ireland; most major 
U.S. financial companies had also established offices in 
Dublin,s International Financial Services Center.  The 
employment opportunities that U.S.-owned firms had created 
were part of the reason that Ireland had reversed decades of 
net emigration from the country.  Secretary Snow responded 
that members of the American Chamber of Commerce whom he had 
met earlier on November 15 were bullish on Ireland because of 
the country,s openness, legal framework, common-sense 
approach to business, and strong educational system.

OF THE CELTIC TIGER ECONOMY 
 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

Secretary John W. Snow was an opportunity for discussion on 
 
SIPDIS 
the \"secrets\" of Ireland,s success with policy-makers and 
businessmen who were the architects of Ireland,s Celtic

that good-faith relations with labor, investment in 
education, and a \"dictatorial\" leadership that exposed 
industries to the full discipline of the market had been key 
to success.  Ireland,s skill in securing substantial EU 
support funds and in exploiting U.S. policy on corporate tax 
deferral was another important factor in Ireland,s economic 
turnaround.  Looking ahead, the policy-makers cited both the 
need to ensure Ireland,s continued competitiveness as a 
magnet for foreign direct investment and also the role of 
education in shaping Ireland as an innovation-based, 
higher-value economy.  Secretary Snow,s classroom discussion 
at Dublin City University (DCU) highlighted the role of 
higher education in promoting innovation and 
entrepreneurship.  End summary.

Introduction 
------------ 
 
2.  (U) The November 14-15 visit of U.S. Treasury Secretary 
John W. Snow was an opportunity for substantive discussion on 
the \"secrets\" of Ireland,s economic success.  During a 
dinner hosted by the Ambassador and a lunch arranged by the 
Ulster Bank, Secretary Snow spoke with 16 policy-makers and 
businessmen (listed in para 12) who were instrumental in the 
emergence of the Celtic Tiger economy.  A breakfast with the 
American Chamber of Commerce and a classroom exchange at 
Dublin City University (DCU) reinforced the points made by 
these key figures.  The following are the principal insights 
that emerged from Secretary Snow,s visit (which are 
organized thematically, not in the sequential order in which 
they were discussed). 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
In the Beginning: Political Will and Industrial Peace 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (C) Although the concepts behind Ireland,s reforms had 
been simple, the political will to carry out the reforms had 
only come in the context of the mid-1980s, economic 
meltdown, said Padraig O,hUiginn, former Secretary General 
in the Office of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister).  O,hUiginn 
recalled drafting a proposal for economic recovery during 
that era, using ideas that were \"apparent to any first-year 
economics graduate student\" ) cut the fiscal deficit, spur 
competition, lower corporate taxes, etc.  The ruling party at 
the time, Fine Gael, did not act on the proposal, but the 
Fianna Fail government elected in 1987 made the document the 
basis for the Program of National Recovery (PNR), which set 
forth the policies that underpinned Ireland,s economic 
turnaround.  Fianna Fail,s \"great advantage\" at the time, 
said O,hUiginn, was Ireland,s economic crisis; with 18 
percent unemployment and government debt at 130 percent of 
GDP, the political opposition, industry, and labor could not 
afford politically to impede solutions.  The PNR,s linchpin 
was labor,s decision to accept a moderate wage increases in 
exchange for income tax relief, which became the basic 
approach to successive national wage-setting (Social 
Partnership) agreements.  O,hUiginn recounted that the 
Government offered Irish pounds 700 million in tax relief in 
1987 and also cut the fiscal deficit, forcing the closure of 
several hospitals and the retrenchment of 16,000 civil 
servants.  He noted that the moderate wage increase 
incorporated in the PNR laid the foundation for Ireland,s 
competitiveness as an export platform and as a draw for 
foreign direct investment (FDI). 
 
4.  (C) The Government,s good-faith dealings with unions in 
negotiating Social Partnership agreements were, and remained, 
central to Ireland,s economic success, said Peter Cassells, 
former General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade 
Unions.  According to Cassells, a shared understanding 
between unions and the Government on the importance of decent 
wages and housing for workers was the basis of labor,s 
commitment to the Social Partnership approach.  He added that 
the transparency and inclusiveness of wage-setting 
negotiations, in which even the most disgruntled union 
representatives were given voice, were also instrumental to 
success.  The typical industrial relations model in which 
union chiefs and politicians hammered out back-room 
agreements, in the mode of Lyndon Johnson and Lane Kirkland, 
would not have secured labor buy-in to economic reforms, 
Cassells asserted.  He further observed that the Social 
Partnership approach might not be replicable in other EU 
Member States, which typically were more populous than 
Ireland and had more diffuse union structures. 
 
---------------------- 
The Key: Human Capital 
---------------------- 
 
5.  (C) The chief source of Ireland,s success has been its 
educated labor force, said EU Commissioner-designate and 
former Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy.  He noted 
that the introduction of free primary and secondary education 
in the 1960-70s initially benefited other countries as much 
as Ireland, due to the emigration of educated Irish workers. 
As a young parliamentarian, moreover, McCreevy had warned 
that the 1970s, baby boom was a looming disaster, on the 
pretext that Ireland,s small, weak economy could not 
accommodate a future surge in labor, even with emigration. 
As it turned out, this large pool of young, educated workers 
became Ireland,s principal resource and the main attraction 
for foreign multinationals to establish subsidiaries in the 
country.  Far from a disaster, the period 1987-2003 saw the 
addition of 600,000 jobs to the economy and drop in the 
unemployment rate from 18 percent to 4 percent.  This 
success, concluded McCreevy, was primarily attributable to 
Ireland,s investment in human capital. 
 
------------------------ 
\"Dictatorial\" Leadership 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (C) The implementation of reforms that underpinned 
Ireland,s economic recovery had required \"dictatorial\" 
leadership, said McCreevy.  This involved incenitivizing 
industries to achieve efficiencies by exposing them to the 
full discipline of the market, even at the risk of 
bankruptcies.  The challenge in this approach, explained 
McCreevy, was to press ahead with reforms in the face of 
elections, which provided temptations for politicians to 
adopt softer, more populist economic platforms.  Secretary 
Snow observed that whereas the gains from economic reforms in 
any country tended to be diffuse, the losses were often 
concentrated in particular sectors or geographic areas, 
making it easier for those affected to organize political 
opposition.  McCreevy commented that the test of any 
government was how well it explained to dislocated workers 
that the reforms responsible for their plight were good for 
the country.  Indecon Economic Consultants CEO Alan Gray 
separately pointed out that Ireland had succeeded, through 
education, in giving workers the skills to move across 
industries, to the point now where those laid off did not 
ask, \"Do I have any hope of a job?\" but rather \"Which one of 
my new employment choices should I take?\" 
 
------- 
EU Help 
------- 
 
7.  (C) EU tools, primarily structural support funds, were 
another factor in the emergence of Ireland,s Celtic Tiger 
economy, explained former Prime Minister (1992-95) Albert 
Reynolds and Ray McSharry, former EU Commissioner and Irish 
Finance Minister.  Reynolds said that the Irish Government 
did not shy from viewing such tools as entitlements, since 
Ireland, as an island nation, faced additional challenges 
trading within the European Community.  He and McSharry 
recalled that Ireland had negotiated well to maximize the 
level of EU support.  For example, Reynolds claimed that he 
had obtained over euro one billion from Brussels as a result 
of a discussion with Chancellor Kohl in which Reynolds agreed 
to support Germany,s push for rapid EU enlargement.  EU 
Commissioner-designate McCreevy separately echoed Reynolds, 
points, saying that French Finance Minister Sarkozy,s 
proposal to reduce EU support for new Member States that 
applied low corporate tax rates was shortsighted.  McCreevy 
said that any EU measures to increase growth in the new 
Member States would redound to the benefit of the entire EU. 
 
--------------------------- 
U.S. Policy on Tax Deferral 
--------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) The U.S. policy of tax deferral for foreign 
subsidiaries of American firms, combined with Ireland,s 12.5 
percent corporate tax rate, underpinned the large influx of 
U.S. investment to Ireland during the Celtic Tiger period, 
observed Padraic White, former CEO of Ireland,s Industrial 
Development Authority (IDA).  White recounted his numerous 
trips to the U.S. House of Representatives, Ways and Means 
Committee to defend tax deferral, and he argued that Senator 
Kerry,s plan to reverse tax deferral would have \"killed 
Ireland,\" had he been elected.  White believed that 
complaints by the U.S. public about the job outsourcing that 
accompanied U.S. investment flows were wrong-headed.  U.S. 
subsidiaries in Ireland, he argued, were the principle reason 
that the United States had penetrated the personal computer, 
software, and pharmaceutical markets in Europe.  He further 
observed that under-performing U.S. companies were typically 
those that had not attempted to expand overseas.  Secretary 
Snow concurred that U.S. companies that were outsourcing 
overseas were those creating the most jobs in the United 
States.  He highlighted, however, the political difficulty of 
explaining outsourcing to the U.S. public, recalling slogans 
during the recent election campaign that criticized \"Benedict 
Arnold CEOs.\" 
 
------------------------------------------ 
A Propitious Lack of Monetary Policy Tools 
------------------------------------------ 
 
9.  (C) An ironic feature of Ireland,s success has been the 
Government,s lack of monetary policy tools, remarked Cormack 
McCarthy, Chief Executive of the Ulster Bank.  One might 
think that a country that had performed so well in terms of 
exports and investment would have relied heavily on interest 
rate and exchange rate levers, said McCarthy.  As a euro-zone 
member, in fact, Ireland had ceded control of its monetary 
policy to the European Central Bank.  The positive result, 
said McCarthy, were low interest rates.  He believed that if 
Ireland had remained control of monetary policy, the 
Government would have been tempted to raise interest rates to 
slow rapid growth in the late 1990s.  Instead, the low rates 
set by the ECB had been a boon to Ireland,s private sector 
and had lent a sense of stability and consistency to the 
Irish market for foreign investors. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Looking Ahead: Competitiveness and Education 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) Looking ahead, the principal danger for Ireland is 
complacency, said Eoin O,Driscoll, Chairman of Forfas (the 
Government think-tank) and the Government-commissioned 
Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG).  Echoing the ESG,s recently 
published findings, O,Driscoll cited the need to ensure 
Ireland,s continued competitiveness as a magnet for foreign 
direct investment (FDI), which, he said, had driven the 
country,s economic transformation.  (U.S. and Irish 
businesspersons who attended the November 15 American Chamber 
of Commerce breakfast with Secretary Snow made similar 
points, noting that multinationals were increasingly 
attracted by low-cost manufacturing opportunities in China 
and India.)   O,Driscoll said that, just as industry and 
Government had collaborated in the 1990s to make Ireland a 
base for leading bio-pharmaceutical and IT companies, the 
country needed a new shared vision to go another rung higher 
in the production of innovative, high-value goods and 
services.  He note that this challenge would involve marrying 
innovation to better business practices, particularly in 
sales and marketing, and he praised the U.S. model of 
perfecting product designs in the market, as opposed to the 
European preference of the laboratory.  While Secretary Snow 
cautioned against government attempts to pick winners in the 
market, he ventured that the key to economic prosperity 
rested with countries like the United States that fostered a 
culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. 
 
11.  (U) Secretary Snow,s classroom discussion with 
students, professors, and administrators at Dublin City 
University (DCU) was a venue for further discussion on the 
role of innovation, entrepreneurship, and academia in 
strengthening the Irish economy.  The event took place at 
DCU,s \"Invent Center,\" which serves as a business incubator 
for student entrepreneurs and community start-up companies. 
Secretary Snow highlighted the centrality of education and 
 
SIPDIS 
intellectual capital to the modern, knowledge-based economy, 
and he explained that to embrace a market economy was to 
embrace ever-changing needs for new ideas and skills.  He 
also noted the difficulties that economists had encountered 
in finding ways to capture creativity, \"that spark,\" in 
modeling economic activity.  DCU president Ferdinand von 
Prondzynski commented that the university had encountered a 
similar challenge, but espoused the belief that 
entrepreneurship could be taught, in the same way as poetry, 
painting, and other modes of creativity.  Prondzynski also 
stressed that innovation meant little without business 
skills, and he cited DCU requirements for students to 
establish relationships Irish entrepreneurs who had both 
succeeded and failed in bringing new ideas to the market.

DECEMBER 1-3 VISIT TO IRELAND 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  A background paper follows, describing key 
political concerns. We would also note that the Northern 
Ireland peace process is at a critical juncture, and the 
final results of the process begun at Leeds Castle might be 
announced during your visit. 
 
-------------------- 
Political Background 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Ironically, the party that has led Ireland through 
most of the Celtic Tiger era, Fianna Fail, has seen a recent 
erosion in its political support.  In the June 2004 local and 
European Parliament elections, Fianna Fail lost a number of 
seats to opposition parties, led by Fine Gael and the upstart 
Sinn Fein.  Commentators attributed Fianna Fail\'s poor 
showing to the electorate\'s sense that not all segments of 
society have shared the benefits of the Celtic Tiger economy, 
as reflected in growing crime rates and other social 
problems.  In a bid to re-energize the party and government 
ahead of the 2007 general elections, Prime Minister 
(Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern re-shuffled his cabinet in late 
September.  The move presages an effort by Fianna Fail to 
recast its image as a party more attuned to social concerns. 
 
--------------------- 
The Government Budget 
--------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Estimates for the 2005 government budget, released 
on November 18, set forth Fianna Fail\'s economic priorities 
in its bid to rebuild political support.  Although a budget 
deficit was originally forecast for 2004, increased revenues 
tied to economic growth and one-off tax collections on 
off-shore bank accounts will yield a year-end budget surplus 
of 0.3 percent of GDP.  Some ruling party members have 
pressed new Finance Minister Brian Cowen to use this 
unexpected windfall to address hot-button social issues, 
including Ireland\'s dysfunctional health care system and 
outdated transportation infrastructure.  The Irish Central 
Bank and most economists, however, have cautioned against 
steep increases in government spending that could fuel 
inflation, particularly with robust GDP growth predicted for 
2005.  In recent public comments, Minister Cowen has 
indicated that the budget will offer tax relief for lower 
income groups, but will avoid inflationary pressures that 
could raise wage demands and erode Ireland\'s competitiveness. 
 On December 1, the national budget will be released, 
providing specific details in regards to program funding. 
 
-------------------------- 
Ireland-Militarily Neutral 
-------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Ireland is militarily neutral, and does not have 
troops in Iraq.  Ireland continues, however, to allow the US 
military to refuel at Shannon airport, and to support major 
peacekeeping operations in areas such as Kosovo, Afghanistan, 
Lebanon, and Liberia, where Ireland is the largest 
non-African contingency.  (Under Irish law, troops cannot be 
deployed without a \"triple-lock\": UN-authorized mission, 
Government/Cabinet-level decision, and vote of Parliament). 
The use of Shannon places great pressure on the government, 
and elements of the public see this use as a violation of 
neutrality.  During the Reverend Jesse Jackson\'s recent trip, 
the press quoted him as saying that the use of Shannon by US 
military aircraft puts Ireland \"in the line of fire\" from 
terrorist organizations.  Parliamentarians raised this with 
the Taoiseach on November 23. Parliamentarians regularly 
question the government on the number of flights allowed and 
on allegations that prisoners have traveled through Shannon 
en route to Guantanamo.   Shannon airport has not been used 
to transit enemy combatants to or from the detention center 
at Guantanamo, and it will not, without US consultations with 
the Irish government.  Also, on December 1, Irish courts will 
pass sentence on a protester convicted of damaging a US 
aircraft at Shannon. 
 
----------------------------- 
Northern Ireland Negotiations 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Negotiations on a final settlement for Northern 
Ireland continue to be a hot topic.  Parties are reviewing a 
joint proposal from the Irish and UK governments that would 
restore Northern political institutions over the coming 
months.  This proposal builds upon progress that was achieved 
in the September Leeds Castle talks, where Sinn Fein signaled 
the IRA\'s willingness to cease paramilitary activity and 
decommission weapons as part of a final deal.  Northern 
Ireland is the fastest growing region in the UK, and a 
political settlement would help to accelerate growing 
inter-Ireland trade and investment. 
----------------------------- 
Ireland and the War on Terror 
----------------------------- 
6.  (SBU) The US embassy and Ireland enjoy a good working 
relationship and information sharing in the ongoing war on 
terror.  On November 23, the Taoiseach announced that the 
Irish national police are monitoring Al-Qaeda operatives in 
Ireland and one Irish citizen has been designated as a 
terrorism financier by the US authorities.  Without UN 
designation, currently there is little the Irish government 
can do in terms of prosecuting suspects of terrorism 
financing because legislation to criminalize international 
terrorism has been hung up in the Irish Parliament for over 
two years.  Ireland is party to five of the twelve UN 
Conventions Against Terrorism, but human rights and privacy 
concerns have stalled movement on legislation to allow 
Ireland to become party to the remaining seven.  This 
legislation is being discussed currently, and is expected to 
pass before the year\'s end. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Ireland -- A Confident EU Member State 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Ireland\'s economic and diplomatic successes have 
boosted the country\'s standing in the EU and have given Irish 
citizens unprecedented national confidence.  In less than a 
generation, Ireland has grown from one of the poorest EU 
Member States to one of the richest (in GDP per capita), 
largely on the strength of government policies that espoused 
open trade and investment, low corporate taxes, good labor 
relations, low government debt, and prudent use of EU support 
funds.  Although the Celtic Tiger stumbled somewhat with the 
post-9/11 global slowdown, a surge in housing construction 
has Ireland on track to achieve roughly 5% annual GDP growth 
in 2004, the highest in the EU.  Moreover, Ireland won high 
marks in Europe for its recent EU presidency, which saw the 
accession of ten new EU member states, the successful 
negotiation of the EU Constitutional Treaty, and the launch 
of the U.S.-EU Trans-Atlantic Economic Partnership.  These 
accomplishments have contributed to Ireland\'s self-image as 
an effective broker within the EU and a role model for new EU 
Member States. 
 
------------------- 
Links with the U.S. 
------------------- 
 
8.   (SBU) While Ireland is a player in the EU and continues 
to benefit from EU markets and support funds, Irish leaders 
attach equal importance to relations with the United States. 
Beyond long-standing cultural ties, U.S. trade and investment 
have been the twin engines of the Celtic Tiger economy. 
There are roughly 570 U.S. firms operating in Ireland, 
employing over 90,000 people and accounting for a third of 
Ireland\'s annual exports.  These firms include most major 
biotechnology, IT, and financial services companies, which 
use Ireland as a gateway to EU markets.  Last year, new U.S. 
investment in Ireland reached $9 billion, compared with $3.8 
billion in China.  The central role that U.S. businesses have 
played in Ireland\'s economic transformation, however, is a 
story not often told by the Irish media, which tend to take a 
negative view of the United States, particularly our efforts 
in Iraq.

1. (C) On November 24, Emboff discussed reftel with Margaret 
Stanley, Desk Officer on the Americas Desk at the DFA. 
According to Stanley, the GOI has taken no specific actions 
to advance democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms 
in Cuba in the last six months.  Ireland is credited to Cuba 
via its mission in Mexico City and has no diplomats in Cuba. 
Therefore, Ireland has few bilateral dealings with the Cuban 
Government and tends to follow EU concensus on Cuba.  The GOI 
supported previously, and is likely to support again, the 
suspension of the right to bring actions, under Title III of 
the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act, 
per reftel. 
 
2. (C) Ireland is not a significant trading partner with 
Cuba.  In terms of trade, in 2003, Ireland only exported 
goods worth euro 521,000 to Cuba, consisting mainly of cork 
and wood products, beverages, cereal and cereal preparations. 
 Ireland imported goods worth just euro 1,265,000, mainly 
vegetables, fruit, tobacco and tobacco products.  There are 
no known major Irish investments in Cuba. 
 
3. (C)  Note:  On November 24, an Irish Parliamentarian asked 
about the Government\'s attitude regarding the U.S. trade 
blockade with Cuba.  The Government responded by saying, \"The 
Government, in common with our partners in the European 
Union, believes that the U.S. economic embargo of Cuba 
seriously hampers the economic development of Cuba and 
negatively affects all of its people.  We reject unilateral 
measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted 
rules of international trade.  On 28 October 2004 in the 
United Nations General Assembly, Ireland and our EU partners 
again voted in favour of the annual Cuban-tabled resolution 
entitled the \'Necessity of ending the economic, commercial 
and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America 
against Cuba.\'\"  End Note.

Feeney said Ireland expected that the December 17 EU Council 
decision on Croatia would be consistent with the conclusion 
reached in the Council\'s June meeting, which recommended 
starting negotiations on Croatia\'s EU candidacy in 2005. 
Ireland did not anticipate that the Council would revisit the 
June decision in a way that would make the arrest of Ante 
Gotovina a condition for commencing negotiations.  Feeney 
cited the Irish Government\'s opinion that Croatia had made 
good progress in fulfilling its commitments under the 
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 
(ICTY), notwithstanding the failure to locate Gotovina.  She 
commented that accession negotiations would be the best way 
to ensure continued Croatian cooperation on its ICTY pledges, 
which would be central to the negotiating framework.  Feeney 
stressed that there would be no question of Croatia reneging 
on its ICTY commitments once accession negotiations had 
begun.  She also observed that it would be odd for the EU 
Council to take an unconditional decision on Turkey\'s 
candidacy negotiations while placing conditionalities on 
Croatia.

SUBJECT: SHANNON:  GOI UNDER PRESSURE BUT NO CHANGE IN 
POLICY 
 
Classified By: DCM JONATHAN BENTON FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
1. (S)  DCM met with Keith McBean, DFA\'s Chief of 
International Security Policy.  McBean\'s office has the lead 
in the Irish government for issues surrounding U.S. use of 
Shannon airport.  McBean noted that while there always has 
been an element of Irish society that objects to the U.S. 
military\'s use of Shannon, the government feels increasingly 
under pressure.  On a weekly basis, members of parliament 
question the ministers.  While most of the criticism and 
pressure come from the opposition, the president of the 
Senate, from the PM\'s own party, also has entered the fray 
periodically.  Parliamentarians draw on allegations from 
journalists, activists\' web sites and tail spotters to 
suggest the USG has used Shannon for nefarious purposes. 
Particularly difficult have been questions in the last two 
weeks about a Gulfstream jet that allegedly has been used to 
transport prisoners and allegedly had its tail number 
changed.  McBean cited this allegation as both politically 
and legally difficult for the GOI. The political problem is 
that the government\'s defense of Shannon rests heavily on 
friendship with the U.S. and the Irish government saying it 
relies on the \"good faith\" of the USG.  He said the 
allegations that the tail number has been changed raise 
suspicions and caused confusion within the GOI, along with 
the hope that there is a \"benign\" explanation about why the 
tail number was changed.  He cautioned that if it were ever 
to be discovered that the U.S. was not good on its word or 
had transported prisoners through Shannon in the context of 
the war on terrorism, there would be enormous political 
pressure on the government.  As for the legal issue, he said 
that were a plane to include Shannon in an itinerary that 
also included transporting prisoners, GOI lawyers might be 
forced to conclude that the GOI itself was in violation of 
torture conventions.  His colleague cited breaking press 
reports of ICRC comments about Guantanamo as adding fuel to 
the fire. 
 
2. (S)  The DCM told McBean that the USG would be in no 
position to respond to the detailed questions asked about 
particular planes, such as the Gulfstream jet, but stood by 
its commitment to abide by Irish law, consult with the Irish 
and avoid actions that would bring embarrassment to the Irish 
government.  McBean confirmed that there is no/no change 
pending to Irish policy allowing U.S. use of Shannon, but 
reiterated that some ministers feel they are going out on a 
limb defending U.S. use of Shannon and that the GOI is 
counting on the fact that the word of the USG is good and 
that the U.S. has not and will not transfer prisoners through 
Shannon or engage in any other activity that would place the 
government in legal or political difficulty.  He said that 
the government consistently says the same thing and that this 
must not be shown later \"to have holes in it.\"  He also said 
it is critical that no \"blue water\" be found between 
statements that Irish and U.S. officials make.  He said 
activists dissect statements and take any divergence as a 
sign that something is amiss.  He said the recent assurances 
from the USG that prisoners had not been transferred through 
Shannon was helpful, as is, in general terms, the UNSCR 
resolution asking members to support Iraq.

1.  Mary Kelly, who was convicted on October 28 of causing 
$1.5 million of damage to a US military aircraft, was given a 
two-year suspended sentence by Judge Carroll Moran at 
Limerick Circuit Court.  Kelly was spared a custodial 
sentence and given four years probation on the condition that 
she commits no repeat action and does not come within a 
one-mile radius of Shannon airport.  Judge Carroll Moran said 
he had a duty to prevent this act from happening again but 
indicated that in giving her a suspended sentence, he had to 
take into account that this was her first conviction and she 
was a \"woman of good character.\"  Sources in government say 
her conviction establishes the principal of wrong doing.  The 
case of the Catholic Workers group, who damaged the same 
plane several days after Mary Kelly did, will be heard early 
in 2005.  The issue of compensation to the USG for losses 
will not be addressed until the court case is over. 
 
2.  The sentencing was adjourned a number of times at the 
request of Kelly to consult a new legal team and to prepare 
for a plea of mitigation. 
 
3.  Kelly contended throughout the trial that she had \"lawful 
excuse\" for the criminal damage to the aircraft, as her 
actions were intended to save lives in Iraq.  However, Judge 
Moran said during the trial that this was not a case to 
\"consider the legality of the war in Iraq\" and that Kelly\'s 
act was \"simple vigilantism\". 
 
4.  The Irish Times reported that the Irish Anti-War Movement 
(IAWM) said Kelly\'s treatment was an example of \"gross

deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians who are dead 
as a result of Bush\'s war.\" Richard Boyd Barrett, chairman of

state has set out to criminalize Mary Kelly, who hurt nobody 
and did nothing more than act to try and save human lives.\"

SUBJECT: IRELAND\'S 2005 GOVERNMENT BUDGET 
 
REF: Dublin 1704 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Tax relief and social welfare spending 
increases are the marquis features of the 2005 Irish 
Government Budget, a reflection of the Government\'s newly 
embraced \"caring\" image.  The Budget provides for a 9 
percent increase in government spending over 2004, 
slightly above the increase projected in the November 18 
Budget Estimates.  Tax relief will take minimum-wage 
earners out of the tax net and will widen income tax 
bands to allow more workers to pay tax at the 20 percent 
rather than 45 percent rate.  Regarding social welfare, 
the Government will increase pension, unemployment, and 
child support payments and launch a multi-year funding 
program for the disabled.  Opposition political parties 
characterized the Budget as a populist attempt to undo 
the social \"damage\" done by former Finance Minister 
Charlie McCreevy.  A propitious economic environment will 
position Cowen in subsequent budgets to strengthen the 
Government\'s \"caring\" image as well as his own 
credentials to succeed Prime Minister Ahern as party 
leader over the longer term.  End summary. 
 
-------- 
Overview 
-------- 
 
2.  (U) On December 1, Finance Minister Brian Cowen 
presented to Parliament a Government Budget for 2005 that 
most prominently featured tax relief and social welfare 
spending increases.  The Budget provides for nearly euro 
45 billion in public spending, euro 3.7 billion (9 
percent) more than 2004.  This increase is above the 6-7 
percent spending jump forecast by Cowen in the November 
18 Budget Estimates (reftel).  Budgetary targets for 2005 
include: a government deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP: an 
exchequer borrowing requirement of just under euro 3 
billion, or 2 percent of GDP; and, a debt ratio of 30 
percent of GDP.  Cowen, who was appointed Minister in 
September, noted that the 2005 Budget would be his first 
installment in a three-year effort to strengthen public 
services (ahead of the 2007 general elections).  He also 
said that budgetary measures on tax relief and social 
welfare \"gave the lie to those who claim that this 
Government is indifferent to the needs of some of the 
most vulnerable members of our society\" (a response to 
criticism that the ruling Fianna Fail party\'s uncaring 
attitude toward social issues accounted for its poor 
showing in local and European Parliament elections last 
June). 
 
-------------- 
Social Welfare 
-------------- 
 
3.  (U) The first pillar of the 2005 budget is a record 
euro 12.3 billon package for social welfare.  Cowen had 
announced a euro 300 million increase for social welfare 
in the November 18 Budget Estimates, and he added another 
euro 874 million to the final welfare package, for a 
total increase of euro 1.1 billion, or 8 percent, over 
2004.  Social and Family Affairs Minister Seamus Brennan 
said that funding increases would benefit 970,000 people, 
a quarter of the population, who claim regular social 
welfare payments.  Key components of the package are: a 
euro 12 per week increase in state pensions; a euro 14 
per week jump in unemployment and non-pension welfare 
benefits; and, a monthly euro 10-12 per child increase in 
child benefits.  The 2005 budget also includes increased 
funding for maternity benefits, non-child-related family 
income supplements, and respite care grants.  The total 
welfare package reverses roughly half of the social 
spending cuts introduced in the 2004 Budget. 
 
4.  (U) A centerpiece of the budget\'s social agenda is a 
euro 900 million package for disability services covering 
2006-2009 -- the first time that the Government has taken 
a multi-year approach to the sector.  The package comes 
in addition to a euro 2.8 billon planned expenditure on 
disability for 2005, an increase of euro 290 million, or 
11 percent, over 2004.  Total funding over the next four 
years will: provide more than 4,500 respite centers for 
the disabled; transfer roughly 600 people with mental 
disabilities out of psychiatric hospitals; establish 400 
community-based mental health facilities; and, provide 
1.2 million extra hours of home support and personal 
assistance.  Cowen noted that disability services had 
previously \"been at the end of the queue\" for government 
resources, but would feature prominently in future budget 
allocations.  Disability support groups welcomed the 
funding increases, but warned that the Disability Bill, 
published in October, could undermine the budget package 
in restricting the definition of \"disabled\" and failing 
to provide rights to disability services. 
 
---------- 
Tax Relief 
---------- 
 
5.  (U) The second pillar of the 2005 Budget is broad- 
based tax relief, estimated to cost euro 682 million. 
The central components of this pillar are: 
 
a) Personal Taxation: The standard rate tax band (with a 
personal tax rate of 20 percent) was increased by euro 
1,400 for a single person to euro 29,400 and by euro 
2,800 to euro 58,800 for a dual-income married couple. 
This widening of the standard rate tax band, the first in 
three years, means that over 52,000 workers will no 
longer have to pay tax at the higher 42 percent rate. 
(Modest wage inflation, however, could push many of these 
back into the higher tax band in the coming years.)  In 
addition, those earning the minimum wage, euro 7 per 
hour, will fall outside the tax net. 
b) Stamp Duty: The threshold at which stamp duty is 
charged to first-time buyers of second-hand houses was 
increased from euro 190,500 to euro 317,500.  Second-hand 
homes sold for between euro 317,501 and euro 381,000 will 
have stamp duty charged at 3 percent (down from 4.5 
percent), and a 6 percent rate will apply to houses sold 
for between euro 381,001 and euro 635,000 (down from 7.5 
percent).  (This form of tax relief targets young urban 
professionals who have had difficulty in recent years 
affording a first home.) 
 
c) Excise Duty: No changes were made to the main VAT 
(Value Added Tax) and excise rates in the 2005 Budget. 
Minister Cowen said he decided against excise duty 
increases on cigarettes because of hardships that the new 
smoking ban in enclosed public places had imposed on 
smokers (cigarettes sales fell by 17.6 percent in the 
first 10 months of 2004, and tobacco excise collections 
will be euro 128 million below forecast).  Cowen also 
argued that an increase in duties for cigarettes and 
alcohol would have created inflationary pressures. 
 
6.  (U) Responding to public complaints that more than 40 
Irish citizens with incomes over euro 500,000 legally 
avoided taxes in 2004, Minister Cowen announced that he 
would initiate a comprehensive reform of tax incentive 
schemes.  He has instructed the Department of Finance, in 
conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to evaluate 
the effect of incentive reliefs and exemptions, with the 
aim of improving tax system equity. 
 
-------------------- 
Capital Expenditures 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (U) The Government will spend euro 36.3 billion on 
improving the State\'s infrastructure in the period 2005 - 
2009, a proportion of GDP that is nearly twice the EU 
average.  Euro 6.3 billion in Exchequer capital will be 
made available in 2005, including euro 237 million 
carried over by Government Departments from 2004. 
Roughly euro 10.2 billion (28 percent) of the 2005-2009 
capital envelope will be invested in transport 
infrastructure, which the Government regards as key to 
economic competitiveness and balanced regional 
development.  In his Parliament speech, Cowen stated that 
he was \"extremely conscious of the need to optimize the 
value for money from the very significant levels of 
capital funding now in place\" (a response to criticism 
that capital spending in recent years had not yielded 
appreciable infrastructure upgrades). 
 
----------------------------- 
Defense, Foreign Affairs, ODA 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  (U) The 2005 Budget provides roughly euro 758 million 
for the Irish Department of Defense, or 1.7 of total 
government spending.  The Department of Foreign Affairs 
will receive euro 197 million.  The Budget will allocate 
euro 60 million for Official Development Assistance 
(ODA), a 15 percent increase over 2004.  ODA funds will 
come out of the euro 535 million set aside for 
International Cooperation, a distinct basket from Foreign 
Affairs.  The Irish Government has also committed to 
minimum funding of euro 65 million for ODA in both 2006 
and 2007.  (With a euro 60 million outlay in 2005, ODA 
will reach 0.4 percent of GNP, in contrast to the 
Government\'s Millennium commitment to bring ODA to 0.7 of 
GNP by 2005.  This shortfall has prompted criticism from 
Ireland\'s international charitable organizations.) 
 
--------- 
Reactions 
--------- 
 
9.  (U) Opposition political parties characterized the 
Budget as an attempt to repair the social \"damage\" done 
by Former Finance Minister and EU Commissioner-designate 
Charlie McCreevy.  (This view holds that McCreevy 
emphasized wealth-creation to the neglect of social 
spending.)  Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, Richard 
Bruton, described the Budget as \"pretending to say sorry\" 
and \"designed to bury the McCreevy image.\"  While he 
conceded that income tax would fall for most people in 
2005, he stressed that this would not make up for 
increases in the cost of living in recent years.  Joan 
Burton, Labour\'s Finance spokesperson, called the budget 
a \"populist\" rather than \"visionary\" document, \"full of 
half-measures.\"  In a reference to Fianna Fail\'s 2002 
election slogan of \"a lot done, a lot more to do,\" she 
described the Budget as \"some damage undone, a lot more 
to do\".  Echoing these sentiments, Dan Boyle, the Green 
party spokesperson on Finance, said it would take half a 
dozen such budgets \"before you would even begin to repair 
the damage the last seven budgets have done\". 
 
10.  (U) Prominent businesses and social organizations 
were generally positive, though cautious, in their 
reactions to the Budget.  Most Irish firms interviewed by 
the press welcomed the Budget\'s tax cuts and welfare 
increases as stimuli for consumer spending, which has 
flagged in recent years.  Indigenous Irish software firms 
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, expressed 
disappointment that the Budget did not target Ireland\'s 
competitiveness by providing incentives for scientific 
research and development.  Social organizations generally 
praised budgetary measures to help the disadvantaged and 
disabled, though some criticized the Budget as not going 
far enough.  The Children\'s Rights Alliance said that 
child benefit increases would not reduce the number of 
children living in poverty.  The National Women\'s Council 
and labor unions also faulted the Budget for failing to 
alleviate high daycare costs for children. 
 
-------------------- 
Comment: Santa Cowen 
-------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) Comment: In the spirit of the season, Irish 
newspapers have run political cartoons of Cowen dressed 
as Santa Claus, doling out tax breaks and welfare checks 
to a disaffected electorate.  The cartoons emphasize the 
point noted in reftel that the 2005 Budget was framed to 
target popular perceptions of ruling Fianna Fail party\'s 
indifference to social concerns.  Cowen was fortunate 
insofar as a euro 2.3 billion overshoot in 2004 tax 
revenues made possible large giveaways in social welfare 
spending for 2005, without pushing the projected fiscal 
deficit close to the EU Growth and Stability Pact ceiling 
of 3 percent of GDP.  Cowen also stands to benefit from 
Ireland\'s most propitious macro-economic environment in 4 
years, with GDP growth of at least 5 percent predicted 
through 2006 and an inflation rate that, after many 
years, has converged toward the 2 percent eurozone 
average.  The Finance Minister is thus positioned to 
strengthen the Government\'s \"social\" credentials further 
in the two budgets that remain before the 2007 general 
elections.  Those budgets will likely extend benefits 
beyond the disadvantaged to more of the middle class, 
with possible child daycare subsidies and additional tax 
relief for dual-income families.  Ireland\'s positive 
budgetary and macro-economic outlook will also improve 
Cowen\'s own credentials as the reported favorite 
candidate to succeed Prime Minister Ahern as Fianna Fail 
leader over the longer term.

On December 1, Emboff delivered reftel points to UN Desk 
Officer for International Terrorism and Drugs at the DFA, 
Eoin Duggan.  Duggan said that Ireland and its EU partners 
fully support the uncompromising stance of the Afghan 
authorities on cultivation and trafficking in illicit drugs 
and the counternarcotics implementation plan (reftel). 
Duggan stated that the GOI is very concerned about the 
cultivation of opium products in Afghanistan, especially 
because almost all heroin consumed in Ireland comes from 
Afghanistan.  Duggan stated that Irish concern for 
Afghanistan is also evident in the high number of Irish 
officers deployed to ISAF (seven).  Over the past three 
years, the GOI contributed euro 500,000 per annum to the UN 
Office of Drugs and Crimes (ODC).  Of that amount, euro 
300,000 went to counternarcotics projects in South Asia. 
Duggan anticipates that GOI contributions will remain the 
same and will continue to be channeled through multilateral 
efforts.

REF: DUBLIN 1739 
 
Classified By: AMB JAMES KENNY FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary.  During a meeting with the Ambassador and 
Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, the Irish Prime 
Minister raised his concerns about two separate issues:  the 
U.S. military\'s use of Shannon and the immigration bill 
pending in Congress. He also updated the Senators on the 
Northern Ireland Peace Process and discussed transatlantic 
relations.  End Summary 
 
A Warning on Shannon 
-------------------- 
2. (S) PM Ahern asked the Ambassador to confirm that the U.S. 
has not and will not transport prisoners through Shannon 
airport.  Echoing comments we had heard from DFA earlier in 
the week (reftel), the prime minister said that while there 
are no plans to alter arrangements with the U.S. at Shannon, 
the subject is \"beginning to worry people.\"  He referenced 
his government\'s repeated defense of the U.S. military\'s use 
of Shannon to parliament, in which he and other ministers 
have referred to U.S. assurances that enemy combatants have 
not transited Shannon enroute to Guantanamo or elsewhere and 
will not without consultation.  \"Am I all right on this?\" he 
asked the ambassador.  Following the meeting, Sen McCain told 
the ambassador he plans to raise Shannon with the 
Administration when he returns to Washington and will 
underscore how very important it is that the U.S. not ever be 
caught in a lie to a close friend and ally. 
 
Immigration Bill - Concerns about Irish \"overstays\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
3. (SBU) The Prime Minister raised the issue of Irish 
citizens who had overstayed their visas in the U.S. and asked 
for an amnesty for them.  He indicated that the Irish 
government is following legislation in Congress closely and 
would like Irish \"overstays\" to get a second chance.  Sen 
McCain recognized his concern and explained some of his own 
goals with regard to the legislation.  Comment:  The prospect 
of Irish overstays being deported from the U.S. is a major 
concern with the Irish government and public.  It garners 
much press attention, and adds to disgruntlement over 
fingerprinting.  End Comment 
 
Transatlantic Relations, Iraq, MEPP and Ukraine 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4. (C) Responding to questions from Senator McCain, the Prime 
Minister said that the U.S. could solve its problems in 
Europe by putting attention into the Middle East peace 
process.  PM Ahern said that Iraq must be a success and that 
all must help make that happen.  Politicians, the prime 
minister said, were \"getting over\" their disagreement with 
the U.S., but the public has not, yet, especially as regards 
Guantanamo and Abu Graib.  McCain raised the issue of 
Ukraine.  Ahern referred to Russian President Putin as a 
\"slippery character.\"  He talked about the gala Putin had put 
on for the EU at the celebration of St. Petersburg\'s 400th 
anniversary but said there had been absolutely no Russian 
follow through on promises made then with the EU.  \"All show 
and no action\" is how he described Putin\'s approach to the EU. 
 
Sen. McCain Gets Standing Ovation 
--------------------------------- 
5.  (U) Senator McCain came to Ireland to deliver a speech to 
Trinity College on re-building transatlantic ties.  He 
received a standing ovation from the crowd of 400, and 
favorable press coverage. His reference to Putin as an 
autocrat meddling in Eastern Europe drew headlines, but the 
thrust of his message was this, \"When the United States and 
the countries of Europe stand together, it creates a moral 
and political force that gives no ground to the enemies of 
freedom.  The world needs us together and we need each 
other.\"

1.  On December 9, post delivered reftels\' talking points to 
Tony Joyce, Senior Trade Negotiator in the Department of 
Enterprise, Trade, and Employment (DETE).  Joyce noted the 
GOI\'s view that it had been reasonable for the Commission to 
seek WTO confirmation that the FSC/ETI repeal included in the 
American Jobs Creation Act was WTO-compliant.  He added that 
the GOI was \"unhappy\" with the Commission\'s proposal to 
reinstate sanctions automatically in the event that the WTO 
panel did not find full compliance.  Ireland would have 
preferred the suspension of sanctions, with the option of 
revisiting the sanctions option if the WTO panel did not find 
compliance.  Joyce noted that the GOI had voiced this 
position in discussions that followed the Commission\'s 
briefing to Member States this past week in Brussels 
regarding the draft Council regulation on the FSC/ETI issue. 
He said that Ireland was aware of the U.S. Congress\' 
sensitivities to the Commission\'s approach, but was waiting 
to see the position that a majority of Member States would 
take on the draft regulation.  Joyce added that the 
Commission had valued the grandfathering benefits included in 
the FSC/ETI repeal \"conspicuously\" above the USD 75 million 
per year cited in ref B, though he could not recall the 
Commission\'s exact estimate.

1.  (U) On December 9, Post delivered reftel talking points 
to Gerard Keown, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) EU 
Correspondent. 
 
------- 
Ukraine 
------- 
 
2.  (C) The common line taken by the EU and United States 
regarding the Ukrainian crisis had been immensely 
constructive, said Keown.  He noted that the EU welcomed the 
December 8 agreements reached in Kiev on restructuring the 
Central Election Commission and replacing Prosecutor General 
Vasiliyev, which had been key OSCE recommendations.  (The 
demarche took place before news reports about apparent 
backtracking on the agreements by the Ukrainian Government.) 
He cited the EU\'s hope that all sides would continue to show 
restraint and that the outcome of the December 26 rerun 
elections would reflect the will of the Ukrainian people. 
(Keown will be one of several Irish DFA officials serving as 
election monitors on December 26.) 
 
--------------- 
The Middle East 
--------------- 
 
3.  (C) The EU fully concurred with USG talking points on the 
Middle East, said Keown.  He noted that the EU had provided a 
technical assistance package for the January 9 Palestinian 
elections and would send an observer mission.  The EU also 
had in place a financial assistance package for the 
Palestinian Authority targeting governance reforms, 
infrastructure, and security.  Keown cited the EU view that 
the Palestinian elections would require the widest possible 
participation, and he commended recent Israeli commitments to 
Secretary Powell to examine possibilities for freedom of 
 
SIPDIS 
movement by Palestinian voters.  Keown added that the EU 
appreciated the positive influence that that USG was 
exercising on the Israeli Government and hoped that Prime 
Minister Sharon would view the Palestinians elected as 
legitimate interlocutors.  The Irish Government, added Keown, 
believed that the emergence of the new Palestinian leadership 
would present an opportunity for closer U.S.-EU cooperation 
on the peace process. 
 
-------- 
Colombia 
-------- 
 
4.  (C) Keown said that the EU agreed with the USG on the 
importance of strengthening support for the Colombian 
Government.  The EU also welcomed U.S. proposals for 
increased cooperation through the G-24 mechanism. 
 
--------------- 
The Great Lakes 
--------------- 
 
5.  (C) The EU supported the November 20 Dar es Salaam 
Declaration on the framework for resolving tensions in the 
Great Lakes region, said Keown.  He noted that the December 
13 GAERC would adopt a statement urging restraint on all 
parties in the interests of regional stability.  Keown 
highlighted the EU\'s concern that Rwanda might take 
unilateral action damaging the peace framework, as suggested 
in recent Rwandan Government statements that reserved 
Rwanda\'s right to defend itself against cross-border attacks. 
 
------------------- 
The Code of Conduct 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Keown observed that the Code of Conduct was still a 
\"work in progress\" and would not be ready for discussion at 
the December 13 GAERC.  He also pointed out that the EU-China 
Summit statement had been careful not to draw explicit 
connections between progress on human rights and steps to 
lift the arms embargo.  The EU, said Keown, viewed its 
ongoing, structured human rights dialogue with China as the 
most appropriate avenue to press the Chinese Government on 
human rights concerns. 
 
------- 
Croatia 
------- 
 
7.  (C) Ireland generally opposed placing conditions, 
specifically the apprehension of Ante Gotovina, on the start 
of Croatia\' accession negotiations, commented Keown.  The 
Irish Government believed that negotiations offered the best 
context in which to encourage Croatia to fulfill its 
commitments to the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), including Gotovina\'s capture and 
delivery to The Hague.  Keown added that the negotiations 
would include safeguard measures to prevent possible Croatian 
backsliding on those commitments.  He pointed out the Irish 
Government\'s view that Chief Prosecutor del Ponte had sent 
confusing signals this past year on the extent of Croatia\'s 
cooperation with the ICTY.  He added that the Irish 
Government looked forward to a full hearing at the December 
17 EU Council meeting for those Member States that supported 
conditionalities on the commencement of Croatia\'s accession 
negotiations.  Keown emphasized that Ireland saw no linkage 
between Turkey and Croatia.  (This position on linkage 
contrasted somewhat with DFA comments in ref B that it would 
be unusual to place conditions on Croatia while taking an 
unconditional decision on Turkey\'s accession negotiations.) 
 
8.  (C) On December 10, Post spoke with Michael Gaffey, DFA 
Counsellor for Southeastern Europe.  Gaffey said the Irish 
intended to maintain a position that was consistent with the 
June Council decision, which, he believed, had \"clearly\" 
called for the start of negotiations with Croatia.  Ireland 
was willing to reiterate that position at the December 13 
GAERC, but did not see itself as a champion for Croatia, 
certainly not to the extent that Germany or Austria might be. 
 Gaffey said the impression that Ireland had been vociferous 
on Croatia\'s behalf at the December 9 COREPER perhaps derived 
from the fact that Ireland had repeated its position in a 
discussion to which not many Member State represenatives had 
contributed.  \"We\'re not going to be the last man in the 
ditch on this issue,\" observed Gaffey.  He expressed doubt 
that there would be serious discussion on the Croatia issue 
at the GAERC, since Member State positions were already well 
known.  He added that Ireland\'s principal objective since its 
presidency had been to avoid the scenario now emerging where 
Member States would have to consider simultaneously the start 
of accession negotiations for both Turkey and Croatia, given 
the possibility of temptations for Member States to establish 
linkage.

1. (C)  On December 9, Amb. Kenny met with Willie O\'Dea in 
O\'Dea\'s new capacity as Ireland\'s Minister of Defense. The 
ambassador underscored the value of close U.S.-Irish 
cooperation, especially in peacekeeping and information 
exchange.  The Ambassador urged Ireland to extend its mission 
in Afghanistan beyond July 2005.  He encouraged O\'Dea to let 
Irish defense personnel take advantage of U.S. training, and 
emphasized that Ireland gains in the eyes of its EU 
colleagues when its equipment, training, and field experience 
are of the highest quality.  He cited Ireland\'s purchase of 
Javelin in that regard, and the performance of its 
peacekeepers, especially in Afghanistan and Liberia.  The 
ambassador expressed his regret that Ireland had not selected 
Sikorsky\'s Black Hawk helicopter, and made clear that the 
U.S. expected Ireland\'s procurement practices to be fair and 
transparent.  O\'Dea is still learning his brief and thus was 
not yet prepared to go into issues in detail.  That said, he 
confirmed Ireland\'s pride in its peacekeeping abilities, 
spoke with enthusiasm about his trip the week of December 13 
to Liberia, where he and President McAleese will visit Irish 
peacekeepers, and said he would be very interested in 
exploring opportunities for more training/education.  On 
Sikorsky, the minister said that he had deliberately not 
gotten involved directly, believing that the process must be 
clearly free from politics.  The Secretary General, Michael 
Howard, said he believed the process of selecting a new 
helicopter had been fair and transparent.  He said the Black 
Hawk exceeded Irish requirements and cost contraints.  The 
Ambassador sent the minister a letter following this meeting, 
supporting Sikorsky\'s request for more information from the 
GOI.

SUBJECT:  Ireland/Terrorism:  Bill Passes in Lower 
House 
 
 
1. Summary:  On December 14, 2004, the Criminal 
Justice (Terrorism Offences) Bill 2002, was passed by 
Dail Eireann (Lower House).  The Seanad Eireann (Senate) 
is expected to approve the bill in February 2005, after 
which it can be enacted into Irish Law.  This 
legislation will significantly strengthen Irish 
ability to prosecute those suspected of supporting 
terrorism. Current legislation allows GOI authorities 
to pursue and prosecute suspects of terrorism, notably 
terrorism financing, only if they also have committed 
criminal offenses in Ireland or have been designated 
by the UN or EU. The new legislation is likely to pass 
in the Senate and be signed into law by the Irish 
president by mid-February, reducing the potential for 
supporters of terrorism to use Ireland as a legal safe 
haven.  End Summary. 
 
2. This Bill amended the existing Offences against the 
State Acts 1939 - 1998 to enable Ireland to meet its 
UN and EU commitments. In presenting the Bill, 
Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell stated that the 
Bill would bring Ireland in line with United Nations 
Conventions and European Union Framework decisions on 
combating terrorism.  Enactment of the terrorism bill 
will set the legal framework for ratifying the four UN 
conventions on terrorism still pending.  Government 
officials anticipate the completion of the four 
Conventions by the end of 2005. 
 
3. Key features of the Bill include: 
 
- specified offences to become terrorist offences when 
committed with intent to seriously intimidate a 
population, unduly compel a Government or 
international organization to perform or abstain from 
performing an act, or seriously destabilize or destroy 
the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or 
social structures of a State or an international 
organization. 
 
- terrorist groups who commit terrorist offences in or 
outside the State to be unlawful organizations for the 
purposes of the Offences Against the State Acts 1939 - 
1998 and the relevant provisions of those Acts, 
including the offences of membership and directing an 
unlawful organization, to have application to such 
groups; 
 
- the creation of new offences of hostage taking, 
terrorist bombing, offences against internationally 
protected persons, and financing terrorism with 
provision for extra-territorial jurisdiction in 
accordance with the relevant UN Conventions; 
 
- provision to enable funds which are being used, or 
which may be intended to be used, for the purpose of 
committing terrorist offences, including financing 
terrorism, to be frozen and ultimately made subject to 
a disposal order in favor of the State by way of court 
orders; 
 
4. Sinn Fein opposed the Bill, their Justice 
spokesperson, Angus O\'Snodaigh, calling it a 
\'fundamentally flawed Bill\' and \'a Human Rights 
disaster waiting to happen\'. He indicated that the 
Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for 
Civil Liberties had both expressed concerns over the 
Bill and felt that this type of \'emergency\' 
legislation should be reviewed every 1-3 years. In 
response the Minister for Justice stated that it was 
\'perfectly feasible\' that terrorists could make plans 
in Ireland in relation to an act to be carried out 
elsewhere and the State should have adequate 
legislation to counter this.

STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) PART I 
 
REF: STATE 248987 
 
1.  Please see below outline for post\'s submission as chapter 
for 2004-2005 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
(INSCR) Part I. 
 
I. Summary 
 
The Republic of Ireland is not a transshipment point for 
narcotics to the United States, nor is it a hub for 
international drug trafficking. According to Government of 
Ireland (GOI) officials, overall drug use in Ireland 
continues to remain steady, with the exception of cocaine 
use, which doubled over the last two years. Seizures have 
also increased as traffickers attempt to import drugs in 
larger quantities. The GOI\'s National Drug Strategy is to 
significantly reduce drug consumption through a concerted 
focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment, and 
research. In 2004, the GOI signed the European Arrests 
Warrant Act 2003, allowing Irish police to have suspects 
detained by foreign police and extradited to Ireland for 
trial, and the Criminal Justice Act, enabling Irish 
authorities to investigate international criminality with EU 
member states.  Ireland is a party to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention. 
 
II. Status of Country 
 
Ireland is not a transit point for drugs to the United 
States; it is occasionally used as a transit point for 
narcotics trafficking to other parts of Europe, including 
across its land border to Northern Ireland. Ireland is not a 
significant source of illicit narcotics, though in a single 
raid in May, officials found a quantity of precursors 
intended to manufacture around euro 500 million worth of 
ecstasy and amphetamines. 
 
III. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2004 
 
Policy Initiatives. The GOI continued with drug abuse 
strategies it established in its National Drug Strategy for 
2001-2008. Its goal is to \"to significantly reduce the harm 
caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs 
through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, 
treatment and research.\"  By 2003, substance abuse programs 
were a part of every school curriculum in the country and the 
GOI launched the National Awareness Campaign on Drugs.  The 
campaign featured television and radio advertising, and 
lectures by police, supported by an information brochure and 
website, all designed to promote greater awareness and 
communication about the drug issue in Ireland. Regional Drug 
Tasks Forces (RDTF), set up to examine drug issues in local 
areas, were fully operational throughout the country. The GOI 
established a review procedure to measure how effectively 
each department in the government is internally implementing 
the National Drug Strategy.  The GOI will release the results 
and recommendations of this review in April 2005. 
 
Accomplishments. Seizures in 2003 totaled euro 121 million, 
three times the goal set in the National Drug Strategy, 
2001-2008.  The Justice Minister attributed this both to the 
increase in usage and improvements in law enforcement.  The 
Irish Police continued to cooperate closely with other 
national police forces. On December 12, after eight months of 
coordination among forces from the United Kingdom, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and Ireland, authorities cracked down on a major 
drug smuggling gang.  This gang is suspected of supplying 
cocaine to most of the drug users in Dublin and Limerick. 
This investigation is still in progress. 
 
Law Enforcement Efforts. Official statistics are not yet 
available for 2004 but the Garda confirmed that 
drug-related arrests remained constant over the previous 
three years (approximately 450 arrests per year by the 
National Drug Unit), and most drug-related 
arrests were for possession. Cannabis was the drug most often 
seized, followed by heroin, ecstasy and then cocaine. The 
value of seized drugs for 2003 was euro 121 million. 
 
Official statistics for 2004 are not yet available, but 
highlights of key raids, arrests and prosecutions include the 
January seizure of 500,000 ecstasy tablets worth a street 
value of euro 5 million. Also, in January, police seized 80 
kilograms of Khat, worth euro 200,000.  In February, local 
police, supported by the National Drugs Unit, seized eight 
kilos of cocaine estimated at euro 800,000.  In March, Irish 
police raided a cocaine-processing plant, recovering euro 
50,000 worth of contraband, and in another raid, police 
seized euro 400,000 worth of cocaine.  The same month, the

SUBJECT: IRELAND: 2004-2005 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL 
STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) PART I 
 
Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jailed a South African resident 
for three years for smuggling euro 30,000 worth of cannabis 
and an Irish citizen was sentenced for seven years for 
possession of euro 150,000 worth of cocaine and ecstasy. An 
April seizure netted 88 kilos of cannabis, estimated at a 
value of euro 1.14 million.  In May, officials found a 
quantity of precursors intended to manufacture around euro 
500 million worth of ecstasy and amphetamines.  Officials 
tracked chemicals shipments from southern China, to Rotterdam 
and then on to Ireland.  In June, police seized over euro 1 
million in cocaine from drug gangs.  On November 4, an 
American citizen was arrested at Dublin airport for smuggling 
4 kilos of cocaine from Lagos via Paris.  Her case is pending 
criminal proceedings.  On December 16, in three operations, 
Irish police seized up to euro 16 million in cocaine.  An 
arrest was made of a Nigerian national attempting to smuggle 
14.5 kilos into Dublin airport.  Another unrelated arrest 
during a raid resulted in the seizure of up to 60 kilos. 
Under the Drugs Trafficking Act, the suspect can be held 
without charge for a maximum of seven days. 
 
Corruption. There were no verifiable instances of police or 
other official corruption related to drug activities in 2004. 
 
Agreements and Treaties. The United States and Ireland signed 
a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) in January 2001, 
which was ratified by the Senate in 2003 and is awaiting 
ratification by the GOI. An extradition treaty between 
Ireland and the United States is currently in force. 
 
Ireland is a party to the 1998 UN Drug Convention, the 1961 
UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 
1972 Protocol, and the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic 
Substances. Ireland has signed, but not yet ratified, the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons.  In June, the Irish government signed the Criminal 
Justice Act of 2004 into law, enabling authorities across EU 
states to investigate international crimes.  In January, the 
European Arrests Warrant Act of 2003 became law, allowing for 
foreign arrests and extradition. 
 
Cultivation/Production. Only small amounts of cannabis are 
cultivated in Ireland. With the exception of the precursor 
chemicals seized in May, there is no evidence that synthetic 
drugs are being produced domestically. 
 
Drug Flow/Transit. Among drug abusers in Ireland, cocaine, 
cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy (MDMA), and heroin are the 
drugs of choice. Cocaine comes primarily from Colombia and 
other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Heroin, 
cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis are often packed into cars in 
either Spain or the Netherlands and then brought into Ireland 
for distribution around the country. This distribution 
network is controlled by 6 to 12 Irish criminal gangs based 
in Spain and the Netherlands. Herbal cannabis is primarily 
imported from South Africa. 
 
Domestic Programs (Demand Reduction). There are 7,100 
treatment sites for opiate addiction, exceeding the GOI\'s 
National Drug Strategy target of 6,500 treatment places. The 
Strategy also mandates that each area Health Board have in 
place a number of treatment and rehabilitation options. For 
heroin addicts, there are 65 methadone treatment locations. 
Most clients of treatment centers are Ireland\'s approximately 
14,500 heroin addicts, 12,400 of which live in Dublin.  In 
2004, the GOI undertook an evaluation of drug treatment 
centers\' ability to cope with the leveling off of heroin use 
and the increase of other drugs.  The review is due in early 
2005. 
 
IV. U.S. Policy Initiatives and Programs 
 
U.S. Policy Initiatives. In 2004, the United States continued 
legal and policy cooperation with the GOI, and benefited from 
Irish cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies such as 
the DEA. Information sharing, and joint operations and 
investigations between U.S. and Irish officials continued to 
strengthen ties between the countries. 
 
The Road Ahead. U.S. support for Ireland\'s counternarcotics 
program, along with U.S. and Irish cooperative efforts, 
continue to work to prevent Ireland from becoming a transit 
point for narcotics trafficking to the United States.

to First Secretary Sean O\'Regan, Deputy Director for Human 
Rights at the DFA.  O\'Regan said that Ireland supports the UN 
Human rights resolutions in the UNGA plenary.  Following the 
lead of the EU presidency, which, on December 8, encouraged 
member states to lobby for support, the GOI asked its 
embassies worldwide to lobby countries that voted no or 
abstained, to support the resolutions.  O\'Regan also said 
that the GOI is not pleased with the use of no action 
motions, and that Ireland is doing all it can to garner 
support, but is limited by its low number of worldwide 
missions.

SUBJECT: IRISH RESPONSE TO DEMARCHE ON THE EU BATTERY 
DIRECTIVE 
 
REF: STATE 259043 
 
1.  On December 17, Des Howard, Higher Executive Officer in 
the Waste Infrastructure and Regulation Section of the 
Department of the Environment and Local Government, responded 
to reftel queries on Ireland\'s views regarding the EU battery 
directive. 
 
A) What is Ireland\'s position on the ban of 
lead/cadmium/mercury? 
 
The Irish Government favors the proposed ban on cadmium, 
subject to exemptions for the cordless power tool industry. 
The Government favors the mercury and lead bans as proposed. 
 
B) Does Ireland have a collection system in place for 
batteries? 
 
Ireland\'s battery collection system is focused on automotive 
and industrial batteries.  A collection system for portable 
(general appliance) batteries is still in the developmental 
stages. 
 
C) What is the position of your country on collection targets? 
 
Collection targets are currently being negotiated in 
Brussels, and Ireland can accept the Presidency compromise 
proposal as currently tabled.  Although shorter lead times of 
up to one year for the second and third targets would be 
acceptable, Ireland would oppose any shortening of the period 
for the initial 20 percent target, due to the relatively 
underdeveloped state of battery collection/recycling in 
Ireland. 
 
D) What is the position of your country on the financing of 
collection? 
 
Financing should be \"producer-driven,\" with take-back systems 
for automotive and industrial batteries. 
 
E) Has your country formally assessed the impact this 
directive will have on domestic appliance and battery 
manufacturers? 
 
Ireland has not conducted a formal cost/benefit analysis or 
scientific impact assessment of the directive.  The 
Department of the Environment and Local Government, however, 
is considering the general implications of the directive.

SUBJECT: IRELAND: 2004-2005 INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL 
STRATEGY REPORT (INSCR) PART II 
 
REF: STATE 254401 
 
1.  Please see below outline for post\'s submission as chapter 
for 2004-2005 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
(INSCR) Part II. 
 
The primary sources of funds laundered in Ireland are 
narcotics trafficking, fraud and tax offenses. Money 
laundering mostly occurs in financial institutions and 
bureaux de change. Additionally, investigations in Ireland 
indicate that some business professionals have specialized in 
the creation of legal entities, such as shell corporations, 
as a means of laundering money. Trusts are also established 
as a means of transferring funds from the country of origin 
to offshore locations. The use of shell corporations and 
trusts makes it more difficult to establish the true 
beneficiary of the funds, which makes it difficult to follow 
the money trail and establish a link between the funds and 
the criminal. 
 
The use of solicitors, accountants, and company formation 
agencies in Ireland to create &shell companies8 has been 
cited in a number of suspicious transaction reports (STRs), 
and in requests for assistance from Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF) members. Investigations have disclosed that 
these companies are used to provide a series of transactions 
connected to money laundering, fraudulent activity, and tax 
offenses. The difficulties in establishing the &beneficial 
owner8 have been complicated by the fact that the directors 
are usually nominees and are often principals of a 
solicitors, firm or a company formation agency. 
 
Money laundering relating to narcotics trafficking and other 
offenses was criminalized in 1994. Financial institutions 
(banks, building societies, the Post Office, stockbrokers, 
credit unions, bureaux de change, life insurance companies, 
and insurance brokers) are required to report suspicious 
transactions and currency transactions exceeding 
approximately $15,000. The financial institutions are also 
required to implement customer identification procedures, and 
retain records of financial transactions In 2003, Ireland 
amended its Anti-Money Laundering law to extend the 
requirements of customer identification and suspicious 
transaction reporting to lawyers, accountants, auditors, real 
estate agents, auctioneers, and dealers in high-value goods, 
thus aligning its laws with the European Union\'s Second Money 
Laundering Directive of 2001. The Irish Financial Services 
Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) supervises the financial 
institutions for compliance with money laundering procedures. 
In addition to STRs, there are customs reporting requirements 
for anyone transporting more than euro 12,700. 
 
Ireland\'s international banking and financial services sector 
is concentrated in Dublin\'s International Financial Services 
Centre (IFSC). In 2004, a 430 international financial 
institutions and companies operated in the IFSC. Services 
offered include banking, fiscal management, re-insurance, 
fund administration, and foreign exchange dealing. The IFSRA 
regulates the IFSC companies that conduct banking, insurance, 
and fund transactions. Tax privileges for IFSC companies have 
been phased out over recent years and will totally expire in 
2005. 
 
In 1999, the Corporate Law was amended to address problems 
arising from the abuse of Irish-registered nonresident 
companies (companies which are incorporated in Ireland, but 
do not carry out any activity in the country). The 
legislation requires that every company applying for 
registration must demonstrate that it intends to carry on an 
activity in the country. Companies must maintain at all times 
an Irish resident director or post a bond as a surety for 
failure to comply with the appropriate company law. In 
addition, the number of directorships that any one person can 
hold, subject to certain exemptions, is limited to 25. This 
is aimed at curbing the use of nominee directors as a means 
of disguising beneficial ownership or control. 
 
In August 2001, the Government of Ireland (GOI) enacted the 
Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 (Company Act), to deal with 
problems associated with shell companies. The legislation 
establishes the Office of the Director of Corporate 
Enforcement (ODCE), whose responsibility it is to investigate 
and enforce the Company Act. The ODCE also has a general 
supervisory role in respect of liquidators and receivers. 
Under the law, the beneficial directors of a company have to 
be named. The Company Act also creates a mandatory reporting 
obligation for auditors to report suspicions of breaches of 
company law to the ODCE. In 2004, the ODCE had 20 
prosecutions resulting in fines of varying amounts. 
 
The Bureau of Fraud Investigation (BFI), Ireland\'s financial 
intelligence unit (FIU), analyzes financial disclosures. In 
2003, a new Irish legal requirement went into effect, 
mandating obligated reporting institutions to file STRs with 
the Revenue (Tax) Department in addition to the BFI. Ireland 
estimates that up to 95 percent of STRs may involve tax 
violations. The Value Added Tax (VAT) fraud scams are the 
most prolific and have increased significantly in recent 
years.  In 2004, the Criminal Assets Bureau took action in a 
number of such cases, the details of which are not yet 
available. 
 
The number of Suspicious Transactions Received (STRs) by the 
Irish national police decreased from 4,398 in 2002 to 4,254 
in 2003, a number of which are currently under investigation. 
 Convictions for money laundering offenses under the Criminal 
Justice Act totaled seven in 1999, ten in 2000, four in 2001, 
and two in 2002.  In 2003, there were three prosecutions 
resulting in two convictions, currently awaiting sentencing. 
A conviction on charges of money laundering carries a maximum 
penalty of 14 years, imprisonment and an unlimited fine. 
 
Under certain circumstances, the High Court can freeze, and 
where appropriate, seize the proceeds of crimes. When 
criminal activity is suspected, the exchange of information 
between police and the Revenue Commissioners is authorized. 
The Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) was established in 1996 to 
confiscate the proceeds of crime in cases where there is no 
criminal conviction. The CAB includes experts from Police, 
Tax, Customs and Social Security Agencies. Under the Proceeds 
of Crime Act 1996, specified property may be frozen for a 
period of seven years unless the Court is satisfied that all 
or part of the property is not the proceeds of crime.  Since 
1996, the CAB has frozen over euro 50 million of assets, and, 
in 2003, collected euro 10 million in taxes against the 
proceeds of criminal activity.  In 2003, the CAB initiated 
criminal prosecutions against a number of persons for 
breaches of criminal law and proceeded with successful 
investigations/prosecutions for revenue and social welfare 
offenses previously not presented before criminal courts. 
 
In 2002, the GOI introduced the Criminal Justice (Terrorist 
Offences) Bill targeting fund-raisers for both international 
and domestic terrorist organizations. In December 2004, the 
Lower House of Irish Parliament approved this Bill, paving 
the way for Senate approval in early 2005 and later 
ratification of the \"UN Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism,8 which will extend the existing 
powers of the Government to seize property and/or other 
financial assets belonging to groups suspected of involvement 
in terrorism financing. The bill will allow the Irish 
national police to apply to the courts to freeze assets where 
certain evidentiary requirements are met.  To date, Ireland 
has reported to the European Commission the names of seven 
individuals, including one in 2004, who maintained a total of 
nine accounts that were frozen in accordance with the 
provisions of the EU Anti-Terrorist Legislation. The 
aggregate value of the funds frozen was approximately 90,000 
euros. 
 
In 2003, a money laundering investigation concerning a bureau 
de change operation uncovered evidence of the laundering of 
terrorist funds derived from international smuggling. 
Substantial cash payments into the bureau de change were not 
reflected in the principal books, records, and bank account. 
The bureau de change held a large cash reserve that was drawn 
upon when necessary by members of the terrorist organization. 
The bureau de change remitted payments from its legitimate 
bank account to entities in other jurisdictions, on behalf of 
the terrorist organization. 
 
In terms of preventing money laundering, the Central Bank 
began reporting to the Irish police regarding institutions 
under its supervision.  The reports consisted of failure to 
establish identity of customer, failure to retain evidence of 
identification, or failure to adopt measures to prevent and 
detect the commission of a money laundering offense. 
 
The Central Bank participated with an Irish parliament 
sub-committee in drafting Guidance Notes for regulated 
institutions on combating and preventing terrorist financing. 
 These notes will be finalized and issued to institutions 
upon the passing of the pending Criminal Justice (Terrorist 
Offenses) Bill of 2002.  The Bill is expected to pass into 
law in February 2005. 
 
In January of 2001, Ireland and the United States signed a 
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Treaty (MLAT); 
however, it is not yet in force. An extradition treaty 
between Ireland and the United States is in force. Ireland is 
a member of the EU, the Council of Europe and the FATF. The 
FIU is a member of the Egmont Group. Ireland has signed, but 
not yet ratified, the UN International Convention for the 
Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the UN 
Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Ireland is 
a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and the Council of 
Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure, and 
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime.

Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Counsellor for European

Competitiveness Council meeting had not shed light on the 
Commission\'s plans to finance ITER.  He said that the Irish 
Government had previously requested details on financing and 
would reiterate this request early in the New Year.  Although 
the Competitiveness Council had reaffirmed the EU\'s 
commitment to a six-party consensus on ITER, Ireland\'s 
growing impression was that the Commission was prepared to 
proceed on its own with the project if necessary, said 
Hickey.  In that scenario, the issue of funding would become 
even more urgent for Member States as the principal 
financiers.  Hickey also observed that momentum in 
discussions between Japan and the EU on a possible

NEXT STEPS; AMB RAISES SECURITY OF U.S. INTERESTS 
 
REF: A. LONDON 9369 
     B. DUBLIN 1811 
 
Classified By: Ambassador James C. Kenny for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1. (C)  The President\'s Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, 
Mitchell B. Reiss, traveled to Dublin on December 16 to 
discuss next steps in the peace process with Irish officials. 
 Brendan Scannell, DFA Director of the Anglo-Irish Division, 
expressed views similar to those heard in London (reftel). 
Scannell talked about how close parties had come to a deal 
and praised USG efforts, especially the President\'s telephone 
calls to Gerry Adams and Ian Paisley.  Scannell expressed the 
view that a deal is still possible and contacts are 
continuing; however, he indicated that everyone needed the 
Christmas holiday to recover and to consider next steps. 
Scannell talked about differences among the parties over 
verification (photos), the need to specify more precisely the 
role of the independent observers called for in the draft, 
and the problem of criminality, which was brought to a head 
when the IRA statement varied from the draft agreement. 
Scannell said that the Irish government would need an 
explicit commitment from Sinn Fein that it would forego 
criminality.  When Ambassador Kenny asked whether the IRA 
deliberately left out any reference to criminality in order 
to give itself some negotiating room, Scannell agreed that 
this was likely part of the reasoning. 
 
2.  (C)  Dr. Reiss also met Minister for Justice, Michael 
McDowell, and MoJ Secretary General Sean Aylward.  Aylward 
and McDowell evinced a similar fatigue and the need among all 
parties to use the Christmas break to cool down.  While they 
agreed with DFA\'s assessment of outstanding issues, they were 
more caustic in their discussion of Sinn Fein.  Minister 
McDowell is from the Progressive Democrats (PD), the junior 
partner in government and the party that immediately took to 
the floor of parliament when the IRA statement was published. 
 PD demanded an end to criminality as part of a comprehensive 
deal.  He thus was more openly critical of Sinn Fein and the 
IRA during his meeting with Reiss.  During the meeting, news 
of the conviction of the \"Colombia Three\" came in; unlike 
later statements from the Foreign Minister, McDowell and 
Aylward shed no tears at the news that the three IRA members 
were convicted and given a 17-year sentence by Colombian 
courts. 
 
3. (C) In addition to discussion of Northern Ireland issues, 
Ambassador Kenny raised USG concerns about the safety of 
American interests in Ireland, including the Embassy. 
Aylward said he took security of U.S. installations seriously 
and would look into the matter, at the same time noting the 
difficulty of protecting the large number of U.S. businesses 
in Ireland.  Aylward and the Ambassador discussed their 
efforts to reach out to the Muslim community.  The Ambassador 
noted USG satisfaction that the lower house of parliament 
finally passed counter-terrorism legislation (ref B).  When 
passed by the Senate, the legislation will give Ireland 
better legal instruments with which to pursue terrorists. 
 
4. (C)  Comment:  The Irish threw their heart and soul into 
the peace process, beginning with Leeds.  Their fatigue and 
discouragement was apparent during Reiss\' visit, as was their 
commitment to continue to push for the deal.  If a deal is to 
be cut before the UK parliamentary elections, all pieces 
would need to be in place by the end of March, in the GOI 
view.  At the moment, Sinn Fein has hurt its standing with 
the GOI.  The Prime Minister is taking serious political heat 
because of massive opposition to including the release of the 
killers of Garda (police officer) Gerry McCabe in a 
comprehensive settlement.  McCabe\'s killers were reportedly 
\"freelancing\" IRA members.  At the same time, Progressive 
Democrats have gotten the government to agree that a clear 
end to criminality is a necessary precursor to any deal. 
News of the conviction of the Colombia Three certainly did 
not help Sinn Fein either, and Gerry Adams\' remarks to the 
effect that no republicans were criminals were deemed absurd 
and disingenuous at best.  That said, Prime Minister Ahern 
wants a deal and needs a deal.  He is already focused on the 
2007 election campaign, hoping to go into that election 
saying that he helped put a comprehensive deal in place.  END

REF: STATE 269653 
 
1.  On December 21, Emboff delivered reftel points to First 
Secretary, Maurice Biggar, UN Desk, at the DFA.  On December 
 
SIPDIS 
9, Ireland became party to the Convention for the Suppression 
of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation 
and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against 
the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental 
Shelf (reftel points D and E). 
 
2.  According to Biggar, and other contacts at DFA and 
Department of Justice, passing new anti-terrorism legislation 
and adopting the remaining four UN Conventions against 
terrorism are high priorities for the GOI.  In 2002, the GOI 
introduced legislation, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist 
Offences) Bill, that would pave the way for Ireland\'s 
accession to all 12 counter-terrorism Conventions.  This Bill 
passed through the Irish Parliament\'s Lower House in December 
2004, and the Upper House will vote on it in early February 
2005.  The President is expected to sign this Bill into law. 
 
3.  Once this legislation is signed, according to Biggar, the 
GOI will take the decision to accede to the four remaining 
Conventions.  Note:  Per Irish law, any international treaty 
that results in charges on public funds must meet approval of 
the Irish Parliament.  End Note.  Biggar expects the Lower 
House to approve the terms of the Conventions and then submit 
a \"motion of approval\" to either the Minister of Justice or 
Minister of Foreign Affairs.  The Minister will then draw up 
the instruments of accession.  Biggar expects that the four 
remaining Conventions will be submitted simultaneously after 
passing the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill.  The 
process usually takes 90 days once the \"motion of approval\" 
is passed by the Parliament.

REF: DUBLIN 1811 
 
Classified By: Charge d\'Affaires Jonathan Benton for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: In a free-flowing December 22 meeting, the 
Ambassador and Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern agreed 
that President Bush\'s planned February visit to Europe 
presented an opportunity to reenergize trans-Atlantic ties. 
Ahern noted a \"huge willingness\" among his counterparts 
within the EU to repair relations.  Ahern said that there had 
been no recent movement on Northern Ireland, with the parties 
preparing to resume talks after the holidays.  He also 
cautioned that any substantiated link between the IRA and the 
December 21 Belfast bank robbery would have a \"very grave\" 
effect on peace efforts.  The Ambassador commended Ireland 
for recent anti-terrorism legislation, and Ahern cited GOI 
efforts to monitor the Embassy\'s security.  He added that 
information explaining USG policy on terrorism, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan would help the GOI to address unfavorable Irish 
public perceptions of the United States.  The Ambassador and 
Ahern also agreed on the importance of bilateral cooperation 
on problems concerning Irish citizens in the United States 
without proper documentation.  End summary. 
 
 
2.  (U) On December 22, the Ambassador, DCM, and econoff met 
with Irish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern, Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary General Dermot Gallagher, and 
DFA Political Division Director David Cooney.  The extremely 
cordial 90-minute meeting was the Ambassador\'s first official 
call on the Foreign Minister since Ahern had taken his post 
in a September 29 Cabinet reshuffle.  The discussion focused 
primarily on U.S.-EU relations, Northern Ireland, terrorism, 
and bilateral cooperation on travel/visa issues. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
U.S.-EU Relations: Willingness to Repair 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Ahern observed that there was a \"huge willingness\" 
within the EU to repair trans-Atlantic ties, and he agreed 
with the Ambassador that President Bush\'s planned February 
visit to Europe would be a key event for U.S.-EU relations. 
Ahern noted that U.S.-EU coordination on the Ukraine had been 
instrumental in securing an election rerun and that 
Washington and Brussels could also cooperate to good effect 
in the Middle East.  Ahern thought it would be helpful to 
meet with Secretary-designate Rice in February ahead of the 
President\'s visit to Europe, and the Ambassador suggested 
that St. Patrick\'s Day might offer a better opportunity for a 
meeting.  Ahern observed that President Bush would be 
visiting a Europe poised for significant changes, with the 
December 16-17 European Council decision to begin accession 
negotiations for Turkey.  He recounted that Turkish Prime 
Minister Erdogan had angered EU Member State counterparts 
with a champagne toast at the Council meeting\'s conclusion 
that underscored Turkey\'s unwillingness to recognize Cyprus. 
As a champion for Turkey during the Irish presidency, Prime 
Minister Bertie Ahern had taken particular offense at the 
remarks. 
 
--------------------------- 
Northern Ireland: All Quiet 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) There had been no movement on Northern Ireland since 
the visit of Special Envoy Reiss the week of December 13, 
with parties recessing until the week of January 3, said 
Ahern.  During Christmas week, the GOI had had contact with 
DUP leader Rev. Paisley, who had reiterated that republican 
acts of decommissioning without photographic evidence would 
have severe consequences for negotiations.  Ahern noted that 
although Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams had told the GOI on 
December 22 that photos were a non-starter, Martin McGuinness 
had earlier indicated some flexibility, provided the photos 
were not published.  Ahern added that, during the December 
16-17 EU Council meeting, Prime Minister Ahern and Tony Blair 
had agreed on the need to continue intensive mediation 
efforts.  FM Ahern said that he was pressing Brussels to 
maintain EU contributions to the International Fund for 
Ireland (IFI), and he expressed thanks for U.S. IFI 
allocations, which had benefited the Louth border 
constituency that he represents in Parliament.  He added that 
the GOI had not received information from Northern Ireland 
police on the December 21 euro 30 million bank robbery in 
Belfast.  He cautioned, however, that any substantiated link 
to the IRA would have a \"very grave\" effect on peace efforts 
because of what it would say about the IRA\'s commitment to 
give up paramilitary and criminal activity. 
 
------------------------ 
Irish Steps on Terrorism 
------------------------ 
5.  (C) The Ambassador expressed appreciation for Ireland\'s 
Criminal Justice Act, which had passed the lower house of 
Parliament on December 14 and would, when enacted in 2005, 
strengthen the GOI\'s ability to address potential terrorist 
threats (reftel).  The Ambassador also highlighted the attack 
on the U.S. Consulate in Jedda, other potential threats to 
U.S. interests in Ireland, and continuing concerns about the 
Embassy\'s security, particularly the need for enhanced 
perimeter protection.  Ahern responded that the national 
police (Garda) monitored the Embassy\'s security closely.  He 
added that the GOI watches suspected extremists very closely 
and is looking for ways to deport a Palestinian who had been 
worrisome in that regard.  (The person is one of two who had 
come to Ireland after having been among the roughly 120 
Palestinians involved in the Church of Nativity stand-off in 
Bethlehem in 2002.)  Reiterating Ireland\'s willingness to 
allow U.S. military transits at Shannon, Ahern asked for more 
Embassy information regarding the war on terror, as well as 
Iraq and Afghanistan, to help the GOI counter negative Irish 
public opinion about the United States.  DFA David Cooney 
recommended that the USG more widely publicize the fact that 
Guantanamo prisoners were availing themselves of the U.S. 
justice system to protect their rights. 
 
------------------ 
Travel/Visa Issues 
------------------ 
 
6.  (C) The Ambassador highlighted the importance of 
bilateral cooperation on travel/visa issues, noting that the 
Whelan cousins (two Irish citizens who had received media 
attention here for being jailed in the United States after 
overstaying J visas) would return to Ireland on Christmas 
eve.  Ahern expressed hope that such cooperation could extend 
to undocumented Irish illegals in the United States, many of 
whom he had met on U.S. trips during his tenure as Minister 
for Community, Family, and Social Affairs.  The Ambassador 
said that immigration legislation introduced by President 
Bush in 2004 and due for Congressional action in 2005 might 
offer at least partial solutions.  He also underscored the 
pressure that many U.S. states faced with illegal 
immigration, particularly in the southwest.  On other travel 
issues, Ahern remarked that Ireland had recently opened a 
state-of-the-art passport production facility that would make 
Irish passports among the most secure in the world.  He added 
that the GOI would begin a pilot project this year to put 
biometric chips in passports, but he cautioned that Ireland 
might not be ready by October 2005 to include biometric 
features in all new passports, in accord with U.S. 
requirements. 
 
---------- 
Miscellany 
---------- 
 
7.  (C) The Ambassador and Ahern also touched on the 
following issues: 
 
-- Open Skies.  Ahern cited the GOI\'s impression that U.S.-EU 
air transportation negotiations would take much longer than 
expected to produce an agreement.  Ireland thus wished to 
explore opportunities for liberalization at the bilateral 
level. 
 
-- Afghanistan.  DFA was reviewing with the Irish Department 
of Defense the USG request for Ireland to provide Explosive 
Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training for Afghan troops.  (DCM 
provided FM Ahern a paper prepared by Embassy DAO outlining 
the benefits of such a program.) 
 
-- Iraq.  Ahern expressed condolences for those killed and 
injured in the December 21 attack on the U.S. military mess 
hall in Mosul.  He noted that several Arab countries had 
sounded out Ireland on the option of delaying the scheduled 
January 30 elections.  Ireland had rebuffed these suggestions 
in the belief that it would be better to hold elections 
sooner rather than later, even with the expected escalation 
of insurgent violence. 
 
-- Colombia Three.  Ahern said that he would not raise with 
the Ambassador the case of the Colombia Three (alleged IRA 
members who remain in hiding after a Colombian appeal panel 
gave the men 17-year prison sentences for allegedly training 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)).  Ahern 
noted his personal hope, however, that the case would remind 
Irish citizens, as well as Irish Americans, of the IRA\'s 
dangerous history.  The Ambassador warned of the serious 
repercussions for U.S.-Irish relations if terrorist acts by 
the FARC against U.S. interests were to be tied back to 
training provided by the Colombia Three. 
 
8. (U) Ambassador Kenny was unable to clear this cable prior 
to his departure from Post.

1.  Two Irish citizens are presumed dead in Thailand (Phuket 
and Phi Phi), and roughly 50 Irish who were believed to be in 
the areas affected by the December 26 Asian tsunami are 
unaccounted for, according to Thomas Brady, Department of 
Foreign Affairs (DFA) Principal Officer for Consular 
Operations.  On December 29, Brady told Post that Irish 
efforts were focused on Thailand, the most popular Irish 
tourist destination among the locations struck by the 
tsunami.  Brady said that the DFA was making steady progress 
 
SIPDIS 
identifying Irish survivors of the disaster, but that 
communications difficulties and limited consular registers at 
the few Irish embassies in the region were hampering DFA 
efforts.  Irish Ambassador to Malaysia, Dan Mulhall, who has 
responsibility for Thailand, is now in Phuket and has 
confirmed that local hospitals treated 15 Irish citizens for 
injuries.  The Irish Deputy Chief of Mission in New Delhi, 
Pat Byrne, has arrived on Sri Lanka\'s coast, where about 20 
Irish citizens remain unaccounted for.  Brady noted that DFA 
hot lines had received roughly 1,000 calls from persons 
seeking information on Irish citizens, although in most cases 
the callers could not confirm that the citizens in question 
had been in the affected areas.  He added that the GOI had 
not made special provisions with airlines to transport Irish 
citizens home. 
 
2.  The GOI has pledged euro 2 million to relief efforts, 
noted Brady.  The Development Corporation Ireland (DCI), the 
aid agency within the DFA, will channel these funds 
principally to the international Red Cross.  The Irish Red 
Cross and Trocaire, a development assistance NGO established 
by the Irish Catholic Church, have each pledged euro 100,000 
for emergency aid.  Trocaire said it would direct its 
contributions to sister organizations in India and Sri Lanka. 
 Unicef Ireland has also pledged euro 150,000.  The Church of 
Ireland and the Irish Catholic Church intend to take up 
special donations for disaster areas during January 9 
services.

1.  There have been no biosafety developments in Ireland 
since the First Meeting of the Parties (MOP-1) to the 
Cartagena Protocol on February 23-27, 2004, according to Ian 
Keating, Principal Officer for Environment Policy in the 
Department of the Environment and Local Government.  In 
discussing reftel with Post, Keating noted that Ireland 
became a party to the Cartagena Protocol on February 12, 
2004, and that the Protocol\'s requirements applied throughout 
the EU by virtue of the provisions of EU Regulation 
1946/2003.  The Irish Government identified competent 
authorities for the purpose of the Protocol and of the EU 
Regulation in the domestic statute, \"Genetically Modified 
Organisms (Transboundary Movement) Regulations 2004,\" which 
took effect in Ireland also on February 12, 2004.  (Post will 
e-mail this statute to OES/ETC and EB/TPP/ABT.)  Ireland had 
thus completed implementing regulations on transboundary 
movement of GMOs prior to MOP-1.  Since MOP-1, Ireland has 
not implemented any laws, regulations, or practices relating 
to biosafety.

1.  (C) Summary: Four Irish citizens are presumed dead as a 
result of the December 26 Asian tsunami, and the Irish 
Government is focused on 15 other missing persons, most of 
whom had been in Thailand.  The Government has increased its 
assistance pledge for stricken areas from euro 2 million to 
euro 10 million, partly due to pressure from Irish NGOs, 
which have raised euro 8.5 million.  Irish relief efforts 
continue to be constrained by the limited number of Irish 
Embassy personnel available in the region, although there are 
no plans to send additional government staff.  The Irish 
Department of Defense has formed a group to consider 
possible, limited troop deployments to affected areas and has 
asked Post for operational planning information regarding 
possible cooperation with U.S. forces already deployed.  End 
summary. 
 
2.  (U) Four Irish citizens who were vacationing in Thailand 
at the time of the December 26 Asian tsunami are presumed, 
though not confirmed, dead, according to Thomas Brady, 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Principal Officer for 
Consular Operations, who spoke with Post on January 4 to 
update information he provided December 29 (ref A).  The DFA 
has categorized as \"urgent cases\" 15 other missing citizens 
who were known to be in the areas struck by the tsunami. 
There are an additional 55 \"low-risk cases\" involving persons 
who were believed to be in the countries affected, but whose 
family members have not contacted the DFA.  Brady noted that 
Ireland planned to send two forensics experts from the 
National Police (Garda) to the region in the coming days to 
assist with the identification of remains.  The Garda and DFA 
have also offered to take DNA samples from family members of 
missing citizens to check against recovered bodies in 
Thailand, where Irish efforts are principally focused.  Brady 
added that Irish Ambassador to Malaysia, Dan Mulhall, who has 
responsibility for Thailand, had already consulted with USG 
and Israeli Government personnel in Phuket regarding missing 
Irish citizens. 
 
3.  (U) In response to ref B demarche, Brady noted that the 
Irish Government had increased its pledge for relief efforts 
from euro 2 million to euro 10 million.  The original euro 2 
million has already been allocated to the international Red 
Cross, and Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Bertie Ahern is 
scheduled to meet with leading Irish aid NGOs on January 4 to 
discuss coordination on the disbursement of the additional 
euro 8 million.  These NGOs, which have so far raised euro 
8.5 million, include: GOAL (euro 1 million); UNICEF Ireland 
(euro 750,000); Concern (euro 1.6 million); Trocaire, the 
Irish Catholic Church development organization (euro 1.8 
million); and, Oxfam Ireland (euro 500,000).  Several of 
these organizations have begun to send personnel to 
tsunami-affected areas.  On January 3, 2,000 people took part 
 
SIPDIS 
in a charity walk in Dublin sponsored by GOAL, which raised 
euro 45,000. 
 
4.  (U) The Irish Government continues to be constrained in 
its relief efforts by communications difficulties and by the 
limited number of Irish Embassy personnel available in the 
region, although there are currently no plans to send 
additional government staff, according to Niall Brady, DFA 
First Secretary for Asian Affairs.  Brady told Post that the 
GOI was relying on the seven (total) diplomats stationed at 
the Irish Embassies in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and New Delhi 
to manage Ireland\'s consular caseload in Indonesia, Thailand, 
and Sri Lanka, respectively.  A Dublin-based DFA official who 
was vacationing in Thailand at the time has also stayed on in 
Phuket to assist.  Brady mentioned that Prime Minister Ahern 
is scheduled to visit China in late January and may add one 
of the affected Asian countries to his itinerary.  Brady 
added that Ahern was planning to take a holiday the week of 
January 10, which would give impetus to finalizing Ireland\'s 
short-term assistance plans this week. 
 
5.  (C) On January 4, the Irish Department of Defense 
notified Embassy\'s DAO that it had formed a planning group to 
consider possible, limited Irish troop deployments to 
tsunami-affected areas (ref C).  The Department of Defense 
 
SIPDIS 
requested risk assessments, situation updates, and other data 
regarding possible areas of cooperation with U.S. military 
forces already deployed.  The Irish Defense Department 
reported that Prime Minister Ahern would consult with his 
Cabinet on January 5 about the possibility of committing 
Irish troops.  (The Irish Government has capped at 850 the 
number of troops that can be deployed to overseas missions, 
and currently there are roughly 750 troops so deployed.  On 
December 31, Irish Defense Minister Willie O\'Dea told the 
press that the Government was prepared to exceed the 850 
limit to meet the needs of tsunami-stricken countries.) 
 
6.  (U) Comment: Generally, the Irish public appears to be 
satisfied with the Irish Government\'s response to the 
disaster, although NGO pressures certainly accounted for the 
Government\'s decision to increase its assistance pledge to 
euro 10 million.  Representatives of opposition parties have 
used the tsunami aid issue to highlight the fact that the 
Government is only contributing 0.45 percent of GNP to 
official development assistance, well short of Ireland\'s 
Millennium commitment of 0.7 percent.

GOI did not plan to contribute observers or provide other

supported EU funding and other forms of assistance for the 
elections and had also contributed euro 500,000 to the UN 
protection force in Iraq.

1.  On January 10, Post delivered reftel talking points to 
Thomas Brady, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Principal 
Officer for Consular Operations, who had provided information 
for refs A and B.  Brady noted that Mary Whelan, Irish 
Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, and Kiera O\'Brien, First 
Secretary of Development Corporation Ireland (DCI, Ireland\'s 
 
SIPDIS 
official aid agency, a division of the DFA), would 
participate in the January 11 UNOCHA Tsunami Donor Conference 
in Geneva.  Brady said that the Irish Government\'s assistance 
pledge for tsunami-affected areas stood at euro 10 million, 
although Irish NGOs, which have raised over euro 20 million 
privately, were pressuring the GOI to pledge more.  Brady 
pointed out that Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern and DCI 
Director General Roland Murphy had toured Phuket on January 9 
with a GOI needs assessment team and the heads of the four 
major Irish aid NGOs: Concern, GOAL, Trocaire, and the Irish 
Red Cross.  The group was scheduled to tour Aceh on January 
10 and Sri Lanka the following day. 
 
2.  In terms of a consular update, Brady noted that one Irish 
citizen had been confirmed dead and that three others were 
presumed dead.  Over the weekend of January 7, the number of 
\"urgent cases\" involving persons unaccounted for had narrowed 
from 15 (ref B) to 2.  There remained roughly 40 cases in 
which DFA had received calls about persons who were believed 
to have been in the countries affected.  In only 2 of the 
cases, however, had family members made the calls.  Brady 
mentioned that FM Ahern had announced the opening of a 
consular office in Phuket to assist Irish citizens in the 
area.  On January 9, Ahern had also visited a victim 
identification center in Phuket, where Irish forensics 
experts were working with Thai authorities on DNA comparisons.

(C)  On January 11, POL/ECON Chief delivered reftel demarche 
to Margaret Stanley, Americas desk officer, and emphasized 
steps Ireland can take even though it does not have an 
embassy in Cuba, such as inviting dissidents to Europe and 
supporting their work in Cuba, supporting an EU visa ban 
regime targetting human rights abusers, and raising concerns 
with the Cuban mission in Ireland.  Stanley said that Ireland 
is concerned about the human rights situation in Cuba.  The 
Director for Latin America regularly meets with the Cuban DCM 
(the Cuban ambassador is resident in London), and recently 
called him in to urge that all dissidents be released from 
prison. Stanley is circulating U.S. ideas around DFA as well 
as with the Irish embassy in Mexico, which covers Cuba, and 
will touch base following GOI review.

SUBJECT: BATTLE GROUPS: GOI TO TAKE SLOW APPROACH 
 
 
Classified By: DCM JON BENTON FOR REASONS 1.4 B AND D 
 
1.  (C)  Keith McBean, Director of Security Policy at DFA, 
told POL/ECON Chief January 11 that Defense Minister O\'Dea\'s 
recent commments to the press on Irish participation in EU 
battlegroups was not coordinated with other ministries.  In 
an interview over the weekend, O\'Dea cited legal and policy 
issues that would make Irish participation in a battle group 
difficult.  The well-known \"triple lock\" policy of the Irish 
government provides for deployment of armed Irish forces only 
under a UN resolution and with approval of the government and 
parliament, a long process that could be inconsistent with 
\"rapid response.\"  There are also restrictions on joint 
training Irish forces can do (absent a UN resolution) and on 
foreign troops training on Irish soil.  O\'Dea cited these 
issues as complicating Irish desires to participate in a 
battlegroup. 
 
2.  (C)  McBean took pains to emphasize that Irish policy has 
not changed:  the Irish are positively disposed to 
participate in a battle group, but were not planning to do so 
imminently in any case for political and legal reasons.  The 
Prime Minister\'s top foreign policy goal is Irish 
ratification of the EU constitution, a goal that could be 
undermined if the public sees Ireland\'s EU defense 
obligations undercutting its cherished neutrality.  In 
addition to the political desire to put battlegroups on the 
slow burner, the government does have legal and policy 
hurdles to sort out, as Defense Minister O\'Dea indicated.  An 
intergovernmental group (DFA, DoD, Attorney General) 
continues to meet on those questions. 
 
3.  (C) Comment:  The GOI is extremely proud of its 
peacekeeping contributions and McBean was clear in stating 
that Ireland will continue that practice, irrespective of 
whether or when it joins an EU battlegroup.  Defense Minister 
O\'Dea\'s comments to the press seem one part the actions of a 
minister new to defense, who forgot to coordinate with other 
ministries or to consider the reaction of EU partners, and 
one part the actions of a minister who has long been a member 
of parliament and who wanted to put his spin on the issue 
before parliament reconvenes.  End Comment.
