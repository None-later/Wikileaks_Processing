2.  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY NAIK SUMMARIZED HIS 
AMBASSADOR\'S APPRAISAL OF UPTURN IN IRAN-SOVIET TIES. 
THE AMBASSADOR ASSERTS IRANIAN RATIONALE IS BASICALLY 
PRAGMATIC AND ASSERTS TREND WILL CONTINUE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  RESPONDING TO MY EARLIER REQUEST FOR GOP THINKING 
ON THE MEANING OF THE APRIL 5 VISIT TO MOSCOW OF IRANIAN 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER HOSSEIN ARDEBILI, THE FOREIGN 
SECRETARY APRIL 19 SUMMARIZED FOR POLCOUNSELOR AND ME A 
CABLE JUST RECEIVED.  WE SHOULD PROTECT THE SOURCE 
COMPLETELY. 
 
THE SIGNS OF AN UPTURN 
---------------------- 
4.  EARLY IN 1984, THE GOI HAD INDICATED ITS INTENTION 
TO TRY THE TUDEH PARTY LEADERS, SENT LOW LEVEL OFFICIALS 
TO THE SOVIET REVOLUTIONARY DAY CELEBRATIONS, AND 
LIMITED SOVIET DIPLOMATS\' CONTACTS.  ALL THIS LEFT THE 
SOVIET AMBASSADOR IN TEHRAN VOICING GLOOMY AND NEGATIVE 
PROGNOSIS FOR RELATIONS. 
- 
5.  THE SOVIET PATIENCE NOW SEEMS TO BE BEARING FRUIT 
AS: 
 
-- THE IRANIANS POSTPONED THE TUDEH TRIALS (IN NOVEMBER); 
 
-- RAFSANJANI ATTENDED AND SPOKE PROFUSELY AT THE 10-DAY 
DAWN(SIC) CELEBRATION; AND 
 
-- THE IRANIAN PRESS HAS STARTED TO CAST THE SOVIETS IN 
A MORE FAVORABLE LIGHT. MOST RECENTLY A PROMINENT 
COLUMNIST QUESTIONED THE GOVERNMENT\'S RATIONALE FOR NOT 
HAVING CONSULTED WITH THE SOVIETS DURING RECENT 
DIPLOMATIC DEMARCHES MADE WHEN THE WAR INTENSIFIED (WHY 
NOT INCLUDE THE NUMBER ONE SUPERPOWER--OUR STRONG 
NEIGHBOR?). 
- 
WHAT IRAN WANTS 
--------------- 
6.  IN CONTEXT OF AN INCREASINGLY COSTLY WAR, THE 
AMBASSADOR CONCLUDES IRAN SEEKS: 
 
-- TO EASE ITS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, E.G., WITH POSSIBILITY 
OF GAS SALES TO THE SOVIETS; 
 
-- SECURE LINES OF COMMUNICATION--THERE APPEARS TO BE 
SOME UNCERTAINTY OVER THE TURKISH LOC; AND 
 
-- ESTABLISH ALTERNATIVE AIR ROUTES--THE IRAQI THREAT 
HAS CUT MOST OF IRAN AIR\'S WESTWARD SERVICE, AND THE 
SOVIETS HAVE OFFERED A NEW ROUTE TO FRANKFURT VIA 
MOSCOW. 
 
7.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES A NUMBER OF TANGIBLE 
INDICATORS ALREADY REFLECTING BENEFITS OF INCREASED 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION: 
 
-- THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING BUILD POWER GENERATORS, 
AND SEEKING TO EXPAND THIS AREA OF COOPERATION. 
 
-- TWO-WAY TRADE IN 1985 SHOULD EXCEED $2 BILLION. 
 
-- A JOINT MINISTERIAL MEETING WILL BE HELD IN MAY-JUNE, 
AND EXPERTS WILL MEET IN MOSCOW IN MAY TO LOOK AT OTHER 
STEPS FOR ENHANCING ECONOMIC RELATIONS. 
- 
ARDEBILI VISIT 
-------------- 
8.  PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SURMISES THE SOVIETS WILL 
HAVE REITERATED OPPOSITION TO THE WAR\'S CONTINUATION. 
HE BELIEVES THE IRANIAN SIDE LIKELY ONLY LISTENED.  THE 
IRANIANS WOULD HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT SOVIET ARMS 
SUPPLIES TO IRAQ--WHETHER SOVIETS TAKE NOTE WILL 
PROBABLY DEPEND ON SOVIET PERCEPTIONS OF IRAN\'S POST-WAR 
INTENTIONS.  THE SOVIETS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SEE IRAN 
TOO STRONG. 
 
9.  THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR SEES THESE CURRENT MOVES 
AS A MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE.  IRAN FEELS INCREASINGLY 
ISOLATED.  ITS REMAINING ARAB SUPPORTERS, E.G., SYRIA 
AND LIBYA, ARE SOVIET FRIENDS.  AMBASSADOR ASSERTS MANY 
IRANIANS WOULD PREFER BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., 
BUT THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY TIDE IS STILL FLOWING TOO 
STRONG, THE U.S. IS NOT READY FOR SUCH MOVES, AND IN ANY 
CASE IS TOO DISTANT.  RUSSIA ON THE OTHER HAND IS A 
POWERFUL NEIGHBOR WHICH CAN DO IMMEDIATE GOOD OR EVIL. 
- 
10.  NAIK, EXTENDING THE POINT MADE ABOUT THE U.S., 
NOTED THAT THE IRANIAN DELEGATION AT THE RECENT 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION ORGANIZATION (ECO) COMMITTEE 
MEETINGS HAD EXPANDED THE CONSENSUS TO GET TECHNICAL 
COOPERATION (IF NECESSARY) FROM \"WESTERN INDUSTRIALIZED 
COUNTRIES.\"  PAKISTAN AND TURKEY HAD INITIALLY PROMOTED 
THE IDEA OF \"REST OF THE WORLD\" OUT OF CONCERN THAT 
IRAN WOULD BALK AT A GROUPING THAT INCLUDED THE U.S.-- 
INSTEAD THE IRANIANS EXPLICITLY EXPRESSED PREFERENCE 
FOR THE WESTERN COUNTRIES FORMULATION. 
 
11.  COMMENT:  NO DOUBT THE GOP IS WATCHING THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.  THEY UNDERSTAND 
OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN STATE TERRORISM BUT WOULD 
WELCOME U.S. MOVES TO EASE IRAN\'S ISOLATION.  SHORT OF 
THAT THEY HOPE WE SHOW UNDERSTANDING AND PATIENCE AS 
THEY WORK TO HELP KEEP IRAN FROM FALLING UNDER 
SUBSTANTIAL SOVIET SWAY WITH ALL THAT WOULD MEAN FOR 
PAKISTAN AND AFGHANISTAN.  CERTAINLY THE LONG-TERM 
RISKS FOR OUR INTERESTS DEMAND WE TAKE SUCH AN 
ATTITUDE.

SUBJECT: KHAMENEI\'S VISIT: RESURGENCE OF SHIA EXTREMISM? 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY: THE SUCCESSFUL (FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE) 
VISIT OF KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BOOSTED THE MORALE OF 
THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS HERE. APPARENTLY FLUSH WITH NEW 
FUNDS, THE SHIAS HAVE BEGUN MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH 
THE ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US OPPOSITION, PARTICULARLY OVER 
LIBYA. SUCH CAUSES EVOKE LITTLE PUBLIC SYMPATHY, AND 
THE ATTITUDES OF THE SUNNI MAJORITY -- MANY OF WHOM 
HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK UPON ANY SIGNS OF SHIA ASSERTIVENESS 
WITH SUSPICION AND DISTASTE -- WILL CONTINUE TO LIMIT 
THE ABILITY OF THE RADICAL SHIAS TO PURSUE SPECIFICALLY 
SECTARIAN GOALS. HOWEVER, SHIA EXTREMISTS WILL 
DOUBTLESS SEEK TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR FANNING 
ANTI-AMERICANISM AMONG THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. A HEATING 
UP OF THE AL QUDS EPISODE WOULD TURN ALL GROUPS AGAINST 
US.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE KHAMENEI VISIT 
 
2. ONE WORRISOME ASPECT OF THE RECENT VISIT OF IRANIAN 
PRESIDENT KHAMENEI TO PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE APPARENT 
NEW LEASE ON LIFE IT HAS GIVEN TO RADICAL SHIA 
ORGANIZATIONS HERE. PAKISTANI SHIAS CLEARLY VIEWED THE 
VISIT PRIMARILY AS A SECTARIAN ONE, AND THE COMMUNITY 
AS A WHOLE WENT ALL OUT TO ENSURE KHAMENEI\'S WELCOME 
WAS A WARM ONE. HUGE THRONGS OF SHIAS WERE BUSED TO THE 
AIRPORTS IN LAHORE AND ISLAMABAD TO GREET KHAMENEI AND 
WELCOMING POSTERS SPRUNG UP IN THE MAJOR CITIES OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
3. THE MONEY FOR THIS MAJOR EFFORT APPARENTLY CAME FROM 
TWO SOURCES: WEALTHY PAKISTANI SHIAS AND THE IRANIAN 
GOVERNMENT. THE FUNDS WERE FUNNELED PRIMARILY THROUGH 
TWO RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS, THE TEHRIK-E-NIFAZ-E- 
FIQH-E-JAFFRIA AND THE IMAMIA STUDENTS ORGANIZATION 
(ISO). THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAD BEEN IN THE 
FOREFRONT OF THE SECTARIAN AGITATION LAST YEAR. 
HOWEVER, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS -- PERHAPS INCLUDING 
THE FEAR OF A SUNNI BACKLASH -- THEY HAD BEEN 
RELATIVELY QUIET FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS. 
 
4. IN UTILIZING THE NEW FUNDS AVAILABLE, THE EXTREMIST 
SHIAS ENSURED THAT KHAMENEI\'S WELCOME TOOK ON A 
RADICAL, ANTI-GOP, ANTI-US TINGE. THE CROWDS CHANTED 
ANTI-AMERICAN SLOGANS, MANY OF THE BANNERS WERE ON AN 
ANTI-AMERICAN THEME, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF SHIAS AT THE 
DEPARTURE CEREMONY OPENLY SHOWED DISRESPECT TO 
PRESIDENT ZIA, SURROUNDING HIS CAR AND MAKING OBSCENE 
GESTURES. 
 
RENEWED SELF-CONFIDENCE 
 
5. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KHAMENEI VISIT, THE RADICAL 
SHIAS APPEAR MORE SELF-CONFIDENT THAN THEY HAVE IN 
MONTHS. SINCE KHAMENEI\'S DEPARTURE, THE ISO HAS BEEN 
PARTICULARLY ACTIVE IN SUPPORTING THE FLURRY OF 
ANTI-AMERICAN, PRO-LIBYAN RALLIES WHICH OPPOSITION 
POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY. THESE RALLIES HAVE NOT STRUCK A POPULAR CHORD 
-- ATTENDANCE HAS ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN SMALL -- BUT 
THE AMOUNT OF ORGANIZATIONAL EFFORT WHICH HAS GONE INTO 
THEM AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE POPPED UP ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY MAKES THIS PHENOMENON NOTEWORTHY. 
 
LIMITS 
 
6. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE RADICAL SHIA ORGANIZATIONS 
WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED BY TWO FACTORS: 
THE  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND FEAR OF A SUNNI 
BACKLASH. THE RECENT ACTIVISM OF THE RADICAL SHIAS 
APPEARS TO BE A MANIFESTATION NOT ONLY OF EUPHORIA 
FOLLOWING THE KHAMENEI VISIT, BUT ALSO OF A GREATER 
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. THE MONEY BEING SPENT NOW --MUCH 
OF WHICH PRESUMABLY IS LEFT-OVER FROM THE VISIT -- WILL 
HAVE TO BE REPLENISHED IF THE SHIAS ARE TO MAINTAIN 
THEIR CURRENT LEVEL OF ACTIVITY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE 
IRANIAN GOVERNMENT -- THE MOST LIKELY PAYMASTER -- WILL 
THEN BECOME CRUCIAL -- WILL THE IRANIANS RISK 
ANTAGONIZING THE GOP TO PLAY THEIR OWN SECTARIAN GAMES 
IN PAKISTAN? 
 
7. GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC IMBALANCE -- AND THE GROWING 
INTOLERANCE OF SHIA \"DEMANDS\" BY THE VAST SUNNI 
MAJORITY, THE SHIAS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PURSUE 
SUCCESSFULLY A SPECIFICALLY SHIA AGENDA. INDEED, THE 
LEVEL OF GRUMBLING AMONGST THE SUNNIS ABOUT THE SHIAS 
HAS NOTICEABLY RISEN AS A RESULT OF A PERCEPTION THAT 
THE SHIAS \"HIJACKED\" KHAMENEI\'S VISIT FOR THEIR OWN 
PURPOSES AND ARE -- ONCE AGAIN -- GROWING UPPITY. 
PRESIDENT ZIA HIMSELF IS REPORTEDLY ENRAGED BY HIS 
TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF KHAMENEI\'S WELL-WISHERS AND 
HAS TOLD THE SECURITY FORCES TO CHECK CLOSELY INTO THE 
OPERATIONS --AND FUNDING -- OF THE RADICAL SHIAS. 
 
8. PRESUMABLY, A RECOGNITION THAT THEY CAN NOT AFFORD 
TO GO IT ALONE AT LEAST PARTIALLY EXPLAINS WHY THE 
RADICAL SHIAS ARE INCREASINGLY MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH 
THE EXTRA-PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION AND IN PARTICULAR 
HAVE LASHED ON TO THE LIBYAN CAUSE AS TOOL FOR 
AMERICAN-BASHING. 
 
9. THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE, THE MOVEMENT FOR THE 
RESTORARTION OF DEMOCRACY (MRD), HAS BEEN WILLING TO 
MAKE COMMON CAUSE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WITH THE 
SHIAS. IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS A NATURAL ALLIANCE OF 
GROUPS ON THE OUTS WITH THE PRESENT SYSTEM. FOR THE 
MRD, HOWEVER, THE SHIAS REPRESENT A TWO-EDGED SWORD: 
SHIA EXTREMISTS MIGHT HIJACK THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
MOVEMENT FOR THEIR OWN RADICAL PURPOSES, THEREBY 
ALIENATING MUCH OF THE MRD\'S CONSTITUENCY (MANY OF WHOM 
ARE FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE SUNNIS). 
 
COMMENT 
 
10.  FOR THE MOMENT, THE TACTIS OF THE RADICAL SHIAS 
APPEAR UNLIKELY TO SUCCEED:  THE GOVERNMENT APPEARS 
FAIRLY FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE, AT LEAST OVER THE SHORT 
TERM; AND COLONEL QADDHAFI\'S CAUSE EVOKES LITTLE PUBLIC 
SYMPATHY -- TOO MANY PAKISTANIS CONSIDER HIM A 
TERRORIST. IF, HOWEVER, AN ANTI-AMERICAN CAUSE ARISES 
AROUND WHICH A LARGER SECTION OF THE PAKISTANI POPULACE 
CAN UNITE -- AND EVENTS SUCH AS RECENTLY HAPPENED AT 
THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE COULD PROVE TO BE SUCH A CATALYST -- 
THE RADICAL SHIAS WILL NO DOUBT DO ALL THEY CAN TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION.

2.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION JULY 22, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY 
FOR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHAHARYAR KHAN WAS WILLING 
TO EXPAND ON HIS INITIAL BRIEFING AND TO PROVIDE ANSWERS 
TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS RAISED IN REF A.  SHAHARYAR MADE 
CLEAR THAT HIS COMMENTS WERE BASED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON 
CONVERSATIONS HE HAD HAD WITH PAKISTANI EMBASSY OFFICIALS, 
BUSINESSMEN AND MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES LIVING IN TEHRAN. 
HE HIMSELF HAD BEEN THERE FOR ONLY FIVE DAYS AND HAD 
MOVED AROUND THE CITY VERY LITTLE BUT, IN GENERAL WHAT HE 
HAD SEEN SEEMED TO BEAR OUT WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD.  HE 
ADDED THAT THE PRIVATE PAKISTANI COMMUNITY IN TEHRAN IS 
LARGE, HAS PRETTY GOOD ACCESS, AND HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR 
A LONG TIME. 
 
3.  SHAHARYAR STATED THAT HIS INITIAL COMMENTS ON THE 
GROWING DISENCHANTMENT OF THE POPULATION WERE MEANT TO 
ENCOMPASS THE LOWER CLASSES.  TO HIM, THERE WOULD BE 
NOTHING NEW ABOUT DISAFFECTION AMONG THE BOURGEOIS 
ELEMENT; WHAT IS NEW IS THAT THE LOWER CLASSES, BOTH IN 
TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE ARE INVOLVED.  WHEN I ASKED HIM 
WHY THIS WAS OCCURRING, HE POINTED TO THE CONSCRIPTION OF 
12-13 YEAR OLDS AS THE MAJOR FACTOR, WITH PARENTS NOT 
BEING WILLING TO ACCEPT THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A MOVE. 
 
4.  HE HIMSELF HAD NOT BEEN OUTSIDE TEHRAN ON THIS TRIP. 
HOWEVER, PAKISTAN EMBASSY OFFICIALS AND PRIVATE CITIZENS 
CAN MOVE ABOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE WITH FEWER RESTRICTIONS 
THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER FOREIGNERS.  (AS EVIDENCE, HE 
RECOUNTED AN ANECDOTE IN WHICH THE PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR 
WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE ON TO HIS SKIING DESTINATION AFTER 
HIS SCANDINAVIAN COLLEAGUES HAD BEEN TURNED BACK AT A LOCA 
CHECKPOINT.)  THESE PAKISTANI SOURCES ARE IN AGREEMENT, 
HE SAID, THAT THE ORDINARY PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY DIS- 
ENCHANTED WITH THE WAR. 
 
5.  ACCORDING TO SHAHARYAR, THE \"MODERATE\" CLERICAL GROUP 
IS LED BY RAFSANJANI, PRESIDENT KHAMENEI AND FOREIGN 
MINISTER VELAYATI.  HE DOUBTED THAT THEY HAD CONVEYED THEI 
VIEWS ON THE WAR DIRECTLY TO ANY PAKISTANI OFFICIALS BUT 
SAID THAT IT WAS RELATIVELY COMMON FOR IRANIAN THIRD 
PARTIES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR VIEWS TO THE PAKISTAN 
EMBASSY.  HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE LEADERS HAD YET 
OPENLY DEBATED ANY DIFFERENCES OF VIEW ON THE WAR WITH 
THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENEI NOR DID HE THINK THAT KHOMENEI WAS 
LIKELY TO BE PERSUADED BY SUCH A DEBATE.  AS TO ANY 
\"MIDDLE GROUND,\" IN SHAHARYAR\'S VIEW NO ONE IN IRAN, 
INCLUDING KHOMENEI, WOULD SERIOUSLY HOLD OUT FOR THE 
ELIMINATION OF THE BAATH PARTY AS A PRECONDITION FOR ENDIN 
THE WAR EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS BEEN A PUBLIC IRANIAN DEMAND. 
HE RESTATED THAT WHAT THE MODERATES ARE LOOKING AT IS A 
SOLUTION WHICH WOULD NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRE THE DEPARTURE 
OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM POWER. 
 
6.  SHAHARYAR WAS RELUCTANT TO MAKE ANY ESTIMATE AS TO 
WHETHER ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER AMONG THE CLERGY IS MOVING 
INTO THE ASCENDANT OR ABOUT THE POSSIBLE TIME BEYOND WHICH 
THE PRESENT SITUATION WOULD NOT ENDURE.  HE DID SAY THAT 
HIS OFFICIAL AND NON-OFFICIAL PAKISTANI CONTACTS GENERALLY 
THOUGHT THAT ONE YEAR WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS THE PRESENT 
SITUATION COULD CONTINUE WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT DOING 
SOMETHING TO RELIEVE THE GENERAL DISCONTENT BUT QUICKLY 
ADDED THAT HE HAD HEARD TOO MANY PREDICTIONS ABOUT IRAN 
IN THE PAST FOR HIM TO GIVE THEM MUCH CREDENCE. 
 
7.  SHAHARYAR SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI IS 
ANXIOUS TO VISIT ISLAMABAD PRIOR TO THE NAM MEETING IN 
HARARE AND THAT DATES IN THE SECOND OR THIRD WEEK OF 
AUGUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED (BUT NOT YET NAILED DOWN). 
ACCORDING TO HIM, THE GOI IS CONCERNED THAT IRAQ MAY BE 
HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN NAM CIRCLES ON A RESOLUTION THAT 
IRAN WOULD FIND ONESIDED AND IS ANXIOUS TO CONSULT WITH 
THE GOP ON THIS ISSUE.  SHAHARYAR EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS 
TO PASS ON ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ABOUT IRAN IN THE 
FUTURE.

COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO REFTEL\'S QUESTIONS. 
 
2.  SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM:  THE GOP IS POLITICALLY 
OPPOSED TO TERRORISM.  IT DOES NOT/NOT SUPPORT, 
SPONSOR OR TOLERATE TERRORIST GROUPS, TACTICS, OR 
METHODS.  IT HAS NOT/NOT GIVEN ANY SUPPORT PUBLICLY 
OR PRIVATELY TO A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE.  INDIA HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED 
PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING LOCAL TERRORISTS IN THE 
INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR WITH SANCTUARIES AND 
TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE GOP 
DENIES THESE ACCUSATIONS.  HARD EVIDENCE THAT MIGHT 
BACK UP INDIA\'S CHARGES IS LACKING. 
 
3.  1989 COURT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN 
ANY SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST 
CASES THIS YEAR.  THE ANO TERRORISTS CONVICTED OF 
THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI REMAIN IN 
PRISON.  THEIR APPEALS ARE STILL PENDING IN THE 
COURTS. 
 
4.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST EFFORTS IN 1989:  THE 
GOP HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY NEW MAJOR POLICY EFFORTS 
ON COUNTERTERRORISM IN 1989.  (THE GOP HAS CREATED 
THE PARAMILITARY \"SINDH FORCE\" TO HELP DEAL WITH 
LAW-AND-ORDER DIFFICULTIES IN SINDH, BUT THE 
PROBLEM IS ETHNIC COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, RATHER THAN 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY.)  THE GOP HAS ATTEMPTED ON A 
CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS ANTITERRORIST AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.  PAKISTAN 
PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S 
ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.  THREE TRAINING 
COURSES -- EACH WITH ABOUT THIRTY PAKISTANI 
PARTICIPANTS -- HAVE BEEN HELD THIS YEAR IN CRISIS 
MANAGEMENT, AIPORT SECURITY, AND DEALING WITH 
EXPLOSIVES INCIDENTS. 
 
5. GOVERNMENT RESPONSES ON TERRORISM AFFECTING 
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND FACILITIES:  THERE WERE NO 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR 
FACILITIES IN 1989.  THE ONE ATTACK, ON THE 
AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER IN ISLAMABAD ON FEBRUARY 
12, IS PROPERLY CLASSIFIED AS MOB VIOLENCE RATHER 
THAN A TERRORIST INCIDENT.  LOCAL POLICE 
SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED THE CENTER, ALTHOUGH SIX 
PEOPLE IN THE CROWD (NO AMERICANS) DIED FROM POLICE 
BULLETS AND THE BUILDING SUFFERED CONSIDERABLE 
DAMAGE.

FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE KEYED TO QUESTIONS IN PARA 
FIVE OF REFTEL. 
 
2.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS:  THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
SIGNIFICANT COURT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORIST CASES 
THIS YEAR.  TEN OF THE ELEVEN SOVIETS ARRESTED AS A 
RESULT OF THE AUGUST 19, 1990, HIJACKING OF AN 
AEROFLOT PASSENGER AIRLINER ARE INCARCERATED IN 
KARACHI AWAITING TRIAL.  (THE ELEVENTH RECENTLY 
COMMITTED SUICIDE IN PRISON.)  THREE ANO TERRORISTS 
CONVICTED OF THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING IN KARACHI 
REMAIN IN PRISON.  DURING THE RECENT ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN, THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED TO HAVE UNCOVERED A 
\"PLOT TO DESTABILIZE\" THE COUNTRY, CENTERED IN THE 
SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF SINDH, ENCOURAGED BY THE INDIAN 
EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND IMPLEMENTED BY 
INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH PAKISTAN\'S AL ZULFIKAR 
ORGANIZATION ( A TERRORIST GROUP ACTIVE IN THE EARLY 
1980S).  A NUMBER OF PAKISTANI SUSPECTS ARE IN JAIL; 
THE AUTHORITIES CLAIM TO HAVE OBTAINED INFORMATION 
THROUGH CONFESSIONS OF INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITY. 
 
3.  EXTRADITIONS:  THERE WERE NONE; THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN NEITHER EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED EXTRADITION 
OF ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
4.  SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTION OR 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS:  WE ARE NOT 
AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMIC (I.E., LEGAL, 
POLITICAL, OR PROCEDURAL) IMPEDIMENTS TO GOVERNMENT 
OF PAKISTAN EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD. 
 
5.  HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OTHER THAN 
PROSECUTION:  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS 
POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO TERRORISM AND, PUBLICLY AND 
PRIVATELY, HAS CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORIST 
VIOLENCE.  PAKISTAN HAS BEEN THE SCENE OF NUMEROUS 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS DURING 1990, PRIMARILY BOMBINGS 
ATTRIBUTED TO THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT\'S INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICE AND AFGHAN RESISTANCE GROUPS.  WHILE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN APPEARS TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT 
TO INVQGATE EACH INCIDENT FULLY, RESULTS ARE 
HAMPERED BY THE POLICE\'S RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF 
SOPHISTICATION IN FORENSIC SCIENCE AND INVESTIGATIVE 
TECHNIQUES. 
 
6.  MAJOR COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT:  PAKISTAN HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN ANY 
MAJOR STEPS OR DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES IN 1990. 
PAKISTAN PARTICIPATES IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S 
ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND ONE TRAINING 
COURSE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT WAS PROVIDED THIS YEAR TO 
EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS.  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN 
HAS ATTEMPTED ON A CONTINUING BASIS TO ENHANCE ITS 
ANTI-TERRORIST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. 
HOWEVER, THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE CENTRALIZED 
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCIES, AND THE HIGHLY POLITICIZED 
NATURE OF SENIOR LEVELS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
BUREAUCRACY, HAVE MADE INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
DIFFICULT.  SINCE THE 1986 PAN AM HIJACKING, THE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND MAINTAINED GOOD 
AIRPORT SECURITY PROCEDURES. 
 
7.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT 
FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN DOES NOT SUPPORT TERRORIST GROUPS.  INDIA 
HAS PERIODICALLY CHARGED PAKISTAN WITH SUPPORTING 
LOCAL INSURGENTS IN THE INDIAN PUNJAB AND KASHMIR, 
INCLUDING PROVIDING OR TOLERATING SANCTUARIES AND 
TRAINING CAMPS ON THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.  THE 
GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN SAYS IT GIVES MORAL SUPPORT TO 
THE KASHMIRI INSURGENTS BUT DENIES THE INDIAN 
ACCUSATIONS OF TANGIBLE AID. 
 
8.  HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT MADE ANY PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE?  THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN HAS NOT GIVEN ANY PUBLIC SUPPORT TO A 
TERRORISM-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE, IT HAS NOT OFFERED ANY SUCH 
SUPPORT PRIVATELY EITHER. 
 
9.  DESCRIBE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1989: 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INQ 
ATTITUDE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN TOWARD 
INTERNATIONAL OR DOMESTIC TERRORISM.

1. LOU- ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  ONE MONTH AGO, THE LEADING TOPIC OF POLITICAL 
DISCUSSION IN MUCH OF PAKISTAN WAS THE PRIME 
MINISTER\'S SHARIA BILL, OSTENSIBLY MEANT TO 
\"ISLAMIZE\" PAKISTANI LAWS, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY. 
DEBATE RAGED IN THE PRESS BETWEEN CRITICS FROM THE 
RELIGIOUS RIGHT, WHO ARGUED THAT THE BILL WAS TOO 
WEAK, AND LIBERALS WHO PREDICTED IT WOULD--AT A 
MINIMUM--INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND 
MINORITIES.  DAILY EDITORIALS, COLUMNS, AND 
INTERVIEWS HIGHLIGHTED THE POSITIONS OF COMPETING 
POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEADERS.  THE BILL\'S 
INTRODUCTION INTO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON MAY 12 
THREATENED TO CREATE A NEW POLITICAL LINE-UP, WITH 
THE SECULAR PDA, ANP, AND MQM ALLIED WITH THE 
ISLAMIST PARTIES AGAINST THE BILL. 
 
3.  IN CONTRAST TO POPULAR EXPECTATIONS, HOWEVER, 
THE GENERAL PREOCCUPATION WITH SHARIA DISAPPEARED 
ALMOST OVERNIGHT AFTER ITS MAY 16 PASSAGE BY THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY.  SHARIA\'S PASSAGE BY THE SENATE 
ON MAY 28 DREW LITTLE NOTICE--THE SENATE MADE NO 
CHANGES, ESSENTIALLY RUBBER-STAMPING THE NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY\'S DECISION.  AT THE TIME, BOTH THE PRESS 
AND MEMBERS OF NAWAZ\'S IJI COALITION PREDICTED 
PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ KHAN WOULD SIGN THE BILL INTO 
LAW WITHIN TWO OR THREE DAYS.  THREE WEEKS LATER, 
HOWEVER, SHARIA HAS LARGELY DISAPPEARED FROM PUBLIC 
DISCUSSION.  A SURVEY OF PAKISTAN\'S LEADING DAILIES 
FOUND NO MENTION EITHER OF PRESIDENT GHULAM ISHAQ 
KHAN\'S UNEXPLAINED DELAY IN SIGNING IT, OR OF HIS 
FINALLY SIGNING SHARIA INTO LAW ON JUNE 14.  A TRUE 
NON-EVENT. 
 
4. WE BELIEVE MOST OF THIS SUDDEN DECLINE OF 
INTEREST IS DUE TO NAWAZ\'S SUCCESS IN CREATING AN 
ACT THAT IS LONG ON RHETORIC BUT BRINGS NO IMMEDIATE 
CHANGE TO PAKISTANIS\' DAILY LIVES.  WHILE THERE WAS 
STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR LANGUAGE THAT COULD--FOR 
BETTER OR WORSE--AFFECT PAKISTANI\'S LIVING 
CONDITIONS, THE ACT WAS OF INTENSE INTEREST.  MANY 
LIBERALS, WOMEN AND MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES REMAIN 
LEARY OF THE SHARIA LEGISLATION--CITING, FOR 
EXAMPLE, ABUSES OF THE HADOOD (ISLAMIC PUNISHMENT) 
ORDINANCES UNDER GENERAL ZIA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW 
RELIGIOUSLY-MOTIVATED LEGISLATION CAN BE TWISTED TO 
FIT POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.  EVEN THEY, HOWEVER, HAVE 
ADMITTED TO US THAT THE TEXT OF THE ACT ITSELF IS 
LESS AN ISSUE THAN THE DEPARTURES THIS OR A FUTURE 
REGIME MIGHT TAKE FROM THE LETTER OF THE LAW.  (THE 
PUNATIVE ARTICLES OF THE HADOOD ORDINANCE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ENFORCED WHILE 
ACCOMPANYING PROTECTIONS GIVEN WOMEN HAVE OFTEN 
FALLEN BY THE WAYSIDE.)  CRITICS SUCH AS THE PDA\'S 
AITZAZ AHSAN ARE, IN FACT, MORE CRITICAL OF THE 
BILL\'S VAGUENESS--ALLOWING NEW INTERPRETATIONS \"AT 
WILL\"--THAN OF ANY MANDATE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE 
ACT. 
 
5.  THE AMENDMENTS INSERTED INTO THE ACT DURING THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DEBATE HAVE HELPED DEFUSE THE 
ISSUE FOR MOST PAKISTANIS.  THE ASSEMBLY UNANIMOUSLY 
APPROVED AN AMENDMENT, JOINTLY PROPOSED BY FIVE 
MINORITY REPRESENTATIVES, STATING THAT \"NOTHING 
CONTAINED HEREUNDER SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF THE 
NON-MUSLIMS GUARANTEED BY OR UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION.\"  SIMILARLY, NAWAZ READILY AGREED TO 
AN AMENDMENT STATING \"THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AS 
GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED 
(BY SHARIA).\"  A THIRD AMENDMENT, PROPOSED BY THE 
SECULAR ANP AS THE PRICE OF THEIR SUPPORT, STATES 
THAT \"NOTHING CONTAINED HERE SHALL AFFECT PAKISTAN\'S 
EXISTING PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM.\"  THE INITIAL 
THREE-YEAR DEADLINE FOR THE ABOLITION OF INTEREST 
WAS REPLACING IT WITH THE VAGUE \"SHORTEST POSSIBLE 
TIME.\"  ANOTHER AMENDMENT, DEFINING THE QURAN AND 
SUNNAH AS THE SOURCE OF PAKISTANI LAW--RATHER THAN 
THE SUM TOTAL OF LAW, IN AND OF ITSELF--ESSENTIALLY 
BLOCKS ATTEMPTS TO CHALLENGE THE CONSTITUTION OR 
LEGISLATING WITH CITATIONS DIRECTLY FROM THE QURAN. 
 
6.  COMMENT: MANY OF THE ISSUES RAISED DURING THE 
WEEKS BETWEEN NAWAZ\'S PROPOSAL OF SHARIA AND ITS 
PASSAGE BY PARLIAMENT WILL REMAIN HIGH ON PAKISTAN\'S 
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL AGENDA FOR YEARS TO COME.  IN 
FACT, THE BILL WAS ADVERTISED AS ONLY BEING A BROAD 
COMMITTMENT TO AN ISLAMIC AGENDA THAT MUST LATER BE 
FLESHED OUT BY SPECIFIC LEGISLATION DRAFTED TO 
CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BASIC LAW. WIDE 
DIFFERENCES REMAIN WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY OVER THE 
PROPER ROLE OF RELIGION IN GOVERNMENT, POLITICS AND 
SOCIETY, WITH A SMALL BUT VOCAL RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
STILL DETERMINED TO DICTATE ITS VIEWS TO SOCIETY AT 
LARGE.  SIMILARLY, A COALITION OF WOMEN\'S, MINORITY, 
AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS REMAIN HIGHLY CRITICAL OF 
THE ACT.  WHILE THEY TELL US THEY RECOGNIZE THE 
SHARIA ACT IS A FAIT ACOMPLI, THEY ARE MOBILIZING 
AGAINST FUTURE SHARIA-RELATED LEGISLATION. 
THEREFORE, WHILE THE SHARIA ACT PASSED BY THE 
PAKISTANI PARLIAMENT IN MAY 1991 DOES NOT, IN THE 
END, REPRESENT THE TYPE OF ATTACK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES 
MANY IN PAKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE FEARED, THE CONCERN 
OVER THE IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION WILL 
REMAIN.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S SHARIA 
(ISLAMIZATION) ACT, PASSED BY THE PAKISTANI NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY ONE YEAR AGO, WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE 
GROWING INFLUENCE OF ISLAMIC IDEOLOGY ON PAKISTANI 
POLITICS.  THE POORLY DRAFTED AND VAGUELY WORDED 
DOCUMENT PRODUCED NO DRAMATIC CHANGE IN PAKISTANI 
SOCIETY.  THE LAW, IN FACT, REPRESENTED A DEFEAT FOR 
THE RIGHT-WING ISLAMISTS WHO HAD PROPOSED FAR MORE 
SWEEPING ISLAMIZATION LEGISLATION.  NONETHELESS, 
ALTHOUGH THE ISLAMIC RIGHT REMAINS BUT A PERIPHERAL 
FORCE IN PAKISTANI LEGISLATIVE POLITICS, THEIR 
SINGLE-MINDED PURSUIT OF THEIR GOAL OF AN ISLAMIC 
STATE IS INCREASINGLY SHAPING CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI 
CULURE. 
 
3.  ISLAMIST ACTIVISM POSES A REAL THREAT TO 
PAKISTANI STABILITY AND PROGRESS.  BY PROMOTING 
INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI SOCIETY, THE RELIGIOUS 
RIGHT HAS WIDENED THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN RELIGIOUS 
SECTS, CONTRIBUTED TO THE SURGE IN VIOLENCE 
THROUGHOUT PAKISTAN, AND HAMPERED THE GOP\'S ABILITY 
TO SET POLICY BOTH IN DOMESTIC AREAS SUCH AS FAMILY 
PLANNING AND ON FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES LIKE 
AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR. 
 
4.  THEIR \"SUCCESSES,\" HOWEVER, SUCH AS THEY ARE, 
HAVE NOT WON THE ISLAMISTS BROAD POPULAR SUPPORT. 
WE ANTICIPATE NEITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC 
REVOLUTION IN PAKISTAN NOR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE 
ISLAMIST VICTORY AT THE POLLS.  RATHER WHAT WE ARE 
LIKELY TO SEE IS A CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN 
MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF 
PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A 
FINE LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S 
ABILITY TO USE ITS MILITANT MEMBERS TO CREATE 
PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE OF THE 
THREAT TO THE NATION\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA 
UNCHECKED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------------------------- 
WORTH THE PAPER IT\'S PRINTED ON? 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  WHEN THE PAKISTAN NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PASSED PRIME 
MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S SHARIA (\"ISLAMIC LAW\") BILL 
IN MAY 1991, THE PM\'S CONFIDANTS PRIVATELY DESCRIBED 
IT AS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY OVER THE RELIGIOUS 
RIGHT.  BY INTRODUCING HIS OWN SHARIA BILL, NAWAZ 
HAD ESSENTIALLY BOTH ACCEDED TO THE ISLAMISTS\' 
CAMPAIGN PRESSING THE GOP TO INSTITUTE ISLAMIC LAW 
AND DERAILED IT, BY WATERING THE LEGISLATION DOWN TO 
THE POINT OF MEANINGLESSNESS. 
 
6.  THE SHARA ACT ITSELF WAS POORLY DRAFTED AND 
CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF VAGUE STATEMENTS CALLING FOR 
THE TRANSFORMATION OF PAKISTAN INTO AN \"ISLAMIC 
WELFARE STATE\" AND MANDATING THAT MUSLIM CITIZENS 
\"ORDER THEIR LIVES ACCORDING TO ISLAMIC LAW.\"  THE 
ONLY GOP ACTION ACTUALLY MANDATED IN ITS TEXT WAS 
THE CREATION OF COMMITTEES TO STUDY METHODS OF 
ISLAMIZING EDUCATION AND THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF 
INTEREST FROM THE ECONOMY.  IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER 
SHARIA BILLS DRAFTED BY THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, NAWAZ\'S 
SHARIA ACT ALSO GUARANTEED THE INVIOLABILITY OF 
PAKISTAN\'S PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND INTERNATIONAL 
OBLIGATIONS AND CONTAINED LANGUAGE SAFEGUARDING THE 
RIGHTS OF PAKISTAN\'S NON-MUSLIM MINORITIES.  ONE 
YEAR AFTER THE ACT\'S PASSAGE, IT REMAINS ESSENTIALLY 
IRRELEVANT TO PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT AND SOCIETY.  THE 
FEARS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES, HUMAN RIGHTS WORKERS, 
AND WOMEN\'S GROUPS THAT THE ACT WOULD TRANSFORM 
PAKISTAN INTO A THEOCRACY, GUTTING THE ECONOMY AND 
CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE PROCESS, REMAIN ESSENTIALLY 
UNREALIZED. 
 
----------------------------------- 
ISLAMIZATION THROUGH THE BACK DOOR? 
----------------------------------- 
 
7.  MEANWHILE, THE RELIGIOUS PARTIES ARE WEAKER THAN 
EVER WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE, AND WITH THE DEFECTION 
OF THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--THE LARGEST ISLAMIST 
PARTY--FROM NAWAZ\'S RULING COALITION, THEIR ABILITY 
TO INFLUENCE GOVERNMENT POLICY IS FURTHER 
DIMINISHED.  THE ISLAMISTS\' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS 
TEACHERS AND LEADERS OF CONGREGATIONS GIVES THEM A 
READY PULPIT, HOWEVER, TO PROMOTE ISLAMIZATION AS 
THE ANSWER TO PROBLEMS OTHERWISE FAR FROM THE SPHERE 
OF RELIGION -- THE DIVISION BETWEEN RICH AND POOR, 
THE DECLINING ACCESS OF THE POOR TO EDUCATION AND 
UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION, AND THE ERODING 
LAW-AND-ORDER SITUATION. 
 
8.  THE ISLAMISTS\' STATUS AS RELIGIOUS LEADERS, AND 
THEIR ABILITY TO BRING LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITANT 
STUDENT SUPPORTERS OUT INTO THE STREETS AT SHORT 
NOTICE, HAVE LED SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS OF PAKISTAN 
TO APPEASE THEM RATHER THAN CONFRONT THEM DIRECTLY. 
UNDER PREVIOUS GOVERNMENTS, SUCH APPEASEMENT TOOK 
THE FORM OF PROHIBITION, LEGISLATION DEFINING THE 
POLYDOX AHMEDI SECT AS \"NON-MUSLIM,\" AND THE 
INSTITUTION OF ISLAMIC CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR 
EXTRAMARITAL SEX OR OTHER \"UN-ISLAMIC\" BEHAVIOR. 
DESPITE NAWAZ\'S SUCCESSFUL DERAILMENT OF THE 
MOVEMENT FOR A SHARIA BILL, THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S 
INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF PAKISTANI CULTURE 
AND SOCIETY CONTINUES TO GROW. 
 
9.  FOR EXAMPLE, PAKISTAN\'S FASTEST GROWING 
RELIGIOUS PARTIES -- THE ANJUMAN SEPAH-I-SAHABA 
PAKISTAN (ASSP) -- ACTIVELY CRUSADES FOR THE 
CREATION OF A SUNNI STATE, WITH SHIAS DECLARED 
\"NON-MUSLIM.\"  BOTH THE ASSP AND ITS PRIMARY NEMESIS 
THE SHIA TEHRIK-I-NIFAZ-I-FIQAH-JAFARIA (TNFJ) HAVE 
PROFITED BY ARTICULATING AND ENCOURAGING A GROWING 
STRAIN OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WITHIN PAKISTANI 
SOCIETY WHICH IS FAR MORE WIDESPREAD, AND DANGEROUS, 
THAN ANY THE NATION HAS PREVIOUSLY EXPERIENCED. 
 
10.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INCREASING RELIANCE BY 
OFFICIALS ON \"ISLAMIC\" PROVISIONS IN THE PAKISTANI 
PENAL CODE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE WHICH 
PENALIZES BLASPHEMY IS, IN THE VIEW OF MANY 
OBSERVERS, INCREASINGLY BEING USED TO INTIMIDATE AND 
HARRASS NON-MUSLIMS.  A PENDING CASE AGAINST 
PROMINENT SOCIOLOGIST DR. AKHTAR HAMEED KHAN (REF B) 
CHARGES HIS RECENTLY-PUBLISHED CHILDREN\'S STORY IS 
AN ALLEGORICAL SLAP AT PROPHET MOHAMMED\'S FAMILY. 
SEVERAL CHRISTIANS HAVE BEEN SIMILARLY CHARGED IN 
RECENT MONTHS, USUALLY AFTER FINANCIAL OR POLITICAL 
DISPUTES WITH ISLAMISTS.  A CHRISTIAN TEACHER WAS 
KILLED IN JANUARY 1992 BY A TEENAGER WHO HAD READ AN 
ANONYMOUS FLYER ACCUSING THE TEACHER OF INSULTING 
ISLAM.  EQUALLY TROUBLING WERE THE (FORTUNATELY 
UNSUCCESSFUL) EFFORTS OF THE SUNNI FUNDAMENTALIST 
JAMIAT ULEMA-I-ISLAM (JUI) PARTY TO PRESSURE THE 
BALOCHISTAN PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT INTO DECLARING A 
LOCAL SECT, THE ZIKRIS, TO BE NON-MUSLIM.  A 
DECISION TO THAT EFFECT COULD HAVE SPARKED SERIOUS 
SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN THAT PROVINCE. 
 
11.  CONTEMPORARY PAKISTANI TELEVISION ALSO LARGELY 
REFLECTS THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT\'S IDEA OF \"ISLAMIC\" 
BEHAVIOR AND ITS GROWING INFLUENCE.  CNN BROADCASTS 
ARE HEAVILY CENSORED WITH SCENES OF WOMEN IN 
\"UN-ISLAMIC\" DRESS OR EVEN OF MOTHERS KISSING THEIR 
CHILDREN BLANKED OUT.  GUIDELINES FOR WOMEN\'S DRESS 
IN DOMESTIC BROADCASTS WERE RECENTLY TIGHTENED, WITH 
WOMEN NOW REQUIRED TO COVER THEIR HEADS REGARDLESS 
OF THE TYPE OF CHARACTER THEY ARE PORTRAYING. 
POSITIVE PORTRAYALS OF WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL 
ROLES ARE NEARLY NONEXISTENT.  DISCUSSION OF SUCH 
ISSUES AS AIDS, BIRTH CONTROL, AND SEXUAL 
HARRASSMENT IS RARE AND GENERAL, WITH AIDS IN 
PARTICULAR OFTEN TIED TO \"WESTERN BEHAVIOR\" SUCH AS 
THE \"FREE MINGLING OF THE SEXES.\" 
 
12.  IN YET ANOTHER AREA, EDUCATION, THE GOP HAS 
REGULARLY ACCEDED TO ISLAMIST PRESSURE TO INCREASE 
THE ISLAMIC CONTENT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. 
LONG-STANDING LEGISLATION MANDATING ISLAMIC AND 
QURANIC STUDIES FOR ALL MUSLIM STUDENTS HAS 
REPEATEDLY BEEN REVISED TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE 
OF TIME DEDICATED TO \"ISLAMIA.\"  WHILE NON-MUSLIM 
STUDENTS ARE EXEMPTED FROM ISLAMIC STUDIES, ALL 
CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS--REGARDLESS OF FAITH--MUST 
PASS ORAL AND WRITTEN EXAMS ON ISLAMIC STUDIES.  THE 
WEIGHT GIVEN TO THIS SECTION WITHIN THE CIVIL 
SERVICE EXAM HAS, MOREOVER, BEEN RAISED TO THE POINT 
THAT MUSLIM CIVIL SERVICE APPLICANTS HAVE COMPLAINED 
TO US THAT ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS HAVE AN UNFAIR 
ADVANTAGE. 
 
13.  THE GOP IS ALSO UNDER GROWING ISLAMIST PRESSURE 
TO ADD RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION TO THE INFORMATION 
INCLUDED ON CITIZENS\' NATIONAL IDENTITY CARDS, WHICH 
MUST BE PRESENTED BEFORE A PAKISTANI CAN LEGALLY 
VOTE, APPLY FOR A JOB, BE ADMITTED TO UNIVERSITY, OR 
ENTER MILITARY SERVICE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
DEMOCRACY CHALLENGED: THEOCRATIC PRIMACY AHEAD? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
14.  CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE MODERNIST AND 
ISLAMIST OUTLOOKS HAS BEEN SHARPEST IN REACTION TO 
THE FEDERAL SHARIAT COURT\'S INCREASED ACTIVISM. 
GENERAL ZIA CREATED THE SHARIAT COURT IN 1980 TO 
BOLSTER HIS ISLAMIZATION CAMPAIGN, APPOINTING AND 
FIRING JUDGES AT WILL TO ENSURE FAVORABLE VERDICTS. 
SINCE ZIA\'S DEATH, HOWEVER, THE COURT HAS BEEN 
STEERING A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE GOP.  RULINGS 
SINCE JUNE 1990 INCLUDE: JUDGMENTS REPLACING CIVIL 
PENAL CODES WITH AN \"ISLAMIC\" SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENTS; 
A NOVEMBER 1991 SHARIAT COURT RULING DEFINING ALL 
INTEREST PAYMENTS AS UN-ISLAMIC; AND A MAY 1992 
RULING UNDERCUTTING THE PROTECTIONS IN THE EXISTING 
POLITICAL SYSTEM WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY FEATURE OF THE 
SHARIA ACT AND A CHECK ON ISLAMIST EFFORTS TO 
SUBORDINATE THE GOVERNMENT\'S LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY 
TO THE MULLAHS.  THE GOP REPORTEDLY HAS NO INTENTION 
OF IMPLEMENTING THESE JUDGMENTS, ALL OF WHICH REMAIN 
FROZEN IN AN APPELLATE COURT.  TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT 
HAS ALSO AVOIDED ANY ATTEMPT TO REIN IN THE SHARIAT 
COURT. 
 
15.  MOST DISTURBING TO OBSERVERS, BUT SO FAR 
UNDERPLAYED BY THE GOP, IS THE SHARIAT COURT\'S 
CHALLENGE TO PAKISTAN\'S CURRENT PARLIAMENTARY 
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.  TECHNICALLY, THE COURT IS 
CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED FROM TOUCHING CONSTITUTIONAL 
ISSUES AND COURT OFFICIALS ASSURE US THEY HAVE NO 
INTENTION TO DO SO UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY THE 
LEGISLATURE.  THE SHARIAT COURT\'S ASSERTIONS IN 
RECENT RULINGS, HOWEVER, THAT MAN-MADE DOCUMENTS OR 
HUMANLY-ELECTED PARLIAMENTS MUST BE SUBORDINATE TO 
ISLAMIC LAW--AS INTERPRETED BY THE SHARIAT COURT-- 
IMPLY JUST SUCH A WEAKENING OF THE CONSTITUTION\'S 
INVIOLABILITY.  DURING A RECENT ISLAMABAD SEMINAR ON 
ISLAMIZATION, RETIRED LAHORE HIGH COURT JUDGE JAVED 
IQBAL DEFINED THE BASIC QUESTION AS ONE OF POWER. 
\"WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE 
PEOPLE, THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OR JUDGES 
APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT?\"  IN IQBAL\'S VIEW, 
PAKISTAN NOW HAS TWO INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEMS IN 
OPERATION, ONE DEMOCRATIC AND ONE THEOCRATIC, 
NEITHER ONE OF WHICH CAN WORK UNTIL THE GOP CHOOSES 
BETWEEN THEM. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  THE PRIMARY DANGER THAT THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT 
REPRESENTS TO PAKISTAN IS THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES FUEL 
THE FRAGMENTATION OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY.  THE TIES 
THAT BIND TOGETHER PAKISTAN\'S MANY ETHNIC AND 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED TO SOME 
DEGREE.  TOGETHER WITH MILITANT ETHNIC NATIONALIST 
GROUPS, THE ISLAMIST PARTIES FURTHER SPLINTER 
SOCIETY BY FEEDING THE PERCEPTION WITHIN EACH 
COMMUNITY THAT IT IS UNDER SEIGE.  BATTLES BETWEEN 
SECTARIAN GROUPS ARE THE MOST GRAPHIC RESULT. 
EQUALLY, THE ISLAMISTS POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO 
PAKISTAN\'S LONG-TERM INTERESTS, AS FEAR OF PROVOKING 
THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT HAS CONSTRAINED THE THE GOP\'S 
ABILITY TO ADDRESS KEY ISSUES -- WHETHER DOMESTIC, 
SUCH AS EDUCATION AND BIRTH CONTROL, OR FOREIGN, 
SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN AND KASHMIR. 
 
17.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT PAKISTAN IS 
HEADED FOR EITHER AN IRANIAN-STYLE ISLAMIC 
REVOLUTION OR AN ALGERIAN-STYLE ISLAMIST VICTORY AT 
THE POLLS.  THE ISLAMIST MOVEMENT IS TOO FRAGMENTED, 
IDEOSYNCRATIC,  AND--WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
HIGHLY CENTRALIZED JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI--FAR TOO 
DISORGANIZED TO FORM A BROAD-BASED NATIONAL 
MOVEMENT.  NO GROUP HAS YET DEMONSTRATED WIDESPREAD 
PUBLIC SUPPORT AND THE POLITICO-RELIGIOUS LEADERS 
THEMSELVES ARE POPULARLY VIEWED AS POWER-HUNGRY, 
CORRUPT, AND PREOCCUPIED WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECTS 
OF ISLAM.  EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT BOOST IN NATIONAL 
ASSEMBLY SEATS IN 1990 DUE TO THE JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI\'S 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE WINNING IJI COALITION, THE 
ISLAMISTS\' SHARE OF THE POPULAR VOTE HAS DECLINED 
WITH EVERY NATIONAL ELECTION SINCE THE CREATION OF 
PAKISTAN. 
 
18.  THEIR LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT AND ELECTORAL 
STRENGTH WILL KEEP THE ISLAMISTS FROM POSING A 
DIRECT POLITICAL THREAT TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. 
THE SYMBOLIC AND EMOTIONAL VALUE OF THE \"ISLAMIC\" 
CALL, HOWEVER, AND THE COMMITMENT OF THE ISLAMISTS\' 
MORE MILITANT SUPPORTERS, MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL 
SOURCE OF TROUBLE.  IN SUM, WE ANTICIPATE A 
CONTINUING STRUGGLE BETWEEN MODERNISTS AND ISLAMISTS 
TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY IN THE 
MONTHS AHEAD.  THE GOVERNMENT MEANWHILE WALKS A FINE 
LINE, WORRIED ABOUT THE RELGIOUS RIGHT\'S ABILITY TO 
TO CREATE PROBLEMS IN THE STREETS, BUT EQUALLY AWARE 
OF THE THREAT TO THE NATION\'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT IF THE ISLAMISTS ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA 
UNCHECKED.

1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S 
PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS 
IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL. 
 
2.  A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
 
THE GOP IN 1994 ARRESTED SEVERAL DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF BOMBINGS 
OR OTHER INTERNAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  WHILE THE GOP OFTEN 
CLAIMED THAT THE INDIAN EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WAS 
BEHIND THE ATTACKS AND SOMETIMES LABELS THEM AS INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, THE GOP HAS NOT YET PROVIDED COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL LINKS.  WE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THESE INCIDENTS 
WERE CARRIED OUT BY PAKISTANI SECTARIAN ORGANIZATIONS OR 
CRIMINAL ELEMENTS. 
 
WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS ON CHARGES OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM. 
 
3.  B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
 
THE GOP SIGNED AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF 
EGYPT IN 1994.  THE TREATY WAS DIRECTED AT EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC 
MILITANTS LIVING IN THE TRIBAL AREAS OF PAKISTAN AND IN 
AFGHANISTAN WHO ARE WANTED ON CRIMINAL CHARGES IN EGYPT.  THE 
TREATY HAS NOT YET ENTERED INTO FORCE, AND THEREFORE THE GOP 
HAS NOT YET CARRIED OUT ANY EXTRADITIONS. 
 
4.  C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTION/EXTRADITION. 
 
THE \"TRIBAL AREAS\" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT 
UNDER THE COMPLETE LEGAL OR PRACTICAL AUTHORITY OF THE GOP.  IT 
IS DIFFICULT FOR GOP AUTHORITIES TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE IN THESE AREAS. 
 
ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, PROVINCIAL POLICE HAVE THE PRIMARY 
AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS.  MANY OF THESE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ARE 
NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT VIGOROUS 
ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS. 
 
PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE 
ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS. 
 
5.  D.  OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO TERRORISM 
 
THE GOP HAS COOPERATED FULLY IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF 
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING AND IN TRYING TO APPREHEND ONE 
OF THE SUSPECTED PARTICIPANTS IN THE BOMBING, RAMZI AHMED 
YOUSEF, WHO IS THOUGHT TO BE IN PAKISTAN. 
 
6.  E.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS IN 1994 
 
THE GOP, ACTING ON THE REQUEST OF SEVERAL ARAB GOVERNMENTS, 
DURING 1994 REFUSED TO EXTEND THE VISAS OF MANY ARABS WHO HAD 
FOUGHT IN THE AFGHAN WAR AND WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE IN THE TRIBAL 
AREAS AND PAKISTAN\'S NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE.  MANY OF 
THESE ARABS ARE SUSPECTED OF LINKS TO TERRORIST OR OTHER 
QUESTIONABLE ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.  THE GOP 
ALSO CLOSED DOWN SEVERAL ARAB NGO\'S IT BELIEVED MAY HAVE BEEN 
USED AS COVER ORGANIZATIONS FOR ISLAMIC MILITANT GROUPS IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 
 
7.  F.  SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND 
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU 
AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA. 
 
GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES 
DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS 
FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM IN ALL ITS FORMS AND PROVIDES NO 
TRAINING OR MATERIAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  THE GOP 
ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING TERRORIST 
ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY. 
 
8.  G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. 
 
WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1994 IN SUPPORT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORIST ACTS, OR COUNTRIES 
SPONSORING TERRORISM.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PM 
BHUTTO, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM 
AND TERRORISM IN GENERAL. 
 
THE GOP CONDEMNED THE KIDNAPPINGS IN JUNE AND OCTOBER 1994 OF 
FOREIGN TOURISTS BY REPUTED KASHMIRI MILITANTS IN INDIAN-HELD 
KASHMIR AND IN NEW DELHI. 
 
9.  H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES SINCE 1993. 
 
WE HAVE NOTED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOP\'S COOPERATION 
AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM DURING 1994. 
 
END OF ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT.

1.  REFTEL REQUESTED INFORMATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT\'S 
PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS ON INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO THE QUESTIONS 
IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL. 
 
2. A.  HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
 
IN NOVEMBER 1995, A KARACHI COURT CONVICTED 13 MEMBERS OF AN 
EXTREMIST SUNNI MUSLIM GROUP AND SENTENCED THEM TO DEATH FOR 
ATTACKS ON TWO SHIA MOSQUES IN KARACHI IN EARLY 1995.  WE ARE 
UNAWARE OF ANY PROSECUTIONS IN PAKISTAN IN 1995 ON CHARGES OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
3. B.  HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS OF TERRORISTS. 
 
THE GOP ACTED SWIFTLY AND IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE USG IN 
FEBRUARY 1995 TO EXTRADITE TO THE U.S. SUSPECTED WORLD TRADE 
CENTER BOMBER RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF.  INTERIOR MINISTER NASERULLAH 
BABAR HAS SAID PUBLICLY THAT PAKISTAN HAS EXTRADITED TEN 
SUSPECTED EGYPTIAN TERRORISTS TO EGYPT. 
 
4. C.  IMPEDIMENTS TO EXTRADITION/PROSECUTION OF TERRORISTS. 
 
THE \"TRIBAL AREAS\" OF PAKISTAN BORDERING ON AFGHANISTAN DO NOT 
FALL UNDER THE WRIT OF PAKISTANI LAW AND ARE NOT UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF THE PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT.  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
FOR THE GOP TO APPREHEND SUSPECTED TERRORISTS WHO TAKE REFUGE 
IN THESE REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREAS. 
 
ALTHOUGH FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN COOPERATIVE ON 
COUNTERTERRORISM ISSUES, MANY POLICE OFFICIALS WITH PRIMARY 
AUTHORITY FOR INVESTIGATING TERRORIST CASES AND APPREHENDING 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS ARE NEITHER WELL-TRAINED NOR 
WELL-MOTIVATED TO CONDUCT ANTI-TERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND 
OPERATIONS.  PAKISTANI COUNTERTERRORISM INVESTIGATIONS AND 
OPERATIONS ARE ALSO LIMITED DUE TO BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS. 
 
INFLUENTIAL ISLAMIC POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY OPPOSE GOP 
COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AGAINST 
TERRORISM, TERMING SUCH COOPERATION AN OPERATION AGAINST ISLAM. 
 
5. D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION. 
 
THE GOP HAS COOPERATED IN THE ONGOING USG INVESTIGATION OF THE 
MARCH 8, 1995 MURDER IN KARACHI OF TWO AMERICAN EMPLOYEES OF 
THE CONSULATE GENERAL, AND ACCEPTED U.S. ASSISTANCE IN THE 
INVEQEMBER 19, 1995, BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN 
EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD.  THE GOP GRANTED A WAIVER OF SPECIALITY 
FOR ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST RAMZI AHMAD YOUSEF 
FOR HIS ALLEGED ROLE IN PLOTS TO BLOW UP AIRCRAFT IN ASIA. 
 
6. E.  CT EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN 1995. 
 
DURING HER TRIP TO WASHINGTON IN APRIL 1995, PRIME MINISTER 
BENAZIR BHUTTO OFFERED PAKISTAN\'S FULL COOPERATION AGAINST 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  INTERIOR MINISTER BABAR HAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY REITERATED THAT PLEDGE OF COOPERATION.  DURING 
1995, GOP OFFICIALS CLAIMED THAT THE GOP CLOSED DOWN SOME 
PAKISTANI OFFICES OF KASHMIRI MILITANT GROUPS. 
 
7. F.  SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT ACCUSES THE GOP OF PROVIDING TRAINING AND 
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO MILITANTS OPERATING IN INDIAN-HELD JAMMU 
AND KASHMIR AND ELSEWHERE IN INDIA. 
 
GOP OFFICIALS HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT, WHILE THE GOP PROVIDES 
DIPLOMATIC, POLITICAL, AND MORAL SUPPORT FOR KASHMIR, IT IS 
FIRMLY AGAINST TERRORISM AND PROVIDES NO TRAINING OR MATERIAL 
SUPPORT FOR KASHMIRI MILITANTS.  HOWEVER, ANTI-INDIAN MILITANT 
GROUPS OPERATE FREELY IN PAKISTAN AND ARE PERMITTED TO RAISE 
FUNDS AND RECRUIT NEW CADRE.  THIS POLICY CREATES FERTILE 
GROUND FOR THE OPERATIONS OF OTHER MILITANT AND TERRORIST 
GROUPS IN PAKISTAN. 
 
THE GOP ALSO ACCUSES THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA OF SUPPORTING 
TERRORIST ACTS ON PAKISTANI TERRITORY, PARTICULARLY IN KARACHI. 
 
8. G.  PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM. 
 
WE ARE UNAWARE OF ANY GOP STATEMENTS DURING 1995 IN SUPPORT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OR TERRORIST ACTS.  SEVERAL HIGH GOP 
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO AND 
PRESIDENT FAROOQ LEGHARI, DURING THE YEAR CONDEMNED TERRORISM 
IN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ACTS OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE MURDER 
OF TWO U.S. CONSULATE GENERAL EMPLOYEES IN KARACHI, THE 
KIDNAPPING OF FOREIGN TOURISTS IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR AND THE 
MURDER OF ONE HOSTAGE, THE ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME 
MINISTER RABIN, THE BOMBING OF THE OPM/SANG OFFICE IN RIYADH, 
AND THE BOMBING OF THE EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN ISLAMABAD. 
 
9. H.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1994. 
 
THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN GOP COUNTERTERRORISM 
POLICY IN 1995, ALTHOUGH GOP OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED AN 
INCREASED WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE BROWN AMENDMENT, IF/WHEN 
SIGNED INTO LAW, WILL PERMIT EXPANDED U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM 
ASSISTANCE TO PAKISTAN AND MAKE COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION 
EASIER.

TAGS:  PGOV, PTER, PINR, PK, IZ, LY, SA, IR 
SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN, ISLAMIC TERROR AND HUA 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY THOMAS W. SIMONS, JR., AMBASSADOR. 
REASON:  1.5 (B), (C) AND (D). 
 
2.  (S) DURING THE COURSE OF FRANK WISNER\'S AND MY LUNCHEON 
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ON JULY 12, SHE NOTED THAT SHE WAS 
PICKING UP DISTURBING INTELLIGENCE OF THE EXISTENCE OF 
RELIGIOUS MADRASSAS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING YOUTH 
TRAINING CAMPS WHICH COULD BE SPAWNING TERRORISM.  THE MOST 
RECENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT INSTITUTIONS OF THIS NATURE ARE 
FUNDED FROM SAUDI ARABIA.  SHE ASSUMES THAT THERE IS PRIVATE 
SAUDI FINANCE INVOLVED, BUT SHE HAS DIRECTED THAT THE SAUDI 
GOVERNMENT BE APPROACHED. 
 
3.  (S) IN THIS CONTEXT SHE EXPRESSED ONCE AGAIN HER SYMPATHY 
FOR THE KILLING OF THE 19 AMERICANS IN SAUDI ARABIA AND ASKED 
THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH HER IN IDENTIFYING ANY LINES WHICH 
CONNECT WHAT IS GOING ON IN PAKISTAN TO OTHER TERRORIST 
OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  I UNDERTOOK TO DO SO AND ASKED 
THAT THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SHARE WITH US WHATEVER INFORMATION 
IS AVAILABLE TO PAKISTAN. 
 
4.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER CONTINUED, NOTING THAT THE PROBLEM 
WAS NOT A NEW ONE.  THE IRANIANS, LIBYANS AND IRAQIS HAD IN THE 
PAST FUNDED SIMILAR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.  THE GENERAL 
PROBLEM AS WELL AS INTERNAL SECURITY PROBLEMS HAD BEEN 
DISCUSSED AT A RECENT CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND ORDER WHICH 
SHE HAD CHAIRED.  THE POLITICAL CONTEXT WAS WHAT SHE SAW AS A 
FAIRLY ELABORATE AND WELL ARTICULATED PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THIS PLOT INVOLVES QASI HUSSEIN AHMED, AMIR OF THE 
JAMIAT-I-ISLAMI, BUT ONE OF THE GUIDING FORCES WAS FORMER ISI 
DIRECTOR HAMID GUL.  THE MECHANISM ENVISAGED WAS TO BEGIN WITH 
OPPOSITION TO THE BUDGET AND CONSTRUCT AN EVER-BROADENING 
POLITICAL MOVEMENT WITH DEMANDS FOR A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT 
WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.  ELEMENTS WOULD BE THE 
DEMAND FOR A NEW CENSUS, DEMAND FOR A NATIONAL IDENTITY CARD, 
AND INVOCATION OF ARTICLE 62 OF THE CONSTITUTION WHICH LIMITS 
CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO THOSE DEFINED AS GOOD MUSLIMS.  THE 
INTENTION WOULD BE TO LIMIT THE DEFINITION OF A GOOD MUSLIM 
ONLY TO GRADUATES OF MADRASSAS OR ISLAMIC UNIVERSITIES.  THE 
PRIME MINISTER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN WAS CATCHING 
ON.  AS SHE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE CABINET MEETING ON LAW AND 
ORDER, HOWEVER, THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BE SIMPLY THE PASSIVE 
OBJECT OF SUCH A CAMPAIGN BUT WAS OBLIGED TO REACT AND BE 
ACTIVE IN ITS OWN DEFENSE AND IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY. 
 
5.  (S) THE PRIME MINISTER\'S STATEMENT GAVE US AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO TURN TO THE VEXING ISSUE OF THE HUA.  I BEGAN BY THANKING 
HER FOR HER VERY FIRM COMMENTS IN HER MEETING WITH THE SPOUSES 
OF THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  I RECALLED IN PARTICULAR HER REQUEST 
THAT WE BRING TO HER ATTENTION ANY SOLID INFORMATION THAT WE 
HAVE SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE THE SUSPECTS BROUGHT IN AND STRONGLY 
INTERROGATED.  IN FACT, SHE INTERJECTED, SHE HAD ASKED MINISTER 
OF THE INTERIOR NASEERULLAH KHAN BABAR TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE 
FBI ON THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE KASHMIR HOSTAGES.  PAKISTAN 
ITSELF, AFTER THE MOST THOROUGH REVIEW BY ALL AGENCIES OF THE 
GOVERNMENT -- INTELLIGENCE, ARMY AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES -- HAD 
BEEN UNABLE TO DISCOVER CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE HARAKAT UL 
ANSAR PEOPLE THAT THEY KNEW AND THE HOSTAGE TAKERS.  AT THE 
SAME TIME SHE RECOGNIZED THAT ALL OUTSIDE INTERLOCUTORS WERE 
CONVINCED THAT THERE IS SUCH A CONNECTION.  THE BRITISH HAD 
MADE THIS CLEAR TO THEM AND SHE ASSUMED THAT THE AMERICANS HAD 
THE SAME VIEW. 
 
6.  (S) FRANK WISNER ASSURED HER THAT THAT IS THE CASE, 
OUTLINING BRIEFLY THE EVIDENCE THAT WE HAVE IN HAND ABOUT HUA 
COMPLICITY IN SEVERAL KIDNAPPING EVENTS IN INDIA, INCLUDING THE 
KASHMIR HOSTAGE INCIDENT.  THE PRIME MINISTER SAID SHE COULD 
NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT OF HUA 
MIGHT BE INVOLVED, RECALLING THAT A BREAKAWAY ELEMENT HAD BEEN 
INVOLVED IN THE ARMY PLOT OF SEPTEMBER 1995.  SHE ASKED THE 
FOREIGN SECRETARY TO CONTACT THE MILITARY AND ASK IF ANY OF THE 
HUA PLOTTERS IN THE ARMY COUP WERE AWARE OF PLANS TO TAKE 
HOSTAGES IN KASHMIR. 
 
7.  (S) WISNER AND I AGREED THAT THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL.  I 
ASKED THE PRIME MINISTER TO DELAY TAKING ACTION WITH BABAR 
ABOUT THE FBI UNTIL JOHN HOLZMAN OR I HAD A CHANCE TO BRING TO 
HER ATTENTION INFORMATION WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED ON 
THE HOSTAGE CRISIS.

1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR TOM PRICE. 
REASON: 1.5 (D). 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C) MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE TALIBAN\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN 
AFFAIR\'S ADVISER, TOLD POLOFF AND AARMA THAT VARIOUS 
OPTIONS ARE BEING REVIEWED FOR THE TALIBAN\'S ATTACK ON 
SOROBI.  ACCORDING TO JALIL, RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE 
\"WARM,\" BUT IRAN IS TRYING TO STIR UP TROUBLE.  JALIL 
ASSERTED THAT FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME IN 
KANDAHAR.  HE WARNED THE UN SPECIAL MISSION THAT IT 
SHOULD NOT SET UP ITS MAIN OFFICE IN KABUL.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
OPTIONS FOR SOROBI 
------------------ 
 
3.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA MET WITH MULLAH ABDUL JALIL, THE 
TALIBAN\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN AFFAIR\'S ADVISER, AND COMMANDER 
HAJI BASHIR, A MEMBER OF THE TALIBAN\'S GREATER SHURA, ON 
SEPTEMBER 18.  MULLAH JALIL BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY 
STATING THAT THE TALIBAN ARE CONSIDERING VARIOUS OPTIONS 
ON HOW TO ATTACK SOROBI.  SOROBI IS NOW UNDER SIEGE FROM 
THE EAST AND THE SOUTH, HE CONTINUED, AND WILL BE UNDER 
SIEGE FROM THE WEST SOON.  HOWEVER, THE TALIBAN ARE 
CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE KABUL REGIME HAS 
FORTIFIED THE SOROBI AREA HEAVILY WITH TANKS AND 
ARTILLERY, HE SAID.  THUS, THE TALIBAN ARE TAKING THEIR 
TIME TO DECIDE ON THEIR BATTLE PLANS.  JALIL NOTED THAT 
THE KEY TALIBAN DECISION-MAKERS WHO WILL DECIDE NEXT 
STEPS ARE MILITARY COMMANDER BORJAN, AND POLITICAL 
LEADERS MULLAH MOHAMMED RABBANI AND MULLAH ABDUL RAZAK. 
 
4.  (C) HAJI BASHIR, WHO HAD RECENTLY RETURNED FROM 
JALALABAD, SAID THAT THE TALIBAN HAD SEIZED AN IMMENSE 
AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES IN THEIR 
TAKEOVER OF NANGARHAR PROVINCE.  HE CLAIMED THAT THE 
TALIBAN HAD CAPTURED OVER 150 TANKS AND ARMORED PERSONNEL 
CARRIERS.  ACCORDING TO HAJI BASHIR, THE SEIZURE OF THESE 
ITEMS, AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF AMMUNITION, MEANT THAT 
TALIBAN SUPPLY LINES HAD BEEN SHORTENED, AND THEY DID NOT 
NOW HAVE TO SEND FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES FROM 
KANDAHAR.  HE ADDED THAT JALALABAD AIRPORT IS IN GOOD 
CONDITION; AN AN-32 FROM KANDAHAR ARRIVED THERE ON 
SEPTEMBER 17.  (NOTE:  AS REPORTED SEPTEL, JALIL AND HAJI 
BASHIR ALSO SAID TERRORIST TRAINING BASES IN PAKTIA 
PROVINCE HAD BEEN CAPTURED, ALTHOUGH THE \"ARAB\" OCCUPANTS 
OF THE CAMPS HAD FLED.  THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE 
WHEREABOUTS OF SAUDI FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.  END NOTE.) 
 
----------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM WARM... 
----------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS THAT GENERAL 
DOSTAM PLANS TO SEND 2,000 SOLDIERS TO KABUL TO DEFEND IT 
AGAINST THE TALIBAN (REF B), JALIL WAS DISMISSIVE, AND 
EMPHATIC THAT RELATIONS WITH DOSTAM ARE \"WARM.\"  HE SAID 
HE DOUBTED THAT DOSTAM WOULD EVER ENTER INTO ANY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH COMMANDER MASOOD, WHOM HE DOES NOT 
TRUST.  JALIL ALLOWED THAT THE TALIBAN WERE CLOSELY 
SCRUTINIZING DOSTAM\'S ACTIVITIES, BUT WERE CONVINCED AS 
OF THIS POINT THAT HE HAD NO DESIRE TO TAKE ANY 
\"AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS\" AGAINST THE TALIBAN. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
BUT THE IRANIANS ARE STIRRING UP TROUBLE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) HOWEVER, JALIL EVINCED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE 
IRANIANS WERE TRYING TO PUSH DOSTAM TOWARD AN 
ANTI-TALIBAN ALLIANCE WITH THE KABUL REGIME.  EXPANDING 
ON THIS POINT, JALIL SAID THE TALIBAN KNEW THAT IRANIAN 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER ALLAHUDDIN BORUJERDI IS CURRENTLY 
IN MAZAR-I-SHARIF ADVOCATING SUCH AN INITIATIVE (REF A). 
HE DOUBTED THAT THE IRANIANS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS 
ENDEAVOUR, BUT THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD KEEP TRYING. 
 
7.  (C) HAJI BASHIR RELATED THAT THE TALIBAN HAVE HAD 
BORDER FLARE-UPS WITH THE IRANIANS IN THE LAST MONTH. 
TWICE, HE ASSERTED, IRANIAN SOLDIERS HAVE ENTERED AFGHAN 
TERRITORY AND PROCEEDED TO THE AFGHAN BORDER TOWN OF 
ISLAM QALA, WHERE THEY ENCOUNTERED TALIBAN RESISTANCE. 
IN ONE INCIDENT, HE RECOUNTED, SIX UNIFORMED IRANIAN 
SOLDIERS WERE CAPTURED WITHIN THE BORDERS OF 
AFGHANISTAN.  HAJI BASHIR SAID THE IRANIANS WERE LATER 
RELEASED WHEN THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED TO PREVENT 
SUCH INCIDENTS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. 
NONETHELESS, JALIL NOTED, TEHERAN RADIO\'S PASHTU AND DARI 
SERVICES CONTINUED TO PRESS AN ANTI-TALIBAN MESSAGE, 
WHICH INCLUDED ALLEGATIONS THAT THE TALIBAN ARE WORKING 
FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 
 
------------------------- 
ZAHIR SHAH IS NOT WELCOME 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) JALIL SAID THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT TAKE THE 
SEPTEMBER 12 STATEMENT OF FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH THAT HE 
WAS WILLING TO RETURN TO AFGHANISTAN VERY SERIOUSLY.  FOR 
ONE THING, HE SAID THE FORMER KING IS JUST TOO OLD.  IN 
ADDITION, NONE OF THE FACTIONS REALLY SUPPORTED THE 
FORMER KING, ALTHOUGH SOME--LIKE DOSTAM--CLAIMED THAT 
THEY DID.  THE BASIC POINT, JALIL CONTINUED, IS THAT AS 
FAR AS THE TALIBAN ARE CONCERNED THEY ALREADY HAVE A 
LEADER, AMIR MOHAMMED OMAR, AND DO NOT NEED ANOTHER ONE. 
 
------------------------------- 
UN SPECIAL MISSION SEEN AS WEAK 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) JALIL WAS ALSO DISMISSIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UN 
SPECIAL MISSION ON AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA).  HE SAID THE NEW 
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE, DR, NORBERT HOLL, \"KEPT PROMISING 
SOLUTIONS TO THE AFGHAN CONFLICT BUT FAILED TO PRODUCE 
ANYTHING.\"  JALIL WAS ADAMANT THAT THE TALIBAN \"WANT TO 
WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS,\" BUT SAID THEY SUSPECT THE 
UN IS \"PRO-KABUL\" AND ANTI-TALIBAN.  JALIL INVITED UNSMA 
TO SET UP SHOP IN JALALABAD AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, NOTING 
THAT THE SITUATION WAS \"SAFE\" THERE.  HE WARNED UNSMA IN 
THE STRONGEST TERMS NOT TO SET UP ITS AFGHAN HEADQUARTERS 
IN KABUL IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN \"A SPIRIT OF 
COOPERATION\" WITH THE TALIBAN.  POLOFF AND AARMA TOLD 
JALIL THAT IT WAS IN THE TALIBAN\'S OWN BEST INTEREST TO 
ENGAGE UNSMA IN A \"COOPERATIVE SPIRIT\" SINCE IT WAS 
WORKING FOR PEACE IN AFGHANISTAN.  (COMMENT:  RECENTLY 
STEPHEN EVANS (PROTECT), ONE OF DR. HOLL\'S ADVISERS, 
OPINED TO POLOFF THAT KABUL WOULD BE THE ONLY LOGICAL 
PLACE FOR UNSMA TO SET UP SHOP--\"JALALABAD IS NO LONGER 
NEUTRAL, SO ONLY THE CAPITAL REMAINS.\"  END COMMENT.) 
 
-------------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES 
-------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) JALIL CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY STATING THAT THE 
TALIBAN HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR THE UNITED STATES BASED ON 
ITS ASSISTANCE TO THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE DURING THE WAR 
AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  HE ADDED THAT THE TWO ALSO SHARED A 
COMMON INTEREST IN HALTING IRANIAN \"AGGRESSION,\" AND HE 
URGED USG SUPPORT FOR THE TALIBAN NOW THAT THEY CONTROL 
TWO-THIRDS OF AFGHANISTAN.  POLOFF RESPONDED THAT THE USG 
DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY OF THE FACTIONS, BUT RATHER SUPPORTS 
THE FORMATION OF A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THIS 
SPIRIT, THE USG WANTS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE TALIBAN 
WHENEVER POSSIBLE, POLOFF NOTED. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) JALIL PROVIDED NO HINT THAT THE TALIBAN INTEND 
TO WORK CLOSELY WITH UNSMA IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN 
ADDITION, JALIL APPEARED QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE TALIBAN 
WOULD REJECT THE FORMER KING\'S OFFER TO RETURN TO 
AFGHANISTAN.  THIS LEAVES ONLY A CONTINUATION OF WAR--AT 
LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM, AND JALIL PROVIDED EVERY SIGNAL 
THAT THE TALIBAN ARE AIMING FOR A MILITARY SOLUTION TO 
THE AFGHAN CONFLICT. 
 
12.  (C) IN THE WAKE OF THE TALIBAN\'S MILITARY SUCCESSES, 
JALIL\'S REMARKS ALSO INDICATE GROWING TENSION BETWEEN 
KANDAHAR AND TEHRAN.  IF THE TALIBAN CARRY THEIR 
OFFENSIVE CLOSER TO KABUL, THIS TENSION COULD GROW.

PAKTIA PROVINCE.  HE NOTED THAT THE \"ARAB\" OCCUPANTS OF

OF OSAMA BIN LADEN.  SEPTEMBER 19 PRESS REPORTS STATE 
THAT 107 \"PAKISTANIS\" RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING IN THE 
KHOST AREA OF AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AFTER

3.  (C) IN A MEETING WITH POLOFF AND AARMA ON SEPTEMBER

AFFAIR\'S ADVISER, SAID THE TALIBAN CAPTURED TRAINING 
CAMPS RUN BY THE HEKMATYAR AND SAYYAF FACTIONS DURING

4.  (C) JALIL CLAIMED THAT ALL OF THE \"ARABS\" BEING 
TRAINED IN THESE CAMPS HAVE FLED TO AREAS CONTROLLED BY

KNOW, BUT HE WAS NOT IN AREAS CONTROLLED BY THE TALIBAN. 
 
5.  (C) POLOFF AND AARMA URGED JALIL TO ENSURE THAT THE 
TALIBAN TAKES MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT THESE CAMPS ARE NOT 
REACTIVATED AND THAT NO FORM OF \"SAFE HAVEN\" IS EXTENDED 
TO TERRORISTS.  IN ADDITION, POLOFF AND AARMA EMPHASIZED 
THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE TALIBAN PUT OUT THE WORD 
THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN\'S PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT 
WANTED.  JALIL REPLIED THAT THE TALIBAN DID NOT SUPPORT

OSAMA BIN LADEN.

\"AS MANY AS 107 PAKISTANIS WHO WERE RECEIVING MILITARY 
TRAINING AT TWO CAMPS IN AFGHANISTAN\'S KHOST PROVINCE 
WERE CAUGHT ON THE PAKISTAN-AFGHAN BORDER WHILE RETURNING 
HOME AFTER THE SEIZURE OF THEIR CAMPS BY THE TALIBAN.\" 
ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, THE GOP BORDER FORCES TOOK 
THOSE ARRESTED TO DERA ISMAIL KHAN PRISON IN NORTH 
WAZIRSTAN AGENCY. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT:  JALIL MADE ALL THE RIGHT SOUNDS 
CONCERNING TERRORISM, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE 
COUNTERTERRORISM POINTS HOME IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE 
TALIBAN.  WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION OF THE 
PAKISTANI PRESS REPORTS CITED IN PARA FIVE, BUT INTERIOR 
MINISTER BABAR TOLD THE DCM ON SEPTEMBER 12 THAT HE HAD 
ISSUED AN ORDER TO GOP BORDER FORCES TO ARREST TERRORISTS 
IF THEY TRIED TO ENTER PAKISTAN (REFTEL).

3.  (C) ABDUL BAQI, AN AFGHAN BUSINESSMAN WITH CLOSE 
TIES TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF AND THE ASSISTANT ARMY 
ATTACHE (AARMA) ON OCTOBER 11 THAT FUGITIVE SAUDI 
FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD \"UNDER TALIBAN

TALIBAN SOURCE IN JALALABAD \"TEN DAYS AGO\" WHO HAD 
\"PERSONALLY\" SEEN BIN LADEN.  BAQI ADDED THAT BIN LADEN 
IS BEING \"SHELTERED\" IN COMMANDER YUNIS KHALIS\' COMPOUND 
IN JALALABAD.  KHALIS IS ALSO PROVIDING SHELTER TO A 
NUMBER OF OTHER \"ARABS,\" ACCORDING TO BAQI.  ASKED IF HE

7.  (C) COMMENT:  WE CANNOT VERIFY BAQI\'S ASSERTION THAT 
BIN LADEN IS IN JALALABAD.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS POSSIBLE

MULLAH OMAR MET WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN IN KANDAHAR 
ON MARCH 25 AND TOLD HIM NOT TO USE \"AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- 
SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.\"  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, A GOOD CONTACT AT 
THE AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, CONFIRMED THESE REPORTS AND NOTED THAT 
OMAR\'S COMMENTS DID NOT REPRESENT A SHIFT IN TALIBAN POLICY TOWARD 
BIN LADEN, BUT WERE A \"WARNING.\"  SAUDI EMBASSY POLOFF HAMZA GASSAS 
TOLD POLOFF THAT OMAR\'S COMMENTS COULD MEAN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE 
BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT BIN LADEN\'S ACTIVITIES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OMAR MEETS BIN LADEN 
--------------------/ 
 
3.  (U) PAKISTANI NEWSPAPERS REPORTED ON MARCH 27 THAT MULLAH OMAR, 
THE TALIBAN LEADER, MET WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN, EX-SAUDI FINANCIER 
AND SUPPORTER OF RADICAL ISLAMIC CAUSES, IN KANDAHAR ON MARCH 25 TO 
INFORM HIM OF \"THE CONCERN OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT ABOUT HIS 
ACTIVITIES\" IN AFGHANISTAN.  ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES, OMAR THEN 
TOLD BIN LADEN THAT HE SHOULD NOT USE \"AFGHAN TERRITORY FOR ANTI- 
SAUDI GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES.\"   HE ALSO REPORTEDLY TOLD BIN LADEN 
THAT IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT U.S. FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW FROM 
SAUDI ARABIA BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED THERE.  ONE OF THE 
ARTICLES GOES ON TO NOTE THAT THE TALIBAN DELEGATION TO THE MARCH 
23 OIC SUMMIT IN ISLAMABAD HAD MET WITH THE SAUDI DELEGATION AND 
BEEN INFORMED OF SAUDI CONCERNS ABOUT BIN LADEN. 
 
EMBOFF SAYS TALIBAN HAVE NOT CHANGED POLICY ON BIN LADEN 
--------------------------------------------- -----------/ 
 
4.  (C) ON MARCH 27, POLOFF MET WITH TAYYAB HUSSAINI, SECOND 
SECRETARY AT THE TALIBAN-CONTROLLED AFGHAN EMBASSY HERE, AND ASKED 
HIM TO COMMENT ON THE ARTICLES.  HUSSAINI, WHO SAID HE HAD SPOKEN 
TO TALIBAN OFFICIALS IN KANDAHAR EARLIER IN THE DAY, CONFIRMED THAT 
THE ARTICLES ARE ACCURATE:  \"MULLAH OMAR SUMMONED BIN LADEN FROM 
JALALABAD AND REQUESTED A MEETING WITH HIM IN KANDAHAR BECAUSE HE 
IS CONCERNED THAT BIN LADEN IS BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE IN HIS 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS.\"  HUSSAINI DID NOT DIVULGE WHAT BIN LADEN HAD 
SAID THAT HAD AROUSED TALIBAN CONCERN.  (NOTE:  BIN LADEN HAS GIVEN 
A NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS IN RECENT WEEKS IN WHICH HE ATTACKED SAUDI 
ARABIA AND THE U.S.)  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI WHETHER THE TALIBAN 
DELEGATION HAD MET WITH SAUDI REPRESENTATIVES AT THE RECENT OIC 
SUMMIT.  HUSSAINI REPLIED THAT MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE 
TALIBAN DELEGATION AND CHIEF OF THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL\" IN KABUL, 
HAD MET WITH A SAUDI OFFICIAL NAMED \"NAYIF,\" BUT DENIED THAT THE 
QUESTION OF BIN LADEN HAD BEEN RAISED.  (NOTE:  WE DO NOT KNOW 
WHETHER HUSSAINI WAS REFERRING TO NAYIF SAUD, THE SAUDI MINISTER OF 
INTERIOR;  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM LOCALLY WHETHER NAYIF 
SAUD WAS A MEMBER THE SAUDI DELEGATION.) 
 
5.  (C) HUSSAINI ALSO TOLD US THAT NOT TOO MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO 
OMAR\'S REMARKS; \"THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT ANY SHIFT IN POLICY BY THE 
TALIBAN.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER HIM (BIN LADEN) SHELTER, BUT HE 
MUST ABIDE BY OUR RULES.\"  (NOTE:  THE TALIBAN HAVE TOLD EMBOFFS ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT BIN LADEN CAN STAY IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT 
SHOULD NOT ENGAGE IN \"TERRORIST ACTIVITIES\" WHILE THERE.)  HUSSAINI 
ADDED THAT BIN LADEN SHOULD CONSIDER OMAR\'S COMMENTS A \"WARNING.\" 
 
MEETING WITH SAUDI DIPLOMAT 
---------------------------/ 
 
6.  (C) IN A MARCH 27 MEETING WITH POLOFF, HAMZA GASSAS, A 
POLITICAL OFFICER AT THE SAUDI ARABIAN EMBASSY, STATED THAT HE IS 
\"UNSURE OF WHAT TO MAKE OF OMAR\'S COMMENTS.\"  SOME OF THE PRESS 
ARTICLES INDICATED THAT THE TALIBAN ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED 
ABOUT BIN LADEN, WHICH WOULD BE POSITIVE, HE CONTINUED.  HOWEVER, 
OMAR\'S COMMENTS THAT U.S. TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE STATIONED IN SAUDI 
ARABIA WERE OF CONCERN, HE RELATED.  QUERIED WHETHER A TALIBAN 
DELEGATION HAD IN FACT MET WITH SAG REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MARGINS 
OF THE OIC SUMMIT, GASSAS RESPONDED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW, BUT DID 
NOT THINK THAT THEY HAD MET WITH CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH, WHO HEADED 
THE SAUDI DELEGATION.  GASSAS SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER NAYIF 
SAUD WAS A MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION, AND CONCLUDED BY PROMISING TO 
LOOK INTO THE ISSUE FURTHER. 
 
COMMENT 
-------/ 
 
7.  (C) BASED ON HUSSAINI\'S COMMENTS AND THE PRESS REPORTS, IT 
APPEARS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT BIN LADEN\'S RECENT 
ACTIVITIES AND THE REACTION THEY ARE PROVOKING FROM THE SAUDIS 
AND/OR THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, IT IS FAR FROM CERTAIN 
THAT THE TALIBAN ARE FEELING THE HEAT ON THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY FROM 
THE SAUDIS, AS SOME OF THE PRESS STORIES HERE SUGGEST.  WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO PROBE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEARN WHO SAID WHAT TO WHOM ON 
THIS ISSUE.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
3.  (C) NOT MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT MULLAH OMAR, THE TALIBAN FOUNDER 
AND LEADER.  HE COMES FROM A SMALL VILLAGE NEAR KANDAHAR AND HIS 
FAMILY, WHILE RESPECTED, DID NOT BELONG TO THE AFGHAN ELITE.  A 
SMALL-TIME COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE, HE FORMED THE 
TALIBAN IN LATE 1994 AS A REACTION AGAINST \"IMMORAL\" LOCAL 
COMMANDERS.  HE RARELY APPEARS IN PUBLIC AND DOES NOT MEET WITH 
MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  THOSE WHO HAVE MET HIM SAY HE IS A MAN OF FEW 
WORDS AND LIVES IN SPARTAN SURROUNDINGS.   ALTHOUGH HIS POLITICAL 
BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE, MOST OBSERVERS AGREE THAT OMAR PLAYS THE KEY, 
AND PROBABLY DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------- 
NOT MUCH BIO-DATA 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C) SHORTLY AFTER THE TALIBAN SEIZED KABUL IN SEPTEMBER 1996, 
THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT ANNOUNCED THAT MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR, THE 
TALIBAN FOUNDER AND LEADER, WOULD SERVE AS THE HEAD OF THEIR 
\"ISLAMIC STATE OF AFGHANISTAN.\"  IN THIS CAPACITY, HIS TITLE 
REMAINS \"AMIR AL-MU\'MININ\" (\"COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL\"), WHICH A 
TALIBAN-CONVENED GROUP OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONFERRED ON HIM IN 
APRIL 1996 IN KANDAHAR CITY.  OMAR, WHO IS APPROXIMATELY 38, IS 
FROM THE MAIWAND DISTRICT OF KANDAHAR PROVINCE AND IS A MEMBER OF 
THE HOTAK SUB-TRIBE OF THE GHILZAI TRIBE (REF C).  OMAR WAS A 
RELATIVELY UNKNOWN COMMANDER IN THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR, WHO 
MAINTAINED AFFILIATIONS WITH HEZB-I-ISLAMI (KHALIS) AND HARAKAT-I- 
INQILAB-ISLAMI (MOHAMMEDI).  HE LOST HIS RIGHT EYE IN THE WAR. 
AFTER THE FALL OF THE COMMUNIST REGIME IN 1992, OMAR, WHO 
REPORTEDLY HAS TWO WIVES, RETURNED TO A MADRASSA, WHICH HE HAD 
ATTENDED IN HIS YOUTH, IN HIS HOME VILLAGE OF SANGASAR, NEAR 
KANDAHAR CITY.  IT WAS FROM THIS VILLAGE THAT MULLAH OMAR AND 
FELLOW TALIBS, ANGERED ABOUT THE \"IMMORAL BEHAVIOR\" OF LOCAL 
COMMANDERS, BEGAN THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT IN THE FALL OF 1994. 
 
5.  (C) ASKED ABOUT OMAR\'S BACKGROUND, HAMID KARZAI, THE DEPUTY 
LEADER OF THE LARGE POPALZAI TRIBE, TOLD POLOFF MARCH 22 THAT OMAR 
CAME FROM A FAMILY LOCALLY RESPECTED FOR ITS RELIGIOUS PIETY, BUT 
NOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS:  \"OMAR\'S FATHER WAS A LOCAL RELIGIOUS 
LEADER, BUT THE FAMILY WAS POOR AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO POLITICAL 
LINKS IN KANDAHAR OR KABUL.  THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY LOWER MIDDLE 
CLASS AFGHANS AND WERE DEFINITELY NOT MEMBERS OF THE ELITE.\" 
AGREEING WITH KARZAI\'S ASSESSMENT, HAMED GAILANI, SON OF PIR 
GAILANI AND A LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT OF 
AFGHANISTAN (NIFA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 23 THAT \"OMAR IS ADMIRED BY 
THE TALIBAN FOR THREE REASONS:  HIS RELIGIOUS PIETY, HIS REPUTATION 
FOR INCORRUPTIBILITY, AND HIS BRAVERY IN THE JIHAD.  BECAUSE OF 
THESE QUALITIES, HE IS CONSIDERED LIKE A TEACHER, A GUIDE.\" 
 
---------------------- 
FEW PUBLIC APPEARANCES 
---------------------- 
 
6.  (C) MULLAH MOHAMMAD OMAR IS RARELY SEEN IN PUBLIC.  ONE OF THE 
FEW TIMES HE HAS MADE A PUBLIC APPEARANCE WAS IN APRIL, 1996, WHEN 
HE ACCEPTED THE AMIR AL-MU\'MININ TITLE AND HELD THE \"CLOAK OF THE 
PROPHET\" (A KANDAHARI RELIC) IN FRONT OF A CROWD.  HE ALSO 
PERSONALLY INAUGURATED A TALIBAN-SPONSORED REFURBISHMENT OF THE 
MAUSOLEUM OF AHMAD SHAH DURRANI IN KANDAHAR.  WHETHER HE CHOOSES TO 
REMAIN SHROUDED IN SECRECY OR IS A GENUINE RECLUSE IS NOT CLEAR, 
BUT MULLAH MALANG, A FORMER RESISTANCE COMMANDER WHO KNOWS MANY OF 
THE TALIBAN LEADERS, TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 26 THAT MULLAH OMAR HAS 
NO DESIRE TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC PERSONALITY:  \"WHAT YOU MUST REALIZE 
IS THAT OMAR IS TOTALLY INNER-DIRECTED.  HIS LEGITIMACY COMES FROM 
GOD AND NOT FROM THE PUBLIC; BECAUSE OF THIS, HE FEELS NO NEED TO 
EMERGE FROM HIS CHAMBERS. IN ADDITION, HE DOES NOT WANT TO MEET 
ANYONE WHO MAY DIVERT HIM FROM HIS CHOSEN COURSE.\" 
 
-------------------------------- 
A RELUCTANCE TO MEET NON-MUSLIMS 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C) MALANG\'S REMARKS HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO 
GET TO KNOW MULLAH OMAR:  HE DOES NOT MEET MANY NON-MUSLIMS.  TO 
OUR KNOWLEDGE, HE HAS MET WITH NON-MUSLIMS ONLY TWO TIMES:  HE MET 
UNICEF AFGHAN REPRESENTATIVE JIM MOHAN IN 1996 FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 
MINUTES, AND AGAIN IN 1996 HE MET (BRIEFLY) WITH A RUSSIAN 
DELEGATION SEEKING THE RELEASE OF MEMBERS OF A RUSSIAN AIRCREW 
WHICH WAS CAPTURED AND DETAINED BY THE TALIBAN FROM 1995 TO 1996. 
FRANCIS OKELO, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE UN SPECIAL MISSION FOR 
AFGHANISTAN (UNSMA), TOLD POLOFF MARCH 21 THAT UN SPECIAL ENVOY 
HOLL (A NON-MUSLIM GERMAN) HAS REQUESTED MEETINGS WITH OMAR ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND BEEN TURNED DOWN EVERY TIME.  ASKED WHETHER 
THE UNSMA HAD EVER RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION FROM THE TALIBAN, OKELO 
REPLIED THAT \"THEY BASICALLY TELL US THAT HE IS ALWAYS BUSY AND 
INTIMATE THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE TO MEET WITH NON-MUSLIMS.\"  IN 
ADDITION, UNOCHA COORDINATOR ALFREDO WITSCHI-CESTARI (A NON-MUSLIM) 
RECENTLY EXPRESSED OPTIMISM TO THE DCM THAT HIS REQUEST TO MEET 
WITH OMAR IN KANDAHAR TO EXPLAIN UN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE/ 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD BE GRANTED.  (COMMENT:  THIS REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN.) 
 
------------------ 
A MAN OF FEW WORDS 
------------------ 
 
8.  (C) THOSE WHO HAVE MET MULLAH OMAR REMARK THAT HE IS A MAN OF 
DECIDEDLY FEW WORDS, AND ONE WHO KEEPS TO SIMPLE SURROUNDINGS.  ON 
MARCH 21, IBRAHIM BAKR, THE OIC SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN, TOLD 
DCM THAT HE HAD MET OMAR ON MARCH 15 TO REQUEST LENIENCE FOR TWO 
JAILED FRENCHMEN HELD IN KABUL BY THE TALIBAN ON VAGUE CHARGES OF 
IMMORALITY.  (NOTE:  AFTER A BRIEF TRIAL, THE FRENCHMEN WERE 
RELEASED ON MARCH 19.)  BAKR DESCRIBED THE MEETING:  \"I EXPLAINED 
WHY I THOUGHT THE FRENCHMEN SHOULD BE RELEASED AND AT THE END OF MY 
COMMENTS MULLAH OMAR SAID \'THANK YOU.  WE WILL CONSIDER THAT.\'\" 
BAKR ADDED THAT OMAR\'S OFFICE (WHICH APPARENTLY DOUBLED AS HIS 
BEDROOM) WAS SPARSE AND DIMLY LIT.  THE ONLY FURNITURE WAS A 
CHARPOY (SIMPLE WOODEN BED) AND A WARDROBE.  GUESTS SAT ON THE 
FLOOR, LOOKING UP AT OMAR, WHO SAT ON THE CHARPOY.  ANOTHER PERSON 
WHO MET OMAR, IFTIKHAR MURSHED, ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (AFGHANISTAN) 
AT THE PAKISTANI MFA, TOLD US DECEMBER 15 THAT, DURING A DECEMBER 
8 DELEGATION VISIT TO KANDAHAR, A PAKISTANI DELEGATION MET OMAR AND 
IN THAT MEETING \"THE PAKISTANIS SPOKE FOR THE FIRST 85 MINUTES AND 
OMAR FOR THE LAST FIVE.\"   IN THIS MEETING (REF B), MURSHED 
RECOUNTED THAT THE GIST OF OMAR\'S COMMENTS WERE, \"I AM VERY GLAD 
YOU HAVE COME; I HAVE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY.\"  (NOTE:  MURSHED 
HAS ALSO TOLD DCM THAT THE PAKISTANI CONSUL GENERAL IN KANDAHAR HAS 
EASY ACCESS TO OMAR.\")  IN DESCRIBING HIS MEETING WITH OMAR, UNICEF 
REPRESENTATIVE MOHAN SAID HE DID ALL THE SPEAKING AND RECEIVED 
LITTLE REACTION FROM OMAR. 
 
----------------------------- 
POLITICAL BELIEFS ARE OBSCURE 
----------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) THE LIMITED ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE PROVIDES LITTLE 
INFORMATION ON MULLAH OMAR\'S PERSONAL POLITICAL BELIEFS.  MOST 
OBSERVERS DO NOT THINK THAT HE IS AN \"IKHWANI\" OR \"FUNDAMENTALIST 
MUSLIM\" IN THE CLASSIC MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SENSE.  IN A MARCH 20 
CONVERSATION, DR. GHAIRAT BAHEER, THE ISLAMABAD REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
HEZB-I-ISLAMI AND SON-IN-LAW OF ISLAMIC RADICAL GULBUDDIN 
HEKMATYAR, COMMENTED THAT \"OMAR IS TOO POORLY EDUCATED IN ISLAMIC 
PRINCIPLES TO BE AN IKHWANI; HE IS BASICALLY A FERVENT MUSLIM WITH 
OBSCURANTIST TENDENCIES WHOSE VIEWS ARE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY HIS 
TRIBAL BACKGROUND.\"  INDEED, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST 
THAT MULLAH OMAR IS AN ISLAMIC RADICAL WITH AN ANTI-WESTERN AGENDA. 
HE HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE ANTI-WESTERN STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH HE 
IS KNOWN TO BE ANTI-RUSSIAN BECAUSE OF THE AFGHAN-SOVIET WAR. 
HOWEVER, WE RECENTLY HEARD ONE COMMENT THAT INDICATES THAT OMAR MAY 
HAVE SOME ANTAGONISM TOWARD THE WEST:  ABDUL HADI, THE TALIBAN 
DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF ZABUL PROVINCE AND THEIR (SELF-DESCRIBED) CHOICE 
FOR GOVERNOR OF WARDAK PROVINCE, TOLD DCM ON MARCH 17 THAT HE HAD 
ATTENDED A MEETING MARCH 1 IN WHICH OMAR HAD DEFENDED THE TALIBAN\'S 
RELATIONSHIP WITH FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN -- \"OMAR TOLD 
US THAT WE HAVE TO HELP BIN LADEN BECAUSE HE IS A GOOD, ISLAMIC 
PERSON, WHO IS FIGHTING THE KAFFIRS (UNBELIEVERS).\"  (NOTE:  SEE 
REF A ON A MARCH 25 MEETING BETWEEN OMAR AND FUGITIVE EX-SAUDI 
FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING:  OMAR AND THE SHURA 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OMAR HAS A KEY, AND PROBABLY 
DECISIVE, ROLE IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  THEY NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
THAT VIRUALLY EVERY IMPORTANT TALIBAN EDICT ON SOCIAL ISSUES OR THE 
MILITARY SITUATION COMES OUT IN HIS NAME.  IN ADDITION, HE 
REPORTEDLY MAKES HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  TAYYAB HUSSAINI, 
A SECOND SECRETARY AT THE AFGHAN EMBASSY AND A TALIB, TOLD POLOFF 
ON MARCH 14 THAT \"THE AMIR AL-MU\'MININ HAS TOTAL CONTROL OF 
PERSONNEL DECISIONS.  OF COURSE, HE MAKES THESE DECISIONS IN 
CONSULTATION WITH OTHER SHURA MEMBERS.\"  POLOFF ASKED HUSSAINI 
ABOUT THE PRECISE NATURE OF OMAR\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MEMBERS OF THE 
SHURA.  IN RESPONSE, HUSSAINI OBSERVED THAT POLICY DECISIONS ARE 
MADE IN KANDAHAR AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE \"CARETAKER COUNCIL\" IN 
KABUL, WHICH GIVES ORDERS TO TALIBAN PROVINCIAL CHIEFS.  SOMEWHAT 
CONFUSINGLY, HE THEN ADDED THAT BEFORE MAKING DECISIONS OMAR 
CONSULTS CLOSELY WITH MULLAH RABBANI, THE HEAD OF THE \"CARETAKER 
COUNCIL\" AND MULLAH HASSAN, THE DEPUTY HEAD OF THE \"CARETAKER 
COUNCIL.\"  (FORMER COMMANDER RAHIM WARDAK, IN A RECENT CONVERSATION 
WITH THE DCM, ALSO INDICATED THAT OMAR CONSULTS WIDELY AMONG SENIOR 
TALIBAN OFFICIALS; HOWEVER, AFTER HEARING VARIOUS VIEWPOINTS, OMAR 
SOMETIMES COMES UP WITH A DECISION COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF 
THE EXPRESSED VIEWS AND THEN EXPECTS IMPLEMENTATION.  BASED ON 
WARDAK\'S COMMENTS, ONE COULD CONCLUDE THAT OMAR WAS A BIT OF A 
\"CONTROL FREAK.\")  HIROSHI TAKAHASHI, AN UNSMA POLITICAL OFFICER, 
TOLD POLOFF ON MARCH 5 THAT HE THOUGHT THAT TWO OTHER KEY ADVISERS 
FOR OMAR ARE ANOTHER MULLAH HASSAN, THE GOVERNOR OF KANDAHAR AND 
FOUR NEIGHBORING PROVINCES, AND MULLAH JALIL, A TALIBAN \"DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER,\" WHO IS STATIONED IN KANDAHAR. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) WHILE REPORTS VARY OF HOW WILLING OR RELUCTANT MULLAH OMAR 
WAS TO ACCEPT THE TITLE \"AMIR AL-MU\'MININ\" FROM THE ASSEMBLED 
TALIBAN IN KANDAHAR IN APRIL 1996, NEVERTHELESS HE DID ACCEPT IT. 
CREATED EARLY IN ISLAMIC HISTORY AND FIRST USED BY THE SECOND OF 
THE ORTHODOX CALIPHS, OMAR, THE TITLE HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY A SERIES 
OF MUSLIM POLITIES UP TO THE PRESENT DAY.  IN THE SUNNI ISLAMIC 
WORLD, THE ADOPTION OF THE TITLE IMPLIED THE CLAIM EITHER TO THE 
CALIPHATE OR TO AUTONOMOUS POLITICAL AUTHORITY OVER A REGION OF THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD.  NOT EVEN THE MOST IDEOLOGICAL TALIBAN CLAIM THAT 
OMAR WITH HIS TITLE IS A SUCCESSOR TO THE CALIPHATE, MOST RECENTLY 
HELD IN OTTOMAN TURKEY.  BUT, IN THE SECOND SENSE, THE TALIBAN ARE 
MOST CERTAINLY CLAIMING AUTHORITY OVER THE AFGHAN REGION OF THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD.  OMAR BUTTRESSED THIS CLAIM BY DISPLAYING \"THE CLOAK 
OF THE PROPHET\" WHEN HE ASSUMED THE TITLE OF AMIR AL-MU\'MININ. 
ALSO, IN MORE RECENT HISTORY, THE TITLE HAS HAD A STRONG 
IDEOLOGICAL RESONANCE AMONG SOME REFORMIST, MESSIANIC, AND MILITANT 
ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS, RESPONDING TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE CORRUPT 
AND IRRELIGIOUS WAYS OF THE EXISTING RULERS.  BESIDES THE TALIBAN, 
SOME OTHER ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON AFGHAN SOIL HAVE USED THIS TITLE. 
FOR EXAMPLE, A WAHHABI SECT WITH STRONG ARAB BACKING, MOST ACTIVE 
IN KUNAR PROVINCE, UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY CALLED ITS LEADER \"AMIR 
AL-MU\'MININ.\" 
 
12.  (C) IN CONTRAST TO MANY OF THE HOLDERS OF THE TITLE IN 
CLASSICAL ISLAM OR TO MANY OF THE LAWLESS COMMANDERS THE TALIBAN 
OUSTED OR COOPTED, OMAR LIVES AUSTERELY, WITHOUT AN ELABORATE COURT 
AND ENTOURAGE, AND WITHOUT THE UBIQUITOUS PAJERO\'S SO MANY 
MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS SPED AROUND THE COUNTRYSIDE IN.  WHETHER 
OMAR\'S ASCETIC LIFESTYLE IS BASED SOLELY ON HIS TEMPERAMENT OR IS 
COLDLY CALCULATED TO SET HIM AND HIS MOVEMENT APART FROM THE 
DISCREDITED MUJAHIDIN COMMANDERS AND LEADERS THE TALIBAN REPLACED, 
MANY AFGHANS REACT APPROVINGLY.  SO FAR, NO PERSONALITY CULT OR 
EMPEROR SYNDROME APPEARS TO HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND MULLAH OMAR. 
 
13.  (C) OMAR, AS REPORTING IN OTHER CHANNELS SUGGESTS, MAY BE 
ADOPTING INCREASINGLY HARDLINE ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE WEST AND 
ISSUES ABOUT WHICH THE U.S. IS CONCERNED (NARCOTICS, TERRORISM). 
WHAT IS MOTIVATING THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS:  GENUINE 
IDEOLOGICAL CONVICTIONS, A GROWING RESENTMENT THAT THE WEST HAS NOT 
ACCEPTED THE TALIBAN AS A LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT, A BAZAAR 
BARGAINING ATTITUDE, FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SQUEEZES ON THE 
TALIBAN, OUTSIDERS\' ADVICE, OR SOME OTHER FACTOR COULD ALL PLAY A 
ROLE. 
 
14.  (C) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE EMBASSY HAS ASKED WHETHER A 
MEETING WITH OMAR MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, BUT NOTHING HAS EVER COME OF 
IT.  THIS IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT U.S. VIEWS 
GET THROUGH TO OMAR ACCURATELY, GIVEN HIS KEY ROLE IN THE TALIBAN 
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  AT THIS POINT, BASED ON THE TALIBAN\'S 
HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD AND DETERMINATION TO END THE CONFLICT BY 
MILITARY MEANS, IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF HE IS HEARING OUR MESSAGE 
FROM OTHER HIGH-LEVEL TALIBAN AND FROM U.S. PUBLIC STATEMENTS, HE 
IS NOT LISTENING TO IT.

GAINING THE UPPER HAND IN THE TALIBAN.  THEY PICTURE THE \"RADICALS\" 
AS BEING STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE TALIBAN\'S POLICY OF OFFERING SAFE 
HAVEN TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER BIN LADEN.  THEY ADDED THAT SOME 
OF THE \"RADICALS,\" INCLUDING \"JUSTICE MINISTER\" TURABI AND HIGH-

CLOSE TO MULLAH MANSOUR, A STRONGLY ISLAMIST RESISTANCE LEADER, WHO 
WAS ASSASSINATED IN 1992.  END SUMMARY. 
 
\"RADICALS\" SEEN AS GAINING THE UPPER HAND 
-----------------------------------------/ 
 
3.  (C) IN AN APRIL 12 CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF, HAMED GAILANI, 
THE DEPUTY LEADER OF THE SMALL NATIONAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENT OF 
AFGHANISTAN, SAID HE HAD HEARD REPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF \"RADICALS\" 
HAVE GAINED THE UPPER HAND IN TALIBAN DECISION-MAKING.  IN A 
SEPARATE APRIL 14 CONVERSATION, MULLAH MALANG, A COMMANDER IN THE 
AFGHAN RESISTANCE WITH CLOSE LINKS TO THE TALIBAN, TOLD POLOFF THAT 
HE HAD ALSO NOTED A \"MORE EXTREME EDGE\" TO THE TALIBAN, ESPECIALLY 
IN THE PAST MONTH.  BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG LISTED THE FOLLOWING 
TALIBAN LEADERS AS \"RADICALS\" WITH INCREASED IMPORTANCE IN THE 
MOVEMENT: 
 
-- MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ADVISER TO TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR. 
-- MULLAH TURABI, THE \"JUSTICE MINISTER.\" 
-- MULLAH MUTAQI, THE \"INFORMATION MINISTER.\" 
-- MULLAH JALIL, THE \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER\" IN KANDAHAR. 
-- SHER MOHAMMAD STANEKZAI, THE \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER\" IN KABUL. 
-- MULLAH SIDDIQI, THE \"ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE.\"  (NOTE:  SEE REF B 
FOR RECORD OF POLOFF\'S RECENT MEETING WITH SIDDIQI, IN KABUL.) 
 
STRONG PRO-BIN LADEN VIEWS 
--------------------------/ 
 
4.  (C) MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT ALL OF THESE TALIBAN OFFICIALS ARE 
STRONGLY COMMITTED TO THE TALIBAN\'S POLICY OF PROVIDING SAFE HAVEN 
AND PROTECTION TO FUGITIVE SAUDI FINANCIER USAMA BIN LADEN.  IN 
PARTICULAR, HE NOTED, TURABI, WAKIL AHMED AND MUTAQI HAVE BEEN 
IDENTIFIED WITH THE PRO-BIN LADEN WING OF THE TALIBAN.  ON THE 
OTHER HAND, MALANG CONTINUED, ALTHOUGH MULLAH RABBANI, THE TALIBAN 
\"CHIEF OF THE CARETAKER COUNCIL,\" AND MULLAH GHAUS, THE TALIBAN 
\"FOREIGN MINISTER,\" ARE NOT AGAINST OFFERING HAVEN TO BIN LADEN, 
THEY HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL 
RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE TALIBAN OF BEING IDENTIFIED WITH BIN LADEN\'S 
ANTI-SAUDI AND ANTI-AMERICAN POLICIES.  HOWEVER, MALANG ADDED, 
RABBANI AND GHAUS HAVE \"LOST THE ARGUMENT\" AND THE TALIBAN HAVE NO 
PLANS TO ADJUST THEIR POLICY ON BIN LADEN. 
 
5.  (C) ASKED WHY BIN LADEN IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE \"RADICALS,\" 
MALANG REPLIED THAT HE WAS NOT CERTAIN, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE 
RADICALS SEE BIN LADEN AS A \"LEARNED MUSLIM,\" WHO CAN QUOTE FROM 
THE KORAN AND HADITHS (SAYINGS OF THE PROPHET).  IN ADDITION, THEY 
FEEL HE IS OWED RESPECT BECAUSE HE HELPED THE AFGHAN RESISTANCE 
DURING THE WAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS.  FINALLY, MALANG OBSERVED, THE 
\"RADICALS\" ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDS THAT BIN LADEN PROVIDES 
THE TALIBAN. 
 
THE \"MANSOUR\" GROUP 
-------------------/ 
 
6.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ASSERTED THAT MOST OF THE TALIBAN 
\"RADICALS\" WERE AFFILIATED WITH AN AFGHAN RESISTANCE PARTY LED BY 
NASRULLAH MANSOUR.  GAILANI TOLD POLOFF THAT MANSOUR WAS ORIGINALLY 
THE DEPUTY TO MOHAMMED NABI MOHAMMEDI, THE LEADER OF HARAKAT-I- 
INQILAB-I-ISLAMI (HII), BUT LEFT THE PARTY TO FORM A BREAKAWAY 
FACTION IN 1981.  THE ISSUE THAT LED TO THE HII SPLIT, ACCORDING TO 
GAILANI, WAS NABI\'S BELIEF THAT MANSOUR HAD GROWN \"TOO 
INTERNATIONALIST\" IN HIS ISLAMIC BELIEFS.  HE NOTED THAT MANSOUR 
WAS ASSASSINATED BY UNITS LOYAL TO HEZB-I-ISLAMI (HEKMATYAR) IN 
1992, AND ADDED THAT WAKIL AHMED, TURABI, AND SIDDIQI, IN 
PARTICULAR, ARE CONSIDERED \"PROTEGES OF MANSOUR.\" 
 
\"MANSOURIS\" SEEN AS LESS ANTI-IRANIAN\" 
--------------------------------------/ 
 
7.  (C) NOTING THAT MANSOUR SPENT A NUMBER OF YEARS IN IRAN IN THE 
1980S, MALANG TOLD POLOFF THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED 
\"MANSOURIS\" (AS SUPPORTERS OF MANSOUR ARE KNOWN) ARE CONSIDERED TO 
BE LESS ANTI-IRANIAN THAN OTHER TALIBAN.  EXPANDING ON THIS POINT, 
HE EXPLAINED THAT SINCE \"MANSOURIS\" ARE MORE ISLAMIST IN 
ORIENTATION AND LESS NATIONALISTIC, THEY DO NOT HOLD THE STRONG 
ANTI-IRANIAN BELIEFS COMMON TO OTHER AFGHANS, ESPECIALLY THOSE 
PASHTUNS FROM WESTERN PROVINCES LIKE KANDAHAR, HELMAND, URUZGAN, 
AND FARAH.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE PRO-IRANIAN, HE CONCLUDED, 
BUT SIMPLY THAT \"MANSOURIS\" ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK TO THE 
IRANIANS. 
 
A TALIBAN \"REFORM COMMISSION\" 
-----------------------------/ 
 
8.  (C) NEITHER GAILANI NOR MALANG BELIEVED THAT THE TREND TOWARD 
WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AS THE \"RADICALIZATION\" OF THE TALIBAN WOULD EBB 
IN THE NEAR-TERM.  BOTH NOTED THAT THAT THEY HAD HEARD THAT MULLAH 
TURABI WAS NAMED THE HEAD OF A \"REFORM COMMISSION\" BY TALIBAN 
LEADER MULLAH OMAR IN MARCH.  FROM THIS POSITION, MALANG COMMENTED, 
IT IS BELIEVED THAT MULLAH TURABI NOW MAINTAINS A GREAT DEAL OF 
INFLUENCE ON PERSONNEL DECISIONS AND DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION.  IN 
ADDITION, SINCE IT WAS REPORTED THAT TURABI WAS CHOSEN FOR THE POST 
PERSONALLY BY MULLAH OMAR, IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE IS NOW, ALONG 
WITH MULLAH WAKIL AHMED, ONE OF OMAR\'S CLOSEST ADVISERS, HE STATED. 
 
COMMENT 
-------/ 
 
9.  (C) BOTH GAILANI AND MALANG ARE KNOWLEGEABLE CONTACTS ON 
AFGHANISTAN; MALANG, IN PARTICULAR, APPEARS TO KNOW A LOT ABOUT 
TALIBAN PERSONALITIES AND DECISION-MAKING.  THEIR ASSERTION THAT 
\"RADICALS\" IN THE TALIBAN HAVE BEEN GAINING INFLUENCE HAS BEEN 
REPEATED BY OTHER OBSERVERS, INCLUDING GENERAL PAYENDA, DOSTAM\'S 
REPRESENTATIVE IN PAKISTAN (REF A).  BIN LADEN\'S ASSOCIATION WITH 
THE PURPORTEDLY ASCENDANT \"RADICALS\" IS POTENTIALLY OF GREAT 
CONCERN, ESPECIALLY IF IT MEANS THAT BIN LADEN IS ABLE TO EXPAND 
HIS INFLUENCE ON THE TALIBAN.

1.  (S)  EMBASSY IS WORKING ON GATHERING MORE INFORMATION ON THE 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL, BUT 
OFFERS THE FOLLOWING INITIAL READOUT TO ASSIST ANALYSTS.  ACCORDING 
TO MUSHTAQ WANI -- ALL PARTIES HURRIYAT CONFERENCE MEMBER AND 
KASHMIRI MILITANT LEADER -- THE JKIF WAS FORMED WHEN THE PRO- 
PAKISTAN IKHEWAN-UL-MUSLIMEEN GROUP SPLIT APART IN 1995.  WANI SAID 
THAT THE GROUP IS SMALL -- \"LESS THAN 100 MEMBERS\" -- BUT THAT IT 
IS QUITE ACTIVE IN INDIA.  TWO OF ITS MORE PROMINENT MEMBERS 
RECENTLY WERE ARRESTED IN NEPAL AND INDIA FOR POSSESSION OF THE 
EXPLOSIVE RDX, WANI SAID.  ASKED IF THE WORD \"ISLAMIC\" IN JKIF 
MEANT THE GROUP WAS ESPECIALLY RELIGIOUS, WANI REPLIED NO.  WANI 
SAID MOST OF THE MEMBERS WERE \"UNEDUCATED MEN\" WHO CAME FROM 
KASHMIR. 
 
2.  (S)  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS GLEANED FROM A 1996 REPORT 
HANDED TO POLOFF BY FIRST SECRETARY ROWAN LAXON (PROTECT) AT THE UK 
HIGH COMMISSION IN ISLAMABAD.  ANALYSTS MAY ALREADY HAVE THIS 
PARTICULAR REPORT, BUT WE OFFER IT HERE FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH: 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
\" ACCORDING TO A J&K GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN, HILAL AHMED BEG, 
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE J&K ISLAMIC FRONT, WAS KILLED IN AN 
ENCOUNTER WITH J&K POLICE IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF SRINAGAR AROUND 
MIDNIGHT ON 16/17 JULY 1996.  BEG IS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED 
IN A NUMBER OF SERIOUS TERRORIST ACTS COMMITTED AT THE START OF THE 
MILITANCY IN KASHMIR, INCLUDING THE MURDER OF THE VICE CHANCELLOR 
OF KASHMIR UNIVERSITY.  HIS DEATH FOLLOWS THAT OF SAJJAD KENU, THE 
FOUNDER OF THE JKIF, AND COULD LEAD TO THE DEMISE OF THE 
ORGANIZATION AS A SERIOUS FORCE IN THE MILITANCY.\"  END TEXT.

WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE A COPY OF THE POSTER, NOR DID THEY SEE ANY 
OTHER ANTI-US PROPAGANDA ON DISPLAY ON CAMPUS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO

CLASSIFIED BY POLCOUNS TOM PRICE.  REASON:  1.5 (C). 
 
1.  (S)  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL (A) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR ISLAMIC FRONT (JKIF), POLOFF, ACCOMPANIED BY POL 
FSN, VISITED THE JKIF\'S ISLAMABAD OFFICE ON SEPTEMBER 4.  MAKING AN 
APPOINTMENT TO MEET WITH THE JKIF WAS SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL, BUT 
POL FSN FINALLY MANAGED TO TRACK DOWN AN ISLAMABAD PHONE NUMBER 
(445699) FOR THE GROUP.  WHEN HE CALLED THE OFFICE, THE PERSON WHO 
ANSWERED REPEATEDLY ASKED IF THE CALL WAS BEING TAPED.  \"IF SO, I 
WILL SPEAK MORE CLEARLY,\" HE SAID, EVEN AFTER BEING ASSURED THAT 
THE CONVERSATION WAS NOT BEING MONITORED. 
 
2.  (S)  FINDING THE JKIF OFFICE WAS ALMOST AS DIFFICULT AS MAKING 
AN APPOINTMENT.  LOCATED IN THE CAPITAL CITY\'S WESTERNMOST SUBURBS, 
THE GROUP\'S HOUSE IS TUCKED INTO A NARROW ALLEY IN THE I/10-2 
SECTOR (STREET 10, GALI (ALLEY) 27, HOUSE 1908).  POLOFFS WERE 
USHERED INTO THE HOUSE BY DR. HAIDER, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS 
VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF.  HE IN TURN INTRODUCED BILAL BAIG, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JKIF, AND SYED ALI RAZA, WHOM HAIDER DESCRIBED AS 
THE PRESIDENT OF JKIF\'S POLITICAL WING IN MUZAFFARABAD.  HAIDER, 
WHO HAILS FROM BARAMULLA DISTRICT OF INDIAN KASHMIR AND SAYS HE HAS 
A MEDICAL DEGREE, DID MOST OF THE TALKING DURING THE NEXT HOUR-AND- 
A-HALF, THOUGH RAZA DID SPEAK UP OCCASIONALLY, AND BAIG APPEARED TO 
BE FOLLOWING THE CONVERSATION CLOSELY. 
 
3.  (S)  HAIDER NEEDED LITTLE PROMPTING TO LAUNCH INTO A CONVOLUTED 
EXPLANATION OF THE GROUP\'S HISTORY AND ITS PHILOSOPHY, MOST OF 
WHICH IS COVERED MORE COMPREHENSIBLY IN REFTELS B AND C.  HAIDER 
SAID THE GROUP BEGAN AS A PEACEFUL ORGANIZATION CALLED THE JAMMU 
AND KASHMIR STUDENTS\' LIBERATION FRONT IN 1988 AND GRADUALLY 
METAMORPHOSED INTO THE JKIF OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL 
YEARS.  HAIDER SAID HIS OWN CONVERSION TO VIOLENCE TOOK PLACE IN 
APRIL 1992, WHEN HE WAS DETAINED AND TORTURED BY INDIAN TROOPS IN 
SRINAGAR.  ROLLING UP HIS PANTS LEG TO REVEAL SEVERAL UGLY GOUGES 
IN HIS SKIN, HAIDER SAID HE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO ELECTRIC SHOCKS 
AND SEVERE BEATINGS WHILE IN CUSTODY.  SINCE THEN, HAIDER SAID, HIS 
ELDER BROTHER HAD BEEN KILLED AND HIS FAMILY HOME DESTROYED BY 
INDIAN TROOPS, WHILE HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE TO PAKISTAN IN 
1994.  \"HE TOO HAS SUFFERED,\" HAIDER SAID POINTING TO BAIG, WHO WAS 
SITTING IMPASSIVELY ACROSS THE ROOM.  BAIG\'S SISTER-IN-LAW AND 
FATHER WERE KILLED BY INDIAN TROOPS, HAIDER CHARGED, AND HIS 
SISTER, FARADA BAHANJI, HAS BEEN IMPRISONED IN NEW DELHI\'S TIHAR 
JAIL FOR OVER A YEAR BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER\'S ACTIVITIES.  TO CAP 
OFF THIS LITANY OF ABUSE, HAIDER PRODUCED SEVERAL PHOTOS OF 
CORPSES, ALL OF WHOM ALLEGEDLY DIED AT THE HANDS OF INDIAN SECURITY 
FORCES.  ONE PHOTO PURPORTEDLY SHOWED THE REMAINS OF BAIG\'S FAMILY 
HOME WITH A SNAPSHOT OF HIS SISTER SUPERIMPOSED ON IT. 
 
4.  (S)  WHEN PRESSED TO ELABORATE ON THE GROUP\'S POLITICAL 
PHILOSOPHY, HAIDER DEFERRED TO RAZA, A YOUNG, THIN MAN WITH A FULL 
BEARD AND TURBAN.  RAZA SAID THE JKIF HAD ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO 
FORMULATE A POLITICAL AGENDA AND THE FOCUS WAS STILL ON ARMED 
RESISTANCE TO INDIAN OCCUPATION OF KASHMIR.  THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE 
JKIF IS KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE, HE COMMENTED, BUT AFTER INDIAN 
TROOPS VACATE KASHMIR, THE GROUP WOULD THEN BE AMENABLE TO 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UN RESOLUTIONS, EVEN IF THAT MEANT A VOTE TO 
JOIN INDIA.  THE JKIF IS PRIMARILY A NATIONALIST MOVEMENT, RAZA 
CONTINUED, AND DOES NOT ESPOUSE A PARTICULARLY RADICAL BRAND OF 
ISLAM, DESPITE ITS NAME.  AT THIS POINT, HAIDER JUMPED IN AND ENDED 
THIS SEGMENT OF THE CONVERSATION BY EMBARKING ON A LONG, RAMBLING 
DISCOURSE ABOUT THE COMMON ROOTS OF JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, 
WHILE TAKING PAINS TO MENTION THAT THE JKIF WAS NOT AGAINST 
\"ORDINARY HINDUS.\" 
 
5.  (S)  TURNING TO THE GROUP\'S MILITARY OPERATIONS, HAIDER SAID 
THE JKIF\'S PRIMARY TARGETS ARE INDIAN REGULAR AND PARAMILITARY 
FORCES IN KASHMIR, THOUGH HE ADDED THAT \"THOSE WHO COMPROMISE\" WITH 
THE INDIANS WERE ALSO KILLED.  ASKED WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED 
\"COMPROMISERS,\" HAIDER LISTED BUREAUCRATS AND POLITICIANS IN THE 
JAMMU AND KASHMIR GOVERNMENT AS THE MAIN CULPRITS, BUT STATED THAT 
ANYONE WHO \"BECOMES A HINDRANCE\" WAS ALSO A POTENTIAL TARGET, 
INCLUDING MUSLIM COLLABORATORS.  HAIDER BECAME QUITE AGITATED WHEN 
DISCUSSING THOSE WHOM THE JKIF CONSIDERED ENEMIES, REPEATEDLY 
BARING HIS CHEST WHILE STATING THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID TO DIE FOR 
KASHMIRI INDEPENDENCE.  \"I WOULD KILL THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IF 
I COULD,\" HE ASSERTED.  A FAVORITE METHOD OF ATTACKING INDIAN 
TROOPS IS SUICIDE BOMBINGS, HAIDER ASSERTED, \"JUST LIKE HAMAS IN 
ISRAEL.\"  RDX IS THE EXPLOSIVE OF CHOICE, HE EXPLAINED, AND ATTACKS 
ARE CAREFULLY PLANNED AFTER TARGETS ARE CASED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 
HAIDER WAS EVASIVE WHEN ASKED ABOUT BOMBINGS OF NON-MILITARY 
TARGETS, BUT HE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THAT THE JKIF WAS A TERRORIST 
GROUP. 
 
6.  (S)  HAIDER ESTIMATED THE JKIF\'S STRENGTH AT BETWEEN 500 AND 
1,000 MILITANTS, DOWN CONSIDERABLY FROM THEIR PEAK IN 1992, WHEN 
THE GROUP BOASTED 4,000 FIGHTERS.  THE INDIANS HAVE KILLED MORE 
THAN 2,000 JKIF FIGHTERS SINCE THEN, HAIDER ADMITTED, BUT HE SAID 
THE GROUP STILL FIELDED THE SECOND-LARGEST MILITANT FORCE IN 
KASHMIR AFTER THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN (NOTE:  ALMOST EVERY KASHMIRI 
MILITANT GROUP CLAIMS TO HAVE THE SECOND-LARGEST NUMBER OF FIGHTERS 
IN INDIAN KASHMIR, BUT ALL AGREE THAT THE HIZBUL MUJAHEDDIN IS 
NUMBER ONE).  ROUGHLY 200 FIGHTERS ARE IN AZAD KASHMIR AT ANY GIVEN 
TIME, WHILE THE REST ARE OPERATING INSIDE INDIAN KASHMIR.  TRAINING 
TAKES PLACE IN CAMPS IN AZAD KASHMIR, HAIDER EXPLAINED, BUT HE 
DENIED THAT THE GROUP RECEIVED ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE PAKISTANI 
ARMY.  ALL OF THE JKIF\'S FIGHTERS ARE KASHMIRIS, EITHER FROM AZAD 
OR INDIAN KASHMIR, HAIDER CLAIMED, THOUGH HE CONCEDED THAT \"ONE OR 
TWO\" AFGHANS COULD BE IN THE GROUP WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE.  RECRUITS 
RANGE IN AGE FROM TEENAGERS TO MEN IN THEIR 40\'S AND 50\'S, AND ALL 
RECEIVE ONE TO TWO MONTHS TRAINING BEFORE BEING SENT ACROSS THE 
LINE-OF-CONTROL (LOC) INTO INDIAN KASHMIR.  CROSSING THE LOC IS 
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, HAIDER SAID, THEREFORE THE SIZE OF 
INFILTRATING GROUPS IS KEPT SMALL -- NO MORE THAN 20 MEN -- SO THAT 
CASUALTIES ARE LIMITED IF THE GROUP IS CAUGHT IN AN INDIAN AMBUSH. 
HAIDER DENIED THAT PAKISTANI TROOPS PROVIDE COVERING FIRE FOR JKIF 
MILITANTS. 
 
7.  (S)  COMMENT:  HAIDER SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE GROUP AT OUR NEXT MEETING, WHILE BOTH HE AND BAIG, WHO 
HAD REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT, EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE U.S. 
VIEWED JKIF AS A TERRORIST OUTFIT (SOMETHING WHICH WE DID NOT BRING 
UP FOR FEAR OF PROVOKING AN ABRUPT END TO OUR VISIT).  USHERING US 
TO THE DOOR, HAIDER WHISPERED THAT HE WOULD ALSO SHARE WITH US 
\"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\" ABOUT THE APHC\'S ACTIVITIES THE NEXT 
TIME WE MET.  OBVIOUSLY MUCH OF WHAT SAID BY THESE MEN WAS TAILORED 
TO FIT THE AUDIENCE, BUT WE OFFER IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, AND WE 
WILL ATTEMPT GLEAN MORE ABOUT THE GROUP AND THEIR ACTIVITIES IN 
FUTURE MEETINGS.

1. (U)  CLASSIFIED BY CDA ALAN EASTHAM, 1.5D. 
 
2. (C)  SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD SUMMONED P-5 CHIEFS 
OF MISSION ON A HALF-HOUR\'S NOTICE APRIL 6 TO INFORM US OF THE 
\"SUCCESSFUL TEST\" OF THE \"INDIGENOUS\" GHAURI MISSILE, WHICH HE SAID 
HAD A 1,500 KM RANGE FOR A 700 KG PAYLOAD.  HALF HIS PRESENTATION 
WAS ON THE MISSILE; THE OTHER HALF WAS AN INDIA-CENTRIC 
JUSTIFICATION FOR MISSILE TESTING.  CHARGE\' OFFERED AN INFORMAL 
IMMEDIATE REACTION IN PRIVATE, NOTING THAT THE TEST WAS 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUGGESTION FOR RESTRAINT MADE IN THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (U)  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMAD CALLED IN THE AMBASSADORS 
OF RUSSIA, U.K. AND FRANCE AND THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN CHARGES ON 
APRIL 6.  FOLLOWING IS A DIGEST OF HIS PRESENTATION: 
 
--  I HAVE ASKED YOU TO COME TO INFORM YOU THAT AS A PART OF 
PAKISTAN\'S INTEGRATED MISSILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, 
TODAY WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FLIGHT-TESTED THE SURFACE-TO-SURFACE 
\"GHAURI\" MISSILE IN THE HATF SERIES.  (COMMENT: AN ACCOMPANYING 
PRESS RELEASE CALLS THIS MISSILE THE \"HATF-FIVE\" (ROMAN NUMERAL 
HATF-V). 
 
--  THIS MISSILE HAS A RANGE OF 1,500 KM AND A PAYLOAD OF 700KG. 
 
--  THIS TEST REPRESENTS A STEP FORWARD IN OUR INDIGENOUS MISSILE 
AND SATELLITE LAUNCH PROGRAMS.  WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS INDIGENOUS 
CAPABILITY THROUGH THE COMMITMENT OF PAKISTANI SCIENTISTS AND 
ENGINEERS. 
 
--  WE DO NOT HAVE TO REFRESH YOUR MEMORY REGARDING INDIAN FLIGHT 
TESTS.  INDIA HAS CONDUCTED 16 TESTS OF THE PAKISTAN-SPECIFIC 
PRITHVI MISSILE AND HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED IT ALONG OUR BORDERS. 
INDIA HAS ALSO TESTED THE AGNI MISSILE FOUR TIMES. 
 
--  IN SPITE OF THE INDIAN PROVOCATIVE TESTS IN THEIR NUCLEAR AND 
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXERCISED EXTREME RESTRAINT. 
BUT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT ABOUT PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY. 
 
--  LET ME REITERATE THAT PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW RESTRAINT. 
WE DO NOT WANT TO SPARK A NUCLEAR AND MISSILE ARMS RACE IN SOUTH 
ASIA. 
 
--  WE HAVE ALREADY MADE FORMAL PROPOSALS TO INDIA FOR MUTUAL AND 
EQUITABLE RESTRAINT IN THE NUCLEAR AND MISSILE AREA WITHOUT 
RECEIVING ANY RESPONSE.  WE ARE PREPARED TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS 
WITH INDIA ON NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC MISSILE ISSUES AS AN INTEGRAL 
PART OF OUR BILATERAL DIALOGUE, WHICH AS YOU KNOW REMAINS 
STALEMATED BECAUSE OF PROCEDURAL DIFFICULTIES. 
 
--  ON OUR PART WE ARE DOING OUR BEST TO OVERCOME THESE PROCEDURAL 
DIFFICULTIES;  WE HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE. 
 
4.  (C)  THE BRITISH HIGH COMMISSIONER ASKED WHERE THE TEST HAD 
BEEN CARRIED OUT; THE FS SAID \"IN PAKISTAN, ON LAND.\"  SUBSEQUENT 
QUESTIONS FROM THE GROUP REVOLVED AROUND THE DIALOGUE WITH INDIA, 
WITH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY OFFERING NOTHING NEW.  ACCOMPANYING 
PRESS RELEASE (FAXED TO SA/PAB) ADDS NOTHING TO WHAT IS REPORTED 
ABOVE. 
 
5.  (C)  FOLLOWING THE GROUP SESSION, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ASKED 
TO SEE CHARGE\' PRIVATELY TO DISCUSS ANOTHER MATTER.  IN HIS OFFICE, 
CHARGE\' SAID THAT NEWS OF THIS TEST MAY BE TAKEN BADLY IN 
WASHINGTON, SINCE IT DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE 
U.S. BELIEVES THE DECISION TO TEST A NEW MISSILE COULD HAVE BEEN 
POSTPONED IN ORDER TO LET THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT ESTABLISH 
ITSELF.  HOW THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT WILL REACT IS UNPREDICTABLE. 
 
6. (C) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY RESPONDED BY REITERATING THE POINTS 
CITED ABOVE ON INDIAN TESTS, ADDING THAT \"NO ONE EVER SAID 
ANYTHING\" ABOUT INDIAN MISSILE TESTING. CHARGE\' SAID THAT OF COURSE 
IT WAS UP TO PAKISTAN HOW PAKISTAN TOOK CARE OF ITS OWN SECURITY, 
BUT FROM HIS RECOLLECTION IT HAD BEEN SEVERAL YEARS SINCE THE 
INDIANS HAD COMPLETED THE \"TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATION\" PHASE OF AGNI 
TESTING.  THE DIFFICULTY OF MISSILE SYSTEMS WAS THEIR DESTABILIZING 
EFFECT IN TIMES OF TENSION.  ADDITIONAL SECRETARY TARIQ ALTAF 
QUICKLY ADDED THAT THE BJP PLATFORM CALLED FOR \"INDUCTING\" NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS TO INDIA\'S FORCES, A POINT WHICH THE FOREIGN SECRETARY 
QUICKLY ENDORSED.  CHARGE\' CLOSED THE SESSION BY SAYING THAT AS THE 
SECRETARY HAD SUGGESTED IN HER LETTER AND THE FOREIGN MINISTER HAD 
ACCEPTED IN HIS REPLY, THIS WOULD CERTAINLY BE A SUBJECT FOR 
DISCUSSION DURING THE VISIT OF AMBASSADORS RICHARDSON AND 
INDERFURTH AND MR. RIEDEL. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT:  WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD USE AMBASSADOR 
KHOKHAR\'S CALL ON ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH TODAY TO CONVEY 
MORE FORMAL REGRETS ABOUT PAKISTAN\'S DECISION TO TEST THIS MISSILE, 
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE SECRETARY\'S LETTER SPECIFICALLY 
REQUESTING RESTRAINT IN MISSILE TESTING.  (FYI, WE HAD A SUGGESTION 
FROM ANOTHER SENIOR PAKISTANI OVER THE WEEKEND THAT SOME AT LEAST 
THINK PAKISTAN DID EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN NOT TESTING BEFORE MARCH 
23 AND IN NOT DISPLAYING THE MISSILE THAT DAY DURING THE PAKISTAN 
DAY PARADE.) 
 
8. (C) NOTE ALSO THAT THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A \"FLIGHT TEST,\" AND 
NOT/NOT AS INDUCTION OF THE MISSILE INTO PAKISTAN\'S ARMED FORCES. 
THE PAKISTANIS VIEW THIS AS CATCHING UP TO THE INDIANS, 
SPECIFICALLY WITH REGARD TO AGNI, AND NOT AS LEAPFROGGING THEIR 
MISSILE CAPABILITIES.   THE TIMING IS CLEARLY RELATED TO THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE BJP GOVERNMENT IN INDIA AND EXTREME PAKISTANI 
NERVOUSNESS ABOUT BJP PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE NUCLEAR AREA, 
SPECIFICALLY THE DECLARATIONS OF THE INTENTION TO \"INDUCT\" NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS.  THE PAKISTANIS DECIDED TO LAY DOWN A FIRM MARKER BOTH TO 
THE INDIANS AND THE PAKISTANI PUBLIC THAT PAKISTANI CAPABILITIES IN 
THIS FIELD ARE NOT INSIGNIFICANT.  THIS TEST WILL PRESENT THE BJP- 
LED GOVERNMENT IN INDIA WITH A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE 
SECURITY FIELD AT THE MOMENT IT IS ESTABLISHING ITSELF IN DELHI.

TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A. ISLAMABAD 3446; B. ISLAMABAD 3358 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY CHARGE ALAN EASTHAM.  REASON:  1.5 (B,D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED COMPLAINED TO THE 
AMBASSADOR ON MAY 8 ABOUT THE \"ONE-SIDED VIEW\" OF THE JUST-RELEASED 
USG REPORT ON TERRORISM, LAMENTING THAT INDIA WAS PORTRAYED MORE 
POSITIVELY THAN PAKISTAN.  ACKNOWLEDGING A RECENT RESPITE (WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 KILLINGS OF 22 PEOPLE IN AZAD KASHMIR 
-- REF B), SHAMSHAD URGED THE U.S. TO USE ITS INFLUENCE IN DELHI TO 
STOP INDIAN SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.  CONCERNING THE 
APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP HAD CONSCIOUSLY DECIDED 
NOT TO RETALIATE, BUT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE SUCH RESTRAINT 
IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH INCIDENTS.  HE NOTED THAT IN THE 
CONTEXT OF INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE, DIALOGUE WITH INDIA WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT, BUT HE SAID THE GOP NEVERTHELESS LOOKS FORWARD TO A 
SUMMIT MEETING WITH THE INDIANS IN COLOMBO IN JULY TO EXPLORE HOW 
TO PROCEED WITH THE DIALOGUE.  THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE GOP 
RESTRAINT IN THE WAKE OF THE \"SHOCKING\" EVENT OF APRIL 26/27 AND 
NOTED THAT HE UNDERSTOOD SHAMSHAD\'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD 
NOT BE LIMITLESS IF THERE WERE REPEATS OF SUCH TRAGIC INCIDENTS. 
SHIFTING TO AFGHANISTAN, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS ENHEARTENED BY 
THE TALIBAN AGREEMENT TO RELEASE 1000 TONS OF FOOD FOR BAMIYAN AND 
SAID ISLAMABAD IS PUSHING FOR A COORDINATORS\' MEETING BETWEEN THE 
TWO SIDES.  (SEE REF A FOR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE INDEPENDENT 
POWER PROJECTS.) END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SHAMSHAD AHMED CALLED IN THE AMBASSADOR 
MAY 8 TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RECENTLY-RELEASED USG REPORT, \"PATTERNS 
OF GLOBAL TERRORISM.\"  ACCORDING TO SHAMSHAD, THE REPORT GAVE A 
\"ONE-SIDED VIEW\" OF THE SITUATIONS IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN.  HE 
POINTED OUT THAT THE PAKISTAN SECTION OF THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED 
SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND THE HARAKAT-UL-ANSAR, WHILE THE INDIA 
SECTION EMPHASIZED THE MILITANCY IN INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, WHICH -- 
SHAMSHAD STRESSED -- IS ACTUALLY \"AN INDIGENOUS FREEDOM STRUGGLE.\" 
HE DECRIED THAT THE REPORT REFERRED TO NUMEROUS BOMBINGS IN INDIA 
(ASCRIBED TO CROSS-BORDER SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM), WHILE THE REPORT 
MAKES NO MENTION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS IN PAKISTAN, IN WHICH THE 
INDIANS HAVE HAD A ROLE, HE ADDED.  \"WE EXPECTED THE USG TO 
UNDERTAKE AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF THE SITUATIONS IN BOTH COUNTRIES,\" 
HE LAMENTED.  \"WASHINGTON,\" HE CONTINUED, \"MUST USE ITS INFLUENCE 
IN DELHI TO STOP GOI SUPPORT FOR CROSS-BORDER TERRORISM.\" 
FINISHING HIS THOUGHT, SHAMSHAD NOTED THAT IN RECENT WEEKS THERE 
HAS BEEN A \"RESPITE\" IN INDIAN-SUPPORTED TERRORISM IN PAKISTAN, 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE APRIL 26/27 SLAYINGS OF 22 KASHMIRIS IN 
AZAD KASHMIR (REF B). 
 
3. (C) SHUFFLING NOTES, SHAMSHAD GAVE A VIRTUALLY VERBATIM REPEAT 
OF A MAY 4 BRIEFING GIVEN BY MFA ADDITIONAL SECRETARY (SOUTH ASIA) 
TARIQ ALTAF (AND ATTENDED BY POLOFF) ON THE KILLINGS IN AZAD 
KASHMIR.  DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT AS \"VERY SERIOUS,\" SHAMSHAD SAID 
THE INCIDENT WAS THE FIRST \"TRANS-LINE OF CONTROL\" INCIDENT OF THAT 
NATURE -- \"THE ATTACK ACROSS THE LOC VIOLATED THE SANCTITY OF THE 
LINE OF CONTROL, SOMETHING WHICH MUST BE RESPECTED.\"  PAKISTAN, HE 
SAID, HAS MADE A DELIBERATE DECISION NOT TO RETALIATE TO REDUCE 
RISKS OF THE SITUATION \"GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.\"  HE ADDED THAT THE 
INCIDENT HAS HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PUBLIC OPINION, AND THERE 
MUST BE AN IMMEDIATE END TO SUCH EVENTS, WARNING THAT IF THERE ARE 
MORE SUCH INCIDENTS, \"PAKISTAN WOULD FIND IT HARD NOT TO 
RETALIATE.\"  OBSERVING THAT PAKISTAN CONDEMNS TERRORIST ACTS IN 
INDIAN-HELD KASHMIR, SHAMSHAD DECLARED THAT THERE IS A \"QUALITATIVE 
DIFFERENCE\" BETWEEN VIOLENT ACTS ON THE INDIAN SIDE -- \"THERE\'S A 
FREEDOM STRUGGLE UNDERWAY THERE\" -- AND THE PAK SIDE, \"WHERE THERE 
IS NO SUCH STRUGGLE.\" 
 
4. (C) SHIFTING FOCUS, SHAMSHAD ASSERTED THAT \"PAKISTAN HAS BEEN 
WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNE TIME TO PICK UP THE THREAD OF INDO-PAK 
DIALOGUE.\"  HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT DELHI WOULD \"ADOPT A SERIOUS 
ATTITUDE\" TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESUMING THE DIALOGUE. 
DECLARING THAT THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN NEED TO BE CONVINCED ON THE 
DIALOGUE, SHAMSHAD SAID THAT IN THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE \"NO 
GOVERNMENT CAN AFFORD TO CARRY ON THE TALKS.\"  SHAMSHAD OBSERVED 
THAT ISLAMABAD NEVERTHELESS IS \"EARNESTLY LOOKING FORWARD\" TO THE 
TWO PRIME MINISTERS\' MEETING IN COLOMBO \"TO EXPLORE THE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIALOGUE.\"  HE SAID ISLAMABAD WOULD SEND 
INSTRUCTIONS TO ITS HIGH COMMISSION IN DELHI TO THIS EFFECT, BUT 
\"ONLY AFTER THE CURRENT PUBLIC ATTITUDE SUBSIDES.\"  WASHINGTON, HE 
ADDED, CAN PLAY A ROLE IN KEEPING TEMPERS LOW.  RETURNING TO HIS 
THEME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING, SHAMSHAD SAID WASHINGTON 
SHOULD AVOID TAKING PRO-INDIAN STANCES WHICH PROVOKE A PAKISTANI 
REACTION, ADDING THAT THE GOP \"IS DOING ITS BEST\" TO CONTROL THE 
PUBLIC REACTION TO THE RECENTLY-ANNOUNCED MTCR-RELATED SANCTIONS ON 
KHAN RESEARCH LABORATORIES.  THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE GOP 
SEEMED TO BE SUCCEEDING IN THAT REGARD AS THE REACTION HAS BEEN 
\"MODEST.\" 
 
5. (C) RESPONDING TO SHAMSHAD\'S LENGTHY MONOLOGUE, THE AMBASSADOR 
SAID HE WOULD CONVEY TO WASHINGTON THE GOP\'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
TERRORISM REPORT.  DODGING THE AMBASSADOR\'S SEVERAL QUESTIONS 
CONCERNING WHY THE ATTACKERS IN THE APRIL 26/27 INCIDENT FOCUSSED 
ON ONLY TWO FAMILIES, SHAMSHAD SAID THE KILLERS WANTED TO GIVE THE 
APPEARANCE THAT THE INCIDENT WAS \"AN INSIDE JOB.\"  RESPONDING TO 
ANOTHER QUERY, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP WAS SURE THE ATTACKERS HAD 
COME FROM ACROSS THE LOC -- \"WE HAVE INTERCEPTS THAT MAKE THAT 
CLEAR,\" HE NOTED.  TERMING THE INCIDENT \"SHOCKING AND 
UNFORGIVABLE,\" THE AMBASSADOR APPLAUDED THE RESTRAINT THAT PAKISTAN 
HAS EXERCISED IN THE WAKE OF THE INCIDENT, ADDING THAT HE 
UNDERSTANDS SHAMSHAD\'S POINT THAT SUCH RESTRAINT WOULD NOT BE 
LIMITLESS IF SUCH INCIDENTS WERE REPEATED.  THE AMBASSADOR 
UNDERSCORED THAT THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION FOR 
THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE.  RETURNING YET AGAIN TO HIS THEME OF USG 
ONE-SIDEDNESS, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THAT THE USG HAD NOT ISSUED A 
STATEMENT CONDEMNING THE KILLINGS, REITERATING THAT WASHINGTON DOES 
NOT MENTION THE INDIAN ROLE IN FOMENTING VIOLENCE IN PAKISTAN -- 
\"FOR US THIS IS VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE,\" HE ADDED. 
WARMING TO THIS THEME, SHAMSHAD REGRETTED THE REPORTED WASHINGTON 
DENIAL THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING SANCTIONING INDIA ON THE SAGARIKA 
MISSILE. 
 
\"BREAKTHROUGH ON AFGHANISTAN\" 
----------------------------- 
 
6. (C) TURNING TO THE RECENT AFGHANISTAN STEERING COMMITTEE TALKS 
IN ISLAMABAD BETWEEN THE TALIBAN AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, 
SHAMSHAD SAID THE TALKS HAD BEEN \"A GOOD SUCCESS, A MAJOR 
BREAKTHROUGH, THE FIRST TIME IN A FEW YEARS THAT THE SIDES SAT 
TOGETHER FACE-TO-FACE.\"  HE GAVE THE U.S. AND HIS OWN GOVERNMENT 
CREDIT FOR THE MEETINGS.  PAKISTAN\'S DESIRE, HE ADDED, IS TO 
FACILITATE THE AFGHANISTAN DIALOGUE PROCESS, AND HE RECOUNTED PAK 
EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT THE TALKS.  HE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THE FIVE 
DAYS OF TALKS HAD BEEN \"INCONCLUSIVE,\" ONE SHOULD NOT BE 
DISCOURAGED -- \"PAKISTAN IS KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH ALL PARTIES.\" 
TAKING CREDIT FOR THE RECENT TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY WOULD 
ALLOW 1000 TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN PROVINCE, SHAMSHAD SAID 
THIS \"MAKES QUITE CLEAR THAT IF YOU DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN, THEN YOU 
CAN GET EVERYTHING.\"  THE AMBASSADOR SUGGESTED THAT \"MAYBE NOT 
EVERYTHING.\"  WHAT IS IMPORTANT, SHAMSHAD UNDERSCORED, IS HOW ONE 
DEALS WITH THE TALIBAN.  SCORING THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT AS A 
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, SHAMSHAD SAID THE GOP IS NOW PUSHING FOR A 
\"COORDINATORS\' MEETING\" BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES -- \"PAKISTAN IS 
INTENSIFYING ITS EFFORTS TO GET THE TWO SIDES BACK TOGETHER SOON; 
WE MUST NOT LOSE THE MOMENTUM.\"  HE PROMISED TO KEEP THE AMBASSADOR 
FULLY INFORMED OF THE GOP\'S PROGRESS ON THE AFGHANISTAN FRONT. 
 
7. (C) NOTING AGREEMENT WITH THE GOP ON AFGHANISTAN, THE AMBASSADOR 
OBSERVED THAT HE WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEETING 
AS \"A STEP FORWARD\" RATHER THAN A BREAKTHROUGH.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED 
APPRECIATION FOR THE GOP\'S CONTRIBUTION IN HELPING MAKE THE MEETING 
HAPPEN.  SHAMSHAD SAID NORTHERN LEADER PROFESSOR RABBANI HAD 
RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE TALIBAN ANNOUNCEMENT ON ALLOWING 1000 
TONS OF FOOD AID INTO BAMIYAN AND WAS NOW CONSULTING HIS ALLIANCE 
COLLEAGUES.  THE FOREIGN SECRETARY SAID DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE 
NORTHERN ALLIANCE WAS \"THE BIGGEST PROBLEM,\" TO WHICH THE 
AMBASSADOR RESPONDED WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT THE TALIBAN, TOO, 
HAD TROUBLES WITHIN ITS OWN RANKS.  SUPPORTING THE NOTION OF A 
COORDINATORS\' MEETING, THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT THE U.S. AND 
PAKISTAN ARE \"ON THE SAME WAVE-LENGTH.\"  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, 
THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED, IS THAT THE SIDES CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN 
AGREEMENT ON \"NO MILITARY OFFENSIVES.\"  ALL SIDES, HE UNDERSCORED, 
MUST STAY FOCUSSED ON THIS ESSENTIAL POINT. 
 
8. (C) DREDGING UP AN OLD THEME, SHAMSHAD CALLED FOR AN ARMS 
EMBARGO ON AFGHANISTAN AND ASSERTED THAT PAKISTAN IS READY TO 
COOPERATE ON THIS.  HE SAID ISLAMABAD IS \"SURPRISED\" THAT THE SIX 
PLUS TWO PROCESS IS \"SO CASUAL\" ON THE NEED FOR AN EMBARGO. 
RESPONDING, THE AMBASSADOR QUOTED UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE LAKHDAR 
BRAHIMI AS SAYING THAT IF PAKISTAN AND IRAN AGREE TO CUT OFF ARMS, 
THEN THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR AN EMBARGO, AND, WITHOUT PAK- 
IRANIAN AGREEMENT, AN EMBARGO WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT:  THIS MEETING WAS VINTAGE SHAMSHAD, WHO DUTIFULLY-- 
AND WITH SOME PLEASURE -- LAMBASTED AMERICA ON THE LATEST 
PERCEIVED SLIGHT, BUT WAS BEREFT OF ANY FRESH THINKING ON HOW BEST 
TO PROCEED IN STRENGTHENING THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP OR ON HOW TO 
WORK TOGETHER MOST CONSTRUCTIVELY IN ADVANCING PEACE IN 
AFGHANISTAN.  BUT, WE HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT TOO MUCH.

CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY R. PYATT, REASON 
1.5 (D) 
 
THIS IS LAHORE 315 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: MEETING MAY 25 WITH PRINCIPAL OFFICER, FORMER PRIME 
MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO SAID SHE WOULD NO LONGER PRESS THE 
GOVERNMENT TO TEST ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITY.  THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A 
TIME FOR A DETONATION, BENAZIR ARGUED, BUT AT THIS STAGE A TEST 
WOULD BE COUNTER TO PAKISTAN\'S INTERESTS.  INSTEAD, SHE SAID, THE 
PPP WILL REDIRECT ITS CRITICISM OF NAWAZ SHARIF TO FOCUS ON THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S \"INDECISION\" AND \"MISMANAGEMENT.\"  BENAZIR ARGUED THAT 
MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN\'S HISTORY WHICH REQUIRES A 
FUNDAMENTAL RETHINKING OF THE COUNTRY\'S SECURITY STRATEGY.  SHE 
PREDICTED THAT NAWAZ MAY HAVE TO BE \"SACRIFICED\" IN ORDER TO HEAL 
THE WOUNDED PRIDE OF PAKISTAN\'S MILITARY.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER 
CAUTIONED THAT BENAZIR\'S BELLICOSE REACTION TO INDIA\'S TESTS HAD 
DRAWN HARSH CRITICISM IN THE WEST AND SUGGESTED THAT THE PPP STATE 
PUBLICLY THAT TESTING IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE USED AS A POLITICAL 
FOOTBALL.  BENAZIR DISAVOWED HER WIDELY-REPRINTED OP-ED CALLING FOR 
A PREEMPTIVE MILITARY STRIKE ON INDIA, CLAIMING THAT SHE INVOKED 
THIS POSSIBILITY ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE THE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE 
-- NOT AS A RECOMMENDATION FOR ACTION.  ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN 
THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, SHE RECOMMENDED A COOLING-OFF PERIOD 
FOLLOWED BY NEGOTIATIONS TO RATIFY THE CURRENT DIVISION OF KASHMIR. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER MET MAY 25 AT HER REQUEST WITH FORMER 
PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO, WHO WAS IN LAHORE FOR AN APPEARANCE 
BEFORE THE HIGH COURT\'S ACCOUNTABILITY BENCH.  SHE WAS JOINED BY 
PPP PROVINCIAL PRESIDENT RAO SIKANDER IQBAL AND COMMUNICATIONS 
DIRECTOR QASIM ZIA.  THIS MEETING FOLLOWED SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS IN 
WHICH PPP LEADERS HAVE CLAIMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED OUR ARGUMENTS IN 
FAVOR OF RESTRAINT (REFTEL) AND TO HAVE CONVINCED BENAZIR TO SOFTEN 
HER RHETORIC.  SENATE OPPOSITION LEADER AITZAZ AHSAN WENT SO FAR AS 
TO CLAIM ON MAY 24 THAT BENAZIR HAD \"TAKEN A U-TURN\" AND OPENLY 
OPPOSED NUCLEAR TESTING IN RECENT PPP LEADERSHIP MEETINGS. 
 
BACK FROM THE BRINK 
------------------- 
 
3. (C) ASKED ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT SHE HAD URGED NATION-WIDE 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN FAVOR OF TESTING, BENAZIR CLAIMED THAT NO ONE IN 
THE PPP WOULD CALL FOR TESTING FROM NOW ON.  THE MOMENT HAS PASSED. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT A TEST NOW WOULD HAVE A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON 
PAKISTAN\'S ECONOMY AND INTERNATIONAL REPUTATION.  I CANNOT SAY 
THESE THINGS PUBLICLY, BENAZIR SAID, BUT NEITHER WILL I CALL FOR A 
DETONATION.  AT THE OPPOSITION\'S MAY 21 HYDERABAD RALLY, SHE NOTED, 
THE LINES THAT GOT THE MOST APPLAUSE WERE NOT TAHIR-UL-QADRI\'S CALL 
FOR NUCLEAR TESTING, BUT HER OWN ATTACKS ON NAWAZ SHARIF\'S ECONOMIC 
LEADERSHIP AND MANHOOD.  WHEN PRESSED ON THE PPP\'S POSTURE, BENAZIR 
CONCEDED THAT EVEN IF SHE WANTED TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AGAINST 
TESTING SHE COULD NOT, SINCE THIS WOULD BE ATTACKED BY OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE OPPOSITION ALLIANCE.  WE WERE DRIVEN INTO THIS 
ALLIANCE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO DEAL WITH US A 
LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION IN PARLIAMENT -- SO NOW WE MUST LIVE WITH THE 
CONSEQUENCES. 
 
4. (C) MAY 11 WAS A TURNING POINT IN PAKISTAN\'S HISTORY, BENAZIR 
SAID.  WE HAVE TO RETHINK HOW WE DEFINE OUR SECURITY AND HOW WE 
LOOK AT INDIA.  ACCORDING TO MY SOURCES, BENAZIR CONTINUED, THE 
MILITARY LEADERSHIP UNDERSTANDS THESE CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS 
IN NO HURRY TO TEST A NUCLEAR DEVICE.  HOWEVER, AT LOWER LEVELS OF 
THE MILITARY THERE IS A FEELING OF WOUNDED PRIDE SIMILAR TO 
SENTIMENTS AFTER THE 1971 LOSS OF BANGLADESH.  \"I\'M AFRAID NAWAZ 
MAY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED TO HEAL THAT SENSE OF SHAME,\" 
BENAZIR ADDED, \"BUT IT\'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHO MIGHT TAKE HIS PLACE.\" 
 
5. (C) EVEN IF I AM NOT CALLING FOR A NUCLEAR TEST, BENAZIR 
SUGGESTED, NAWAZ SHARIF WILL REMAIN VULNERABLE TO CRITICISMS OF HIS 
INDECISION IN THE FACE OF INDIA\'S AGGRESSION.  \"NAWAZ IS TRYING TO 
PUT HANDCUFFS ON ME,\" BENAZIR QUIPPED, \"BUT I\'M GOING TO PUT 
BANGLES ON HIM.\" (NOTE: BY SUGGESTING THAT NAWAZ WEARS BANGLES, AS 
SHE DID IN HYDERABAD, BENAZIR IS QUESTIONING HIS MASCULINITY -- A 
DEEP INSULT IN THIS SOCIETY.) 
 
SHIFTING THE DEBATE 
------------------- 
 
6. (C) IF THE PPP HAS DECIDED NUCLEAR TESTING WOULD BE AGAINST THE 
COUNTRY\'S BEST INTERESTS, PRINCIPAL OFFICER SUGGESTED, THEN IT 
WOULD BE HELPFUL TO MAKE THIS POINT PUBLICLY.  SO FAR IN THIS 
DEBATE, THE OPPOSITION HAS APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED MORE BY 
POLITICS THAN BY NATIONAL INTERESTS.  AT THE VERY LEAST, THE PPP 
SHOULD SIGNAL TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE PARTY HAS DECIDED THIS 
ISSUE IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE TREATED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. 
BENAZIR WAS INTRIGUED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND INSTRUCTED HER 
COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW-UP. 
 
7. (C) PRINCIPAL OFFICER ALSO QUESTIONED BENAZIR ON HER MAY 17 LOS 
ANGELES TIMES OP-ED, WHICH CONCLUDED BY DANGLING THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON INDIA IN RESPONSE TO THE TESTS.  BENAZIR 
DISAVOWED THIS INTERPRETATION, CLAIMING THE PIECE WAS DRAFTED TO 
ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE RESPONSES, NOT AS A PRESCRIPTION FOR ACTION. 
ACTUALLY, BENAZIR SAID, THE IDEA CAME FROM ROBERT MCNAMARA, WHO 
SUGGESTED WHEN I WAS IN LONDON THAT A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE WOULD BE 
ONE OPTION UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THE UNITED STATES WAS FACED WITH 
A SIMILAR THREAT. 
 
8. (C) ASKED ABOUT NEXT STEPS IN THE INDO-PAK DIALOGUE, BENAZIR 
SUGGESTED THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF SEVERAL 
MONTHS, AFTER WHICH NEGOTIATIONS COULD BEGIN TO MAKE THE LINE OF 
CONTROL A PERMANENT BORDER.  GIVEN THE NEW STRATEGIC REALITIES, 
DIVIDING KASHMIR WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ONLY OPTION.  SHE ASSUMED 
THAT WESTERN SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN\'S NUCLEAR RESTRAINT WOULD 
EVENTUALLY BE FOLLOWED BY PRESSURE TO COME CLEAN AND ADHERE TO THE 
CTBT AND NPT.  PRINCIPAL OFFICER REPLIED THAT DECISIONS ON NATIONAL 
SECURITY WILL HAVE TO BE ANSWERED BY THE PAKISTANIS, NOT BY OUTSIDE 
POWERS.  WE HOPE THE DEBATE OVER PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY WILL INCLUDE 
THE WIDEST POSSIBLE SWATH OF POLITICAL OPINION, BUT THAT DEPENDS ON 
A MORE CIVILIZED DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PML AND PPP. 
 
9 COMMENT: BENAZIR REMAINS FIRMLY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL OF DRIVING 
NAWAZ SHARIF FROM OFFICE, AND IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HER 
TO PASS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO EAT AWAY AT HIS PUBLIC BASE.  HOWEVER, 
UNLIKE MOST IN THE OPPOSITION, SHE UNDERSTANDS THE LASTING DAMAGE 
THAT WOULD BE DONE BY A NUCLEAR TEST, AND APPEARS GENUINE IN HER 
VIEW THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT NOW TEST.  CRITICISM FROM HER MORE 
COURAGEOUS PARTY COLLEAGUES AND ADVISERS IN THE U.S. MAY ALSO HAVE 
HELPED TO MODERATE HER OPINION.  THIS SHIFT MAY BUY THE GOVERNMENT 
A LITTLE MANEUVERING ROOM, BUT NOT MUCH.  INDEED, BENAZIR\'S NEW 
TACTIC OF QUESTIONING NAWAZ\' MANHOOD MAY PROVE A POWERFUL CATALYST 
TOWARDS THE NUCLEAR TEST THAT SHE NOW CLAIMS TO OPPOSE.

(U)  CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS DAN MOZENA.  REASON:  1.5(D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S OPPONENTS SEE NAWAZ 
SHARIF\'S HESITATION IN RESPONDING TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR CHALLENGE 
AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDAS. 
PAKISTAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (PPP) LEADER BENAZIR BHUTTO HAS CALLED FOR 
NAWAZ\'S RESIGNATION AND THE FORMATION OF A \"NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.\" 
THE OPPOSITION COALITION PAKISTANI AWAMI ITTEHAD (PAI) -- OF WHICH 
THE PPP IS THE LARGEST ELEMENT -- HAS DEMANDED THAT PAKISTAN 
CONDUCT A NUCLEAR TEST.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES (NOT PART OF THE PAI) 
ARE THREATENING TO TAKE TO THE STREETS IF THE GOVERNMENT FAILS TO 
CARRY OUT A NUCLEAR TEST BY MAY 30.  IN PRIVATE, HOWEVER, BENAZIR 
HERSELF (REF C) AS WELL AS THE PPP\'S SPOKESMAN AND ONE OF THE 
PARTY\'S SENATORS SEPARATELY TOLD US THEY FEEL THE TIME IS PAST FOR 
A NUCLEAR TEST IN RESPONSE TO INDIA\'S MAY 11 AND 13 BLASTS. 
DESPITE OPPOSITION ATTEMPTS TO DEPICT HIM AS WEAK AND INDECISIVE, 
A RECENT GALLUP POLL GIVES NAWAZ A 77 PERCENT APPROVAL RATING ON 
HIS HANDLING OF THE NUCLEAR CRISIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PPP SPOKESMAN SEES INDIAN TEST AS \"GODSEND\" 
------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  PAKISTAN PEOPLE\'S PARTY (PPP) SPOKESMAN FARHATULLAH BABAR 
TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT INDIA\'S NUCLEAR TESTS ON MAY 11 AND MAY 13 
WERE A \"GODSEND\" FOR HIS PARTY\'S EFFORTS TO SHAKE NAWAZ SHARIF\'S 
HOLD ON POWER.  BABAR SAID THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S 
NUCLEAR TESTS IN KIND HAS NOW BEEN LOST AND IT WAS IMPERATIVE THAT 
PAKISTAN REASSERT ITS DETERMINATION TO RETAIN ITS NUCLEAR OPTION 
(WITHOUT CONDUCTING A TEST) AND THAT THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT 
STEP DOWN AND MAKE WAY FOR A \"NATIONAL GOVERNMENT\" THAT COULD 
EFFECTIVELY CONFRONT THE INDIAN MENACE.  FOLLOWING A SIMILAR LINE, 
PPP SENATOR RAZA RABBANI TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT THE TIME FOR 
PAKISTAN TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S TEST WITH A TEST OF ITS OWN WOULD 
HAVE BEEN WITHIN 48 TO 72 HOURS AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS.  NOW, HE 
SAID, THE GOVERNMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS WEAKNESS AND INDECISION 
AND SHOULD STEP ASIDE IN FAVOR OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
 
3.  (U)  THE PPP, THE PAI, AND BHUTTO HERSELF HAVE BEEN SENDING 
MIXED SIGNALS ON THE ISSUE OF A NUCLEAR TEST.  ON MAY 25 BHUTTO 
TOLD LAHORE PO THAT SHE HAS DROPPED HER CALL FOR PAKISTAN TO 
CONDUCT ITS OWN NUCLEAR TEST (REF C).  BUT ON MAY 27, THE PRESS 
QUOTES HER AS SAYING THAT \"A NUCLEAR TEST BY PAKISTAN IS NECESSARY 
TO KEEP INDIA AT BAY AND TO REVITALIZE THE STRUGGLE IN KASHMIR.\" 
FOLLOWING HER MEETING WITH FOREIGN MINISTER GOHAR AYUB ON MAY 22, 
BENAZIR SAID SHE WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN THE EVENT 
OF AN ARMED CONFRONTATION WITH INDIA, BUT THEN REPEATED HER CALL 
FOR THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.  IN LAHORE ON MAY 24, 
THE PAKISTAN AWAMI ITTEHAD -- OF WHICH THE PPP IS THE LARGEST 
COMPONENT -- CALLED FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND TO INDIA\'S 
NUCLEAR CHALLENGE BY TESTING A PAKISTANI BOMB, OR TO RESIGN.  THE 
PAI MEETING IN LAHORE WAS ATTENDED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM 41 
POLITICAL PARTIES IN PAKISTAN (MOST OF WHICH HAVE NO ELECTORAL 
WEIGHT); MINISTER FOR TOURISM SHEIKH RASHID AHMAD ATTENDED TO MAKE 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S CASE.  AFTER DENOUNCING THE GOVERNMENT FOR ITS 
WEAK RESPONSE TO THE INDIAN CHALLENGE, BENAZIR BHUTTO ACCUSED NAWAZ 
ET AL OF SPENDING THEIR TIME LOOKING FOR WAYS TO VICTIMIZE HER AND 
HER FAMILY RATHER THAN DEALING WITH THE COUNTRY\'S GRAVE SECURITY 
SITUATION.  MAY 28 PRESS ACCOUNTS REPORT THAT PAI PRESIDENT 
PROFESSOR TAHIRUL QADRI HAS SUPPORTED THE MAY 30 DEADLINE FOR A 
NUCLEAR TEST SET BY THE ISLAMIST PARTIES (SEE BELOW). 
 
ISLAMIC PARTIES DEMAND NUCLEAR TEST 
----------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  ALL OF THE MAJOR ISLAMIC PARTIES, INCLUDING THE JAMAAT-I- 
ISLAMI (JI) LED BY QAZI HUSSAIN AHMAD, THE JAMIAT-UL-ULEMAI ISLAM 
(F)(JUI-F), LED BY MAULANA FAZAL-UR-REHMAN, AND THE FACTION OF THE 
JAMIAT ULEMA E-PAKISTAN (JUP-N) LED BY MAULANA SHAH AHMED NOORANI 
HAVE PUBLICLY CALLED FOR A PAKISTANI NUCLEAR TEST.  REFLECTING 
PERHAPS THE LACK OF PUBLIC DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE ISSUE, 
HOWEVER, THE JI\'S CALL FOR A NATIONAL STRIKE ON MAY 22 TO PROTEST 
THE FAILURE TO CONDUCT A TEST WAS LARGELY IGNORED BY SHOPKEEPERS. 
VARIOUS OTHER PARTIES HAVE CALLED FOR A NATIONWIDE PROTEST CAMPAIGN 
IF A TEST DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MAY 30.  IRONICALLY, IN 
AFGHANISTAN THE TALIBAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH RECEIVES SUPPORT FROM THE 
JI AND THE JUI-F, HAS ENDORSED PAKISTAN\'S RIGHT TO CONDUCT A 
NUCLEAR TEST, WHILE CALLING UPON IT TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT. 
MEANWHILE, THE LEADER OF THE PML/N\'S COALITION PARTNER, THE SHIIA 
TEHRIK-E-JAFRIA PAKISTAN (TJP), ALLAMA SAJJID ALI NAQVI, HAS URGED 
NAWAZ TO REJECT AMERICAN HELP AND TO GO AHEAD WITH A NUCLEAR TEST. 
IN A REPORT APPEARING IN THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF \"THE MUSLIM,\" NAQVI IS 
SAID TO BELIEVE THAT PAKISTAN SHOULD NOT MOVE TOWARD THE U.S. AS 
THIS COULD ENDANGER ITS RELATIONS WITH ITS \"TRADITIONAL ALLIES IRAN 
AND CHINA.\" 
 
DIFFERENCES OVER TACTICS, NOT POLICY 
------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  BHUTTO\'S CRITICISMS OF THE SHARIF GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN 
DIRECTED MORE AT ITS TACTICS IN DEALING WITH THE INDIAN THREAT THAN 
AT ITS POLICY.  HER PUBLIC STATEMENTS WERE ECHOED BY BABAR IN HIS 
CONVERSATION WITH POLOFF MAY 26.  THE PPP\'S LINE APPEARS TO BE THAT 
IF BENAZIR HAD BEEN PRIME MINISTER, THE INDIANS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
LESS LIKELY TO TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  (BABAR, 
FOR INSTANCE, CREDITED BENAZIR\'S PREEMPTIVE DIPLOMACY IN 1995 WITH 
HEADING OFF AN INDIAN TEST AT THAT TIME.)  SPEAKING AT THE MAY 24 
PAI MEETING IN LAHORE, BENAZIR SAID NAWAZ SHARIF\'S \"GOOD MAN 
GUJRAL\" LINE LAST YEAR HAD BROUGHT PAKISTAN TO \"THE BRINK OF 
DISASTER.\"  ONCE INDIA DETONATED ITS BOMBS, BENAZIR (AND BABAR) 
SAID SHARIF SHOULD HAVE TAKEN VIGOROUS ACTION TO LINE-UP 
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AND CONDEMNATION OF INDIA. 
BABAR TOLD POLOFF THAT SHARIF HIMSELF SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHINA 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INDIAN TESTS TO SEEK SUPPORT RATHER THAN 
SENDING A \"LOW-LEVEL\" CAREER DIPLOMAT LIKE FOREIGN SECRETARY 
SHAMSHAD AHMED.  SHARIF HAD ALSO FAILED TO RALLY THE MUSLIM WORLD 
TO PAKISTAN\'S SIDE, BABAR SAID, AND HE CLAIMED THAT BENAZIR WOULD 
HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN NAWAZ IN WINNING WESTERN 
SUPPORT.  MEANWHILE, BENAZIR IS CLAIMING CREDIT FOR PAKISTAN\'S 
CAPABILITY OF READYING FOR A TEST IN TWO WEEKS; SHE SAID EARLIER 
PAKISTAN HAD REQUIRED 30 DAYS TO READY FOR A TEST, BUT SHE HAD CUT 
THAT BACK. 
 
6.  (C)  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER BABAR NOR BENAZIR HERSELF HAS WARNED 
NAWAZ AGAINST POSSIBLE U.S. ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE RESTRAINT ON NUCLEAR 
TESTING BY PROMISES OF AID.  THE ISLAMIC PARTIES AND MOST OF THE 
MAJOR URDU AND ENGLISH-LANGUAGE NEWSPAPERS HAVE CAUTIONED NAWAZ TO 
BEWARE OF AMERICAN BLANDISHMENTS.  BENAZIR AND THE PPP, HOWEVER, 
SEEM WILLING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE U.S. WILL DO IN RETURN FOR 
PAKISTANI RESTRAINT. 
 
7.  (C)  COMMENT:  POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM -- NOT CONCERNS FOR WHAT 
IS BEST FOR PAKISTAN -- SEEMS TO BE THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE 
OPPOSITION\'S UNRELENTING ATTACKS ON THE PRIME MINISTER.  THE 
OPPOSITION HAS BEEN IN OVERDRIVE DEPICTING NAWAZ AS INDECISIVE AND 
WEAK, GIVING HIM NO CREDIT FOR TAKING TIME TO WEIGH CAREFULLY THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF PAKISTAN\'S CONDUCTING (OR NOT CONDUCTING) A NUCLEAR 
TEST.  THE OPPOSITION\'S SUCCESS IN TURNING THE PUBLIC AGAINST 
CONTINUED RESTRAINT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION.  A JUST-RELEASED 
GALLUP POLL, FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTS THAT OVER TWO-THIRDS OF 
RESPONDENTS FAVORED A PAK NUCLEAR TEST, BUT \"IN RESPONSE TO 
FRIENDLY ADVICE\" TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT, NEARLY 60 PERCENT OF 
RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WOULD THEN FAVOR CONTINUED RESTRAINT.  77 
PERCENT WERE \"SATISFIED\" WITH HOW NAWAZ SHARIF HAS HANDLED THE 
SITUATION.  (SEPTEL PROVIDES MORE DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE POLL.)

CLASSIFIED BY ACTING POLCOUNS DAN MOZENA.  REASON:  1.5 (B). 
 
1. (U) SOMBER AND TIRED LOOKING, PRIME MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF TOLD 
HIS NATION MAY 28 EVENING THAT PAKISTAN HAD SUCCESSFULLY EXPLODED 
FIVE NUCLEAR DEVICES SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER IN THE DAY.  A RECURRING 
THEME THROUGHOUT THE SPEECH WAS THE FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR THREAT 
BEGINNING AS FAR BACK AS THE INDIAN NUCLEAR TEST IN 1974 AND AS 
RECENTLY AS THE TESTS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS MONTH.  NAWAZ SAID IF 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAD TAKEN THE INDIAN THREAT SERIOUSLY, 
THEN PAKISTAN MIGHT NOT HAVE NEEDED TO TEST. 
 
2. (U) NAWAZ TRIED TO STEEL HIS NATION FOR TOUGH TIMES AHEAD AND 
DECLARED THAT HE AND ALL GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY LEADERS WERE READY 
FOR AN ERA OF AUSTERITY AND SIMPLICITY, STARTING WITH NAWAZ\'S 
GIVING UP THE NEWLY-OPENED AND PALATIAL PRIME MINISTER\'S 
SECRETARIAT BUILDING, WHICH HE PROPOSED COULD BE CONVERTED INTO A 
HOSPITAL, WOMEN\'S UNIVERSITY, OR SOME OTHER CHARITY USE.  HE URGED 
PAKISTANIS TO BRACE THEMSELVES FOR DIFFICULT TIMES AHEAD AND TO 
FACE THESE DIFFICULTIES COURAGEOUSLY AND BOLDLY.  HE DECLARED 
PAKISTAN\'S OPTIONS OF BECOMING SLAVES OR LEADING HONORABLE AND 
INDEPENDENT LIVES LEFT PAKISTAN NO CHOICE. 
 
3. (U) REFLECTING INDO-PAK TIT-FOR-TAT MENTALITY, NAWAZ SAID 
PAKISTAN HAD RESPONDED TO INDIA\'S MISSILE TESTS WITH ITS OWN TEST 
OF THE GHAURI MISSILE LAST MONTH, AND PAKISTAN HAS NOW RESPONDED TO 
INDIA\'S FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS WITH FIVE OF ITS OWN.  HE DECLARED THAT 
THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE PAST DAYS IS NOW GONE, AND IF INDIA IS 
AGGRESSIVE, PAKISTAN WILL FIGHT BACK -- THE ARMED FORCES ARE 
PREPARED TO FIGHT AND THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS ARE PREPARED TO MEET 
ANY CHALLENGE.  NAWAZ SAID THAT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS HE WILL AGAIN 
SPEAK TO THE NATION TO ANNOUNCE A \"NATIONAL AGENDA.\" 
 
4. (U) IN A DIPLOMATIC SOP, NAWAZ PRAISED THE CHINESE, WHOM HE 
CALLED GREAT AND RELIABLE FRIENDS AND EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR 
THE JAPANESE, WHOM HE SAID WOULD HAVE AVOIDED HAVING HAD THEIR 
CITIES SUBJECTED TO NUCLEAR ATTACK HAD JAPAN HAD NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
HE SAID HE WAS GRATEFUL FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S FIVE CALLS AND SAID 
THE PRESIDENT UNDERSTOOD PAKISTAN\'S DIFFICULTIES. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT:  AT THE END OF THE DAY, NAWAZ FELL VICTIM TO THE 
HARDLINERS BOTH IN THE OPPOSITION AND WITHIN HIS OWN GOVERNMENT WHO 
WERE RELENTLESS IN WHIPPING UP A MEDIA FRENZY DEMANDING A PAKISTANI 
RESPONSE IN KIND.  THERE WERE FEW EFFECTIVE DOMESTIC COUNTERVAILING 
FORCES BUILDING MEDIA AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR RESTRAINT.  NAWAZ\'S 
DECISION TO TEST WAS FUELED BY CONCERNS THAT HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO 
GIVE HIS FRAGMENTED OPPOSITION THE \"NAWAZ-IS-WEAK-ON-INDIA\" ISSUE 
TO COALESCE AROUND IN THEIR BID TO FORCE HIM FROM POWER.  IN HIS 
SPEECH, NAWAZ PLAYED TO PAKISTANI FEARS OF INDIAN EXPANSIONISM AND 
DISTRUST OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW 
LONG PAKISTANIS WILL RALLY AROUND THE FLAG ONCE INTERNATIONAL 
SANCTIONS KICK IN, FURTHER CHALLENGING THIS ALREADY VULNERABLE 
ECONOMY.  NAWAZ\'S NOTION THAT PAKISTANIS WILL \"SACRIFICE\" BY GIVING 
UP LONG CHERISHED \"RIGHTS\" SUCH AS STEALING NATURAL GAS AND 
ELECTRICITY AND AVOIDING TAXES STRIKE US AS MORE WISHFUL THAN 
REALISTIC.  PAKISTANIS HAVE ALWAYS PREFERRED TALKING ABOUT EATING 
GRASS (IN PURSUIT OF NATIONAL SECURITY) RATHER THAN ACTUALLY HAVING 
TO EAT IT.

1. (C)  QAISER BOKHARI, THE LAHORE CHIEF OF THE SHIA TEHRIK-E- 
JAFARIA-E-PAKISTAN (TJP) TOLD POLOFF MAY 26 THAT HE WAS HEADING A 
RELIGIOUS DELEGATION TO IRAN ON MAY 27 FOR ONE WEEK.  THE TRIP OF 
THE MILLI YAKJETI COUNCIL (NATIONAL SOLIDARITY COUNCIL) COMES AT 
THE INVITATION OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT.  LIAQAT BALOCH, THE 
DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE JAMAAT-ISLAMI, PAKISTAN\'S LARGEST ISLAMIST 
PARTY, WILL ATTEND.  MOHAMMAD KHAN LEGHARI, PUNJAB SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE BRELVI JAMIAT-E-ULEMA-E-PAKISTAN (NOORANI FACTION) 
(JUP) AND PIR EJAZ HASHMI, HUMAN RIGHTS ADVISOR TO THE PRIME

NAQSHBANDI AND MAULANA NAEEM ULLAH FAROOQI WILL RESPECTIVELY 
REPRESENT THE FAZL-UR-REHMAN AND SAMI FACTIONS OF THE DEOBANDI (AND 
TRADITIONALLY ANTI-SHIA) JAMIAT-E-ULEMA-E-ISLAM (JUI). AN UNNAMED 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WAHABBI-STYLE JAMAAT AHLE HADITH WILL ALSO 
ATTEND, BUT THE SIPAH-E-SAHABA-E-PAKISTAN, TO WHOM SHIISM IS 
ANATHEMA, ARE NOT GOING.  THE GROUP WILL MEET WITH IRANIAN 
RELIGIOUS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WILL COMMEMORATE THE DEATH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE AYATOLLAH KHOMENI ON JUNE 3.  THE TRIP SUGGESTS 
THAT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT IS SEEKING TO PROMOTE SHIA-SUNNI

PREVIOUSLY. 
 
2. (C)  BOKHARI DOWNPLAYED POLITICAL CONFLICT IN IRAN, 
CHARACTERIZING THE KHAMENI-KHATAMI SPLIT AS \"MINOR.\"  HOWEVER, HE 
FRANKLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF IRAN\'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM.  HE 
BELIEVES THE PROGRAM IS PROCEEDING QUICKLY, THANKS TO FORMER SOVIET 
SCIENTISTS \"PURCHASED\" FROM RUSSIA, UKRAINE, AZERBAIJAN AND 
UZBEKISTAN.  WHILE HE SAID HE HAD NEVER MET SUCH SCIENTISTS, WHO 
ARE KEPT HIDDEN AWAY IN RESEARCH FACILITIES, HE SAID LEADING 
IRANIAN POLITICIANS HAD TOLD HIM THEY WERE PERFORMING WELL. 
 
3. (C)  FOUR TJP ACTIVISTS HAD BEEN KILLED (TWO IN MUZZAFFARGARH 
DISTRICT AND TWO IN MULTAN) SINCE OUR LAST MEETING WITH BOKHARI ON 
APRIL 21. HOWEVER, BOKHARI BELIEVES THAT ONLY ABOUT 20 DANGEROUS 
SUNNI LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI TERRORISTS REMAIN AT LARGE.  BASED ON HIS 
CONVERSATIONS WITH LEADING LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES, HE IS 
OPTIMISTIC THAT THE KILLERS CAN SOON BE CAPTURED OR GUNNED DOWN. 
BOKHARI DID NOT REPEAT ASSERTIONS (REFTEL) THAT THE USG SUPPORTED 
OR SUPPORTS THE LASHKAR-E-JHANGVI.

1. (C) THIS MESSAGE CONVEYS FOR THE RECORD THE TEXT OF PRIME 
MINISTER NAWAZ SHARIF\'S MAY 28 LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON.  THE 
LETTER HAD EARLIER BEEN FAXED TO SA/PAB; THE ORIGINAL IS BEING SENT 
BY POUCH. 
 
2. (C) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
28TH MAY 1998 
HIS EXCELLENCY 
MR. WILLIAM J. CLINTON 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, 
 
I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE PERILOUS 
SITUATION RESULTING FROM INDIA\'S NUCLEAR TESTS.  OUR TELEPHONIC 
CONVERSATIONS IN THE PAST FORTNIGHT CONVINCED ME OF YOUR SINCERITY 
AND YOUR GENUINE CONCERN FOR PAKISTAN\'S SECURITY AND THE STABILITY 
OF THE REGION. 
 
THE OVERT NUCLEAR WEAPONIZATION OF INDIA HAS CREATED A STRATEGIC 
IMBALANCE, EMBOLDENING INDIAN LEADERSHIP TO HOLD OUT THREATS OF 
NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL AGAINST PAKISTAN AND AGGRESSION ACROSS THE LINE 
OF CONTROL IN KASHMIR. 
 
AS ADVISED BY YOU AND OUR OTHER FRIENDS, WE PONDERED HARD AND 
DELIBERATED CAREFULLY ON OUR DIRE SECURITY PREDICAMENT.  DETERMINED 
TO ACT WITH UTMOST RESPONSIBILITY, DESPITE GRAVE PROVOCATIONS, WE 
ALSO CLOSELY EVALUATED THE INTERNATIONAL REACTION, WHICH 
REGRETTABLY DID NOT FACTOR THE THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND TO 
REGIONAL PEACE AND STABILITY. 
 
WHILE I WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PERSONAL UNDERSTANDING OF 
OUR SECURITY CONCERNS, THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO 
INDIA\'S CROSSING OF THE NUCLEAR THRESHOLD WAS REGRETTABLY 
DEFERENTIAL, BORDERING ON ACQUIESCENCE.  WE SAW A FAMILIAR PATTERN, 
WHEREBY INDIA\'S INCREMENTAL STEPS ON THE NUCLEAR AND BALLISTIC 
LADDER HAD ONLY GENERATED PRESSURES AND EVEN PUNITIVE ACTIONS 
AGAINST PAKISTAN. 
 
FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS, PAKISTAN ADVOCATED, IN ALL EARNEST, THE 
GOAL OF NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION.  OUR IMPECCABLE RECORD OF 
RESTRAINT AND RESPONSIBILITY NEVER EARNED US ANY APPROBATION. 
SELECTIVE SANCTIONS ONLY SERVED TO DEGRADE OUR CONVENTIONAL 
CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCED A TOTALLY UNTENABLE SECURITY EQUATION 
BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA. 
 
THE EVIDENT SELECTIVITY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE GLOBAL NON- 
PROLIFERATION GOALS, WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE UNDERLYING SECURITY 
PROBLEMS THAT IMPEL PROLIFERATION, HAD INCENSED OUR PEOPLE. 
 
AT THIS CRITICAL JUNCTURE, AT WHICH OUR VERY LIFE AND EXISTENCE ARE 
AT STAKE, THE PEOPLE OF PAKISTAN WERE UNANIMOUS IN DEMANDING THAT 
WE SEEK TO RECTIFY THE STRATEGIC IMBALANCE RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR 
WEAPONIZATION BY INDIA. 
 
HAVING EXHAUSTED ALL OPTIONS AND LEFT WITH NO CHOICE, WE HAVE IN 
OUR SUPREME NATIONAL INTEREST DECIDED TO EXERCISE THE NUCLEAR 
OPTION.  THIS DECISION, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN WITH A HEAVY HEART, WAS 
NECESSITATED BY THE IMPERATIVES OF SELF-DEFENCE AND TO DETER 
AGGRESSION AGAINST THE SOVEREIGNTY, INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL 
INTEGRITY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
 
WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE NEED FOR URGENT STEPS TO BRING ABOUT NUCLEAR 
STABILIZATION BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA.  I HAVE, THEREFORE, 
OFFERED TO DISCUSS WITH INDIA, ALL ASPECTS OF THE SECURITY 
SITUATION PREVAILING IN THE REGION AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR 
BILATERAL DIALOGUE. 
 
WE TRUST THAT THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER MAJOR POWERS WILL 
ENCOURAGE AND FACILITATE NOT ONLY THE RESUMPTION OF THE PAKISTAN- 
INDIA TALKS BUT EARLY CONCLUSION OF MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE RESTRAINTS, 
ACCOMPANIED BY CONFIDENCE ENHANCING MEASURES. 
 
WE WOULD ALSO URGE YOU TO FULLY ENDORSE AND SUPPORT OUR PROPOSAL 
FOR A NON-AGGRESSION PACT BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND INDIA, ON THE BASIS 
OF AN EXPEDITIOUS SETTLEMENT OF THE JAMMU AND KASHMIR DISPUTE. 
 
I AM ALSO REQUESTING THE LEADERS OF THE OTHER G-8 COUNTRIES TO 
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER COLLECTIVELY INITIATING EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH 
PAKISTAN AND INDIA TO URGENTLY ADDRESS STABILIZATION MEASURES SO AS 
TO PREVENT THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND TO REDUCE THE 
DANGERS OF A NUCLEAR CONFLICT IN SOUTH ASIA.

SUBJECT:  PAKISTAN:  A CONVERSATION WITH BENAZIR BHUTTO 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR. 
REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.   (C)  SUMMARY:  WITH HER RIVAL NAWAZ SHARIF IN DEEP POLITICAL 
TROUBLE, FORMER PRIME MINISTER BENAZIR BHUTTO IS SEEKING TO 
RESHAPE HER IMAGE AND REVIVE HER OWN TATTERED POLITICAL FORTUNES. 
IN A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS ON AUGUST 27, SHE 
CONDEMNED THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE ISLAMIC RIGHT, ADVOCATED 
DRASTICALLY REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT, CALLED FOR THE END 
OF POLITICAL PATRONAGE IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND EXPRESSED 
INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN AN ALL-PARTY CONSENSUS GOVERNMENT 
WHEN AND IF THE NAWAZ REGIME FALLS .  WILLING ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER 
OWN MISTAKES, SHE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PORTRAY HERSELF TO A U.S. 
AUDIENCE AS A MODERATE, SECULAR, PRO-WESTERN ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
CURRENT POLITICAL FORCES AT LARGE IN THE COUNTRY.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.   QNGERS FROM THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  ALTHOUGH NO 
FRIEND OF NAWAZ SHARIF, BENAZIR EXPRESSED DEEP CONCERN THAT THE 
POLITICAL WEAKNESS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT, DESPITE ITS 
OVERWHELMING PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY, WAS PLAYING INTO THE HANDS 
OF THE EXTREMIST ISLAMIC RELIGIOUS PARTIES, PREEMINENTLY THE 
JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND THE JAMAAT-ULEMA-I-ISLAMI.  SHE FEARED THAT, 
IF THE SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMY BEGAN TO BRING PEOPLE OUT 
INTO THE STREETS, THESE ELEMENTS WOULD MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH 
SYMPATHETIC RETIRED GENERALS FROM THE ZIA ERA TO SPEARHEAD A 
FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC TAKEOVER.  SHE NOTED THAT THE NEWSPAPERS 
WERE FULL OF ARTICLES BY INFLUENTIAL FORMER GENERALS MAKING 
COMMON CAUSE WITH THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT.  (COMMENT:  WE DOUBT SHE 
REALLY BELIEVES THAT HEADLINE-GRABBERS SUCH AS FORMER COAS MIRZA 
ALSAM BEG AND FORMER DG/ISI HAMEED GUL ARE A THREAT.) 
 
3.   (C)  ON THE ARMY.  BENAZIR SAID SHE THOUGHT THERE WERE ALSO 
PLENTY OF ACTIVE DUTY MID-LEVEL ARMY OFFICERS SYMPATHETIC TO THE 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST CAUSE.  THE TOP ARMY LEADERSHIP, HOWEVER, 
REMAINED SOLID AND MODERATE.  INDEED, SHE CONCEDED THAT ARMY 
INTERVENTION OF SOME SORT COULD BE THE ONLY WAY TO AVERT A 
FUNDAMENTALIST TAKEOVER IF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO CRUMBLE. 
SHE THOUGHT THE ARMY COULD PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE BY SETTING UP A 
TECHNOCRATIC GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM 
ALL MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES, INCLUDING HER OWN PPP AND NAWAZ\'S 
PML (WITHOUT NAWAZ, OF COURSE).  BUT SHE WAS HIGHLY SKEPTICAL 
THAT THE ARMY COULD RULE EFFECTIVELY ON ITS OWN BASED ON ITS PAST 
PERFORMANCE. 
 
4.   (C) ON NAWAZ.  BENAZIR MADE NO EFFORT TO HIDE HER DISLIKE OF 
NAWAZ SHARIF, WHOM SHE REGARDED AS BOTH WEAK AND NOT VERY BRIGHT. 
SHE APPEARED TO HARBOR AN EVEN GREATER DISLIKE FOR HIS BROTHER 
SHAHBAZ, WHO SHE CHARACTERIZED AS MORE INTELLIGENT, BUT ALSO MORE 
BRUTAL, RELATING A BRIEF ANECDOTE ABOUT HOW HE HAD ORDERED A 
HAPLESS BUREAUCRAT THROWN INTO A SEWER IN A MOMENT OF PERSONAL 
PIQUE.  INTERESTINGLY, SHE WAS INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE NAWAZ\'S 
GROWING FLIRTATION WITH ISLAMIZATION TO HIS OWN LIGHTS RATHER 
THAN SIMPLY TO POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM.  SHE CONTENDED THAT NAWAZ\'S 
FATHER HAD BEEN VERY CLOSE TO \"TALIBANISH\" (HER WORD) ULEMA 
(RELIGIOUS LEADERS) IN LAHORE AND HAD INCULCATED THESE SORTS OF 
VALUES IN THE YOUNG NAWAZ.  SHE SAID THAT NAWAZ HAD DONE THE SAME 
TO HIS OWN SON, NOTING THAT THE YOUNGER SHARIF HAD REFUSED TO 
GIVE HIS AGE WHEN INTERVIEWED RECENTLY ON TELEVISION IN KEEPING 
WITH A CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC SUPERSTITION. 
 
5.   (C) ON HER OWN MISTAKES.  ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD DO 
DIFFQHAD IT TO DO ALL OVER AGAIN, BENAZIR SAID SQ 
WOULD ENDED THE PATRONAGE SYSTEM THAT LAID THE BASIS FOR THE 
WIDESPREAD PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF HER AS CORRUPT.  SHE LAMENTED 
THAT THERE HAD DEVELOPED IN PAKISTAN A SYSTEM IN WHICH EACH 
INCOMING GOVERNMENT PACKED THE CIVIL SERVICE WITH ITS OWN 
CRONIES.  THIS WAS A RECIPE FOR BOTH INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION. 
SHE HAD BEEN AS GUILTY OF THE PRACTICE AS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT 
LEADER BUT NO MORE SO.  SHE NOTED THAT SHE HAD YET TO BE 
CONVICTED ON ANY CORRUPTION CHARGE DESPITE TWO YEARS OF 
GOVERNMENT DIGGING.  NONETHELESS, THE PRACTICE OF PATRONAGE WAS 
DESTRUCTIVE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BY AN 
INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL CIVIL SERVICE.  THIS WOULD BE A KEY 
ELEMENT OF HER POLICY WERE SHE EVER TO RETURNQT: DURING THIS 
EXCHANGE, SHE DID NOT MENTION HER HUSBAND, 
WHO WAS HER CHIEF BAG MAN AND PATRONAGE DISPENSER.) 
 
6.   (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FAILINGS OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT. 
HER CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC POLICIES WAS STANDARD FARE. 
SHE SAID THE EFFORT TO FORCE THE INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS 
(IPPS) TO RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS SIGNED BY HER REGIME HAD HAD 
A CHILLING EFFECT ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT.  IT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR 
GOVERNMENTS TO HONOR THE AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THEIR PREDECESSORS 
EVEN IF THEY DID NOT LIKE THE TERMS.  OTHERWISE, THE 
PREDICTABILITY AND CONFIDENCE SO ESSENTIAL TO ATTRACTING FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT WOULD BE LACKING.  BENAZIR WAS ALSO HIGHLY CRITICAL OF 
THE GOVERNMENT DECISION TO FREEZE HARD CURRENCY ACCOUNTS IN THE 
WAKE OF ITS NUCLEAR TESTS.  SHE BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO 
CLUE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION SAVE FOR 
BEGGING FROM RICH ARAB NEIGHBORS AND THROWING ITSELF ON THE MERCY 
OF THE IMF. 
 
7.   (C) ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HER OWN PROGRAM.  IN ADDITION TO 
PROFESSIONALIZING THE CIVIL SERVICE, BENAZIR SAID SHE STRONGLY 
FAVORED DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS.  GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
ENTERPRISES SHOULD BE SOLD OFF AND THE NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT 
MINISTRIES AND BUREAUCRATS SHARPLY REDUCED.  THE MILITARY BUDGET 
WOULD ALSO NEED TO BE REDUCED.  PAKISTAN COULD NOT PRETEND TO 
MATCH INDIA SOLDIER FOR SOLDIER AND MACHINE FOR MACHINE AND WOULD 
NEED TO TAILOR ITS FOREIGN POLICY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS REALITY. 
AS FOR THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT, SHE SAID SHE FAVORED SHUTTING DOWN 
THE MADARASSA SCHOOLS THAT WERE CHURNING OUT SO MANY YOUNG 
FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HER BASIC THEME, HOWEVER, WAS THAT THE BEST WAY 
TO COMBAT FUNDAMENTALISM WAS TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMY BY ENDING 
CORRUPTION, DOWNSIZING GOVERNMENT AND ATTRACTING FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT. 
 
8.   (C) ON RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AND THE WEST.  BENAZIR TOLD 
POLCOUNS SHE HAD SEEN PRESS REPORTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD 
AGREED TO SIGN THE CTBT DURING THE SHAMSHAD-TALBOTT TALKS IN 
LONDON ON AUGUST 25.  SHE HOPED THIS WAS TRUE, SINCE PAKISTAN 
COULD NOT AFFORD A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE WITH INDIA OR BAD RELATIONS 
WITH THE UNITED STATES.  SHE SAID THAT ONE POSITIVE RESULT 
FLOWING FROM THE MAY NUCLEAR TESTS WAS ITS IMPACT ON THE U.S. 
THE TESTS HAD FORCED THE UNITED STATES TO PAY GREATER ATTENTION 
TO PAKISTAN.  PAKISTAN NEEDED ACTIVE U.S. ENGAGEMENT AND SHE 
HOPED THE UNITED STATES WOULD CONTINUE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN 
THE REGION. 
 
9.   (C) ON THE TALIBAN AND BIN LADEN.  BENAZIR SAID SHE HAD 
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE EAST AFRICA BOMBINGS AND WAS STRONGLY 
OPPOSED TO TERRORISM OF ANY KIND.  BUT SHE FELT THE U.S. SHOULD 
HAVE PURSUED USAMA BIN LADEN THROUGH THE UN PROCESS IN THE FIRST 
INSTANCE, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE AUGUST 20 CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES 
HAD ALIENATED PUBLIC OPINION THROUGHOUT THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  SHE 
SAID SHE WAS NO FAN OF THE TALIBAN, WHOM SHE VIEWED AS AN 
EXTENSION OF THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  INDEED, SHE WAS 
FEARFUL THAT RETURNING TALIBAN MIGHT SERVE AS FOOT SOLDIERS FOR 
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISTS IN A FUTURE CONFRONTATION WITH AUTHORITIES. 
 
10.  (C) ON WHAT IS GOING RIGHT IN PAKISTAN.  DESPITE HER 
OPPOSITION TO THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AND FEAR OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM, BENAZIR SAID SHE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN MANY 
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN PAKISTAN IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE THE 
DEATH OF ZIA (AUGUST 17, 1988) AND RETURN OF DEMOCRACY.  ALTHOUGH 
SHE HAD FELT ITS STING MORE THAN ANY OTHER PAKISTANI POLITICIAN, 
SHE WAS PROUD OF THE FACT THAT PAKISTAN HAD DEVELOPED A 
REMARKABLY FREE PRESS, WHICH SHE BELIEVED WAS AN ESSENTIAL 
UNDERPINNING OF GENUINE DEMOCRACY.  SHE SAID SHE ALSO BELIEVED 
THAT THE JUDICIARY HAD ACHIEVED A LARGE MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE, 
ALTHOUGH IT REMAINED UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM POLITICAL 
AUTHORITIES.  SHE ALSO THOUGHT THAT ORDINARY PAKISTANIS HAD BEGUN 
TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND TO QUESTION WHAT THEY WERE TOLD BY 
THE GOVERNMENT AND BY POLITICIANS RATHER THAN PASSIVELY ACCEPT 
SIMPLISTIC SLOGANS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY THE CASE. 
 
11.  (C) ON HER CURRENT POLITICAL SITUATION.  BENAZIR SAID SHE 
THOUGHT THE WEAKNESS OF THE NAWAZ GOVERNMENT HAD IMPROVED HER OWN 
POLITICAL POSITION IN THE COUNTRY.  SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS STRONG IN 
RURAL AREAS, BUT REMAINED WEAK IN URBAN PUNJAB.  SHE RUED THE 
FACT THAT THE ELECTORAL WEAKNESS OF HER OWN PPP PARTY (REDUCED IN 
THE LAST ELECTION TO ITS SINDHI BASE) HAD FORCED HER TO MAKE 
COMMON CAUSE WITH SOME OF THE SMALLER, MORE EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS 
PARTIES UNDER THE  PAKISTAN AWAMI ITIHAT (PAI) UMBRELLA.  BUT SHE 
FELT THAT HER PARTY WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO CARRY THE BURDEN OF 
OPPOSITION ON ITS OWN.  MORE RECENTLY, SHE HAD ALSO BEGAN 
REACHING OUT TO SOME OF THE NATIONALIST REGIONAL PARTIES, SUCH AS 
THE NORTHWEST FRONTIER PROVINCE-BASED ANP.  HOWEVER, WHEN ASKED 
HOW SHE COULD MANEUVER FROM WHERE SHE WAS NOW BACK INTO A 
POSITION OF POWER HER ONLY COMMENT WAS A RUEFUL \"THAT IS THE 64 
DOLLAR QUESTION.\" 
 
12.  (C) COMMENT.  BENAZIR WAS RELAXED AND TALKATIVE DURING A 
CONVERSATION THAT STRETCHED ON FOR NINETY MINUTES.  HER COMMENTS 
WERE CLEARLY CALCULATED TO GO DOWN WELL WITH AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE 
AND SHE CLEARLY SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING HERSELF AS A MODERATE, 
SECULAR, MORE WESTERN-ORIENTED ALTERNATIVE TO THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT AND ITS EVEN MORE FUNDAMENTALIST FOES.  SHE HAS 
RECENTLY TURNED FOR ADVICE TO A MODERATE FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, 
RETIRED GENERAL TALAT MASOOD, WHO IS NOTED FOR PROMOTING THE NEED 
FOR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION-BUILDING IN PAKISTAN.  AS FOR WHETHER 
BENAZIR BELIEVES WHAT SHE IS SAYING, THAT IS HARD TO SAY.  HER 
BEST CHANCE OF ONE DAY RETURNING TO POWER IS ALMOST CERTAINLY AS 
PART OF A COALITION RATHER THAN ON HER OWN.  THAT MIGHT NOT BE A 
BAD THING, GIVEN THAT, LEFT STRICTLY TO HER OWN DEVICES, SHE 
WOULD REMAIN BEHOLDEN TO THE LANDLORDS OF HER FEUDAL SINDH BASE, 
AND THESE ARE NOT THE SORT OF PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENDING 
PATRONAGE AND PROMOTING INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRATIC REFORMS.  END 
COMMENT.

REF: LAHORE 500 
 
CLASSIFIED BY LAHORE PRINCIPAL OFFICER GEOFFREY PYATT, REASON 1.5 (D) 
 
THIS IS LAHORE 572 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  MEETING OCTOBER 14 WITH VISITING AMBASSADOR 
MILAM, PUNJAB CHIEF MINISTER SHAHBAZ SHARIF EMPHASIZED HIS 
BROTHER\'S COMMITMENT TO FINDING COMMON GROUND WITH THE UNITED 
STATES ON PROLIFERATION ISSUES, JUSTIFIED THE RECENT REDUCTION OF 
ELECTRICITY TARIFFS AS A POLITICAL IMPERATIVE, AND DEFENDED THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT AS A POLITICAL TACTIC THAT 
WOULD NOT ALTER PAKISTAN\'S HISTORICALLY MODERATE COURSE.  SHAHBAZ 
RECALLED HIS MID-AUGUST MEETINGS WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT 
AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN WASHINGTON, AND CLAIMED THAT GOVERNMENT 
ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE ROADMAP WHICH HE 
HAD DISCUSSED.  HE PROMISED IMMEDIATE PROGRESS ON EXPORT CONTROLS 
BUT INDICATED THAT FURTHER MOVEMENT TOWARDS A FISSILE MATERIAL 
CUT-OFF WOULD REQUIRE STEPS TO REDRESS THE INHERENT IMBALANCE OF 
THE INDO-PAK SECURITY RELATIONSHIP.  IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE, THE 
AMBASSADOR RAISED THE OSAMA BIN LADEN ISSUE IN AFGHANISTAN, URGED 
SHAHBAZ TO SPEAK TO THE PM ABOUT INCREASING GOP EFFORTS TO 
PERSUADE THE TALEBAN TO EXPEL OBL AND ABOUT THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY\'S RELUCTANCE TO ALLOW THE AMBASSADOR TO ENGAGE THE PM ON 
AFGHANISTAN.  SHAHBAZ AGREED TO TALK TO THE PM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
THE WAY FORWARD ON NON-PROLIFERATION 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C) AFTER A FOREIGN MINISTRY NOTETAKER WAS ESCORTED OUT OF THE 
MEETING, SHAHBAZ SPOKE CANDIDLY AND AT LENGTH ABOUT THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S PRIORITIES AND ITS HOPES FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE CAN\'T CHANGE HISTORY, THE CHIEF 
MINISTER LAMENTED, BUT CLEARLY WE NEED TO GET BACK ON COURSE TO 
FOCUS ON PAKISTAN\'S URGENT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC NEEDS. 
 
3. (C) RECALLING HIS LATE SUMMER MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, SHAHBAZ 
ARGUED THAT GOP ACTIONS SINCE THEN HAVE FOLLOWED PRECISELY THE 
\"ROAD MAP\" THAT HE HAD DISCUSSED WITH DEPUTY SECRETARY TALBOTT. 
WE RECOGNIZE THERE IS MORE FOR US TO DO, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  SOME 
STEPS, SUCH AS ENHANCING EXPORT CONTROLS, WE WOULD TAKE EVEN 
WITHOUT YOUR PRESSURE.  THIS IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL.  OTHER STEPS, 
INCLUDING THE FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF, REQUIRE THAT WE FIRST 
DETERMINE HOW TO ACHIEVE MINIMUM DETERRENCE VIS-A-VIS INDIA.  WE 
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT INDIA IS THE AGGRESSOR WHICH STARTED THE 
CYCLE OF NUCLEAR TESTING.  IT FRUSTRATES US, SHAHBAZ ADDED, THAT 
FRIENDS LIKE THE UNITED STATES SOMETIMES APPEAR TO OVERLOOK THIS 
BASIC FACT.  WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING IN GENEVA, BUT UNCONDITIONAL 
PAKISTANI ADHERENCE TO THE FMCT IS A PROBLEM.  WE MUST FIND A WAY 
TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCKPILES AND BRING SOME FORM OF PARITY TO OUR 
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA, SHAHBAZ CONCLUDED. 
 
4. (C) THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE ARE THREE 
PARTNERS IN THESE DELIBERATIONS, AMBASSADOR MILAM RESPONDED.  BUT 
WE THINK FMCT IS THE RIGHT WAY FORWARD.  BOTH PAKISTAN AND INDIA 
NEED TO BRING TRANSPARENCY TO THEIR NUCLEAR POLICIES.  SHAHBAZ 
AGAIN CAME BACK TO THE POLITICS OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION DEBATE. 
NAWAZ SHARIF MUST BE SEEN TO BE DEFENDING PAKISTAN\'S SUPREME 
NATIONAL INTERESTS.  FOR THAT REASON, SHAHBAZ ARGUED, WHATEVER 
STEPS ARE REQUIRED AND WHATEVER INDUCEMENTS THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY PROVIDES MUST BE VIEWED AS EQUITABLE AND FAIR. 
 
 
SOUTH ASIA\'S KOSOVO 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) SHAHBAZ TURNED TO THE BROADER ISSUE OF INDO-PAK RELATIONS, 
NOTING THAT \"WE\'D BE LIVING IN A FOOLS PARADISE\" TO SEEK PROGRESS 
ON NON-PROLIFERATION WHILE IGNORING THE CONFRONTATION OVER 
KASHMIR.  THIS WAS NOT WHAT INDIA AND PAKISTAN WERE MEANT TO BE, 
SHAHBAZ CONTINUED, FIGHTING PROXY WARS AND SQUANDERING EACH 
OTHER\'S ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  LOOK AT TRADE.  THINK HOW MUCH WE 
COULD SAVE IF PAKISTAN WERE ABLE TO BUY COAL FROM INDIAN MINES 
INSTEAD OF IMPORTING IT FROM THE AMERICAS.  BUT THAT\'S JUST NOT 
POSSIBLE UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE CAN MOVE THE 
RELATIONSHIP TO A NEW LEVEL, BUT WE NEED YOU TO THROW YOUR WEIGHT 
BEHIND A SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR DISPUTE.  AS YOU HAVE DONE 
WITH THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO, THE UNITED STATES MUST BRING IT\'S 
AUTHORITY TO BEAR ON THE KASHMIR DISPUTE. 
 
 
THE POWER IMBROGLIO 
------------------- 
 
6. (C) AMBASSADOR MILAM RAISED THE ISSUE OF INDEPENDENT POWER 
PROVIDERS (IPP\'S), NOTING OUR PUZZLEMENT ABOUT THE REDUCTION IN 
CONSUMER ELECTRICITY RATES COMING IN THE MIDST OF DIFFICULT 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE IMF.  WE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REDUCE 
ELECTRICITY TARIFFS, SHAHBAZ INSISTED.   FROM KHYBER TO KARACHI, 
PAKISTANIS WERE CLAMORING FOR RELIEF FROM UTILITY BILLS THAT WERE 
CONSUMING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR DISPOSABLE INCOMES.  PEOPLE 
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.  THIS GOVERNMENT HAS 
NO INTENTION OF REVERSING THE MARKET-ORIENTED DIRECTION THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER SET IN HIS FIRST MONTHS; THAT\'S NOT EVEN AN 
PEOPLE A SENSE OF HOPE. 
 
 
THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) AS THE CONVERSATION DREW TO A CLOSE, THE CHIEF MINISTER 
RAISED THE GOVERNMENT\'S CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON 
ISLAMIZATION.  YOU HAVEN\'T BROUGHT IT UP, SO I WILL, SHAHBAZ 
NOTED.  THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT\'S WESTERN, 
LIBERAL ORIENTATION.  THAT\'S WHY I\'VE BEEN WEARING ALL MY OLD 
WESTERN BUSINESS SUITS, HE JOKED, INSTEAD OF THE SHALWAR THAT 
MOST PAKISTANI POLITICIANS TREAT AS THEIR UNIFORM.  SHAHBAZ ALSO 
DREW ATTENTION HIS OCTOBER 14 SPEECH AT A WOMEN\'S ASSOCIATION 
MEETING IN LAHORE WHERE HE HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE THAT FEMALE 
MANAGERS, ADMINISTRATORS AND SCIENTISTS MUST PLAY IN PAKISTAN\'S 
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.  CAN WE THINK OF DEVELOPMENT INVOLVING WOMEN 
WHO WEAR A VEIL OR SIT AT HOME, SHAHBAZ ASKED IN HIS SPEECH. 
IT\'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE. 
 
8. (U) THERE SHOULD BE NO MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT OUR REASONS FOR 
ADVANCING THE 15TH AMENDMENT, SHAHBAZ CONTINUED.  AFTER WESTERN 
PRESSURE ON CTBT AND THE AIR STRIKES ON AFGHANISTAN, THE 
RELIGIOUS PARTIES WERE RIDING HIGH.  BUT THIS ONE ACTION OF 
INTRODUCING THE ISLAMIZATION AMENDMENT HAS TAKEN THE WIND OUT OF 
THEIR SAILS. 
 
9.  (C) IN A BRIEF ONE-ON-ONE THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED HIS 
INCREASING PREOCCUPATION WITH AFGHANISTAN, AND ESPECIALLY THE 
ISSUE OF THE TALEBAN HARBORING OSAMA BIN LADEN.  THIS IS A VERY 
BIG ISSUE TO THE U.S., AND OUR SENSE IS THAT, PERHAPS, WITH ADDED 
PUSH THE U.S., PAKISTAN AND SAUDI ARABIA CAN PERSUADE THE TALEBAN 
TO EXPEL OBL.  WE NEED A STRONGER PUSH ON THIS BY THE GOP.  THE 
AMBASSADOR HAD TRIED TO SEE THE PM ON THIS BUT WAS BEING SCREENED 
OFF BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED SHAHBAZ TO 
TALK TO THE PM ABOUT THIS.  THE CHIEF MINISTER SAID HE WOULD. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) IN BOTH THIS MEETING AND A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH WITH HIS 
SENIOR ADVISORS, SHAHBAZ DISPLAYED THE MIXTURE OF IMPATIENCE AND 
REFORMIST ZEAL THAT HAVE BECOME HIS HALLMARK.  COMPARED EVEN TO 
THE LAST MEETING WITH HIM IN LATE AUGUST (REFTEL), WE FOUND HIM 
MORE CONVERSANT AND MORE WILLING TO VENTURE AN OPINION ON THE 
SECURITY ISSUES THAT FORM THE CORE OF THE U.S.-PAKISTAN BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  IMPLICIT IN THE SCOPE OF OUR TWO HOUR CONVERSATION 
AND LUNCH WAS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WITHOUT PROGRESS ON NON- 
PROLIFERATION AND THE RELATED SANCTIONS, THE EXPERIMENT IN LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT REFORM THAT SHAHBAZ HAS LAUNCHED IN PUNJAB (LIKE THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ITSELF) MAY COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND. END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: FUNDAMENTALISM AND SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN 
AND THE TALIBAN IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE (C-NA8-01076) 
 
REFS:  (A) STATE 190698, (B) ISLAMABAD 7155 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. SCHMIDT, POLITICAL COUNSELOR.  REASON 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH A SAMPLING OF RURAL 
PUNJABI POLITICIANS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT RECRUITMENT TO MILITANT 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS IS INCREASING IN POORER AREAS OF THE PUNJABI 
COUNTRYSIDE (PRIMARILY SOUTHERN PUNJAB), BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE 
THAT A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF 
DEVELOPING.  THESE SAME SOURCES ALSO CONTEND THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN 
AND THE TALIBAN ARE HIGHLY POPULAR AMONG POORLY EDUCATED PEOPLE 
IN RURAL AREAS (AND PROBABLY URBAN AREAS AS WELL).  SUCH 
POPULARITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED, BUT 
EXISTS AT THE LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, REFLECTING THE NEED FOR 
SUCCESSFUL ROLE MODELS ON THE PART OF ORDINARY MUSLIMS FED UP 
WITH THE FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO MEET 
BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL A, POLCOUNS HAS RECENTLY SPOKEN 
WITH THREE PML MNAS REPRESENTING RURAL CONSTITUENCIES IN THE 
PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE.  THE THREE ARE MUMTAZ AHMED TARAR, A NAWAZ 
SHARIF LOYALIST WHO SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC 
SERVICES COMMITTEE, COL (R) GHULAM SARWAR CHEEMA, A PARTY 
SWITCHING FORMER PPP MINISTER OF STATE WHO NOW SERVES AS CHAIRMAN 
OF THE ASSEMBLY DEFENSE COMMITTEE, AND SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN 
TAMMAN, A LIBERAL-MINDED MNA NOW SERVING AS CHAIRMAN OF THE 
FINANCE COMMITTEE, TO WHOM POLCOUNS PAID A REPEAT VISIT.  THE 
SUBJECT WAS SUPPORT FOR ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM AND THE TALIBAN IN 
THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE. 
 
3.  (C) IN THE JUDGMENT OF POLCOUNS, TARAR WAS THE MOST 
COMPELLING WITNESS.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION, HE CONTENDED 
THAT ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM (DEFINED AS SUPPORT FOR MILITANT 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS) IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ONLY IN RURAL 
DISTRICTS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE LANDHOLDINGS (I.E., QUASI-FEUDAL 
AREAS), WHERE THERE WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVES AND HAVE 
NOTS.  THE ECONOMIC DISPARITY IN THESE REGIONS HELPED TO FUEL 
EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES.  HE CITED THE MULTAN, BAHAWALPUR, 
MIANWALI AND SARGHODA AREAS AS EXAMPLES.  IN OTHER DISTRICTS, 
WHERE SMALL LANDHOLDERS PREVAIL AND THERE IS A FUNCTIONING MIDDLE 
CLASS, THERE ARE FEWER SOCIAL TENSIONS AND EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS 
ATTITUDES ARE HELD BY ONLY BY A FEW.  HIS OWN DISTRICT, MANDI 
BAHAUDIN IN CENTRAL PUNJAB, FELL INTO THE LATTER CATEGORY.  LESS 
THAN ONE PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BELONGED TO MILITANT GROUPS, 
USUALLY THE SUNNI SECTARIAN SIPAH-E-SAHABA PAKISTAN (SSP). 
 
4.  (C) TARAR SAID THE CASE WAS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO 
SUPPORT FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE BELIEVED THAT 
UPWARDS OF NINETY PERCENT OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN HIS DISTRICT 
AND, INDEED, THROUGHOUT URBAN AND RURAL PUNJAB, HAVE A HIGHLY 
FAVORABLE OPINION OF BOTH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN.  HE OPINED 
THAT BIN LADEN IS THE HERO OF THE MOMENT IN PAKISTAN AND WOULD 
WIN ANY ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO ANY 
WELLSPRING OF FUNDAMENTALIST RELIGIOUS SUPPORT.  HIS OWN 
CONSTITUENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE NOT PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS.  IT 
WAS DUE RATHER TO THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN 
APPEARED TO ORDINARY FOLK AS ISLAMIC HEROES WHO HAD NOT ONLY 
STOOD UP TO THE ANTI-ISLAMIC WEST BUT WERE SUCCESSFUL IN SO 
DOING.  THIS WAS A HEADY CONTRAST TO THE PERCEIVED INEFFECTUALITY 
OF THEIR OWN LEADERS. 
 
5.  (C) TARAR ADDED THAT SUPPORT FOR THE 15TH AMENDMENT WAS 
SIMILARLY WIDESPREAD IN HIS DISTRICT.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO 
RELIGIOUS CONVICTION, BUT BECAUSE HIS CONSTITUENTS BELIEVED THAT 
IT WOULD EMPOWER THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING SWIFT JUSTICE AND LAW 
AND ORDER TO THE COUNTRY.  DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF BIN LADEN 
AND THE TALIBAN IN RURAL AREAS, TARAR SAW LITTLE DANGER THAT 
PEOPLE FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE COULD BE PERSUADED TO TAKE MILITANT 
ACTION.  THEY WERE INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE 
AND TOO REMOVED FROM THE CENTERS OF POWER.  HIS OWN CONSTITUENTS 
WERE MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON OBTAINING GOVERNMENT LOANS WHICH COULD 
BE USED TO PAY AGENTS TO SMUGGLE THEM INTO WESTERN COUNTRIES.  HE 
ESTIMATED THAT FIVE TO TEN PERCENT OF HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE 
WORKING OR HAD WORKED ABROAD.  THE REAL DANGER CAME FROM THE 
URBAN AREAS, WHERE THERE WAS A MUCH LARGER CADRE OF 
FUNDAMENTALIST RABBLE ROUSERS WHO COULD POTENTIALLY MOBILIZE 
LARGE NUMBERS OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE. 
 
6.  (C) THE URBANE, HIGHLY POLISHED COL CHEEMA REPRESENTS A RURAL 
PUNJABI CONSTITUENCY NEAR GUJRANWALA AND OWNS PROPERTY IN THREE 
OTHERS (NEAR LAHORE, FAISALABAD AND JHANG).  HE WAS MUCH MORE 
IMPRESSIONISTIC AND LESS SPECIFIC IN HIS OWN VIEWS ABOUT 
FUNDAMENTALISM IN RURAL PUNJAB.  HIS OWN BELIEF WAS THAT THE 
FAILURE OF SUCCESSIVE GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE THE LOT OF THE 
PEOPLE HAD DESTROYED THE FAITH OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS IN THE 
ABILITY OF THE TRADITIONAL POLITICAL CLASS (MILITARY AND 
CIVILIAN) TO PROVIDE GOOD GOVERNMENT AND SATISFY BASIC ECONOMIC 
AND SOCIAL NEEDS.  THIS, IN TURN, HAD MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE 
TO ALTERNATIVE MESSAGES, SUCH AS THOSE CONVEYED TWO DECADES AGO 
BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION AND, MORE RECENTLY, BY THE TALIBAN. 
 
7.  (C) RICH WITH ANECDOTES, HE TOLD THE STORY OF AN ELDERLY 
WOMAN WHO HAD COME TO HIM FOR HELP DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HIS 
DISTRICT.  ALTHOUGH THE ONLY ELECTRICAL ITEM IN HER ONE ROOM 
HOUSE WAS A LIGHT BULB HER BILL AMOUNTED TO 3000 RUPEES (60 
DOLLARS, A FORMIDABLE SUM).  ALTHOUGH SHE HAD A FAN, SHE COULD 
NOT AFFORD TO RUN IT.  CHEEMA SAID THAT, WHILE HE HAD MANAGED TO 
GET HER BILL REDUCED TO 2500 RUPEES, THE WOMAN WAS TYPICAL OF THE 
CASES HE GETS DURING HIS WEEKLY AUDIENCES WITH CONSTITUENTS.  HIS 
CONSTITUENTS WERE BENDING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF INCREASING POVERTY, 
WHICH MADE THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS MESSAGES. 
 
8.  (C) CHEEMA ALSO BEMOANED THE MANY FUNDAMENTALIST MADRASSAS 
(RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS) THAT HAD SPRUNG UP RECENTLY.  HE TOLD THE 
STORY OF THE SON OF A CONSTITUENT WHO HAD BEEN PERSUADED TO DROP 
OUT OF STANFORD BY A VISITING PAKISTANI \"TABLIGHI\" (LAY ISLAMIC 
PROSELYTIZER) AND RETURN TO PAKISTAN TO ENROLL IN A MADRASSA NEAR 
LAHORE.  HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN LOST TO HIS FAMILY, WHO 
STRUGGLED TO GAIN PERMISSION TO SEE HIM AND RECEIVED FOR THEIR 
TROUBLES A PERFUNCTORY HELLO AND GOOD-BYE.  HIS SENSE WAS THAT 
RECRUITMENT TO RADICAL MADRASSAS HAD BEEN SHARPLY ON THE INCREASE 
RECENTLY, SERVING AS A MAGNET FOR DISAFFECTED YOUTH.  MUHAMMAD 
KHALID MASUD, PROFESSOR OF ISLAMIC LAW AT THE INTERNATIONAL 
ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY, ECHOED THIS IN A CONVERSATION WITH POLCOUNS 
ON OCTOBER 24 CONTENDING THAT EXTREMIST VIEWS WERE COMING TO 
DOMINATE THE ENTIRE MADRASSA SYSTEM. 
 
9.  (C) CHEEMA SAID IT WAS HIS SENSE THAT SUCH TRENDS WERE 
FRAYING AT THE VERY FABRIC OF PAKISTANI SOCIETY, CAUSING THE 
COUNTRY TO BEGIN COMING APART AT THE SEAMS.  SWITCHING METAPHORS, 
HE LIKENED PAKISTAN TO A DRIED OUT BALE OF HAY THAT NEEDED ONLY 
THE SLIGHTEST OF SPARKS TO SET IT ALIGHT.  NOTING THE SHARP 
INCREASE IN SECTARIAN VIOLENCE AND APPEARANCE OF MYRIAD SECTS ALL 
HOLDING THEIR OWN MONOPOLIES ON THE TRUTH, HE FEARED THAT ONCE 
THE SPARK WAS LIT ALL THESE GROUPS WOULD BE AT EACH OTHERS 
THROATS.  LOOKING AT POLCOUNS RUEFULLY, HE COMMENTED THAT WHILE 
POLCOUNS WOULD SERVE IN PAKISTAN FOR ONLY A YEAR OR TWO, HE AND 
HIS COUNTRYMEN WERE CONDEMNED TO REMAIN BEHIND. 
 
10.  (C) IN ADDITION TO MEETING WITH TARAR AND CHEEMA, POLCOUNS 
ALSO PAID A RETURN VISIT TO SARDAR MANSOOR HAYAT KHAN TAMMAN, WHO 
HAD EARLIER REPORTED A SHARP INCREASE IN FUNDAMENTALISM AND PRO- 
TALIBAN SENTIMENT IN HIS RURAL PUNJABI DISTRICT (REFTEL B). 
TAMMAN DID NO BACKING AWAY FROM HIS EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT 
FUNDAMENTALISM TAKING HOLD IN HIS DISTRICT.  HE SAID THE POVERTY 
IN HIS DISTRICT HAD HELPED ATTRACT CONVERTS TO RADICAL RELIGIOUS 
GROUPS.  AKRAM AWAN, A MIDDLE CLASS LANDLORD AND FOUNDER OF THE 
RADICAL AKHAN UL MUSLIMIN PARTY, ALSO HAILS FROM HIS DISTRICT. 
LIKE TARAR HE ALSO OBSERVED THAT, SINCE THE U.S. CRUISE MISSILE 
STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN, THE FORMERLY UNKNOWN OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD 
BECOME A CELEBRITY AND SOMETHING OF A FOLK HERO AMONG THE 
ORDINARY PEOPLE IN HIS DISTRICT. 
 
11.  (C) SOME OF THE ABOVE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN ALSO BEEN NOTED 
BY CONSULATE LAHORE.  PO WAS STRUCK BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF FLAGS, 
BANNERS AND SLOGANS FOR THE JIHADIST LASHKAR-E-TAIBA (LT) HE 
NOTED IN SAHIWAL DISTRICT DURING A RECENT VISIT TO HARAPPA.  THIS 
GROUP SPECIALIZES IN RECRUITING YOUNG PUNJABIS TO FIGHT IN 
KASHMIR.  CONSULATE CONTACTS HAVE ALSO NOTED A CONTINUING 
STRENGTHENING IN SUPPORT FOR THE SSP IN RURAL PARTS OF KHANEWAL, 
TOBA TEK SINGH AND MULTAN DISTRICTS.  THE SSP ALSO RECENTLY 
CAPTURED CONTROL OF THE JHANG MUNICIPALITY (ITS URBAN BIRTHPLACE) 
ALTHOUGH THE RURAL JHANG HINTERLAND REMAINS FIRMLY UNDER THE 
CONTROL OF THE LOCAL SHIA LANDLORD.  ACCORDING TO CONSULATE 
LAHORE, MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE SSP AND THE LT APPEAR TO BE 
EXPANDING THEIR SUPPORT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL 
RELIGIOUS PARTIES, SUCH AS JAMAAT-I-ISLAMI AND JAMAAT-ULEMA-I- 
ISLAM. 
 
12.  (C) COMMENT: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BUILD A CLEAR PICTURE 
OF POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ATTITUDES IN THE PUNJABI COUNTRYSIDE 
BASED ON A SMALL HANDFUL OF CONVERSATIONS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE A MASS FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT 
DEVELOPING IN THE RURAL AREAS.  OUR SENSE, RATHER, IS THAT THE 
CONTINUING DETERIORATION IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IS FUELING A 
STEADY INCREASE IN THE RECRUITMENT OF DISAFFECTED YOUNG PEOPLE 
INTO RADICAL RELIGIOUS GROUPS LIKE THE SSP IN AREAS OF RURAL 
PUNJAB (PRIMARILY THE SOUTH) WHERE POVERTY BITES THE HARDEST.  IN 
RAISING A RED FLAG, TAMMAN IS PROBABLY REACTING MORE TO AN 
IMPROVEMENT IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITY OF A LOCAL MILITANT 
GROUP WITH PRO-TALIBAN SYMPATHIES THAN TO A LARGESCALE INCREASE 
IN NUMBERS.  FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THE DANGER IS NOT THAT RURAL 
PUNJAB IS TURNING FUNDAMENTALIST, BUT THAT RADICAL RELIGIOUS 
GROUPS ARE MAKING INROADS HERE JUST AS IN URBAN AREAS, FRAYING 
GRADUALLY BUT INEXORABLY AT THE STABILITY OF THE STATE. 
 
13.  COMMENT CONT.  AS FOR THE ALLEGED WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR 
OSAMA BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN AMONG ORDINARY PEOPLE, OUR 
INSTINCTS TELL US THIS MAY WELL BE CORRECT, BUT FOR THE REASONS 
CITED BY TARAR.  SUCH ATTITUDES DO NOT REFLECT RADICAL RELIGIOUS 
SENTIMENT OR EVEN ACTIVIST POLITICAL SUPPORT BUT OPERATE AT THE 
LEVEL OF POPULAR CULTURE, WITH BIN LADEN AND THE TALIBAN VIEWED 
AS A SUCCESSFUL ISLAMIC ROLE MODELS.  (PUNJABIS, AFTER ALL, ARE 
MUCH MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN KASHMIR THAN IN 
AFGHANISTAN.) 
 
14.  COMMENT CONT.  NONETHELESS, THE FACT THAT BIN LADEN AND THE 
TALIBAN CAN FUNCTION AS CULTURAL ICONS IS CLEARLY AN INDICTMENT 
OF THE PAKISTANI POLITICAL CLASS, WHICH HAS MISERABLY FAILED TO 
PROVIDE EITHER GOOD GOVERNMENT OR POSITIVE ROLE MODELS.  IT IS 
ALSO AN INDICATION OF THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF ORDINARY PAKISTANIS 
TO ANTI-WESTERN PROPAGANDA, ITSELF NOURISHED BY THE FAILURE OF 
SUCCESSIVE PAKISTANI GOVERNMENTS TO DELIVER THE GOODS, BUT 
REFLECTING ALSO THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF YEARS OF WHAT HAS BEEN 
PERCEIVED HERE AS ANTI-ISLAMIC BEHAVIOR BY THE UNITED STATES. 
END COMMENT.

REF: PESHAWAR 031 
 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY PUBLIC DIPLOMACY COUNSELOR 
RICHARD HOAGLAND FOR REASONS 1.5(D) 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY:  IT IS OUR IMPRESSION THAT 
THE USG IS NOT DOING AS WELL AS IT MIGHT 
PROJECTING PUBLIC DIPLOMACY ON USAMA BIN 
LADIN (UBL).  WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT 
WASHINGTON CONSIDER A REVIEW OF THIS PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY EFFORT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------- 
PUBLIC OPINION TRENDS 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  WE NOTE THE FOLLOWING PUBLIC OPINION 
TRENDS: 
 
--  THE PRO-TALIBAN AL-RASHID TRUST IN 
KARACHI CONTINUES TO CHURN OUT PRO-UBL -- AND 
CORRESPONDINGLY ANTI-U.S./ANTI-WESTERN -- 
BOOKS, NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND POSTERS IN 
URDU, ENGLISH, AND AFGHAN LANGUAGES AT 
NOMINAL COST OR FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION.  E.G., 
THE TRUST RECENTLY INTRODUCED A 3\' X 2\' FOUR- 
COLOR PRO-UBL POSTER WITH PHOTOS, MAPS, AND 
IDEOLOGICAL TEXTS AVAILABLE FOR 15 RUPEES, 
ABOUT 30 CENTS -- JUST A BIT MORE THAN THE 
COST OF A SIDEWALK HAIRCUT.  THIS POSTER BEAT 
THE USG\'S UBL \"WANTED\" POSTER TO THE STREET. 
 
--  WE FREQUENTLY HEAR REPORTS THAT SOME IN 
THE LOWER-MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES, BOTH 
URBAN AND RURAL, CONSIDER UBL AN ISLAMIC HERO 
BECAUSE THE U.S. HAS NAMED HIM \"PUBLIC ENEMY 
NUMBER ONE.\"  THAT SAID, IT\'S OUR IMPRESSION 
THAT THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS, AT LEAST IN 
PAKISTAN, DO NOT NECESSARILY SUPPORT THIS 
VIEW.  THE PENDING USG DISTRIBUTION OF UBL 
\"WANTED\" POSTERS AND MATCHBOOKS IN PAKISTAN 
MAY INCREASE UBL\'S STATURE AS A KIND OF FOLK 
HERO. 
 
--  U.S. AND BRITISH EFFORTS TO DISTINGUISH 
BETWEEN TERRORISTS, LIKE BIN LADIN, AND \"GOOD 
MUSLIMS\" ARE SOMETIMES PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA 
AND BY RELIGIOUS FIGURES IN THEIR WRITINGS 
AND SERMONS AS ATTEMPTS TO DIVIDE ALL MUSLIMS 
BY CO-OPTING WESTERNIZED -- MEANING (TO THEM) 
\"MORALLY CORRUPT\" -- MODERATES.  (NOTE:  THIS 
REPRESENTS THE PHILOSOPHICALLY ROMANTIC VIEW 
THAT ISLAM PER SE ERASES ALL DIVISIONS, THAT 
THE MUSLIM UMMAH IS \"ONE,\" AND THAT AN ATTACK 
ON ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.  END NOTE.) 
 
--    IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THEIR ORDINARY 
EXECRABLE PUBLIC RELATIONS PERFORMANCE ON THE 
BIN LADEN QUESTION, THE TALIBAN HAVE PRE- 
EMPTED US CONSISTENTLY SINCE AUGUST, FIRST BY 
ANNOUNCING THEIR WILLINGNESS TO HAVE 
AFGHANISTAN;S SUPREME COURT EXAMINE THE 
CHARGES AGAINST BIN LADIN AND THEN BY 
ANNOUNCING THAT NO \"EVIDENCE\" (BY WHICH THEY 
MEANT HARD FACTS IN PROOF OF THE CHARGES) HAD 
BEEN PRESENTED.  OUR RESPONSE IN EACH CASE 
WAS MUTED AND DELAYED.  CONTINUING THIS TREND 
ON THE TALIBAN\'S PART, EARLY IN JANUARY, THE 
TALIBAN SPONSORED A SEMINAR IN KABUL, 
REPORTED BY RADIO SHARIA, ON THE LIFE, TIMES, 
AND THOUGHTS OF UBL (REFTEL). 
 
 
--  ACCORDING TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, 
PAKISTANI TALIBS WHO HAVE SERVED IN 
AFGHANISTAN, ALONG WITH AFGHAN TALIBS, ARE 
BEGINNING TO ENFORCE THEIR DOGMAS AND SOCIAL 
CONTROLS IN PAKISTAN\'S TRIBAL TERRITORIES AND 
IN SOME PLACES IN BALOCHISTAN AND NWFP 
PROVINCES.  ALSO, LAST WEEK, THE GOP ENFORCED 
ISLAMIC LAW BY DECREE IN MALAKAND DIVISION 
AND IN A PART OF KOHISTAN.  ALTHOUGH THESE 
DEVELOPMENTS ARE RELATIVELY ISOLATED AS YET, 
THEY SUGGEST A DISTURBING TREND.  INDEED, THE 
FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE PAKISTANI 
CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHING SHARIA AS THE 
SUPREME LAW OF PAKISTAN -- AN AVOWEDLY HIGH 
PRIORITY OF THE NAWAZ SHARIF GOVERNMENT -- 
HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND 
IS PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE. 
 
-------------------- 
WHAT SHOULD BE DONE? 
-------------------- 
 
4.  (C) WE ARE UNLIKELY EVER TO MAKE MUCH 
INROAD WITH UBL\'S HARD-CORE SUPPORTERS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRUE-BELIEVER ABSOLUTISTS 
AND TEND TO THINK AND REACT LARGELY 
EMOTIONALLY:  FACTS ARE LESS IMPORTANT TO 
THEM THAN EMOTIONS.  THEY ARE NOT OPEN TO 
PERSUASION.  FURTHER, WE FACE A FORMIDABLE 
FOE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE CHURNING OUT AND 
WIDELY DISSEMINATING PRO-UBL PROPAGANDA AND 
TAKING OTHER ACTIVE MEASURES. 
 
5.  (C) HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A 
LARGE MIDDLE GROUND, IN PAKISTAN AND IN 
AFGHANISTAN, WHICH IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY ANTI- 
U.S./ANTI-WESTERN AND WHICH IS NOT 
IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED TO UBL AND HIS PAN- 
ISLAMIST REVOLUTION.  THIS MIDDLE GROUND, 
SOMEWHAT SUSCEPTIBLE TO REASON, OR AT LEAST 
TO OTHER INFORMATION, SHOULD BE OUR PRIMARY 
TARGET.  THE MESSAGE CRAFTED FOR THEM WOULD 
ALSO BE WELCOMED BY THE EDUCATED, WESTWARD- 
LOOKING ELITE OF BOTH PAKISTAN AND 
AFGHANISTAN WHO FEEL THREATENED BY UBL\'S 
ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE AND THEOLOGICAL 
OBSCURANTISM. 
 
6.  (C) THE FOCUS OF ANY ENHANCED USG PUBLIC 
DIPLOMACY EFFORT SHOULD BE TO PORTRAY UBL AND 
OTHERS AROUND HIM AS CRIMINALS, BOTH BY 
INTERNATIONAL AND BY ISLAMIC STANDARDS. 
WHERE POSSIBLE, RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 
MOVEMENT \"AL-QAIDA\" SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED, NOT 
JUST UBL AS AN INDIVIDUAL. 
 
--  WHEN WE FOCUS ON BIN LADIN, AND 
ESPECIALLY FOR AFGHAN CONSUMPTION, WE SHOULD 
MAKE THREE POINTS:  1) THE U.S. IS NOT 
AGAINST AFGHANISTAN AND THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, 2) 
THE U.S. IS NOT AGAINST ANY PARTICULAR AFGHAN 
POLITICAL FACTION, AND 3) THE U.S. WANTS UBL 
EXPELLED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO A PLACE WHERE HE 
CAN BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE. 
 
--  THE BROADER PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT COULD 
INCLUDE, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, A \"CHARGE 
SHEET\" OF THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY UBL, BY HIS 
CLOSEST ASSOCIATES, AND BY HIS FOLLOWERS, 
NOTING THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEIR VICTIMS 
HAVE BEEN MUSLIMS OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES. 
 
--  RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO PROTECT SOURCES 
AND METHODS AND NOT TO COMPROMISE ON-GOING 
INVESTIGATIONS AND JUDICIAL PROCESSES, WE 
SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT 
POSSIBLE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THE NAIROBI AND 
DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS, AS WELL AS ABOUT 
UBL\'S AND HIS MOVEMENT\'S OTHER CRIMES. 
 
--  THIS INTENSIFIED PUBLIC DIPLOMACY EFFORT 
SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE VALIDATION FROM ISLAMIC 
SOURCES THAT THESE CRIMES ARE INDEED 
RECOGNIZED AS CRIMES UNDER ISLAM.  RATHER 
THAN STATEMENTS BY U.S.- OR UK-BASED ISLAMIC 
SCHOLARS, IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE TO USE 
THE TEACHINGS AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF MAJOR 
ISLAMIC SCHOLARS AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS FROM 
SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, AND ELSEWHERE.  IN 
SELECTING/ELICITING SUCH CITATIONS, IT SHOULD 
BE KEPT IN MIND THAT UBL AND THE PAN- 
ISLAMISTS DISMISS SAUDI ARABIA AND EGYPT AS 
ONLY NOMINALLY ISLAMIC STATES CAPTIVE TO 
U.S.-TOADYING, DESPOTIC, AND APOSTATE LEADERS. 
 
--  KEEPING IN MIND THAT IN HIS DECEMBER 23 
INTERVIEW UBL JUSTIFIED KILLING MUSLIMS IN 
HIS JIHAD AGAINST \"CRUSADERS AND JEWS,\" AND 
RECOGNIZING THE EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF OUR 
TARGET AUDIENCE, WE SHOULD PREPARE FOR 
DISSEMINATION MORE HUMAN INTEREST STORIES OF 
UBL\'S VICTIMS, ESPECIALLY HIS MUSLIM VICTIMS 
OF VARIOUS NATIONALITIES.  U.S. MEDIA REPORTS 
OF BLINDED KENYANS, FOR EXAMPLE, RECEIVED

OF MISSION, FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  ALL FIVE PAN AM 73 HIJACKERS 
REMAIN INCARCERATED AT ADIALA PRISON, RAWALPINDI. 
A JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) 
DEPORTATION HEARING CONSIDERED THE CASE OF 
HIJACKER SULIEMAN AL-TURKI ONLY.  ACTION ON AL- 
TURKI\'S DEPORTATION REMAINS PENDING AS THE LIBYAN 
EMBASSY HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT AL-TURKI IS A 
LIBYAN CITIZEN.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THERE WILL 
BE FURTHER MOVEMENT ON THIS CASE UNTIL AL-TURKI\'S 
ATTORNEY FILES ANOTHER PETITION WITH THE COURT. 
THE DEPORTATIONS IN QUESTION WOULD BE BACK TO THE 
DEFENDANTS\' CLAIMED COUNTRY OF ORIGIN -- NOT, AT 
THIS POINT, TO THE UNITED STATES TO STAND TRIAL. 
 
2.  (C)  (SUMMARY, CONTINUED)  MEANWHILE, AN 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM FROM FBI\'S WASHINGTON FIELD 
OFFICE ARRIVED ON JANUARY 30 TO CONTINUING THE 
INTERVIEWING OF WITNESSES AND FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY PERSONNEL WHO PARTICIPATED 
IN THE ORIGINAL PAN AM 73 INVESTIGATION.  THE 
TEAM WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP ON PREVIOUS FBI REQUESTS 
FOR ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. 
 
3.   (C)  ON SEPTEMBER 5, 1986, SIX ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) TERRORISTS HIJACKED PAN AM 73 
IN KARACHI.  TWENTY-TWO PASSENGERS WERE KILLED 
AND 125 WOUNDED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE HIJACKERS 
RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY, WHICH WAS THEN 
REDUCED TO LIFE, AND THEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS (NOW 
COMPLETED).  ONE OF THE HIJACKERS DIED WHILE IN 
CUSTODY; THE OTHER FIVE -- SOULIEMAN AL TURKI, 
MUSTAFA HASSAN SAEED BOMER, MANSOOR AL-RASHID, 
MUHAMMAD ABDUL KHALIL HUSAIN AL-RAHAYAL AND JAMAL 
SAEED ABDUL RAHIM AL-FAHID -- REMAIN INCARCERATED 
IN ADIALA PRISON IN RAWALPINDI. 
 
4.  (C)  THE NATIONALITY OF SEVERAL OF THE 
HIJACKERS REMAINS IN QUESTION.  BOMER HAS BEEN 
IDENTIFIED AS A JORDANIAN NATIONAL, AND WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT DEPORTATION DISCUSSIONS ARE 
UNDERWAY WITH THE GOJ.  THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA 
HAS NOT YET ACCEPTED AL TURKI\'S CLAIM THAT HE IS 
A LIBYAN.  AL TURKI\'S JANUARY 31 LAHORE HIGH 
COURT (RAWALPINDI BENCH) DEPORTATION HEARING WAS 
THUS STYMIED; WE EXPECT AL TURKI\'S LAWYER TO FILE 
ANOTHER PETITION FOR RELEASE/DEPORTATION (TIMING 
UNKNOWN).  THE REMAINING THREE HIJACKERS CLAIM TO 
BE PALESTINIAN, A CLAIM THAT THE PALESTINIAN 
EMBASSY HAS THUS FAR REPORTEDLY REJECTED. 
 
5.  (C)  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN IS AWARE OF 
THE USG\'S INTEREST IN THE FUTURE PROSECUTION OF 
THE FIVE HIJACKERS.  WE HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE 
WITH INTERIOR MINISTER HAIDER A NUMBER OF TIMES, 
AND HE HAS DIRECTED HIS MINISTRY TO ASSIST US 
WITH OUR REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE AND 
WITNESS ACCESS RELATED TO DEVELOPING THE CASE. IN 
ADDITION, AT THE EMBASSY\'S REQUEST, INTERIOR 
MINISTRY DEPUTY SECRETARY (POLITICAL) HUSSAIN 
CHAUDRY BRIEFED US ON FEBRUARY 1 ON THE AL-TURKI 
DEPORTATION HEARING (ONE OF CHAUDRY\'S OFFICER HAD 
BEEN ASSIGNED TO ATTEND THE HEARING). 
 
6.  (C)  THE JANUARY 31 HEARING HAD BEEN SPURRED 
BY A PETITION FILED BY AL TURKI\'S ATTORNEY 
SEEKING IMMEDIATE RELEASE FROM CUSTODY (THE 
DEFENDANT HAS NOW SERVED TIME IN EXCESS OF 14 
YEARS).  THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN\'S 
REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED THE COURT THAT THE 
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS WAS WORKING WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA TO ARRANGE FOR SOULIEMAN\'S 
DEPORTATION.  THE GOP REPRESENTATIVE ALSO 
INFORMED THE JUDGE THAT CONSULAR ACCESS HAD BEEN 
GRANTED TO THE LIBYAN EMBASSY TO MEET WITH THE 
DEFENDANT, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA HAD 
NOT YET CONFIRMED AL TURKI\'S CITIZENSHIP. 
ACCORDING TO MINISTRY OF INTERIOR OFFICIALS, THE 
JUDGE APPARENTLY DID NOT SPECIFY A TIMEFRAME IN 
HIS RULING, BUT INSTRUCTED THE GOVERNMENT OF 
PAKISTAN REPRESENTATIVE TO WORK TO EXPEDITE AL 
TURKI\'S DEPORTATION. 
 
7. (C) THE FBI HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO PROCESS THE 
HIJACKERS FOR PHOTOGRAPHS AND FINGERPRINTS.  THE 
GOP HAS COOPERATED IN LOCATING AND ARRANGING 
INTERVIEWS OF A NUMBER OF THE GOP WITNESSES.  THE 
GOP HAS PROVIDED THE FBI WITH A CERTIFIED COPY OF 
THE CASE PROPERTY, THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT 
(FIR) PREPARED ON THE CASE, AND AN UNSIGNED COPY 
OF A JOINT STATEMENT BY THE HIJACKERS. 
 
8. (C)  THE VISITING FBI WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE 
TEAM CONTINUES IN ITS EFFORTS TO SECURE (A) 
COMPLETE COPIES OF INTERROGATION REPORTS PREPARED 
BY THE PAKISTANI INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE

S/CT FOR REAP 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PK 
SUBJECT: 2003 TERRORISM REPORT FOR PAKISTAN 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
A)  Pakistan continues to be one of the United States\' most 
important partners in the Global Coalition against terrorism. 
Pakistan\'s military, intelligence and law enforcement 
agencies are cooperating closely with the U.S. and other 
nations to identify, interdict and eliminate terrorism at 
home in Pakistan and abroad.  This includes ongoing efforts 
to capture and destroy the remnants of al-Qaida and the 
Taliban that remain in the region.  To date, over 500 
suspected operatives of these groups have been successfully 
apprehended with the cooperation of Pakistani authorities. 
Among those captured in 2003 were Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a 
key figure in the events of September 11, and Waleed bin 
Attash, a prime suspect in the October 2000 attack on the 
U.S.S. Cole. The GOP has also demonstrated its resolve by 
cracking down on previously banned militant organizations 
that had regrouped under new names, freezing their assets and 
detaining their leaders.  Along its historically porous 
border with Afghanistan, Pakistan\'s military is undertaking 
operations to capture or kill trans-border terrorists.  In 
October 2003, security forces achieved notable success in an 
operation that killed 8 and captured 18 al-Qaida and Taliban 
in the remote tribal area of South Waziristan Agency. 
 
Pursuant to its obligations under U.N. resolutions 1267, 1390 
and 1455 Pakistan continues to work with the U.N. Sanctions 
Committee to freeze the assets of individuals and groups 
identified as terrorist entities. 
 
At the same time, Pakistan faces difficult challenges as it 
does its part in prosecuting the war on terrorism.  The GOP 
has drafted but has yet to submit to Parliament for approval 
anti-money laundering legislation, a critical weapon in the 
terror-fighting arsenal.  Pakistan\'s beleaguered public 
education system is a source of concern both from a security 
standpoint and in terms of the country\'s future.  Religious 
schools, offering a limited curriculum and sometimes 
promoting violent ideologies have stepped in to fill the 
vacuum.  Reform and investment are urgently needed to broaden 
curriculum content and revitalize the public education system. 
 
B)  Pakistan\'s judicial system continues to respond to both 
international and domestic cases of terrorism.  In 2003, 
Pakistan continued to use its Anti-Terrorism Courts (created 
in 1997 to expedite the handling of terrorist cases). 
Following in the wake of the Daniel Pearl kidnap/murder 
convictions in 2002, government prosecutors in April 2003 
obtained convictions for defendants charged with organizing 
the bombing of the US Consulate in Karachi the previous year. 
 Mohammad Imran and Mohammad Hanif both received the death 
penalty while two accomplices were given life sentences for 
their roles in the vehicle bomb attack on the Consulate which 
killed 12 Pakistanis.  In November 2003, the same court 
handed death sentences to three members of the banned 
extremist group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, for planning and 
committing sectarian murders.  Pakistani investigators, as 
demonstrated in the aftermath of the 2002 church attack in 
Islamabad that killed two Embassy family members, have shown 
greater willingness to grant their U.S. counterparts access 
to evidence. 
 
C)  No Pakistani nationals were formally extradited to the 
U.S. under the 1931 Extradition Treaty in 2003.  However, the 
GOP continues to facilitate and has stepped-up the transfer 
of captured terrorists to U.S. custody. 
 
D)  Impediments to the investigation and prosecution of 
suspected terrorists include the lack of centralized 
databases to collect, process and disseminate timely 
information leading to criminal convictions.  Pakistan lacks 
a National Crime Information Center, Department of Motor 
Vehicles, Social Security System or other database systems 
commonly used in developed countries.  Sophisticated law 
enforcement and investigative techniques need greater 
development as well. 
 
Pakistan\'s efforts to combat terrorism have also been 
hampered by its delay in passing key anti-money laundering 
legislation.  In 2002, key anti-money laundering legislation 
- drafted with U.S. assistance - failed to be enacted.  A 
revised version has, however, been approved by the Cabinet 
and is expected to be sent to Parliament.  This legislation 
is an essential tool in broadening the capacity of Pakistani 
authorities to monitor suspicious financial transactions. 
Such legislation will enable law enforcement and financial 
regulatory agencies to develop the necessary resources and 
technical infrastructure to pursue sources of terrorist 
financing. 
 
Despite these hindrances, Pakistan has made a significant 
step forward with the recent implementation of a central 
fingerprint repository system which now includes some 70,000 
10-print cards. Pakistan\'s progress with respect to 
developing the legal and technical infrastructure required to 
track terrorist financing has been incremental and the USG is 
encouraging it to do more in this area. 
 
The GOP has taken many important steps to bolster its 
terror-fighting capabilities.  However, many of its resources 
are new, untested and will require time to prove their 
effectiveness. 
 
E)  President Musharraf, Prime Minister Jamali and other 
senior Pakistani officials have repeatedly condemned 
terrorism and reaffirmed the government\'s commitment to 
putting a stop to it both inside Pakistan and abroad.  There 
is an understanding at all levels of the government that it 
is in Pakistan\'s interest to be a proactive member of the 
global fight against terrorism.  This commitment has been 
manifested in the high-level of cooperation the U.S. has 
received from the GOP in ongoing terrorist investigations in 
the United States and abroad.  With regard to threats on U.S. 
soil, such efforts include providing timely intelligence and 
support to U.S. agencies in identifying and neutralizing 
terrorist cells.  These efforts play an important role in 
helping prevent attacks on American citizens, installations 
and interests.  Pakistan also provides significant assistance 
in the investigation of international terrorism, acting on 
leads provided to its counterterrorism and law enforcement 
agencies by the U.S. and other nations.  In September 2003, 
Pakistani intelligence and law enforcement agents raided two 
religious seminaries in Karachi, uncovering a major student 
terrorist cell.  Those arrested included foreign nationals 
from Malaysia, Indonesia and Burma. 
 
Following the November 2003 bombing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 
in which 21 people died, Pakistan\'s National Assembly 
unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attack and 
praising President Musharraf\'s \"courageous and consistent 
support to the war on terrorism.\" 
 
After the September 11 attacks, Pakistani authorities 
arrested hundreds of suspected extremists and banned five 
militant groups.  However, many of the detainees were later 
quietly released and a number of the organizations resurfaced 
under new names and became active in 2003. 
Jaish-e-Muhammmad, for example, reemerged under the name 
Jamat-ul-Furqan while Lashkar-e-Taiba was reconstituted as 
Jamaat-ul-Dawa.  Both jihadi groups have been associated with 
terrorist activity in Kashmir while others are known to 
promote sectarian violence.  In November 2003, responding to 
increasing alarm over the active reemergence of these and 
other extremist groups, the Musharraf government ordered a 
major crackdown, banning 5 groups: 
 
Jamat-ul-Ansar (formerly Harakat ul-Mujahedin) 
Jamat-ul-Furqan (formerly Jaish-e-Muhammad) 
Hizbu-ul-Tahreer (UK-based) 
Millat-e-Islamia (formerly Sippah-e-Sihaba) 
Tahreek-e-Pakistan (formerly Tehnik-e-Jafria Pakistan) 
 
A sixth group, Jamaat-ul-Dawa was placed on a \"watch list.\" 
As part of its actions, the government closed offices, froze 
assets and detained over 60 individuals.  Although it is too 
early to determine the duration or effectiveness of these 
actions, the USG is encouraged by the GOP\'s willingness to 
forcefully address the problem. 
 
(F)  In 2003, there has been significant progress in several 
areas of Pakistan\'s ongoing efforts to enhance its 
terrorist-fighting capabilities both within and beyond its 
borders.  Perhaps the most important development is the 
implementation of the first federal civilian counterterrorism 
force, established within the Federal Investigation Agency 
(FIA). 
 
Special Investigation Group (SIG) 
--------------------------------- 
Established in late 2002 with U.S. financial and technical 
assistance, the Special Investigation Group (SIG) is tasked 
with facilitating a unified investigative response at both 
the national and provincial levels.  The SIG is comprised of 
4 components: intelligence collection, investigations, agency 
liaison and cyber-terrorism.  On October 7, the SIG graduated 
50 officers trained in special counterterrorism techniques. 
Provincial Criminal Investigation Divisions (PCIDs) in all 4 
provinces will create sections to mirror the SIG structure 
and expand its reach to the regional level.  The SIG and its 
constituent parts are expected to be fully operational by 
mid-2004.  The USG and other governments are working closely 
with the GOP to explore more ways to augment Pakistan\'s 
terror-fighting capabilities, particularly in the areas of 
DNA collection/analysis, post-blast forensics and 
cyber-terrorism. 
 
Crisis Response Team 
-------------------- 
To provide a tactical dimension to Pakistan\'s 
counterterrorism program, the USG is now training and 
equipping Crisis Response Teams (CRT).  Modeled after SWAT 
teams in the United States, the CRTs are being trained to 
deal with \"high risk\" encounters with violent criminals and 
terrorists. 
 
Central Fingerprint Repository 
------------------------------- 
Pakistan\'s first central fingerprint repository is being 
established following Pakistan\'s conversion to the 
international standard 10-print card.  A key step forward in 
aiding authorities to identify terrorists and other 
criminals, the 10-print card file now holds 70,000 cards. 
Another 10,000 cards will be added by the end of 2003.  The 
next step now underway is to procure and install an Automated 
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), a highly 
sophisticated data management system that will assist law 
enforcement agencies to rapidly identify suspects.  Funded by 
the USG, the system should be operational in 2004. 
 
PISCES 
------ 
The Personal Identification Secure Comparison and Evaluation 
System (PISCES) is now operating at all major international 
airports in Pakistan and an expansion program is underway to 
install the system at all official sea and land entry points 
by the end of 2004.  PISCES technology is helping Pakistan 
identify wanted criminals and terrorists attempting to 
transit its borders at official crossing points.  Pakistani 
authorities report that the system is already yielding 
results. 
 
Border Security Assistance Program 
---------------------------------- 
The USG remains committed to assisting Pakistan in securing 
its borders against trafficking in weapons, drugs, and 
infiltration by terrorists.  Created in 2002, the $73 million 
dollar Border Security Assistance Program provides aircraft, 
surveillance technology, communications equipment, transport 
and training to assist Pakistan in securing its western 
borders with Afghanistan and Iran.  Related assistance 
efforts also provide funding for outpost construction and 
upgrade, training and other commodities.  To date, 183 border 
personnel have been trained in port-of-entry operations and 
small unit tactics.  In the previously inaccessible Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), $24 million is being 
invested in the construction of 400k of roads.  These roads 
provide critical access to security forces and have the added 
benefit of assisting in the economic advancement of 
historically underdeveloped areas. 
 
G)  While the GOP does not overtly support any international 
terrorist groups, it does provide diplomatic and moral 
support for Kashmiri militant groups, some of whom are linked 
to terrorist acts.  There are indications that infiltration 
across the Line of Control between Pakistani and Indian-held 
Kashmir continue. 
 
H)  Host government\'s public statements have been uniformly 
supportive of our joint efforts in the war against terror. 
 
I)  President Musharraf said recently that Pakistan is at a 
\"critical crossroads,\" faced with both immense opportunities 
in the world economy yet burdened by continuing threats from 
terrorism, religious extremism and sectarianism.  Measured in 
terms of its public pronouncements and deployment of 
resources to counter these threats, Pakistan\'s 
commitment-level to the war on the terrorism can best be 
described as steadfast in 2003
