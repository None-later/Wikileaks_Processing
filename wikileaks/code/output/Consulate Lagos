1.  ALMOST AS LOCAL EVIDENCE OF LIBYAN LEADER COLONEL 
QADHAFI\'S CURRENT DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE SOUTH OF THE 
SAHARA, THE INDEPENDENT LAGOS DAILY, THE GUARDIAN, 
PUBLISHED ON APRIL 15, 1985, THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIVE 
INTERVIEW WITH HIM, BYLINED BY YEMI OGUNBIYI.  IT CLAIMED 
THAT THE INTERVIEW WAS QADHAFI\'S \"FIRST WITH AN AFRICAN 
NEWSPAPER HOUSE OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD AND, INDEED, HIS 
FIRST WITH ANY NEWSPAPER IN SEVERAL YEARS.\"  IT INCLUDED 
A PICTURE OF QADHAFI TALKING WITH THE ARTICLE\'S AUTHOR 
AND GUARDIAN PUBLISHER MR. ALEX IBRU, REPORTEDLY AT 
SALAHADDIN MILITARY BARRACKS IN BENGHAZI.  QADHAFI SPOKE 
IN ARABIC AND USED AN INTERPRETER.  THE INTERVIEW TOOK 
PLACE \"BARELY TEN DAYS BEFORE OUSTED PRESIDENT JAAFAR 
JIMEIRY LEFT FOR A VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES IN SEARCH 
OF AID.\"  QADHAFI WAS CHARACTERIZED AS LUKEWARM TOWARD 
NIGERIA.

-      GADDAFI DEFENDS LIBYA\'S DYNAMIC FOREIGN POLICY 
- 
-  IN A RARE NEWSPAPER INTERVIEW, THE LEADER OF THE 
SOCIALIST PEOPLE\'S LIBYAN ARAB JAMAHIRIYA, COLONEL 
MUAMMAR AL GADDAFI, HAS DENIED THAT HIS SEEMINGLY MILI- 
TANT AND AGGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY IN AFRICA IS A 
CAMOUFLAGE FOR ANY EXPANSIONIST AMBITION. 
 
-  SPEAKING IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE GUARDIAN 
AT THE SALAHADDIN MILITARY BARRACKS IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, 
COL. GADDAFI ANSWERED A WIDE RANGE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS 
FORCEFUL STYLE OF POLITICS AND DIPLOMACY. 
- 
-  IN THE PROCESS, HE STOUTLY DEFENDED HIS DIPLOMATIC 
ROLE AS A LIBERATING ONE FOR THE CAUSE OF ARAB AND AFRICAN 
UNITY AND WAS VERY CRITICAL OF THOSE WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS 
\"FOREIGN ENEMIES\" WHO WERE DETERMINED TO PORTRAY HIS IMAGE 
IN VERY BAD LIGHT. 
- 
-   \"LET ME STATE FROM THE OUTSET THAT THE ROLE WE SEE 
OURSELVES AS PLAYING, NOT ONLY IN AFRICA BUT ALSO IN THE 
THIRD WORLD, IS A LIBERATING ONE.  BUT OUR ENEMIES DO NOT 
SEE THIS ROLE AS A LIBERATING ONE.  THEY HAVE THEIR OWN 
DELIBERATE MISINTERPRETATION WHICH IS QUITE MISLEADING.\" 
 
-  THE SON OF A BEDUIN ARAB, COL. GADDAFI, 43, CAME TO 
POWER ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1969, WHEN HE AND A GROUP OF FREE 
OFFICERS OVERTHREW KING IDRIS IN A BLOODLESS COUP.  THERE- 
AFTER, THEY DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO TRANSFORMING THIS 
LARGE COUNTRY OF A THREE MILLION PEOPLE \"FROM A BACKWARD 
STATE INTO A MODERN NATION.\" 
 
-  EASILY ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL LEADERS IN THE 
WORLD TODAY, GADDAFI HAS EARNED FOR HIMSELF THE EMINENT, 
IF SOMETIMES PROBLEMATIC REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE 
MOST ACKNOWLEDGED LEADERS IN THE ARAB WORLD. 
 
- THE GUARDIAN INTERVIEW WAS HIS FIRST WITH AN AFRICAN 
NEWSPAPER HOUSE OUTSIDE THE ARAB WORLD AND, INDEED, HIS 
FIRST WITH ANY NEWSPAPER IN SEVERAL YEARS. 
 
-  OF THE GUARDIAN, HE HAD THIS TO SAY:  \"I HAVE A GREAT 
OPINION OF YOUR PAPER AND IT DESERVES ALL THE SUPPORT AND 
PRAISE THAT IT IS RECEIVING.  FOR, INDEED, WE NEED REAL 
AFRICAN NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES WHICH CAN SPEAK UP FOR 
AFRICA.  IT IS SAD ENOUGH THAT AFRICANS GET TO READ ABOUT 
THEMSELVES ONLY FROM EUROPEAN OR THE AMERICAN MEDIA.  I 
AM PLEASED THAT I CAN MEET WITH YOU AND THAT WE CAN 
EXCHANGE VIEWS.\" 
 
-  SPEAKING VERY QUIETLY IN ARABIC THROUGH AN INTERPRETER, 
HIS PLACID FACE BETRAYING AN OUTWARD CALM WHICH JARS 
SHARPLY WITH HIS CONTROVERSIAL REPUTATION, COL. GADDAFI 
SPOKE AT SOME LENGTH ON THE PROBLEMS OF ARAB UNITY AND 
ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR A LARGER AFRICAN UNDERSTANDING 
AND ACCORD. 
 
-  REPORTEDLY, HE DEFENDED HIS SUPPORT FOR MANY REGIMES 
IN AFRICA AND SAW SUCH SUPPORT AS VALID WITHIN THE TOTAL 
FRAMEWORK OF AN AFRICAN SOLIDARITY AND UNITY. 
- 
-   \"ALL THE EFFORTS TO UNITE WITH EGYPT, SUDAN, SYRIA, 
ETHIOPIA AND CHAD WHICH YOU REFERRED TO, WERE ATTEMPTS 
TO UNITE THE ARAB WORLD AS ONE NATION.  THE ARABS AS A 
WHOLE ARE LIKE ONE NATION.  THEY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE, 
HAVE THE SAME ORIGINS AND ABOUT 98 PER CENT HAVE AND 
PRACTISE ONE FAITH.  AND FOR US, THE UNITY OF THE ARAB 
WORLD IS ONE STEP TOWARDS THE TOTAL UNITY OF THE AFRICAN 
CONTINENT.\" 
 
-  COL. GADDAFI WAS VERY CRITICAL OF MOST ARAB COUNTRIES 
WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS REACTIONARY, ESPECIALLY FOR BEING 
LY DEPENDENT ON WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR THEIR 
SURVIVAL. 
 
-   \"UNFORTUNATELY, TOO, THERE ARE QUITE A NUMBER OF NON- 
ARAB COUNTRIES IN AFRICA WHO ASLO BEHAVE IN SIMILAR MANNER, 
WHO ARE FOREVER HOPING AND BELIEVING THAT THE WEST WILL 
BAIL THEM OUT OF THEIR OWN BANKRUPT AND CORRUPT POLICIES. 
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THEIR VERY DEPENDENCE ON THE 
WEST SHORTENS THEIR LIVES (EXCLAMATION POINT)\" 
 
-    THE INTERVIEW WAS HELD BARELY 10 DAYS BEFORE OUSTED 
PRESIDENT JAAFAR NIMEIRY OF SUDAN LEFT FOR A VISIT TO THE 
UNITED STATES IN SEARCH OF AID BEFORE HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY 
OVERTHROWN. 
 
-  BUT COL. GADDAFI SAVED HIS SEVEREST ATTACKS FOR THOSE 
WHOM HE DESCRIBED AS ZIONISTS AND IMPERIALIST AGGRESSORS 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
-  INSISTING THAT ARABS MUST NOT BE MADE TO BEAR THE 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF HITLER\'S CRIMES,  HE REITERATED HIS 
NOW FAMILIAR CALL, PRESUMABLY ON THE STATE OF ISRAEL, TO 
RETURN ALL ARAB LANDS. 
 
-  ON HIS RELATIONS WITH NIGERIA, HE WAS FAR MORE 
LUKEWARM AND GUARDED IN HIS REACTIONS. 
 
-  \"OUR RELATIONS CAN BE BETTER THAN THEY ARE NOW,\" HE 
SAID. 
 
-  HIS TEPID RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF RELATIONS WITH 
NIGERIA MAY NOT BE UNCONNECTED, POLITICAL OBSERVERS BE- 
LIEVE, WITH LIBYA\'S ROLE IN CHAD, NIGERIA\'S NORTH-EASTERN 
NEIGHBOUR. 
- 
-  BUT HE DEFENDED THE INTERVENTION OF LIBYA IN CHAD ALL 
THE SAME, ARGUING THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF 
LIBYA TO HAVE AN UNSTABLE CHAD, SINCE IT ALSO SHARES 
BORDERS WITH LIBYA. 
 
-  PRESSED WHETHER HE KEPT TO THE AGREEMENT ON THE MUTUAL 
WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM CHAD REACHED WITH FRANCE, HE 
RETORTED:  \"OF COURSE, WE HONOURED THE AGREEMENT.  WE 
WITHDREW OUR TROOPS.  THERE WERE RUMOURS, POSSIBLY BEING 
PUT OUT BY AMERICANS, TO THE EFFECT THAT WE HAD NOT WITH- 
DRAWN OUR TROOPS.  OBVIOUSLY, FRANCE IS LOOKING FOR AN 
EXCUSE TO COME BACK TO CHAD.\"

E.O. 12356: DECL: OADR 
TAGS: PGOV, KISL, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: REACTION TO CESSATION OF SHARIA DEBATE 
 
REF:  LAGOS 17683 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY:  INITIAL PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE 
FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT\'S (FMG) DECISION TO HALT 
DEBATE ON SHARIA LAW IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY HAS 
BEEN MUTED.  CRITICISM HAS PREDICTABLY COME FROM 
PARTISANS ON THE ISSUE AND THOSE OPPOSED TO MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT.  ATTEMPTS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO CONTEST THE 
GOVERNMENT ACTION WERE QUICKLY OVERRULED AND ORDINARY 
BUSINESS RESUMED.  THE REACTIONS MAY PORTEND INCREASING 
SKEPTICISM TOWARDS THE ASSEMBLY\'S ROLE IN THE 
TRANSITION; SEE COMMENT, PARA. 6.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U)  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO END DEBATE 
IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY ON THE INCLUSION OF SHARIA 
LAW IN THE NEW CONSTITUTION HAS SO FAR PROVOKED LITTLE 
OUTCRY FROM THE ASSEMBLYMEN OR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. 
ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, MOST DELEGATES ISSUED MILD 
STATEMENTS--MANY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
ACTION--OR REFUSED COMMENT.  TYPICAL WAS THE REACTION OF 
REPRESENTATIVE LAM ADESINA OF THE IBADAN SOUTH AREA OF 
OYO STATE, WHO WAS QUOTED IN THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION OF 
THE INFLUENTIAL LAGOS DAILY, \"GUARDIAN,\" AS SAYING THAT 
THE GOVERNMENT\'S INTERVENTION WAS \"IN ORDER.\"  HE ADDED 
THAT \"ANY GOOD GOVERNMENT WOULD DO EXACTLY WHAT THE 
BABANGIDA ADMINISTRATION DID\" TO BREAK THE SEVEN-WEEK 
DEADLOCK OVER THE ISSUE.  THE SAME PAPER QUOTED EMBASSY 
CONTACT OLABIYI DURAJAIYE (REFTEL) FROM IDEJU SOUTH, 
OGUN STATE, AS SAYING THAT THE ASSEMBLY \"GOT WHAT WE 
DESERVE\" FOR NOT MOVING FASTER TOWARD A COMPROMISE. 
 
3.  MUCH OF THE CRITICISM FROM THE LAWMAKERS WAS COUCHED 
IN MODERATE TERMS.  ACCORDING TO THE NOVEMBER 29 EDITION 
OF THE \"PUNCH\" NEWSPAPER, MALLAM ABBA DABO, A STRONG 
ADVOCATE OF SHARIA FROM KANO, CALLED THE GOVERNMENT 
ACTION \"SAD AND UNFORTUNATE.\"  HE ASSERTED THAT, 
CONTRARY TO GOVERNMENT ALLEGATIONS, THE POLITICAL ELITE 
IS CAPABLE OF REACHING CONSENSUS ON CONTROVERSIAL 
SUBJECTS, BUT CONCEDED THAT THE ASSEMBLY WAS CULPABLE TO 
THE EXTENT OF CREATING AN \"IMPRESSION OF DISHARMONY\" 
THROUGH THE INORDINATE LENGTH OF THE DEBATE.  OTHER 
MEMBERS, HOWEVER, WERE MORE FORTHRIGHT.  THE \"GUARDIAN\" 
QUOTED SAMUEL FAGOYINBO (MUSHIN CENTRAL, LAGOS) AS 
DECLARING THE MOVE A \"CLEAR RAPE OF DEMOCRACY\" AND 
CHARGING THAT \"THE FACT THAT THE RIGHT TO FASHION A 
DEMOCRATIC DOCUMENT HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE 
ASSEMBLY DOES NOT AUGUR WELL FOR THE COUNTRY.\" 
 
4.  (U)  OTHER SIGNIFICANT VOICES OF DISSENT CAME FROM 
PARTISANS IN THE SHARIA LAW DEBATE OUTSIDE THE 
ASSEMBLY.  NOTABLE AMONG THEM WAS A STATEMENT IN THE 
NOVEMBER 29 \"GUARDIAN\" BY ANTHONY O. OKOGIE, ARCHBISHOP 
OF LAGOS AND PRESIDENT OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION OF 
NIGERIA (CAN), WHICH QUOTED HIM AS SAYING THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD \"STAY CLEAR\" OF ANY DISCUSSION OF 
RELIGIOUS ISSUES.  \"PUNCH\" ALSO QUOTED NOTED 
CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER--AND OPPONENT OF MILITARY 
RULE--OLU ONAGORUWA AS STATING SARCASTICALLY THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD DISSOLVE THE ASSEMBLY ENTIRELY AND 
PUBLISH ITS OWN \"PRE-CONCEIVED CONSTITUTION.\" 
 
5.  (U)  ACCORDING TO THE PRESS ACCOUNTS, THE ASSEMBLY 
PROCEEDINGS ON THE DAY AFTER THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT 
WERE ORDERLY.  THERE WERE SOME TENTATIVE EFFORTS TO 
RAISE THE GOVERNMENT ORDER FOR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR, 
INCLUDING ONE ON THE PART OF EMBASSY CONTACT GAIUS YARO 
OF BAUCHI STATE (REFTEL) TO THE EFFECT THAT THE MOVE 
CONTRADICTED THE GOVERNMENT\'S OWN DECREE IN ESTABLISHING 
THE ASSEMBLY.  ANOTHER MEMBER ALSO CHALLENGED THE 
AUTHORITY OF AIKHOMU\'S SPEECH TO ALTER THAT DECREE SINCE 
THE SPEECH IS NOT A LEGAL DOCUMENT AND CARRIES NO 
OFFICIAL WEIGHT.  CHAIRMAN ANIAGOLU RULED, HOWEVER, THAT 
THE SPEECH WAS IN ORDER AND SUFFICED TO REMOVE SHARIA 
FROM THE ASSEMBLY\'S AREA OF DELIBERATION.  ACCORDING TO 
THE REPORTS, THE ASSEMBLY THEN PROCEEDED WITH ITS 
METHODICAL CLAUSE-BY-CAUSE CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTION. 
 
- 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  SHARIA\'S SUDDEN REMOVAL FROM THE 
ASSEMBLY\'S PURVIEW APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GREETED WITH 
RESIGNATION IN SOME QUARTERS, AND DISCRETION AND 
CYNICISM IN OTHERS.   THERE IS LITTLE IN THE PUBLIC 
RESPONSE TO DATE TO SUGGEST THAT THE ISSUE WILL BE 
REKINDLED IN THE ASSEMBLY OR IN ANY OTHER INFLUENTIAL 
FORUM.  THE QUESTION REMAINS, HOWEVER, WHETHER SUCH 
RESIGNATION IS SPECIFIC TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTION IN 
THIS ONE INSTANCE OR, AS WE SUSPECT, WILL CARRY OVER TO 
OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ASSEMBLY\'S DELIBERATIONS AS WELL. 
WHILE SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY RALLY TO THE 
ASSEMBLY IN OPPOSITION TO MILITARY INTRUSION INTO THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS 
PROBABLY LOST STATURE THROUGH NOT FULFILLING THE POPULAR 
HOPE THAT A CIVILIAN INSTITUTION, ALBEIT FUNCTIONING 
UNDER STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES, CAN DEMONSTRATE A 
CAPACITY FOR COOPERATIVE AND RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP ON 
ISSUES OF CRITICAL IMPORT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE DEBATE OVER INCLUSION OF SHARIA LAW 
PROVISIONS IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION REMAINS THE MOST 
DIVISIVE ISSUE IN THE RUN-UP TOWARD LIFTING THE BAN ON 
POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  THE ARMED FORCES RULING COUNCIL 
(AFRC) ANNOUNCED ON MARCH 29 THAT PROVISIONS ON SHARIA 
LAW MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE CONSTITUTION BEFORE THE AFRC 
WOULD ACCEPT IT FOR REVIEW (REF B).  THE SURPRISE 
ANNOUNCEMENT REOPENED THE DEBATE IN THE CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY AFTER THE AFRC HAD PUT A STOP TO THE POLITICAL 
WRANGLING OVER THE ISSUE IN NOVEMBER 1988 (REF A). 
HOWEVER, THE AFRC ANNOUNCED THAT THE CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY MUST STILL SUBMIT THE COMPLETED DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION ON TIME--TODAY, APRIL 5--BUT THE PRESS IS 
CONSPICUOUSLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT LANGUAGE ON SHARIA LAW MUST BE 
INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION HAS CAUSED WIDESPREAD 
CONFUSION IN THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.  ACCORDING TO 
PRESS REPORTS, CHAIRMAN OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY 
JUSTICE ANTHONY ANIAGOLU HAD UPHELD THE ASSEMBLY\'S 
MAJORITY RULING ON APRIL 1 THAT THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION 
BE SUBMITTED TO THE AFRC IN TWO SEPARATE PARTS:  ONE 
INCLUDING THE AGREED-ON CLAUSES, AND A SECOND SETTING 
FORTH THE \"UNDEBATED CLAUSES,\" INCLUDING SHARIA.  AFTER 
THE APRIL 1 ASSEMBLY SESSION, PRESS REPORTS CONTINUE, 
NORTHERN MEMBERS \"LAY AMBUSH\" ON CHAIRMAN ANIAGOLU AS HE 
LEFT THE ASSEMBLY TO PROTEST HIS DECISION.  SEVERAL 
MEMBERS FROM THE EAST REPORTEDLY STEPPED IN TO PROTECT 
THE CHAIRMAN, ENDING THE INCIDENT. 
 
4.  IN A PRIVATE MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR LYMAN ON APRIL 
4, SECRETARY TO THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT (FMG) 
CHIEF OLU FALAE (PROTECT - REF D) COMPLAINED THAT CHIEF 
OF GENERAL STAFF VICE ADMIRAL AIKHOMU HAD MISMANAGED THE 
ISSUE; AIKHOMU\'S DECISION TO INSTRUCT THE CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY TO REINSTATE THE SHARIA CLAUSES IN THE DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN MADE IN FALAE\'S ABSENCE.  FALAE 
STATED THAT AIKHOMU LACKS POLITICAL SENSITIVITY TOWARD 
THE ISSUE AND MISUNDERSTOOD THE IMPLICATIONS OF 
RE-INTRODUCING THE DEBATE IN THE CONSTITUENT 
ASSEMBLY--THE SHARPENING OF RELIGIOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN 
MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  THE AFRC\'S MARCH 29 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE 
SHARIA CLAUSES MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN INTERPRETED BY SOME OF OUR 
CONTACTS AND IN PARTS OF THE PRESS AS A DELIBERATE 
ATTEMPT TO STALL SUBMISSION OF THE DOCUMENT AND THUS 
POSTPONE LIFTING THE BAN ON POLITICAL ACTIVITY. 
HOWEVER, THE AFRC\'S INSISTENCE THAT THE DRAFT 
CONSTITUTION BE SUBMITTED ON TIME DESPITE THE 
REINTRODUCTION OF THE CONTENTIOUS SHARIA ISSUE LENDS 
CREDENCE TO FALAE\'S ALLEGATIONS OF FMG MISMANAGEMENT OF 
THE ISSUE.  THE FACT THAT THE NORMALLY VOCAL PRESS WAS 
TOTALLY SILENT ON THE ISSUE TODAY--UNWILLING TO EVEN 
SPECULATE ABOUT THE OUTCOME--AND THAT BABANGIDA IS 
REPORTEDLY IN ABUJA, DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FINAL 
DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SHARIA CLAUSES WILL BE IN 
THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION IS STILL UP FOR GRABS OR THAT A 
COMPROMISE COULD BE WORKED OUT AT THE LAST MINUTE.

SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  MUSLIMS PERSPECTIVES ON SHARIA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  DURING POLOFF\'S TRIP TO THE NORTH 
APRIL 3-14, MUSLIM SPOKESMEN PROTESTED THAT WESTERN 
PORTRAYALS GIVE A DISTORTED PICTURE OF THE SHARIA COURT 
SYSTEM.  CONTRARY TO ITS BRUTAL IMAGE IN THE WEST, THEY 
ASSERT, SHARIA PROVIDES A HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE DETERRENT 
TO WRONGDOING THAT IS COMPATIBLE BOTH WITH MUSLIM ETHICS 
AND THE HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF ISLAM.  MOREOVER, 
CHARGES THAT IT IS A VESTIGE OF \"BACKWARDNESS\" THAT WILL 
BECOME EXTINCT BEFORE THE ADVANCE OF \"MODERNITY\" HAVE 
NOT, THEY STATE, BEEN BORNE OUT IN ACTUALITY.  THE 
EXAMPLES OF SHARIA CASES PROVIDED, WHILE INSUFFICIENT 
EITHER TO VALIDATE OR REFUTE THEIR CONTENTIONS, SHOW HOW 
DEEPLY ENMESHED SHARIA IS IN MUSLIM SOCIETY IN THE NORTH 
AND HOW INTRACTIBLE IT IS LIKELY TO BE AS A POLITICAL 
ISSUE. 
 
3.  IN COMPILING THIS REPORT, POLOFF SPOKE WITH THE 
FOLLOWING PERSONS:  JUSTICE MU\'AZU ALIYU, GRAND KHADI OF 
KADUNA; SHEIK ABUBAKAR MAHMOUD GUMI, LEADER OF THE IZALA 
SECT OF ISLAM; PROFESSOR AUWULU HAMISU YADUDU, HEAD OF 
THE LAW FACULTY, BAYERO UNIVERSITY IN KANO; AND 
PROFESSOR MUHAMMED SANI ZAHRADEEN, HEAD OF THE ISLAMIC 
ARTS AND STUDIES DEPARTMENT, BAYERO UNIVERSITY IN KANO. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
HISTORICAL GENESIS OF SHARIA 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO ZAHRADEEN, THE SHARIA COURTS ARE A 
PRODUCT OF AN HISTORICAL EVOLUTION THAT IS DIFFERENT 
FROM, BUT NO LESS VALID THAN, THAT WHICH OCCURRED IN THE 
WEST.  THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE--WHICH, HE 
ASSERTS, IS THE INTELLECTUAL PREMISE UPON WHICH 
OPPOSITION TO SHARIA IS BASED--IS, HE DECLARED, A 
CONCEPT WHICH ARISES FROM, AND IS SPECIFIC TO, THE 
HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF WESTERN EUROPE.  THOUGH NOW 
DEEPLY ENGRAINED IN THE POLITICAL CULTURE OF THE WEST 
AND OF WESTERNIZED NIGERIANS, IT ONLY BECAME THE NORM, 
HE SAID, AS A RESULT OF CENTURIES-LONG STRUGGLES BETWEEN 
POPES AND KINGS OF CHRISTENDOM WHICH HAVE LITTLE 
RELEVANCE TO OTHER PEOPLES. 
 
5.  INDEED, ZAHRADEEN DECLARED, NEITHER THE ISLAMIC NOR 
ANY OTHER NON-EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION EVOLVED SUCH A 
CONCEPT, AND MUSLIM BELIEF SIMPLY DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 
NOTION OF \"RENDERING UNTO CAESAR THE THINGS THAT ARE 
CAESAR\'S AND TO GOD THE THINGS THAT ARE GOD\'S.\"  IN 
FACT, HE ASSERTED, ISLAM EXPLICITLY DEFINES MAN\'S 
POSITION NOT ONLY IN RELATION TO HIS FELLOW MAN AND TO 
HIS GOD, BUT TO HIS GOVERNMENT AS WELL.  MUHAMMED, HE 
POINTED OUT, WAS THE ONLY MAJOR RELIGIOUS FIGURE TO 
GOVERN A TEMPORAL STATE, AND FROM THIS EVOLVED STRONG 
NOTIONS OF THE INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RELIGIOUS 
ETHICS AND GOVERNMENT.  TO IMPOSE CONCEPTS SUCH AS 
CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION ON THE FOLLOWERS OF ISLAM IS, HE 
OPINED, THE HEIGHT OF WESTERN ETHNOCENTRISM--AN ATTEMPT, 
AS HE PUT IT, TO SUBJUGATE ONE LEGITIMATE SYSTEM OF 
VALUES TO THE BELIEFS OF ANOTHER. 
 
SHARIA AND \"MODERNITY\" 
--------------------- 
 
6.  ECHOING THE ETHNOCENTRISM THEME, YADUDU IN A 
SEPARATE CONVERSATION, STATED THAT WESTERNERS HAVE 
DEVELOPED A NOTION OF AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING 
\"MODERNITY\"--TO WHICH THEY ASSUME ALL HUMANS INVARIABLY 
ASPIRE--THAT TRANSCENDS CULTURE.  THE CORROLLARY TO THAT 
ASSUMPTION, HE SAID, IS THAT ANYTHING THAT IS NOT 
\"MODERN\" IS \"BACKWARD,\" AND THUS DOOMED TO EXTINCTION BY 
THE \"MARCH OF PROGRESS.\"  ALL THESE CONCEPTS, IN 
YADUDU\'S OPINION, ARE IN FACT CULTURE-BOUND, AND IN 
RECENT TIMES HAVE BEEN UNDERGOING REEVALUATION BY 
NON-WESTERN PEOPLES.  WHERE THE WEST WAS ONCE CONSIDERED 
TO BE THE MODEL FOR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, ITS 
EXPERIENCES HAVE, IN HIS OPINION, NOT PROVED TO BE 
UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE AND NON-WESTERN SOCIETIES ARE NOW 
LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DEVELOP THAT ARE IN KEEPING WITH 
THEIR OWN CULTURAL AND ETHICAL PRECEPTS. 
 
7.  TO ILLUSTRATE HIS POINT, YADUDU PROVIDED POLOFF WITH 
THE SYNOPSIS OF HIS DOCTORAL DISSERTATION.  (FYI: 
YADUDU RECEIVED HIS PH.D. IN ISLAMIC LAW FROM HARVARD IN 
1985.  END FYI.)  IN IT, HE TAKES ISSUE WITH WESTERN 
SCHOLARS WHO ASSERT THAT SHARIA WILL FADE FROM THE SCENE 
AS ISLAMIC SOCIETIES ARE DRAWN INCREASINGLY INTO THE 
MATRIX OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL SYSTEMS.  ON THE CONTRARY, 
YADUDU POSITS THAT SHARIA HAS NOW BECOME MORE WIDELY 
ESTABLISHED IN ISLAMIC SOCIETIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND 
AFRICA THAN AT ANYTIME SINCE THE END OF THE COLONIAL 
ERA.  HE ATTRIBUTES THIS TO THREE FACTORS:  ITS 
ADAPTIBLITY AND RESILIENCE TO THE PRESSURES OF 
\"MODERNITY\"; ITS APPROPRIATENESS TO THE WAY MUSLIMS 
LIVE; AND ITS ABILITY TO BRING INTO BALANCE MUSLIM 
ETHICAL AND LEGAL PRINCIPLES. 
 
SHARIA\'S APPEAL IN NIGERIA 
-------------------------- 
 
8.  IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, GRAND KHADI ALIYU ALSO 
SPOKE OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SHARIA TO THE MUSLIM WAY 
OF LIFE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  CONTRARY TO WESTERN 
PORTRAYALS WHICH, HE SAID, EMPHASIZE SUCH SEVERE 
FEATURES OF THE CODE AS PUNISHMENT BY AMPUTATION, MOST 
MUSLIMS CONSIDER SHARIA TO BE A HUMANE AND EFFECTIVE WAY 
OF RIGHTING WRONGS.  IN PARTICULAR, HE SINGLED OUT THE 
ELEMENT OF PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT WHICH COMES FROM AN 
INDIVIDUAL\'S ABILITY TO PRESENT HIS OWN CASE TO THE 
JUDGE.  THOUGH ONE HAS THE CHOICE OF HIRING A LAWYER, 
THIS ABILITY TO \"SAY ONE\'S OWN PIECE,\" SAID ALIYU, GIVES 
THE ORDINARY MUSLIM A GREATER SENSE OF RECEIVING A FAIR 
HEARING THAN IN A WESTERN COURT IN WHICH HIGHLY 
TECHNICAL--AND OFTEN INCOMPREHENSIBLE--BRIEFS ARE 
DEBATED BY ATTORNEYS. 
 
9.  SHEIK GUMI, WHO AT ONE TIME WAS APPOINTED GRAND 
KHADI, DECLARED THAT SHARIA ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF 
EFFICIENCY:  SAVE FOR LAND DISPUTES, WHICH, HE SAID, CAN 
DRAG ON FOR YEARS, MOST CASES CAN BE RESOLVED IN A 
FRACTION OF THE TIME REQUIRED BY WESTERN COURTS.  IN 
ADDITION, HE SAID, SHARIA GIVES GREATER SCOPE FOR MUTUAL 
ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN THE CONTENDING PARTIES:  IN A 
MURDER CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE VICTIM\'S FAMILY HAS THE 
OPTION OF DEMANDING COMPENSATION INSTEAD OF THE DEATH 
PENALTY.  AS FOR AMPUTATION, HE SAID, THE PUNISHMENT HAS 
A DEMONSTRATED EFFECT IN CURBING CRIME:  DISPLAYING THE 
SEVERED HAND OF A THIEF IN THE MARKET PLACE, HE CLAIMED, 
IS A SURE WAY OF DETERRING OTHERS FROM THEFT. 
 
SHARIA IN ACTION 
---------------- 
 
10.  NORTHERNERS PROVIDED VARIOUS EXAMPLES OF THE 
OPERATION OF THE SHARIA COURT SYSTEM WHICH, THEY 
CLAIMED, EXEMPLIFIED BOTH ITS POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES AS A 
LEGAL SYSTEM AND THE REGARD WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE FOR 
IT.  ONE TOLD OF A LAND CASE--ACCORDING TO GRAND KHADI 
ALIYU, BY FAR THE MOST NUMEROUS AND COMPLICATED CASES ON 
HIS DOCKET--IN WHICH A FAMILY PATRIARCH GRANTED USE OF A 
PIECE OF LAND TO A DISPLACED FRIEND FROM ANOTHER 
VILLAGE, SAYING THAT THE MAN WAS \"LIKE MY OWN BROTHER.\" 
WHEN THE PATRIARCH\'S SONS SOUGHT TO REPOSSESS THE LAND 
AFTER THEIR FATHER\'S DEATH, THE FRIEND\'S HEIRS CLAIMED 
THAT THE ALLUSION TO \"BROTHER\" INDICATED INTENT TO CEDE 
THE LAND PERMANENTLY.  THE JUDGE RULED, HOWEVER, THAT 
THE LAND HAD BEEN GRANTED FOR USE IN TIME OF NEED, WHICH 
WAS NO LONGER THE FAMILY\'S CASE, AND SO MUST BE RETURNED 
TO THE DESCENDENTS OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  MOREOVER, THE 
JUDGE REQUIRED THAT COMPENSATION ALSO BE PAIB, NOT 
BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED USE OF THE LAND, BUT BECAUSE 
THEIR ACTIONS CONTRADICTED THE SPIRIT OF FRATERNAL 
AFFECTION WHICH THE PATRIARCH HAD ALWAYS SHOWN THEIR 
KINFOLK.  IN SUCH INSTANCES, OUR INTERLOCUTORS INSISTED, 
A SHARIA COURT COULD REACH A DECISION, WITHIN THE 
ETHICAL CONTEXT UNDERSTOOD BY ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, THAT 
WAS BOTH EQUITABLE AND FAIR. 
 
11.  ASKED FOR AN EXAMPLE OF PROBLEMS COMMON TO SHARIA 
COURTS, ONE INTERLOCUTOR SMILED AND RELATED A STORY 
WHICH HE SAID ILLUSTRATED THE SYSTEM\'S \"HUMAN 
IMPERFECTIONS.\"  AGAINST HER FAMILY\'S ADVICE, HE SAID, A 
WOMAN MARRIED A MAN WHO HAD A DIFFICULT PERSONALITY. 
INITIALLY THINGS WENT WELL AND THE MAN INSTALLED HER IN 
A NEWLY-BUILT HOUSE.  WHEN RELATIONS DETERIORATED, 
HOWEVER, HE TRIED TO REPOSSESS THE HOUSE, BUT WAS TAKEN 
TO COURT BY THE WOMAN WHO CLAIMED THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY 
RELINQUISHED OWNERSHIP TO HER.  UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE 
CASE IN ONE DAY, THE JUDGE ORDERED THE WOMAN TO RETURN 
THE NEXT DAY TO SWEAR TO THE TRUTH OF HER STORY ON THE 
QURAN.  THAT EVENING, WISHING TO FIND A WAY TO SETTLE 
MATTERS AMICABLY, HER FAMILY APPROACHED THE JUDGE AND 
FOR A \"CONSIDERATION\" OF ONE HUNDRED NAIRA OBTAINED HIS 
CONSENT TO PLACE NEWSPAPERS IN THE BINDINGS IN WHICH THE 
QURAN IS CUSTOMARILY WRAPPED.  THE NEXT DAY, THE WOMAN 
DULY--AND UNWITTINGLY--SWORE ON THE WRAPPED NEWSPAPERS, 
WITH THE RESULT THAT EVERYONE WAS SATIFIED:  THE WOMAN 
BECAUSE SHE COULD KEEP THE HOUSE; THE MAN BECAUSE HE WAS 
CONVINCED THAT HER PERJURY ON THE HOLY BOOK WOULD BRING 
DIVINE RETRIBUTION UPON HER; THE FAMILY BECAUSE THEY 
GUARANTEED THAT THE WOMAN HAD NOT FORESWORN HERSELF; AND 
THE JUDGE BECAUSE HE WAS ONE HUNDRED NAIRA RICHER. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  STORIES LIKE THE ONE ABOVE--WHICH IN FACT SOUND 
RATHER LIKE FABLES--ARE UNLIKELY TO PERSUADE THE 
UNCONVINCED OF THE EFFICACY OF THE SHARIA COURTS. 
NEVERTHELESS, THEY ARE SYMPTOMATIC OF THE DEPTH OF 
COMMITMENT WHICH THE SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF EVOKING IN THE 
NORTH.  IMPLICIT IN THEIR ANALYSES AND ANECDOTES IS THE 
BELIEF THAT SHARIA IS INTRINSIC TO ISLAMIC LIFE IN 
NORTHERN NIGERIA--A PATTERN OF LIFE WHICH THEY HOLD TO 
BE AS LEGITIMATE AS ANY OTHER AND WHICH THEY WISH TO SEE 
EVOLVE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PRECEPTS, NOT THOSE OF 
OUTSIDERS. 
 
13.  THEIR VIEWS ARE ALL THE MORE STRONGLY HELD BECAUSE 
NORTHERN MUSLIMS SEE THEIR WAY OF LIFE AS UNDER THREAT. 
IN CONTRAST TO THE ALLEGATIONS OF SOUTHERNERS THAT THE 
NORTH IS INTENT ON THE \"ISLAMICIZATION\" OF NIGERIA, 
NORTHERN MUSLIMS FEEL THAT IT IS THEY AND THEIR BELIEFS 
THAT ARE UNDER ATTACK, NOT SIMPLY FROM CHRISTIANS, BUT 
FROM THE PRESSURE OF A MODERN, WESTERN MATERIALISM WHOSE 
VALUES ARE INIMICAL TO THEIR OWN.  WHILE THEY SEEM 
UNSURE AS TO HOW TO ACCOMMODATE CHANGE WITHIN THAT VALUE 
SYSTEM, THEY CLEARLY-INTEND TO DEFEND THOSE VALUES WITH 
ALL MEANS AT THEIR DISPOSAL. 
 
14.  THE DILEMMA WHICH THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE THUS FACES 
IS HOW TO RECONCILE SUCH FERVENT CONVICTIONS WITH THOSE 
HELD WITH EQUAL ARDOR BY CHRISTIANS--WHO, AS ZAHRADEEN 
RIGHTLY STATES, SUPPORT SUCH CONCEPTS AS CHURCH-STATE 
SEPARATION AS STRONGLY AS MUSLIMS ABJURE IT.  ASKED HOW 
HE WOULD RESOLVE SUCH OPPOSED VIEWPOINTS, ZAHRADEEN 
PROPOSED A COMPROMISE, BASED ON ESTABLISHING TWO 
PARALLEL COURT SYSTEMS:  IN THIS WAY, HE CLAIMED, EVERY 
NIGERIAN CITIZEN COULD CHOOSE THE SYSTEM HE PREFERRED. 
CHRISTIANS, HOWEVER, ARE LIKELY TO SEE THIS LESS AS A 
COMPROMISE THAN AS AN ATTEMPT TO EXTEND SHARIA\'S 
JURISDICTION, SO AS TO ENCOMPASS CHRISTIAN POPULATIONS 
UNDER ITS AUTHORITY.  (FYI:  PRESENTED WITH THIS 
INTERPRETATION, ZAHRADEEN CONCEDED THAT SOME CHRISTIANS 
MIGHT INDEED SEE HIS PROPOSAL SO; POLOFF HAD THE 
IMPRESSION THAT HE ESPOUSED IT LESS FROM CONVICTION THAN 
AS A BARGAINING CHIP WITH SOUTHERNERS.  END FYI.) 
 
15.  SHARIA THUS SEEMS TO HAVE ENTERED AN EMOTIONAL AND 
SYMBOLIC DIMENSION THAT TRANSCENDS THE LEGAL 
IMPLICATIONS, AND EVEN THE.POLITICAL PARAMETERS, OF THE 
DEBATE ITSELF.  THOUGH INDIVIDUALS ON EACH SIDE APPEAR 
TO TAKE A HARDLINE IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE A BETTER 
BARGAINING POSITION, NEITHER CAMP REALLY FEELS THAT IT 
CAN CONCEDE ON THE ISSUE WITHOUT DOING INJURY TO ITS 
FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OR SUFFERING A MAJOR LOSS OF 
FACE.  EACH SIDE CAN SEE REASON IN ITS OWN CASE, BUT 
ONLY MALEVOLENCE IN THAT OF THE OPPOSITION.  GIVEN THE 
PRESENT EMOTIONAL IMPASSE, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER 
THE MILITARY AUTHORITIES CAN REACH A DECISION ON 
INCLUDING--OR NOT INCLUDING--SHARIA IN THE CONSTITUTION 
OF THE THIRD REPUBLIC WHICH CAN LOWER THE PASSIONS WHICH 
THIS ISSUE HAS AROUSED.  END COMMENT.

TAGS: EAIR, ECON, NI 
SUBJECT: FUTURE OF NIGERIA AIRWAYS 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: The wetlease agreement of Nigeria Airways 
Limited (NAL) with 
Air Atlanta Icelandic (AAI) was set to expire on September 
19, but was extended 
at the last minute.  The Ministry of Aviation had hoped until 
the last moment to 
replace NAL with a new national carrier, Air Nigeria, through 
a joint venture 
agreement with the UK-based Airwing Aerospace Limited (AAL). 
Because Nigeria 
lacks ICAO\'s Category I safety status, however, NAL would not 
have been able to 
fly alone into the United States.  In addition, Air Nigeria 
could not have begun 
operations on September 20 because the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration has 
not received documentation from the new airline.  Moreover, 
an inter-ministerial 
committee formed to advise the GON on the legitimacy of the 
proposed joint venture 
has yet to begin deliberations.  Had NAL failed to extend its 
current wetlease by 
September 20, operations on the popular Lagos-New York route 
would have been suspended. 
The Ministry of Aviation has dodged that bullet, but still 
has a politically difficult 
row to hoe before Air Nigeria can lift off.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (U) On September 17, Abuja-based ECON FSN Specialist met 
with Tony Anufor, Special 
Assistant to the Minister of Aviation, who asserted knowing 
nothing about plans 
to extend NAL\'s wetlease.  Anufor confirmed, however, that 
preparations for the new 
carrier have been put on hold pending the recommendation of 
the inter-ministerial 
committee that will review the proposed joint venture. 
Initially, the Ministry had hoped 
that Air Nigeria might have begun operating on September 20 
under the joint venture 
agreement.  Under it, the GON\'s equity share would have been 
51 percent, secured 
through the liquidation of NAL assets.  Officials from the 
Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority (NCAA) informed EconOff that Airwing had planned on 
Singapore Airways\' managing 
the operations. 
 
 
3. (U)  Early September 18, Chris Aligbe, Public Affairs 
Manager for NAL, informed 
Lagos-based EconOff that NAL intended to continue its 
Lagos-New York operations 
through an extension of NAL\'s actual wetlease.  NAL\'s 
Managing Director hoped to 
secure a deal with AAI within two days.  Aligbe expected the 
extension would be 
in effect until Air Nigeria receives GON approval of the 
joint venture and acquires 
FAA-approved equipment and crew.  Late September 18, Aligbe 
informed EconOff that 
Nigeria Airways had just extended its wetlease agreement with 
Air Atlanta, presumably 
until the issue about Air Nigeria is resolved. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  The future of the Air Nigeria deal remains 
uncertain.  After hearing of complaints by the Bureau of 
Public Enterprises, President Obasanjo established 
a twelve-person committee to review the agreement.  Members 
of the committee include 
representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Finance, 
Aviation, and the Bureau of 
Public Enterprises (BPE).  The BPE argues that the Ministry 
is challenging the 
BPE\'s privatization authority.  Contacts report that the BPE 
is engaged in discussions 
to sell NAL to a South African group.  This issue will most 
likely be reviewed by the 
committee, whose deliberations were to have begun on 
September 16, but were delayed 
until September 20 owing to the ongoing voter registration. 
Denying press reports that 
the committee is investigating the Ministry of Aviation\'s 
actions in the deal, the 
Minister\'s Special Assistant characterized the accusations as 
\"evil schemes of people 
who do not like (Minister Chikwe).\" 
 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  Even if President Obasanjo has signed off 
on the joint venture agreement, as 
Minister Chikwe contends in the press, Air Nigeria\'s future 
is uncertain.  The inter- 
ministerial committee must review the agreement to ensure 
that it meets governmental 
guidelines, and the BPE is likely to recommend against 
approval.  End Comment.

Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary.  A trip to Ibadan in Oyo State shows 
residents of the southwest are already revving up for the 
elections in 2003. Dr. Omulolu Olunloyo, who was governor of 
Oyo State more than a decade ago, has decided to come out of 
semi-retirement to run again for that office \"for the good of 
the nation.\"   Dr. Anthony Marinho, medical doctor and 
community activist, wants to run his successful citizenship 
program to prepare voters for the upcoming elections. End 
summary. 
 
 
Blast from the past - Olunloyo wants to be governor again 
 
 
2. (U) On a recent trip to Ibadan to make introductory calls 
on local politicians and NGOs, PolOffs met with Dr. (Chief) 
Omololu Olunloyo, former Governor of Oyo State (1983). 
Olunloyo was warm and welcoming, but said that he did not 
grant interviews or meetings these days to \"just anybody.\" 
He said he wanted Nigeria\'s friends to remember that Nigeria 
is the most populous and important country in sub-Saharan 
Africa and that it has a history of credibility in the 
international community.  However, the country is at a 
crossroads in its journey towards democracy and a stable 
economy, so Olunloyo has decided to run for Governor because 
\"things are at such a bad pass in Nigeria someone needs to 
step forward and show the people how things should be done.\" 
Although he heads a highly successful civil engineering firm, 
Olunloyo has sought or accepted positions in government at 
various times over the past thirty years.  His last foray 
into politics was in 1992 when he was proposed as a possible 
vice president for the Socialist Democratic Party 
presidential candidate, the late Major General Shehu 
Yar\'adua.  (Comment. The elections in 1992 were nullified and 
the late military ruler, Sani Abacha, was installed as 
leader.  Yar\'adua, was imprisoned in 1995 for pushing Abacha 
to step down and allow a return to civilian government by 
1996.  Yar\'adua died in prison in 1997. End comment.) 
 
 
3. (U)  While strolling through his small English garden 
(geese on the lawn and yew hedges), Olunloyo expounded on the 
problems facing Nigeria and what he thought could be done to 
solve them.  \"I should be able to retire now, pass the baton 
to someone else and watch the political race from the 
sidelines,\" he mused. However, Nigeria, despite billions in 
oil revenue and a return to a civilian government after 
sixteen years of military rule, \"hadn\'t really gotten 
anywhere.\"  Olunloyo believes that to make progress Nigeria 
needs first, a majority of the people willing to sacrifice to 
improve and advance as a nation, and, second, a government 
that has the ability to meet the needs of the people.  He 
said that one of his goals, should he be elected, would be to 
work to get international assistance of every kind, \"to make 
Nigeria a better place for all its citizens.  There is no 
need to waste time re-inventing the wheel.\"  Nigerians must 
learn from other modern nations, not just the U.S. and 
Britain.  He pointed to the nations of Asia and Europe that 
recovered from the devastation of World War II to become 
global competitors. 
 
 
4. (U) Back in his book-filled office, Olunloyo expressed his 
ideas on the political scene, saying that many in the current 
government, especially at the local and State level, were 
\"risen from poverty and are the first in their families or 
groups to be successful.\"  He proposed that what Nigeria 
needs is to draw its leaders from the pool of highly 
educated, professional and experienced Nigerians both 
in-country and abroad. On the economy, Olunloyo agreed with 
most modern economists that Nigeria could not continue to 
rely on its one highly profitable but depletable 
resource--oil.  However, he found economic opportunity in 
areas rejected as too long-term to be helpful by several 
Nigerians we have talked to.  Olunloyo says Nigeria has a 
wealth of historical resources to depend on other than oil. 
He mentioned agriculture, food crop production, food 
processing, textiles, and herbal medicines.  He hinted that 
he had information that the Nigerian Institute for the Study 
of Herbal Medicines was close to an herbal treatment for 
HIV/AIDS.  He concluded, saying \"I am optimistic that the 
remedy for Nigeria\'s problems is in our own hands, and with 
help from our friends in the international community, we will 
realize our greatness.\" 
 
 
Gynecologist with a broad view 
 
 
5. (U)  The trip across the city of Ibadan to meet with Dr. 
Anthony Marinho says much about the state of the 
infrastructure in southern Nigeria.  The road to Ibadan is 
the main road north from the port of Lagos and is a major 
trucking route.  For much of the distance between the two 
cities the road is well-maintained, and though traffic is 
heavy with trucks and private vehicles, it moves at highway 
speeds.  Entering the city, traffic on this route (which 
becomes the main street through the city) snarls and comes to 
a complete standstill due to the road\'s condition.  On the 
way to the meeting PolOffs were held for an hour while 
traffic eased around a large truck that had capsized 
navigating past an axle-deep pothole that stretched across 
the width of the road.  (Comment. The evening before on the 
way to dinner on the same road, driving was made even more 
challenging by the lack of working street lights anywhere in 
the city.  One is warned to take pothole-evasion action when 
the taillights of the vehicle in front disappear.  End 
comment.)  Nonetheless, we arrived for our meeting only a few 
minutes late. 
6. (U) Dr. Marinho is a Nigeria-trained and practicing 
obstetrician and gynecologist.  He is more well-known in the 
southwest, however, as a community activist and founder of 
Educare Trust.  Educare is an NGO started in 1994 stating its 
purposes were \"to improve education at all levels for our 
girls and boys..., to promote civic education, democracy and 
good governance in the belief that these are fundamental to 
sustainable development..., and to emphasize the development 
of morals and avoidance of social vices such as smoking, AIDS 
and drugs.\"  The headquarters are located on one floor of a 
small, well-maintained office building, and are equipped with 
computers and other usual office machines.  Educare has 
developed literature, seminars and workshops that cover 
subjects from AIDS to voter registration.  At the 
headquarters, Educare offers young people basic computer 
training, career guidance, and special tutoring.  There is 
also a tiny library geared to the secondary school student. 
Of particular interest to PolOffs was the citizenship/voter 
education program that Educare had developed with USAID 
funding for the 1999 elections.  According to Marinho, this 
program was very successful at the time and a similar program 
was needed for the upcoming elections.  Marinho said that the 
most important element was to encourage all voters to 
register, especially those citizens who had either not 
registered in the last elections or those who had come of 
voting age since the 1999 elections. 
 
 
7. (C) Comment.  Olunloyo is a member of President Obasanjo\'s 
party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) and served with 
Yar\'adua in Obasanjo\'s first administration in 1989.  He told 
us he has set his sights on the \"small job\" of being governor 
of Oyo State, and he studiously avoided comment on Obasanjo\'s 
current administration or the impeachment attempt.  It is 
still early in the run-up to elections and Olunloyo\'s 
candidacy appears to be a cat\'s paw to tease the entrenched 
Alliance for Democracy (AD) party that currently controls the 
southwest by showing it that the PDP can field a credible 
candidate.  Whether Olunloyo will stay in the race appears 
doubtful.  Marinho is apolitical, but well-respected, 
well-known, and influential in the southwest.  Although he 
claims no party affiliation, he has shown that his 
organizations and associates are effective at encouraging 
youth to participate in good government. He continues to 
receive funding and donations from private industry here and 
from the international community and charitable foundations. 
He may be a significant factor in the upcoming elections in 
energizing the youth vote and in voter registration in Oyo 
State.

D (D). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary.  While electoral divisions are under growing 
media scrutiny, most southern political analysts privately 
acknowledge that fears of imminent secessionism are unfounded 
at present. Though some disgruntled groups demand the 
creation of their own state within the federation, most do 
not call for complete severance.  Issues reinforcing 
political cohesion in the South include momentum towards a 
national conference, interest over upcoming elections, 
potential spoils of oil revenue, and the ICJ ruling on 
Bakassi.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CURRENT SOUTHERN SECESSIONIST RUMBLINGS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) The latest secessionist threat was declared on 
December 20, 2002 by Lagos-based lawyer Festus Keyamo, who 
announced the creation of an \"Unarmed Revolutionary Council\" 
to govern the \"Future Republic of the Niger-Delta,\" complete 
with flag, national anthem, and coat of arms.  According to 
press reports, Keyamo warned that the \"future republic\" would 
emerge if Nigeria failed to convene a national congress, 
engage \"true fiscal and political federalism,\" and enact the 
on-shore/off-shore abrogation bill.  Keyamo hoped the 
announcement would \"raise the consciousness\" of the 
South-South\'s oil-producing states.  The movement\'s slogan is 
\"This is a revolution, and it must succeed.\"  (Comment. 
Readers might take note that at the beginning of 2002, Keyamo 
was in the press because of his defense of the first person 
detained for Bola Ige\'s murder.  The episode became quite 
sordid as the defendant recanted then readmitted the crime. 
Keyamo\'s brother implicated him in a fraud.  All the while, 
Keyamo was an eager interviewee before any journalist he 
could find, reveling in the attention.  End comment.) 
 
 
3. (U) Other well-known southern groups with secessionist 
tendencies or platforms include the Movement for the 
Sovereign State for Biafra (MASSOB), the Ijaw Youth Congress 
(IYC), the Egbesu Supreme Council, and the Coalition of Oodua 
Self-determine Groups (COSEG), which consists of the Oodua 
Peoples Congress (OPC), Oodua Liberation Movement (OLM), 
Oodua Youth Movement (OYM), Yoruba Revolutionary Movement 
(YOREM), and the Federation of Yoruba Consciousness and 
Culture (FYCC).  These groups held a joint press conference 
in September to decry the voter registration exercise, which 
they charged was \"tailored to favor the Hausa/Fulani North.\" 
They publicly called for a UN plebiscite to determine 
Nigeria\'s future, including the right to ethnic 
self-determination and secession from the Federation.  The 
groups pledged to \"fight together for each nationality to be 
independent and build her own sovereign state, as an 
independent member of the United Nations.\"  (Comment. 
Subsequent research will give us a fix on how serious and 
potent we think these groups are and whether we think the 
statement was rhetoric to rally the constituencies back home 
and to frighten the GON into giving them a bit more 
assistance.  End comment.) 
------------------------------- 
SECESSION NOT IMMINENT, FOR NOW 
------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) Despite rancorous posturing from some quarters and 
debate over the Miss World fiasco, individuals from major 
southern ethnic groups refute their compatriots\' claims to be 
on the verge of secession.  Though fearful the situation may 
change, Patriots leader Rotimi Williams told Poloffs on 
November 15 that Nigeria \"is not at a critical stage yet. 
This is the opportunity stage to prevent deterioration of the 
country.\"  As the head of a group of senior Nigerian 
statesmen, Williams envisions that a worst-case scenario 
could emerge whereby frustrated ethnic groups begin agitating 
again for a \"political breakaway,\" either through peaceful 
negotiation or through war.  Although Williams expects the 
GON would \"crush\" any violent rebellion, the underlying 
discontent \"will come again\" if frustrations are not 
addressed. 
 
 
5. (U) Nigeria\'s older generation remembers the root causes 
of conflict that led to the Biafran War\'s outbreak, but the 
South\'s younger generation mostly remembers the war\'s 
terrible consequences.  The idea of launching another civil 
war repulses young professionals and workers from across the 
South, many of whom were born during or survived childhood 
through the war.  Throughout the southern states, stories can 
be heard about the severe economic hardship endured through 
the war years and beyond.  Many Southerners still recount 
tragic fates suffered by family members who were killed 
directly, by collateral violence, or through starvation. 
 
 
6. (U) TRACES OF UNITY AMIDST ETHNIC DIVERSITY.  Though 
diminished since 1999, unifying forces of shared history and 
political struggle against military rule hold meaning for 
many Nigerians.  Ardent pessimists of Nigeria\'s cohesion 
concede that traditional ethnic groups today are weaving a 
new pattern in the nation\'s political cloth.  With near 
consensus, the South sees the June 12, 1993 national election 
as a major turning point, the effects of which continue to 
reverberate.  Legborsi Saro Pyagbara of the Movement for the 
Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) calls June 12 a \"true 
water-shed day\" in which the public \"forgot about ethnic 
differences\" to condemn the election\'s annulment.  Hundreds 
of other analysts, pundits, poets and artists publicly share 
his view. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
FIX IT AND MAKE US PART OF IT, OR WE\'LL ABANDON IT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
7. (C) ON-GOING CALLS FOR A NATIONAL CONVENTION.  Most 
critics of the status quo focus on improving Nigeria\'s 
legitimacy, threatening secession only as a last resort.  The 
two most frequent proposals to redress on-going southern 
grievances are to hold a national convention and to 
decentralize federal resource control.  The most popular 
incarnations of these ideas are the holding of a national 
convention and the approval of the on-shore/off-shore 
abrogation bill.  The national conference proposal has been 
floated for years without much forward momentum.  NGOs 
regularly lobby and educate key political figures on the 
potential benefits of such an exercise, hoping to convince 
powerbrokers that one could be held without negating 
entrenched interests.  Reformists and NGOs seeking long-term 
stability argue that geopolitical groups must send their 
respective representatives to forge a new social compact on 
unity and the role of Nigerian government.  Serious, divisive 
issues impeding national cooperation must be discussed openly 
in a forum to devise new rules about how differences will be 
peaceably settled.  The meaningful legitimacy of the current 
constitution is dangerously low, they warn, as it is a 
document inherited from military rulers. (Comment.  We should 
keep in mind that the 1999 Constitution is basically a 
recycled 1977 Constitution, and that was drafted primarily by 
civilians, albeit under the authority of the Murtala/Obasanjo 
regime.  The kinds of people who participated in both the 
1977-78 drafting process and the 1994-5 Constitutional 
Conference (its document was never adopted) were much the 
same societal elements who would be likely candidates to 
participate in a national conference.  End comment.) 
 
 
8. (C) The South-South \"in particular feels strongly that 
areas have been neglected,\" Williams asserts.  For this 
reason, his Patriots group advocates restructuring the 
constitution to eliminate the belief that \"no one will ever 
be president from the South-South\" and that \"unless one 
belongs to the majority ethnic groups, one stands no chance 
at all.\"  To Williams, as long as Nigerian minority groups 
feel they are treated as \"second class citizens,\" a serious 
threat to cohesion exists.  He believes minority groups will 
not even try to contest in a system that seems to guarantee 
rule by groups historically dominating Nigerian politics. 
Asked whether \" zoning\", the presidency according to 
ethnicity does not encourage tribal divisions, Williams 
disagreed.  He argued that if society is to \"mature\" toward 
equal opportunity devoid of ethnic opportunism, an 
institutionalized power-sharing arrangement must be 
implemented at least on a short-term basis. 
 
 
9. (C) While some Nigerians fear a national convention would 
re-ignite disgruntled groups\' secessionist tendencies, others 
argue such a meeting would diffuse underlying tensions and 
initiate a productive way forward.  The Committee for the 
Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) claims that a national 
convention will \"raise Nigerians\' adrenaline but not lead us 
to kill ourselves.\"  Had a convention been \"called during the 
military years, the Niger Delta would have called for 
secession,\" CDHR posits.  In today\'s civilian climate, 
particularly with the Bakassi issue at present (paragraphs 
11-12), a national conference is unlikely to fan the embers 
of secessionism, they argue. 
 
 
10.  (C) Meanwhile, some groups are calling for the creation 
of their own state within the federation.  One of the groups 
most disappointed by the nation\'s lack-luster performance in 
meeting public needs is the Ogoni people of Rivers State. 
The Ogoni believe they were martyred as a people for Nigerian 
democracy, but many resent receiving so few dividends to 
date.  In meetings held during a recent fact-finding mission 
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
the National Commissioner for Refugees, and Poloffs, Ogoni 
members asserted that their only hope was to have an Ogoni 
state with its own resources administered according to their 
own decisions (septel). 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
MUTUAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN INTRIGUE:  WHAT IF . . . . 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
11. (C) BAKASSI AND THE LIMITS OF ETHNIC AUTONOMY.  CDHR 
thinks the October 10 ruling on Bakassi by the International 
Court of Justice further diminished the South\'s impulse 
towards secessionism by reminding it of its need for northern 
military coverage.  \"Bakassi has reminded the South that we 
live better together,\" remarked Belo Aideloje, Secretary 
General of CDHR. Combining the regions together, \"Nigeria is 
seen as so mighty that no one (e.g. Cameroon) could stand up 
to it.\"  The \"mutual need for security\" has sparked a \"spirit 
of kith and kinship among communities of the South-South, 
South-East, and South-West,\" claims CDHR. Therefore, 
perceived mutual security needs has undercut ethnic 
animosities, they conclude.  \"There is an overestimation of 
the strength of ethnic groups.  Each tribe knows its limits. 
People are careful to not be pushed outside the tensile 
strength of their own group,\" CDHR explains.  Yet, it 
concedes that these ties have not been as well developed 
between the South and the North. 
 
 
12. (C) Another source discounts the mutual security theory, 
claiming Obasanjo\'s true agenda is in fact to replace 
northern hegemony of the armed forces with diversified 
officers at the lower ranks.  Proceeding slowly, carefully 
and quietly, avoiding media attention which would unravel the 
whole endeavor, Obasanjo has progressed to the point that the 
South no longer depends on the North for military support, he 
argues.  Nevertheless, CDHR asserts, the South still believes 
military power is a northern product, a perception which 
reinforces cohesion. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
RIVALRY FOR SCARCE RESOURCES: STEEP CHALLENGES AHEAD 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
13. (C) Many, if not most, analysts fear uneven resource 
distribution and economic hardship are steadily corroding the 
country\'s stability.  Daily street scuffles across the South 
have varied causes, but some relate to the question of 
national unity. George Ehusani, Secretary General of the 
Catholic Secretariat, blames most of the violence on poverty, 
which impedes Nigeria\'s forming \"a melting pot like the 
United States.\"  Given \"impoverished conditions,\" he finds it 
unsurprising that violence erupts with \"people biting each 
other.\"  Competition over resources is often expressed as a 
conflict between \"indigenes\" and \"settlers,\" two concepts 
whose precise definitions can differ wildly from one village 
to the next.  Ehusani sees most of Nigeria\'s current threats 
to cohesion in these terms, including the complexities of 
expanding Shari\'a. 
 
 
14. (C) Ehusani, who traveled to Kigali last fall, is 
publishing his analysis of potential lessons Nigeria can 
learn from the Rwandan genocide.  He fears \"ethnic 
antipathies, combined with long-standing issues of perceived 
or real injustice, mixed with severe economic depression\" 
could spark similar mass violence in Nigeria.  While the 
military regimes \"suppressed genocidal sentiments,\" under 
democracy, the situation now may be \"boiling over.\" 
\"Disorganized violence,\" Ehusani argues, is manifest between 
poor individuals.  \"If violence is organized by a Big Man,\" 
on the other hand, he fears it is used in Nigeria to 
\"manipulate the Small Man versus the Small Man to the gain of 
the elite.\"  He claims religious teachings of peace and 
forgiveness are the main deterrents to all-out class warfare 
and mass violence in Nigeria.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
15. (C) Nigerian unity may prove more resilient than expected 
from a cursory glance at the headlines on present violence 
and political posturing.  Following Ehusani\'s theory of 
Nigerian conflict, one might ask what a \"Big Man\" might 
expect to gain from an organized secessionist movement and 
whether current political conditions make this strategy 
attractive.  At the moment, Southerners are asserting their 
agendas tenaciously within the actual political framework and 
appear willing to see what opportunities may be yielded by 
upcoming elections.  \"Big Men\" are busily seeking to maximize 
their share in the present political arena; \"Small Men\" are 
waiting to see what will happen next. 
16. (C) Uncertainty about the potential for electoral 
violence associated with the coming polls is generating 
excitement, nervousness, and speculation.  Still, the 
expectation that elections indeed will take place as 
scheduled in April and May is surprisingly widespread in the 
South.  This expectation seems to be putting frustrations 
over the slow pace of progress on hold, even as challengers 
to incumbent officials engage rhetoric that is increasing 
public attention to problems the government has left 
unsolved.  In some cases, anger over unresponsive government 
is being channeled into determination that the next 
government will be more responsive to their needs.  Sincere 
or not, opportunists will keep threatening to secede to mount 
pressure on an otherwise unresponsive government. 
17. (C) While the loudest commentators clamor for their 
ethnic group\'s representation at the government\'s helm, 
candidates who adopt popular issues in their platforms may 
bolster Southerners\' commitment to democracy and the nation. 
Issues are not yet in vogue among politicians, but issues 
such as infrastructure, health care, and employment have 
nationwide relevance and popularity (septel).  A few 
forward-thinking politicians are testing the plausibility of 
capitalizing on some issues\' popularity for their political 
ambitions.  General Ibrahim Babangida, one of the savviest 
politicians, recently condoned the possible utility of a 
national conference (reftel).  However contrived a 
convention\'s outcome, the mere exercise would be highly 
welcomed by many Southerners.  Politicians also have yet to 
exploit the positive nation-building sentiments related to 
the June 12, 1993 events.  How to seize the spirit of unity 
engendered by the events without raising painful memories or 
embarrassing past political actors remains problematic. 
Creative and nation-minded leaders may find a way yet.  End 
comment. 
 
 
18. (C) ((BIO NOTE:  Festus Keyamo, a human rights activist 
and lawyer based in Maryland, Lagos, has been embroiled in 
many of Nigeria\'s top scandals from the past two years.  He 
is currently under SSS and police monitoring, having been 
released conditionally from arrest several days ago.  Keyamo 
was detained for questioning after he declared his intention 
to defend Chris Nwokobia, the self-styled leader of the 
\"Youth Democratic Movement\" which claimed responsibility for 
the fire at NNPC (septel).  The fire began just days after 
Keyamo\'s public pronouncement of the Future Republic of Niger 
Delta.  Other battles Keyamo has recently fought in the glare 
of national media include his defense of those accused of 
killing Attorney General Bola Ige in December 2001 and a suit 
he brought against the Federal Government over aviation 
safety issues.  Colleagues say Keyamo is not necessarily 
involved directly in any conspiracies, but his taste for high 
profile cases often leads him to prominent involvement in 
bizarre cases.  He reputedly seeks public attention and loves 
the limelight.  One source argues that Keyamo, a sound enough 
lawyer, has trouble distinguishing between what is a serious 
matter for democracy and social progress versus a personal 
opportunity for notoriety.))

SUBJECT: SOUTHERN SECESSION UNLIKELY DESPITE TENSIONS 
 
 
REF: FBIS 071146Z DEC 02 
 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES.  REASON:  1.5 (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Summary.  While electoral divisions are under growing 
media scrutiny, most southern political analysts privately 
acknowledge that fears of imminent secessionism are unfounded 
at present. Though some disgruntled groups demand the 
creation of their own state within the federation, most do 
not call for complete severance.  Issues reinforcing 
political cohesion in the South include momentum towards a 
national conference, interest over upcoming elections, 
potential spoils of oil revenue, and the ICJ ruling on 
Bakassi.  Despite relative low risk at present, GON 
sensitivity to any potential secessionist war may influence 
decisions on domestic and foreign political issues.  End 
summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
CURRENT SOUTHERN SECESSIONIST RUMBLINGS 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) The latest secessionist threat was declared on 
December 20, 2002 by Lagos-based lawyer Festus Keyamo, who 
announced the creation of an \"Unarmed Revolutionary Council\" 
to govern the \"Future Republic of the Niger-Delta,\" complete 
with flag, national anthem, and coat of arms.  According to 
press reports, Keyamo warned that the \"future republic\" would 
emerge if Nigeria failed to convene a sovereign national 
congress, engage \"true fiscal and political federalism,\" and 
enact the on-shore/off-shore abrogation bill.  Keyamo hoped 
the announcement would \"raise the consciousness\" of the 
South-South\'s oil-producing states.  The movement\'s slogan is 
\"This is a revolution, and it must succeed.\" 
 
 
3. (U) Other well-known southern groups with secessionist 
tendencies or platforms include the Movement for the 
Sovereign State for Biafra (MASSOB), the Ijaw Youth Congress 
(IYC), the Egbesu Supreme Council, and the Coalition of Oodua 
Self-determine Groups (COSEG), which consists of the Oodua 
Peoples Congress (OPC), Oodua Liberation Movement (OLM), 
Oodua Youth Movement (OYM), Yoruba Revolutionary Movement 
(YOREM), and the Federation of Yoruba Consciousness and 
Culture (FYCC).  These groups held a joint press conference 
in September to decry the voter registration exercise, which 
they charged was \"tailored to favor the Hausa/Fulani North.\" 
They publicly called for a UN plebiscite to determine 
Nigeria\'s future, including the right to ethnic 
self-determination and secession from the Federation.  The 
groups pledged to \"fight together for each nationality to be 
independent and build her own sovereign state, as an 
independent member of the United Nations.\" 
 
 
------------------------------- 
SECESSION NOT IMMINENT, FOR NOW 
------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (C) Despite rancorous posturing from some quarters and 
debate over the Miss World fiasco, individuals from major 
southern ethnic groups refute their compatriots\' claims to be 
on the verge of secession.  Though fearful the situation may 
change, Patriots leader Rotimi Williams told Poloffs on 
November 15 that Nigeria \"is not at a critical stage yet. 
This is the opportunity stage to prevent deterioration of the 
country.\"  As the head of a group of senior Nigerian 
statesmen, Williams envisions that a worst-case scenario 
could emerge whereby frustrated ethnic groups begin agitating 
again for a \"political breakaway,\" either through peaceful 
negotiation or through war.  Although Williams expects the 
GON would \"crush\" any violent rebellion, the underlying 
discontent \"will come again\" if frustrations are not 
addressed. 
 
 
5. (U) Nigeria\'s older generation remembers the root causes 
of conflict that led to the Biafran War\'s outbreak, but the 
South\'s younger generation mostly remembers the war\'s 
terrible consequences.  The idea of launching another civil 
war repulses young professionals and workers from across the 
South, many of whom were born during or survived childhood 
through the war.  Throughout the southern states, stories can 
be heard about the severe economic hardship endured through 
the war years and beyond.  Many Southerners still recount 
tragic fates suffered by family members who were killed 
directly, by collateral violence, or through starvation. 
 
 
6. (U) TRACES OF UNITY AMIDST ETHNIC DIVERSITY.  Though 
diminished since 1999, unifying forces of shared history and 
political struggle against military rule hold meaning for 
many Nigerians.  Ardent pessimists of Nigeria\'s cohesion 
concede that traditional ethnic groups today are weaving a 
new pattern in the nation\'s political cloth.  With near 
consensus, the South sees the June 12, 1993 national election 
as a major turning point, the effects of which continue to 
reverberate.  Legborsi Saro Pyagbara of the Movement for the 
Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) calls June 12 a \"true 
water-shed day\" in which the public \"forgot about ethnic 
differences\" to condemn the election\'s annulment.  Hundreds 
of other analysts, pundits, poets and artists publicly share 
his view. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
FIX IT AND MAKE US PART OF IT, OR WE\'LL ABANDON IT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
7. (C) ON-GOING CALLS FOR A NATIONAL CONVENTION.  Most 
critics of the status quo focus on improving Nigeria\'s 
legitimacy, threatening secession only as a last resort.  The 
two most frequent proposals to redress on-going southern 
grievances are to hold a national convention and to 
decentralize federal resource control.  The most popular 
incarnations of these ideas are the \"sovereign\" national 
convention and the on-shore/off-shore abrogation bill.  The 
national conference proposal has been floated for years 
without much forward momentum.  NGOs regularly lobby and 
educate key political figures on the potential benefits of 
such an exercise, hoping to convince powerbrokers that one 
could be held without negating entrenched interests. 
Reformists and NGOs seeking long-term stability argue that 
geopolitical groups must send their respective 
representatives to forge a new social compact on unity and 
the role of Nigerian government.  Serious, divisive issues 
impeding national cooperation must be discussed openly in a 
forum to devise new rules about how differences will be 
peaceably settled.  The meaningful legitimacy of the current 
constitution is dangerously low, they warn, as it is a 
document inherited from military rulers. 
 
 
8. (C) The South-South \"in particular feels strongly that 
areas have been neglected,\" Williams asserts.  For this 
reason, his Patriots group advocates restructuring the 
constitution to eliminate the belief that \"no one will ever 
be president from the South-South\" and that \"unless one 
belongs to the majority ethnic groups, one stands no chance 
at all.\"  To Williams, as long as Nigerian minority groups 
feel they are treated as \"second class citizens,\" a serious 
threat to cohesion exists.  He believes minority groups will 
not even try to contest in a system that seems to guarantee 
rule by groups historically dominating Nigerian politics. 
Asked whether \"zoning\", the presidency according to 
ethnicity does not encourage tribal divisions, Williams 
disagreed.  He argued that if society is to \"mature\" toward 
equal opportunity devoid of ethnic opportunism, an 
institutionalized power-sharing arrangement must be 
implemented at least on a short-term basis. 
 
 
9. (C) While some Nigerians fear a national convention would 
re-ignite disgruntled groups\' secessionist tendencies, others 
argue such a meeting would diffuse underlying tensions and 
initiate a productive way forward.  The Committee for the 
Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) claims that a national 
convention will \"raise Nigerians\' adrenaline but not lead us 
to kill ourselves.\"  Had a convention been \"called during the 
military years, the Niger Delta would have called for 
secession,\" CDHR posits.  In today\'s civilian climate, 
particularly with the Bakassi issue at present (paragraphs 
11-12), a national conference is unlikely to fan the embers 
of secessionism, they argue. 
 
 
10.  (C) Meanwhile, some groups are calling for the creation 
of their own state within the federation.  One of the groups 
most disappointed by the nation\'s lack-luster performance in 
meeting public needs is the Ogoni people of Rivers State. 
The Ogoni believe they were martyred as a people for Nigerian 
democracy, but many resent receiving so few dividends to 
date.  In meetings held during a recent fact-finding mission 
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 
the National Commissioner for Refugees, and Poloffs, Ogoni 
members asserted that their only hope was to have an Ogoni 
state with its own resources administered according to their 
own decisions (septel). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
MUTUAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN INTRIGUE:  WHAT IF . . . . 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
11. (C) BAKASSI AND THE LIMITS OF ETHNIC AUTONOMY.  CDHR 
thinks the October 10 ruling on Bakassi by the International 
Court of Justice further diminished the South\'s impulse 
towards secessionism by reminding it of its need for northern 
military coverage.  \"Bakassi has reminded the South that we 
live better together,\" remarked Belo Aideloje, Secretary 
General of CDHR. Combining the regions together, \"Nigeria is 
seen as so mighty that no one (e.g. Cameroon) could stand up 
to it.\"  The \"mutual need for security\" has sparked a \"spirit 
of kith and kinship among communities of the South-South, 
South-East, and South-West,\" claims CDHR. Therefore, 
perceived mutual security needs has undercut ethnic 
animosities, they conclude.  \"There is an overestimation of 
the strength of ethnic groups.  Each tribe knows its limits. 
People are careful to not be pushed outside the tensile 
strength of their own group,\" CDHR explains.  Yet, it 
concedes that these ties have not been as well developed 
between the South and the North. 
 
 
12. (C) Another source discounts the mutual security theory, 
claiming Obasanjo\'s true agenda is in fact to replace 
northern hegemony of the armed forces with diversified 
officers at the lower ranks.  Proceeding slowly, carefully 
and quietly, avoiding media attention which would unravel the 
whole endeavor, Obasanjo has progressed to the point that the 
South no longer depends on the North for military support, he 
argues.  Nevertheless, CDHR asserts, the South still believes 
military power is a northern product, a perception which 
reinforces cohesion. 
 
 
13. (C) COTE D\'IVOIRE AND THE WEST.  External observers 
believe the GON\'s lingering memories of foreign roles in 
secessionist disputes affects its present decision-making on 
international affairs. Eusebe Hounsokou, Representative for 
Nigeria of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
thinks GON is with-holding direct military aid to Cote 
d\'Ivoire because of a grudge held since civil war.  Cote 
d\'Ivoire was reputedly an arms conduit to Biafran insurgents. 
 Should a similar conflict erupt here, many Nigerians ask 
what foreign actors, including the United States, would do. 
\"When the critical time comes,\" Williams asserts, \"I hope no 
foreign government will encourage any group to breakaway.  I 
hope they instead will encourage the government in power not 
to ignore the problem or crush (the rebels).\" 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
RIVALRY FOR SCARCE RESOURCES: STEEP CHALLENGES AHEAD 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
14. (C) Many, if not most, analysts fear uneven resource 
distribution and economic hardship are steadily corroding the 
country\'s stability.  Daily street scuffles across the South 
have varied causes, but some relate to the question of 
national unity. George Ehusani, Secretary General of the 
Catholic Secretariat, blames most of the violence on poverty, 
which impedes Nigeria\'s forming \"a melting pot like the 
United States.\"  Given \"impoverished conditions,\" he finds it 
unsurprising that violence erupts with \"people biting each 
other.\"  Competition over resources is often expressed as a 
conflict between \"indigenes\" and \"settlers,\" two concepts 
whose precise definitions can differ wildly from one village 
to the next.  Ehusani sees most of Nigeria\'s current threats 
to cohesion in these terms, including the complexities of 
expanding Shari\'a. 
 
 
15. (C) Ehusani, who traveled to Kigali last fall, is 
publishing his analysis of potential lessons Nigeria can 
learn from the Rwandan genocide.  He fears \"ethnic 
antipathies, combined with long-standing issues of perceived 
or real injustice, mixed with severe economic depression\" 
could spark similar mass violence in Nigeria.  While the 
military regimes \"suppressed genocidal sentiments,\" under 
democracy, the situation now may be \"boiling over.\" 
\"Disorganized violence,\" Ehusani argues, is manifest between 
poor individuals.  \"If violence is organized by a Big Man,\" 
on the other hand, he fears it is used in Nigeria to 
\"manipulate the Small Man versus the Small Man to the gain of 
the elite.\"  He claims religious teachings of peace and 
forgiveness are the main deterrents to all-out class warfare 
and mass violence in Nigeria.

16. (C) Nigerian unity may prove more resilient than expected 
from a cursory glance at the headlines on present violence 
and political posturing.  Following Ehusani\'s theory of 
Nigerian conflict, one might ask what a \"Big Man\" might 
expect to gain from an organized secessionist movement and 
whether current political conditions make this strategy

1.  At approximately 1345, 45-50 military retirees arrived at 
AmConGen Lagos carrying a placard stating that they had not 
received benefits in six months.  The demonstrators were 
asked to move across the street from the Consulate General 
which they did.  Two leaders of the group met with RSO and 
ARSO to request assistance from the international community 
in obtaining their benefits.  The leaders presented a leaflet 
that announced the payment of benefits only to medically 
discharged pensioners who had been authenticated in November 
2002.  The demonstrators were upset because some of their 
number did not qualify for the benefit payment.  RSO accepted 
the leaflet and advised the demonstrators that the ConGen 
would be apprised of their request for assistance.  The 
demonstrators left peacefully.  The demonstration lasted 
approximately seven minutes.  AmConGen security personnel did 
not observe the pensioners stopping at any of the other 
diplomatic compounds on the crescent. 
 
 
2.  This was apparently a spontaneous demonstration by the 
pensioners.  There was no threat to visa applicants or ACS 
visitors.  While noisy, the demonstrators were peaceful and 
once their concerns were heard, they left.

SUBJECT:  FULBRIGHT ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA 
SUCCESSFULLY INAUGURATES BOARD OF TRUSTEES AT THIRD 
          ANNUAL CONFERENCE 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY: The 3rd annual conference of the 
Fulbright Alumni Association of Nigeria (FAAN) was held 
from November 25-28 at Nsukka, home of the first 
indigenous Nigerian university. The three-day program 
with the theme \"Globalization and Development In 
Nigeria\" included addresses by the CPAO and a current 
U.S. senior Fulbright scholar; a message read from DAS- 
Academic Programs Thomas A. Farrell; and the 
inauguration of the newly-formed Board of Trustees, an 
innovative idea to enhance interest and planning 
activities of FAAN.  After a relatively unsuccessful 
2001 conference, FAAN proved to PAS this year that it 
was capable of organizing a productive conference, and 
PAS was proud to have sponsored this year\'s successful 
event. 
 
 
2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITY: The conference began with 
a PAS courtesy call on the Chairman of the conference 
and host Vice-Chancellor, former Fulbright Professor 
Ginigeme Mbanefoh who also delivered the welcome 
address that preceded an inspiring keynote address by 
Professor Elizabeth U. Anyakoha, a renowned UNN 
lecturer on vocational education.  The CPAO read a 
congratulatory message from DAS-Academic Programs 
Thomas A. Farrell and delivered remarks on finding 
one\'s niche in a globalized world. Duly registered as a 
corporate body, a Board of Trustees for FAAN was 
inaugurated as part of the opening ceremonies.  The new 
FAAN Board is composed of many of Nigeria\'s world class 
scholars, including the first and only female Vice 
Chancellor as well as several other VCs. Papers on sub- 
themes related to the central theme of `Globalization 
and Development in Nigeria\' were presented, discussed 
and defended. There was a consensus that liberal 
democratization is an essential ingredient, as well as 
national security, good governance, and observance of 
the rule of law, for globalization and development in 
Nigeria. Finally, a new National Executive Board was 
elected for a two-year term, and it was decided to hold 
the 2003 conference at the Nigerian Institute of Policy 
and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), a prominent public think- 
tank in Jos. 
 
 
The presence of Dr. Jean Borgatti, current U.S. 
Fulbright senior scholar of Art History at the 
University of Benin, gave a fresh and aesthetic insight 
into the topics at hand.  She also suggested creating a 
FAAN website on which all the papers could be placed 
for other Fulbrighters and the general public to read, 
and she offered to help create the web-site for the 
Association. 
 
 
Another new development was the decision to publish a 
journal of all papers presented at the conference. 
Many far-reaching innovations and recommendations were 
brought up in the course of the Annual General Meeting 
(AGM) on the second day of the conference, such as the 
introduction of the Fulbright conference journal to the 
GON through the Federal Ministry of Education. At the 
end of the conference, a communiqu was issued to all 
participants about the highlights of the discussions, 
and this communiqu will be forwarded to Education 
committees in government circles as well as all Vice- 
Chancellors of Nigerian universities.  FAAN hopes to 
eventually become self-funded and be an important voice 
in government decision-making processes in the 
educational sector. 
 
 
 
 
3.   BACKGROUND: FAAN is one of Nigeria\'s newest 
academic associations though the large Nigerian 
Fulbright academic exchange program dates back to the 
early 1970s. Inaugurated in 2000, the Association is 
now fully registered with the Corporate Affairs 
s 
Commission as a corporate body with a Constitution and 
a National Executive Council (NEC).  Although FAAN had 
a rocky start, enthusiasm of the National Executive is 
high, and this year\'s conference has been a positive 
force for reinvigorating the organization. 
In his presidential address, Professor G. M. Babatunde, 
outgoing FAAN President and new FAAN Board member, 
praised the timeliness of the conference theme and 
encouraged members to consider how to make FAAN 
relevant to the Nigerian university system and an 
audible voice in government policy-making. 
 
 
4. Result/Impact: Excellent.  The selection of the 
theme \"Globalization and Development in Nigeria\" was 
timely, relevant, and thought-provoking. It will form 
the basis for much of FAAN\'s future planning and 
activities. 
 
 
5. Date: November 25-28, 2002  FY 2003, First Quarter 
 
 
6. MPP Umbrella Theme: Strengthening Economic Growth 
 
 
7. Audience Reached: Despite being held during Ramadan, 
70 Fulbright alumni and participants from as far as 
Bayero University in Kano State attended.  Others, 
university students, Trustees of the Board and other 
guest participants who are interested in the Fulbright 
program, were greatly influenced by the extensive 
deliberations by academics and researchers, Vice- 
Chancellors, Deputy Vice-Chancellors, Deans and 
lecturers alike who were at the conference.  The 
Fulbright scholars will incorporate the knowledge 
gained from these papers in their lectures to varying 
student populations in their respective institutions. 
 
 
The FAAN National Executive has also commenced plans to 
publish a journal of all papers presented at the 3rd 
annual conference for future reference purposes at 
universities throughout the country.  In addition, the 
conference attracted a total of twenty new subscribers 
to the Embassy\'s Crossroads newsletter.  A full report 
of the FAAN conference will be published in the next 
edition of the Crossroads, providing information on 
FAAN to the 6,000 subscribers. Finally, the planned 
FAAN web-site will facilitate communication and unity 
among Fulbright alumni across the nation. 
 
 
8. Non-USG Funding: FAAN had a total sum of over Naira 
400,000.00 (approximately USD 3,000.00) in its bank 
account, which was used to commence planning activities 
for this year\'s conference.  The money represented 
annual dues paid by alumni over the past two years as 
well as minor cash donations. 
 
 
9. Quality of U.S. Support: Excellent.  FAAN is 
especially grateful to ECA/A/E/AF for securing the 
DAS\'s special message, which clearly touched the 
participants. PAS would also appreciate receiving 
information on alternate sources of funding to augment 
PAS funds.

losses due to the decision of the ICJ awarding the 
Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon.  Despite speculation of 
vast crude reserves offshore, several existing oil 
wells in the waters impacted by the decision appear to 
be non-producing and there is little expectation of 
significant production from the disputed region in the 
near future.  Further, there is virtually no other 
economic activity associated with the peninsula beyond 
fishing and farming. Meanwhile, there are social and 
political reasons for the ongoing attention paid to the 
ruling in the Nigerian press.  A recently formed joint 
commission may resolve Nigeria\'s post-judgment 
reservations by establishing a timetable for the phased 
withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the peninsula.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (SBU) In mid-November, Econoffs met with 
representatives of ExxonMobil to discuss the economic 
impact of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) 
ruling which essentially granted Cameroon possession of 
the Bakassi Peninsula. The company\'s representatives 
referred to maps drawn for ExxonMobil after the ICJ 
decision indicating new lines of demarcation associated 
with the ruling.  The ruling delineates territorial 
waters offshore for each country.  From the maps Exxon- 
Mobil showed us, it appears that Nigeria retains most 
of the offshore territory that it originally claimed, 
as only a relatively small, well-defined area of water 
near Bakassi was claimed by both parties.  Because the 
islands of Equatorial Guinea rest in the Gulf near both 
Nigeria and Cameroon, there is not enough distance 
between these countries\' shorelines to create 
international waters.  Because of the remoteness of the 
region and the direction of the offshore boundary drawn 
by the ICJ, the ruling should have no effect on 
shipping lanes or any port access for either country. 
Likewise, existing agreements between Nigeria and 
Equatorial Guinea, and between Nigeria and Sao Tome and 
Principe should not be affected by the ruling, although 
recently renewed attention is being paid to each for 
strategic and development reasons. 
 
 
3. (SBU) Cameroon began exploring and developing oil 
fields in the Bight of Bonny in the 1980s.  It was 
thought the waters held the promise of fantastic 
returns on investment, but this has not been borne out. 
The court claims over Bakassi began in 1994, with 
Nigeria and Cameroon each claiming an arc of water 
extending out from the peninsula in its respective 
favor.  According to the maps published by the court 
and others produced for ExxonMobil, the ICJ ruling 
chose neither\'s claimed offshore boundary, but rather 
drew a new boundary line.  Ten oil wells exist in the 
main zone that fell between the Nigerian and 
Cameroonian claimed lines, all developed by Cameroon 
and, as a result of the ICJ ruling, now resting within 
Cameroonian territory.  It appears that none are 
producing, and four or five may be dry.  An additional 
ten wells exist in other waters claimed by Cameroon and 
one Cameroonian well now falls within Nigerian 
territory, but it too appears to be non-producing.  The 
company representatives do not believe there are 
significant onshore oil deposits at Bakassi. This 
belief was also expressed by ExxonMobil\'s VP for Africa 
in a separate conversation with the Ambassador. 
 
 
4. (SBU) One field that now straddles both countries\' 
boundaries is producing oil at a varying rate up to 
40,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a well on the 
Nigerian side of the new boundary. The ExxonMobil 
representatives speculate that development rights to 
this field will be negotiated between the countries, 
akin to the Nigeria - Sao Tome and Principe Joint 
Development Zone (N-STP JDZ) farther west in the Gulf 
of Guinea, or the border agreement between Nigeria and 
Equatorial Guinea. 
 
 
5.  (U) During a November visit to Calabar, Econoff was 
informed that very little non-oil economic activity 
exists in and around the Bakassi Peninsula.  The people 
of Bakassi live in small villages and subsist mostly by 
fishing from small wooden boats resembling long canoes 
rowed into the Bight of Bonny.  There is no organized 
fishing industry in the region. 
 
 
6.  (U) While in south-east Nigeria, Econoff attended a 
conference in Akwa Ibom state in which the Bakassi 
ruling was addressed in a question and answer session 
following a presentation on environmental issues.  Some 
anger over the loss of Bakassi was voiced by the 
audience of approximately 1500, and it was asserted 
that roughly 75 percent of the Nigerians now living in 
Bakassi are of Akwa Ibom origin. Population estimates 
range from 30,000 to 300,000, with anything over 
100,000 improbable. Beyond expressing a sense of 
solidarity with their kin, conference participants 
conjectured that if many Bakassi residents chose to 
return to Akwa Ibom state, the repatriation would be 
very taxing on the state\'s infrastructure and its 
communities\' social structures, which will necessitate 
a repatriation plan and funding from the federal 
government. 
 
 
7.  (SBU) Although definitely a minority, some economic 
editorialists and private sector consultants have 
opined that the ICJ ruling provides an overall economic 
benefit to Nigeria.  They note that while Cameroon was 
awarded the land territory of Bakassi and disputed 
areas around Lake Chad, it did not win the offshore 
boundary lines it sought.  Some analysts further 
speculate that the territory maintained by Nigeria as a 
result of the ICJ ruling holds more than 10 billion 
barrels of crude oil, especially at its boundary with 
Equatorial Guinea.  Because there is now a ruling by an 
international body delineating an offshore boundary, 
and that boundary is not detrimental to Nigeria\'s long- 
term economic interests, the political risk in the 
region is substantially reduced.  With reduced 
political risk, private firms may develop the region 
with confidence that the concessions they negotiate 
with one country or the other will be secure. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) Several international oil company executives 
told Econoff that they nonetheless remain reluctant to 
explore or develop the region until all public 
controversy has abated and a mutually satisfactory 
understanding between the countries is achieved. 
ExxonMobil officials deduce that if Nigeria ever 
believed that the oil reserves off Bakassi were 
commercially exploitable, it would have drilled in the 
region from 1994 to the present as Cameroon did. Given 
that most of the wells already drilled in the disputed 
region are dry or non-producing, and the GON has told 
the oil companies they should not expect increases in 
development funds in the 2003 budget, there seems to be 
little incentive to begin or expand serious development 
in the waters off Bakassi in the near future. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) COMMENT: Some media reports speculated that 
Obasanjo had miscalculated regarding the outcome of the 
case.  However, Mission interaction with GON decision- 
makers in advance of the ruling and after it was 
announced indicates that the GON was aware the ICJ 
likely would award Bakassi to Cameroon.  Given the 
years-long drumbeat of \"Bakassi is Nigerian,\" the GON 
could not take steps to prepare its people in the weeks 
immediately before the ruling was announced.   Rather, 
the GON had to await the ruling, gauge the level of 
public unhappiness, and respond accordingly. 
 
 
10.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED:  Although \"oil-rich\" is 
the modifier placed in front of virtually every mention 
of the word \"Bakassi\" in the Nigerian media, pundits do 
not focus on resources or access to the Cross River\'s 
deepwater channel.  Rather, journalists emphasize on 
the sufferings of individuals at the hands of 
Cameroonian gendarmes and the essential principle of 
national integrity and indivisibility.  Bakassi must be 
Nigerian, the theme goes, because its inhabitants 
always were, are and ever will be Nigerian, and it is 
the duty of a government to protect the interests of 
its citizens.  In short, no matter how much discussion 
there may be about natural resources, Nigeria\'s 
interest in retaining control of Bakassi is founded not 
on economic interests or even concerns about its naval 
vessels being able to reach the Port of Calabar but 
rather on a mixture of national pride and concern for 
the fate of the peninsula\'s inhabitants. 
 
 
11.  (SBU) With the approach of the April presidential 
election, opposition candidates may try to use the ICJ 
ruling to embarrass the Obasanjo administration.  A 
Nigerian-Cameroonian commission, facilitated by the UN 
Secretary General, has been formed to attempt to 
 
SIPDIS 
resolve Nigerian concerns over the ICJ ruling.  The 
commission held its first meeting in Yaounde in early 
December, but an agreement on any substantive point 
likely awaits the post-election period, as the 
President cannot to make any concession before voters 
go to the pools; thereafter, he can move but may still 
proceed very deliberately, in order to put this issue 
to rest without provoking new outcry.

SUBJECT: AGOA AND NIGERIA: CAN ITS TEXTILE FIRMS STILL 
BENEFIT? 
 
REF: ABUJA 1810 
 
 
1.  Summary.  Textile provisions of the Africa Growth and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA) encourage millions of dollars in 
foreign investment, create thousands of new jobs and boost 
exports across Africa, except in Nigeria.  Sub-Saharan 
Africa\'s second largest economy has not taken advantage of 
AGOA\'s duty-free textile opportunities. A key impediment is 
the inadequate safeguards against transshipment by ineligible 
countries.   Legislation to establish an appropriate export 
visa regime remains stalled in the National Assembly.  Even 
if the bill were passed, Nigeria\'s textile industry would 
still face problems of low productivity and poor 
infrastructure--especially poor transportation links and high 
energy costs. Nigeria could still benefit from AGOA if firms 
were to increase their competitiveness quickly, possibly 
through free trade zones that might encourage local 
industries to pool resources and attract desperately needed 
foreign expertise and capital.  Unless Nigeria moves quickly, 
 it may fall farther  behind as ot 
her African nations race to develop their textile industries 
in anticipation of the January 1, 2004, requirement that 
AGOA-eligible garments be assembled from textiles made in the 
United State or other AGOA countries.  End Summary. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Assembly\'s Inaction 
------------------------ 
 
 
2. Nigeria is ineligible for AGOA\'s duty-free textile 
provisions at present because it lacks safeguards against 
transshipment.  A bill providing for the requisite safeguards 
is stalled before the National Assembly.  House Finance 
Committee Chair Mohammed Sanusi Daggash told Emboff early in 
2002 that legislation would be enacted in June 2002 (reftel); 
however, eligibility for the textile provisions has not been 
a priority, partly because members misunderstand AGOA\'s 
potential benefits.  While industry organizations have often 
expressed their frustration publicly about the legislature\'s 
inaction, none has engaged in effective lobbying to inform 
and persuade legislators about the missed opportunities. 
 
 
3. Comment. Since 1999, the National Assembly has passed few 
non-budget bills.  The National Assembly has a very limited 
capacity to formulate economic policy owing to lack of 
understanding of basic economic principles and little will to 
legislate serious economic reform. For many members, 
consolidating their gains as parliamentarians and preparing 
for elections have taken precedence over reviving Nigeria\'s 
stagnant non-oil sector.  Now that the legislators\' attention 
is firmly focused on the 2003 elections, it is unlikely a 
bill will be passed until next summer at the earliest.  End 
Comment. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
Problems and Potential 
--------------------------- 
 
 
4. Even if legislation were passed today,  Nigerian firms 
would need help to penetrate the American market. Once a 
significant source of employment and foreign exchange, the 
textile industry is in poor condition.  It suffers from 
decaying manufacturing plants and declining capacity, which 
have driven costs up and competitiveness down.  Nigeria\'s 
manufacturers must overcome these problems and a 
dysfunctional infrastructure to produce low-cost, 
high-quality goods.  The frequency of Nigeria\'s power outages 
is the most costly infrastructure problem, forcing firms to 
rely on expensive generators.  This constitutes an enormous 
disadvantage for textile manufacturers who have significantly 
greater demand for electricity than do garment assemblers. 
The apparel sector is nevertheless practically non-existent, 
and the textile industry operates at only thirty- percent 
capacity.  Cheaper imports from China and India have flooded 
the country and driven many Nigerian firms out of business. 
 
 
5. Although the industry is in dire straits, hope is not 
beyond reason.  According to a report published by American 
textile experts (reftel), Nigeria could become a major 
textile and garment exporter under AGOA.  Cotton is grown 
locally and the country has an abundance of cheap labor. 
While apparel manufacturing is merely a cottage industry 
today, new factories could draw on the existing labor pool. 
If textile firms were to become more competitive, they could 
provide inputs not only to domestic firms but also to other 
African countries, especially after 2004 when the AGOA 
provisions allowing less developed countries to use inputs 
from elsewhere expire.  Nigeria\'s challenge is to transform 
this potential into a vibrant export industry. 
 
 
------------------------ 
Government Efforts 
------------------------ 
 
 
6. While Nigeria\'s public and private sectors constantly 
bemoan the industry\'s decline, both have done relatively 
little to address the structural deficiencies that make 
Nigerian firms non-competitive.  Beyond the marginal 
improvement in power generation since 1999, the only tangible 
action the government has taken has been to erect barriers to 
trade.  In 2002, in response to pleas by textile unions and 
manufacturers, the government imposed a temporary import ban 
on printed fabric (since replaced by quality and price 
controls).  Beyond protectionism, government efforts have 
produced many reports but few results. 
 
 
7.  In late 2002, President Obasanjo established a committee 
to revive the textile industry.  The committee\'s mandate 
called for a \"blue-print\" to restore the position the 
industry held during the mid-1980s.  The committee comprised 
representatives from federal ministries, state governments, 
professional associations, unions, a few private 
manufacturers, and the United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization (UNIDO).  In its final report released in 
October 2002 the committee recommended ways of boosting 
exports to Europe and the United States, all with a view to 
meeting Obasanjo\'s goal of exporting one billion USD worth of 
textiles a year by 2006.  Its recommendations called for a 
tightening up of import restrictions and penalties to curb 
illegal imports, as well as measures to increase cotton 
production and improve the infrastructure. 
 
 
8. Nigeria\'s Ministry of Commerce, in cooperation with the 
United States-Nigerian Development Institution (to which 
USAID has provided funding), has initiated the Nigerian 
Apparel and Footwear Project, which aims to bring the 
operations of selected Nigerian manufacturers to 
international standards.  The initiative is an element of the 
GON\'s overall effort to increase non-oil exports to 500 
million USD by the end of 2003. The Ministry of Industry is 
working with UNIDO on a \"blue-print\" to restructure and 
rehabilitate the textile and garment industry, with a 
specific focus on AGOA to stimulate production.  UNIDO 
expects to complete the project by the end of 2003, at which 
time it hopes to provide the GON follow-up assistance to 
implement specific recommendations. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
Private Sector Efforts 
-------------------------- 
 
 
9. In terms of resuscitating the ailing textile industry, the 
private sector has done no 
better a job than the government.  Private sector awareness 
is high, as evidenced by the frequent mention of AGOA at 
business seminars and in the media, but few firms understand 
the nuts and bolts of exporting under its provisions.  To 
enlighten them, the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce 
will soon publish a \"how to\" manual outlining all the 
necessary steps for accessing the US market.  However, while 
a few large firms (mainly subsidiaries of international 
conglomerates) have expressed serious 
interest in AGOA, many smaller firms are pessimistic about 
Nigeria\'s chances of becoming competitive and thus have shown 
little initiative to grasp the opportunities available. 
 
 
10. An assertion by J.P. Olarewaju, Executive Director of the 
Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA), is a good 
example of the latter attitude.  Olarewaju told Econoff in 
December that although AGOA seems like a great deal, most of 
NTMA\'s members believe that they cannot manufacture high 
quality textiles or assemble garments to compete with other 
AGOA suppliers. Olarewaju said the major impediment to 
restructuring the industry is lack of capital since firms 
desperately need to upgrade and replace old machinery. 
 
 
11. Econoff asked Olarewaju if Nigerian firms had approached 
Lebanese, Chinese or Indians investors already active in 
Africa for capital and expertise. Olarewaju replied 
derisively that these Asian businessmen are \"merely traders\" 
only interested in dumping textile products and hurting local 
firms.  The NTMA recommends that Nigeria\'s government provide 
capital or lease machinery to private firms through the Bank 
of Industry.  Olarewaju hopes that Nigerian firms will pool 
their resources and form cooperatives, and believes the 
government should spearhead such an initiative.  He also 
hopes the government will perform market research so firms 
might have a better idea of the American market.  (NOTE: 
USTR, PAS and ECON invited U.S. purchasing reps to tour 
Nigeria in 2000 and 2001.  FCS, ECON and others have sent 
Nigerian delegations to the States as well.  Purchasers 
(usually for deparment stores and chains that control 90 
percent of the garment trade) can tell suppliers how to make 
desired products.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Comment: Are AGOA Benefits out of Reach? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
12. The problems of Nigeria\'s existing textile and garment 
industry are evident.  The high cost of business associated 
with Nigeria\'s poor infrastructure,  outdated technology, and 
stiff competition from cheap imports has propelled the 
industry into steep decline.  While industry analysts agree 
on the problems, few offer feasible solutions or demonstrate 
leadership to implement them. At the moment, only a handful 
of manufacturers assemble apparel.  Existing textile firms, 
which produce low quality African design prints, need to 
switch operations or upgrade existing machinery to produce 
inputs for world markets. Nigerian firms need to find ways to 
ship goods out in a timely manner.  They must also achieve a 
reasonable cost structure, which should not be extremely 
difficult.  To become globally competitive, Nigeria needs 
leadership to coordinate the industry\'s public and private 
sector activities in order to move forward. 
 
 
13. The government has not demonstrated that it can devise 
and implement a plan that might make Nigeria more competitive 
for AGOA textiles. In general, Government action tends to 
hurt, not help, the manufacturing sector.  Politicians spend 
more time squabbling over their own or their constituencies\' 
access to easy oil money, than over ways to improve the 
infrastructure and create a good investment climate.  State 
and local authorities impose heavy tax burdens on textile 
firms, as they are easier targets than the multitude of 
importers who sell goods from the privacy of their homes. 
While tariffs (the second largest source of revenue behind 
oil taxes and royalties is the preferred policy tool) offer 
little effective protection, tariffs encourage smuggling 
across Nigeria\'s porous borders, often through the complicity 
of corrupt customs officials. 
 
 
14.  Nigeria\'s government still has an indispensable role to 
play establishing the groundwork to sustain a successful 
domestic textile and apparel manufacturing industry.  It 
needs to improve utilities, roads and ports.  The government 
must change its policy direction and invest in economic 
reform.  Having said this, private sector initiative is the 
key factor determining whether or not Nigeria will benefit 
from AGOA\'s textile provisions.  As Nigeria falls farther and 
farther behind its African competitors, appropriate 
corrective government action becomes increasingly important. 
But groups like the NTMA must not wait for the government to 
do all the work. 
 
 
15. Several Nigerian firms have links to international 
conglomerates and a few Nigerian entrepreneurs could compete 
in the American market under the right conditions.  The most 
important would be a reduction in the cost of doing business, 
especially high production costs associated with the 
procurement of power generating, water provisioning, and 
telecommunications equipment to neutralize outages when 
public services fail.  In the short term, companies can share 
utility costs by clustering in industrial parks or free trade 
zone (FTZ) like the existing site in Calabar and the planned 
site in Lagos.  An FTZ offers added benefit in that zone 
administrators have authority to issue regulations 
independent of the federal government.  By joining forces, 
firms could lobby FTZ authorities to quickly implement 
polices to help firms produce and ship products at a cost low 
enough to be competitive.   Streamlined shipping and customs 
procedures could reduce the opportunities for corruption. 
 
 
16. Many domestic firms claim that the highest cost is not 
associated with inadequate infrastructure but access to 
capital.  However, according to the International Finance 
Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, equity 
and debt financing is available in Nigeria.  To be sure, the 
equity market is thin and debt financing is costly. But an 
equally important problem is that few entrepreneurs have 
sound business plans.  By seeking help abroad, domestic firms 
could find not only much needed expertise for textile and 
apparel production but also additional sources of capital. 
 
 
 
 
17. Nigeria\'s longstanding dependence on oil has drawn 
resources and energy away from the non-oil sector, rendering 
much of the manufacturing sector idle.  The elite who have 
enjoyed easy access to oil revenue have had little incentive 
to plow resources into the non-oil sector.  Nigeria has yet 
to orient itself to the global economy.  Few firms or 
politicians understand the opportunities that exist or have 
demonstrated initiative to attract foreign direct investment. 
 Nigeria might still benefit from AGOA, however, if the 
private sector quickly finds ways to improve its 
competitiveness by clustering and establishing ties with 
foreign investors.  But if Nigeria\'s firms continue to sit 
back and wait for government action, AGOA\'s textile benefits 
will increasingly fall beyond their reach.  End Comment.

SUBJECT:  Nigeria: Biweekly Energy Report No. 1 
 
 
(This is the first in a series of biweekly reports on the 
energy sector in Nigeria.  Information for these reports 
will be culled from open sources as well as contacts by the 
Mission with key players, official and commercial, in 
Nigeria\'s oil and gas-producing community.) 
 
 
1. Summary.  In late December, the Government of Nigeria 
(GON) released 24 billion Naira to its international oil 
joint venture partners in payment of arrears outstanding 
since the last era of military rule (l994-99).  The deferral 
of payments had slowed investment by Nigeria\'s joint 
partners in the oil and gas sector in recent years.  Seeking 
to increase local content, the GON is pressing for 
indigenous companies to account for at least 40 percent of 
human and material inputs in new projects, and is 
encouraging Nigerians to raise local content in the sector 
by funding areas where they have expertise. Gas flaring is 
down and use of natural gas is up. President Obasanjo 
announced a 2004 target for ending gas flaring, but some 
companies may be exempt from this deadline, at least 
temporarily.  A fire at the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Company (NNPC) headquarters completely gutted the building 
the day before Christmas.  Theories for the cause run from 
arson to cover up wrongdoing to another tragic accident. 
Septel will provide details. End summary. 
 
 
---------- 
Cash Calls 
---------- 
 
 
2.  The longstanding delay that foreign oil companies had 
encountered in obtaining cash call payments for the period 
1994-99 has been partially resolved, according to press 
reports.  In late December, the NNPC reportedly made 
payments totaling 24 billion naira (about 185.0 million USD) 
to operators of joint ventures.  Cash call payments defray 
the government\'s share of operating costs under joint 
venture arrangements in which the GON holds a 57 percent 
share.  The arrears date back to military rule during the 
Abacha years. 
 
 
3.  While the arrears in nairas have been liquidated for 
1994-1999, an industry source told us January 6 that the 
NNPC has not liquidated the foreign exchange component of 
the arrears outstanding for that period.  There is 
disagreement over the amount owed.  The foreign companies 
put the amount at 500 million USD while the government 
claims 300 million USD is owed.  The deferral of the dollar 
payments has meant slower development of new fields.  The 
naira component allows companies to make local purchases and 
pay local staff salaries.  The U.S. currency permits 
companies to obtain needed services and supplies offshore. 
 
 
4.  Our source added that the cash call payment to his 
company last month meant that the payments that it received 
in 2002 were the largest in fifteen years.  Our source said 
the NNPC is current in its naira and dollar cash call 
payments to the company going back to the year 2002.  Some 
dollar arrears for the period before 2000 remain 
outstanding. 
 
 
5.  The delay in cash call payments had seriously restricted 
foreign oil companies\' ability to expand production and had 
added extra costs to their operations.  The companies had 
partly compensated by reducing the number of rigs operating, 
retiring staff prematurely or cutting back on the work 
force, merging departments, and dropping some employee 
perks. In the future, the issue of cash call arrears should 
be eliminated, as the GON shifts to Production Sharing 
Contracts (PSC\'s) as the means to develop hugely capital- 
intensive deep off-shore fields. 
 
 
--------------------- 
Indigenous Investment 
--------------------- 
 
 
6.  The GON is encouraging Nigerian entrepreneurs to 
participate actively in the oil and gas industry.  Toward 
this end, the GON wants to see the local content of current 
and future projects raised to at least 40 percent.  Part of 
the problem facing start-up firms has been lack of capital. 
One of the ways of getting a foothold in the industry has 
been through purchase of existing fields with proven 
reserves.  This usually has meant acquiring marginal fields 
or acquiring part or all of the GON\'s equity in a joint 
venture. Marginal fields are fields that foreign companies 
have abandoned because they appeared no longer to be 
commercially viable.  The GON requires that marginal fields 
be set aside for indigenous companies with expertise in 
specific technical areas. 
 
 
7.  Another avenue of entry into the market for Nigerian 
entrepreneurs is through the provision of services to the 
oil and gas industry. However, most Nigerian firms do not 
have the financial ability to compete with the international 
firms that provide services to the industry.  Few Nigerian 
firms can do this now because sophisticated technical skills 
and advance equipment are required.  Most Nigerian 
entrepreneurs lease equipment at present.  Nigerians are 
nonetheless hoping to find a niche through which to supply 
selected services to the industry. 
 
 
8.  Because Nigeria\'s primary source of revenue and means to 
\"good\" employment is the oil and gas industry, businessmen 
are learning about opportunities for partnerships, and 
entrepreneurs are emerging.  Since Nigeria\'s focus in the 
coming years will be on offshore production of oil and gas, 
some Nigerian entrepreneurs may specialize in deep-sea 
diving services.  Other Nigerian firms are considering 
arrangements for provision of leased drilling rigs to 
production companies.  Some have opted to supply pipes for 
oil and gas lines.  Other Nigerian firms want to produce 
drilling mud and associated chemical products.  The 
challenge for these firms will be producing chemicals that 
conform to American Petroleum Institute standards. 
 
 
------------------ 
Natural Gas Sector 
------------------ 
 
 
9.   President Obasanjo recently announced plans to end gas 
flaring by 2004 while he was attending the January 7 
commissioning of an industrial gas project in Ogun State. 
The President conditioned his statement, saying \"some of the 
oil companies might be exempted from the 2004 deadline.\" 
Technical Assistant to the NNPC Group Managing Director, 
Austen Oniwon tells us that most flaring will not end by 
2004. Oniwon predicted the next significant reduction of 
flaring will occur when the LNG Trains 4 and 5 become 
operational in 2005 or 2006. (Note: About 50 percent 
associated gas is now flared compared to more than 70 
percent in the mid-1990s.) 
 
 
--------- 
NNPC Fire 
--------- 
 
 
10.  The Lagos office of the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) was completely gutted by fire on December 
24.  The building, located on Ikoyi Island in Lagos, housed 
the offices of the Nigerian Petroleum Investment Management 
Services (NAPIMS), which is responsible for GON investments 
in the oil industry, and the Pipelines and Products 
Marketing Company (PPMC), whose mandate is marketing 
petroleum products. The leader of the Youth Democratic 
Movement (a previously unknown group) claimed responsibility 
for what is commonly believed to have been arson.  Some of 
our industry sources have speculated that NNPC employees 
seeking to cover up details of long-term fraud within NNPC 
set the building on fire. 
 
 
11. While the implications of the fire are being sorted out, 
it should be noted that joint ventures (JV) account for 
approximately 90 percent of Nigeria\'s oil production. 
NAPIMS supervises the JV operations so the destruction of 
NAPIM\'s records may have an adverse impact on oil production 
capacity, especially for new fields for which NAPIMS is 
presently processing contracts.   The fire purportedly began 
on the eighth floor of the building, which housed NAPIMS, 
and later re-ignited on the second floor, where PPMC was 
located.   Although the files of the GON\'s oil investments 
and joint venture activities are reportedly backed up at 
NNPC\'s headquarters in the capital and at the international 
oil company offices, it remains to be seen how many of the 
NNPC records can be validly and reliably reconstituted.

12. The payment of cash calls to companies was long overdue. 
While the Obasanjo Administration has made efforts to pay 
legitimate debts incurred during military rule, the 
international oil companies still suffered when their cash 
call payments were held up.  The NNPC\'s foreign partners 
have had to delay development of projects, shut down rigs, 
downsize and retrench in other ways to cut expenditures. 
Added to this has been the uncertainty of when payment in 
dollars will be made for the years prior to 1999 and in what 
amount. That said, the Obasanjo Administration has done a 
much better job in cleaning up cash call arrears than any 
contemporary Nigerian government. 
 
 
13. Given that many indigenous companies will work marginal 
oil fields, we plan to address the political and economic 
importance of progress on these fields in septels.  The GON, 
in its effort to encourage local content, may have to move 
cautiously since most indigenous companies lack funds and 
expertise. 
 
 
14. We have reason to believe that the investigation of the 
NNPC fire is not being conducted in a serious manner and 
will never determine the cause of the blaze (see septel). 
We also do not know yet what the eventual cost of the NNPC 
inferno will be.  In recent years, major suspicious fires 
consumed the Lagos offices of the Ministry of Defense and 
NITEL (Nigerian Telecommunications).  With or without facts, 
the general assumption is that arson to cover up misdeeds 
was the cause and the investigation will flicker and 
eventually die out.

1. (C) Summary.    Orji Kalu, dubbed the \"Action Governor\" 
by President Obasanjo for his aggressive style and ability to 
get programs and projects going in Abia state, recently won a 
year-long administrative and political tussle with his 
disgruntled Deputy Governor and half the State legislators. 
Kalu,  a young, rising star of the Peoples Democratic Party 
(PDP) was recently tapped to be the party\'s gubernatorial 
candidate again, and with a pledge of support from the 
President, he seems set to win another four-year term.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
Background: Political Family Feud 
 
 
2. (C) The political wrangling in Abia State that started in 
2001 arose from an attempt by two rival groups within the 
Abia Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to hijack the party 
machinery.  One of the two groups is led by the 
current Governor, Orji Kalu.  The other group, sometimes 
referred to as the \"Abuja Group,\" consists of Abia State 
politicians who also hold important federal appointments, 
such as Transport Minister Ojo Madueke, PDP National 
Secretary, Vincent Ogbulafor, and Niger Delta Development 
 
SIPDIS 
Commission (NDDC) Chairman, Onyema Ugochukwu.   This group 
made moves to try to weaken the popularity and influence of 
Governor Kalu, an Igbo of the Bende clan.   Deputy Governor 
H. Enyi Abaribe, an Igbo of the Ukwa Ngwa clan, deserted the 
Kalu camp and teamed up with the Abuja Group, apparently 
hoping for support from them should he challenge his old boss 
for the governorship. 
 
 
3. (C)  Using Port Harcourt in Rivers State as the hub for 
the visit to Abia State, ConOffs traveled by car to Umuahia, 
Abia\'s capital, for a courtesy and orientation visit with 
officials there.  T. A. Orji, the Chief of Staff of the 
Governor, met with us because the Governor and various senior 
State and PDP officials had been called to Abuja by the 
party\'s National Executive Committee for a \"reconciliation\" 
meeting.  Orji spent the first half hour of the meeting being 
the archetypal \"spin doctor\" and public relations frontman 
for Kalu.  He proudly enumerated the Governor\'s achievements 
during the past three and a half years and said that his 
(Orji\'s) book on the achievements, \"Unbroken Covenants,\" was 
due in bookstores by Christmas. 
 
 
Birth of the Dream 
 
 
4.  (C) Orji said that as a young and very successful 
businessman in 1994, Kalu had had \"a dream\" about the future 
of Abia State while sitting in a \"go slow\" (traffic gridlock) 
one day.  Since his election, according to Orji, Kalu had 
focused on his dream of eradicating poverty in Abia State by 
promoting the re-development of agriculture with a \"back to 
the soil\" program featuring cultivation of rubber plants, 
education and modern skills training through a \"work to 
learn\" program for high school drop-outs, and small business 
programs for women.  \"This administration is insuring that 
our people get at least three meals per day,\" he boasted.  He 
quickly added that the Kalu administration is very \"gender 
sensitive\":  there are three senior, female appointees in the 
State government--the Minister for Rural Development, the 
Minister for Women and Youth Affairs, and the State Solicitor 
General.  The State government has also initiated and funded 
special loan programs for women, as well as increased funding 
for girls\' education.  Orji said Kalu has definitely lived up 
to the title, \"the Action Governor,\" bestowed on him early in 
his tenure by President Olusegun Obasanjo owing to his 
youthful, energetic, and aggressive pursuit of programs for 
Abia State. 
 
 
Friends No More 
 
 
5. (C) Orji\'s face set in grim lines when the talk turned to 
the rift between Governor Kalu and his Deputy, H. Enyi 
Abaribe.  Orji related a rambling story about how Kalu and 
Abaribe had met by accident at a business meeting.  Kalu was 
so impressed by Abaribe that he immediately asked the 
politically uninitiated Abaribe to join his administration 
and subsequently appointed him Deputy Governor.  Orji 
dismissed with an impatient wave of his hand any possibility 
that Abaribe would challenge Kalu for the top spot in Abia, 
and declared that Kalu will run \"unopposed.\"  He continued 
saying that Abaribe is just a \"sweet talker\" whose record was 
sullied by allegations of graft, loan fraud and theft of 
government funds.  He dubbed Abaribe and his supporters \"the 
Taliban\" and predicted they would be as soundly defeated as 
were the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
 
 
6. (C) In a separate conversation, Sir I. K. Daniel, Special 
Assistant (Political) to Governor Kalu, told us on our  visit 
to Abia in November that a party primary held the previous 
week had failed to unseat the Deputy Governor and had further 
aggravated the crisis.  The split within the PDP in Abia 
extended to the State House of Assembly as well as the PDP 
Executive Committee.  \"The people feel cheated after this 
primary,\" he said, \"and we are expecting protest petitions to 
be filed after primary results are announced from Abuja.   A 
reconciliatory attempt by the National Assembly on the day of 
ConOff\'s visit, and a previous move by the PDP National 
Executive, only temporarily succeeded in reconciling the 
warring factions. 
 
 
The \"Taliban\" 
7. (C) Abaribe and his supporters, all unpaid for the 
preceding eighteen months, were hunkered down holding siege 
at the State Assembly building at the time of ConOff\'s 
visit.  (Kalu\'s supporters have moved into offices across 
from the Governor\'s office at Government House.)  ConOffs 
waited at the gate to the Assembly grounds while armed guards 
and State Security Service men conferred with the Deputy 
Governor; and finally, with the additional efforts of ConGen 
Political Specialist, persuaded him to tell us his side of 
the story.  ConOffs 
managed to meet with the Deputy Governor just minutes  before 
he left for Abuja for the \"reconciliation\" meeting.  Abaribe 
was even more grim-faced and squint-eyed than Orji when 
discussing his rival, Governor Kalu. 
 
 
8. (C) Abaribe even had a list of complaints about the 
administration including mismanagement of funds and failure 
to provide basic services.  He said it was the \"Action 
Governor\'s\" fault that State finances were in such a 
disastrous condition.  The Governor had been overly ambitious 
and had started too many projects never to finish any of 
them.  He criticized Kalu\'s plans to increase tax revenues, 
saying \"We must enhance other sources of revenue and 
distribute the fruits of our democracy before we can increase 
the tax burden.\"  The Governor has not done anything positive 
on this issue, according to Abaribe.  The State suffers from 
an unemployment rate of 60 percent.  \"These people can\'t pay 
taxes if they don\'t have income,\" he pointed out.  \"Even the 
20 percent in this State who do pay are underpaying.\"  He 
went on to add that Abians are \"disgusted with bad leaders 
and government corruption\" and will not pay taxes to a 
government that is accountable to no one. 
 
 
9. (C) On his decision whether or not to oppose Kalu for the 
2003 governorship, Orji told us during our visit that a 1991 
document signed by the founding fathers of Abia State 
declared that there would be a \"sharing of State government 
and political offices among the factions\" of Abia State to 
ensure that \"everybody is carried 
along and everybody feels that they are part of the 
government.\"  Abaribe, himself from the Ukwa-Ngwa ethnic 
group that has long complained about its marginalization in 
contravention of the 1991 agreement, recently left the PDP to 
join the All Nigerian Peoples\' Party (ANPP).  At the recent 
ANPP convention in the capital city of Abuja, Abaribe was 
tapped to be the party\'s candidate for Governor of Abia. 
 
 
10. (C) Comment.  In late November,  47 Igbo traditional 
rulers met to try to dispel tension and conflict in Abia and 
other areas of the Southeast.  They urged citizens of Abia to 
back Governor Kalu for the good of the Igbo people.  Abaribe, 
however, being of another clan, felt no special 
responsibility to Kalu and decided to change parties and 
challenge his boss and former friend.  High-level backers he 
may have cultivated in the PDP are gone, first because 
Abaribe changed parties and, second, because these backers 
must support whomever the President and leader of their party 
supports.  That would be incumbent Governor Kalu.  ConGen 
FSNs from Abia, say that while many in the State admire 
Abaribe as an honorable and principled young man, almost no 
one gives him any chance at beating Kalu.  As Obasanjo 
indicated support for any incumbent governor who wants to try 
for a second term, and Kalu still apparently enjoys 
significant voter support in the region, it is likely that he 
will be re-elected.  Although none of the officials we spoke 
to specifically mentioned the possibility that the lingering 
ill-will among Kalu, Abaribe and some State legislators would 
engender election-related violence, Abaribe still travels 
with an armed escort, and he and Kalu are still not at all 
\"reconciled.\"

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EIND, EINV, ETRD, PGOV, NI 
SUBJECT: ELECTIONS 2003: THE PROSPECTIVE ECONOMY AND THE 
PRICE OF POLITICS 
 
 
1. Summary. On November 19 some forty corporate executives 
representing a broad cross-section of the non-oil sector met 
at the Lagos Business School to discuss the potential 
economic impact of the 2003 general elections.  During the 
session led by Professor Pat Utomi, many executives expressed 
concern about the uncertainty associated with the upcoming 
general elections and their likely impact on the investment 
climate. Most of the executives fear that fiscal indiscipline 
will worsen as the spring elections approach, which will fuel 
inflation, raise interest rates, and depreciate the naira; 
most participants disclosed that their firms are consequently 
postponing major investments until after the elections. 
Alternative economic thinking, predicated on the desirability 
of priming the pump, nevertheless posits a more positive 
outcome of an expansion in government spending in the run up 
to the spring elections.  End summary. 
 
 
2. During the program at the business school, the consensus 
was aired that the biggest impediment to private sector 
investment in Nigeria is political uncertainty.  Utomi 
contends, for example, that the government\'s process for 
implementing economic policy has been poorly coordinated and 
characterized by mixed signals, with long-term objectives 
often being sacrificed for short-term political gains.  Many 
business executives echoed this opinion and faulted the 
government for its frequent and sudden changes in both policy 
and its implementation, making long-term investment decisions 
difficult.  An example is President Obasanjo\'s recent 
declaration that oil producers should end gas flaring by the 
end of 2004 instead of by 2008 as envisaged earlier. 
According to Utomi, the business executives he has talked to 
all expect greater uncertainty as the elections approach and 
are, therefore postponing major investments. 
 
 
3. Many executives also fear that the government may go on a 
\"spending spree\" during the next five months to secure 
political support.  Here, we use the word government 
inclusively to cover all branches and all tiers of 
government.  In general, the National Assembly has been far 
more inclined to be profligate than the Presidency.  The 
latter\'s attempt throughout much of 2002 to check the 
legislature\'s propensity for spending resulted in a stalemate 
between these two branches of government.  But even without 
executive-legislative agreement on a budget, federal funds 
can still be expended in an undisciplined fashion.  The 
President can disburse up to fifty percent of the expected 
annual recurrent budget revenues of any fiscal year without 
National Assembly approval.  Excessive non-discretionary and 
discretionary spending by the federal government accounts for 
continuing deficit spending.  Reflecting this fact, Central 
Bank data on extensions of credit to the economy, in 
particular to government, show that the level in 2002 was far 
above the target figures established late 2001.  Nigeria\'s 
federal structure compounds the problem. The fiscal 
authorities of the state and local governments have been 
irresponsible in the past three years.  Having recklessly 
expended borrowed funds, the state and local governments have 
spent their allotments from the proceeds of the Federation 
Account in an equally cavalier fashion.  That account is 
funded largely by oil export proceeds and is apportioned 
according to a 54.68; 24.72; 20.60 ratio.  The federal fiscal 
authorities can do little to influence such spending by the 
states and local governments, even when it destabilizes the 
economy. Consequently and unsurprisingly, many of the 
executives at Lagos Business School forum said they expect 
excessive spending will continue even well after the general 
elections, as the victorious politicians will want to reward 
faithful supporters. 
 
 
4. According to Utomi, the problem with such a likely 
expansionary fiscal policy is that it will fail to take 
account of the absorptive capacity of the economy.  Since the 
infrastructure cannot absorb a massive infusion of capital 
effectively, few if any of the funds that will be disbursed 
will translate into meaningful economic activity.  The funds 
that will be disbursed to procure votes, he said, will 
typically be channeled into the hands of a select few people 
who will spend most of the windfall on imported goods or 
exchange it for hard currency to be banked or spent abroad. 
Should the foreign exchange market be flooded with naira, 
Nigeria\'s reserves will dwindle since the Central Bank will 
be under pressure to control the naira\'s depreciation. Utomi 
asserted that even with regard to legitimate government 
contracts, eighty kobos of every naira (100 kobos to a naira) 
flow into the foreign exchange market in search of hard 
currency for capital expenditures.  Regardless of where the 
funds will go, whether for legtimate expenditures or 
procurement of votes, all the executives at the forum expect 
that government-induced excess liquidity will generate 
economic instability in the form higher prices for domestic 
or foreign goods and services. 
 
 
5.  Comment.  Alternative economic thinking may justify the 
government measures mentioned above.  Although conventional 
wisdom argues against a sharp and sustained expansion of 
credit to the government, it is conceivable that, since 
government spending is an engine of growth, we might see a 
pick up in economic activity before April based on higher 
government spending in the run up to the elections.  While 
some private sector firms may not want to invest in a period 
of uncertainty, the government is a large client of other 
firms.  Thus many firms may be caught in a bind; while 
political uncertainty may make them bearish, the chance of 
landing government contracts may overcome their skittishness 
in instances. Thus, if the GON can \"turn on\" spending during 
the first half of the year and then turn it off during the 
second half, the stimulus of the first six months might not 
greatly compound actual economic disequilibria.  While such 
an outcome might be unlikely, GON strategists may be trying 
to do this.  Even if it is improbable that they might 
succeed--because the \"on/off\" switch cannot be made to work 
instantaneously--there is nonetheless an off chance that they 
might achieve success if spending were to fund productive 
activity and enlarge Nigeria\'s absorptive capacity for 
investable funds.  Of course, should such a strategy fail, 
the result would be even more destabilizing to private sector 
firms and individuals than if the GON had opted for an 
orthodox strategy.  End comment. 
 
 
6.  Utomi asserted that years of military rule in Nigeria 
left a legacy of fractured institutions to the civilian 
government that is a cause of today\'s fiscal indiscipline. 
In the absence of a well-ordered, functional federal 
executive-legislative decision making apparatus that ensures 
stability and predictability, policy is easily reversed (and 
re-reversed) to suit political whims. In this regard, Utomi 
singled out the National Assembly for its lack of 
appreciation for sound economic policy.  To make his point, 
Utomi said he had asked a well-known Senator recently whether 
\"the Assembly was concerned about the health of the economy 
before next year\'s elections.\"  The Senator replied: \"Let me 
assure you, no one in the Assembly understands the economy 
and no one cares.\"  Utomi went on that it is not surprising 
then that the Assembly tends to be \"flexible\" with 
legislation and that it often changes course when politically 
expedient. 
 
 
7. Comment.  Utomi is influential in certain circles, but his 
is only one voice.  Politicking will fuel the economy in the 
first quarter, perhaps well into the second, even if oil 
prices begin to drop.  While private sector firms may be 
restraining investment in front of elections, doing so is a 
rational decision given the uncertainty that elections imply. 
 Once elections are over and the country\'s direction is 
clearer, these firms likely will begin to invest again. 
However, Nigeria\'s economic fundamentals are not strong and 
could weaken by mid-year as expenditures rise at all levels 
of government in front of general elections, possibly causing 
higher inflation and interest rates, as well as instability 
in the foreign exchange market.  This would be bad news for 
most Nigerians whose real per capita income will probably 
have declined in 2002. 
 
 
8. Although the various tiers of government have been 
incapable or unwilling to implement sound fiscal policy, the 
private sector too has failed to promote its interests 
effectively.  Businesses have compiled long litanies of 
complaints against the government, but they have done little 
to ensure that specific solutions are implemented.  Lacking 
entrepreneurial spirit, many private sector firms hold out 
for government subsidies or other incentives (understandable 
given the policy environment) rather than show initiative, 
which results in serious inertia. Many businesspeople are 
engaged in rent-seeking activity, benefit from their access 
to politicians and consequent ability to influence the policy 
environment and, ultimately, are not particularly interested 
in holding political leaders accountable for their actions.

MINISTER PRINCE MOMOH 
 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1.  (U)  Summary. Prince Tony Momoh, former Minister of 
Information and Culture, successful public relations 
consultant and influential political columnist for the 
\"Vanguard\" newspaper says that the Shari\'a law case of Amina 
Lawal will be decided in Lawal\'s favor.  He believes there 
was an inevitable political aspect to the rioting between 
Christians and Muslims around the Miss World Contest. He was 
tapped to be Director of Publicity for, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, who 
until he was defeated at the party convention on January 3, 
was the most credible challenger to President Obasanjo within 
the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP).  Momoh is cautiously 
bullish on the Nigerian economy and political scene and 
believes structural changes will solve most problems.  End 
summary. 
 
 
Culture and Islam 
 
 
2. (C) In an hour-long, wide-ranging meeting with PolOffs, 
Prince Anthony Sulaiman Macnonoh Momoh, lawyer, journalist, 
businessman and former Minister of Information and Culture 
(1986-90) gave his views on a number of subjects.  He was 
eager to share his views on the Lawal case (Note: Amina 
Lawal, a Nigerian Muslim woman, was convicted of adultery and 
condemned to death by stoning by a Islamic court in Nigeria 
this year.  Her case is on appeal.  End note.)   Momoh, a 
Muslim, stated that Muslims in the North were \"embarrassed\" 
by the world and media reaction to the Lawal case.  He said 
that there had \"always\" been stonings for adultery in Muslim 
communities in Nigeria.  \"It is the local way of dealing with 
crime and maintaining discipline,\" he said.  \"In Edo State, 
in the Muslim community where I was raised, there were 
stonings for adultery and women were driven out of the 
community or severely ostracized for lesser infractions,\" he 
continued. 
 
 
3. (C) Momoh explained that there are actually three judicial 
systems in Nigeria: one modeled on British common law, one 
based on Islamic law and one following \"customary\" or African 
indigenous law.  All these courts are officially and 
constitutionally recognized in Nigeria and all are subject, 
again under the Nigerian Constitution, to review by the 
Supreme Court.  \"Customary\" law courts are the Southern 
equivalent to Shari\'a (Islamic) courts in the North, and one 
is no worse nor any better than the other.  Momoh pointed out 
that, even today, Igbo women in many Southern States have few 
rights under customary law and are themselves considered 
property of male family members under this law.   \"Everyone 
knows that the Lawal case will be decided by the Supreme 
Court and death by stoning is clearly unconstitutional in 
Nigeria. This case is a media and public relations phenomena 
and Muslims in the North are embarrassed by the attention 
focused on a long-time, accepted practice.\"  He concluded 
saying that media focus on a particular issue can shape 
history.  \"If CNN had been around in the 1960s, Biafra would 
be a reality today.\" 
 
 
Politics and Islam 
 
 
4. (C)  Momoh also had strong views on the political 
implications of the recent religious rioting and killings 
that had led to the cancellation of the staging of the Miss 
World Contest in Nigeria.  The riots left 200 people dead and 
hundreds more injured when Muslims reacted to a newspaper 
editorial that reportedly insulted the Prophet Mohamed.  He 
said \"Northern Muslims were looking for a reason to start 
violent protests against the current administration and, if 
it hadn\'t been the Miss World Contest, it would have been 
something else.\"  According to Momoh, the Obasanjo 
administration and the ruling People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) 
that came into power in 1999 needed alliance with a second 
party to cement their power.  As the Alliance for Democracy 
(AD) had a firm hold on the Southwest, the PDP turned to the 
All Nigerian People\'s Party (ANPP) that is strongest in the 
Northwest.  The PDP offered to support the ANPP in pushing 
Shari\'a law as a replacement for the British-derived criminal 
code in several Northern States.  Momoh says that, \"The North 
made Babangida and Obasanjo, and they (the Northerners) were 
promised much by both men.  Now that Obasanjo has clearly 
failed to live up to many of the promises made to the North, 
they are out to obstruct his every move and crush his every 
plan.\"  He continued that the rioting was politically 
motivated and \"the rioters were obviously not even people who 
could or would read newspapers.\"  The PDP is now scrambling 
to try to win back Northern Muslims by introducing Shari\'a 
legislation, but, says Momoh, \"Shari\'a has become a political 
weapon that will swallow up the current leadership.\" 
 
 
Elections 
5.  (C) Turning to the subject of the 2003 legislative, 
gubernatorial and presidential elections, Momoh was 
absolutely certain that there will be much election-related 
violence as elections approach.  \"Nigerians are ruthless and 
relentless businessmen.  Politics in Nigeria is a business 
and so violence is a part of both business and politics 
here,\" he said.  Nigerians need to understand politics as 
government serving the people and not a business where each 
man is out to get as much for himself as fast as he can from 
the public coffers.   He said the decision by the courts to 
force the Independent National Elections Commission (INEC) to 
legalize additional political parties was clear from the 
beginning.  First, because the Constitution does not allow 
citizens to run as independents, and, second, because it 
empowers INEC only to document registration of parties and 
not to make rules for the structure of parties.  Momoh said 
that the current over thirty political parties will winnow 
down to two or three through alliance and coalition, and will 
eventually become a liberal left and conservative right as in 
the US.  He concluded, saying that the party conventions to 
chose candidates to be held in January, will merely be 
\"rubber stamps of the already rigged primaries.  Whoever is 
named at the conventions will be the winners.\"  (Comment. 
Charges of fixing, tampering and rigging were leveled at 
party primaries in several states and some primaries were 
annulled by the national parties. End comment.) 
 
 
A President from an ethnic minority 
 
 
6. (C)  (Comment.  Momoh was the Director of Publicity for 
both political efforts of former vice president (1979-83), 
Dr. Alex Ifeanyichukwu Ekwueme.  Ekwueme\'s latest attempt to 
challenge Obasanjo for the Presidency met defeat at the 
January 3-5 PDP convention when Obasanjo was chosen as the 
party\'s candidate. Momoh met with us in December on the day 
Ekwueme announced his candidacy.  End comment.)   Momoh was 
adamant that the South-south must produce the next President 
of Nigeria.  \"This is not negotiable,\" he stated, echoing 
many prominent politicians and hopefuls from the Southeast 
and South-south.  He explained that the Nigerian Constitution 
clearly states that no one region of the country can 
monopolize the Presidency.  The Presidency must rotate after 
a President from a particular region has served two four-year 
terms. As it turned out, the Presidency will probably remain 
in the south, but the southwest to be exact, with the 
nomination of Obasanjo. 
 
 
Corruption and economic progress 
 
 
7.  (C)  Corruption in government and politics is not just a 
Nigerian problem, it is a human problem.  \"Citizens are not 
taught to serve today,\" Momoh said.  \"They just take and 
never give anything back to society.\"  He pointed out that a 
government employee with the title of \"Counselor\" makes 
500,000 Nigerian naira per month (equivalent to approximately 
4,000 USD.)  The attraction to the average citizen is clear 
in a country where the annual per capita income is only 300 
USD.  \"We have become too materialistic,\" he continued, \"and 
no one believes that heaven is the reward.  Everyone wants 
everything here and now.  If you are not a millionaire, you 
are a failure.\"  Momoh believes that government and, 
consequently politics, must be \"decongested.\"  He, as have 
others, wants  less federal government and more power and 
authority devolved to the local level.  He says that the 
Nigerian people are not used to a federal, centralized type 
government and need to be educated and mobilized at the grass 
roots by local leaders.  He contends that corruption will die 
if local authorities are allowed to handle their own affairs 
and funds.  \"The only failing areas in Nigeria are those that 
are government controlled.  Nigerians are energetic, 
business-oriented and know how to handle their own affairs.\" 
 
 
8. (C) Comment.  Momoh is still a voice to be reckoned with 
as he writes a regular column of political and cultural 
commentary for the influential \"Vanguard\" newspaper as well 
as runs his own successful public relations firm.  He is also 
a lawyer and enthusiastic supporter of building democracy and 
a civil society in Nigeria.  He jokingly said that since he 
is one of his father\'s 265 children (from multiple wives), he 
was thinking of forming his own Momoh family political party 
to deal with issues he considers important for the future of 
Nigeria.  Despite his occasional bleak tone, Momoh is 
optimistic about Nigeria\'s future and sees Nigeria eventually 
succeeding.  He told us Nigeria is following much the same 
path to democracy that the US did. He said, \"Nigeria is the 
other part of America, only on this side of the Atlantic.\"

SUBJECT: NIGERIAN STOCK EXCHANGE SEEKS USAID PARTNERSHIP 
 
 
REF:  02 Lagos 01933 
 
 
1.    (U) SUMMARY:  The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE)  seeks 
USAID  assistance to expand its services.  The NSE plans  to 
attract more Nigerians and foreign investors to the equities 
market  through  greater accessibility  and  new  investment 
vehicles in derivative markets.  The NSE raised the issue of 
working  in partnership with USAID and in particular  sought 
assistance in the areas of hardware and software acquisition 
and  provision of technical assistance and training.   USAID 
is  in the process of developing a new five-year strategy to 
begin  in  January 2004, and will seek to identify  ways  of 
working  in partnership with NSE in the context of  the  new 
strategy.  USAID and NSE will develop terms of reference  to 
conduct  an  assessment in early 2003 to  identify  specific 
areas  of partnership.  In addition, USTDA is considering  a 
2003 technical assistance grant to the NSE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.    (U)  On  October 21, 2002, Econoff attended a  meeting 
between  USAID  Mission Director Dawn  Liberi  and  Nicholas 
Okoye  of  the Nigerian Stock Exchange.  Okoye is  Technical 
Adviser to the Director General and CEO of the NSE,  and  is 
Head  of  the newly created Strategy and Derivatives Markets 
department.   Okoye  presented a  proposal  for  partnership 
opportunities  between  the  NSE  and  USAID,  as  the   NSE 
continues  to  improve its IT infrastructure  and  plans  to 
expand investor services. 
 
 
3.    (U)  Okoye reported that the NSE has achieved  several 
important  international benchmarks  for  equities  markets, 
including   clearing  transactions  in   three   days   (T+3 
clearance)  and  the  development of  a  transparent  review 
system  whereby reports of companies traded on the  exchange 
are  available  via  the NSE Website.   In  addition,  Okoye 
reiterated the NSE\'s ranking by Standard and Poors  and  the 
International  Financial  Corporation  (IFC)  as  third  for 
return  on  investment among exchanges worldwide  and  first 
among  emerging  markets. (REFTEL).  The NSE  now  plans  to 
attract  more investors by creating new investment  vehicles 
targeted  toward  individuals in Nigeria, institutions  both 
domestic  and  foreign,  and  Nigerians  living  or  working 
abroad.   Okoye  and  the  NSE  Director  General  met  with 
representatives  of the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE)  and 
the American Stock Exchange (ASE) in May to discuss ways  in 
which the NSE can leverage the expertise and global reach of 
the  US  exchanges through technical assistance and training 
programs.   The  NSE  also  hopes  the  US  exchanges   will 
introduce  the  NSE to key international fund  managers  who 
focus on emerging markets. 
 
 
FOR NIGERIANS AT HOME:  INVESTMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS 
 
 
4.    (U)  Okoye  noted  that less  than  three  percent  of 
Nigerians are invested in the NSE in any capacity,  compared 
to  75 percent of Americans and 63 percent of European Union 
citizens  who invest in equity markets directly  or  through 
mutual   funds  and  retirement  plans.   To  attract   more 
individual  investors in Nigeria and leverage the  economies 
of  scales of the current nationwide banking system, the NSE 
plans to partner with banks to develop a new savings entity, 
the  individual  investment account.  Since  Nigerian  banks 
tend  to  have  branches  in  even  small  towns  throughout 
Nigeria, the NSE sees a partnership with banks to be a  more 
efficient way to reach individual investors than encouraging 
stockbrokers to expand their capacity and reach.  Individual 
investment  accounts  would allow bank depositors  to  place 
savings  into  an account that would purchase shares  of  an 
equities   portfolio,   allowing   greater   returns    than 
traditional savings accounts.  According to Okoye, the  1999 
Universal  Banking Act permits licensed banks to participate 
in every aspect of the financial industry, allowing for this 
sort of partnership between banks and the exchange. 
 
 
5.    (U)  To further encourage individual investors to  use 
the  stock  exchange  and  to enhance  the  reliability  and 
credibility of transactions, the NSE is developing an  email 
system  to  notify investors of transactions made  on  their 
behalf.   According  to Okoye, in the  US  an  automatically 
generated confirmation letter notifies each investor when  a 
broker  places a trade on his or her behalf.   The  Nigerian 
postal  system  is  considered too  unreliable  for  such  a 
system,   and  thus,  trades  are  currently  made   without 
confirmation, known as \"selling without a mandate.\"  The NSE 
is considering the creation of a free email account for each 
investor  in  the  exchange through which  confirmations  of 
trades  may be posted.  Okoye notes that while few Nigerians 
have  access to computers and the Internet at home or  work, 
many  individuals  maintain free accounts that  they  access 
from  cyber  cafes,  which are quite common  throughout  the 
country. 
 
 
FOR INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND NIGERIANS LIVING ABROAD: NEW 
INVESTMENT VEHICLES IN THE DERIVATIVES MARKETS 
 
 
6.    (U)  Okoye  estimates that Nigerians  living  overseas 
return over three billion dollars annually to Nigeria, often 
in  the  form  of  real  estate purchases  and  investments. 
However,  Okoye states that these individuals are frequently 
victims   of   unscrupulous   transactions   or   unreliable 
construction  cost  estimates.  The NSE  believes  Nigerians 
abroad,  as  well as institutional investors in-country  and 
abroad,   are   looking   for   credible   and   transparent 
opportunities to invest in Nigeria.  As head  of  the  NSE\'s 
new   derivatives  markets  department,  Okoye   highlighted 
several  investment  products currently  under  development. 
(REFTEL). 
 
 
7.    (U)  Okoye states his team is developing  an  Exchange 
Traded  Fund (ETF).  Like the NASDAQ \"QQQ,\" or the  American 
Stock Exchange \"SPDR,\" the ETF will consist of a \"basket\" of 
the  top 30 or so companies listed on the NSE which will  be 
traded  as  a  single  security.   The  Johannesburg   Stock 
Exchange   (JSE)  currently  has  a  fund  of  this   nature 
available.   The  NSE  is also preparing  option  contracts, 
which are not currently traded on the NSE.  Further, the NSE 
is   exploring  whether  foreign  investors  will  be   more 
comfortable  investing in NSE listed companies  through  the 
NYSE and ASE in the form of depository receipts.  To attract 
the  Nigerian expat investor, the NSE is developing  a  real 
estate investment trust and note product, which will involve 
the  issuance  of notes against real estate developments  or 
securities  against ongoing rents.  Similarly,  the  NSE  is 
developing oil and gas trust notes.  The NSE points out that 
indigenous energy companies are now positioned to take  over 
\"marginal\" or low-volume oil fields from major international 
producers.   Most  of  these  are  capped-wells,   requiring 
capital  investment in flow stations and piping,  which  can 
cost  15  to 30 million dollars, according to Okoye.   Local 
banks  generally do not provide sufficient lending for  such 
projects, so the NSE believes it can offer investment trusts 
of   sufficient  credibility  and  reliability  to   attract 
investors  and generate the funding needed to  launch  these 
ventures. 
 
 
AREAS FOR POSSIBLE USAID PARTNERSHIP 
 
 
8.    (U)  NSE requested USAID assistance with the provision 
of  new  hardware and software needed to develop and  manage 
each  of  the  investment vehicles,  as  well  as  technical 
assistance  and  training in both  IT  systems  and  trading 
aspects of these products.  Such IT systems development  and 
new services training will be necessary both for the NSE and 
a  set  of Nigerian financial institutions that will  become 
custodial  banks to facilitate the derivatives transactions. 
Okoye  states  that  the  NSE would primarily  use  US  made 
products  and consultants for these ventures, including  the 
NYSE and ASE.  He notes that the NSE Board of Directors  has 
approved  the concept of the exchange acting as  a  regional 
clearinghouse  for securities transactions  involving  other 
African  countries.  Thomas Briggs of the US  Department  of 
Treasury  suggested such a concept during a recent  tour  of 
Nigeria.  Okoye states that the NSE is currently negotiating 
with  a  company  in  Boston  to establish  and  maintain  a 
database to record and call-up transactions for the last  12 
years,   a   necessity  if  NSE  is  to  become  a  regional 
clearinghouse. 
 
 
9.    (U)  USAID Mission Director indicated that  USAID  was 
developing  a  new five-year strategy and that collaboration 
with  NSE  could be explored within the context of  the  new 
strategy.  USAID would consult further with NSE and  conduct 
an assessment to identify potential areas of partnership and 
collaboration.  She estimated that such an assessment  could 
take  place in early 2003.  Additionally, the US  Trade  and 
Development  Agency  is considering a  technical  assistance 
grant  to the NSE to upgrade its computer system and develop 
a secondary trading floor in case of catastrophic failure.

TAGS: ECON, EFIN, ETRD, BEXP, PGOV, NI 
SUBJECT:  The Economy in 2003:  Triumph of Politics 
 
 
1.  Summary. The economic outlook for the New Year is 
cloudy. Academic experts and business leaders fear that 
Nigeria will experience little if any real per capita 
growth in 2003. They bemoan Nigeria\'s OPEC oil 
production quota of 1.9 million barrels per day, which 
limits the country\'s potential oil exports. These 
experts fear even more what they say are irresponsible 
fiscal policies despite President Obasanjo\'s relative 
frugality. Central Bank data show that such policies 
are putting Nigeria on shaky economic ground as it 
heads toward 2003. Nigerian economists we have talked 
to do not expect a policy change during the next 
quarter, which will be the last before critical federal 
and state elections in April 2003. End summary. 
 
 
Real Economy 
 
 
2.  The economic clouds of 2002 have obscured the view 
of likely economic activity in the New Year. In early 
November 2002, IMF experts estimated that Nigeria\'s 
gross domestic product would decline 0.9 percent in 
real terms in 2002 owing to falling oil revenues. This 
figure, if confirmed, will be in stark contrast to the 
3.8 percent growth achieved in 2001.  The Central Bank 
has challenged the IMF figure and forecasts 3.2 percent 
growth for 2002.  Its basis for optimism is that non- 
oil sector output may have risen 5.3 percent in 2002, 
buoyed by a 4.1 percent increase in agricultural 
production owing to favorable rainfall. (The 
discrepancy points to the weak database and less than 
robust analysis.)  The GON also points to the dynamism 
of the telecommunications sector, which was energized 
by deregulation and the introduction of GSM telephone 
systems. Both the IMF and the GON recognize that the 
manufacturing sector remained weak in 2002, as capacity 
utilization did not exceed 41 percent during the year. 
Partly because of this fact, there is increasing 
consensus among Nigerians on the need to accelerate 
privatization, and market determination of the exchange 
and interest rates.  The Dutch Action System (DAS), 
which was introduced in mid 2002 to deal with the 
pressure on the exchange rate, has facilitated improved 
management of the exchange rate. 
 
 
3.  Whether one uses the IMF or Central Bank figures, 
the data still point to a setting in which purchasing 
power remains weak. Not only is the annual per capita 
income of the Nigerian population estimated to be below 
300 USD, its rate of growth approximates only 2.8 
percent a year. Consequently, the optimistic 3.2 
percent growth results in only a 0.4 percent rise in 
per capita income under the better of the two scenarios 
mentioned above. At such a low rate of increase, 
Nigerians are condemned virtually to perpetual poverty. 
It is a far cry from the 7.2 percent real per capita 
income growth that Nigerians would need to experience 
continually over the next ten years to double their 
income within a decade. 
 
 
4.  To achieve 7-10 percent real growth in any given 
year calls for an environment conducive to business. 
Last year\'s has not been so, according to Doyin Salami, 
a macroeconomics professor at the Lagos Business 
School. In mid-November, he shared data with us and 
business executives that showed that private sector 
turnover had just kept pace with inflation during the 
first half of 2002. A Lagos Business School survey of 
fast moving consumer goods then disclosed that the 
fastest moving items (like powdered milk) were 
necessities being packaged in ever smaller containers 
to be within reach of consumers\' falling purchasing 
power. Expenditure switching was associated with this 
decline in sales volume, Salami asserted. Companies 
marketing consumer goods had to lower their margins in 
2002 to attract buyers since many poor people chose to 
buy goods like GSM telephones rather than essential 
items, notwithstanding their low level of income. 
Consequently, unadjusted profits for the non-financial 
sector fell by 6.4 percent during the period, he said. 
The ratio of losers to winners during this time was 
three to one, he added. A report appearing in the 
December 30 issue of Business Day carried the headline, 
\"Economic Lull Impacts on Companies\' Profits.\" 
 
 
5. Except for cases in which the purchase of cellular 
phones facilitates earning a living, other instances of 
inessential purchases may rightly be considered 
conspicuous spending.  Such spending affects aggregate 
growth only at the margin. The reason is simple: there 
are simply too few Nigerians with substantial 
purchasing power. Salami and his better-known colleague 
at the business school, Pat Utomi, presented data 
bearing out this point. Regarding distribution of 
wealth, Salami said the richest four-percent of the 
population in Nigeria possesses 48 percent of the 
country\'s wealth. The next cohort accounts for 46 
percent of the population and holds 44 percent of the 
wealth. The bottom 50 percent of the population 
accounts for 8 percent of the wealth. This highly 
skewed distribution of wealth is sub-optimal with 
respect to economic growth. Since the richest cohort\'s 
propensity and ability to import is much larger than 
that of the other two- thirds of the population, much 
of the income of the top four percent of the population 
helps to sustain foreign economies, not Nigeria. But 
this group is numerically so small that it absorbs 
little of Nigeria\'s manufactured products.  This group 
also generally disdains Nigerian goods and will buy 
imported items whenever it can, further compounding the 
problem. Its savings or surplus income, which accounts 
for a large proportion of total private savings, is 
consequently often channeled abroad. Such capital 
flight further holds back Nigeria\'s economic growth. 
 
 
6.  There is another dysfunctional form of conspicuous 
spending in Nigeria: that for political position.  In 
many other countries, people with money invest in 
industry or services as these sectors of economic 
activity generate wealth.  In Nigeria, however, many 
people with money invest directly in the political 
sector or indirectly by backing politically ambitious 
individuals.  It is common knowledge that in Nigeria 
politics can be the short road to massive wealth. How 
else can one account for the substantial cost of recent 
electoral activity in Nigeria?  Funding of it, whether 
originally through a draw down of foreign exchange 
reserves, has been distributed primarily in naira to 
advance the political prospects of various people. An 
Emboff\'s informed estimate of the cost of the Peoples 
Democratic Party convention in Abuja last week is that 
it approximated 60 million USD. 
 
 
7. Continuing in this vein, Utomi added that statistics 
show that funding for the federal, state, and local 
governments has quadrupled since 1998, yet little of it 
is used productively. (Central Bank data confirm that 
the revenues that accrued to the state and local 
governments increased by a factor of four in nominal 
terms during 1997-2001. Federal government revenues 
nearly doubled during the same period.  The greater 
distribution of revenue to state and local governments 
during the Fourth Republic (relative to the 
distribution in 1997-1998 during military rule) is 
partly the result of a requirement imposed on the 
federal government by the 1999 constitution.)  To make 
his point, Salami referred to a value-for-money audit 
that the IMF and the World Bank conducted in Nigeria 
and said its value-for-money index was put at fourteen 
percent at the Conference on Development that was held 
in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002. Consequently, 
little of the government revenue allocated to economic 
and social services has the intended effect. (Comment. 
We were told that a value-for-money coefficient of 14 
signifies that only 14 out of every 100 naira collected 
by the federal government is spent effectively.  End 
comment.)  According to Utomi, no more than a tenth of 
the 100,000 young men and women who graduate from 
Nigeria\'s post-secondary institutions every year obtain 
adequate urban employment within one year of 
graduation, for example. Few of these adults find 
meaningful alternative employment in the rural sector 
since the wages are too low to attract them. Rural 
wages remain low partly because forty percent of total 
agricultural production is lost owing to inadequate 
infrastructure. 
 
 
Fiscal Policy 
 
 
8. Nigeria\'s less-than-reassuring fiscal policies are 
the cause of the overcast 2003 outlook.  The central 
government\'s overall budget deficit target for 2002 was 
set at -446 billion naira (about 3.7 billion USD). 
Reviewing the performance of the federal government 
during the first part of the year, Salami showed that 
the overall fiscal balance stood at minus Nl19.5 
billion (about 1.0 billion USD), which equaled 4.3 
percent of GDP (assuming 3.2 percent real growth in 
2002). This figure for the deficit appeared in the 
Central Bank\'s report for the first half of 2002. 
Should it turn out that the target figure for 2002 was 
realized, fiscal policy will have been as expansionary 
in 2002 as any policy of the last four years. Although 
oil revenues were 36 percent lower during the first 
half of 2002 than during the first half of 2001 because 
Nigeria\'s OPEC quota limited its export volume, federal 
government revenues still exceeded the budget estimate 
by 29.7 percent in the first six months of 2002. 
However, recurrent expenditures alone rose 14 percent 
during the period relative to those of the first half 
of 2001. The total of recurrent expenditures and the 
federal government\'s capital expenditures and net 
lending \"resulted in a large monetary financing of a 
huge deficit\" during the first half of 2002, according 
to the Central Bank. More recent Central Bank data 
indicate that recurrent expenditures accounted for 77.7 
percent of the central government budget and exceeded 
the target by 10.6 percent during the first ten months 
of 2002. Personnel costs associated with a bloated 
civil service accounted for 70 percent of these 
recurrent expenditures. 
 
 
9. The Central Bank\'s announcement of late December 
that the federal government had recorded a deficit of 
47.5 billion naira (about 400 million USD) during the 
first ten months of 2002 was unexpected, given that the 
budget deficit for the first semester 2002 totaled 
119.5 billion naira. The reason for the remarkable 
turnaround was the inclusion in the government\'s 
retained revenue of the proceeds of the sale of 
external reserves and of borrowing from the banking 
system. As noted in the Bank\'s report for October, \"in 
the ten-month period, the Federal Government 
substantially drew down on its deposits with the 
Central Bank of Nigeria, resulting in further injection 
of liquidity in the banking system.\" Although Obasanjo 
slashed capital expenditures during the first nine 
months of 2002, we expect that the data for the last 
quarter will show that the federal government\'s net 
lending, capital expenditures, and transfers to state 
and local governments will have picked up in 2002. We 
further expect that this trend will continue during the 
first six months of 2003 because of expenditures 
associated with contracts typically awarded at the end 
of a presidential administration and other handouts of 
patronage. 
 
 
Monetary Policy 
 
 
10.  Nigerian analysts know that the Central Bank has 
the unenviable task of ensuring that monetary policy 
accommodates fiscal policy. Although the rate of growth 
of the monetary aggregates had slowed during the first 
six months of this year relative to the figures for the 
first half of 2001, by the end of October broad money 
(M2) had risen by 32 percent against a target of 15.3 
percent for 2002. The increases were driven by 
excessive bank credit to the domestic economy; 
primarily government credit, which rose 602.1 percent 
during the first six months of this year relative to 
the corresponding period a year ago. The Central Bank 
itself subscribed to 45 percent of the treasury bills 
issued during the period. Reflecting the government\'s 
inability or unwillingness to make further cuts in the 
budget in the light of a continuing budget deficit, 
government borrowing picked up during the subsequent 
four months (July-October) of 2002. Central Bank data 
for October show that government credit rose a whopping 
836 percent during the first ten months of 2002. 
 
 
11.  The crowding out of the private sector has thus 
been an important feature of the money and capital 
markets in 2002. Bank credit to the private sector rose 
by only 8.7 percent in the first ten months of the 
year, a far cry from the annual target of 34.9 percent. 
Equally important was the fact that non-bank public 
subscription to treasury bills rose by a factor of ten 
in the first half of 2002 relative to the corresponding 
period the year before. (The Central Bank\'s and 
commercial banks\' subscriptions to treasury bills rose 
by a factor of seven during the same period.) While it 
may have appeared that the Central Bank\'s reduction of 
the Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) by 400 basis points 
in late October, to 18.5 percent, would stimulate 
private sector lending, the reduction also lowered the 
cost of government borrowing and so may have encouraged 
such further borrowing. For these reasons, the cut in 
the MRR late in the year is particularly worrisome; 
such action is counter-intuitive since the budget 
deficits have caused the liquidity overhang. 
 
 
12.  Bowing to political pressure, the Central Bank of 
Nigeria (CBN) nonetheless further reduced the 
rediscount rate to 16.5 percent in late December and 
called on banks to lower the prime lending rate to MRR 
+ 400 basis point. Unpublished preliminary data of the 
Central Bank that we saw on December 30 indicate that 
this reduction in the MRR has lowered inter-bank 
lending rates. Rates have come down partly because the 
first tranche of the December 2002 statutory federal 
government allocation to the state and local 
governments trickled into bank vaults in late December. 
Professor Salami and other economists we have talked to 
caution that the lower rates are unlikely to hold since 
inflation and default risk drives interest rates. Since 
neither of these two drivers will lose momentum during 
the next six months, lending rates will remain high as 
institutional investors flock to treasury bills in a 
flight to quality.  Moreover, deposit banks are likely 
to find ways to increase their lending rates, Salami 
said. He anticipates the development of an underground 
market in which loans will be extended at MMR plus 400 
basis points plus a premium to take account of erosion 
of asset values induced by an expected rise in 
inflation early next year. An Emboff already knows of 
an instance in which a contact of his who wants to 
import equipment to process cashews asserted that he 
was recently quoted a rate of interest of 35 percent, 
plus a 2 percent charge for documentation, and a 5 
percent transfer charge.  The interest rate plus the 
charges total 42 percent, a far cry from the 20.5 prime 
interest rate that the Central Bank is recommending. 
 
 
Foreign Account 
 
 
13.  Central Bank data show that Nigeria\'s trade 
surplus declined 45.3 percent during the first half of 
2002-to 2.6 billion USD-relative to the corresponding 
period the year before. During the first six months of 
2002, export revenue declined 40 percent, to 6.5 
billion USD, and imports fell 35 percent. The 
invisibles account (services and income) totaled about 
-4.0 billion USD and current transfers equaled 697 
million USD during the first six months of 2002. 
Consequently, the current account deficit totaled 714 
million USD compared to a 1.35 billion USD surplus 
during the corresponding period in 2001. As a result, 
foreign exchange reserves fell from 10.45 billion USD 
at the start of the year to 8.7 billion USD at the end 
of June 2002. At the end of October, Nigeria\'s foreign 
reserves totaled about 8.0 billion USD. A review of 
Central Bank data shows that the expected trade, 
current account, and overall account figures for 2002 
are likely to be as bad as any data of the last three 
years. 
 
 
14. To stanch the expected outflow, the Central Bank in 
July began allocating foreign exchange through a Dutch 
Auction System, which has narrowed the gap to about ten 
points between the parallel and official rates of 
exchange throughout fall 2002. But pressure has built 
up and there is no reason to expect it to decline. The 
Central Bank recently re-authorized twenty-one banks to 
buy foreign exchange, lifting a ban ahead of time that 
had forbade these banks from engaging in such 
transactions owing to violations of foreign exchange 
regulations. The demand for forex by these banks will 
put pressure on the naira and may lead to further 
depreciation. Consequently, and given the political 
uncertainty ahead, we expect that a larger than normal 
volume of funds will flow out of the capital and money 
markets and into the foreign exchange market during the 
next several months. Such movement will test the recent 
stability in the foreign exchange market, as funds 
drift out of the money and capital markets in response 
to the uncertain electoral prospects in spring 2003. 
 
 
15. In the light of the developments mentioned above, 
Professor Salami warns that Nigeria is experiencing a 
\"lull before a damaging storm.\" He cautions that the 
central government might soon find itself unable to use 
foreign reserves as the primary mechanism to manage the 
exchange rate. Nigeria\'s foreign reserves rose slightly 
in November relative to October, but the volume remains 
close to the CBN\'s self-imposed minimum six-month limit 
necessary to sustain imports. We expect a further 
temporary rise in foreign exchange as a result of the 
recent spike in oil prices and slightly larger OPEC 
quota for Nigeria, which will yield larger revenues, 
and repatriated funds associated with the end of year 
holidays. These flows, associated with the seasonal 
weakening of demand for forex by manufacturers, have 
led to a temporary appreciation of the naira that is 
unlikely to be sustained for the reasons mentioned 
above. Should reserves fall much below that floor, the 
government will have no choice but to look for other 
adjustment mechanisms in 2003.  These might comprise 
extensive import bans and tightening of foreign 
exchange regulations (which would again widen the 
differential between the official and parallel 
markets). 
 
 
Prospects for 2003 
 
 
16. Salami suggested enigmatically that 2003 be called 
the Year of Two Halves. He, like several other analysts 
that we have talked to, expects that expansionary 
fiscal policy will characterize the first half of 2003. 
Salami thinks that a contractionary policy will follow 
during the second half of the year to cure what Salami 
calls fiscal hangover. Continuing deficit spending 
during the first half of the year, coupled with general 
uncertainty and capital flight, will maintain pressure 
on the exchange rate. As the naira depreciates during 
this time, Nigeria\'s heavy dependence on imports will 
induce a rise in inflation. This will cause continued 
erosion of asset prices, and savings will fall as a 
percentage of GDP. Given the relatively low level of 
foreign exchange, the Central Bank will be compelled to 
mop up excess liquidity and the attendant effect will 
be higher interest rates, if the rise is not suppressed 
by administrative fiat. In the light of these 
prospects, investors will be wary about imperiling 
dollar resources for naira; consequently, domestic and 
foreign investment in the non-oil sector in 2003 will 
be low relative to 2000-2001. 
 
 
17.  A few positive aspects may nevertheless emerge in 
2003.  The willingness of banks to devote 10 percent of 
their profits before tax to equity investments may 
boost investment in the real sector in 2003.  In 2002 
little was done with this pool of investible funds, 
which is building up, but creative initiatives by some 
banks and venture capital companies may lead to 
investments that will create employment.  Additional 
jobs are likely to be created in 2003 by the next phase 
of the deregulation of the telecommunications sector as 
the second national carrier, Globalcom Ltd., begins to 
deploy facilities early in 2003. 
Comment 
 
 
18. One key issue highlighted by the reports given us 
is the paucity and unreliability of data.  This is 
dramatized by the discrepancy between the projected 
growth rate for 2002 by the IMF (-0.9%) and the Central 
Bank of Nigeria (3.2%).  While there is little the 
analyst can do about the poor data, it is important to 
footnote this defect and add the necessary caveats to 
the robustness of the analysis. While the central 
message of a possible cloudy outcome is right on the 
mark, analytical focus on the fiscal and fiscal policy 
stance and foreign account suggests that Nigeria\'s 
economic outcome is almost solely the result of policy. 
A rigorous decomposition of the structure of the 
economy shows, however, that the oil and agricultural 
sectors account for about 60 percent of the GDP, and 
performance in both sectors is not driven essentially 
by monetary and fiscal policies.  Performance in the 
oil sector is primarily driven by OPEC and 
international oil prices, while agriculture is still 
largely weather dependent (recall the basis for the IMF- 
Central Bank of Nigeria huge discrepancy on 2002 growth 
rate).  Much of Salami\'s and Utomi\'s analysis focuses 
on the formal (largely manufacturing) sector, but 
manufacturing account for barely 5 percent of GDP. 
This is this kind of structural analysis that leads us 
to put the appropriate caveats to the gloomy forecast; 
it is possible for economic performance to 
significantly improve even without any improvement in 
policy. 
 
 
19.  Nevertheless, Salami\'s and Utomi\'s presentation of 
late November echoed warnings we have heard from other 
experts about the continuing structural imbalances 
within the economy. Government deficits accommodated by 
monetary policy perpetuate these imbalances. These will 
become even more apparent should oil revenues fall. 
Many countries engage in deficit spending to stimulate 
growth; in Nigeria, however, public spending is largely 
ineffective at increasing sustainable development. The 
reason is that so little of those public funds are 
channeled into productive investment.  Moreover, 
government spending disproportionately favors the 
richest four-percent of the population identified 
earlier. These people tend to travel abroad and account 
for a disproportionate share of imports. These factors 
will put additional pressure on the naira.  Since the 
rich generally seek to convert naira into foreign 
exchange quickly when they have large volumes of 
Nigerian currency (as many did so recently during the 
political party conventions), to reduce exchange rate 
risk and because forex is less bulky, the naira will 
surely depreciate during the coming months. 
Conversely, interest rates will remain high to attract 
capital inflows.  So it is to be feared that instead of 
stimulating growth, excessive government spending will 
crowd out the private sector, which will force 
companies to scramble for funds at high interest rates. 
 
 
20.  High interest rates will affect not only the 
private sector.  The cost of government borrowing will 
also remain high.  Consequently, investment in 
infrastructure (roads, education, and public health) 
which has been badly neglected during the last several 
years may continue to be so.  An Emboff who has 
accumulated eight years in Nigeria believes that its 
infrastructure is generally decaying.  What is certain 
is that new investment is insufficient to cover the 
needs generated by population growth and depreciation 
of existing assets.  To redress this situation, fiscal 
policy as it has been implemented throughout the last 
ten years must change. 
 
 
21. Improving fiscal policy would call for public 
service reform and a budgetary process based on a 
better appreciation of economic principles. We have 
often heard Nigerian economists criticize their 
government\'s budget formulators for establishing 
budgets premised on one scenario and usually based upon 
a single oil price. Many of these economists recommend 
that budgets be based on multiple scenarios with 
clearly defined trigger points.  For our part, we think 
that the GON should encourage the Central Bank to issue 
a directive to banks informing them that any and all 
future lending to states and local governments would be 
at their risk.  The federal government would thus offer 
no guarantee and would refuse to \"deduct at source\" 
(i.e., before disbursements from the Federation 
Account) any payments on such debt.  The Central Bank 
could also issue a \"caveat emptor\" notice to 
international banks to discourage lending to states. 
While such actions by the Central Bank would annoy some 
state-level politicians, there would be little they 
might do about it.  (Few local governments are in a 
position to borrow.)  Assuming such actions led to a 
modification of Nigeria\'s budgetary practices, it would 
not only reduce uncertainty; it would also reassure 
observers that while they may not see improvement in 
the next quarter or two, subsequent quarters might hold 
promise of a brighter future.

D). 
 
 
1.  (C)  Summary: Arson is strongly suspected in the December 
24 fire that 
destroyed the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 
headquarters and 
records. The fire followed by barely a week a newspaper 
article asserting 
that there is solid, extensive and documented proof that GON 
officials have been 
stealing much of Nigeria\'s oil revenue.  The leader of a 
previously unknown 
group, the Young Democratic Movement YDM claimed 
responsibility for the 
fire, citing \"unhappiness with the GON\" as the impetus.  He 
and his attorney have 
since been arrested.  The GON has announced there will be 
investigations, but 
observers do not expect anyone to be charged or punished as a 
result.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------- 
WHAT HAPPENED 
------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) During the evening of December 24, fire gutted the 
NNPC\'s Lagos 
headquarters building, which was located on Ikoyi Island in 
Lagos.  Deputy 
Police Commissioner (DPC), Haruna John (Please protect 
accordingly.), 
told  CG and Econoff that the fire began on the eighth floor, 
where the 
offices of the Nigerian Petroleum Investment Management 
Services 
(NAPIM) were located.  NAPIM manages the GON\'s joint ventures 
with international oil companies (Shell, Mobil, Chevron, 
AGIP, 
Elf, and Texaco).  A second fire later ignited on the second 
floor of the building, where the Pipelines and Products 
Marketing Company 
(PPMC) was housed.  PPMC sells diesel fuel, gasoline, 
kerosene, aviation 
kerosene, and similar products.  PPMC recently began 
importing fuel in 
response to a shortfall on the local market. 
 
 
3. (C) Observers noted the slow response of the fire 
department to the fire. 
The fire fighters who arrived first at the scene did so at 
least an hour after 
the blaze had started.  According to the DPC, firemen 
initially refused to 
respond to the blaze until he personally dispatched policemen 
to the fire 
stations with orders to arrest firemen who refused to go. 
When the firemen 
eventually arrived on site, they lacked the proper equipment 
and had to wait for 
a water tanker.  Hours later, a second blaze started on the 
second floor, six 
floors down from the first fire, and consumed the rest of the 
building. 
 
 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
WHY HERE AND WHY NOW? 
------------------------------------------ 
4. (U) On December 17, 2002, Barth Obi Oyibo Thompson of Abia 
State placed a 
three-page statement in the \"Vanguard\", a widely read 
Lagos-based newspaper.  He 
began the article by establishing  his ties to President 
Obasanjo and Andrew Young 
among others and his credentials as a petroleum industry 
expert.  Claiming a 
commitment to Nigeria and to President Olusegun Obasanjo, 
Thompson wrote 
that he was compelled to expose ongoing  fraud and theft of 
Nigeria\'s 
petroleum revenue through under-reporting of exports. 
 
 
5. (U) Oyibo Thompson purported to have at least fifteen 
years of documentary 
history on Nigeria\'s oil exports, and stated that he had 
extensive supportive 
data to prove his claim of fraud. He went on that it has been 
an open secret for 
sometime that \"an unidentified West African country\" has been 
under-reporting 
its oil exports.  According to Thompson, this fact allegedly 
explains why the World 
Bank reports that less than 45% of  Nigeria\'s oil export 
proceeds end up funding 
Nigeria\'s federal budget.  Oyibo Thompson concluded his 
accusation by calling on 
President Obasanjo, whom he considers an honorable man, to 
identify the culprits 
and resolve the problem. 
 
 
6. (C) Comment. Post has learned from Chuka Odom, Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Abia 
State (Please protect accordingly), that \"Barth Obi Oyibo 
Thompson\" is probably an alias. 
Our contact has not been able to locate anyone in Abia State 
who knows this 
Oyibo Thompson but, he surmised that  \"Thompson\" was a senior 
NNPC official 
or a disgruntled employee who definitely had access to 
information.  Our man 
further speculated that \"Thompson\" probably did not work 
alone, and that other 
persons inside NNPC were feeding him information.  The 
reference to Obasanjo 
as an \"honorable man\" may be a subtle hint to the President 
to \"do the right thing,\" 
our source said.  End comment. 
 
 
---------------- 
WHO DID IT 
---------------- 
 
 
7. (U) Chris Nwozobia, leader of the previously unknown Youth 
Democratic 
Movement (YDM), has claimed responsibility for the fire.  He 
reportedly said he 
set the building afire because of \"unhappiness with the 
performance of the Federal 
Government\".  Nwozobia told the media that his group, based 
in Lagos, has members 
throughout the country.  Nwozobia turned himself over to 
State Security headquarters. 
Nwozobia and his attorney, Festus Keyamo, were later arrested. 
 
 
8. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner told us on January 8 
that it is unlikely 
that the YDM had a direct hand in the fire.  If it was 
involved at all, it was 
probably at the instigation of some person or group in an 
effort to cover up 
unethical practices at NNPC. He asserted that it would not 
have been unusual 
for such a group to be hired by a third party for such an 
act. 
 
 
9. (U) Many observers think the fire was an inside job by 
persons interested in 
covering their tracks following wrongdoing.  The fire began 
on the eighth floor, 
where  important documents relating to GON investments were 
kept including 
joint venture contracts and production sharing agreements 
which may yield billions 
of dollars in revenue to the GON. The projects cover 
pipelines, oil field 
services, supply production facilities, and field 
development. 
 
 
10. (U) Among the documents on this floor were those relating 
to cash calls. The 
GON recently paid 24 billion naira (approximately 240 million 
USD) in cash call 
arrears dating to the Abacha years (1994-99). The oil 
companies and the GON 
disagree on the exact amount of the U.S. dollars owed for 
that period. The GON 
says it owes the international oil companies 300 million USD, 
the companies say 
500 million USD. 
 
 
11. (U) Documents relating to the daily sale of petroleum 
products were located 
on the second floor where fire also broke out.  Since the 
NNPC\'s consignees 
typically obtain 30-day credit from the company, some of the 
documents that 
burned may have been essential to a determination of the 
exact amount owed 
to the NNPC.  Current data on fuel imported or refined 
locally was also lost. 
12. (C) On January 13 Econoff met with Chuka Odom, Chief of 
Staff of the 
Governor of Abia State, who opined that the government will 
most probably 
never determine the cause of the blaze.  Odom pointed out 
that ninety percent 
of Nigeria\'s foreign revenue derives from the oil sector, yet 
this is the only sector 
without a cabinet ministry.  Odom asserted that almost any 
senior GON official 
now has unrestricted, and possibly undocumented, access to 
NNPC records. 
 
 
-------------------------- 
LIKELY OUTCOME 
-------------------------- 
 
 
13. (U) Many Nigerians ad public officials have called for a 
thorough 
investigation of the fire.  President Obasanjo, noting the 
loss of vital oil 
sector documents, established a panel of inquiry and the 
police and fire 
departments are also investigating the fire. 
 
 
14. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner said a police panel 
comprising as 
many as fifteen persons is investigating the matter, but he 
expects no significant 
findings.  According to him, senior officials are not 
interested in the truth. 
Although asked to be a member of the investigative panel, 
the DPC said he 
refused to join, fearing reprisals if the investigation were 
done correctly and 
preferring not to be involved if it were botched.   \"It would 
be politically and 
professionally foolhardy,\" he said, \" to uncover and expose 
the perpetrator if that 
person is moneyed or high-powered. This could result in death 
to the person who 
reveals the wrong-doing.\" 
 
 
------------------------- 
WHAT NOW NNPC 
-------------------------- 
 
 
15. (U) The GON was not the only loser as a result of the 
inferno.  The 
headquarters\' 200 employees found themselves potentially 
jobless on 
Christmas Day.  NNPC office workers are temporarily housed at 
the 
headquarters\' guest quarters but some employees, such as 
domestics, are 
now unemployed.  Because of crime in Lagos, many NNPC 
employees kept 
passports, school certificates, money and jewelry at their 
offices and  will 
find it difficult to replace these items. 
 
 
16. (U)  An AmCit oil company executive told ConGen that  the 
oil companies 
have copies of documents pertinent to their businesses at 
their offices in  Nigerian 
and abroad at their corporate headquarters.  NNPC should have 
copies of these 
documents in their Abuja offices, however, NNPC will most 
likely look to the 
oil companies to fill in the gaps. 
 
 
17.  (C) Comment.  NNPC may have suffered a blow to its 
reputation, which 
was not high in any event.  Many people suspect the 
authorities will never 
disclose the real cause of the fire.  Lagos has a long 
history of unsolved fires 
gutting government properties.  For example, the Defense 
Building burnt in 
1991 during a probe of its activities.  Nigeria External 
Telecommunications (NET) 
building burnt twenty years ago as the result of a fire in 
the accounts department. 
Its reconstruction has been in progress for as many years. 
Odua, an investment 
group comprising  five southwestern states,  has lost two of 
their buildings to 
fires in the last seven years.       The skeptics say that 
NNPC will continue to 
conduct business as usual, even if from temporary quarters, 
and the memory 
of the fire and destroyed records will fade.  Long-time Lagos 
residents say 
the various investigating panels will produce reports, but 
these will never be 
released to the public.  Panel members might legitimately 
fear for their personal 
safety if they were to delve too deeply into the 
circumstances of what really 
happened on Christmas eve.

Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES. 
REASONS 1.5 (B) (D) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary: A very discouraged Deputy Police Commissioner 
(DPC) for Lagos State met with CG and Econoff on January 
7 to discuss the recent fire at the national petroleum company 
building and the realities of police work in Lagos State. 
With an undercurrent of futility and resignation, DPC 
Haruna John (please protect) presented his view of crime 
and punishment in Nigeria. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
No way to run a poIice force 
----------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) The Deputy Police Commissioner lamented that it is 
impossible to live on a policeman\'s salary at any level of 
the force. No officers can survive without engaging in the 
corruption that flows from top to bottom. He explained that 
Nigerian police constables earn about N5000 a month -- 
approx. USD 45 -- when they are paid.  Police are forced to 
supplement their incomes and often use \"roadblock money\" 
(bribes extracted from motorists) to subsist.  John confessed 
that he augments his income illicitly with a construction 
business that is made possible by his position and rank on 
the police force. 
 
 
3.  (C) Althouqh uniforms are promised by the government, 
most policemen buy their own because there are never enough 
for everyone.  Sometimes this results in incomplete 
uniforms or uniforms of differing colors and fabric types. 
Some policemen even chip in their own money to gas up the 
police cars. Others use the courtyards of police stations 
as places to sleep. 
 
 
Asked why anyone joins the police, John stated that he 
believes in the force although he admits that some use 
it for criminal activities. 
 
 
Some join because they see opportunities to make money 
throuqh extortion or because they have no other prospects. 
Despite a tradition of testing for competence, the police 
force today checks neither background nor ability. 
The illiterate, miscreants, and even those with criminal 
records can and do join. 
 
 
4. (C) It is not surprising that criminals, politicians, 
and the public treat the police with disdain.  John explained 
that when he first was posted to Lagos, he instructed his 
officers to arrest criminals in the Oodua People\'s Congress, 
a Yoruba vigilante and criminal orqanization. To his chagrin, 
John was openly reprimanded and his instructions reversed. 
In Lagos, he learned, the police don\'t arrest the OPC. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
A Rawlings style housecleaning 
------------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) Pointing to the corruption of people in power, John 
called the electorate apathetic and predicted that in April 
the voters will elect \"whoever gives them the most rice.\" 
He expects election violence in many areas of Nigeria, 
particularly the Western states, but he predicted that 
Lagos will be relatively peaceful because it is an Alliance 
for Democracy stronghold and virtually a one-party state. 
 
 
6. (C) Visibly distressed and admitting that he hates 
the military, John said that a Jerry Rawlings style of 
housecleaning might be the only way to solve Nigeria\'s 
problems. Reminded that corruption is not unique to 
civilian governments, John rationalized that military 
governments were surrounded by fewer sycophants and 
supporters looking for financial favors. Therefore, more 
money trickled down to the masses. 
 
 
7. (C) DPC John said that all indications suggest the 
December 24 fire at the Nigerian National Petroleum Company 
(reftel) was deliberately set. He opined that the suspect 
in custody was probably paid to torch the building by those 
who wanted to cover up wrong-doing.  Looking pensive, the 
DPC predicted that the true story about the fire would never 
be exposed. 
 
 
8.  (C) Comment.  The Nigerian police force has long been 
neglected by the GON and the DPC is willing to talk about it. 
Without massive assistance, the Nigerian police force will 
continue to be ill-trained and could not handle large-scale 
violence should it arise in the course of the April 2003 
elections.  The police force in Lagos would welcome USG 
assistance, even if only for a small number of police 
officials prior to the elections.  DPC John realizes that it 
will take a long time to address all of the police force\'s 
problems satisfactorily. Meanwhile, he expects that extortion 
and other abuses will continue as a way of life , as 
will the force\'s bad relations with the community.

REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
1. (U)  ECON M/C CALLED ON COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTRY 
ADDITIONAL SECRETARY S.N. MENON ON JANUARY 21.  MENON IS THE 
SENIOR-MOST OFFICIAL AT THE MINISTRY WITH RESPONSIBILITIES 
FOR WTO AND THE EU.  ECON M/C REVIEWED A NUMBER OF ISSUES 
WITH MENON INCLUDING: OUR WTO AGRICULTURAL AND EXPORT CREDIT 
PROPOSALS, THE US TRIPS MORATORIUM PROPOSAL, WTO 
CONSULTATIONS ON EU BIOTECH MORATORIUM, AND PROSPECTS FOR 
ACTING COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER SHOURIE AND AMBASSADOR 
ZOELLICK TO MEET IN THE COMING WEEKS. 
 
 
WTO AGRICULTURAL NEGOTIATIONS 
----------------------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) ECON M/C BRIEFED MENON ON KEY POINTS OF THE US 
EXPORT CREDITS PROPOSAL AND OUR CRITIQUE OF THE EC\'S 
AGRICULTURAL PROPOSAL.  ALTHOUGH EVINCING FAMILIARITY WITH 
THE US AND EC POSITIONS ON AGRICULTURE, MENON EXPRESSED 
APPRECIATION FOR THE OVERVIEW AND RELATED NON-PAPERS, BOTH OF 
WHICH HE SAID THEY WOULD STUDY CLOSELY. 
 
 
3. (SBU) MENON NOTED THAT INDIA\'S POSITION ON AGRICULTURE, A 
FORMAL SUBMISSION OF WHICH WILL BE MADE IN GENEVA ON FEBRUARY 
22, PROVIDES FOR LITTLE FLEXIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO MARKET 
ACCESS.  INDIA WILL LOOK FOR URUGUAY ROUND-LEVEL REDUCTIONS 
ONLY AND WILL INSIST ON SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT, 
INCLUDING SPECIAL SAFEGUARDS AND PROTECTIONS UNDER THE \"FOOD 
SECURITY\" BOX. HE SAID THAT INDIAN POLITICIANS AND DOMESTIC 
FARM GROUPS ARE FIRM ON THIS POINT.  THE GOI WILL \"DIG-IN AND 
STAND\" ON THIS ISSUE AS NECESSARY, HE ADDED.  REINFORCING THE 
POINT, MENON CITED A GOI INTERNAL STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT 165 
MILLION INDIANS AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS ARE COMPLETELY 
DEPENDENT ON 33 \"SENSITIVE\" CROPS.  MENON THOUGHT IT UNLIKELY 
THERE WOULD BE MEANINGFUL REDUCTIONS OF INDIAN AGRICULTURAL 
TARIFFS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. BEFORE INDIA COULD EVEN 
CONSIDER THE KINDS OF AGRICULTURAL SECTOR REFORMS 
CONTEMPLATED BY THE US (AND EVEN THE EC), INDIA WOULD NEED TO 
KNOW \"ACTUAL REDUCTIONS\" BY THE US AND EU OF EXPORT 
SUBSIDIES, DOMESTIC SUPPORTS, AND TARIFFS. HE ADDED THAT 
INDIA DOES NOT WANT AN OVERLY AMBITIOUS AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM 
IN THE DOHA ROUND AND IS FEARFUL THAT THE US AND EC WILL CUT 
A DEAL AT THE END THAT LEAVES OTHERS LEFT OUT AND 
DISADVANTAGED. 
 
 
4. (SBU) MENON NOTED THAT INDIAN AGRICULTURAL MINISTER AJIT 
SINGH IS CURRENTLY IN GENEVA FOR DISCUSSIONS.  SINGH WILL 
ALSO BE TRAVELING TO TOKYO FOR THE WTO MINI-MINISTERIAL O/A 
FEBRUARY 14-15. 
 
 
TRIPS MORATORIUM 
---------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU)  MENON CONFIRMED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED AND STUDIED 
USTR\'S PROPOSAL FOR A TRIPS MORATORIUM AND CONCLUDED THAT 
THEY COULD NOT SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVE AS IT WAS \"NOT ENOUGH\" 
TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  MENON SUGGESTED THAT FURTHER THOUGHT 
BE GIVEN TO FINDING A CREATIVE SOLUTION TO BREAK THE IMPASSE. 
 HE INDICATED THAT THEY ARE PREPARED TO EXPLORE WAYS OF 
ACCOMPLISHING THIS WITH USDEL AND OTHERS IN GENEVA. ECON M/C 
URGED MENON TO BE FORTHCOMING WITH ANY CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS 
THEY MIGHT HAVE. 
 
 
EU BIOTECH MORATORIUM 
--------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU)  IN RESPONSE TO ECON M/C\'S PRESENTATION, MENON 
INDICATED THAT THE GOI SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM, IN PRINCIPLE, 
IN SUPPORTING AND/OR JOINING WITH US AND OTHERS FOR 
CONSULTATIONS IN THE WTO ON THE EU\'S  MORATORIUM ON APPROVALS 
FOR BIOTECH AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. MENON SAID HE WOULD HAVE 
TO CONFIRM THIS WITH THE ENVIRONMENT MINISTRY, WHICH HAS THE 
LEAD WITHIN THE GOI ON BIOTECH ISSUES, AND WITH THEIR 
AMBASSADOR TO THE WTO IN GENEVA, AND WOULD GET BACK TO US 
WITHIN A WEEK.

7. (SBU) MENON REITERATED THE MINISTRY\'S INTEREST IN 
SCHEDULING A MEETING BETWEEN ACTING-COMMERCE MINISTER SHOURIE 
AND USTR ZOELLICK ON THE MARGINS OF THE TOKYO WTO 
MINI-MINISTERIAL, FEBRUARY 14-15.  ECON M/C SAID HE WOULD 
SHARE THIS WITH USTR, WHICH IS ALREADY AWARE OF THE REQUEST. 
 
 
8. (SBU) SEPARATELY, MENON ADVISED THAT AN INVITATION WAS 
EXTENDED TO USTR ZOELLICK AND EU COMMISSIONER LAMY ON JANUARY 
20 TO ATTEND A GATHERING OF 15 OR SO KEY COMMONWEALTH TRADE 
MINISTERS IN NEW DELHI, MARCH 15-16.  MENON SAID THE MEETING 
IS NOT A \"WTO MINI-MINISTERIAL, AS ERRONEOUSLY DESCRIBED IN 
THE INDIAN PRESS ON JANUARY 21, BUT INSTEAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR QUALITY INTERACTION BETWEEN KEY DOHA ROUND PLAYERS. MENON 
IS PROVIDING POST A COPY OF THE JOINT GOI/CONFEDERATION OF 
INDIAN INDUSTRY (CII) INVITATION WITH ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND 
MATERIALS.  ACCORDING TO MENON,  CII\'S WASHINGTON OFFICE WAS 
TO HAVE SENT THE INVITATION TO USTR. 
 
 
9. (C) ECON M/C APPRISED MENON OF ACTING-MINISTER SHOURIE\'S 
EXPRESSION OF INTEREST TO THE AMBASSADOR ON JANUARY 13 IN 
POSSIBLY TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON IN THE MID-MARCH TO 
EARLY-APRIL TIMEFRAME FOR SUBSTANTIVE CONSULTATIONS WITH 
AMBASSADOR ZOELLICK AND SENIOR USTR STAFF (REF A).  MENON 
NOTED THAT THIS IDEA WAS STILL \"ON\" AS FAR AS HE UNDERSTOOD, 
BUT WOULD, OF COURSE, BE CONTINGENT ON THE ACTING-MINISTER 
CONTINUING TO HOLD THE COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY PORTFOLIO. MENON 
SAID THAT WHILE IT IS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN THAT THERE WILL BE 
A CABINET RESHUFFLE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK, PREDICTIONS ABOUT 
ARUN SHOURIE\'S PROSPECTS IN A NEW CABINET LINEUP ARE PURE 
SPECULATION AT THIS POINT.  MENON THOUGHT THERE WAS A 
REASONABLE CHANCE THAT SHOURIE WOULD STAY ON AS COMMERCE 
MINISTER (SANS THE INDUSTRY PORTFOLIO), AND RELINQUISH HIS 
POSITION AS DISINVESTMENT MINISTER.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AD PARTY - CONSENSUS OF YORUBA NATION? 
 
CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Despite recent factionalization, the Alliance 
for Democracy (AD) in Lagos State presented the public with a 
face of party consensus in their January 8 gubernatorial 
congress.  Following his challengers\' disqualification, 
incumbent Governor Bola Tinubu took the nomination unopposed. 
 Tinubu used the occasion to announce that Femi Pedro, 
managing director of First Atlantic Bank plc, will replace 
the embattled Senator Kofoworla Bucknor-Akerele as his deputy 
governor.  The congress promised much but revealed little 
about the AD\'s potential as a cross-regional party.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
THE INCUMBENT\'S RUBBER STAMP 
---------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Incumbent Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu 
received 100 percent of the 304 delegates\' votes on Jan. 8. 
The two gubernatorial challengers had been disqualified from 
the contest by the internal AD screening committee. 
Reportedly, the first challenger, David Olasumbo Onitiri, had 
failed to produce proper tax documents while the second, 
Babatunde Olowu, was unable to prove his AD credentials. 
(The local chapter of which he claimed to be a member told 
the screening committee their records showed no sign of 
Olowu\'s membership.)  One or both of the challengers 
allegedly misrepresented material facts on the nomination 
forms.  Tinubu expressed his disappointment at the lack of 
competition in his acceptance speech but called the exercise 
free, fair, and transparent. (Comment.  Tinubu himself, 
however, has been known to play fast and loose with the facts 
and has been caught in the past embellishing his educational 
achievements.  A current rumor on the street is that Tinubu 
has a criminal record in the U.S. which would 
constitutionally disqualify him for elective office.  In 
fact, he never had a criminal arrest, but the rumor is too 
juicy to let die and we may hear more during the course of 
the campaign.  End comment.) 
 
 
----------------------------- 
NEW DEPUTY GOVERNOR APPOINTED 
----------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Tinubu concluded his acceptance speech with the 
announcement that Olufemi Pedro, managing director of First 
Atlantic Bank plc, was his choice to fill the hole left by 
embattled Senator (Ms.) Kofoworla Bucknor-Akerele\'s bitter 
resignation as deputy governor late last year.  A source 
confirms that State Commissioner of Economic Planning and 
Budget Yemi Cardoso was offered the position of Deputy 
Governor but declined.  Source alleges that Cardoso, a \"quiet 
Christian,\" is highly talented as a government official but 
is \"not a big politician.\"  Tinubu and Pedro claim to have a 
strong working relationship and mutual respect. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
DELEGATES\' DEMOGRAPHY AND REPRESENTATIVES\' SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
4. (U) Delegates included state commissioners, AD executive 
committee members, senators, and members of the houses of 
assembly and representatives.  AD voting procedures call for 
delegates to line up in front of their candidate of choice. 
Since Tinubu ran unopposed, the party chairman asked 
delegates to indicate their vote for the incumbent by 
\"standing up to be counted\" when their local government was 
called.  Delegations from Oshodi/Isolo, Surulere, and Ikorodu 
local councils were absent and therefore not represented at 
the congress.  \"Logistical reasons\" prevented these three 
councils from appearing at the congress, according to the 
congress organizers.  Onitiri posits that the missing 
delegates \"were not allowed to participate in the exercise 
because they knew their votes would not be for Tinubu.\" 
Delegates from the other 17 local governments of Lagos gave 
unanimous support to Tinubu:  Agege 16, Animosho 18, Ajeroni 
18, Apapa 17, Amuwo 16, Badagary 15, Epe 24, Eti-osa 19, 
Ije-Lekki 15, Ifako 16, Ikeja 18, Kosofe 16, Lagos Island 28, 
Lagos Mainland 16, Mushin 19, Ojo 14, and Shomolu 19.  The 
entire process took less than an hour and a half.  Election 
observer Chief Kemi Odebiyi registered just one complaint 
with PolOff the polling began six hours behind schedule. 
 
 
5. (C) ETHNICITY, AGE and GENDER.  PolOff\'s search for 
non-Yoruba delegates was fruitless, despite enlisting the 
help of INEC observers and the governor\'s aide, Folorunsho 
Folarin-Coker.  Delegates ranged in age from their 20s to 60s 
and upwards.  Often, the delegate who appeared to be eldest 
among the delegates of a given local government was elected 
unopposed as the constituents\' nominee to the House of 
Representatives.  Where the candidate ran unopposed, the most 
senior voter would stand paunch to paunch with the candidate 
in a show of apparent solidarity.  Other times, younger 
candidates were supported by aging delegates.  Although many 
elections involved no choice of candidates, several proved to 
be a real contest.  In cases where a winner could not be 
determined, delegates were asked to consult amongst 
themselves and prepare for another vote at the end of the 
contest. 
 
 
6.  (C)  According to some analysts, single women are more 
likely to participate in politics than married women, whose 
husbands frequently \"prohibit\" them from such activities. 
Financing a campaign is also a consideration, and currently 
there are very few women with the desire to enter politics as 
well as the money to invest in a campaign.  As a result of 
these constraints, the vast majority of the delegates and the 
contestants were male.  Nonetheless, a few daring females ran 
for the party\'s nomination to the House of Representatives. 
Like their male counterparts, most of the female contestants 
withdrew at the last moment in the name of \"peace and harmony 
for the good of the party,\" hinting at strong influences in 
decision-making from beyond public view and across gender 
lines.  Of the other females who had had the nerve to contest 
for local seats, two received no votes while a third received 
a single vote against overwhelming support for their male 
competitors. 
 
 
7. (C) Adefunmilayo Smith-Tejuoso, (Mushin Local Government, 
Lagos State) however, managed to gain all but one of her 
fellow delegates\' votes to beat her sole male opponent for 
the post of Mushin\'s AD Representative.  An exuberant 
Smith-Tejuoso told PolOff that she barely had been able to 
stand from her chair to walk forward and contest after 
watching one after another of her fellow women step down from 
their contests.  Still struggling to catch her breath after 
the vote, Smith-Tejuoso reflected, \"I felt like I should win. 
 I knew I understood the issues better than my opponent and I 
had really worked to gain the support of each of the voters. 
But, you know, in an election you never know for certain what 
the outcome will be!\" 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
VIOLENCE MARS SENATORIAL NOMINATIONS 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
8. (C) Violence accompanied the January 9 primaries for the 
Lagos AD senatorial candidates.  Incumbent Senator for Lagos 
Central Tokunbo Afikuyomi defeated former Mushin Local 
Government Chairman Alhaji Ganiyu Solomon and Barrister 
Adegbesan to gain the nomination for the Lagos West 
senatorial candidature.  Protesters against Afikuyomi\'s 
victory allegedly barricaded the entry and exit points at the 
venue.  Although Afikuyomi won 122 of the 143 votes, his 
opponents argued that as a non-resident of the area, he is 
ill-suited to represent the district.  Protesters reportedly 
doused two police anti-crime squad members with \"a substance 
which appeared to be acid,\" provoking an exchange of gunfire. 
 Protesters \"smashed\" several vehicles and caused other 
mischief against official property.  Tinubu countered reports 
that the demonstration resulted in his being held hostage at 
the venue for several hours, saying the atmosphere was 
\"carnival-like\" and democratic.  (Comment. Folarin-Coker, 
however, admitted that the convention had been \"held hostage\" 
with delegates \"barricaded\" inside the hall.  He blamed the 
incident on local \"area boys\" (street gangs of young, 
unemployed men who can be paid to engage in political 
violence) who had a \"number of ill-defined complaints\" 
against the local government.  He continued saying that these 
\"supporters\" of the losers did not say the poll was rigged. 
They just engaged in open violence following the outcome. 
End comment.) 
 
 
9. (U) Former Lagos State Commissioner for Home Affairs and 
Culture Musiliu Obanikoro won the Lagos Central senatorial 
nomination with 72 of 85 votes against Lanre Towry-Coker (who 
received four) and Dapo Durosinmi-Etti (who received nine). 
Dr. Olorunnimbe Mamora, Speaker of the Lagos State House of 
Assembly, won the Lagos East senatorial nomination unopposed 
when his challengers stepped down from the competition. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
NATIONAL SCENE: WAITING FOR PRIME TIME 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
10. (U) At the state level, AD is dominated almost 
exclusively by Yoruba ethnic nationals.  At the executive 
council level, major AD players are northerners.  The party\'s 
upper echelons appear to slowly be building a national 
political strategy.  Since Governor Mala Kachallah defected 
to the AD, Borno State has joined Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, 
Ondo, and Ekiti states as AD ruled.  AD is hoping to gain 
ground in Plateau, Kaduna, and Kwara States this round and 
hold those states it currently controls.  The AD has not 
declared a manifest \"bill of rights\" yet because it \"wants to 
take things a step further,\" a source argues. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
PDP MERGE?  REACTION TO OBASANJO\'S PDP NOMINATION 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
11. (C) AD leaders continue to refute allegations that the 
party intends to merge with President Obasanjo\'s party, the 
PDP.  A source from Tinubu\'s camp confirms a deal was in fact 
struck not to contest the presidential election and to throw 
AD support behind Obasanjo.  Two out of Lagos\' three national 
senators decamped from AD to PDP long ago, an embarrassment 
the AD has yet to live down. 
12. (C) Had Obasanjo lost the nomination, one Yoruba source 
asserts, AD fully expected former President Ibrahim Babangida 
to have \"come straight out to contest\" while the Yoruba 
people sat back and \"yawned.\"  In contrast to other pundits\' 
views that an upset over Obasanjo at the primary would have 
sent Yoruba youths into fits of violent rage across Lagos, 
the source stated that this would have been unlikely given 
that militant groups such as the O\'odua Peoples\' Congress 
(OPC) had not been mobilized.  \"If (former Vice President 
Alex) Ekwueme had won,\" he argues, \"part of us would have 
been relieved.  \'OK, let (the Igbo) have their turn,\' we 
would have said.  \'Then, in 2007 we can go for president or 
VP.\'  Now, we will have to wait years before it will again be 
our turn.\" 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
OLD BOYS\' POLYARCHY MIXED WITH HOMEGROWN POLITICS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
13. (C)  COMMENT.  Although the vote was conducted openly, 
the violence accompanying the Lagos senatorial west contest 
reveals cracks in the legitimacy of the AD selection process. 
 Much of the negotiating in AD politics appears to take place 
between the eight or nine \"wise men\" of the party, while the 
details are worked out between contenders in the form of cash 
pay-offs or other political concessions.  AD issued a 
statement that the challengers\' nomination fees would be 
refunded.  Disqualified challenger Onitiri protested the 
screening committee\'s disqualification of himself and Olowu, 
claiming that his tax certificate was in fact valid.  \"The 
whole arrangement was dictatorial,\" he later asserted to the 
to AD\'s South-West zonal appeal panel in Oshogbo.   Echoing 
Alex Ekwueme\'s denunciation of the PDP convention, Onitiri 
called the Lagos AD convention a \"charade.\" 
 
 
14. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  On a more positive note, the 
Lagos AD showed signs of cohesion and political 
sophistication reminiscent of political parties with an 
identifiable grassroots base.  Lagos State House of Assembly 
Speaker Mamora was placed in the Lagos East senatorial 
contest due to AD\'s expectation of a tough battle in that 
district in the general election, and his colleagues 
supported him.  Instead of the bags of money prominently 
carted around the PDP convention, bags of hats with 
pro-Tinubu and AD propaganda were disbursed amongst the 
delegates.  The voting venues were not grandiose, lavishly 
paid for by the government, but practical locations obtained 
at discounted rates through party contacts.  The party looked 
more like, well, a party.  But this union could be difficult 
to sustain cross-regionally and cross-ethnically.  For now, 
AD officials insist they have the political know-how to 
overcome national obstacles.  At least Tinubu\'s acceptance 
speech was able to draw reference to concrete initiatives he 
had conducted during his governorship, including governance 
figures that would warm the heart of any policy wonk. 
 
 
15. (C)  COMMENT CONTINUED.  While the AD took great pains to 
appear to have zen-like consensus behind their candidates, 
fierce competition appeared to take place behind the scenes. 
The facade of complete unity may intimidate candidates of 
other parties, but the AD could be hurting its long-term 
national competitiveness by inhibiting its members\' chances 
to practice the art of losing gracefully in public.  This 
political skill will likely prove as vital to the 
sustainability of Nigerian democracy as that of winning 
emphatically.

SUBJECT: EXPLOSION IN LAGOS 
 
1.  Sensitive But Unclassified. 
 
 
2.  At approximately 1110 on Sunday, February 2, 2003, there 
was an explosion in Idumagbo Street, located between the 
Carter Bridge and Third Mainland Bridge on Lagos Island.  The 
area is a lage market and residential area comprised of two 
and three story business and residential buildings. 
 
 
3.  No official Americans live on Lagos Island and no FSN 
staff have been identified as living in this area of Lagos. 
The closest USG facility to the area of the explosion is the 
Consulate\'s Public Affairs Section which is located on the 
opposite end of the island about four miles away.  Three 
buildings reportedly collapsed as a result of the explosion 
and several others are severely damaged.  Julius Berger 
Construction Company was asked to assist with rescue 
operations.   As of 1600 hours local on 3 February, there are 
no known American casualties among the twenty-eight confirmed 
dead, and up to fifty injured. 
 
 
4.  Immediately following the explosion \"area boys\" and 
others began looting a bank that was either at ground zero or 
near the point of detonation.  It took police several hours 
to contain the looting.  Police have reportedly cordoned off 
the area. 
 
 
5.  Local Guard Force REACT vehicles were sent to the area to 
ascertain the cause of the explosion.  There are no confirmed 
reports of how the explosion occurred. 
 
 
6.  Speculative reports point to several possible causes of 
the explosion.  Initial reports indicated that either 
political motives, an attempt to hide problems at the bank, 
or a bank robbery gone bad were behind the blast.  The police 
bomb squad continues to investigate, but offered RSO the 
possibility that some repairmen caused the explosion while 
drilling a hole and hitting some electrical wires connected 
to a water heater.  Other reports indicate there may have 
been a bomb or a collection of gas cylinders that exploded. 
Immediately after the blast, the Lagos State Governor\'s 
office told CG that a gas cylinder in an area of poorly 
constructed buildings could have been responsible for the 
total collapse of one building and severe damage to others. 
The police are not expected to have conclusive evidence of 
the cause for at least several days.

1.  (C)  Summary: RSO met with police officials on Thursday 
and Friday 02/06 and 02/07 regarding last Sunday\'s explosion 
in Lagos.  Police provided some insight into the explosion. 
RSO staff has also been in contact with the bomb squad in an 
effort to see explosives taken from the scene.  One police 
contact provided additional thoughts on the fire at NNPC. 
End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (C) On Thursday 02/06/03, RSO met with Assistant 
Commissioner Ojiri (please protect) concerning police support 
for the Consulate in the event of hostilities and to request 
information regarding the explosion on Sunday 02/02/03.  AC 
Ojiri confirmed that the area of the explosion is a market 
area where Lagos merchants go to buy wholesale merchandise 
for resale throughout Lagos.  He said he did not believe the 
explosion was terrorist related and cited the death of a 
local Immam as proof.  The explosion could have been 
politically motivated citing the upcoming elections.  The 
most likely cause of the explosions was the storage of the 
explosives by someone needing money and having a storage 
space for rent.  Unfortunately, the bomb squad was unable to 
identify the origin of the explosives.  When RSO offered that 
the USG was standing by to offer assistance if requested, AC 
Ojiri said that the Nigerian Police were not yet ready to 
request assistance, but he would pass on the offer on Friday 
when he met with the Lagos State Commissioner of Police  When 
asked if the house where the explosion took place might be a 
bomb factory, AC Ojiri initially did not understand the 
question stating the place of the explosion was not the 
target.  When asked again, AC Ojiri suggested the possibility 
that the owner of the explosives asked someone to arrange 
storage for a fee and the explosives were stored in a 
warehouse area of the residence. 
 
 
3.  (C)  On Friday 02/07/03, RSO met with Superintendent 
Garba Baba-Umar (please protect) head of Ikoyi Island police 
district.  During the conversation, Superintendent Baba-Umar 
described the explosives as two types.  One type was long and 
rectangular about the size of a desktop stapler and the 
second was round like an apple but bigger than a hand 
grenade.  The Superintendent advised that members of the bomb 
squad had never seen these types of explosives.  The 
Superintendent offered the following description of events of 
the explosion:  There was a small explosion that started a 
fire followed by two larger explosions that brought down the 
houses.  The superintendent did not offer how the first 
explosion was caused.  The Superintendent said he suggested a 
sweep of the neighborhood to locate additional caches of 
explosives to his superiors, but his idea was not 
enthusiastically received.  He advised that he believes the 
investigation is going slowly because Lagos State politics 
was behind the explosions.  He cited the confiscation of 
numerous weapons by numerous agencies in the past several 
months as further evidence of Lagos State political 
involvement in recent problems.  He also advised that 
numerous \"area boys\" who have been involved in a gang war 
have been charged to court for criminal activities only to be 
released on bail at the urging of political leaders and their 
lawyers. 
 
 
4.  (C)  Superintendent Baba Umar (please protect) provided 
the following information regarding the NNPC fire.  He said 
that he has a tape recording of the suspect from the NNPC 
fire in which the suspect admits starting the fire.  The 
Superintendent advised that he did not believe the suspect 
participated in the fire.  The Superintendent advised the 
only troubling part of the confession was the suspect\'s 
reference that Kaduna would be next.  The Superintendent 
advised that the NNPC refinery in Kaduna caught fire the day 
following the fire at NNPC headquarters in Lagos.  The 
Superintendent said he believed the NNPC fires were 
politically motivated. 
 
 
5.  (C)  RSO FSNI has spoken to the bomb squad deputy 
commander several times during the week who has confirmed the 
explosives are commercial explosives.  RSO has requested to 
see the explosives with the intention of photographing them. 
The Commander of the bomb squad was in Abuja on Friday and 
the request will be made again on Monday.  The investigation 
into the cause of the explosion continues.  RSO will provide 
additional information as it becomes available.

Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINS0JN-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) A 
 
 
ND (D). 
 
 
1.  (U)  Summary.  Once almost guaranteed re-election to the 
governorship of oil producing Bayelsa State, the incumbent, 
DSP Alamieyesiegha, is facing serious charges of corruption 
that have the possibility of disqualifying him.  In the four 
years of his administration, the governor has had some very 
visible successes in improving the infrastructure and economy 
of Bayelsa.  Despite his accomplishments, the fact of 
continuing legal challenges to his candidacy reflects 
dissatisfaction with the corruption that permeates Nigerian 
politics.  End summary. 
 
 
Background 
 
 
2. (C)  For at least the past fifty years, repeated attempts 
have been made to divide Nigeria up into a manageable and 
rational pattern of States that would satisfy the demands for 
autonomy of its hundreds of distinct ethnic groups.  Parts of 
both Delta and Rivers States were combined in 1996 to form 
Bayelsa State and meet the desires of the Ijaw ethnic group. 
Bayelsa thus became the thirty-sixth and newest Nigerian 
State.  The Governor of Bayelsa is Chief Diepreye Solomon 
Peter Alamieyesiegha (known to his supporters as \"DSP\" or the 
\"Governor-General of the Ijaws\".)  He is a member of the 
ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and until the PDP 
gubernatorial primary in early January, DSP appeared to be a 
shoo-in for re-election.  Minister of Public Works and close 
confidant of President Olusegun Obasanjo, Tony Anenih, had 
endorsed the re-election of all incumbent PDP governors and 
vowed the Party\'s support. DSP was rumored to have a campaign 
warchest of billions of naira; so much financing that he 
reportedly purchased thirty-five speed boats to campaign in 
the region where it is usually easier to travel by boat than 
by road.  In late January, however, a stumbling block arose 
in the form of a citizen\'s complaint against DSP to the 
Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses 
Commission (ICPC).  The complaint charged him with fraud and 
improper use of government funds.  Eight other PDP governors 
(four of whom, including DSP, are from the south) are also 
under investigation by the ICPC.  With elections scheduled 
for March and April, the road to the Government House at 
Creek Haven does not look as easy for DSP as it once did. 
 
 
Getting to Bayelsa 
 
 
3. (U) Shortly before the ICPC investigations started, 
PolOffs went to pay a courtesy/orientation visit to Governor 
Alamieyeseigha . After flying from Lagos to Port Harcourt in 
Rivers State, the short trip by road to Yenagoa, the capital 
of Bayelsa, underscored the endemic problem of no maintenance 
of federal roads in most of Nigeria.  Bayelsa is a littoral 
oil state and, with its share of oil income, should be fairly 
prosperous and well-maintained, but gaping holes in the road 
made for slow going in our short drive to the capital.  The 
situation changed remarkably, however, at the Rivers/Bayelsa 
border.  A four-lane, newly-paved highway led north into the 
State through what appeared to be overgrown, uncultivated 
land.  About two miles from the Bayelsa State Offices, a 
\"commercial strip\" started that ran all the way to our 
destination at the State Offices.  The strip was only one 
small store or stall deep, and we then understood how Bayelsa 
State earned the sobriquet of the \"State with only one city 
and one road.\" 
 
 
Big man in Bayelsa 
 
 
4.  (C)  We were ushered in to the spacious and elegantly 
appointed offices of DSP, to join a group of people waiting 
to see the governor.  After a wait of slightly over an hour 
during which DSP apparently dealt with state vendors and 
contractors ahead of us in line, we got to talk with the 
governor.  (Comment.  DSP actually is a big man--over six 
feet tall and very heavyset.  He and the PDP members of his 
cabinet and administration are always photographed in black, 
wide-brimmed fedoras, giving them the appearance of early 
twentieth century Mafioso.  End comment.)  DSP was expansive 
and happy to spend time telling PolOffs of the 
accomplishments of his administration.  He said that when he 
came into office, there was no State Office building or 
governor\'s Mansion, and he slept on the floor of the 
dilapidated former office building.  Power generation in the 
State had been so bad or lacking, he said, that until 
recently the State could provide power only every third day. 
He bragged about the new road and a recent improvement in the 
provision of electric power to the capital.  He told us that 
his dream of building the School of Arts and Sciences at 
Niger Delta University had come true when the school opened 
early this year. 
5. (C)  Asked about his campaign for governor, he was proud 
to tell us about the thirty-five boats he had bought and 
invited us to take a boat tour with him of the State on our 
next trip.  DSP was not so ebullient when asked about 
challengers he faced and possible political violence that 
might flare up during the campaigns.  At the time, DSP faced 
at least ten opponents, even some from his own party and 
administration.  He frowned and answered that none of those 
contenders would last to the primary (he was correct), and if 
any one caused politically related violence he would \"get 
them, even if (he) had to track them to their bedrooms!\"  The 
meeting ended on a positive note with the governor reminding 
us that Bayelsa was only six years old and had already made 
great progress under his administration. 
6. (C)  Comment.  DSP is a former military officer, as are 
many at all levels of the Obasanjo government.  Military 
style of unitary control, with everyone having to come to him 
for decisions, was evident during our meeting.  He has no 
real opposition, and if the ICPC investigation does not 
disqualify him, he will probably be re-elected.  However, the 
ICPC complaint was brought by noted human rights activist, 
attorney and presidential candidate, Gani Fawahinmi.  The 
presence of Fawahinmi, a dogged pursuer of alleged 
miscreants, makes the matter unlikely to just disappear. 
Despite public statements of support from the PDP and the 
Obasanjo administration, DSP has had to take focus off his 
campaign and respond to the multiplying charges.  The facts 
that DSP has faced one challenge after another to his 
candidacy, and that one of the nine (Chinwoke Mbadinuju from 
Anambra State) has already been disqualified, reflect the 
public\'s growing demand for transparency and accountability 
in government.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AN ASSESSMENT OF POLITICIZED ISLAM IN THE 
SOUTH 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1. (C)  Summary.  Islam as a factor in politics in 
southwestern Nigeria and the 
threat of the imposition of Shari\'a (Koranic law) in the 
south are not current 
or near-term possibilities.  However, all observers agree 
that overwhelming 
poverty, and uncertainty and possible instability in 
government in Nigeria are 
factors that could lead to some future politicization of 
Islam in the region. 
End summary. 
 
 
Background 
 
 
2. (U)  Northern Nigeria has had a significant Muslim 
population (Hausa and 
Fulani ethnic groups) since the eleventh century, and is 
today over 90 percent 
Muslim.  Only as recently as the nineteenth century has Islam 
spread 
significantly in the south.  Southern Muslims (mainly in the 
Yoruba southwest) 
have lived peacefully with their Christian and animist 
countrymen for decades. 
However, according to researchers on the issue of the rise of 
political or 
fundamentalist Islam, conditions in all of Nigeria over the 
past decade have 
become ideal for the development of politicized Islam.  They 
point to the facts 
that Nigeria is the most populous country on the continent, 
Muslims probably 
make up over half its population, there is wide-spread 
poverty, political 
instability, a weak and ineffective police force and 
prodigious official 
corruption all of which have, in other majority Muslim 
countries, led to the 
rise of dissident Islamists.  Some Muslims have addressed 
social grievances 
through religious expression in fundamentalist appeals to 
piety or challenges 
to the political status quo.  It should be noted here that 
Usama bin Laden\'s 
original protest was against what he believed to be the 
corrupt, greedy, and 
ineffective ruling al Saud family who claimed to be the 
protectors of the 
holiest places in Islam, but who allowed US troops 
(non-Muslims) to defile 
Saudi soil by their very presence. 
 
 
3. (U) In 1999 Nigeria transitioned from military to civilian 
rule and 
installed retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, a Christian 
Yoruba from the south, 
as President.  According to southern observers, this was 
accomplished only because 
Obasanjo and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) agreed to 
support the official 
adoption of Shari\'a law in several northern states. 
(Comment. Several of our 
southern interlocutors, Christian and Muslim and from several 
political parties, 
say that adoption of Shari\'a led to an increase in 
ethnic/religious conflict and 
confrontations between Muslims and Christians in the north 
over the past four 
years.  The Muslim majority in the north scored a political 
point with Shari\'a, 
and they press that point home at every opportunity.  End 
comment.) The events 
of September 11, 2001, further heightened Nigeria\'s 
visibility, along with other 
west African countries, as a majority Muslim country and a 
possible breeding 
ground for Islamist fundamentalist terrorism. 
 
 
4. (U)  Questions of regional stability prompted 
investigation of whether Islam 
is on the rise and becoming more political in the country. 
When a Muslim woman 
(Amina Lawal) from the North was sentenced to death by 
stoning, several 
contestants in the Miss World Pageant that was to be held in 
Nigeria in 
November, 2002, protested by refusing to come to Nigeria. 
Shortly after the 
remaining contestants arrived, an article in a national 
newspaper that 
allegedly \"insulted\" the prophet Mohammed set off Muslim 
riots that left 200 
dead.  These events and the continuing ethnic/political 
conflicts in the North 
also raise unease about the possible upsurge in political 
Islam in the South. 
 
 
State of Islam in the South 
 
 
5. (C) PolOff met with the Secretary General of the 
Lagos-based Nigerian 
Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Dr. Lateef Adegbite. 
Adegbite said that 
there is no conflict between Muslims in the south and other 
religions here. 
Although he could not give even a rough estimate of the 
current number of 
Muslims in the south, he said that Islam is growing steadily 
in the region and 
the concern of the Muslim community is to fund and build 
enough schools 
(madrassas) for increasing numbers of Muslim children. 
According to Adegbite, 
there is no pressure to adopt Shari\'a in the south, and the 
uproar over the 
Lawal case will be resolved peacefully by the courts. 
Adegbite\'s views on 
other possible areas of religious friction are conservative 
and track the views 
of other Muslim sources.  He told us that many Muslims, in 
Nigeria and 
worldwide, were convinced the War on Terrorism is a war 
against Muslims, and he 
added the familiar charge that the US has a \"double standard\" 
when dealing with 
the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.  Nigeria\'s 
Supreme Council 
has no authority to appoint or remove Muslim clergy, nor to 
review or 
standardize the Friday mosque sermons, unlike many other 
majority Muslim 
countries.  As a consequence, Adegbite said he has no way to 
determine if an 
individual mosque, or southern mosques in general, are 
becoming politicized, 
but he doubts this could be the case. 
 
 
6. (C) PolSpecs from Abuja and Lagos spent several days in 
January interviewing 
key members of the Muslim communities in Lagos, Ibadan and 
other towns in the 
southwest about their views on the status of Islam in the 
region.  (Comment. 
All observers agree that Muslims do not make up a significant 
percentage of the 
population in the southeast or south-central regions.  Thus, 
the PolSpecs 
concentrated their efforts in the southwest.  End comment.) 
After a number of 
interviews, they reached the general conclusion that religion 
is not a major 
factor in the political calculations of residents and 
politicians in the 
southwest.  However, they reported that many of their 
interlocutors were also 
quick to point out that Islam is growing in the region, 
Muslims are being more 
assertive and, thus, religion could at some point in the 
future become a 
political issue.  Some Muslims reported seeing signs now, 
such as growing 
religious intolerance and exclusion based on religion, that 
may be the 
precursors of future religious strife and disruptions of 
government. 
 
 
A scholar\'s view 
 
 
7. (C)  In Ibadan, PolSpecs met with Ahmeed Agberemi, a 
highly respected 
Islamic scholar.  Agberemi told them that Muslims object to 
the use of the word 
\"fundamentalist\" when discussing Islam, and disagree with 
most Westerners\' 
definition of the term.  \"What we should be concerned about,\" 
he declared, \"is 
rising \'essentialism\' in all the major religions.\"  He 
explained that 
essentialism, often mistaken for fundamentalism, has an 
overarching presence 
within and across national boundaries, and has the potential 
to influence 
socio-political outcomes, not only in Nigeria, but globally 
as well.  Agberemi 
said he does not believe that fundamentalism is, as yet, a 
problem in the 
southwest, nor does he think that the region\'s politics are 
currently 
influenced in any way by religion.  \"Unlike in the north,\" he 
said, \"where 
there are extreme forms of Islam, the 50-50 Christian to 
Muslim demographic 
split in most southwestern States precludes the possibility 
of the ascendance 
to power by Islamists of whatever persuasion.\"  On the 
subject of Shari\'a, 
Agberemi said the likelihood of southwestern States\' enacting 
Shari\'a law was 
extremely remote.  He was more concerned, however, with what 
he said is a 
growing use of inciting rhetoric in speeches by Muslim 
leaders and in the 
mosques sermons.  He concluded, saying that the recent 
debates and discussions 
in Nigeria about identity, ethnicity and the role of religion 
in government, 
are \"notions that merely inhibit pluralities of ideas while 
justifying 
exclusion, hatred and violence.\" 
 
 
A Muslim woman\'s view 
 
 
8. (C) PolSpecs also met with Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, 
Executive Director of the 
Lagos-based Center for Women Advocates, Research and 
Documentation. 
Akiyode-Afolabi is also a noted supporter of and campaigner 
for Muslim women\'s 
rights.  Although she generally agreed with the thoughts of 
Agberimi, she 
warned that a failing economy and massive poverty could drive 
Nigerians \"to the 
point where they seek social justice through politicized 
religion.\"  She said 
some Muslim politicians in the past had tried to get 
co-religionists\' votes by 
passing out food and oney.  She predicted that this might 
again be the 
situation in the upcoming elections because of the alarming 
rate of poverty. 
As to real politicized Islam, that is, Muslims voting for 
Muslims only because 
of their religion, or Muslims voting for Muslims in the hope 
of influencing 
government with Islamic tenets, Akiyode-Afolabi said she had 
not seen this in 
the southwest--yet. 
 
 
A politician\'s view 
 
 
9. (C)  In a private conversation with Ambassador and CG 
(septel), Lagos State 
Governor Bola Tinubu, himself a Muslim, concurred that Islam 
is not politicized 
in the south.  Tinubu opined that in the southeast and 
southwest, religion is 
less important to voters than a candidate\'s political record 
or personality. 
 
 
10. (C) Comment.  Based on our interviews and the opinions of 
political 
observers in the southwest, we conclude that Islam and the 
possibility of 
Shari\'a law are not political concerns for the near-term in 
southwestern 
Nigeria.  Islam in the southwest is relatively new, compared 
to that in the 
north, and may be too young to flex its muscles here.  Even 
growing Muslim 
activities in the region, especially the sudden emergence and 
fast growth of 
\"Nasfat\" groups (Muslim youth organizations)  in Lagos and 
other parts of the 
southwest, do not appear to be an indication of the 
politicization of Islam; 
instead these activities are an effort by Muslim elite to 
turn Muslim youth 
from the seduction of a robust Pentecostal movement by making 
Muslim ritual 
more \"Christian-like.\"  For the long-term, however, all of 
our sources agree 
that if socio-economic conditions do not improve, there is a 
reasonable 
possibility of a future politicization of Islam in both 
northern and southern 
Nigeria.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PETROLEUM INDUSTRY REGULATORY BODY 
EMPLOYEES PLAN STRIKE ON FEBRUARY 14 
 
 
 1.(U)  After issuing a 14-day ultimatum on February 1, 2003 
to the GON, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff 
Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) announced plans for a 
nationwide strike beginning February 14 by its members within 
the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Nigeria\'s oil 
and gas industry regulatory body.  According to PENGASSAN, 
the strike was called in response to the GON\'s refusal to 
allow the DPR to operate as an autonomous agency.  The strike 
by the PENGASSAN DPR employees is scheduled to begin 
off-shore and may take on a wider dimension if demands are 
not met within the first few days. 
 
 
2.(U)  DPR is responsible for reviewing oil licenses, 
measuring volume and maintaining quality control, and 
authorizing crude oil exports.  Since 1991, DPR employees 
have rejected efforts by the GON to integrate the department 
into the federal government because DPR salaries are higher 
and benefits are better than those of federal workers.  Four 
years ago, the National Assembly approved a bill to ensure 
DPR\'s autonomy; however, the Obasanjo administration has not 
approved the bill. 
 
 
3.(U) Econoff spoke with Mac A. Ofurhie, Director, Petroleum 
Resources at DPR on February 13 who stated that the parties 
\"are trying to sort everything out in dialogue\" to avert a 
strike.  Despite the role of DPR in authorizing crude oil 
exports, Ofurhie said there will be no problem with product 
movement and that \"we do not have to worry.\" 
 
 
4.(C) LabOff contacted U.S. oil company managing directors to 
discus the reports of a pending strike.  They were unawre 
of it.  One executive opined that a strike woud have no 
short-term effect on production since ost storage tank are 
currently empty; the compaies can continue to extract oil 
for at least tendays before reaching storage capacity.  He 
addedthat as companies move closer to storage capacity, he 
GON will likely intervene to authorize crude oil exports by 
Nigeria. He warned the USG to be cautious in its discussions 
with PENGASSAN and the DPR because they may use U.S. concerns 
as leverage to intensify their industrial action.  Our source 
added that although it is unlikely that the PENGASSAN 
representatives working within the oil companies will join 
the strike, they plan to meet this Friday to assess the level 
of their interests that might be involved in the DPR dispute. 
 
 
5.(C)  Comment. Officials of the National Union of Petroleum 
and Natural Gas Employees (NUPENG) have told us that it has 
no plans to get involved in the proposed strike. While 
PENGASSAN endorses the idea of a strike, except for the small 
group of DPR employees, the other members of PENGASSAN have 
no plans to strike. Although the oil companies we contacted 
believe the dispute will not affect production in the 
short-term, a \"worse case scenario\" involving a prolonged 
work stoppage could slow the movement of Nigeria\'s crude oil 
exports. End comment.

1.  On Saturday, February 15, employees from the Department 
of Petroleum Resources (DPR) went on strike to contest 
unpaid salaries and benefits and protest the GON\'s refusal 
to grant DPR autonomy.  DPR is the agency that supervises 
tanker loadings and authorizes movement of crude oil at 
Nigeria\'s eight oil exports terminals. Sina Luwoye, 
President of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff 
Association of Nigeria sent a letter to DPR management over 
the weekend warning that if demands are not met by Tuesday, 
February 18, PENGASSAN would order all of its members to 
join the strike. Post contacted PENGASSAN\'s Deputy General 
Secretary Bayo Olowosile this morning.  He confirmed 
 
SIPDIS 
Luwoye\'s warning, however, he added that PENGASSAN\'s 
Executive Council must make the final decision regarding an 
association-wide national strike. 
2.  A DPR Spokeswoman told journalists over the weekend that 
the GON has unfolded a contingency plan to counter the 
strike.  She said DPR plans to send its management staff to 
depots, terminals and jetties to ensure that operations are 
not disrupted.  Replacement staff will be used to sustain 
operations at five export terminals operated by Exxon Mobil, 
ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell, Italy\'s Agip, and CVX 
Research.  Econoff spoke with a US oil representative this 
morning, who reported that as of now, it is unclear what 
impact this strike will have on exports.  If DPR managers 
actually deploy in the field \"with the keys to the valves,\" 
as reported, the impact may be minimal.  Even if DPR 
managers cannot keep oil moving out to tankers at current 
rates, crude will likely continue to be lifted, processed 
and sent to each company\'s onshore storage facilities under 
normal routine.  The representative stated his company 
usually loads two tankers per week for export, and if any 
one company has difficulties loading, others will likely be 
given the opportunity to increase their share of outbound 
production.  Exports will likely be affected if striking 
workers can create a uniform impact at all export facilities 
simultaneously.  The representative also noted that world 
oil prices may be affected simply by news of the strike, 
which has been covered by CNN and the New York Times, even 
if export production from Nigeria is not actually 
diminished. 
3.  Comment: The strike has already created crowds at local 
gas stations amid public concerns of a possible fuel 
shortage.  Several gas stations in Abuja are also limiting 
the sale of fuel to the public due to fears of confrontation 
with PENGASSAN.  If PENGASSAN orders a nationwide work 
stoppage, the other oil and gas union, the National Union of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) will probably 
offer passive support.  Under an existing pact between 
NUPENG and PENGASSAN, a single body called NUPENGASSAN was 
established to promote greater cooperation between the two 
unions, particularly in disputes involving industrial 
action.  Although NUPENG has not issued a statement on the 
matter, a joint NUPENG-PENGASSAN strike is possible but 
unlikely.  Regardless of what NUPENG decides, since the work 
performed by union members from both sides is interrelated, 
a prolonged PENGASSAN strike will significantly diminish 
overall productivity.  We will know by tomorrow whether the 
DPR strike will spread to the industry at large.

1.  (S)  Summary:  CG, LEGATT, and RSO met with Johan Bakker, 
Vice President of Haliburton Nigeria on 02/18/03.  Mr. Bakker 
advised the CG that a radioactive source used in logging 
operations was missing.  Mr. Bakker advised that the material 
was approximately 18.5 curries in strength and had been 
missing since late November or early December.  Haliburton 
and Chevrontexaco corporate investigators had been conducting 
investigations, but they had not been able to determine who 
took the material, exactly when or where it was taken.  In 
view of the current world situation, Haliburton was notifying 
the Consulate. End Summary. 
 
 
2.  (S)  CG, LEGATT, and RSO met with Johan Bakker, Vice 
President of Haliburton Nigeria concerning missing 
radioactive material.  The material was described as 
approximately four to five inches in length and one to one 
and a half inches in diameter with a strength of 18.5 
curries.  The radioactive material is used in the oil 
industry for logging operations.  The material was placed in 
a \"pig\", a cylinder approximately eighteen inches in diameter 
and weighing ninety-four kilograms.  The \"pig\" was then 
placed in a box with radioactive markings on the side. 
 
 
3.  (S)  The radioactive material had been used in oilfield 
operations at a  Chevrontexaco site and was supposed to be 
transported back to Haliburton\'s operational base.  The \"pig\" 
was stored at Escavros in late November and transported to 
Warri where it was picked up for transshipment to Port 
Harcourt on or about December 4th.  Although it is unclear 
when the material was taken, the driver reportedly claimed to 
a Haliburton investigator that the locks on the box 
containing the \"pig\" were broken when the box was picked up 
and placed on a flatbed truck for shipment.  No other items 
on the flatbed were taken or disturbed during the trip. 
 
 
4.  (S)  The flatbed stopped overnight in a village during 
the transit from Warri to Port Harcourt.  Investigators, who 
have tried to interview local villagers, have been 
unsuccessful.  Initially, Haliburton officials believed the 
material may have been taken for ransom, but no demands have 
been made.  It is also believed that someone who may not know 
what the material is may have thrown it away.  There is 
concern that anyone who handled the material for any length 
of time may have died or is critically ill.  A one meter 
exposure for sixty-eight minutes is considered lethal 
according to Mr. Bakker. 
 
 
5.  (S)  Nigerian federal, state, and local authorities have 
been notified of the missing radioactive material and the 
IAEA has been contacted.  Nigerian police are continuing 
their investigation.  Haliburton and Chevrontexaco brought in 
investigators from London who have assisted with their 
continuing investigations as well.  Local populations have 
been offered a fifty thousand Naira (approximately 400 USD) 
reward for information leading to the return of the material. 
 To date, only two attempts have been made to collect the 
reward and neither was considered credible. 
 
 
6.  (S)  A report of Haliburton\'s attempts to recover the 
material along with photos of the neutron pig and shipping 
container has been forwarded to FBIHQ and will be forwarded 
to the Department.

REF: (A) LAGOS 332, (B) LAGOS 344 
 
 
1.  (U) As part of a solidarity agreement between the two 
major oil workers\' unions, members of the Department of 
Petroleum Resources (DPR) branch of the National Union of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) joined a strike 
organized by DPR members of the Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN).  Despite 
the walkout by approximately 600 NUPENG members employed by 
DPR, NUPENG General Secretary Joseph Akinlaja said there are 
no plans to call for a union-wide national strike, adding 
that NUPENG is \"not interested in punishing people over 
government negligence.\" 
 
 
2.  (U) Two separate meetings were held on Wednesday, 
February 19, to discuss issues involving unpaid salaries and 
DPR autonomy.  In Lagos, DPR Director Macaulay Ofurhie met 
with workers and promised to pay all wages and allowances 
outstanding before the end of February.  However, 
discussions in Abuja between PENGASSAN and GON officials 
regarding DPR autonomy remain deadlocked.  NUPENG will join 
the discussions when talks resume on Thursday, February 20. 
Labor and Productivity Minister, Alhaji Musa Gwadabe, and 
Special Presidential Advisor on Petroleum, Alhaji Rilwanu 
Lukman, will head the GON delegation at Thursday\'s meeting. 
 
 
3.  (U) PENGASSAN insists that the strike will continue 
until the National Assembly moves forward with legislation 
granting autonomy to DPR. If Thursday\'s talks fail, hope of 
an early resolution could rest on Friday\'s meeting between 
PENGASSAN and the Petroleum and Energy Committee of the 
National Assembly. General Secretary of PENGASSAN, Kenneth 
Narebor, told journalists yesterday that Friday\'s meeting 
will determine future action.  He said the union \"cannot 
just call off the strike without any meaningful achievement, 
because we are not ready to embark on the process again\". 
Narebor said PENGASSAN has decided to suspend further 
actions \"that will escalate the already tensed situation 
until Friday\'s meeting with the National Assembly Committee 
on Energy.\" 
 
 
4.   (U) Comment:  Although the GON will probably fall short 
on PENGASSAN\'s demands, the National Assembly will probably 
accelerate its review of DPR\'s demand for autonomy.  DPR\'s 
promise to pay outstanding salaries and a \"good faith\" 
effort by the National Assembly to consider autonomy could 
end the work stoppage. However, PENGASSAN\'s reluctance to 
request that its entire membership join in a sympathy strike 
despite an expired 72-hour ultimatum, demonstrates the 
union\'s reported efforts to resolve the dispute without 
creating a major industry-wide crisis.  U.S. oil companies 
have reported no reduction in operations stemming from the 
strike.  One source said his company has met all scheduled 
loadings for its crude oil exports since the beginning of 
the DPR walkout, and a relatively small-volume operator also 
reports no disruption in processing whatsoever. End Comment.

confident that most of his co-religionists share this view. 
Tinubu pledged to work closely with the legislators who will 
be elected or re-elected to the National Assembly to secure 
passage of a customs bill, inaction on which has prevented 
Nigeria from benefiting from AGOA.  Tinubu disclosed 
antipathy for President Obasanjo, but praised Vice President 
Atiku Abubakar, whom he has known for many years.  End 
summary. 
 
 
2. (C) During a luncheon for visiting DAS Pamela Bridgewater 
February 16, Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu assured 
the DAS and accompanying ConGen that his office will do all 
it can to ensure protection of the Consulate in the event of 
war with Iraq. Tinubu added that he has asked the Lagos State 
Assembly to issue a resolution declaring that no new 
construction be permitted along \"Embassy Row\" on Victoria 
Island. With a view to the longer term, he will seek the 
Assembly\'s approval to designate the Walter Carrington 
Crescent a diplomatic zone.  Such action would help ensure 
the safety and security of diplomatic missions remaining in 
Lagos. 
 
 
3. (C) Tinubu expressed concern about Al Queda\'s nominal 
designation of Nigeria among the countries that need to be 
liberated from the grasp of American imperialism. Tinubu 
asserted that the vast majority of his fellow Muslims are 
neither sympathetic to Baghdad nor extremist Muslims. 
Nigeria\'s moderate Muslims have great sympathy for the 
United States, he said, and they know that the issue between 
Iraq and the United Nations relates to weapons of mass 
destruction, not Islam.  The Governor said Al Queda\'s 
message was meant for agitators who might jeopardize 
Nigeria\'s unity and development. 
 
 
4. (C) Regarding security in Nigeria, Tinubu said he expects 
that even if war breaks out few people will be incited to 
hold pro-Iraq or anti-US demonstrations in the southern 
states, particularly Osun, Oyo and Lagos.  He said the 
politicians do not want international politics to detract 
from their mobilization efforts for the spring elections. 
Tinubu (himself a Muslim) has been meeting with Muslim 
leaders who will not support anti-US activities.  He promised 
that any agitators would be \"checkmated\".  The situation is 
different in northern Nigeria, he said, where it is 
politically expedient for moderate politicians to support 
Sharia.  He expects violent demonstrations specifically in 
Kano, Kaduna and Jos. 
 
 
5. (C) Tinubu senses that the United States has not 
maintained the momentum in its positive engagement of Islam 
that it had shown shortly after September 11, 2001. Lately, 
US media outlets have not shown enough concern for Muslims in 
the coverage of the impending conflict with Iraq.  US 
coverage of the issue has been too intellectual when it is 
very emotional in the Muslim world.   This fact has given 
Iraq a propaganda edge over the US.  Tinubu perceives that 
the USG has not done a very good job explaining its cause to 
the Muslim world either.  Most Muslims, he said, believe 
President Bush is \"simply finishing his father\'s business.\" 
 Even Tinubu, a staunch US supporter, doubts the validity of 
the US argument. 
 
 
6. (C) Turning to the presidential contest, Tinubu disclosed 
that he does not like President Obasanjo because he 
contributed to the end of democracy in Nigeria during his 
tenure as a military president and is now benefiting from 
that history.  That said, Tinubu admitted that he and his 
party, the Alliance for Democracy, must support Obasanjo. 
Southwest Nigeria is Yoruba land and the President is Yoruba. 
Tinubu\"s party had no choice since it has not fielded a 
presidential candidate.  Moreover, Obasanjo is the only 
candidate who stands a chance of blocking his rival, General 
Muhammadu Buhari, whose ethnocentrism would jeopardize 
Nigeria\"s national unity.  Buhari and his ilk are agents of 
destabilization who would be far worse than Obasanjo. Tinubu 
and many other governors are therefore implementing a 
strategy to re-elect Obasanjo, partly in an effort to prevent 
Sharia from spreading. Tinubu predicted that the President 
will follow his own course, if re-elected, since he will not 
need as many friends the second time around. 
 
 
7. (C) Tinubu praised Vice President Atiku Abubakar, whom he 
has known for many years. Tinubu warned that former military 
strongman Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida and National Security 
Advisor Aliyu Mohamed will try to discredit Atiku. That 
effort will fail, Tinubu predicted, because Atiku has the 
support of the governors and the National Assembly. 
Elaborating on his knowledge of the VP, Tinubu said he has 
known and understood the VP even before his entry into 
politics. Atiku is a detribalized politician who knows where 
he is going and how to build bridges to get there. Tinubu 
expects Atiku will play a larger role in the next 
presidential administration, especially in economic affairs, 
while Obasasanjo will concentrate on external relations. 
Atiku may also assume responsibility for other domestic 
portfolios in the next administration. 
 
 
8. (C) Tinubu bemoaned the fact that Nigeria is not 
benefiting from the textile provisions of the Africa Growth 
and Opportunity Act, and claimed partial responsibility for 
this situation.  He said he had not pressed his fellow 
governors to exert pressure on the national legislators for 
enactment of a customs bill mandating country-of-origin 
certification of inputs that might go into Nigerian textile 
exports to the United States.  Since Lagos State 
manufacturers could benefit substantially from the AGOA 
textile provisions, Tinubu plans to press for quick passage 
of the customs bill.  He believes the next legislature will 
passed it soon after it convenes in late spring 2003. 
 
 
9. (C) Bio comment.  Tinubu is direct, articulate, and a 
sharp analyst who understands accommodation.  He acknowledges 
the imperative of political compromise in the game for power, 
even with political actors whom he might be inclined to 
denigrate. Tinubu credits his going into politics to Atiku\'s 
personal encouragement.  Tinubu\'s admiration of Atiku 
suggests that the Governor could be persuaded to play a 
national role in an Atiku administration if the VP were 
elected president four years hence.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENERGY UPDATE, FEB 20 
 
 
1. (U) This periodic update covering energy issues includes: 
--Oil Strike Suspended, No Effect on Exports 
--Wellhead Blows in Ogoniland 
--Local Content Rule Gives U.S. Firms Opportunity and Risk 
--Gas Developments, and 
--Almost Never Ever Power Anywhere 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
OIL STRIKE SUSPENDED, NO EFFECT ON EXPORTS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) The strike by Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) 
employees has been suspended before reaching a full week. 
Oil producers reprted no effect on production.  DPR efforts 
at placing managers in the field to conduct the inspection 
and gatekeeper functions of DPR appear to have kept all 
lifting and exporting processes on track.  Meetings between 
the various oil industry unions and government and 
legislative officials apparently resolved the strike, at 
least temporarily, which DPR called in response to 
outstanding salary payments and its assertion that DPR must 
be granted autonomy from GON influence.  Reports indicate 
that the GON agreed to immediately pay salary and allowance 
arrears and to continue talks to develop a mechanism to give 
DPR more autonomy. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
WELLHEAD BLOWS IN SOUTH SOUTH 
----------------------------- 
 
 
3. (U) On Monday, February 17, a Shell Oil Company wellhead 
ruptured in the Ogoni region of Rivers State east of Port 
Harcourt.  Shell no longer extractsoil from Ogoniland, but 
maintains old wells and  pipeline in the area.  A news 
story the following Friday reported a major blowout with 
significant spillage and potential environmental damage, but 
a Shell representative had informed Post earlier in the week 
that the situation was under control and spillage minimal. 
 
 
4. (U) Shell reported that a young man tampered with the 
device known as a Christmas tree attached to the wellhead 
and broke open a valve.  This caused a tremendous release of 
gas pressure and noise, frightening the man who ran from the 
site, but also alerting nearby townspeople who apprehended 
him and turned him over to police.  Shell reported that 
because of the high gas content of crude in that region, the 
resulting spill was not as serious as past incidents, 
including a 2001 blowout in the same Yorla field, which 
raised tension between Shell and the Ogoni people.  Shell 
reported that a joint investigative team from the company 
and state and federal governments was on-site by Thursday 
and considered the spill manageable.  Other sources, 
including the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People 
(MOSOP), confirmed that the incident appeared contained and 
that local residents had cooperated in Shell\'s efforts. 
 
 
5. (U) COMMENT: In previous oilfield incidents in Ogoniland 
and elsewhere, local residents sometimes had tried to 
extract cash payments from oil companies in exchange for 
access to a damaged facility or spill site.  This practice 
raised tensions in the Niger Delta region as oil companies 
and workers were often unwilling to respond immediately to a 
reported crisis, which, the companies claimed, were often 
acts of sabotage to undermine production and extract a 
ransom.  This time, Shell and local residents cooperated, a 
positive sign in the often-troubled region. END COMMENT. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
LOCAL CONTENT RULE GIVES U.S. FIRMS OPPORTUNITY AND RISK 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
 
6. (U) Chevron Nigeria Ltd. recently brought representatives 
from ten companies, most of which are U.S.-based, to Nigeria 
to explore business opportunities in its supply chain. 
Representatives from companies including G.E., Solar 
Turbines, and Universal Compression were shown fabrication 
facilities in Lagos, Warri, and Onne in order to provide 
them a realistic understanding of what it would take to 
establish operations in Nigeria. Chevron hosted its 
preferred suppliers in Nigeria to instruct them on the needs 
of the company in meeting its local content obligations, and 
on the challenges they would face in establishing operations 
here.  For the most part each company would have to set up a 
joint venture or locally-owned business to supply Chevron, 
and would face the infrastructure and security challenges 
Nigeria poses.  Regardless of the companies\' interest or 
capacity to establish operations in Nigeria, Chevron is 
committed to meeting its local content target. Chevron has a 
joint venture agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) that obligates it to comply with a GON 
target of having 40 percent local content in its projects by 
2004. 
 
 
7. (U) A manager in Chevron\'s supply chain division told 
Econoff that while the visiting companies did not signal an 
immediate interest in establishing Nigerian operations, they 
did seem to take away what Chevron intended to demonstrate; 
that is, while the oil producer is obligated to use local 
content, it would prefer to continue using its known 
suppliers, but the challenges of establishing business 
operations in Nigeria are significant.  The companies 
invited to Nigeria were those suppliers with which Chevron 
does the largest volume of business worldwide, and from 
which Chevron can demand a price advantage.  The manager 
indicated this strategy will be used later in the year in 
Angola since the company faces local content requirements 
from developing countries around the globe and is dealing 
with them in a similar fashion. 
 
 
8. (U) COMMENT: GON local content requirements raise issues 
with respect to Nigeria\'s compliance with the WTO Agreement 
on Trade-Related Investment Measures, but the immediate goal 
of providing opportunities to domestic companies likely is a 
higher priority for the GON than is paying close attention 
to its international trade obligations.  The willingness of 
companies like ChevronTexaco to not only acquiesce in local 
content rules but also expend resources to convince their 
international suppliers to work within those parameters may 
make it harder for the USG to press for compliance with WTO 
and other trade agreements that these major oil companies 
believe provide no scaleable economic advantage.  If the oil 
majors can help establish workable Nigerian-based business 
entities, it is possible that small American firms or firms 
not having established business ties to the major oil 
producers in Nigeria may not be able to compete fairly for 
future contracts under GON rules or practices.  Should that 
come about, the direct economic power of the big oil 
companies may overshadow USG advocacy efforts and undermine 
trade negotiations.  END COMMENT. 
 
 
---------------- 
GAS DEVELOPMENTS 
---------------- 
 
 
9. (U) The economic promise of Nigeria\'s natural gas 
reserves continues to grow as several projects move into new 
phases.  ChevronTexaco recently announced the discovery of 
new gas reserves in the OPL 218 field it controls jointly 
with Norwegian oil producer Statoil offshore of Rivers. 
ChevronTexaco and Shell Oil, owner of the nearby OPL 219 
block, previously signed an MOU for a feasibility study for 
a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) platform to develop 
these fields, and the discovery of deepwater gas in OPL 218 
increases the viability of an FLNG project. 
 
 
10. (U) Several West African countries have signed an 
agreement to bring the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) 
closer to reality.  Representatives from Nigeria, Benin, 
Togo and Ghana signed a treaty at the West African Summit in 
Dakar, Senegal, to establish a legal and fiscal framework 
for the project.  To that end, the West African Gas 
Administration will be established to oversee the WAGP from 
its headquarters in Accra, Ghana.  Jay Pryor, Managing 
Director of ChevronTexaco Nigeria, was quoted in press 
accounts as lauding the agreement as an important step for 
establishing conditions necessary for future direct foreign 
investment in the region. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
ALMOST NEVER EVER POWER ANYWHERE 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
11. (U) The National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) 
continues to be plagued by power distribution problems. 
Recent reports indicate that slow progress on repairs to gas 
supply lines to NEPA generators is hampering power supply, 
causing increasingly frequent power outages, particularly in 
the Lagos zone.  One NEPA manager was quoted in the Vanguard 
Newspaper as disclosing that while  daily demand for power 
in the Lagos metropolitan area is 1200 megawatts (MW), NEPA 
has been averaging 800MW of production during  the last 
month. 
 
 
12. (U) COMMENT: Power outages and severe fluctuations in 
current and voltage are becoming ever more frequent 
throughout Nigeria.  As the weather continues to grow 
warmer, the rumble of backup generators will become nearly 
constant in wealthy neighborhoods, while darkness will 
settle over poorer areas.  Until Nigeria can provide a 
stable, affordable source of power, it will not attract the 
kind of industrial investment it requires to diversify its 
economy.  Even corporate giants like ChevronTexaco might not 
lure their suppliers to Nigeria if fabricating firms cannot 
keep their machines running. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OUTREACH TO NCEMA AND NISER 
 
1.  Introduction and summary.  Staff of ConGen\'s Economic 
Office reached out to two institutions of learning in the 
city of Ibadan in Oyo State on February 25. This former 
capital of Nigeria\'s old Western State is notable for 
several research institutions including the University of 
Ibadan, the premier institution of higher learning in 
Nigeria. This report focuses on two key centers of learning, 
the National Center For Economic Management and 
Administration (NCEMA), and the Nigerian Institute of Social 
and Economic Research (NISER.) International donors who 
appreciate their activities should be able to work with 
these institutions to leverage their own resources as they 
seek to help Nigerians in the public and private sectors. 
End introduction and summary. 
 
 
------------------------------------------- 
The Nigerian Center for Economic Management 
and Administration 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. NCEMA,the younger of the two Nigerian institutions, was 
established by the federal government in 1986.  The center 
provides training to federal government officials who 
formulate economic policies. Federal staff come from the 
Central Bank of Nigeria, the Budget office in the Federal 
Minister of Finance, and the National Planning Commission. 
State civil servants also participate in these programs. 
 
 
------------------------- 
NCEMA\'s Research Approach 
------------------------- 
 
 
3.  NCEMA approaches problem solving through policy 
research.  Professor Mike Obadan, the Director General of 
NCEMA, said the Center\'s products are results oriented. 
NCEMA\'s faculty comprises 22 researchers who also serve as 
consultants to other institutions.  The Center runs seminars 
and symposiums annually.  Among the former is an annual 
federal budget seminar. Faculty members and other solicited 
public officials often make presentations on topics of their 
choice. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
Efforts at Capacity Building 
for GON Officials 
---------------------------- 
 
 
4.  NCEMA organizes budget workshops for the staff of the 
National Assembly and the Assembly members too.  NCEMA aims 
to enhance their understanding of the budget process and its 
implementation, to enable them contribute informed input or 
amendments to the federal budget before its approval. The 
Center is conducting a survey of corruption and governance 
as well. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Relationship with International Agencies 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
5.  The World Bank collaborates with NCEMA on several 
aspects of economic management and capacity building.  NCEMA 
provides a training ground for Bank projects on capacity 
building. Obadan said the Center formerly was linked with 
the University of Bradford in the United Kingdom. NCEMA is 
looking for opportunities to establish links with American 
institutions. Professor Obadan expressed interest in 
establishing a closer relationship with USAID. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
The Nigerian Institute of 
Social and Economic Research 
---------------------------- 
 
 
6.   NISER was established in 1950 during British rule in 
Nigeria. The institute was then called WAISER (West African 
Institute of Social and Economic Research) and focused its 
research on the socioeconomic needs of the West African 
countries under British rule.  At independence, the former 
British colonies went their own way.  NISER was transformed 
into an institute at the Nigeria\'s premier university, the 
University of Ibadan. By 1977, NISER\'s \"six-and-a-half\" 
research departments had become semi-autonomous. NISER\'s 
researchers cover agriculture and rural development, 
economic development, human resources development, physical 
development, social development, technology policy and 
development, and political development. What NISER staff 
call its \"half\" department is the Center for African 
Resources, a department with ad hoc staff pulled from 
NISER\'s different research units. NISER has 60 full-time 
professional researchers and its total staff numbers 400. 
 
 
----------------------- 
NISER Research Projects 
----------------------- 
7.  Professor Olu Ajakaiye, Director General of NISER, said 
NISER staff focus on four broad areas of activity. The first 
is individual research designed mainly to sharpen the skills 
of research staff. NISER\'s review of Nigerian developments 
and its futures research also keep research staff abreast of 
developments in the various spheres of Nigerian life. NISER 
staff conduct annual monitoring research during which 
NISER\'s research units audit their own performance.  Lastly, 
NISER provides consulting services to third parties. 
 
 
8. NISER\'s Director General expects its researchers to spend 
at least 50 percent of their time on research projects. 
NISER has a close relationship with some government 
agencies, such as the Central Bank of Nigeria, and is a 
think-tank to other government agencies. 
9. In collaboration with the World Bank, NISER hosted 
seminars and workshops and provided input to Nigeria\'s five- 
year development plans prior to Nigeria\'s implementation of 
the first structural adjustment program (SAP) in 1986. The 
SAP led to de-emphasis of long-range planning and emphasis 
on short-term policy management.  NISER has since been 
conducting research on Nigeria\'s social and economic 
development and on its prospects.  NISER\'s research 
documents often take the form of policy memoranda. 
 
 
--------------------- 
On-Going Relationship 
with Donor Agencies 
--------------------- 
 
 
10. NISER is working on the GON\'s poverty reduction strategy 
program (PRSP). NISER hopes its research will lead to its in- 
depth understanding of poverty so to make substantive input 
to the PRSP.  NISER is executing a USAID-funded project on 
legislative support to Nigerian states in collaboration with 
the Mississippi Consortium for International Development. 
Six states are benefiting from the program, which 
essentially involves capacity building. NISER is carrying 
out a corruption survey in collaboration with the Ahmadu 
Bello University in Zaria, which is also funded by USAID. 
And NISER is pursuing comparative research with Canada\'s 
International Development Research Center and its African 
affiliate, the Secretariat for International Support for 
Economic Research in Africa. 
 
 
11.  NISER has a clear vision of where it wants to go. It 
wants to augment capacity within Nigeria\'s civil service by 
being the instrument of choice for restructuring the service 
through short- and long-term training. 
 
 
12.  Comment.  NCEMA and NISER potentially can play 
important roles in shaping Nigeria\'s economic policies. 
These institutions boast faculty members well grounded in 
divers aspects of economic policy. The donors who appreciate 
their activities should be able to work with these 
institutions to leverage their own resources as they seek to 
help Nigerians in the public and private sectors.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ENERGY UPDATE, FEB 28 
 
REF: ABUJA 00048 
 
1. This periodic update covering energy issues 
includes: 
--Long Lines - Short on Answers; Fuel Crisis Continues 
--Obasanjo Offers Onshore/Offshore Compromise 
--Exxon-Mobil Produces Early from Yoho Fields, and 
--Marginal Oil Fields Awarded 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
LONG LINES - SHORT ON ANSWERS; FUEL CRISIS CONTINUES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. Just as the strike by workers of the Department of 
Petroleum Resources (DPR) was drawing to a close, 
Nigeria faced a new challenge in its energy sector; 
failed deliveries of finished petroleum caused serious 
fuel shortages throughout Nigeria last week, closing 
gas stations and forcing consumers to queue in lines 
not seen in years.  In cities across Nigeria, lines 
snaked up to two miles from filling stations open only 
a few hours a day, and in some instances cars were 
simply left idle in place, adding to already chaotic 
traffic situations.  Those consumers who were able to 
top off their tanks faced hiked prices by pump 
attendants or roadside black marketers, and those who 
used public transport paid higher fares when they 
managed to find their way onto a running vehicle.  Area 
boys took advantage of the captive audiences, extorting 
money from motorists and passersby by intimidation and 
force. 
 
3. Original theories that the DPR strike was the root 
of the gas lines gave way to the reality that Nigeria 
was simply running out of fuel.  Nigeria imports nearly 
half of the refined petroleum products it consumes, and 
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 
revealed that, in the wake of rising world petroleum 
prices caused by the growing tension over Iraq and the 
ongoing troubles in Venezuela, its suppliers redirected 
January and February shipments to more lucrative sales 
to the US and Venezuela.  NNPC received just 30 percent 
of its contracted cargo in January, driving its fuel 
stock down from a 20-day reserve to an 11-day reserve 
by February 24.  It is reported that NNPC has changed 
its import pricing formula to better reflect market 
trends, which will add a 10 to 20 percent premium to 
Nigeria\'s import costs. 
 
4. To combat the shortages, NNPC ordered its second and 
third quarter shipments for delivery at the same time. 
The government also hopes to have its two refineries at 
Port Harcourt, which have been offline due to power 
problems and maintenance, running again soon. In the 
short term, two ships recently off-loaded 56 million 
liters of gasoline, but this may offer only a very 
brief reprieve as the daily national demand runs from 
18 to 25 million liters.  Further, an Exxon-Mobil 
official told Econoff that the sorry state of tanker 
facilities in Lagos will slow all off-loading, so that 
even when ships come in, fuel will not flow quickly to 
consumers.  The situation did improve over the weekend, 
as gas lines receded and filling stations were 
returning to normal business hours this week.  However, 
spot reports of new queues are coming in again as the 
week goes on. 
 
5. Comment: The irony that the world\'s seventh largest 
crude oil exporter must import half of its refined 
petroleum products has not been lost on commentators 
and consumers alike. A fuel crisis reminding Nigerians 
of bygone days of military rule and of the fragile 
state of their economy comes at a terrible time for 
President Obasanjo, less than two months before the 
national election.  With each new incident of ethnic 
violence, tensions are certain to rise if an ongoing 
fuel shortages continue to hamper the daily routine of 
business and personal lives.  Suggesting the gravity of 
the government\'s concern over the situation, 
Information Minister Jerry Gana publicly blamed the gas 
lines on a smear campaign by Obasanjo opponents, and 
radio news reports quoted Obasanjo as saying there is 
no fuel shortage, but rather, people are simply 
hoarding gasoline. Fuel shortages will continue should 
Nigeria fail to make market-competitive purchase offers 
for gasoline as US demand for it rises on the eve of 
possible conflict in Iraq and the upcoming summer 
driving season. 
 
6. Comment continued: One positive outcome of this fuel 
shortage may be renewed interest in deregulating and 
commercializing Nigeria\'s downstream petroleum sector. 
John Pototsky, Managing Director of Mobil Oil Nigeria 
(MON), was recently quoted as saying that while MON 
enjoyed higher sales volume in 2002, its profits were 
very low due to the GON\'s pricing scheme.  As recently 
as 2000 and 2001, downstream marketers imported 
gasoline since the world market price and the domestic 
retail pump price were aligned closely enough for the 
companies to manage small but notable profits.  More 
recently, world market prices have far exceeded those 
that the retailers are allowed to charge at the pump, 
so the NNPC has essentially become the sole importer of 
gasoline. The downstream international operators import 
gasoline for the NNPC at world market prices, fuel that 
the NNPC sells at artificially low prices. Obasanjo\'s 
energy adviser, Rilwanu Lukman, was quoted as saying 
the system cannot be maintained at current prices owing 
to the large government subsidies it entails. A 
\"BusinessDay\" editorial called for a shift to free 
market mechanisms, including invitations to foreign 
companies to purchase and maintain existing refineries, 
pipelines and depots. End comment. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
OBASANJO OFFERS ONSHORE/OFFSHORE COMPROMISE 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7. President Obasanjo offered a compromise in the 
ongoing legislative battle over the allocation of oil 
revenue between the federal government and those states 
from which oil is extracted (reftel).  In a letter read 
to the Senate this week, Obasanjo calls for abandoning 
the earlier proposals by him and the National Assembly 
for demarcating what production is onshore versus 
offshore for revenue sharing purposes.  Obasanjo had 
previously proposed that a 24-mile contiguous zone off 
the coastline should be used to determine which 
production sites are subject to the special derivation 
fund, from which oil producing states are entitled to a 
13 percent share of oil tax and royalties.  The 
National Assembly\'s formula would have extended the 
reach of the derivation fund to the Continental shelf 
and the Economic Zone.  Obasanjo now argues both plans 
have technical and political drawbacks, and instead, 
proposes that all production lying within 200 meters of 
water should be subject to the derivation fund. 
 
8. An Exxon-Mobil representative confirmed that all 
existing producing oil fields lie within a 200-meter 
depth zone, which is roughly equivalent to the edge of 
the Continental Shelf.  This proposal would then place 
all deepwater oil discoveries not yet producing outside 
the scope of the derivation fund and within the sole 
purview of the federated account, the funds of which 
are distributed on the basis of a complicated formula 
amongst the federal government and all states and local 
governments. 
 
9. Comment: The Exxon-Mobil representative noted that 
prior to last year\'s Supreme Court ruling defining 
onshore and offshore to the federal government\'s 
advantage, Akwa Ibom state received three billion Naira 
each month from the derivation fund, but was left with 
no revenue from that account as a result of the ruling. 
(The federal government has been providing the state 
600 million Naira per month in the intervening period, 
according to our industry source.) He estimates that 
Obasanjo\'s proposal will provide Akwa Ibom with the 
same revenue it previously enjoyed.  Thus, he 
anticipates the littoral states will support Obasanjo\'s 
new proposal, as is evidenced by public support voiced 
by the governor of Delta State.  If this measure is 
successful in the National Assembly, it could go a long 
way toward shoring up political support for Obasanjo in 
the South South; the leaders from the Northern states, 
however, are unlikely to easily accept any proposal 
conferring benefit to the South. End comment.

EXXON-MOBIL PRODUCES OIL EARLY FROM YOHO FIELDS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
10. Exxon-Mobil has begun production from its Yoho 
development project two years ahead of schedule, by 
using a temporary floating, production, storage and off- 
loading (FPSO)vessel as an early production system 
(ESP).  The Yoho project is a Mobil Producing Nigeria 
(MPN)and NNPC joint venture (JV), located in the 
relatively shallow waters of Oil Mining Lease(OML) 104. 
The $1.2 billion project has estimated recoverable 
resources of 0.4 billion barrels of oil, and represents 
the first deployment of an ESP in West Africa.  The 
Yoho JV will have a production capacity of 
approximately 650,000 barrels per day I(bpd), and while 
press reports indicate it is currently producing 90,000 
bpd, an Exxon-Mobil executive told Econoff it is 
already reaching or exceeding 100,000 bpd.

MARGINAL OIL FIELDS AWARDED 
--------------------------- 
 
11. After a sometimes contentious two-year process, the 
federal government this week announced 31 companies who 
have won licenses to operate 24 marginal oil fields in 
the Niger Delta.  The fields may hold up to 2.3 million 
barrels of crude oil, and are considered marginal 
because each produces no more than approximately 5,000 
bpd, which the major oil companies consider 
economically unviable for the scale of their 
operations.  The GON hoped to spur development of 
indigenous companies, greater domestic income and more 
local jobs through the sale of these marginal fields. 
It reviewed bids from 66 companies, including several 
state-owned firms.  Presidential energy adviser Lukman 
called on the winning firms to aggressively develop 
their operations, and implored the financial industry 
to assist these companies in raising capital.

 1.  (U) SUMMARY.  Marshall Harry\'s death on March 5 is the 
latest in a series of murders regarded by southern Nigerians 
as political assassinations.  Harry engendered bitter 
rivalries as a notorious power-player and strategist who 
aimed to shift power to South-south minorities, including 
Rivers State Governor Peter Odili.  (See also septel, 
\"HARRY\'S MURDER FLAMES PORT HARCOURT TENSIONS.\")  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
----------------------- 
A THORN IN ODILI\'S SIDE 
----------------------- 
 
 
2.  (C) Harry was among the most prominent elite of the 
Kalabari southern ethnic minority.  His outspoken criticism 
and political posturing for South-south ethnic groups put off 
or threatened erstwhile allies in politics and business 
alike.  Harry had ample, well-documented, public animosities. 
 In December 2001, after alleging that Odili was threatening 
to kill him, police arrested Harry.  His younger brother (or 
cousin) Ipalibo Harry, now the running mate to ANPP Rivers 
State gubernatorial candidate Sergeant Awuse, posted 100,000 
naira for his bail a few days after the Civil Liberties 
Organization protested the detention as a violation of 
Harry\'s freedom of speech.  In February 2002, Harry told the 
press, \"If Odili returns as the governor of Rivers State in 
2003, I will pack my bags and go into exile.  But I know he 
will not win because he doesn\'t have what it takes to win the 
election in Rivers State politics.\" 
 
 
3.  (C) In contrast to the SSS perspective of the Harry-Odili 
relationship mentioned in ref A, Odili displayed at least 
once to poloffs his personal ire at the mere mention of 
Harry\'s name.  In a 2002 meeting with Odili, Lagos Consul 
General asked for his views on Marshall Harry and why Harry 
had been imprisoned on his orders.  The Governor responded 
angrily, demanding to know why the ConGen was wasting time 
asking about \"worthless criminals\" such as Harry.  The 
suggestion that Harry\'s detention had been noticed as a 
possible human rights issue was enough to send Odili into a 
tirade.  He said it was \"proper\" for police to detain Harry 
since he had accused the Chief Executive of Rivers State of 
plotting to kill hi.  This was a \"serious accusation that 
should not be brushed aside.  You cannot accuse the chief 
executive of a state without proof.  It is a very serious 
matter, and the police did the right thing interrogating him.\" 
 
 
4.  (U) Harry\'s last days mixed public denunciations of Odili 
with praises of ANPP presidential candidate General Mohammed 
Buhari. In a press conference covered by the March 4 ThisDay 
newspaper, Harry accused Odili of interfering with ANPP\'s 
launch of Buhari\'s campaign and said he would take his 
complaint directly to the Inspector General in Abuja.  He 
felt victimized over the fee plus deposit of 7.5 million 
naira asked of ANPP to secure the Port Harcourt Liberation 
Stadium for Buhari\'s campaign launch on March 8; a few weeks 
before, he claimed, the PDP had paid just 800,000 naira for 
the same political venue.  In a formal complaint addressed on 
March 3 to the Rivers State police commissioner, Harry 
stated: \"Since we started the preparation for the 
presidential flag-off campaign, we have noticed a high spate 
of arrest, intimidation, harassment, and maiming of our party 
officials, candidates, and supporters by Odili\'s thugs with 
the assistance of the Police\" (ThisDay, \"Harry Petitions 
Police, Says Odili to Disrupt ANPP Rally, March 6, 2003).  In 
the event that the police should \"fail\" to \"protect lives and 
property\" of the ANPP, Harry said, \"we do not lack the will 
and capacity to protect our supporters.\"  He went on to 
accuse the Rivers government of \"buying police and army 
uniforms as well as guns and ammunitions to equip their 
standing army of murderers for the purpose of rigging the 
forth-coming elections.\" 
 
 
5.  (U) In his last interview with The Guardian newspaper, 
printed on March 6, Harry said, \"Governor Odili is my friend. 
 I helped him to be there.  He is not my enemy.  He is the 
one telling people that I am his enemy, but my challenges and 
criticism are based on his bad governance.  He is not 
transparent and he is not honest with the people of the 
state.  I criticize him based on principle.\" 
 
 
----------------------- 
A PIN ON BUHARI\'S LAPEL 
----------------------- 
 
 
6.  (U) Harry, determined to bolster a Northern alliance with 
South-South minorities, promoted Muhammadu Buhari as a rival 
candidate to Obasanjo until his death.  Harry told the 
Guardian: \"It is the president\'s game to set the minorities 
against the North.... We are political allies with the North. 
 Watch out, each time a northern president is on board, the 
oil ministry is given to the southern minorities.  This time 
Obasanjo gave us the minister of culture so that we should be 
dancing around, and he still wants us to dance for another 
four years.  I have told you that Buhari is down to earth, he 
sees the problem of this country.  He knows the grave 
injustice suffered by the minorities, he knows we feel 
subjugated.  Buhari would not have done what Obasanjo did in 
Odi.  The mere fact that people were agitating for a fair 
deal out of oil derived from their area, which culminated in 
the killing of some policemen, is it enough to sack a whole 
village?  Buhari is a man who is coming to address the issues 
affecting the minorities.  I am a minority.... and I believe 
in his honest disposition.\" 
7.  (U) \"Primaries are a military creation to heat up the 
system,\" he said.  \"It is not a democratic attitude for an 
undeveloped nation like ours.  If you are talking about 
primaries in Britain and America, it is okay.  But in 
Nigeria, the driving force to play politics is economic 
power.  Nigerian politicians are driven by economic concern, 
and are in politics to amass wealth.  In the developed 
nations, it is to serve.\" 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
HARRY:  THE LONELINESS OF HIS MINORITY POLITICS 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
8.  (C) Harry\'s political allies-turned-nemeses included most 
of Nigeria\'s top power figures.  In 1999 he allegedly 
prevented Sergeant Awuse (now his brother\'s running mate) 
from obtaining the PDP\'s Rivers State gubernatorial ticket. 
In December 2001, he told reporters that Odumegwu Ojukwu\'s 
call for Igbo secession was \"the cry of a madman.\"  While 
chairing Rivers State\'s PDP chapter, he fought PDP\'s national 
chairman Barnabas Gemade\'s attempt to extend his term in 
power.  He founded the \"Campaign for the Realization of a 
South-South President 2003\" (CRESSOP), despite its 
implication that incumbent PDP President Obasanjo should not 
be reelected to office. When CRESSOP failed to mobilize a 
following, it was renamed the Rivers Democratic Movement 
(RDM) and is now campaigning against Odili.  Harry and six 
others (including Don Etiebet, now the ANPP national 
chairman) left or were expelled from the PDP after a 
protracted battle over the party\'s direction in 2002.  In 
April 2002, he said, \"Our position is very clear.  We believe 
in the North.  The next president should come from the 
South-south, come 2003.  We won\'t vote for Obasanjo.\"  In 
July 2002, he accused former vice president Admiral Augustus 
Aikhomu and Etiebet himself, arguably his main rival for a 
position of power in the party, of hijacking the ANPP in the 
South-South for their \"hidden agenda.\"  In August 2002, he 
called the impeachment proceedings against Obasanjo \"long 
overdue.\"  His pushing Buhari for the ANPP presidential 
candidate \"did not seem to go down well with aspirants like 
Bekinbo Soberekon and Sam Agwor.\" Despite all his battles, he 
said he had \"never been in a party that failed before.\" 
 
 
9.  (C) So who killed Harry?  Since at least 2001, he had 
been proclaiming publicly his Hobbesian fear of 
assassination.  Theories vary from the elaborate to the 
banal, including: 
 
 
--\"Fifth columnists attempting to create tension between PDP 
and ANPP, hoping to destabilize the elections and pave the 
way for the military to step in.\" 
--Machiavellian frame up of Odili by an ANPP player, as Odili 
would be the \"obvious\" suspect due to their prominent feuds. 
 
 
--Disgruntled ANPP presidential aspirants blocked by Buhari, 
whom Harry adamantly supported. 
--Unauthorized assassination, such as by the Vikings cult 
group in Rivers, which is popularly believed to have strong 
ties to the Rivers State government.  The murder\'s Abuja 
venue may have been a deliberate attempt to deflect attention 
from politics in Rivers. 
--None of his political enemies, but one from his prominent 
business life instead. 
--It was merely an armed robbery gone bad. 
 
 
10.  (C) Rivers State Attorney General Aleruchi Cookey-Gam 
confirmed that police investigations \"are quietly underway\" 
both in Rivers and in Abuja.  Because the murder took place 
in Abuja, she expects any trial will likely take place there. 
 Toward the investigation\'s conclusion, she expects her 
office will be asked for assistance regarding any arrested 
suspects.  In the meantime, she anticipates that federal 
authorities will lead the way.

1.  (U) SUMMARY.  Marshall Harry\'s death on March 5 is the 
latest in a series of murders regarded by southern Nigerians 
as political assassinations.  His death has raised tensions 
in the Rivers State capital of Port Harcourt, where the 
leading opposition presidential candidate plns to hold a 
rally tomorrow, March 8.  Harry\'s death is being interpreted 
in the South as a warning to politicians that some of them 
will try to attain and hold on to power at all costs.  (See 
also septel \"WHO WAS MARSHALL HARRY?\")  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------ 
ANPP RALLY MOVES FORWARD 
------------------------ 
 
 
2.  (C) ANPP\'s rally for presidential candidate Muhammadu 
Buhari, organized by Marshall Harry just prior to his death, 
is still scheduled to take place at the Port Harcourt 
Liberation Stadium tomorrow, March 8.  Deputy Police 
Commissioner for Rivers State B.A. Hassan told poloff March 7 
that the police are \"prepared for a potential backlash,\" but 
he does not anticipate there will be a disturbance.  He 
expressed confidence in the ability of his \"men on the ground 
to contain any problems\" and said they will \"meet with the 
political heads to reach an understanding\" that the event 
should go peacefully.  He said he expects the leaders will in 
turn talk to their youth supporters to ensure that no 
violence will break out among them. 
 
 
3.  (C) Despite hopes, the rally may become dangerous and 
peace unpredictable.  A rumor circulated earlier this week 
that youths would burn down the stadium in retaliation for 
the alleged higher fee charged for ANPP\'s use of the facility 
than that recently charged for a similar PDP function. 
Rumors that the ANPP may display Harry\'s corpse at the rally 
could create a \"volatile emotional situation\" and provoke 
supporters to \"go on the rampage,\" as a Halliburton security 
report recently noted.  \"The situation can also be hijacked 
by miscreants,\" they observe. 
 
 
4.  (U) ANPP National Chairman Don Etiebet was quoted on 
March 5 as saying, \"I want to call on all Nigerians to hold 
the PDP government and Chief Olusegun Obasanjo responsible 
for the gunning down of our members all over the country.  If 
these intimidations and killings continue we have no option 
than to call on all Nigerians to defend themselves\" (Reuters, 
\"Nigeria opposition chief assassinated.\" 3/5/03). 
 
 
--------------------- 
PORT HARCOURT ON EDGE 
--------------------- 
 
 
5.  (C) Human rights groups have reported that there is \"very 
strong suspicion in Port Harcourt that the PDP has a hand in 
the killing.\"  Chris Newsom of Friends of the Ogoni People 
recently said: \"Marshall Harry\'s death is not a bolt from the 
blue.  He had alerted the public of threats against his life 
for some time.  The message people are taking from this is, 
\'This is just the beginning.\'  People are interpreting the 
act to be one of pure intimidation, as if to say, \'If we can 
take Harry down, nobody is safe.\'\"  Multiple credible sources 
say armed thugs referred to as \"Odili Boys\" continue to 
harass political opponents of Governor Odili.  Over the past 
several months, an increasing number of Southerners have been 
echoing Harry\'s accusation (septel) that the Rivers State 
Government has been directly arming thugs to maintain the 
incumbent\'s support. 
 
 
6.  (C) Human rights activists and Rivers State government 
officials are concerned about their personal safety. 
\"Confidence in Port Harcourt regarding the safety of 
political players of all shades is very, very, low,\" said 
Newsom.  Rivers State Attorney General Aleruchi Cookey-Gam 
told poloff on March 7 that officials \"have been advised to 
take proper caution, though the climate has been peaceful 
except for a few pockets.  Overall, it has been better than 
could be expected.  Police are on the alert and working hard 
to maintain peace.\"  Azibaola Robert, president of the Niger 
Delta Human and Environmental Rescue Organization (ND-HERO) 
met with other human rights groups in Port Harcourt today 
(March 7) and will issue a statement calling for responsible 
parties to \"eschew bitterness and violence.\"  Ledum Mitee, 
president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni 
People (MOSOP), will meet today (March 7) with Governor 
Odili.  MOSOP and other groups also plan to air a radio 
statement appealing for public calm. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
INITIAL PROTESTS CALMED DOWN 
---------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (C) Official and NGO sources confirmed that the 
atmosphere is \"pretty calm\" now.  On the night of March 5 or 
early morning of March 6, someone dynamited the private 
medical clinic of the Secretary to Rivers State Government 
Abiye Sekibo, but eye-witnesses say the property suffered 
minor damage.  Press reports said one patient was injured and 
moved to a state hospital.  Most targets have been \"property, 
not people,\" said Newsom.  \"A few people have been roughed 
up.  But no one has been killed, to my knowledge,\" he said. 
 
 
8.  (C) On March 5, an estimated five hundred protestors 
marched from Harry\'s Port Harcourt office through the streets 
toward the airport, carrying signs reading \"Who killed 
Marshall Harry?\" and \"Why him, Marshall Harry?\"  As a 
precaution, Halliburton raised its security alert level to 
\"high\" within Port Harcourt, and reported that some \"vehicles 
were burnt and people were brutalized.  A Coca Cola truck was 
seized and the bottles used as weapons.  Despite the presence 
of policemen on the airport road, some groups of rampaging 
youths are targeting and vandalizing any government vehicle 
in sight.\"  Multiple sources confirm that \"a couple\" of 
vehicles were burned, including one federal government 
vehicle.  Government vehicles are now absent from Port 
Harcourt streets. Rivers State House of Assembly Speaker 
Rotimi Amaechi described Port Harcourt on March 5 to poloff 
as \"calm, but there are lots of rumors, tensions, and threats 
circulating.\"  Lowering his voice, he added, \"I am a member 
of PDP, but I don\'t like what is happening.\" Poloff was 
unable to get him to elaborate on this remark.

1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Eusebe Hounsokou, UNHCR representative in 
Nigeria, updated Poloff on his efforts to relocate 5,000 
Liberian refugees from Cote d\'Ivoire to Nigeria (Ref B).  Per 
UNHCR Geneva\'s information, Hounsokou advised the GON that, 
since the USG may take up to 10,000 Liberian refugees for 
resettlement, permanent shelters will not/not be necessary to 
accommodate those transferred here until arrangements can be 
made to move them to the United States.  If the GON approves 
the relocation, UNHCR will advise against placing all 5,000 
Liberian refugees in a single camp within Nigeria.  He asked 
that Ambassador Jeter raise the issue with President 
Obasanjo.  Per Abuja Septel, GON appears to be leaning toward 
accepting some refugees.  Ambassador\'s intervention with the 
President may not be necessary.  Apparently receiving 
inaccurate information from Geneva, Hounsokou is representing 
our offer regarding possible United States resettlement of 
refugees as more ironclad than we would like. 
Washington/Geneva may want to clarify this with UNHCR (see 
para 5).  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  (C) On February 26, Hounsokou recounted to Poloff his 
earlier conversations with MFA Permanent Secretary Ambassador 
Daniel Hart and GON Commissioner for Refugees Professor Igna 
Gabriel.  Hounsokou\'s initial approach to the MFA was not 
forwarded to Nigeria\'s refugee commissioner, who asked that a 
formal request be readdressed to him. Hounsokou sent the 
requested letter to Commissioner Gabriel on February 25 and 
was awaiting the GON\'s official reply.  On separate 
occasions, each gentleman gave Hounsokou his personal support 
for relocating the requested 5,000 Liberian refugees to 
Nigeria from Cote d\'Ivoire (Ref A).  Each told Hounsokou he 
felt \"ashamed\" that Nigeria had not taken part in the 
military operation, and thus hoped the GON would play a 
humanitarian role. 
 
 
3.  (C) Hounsokou is optimistic that GON will accept the 
refugees for relocation here.  Gabriel suggested to Hounsokou 
that Obasanjo will make the decision personally.  Gabriel 
will tell Obasanjo his opinion that \"This is our duty.  We 
should assist with the refugees.\"  Hounsokou asked if 
Ambassador Jeter could speak with President Obasanjo to 
confirm USG interest in the issue and to encourage a rapid 
decision on the GON\'s part. (Embassy Abuja delivered the 
Reftel A demarche to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The 
Nigerians seemed to be leaning heavily toward a positive 
decision. Consequently, there is little utility for the 
Ambassador\'s intervention at this stage. The MFA and other 
GON agencies are scheduled to meet within the next week and 
make a decision on the refugees.  Depending on the decision, 
the Mission will reconsider the appropriateness of Ambassador 
Jeter intervening with the President.) 
 
 
4.  (C) NOTE: UNHCR Geneva apparently advised Hounsokou that 
USG may take up to 10,000 Liberian refugees for resettlement. 
 On this basis, he is suggesting to the GON that permanent 
shelters will not/not be necessary to accommodate those 
transferred here until arrangements can be made to move them 
to the U.S.  Poloff cautioned Hounsokou that the USG would 
first require each individual case to be dutifully 
documented, something we understand has been difficult given 
the problems with file corruption at Nicla (Refs A and D). 
Hounsokou requested more information about what USG 
requirements will entail in this regard. 
 
 
5.  (U) Washington/Geneva: Based on information received from 
UNHCR Geneva, Hounsokou apparently has represented to the GON 
that the USG was firmly committed to taking thousands of 
refugees.  Our interpretation of Reftel A indicates that this 
is not the case.  To avoid future misunderstanding, 
Washington/Geneva may want to clarify our position with UNHCR 
Geneva. 
 
 
6.  (C) Hounsokou expressed concern that the GON may lack the 
resources to transport the refugees.  Any assistance the USG 
can provide in this regard would be appreciated. Poloff 
suggested that Hounsokou check with UNHCR Geneva for possible 
transportation funds, and mentioned that the USG recently 
contributed $30 million to the UNHCR that was allocated to 
Africa (Ref E). 
 
 
7.  (C) If the GON approves the relocation, UNHCR will advise 
against placing all 5,000 Liberian refugees in a single camp 
within Nigeria.  Experience has taught UNHCR that large 
refugee camps often become recruitment grounds for armed 
factions to recruit fighters. 
 
 
8.  (SBU) UNHCR plans to relocate its main office to Abuja 
sometime between September and December 2003, when their 
contractor should have completed the new facility.  Due to 
the Lagos office\'s proximity to the refugee camp, Hounsokou 
would like to keep a senior staff member here to manage the 
camp. 
 
 
9. (C) COMMENT: The GON has provided hopeful signs that it 
will accept a number of refugees. Whatever it decides, the 
GON will base its decision on its role as  a sub-regional 
leader balanced against strong domestic budgetary and 
political exigencies.  Potential USG plans to resettle 
Liberians in the U.S. may be a factor in the decision but a 
secondary one.  However, unless corrected, the 
misunderstanding that the US will take in most of not all 
these refugees will be important in shaping UNHCR and 
Nigeria\'s plans for accommodating the refugees.  The UNHCR 
and the GON would need significantly fewer resources to 
accommodate refugees on a short-term basis.  Consequently, it 
is imperative that we eliminate any misunderstanding about 
the USG\'s commitment toward the Liberian refugees.  END 
COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EINV, EFIN, NI 
SUBJECT: DON\'T SHOW ME THE MONEY; NIGERIA GOING 
CASHLESS 
 
1. SUMMARY:  As in many developing economies with high 
inflation and a devalued currency, consumers in Nigeria 
often must bring literally bags of money to the store 
to make even routine purchases.  Checks are used almost 
exclusively for business-to-business transactions, and 
credit cards are accepted almost nowhere. Recently, the 
use of pre-paid debit cards (known here as smart cards) 
has been on the rise, and marketers hope the trend will 
continue.  In fact, the U.S. Consulate General in Lagos 
recently began accepting a smart card as the exclusive 
payment method for nonimmigrant visa transactions, and 
the British High Commission has followed suit.  Two 
brands of smart cards backed by bank consortia are 
leading the market, each with its own unique market 
niche.  These novel businesses, along with others in 
the finance industry that are considering ways to bring 
revolving credit to the country, are banking on the 
radical concept that a significant part of the Nigerian 
economy may become cash-less in the coming years.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
 
------------------------------------- 
A BAG OF MONEY FOR A BAG OF GROCERIES 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. Nigeria remains almost exclusively a cash-based 
economy.  Checks are not used at the consumer level, 
but rather are the province of business-to-business 
transactions.  Credit cards are used almost nowhere, 
both because of fraud concerns and because revolving 
credit is not widely offered by Nigerian banks. 
Occasional ATM machines can be found, but debit cards 
are not in use.  Consumers in Nigeria must thus use 
cash for almost all transactions, whether it be the 
purchase of a bag of ground nuts from a street hawker, 
the purchase of a family\'s groceries in a supermarket, 
or the purchase of a used vehicle from a neighbor. 
Adding to the inconvenience, Nigeria\'s highest 
denomination bill is the 500 Naira note; just under 
four dollars.  Accordingly, Nigerians and expats alike 
are accustomed to carrying small sacks of cash for any 
single purchase ranging several hundred dollars or 
more, for their weekend shopping, or for any in-country 
travel.  Payday for Nigerians also commonly involves 
the transfer of small bags or bricks of cash. 
 
 
3. A new and growing financial product is slowly 
changing the way Nigerians approach transactions. 
Smart cards were launched in Nigeria almost five years 
ago and are becoming increasingly available and 
accepted for use, particularly in urban areas.  Smart 
cards are reusable plastic cards containing an embedded 
computer chip that records and manages a pre-loaded 
balance of funds from which debits are deducted. 
Industry sources report that smart card technology was 
first widely utilized in France for secured access to 
buildings.  The use of a computer chip to store and 
manage data is considered less vulnerable to 
unauthorized manipulation or to information theft than 
the magnetic strips most commonly found on credit and 
debit cards and access passes in the United States. 
And while forms of disposable smart cards are used in 
Europe and elsewhere for a variety of consumer 
transactions, Paul Lawal, the Managing Director and 
Chief Executive of the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement 
System (NIBSS), told Econoff that the use of 
reloadable, chip-based smart cards for financial 
transactions is unique to Nigeria. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
THE PRODUCT AND THE PLAYERS 
--------------------------- 
 
 
4. Smart cards are generally offered and administered 
by consortia of banks.  They are designed to make 
transactions easier and safer for consumers by 
providing an alternative to regularly carrying and 
producing large quantities of cash.  Smart cards are 
similar to debit cards used in the United States, 
except the card is generally not associated with 
deposits kept in an open account.  Instead, a consumer 
obtains a card at a bank and loads a sum of money onto 
it. The card carries the issuing bank\'s logo, and 
transactions are associated with that bank.  When the 
consumer makes a purchase at a participating vendor, 
swiping the card and entering a personal identification 
number (PIN), the vendor\'s card-reader debits the 
balance on the card and stores the charge.  The vendor 
periodically takes the stored data from the reader to 
the bank or other card issuer that the vendor 
contracted with to receive payment from the charges. 
The bank or issuer then settles all outstanding charges 
across the consortium through the NIBSS.  When the 
consumer spends the balance loaded onto the card, he or 
she simply reloads a new balance at the issuing bank. 
Vendors are charged a fee per transaction, usually a 
percentage of the transaction amount.  For example, the 
US Consulate General is charged 1.25 percent per 
transaction for its use of smart cards for visa 
transactions.  But banks and other card issuers make 
most of their profit from smart cards by using the 
\"float\" generated, that is, by earning interest on or 
investing the value of the deposits made by their 
cardholders when loading the smart cards, before 
charges are made and cleared. 
 
 
5. Three companies offer smart cards in Nigeria, each 
with a unique market niche.  The current leading smart 
card brand is ValuCard, which was first introduced 
nearly five years ago and is accepted by a wide variety 
of stores and restaurants throughout Nigeria.  ValuCard 
is backed by a consortium of approximately 40 banks, 
including many of the largest and oldest in Nigeria. 
ValuCard boasts that its consortium represents 90 
percent of the country\'s banking system, and has over 
3,000 vendors in 50 cities nationwide.  Using software 
developed by the Irish company CardBase Technology, 
ValuCard offers perhaps the simplest but most limited 
product available, in that the card is primarily a 
reloadable payment method using a PIN, while other 
cards offer a variety of payment services and options. 
Further, the ValuCard customer can load his or her card 
only at a branch of the bank from which the card was 
issued, not from any ValuCard dealer.  However, 
ValuCard offered the first card on the market, is 
backed by the largest banks in the country and employs 
an extensive marketing campaign, making it the leading 
brand in Nigeria.  ValuCard is gradually expanding the 
capabilities of its card, but remains focused on the 
essential nature of its product.  Paul Lawal of the 
NIBSS estimates that ValuCard services 60 percent of 
the smart card market. 
 
 
6. SmartPay is the second leading brand of smart card 
in Nigeria.  The U.S. company Retriever Payment Systems 
holds a 98 percent interest in SmartPay, which has been 
on the market for about three years.  SmartPay is 
backed by a consortium of over 30 banks, but most are 
medium and small banks with limited geographic focus. 
Only a few banks participate in both SmartPay and 
ValuCard.  Where ValuCard centered its development on 
consumer marketing and vendor distribution, SmartPay 
focused its initial efforts on the software it uses for 
transactions and offers a product of greater 
versatility.  In addition to a reloadable, PIN-based 
payment card, SmartPay offers a PIN-less function that 
allows consumers to give their card to others to use up 
to a relatively low-value ceiling (about $40).  For 
example drivers may purchase fuel on behalf of their 
employers without entering a PIN.  SmartPay cards can 
be reloaded at any bank in the consortia, and SmartPay 
offers debit card, ATM and credit functions to some of 
its customers. Even though the SmartPay product is more 
versatile and multifunctional than ValuCard, it has 
suffered from a lack of marketing and is only now 
attempting to garner a larger percentage of the smart 
card market through strategic partnerships such as 
foreign diplomatic mission consular services. 
 
 
7. The third player in the Nigerian smart card industry 
is SecureTrust.  SecureTrust was also founded some 
three years ago by the former IT manager of ValuCard, 
after his ideas for what he felt was superior 
technology were ignored by the industry leader.  He 
focused his fledgling company\'s product development on 
the technology of the smart card, using product design 
and software developed by Visa and Proton Technology of 
Belgium.  SecureTrust remains a very small player; it 
is backed by only two or three banks, and is not used 
by many consumers or recognized by many vendors. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP - A VERY LONG WAY UP 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
8. NIBSS estimates that the use of smart cards for 
financial transactions has increased roughly 30 percent 
in the last 18 months.  However, data on the size of 
the smart card market is conflicting.  While the 
Managing Director of SmartPay states that the current 
market totals only 100,000 cards, ValuCard asserts that 
by the end of 2002 it had issued 180,000 cards. 
ValuCard also claims an impressive and steady increase 
in the value of its transactions per year since 1999, 
when it recorded transactions worth 300 million Naira 
($2.4 million). ValuCard reports that consumers used 
its card for transactions worth one billion Naira ($8 
million) in 2000, six billion Naira ($47.6 million) in 
2001, and over 16.6 billion Naira ($131.7 million) in 
2002. 
 
 
9. Still, according to NIBSS, 80 percent of consumer- 
level transactions involve cash transfers, and 15 
percent are paid by check, leaving smart card companies 
vying for a very small slice of Nigeria\'s market 
transactions.  Nonetheless, NIBSS Chief Executive Lawal 
notes a definite upward trend in the use of smart cards 
amongst the educated population, which tends to have 
more disposable income.  Along with mobile phones and 
imported clothes, Lawal observes that educated, 
professional Nigerians are using smart cards as a 
status symbol, and predicts the demand for cashless 
transactions will continue to rise amongst this 
important segment of consumers as they become 
increasingly accustomed to the use of credit and debit 
cards in the United States and Europe.  Noting this 
trend, Lawal told Econoff that financial institutions 
in Nigeria are developing plans for revolving credit 
accounts, and NIBSS is studying the telecommunications 
infrastructur requirements and improvements needed in 
the country to sustain debit card transactions. 
 
 
10. The U.S. Consulate General Lagos began accepting 
ValuCard as the exclusive method of payment for 
nonimmigrant visa fees in December 2002, in addition to 
its use for occasional warehouse disposal sales and 
fees associated with the Educational Advising Center. 
Similarly, the British High Commission in Abuja 
launched a ValuCard payment system on March 4, 2003. 
Both of these developments will cause a significant 
increase in the issuance of smart cards, as each 
country\'s diplomatic mission in Nigeria services tens 
of thousands of applicants each year, and card issuers 
are pitching other missions to follow suit.  Smart card 
issuers also hope that the acceptance of ValuCard by 
foreign missions will translate into an increase in the 
number of vendors accepting their cards, as consumers 
across socio-economic strata become aware of the 
product and demand the service from merchants. 
 
 
11. COMMENT: There are limits to going cashless in 
Nigeria.  The unofficial economy -- the street vendors, 
hawkers, and product and service providers who come to 
their customers\' homes and whose marketing is 
exclusively word-of-mouth -- is a major part of the 
Nigerian economic structure and social fabric.  Until 
smart card readers are made available to these 
merchants and craftsmen, cash will remain the 
overwhelmingly predominant method of payment in 
Nigeria.  Also, Econoff has heard complaints that smart 
card readers are inoperable frequently enough that 
consumers feel the need to carry cash anyway and simply 
use their smart card where possible. 
 
 
12. COMMENT CONTINUED: Nonetheless, if demand does 
continue for this product, banks may develop the 
infrastructure needed to support other products and 
services such as revolving credit accounts and debit 
transactions.  To do so would require extensive build- 
outs to Nigeria\'s weak telecommunications 
infrastructure, but and the rise of GSM use has made 
land-line repair and expansion a low priority. Before 
credit and debit become widely used, Nigeria will 
require further anti-fraud advances, both in prevention 
and prosecution.  Today, even where credit cards are 
accepted, mostly in a few hotels in Abuja and Lagos, 
most residents and visitors to Nigeria dislike using 
them for fear of financial crime.  If security 
improves, increased electronic transfers of funds could 
help reduce petty corruption and embezzlement because 
less cash would change hands, and law enforcement could 
better monitor and trace transactions. 
 
 
13. COMMENT CONTINUED: In the meantime, smart card 
companies may continue to see large increases in the 
value of transactions.  Even if the number of 
transactions or cards issued remains relatively limited 
in scope or grows flat, more people will use cards for 
big-ticket items like vehicle purchases.  Any 
significant or prolonged currency depreciation should 
make smart cards even more attractive to consumers. 
Ultimately, like most business opportunities in 
Nigeria, there is money to be made in the smart card 
and related services industry, if companies accept the 
challenges of weak infrastructure and vulnerable 
security.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, SCUL, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEATH OF LAGOS TRADITIONAL RULER 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  The death last week of Oba Adeyinka 
Oyekan highlights the role traditional rulers still 
play in Nigerian society.  Appointing an Oba\'s 
successor (a traditional Yoruba king) is often 
contentious, and the royal palace of Lagos was already 
filled by intrigue as the 92 year old Oba\'s health 
failed over the past several months.  As events 
surrounding Oba Oyekan\'s death and burial unfold, Lagos 
security measures have been tightened.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
OBA OYEKAN:  HALLMARK OF A YORUBA MONARCH 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
2.  In Yorubaland, an oba\'s death is an event that 
thrives on myth and rumor, while the truth lies 
somewhere in-between.  According to age-old Yoruba 
belief, Oba Adeyinka Oyekan has not died; he has passed 
away, transposing to another plane to join his 
ancestors.  An oba has power over life and death (\"iku 
baba yeye\").  In his palace, \"death\" is a forbidden 
word.  An oba must never see a corpse or attend burial 
ceremonies.  Despite an oba\'s seeming invincibility and 
immortality, when one\'s death becomes reality, several 
weeks may pass before the news is publicized. 
 
 
3.  So it was for Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, the 18th monarch 
of Lagos.  On March 7, he reportedly died after a brief 
illness.  Born on June 30, 1911, Oba Oyekan was the 
grandson of the late Oba Adeyinka Oyekan 1, the 12th 
Oba of Lagos.  He assumed the throne in 1965 after a 
protracted ascension battle that was finally resolved 
at the Privy Council in England.  Oba Oyekan enjoyed a 
preeminent position among all other traditional rulers 
in Lagos State as the permanent chairman of the Lagos 
State Council of Chiefs for many years.  His tenure 
marked a turning point in the history of obaship in 
Lagos.  He worked hard to promote unity among 
Lagosians, irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds, 
and he was highly respected by his people for his 
advocacy of peace and progress in the state. 
 
 
----------------- 
OBAS IN DEMOCRACY 
----------------- 
 
 
4.  In the past, party affiliation played a prominent 
role in government dealings with traditional rulers. 
In the First Republic, two prominent traditional rulers 
were even dethroned for their political beliefs or 
party affiliations.  In the Second Republic, party 
affiliation and political considerations played a key 
role in the selection of traditional rulers by state 
governments.  Successive governments in Nigeria, 
military and civilian, have shown enormous interest in 
traditional institutions.  This is due in part to the 
power traditional rulers wield among their people. 
 
 
5.  Under today\'s Nigerian democracy, political parties 
and individuals often rely on traditional rulers to 
achieve political objectives.  Traditional rulers are 
careful to refrain from stating their political 
preferences publicly, fearing this would be 
counterproductive should an opposition party take 
power.  Their most potent weapon remains the chieftancy 
titles they bestow upon sons and daughters they deem 
deserving.  Only the oba can convey  traditional 
titles, which are still very important and relevant in 
Nigerian politics.  The manner in which these titles 
are awarded leaves no question about the ruler\'s 
intentions.  They are often meant to promote the 
political, economic and social interests of those who 
seek them.  Not having a title like chief, otunba, or 
asiwaju precede one\'s name is a major disadvantage in 
South-West politics. 
 
 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
TRADITIONAL RITES, SECURITY, AND FILLING THE THRONE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
6.  Various rituals follow the death of an important 
oba in Yorubaland.  Oracles are consulted to determine 
which rituals should be performed.  Most of these 
rituals are shrouded in secrecy and better carried out 
late at night, away from the public\'s prying eyes. 
Tradition holds that an oba\'s burial must be 
accompanied by human sacrifice.  The oracle determines 
when the oba\'s burial should take place and the type of 
sacrifice that should accompany it.  The delay in 
announcing an oba\'s demise, and the curfew imposed 
afterwards, traditionally enabled palace hands to 
obtain persons to be sacrificed.  Rumors are already 
circulating that at least nine other souls must 
accompany Oba Oyekan in his transitional journey. 
E.O. 1295: N/A 
SUBJEC: NIGERIA: DEATH OF LAGOS TRADITIONAL RULER 
Maret closures are an important part of the burial 
process.  Officially, the closures mark respect for 
late oba.  People generally believe, however, that the 
markets are closed to ensure successful curfews.  Lagos 
markets routinely operate late into the night; their 
closure encourages people to remain indoors during 
curfew. 
 
 
7.  COMMENT.  Oba Oyekan\'s death has opened a new phase 
in the Lagos obaship throne.  Traditional Lagos ruling 
houses already hold divergent views about which house 
should produce the next Oba.  Over the coming months, 
succession disputes among the houses will be a major 
media spectacle.  Eventually, the disputes may result 
in litigation, proving that in Nigeria, time-honored 
traditions and modern institutions blend to weave a 
complicated societal and cultural fabric. END COMMENT.

. 
 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY.  Southern civic and media groups have 
diverse views of the coming elections, ranging from 
optimistic anticipation of leadership change to fear of 
ruthless power tactics.  Some analysts predict \"bloody\" 
elections in Kwara and the South-South states, but relative 
calm in Lagos and elsewhere.  Across the South, the 
increasing frequency and prominence of apparent political 
assassinations has heightened the public\'s nervousness.  None 
of the scenarios for violence include attacks against foreign 
nationals.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
SOUTHERN TENSIONS RISING; IMPUNITY REIGNS SUPREME 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
2.  (C) Beyond the on-going societal violence and 
extrajudicial killings, which result in corpses on the 
streets and in the lagoons or rivers of Lagos State, numerous 
prominent Nigerian citizens have been murdered in recent 
months.  Southern Nigerians express universal horror at the 
murders, several of which have taken place in the victims\' 
homes.  While the 2001 case of felled Attorney General Bola 
Ige remains under prosecution, to date no suspects have been 
convicted for politically motivated murders in the post-1999 
administration.  Over a dozen such murders and additional 
reported attempted murders remain unsolved from the past two 
years.  Whatever the reasons for the stinted administration 
of justice, many Nigerians view the GON as complacent toward 
or impotent against political violence in the South. 
Southern human rights groups have warned poloffs since 
September 2002 that the number of deaths would surely rise as 
elections drew nearer.  This sad prediction is being 
fulfilled, though the reasons behind the violence remain 
hazy. 
 
 
3.  (C) Tensions in the South have increased steadily since 
last fall.  Multiple sources accuse political leaders and 
their supporters of plotting various murders that have taken 
place under suspicious circumstances.  Some candidates appear 
to be wearing bullet-proof vests.  Sources attribute 
assassinations generally to one of two possible motives: a 
major \"business deal gone bad\" or a political vendetta. 
Ledum Mitee, president of the Movement for the Survival of 
the Ogoni People (MOSOP), says the motive itself is less 
important in explaining the phenomenon of these killings than 
the atmosphere of impunity they generate.  The \"real reason 
why it happens,\" he argues, is the \"lack of accountability\" 
combined with an \"irrational instinct to dominate that comes 
with power.\"  Political killings may occur if someone 
obsessed with power, or allies, views a person as an 
opponent\'s supporter.  The target may not be the opponent 
directly.  Some politicians are allegedly detaining opponents 
and critics with impunity.  For example, Eni Akinsola of CDHR 
reports that authorities are repeatedly detaining polytechnic 
professor John Okam without charges, allegedly under orders 
by a member of the Cross River State House of Assembly. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
FORECAST: MORE VIOLENCE AHEAD 
----------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (C) POLITICAL KILLINGS, THUGGERY, AND VIGILANTISM. In 
southern Nigeria, persons who initiate violence will usually 
appeal more to ethnic than to religious ties, most sources 
agree.  More dangerous than sporadic societal uprisings, some 
sources claim, are threats by hired thugs.  Southern human 
rights NGOs expect political violence will continue to rise 
throughout the election season.  Many see it as indisputable 
fact that some politicians recruit thugs to influence the 
outcome of elections or other political gatherings.  Other 
politicians, failing to discourage criminal actions by their 
supporters who are seeking to maintain or gain power, 
passively permit such violence.  Members of the Committee for 
the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR), including Eni Akinsola, 
Shina Loremikan, Belo Aideloje, and Ropo Ewenla, described 
first-hand experience they had in university when dominant 
military rulers paid friends to disrupt political and social 
meetings that could undermine the strongman\'s agenda.  The 
same methods are used to affect political agendas in 
democracy today, they claim. 
 
 
5.  (C) ARMED STUDENTS TO TAKE TO THE STREETS.  Contacts from 
CDHR, MOSOP, the Catholic Secretariat, and the Civil 
Liberties Organization continue to raise allegations with 
poloffs that some candidates actively recruit student 
\"cultists\" to join street armies and intimidate voters at the 
polls.  Groups such as the Vikings in Rivers and Black Ax in 
Enugu are receiving funds in exchange for their \"support.\" 
Arms are being stockpiled on university campuses, they claim. 
 \"Students will tell you, \'I\'m for so-and-so,\'\" said CDHR\'s 
Eni Akinsola.  \"When you ask them, \'Why?\' they\'ll tell you 
simply, \'He\'s my candidate.\'  You know what they mean.  They 
have been paid.\" 
 
 
6.  (C) DEADLY PLACES TO WATCH?  Akinsola and Chukwuma 
Ezeala, national coordinator of the Justice Development and 
Peace Commission (JDPC), predict that roughly half of 
Nigeria\'s states will be violent and half will be peaceful 
come elections.  Kwara\'s capital of Illorin will be \"one big 
pool of blood,\" they say.  \"Kwara is anybody\'s game: Lawal, 
Saraki, or Lai Mohammed.\"  Rivers and Delta will also be 
\"very bloody.\"  Bayelsa and Cross River will have \"problems.\" 
 In Akwa Ibom, though the urban centers may be peaceful, the 
villages may endure the \"worst potential violence.\"  They 
expect violence in Ondo and Oyo \"because the people there do 
not support the candidates they are bringing, and the PDP 
will win these states at all costs.\"  Potential hotspots in 
the North include Kano, Kebbi, and especially Katsina, they 
believe.  Kaduna and Plateau will be \"dicey.\"  Borno will be 
interesting because of the balanced strength of competing 
parties, they argue.  Nassarawa may have skirmishes as well. 
 
 
------------------------------------------ 
TENTATIVE TRUCES AND \"TRANSPARENT RIGGING\" 
------------------------------------------ 
 
 
7.  (C) Lagos will be relatively peaceful, think Akinsola and 
Ezeala, because \"the two factions of the OPC have agreed not 
to fight each other here.\" Representatives of these two 
organizations believe that the OPC may be involved in 
violence elsewhere, namely Kwara, but the police have \"agreed 
to allow the OPC to participate in Lagos politics as long as 
no violence is involved.\"  In Ogun, where the vote is being 
\"more transparently rigged--no, \'allocated,\'\" voting will be 
relatively peaceful.  Kogi \"will be very peaceful, for the 
most part.\"  In Niger, \"the big-wigs won\'t allow their 
domains to deteriorate into violence.\"  Ekiti \"would have 
been a bloody tag team, but the four parties are not fighting 
each other now.\"  Other states that will not experience 
\"much\" violence include Osun, Sokoto, Abia, Bauchi, Benue, 
Zamfara, Adamawa, and Gombe.  Anambra will be violent, but to 
a lesser degree than the norm. 
 
 
8.  (C) RIGGING LEGITIMATELY: WHEN THEY\'LL THROW IN THE 
TOWEL.  \"You need to have genuine support in order to rig an 
election,\" asserted Akinsola.  \"If you cross the 30 percent 
threshold of support, then you can rig it to get the 
mandate.\"  Most rigging, according to Ledum Mitee of the 
Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), does 
not involve the literal \"stuffing of the ballot box.\"  The 
process is less definable than the outcome in some cases. How 
electoral officers are chosen and what they do with the 
resources they are given are important.  Do they make voting 
materials available?  Do they distribute fraudulent ballots? 
To combat rigging and increase the perceived legitimacy of 
election outcomes, several NGOs say, results should be 
announced on site by the local government offices, rather 
than passing the results all the way to Abuja for final 
announcement. 
 
 
9.  (C) COMMENT.  Political fears in the South are largely 
by-products of societal clashes between indigenous groups 
(e.g. Warri, Delta State), alleged assassinations, and 
political legitimacy questions (as some candidates across the 
South are reportedly \"imposed\" on voters without popular 
consent). Despite Obasanjo\'s popularity with many 
Southerners, his recent efforts to shore up political support 
have failed to convince people who feel that the GON has done 
little to engender economic development and social welfare, 
issues repeatedly highlighted as paramount to Southern 
constituents.  The climate remains volatile in pockets across 
the South; moreover, tensions continue to riddle 
relationships between the international oil companies 
operating in the region and the local residents. The 
coincidence of tensions in the Middle East and domestic 
violence in Nigeria is thus making many an expat 
uncomfortable.  Whatever election violence there may be in 
the South is not expected to involve foreign nationals, 
however. Prudence and common sense should help keep foreign 
nationals away from the election fray.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EPET, ENRG, EFIN, ECON, EINV, PINS, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIAN LOCAL VIOLENCE CAUSES MINIMAL IMPACT 
ON OIL PRODUCTION 
 
 
1. Summary.  A violent clash between local activists 
and police left seven dead in Delta state late last 
week. While Shell Oil moved non-essential staff from 
pockets of disturbance, there appears to be no 
disruption in oil production at this time.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. A simmering dispute between Ijaw activists and the 
government boiled over into a firefight late last week 
in the swamps near the town of Warri in Delta state. 
Reports indicate Ijaw youths from the village of 
Okerenkoko blocked a river channel used by both local 
residents and oil producers after the government failed 
to meet their demands to withdraw troops from the area, 
redraw electoral wards, and provide more oil revenue to 
local communities.  Organized loosely under the 
umbrella group Ijaw Youth Council, headed by Bello 
Oboko, who sources tell us is from Okerenkoko, the 
youths refused to allow a military-escorted barge to 
pass on its way to an oil installation.  Gunfire 
erupted, and various sources estimate four of the Ijaw 
and three soldiers were killed.  Reports that three 
additional police officers were kidnapped during the 
gun battle remain unconfirmed. 
 
 
3. In response to this gunfight and the current tension 
in outlying villages of Warri, Precious Omuku, Director 
of External Relations for Shell Petroleum Development 
Company of Nigeria, told Econoff that Shell has asked 
workers deemed non-essential to return from field 
operations to Warri for an undetermined period of time. 
He stated that Shell does not feel its operations or 
employees are under direct threat at this time, but 
rather, the company is taking precautions to minimize 
the number of its people in the field who might get 
caught in the crossfire between Ijaw youths and 
Nigerian police and soldiers.  If violence escalates, 
more personnel may be withdrawn to Warri.  Because he 
is away from corporate headquarters on a business trip 
to Port Harcourt, Omuku would not comment with any 
specificity as to whether oil production has been 
impacted, but he doubted the shifting of non-essential 
staff from remote locations to Warri would have any 
serious effect on Shell output. 
 
 
4. Sola Omole, General Manager of Government and Public 
Affairs for ChevronTexaco, likewise reports that his 
company is monitoring events in the region very 
closely, but has taken no action in response to the 
Okerenkoko clash.  Over the weekend, a ChevronTexaco 
vessel loaded with diesel fuel was captured and stolen, 
but its crew was released unharmed.  Omole attributes 
this theft on the Ijaw youth blockade of Delta 
waterways, but still maintains the company does not yet 
feel targeted.  He warns that the situation is very 
fluid, but noted that even if ChevronTexaco crude 
production in the area were to be disrupted, it amounts 
to some fifteen percent of the company\'s output, and 
which could be compensated for at other facilities, at 
least as a short-term response. 
 
 
5. Comment.  In the run-up to the April elections, 
incidents of inter-ethnic violence are bound to 
persist, as loosely organized local groups vying for 
power and money confront each other and the government, 
at times with bloody consequences.  While allocation of 
oil revenue is a key component of many of these groups\' 
complaints, recent violence has not been focused 
specifically on oil company facilities or their 
personnel.  Nonetheless, the companies will take 
precautions as their facilities and workers can quickly 
get caught in the midst of communal clashes or become 
associated with what may be perceived as government 
action or inaction.  If the violence remains 
decentralized and largely communal, crude oil 
production should remain stable, as the GON frequently 
makes up anticipated drops in any one company\'s monthly 
production by increasing the output quota of other 
companies, and none of the major producers have their 
output flowing from only one region.  At this time, 
personal safety appears to be the greatest challenge 
facing oil producers in Nigeria.  End Comment.

CAPACITY

Classified By: RHINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 B, D AND E 
 
 
1. (C) Summary. A senior industry source reports that 
Nigerian crude oil production 
is currently at full capacity.  He states that Nigeria is 
likely producing just 
over 2.2 million barrels of crude per day.  Ongoing communal 
violence in the 
Delta region is beginning to affect Shell Oil\'s production 
and daily operations 
of ChevronTexaco, and since all producers are pumping \"flat 
out,\" there is no 
one left to pick up any prolonged drop in production.  End 
Summary. 
 
 
2. (C) A senior executive at ExxonMobil told Econoff that 
while the drop in Shell 
Oil\'s production caused by clashes between ethnic groups in 
Delta State is 
relatively minor in relation to overall output, the GON 
cannot utilize its 
normal practice of reallocating Shell\'s reduced volume to 
other producers 
because all producers are now pumping \"flat out.\"  The 
executive, who has 20 
years experience working in Mobil Oil\'s Nigerian and 
international oil 
operations, said that since late February, all crude 
producers in Nigeria have 
been pumping at full capacity, and Nigeria\'s output should be 
at just over 2.2 
million barrels per day (bpd).  Shell announced this 
afternoon that due to 
ethnic violence, it closed 
five of its facilities in the Warri area, which reduces its 
output by 76,000 
bpd. Shell total output is estimated at 970,000 bpd. 
According to the 
executive, ExxonMobil is producing approximately 620,000 bpd 
of crude and 
condensates.  ChevronTexaco is estimated to be producing 
517,000 bpd. 
 
 
3. (U) In the past week, activists from the Ijaw ethnic 
community have been 
disrupting vessel traffic along the waterways of the Escravos 
River in 
Southwest Delta state near the town of Warri, resulting in 
gun battles with 
police and military units (reftel).  This escalated into 
direct attacks against 
both ethnic Itsekiri villages and a Shell Oil facility.  Both 
Shell and 
ChevronTexaco are moving some personnel out of their field 
operations in the 
delta swamps, primarily out of concern that they will be 
caught in the 
crossfire.  The situation in the area remains volatile and 
very fluid. 
 
 
4. (C) At the time of the discussion between Econoff and the 
ExxonMobil executive, 
Shell\'s estimated reduction in output was 30,000 bpd, what 
the executive 
described as a \"drop in the bucket.\"  When pressed, he said 
industry watchers 
should begin to worry if Nigeria\'s overall production drops 
by 100,000 bpd over 
a sustained period.  He also noted that Nigeria\'s current 
maximum production 
effort is matched throughout OPEC.  He said that OPEC-wide, 
it would be hard to 
pull an additional half-million barrels of crude at this 
time, except perhaps 
from Saudi Arabia. 
 
 
5. (C) Comment.  The GON normally allocates its OPEC quota 
among each of the oil 
producers doing business here.  In the past, whenever any 
given company\'s 
production levels have been reduced by equipment failure or 
community action, 
as in the case of the take-over by local women of 
ChevronTexaco\'s Escravos in the summer of 2002, the GON has 
quickly reallocated the anticipated 
production loss to other producers in order to maintain 
overall national output 
levels.  If OPEC quotas are being ignored at this time to 
maximize worldwide 
production, and Nigerian producers are operating at full 
capacity, sustained 
field operation disruptions may begin to have an effect on 
output as the GON 
has nowhere to turn to pick up the slack.  A small producer 
told Econoff that 
his company is still operating at only 35 percent capacity 
under GON quotas. 
It may be that if disruptions in the Delta or elsewhere 
continue, companies 
operating marginal fields will also be asked to operate at 
maximum capacity, 
making every drop of crude truly count. End comment.

2.   (SBU)  Summary.   The situation at ChevronTexaco\'s 
Escravos compound has deteriorated markedly since the March 
20 arrival of government troops to quell the confrontation 
between Ijaw and Itsikiri villagers over local political 
power.  Approximately 100 Amcits are inside of the compound 
along with another 100 expatriates, 1800 Nigerian employees, 
and 900 (of an original 2000) Itsikiri displaced persons 
(DP).   An unspecified number of Nigerian troops have also 
taken refuge inside the compound, having been surprised at 
how well the Ijaw villagers outside the compound are armed. 
The company hopes to evacuate all of its employees and the 
displaced persons via two Antonovs that are scheduled to 
arrive sometime tomorrow from South Africa.  There have been 
no injuries since March 17 when one Nigerian catering 
contractor was killed and one injured.  ChevronTexaco\'s 
onshore and swamp 140,000 bpd production has ceased and 
plans are to gradually shut down the remaining 300,000 bpd. 
(Note:  Omole asked that this last figure be treated as 
confidential.)  ChevronTexaco\'s security Manager has 
 
SIPDIS 
indicated that the company may ask for USG assistance in 
approaching the GON if the situation does not improve by 
Saturday, March 22.  End Summary. 
 
 
3.   (SBU)  On March 21 at 1440, Sola Omole, General 
Manager, Government and Public Affairs Department for 
ChevronTexaco called Econoff to report on the escalating 
tensions between warring villagers around ChevronTexaco\'s 
Escravos Tank Farm and to ask for USG assistance in 
contacting the GON.  Omole reported that the Ijaws outside 
the compound and security forces inside were shooting at one 
another.  In a subsequent conversation,  ChevronTexaco\'s 
security manager Ray Keel  indicated that if the situation 
does not improve, the company might ask for USG help on 
Saturday, March 22.  As of 1800,  Chevron has shut down its 
onshore and swamp operations, halted the production of 
140,000 bpd of crude oil, and hopes to evacuate all of its 
non-essential personnel and the villagers who are seeking 
refuge on the compound. 
 
 
4.   (SBU)  Omole requested that the Ambassador use his 
office to intercede at the level of the Nigerian presidency. 
Although he was not specific about what he was asking for, 
Omole indicated that the situation in Escravos was 
deteriorating.   (Comment:  We learned in a subsequent 
conversation that the President had been informed of 
ChevronTexaco\'s situation through Carl Masters, an associate 
of  former Ambassador Andrew Young.  End comment.)   Omole 
also spoke to the British High Commissioner. 
 
 
5.    (SBU) ConGen RSO met with ChevronTexaco security 
officers who largely confirmed Omole\'s assessment of the 
situation.   The Safety Manager told the CG and the RSO that 
he is considering asking the Ambassador for assistance, but 
the company was also approaching the government from other 
angles.  Later, Keel told CG that the company has contacted 
NNPC and the Nigerian military.  If these representations 
prove unsuccessful by tomorrow, the company may ask for USG 
assistance to press the government to stop the fighting. 
 
 
6.   (SBU)  In separate conversations, Keel told CG and RSO 
that the Ijaws are better armed with AK-47s and RPGs than 
anyone - including the Nigerian military - expected them to 
be.  Having caused the Nigerian security forces to retreat 
onto Chevron\'s property, the Ijaws are now accusing the 
company of colluding with their Itsikiri enemies who are 
also inside the compound. 
 
 
7.    (SBU)  Chevron is awaiting the arrival of two Antonovs 
(there were previous reports of a C-130) from South Africa 
via Uganda to evacuate the expatriates, the Nigerian staff, 
and the last 900 of the 2000 refugees remaining on its 
compound.  The planes are expected to arrive at the Escravos 
airstrip no sooner than Saturday, March 22.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The violent Ijaw confrontations of the 
Itsekiri in the oil-rich Escravos area result from their 
fierce political competition to control the South-west Warri 
Local Government.  The chairmanship of this local government 
is seen as a lynchpin to the Ijaw\'s economic survival.  If 
their demands are not met, the Ijaw intend to keep fighting 
to disrupt the April 12 local elections.  Although the Ijaw\'s 
stated target is neither the oil companies nor the Federal 
Government, ethnic dimensions of outside groups color the 
Ijaws\' views of Niger Delta politics and the larger polity. 
Among the many stakes in the crisis is the legitimacy of the 
election outcome.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
IJAW MOTIVATIONS & INTENT TO DISRUPT LOCAL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
2.  (C) Joshua Fumodoh (strictly protect), former president 
of the Ijaw National Congress, confirms that Ijaw youths 
intend to \"correct the anomaly\" of the distribution of wards 
in the South-west Warri Local Government of Delta State \"by 
any means necessary\" before local elections take place.  Oil 
companies are not the target.  The target is strictly the 
balance of political power between Ijaw and Itsekiri, the two 
main riverine groups of the area.  The Ijaw regard themselves 
as the majority ethnic group in this area and the Itsekiri as 
a minority group.  Under redistricting enacted after the 1999 
elections, 6 of the 10 wards of this local government were 
demarcated to the Itsekiri, according to Fumodoh.  The Ijaw 
view the chairmanship to the local government as paramount to 
allocating government revenue, and they see government as the 
region\'s sole means of economic resources outside of the oil 
industry.  The Ijaw see attaining the local government 
chairmanship as a life-or-death issue. 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
IJAW AND NIGER DELTA ETHNIC POLITICS 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
3.  (C) The Ijaw do not think President Obasanjo is a neutral 
actor in the crisis, due in part to his Yoruba ethnic 
heritage.  The Ijaw believe the Itsekiri are actually Yoruba 
affiliates, saying the Itsekiri actually \"speak Yoruba with 
an accent.\"  Fumudoh says, \"Despite Obasanjo\'s style to 
appear indifferent and aloof regarding all conflict 
situations, we believe he feels strongly about these issues 
on the inside.  All the Ijaw want is for the president to be 
fair.  We see him as siding with the Itsekiri, though he 
covers up his true feelings through his official language.\" 
This belief was further fueled over the weekend of March 
22-23 by reports of press statements given by Afenifere and 
the Yoruba Council of Elders (traditional Yoruba political 
interest groups) condemning the Ijaw\'s moves against the 
Itsekiri.  Fumodoh said the reports indicate that Yoruba 
groups would \"take up arms against the Ijaw\" if the fighting 
does not end. 
 
 
4.  (C) As discussed in ref B, the Army Chief of Staff is 
regarded by the Ijaw as a member of the Isoko ethnic group, a 
subset of the Urhobo group.  Fumodoh says the Urhobo, as a 
mainland and not riverine ethnic group, are generally seen as 
neutral and outside this conflict between Ijaw and Itsekiri 
(septel will explain complexities and contradictions of this 
issue).  Delta State Governor James Ibori is generally 
respected by the Ijaw as a peace-maker for his former roles 
in the ethnic conflict, although his mother is Itsekiri and 
his father Urhobo (septel to follow on Warri-Niger Delta 
politics). 
 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT.  Although the Ijaw may outnumber the 
Itsekiri nation-wide, Fumudoh has previously conceded to 
poloffs that the Ijaw constituency\'s status within a 
geopolitical area depends heavily on the boundary 
demarcations.  Gerrymandering directly impacts Ijaw political 
power.  The Ijaw believe that oil production has disrupted 
their traditional means of economic sustenance (i.e. 
fishing), and that government provides their only alternate 
means of survival.  Until a third option of viable private 
sector employment develops in their region, or until the 
spoils of power are seen by constituents as being distributed 
among minority and majority groups alike, the Ijaw are 
unlikely to end their quest for political power by any means 
necessary.  At risk are lives, long-term stability for oil 
production, property, and the legitimacy of local government 
elections in the Niger Delta.  END COMMENT.

1. (C) Summary.  TotalFinaElf (TFE) has become the latest 
victim of the strife between the Ijaws and Itsekiris in the 
Niger Delta. TFE has withdrawn its employees from four fields 
and ceased production there. The Ijaws, in an effort to 
ensure that their complaints are heard, now threaten to 
destroy the oil pipelines if the Government of Nigeria does 
not respond to their grievances.  Meanwhile ChevronTexaco 
continued its drawdown of staff.  Three hundred persons 
including staff, contractors, and displaced persons remain to 
be evacuated. End summary. 
 
 
2. (C) On March 24,TotalFinaElf\'s Deputy Manager for 
Technical Affairs told CG that company officials became aware 
last week of possible future agitation in four of the fields 
the company is operating. The fields are located two hours by 
boat and 10 minutes by helicopter east of Warri. 
Consequently, on March 21, TFE stopped pumping oil from these 
fields, evacuated 54 of its 144 staff there.  The company 
intended to leave behind a skeletal crew of 20 people.  TFE\'s 
four fields normally produce 7,500 bpd out of a total of 
140,000 bpd plus 6 million cubic meters of natural gas. 
 
 
3. (C) On March 22, TFE staff on site were told of a heavily 
armed group of 70-80 Ijaws on its way to the facilities.  The 
Ijaws arrived in three speed boats and a gunboat.  They wore 
uniforms and carried sophisticated radio equipment. The Ijaws 
began firing at TFE\'s security force and killed three 
soldiers, a Nigerian logistician, and a mechanic. The last 
victim was a Nigerian security consultant, a retired Army 
colonel who was tracked down and murdered in his office.  The 
Ijaws burned a nearby village and a TFE work camp.  They left 
an hour later, which permitted TFE to evacuate 137 people 
including all remainng TFE staff, contractors, and Nigerian 
military personnel.  As of 1500 March 24, no TFE remained on 
site.  Even in retrospect, TFE\'S Deputy Manager did not say 
why the facility was attacked or what the Ijaws wanted. 
 
 
4.(C) Despite the loss of six lives, TFE\'s Deputy Manager 
reported that little physical damage was done at the fields. 
TFE staff were able to shut down the facility thus lessening 
concerns of environmental damage.  Nevertheless, TFE 
management remains concerned that some disaffected groups may 
seize the opportunity afforded by the lack of protection at 
the sites to vandalize or otherwise damage field equipment. 
 
 
5. (C) Press sources report that the Ijaws are now 
threatening to destroy oil pipelines if their complaints 
reported in reftels are not addressed.  Sola Omole, 
ChevronTexaco\'s General Manager of the Government and Public 
Affairs, told EconOff March 24 that although Chevron\'s 
facilities are largely unguarded, he thinks it unlikely that 
the Ijaws will carry out their threat. Nonetheless, 
ChevronTexaco continued its draw-down of staff in the 
Escravos area. Three hundred persons including staff, 
contractors, and displaced persons remain to be evacuated. 
We expect they will be withdrawn within the next day or two.

1.(C) Summary:  In a March 25 telecon with EconOff, Aziboala 
Robert, President of Niger Delta Human and Environmental 
Rescue Organization (ND-HERO), discussed the ongoing crisis 
in the Niger Delta. End summary. 
 
 
2. (C) ND-HERO President Azibaola Robert, an Ijaw from 
Bayelsa State, whose headquarters are in Port Harcourt, 
Rivers State said that the Ijaws have planned massive 
protests in the major cities, to include Port Harcourt, 
Warri, and possibly Abuja to focus on their concerns.  The 
dates of the demonstrations are still to be determined, but, 
they could take place in the next few days.  The concerns are 
land ownership, ward delineation, oil revenue and voter 
registration.  Although the demonstrations failed to begin on 
March 23 as Robert had predicted, he said tensions are high 
within the Ijaw community and he fears that the 
confrontations could escalate into all of the states with 
Ijaw populations - Bayelsa, Delta, Rivers and even to Akwa 
Ibom. 
 
 
3. (C) According to Robert, Delta State Governor Ibori tried 
to diffuse the tensions, but the rumor of in-house  political 
problems between the Governor and his Peoples Democratic 
Party gave the appearance of a government not in control of 
the security forces not to mention the youth.  Bayelsa State 
government officials have also been ineffectual in arresting 
the crisis and, Robert stated, there is no a clear directive 
from the Ijaw leaders.  According to Robert, the elders and 
leaders lack the capacity to get out to the villages and 
out-lying areas to talk to the Ijaw youth.  He said that on 
one occasion an attempt was made to capture Ijaws suspected 
of causing problems. Community persons worked with the 
military only to find themselves targeted by the same 
military.  The Ijaws were arrested for having arms that were 
originally supplied by military to aid them in capturing Ijaw 
criminal suspects.  Based on that experience, Ijaws are 
skeptical about the military\'s intentions. 
 
 
4. (C)  Robert speculated that arms may be entering Nigeria 
from neighboring countries, in particular Cameroon via a 
direct sea route.  He further speculated that some of the 
monies paid by oil companies to the Ijaws as direct 
compensation or ransom may be used to purchase arms. 
According to Robert, the more arms and ammunition, the better 
their bargaining power.  He does not think that wealthy 
individuals either in Nigeria or abroad are supplying the 
arms for their own nefarious purposes. 
 
 
5. (C) Robert does believe, however, that wealthy people are 
working with sea pirates, robbers and criminals who sabotage 
the pipelines.  When the criminals are apprehended by the 
military, they are usually released quickly with only a small 
fine imposed. He added that in some cases, the military have 
stopped arresting people connected to certain prominent 
individuals.  He claimed to be aware of some of the 
individuals involved but would not name them. 
 
 
6. (C) The GON has recently stated that Shell Petroleum 
Development Company Nigeria Limited (SPDC) should pay the 
Ijaws of Bayelsa State USD 1.5bn  in compensation for the 
degradation to their lands and corresponding social and 
physical ills. Robert stated that his contact at SPDC told 
him that the company will not pay.   This is a sleeper issue 
that it is not yet finished, but, he predicted that there 
could be a serious conflict before the matter is resolved. 
 
 
7. (C) Robert said that the recent attack on the home of 
MOSOP President Ledum Mitee (Ref A) has all of the markings 
of an assassination attempt and not a robbery since no 
property was taken.  Mitee was not at home during the 
attempt.  Mitee is connected with various human rights groups 
in Port Harcourt. According to Robert, many people are 
unhappy with Mitee.  One week before Mitee went abroad, he 
was invited by GON\'s State Security Service for \"a chat\". 
According to Robert, Mitee was increasingly voicing concerns 
about the GON. He spoke on 93.7 radio about the murder of 
Marshall Harry (Reftels B and E), the late South-South Zonal 
Vice Chairman of the All Nigerian People\'s Party.  In 
addition, he has issued press statements about issues 
concerning the Ogoni and the GON.  He is also not in good 
odor in Bayelsa State as he was the attorney in the 
corruption case against Chief Diepreye Alameyeseigha, the 
Governor of Bayelsa State. 
 
 
8. (C) During the conversation with EconOff, Robert noted 
that the Ijaws\' grievances are with the GON and not the oil 
companies.  International oil companies, however, are a means 
to reach the GON where it hurts-in the pocketbook.  He 
predicted that an early end to the crisis is not likely to be 
forthcoming and that the Ijaws are planning further 
unspecified action.  Post will continue close monitoring of 
the crisis and its potential forlong-term  impact on the oil 
sector.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 03/30/2013 
TAGS: ECON, ELAB, KDEM, NI, PGOV 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH NLC TO DISCUSS 
UNION PLANS TO STRIKE ON APRIL 1 
 
 
1. (C) Ambassador Jeter met with the Acting President of the 
National Labour Congress (NLC), Joseph Akinlaja, on Thursday, 
March 27, 2003, to discuss, inter alia, NLC plans to begin a 
nationwide civil service strike on April 1.  Akinlaja, who is 
also General Secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), issued a 14-day ultimatum to 
the GON on March 13 to either implement a September 2002 
agreement to increase government salaries by 12.5 percent or 
face a nationwide indefinite strike by Nigeria\'s civil 
servants.  The decision to call the strike was made while NLC 
President Adams Oshiomhole was in Geneva attending an 
International Labor Organization conference.  Oshiomhole 
returned to Nigeria on March 30. 
 
 
2. (C) During the meeting, the Ambassador emphasized the 
importance of peaceful, transparent elections as the nation 
moves toward its first successful civilian-to-civilian 
transition. He expressed concern that a strike could increase 
tensions in an already volatile environment, adding that 
whatever happens in Nigeria will affect the rest of West 
Africa.  Akinlaja explained that GON mismanagement created 
the dispute; although the NLC tried to remain flexible in the 
interest of moving democracy forward, workers were no longer 
willing to make unnecessary sacrifices.  He dismissed claims 
that the GON could not afford the increase and stated that 
state governments were consulted when the decision was made 
to reduce the salary increase from 25 percent to 12.5 percent 
since many states are already behind in paying their civil 
servants.  Akinlaja assured the Ambassador that despite 
growing unhappiness among workers the NLC favors peace.  As 
many as 4000 NLC members will register to serve as election 
monitors; this fact is clear evidence, Akinlaja said, of the 
NLC\'s commitment to lead Nigeria toward free and fair 
elections. 
 
 
3. (C) Laboff spoke to Akinlaja on Monday, March 31, as the NLC 
finalized plans for the April 1 strike.  Akinlaja said the 
NLC would not call off the strike unless the GON reopens 
negotiations before midnight on March 31.  If the GON does 
not respond by midnight, civil servants will begin a 
three-day warning strike.  NLC leaders are meeting today to 
plan their next steps if the issue is not resolved by April 
4.  Akinlaja said that after the three-day warning strike the 
NLC could suspend further action until after the elections. 
 
 
4. (C) Comment: Although Oshiomhole returned to Nigeria only 
three days before the scheduled strike, he should still have 
enough time to work with President Obasanjo to defuse this 
impending strike action.  Oshiomhole has little to gain from 
a major labor crisis two weeks before the elections. While a 
three-day warning strike or symbolic protest is likely, a 
disruptive strike could exacerbate tensions and lead to 
accusations that the NLC, which has championed preservation 
of democracy, is purposely trying to sabotage the process. 
 
 
5. (C) Obasanjo may approve the increase only if he thinks the 
issue will derail the elections.  However, a GON-approved pay 
raise that state governments could not fund could be more 
destabilizing.  We therefore think that Oshiomhole will press 
for a solution that does not compromise his credibility 
within the NLC.  While a symbolic or three-day warning strike 
is probable, Oshiomhole will likely play up labor\'s 
commitment to free and fair elections in order to convince 
NLC members to postpone further action related to the 12.5 
percent increase until after the post-election transition in 
May. Oshiomhole may argue that as a quid pro quo for the 
NLC\'s deferring the strike, Obasanjo should agree to pay 
salary arrears and incremental salary increases until the 
12.5 percent agreement is fully implemented.  End Comment.

When Will the Oil Flow? Delta Crisis Update 
------------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) Although the violence that has wracked the 
Escravos region of the Niger Delta the last two weeks 
appears to have subsided, oil companies remain hesitant 
to return their employees to facilities in the swamps. 
This situation is causing Nigeria\'s crude oil 
production to be at least 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) 
below normal(ref A).  The DOE\'s Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) has put the loss as high as 
900,000 bpd. Unconfirmed reports indicate that Shell 
has told its customers that it may delay loading of 
crude oil from the region through May. 
 
 
3. (SBU) A ChevronTexaco representative told Econoff 
March 31 that the company has left a very small care 
and maintenance crew in place at the tank farm in 
Escravos, and will decide within the next two or three 
days if it is safe to begin re-staffing the facility. 
After such a decision is made, the company will ship 
food, supplies and fuel to the facility in advance of 
workers.  The representative admits the pressure to 
reopen operations is enormous, and personally discounts 
reports that ChevronTexaco or Shell Oil will wait until 
after the elections to start lifting from the region 
again.  Officials from both companies have said they 
would need specific assurances that their people would 
be safe before returning them to the Delta.  In a 
separate conversation, the Dutch Consul General told 
the ConGen that Shell is demanding those assurances 
from the highest levels of the Nigerian government and 
from leaders of the warring communities in the Niger 
Delta. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Our ChevronTexaco contact also reported March 
31 that calm has been restored in the area for several 
days, as both federal and state government officials 
negotiate with Ijaw representatives over ways to keep 
the peace.  Our contact said the federal government 
deployed additional troops to maintain order, but the 
facilities to maintain and transport the troops are so 
poor that this fact causes problems. Because the oil 
companies are sometimes asked to assist with lodging 
and moving troops, they fear they may appear complicit 
in military operations. 
 
 
5. (U) According to a Reuters dispatch, Delta State 
governor James Ibori attributes the recent attacks on 
Itsekiri villages by militant Ijaws to a government 
effort to check illegal oil bunkering.  Ibori 
reportedly claimed that prominent persons employ local 
youths to tap into oil pipelines and siphon products 
for sale on the black market.  Shell Oil is 
particularly vulnerable to such practices as it 
utilizes an extensive aboveground oil pipeline network. 
Other reports indicate that the violence broke out 
after an Ijaw ultimatum for redrawing electoral wards 
expired, after which armed youths blockading the 
Escravos River exchanged gunfire with military and 
police forces escorting vessels through the waterways 
(refs B, C). 
 
 
6. (U) Comment: While it appears that the situation in 
the swamps between Warri and Escravos has been calm for 
four or five days, the oil companies will not rush to 
return their workers to the region without greater 
assurances of safety and restoration of relative peace. 
Some Ijaw leaders have indicated a willingness to cease 
hostilities if the military refrains from retaliation 
against Ijaw villages.  But othe Ijas arecalling for 
mass action to disrupt national elecions scheduled to 
begin in two weeks, including ttacks against oil 
facilities, which so far have enerally been spared in 
the ethnic clashes.  Whie the military forces 
initially appeared unwillig to egage or pursue the 
Ijaw militants (ref D) President Obasanjo declared 
that he will bring o justice the persons responsible 
for the conflict and for the death of military 
personnel.  The ucertainty of the likely courses of 
action by theplayers creates a precarious security 
situation in the region.  The oil companies will 
carefully weigh the risk of renewed violence against 
the need to move oil out of the Delta facilities. 
Predicting how soon oil flows will return to normal 
remains as difficult as predicting the likelihood that 
peace will last in the Delta.  End comment. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Running on Empty: Refineries, Power Company and 
Consumers Face Same Plight 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
7. (SBU) Recent clashes in the Delta have highlighted 
Nigeria\'s woefully inadequate refining capacity. 
According to a Chevron-Texaco representative, the 
closure of that company\'s Escravos transfer station and 
tank farm effectively shut down the government\'s 
refinery at Warri, as it and the refinery at Kaduna 
began running on their reserves sometime last week. 
Meanwhile, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC) reported that it was forced to cut power to much 
of Lagos last week when a gas feeder pipeline that 
fuels the Egbin power plant was vandalized.  While 
Nigeria\'s aggregate refining capacity is 445,000 bpd in 
theory, chronic maintenance problems plague Nigeria\'s 
four refineries.  Consequently, Nigeria imports almost 
half of the refined petroleum products it consumes. 
 
 
8. (U) Last month, in response to worldwideincreases 
in the market price of refined petroleum products, 
suppliers diverted Nigeria\'s expected imports to higher 
paying customers.  This action caused a massive fuel 
shortage and gasoline queues not seen since Nigeria 
returned to democratic rule three years ago (ref E). 
Although the Managing Director of NNPC reportedly 
claims there is no fuel shortage, gas lines and power 
outages continue.  Angry consumers accuse filling 
station owners of employing street boys to extort extra 
money from consumers waiting in line to buy fuel.  The 
Managing Director of Mobil Oil told the ConGen that 
although his station managers control the forecourts, 
the queues of cars that stretch for blocks belong to 
opportunistic thugs selling places in line. With no 
reprieve in sight, black market fuel sellers are 
becoming increasingly prolific throughout urban areas 
like Lagos as consumers scramble to keep their cars 
running and their back-up generators for homes and 
businesses humming. 
 
 
9. (U) About two weeks ago at a meeting called by the 
NNPC, executives of the major downstream operators said 
they would not re-enter the fuel importation business 
unless the government allows for import price parity. 
The federal government sets the maximum price that can 
be charged at the pump for fuel.  The company 
executives said that to cover their costs, they would 
need to charge 37 naira per liter of gasoline, well 
above the current 26-naira pump price. Consequently, 
the NNPC remains essentially the sole importer of fuel. 
One daily paper reported last week that the NNPC lost 
52.4 billion naira ($416 million) on fuel imports in 
the first nine months of 2002. 
 
 
10. (U) Comment.  The ongoing fuel shortage and recent 
trouble in the Delta have focused new light on the 
utter inefficiency of Nigeria\'s oil refineries.  The 
crises have also rekindled discussion of the possible 
sale of these government owned enterprises to private 
downstream operators, which might then establish import 
price parity (ref E). Since the national elections are 
only a few weeks away, we will not likely see any 
movement in this direction.  The industry unions 
vociferously oppose privatization, and no government 
leader will want to be responsible for a 43 percent 
increase in consumer pump prices. End comment. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Deep Water Deals: Joint Development Zone Advances 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
11. (U) Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe are moving 
closer to developing resources in the Joint Development 
Zone (JDZ) established in the waters of the Gulf of 
Guinea.  The treaty establishing the JDZ was signed in 
2001, but disagreements over details of the treaty and 
an accompanying memorandum of understanding stalled 
progress last year. 
 
 
12. (U) Estimates of the total crude oil reserves in 
the zone range from six to ten billion barrels.  The 
treaty calls for the two countries to share most 
revenue from the zone on a 60/40 split in favor of 
Nigeria, but it must provide additional concessions to 
Sao Tome and Principe in exchange for total rights over 
the most prolific exploration bloc.  Last year, Sao 
Tome President Fradique de Menezes expressed 
dissatisfaction with the terms of the MOU and what he 
felt was Nigeria\'s slow fulfillment of other pledges. 
These disagreements were apparently resolved in 
February of this year, and seismic and exploration 
agreements are being renegotiated.  It is expected that 
nine blocs will be offered when the countries\' 
negotiators approve a licensing round anticipated in 
the coming months.  We understand that ExxonMobil has 
secured a preferential oil bloc through negotiations 
with Sao Tome and Principe.  A representative of a 
Nigerian firm, Chrome Energy and its Houston-based 
subsidiary Environmental Remediation Holding 
Corporation, told Econ staff two weeks ago that his 
company is moving forward with exploration in the zone 
(septel to follow).

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: APRIL FOOLS - NLC SUSPENDS STRIKE OF 
CIVIL SERVICE 
 
 
Ref: Lagos 673 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  Joseph Akinlaja, General Secretary of the 
National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, 
informed Laboff that the GON reached an agreement with 
the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) at approximately 0100 
hours on April 1, 2003, hours before a nationwide civil 
service strike was scheduled to begin.  A few pockets 
of workers did not get word of the agreement and 
carried out the strike this morning; word of the 
agreement has since spread to most areas.  Despite 
initial confusion, there have been no serious violence 
or demonstrations.  Akinlaja said he is certain that 
NLC leaders will suspend the strike when they meet 
today in Abuja.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole will 
hold a press conference to brief journalists on the 
NLC\'s position after union leaders review the 
agreement.  Details of the agreement will be available 
by April 2, 2003.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.  Despite the NLC\'s late night agreement, the 
national secretariat failed to send a clear signal in 
time to all state chapters to call off the strike. 
While most civil servants in Lagos and Abuja were 
informed this morning that the agreement was reached, 
small pockets of civil servants at the state level did 
not receive the news and did not report for work.  In 
Jos and Sokoto, where local radio stations announced 
that the strike had been called off, most workers 
reported for duty. 
 
 
3.  Oshiomhole\'s statement on the Hausa Service of the 
BBC this morning did not clarify matters in the North; 
he told listeners of the NLC\'s discussions with the GON 
but did not instruct workers to call off the strike. 
In Abuja, most of the streets housing government 
offices were empty this morning.  At the Federal 
Secretariat and Supreme Court, some workers attempted 
 
SIPDIS 
to force their colleagues to comply with the strike 
order.  Some of the workers who had reported to work 
capitalized on the confusion as an excuse to return 
home.  Several senior management officers remained at 
work to comply with the GON\'s instruction that workers 
from levels 7-17 are exempt from the strike.  At the 
Abuja airport, most of the offices were initially 
closed in the morning, but Aviation Minister Kema 
Chikwe reportedly instructed senior management to 
reopen the affected offices.  In Kano, the fuel 
scarcity coupled with the strike caused most workers to 
stay home.  Although some workers later reported, the 
strike had already paralyzed activities in Kano City. 
In Kaduna the strike was partially observed.  In the 
early morning, labor leaders locked out workers who 
reported for duty; by late morning, leaders allowed 
some workers to occupy their offices. 
 
 
4.  The Ambassador and Laboff are scheduled to meet 
with Oshiomhole on Thursday, April 3 to discuss the 
suspended strike, NLC efforts to resolve the 12.5 
percent wage increase dispute, and other labor issues 
leading up to the elections.  COMMENT:  We expect that 
tomorrow will return to normal, unless the purported 
agreement implodes as the sides wrangle over details. 
END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, EAIR, NI, EINV, ELNT 
SUBJECT: PLANES, TRAINS, AND AUTOMOBILES: AFRICAN MINISTERS 
DISCUSS INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS 
 
1.  Summary: The first annual African Ministerial Forum on 
Integrated Transportation (AMFIT) met in Abuja March 9 - 13. 
Ministers called for better policy coordination and private 
sector participation to help integrate African countries with 
the rest of the world.  Ambassador Jeter, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of Transportation Joel Szabat, and EXIM Bank 
 
SIPDIS 
Director Joseph Grandmaison highlighted the ways USG 
assistance is helping develop safe, secure, and efficient 
transport links in Africa.  Among other things, the ministers 
expressed support for a U.S. Aviation and Maritime Security 
Initiative to reduce the susceptibility of transport systems 
to terrorist attacks.  End Summary. 
 
 
2.  Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and Abdoulaye 
Wade of Senegal 
(whom Senegal\'s NEPAD Coordinator represented) hosted AMFIT 
2003 as an African follow-up to the International Symposium 
on Transport that USDOT had organized in October 2000. 
About twenty African ministers and hundreds of other 
representatives from Africa participated in AMFIT 2003 in 
Abuja on March 9 - 13.  Since its theme revolved around the 
impediments to the development of a continent-wide transport 
infrastructure, AMFIT\'s communique reflects a blueprint, 
however inadequate it may be, of what an integrated Africa 
transportation system might resemble. 
 
 
3. Opening the conference, Obasanjo called on the delegates 
to create an integrated Africa-wide transportation plan to 
strengthen regional and international trade ties within the 
NEPAD framework.  Ambassador Jeter, in a welcome address at 
the opening plenary session, echoed that the development of 
safe, reliable, and efficient transport links can be a means 
to foster economic development.  He said the USG donation of 
multi-million dollar state-of-the-art aviation security 
screening equipment and EXIM financing of transportation 
projects is supporting these objectives. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
DOT Helping Develop Safe, Secure, and Efficient Transportation 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
 
4.  Joel Szabat, Deputy Assistance Secretary for 
Transportation also expressed support for AMFIT\'s goals and 
gave examples of DOT\'s efforts to help governments develop 
safe, secure, and efficient transport systems.  Szabat said 
the Open Skies program has improved aviation safety and 
strengthened US-Africa air links. The USG\'s approval of World 
Airways\' beginning charter service between the United States 
and Nigeria, once authorized by the GON, will be a positive 
outcome of such cooperation, he said.  He went on that USDOT 
has helped to strengthen the Aviation and Transportation 
Ministries\' institutional oversight and security training for 
personnel in the last year. 
 
 
5.  During the conference, Szabat met separately with 
Nigerian Minister of Transport Ojo Maduekwe to discuss ongoing 
cooperation.  Szabat gave Maduekwe a copy of an environmental 
assessment of the Lagos Port Complex and said the USG hopes to help 
implement some of the report\'s recommendations.  Maduekwe 
expressed appreciation for USDOT\'s support and said he looks 
forward to cooperation. The biggest challenge facing the 
Ministry, he said, is its weak institutional capacity to 
regulate the operators and its weak grasp of the technical 
aspects of policy formulation. Szabat responded that USDOT 
can put together a program in Washington to help the Ministry 
develop an effective and independent regulatory body to 
address urban congestion. 
 
 
6.  In various workshops, USDOT aviation and ground 
transportation experts engaged African delegates on the 
importance of developing sound transportation policy.  The 
discussions focused on the need for better planning and a 
regulatory framework in which private operators might provide 
safe and efficient service to end-users.   Delegates also 
stressed the need for better coordination between countries. 
 
 
7.  USDOT succeeded in its attempt to encourage inclusion of 
an African Aviation and Maritime Security Initiative 
statement in the final communique.  Transportation ministers 
agreed to adopt and implement new International Civil 
Aviation Organization and International Maritime Association 
standards strengthening security at airports and seaports. 
The ministers said the African Union supports G-8 and APEC 
measures to tighten aviation and cargo handling procedures to 
guard against terrorism. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
ExIm Finance for Infrastructure Improvements 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
8. EXIM Bank Director Grandmaison described the Bank\'s 
efforts to provide financing for infrastructure projects 
including US-Africa air cargo links.  Grandmaison announced 
the Bank\'s approval of a $5 million loan to Overland Airways 
for the purchase of two Beech aircraft, and added he hopes 
AMFIT will generate more opportunities for the Bank in the 
multi-modal transport sector.   He challenged ministers to 
think of transportation as a concept that represents more 
than mere physical movement, adding that the concept can 
embrace sound regulatory and customs policies that encourage 
the exchange of goods.  (An example of gross inefficiency is 
the practice by Nigeria\'s Customs Service to inspect all 
imported goods.  Clearing goods through customs consequently 
takes 25 days on average.)   Grandmaison added that Nigerians 
should use the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) as a 
catalyst to develop the country\'s infrastructure.  Better air 
cargo links between Nigeria and the United States might 
enhance the competitiveness of some Nigerian goods that could 
qualify for export under AGOA. 
 
 
9.  AMFIT participants identified barriers to financing and 
possible solutions.  Many government delegates complained 
about the difficulty of accessing funds for infrastructure 
projects as a result of political instability that makes many 
countries unattractive to foreign investors.  Private sector 
representatives promoted the use of build, operate and 
transfer agreements by countries that lack the capacity and 
capital for large projects.  (Comment. Since the public 
sector dominates Nigeria\'s economy, public-private sector 
partnerships have yet to become popular.  The government 
finds relinquishing control over public enterprises 
difficult, even though it lacks the institutional or 
financial ability to implement projects.  Control over public 
enterprises often translates into easy access to resources 
for personal gain.  End comment.) 
 
 
---------------------- 
Lessons and Next Steps 
---------------------- 
 
 
10. Africa\'s transportation systems obviously need drastic 
upgrade. Nigeria\'s Transport Minister Maduekwe described the 
crrent state of Africa\'s infrastructure as a 
\"study in chaos\" characterized by the poor quality of its 
aviation, road, rail, and maritime links.  Dr. Lisa Fox of 
Harvard University tried putting a price tag on the 
consequences of such poor transport links.  She said the cost 
of transporting goods in Africa accounts for 40 percent of 
the retail value of such goods, twice the international 
average. In the absence of an upgrade, African countries may 
still find it difficult to compete internationally, even 
under preferential trade schemes like AGOA. 
 
 
11. AMFIT\'s final communique stressed the importance of 
involving the private sector in infrastructure development if 
desperately needed capital and knowledge are to be mobilized. 
 The ministers called for the institutionalization of AMFIT 
within the NEPAD structure in order to follow through on 
AMFIT\'s recommendations. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
12.  While the participants succeeded in identifying possible 
solutions to Africa\'s transport woes, how their governments 
will implement the recommendations, if all, will constitute 
the true test of their success.  The government delegates 
voiced support for all the right measures: better policy, 
regional cooperation, and private sector involvement.  The 
question remains whether NEPAD will ever become something 
more than just a vision on paper. Regardless of its long-term 
effect, AMFIT provided USG officials an excellent opportunity 
to showcase U.S. support for Africa\'s multi-modal transport 
infrastructure.

SAY THEY ARE NOT READY TO RETURN TO THE DELTA

1. (SBU) Summary:  In the informal setting of a monthly 
luncheon, oil company executives today talked about the 
crisis in the Niger River delta (refs A and B), and 
indicated the industry is in no hurry to return 
evacuated employees to the swamps.  They consider the 
loss of revenue from the closed facilities minimal in 
comparison to the risk to staff safety and property 
security that may yet occur if they restart operations. 
They also note that Nigeria\'s refineries are mostly 
closed, and the country now imports 100 percent of the 
fuel it consumes, with no end in sight to the fuel 
shortage.  End Summary. 
 
 
---------------------------------- 
No Hurry to Get Back in the Swamps 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) On April 3, ConGen attended the monthly Lagos 
American Business Luncheon. The luncheon is a venue for 
the managing directors of American businesses, mostly 
from the oil sector, to meet informally and discuss 
issues of mutual concern. Today\'s topic of discussion 
naturally gravitated toward the situation in the Delta. 
The oil executives present said that companies are 
probably losing only five to six percent of an 
estimated total loss of $25 million per day of 
production income.  They arrive at this percentage by 
deducting from total revenues the 60 percent share 
taken by their joint venture partner, the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), as well as taxes 
and other fees and associated costs.  According to 
these executives, the companies have little incentive - 
- monetary or otherwise -- to resume production before 
safety concerns are addressed.  None would speculate 
whether production would resume before the election. 
Chevron-Texaco and Shell Oil representatives have 
previously stated that, before they return staff to 
facilities in the Warri and Escravos area, the 
companies will need specific assurances from the 
government and local population that peace will be 
maintained and that the oil firms\' workers will be safe 
(ref C). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Nothing More to Give: Crude Capacity at Outer Limits 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) The executives also said the GON has asked all 
companies to produce as much crude as possible in May, 
June and July.  However, the company executives report 
that even when full production resumes, there is no 
extra capacity in the system to produce much more than 
the approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) 
that was pumped before the outbreak of violence in the 
delta.  This confirms a conversation Econoff had with a 
major oil producer representative on March 31, who said 
the GON may publicly report that there is excess 
capacity in crude oil production that may be tapped in 
the future, but in reality, the companies have little 
capacity beyond the production allocation levels 
established for each of them.  The company 
representatives stated that there is no cost-incentive 
to build-out beyond the allocation level. Post 
previously reported that Nigeria\'s crude oil output is 
at maximum capacity (ref D). 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Not from Around Here: Nigeria Now Imports all its Fuel 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) The executives reported that all of the 
petroleum products currently consumed in Nigeria are 
bought on the international market.  These imports are 
arriving at a slower rate than the berths can handle. 
It was reported that Mobil\'s tanks run dry every two to 
three days waiting for shipments. 
 
 
5. (SBU) It was said that northern Nigeria\'s supply of 
oil for refinery production and its supply of imported 
fuel comes through Chevron\'s pipelines originating in 
Escravos (ref C). Thus, surmised the executives, as 
long as Chevron\'s production is shut down, long gas 
queues throughout the country but particularly in the 
north will continue.  The refineries in Warri and 
Kaduna are completely down and technical problems are 
preventing the refinery in Port Harcourt from upgrading 
the product it has available. 
 
 
6. (U) Fuel lines were also the subject of discussion 
at the Lagos Business School monthly breakfast on April 
1.  John Pototsky, managing director of Mobil\'s 
downstream operations, reported that Nigeria\'s fuel 
shortage was due to fuel sellers failing to fulfill 
their contracts (ref E).  However, Chief Rasheed 
Gbadamosi, Chairman of the Petroleum Products Pricing 
Regulatory Committee (PPPRC), blamed the fuel shortage 
on a combination of factors namely, rejected cargo that 
did not meet Nigerian specifications, the United 
States\' purchase of available supplies when the price 
first jumped, and consumer panic-buying.  Pototsky 
echoed the fact that some consumer panic-buying is 
occurring, as demand for finished petroleum products 
rose from 21 million liters per day to 32 million over 
the course of recent weeks. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: Pototsky also reiterated Post\'s 
previous analyses, that unless fundamental change is 
brought to the downstream sector, Nigeria will continue 
to experience fuel shortages (ref C and E).  He 
identified the necessary fixes as refinery repair and 
maintenance, pipeline repairs, and market pricing for 
gasoline sales.  These issues will remain acute in the 
two weeks leading up to the nationwide elections.  If 
oil does not flow from the Delta soon, Nigeria will 
continue to lose much needed revenue as well as crude 
for its under-capacity refineries.  Gasoline queues 
will persist and perhaps increase; all of which will 
raise the already high tension levels in many 
communities throughout the country. End Comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S NIGER DELTA DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION: MIXED 
REVIEW 
 
 
1.  Summary:  The Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC) 
was established in 2001 to ensure sustainable development of 
Nigeria\'s troubled oil-producing region. Events of the last 
month in the Delta region suggest that the NDDC has failed 
to meet the test. Since 2001, the NDDC has received about 
$323 million for operations, yet the inhabitants of the 
region have perceived little change in living standards. 
NDDC officials believe the Corporation can improve their 
situation through coordination of activities of donor 
agencies in the area.  The NDDC has commissioned the design 
of an $8.5 million master plan for this purpose. However, 
development will only be sustainable to the extent that it 
supports an enabling environment for the oil and gas 
producers in the region.  The NDDC\'s propensity to implement 
projects raising its profile, the legacy it inherited of 
failed projects, its financial opaqueness, and the 
observations of skeptics suggest that the NDDC will have 
difficulty establishing itself as an effective institution 
of social stability and economic development. End Summary. 
 
 
-------------- 
NDDC\'s Mandate 
-------------- 
 
 
2.  On February 18 NDDC Managing Director Godwin Omene 
briefed EconOff on the NDDC, the challenges it faces, and on 
a master plan in progress. NDDC\'s predecessor, the Oil 
Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC), 
had been established in 1992 to administer three percent of 
Nigeria\'s total crude oil revenue for the benefit of the 
Niger Delta\'s population.  OMPADEC failed due to poor and 
irregular funding, instability of its board of directors, 
and lack of political will to complete projects, according 
to Omene. 
 
 
3.  The NDDC took up OMPADEC\'s discredited mandate on August 
21, 2001.  Its brief was broad, as the NDDC aims to 
formulate policies for the sustainable development of a 
region comprising Nigeria\'s nine oil-producing states: Abia, 
Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Imo, Delta, Bayelsa, Edo, Ondo, and Cross 
River.  This landmass covers 70,000 square kilometers and 
comprises seven forms of terrain (dry land, seasonal flooded 
land, swamps, shallow inland waters, near offshore land, and 
the deep offshore seabed). The region\'s bio-diversity is on 
par with that of Mississippi, and its population 
approximates 20 million. 
 
 
4. Although the Niger Delta accounts for about 90 percent of 
Nigeria\'s export earnings from oil production and 70 percent 
of the revenue accruing to the Federation Account, the per 
capita income of the Delta\'s inhabitants is below the 
national average of $280.  The Delta thus remains one of 
Nigeria\'s least developed regions.  The continued 
restiveness in the region is partly attributable to this 
fact. 
 
 
------------ 
NDDC Funding 
------------ 
 
 
5. Nigeria\'s constitution provides that at least 13 percent 
of the oil revenues of the Federation Account must be 
allocated to the oil producing states on the basis of a 
derivation principle.  With the concurrence of these states, 
the Federal Government theoretically allocates 15 percent of 
this funding to the NDDC.  Oil and gas producing companies 
in the Niger Delta contribute 3 percent of their annual 
operating budget to the Commission.  The Commission should 
arguably receive 50 percent of all monies due to member 
states from the Federal Government\'s Ecological Fund.  The 
NDDC is also entitled to any monies given to it in the form 
of loans or grants.  The NDDC may keep any proceeds from its 
other assets as well. 
 
 
6. Omene stated that in fact the NDDC receives only 10 
percent of its agreed allocation of the funds earmarked for 
the states from the Federation Account.  The oil companies 
pay their 3 percent contribution, minus monies earmarked for 
gas flaring expenditures.  While Omene commends the oil 
companies for their contribution, he is pushing for more 
funds. Omene said the NDDC would need three to four times 
the funds it receives annually to implement its planned 
projects. (The March 26 issue of Nigeria\'s \"The Guardian\" 
newspaper reported that NDDC has received about 42 billion 
naira ($323 million) for operations since 2001.) 
 
 
7.  As alluded to above, there is debate about which 
institution should receive Ecology Fund monies. The NDDC had 
thought that it was to receive 50 percent of the ecology 
funds, but Omene said the oil-producing states will get the 
funds directly.  He hopes that an amendment to the Act will 
change this since the NDDC wants to use these funds to drain 
plots, rehabilitate fish ponds and fresh water pools, 
restore coastal environs and lost villages, and recover 
spillage sites.  The environmental damage to be rectified, 
he said was, and continues to be, cased by flaring of 
natural gas in Nigeria, which at 50 percent of gas output is 
the highest worldwide. 
 
 
----------- 
Master Plan 
----------- 
 
 
8. Omene said the NDDC faces the challenge of designing a 
feasible yet visionary master plan. The act that established 
the NDDC calls for the corporation to implement policies 
that bear on health, education, employment, 
industrialization, agriculture and fisheries, housing and 
urban development, water supply and electric power, and 
transportation and telecommunications. The NDDC plans to 
implement its mandate through its 11 directorates. 
Collectively, they will try to coordinate the programs of 
all the international and domestic development agencies in 
the Niger Delta. Omene said NDDC consultants will encourage 
local community groups to express their needs, input that 
will become an integral component of the master plan. 
9. The NDDC has appointed two consulting firms to draft this 
plan.  German Technical Cooperation International Services, 
an arm of the German international aid agency, Gesellschaft 
fr Technische Zusammenarbeit or GTZ, is working with a 
Nigerian company, WILBAHI, on the project. The NDDC has set 
an October 2003 deadline for completing the design of the 
master plan at a cost of $8.5 million. 
 
 
------------ 
Achievements 
------------ 
 
 
10. Although the NDDC\'s consultants advised it to await 
completion of the master plan before implementing projects, 
the NDDC has initiated several to show that it is active. 
Omene said the NDDC has completed 211 projects including 
primary schools, river canals, rural electrification, and 
road construction since 2001. Another 700 projects are 
ongoing. The Niger Delta communities have high expectations 
of the NDDC, Omene said, since it has completed some of its 
predecessor\'s 1,506 abandoned projects. 
 
 
11. According to Omene, the NDDC has placed stringent 
requirements on its contractors, given its predecessor\'s 
history of waste and corruption. Those who change 
specifications or otherwise do not perform are discharged, 
not paid, or fined. Payments are made according to project 
completion stage. Large advances are not given: contractors 
receive 25 percent of the value of contracts at the 
commencement of projects. Banks must certify payments 
according to work completed.  The NDDC has 24 project 
monitors. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community 
groups, donors, state and local governments, and foreign 
governments also monitor what the NDDC does. 
 
 
------------ 
Mixed Review 
------------ 
 
 
12. The GON established the NDDC to bring peace and 
development to a troubled region. Is the NDDC living up to 
public expectations? The NDDC believes it is performing 
well, given the funds at its disposal. The oil producing 
states believe the NDDC should share more funding with them. 
NGOs tend to be critical.  We conclude that the NDDC has yet 
to meet this challenge. 
 
 
13. The Niger Delta region boasts numerous NGOs. The most 
notable is MOSOP (the Movement for the Survival of the OGONI 
People), a group that became prominent after the late 
General Abacha hanged Ken Saro Wiwa, MOSOP\'s Ogoni leader 
and eight other activists.  Other NGOs in the area include 
the Niger Delta Human and Environmental Rescue Organization 
(ND-Hero), Environmental Rights Action (ERA), and the Niger 
Delta Wetlands Center. 
 
 
14. Representatives of MOSOP and ND-HERO told EconOff they 
think the NDDC is not performing well. According to these 
contacts, the Presidency dispenses patronage through 
contracts awarded by the NDDC.  In one alleged instance, 
NDDC funds meant for a road in Rivers State were diverted to 
build a hotel in Port Harcourt. In another case, the wife of 
a state governor allegedly benefited from NDDC funds for pet 
projects. In yet another case, the Rivers State government 
claims a bypass allegedly built by the NDDC. A NGO contact 
revealed that this road existed before the NDDC was 
established; the NDDC simply reconditioned it. 
 
 
----------- 
Aid Request 
----------- 
 
 
15. Omene seized the opportunity of EconOff\'s visit to 
request USG assistance.  He said the NDDC wants to identify 
an NGO and funding to address the environmental problems 
resulting from oil and gas exploration and production. 
 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
 
16. The NDDC\'s task is enormous.  It must satisfy the needs 
of disparate local ethnic groups and communities, whose only 
bond is their increasing frustration over the lack of 
development and perceived inattention to their plight at all 
levels of government.  Their grievances include the 
marginalization of minority ethnic groups and distrust of 
the oil companies.  The NDDC must persuade these groups to 
cooperate and to create an enabling environment that can 
sustain development projects.  While it may not be evident 
to the region\'s inhabitants, development will be sustainable 
to the extent that it supports an enabling environment for 
the oil and gas producers in the region. 
 
 
17.  The NDDC\'s willingness to implement ad hoc projects, at 
times manipulated by politicians, lends credence to reports 
that the NDDC is not transparent and is incapable of 
managing itself, let alone the development of the Delta 
region. Given its predecessor\'s failures, the NDDC must 
prove itself to its Delta constituency. To succeed, the 
Corporation must engage local communities and ultimately use 
the funds entrusted to it to implement meaningful projects. 
If it does this, the NDDC will have taken steps toward 
promoting economic development and social stability in the 
Delta.  If it does not, the Niger Delta will continue to be 
an area of instability to the detriment of its inhabitants, 
the Nigerian government, and the oil and gas companies 
operating in its midst.  End comment.

RESUMES LIMITED OPERATIONS IN THE DELTA 
 
 
REFS:     A: Lagos 677 
          B: Lagos 707 
 
 
CONTAINS SENSITIVE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Contrary to recent news reports and 
statements by oil executives that companies are not 
ready to resume operations in the delta region anytime 
soon, Chevron confirmed today that it had been 
returning workers to its transfer station and tank farm 
at Escravos this week.  As of April 4, the company 
resumed crude oil production, albeit on a limited 
scale.  Full operations are not expected before the end 
of April, perhaps longer.  There is no indication yet 
of when Shell will resume operations in the Nigerian 
swamp.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Chevron-Texaco spokesperson Andrew Norman told 
Econoff that the company has returned workers to its 
transfer station and tank farm at Escravos (reftel 
677), and as of April 4, has resumed crude oil 
production from that facility.  Norman said that the 
workers are gradually bringing production online, and 
the company expects to reach 310,000 barrels per day 
(bpd) of crude oil production by the end of April. 
During this time, it will assess when it may be able to 
return its output from the Niger River delta region to 
the 440,000 bpd level maintained before the outbreak of 
violence in the area. 
 
 
3. (SBU) When pressed, Norman confirmed that the 
130,000 bpd difference is accounted for by the fact 
that, for the time being, Chevron will not re-staff the 
wells and small production facilities the company 
maintains in the swamps.  The Escravos terminal, 
located near the mouth of the Escravos River at the 
Gulf of Guinea, is larger, extensively developed and 
easier to defend.  The company is comfortable that its 
employees will be safe there now.  A statement released 
by the company quotes Jay Pryor, Chevron Nigeria 
Limited\'s managing director, as saying, \"We have been 
encouraged by the recent calm in the Western Niger 
Delta and, after receiving a number of government 
assurances on security in the area, we now believe that 
current circumstances allow for the safe return of our 
workers to Escravos and for us to restart production.\" 
 
 
4. (SBU) Norman also told Econoff that of the 
production from Escravos coming back online 
immediately, priority of output will go to the oil 
refineries in Warri and Kaduna.  These refineries have 
essentially been closed and left without crude oil 
supply after Chevron stopped pumping from Escravos (ref 
A and B).  He admits the company has been under 
pressure from the government to resume supply to the 
refineries, but insists that worker safety remains the 
company\'s chief concern.  Nigeria has been suffering 
from a serious fuel shortage for several weeks, and 
closures of the refineries have exacerbated the problem 
(ref A and B). 
 
 
5. (SBU) Norman would not speculate when crude exports 
will resume.  He noted that the company was revising 
its March and April loading schedules when the violence 
broke out, and he is uncertain exactly when and what 
volume of lifting will recommence.  He also would not 
comment on when Shell can be expected to restart 
operations, but he agreed that its situation is more 
difficult, having more operations scattered throughout 
the swamps. 
 
 
6. (U) Comment. This development is a welcome sign for 
world oil production, and it also brings needed relief 
to President Obasanjo\'s reelection bid and the national 
elections themselves.  The volatile delta situation has 
loomed large as the country gears up for national, 
state and local elections beginning April 12, and the 
protracted fuel crisis has begun to affect all aspects 
of Nigerian life and economy. The visuals of mile long 
gas lines and the resulting inconvenience around the 
country ensured that the problem was never far from 
everyone\'s mind.  If peace in the Delta ensues, and if 
Nigeria\'s refineries can alleviate some of the gasoline 
and diesel shortage, the chances will be better for the 
elections to be conducted peacefully, and Obasanjo may 
be able to claim some credit.  Nonetheless, even when 
Chevron reaches its new target production goal of 
310,000 bpd from Escravos, Nigeria will still be losing 
almost a half-million bpd from the region.  That 
translates into a significant loss of national revenue, 
and continued world market interest in what\'s happening 
in Nigeria. End Comment.

SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  WARRI CRISIS - AN ITSEKIRI LEADER\'S 
ADVICE FOR THE PRESIDENT 
 
 
1.  Summary: On April 5 EconOff met Chief Rita Lori-Ogbebor, 
an Itsekiri leader and a princess of the Warri Kingdom. 
Chief Ogebebor is one of 6 Itsekiri leaders preparing for an 
April 7 meeting with President Obasanjo and their Ijaw and 
Urhobo counterparts.  They will try to resolve the 
continuing ethnic problems in the Niger Delta that have 
resulted in loss of life and property, and closure of 
foreign oil company operations.  End summary. 
 
 
2. On April 5, Chief Ogbebor told EconOff that the meeting 
with the President is a result of her efforts to involve him 
in a meaningful way to halt the hostilities in the Niger 
delta region.  The main issue is land ownership, she said. 
According to Ogbebor, the Olu of Warri is the traditional 
guardian of the lands that comprise the 600-700 year-old 
Kingdom of Warri. The Ijaws, according to Ogbebor, were \"sea 
nomads\" who sailed along the coast from Ghana to Cameroon 
fishing and selling their catch to Itsekiri women who re- 
sold it in market places. Ogbebor stated that the Ijaws do 
not have a homeland and no one knows from whence they 
originated. 
 
 
3.  Chief Ogbebor said she wants President Obasanjo to ask 
the Ijaws what they want, from whence they came, and what 
proof have they of their origins and attachment to Warri 
land.  She stated that she plans to \"remind him\" of his 
responsibility to ensure that all Nigerians can safely 
conduct legitimate economic activity and have their rights 
respected.  To this end, she is pleased with the presence of 
the military forces in the Delta since they protect the 
Itsekiris from Ijaw attacks.  Should the results of the 
meeting with the President be unsatisfactory, Ogbebor said 
she will issue a 21-day ultimatum that states that if the 
President does not control the Ijaws, the Itsekiris will 
have no choice but to engage in armed struggle.  In that 
event, the Itsekiris\' land will no longer be a part of Delta 
State since they will establish their own state. 
 
 
4.  Ogbebor disclosed that there is nonetheless disagreement 
within the Itsekiri camp.  She and other like-minded 
activists advocate recourse to armed struggle to resolve the 
conflict with the Ijaws.  But The Olu of Warri has failed to 
provide firm direction and his hesitancy to authorize action 
is one of the reasons, she said, why so many Itsekiris have 
been slaughtered. 
 
 
5.  Because continuing violence has forced large numbers of 
Itsekiris to flee their homes, many of them will be unable 
to vote in the upcoming elections.  Ogbebor concluded from 
this that the Ijaws are attempting to control the elections 
through ethnic cleansing.  She requested USG assistance 
(tents, boats, food, clothing and fishing nets) to help the 
displaced Itsekiris return to their homes to vote.  She 
further asked that the USG help establish a Commission for 
the Safety of Minority Rights.  Ogbebor has written to the 
United Nations and plans to go to New York within two weeks 
to seek UN intervention. She will argue, she said, that the 
Ijaws are engaged in genocide against the Itsekiris. 
 
 
6.  Comment:  Chief Ogbebor\'s plan to have President 
Obasanjo challenge the Ijaws\' right to a place in the Niger 
Delta certainly won\'t advance the peace agenda.  However, 
her interpretation of the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict reflects 
the fact that many of Nigeria\'s ethnic problems are rooted 
in squabbles over land rights and the debate about who is 
Nigerian. That said, we suspect that the real issue in this 
instance is not about control of the much-polluted land and 
water in the Delta region, but rather over the much bigger 
question of oil wealth and who benefits from it, an issue in 
which all Nigerians have equity.

CONFLICT 
 
 
Ref:  Lagos 736 
 
 
1.  Summary: On April 6, EconOff heard the Ijaws\' side of 
the story regarding their longstanding conflict with the 
Itsekiris, the subject of reftel.  The Ijaws argue that they 
have a legitimate claim to the land in and about Warri.  Our 
Ijaw interlocutor, who acted as if he spoke for the Ijaws 
collectively, disclosed impatience with negotiations to 
resolve the conflict.  He said the Ijaws have concluded an 
agreement with ChevronTexaco that will enable a modus 
vivendi.   The same cannot be said for the relations between 
the Ijaws and Nigerian military forces in the region. 
Should they interfere with the April 12 and 19 elections, 
the Ijaws will be prepared to oppose force against force. 
End summary. 
 
 
2.  Doyah Tiemo, an Ijaw leader and former banker and 
financial consultant, spoke with EconOff on April 6 about 
the Ijaw-Itsekiri conflict.  Tiemo asserted that the 
conflict is about land ownership, as did an Itsekiri contact 
(reftel).  He blamed the Itsekiris, whom he said claim 
exclusive ownership to Warri and its environs and look upon 
Ijaws as settlers or migrant tenants, terms he considers 
derogatory.  According to Tiemo, the Itsekiris found the 
Ijaws already in place when the former arrived in the Warri 
area.  Tiemo said the Ijaw\'s have been in the region since 
1450 so they cannot be characterized as  \"settlers\". The use 
of the terms tenant or settler thus impedes peace, he said. 
Tiemo asserted that the Ijaws helped the Itsekiris establish 
themselves in the area when it became necessary for the 
first son of the Oba of Ilua to leave Benin.  The Ijaws then 
provided land to him and his 70 chiefs and all settled in 
the Warri area. 
 
 
3.  Tiemo doubted that a meeting between members of the 
Ijaws, Itsekiris, and Urhobos on the one hand, and President 
Obasanjo on the other hand, would take place on April 7 
because the Ijaws had reservations about the list of 
invitees. The Delta State government compiled the list of 
the delegates for the meeting with the President, Tiemo 
said.  Some of the Ijaw youth groups oppose the Ijaw elders 
who figure prominently on the list, people whom they feel 
have sold them out. The youth are also unhappy that the 
proposed delegates have yet to deliver results from 
negotiations on their behalf.  Furthermore, the delegates do 
not appear to have a clear mandate from the Ijaw community 
with respect to what it should expect from the meeting. 
 
 
4. Tiemo said relations between the Itsekiris and Ijaws 
might improve if more local government areas (LGA) were 
established and if they would in turn allow for the economic 
development of areas by the respective ethnic groups.  This 
would mean that the different groups could have their own 
assemblies at the state level.   Tiemo\'s plan calls for the 
creation of three additional LGAs to bring the total to six. 
The Istekiris and Ijaws would then control three LGAs each, 
and a seventh LGA would serve as a central unit and be 
composed of Ijaws, Urhobos, and Itsekiris. 
 
 
5. Tiemo disclosed deep-seated Ijaw grudges against the oil 
companies operating in the region.  He stated that the 
companies \"undermine\" the Ijaws even though most of the oil 
wells are on their land.  One complaint Tiemo mentioned 
against the oil companies is the alleged insufficient number 
of Ijaws on their work force.  To rectify this situation, 
ChevronTexaco recently agreed to employ as permanent staff 
an Ijaw from each of the ten communities per year for the 
next five years, he said. 
 
 
6.  Contrary to the Itsekiri viewpoint (reftel), Tiemo does 
not welcome Nigeria\'s military presence in the area.  He 
opined that should the military forces intervene in the 
conduct of the elections, they will encounter resistance 
from the Ijaw boys, a group of young men 15-20 years old. 
He said the Ijaws are numerous, know the terrain, and are 
better equipped than the military forces in the area.  The 
Ijaws have GSM phones, satellite phones, mobile radio 
equipment, and automatic weapons.  (Comment:  Indeed, both 
the oil companies and the Nigerian military have admitted 
that the Ijaws are far better armed than they realized. End 
commen). 
 
 
7.  Tiemo concluded the discussion by reaffirming the Ijaw\'s 
claim to the land disputed by the Itsekiris.  He added that 
all the ethnic groups in the area have to live together 
peacefully since Warri and its environs are the mainstay of 
the country\'s economy.   But making his point that arms and 
other combat equipment are in the hands of Ijaw youth, he 
boasted that most members of the Ijaw community contribute 
money to support them and, with money, the boys have no 
difficulty obtaining what they want.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOUTHWEST POLITICS UPENDED AS 
POLL DEADLINE APPROACHES 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY.  The April 19 gubernatorial and 
presidential election will be a remarkable test of 
incumbent power-players and ethnic politics in the 
Southwest.  After stunning defeats in the National 
Assembly elections on April 12, the Alliance for 
Democracy (AD) is fighting for its political life. 
Free and fair or not, the public will judge the 
relative strength of candidates and entrenched 
interest groups from the outcome.  Although the AD 
is encouraging its supporters to cast a protest 
vote against Obasanjo, such action is unlikely to 
deny Obasanjo victory in the southwestern states. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEKEND? 
--------------------------- 
 
 
2.  (U) In the Southwest, the April 19 poll will 
especially test the strength and relevance of 
Afenifere, the most prominent Yoruba socio- 
cultural interest group.  Afenifere leadership has 
long served as a rallying point for Yorubas. 
Following the April 12 National Assembly election, 
Afenifere met with the six Southwest governors, 
all of whom belong to the AD, to review the 
results.  In that election, the AD lost nearly all 
of its National Assembly seats to the national 
ruling party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP). 
Apart from AD\'s success in Lagos State, last 
weekend\'s polls marked the first time since 
Nigeria\'s independence that a mainstream Yoruba 
political party has fallen in the Southwest. 
Unable to fathom a tenable reason for this poor 
showing, the Afenifere-AD leadership concluded 
their failure was the PDP\'s handiwork.  They 
alleged that the PDP manipulated the electoral 
process and intimidated their supporters. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
WHAT\'S NEXT?  WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
3.  (U) Top Afenifere and AD leaders, led by 
Senator Abraham Adesanya, met on April 14 with 
President Obasanjo to protest \"massive rigging\" of 
the National Assembly election.  They demanded 
that the President address the matter quickly or 
risk losing the Southwest\'s support.  The group 
warned it would not hesitate to direct its 
supporters--i.e. the extended Yoruba nation--to 
cast protest votes against Obasanjo and vote 
instead for the AD.  NOTE:  As the AD did not 
field a presidential candidate of its own, under 
election rules, such ballots should not count as 
valid votes but should be reflected in the 
\"rejected votes\" total.  The damage to Obasanjo 
would be that the votes he expected from the 
Southwest would be reduced, forcing him to make up 
his count elsewhere.  If, however, the AD 
persuades voters to cast their lot with another 
candidate, especially Buhari, Obasanjo could face 
a much stiffer contest in the Southwest that would 
also make the nationwide vote count more 
competitive.  END NOTE. 
 
 
4.  (U) Afenifere\'s threat raises significant 
questions about its power in Southwest politics. 
Do Afenifere leaders really control the Southwest, 
as they often claim?  If last week\'s National 
Assembly election was not rigged as they claim, 
did it reflect a new Southwestern political 
reality?  If so, what is this new reality?  Did 
the Southwestern electorate throw its weight 
behind the PDP to signify solidarity with 
incumbent President Obasanjo, whom they failed to 
support in 1999?  Or, as international observers 
witnessed in some areas, were Yoruba voters 
confused about how and for whom to vote in last 
week\'s National Assembly election as opposed to 
this week\'s presidential election? 
 
 
5.  (SBU) Afenifere and AD will not give up 
without a fight.  They may do everything in this 
week\'s election that they accuse the PDP of having 
done last weekend--rigging, thuggery, bribery, 
manipulation--to counter a repeat attack by such 
means.  Senator Adesanya has already warned that 
the AD will forcefully resist any attempt to rig 
the coming election.  The Southwestern governors 
have all spoken along the same lines.  AD leaders 
may also engage in legal actions.  Such desperate 
measures might yield results favorable to AD in 
Lagos and Oyo states, but may not make a 
meaningful impact in Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, or Ogun 
states. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) COMMENT.  This Saturday\'s election could 
provide convincing proof of the true state of 
affairs in the Southwest.  We believe the most 
likely scenario is that Afenifere leaders have 
lost much of their former control.  But, if 
governors in such states as Ogun, Ekiti, and Osun, 
where the AD lost nearly everything last week are 
returned to power this weekend, then Afenifere is 
right and truly in charge.  If the Obasanjo-PDP 
performance on April 19 drops from their 
impressive showing on April 12, then something 
really went wrong for the AD last weekend, and 
their accusations of rigging carry more weight. 
The Southwest should be where the action is this 
election round.  END COMMENT.

--------------------------------------------- -- 
Slowly but Surely: Delta Oil Operations Ramp Up 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
2. (U) ChevronTexaco and Shell Oil continue to ramp up 
their crude oil production in the Niger River delta, 
after local ethnic violence forced them to close 
operations in mid-March.  Chevron continues to aim for 
an end of the month production target of 310,000 
barrels per day (bpd) (reftel A), down from 460,000 bpd 
it produced prior to the closures.  A spokesperson for 
Chevron told Econoff on April 17 that the company is 
producing near 300,000 bpd. Shell Oil publicly stated 
it had been producing 18,000 bpd from its affected 
facilities during the first week of April, and a 
Reuters report indicated that it may soon reach 100,000 
of the 320,000 bpd shut-in, if it is not already doing 
so.  Shell produced about 460,000 bpd before the 
clashes between Ijaw militants and Itsekiri villagers, 
which ultimately led to the shutting-in of some 800,000 
bpd from the region for more than 10 days.  Shell 
reportedly has rescheduled its April exports. 
 
 
3. (U) The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
reports that Nigeria\'s crude oil exports to the United 
States fell from 798,000 barrels per day in January to 
494,000 bpd in February, ranking it as the sixth 
largest source of imported oil to the U.S. for the 
month, behind Mexico, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and 
Venezuela.  While February 2003 exports exceeded last 
year\'s February numbers by some 50,000 bpd, these 
exports occurred prior to the clashes in the Delta, 
which shut in some 40 percent of Nigeria\'s overall 
crude production. 
 
 
4. (U) Meanwhile, the delta region appears to have 
remained mostly calm in recent weeks and through the 
first two rounds of national elections.  Acts of 
violence were reported prior to the April 12 National 
Assembly elections, and deaths were reported on April 
13 after a gun battle erupted between militants and the 
military during an attempt to hold delayed elections in 
some Delta State local government areas (LGA).  Prior 
to the elections, President Obasanjo held a meeting 
with a number of Warri area chiefs and traditional 
leaders from different ethnic groups in an attempt to 
restore peace and find a lasting solution to the 
ongoing tension.  No disruption to oil production was 
reported as a result of election-related violence.  The 
Chevron spokesperson told Econoff on April 22 that the 
Escravos area remained quiet through the elections thus 
far, with a presence of about 200 military personnel in 
the area.  Tension may rise with local elections 
scheduled for May 3, as the original flare-up between 
the Ijaw and the Itsekiri was based on disputed 
electoral boundaries for local government 
representation (reftel B).  But, Chevron\'s spokesperson 
believes the group assembled by President Obasanjo is 
making progress toward reaching an accord. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Between the Lines: Fuel Shortages Continue During 
Elections 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
5. (U) During this historic election period, Nigerians 
are finding themselves waiting in lines, but not just 
at their polling stations.  Fuel queues remain 
commonplace throughout the country, albeit on a more 
sporadic basis than experienced in February and March. 
Reliable and definitive explanations for the ongoing 
shortages are difficult to come by, as various players 
in the downstream industry blame one another, and new 
events continue to overtake GON efforts at resolving 
the situation. 
6. (U) At first, inopportune domestic refinery 
maintenance, combined with the opportunistic diversion 
of gasoline shipments bound for Nigeria to more 
lucrative U.S. and Venezuelan markets, resulted in a 
serious fuel shortage across all of Nigeria (reftel C). 
Because the GON mandates an artificially low pump price 
for fuel products, private marketers withdrew from the 
import business, leaving the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as the sole importer of 
fuel (reftel D).  NNPC professes that it has now 
brought in enough fuel and is moving it through its 
subsidiary, the Pipelines and Products Marketing 
Company (PPMC), and accuses depot managers and 
marketers of diverting fuel from designated supply 
routes and filling stations to sell on the black market 
to those willing and able to pay higher prices. 
 
 
7. (U) In addition, according to a Lagos-based 
financial risk consulting firm, Nigerian drivers, 
sensitive to the ongoing fuel shortage, now generally 
insist on filling their tanks as often as possible, 
compared to a pre-crisis habit of keeping, on average, 
only a third of a tank of gasoline in their cars. 
Financial Derivatives Company reports that this trend 
has pushed up daily demand for gasoline from 19 million 
liters to 32 million.  Furthermore, ongoing trouble in 
the delta region has reduced Nigeria\'s already 
inadequate domestic refinery production and makes it 
even more unpredictable. Just as Chevron brought its 
Escravos terminal back online and started pumping crude 
oil to the refinery in Warri, vandals blew up a supply 
pipeline to the refinery, again halting its production 
and that of the refinery in Kaduna. 
 
 
8. (U) Nigerians now face sporadic and unpredictable 
fuel queues.  In Lagos, stations close less often and 
for shorter periods of time than a few weeks ago, but 
consumers must still wait in gasoline lines at least 
several days a week, and black market sellers hawking 
fuel street-side from jerry cans and plastic jugs still 
appear during crunch times.   Embassy Econoff, 
traveling through northern Nigeria to Plateau state 
during the National Assembly elections April 12, 
reported fuel openly being sold in filling stations at 
70 to 120 naira per liter (the government-imposed price 
is 26 naira per liter).  AmConsul Econoff traveling in 
the Southeast through Anambra and northern Delta states 
noted extensive fuel queues during the weekends of both 
the legislative and presidential and gubernatorial 
elections, the latter having taken place April 19.  In 
the Delta State capital of Asaba, cars were simply left 
in place unattended in the roadway from all directions 
approaching gas stations for what appeared to have been 
several days at a time.  Even the drivers of the 
ubiquitous motorbikes used for public transport were 
forced to crowd en masse at fuel stations, sometimes 
leaving their cycles parked at the gates until gas 
would be sold again. 
 
 
9. (U) While some of this shut-down may have been due 
to government efforts to limit movement and commerce on 
election day, Econoff\'s driver reported difficulty 
finding fuel along the way from Lagos to Port Harcourt 
two days prior to the legislative elections, and in the 
Asaba-Onitsha area on either side of the Niger River 
during the presidential and gubernatorial elections. 
Most stations were not open the Sundays following each 
election day, and queues formed as early as 6:00 a.m. 
on the Monday after Easter, a Nigerian national 
holiday. One independent fuel station owner in southern 
Anambra state told Econoff that he was forced to sell 
his gasoline at higher than sanctioned prices because, 
since late January, he has been able to buy only black 
market stock from his distribution depot at premium 
prices, and at irregular intervals.  He lamented the 
situation and said he saw no end in sight.  The station 
was closed when Econoff returned to the area two days 
later.  President Obasanjo reportedly stated during a 
presidential debate sponsored by the Nigeria Labour 
Congress on April 16 that the current government-fixed 
pump price of 26 naira per liter of gasoline cannot be 
sustained, but did not propose a specific price 
increase and did not indicate a government commitment 
to one. 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Fits and Starts: NEPA Privatization Continues 
While Power Capacity Expands Amidst Crises and Outages 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
10. (U) In late March, the Bureau of Public Enterprises 
(BPE) announced that the federal government had 
approved the naming and delineation of 18 new companies 
to be derived from the National Electric Power 
Authority (NEPA).  This follows the work of the 
National Council on Privatization (NCP), which in 
August 2002 recommended the creation of six power 
generation business units, 11 distribution units, and 
one transmission unit.  A spokesperson for BPE relesed 
a statement indicating the transmission company is to 
be named Nigerian Electricity Transmission Company 
Limited, and headquartered in Abuja.  Generating 
companies are to be based essentially on current power 
stations, and the distribution companies will cover 
regional areas and population centers generally 
according to existing operations.  It is unclear when 
the sale of these companies will take place.  The 
National Assembly passed an energy reform bill, which 
could clear the way for the sales, but we have seen no 
sign that President Obasanjo will sign the bill before 
it expires. 
 
 
11. (U) Meanwhile, the federal government has boasted 
of an increase in power capacity, but many communities 
continue experiencing power outages and load shedding. 
NEPA\'s managing director, Joseph Makoju, reported in a 
newspaper interview that, due to the rehabilitation of 
both thermal and hydro generating units, the company 
now has a power generation capacity of 4,800 megawatts 
(mw), but averages between 3,000 and 3,300 mw of 
output. 
 
 
12. (U) Specifically, NEPA and government officials 
report that the Egbin Thermal Power Station on the 
outskirts of Lagos has all six of its turbines 
operational for the first time in ten years. 
Unconfirmed reports put Egbin\'s production at about 
1,600 mw, but recently it produced as little as 600 mw 
when a natural gas line supplying the plant was cut 
during the ethnic crisis in Warri.  Further, the Daily 
Trust newspaper reported that NEPA officials have 
admitted that power interruptions in the Abuja region 
will continue throughout 2003, due to insufficient 
transmission capacity in relation to population growth. 
Work has begun on new transmission lines throughout 
Rivers state, and there appears to be progress on 
expanding power supply in Bayelsa state.

Comment 
------- 
 
 
13. (U) Comment. As we have commented time and again in 
recent weeks, all the developments reported here may be 
greatly affected by the ultimate outcome of the current 
elections.  Some analysts expect the pace of 
deregulation and privatization of different facets of 
the energy sector to increase dramatically in a second 
Obasanjo term.  Everyone is waiting to see if peace in 
the Delta will be maintained, and what effect the 
outcome of the elections will have on efforts to build 
sustainable mechanisms to ensure such peace and foster 
further development.  Tough decisions regarding fuel 
import price parity, the scope and nature of 
privatizing state owned enterprises, and the 
intergovernmental distribution of oil revenues were 
delayed pending the nationwide elections.  Now, the 
relative political strength of the winners, and the 
public\'s reaction to their victories, will be our first 
indications of where the Nigerian energy sector is 
headed in the second-half of 2003, and perhaps beyond. 
End comment.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, PHUM, PINR, KDEM, ASEC, SOCI, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SOUTH-SOUTH ELECTION LOSERS PLAY WAITING 
GAME 
 
 
Classified By: POL-ECON CHIEF JOSEPH GREGOIRE.  REASON:  1.5 (B & D). 
 
 
 1.  (C) SUMMARY.  In Nigeria\'s South-south, all six of the 
incumbent governors of the ruling People\'s Democratic Party 
(PDP) had their reelection confirmed by the Independent 
National Electoral Commission (INEC) after the April 19 
election.  The degree of election tampering varied starkly 
across and within the region\'s states (details to follow 
septel).  Similarly, the losing parties are engaging in 
divergent tactics in response to the reported outcomes, 
ranging from \"if you can\'t beat \'em, join \'em\" to \"let\'s 
bring back military rule and attack the oil companies.\" 
Though cause for monitoring, most of the losers\' rhetoric can 
be dismissed as bluster.  The likelihood of their grievances\' 
being redressed by legal or extralegal means is slim at best. 
 Delta, Edo, and Rivers states offer comparative examples of 
the major themes reverberating from the losing parties\' 
drums.  Meanwhile, the generality of the population they 
profess to represent may disengage from politics at least 
until 2007, when they may next have a chance to elect 
representative candidates.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
-------------------- 
THE BAD: DELTA STATE 
-------------------- 
 
 
2.  (C) THE PROCESS: Both the national legislative elections 
on April 12th and gubernatorial-presidential elections on the 
19th displayed marked variation between the inland areas and 
the riverine and coastal areas of Delta State.  Within the 
capital\'s local government areas (LGAs), elections were 
conducted reasonably well; in the swamps, elections were 
essentially a sham (septel to elaborate on Poloff 
observations in Delta). 
 
 
3.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: Governor James Ibori\'s 
runner-up was Chief Great Ogboru from the Alliance for 
Democracy (AD) ticket.  In his most significant statement so 
far, Ogboru denied having declared victory, but stopped short 
of conceding defeat.  Ogboru\'s statement followed the 
announcement that police were investigating him for falsely 
claiming victory before the INEC results were announced, and 
the State Security Service (SSS) reportedly invited him for 
an interview as well.  Police arrested five suspects, 
including the radio station proprietor and his staff, for 
allegedly airing news that Ogboru had won in Effurun on the 
20th. 
 
 
4.  (C) At least one defeated AD candidate, Sunny Uwode of an 
Ethiope constituency, was arrested.  Other unsuccessful 
candidates have called for cancellation of the National 
Assembly election results and the removal of Police 
Commissioner John Ahmada.  The All Nigeria People\'s Party 
(ANPP), a major competitor though less visible in Delta as an 
adversary than in other states, has launched its share of 
contests against the polls.  ANPP\'s House of Representatives 
candidate for Warri, Bolatsi Omatseye Dudu, petitioned the 
state INEC after elections were postponed in his district, 
but has yet to receive word that any will be rescheduled. 
TheIgbo-based All People\'s Grand Alliance (APGA), whic had 
a measurable showing in the national legisltive and 
gubernatorial elections, has been less ocal in Delta about 
contesting its losses. 
 
 
-------------------- 
THE VERY BAD: EDO STATE 
----------------------- 
 
 
5.  (C) THE PROCESS: The PDP construed its overwhelming 
victory over th ANPP\'s competition as evidence that the 
party\'s core support is limited to the North.  Observers 
noted major irregularities from the capital through the 
outlying areas.  During the months leading up to the 
elections, many of the PDP\'s rival politicians asserted 
having been the subjects of assaults, arrests, and 
intimidation. 
 
 
6.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: No united front is likely to 
challenge the outcome of Edo\'s gubernatorial election. 
Governor Lucky Igbinedion\'s main challenger was ANPP\'s 
Senator Roland Owie, followed by the AD\'s Dr. Odion Ojo, the 
National Conscience Party\'s (NCP) Osagie Obayuwana, the 
United Nigeria Peoples Party\'s (UNPP) Dr. Clement Alile, and 
the NDP\'s Harry Igiehon.  The ANPP in Edo has been torn for 
months by internal wrangling.  Nowa Omorogbe, special 
assistant to the Governor\'s wife, told Poloff, \"One of Owie\'s 
competitors from the ANPP\'s gubernatorial primaries, Matthew 
Urhoghide, has already publicly accepted the Governor\'s 
reelection.  We think Owie will eventually accept it too.\" 
In the meantime, the course Owie\'s camp appears likely to 
take is to publicly denounce the elections as flawed, and see 
the reaction they get without hoping for much result.  Owie\'s 
party agent Isaiah Osifo, who was \"manhandled\" and his \"life 
threatened by PDP loyalists\" at the state collation center, 
thought the PDP should have left him to \"celebrate the 
decision of his conscience while they went about celebrating 
their victory.\"  (Osifo was himself a PDP member until 
defecting to ANPP in March.)  Another Osifo, Eddy Ehi Osifo, 
gubernatorial candidate of the Movement for Democracy and 
Justice (MDJ), publicly rejected the election results on 
April 23, but said he would focus on ways to counter fraud in 
future elections rather than contest the outcome of the last 
elections.  In short, the PDP anticipates that some of the 
competition \"will write to the courts,\" but \"nobody will take 
to the streets.  If they do, they will be arrested.\" 
 
 
--------------------------------- 
THE VERY, VERY BAD: RIVERS STATE 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
7.  (C) THE PROCESS: In Rivers, poloffs witnessed outright 
rigging and ballot stuffing throughout the state in both the 
national legislative and the gubernatorial-presidential 
elections.  Massive vote rigging took place with the 
egregious collaboration of PDP agents and security personnel. 
 In no LGAs did foreign or domestic observers find the 
process remotely approaching free or fair elections. 
 
 
8.  (C) CONTESTING THE OUTCOME: The major challenger to 
Rivers Governor Peter Odili was ANPP\'s Chief Sergeant Chidi 
Awuse.  He may seek redress via the courts, but does not 
share the Rivers State ANPP secretary\'s radical minority 
viewpoint that \"the army should take over the country and 
people should start blowing up oil pipelines in Rivers 
State.\"  Some candidates from the losing parties have already 
decamped to the PDP, such as House of Assembly aspirant from 
the National Democratic Party (NDP) Benibo Granville.  Saying 
the elections in Rivers thus far have been \"free but not 
fair,\" Granville decided to follow former NDP gubernatorial 
candidate Dumo Lulu Briggs, who withdrew from the race.  The 
\"high level of corruption inherent in Nigerian political 
elections, which adversely affected all the opposition 
parties\", provoked Lulu Briggs\'s decision.  Other parties 
are weighing the merits of pursuing what appears to be a lost 
cause by contesting the election outcomes, against the 
potential gains to be had from supporting the party that 
cheated them. 
 
 
9.  (C)  ANPP\'s other losing candidates have decided to take 
their cues for further action from the party\'s national 
leadership. ANPP collective stance is that no elections have 
taken place to date in Rivers.  Ben Naanen, ANPP senatorial 
candidate for Southeast Rivers, confirmed to Poloff his 
belief that no elections took place in his constituency on 
April 12 and characterized the election as President 
Obasanjo\'s \"civilian coup d\'etat.\"  (The only ward where 
Naanen carried the vote was in his stronghold of Ogoniland, 
where President Ledum Mitee of the Movement for the Survival 
of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) resides.) Although Naanen feels 
the losing candidates are not obliged to accept the outcome, 
he intends to follow whatever course of action is charted 
from the ANPP\'s top leadership and General Buhari.  This 
would not extend, however, to Buhari\'s reported calls for 
military intervention.  \"I can\'t imagine ANPP calling for a 
military coup,\" Naanen said.  \"We wouldn\'t support that.\" 
 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
 
10.  (C) The South-south holds Nigeria\'s most critical 
resources, the arteries of the Federal Government: oil, gas, 
and a few refineries, ports and export-import processing 
zones.  The PDP-controlled GON is unlikely to tolerate legal 
challenges to the PDP\'s victories in the region.  The 
question of INEC and the judicial system\'s impartiality 
aside, the losing candidates\' potential recourse is limited 
(septel to follow on judicial system\'s preparations for 
election challenges in court). South-south public opinion 
seems to be leaning toward acknowledging the futility of 
challenging the outcomes if not agreeing with the PDP 
victory.  Without popular backing for a massive challenge to 
the outcome of the elections, the losing parties are unlikely 
to get far. 
 
 
11.  (C) COMMENT CONT\'D. We do not think it unwise for us to 
dismiss most of the defeated candidates\' rhetoric as bluster. 
 They know that the likelihood of their grievances\' being 
redressed by legal or extralegal means is slim at best. 
Those who might persist in challenging the election outcomes 
outside of the courts would almost surely face arrest on 
grounds of sedition or risk violent encounters with armed 
personnel, ranging from military forces in Delta\'s Warri and 
Escravos areas to police and state security throughout the 
South.  Menwhie the PDP will continue to consolidate its 
power i the coming weeks.  The electorate will react by 
hoosing one of three options: mounting organized eforts to 
sway the state and local governments toard policies they 
favor, looking to 2007 as thei next chance to elect 
representative candidates,or disengaging from politics with 
apathy.  Unfortunately, the last option is apt to be the 
choice f the much-abused population.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: YORUBA CONTROL OF SOUTHWEST POLITICS A 
THING OF THE PAST? 
 
Classified By: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL JOSEPH GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B 
 
 
) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (U)  Summary.  Ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 
sweeps in recent legislative and gubernatorial elections show 
that rule of \"old line\" leaders of the mainly-Yoruba Alliance 
for Democracy Party and the Yoruba socio-cultural 
organization, Afenifere, has ended.  Five of the six States 
in the southwest have gone to PDP and a younger group of 
politicians.  This may signal a more progressive governance 
in the region, at least for the near term.  End Summary. 
 
 
Licking the wounds 
 
 
2. (C)  Leaders of the largely-Yoruba Alliance for Democracy 
Party (AD) and the Yoruba socio-cultural organization, 
Afenifere, met four days after the April 19 presidential and 
gubernatorial elections to try to muddle together a position 
in the face of the AD\'s astonishing defeat in five of the six 
southwestern States they had controlled since the elections 
of 1999.  The group issued a resolution rejecting the 
election results but stopped short of threats of court 
challenges that other politicians have made.  Instead, they 
stated that the validity of the elections and the 
determination of the rightful winner would be left to the 
\"tribunal of God and the court of public opinion.\"  The 
resolution also rejected reports that AD National Chairman 
Ahmed Abdulkadri had officially conceded a presidential 
victory to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate and 
current President, Olusegun Obasanjo.  Trying to find someone 
to blame for the debacle, an AD source told PolOffs that some 
in the group accused Abdulkadri of being in cahoots with the 
PDP to the detriment and destruction of the AD. 
 
 
3. (C)  AD and Afenifere have given the media a list of 
alleged irregularities in the  April 12 legislative elections 
and the April 19 gubernatorial elections.  (AD did not field 
a presidential candidate, and thus, has no standing to 
challenge that election.)  The leaders of the two groups were 
to have met again on April 24th to consider what action they 
will take with respect to this matter, but sources have told 
PolOffs that the decision is unlikely to contradict the 
decision already taken, i. e. not to challenge the elections 
in court.  Ironically, the PDP is apparently going after the 
one southwestern State it did not capture, Lagos State.  The 
losing candidate, Funso Williams (PDP), has submitted a 
petition charging gross irregularities in the gubernatorial 
election that went to AD Governor Bola Tinubu.  Although some 
irregularities were reported by all elections observers, 
there appears to be little chance that Williams\' challenge 
will succeed. 
 
 
What happened and what\'s next? 
 
 
4. (C)  Consulate sources and most media observers blame the 
AD and Afenifere current troubles on complacency.  Since the 
First Republic, AD (evolving from the Yoruba base in 
predecessor organization like the United Party of Nigeria and 
the Social Democratic Party) and Afenifere had an easy time 
of marshaling support of the Yoruba in the southwest.  This 
was so much so that many observers still refer to the region 
as the \"monolithic\" southwest.  However, beginning with the 
elections of 1999, leaders of the group apparently became 
over-confident and began to neglect the constant care and 
feeding necessary to sustain a loyal constituency.  Added to 
this, Afenifere began to try to reshape itself as a political 
organization, if not superior to AD, then at least AD\'s equal 
in demanding Yoruba loyalty.  Obansanjo, a Yoruba and PDP 
candidate, won neither the hearts nor the votes of Yorubas in 
the southwest and got no support from Afenifere in 1999.  As 
a consequence, he is reportedly behind the formation of the 
Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) in 2001.  The YCE, widely 
regarded as the tool of Obasanjo, publicly eschews any 
political aspirations and claims its focus is only 
\"socio-cultural.\" 
 
 
5. (C)  An aide to Governor Tinubu told PolOff that leaders 
of AD would be meeting during the next months to shape a \"new 
AD\" and a \"new Deal\" for the Yoruba.  With five of the 
governors in the southwest heavily financed, solidly backed 
by the majority party and ready to make names for themselves 
and their party, AD will have a difficult road ahead.  Media 
observers have commented that the new bloc of young Yoruba 
governors will no longer be directed by the \"politics of 
gerontocratics\" of the old leaders of any political party and 
Afenifere has lost its influence over this generation of 
political leaders.  Some observers have pointed to the 
assassination of Justice Minister Chief Bola Ige, a strong 
opponent of Afenifere\'s mixing in politics, as the point 
where Yorubas began to lose faith in both the AD and 
Afenifere. 
 
 
State by State 
 
 
6. (C)  Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu was always expected 
to be retained in office.  Despite grumbling from some losing 
candidates, Tinubu has already begun to consolidate his win 
by accepting congratulations from opponents and beginning to 
pay off campaign debts.  In Ondo State age, in the person of 
incumbent Adebayo Adefarati, bowed to the relative youth of 
PDP candidate Dr. Oluegun Agagu.  Although, Adefarati had 
made no statement rejecting or accepting defeat to date, 
Agagu has already published a victory message and solicited 
\"suggestions from the people to improve the State.\"  Chief 
Bisi Akande, in Osun State is apparently the only loser to 
step aside gracefully.  One day after Prince Olagunsoye 
Oyinlola (PDP) was declared the winner, Akande set up a 
seventeen member transition team to handle the turn-over to 
his successor. 
 
 
7. (C) The biggest surprise upset came in Ogun State where 
Governor Olusegun Osoba was unseated by Otunba Gbenga Daniel. 
 Osoba was expected to win re-election because he had turned 
in the best performance of any of the southwest governors 
except Tinubu.  He was  described by observers as a superb 
politician campaigning tirelessly across the State and 
drawing large enthusiastic crowds.  He was also reported to 
have the support of the traditional rulers in Ogun.  However, 
as soon as Daniel was declared the winner and President 
Obasanjo sent a congratulatory message, the traditional 
rulers hurried to congratulate Daniel, too, and urge the 
loser to \"accept defeat in good faith and the spirit of 
sportsmanship.\" 
 
 
8. (C)  After the April 12 legislative elections showed PDP 
making big inroads into AD\'s southwest power base, many 
projected that of the six vulnerable governors, Lamidi 
Adesina of Oyo State would most certainly lose his job. 
Adesina had lost support of the Oyo citizens by failure to 
deliver government services, alienating local leaders, and 
lavishing government money and jobs on his friends and 
family.  As predicted, Adesina lost to rival Senator Rasheed 
Ladoja of the PDP. 
 
 
9. (C)  Following the April 12 legislative loses, Governor 
Niyi Adebyo, charged out with renewed vigor to wage a 
week-long, door-to-door campaign to save his seat in tiny 
Eketi State.  Although a close race down to the finish, 
Adeboyo lost to PDP\'s Peter Ayo Fayose.  There has been no 
word from either camp on whether the election will be 
challenged or accepted. 
 
 
10. (C)  Comment.  Nigerian voters in this series of 
elections appeared to be more enthusiastic about their 
ability to affect government by their votes.  Political 
parties, especially the AD, were taken by surprise that 
voters would not only complain about bad government but come 
out in significant numbers and stand in the hot sun or 
driving rain to vote to make changes in their leadership. 
The new governors and legislators now have four years to 
prove that the voters were right to trust democracy, and the 
voters have four years to see that they can have change if 
the new leaders fail to deliver.  AD and Afenifere leaders 
seem to have rejected, however, any notion that their ousting 
from southwest seats of power had any direct link to voter 
preference.  They claim that fraud alone explains their poor 
showing in the elections.

SUBJECT: PAS LAGOS CELEBRATES EARTH DAY 2003 
 
 
REF: State 086844 
 
 
1.   SUMMARY: On April 24, PAS Lagos organized a 
  lecture and panel discussion at our auditorium to mark 
  the 2003 Earth Day celebration.  Two panelists 
  delivered addresses on the occasion, the PAO and CAO 
  each introduced short films on the environment, and the 
  IRC distributed colorful Infopacks to provide guests 
  with additional material to stimulate deeper reflection 
  and discussion.  Earth Day posters, the 10-year 
  anniversary series as well as the 2003 set, adorned the 
  lobby and the auditorium.  We awarded Earth Day posters 
  to our first 15 guests.  END SUMMARY. 
2.   Approximately 70 guests attended the PAS Lagos 
  Earth Day event.  With help from the Educational 
  Advising Center (EAC) staff, we were able to reach a 
  younger audience.  Ten students, both high school and 
  undergraduates, were in attendance.  A large delegation 
  from the Lagos State Government attended, including the 
  Director of Environmental Services and a 1997-98 Hubert 
  H. Humphrey fellow.  EXXON/Mobil\'s Director of External 
  Affairs, academics and journalists also participated in 
  the program.  The bulk of the audience came from the 
  NGO sector. 
3.   PAS invited Melissa Cline, the ECONOFF who holds 
  post\'s environment portfolio, to be one of the featured 
  panelists.  Recently returned International Visitor 
  Folashade Jaji was the second panelist and in part 
  shared what she had experienced during the \"Sustainable 
  Economic Development and Environmental Protection\" 
  program, which took place in January 2003.  Jaji 
  currently leads the Lagos State Ministry for Women\'s 
  Affairs and Poverty Alleviation.  Given her portfolio 
  and recent IV experience, Jaji has briefed the State 
  Ministry for Environment on key issues. 
4.   Cline spoke on land use and regulation, at times 
  comparing critical issues in Lagos to those in her 
  hometown, Washington, DC.  She presented a clear five- 
  point plan to help NGOs, planners and other 
  stakeholders best achieve their goals for sustainable 
  and successful development.  Cline emphasized that all 
  stakeholders (i.e., government, NGOs, businesses and 
  academics) must develop a common agenda in order to 
  achieve a measure of success. 
5.   Jaji spoke about the spirit of volunteerism that 
  she witnessed in the U.S. and how it that spirit has 
  empowered American society, especially in the areas of 
  sustainable development and environmental awareness. 
  Jaji then re-capped her recommendations to Lagos State 
  on how to encourage safe growth in such a rapidly 
  expanding urban area.  \"Smart Growth\", she remarked, 
  did not necessarily mean \"no growth.\"  In one 
  potentially controversial comment, Jaji also urged the 
  Nigerian government to remain open to genetically 
  modified foods, insisting that they are not detrimental 
  to one\'s health.  Her brief explanation of Lagos 
  State\'s Waste-To-Wealth program helped demonstrate how 
  byproducts of construction need not be dangerous to the 
  environment. 
6.   A very lively discussion took place after the 
  panelists\' presentations.  One guest raised the 
  challenges of raising the environmental consciousness 
  of the poor when they are confronting basic survival 
  issues such as clothing, feeding and housing their 
  families.  Many participants urged the USG to 
  \"pressure\" the Nigerian government to respect 
  internationally recognized best practices in 
  environmental management.  Ms. Cline opined that 
  Nigerian NGOs were much better placed to undertake a 
  sustained environmental advocacy campaign. 
7.   BACKGROUND: Nigeria has ten cities with over 1 
  million inhabitants and as such, the nation\'s urban 
  environmental challenges are unique in sub-Saharan 
  African.  Nigeria\'s urban population now equals its 
  rural population; this is an entirely different reality 
  from just a few years ago.  Lagos is not the only city 
  in Nigeria with severe waste and urban sprawl problems, 
  but with a population approaching 15 million, it 
  unquestionably represents the most acute.  PAS 
  deliberately asked panelists to focus on urban issues, 
  and Lagos turned out to be an ideal city in which to 
  hold the event. 
8.   COMMENT: It was interesting to note how many 
  participants, from panelist Jaji to a high school 
  student to an NGO representative, seemed to glorify 
  \"the good old days\" of environmental awareness under 
  the former military regimes which ruled Nigeria until 
  1999.  Many of them reminisced about the time when 
  Saturdays were dedicated to home clean-ups and 
  Thursdays dedicated to market clean-ups.  Audience 
  members seemed to appreciate the discipline that the 
  past military regimes required from the population on 
  cleanliness and orderliness and counted these two 
  attributes as losses under the current dispensation. 
9.   PAS launched this event as a \"celebration\" of 
  Earth Day and was not certain how it would turn out. 
  However, PAS was pleased that despite the Easter 
  holiday, election season and rains that morning, 
  turnout was encouraging, and even more reassuring, 
  participants were extremely interested in talking about 
  these issues.  The program ran a half-hour over the 
  programmed time because several participants insisted 
  on making their points.  Many guests requested copies 
  of the speeches delivered, and others extolled the 
  importance of networking, all guests\' contact 
  information be circulated.  In response to this, the IO 
  circulated copies of Cline\'s speech as a press release 
  as well as making it available the next day on the 
  Embassy\'s website.  The CAO also started an email list 
  of all attendees and encouraged them to work together. 
10.  While our Earth Day celebration was a success and 
  PAS will certainly plan events for future years, it 
  might be helpful if more resources are made available 
  for Posts.  While the announcement cable on Earth Day 
  was comprehensive, the websites were not greatly 
  helpful, and PAS had to scramble to find any audio- 
  visual material that was appropriate, in the end using 
  a clip from a 1995 VOA-produced film to at least 
  explain the origins of the day. 
11.  CONCLUSION: Top officers from the Lagos State 
  Government made commitments to do more to ensure a more 
  environmentally -friendly Lagos.  Participants thanked 
  Post for bringing the environmental issues raised to 
  the their attention and for providing a forum for them 
  to learn from the U.S. experience and form a network to 
  protect the Nigerian environment.  NGOs shared valuable 
  information.  Participants agreed to work towards a 
  healthy and sustainable environment in Nigeria and 
  mentioned planning to have a follow-up program.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: OIL WORKERS THREATEN STRIKE IN RESPONSE 
TO ALLEGED TRANSOCEAN DISMISSALS 
 
 1.  Peter Akpatason, president of the National Union of 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers of Nigeria (NUPENG), has 
threatened to call \"a national strike wherein the entire oil 
industry will be shut down\" unless Houston-based Transocean 
Inc. rescinds the dismissal of 116 Nigerian workers who 
participated in a wildcat protest aboard several offshore 
rigs in April. The protesters held hundreds of Transocean 
employees hostage, including twenty-one Americans, during the 
two-week standoff. 
 
 
2.  In addition to the layoffs, Akpatason accused Transocean 
of discrimination, citing the company\'s use of helicopters 
to carry expatriates to oil rigs while transporting Nigerian 
workers in poorly maintained boats.  He said NUPENG is 
\"ready to face the consequences\" as the union prepares to 
disrupt the producing, servicing, refinery, distribution, and 
upstream sectors. 
 
 
3.  Joseph Akinlaja, General Secretary of NUPENG, told 
Laboff that he has been involved in private discussions with 
the Port Harcourt zone of NUPENG regarding the potential 
strike.  However, he was surprised to learn that Akpatason 
had already issued a public statement without first 
consulting him.  Akinlaja expressed concern that Akpatason 
made the remarks out of anger, adding that a strike action 
cannot take effect until the National Executive Council of 
NUPENG endorses it. 
 
 
4.  Akinlaja and Akpatason departed Lagos for Memphis, 
Tennessee on May 17 for a two-week workshop for union 
leaders.  Akinlaja said a NUPENG strike action in their 
absence is highly unlikely.

SUBJECT: THE BIRTH OF PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN NIGERIA: 
A NEW HOPE FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM? 
 
Background: 
 
 
1.   Nigerian universities, once among the best in 
Africa, deteriorated badly under 30 years of military 
rule.  Nor was their plight alleviated during the last 
four years of democratic governance.  They remain 
overcrowded, poorly funded and decrepit. Currently, 
there are 42 universities: 25 federal, 12 state, and 7 
private.   The universities are supervised by the 
National Universities Commission (NUC), a coordinating 
body that sets academic standards and allocates 
budgets. 
 
 
2. Plagued by insufficient funds, student and faculty 
strikes, and leadership crises, public universities are 
in constant turmoil.  Students continually strike over 
payment of small annual fees for housing and meals. 
Faculty members protest late salary payments, poor 
teaching conditions, and low budget allocations for 
education (1.85 percent of the 2003 budget).  A 5-month 
strike called by the academic staff union in December 
is finally ending as universities gradually re-open. 
 
 
A New Challenge to Universities: Student Cults 
 
 
3.    Over the past decade, student cults have caused 
a breakdown of law and order on university campuses and 
are now endemic.  A perverted form of terrorism, 
disruption seems to be their only goal.  Cultists 
engage in murder, anarchy, arson, rape, and ritual 
killings that often force universities to close. 
 
 
4.   The Obasanjo Administration has cracked down on 
cults, and several students, lecturers and  Vice- 
Chancellors have been expelled or suspended for 
participating in cult activities.  Anti-cultism 
billboards are erected on every campus and in nearby 
towns.  Students and community groups organize 
theatrical productions and other public events to 
campaign against cults. Still, the problem persists and 
is one more challenge for public universities. 
 
 
Private Universities: An Alternative System in the 
Making? 
 
 
5. Five years ago, the NUC approved eight private 
universities.  Supporters hailed their arrival as a 
\"renaissance\" in higher education while critics saw 
their existence as \"cheapening and commercializing\" 
higher education in Nigeria.  Nonetheless, the 
perennial disruption of public universities has made 
private universities a much sought-after alternative 
for parents and students. 
 
 
6. Four of the five private universities are church - 
affiliated, and all are located in southern Nigeria. 
Predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria has yet to open a 
private university although Heritage University in 
Kaduna, sponsored by former military dictator General 
Ibrahim Babangida, was one of the first private 
universities approved. 
 
 
7.    All but one of the universities offer moral 
teachings along with academic courses and an emphasis 
on community service.  These universities are much 
better equipped than their public counterparts and more 
advanced in technology, administration and academic 
development.  They have plans for an annual meeting and 
a joint sports and cultural festival.  Though gradually 
increasing, enrollments in these private universities 
represent less than one percent of the total population 
of university students. 
 
 
8. Tuition at private universities ranges between 
$3,000 to $5,000 -- an enormous sum of money in a 
country where the average annual income is $300. 
Still, many wealthy parents, when unable to send their 
children abroad, are now turning to private 
universities as the only institutions where a student 
can complete a Bachelor\'s degree in four years. 
 
 
8.   The number of private universities may grow in the 
  future.  On May 28, one day before the Obasanjo/Atiku 
  inauguration, the NUC awarded a license to ABTI 
  University in Adamawa, the home state of Vice President 
  Atiku. Three additional universities are already 
  approved, and applications for seven new universities 
  are pending.  Thus, there are potentially ten new 
  private universities that could eventually join the 
  five currently operating universities. 
9.   Following are brief descriptions of the private 
universities currently functioning.  Note that the NUC 
lists two other universities besides the following five 
on its list: The Pan-African University, an extension 
of the prominent Lagos Business School, yet to 
officially open; and the Benson Idahosa University in 
Benin City, about which PAS was unable to find 
substantial information. 
 
 
Private Universities: A Description of the Big Five: 
 
 
10.   Igbinedion University in Edo State was the first 
private university to be established.  It matriculated 
the 3rd set of students (about 2000) in May 2003 and 
plans to establish a Postgraduate School in the near 
future.  Igbinedion\'s College of Medicine is the first 
in a private university to be accredited by the Medical 
and Dental Council of Nigeria.  In addition to its own 
resources, the university receives financial support 
from foreign individuals, organizations and 
foundations. 
 
 
11.   Bowen University in Osun State developed from the 
Nigerian Baptist College(a teacher training institute). 
Barely a year old, it has over 500 students and three 
faculties. It is funded by the Nigerian Baptist 
Convention and operates on a shoe - string budget.  It 
has yet to establish substantial ties with Baptists 
elsewhere.  Located in a rural Muslim community, Bowen 
has been well received. 
 
 
12. Babcock University in Ogun State is affiliated with 
the Seventh Day Adventist church.  Like Bowen, it has 
three major faculties.  But, it has more facilities, 
courses and teaching faculty than Bowen.  Babcock has 
established links with several local and international 
foundations and agencies that have contributed 
generously to its development. Founded in 1914 by 
American Missionary David Babcock, Babcock is modeled 
on American universities and has Nigeria\'s only known 
work-study program.  Students run its highly developed 
agricultural plantations, food services program and 
maintain its attractive campus grounds. 
 
 
10. Madonna University of Science and Technology 
in Anambra State is affiliated with the Catholic 
church.  The Catholic faith is practiced by over 80% of 
Nigerians in the East and dates back to the 
establishment of Catholic churches, convents and 
schools in the post-slave trade era.  Madonna is a 
product of its regional surroundings, reflecting not 
only the predominant religion but also the preference 
of indigenes for technical and industrial subjects. 
 
 
11. Covenant University, just outside of Lagos, is 
funded by Pentecostals.  The campus is built on 
\"CanaanLand\" and attached to its enormous chapel. Like 
the chapel, Covenant was built entirely by volunteer 
labor and took only a year to construct.  Affiliated 
with Oral Roberts University in the U.S., Covenant held 
its first matriculation ceremony early this year and 
has over a thousand students in three faculties and 
twenty departments. 
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
 
12. Whether or not they represent the future of 
Nigerian higher education, a sort of Nigerian Ivy 
League or just something entirely different, private 
universities are on the rise and are attracting 
international attention and support.  Right now, a 
degree from the University of Ibadan or Amadou Bello 
University is more prestigious than a degree from any 
of the private universities.  However, if upheaval 
continues in the public universities this may change. 
Private universities are not perfect -- they have their 
own administrative problems, and there is a report of 
cultism at Babcock -- however, their emergence has been 
a positive development in Nigerian higher education 
that bears watching.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: YORUBA LEADER PA ADESANYA\'S VIEWS ON 
STATUS OF AD, AFENIFERE, YCE, AND US-NIGERIAN RELATIONS 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. Leader of Afenifere and member of the 
Patriot\'s group, Pa Abraham Adesanya, says that the April 
elections must be canceled and an interim government 
installed until \"free and fair\" elections can be held. He 
claims Afenifere is not seriously weakened after the defeat 
of many Alliance for Democracy (AD) candidates in the 
elections, and that the organization will continue to promote 
the political issues that concern Yorubas.  Adesanya defends 
Afenifere as the true mouthpiece of Yoruba political 
aspirations and stoutly denies that any other group, 
including the rival Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), can 
adequately represent pan-Yoruba interests.  Adesanya\'s 
claims notwithstanding, the elections gave both Afenifere and 
the AD a jarring blow.  With the Peoples Democratic Party 
(PDP) having swept the Southwest, President Obasanjo has 
emerged as the preeminent Yoruba politician, casting a large 
shadow over territory that, until April, seemed like the 
exclusive domain of Afenifere and the AD.  End summary. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
The Patriots propose five-year term limits...again 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
 
2. (U) On May 23, a group of prominent, mostly Southern, 
Nigerians, the \"Patriots\", issued a press statement calling 
for Nigerians to reject the results of the April 19 
Presidential and National Assembly elections.  The statement 
contended that the elections were so riddled with 
irregularities that a government based on such fraud would be 
\"a disservice to democracy.\"  The group called for a one-year 
interim government comprised of political party 
representatives and \"other interested groups\" that would rule 
Nigeria until \"free and fair\" elections would be held. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Afenifere is not dead, not even wounded 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (U) PolOff met with Chief Pa Abraham Adesanya, head of 
Afenifere (pan-Yoruba social and cultural organization), 
member of the Patriots, former Senator from Ogun State, and 
among the leaders who formed the AD party.  The octogenerian 
Adesanya asked for a meeting at his home, as he was 
recovering from an illness and under doctor\'s orders to \"get 
some rest.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Adesanya adamantly rejected the prevailing verdict 
that Afenifere had lost its clout in the southwest after the 
defeat in the April/May elections of almost all AD 
candidates.  According to Adesanya, Afenifere, is and will be 
the only organization to pursue issues of concern to Yorubas 
worldwide.  He also rejected the notion that AD is a party 
for Yorubas and the southwest States only and pointed out 
that the party has other objectives in different parts of the 
country and for different constituencies.  He noted the facts 
that AD had fielded opposition candidates in the Hausa north 
as well as the Igbo southeast, and that the Igbo candidate, 
Chief Nnanna Uzor Kalu, was one of the few AD winners.  As 
for the notion that the elections revealed Afenifere as a 
moribund organization for old Yoruba men, Adesanya declared 
that any Yoruba, male or female, young or old, could join 
Afenifere.  (Comment. Adesanya\'s statements that Afenifere 
has an open membership and a pan-Yoruba scope may be true. 
However, a harder truth was that Afenifere and the AD were 
routed by the PDP in this last election.  Additionally, the 
criticism from the Southwest about electoral irregularities 
has, so far, been mild relative to the decibels heard from 
the Northwest and Southeast.  Afenifere and the AD have not 
even been able to marshall enough strength to complain 
vigorously. This is not only a sign of weakness of both 
groups, but also an acceptance of the election results in the 
Southwest.  End comment.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Liars, traitors and the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
5. (C)  Adesanya became even more acerbic when asked about 
the relationship among the AD, Afenifere and the YCE.  He 
said that the YCE is comprised of disgruntled Afenifere 
members who \"crawled away\" in opposition to his being named 
leader.  He continued, saying that the YCE is not really made 
up of Yoruba \"elders\", and has an age threshold of sixty for 
membership that it does not strictly impose. \"Some of their 
members are in their fifties and even their forties,\"  he 
complained.  According to Adesanya, he was lied to by a 
founding member of the YCE, Judge Adewale Thompson.  Adesanya 
says he met with Thompson when the first rumors were 
circulating that a break-away group was forming.  He says 
that Thompson assured him that no such group would be formed. 
 He asserted that elderly founding members of Afenifere 
(notably ninety-year old Anglican Archdeacon Pa Emmanuel 
Alayande) were \"tricked\" into supporting the YCE.  Adesanya 
is totally opposed to a multiplicity of groups representing 
the Yoruba, saying the \"selfish traitors\" of the YCE will 
only bring \"trouble into the fold of the Yoruba.\" 
 
 
6. (C) (Comment. The YCE was among the first to criticize the 
Patriots\' interim government proposal.  In a statement to the 
Guardian newspaper, a YCE spokesman called the Patriots plan 
\"an invitation to anarchy.\"  The spokesman also said that the 
YCE considered the April/May elections \"the freest and 
fairest in the history of Nigeria.\"  The YCE position is not 
surprising. The organization is the brainchild of late 
Attorney General Bola Ige.  Since Ige\'s demise, President 
Obasanjo and his allies have progressively taken control of 
the YCE.  Now the YCE, backed by the weight of the President 
and by PDP electoral gains in the Southwest, is ready to 
challenge Afenifere for the mantle of the preeminent Yoruba 
organization. End comment.) 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
The \"so-called\" elections and US-Nigerian relations 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
7. (C) Seeming to gain more energy with each new topic, 
Adesanya asked PolOff how the US could congratulate the GON 
on an obviously rigged election and continue relations with 
any government formed by fraud.  PolOff informed him that US 
Mission goals in Nigeria included supporting stable political 
and economic growth for Nigeria, and that the USG had 
congratulated only the Nigerian people on conducting the 
elections and on the transition from one civilian government 
to a successor without the military interventions and 
violence of the past.  Adesanya retorted that his complaint 
against the US was that \"your economy and trade are placed 
above anything else.\"  He continued, saying \"I take all your 
promises and pronouncements with a grain of salt, because I

8. (C)  Adesanya said he met with President Olusegun Obasanjo 
before the elections in April and had promised that the 
Southwest would be peaceful. He also promised Afenifere and 
AD support for Obasanjo, a Yoruba.  Adesanya said that, 
because of his pact with Obasanjo, Yorubas did not protest 
election irregularities, implying that it was he, not 
Obasanjo\'s power and influence, that staved off unrest in 
the Southwest.  He added that AD National Chairman Alhaji 
Ahmed Adamu Abdulkadir, who had at first endorsed the results 
of the elections then recanted, was unable to speak for the 
Yorubas.  He said Afenifere had opposed Abdulkadir\'s 
appointment from the very beginning because Abdulkadir was 
not a member of any of the founding organizations of the 
party.  Abdulkadir was \"surreptitiously\" brought in by a 
group of \"traitors\" and Adesanya refuses to accept him as 
Chairman of AD.  He added that Afenifere will not support any 
\"new\" AD party led by Abdulkadir. 
 
 
9. (C) Comment. Adesanya has been a prominent politician for 
decades.  He is respected as an elder statesman by Yorubas 
and non-Yorubas.  His views have in the past and will 
continue to have influence in the Southwest.  However, that 
influence may be on the wane thanks to the elections that put 
Obasanjo, the PDP and the YCE in a more advantageous position 
in the Southwest.  For many observers, Pa Adesanya 
personifies what may be a problem with Afenifere and what led 
to the AD\'s electoral meltdown--that it is controlled by 
octogenarians, out of touch with the younger generation of 
Yorubas who would rather support a Yoruba already in power 
than someone who is more ethno-centric but has no chance at 
national power.  Despite Pa\'s protestations that Afenifere 
and the AD are not ailing, President Obasanjo now casts a 
formidable shadow over the Southwestern real estate the two 
groups once controlled. End comment.

SUBJECT: Attempted Coup in Anambra State: Harbinger of 
Things to Come? 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  A mid-July attempt by a cadre of 
business and political leaders to surreptitiously 
unseat a recently-elected state governor has created an 
ongoing political imbroglio and leaves Nigerians and 
Nigeria watchers asking if, instead of the military 
coups of the past, leaders here now face gangster-style 
threats to their power and safety.  Chris Ngige is back 
in power in Anambra state, but for how long and to what 
extent remains to be seen.  \"Coup\" plotters have been 
expelled from the ruling party and mostly removed from 
office, and prosecutors publicly state their intention 
to pursue criminal charges.  Meanwhile, a federal court 
has issued an injunction barring Ngige from acting as 
governor, pending a lawsuit filed by those who 
attempted to oust him.  President Obasanjo and his 
closest advisors have remained mostly out of the public 
fray, but the botched \"civilian coup\" continues to keep 
his party and political leaders at both the federal and 
state level reeling.  End summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Introduction.  On July 10, Chris Ngige, governor 
of Anambra State, was taken into custody and held 
incommunicado by police officers led by Raphael Ige, 
Assistant Inspector General of the national police for 
the region.  Simultaneously, State Assembly Speaker 
Eucharia Azodo delivered to legislators a purported 
letter of resignation from Ngige, and the Anambra State 
Assembly assented to the swearing-in by the state 
attorney general of the deputy governor, Okey Udeh, as 
new governor.  Later in the day, Ngige managed to call 
supporters and denied that he had resigned.  He was 
eventually released and regained control of the state\'s 
affairs the following day. 
 
 
3. (SBU) April pre-electoral environment. Anambra State 
has long been the setting for particularly 
dysfunctional politics, and past events presaged what 
occurred on July 10. Former Governor Chinwoke 
Mbadinuju\'s relationship with the State\'s power brokers 
had been as difficult as any during the last decade. 
Initially beholden to political godfather Sir Emeka 
Offor, Mbadinuju had refused to toe the line during 
1999-2003, essentially at the expense of the common 
people.  The closure of schools for a year, salary 
arrears stretching ten months, and chronic 
individualized and group violence characterized the 
Anambra State pre-electoral environment in April 2003. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Changing of the Guard.  Given Mbadinuju\'s 
unwillingness to comply with the wishes of the ruling 
power brokers, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) 
twice blocked his re-election bid for governor early in 
2003. Three weeks before the April 19 gubernatorial 
election, the PDP chose Ngige to run against several 
contenders including Peter Obi of the All Progressives 
Grand Alliance (APGA), who by some accounts would have 
carried the vote had it not been for fraud perpetrated 
by the PDP.  Pre-election side-deals with party power 
brokers represented the price Ngige had to pay for PDP 
support.  These deals would have benefited business 
mogul Chris Uba, the most recently self-anointed 
kingmaker in Anambra State.  Following Ngige\'s 
questionable victory (which his rival is contesting), 
Uba expected to name Anambra State commissioners and 
other prominent members of the state government, as 
well as members of Ngige\'s personal staff.  Uba also 
anticipated lucrative contracts and payment of three 
billion naira (approximately $24 million USD), which he 
said Ngige owed for services related to his election 
victory. Reports indicate Uba intended to arrange for 
Ngige to eventually cede the governorship to Deputy 
Governor Okechukwu Udeh.  Ngige publicly admitting 
having signed a letter of resignation and preparing a 
videotaped resignation before he took the oath of 
office. 
 
 
5. (SBU) Settlement of political debts.  Uba had thus 
expected deference and a free hand to conduct business 
as usual.  Once in office, Ngige punctured Uba\'s 
expectations, failing to make expected payments and 
maintaining control of the auspices of the governor\'s 
office.  Uba responded by sending Ngige\'s purported 
letter of resignation to the Speaker of the Anambra 
House of Assembly, Eucharia Azodo, who is Uba\'s cousin. 
Expecting to reap benefits from this raw power play, 
the House quickly legitimized the attempted coup and 
designated Deputy Governor Udeh, Governor. Meanwhile, 
Assistant Police Inspector General Raphael Ige 
dispatched 200 anti-riot police to Ngige\'s office, 
abducted him, and held him in the hotel where he 
resided until Ngige called for help via an unnoticed 
cell phone.  Subsequent media reports generated a 
public outcry that facilitated Ngige\'s return to office 
on July 11. 
 
 
6. (SBU) The Presidency and the PDP.  In testimony 
before an investigative committee of the Senate, 
Governor Ngige stated that Inspector General Ige told 
him the orders to restrain him came from \"the big men\" 
in Abuja.  However, immediately after it appeared that 
the attempted coup in Anambra State had failed, the 
Presidency and the PDP denounced it. (Comment. A 
recurring complaint heard by Emboffs is that Obasanjo 
did not personally condemn the attempt, but only said 
\"differences should be handled within the party.\"  End 
comment.) We have heard that at the insistence of VP 
Atik, the PDP dismissed the putschists from the party, 
and PDP governors called for a judicial commissio of 
inquiry to probe the botched abduction of Ngge. 
Professor Itse Sagay, a well-known constitutonal 
lawyer in Lagos, has suggested that such a tep would 
only serve to postpone and delay the cause of justice. 
What the country faces, he said, s not a political 
crisis, but a crime against th Constitution. 
 
 
7. (SBU) Critics at large.  In letters to the editors 
and other channels, critics have roundly condemned the 
bungled coup.  They consider it an affront to 
democracy, and many wonder how long Nigeria will 
continue to be held hostage by \"money-bags\" who care 
little about their people\'s general welfare.  For 
example, novelist and political commentator Okey Ndibe 
told Econoff that the link between the attempted ouster 
of Ngige and President Obasanjo is clear.  Ndibe, a 
former Fulbright scholar, resides mostly in the U.S. 
but writes for the Guardian newspaper while in Nigeria. 
Ndibe insists that Uba\'s wealth, his business dealings 
with Stella Obasanjo, the President\'s wife, and his 
brother\'s status as one of Obasanjo\'s personal 
assistants gives him easy access to the President, who, 
according to Ndibe, knew full well that members of his 
party were planning an ouster of an uncooperative 
governor.  Ndibe wrote a scathing editorial to this 
effect on July 17 in the Guardian. 
 
 
8. (U) Possible legal actions.  Section 1(2) of the 
1999 Nigerian Constitution stipulates that \"the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria shall not be governed nor shall any 
part thereof, except in accordance with the provisions 
of the Constitution.\"  And Section 41(B) of Nigeria\'s 
Criminal Code stipulates \"any person who forms an 
intention to effect the removal of a governor of a 
state during his tenure in office is guilty of a 
felony.\"  Relying on these provisions, Bukhari Bello, a 
constitutional lawyer and Executive Secretary of the 
National Human Rights Commission, states there is 
enough evidence to bring charges of treason against Ige 
and others.  Many of the players may benefit from 
immunity, however.  Section 308 of the 1999 
Constitution protects Deputy Governor Udeh from 
criminal and civil prosecution, if not investigation, 
unless he is impeached; currently an unlikely prospect 
given the extent of support he received from the state 
Assembly. 
 
 
9. (SBU) Political accommodation.  On July 14 Obasanjo 
met with twenty-one PDP governors to review 
developments in Anambra State, and the next day he 
invited key players to Abuja.  On July 17 the PDP\'s 
National Working Committee dismissed from the party 
several of the actors involved in the attempt to remove 
Ngige from office, including Deputy Governor Udeh and 
Speaker of the Assembly Azodo.  The Anambra State 
Assembly also removed Azodo from the Speaker\'s chair. 
According to Presidential insiders, Police Inspector 
General Tafa Balogun ordered Assistant Inspector 
General Ige to retire, a rather cosmetic gesture since 
Ige had planned to retire soon, and reorganized the 
security teams assigned to the Government House in 
Anambra.  Anambra state prosecutors have stated they 
intend to file criminal charges against the plotters 
behind the governor\'s kidnapping and attempted removal. 
But on July 22, Justice Wilson Egbo-Egbo of the Federal 
High Court in Abuja issued an injunction preventing 
Ngige from acting as governor, and the PDP from taking 
action against the coup plotters, until a hearing is 
held on a lawsuit filed by Uba.  Ngige vowed to ignore 
the ruling as inoperable against a sitting governor. 
Earlier, the PDP leadership had also censured Ngige, 
expressing \"deep disappointment\" with his 
\"comportment.\" 
 
 
10. (SBU) Comment.  Chris Ngige is a medical doctor by 
profession and a political novice.  He may be back in 
charge of Anambra State, but given the scope of the 
plot against him, it is unlikely that he will be able 
to muster support or maintain authority if he does not 
learn to play ball with to those who put him in power. 
It is probable that he will have to struggle for his 
position in the state and in his party unless he makes 
amends quickly.  His personal safety may also be in 
jeopardy. 
 
 
11. (SBU) Comment continued.  While the Presidency has 
condemned the coup attempt, the President himself has 
been strangely mute on the issue except to say that the 
PDP should deal with the \"disagreement\" as if were a 
family affair. Observers of the Nigerian political 
scene will be scrutinizing subsequent developments to 
see if the cabal will get away with what nearly became 
the hijacking of Anambra State.  Should they remain 
immune to the law, plotters with far greater ambitions 
will be scanning the political horizon for similar 
opportunities on a broader field.  This incident has 
reflected politics in its crudest form, and revealed 
that the underlying system of political payoff that 
seems to be part of Nigeria\'s burgeoning democratic 
process may crack the stoic veneer the ruling party has 
tried to apply to its second term in power. What has 
been described as an attempted civilian coup d\'tat at 
the state level suggests that the country\'s democratic 
framework is shakier than its leaders acknowledge.  End 
comment.

SUBJECT:  NIGERIA:  DELTA KIDNAPPING THREATENS OIL 
PRODUCTION AGAIN 
 
1.  Summary:  A Nigerian white collar worker for Chevron 
Nigeria Ltd. (subsidiary of Chevron/Texaco) and member of 
the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association 
(PENGASSAN) was kidnapped outside his home on July 25 by a 
rogue group of armed Ijaw youths.  The kidnapping is the 
latest in a series of similar events in the years-long 
dispute between the Ijaws and the oil companies in the 
region, including Chevron, over the Ijaws\' demands to share 
in revenues from oil produced on their land.  PENGASSAN 
joined the fray on July 29 by issuing an ultimatum demanding 
that Chevron effect the release of its member within the 
next seventy-two hours, or the union will call for a work 
stoppage that will shut down all of Chevron\'s operations in 
the area.   The deadline is midnight on Friday, August 1. 
End Summary. 
 
 
Trouble, again, in the Delta 
 
 
2.   Chevron officials confirm the July 25 kidnapping of one 
of its Nigerian Public Affairs officers, who was abducted as 
he left his home in Warri early that morning.  Chevron adds 
that a note was later sent to its Warri office by the 
kidnappers demanding a large cash ransom.  According to 
senior Chevron Security Officer Hamish MacDonald, Chevron is 
determined not to accede to ransom demands for this or any 
other kidnapped employee, local or expatriate. 
 
 
Short Term Motives 
 
 
3.   An Ijaw community leader, Doyah Tiemo, told EconOff on 
July 30 that he had been in contact with the kidnappers and 
was told that the reasons for the kidnapping were continuing 
bad relations and lack of communication between the Ijaw 
community and Chevron.  He cited two examples of unresolved 
disputes between the parties that have been going on for at 
least the past two years.  First, in December, 2002, two 
rental boats carrying Ijaws from Warri to Chevron\'s Escravos 
facility to meet with Chevron officials were seized by State 
Security personnel and impounded.  The boats remain at the 
Escravos facility at a loss to the Ijaws of 20,000 naira per 
day (rate 1 USD equals 128 naria) with a cumulative loss to 
date of close to 4.5 million naira.  Second, the Egbema 
faction of the Ijaws continues to demand that Chevron stop 
dealing with the former President of the faction.  The 
Egbema claim this man is no longer authorized to represent 
them, and they accuse him of collusion with Chevron staff to 
steal monies paid to the Egbema by Chevron for offshore 
slots.  The payments can be between 20,000 and 40,000 naira 
per day. 
 
 
Economic impact of continuing instability 
 
 
4. The simmering tensions between Chevron, PENGASSAN and the 
Ijaws are about much more than seized boats and tribal 
factions.  Both unions and local communities accuse oil 
companies operating in the Nigerian Delta of failing to 
ensure their safety and believe that employers can do more 
to provide greater security and stability to communities 
that support the industry.  Employers argue that oil 
companies should not be pressured into assuming a 
governmental function that extends well beyond their 
corporate responsibility or objectives.  Since the GON 
receives more than 80 percent of Nigeria\'s oil revenues, 
according Cyril Odu, Exxon Mobil\'s human resources manager, 
employers believe the GON is able to improve the quality of 
life for Nigerians living in the Delta region.  However, the 
government has failed to promote initiatives that might 
reduce the region\'s growing security concerns and dependency 
on the oil sector to resolve the region\'s social and 
economic problems. 
 
 
Long-term consequences 
 
 
5.  PENGASSAN\'s ultimatum to Chevron/Texaco highlights a 
trend within the Nigerian labor movement that could have 
long-term economic implications.  Individual unions, 
particularly those in the oil sector, have become more 
active in advancing a political agenda that extends outside 
of the workplace. In response to Nigeria\'s lack of 
influential non-governmental organizations equipped to 
respond to issues facing the general public, oil sector 
unions are increasingly assuming responsibility to serve as 
the voice of civil society.  However, the lines between 
labor disputes and social concerns are blurring and unions 
are beginning to use industrial action as a way to resolve 
issues unrelated to the workplace.  In this case, PENGASSAN 
hopes to pressure Chevron on the larger issue of worker 
safety for Nigerians as well as expats.  Responsible Ijaw 
leaders are treating this incident as a criminal matter 
(septel).  However, PENGASSAN is using it to promote a much 
larger agenda: that of the same safety concerns for Nigerian 
oil workers that expatriates are given. 
 
 
6.  Comment.  The big picture is that oil unions are using 
their size and influence to shape the GON and private 
sector\'s role in resolving the Delta\'s ongoing communal 
crisis.  As oil unions become more active in these issues, 
workplace concerns have become obscured. Prior to the recent 
gas price hike, for example, the oil unions were negotiating 
resolution of a dispute regarding safety concerns related to 
employee-provided transportation to off-shore oil rigs. 
Tensions resulted in a standoff between American-owned 
Transocean and approximately one hundred oil workers who 
held 68 expatriates hostage for several days.  However, the 
safety issue at the core of the matter remains overshaowed 
and unresolved. 
 
 
7.  Comment continued.  In addition to safe transportation 
to oil rigs, salary increases for civil servants, and the 
oil sector\'s use of contract labor, other labor issues 
remain unresolved and are boiling beneath the surface.  The 
ultimatum issued by PENGASSAN underscores the labor 
movement\'s inability to separate its civic responsibility 
from its labor interests.   As unions continue to exercise 
their right to strike in response to conflicts between the 
companies and the communities, employers will likely 
experience more frequent strikes and threats of industrial 
action.  The resulting disruptions to production and the 
increased climate of instability will diminish the nation\'s 
ability to attract investment and create much-needed jobs.

1. Summary: Special Project participant Nkechinyere Nwosu 
returned to Nigeria excited about her program. She informed 
Post that she had a good experience and that the program 
helped change the misconceptions she had about the U.S., 
including the U.S. policies on Iraq and Africa. She said she 
learned a great deal about the U.S. foreign policy, U.S. 
efforts to fight terrorism and AGOA. Already, she has become 
a positive voice for U.S. policies and sound reporting among 
the local press. End Summary. 
 
 
2. Fiscal Year: FY - 2003 
   Quarter: Third 
   Date: July 21 - August 1, 2003 
 
 
3. Nwosu said the program helped her understand the U.S. 
policy on Iraq and why the U.S. went to war with Iraq. Sshe 
said that she initially thought that the U.S. went to war in 
Iraq for the money it would gain from selling Iraqi oil. 
After the program, she said she understood that the regime 
in Iraq had to be changed so that it would not continue to 
endanger its own people and its neighbors. 
 
 
On Africa, she said that initially the real benefits of AGOA 
were not clear but participating in the program had 
convinced her that there was a lot for Nigeria and Africa to 
benefit from AGOA and that she will now better inform her 
audience through her reports. 
 
 
Overall, Nwosu noted that the program gave her a good 
exposure to U.S. foreign policy, American social and 
cultural trends and enabled her to understand the evolution 
of American policies.  She now understands the average 
American as being blunt and frank. She added that the 
program enabled her to understand how the U.S. balances 
security and civil liberties, citing her experiences with 
lengthy security checks at U.S. airports. 
 
 
4. Results: Nwosu has started positively writing about her 
experiences. Although her positive comments about the U.S. 
have earned her the deragotory nickname \"Bush sister,\" she 
is undeterred. 
 
 
Nwosu also said the program exposed her to the role she 
could play as a journalist in creating awareness on 
HIV/AIDS. 
 
 
Locally-based third country diplomats have already offered 
unsolicited comments to Mission staff about the quality of 
Nwosu\'s reports.  Post expects Nwosu to continue in her self- 
professed mission to expose truth, even if it adversely 
affects those in high government positions. 
 
 
5. Post appreciates the opportunity to send one of Nigeria\'s 
finest editors on this program.  However, as per Nwosu\'s 
concerns, Post would request at least a small focus on 
typicalaverage American citizens\' attitudes in future 
International Visitor grants.

SUBJECT: SOWING THE BEANS OF HOPE 
 
1.   Summary:  The Shagamus of Ogun State have for many years 
grown only kola nuts, and sold them only to Hausas in 
northern Nigeria. Dr. Gabriel Ogunmola, the President of the 
Nigeria Academy of Science, recently told us of a hands-on, 
grassroots success:  showing the Shagumus near his university 
in Ogun State how to escape from generations-old practices of 
dependency and resentment stemming from this limited 
agricultural role.  His approach  holds promise of 
replication in other areas. End summary. 
 
 
2.  According to Ogumola, the Shagamus were unhappy with what 
they perceived to be their dependency on the Hausa market in 
the north and encroachment on their livelihood by the Hausas 
in their area.  Professor Ogunmola thought he saw a 
resolution to the problem in showing the Shagamus how to 
diversify their crops and gain more control over their lives. 
 
 
3.  He prepared a demonstration project using a borrowed plot 
of land. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture 
(IITA), a research facility, showed the famers a variety of 
products that could result from diversified planting relying 
heavily on soya beans, but also cassava and maize. Farmers 
learned that they could make soya flour, beer, and milk, 
among other products.  Representatives of the Agriculture 
Credit Bank, impressed with the results and the community\'s 
interest, offered to open bank accounts for any farmer with 
N500. These new accounts entitle farmers to be considered for 
bank loans.  The State\'s Commissioner of Industry offered to 
work with Professor Ogunmola and the farmers to produce soya 
milk for sale. 
 
 
4.  At the end of the program, this group of 100 mostly 
illiterate famers were the proud recipients of printed 
certificates attesting to their participation in the program. 
 The project has now been turned over to the community to run 
and there are plans for follow-up demonstrations. 
 
 
5.  Comment:  We find it interesting that a leading member of 
Nigeria\'s intellectual elite took the initiate to launch a 
grass-roots community project - one outside of his field, no 
less; Ogunmola is a chemist, not an agricultural specialist. 
The project had no outside funding and required some 
ingenuity and improvisation to get off the ground.  Few of 
the farmers involved could afford the N1000 ($7.75) per 
family it cost to participate, so he browbeat friends and 
acquaintances into sponsoring several farmers each.  Ogunmola 
hopes this was not just a one-off project; he is now looking 
for linkages with U.S. sponsors for follow-on projects 
elsewhere. End comment.

Anambra: Impeachment Panel ignores Court injunction 
 
 
1. (U)  The Impeachment Panel set up by the Anambra State 
government to investigate Deputy Governor Okey Udeh\'s role in 
the July 10 failed attempt to forcefully remove Governor 
Chris Ngige from office has ignored an order of the federal 
High Court in Abuja restraining it from further consideration 
of the Udeh case.  Presiding Judge of the High Court Wilson 
Egbo-Egbo ruled on August 26 that all proceedings and actions 
in connection with the impeachment proceeding must be stayed 
indefinitely.  On August 28, two days after the High Court 
order, the Panel met then announced on August 29 that it 
would ignore the Abuja Court\'s ruling because that court 
lacked jurisdiction to rule on matters concerning impeachment 
proceedings.  Udeh has filed a contempt of court charge 
against the Panel and his lawyer has, in addition, petitioned 
the Nigerian Bar Association to intervene based on what he 
terms the Panel\'s \"abuse of profession and due administration 
of justice.\"  No date has yet been set for a hearing on the 
charges of contempt. 
 
 
2. (C) Comment. The judicial wrangling that has surrounded 
this crisis from its beginning indicates that a resolution to 
the crisis in Anambra State that will be acceptable to all 
parties will be hard to come by.  The Obasanjo 
administration, after initial neutral statements, now has 
gone silent and appears willing to remain neutral while the 
crisis lasts.  Defying a court injunction as the Impeachment 
Panel has done seems a sure indication that Anambra State 
wants to test the strength of Nigeria\'s fledgling democracy. 
 
 
Abia: \"Action Governor\" Orji Kalu addresses Nigerian group in 
Houston 
 
 
3. (U) Abia State Governor Orji Kalu, in a speech to the Abia 
State National Association meeting in Houston, told the 
audience how he thought some of the problems in the State 
could be addressed.  According to Kalu, the State is in a 
financial bind because the Ministry of Finance and its Debt 
Management Office have taken almost USD 90 million from 
Abia\'s 2003 federal allocation to service debt of over USD 
600 million that the GON says is Abia\'s part of the national 
debt.  The State has protested the accuracy of both amounts, 
and Kalu blames the huge amounts going to debt service for 
Abia\'s inability to provide its citizens with their share of 
the \"dividends of democracy\" such as regular, on time payment 
of worker salaries, and provision of usual government 
services such as infrastructure repairs.  The Governor touted 
Abia\'s \"numerous economic potentials and rich local 
entrepreneurships\" as great opportunities, and suggested this 
area should be explored by foreign investors, especially 
American private businesses.  He went on to say that the US 
and other advanced countries should assist Nigeria with 
investment and technical support to stabilize and grow its 
economy.  He concluded, saying, \"Whatever happens to Nigeria 
will have adverse effects on democracy in Africa, and, 
indeed, in the whole world.  The international community, 
particularly America, has a moral duty to work to sustain 
democracy in Nigeria.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Comment. Orji Kalu is one of the Peoples Democratic 
Party\'s (PDP) stars in the southeast.  He has the personal 
support of President Olusegun Obsanjo who was the first to 
dub Kalu the \"Action Governor\" because he was so quick to 
initiate major growth and re-building programs for Abia state 
after his election in 1999.  In 2002 Kalu was embroiled in a 
bitter and protracted fight with his Deputy Governor, 
Enyinnaya Abaribe, that saw  Abaribe and his supporters in 
the State Assembly barricaded in the House of Assembly and 
without pay for several months.  When Abaribe decided to 
challenge his boss and also run for Governor, Kalu appointed 
another Deputy and easily won re-election.  On a visit to 
Abia State, PolOffs were impressed with the condition of the 
infrastructure and government facilities in and around the 
State capital of Umuahia.  Kalu was a successful businessman 
before entering politics.  There have already been calls by 
several organizations in Abia for him to run for the 
Presidency in 2007.  It is too early to tell whether Kalu is, 
himself, \"testing the waters\" for a run at the Presidency or 
whether these are merely attempts by admiring supporters to 
put him forward as a \"favorite son\" candidate.  End comment. 
 
 
Another nationwide strike is threatened 
 
 
5. (U) Renewed talks between the GON and the Nigerian Labor 
Congress (NLC) on the 12.5 per cent pay raise for public 
sector workers ended in a deadlock this week.  The NLC has 
threatened to commence a nationwide strike action on October 
1 if the pay raise isue is not resolved by that date. 
Central to thenegotiation between the GON and labor is a 
goverment offer of between four and six per cent as aganst 
the 12.5 pe 
cent earlier promised by Presidnt Obasanjo. 
The GON negotiating team, led by Secetary to the Government 
of the Federation of Nigria, Ufot Ekaete, said that the 
nation\'s economycannot withstand paying the promised 12.5 
percent.  Ekaete said that money even to pay the four per 
cent still on the table, would have to be part of a 
supplementary budget now in preparation and soon to be sent 
to the National Assembly. 
 
 
6. (C) NLC Assistant General Secretary Denja Yakub told 
PolSpec that the NLC will not settle for anything less than 
the 12.5 per cent promised by Obasanjo.  He said the Congress 
is prepared to commence an indefinite industrial action to 
force the GON to honor its promises.  He said, \"They can not 
continue to take us for a ride.  We are prepared to do 
anything to protect the rights of Nigerian workers.\" 
 
 
7. (C) Comment.  The NLC now appears to be fighting many 
battles at the same time.  It has only recently warned that 
it will declare a nationwide strike action should the GON 
further increase the price of petroleum products.  The 
Congress has also protested an alleged plan by the Nigeria 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to lay off 
approximately 2,000  workers.  It is not clear presently what 
the GON\'s strategy will be to stave off another nationwide 
strike less than two months after a week-long NLC strike to 
protest a fuel price hike nearly shut down the country.

1. (SBU) There has been no serious violence reported in Warri 
for almost two weeks, other than what has been described as 
an inter-factional \"skirmish\" over the weekend of August 30 
in the settlement of Ugbomro lying between Warri and Effurun. 
 Military patrols sent to restore peace found the body of a 
Police Inspector said to have been ambushed. On Thursday, 
September 4, Halliburton\'s security director described the 
situation in Warri as an \"uneasy quiet.\" 
 
 
2. (C) He also told Econoff that the Itshekiri are on the 
verge of an attack against the Ijaw in retaliation for an 
earlier Ijaw attack.  He said he informed the local military 
and police commanders of what he knows.  He thinks it could 
happen this weekend.  Others in the Warri business community 
are also discussing this report and are making arrangements 
for the safety and security of their employees. 
 
 
3. (C) At least one newspaper has reported that a serious 
clash is expected this weekend in Warri.  There are also 
reports that the Nigerian military has moved helicopters in 
the area, and has been flying low altitude runs over the city 
and environs.  A Lagos businessman with close ties to Warri 
told Econoff that the presence of military helicopters has 
fueled rumors that the military expects a large scale clash 
and is trying to deter against it.  However, he also suggests 
that the entire situation is rumor only: in his opinion, no 
faction ever announces its attacks in advance, and no one can 
ever predict what will happen between the feuding ethnic 
groups in Warri. 
 
 
4.(C) Meanwhile, the boat loaded with Halliburton equipment 
hijacked on August 18 by Ijaw \"pirates\" (reftel) was released 
this week through peaceful mediation by the Delta state 
government.  The expected military action never occurred. 
The captain and crew held hostage went unharmed and returned 
to Forcados.  Halliburton has not yet recovered its equipment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, EINV, EFIN, NI, XA 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: USITC STUDY ON U.S. - SUB-SAHARAN 
AFRICA TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
 
REF: STATE 224559 
 
 
1. (U) U.S. Mission Nigeria is pleased to provide the 
following information in response to reftel. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
DEVELOPMENTS IN NIGERIAN ECONOMIC, TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
POLICIES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) In August 2003, the GON unveiled a new economic 
plan, the National Economic Empowerment and Development 
Strategy (NEEDS), that outlines strategies for 
attaining macro-economic stability (with emphasis on 
low inflation and stable interest and exchange rates) 
as well as achieving annual GDP growth of 5-7 percent. 
The ambitious plan emphasizes the GON\'s commitment to 
fiscal discipline and public sector reforms, places 
special emphasis on health, education and agriculture, 
and aims to raise the rate of industrial capacity 
utilization from 40 to 80 percent. 
 
 
3. (U) Despite its stated commitment to an open and 
rules-based trading system, Nigeria\'s trade policy 
remains inconsistent.  In March 2003, the GON cut 
duties on many line items (mostly raw materials and 
capital equipment) but raised them on others (primarily 
finished goods and agricultural products).  This 
followed similar year-on-year cuts and increases, often 
on the same goods.  A protectionist bent is 
increasingly evident in Nigerian trade policy, as many 
items - including frozen poultry, certain printed 
fabrics, cassava, ice cream, fruit juice in retail 
packs, toothpicks, beer and pasta - are simply banned, 
ostensibly to foster domestic production (even though 
domestic industries are unable to meet demand). 
 
 
4. (U) Nigeria reduced its port taxes in 2001 and 2003 
and has begun to remove administrative obstacles that 
hamper efficient operations.  Port congestion and 
clearance rates, particularly at Lagos\'s Apapa Port, 
which handles over 40 percent of Nigeria\'s trade, have 
improved significantly, as have efforts to enforce the 
GON\'s policy of inspecting 100 percent of imports for 
contraband.  In addition, the GON intends to implement 
a destination inspection regime for valuation of import 
duties in January 2004 (after several failed attempts 
in recent years), but the Nigerian Customs Service\'s 
capacity to handle that responsibility is questionable. 
 
 
5. (U) The GON offers export incentives ranging from 
grants to guaranteed loans to tax concessions, but few 
Nigerian firms benefit from them.  Some businesses, 
however, have begun to take advantage of the Calabar 
and Onne free trade zones (FTZs).  The latter has 
become increasingly attractive to oil and gas 
companies, which use it as a bonded warehouse for 
supplies and equipment and liquefied natural gas 
exports.  The GON now allows products assembled in the 
Calabar FTZ from reduced-tariff imports to be sold in 
Nigeria free of import duties.  Nigeria remains the 
primary market for Calabar FTZ products. 
 
 
6. (U) Investment remains concentrated in the oil and 
gas sector, which continues to attract funds for oil 
and gas exploration and production, liquefied natural 
gas projects and related activities.  The 
telecommunications sector has grown at an explosive 
pace, and some investment is being channeled into 
manufacturing and industry. 
 
 
---------------------------------------- 
DEVELOPMENTS IN MAJOR REGIONAL GROUPINGS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (U) No significant changes have occurred.  Nigeria 
remains an active member of ECOWAS and other regional 
economic, commercial and financial organizations. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
UPDATED INFORMATION ON NIGERIAN PRIVATIZATION EFFORTS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
8. (U) More than 30 enterprises - including cement 
manufacturing firms, banks and hotels - have been 
privatized since the GON\'s 1999 launch of a three-stage 
privatization program.  Attempts to privatize the NICON 
Hilton Hotel and Nigeria Telecommunications Limited 
(NITEL), however, have been unsuccessful.  The GON 
recently selected a Dutch consortium, Pentascope 
International, to manage NITEL until mid-2006 and now 
expects to divest at least 51 percent of its shares at 
the expiration of that contract. 
 
 
9. (U) The privatization of Nigeria\'s National Electric 
Power Authority (NEPA) continues to move slowly.  Given 
the complexities of the sale, NEPA\'s poor financial 
condition, and strong public opposition, the 
privatization could take time.  NEPA is moving slowly 
to unbundle its services.  The company will be split 
into several autonomous firms encompassing power 
generation, transmission, distribution, and billing. 
 
 
------------------------------- 
MAJOR AGOA-RELATED DEVELOPMENTS 
------------------------------- 
 
 
10. (U) Nigeria has not capitalized on AGOA trade 
preferences to any discernible degree (oil and gas 
products continue to dominate U.S. imports under the 
program) and has yet to adopt a visa regime that will 
allow it to take advantage of AGOA\'s textile and 
apparel benefits.  The GON has, however, amended the 
1990 Customs and Excise Management Act to base the 
valuation of imports on actual transaction values and 
to penalize transshipment of goods by imposing fines of 
up to three times the value of the goods involved.  The 
legislation thereby moves Nigeria closer to satisfying 
AGOA-related rules of origin requirements. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
EXAMPLES OF U.S. TRADE CAPACITY-BUILDING EFFORTS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
11. (U) The USG continues to work with Nigerian trade 
associations and businesses to facilitate bilateral 
trade and investment.  Post supports the Nigerian 
Investment Promotion Commission in its efforts to lower 
or remove barriers to investment and maintains ongoing 
contact with the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce, 
the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other 
trade promotion organizations. 
 
 
12. (U) The U.S. Commercial Service hosts two week-long 
trade fairs annually to showcase U.S. goods and 
services available to Nigerian businessmen and holds an 
annual agent-distributor forum to explore ways of 
improving market access through lower tariffs, more 
thorough product certification, and improved local 
business practices.  In early 2003, the U.S. Commercial 
Service also launched its Global Trade and Investment 
Management (GTIM) program.  GTIM supports Nigerian 
entrepreneurs by providing access to online market 
development training and trade and investment 
information.  The program also provides access to a 
series of business service centers.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  UNIONS MAY EXPAND WORK ACTIONS OVER FEAR 
 
OF JOB LOSS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY 
 
 
 1.  Leaders from the National Union of Petroleum and Gas 
Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior 
Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) are meeting in Benin 
City to discuss cooperative action amid reports that the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), 
ChevronTexaco, and Shell plan to reorganize their respective 
operations.  Workers fear the reorganizations will lead to 
substantial layoffs and reduce promotion prospects for 
Nigerian employees. 
 
 
2.  Through its \"Exploration and Production Globalization 
Project\" Shell has already begun restructuring to promote 
greater efficiency.  This has led to an on-going lockout of 
offices by its white-collar union employees in Lagos, Port 
Harcourt, and Warri.  Production has not been affected. 
While the NNPC has confirmed its federally mandated plans to 
reorganize, it contends that there are no plans to layoff 
workers.  Union leaders, however, allege that NNPC plans to 
layoff approximately 2000 employees. 
 
 
3. ChevronTexaco is reportedly meeting with PENGASSAN and 
NUPENG representatives to ensure that the strike at Shell 
does not spread to ChevronTexaco workers, who have already 
called on the company\'s management to review its 
restructuring plans or face industrial action.  Although 
Chevron has not officially announced plans to reorganize, 
sources within the company said privately that they are 
reviewing possible actions to streamline their operation and 
increase efficiency. 
 
 
4.  COMMENT: Averting a widespread strike may be difficult 
given the seemingly hard-line positions of the major players. 
  In addition to the concerns about massive layoffs, the 
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) last week warned the GON that it 
would not tolerate another increase in the price of petroleum 
products, which President Obasanjo has publicly suggested is 
forthcoming. A significant hike in government-set fuel prices 
resulted in an eight-day nationwide strike in late June and 
early July.  Ultimately, the GON relented and reduced the 
amount of the fuel price increase. Obasanjo is now hinting at 
recouping the amount cut back earlier, as refined petroleum 
products are still under-priced.  Increased tensions were 
evident when a scheduled tour of Shell facilities in the Port 
Harcourt and Warri areas for Lagos diplomats was suddenly 
canceled  last week.  Shell\'s Managing Director of External 
Affairs confirmed to EconOff that Shell is in the process of 
\"downsizing\" and considered the situation at its facilities 
too volatile to continue with the planned tour, although 
violent ethnic clashes in Warri recently would also have 
given Shell reason to cancel VIP tours there.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12598: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, PGOV, KDEM, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GON AGREES TO INCREASE CIVIL SERVICE 
SALARIES 
 
 
1.  On Friday, September 5, Laboff spoke to Chris Uyot, the 
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Head of Information and Public 
Affairs, who confirmed that the GON agreed to implement 
sliding scale wage increases for all federal civil servants 
retroactive to July 1, 2003.  While both sides are working 
out specific details, Uyot explained that the lowest paid 
civil servants would receive a 12.5 percent increase while 
employees at the top of the scale would receive four 
percent.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole told Laboff that 
the sides would have agreed to the sliding scale proposal 
sooner but negotiators, who are at the top of the pay scale, 
would not consider a proposal that would reduce their salary 
increase by 8.5 percent. 
 
 
2.  The Trade Union Congress (TUC), comprised of senior 
staff and managers, would like to prevent the agreement from 
being implemented because its members would not receive the 
full 12.5 percent increase.  Biodun Ogunade, TUC\'s Head of 
Information, claims that the negotiation between GON and NLC 
\"was done in a deceitful, untransparent and undemocratic 
manner as senior staff in the public sector were not 
represented.\"  The NLC counters that TUC cannot now claim it 
was deceived because the government\'s negotiators were also 
TUC senior staff members. (Comment. TUC was not formally 
represented at the negotiations because it is not a GON- 
recognized trade union center.  TUC members were, however, 
present and participating during the negotiations and aware 
of the impact of the proposed sliding scale on themselves 
and their colleagues.  End comment.) 
 
 
3.  Although it appears that the GON and its employees may 
have found an affordable common ground, state officials are 
concerned that their civil servants will demand a similar 
increase.  Some states are already as much as one year 
behind in paying salaries and pensions to employees.  While 
state governments have intensified their efforts to resolve 
salary and pension disputes, the majority of states do not 
have the financial resources to support salary increases. 
Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu said his government is not 
in a position to pay the 12.5 percent wage hike and 
expressed concern that, if the federal increase is 
implemented, state civil servants \"will never take `no\' for 
an answer.\"  He warned that the inability to pay higher 
wages at the state level would eventually lead to industrial 
actions, including strikes.

D (D). 
 
 
1. (U) This is Post\'s response to Department\'s request for 
information on Abia State Governor Orji Kalu who is to meet 
with A/S Walter Kansteiner September,2003. 
 
 
2. (U)  Orji Uzor Kalu is 44 years old.  Both he and his wife 
hold \"green cards\" and their two daughters are AmCits.  Kalu 
and his wife hold degrees from US universities.  Before 
entering his first term as governor on May 29, 2001, Kalu 
owned and led several international companies manufacturing 
or producing furniture, paper and vegetable oils.  His 
business operations were last reported to earn around USD 20 
million annually.  Kalu has been dubbed the \"Action Governor\" 
by President Olusegun Obasanjo because of his ability to get 
projects and programs for Abia State going quickly soon after 
he assumed office.  He is said to have close ties to former 
military dictator Ibrahim Babangida, who is also rumored to 
have steered lucrative contracts to Kalu\'s businesses during 
the military\'s rule.  He is a member of the ruling Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP), but counts as a close friend the only 
Alliance for Democracy (AD) governor to win re-election in 
2003, Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu.  \"Spontaneous\" 
movements to put Kalu forward as a potential candidate for 
the presidency were launchedbefore the just-completed 2003 
elections and arealready being reported for the 2007 
elections.  alu is ambitious, demanding, fearless, and 
decisive to the point of bluntness, but he keeps his 
promises, pays his debts and has a reputation for delivering 
the goods. 
 
 
3. (C) Kalu is an Igbo and has, from his days as a student, 
espoused the notion that the Igbos should have their turn 
running Nigeria.  He, like many southern governors and 
political players, has repeatedly called for \"true 
federalism\" as the solution to the problems of the nation. 
From our conversations with contacts, what is understood by 
the term \"true federalism\" is a return to local (or at least 
regional) control of States\' income and resources.  As the 
system now functions, all income goes to the federal 
government to be parceled out to the States as the central 
government sees fit and for those projects the federal 
government wants to support.  Most of the southern States, 
the almost exclusive source of the national income from oil 
and gas, have never been satisfied with this system and 
complain continuously.  Kalu has reportedly used some of his 
own money to get needed projects off the ground in Abia.  All 
the matters -- except debt relief -- that Kalu wishes to 
discuss relate to the issue of returning control of funds 
back to the States. 
 
 
4. (C) On a recent trip to the US to address a gathering of 
Nigerian-Americans, Kalu brought up the fact that Abia State 
was saddled with paying back a crippling and unfair share of 
the national debt incurred during the civilian administration 
of Shehu Shagari.  We have information that Kalu has been 
successful in past years in getting loans for the State to 
pay operating expenses such as salaries.  During his months 
long struggle with his Deputy Governor Enyinnaya Abaribe, 
this was one of the main points of friction between the two, 
with Abaribe charging that Kalu was needlessly getting the 
State into uncontrollable debt.  We do not have direct 
information on the current financial situation in Abia, but 
it is certain Kalu can not continue to finance out of his own 
pocket and may be looking for ways the USG could help get 
outside funding for his State.

Anambra: Court proceedings begin on Igwe killings 
 
 
1. (U) Almost exactly one year after the prominent husband 
and wife team of lawyers, Barnabas Chidi and Amaka Blessing 
Igwe, was hacked to death in the streets of Onitsha, a bail 
hearing was held in the Onitsha High Court for one of the 
prime suspects in the case.  In an unusual move to get action 
on the case, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) successfully 
petitioned the Anambra State Attorney General and Justice 
Commissioner to allow the NBA to prosecute the case.  Prince 
Ken Emeakayi, former Commissioner of Works in the 
administration of defeated Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju, is 
the prime suspect in the case and has been detained, along 
with other suspects, for several weeks.  While waiting for 
action in the case, the press and other observers have 
suggested a connection between the Igwe murder and the murder 
of former Attorney General and Minister for Justice Bola Ige. 
 There has also been speculation that the murders were 
politically motivated since the prime suspects in both cases 
are government officials.  The judge assigned the case, 
Justice Peter Umeadi, will rule on the application for bail 
this week. 
 
 
2. (C) Comment.  This past weekend, another husband and wife 
lawyer team was shot and killed in front of their young 
children in Kaduna.  NBA President Wole Olanipekin blamed the 
federal government for the rising number of \"mighty men 
including governors and ministers\" who have been brutally 
attacked or killed in recent months.  Lawyers in Lagos have 
told journalists that their profession is being 
\"systematically targeted\" by other members of the Nigerian 
government structure who \"feel threatened by the (lawyers\') 
presence and work.\"  Nelson Otaji, a prominent Lagos lawyer, 
said \" It is now very dangerous to be a lawyer in this 
country....When some people lose a case in court, they go 
after the opposing counsel.\"  It is certain that Nigerians 
have little trust in the efficacy or integrity of their 
judicial system.  It is difficult to tell, however, whether 
the recent violence and threats of violence against lawyers 
and judges is in any way politically motivated or is merely 
an expression of the frustration that some litigants feel 
with the system of justice in Nigeria.  End comment. 
 
 
Anambra:  Deputy Governor is impeached 
 
 
3. (U) Despite an Abuja High Court restraining order 
enjoining it from proceeding with the impeachment of Deputy 
Governor Okey Udeh, the Anambra State House of Assembly has 
impeached Udeh and removed him from office.  The Assembly 
acted on the report of an Impeachment Panel it had set up to 
investigate allegations of misconduct leveled against Udeh. 
Udeh was accused of being part of the July 10 plot to 
forcibly remove Governor Chris Ngige from office and then 
wrongfully proclaiming himself Governor.  Udeh had been 
successful in securing the court injunction stopping the 
Impeachment Panel from functioning.  Unfortunately for him, 
the Panel ignored the court, found Udeh guilty on all charges 
and handed him over to the Assembly for impeachment anyway. 
 
 
4. (C) Comment. Despite this good news for Ngige -- getting 
the Deputy Governor out of the way helps support Ngige\'s 
claim to be the legitimate principal officer of the State 
--it is still too early to predict how the legal web that has 
been spun around the Ngige affair will be untangled, 
especially with the new snarls created by the Assembly\'s 
action.  The Abuja High Court that issued the restraining 
order is scheduled to take up the matter again in the next 
week to consider the constitutionality of the \"letter of 
resignation\" Ngige is supposed to have signed under pressure 
from his political \"godfather\", Chris Uba.  Observers inside 
and outside the judicial system expect the High Court to deal 
sternly with the Anambra House of Assembly that flaunted its 
order.  End comment. 
 
 
Rivers: Another pipeline explosion in Ogoniland 
 
 
5. (U) The residents of Tia, a small farming and fishing 
community, were devastated recently when an oil pipeline 
jointly owned by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC) and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, 
Ltd. (Shell)  exploded burning acres of fertile land and 
polluting nearby creeks.  The resulting spill of crude oil 
has displaced over 100 Tia families.  Farmers in the area 
lost crops and near-term use of arable land; fishermen lost 
catches; and residents lost access to potable water because 
ground water in the area is now polluted with crude oil.

Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), told Pol/Econ Officer 
that neighboring communities mobilized to help and were able 
to relocate some families.  He complained that, based on 
previous incidents like this, the people of Tia could expect 
little in compensation from either the GON or Shell. 
According to Mitee, the GON relies on the Land Use Act of 
1978 that gives the government all rights of title to the 
hereditary Ogoni lands.  Thus, in the event of oil or gas 
damage to the land, the only compensation to which farmers 
are entitled is an amount equal to the value of lost crops -- 
historically a very small amount that does not fully 
compensate the farmer.  Mitee said that while no one was 
injured in this latest incident, the financial and 
environmental losses are still being evaluated. 
 
 
7. (C) Comment: Although Shell no longer drills in the area, 
it continues to transport crude oil through Ogoniland.  Its 
decades old pipeline system is prone to leaks.  Mitee has 
denied reports that the Ogoni prevented Shell workers from 
repairing the leak until Shell is willing to discuss 
compensation for the residents of Tia.  Although the recently 
ended strike by Shell workers has further delayed repairs of 
the pipeline, this is but another incident to add to the long 
list of grievances about environmental damage, lack of 
disaster preparedness, minimal compensation for losses, etc. 
that the Ogonis have against Shell and the GON.

Classified By: RHINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (SBU) The town of Warri has remained mostly calm over the 
last two weeks as the Nigerian military and mobile police 
(known as MOPOL) continue to build a presence in the area. 
Over the weekend of September 6th, oil service contractors in 
Warri and a Shell spokesperson told Econoff that in reaction 
to widespread rumors of an imminent Itsekiri attack against 
Ijaws (ref A), GON troops patrolled and \"paraded\" through the 
city in major shows of force that appeared to keep the peace. 
On September 15, a Shell security specialist in Warri told 
Econoff that the military is continuing such exercises day 
and night. 
 
 
-------------- 
POLITICAL PATH 
-------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) Some Ijaw leaders have recently publicly announced 
their support for a plan proposed by Delta State Governor 
James Ibori to find a \"political solution\" to the ongoing 
ethnic clashes in Warri and throughout the riverine area of 
the Niger Delta.  Ibori has asked the State Assembly to 
create additional Local Government Areas (LGA) in Warri to 
even the ethnic balance for government representation, which 
currently favors the Itsekiri.  Disagreement over whether 
(and how) to redraw the boundaries of political zones in 
Warri served as a catalyst for the violence in March which 
ultimately shut down 40 percent of Nigeria\'s crude oil 
production.  This effort may prove futile, even if supported 
in Warri, since the federal government has floated a plan to 
do away with the current local government structure 
altogether. 
 
 
3. (U) But even while some Ijaw support the Governor\'s 
attempts to find a political solution to the ethnic clashes, 
there are news reports that unidentified Ijaw youth kidnapped 
six Yoruba people from Warri.  Other reports surfaced on 
September 10 that militant Ijaw have given all Yorubas seven 
days to leave Warri, but the threat was publicly denied by an 
Ijaw activist in Lagos.  The targeting of Yoruba by Ijaw, if 
true, appears to reflect accusations attributed to Ijaw Chief 
E.K. Clark that the Yoruba-based vigilante organization, Odua 
People\'s Congress (OPC), sponsored the Itsekiri in recent 
bloody clashes against the Ijaw. 
 
 
---------------------- 
THE MILITARY DIMENSION 
---------------------- 
 
 
4. (C/NF) The GON\'s deployment of troops and assets appears 
to have reached a level that maintains order and a fragile 
peace in Warri for the time being.  Embassy DATT has 
corroborated his estimate that troop strength in the Warri 
area is now near 4000.  In his view, the Nigerian military is 
making a significant commitment to the joint task force 
mission Operation Restore Hope in the Delta swamps. 
 
 
5. (C) The most important indication of a more muscular 
military posture to come are the many reports of significant 
oil company assistance to the Nigerian military to purchase 
helicopters, boats and other equipment for use in the Delta 
(refs B,C).  It will not arrive overnight, and will not 
necessarily be used well when it gets there, but the 
militants will see the mailed fist, and the threat of its use 
may be an effective deterrent.  If the military uses the 
ramped-up presence in an offensive (refs D,E,F), it could 
succeed in taking the militants down a few notches, or the 
engagement could prove an embarrassing disaster like the 
setback in March 2003. 
 
 
6. (C) COMMENT. We may be entering a significant yet not 
altogether predictable period in the Delta.  Political 
overtures by government officials and by leaders of the 
ethnic factions themselves may continue to forestall a return 
to major bloodshed, but results are far from certain. 
Furthermore, it is not clear to observers of the Nigerian 
military that the augmented armed forces can sustain 
themselves in the Delta indefinitely, even with oil company 
funding. If this proves to be the case, we may see a return 
to spotty or ineffective military operations in the mid-term, 
with a possible unraveling of whatever political progress may 
have been made in the interim.  And of course, the ethnic 
factions themselves have rarely proved predictable, and may 
simply launch attacks on each other without warning.  END 
COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: THE TENTH ECONOMIC SUMMIT: NEW PLANS, 
NEW HOPES, OLD DOUBTS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. The Nigerian Economic Summit Group\'s 
tenth annual summit ended on September 12 on a 
cautiously optimistic note.  Delegates from business, 
academia and the public sector recognized the need for 
far-reaching economic reforms and seemed optimistic 
that they might be implemented under the leadership of 
President Obasanjo\'s new economic team, but their 
optimism was tempered by doubts about the efficacy of 
previous summits and subsequent attempts at reform. 
End summary. 
 
 
2. (U) The president\'s new chief economic advisor 
(appointed last June), Dr. Charles Soludo, emerged as 
one of the summit\'s leading advocates of reform; to a 
large extent, the summit bore his stamp.  Soludo said 
bluntly that Nigeria\'s economy would remain stagnant 
unless the GON undertakes drastic changes.  Without 
reform, he said, achieving the GON\'s target of 5-7 
percent GDP growth will be virtually impossible, 
particularly as Nigeria has never sustained even 5 
percent growth for more than three consecutive years. 
Soludo argued that the current situation - one of low 
productivity, low investment, low GDP growth and 
widespread poverty - is unsustainable and expressed 
dismay at the GON\'s poor policy coordination, lack of 
fiscal and monetary discipline, and failure to root out 
corruption and rent seeking behavior.  Soludo painted a 
harsh but accurate picture of the Nigerian economy; 
others echoed it and used it to push for reform. 
 
 
3. (U) With the new Minister of Finance, Soludo figures 
prominently in President Obasanjo\'s new economic team. 
The group is widely perceived as competent and 
knowledgeable, and many believe this to be one of the 
GON\'s best chances for implementing reform.  Soludo 
himself believes that with executive buy-in, new 
cooperation among federal and state governments 
(facilitated by the governing party\'s control of 28 of 
Nigeria\'s 36 states), a receptive and responsive 
legislature, and strong stakeholder support, the time 
is ripe for change.  Toward that end, Soludo emphasized 
the importance of a concise and coherent reform agenda 
focused on a handful of priorities: establishing sound 
fiscal and monetary policies, facilitating private 
sector growth and investment, and improving the 
delivery of basic public services. 
 
 
4. (U) Soludo urged the GON to minimize ever-growing 
budget deficits by establishing overall expenditure 
limits and setting aside excess oil earnings to 
stabilize revenues (both reforms would require 
appropriate enabling legislation).  He also called for 
careful monitoring of the GON\'s debt profile and 
greater fiscal policy coordination among federal and 
state governments - particularly since many states are 
technically bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy - 
and urged governments at all levels to tie their 
budgets to agreed-upon spending priorities.  Soludo 
went on to stress the need for stable exchange rates 
and controlled growth in the money supply, thus echoing 
the Central Bank\'s stated goals of stable monetary 
policy and single-digit inflation. 
 
 
5. (U) Along with other GON officials, Soludo called 
for a series of reforms to facilitate private sector 
growth and investment, suggesting first and foremost 
that the GON move forward with the privatization of 
major public enterprises and continue efforts to 
liberalize the downstream petroleum sector.  He also 
emphasized the importance of stronger anti-corruption 
laws, sound competition policy, and well-defined and 
transparent regulatory regimes, pointing out that the 
latter is crucial to any attempt to attract private 
sector investment. 
 
 
6. (U) Summit delegates widely acknowledged the GON\'s 
failure to effectively deliver public services. 
Nigeria\'s poor infrastructure and lack of readily 
available healthcare and education are among the 
country\'s biggest obstacles to growth, and along with 
other speakers, Soludo emphasized the need for improved 
power supplies, expanded transportation and 
telecommunications networks, and more (and better) 
schools and healthcare facilities.  The World Bank\'s 
country director, Dr. Mark Tomlinson, pointed out, 
however, that improving the delivery of public services 
would require massive investment - investment that the 
GON simply cannot afford.  Financing Nigeria\'s much- 
needed 6,000-megawatt increase in power generating 
capacity will alone require $6 billion, and many 
billions of dollars more are needed to finance 
improvements in roads, railways, ports, 
telecommunications networks, schools and healthcare 
facilities. 
 
 
7. (U) Given the GON\'s limited resources, Soludo and 
other summit participants called on the private sector 
to play a greater role in financing investment and 
emphasized the need for more numerous public-private 
partnerships.  They recognized, however, that even 
private sector investment would be insufficient.  Both 
Soludo and Tomlinson said bluntly that consumers would 
have to shoulder more of the burden of providing public 
services, particularly since they now pay for only 30 
to 40 percent of all power generated and enjoy 
surprisingly low charges for water delivery (Nigerians 
pay only $0.04 per cubic meter of water, as compared to 
$1.52 in Burkina Faso, $1.10 in Mauritania and $0.75 in 
Mali).  Even the price of fuel is heavily subsidized. 
Unfortunately, transferring financial responsibility to 
consumers may be easier said than done, particularly 
when previous price increases have been met by strong 
resistance. 
 
 
8. (U) Comment. Although Nigeria\'s economic landscape 
is littered with failed reform initiatives, summit 
delegates seemed remarkably optimistic that under the 
government\'s new economic team, things might be 
different; perhaps the tenth time is the charm.  Many 
believe that the GON\'s reform agenda now enjoys 
unprecedented support both within and outside the 
government.  Soludo himself is acutely aware of 
Nigeria\'s history of failed reform attempts, but he 
stressed in a recent newspaper interview that the 
chances for successful reform are greater now than in 
the past.  Rather than being an ivory tower exercise, 
he said, the current agenda is grounded in political 
reality and enjoys the support of the \"highest levels.\" 
Post certainly hopes so; if even a handful of its 
recommendations are implemented, Nigeria may be looking 
at a brighter economic future.  But as a veteran 
participant in these summits told us a few days after 
this one ended, \"been there, done that, bought the T- 
shirt.\"  End comment.

PUMPING OIL IN NORTHERN DELTA SOON

     C. LAGOS 1940 
     D. ABUJA NI 1594 
 
 
Classified By: RHINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Shell Oil has been assessing its crude oil 
production facilities in the Delta swamps shut down by ethnic 
violence five months ago, and concludes some may again be 
operational by September 20, 2003.  Shell could pump as much 
as 40,000 to 50,000 additional barrels per day of crude oil 
from the region within two weeks.  Even though Chevron 
executives may dislike the idea, this development could press 
the company to follow suit soon.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) Econoff spoke with Shell Oil\'s security manager based 
in Warri on September 15.  The security manager said Shell 
has been assessing well-heads, flow lines and pipelines in 
the Northern Delta which were shut down in March due to 
ethnic clashes.  The assessments indicate minimal damage was 
done to Shell facilities, he said, and it may be possible to 
bring some of them online by the end of the week.  Shell 
could be pumping as much as 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day 
from the closed well-heads within two weeks, he also said. 
Approximately 140,000 barrels per day of Shell\'s production 
from the region remains closed as a result of the March 
violence.  (NOTE: Up to 300,000 barrels per day of crude 
developed by Shell, Chevron, and TotalfinaElf in the Northern 
Delta region are offline.)  Shell\'s security manager said the 
ramped-up military presence in the Delta is a significant 
factor in the company\'s decision to bring the closed 
production back online now.  (NOTE: He also confirmed that 
Shell is providing logistical assistance to the military 
deployed to the area in the form of food, staging areas and 
the use of non-military boats for troop and equipment 
movement (ref A)). 
 
 
3. (C) Chevron officials have insisted that the company will 
not return to its wells in the isolated riverine areas of the 
Delta State swamps until the GON effectively restores law and 
order there (ref B).  While a massive troop build-up in and 
around Warri has produced a tense peace (ref C), a Chevron 
spokesperson told Econoff in early September the company is 
unwilling to spend the millions of dollars needed to repair 
damage done to its facilities in the swamps during the March 
violence until the risk is significantly reduced. (NOTE: 
Either Chevron suffered more damage to its facilities or is 
more risk-averse than Shell, or both.) 
 
 
4. (C) COMMENT.  If this assessment of Shell\'s willingness to 
restart its Northern Swamp production proves accurate, 
Nigeria will soon take a welcome step in returning to full 
crude production.  Since March 2003, the GON has lost much 
oil revenue as a result of the crisis in the Delta. 
 
 
5. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  If Shell brings its production 
back online in the coming days, the GON will likely pressure 
Chevron to follow suit. Chevron executives may not be able to 
hold fast to their demand that the government demonstrate its 
ability to establish and maintain peace and order before the 
company restarts operations in the Warri swamplands.  The GON 
may interpret Shell\'s decision to return to the swamps as a 
signal that corporate sponsorship of the joint military 
deployment Operation Restore Hope is a successful security 
model (ref C, D).  This informal, off-the-record arrangement 
shifts the cost of the massive military presence required to 
provide security for oil workers and facilities largely to 
the companies.  Should Chevron find itself paying for 
security in the region anyway, it may feel economic pressure 
to resume production in the region sooner than later simply 
to recoup this outlay. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AGOA ELIGIBILITY REVIEW 
 
REF: (A) STATE 263702 (B) 02 ABUJA 02803 
 
 
1. (U) In response to Ref A, U.S. Mission Nigeria is 
pleased to provide the following update to the 2002 
AGOA eligibility review (Ref B).  Nigeria\'s progress 
toward fulfilling AGOA eligibility requirements has 
been slow and fitful, but progress continues.  Post 
recommends that Nigeria remain eligible for AGOA 
benefits. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
PROGRESS TOWARD A MARKET-BASED ECONOMY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (U) Nigeria continues to make progress toward 
establishing a market-based economy that protects 
private property rights and minimizes government 
interference.  Since its 1999 launch of a three-stage 
privatization program, the GON has privatized 25 
enterprises (among them hotels, banks and cement 
manufacturing firms) and moved toward the privatization 
of several others, including the National Electric 
Power Authority (NEPA) and Nigeria Telecommunications 
Limited (NITEL).  The GON plans to split NEPA into 
autonomous generating, transmission, distribution and 
billing firms and expects to divest 51 percent of its 
shares in NITEL at the expiration of the firm\'s three- 
year management contract with Pentascope International, 
a Dutch communications consortium.  The GON also raised 
fuel prices and has hinted at plans for an additional 
increase, thereby reaffirming its commitment to 
reducing government interference in the economy. 
 
 
3. (U) Progress toward establishing a rules-based open 
trading system has been slower; the GON still tends to 
change policies suddenly and arbitrarily.  In March 
2003, the GON once again cut duties on many items 
(mostly raw materials and capital equipment) and raised 
them on others (primarily finished goods and 
agricultural products).  A protectionist bent is 
increasingly evident in Nigerian trade policy, as many 
items - frozen poultry, certain printed fabrics, 
cassava, ice cream, fruit juice in retail packs, 
toothpicks, beer and pasta - are simply banned, 
ostensibly to foster domestic production, even though 
domestic industries cannot meet demand. 
 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THE RULE OF LAW AND POLITICAL PLURALISM 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (U) Ethnic and religious tensions pose significant 
challenges to GON efforts to establish the rule of law 
and political pluralism.  Communal clashes have 
resulted in numerous injuries and deaths, and Nigeria\'s 
under-funded, under-trained and under-equipped police 
force is often hard-pressed to stop or prevent 
violence.  The Nigerian military has managed to calm 
some particularly violent areas, but looting and 
indiscriminate killing have marred its efforts. 
 
 
5. (U) Civil and criminal cases move through Nigeria\'s 
courts slowly, and the country\'s judicial system 
generally lacks the resources and administrative 
capability to function effectively.  The adoption of 
Sharia law in 12 of Nigeria\'s northern states remains a 
contentious issue, and few people in government or the 
courts are willing to address the problem.  Still, the 
Supreme Court and appellate courts command wide 
respect, and the former continues to assert its role as 
the final arbiter of disputes in Nigeria\'s ongoing 
efforts to adopt political and economic reforms. 
 
 
6. (U) Nigeria\'s record of political pluralism is 
slightly better.  Thirty political parties contested 
the spring 2003 federal and state elections, and 
various parties\' elected officials share power at all 
levels.  Despite reports of widespread electoral fraud, 
President Obasanjo\'s administration enjoys broad 
support, and the vast majority of Nigerians continue to 
support democratic practices. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
ELIMINATION OF BARRIERS TO U.S. TRADE AND INVESTMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
7. (U) Nigeria continues to make progress toward 
creating an environment conducive to domestic and 
freign investment.  The GON allows for the free 
movement of foreign exchange across Nigeria\'s borders 
and generally does not discriminate against U.S. goods 
or services.  Foreign firms are allowed to invest in 
all sectors of the Nigerian economy, and investors who 
abide by regulations governing the establishment of 
businesses are assured national treatment. 
 
 
8. (U) Nigeria\'s record of intellectual property rights 
protection has improved.  The country is party to 
numerous conventions and agreements regarding patent, 
trademark and copyright protection, and laws generally 
favor intellectual property owners and impose criminal 
penalties on violations of owners\' rights.  The GON has 
introduced legislation to create a quasi-independent 
intellectual property rights commission and bring 
Nigeria into full compliance with the WTO TRIPS 
agreement.  Licensed software and visual materials are 
better protected now than they once were.  Still, 
scarce resources and a lack of expertise make 
enforcement of intellectual property rights difficult. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
POVERTY REDUCTION AND PROMOTION OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
 
9. (U) The GON recently unveiled a new economic plan, 
the National Economic Empowerment and Development 
Strategy, that outlines strategies for attaining macro- 
economic stability (with emphasis on low inflation and 
stable interest and exchange rates), achieving annual 
GDP growth of 5-7 percent, and reducing poverty.  The 
plan reflects the GON\'s commitment to fiscal discipline 
and public sector reforms and emphasizes health, 
education and agriculture.  If the plan is implemented 
effectively (a far from certain prospect), the GON may 
begin to make progress in improving the living 
standards of the two-thirds of Nigerians who live in 
poverty. 
 
 
10. (U) The GON continues to promote the development of 
private enterprise through its Small and Medium 
Industries Equity Investment Scheme, under which banks 
are required to set aside 10 percent of before-tax 
profits for equity investments in industrial 
enterprises.  80 banks had set aside $103 million but 
had invested only ten percent of the available funds in 
36 different projects as of December 2002. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT CORRUPTION 
---------------------------- 
 
 
11. (U) Nigeria continues to make progress toward 
reducing corruption.  A federal anti-corruption 
commission is in place, and public enterprises are 
regularly audited.  The GON awards government contracts 
under an increasingly transparent open tender system 
and now subjects federally funded capital projects over 
USD 10,000 to due diligence tests.  In general, the GON 
has succeeded in reducing the most blatant forms of 
corruption; it has been less successful, however, in 
preventing back-room maneuvers that bias decisions. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED WORKER RIGHTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
 
12. (U) The Nigerian Constitution protects the right of 
association and the right to organize and bargain 
collectively, but several statutory restrictions remain 
in place.  Only one labor federation, the Nigeria Labor 
Congress, is recognized, but the GON has indicated that 
it may amend existing legislation to allow multiple 
trade federations. 
 
 
13. (U) Nigerian law outlaws forced or bonded labor, 
prohibits the employment of children younger than age 
15 in commerce and industry, and restricts other child 
labor to home-based agricultural or domestic work for a 
maximum of 8 hours per day.  Minimum wages, hours of 
work, and general health and safety provisions are 
statutorily mandated, but enforcement remains weak. 
The private sector\'s reliance on casual or part-time 
labor is a problem, particularly as casual workers are 
denied benefits and prohibited from joining labor 
unions.  The GON has been slow to address the issue, 
but increasingly loud protests from Nigerian workers 
may prompt progress. 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY INTERESTS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
 
14. (U) Nigeria does not engage in activities that 
undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy 
interests. 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
15. (U) The GON\'s human rights performance has been 
mixed.  There have been improvements in several areas, 
but serious problems remain.  Nigeria does not support 
international terrorism; on the contrary, it has been a 
staunch ally in the U.S.-led war on terror.

E.O. 12598: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, EPET, PGOV, KDEM, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NLC MEETS TO PLAN MASS ACTION IN RESPONSE 
TO FURTHER INCREASE IN FUEL PRICES 
 
1.  The battle lines now appeared to be drawn between 
government and labor over possible fuel price increases. 
Long queues at gas stations throughout the country reflect 
speculation that the GON might announce further increases in 
fuel prices as early as October 1. 
 
 
2.  The Central Working Committee of the Nigeria Labor 
Congress (NLC) held an emergency meeting in Lagos on 
September 29 to discuss a response to a possible price hike. 
The NLC believes Obasanjo will announce GON plans to 
deregulate the petroleum industry\'s downstream sector and 
encourage oil marketers to charge whatever price they want 
for petroleum products. 
 
 
3.  Following its meeting, the NLC vowed publicly to resist 
any further increase in gas prices and warned it will not 
hesitate to recommence its suspended strike action of last 
June to protest an earlier price hike.  The NLC\'s National 
Executive Council plans meet on October 6 in Lagos to 
continue mapping out its plans for a nationwide strike. 
Already, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Lagos-based 
Committee for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR) have warned 
that they are prepared to support protestors who participate 
in the planned strike. 
 
 
4.  Comment:  An announcement by Obasanjo of an increase in 
gas prices anytime in the next two weeks will be ill timed 
given that Nigeria is hosting the 8th All Africa Games in 
Abuja.  Last June\'s fuel price hike, and the nationwide 
industrial action that followed, occurred one week before 
the visit of President Bush to Nigeria.  Many believe that 
the GON was forced to lower prices to avoid the perception 
of instability during the presidential visit.   Mass action 
during the All Africa Games would present a similar threat. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: THE SEX TRADE TO THE US AND EUROPE: MEETING WITH 
DUTCH DCM, LAGOS 
 
 
Classified By: CG Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: POLOFF met with Gerrit Van Hemert, Deputy 
Head of Mission for the Netherlands Consulate General in 
Lagos on 17 September to discuss patterns of trafficking of 
women for the sex trade to Europe. Van Hemert, who has 
studied the subject for three years, laid out a pattern of 
trafficking from Nigeria to the US via West Africa and South 
America, using Miami as the port of entry.  Tactics used in 
the trade include various forms of visa fraud: obtaining and 
traveling with multiple identities and using impostors to 
travel with valid passports and visas.  Collusion within the 
Nigerian government is believed to reach senior levels of the 
Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) and traditional rulers. 
Embassies in Cotonou and Lome are often seen as weak points 
to obtain valid visas for the US and Europe.  It is believed 
that trafficked women may also be involved in the drug trade. 
In a separate conversation, Father Emmanuel Adetoyese Badejo 
of the Catholic Secretariat confirmed most of Van Hemert\'s 
assertions. END SUMMARY 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
 
2. (C) Van Hemert has been serving in Lagos for the past 
three years and has been involved  in addressing the issue of 
human trafficking for the Government of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands (GOKN) in the region.  He has coordinated with 
Government of Nigeria (GON) officials regarding deportation 
of sex slaves and has personally traveled to Lome, the port 
of departure for travel to South America.  In addition, he 
has conducted several interviews with trafficked women, 
detailing the patterns of their travel. 
 
 
EDO STATE, THE ROTTEN APPLE OF NIGERIA 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (C) Trafficked Nigerian women are in their late teens and 
twenties, are single, have beauty traits valued in Europe and 
the United States, and may have limited or general education. 
 Almost all trafficked women originate from Benin City, Edo 
State or its neighboring communities, which Van Hemert 
describes as the \"sick, rotten apple of Nigeria.\"  He claims 
Edo State has a \"cultural and economic system built on human 
trafficking and prostitution\" and believes that Omo n\'Oba 
Erediauwa, the Oba of Benin (traditional king), and his High 
Priest, Chief Nosakhure Isekhure, are involved in the 
trafficking syndicate.  Van Hemert has interviewed 
approximately 10 to 12 trafficked women per year at the Dutch 
Consulate General who were applying for legal residence 
permits. He stated that each were willing to discuss their 
experiences in Europe and how they reached the Netherlands, 
but none were willing to name individuals who either 
facilitated their migration in Europe or are key members of 
the syndicate in Edo State and Nigeria.  Benin City is the 
ancient capital of the Benin Kingdom and its traditional 
monarch, the Oba of Benin, exercises great power.  Although 
Nigeria is largely Moslem or Christian, most still believe in 
voodoo or juju.  Benin City, through high priests, has made 
great efforts to maintain the traditional practices and 
religion of voodoo.  POLOFF had the opportunity to visit a 
senior high priest, Osemwegie Ebohon, and his voodoo cultural 
center on 14 September.  Ebohon is a frequent visitor to 
Broward County, Florida.  (Note: In December 1999, the Dutch 
African Studies Centre published in Dutch \"An Appearance of 
Voodoo: Cultural Background of the Trade in Nigerian Girls 
for Dutch Prostitution - An Exploration\" and detailed the 
connection between the sex trade and voodoo.) 
 
 
4. (U) The International Organization of Migration (IOM) has 
based its offices in Benin City and tracks many of the 
stories of the returnees.  (An IOM official in Lagos told CG 
that 99% of females deported through Lagos are from Benin 
City.)  According to Elvira Gregoire of IOM in Benin City, 
trafficked women \"never disclose their sponsors\' identities 
for fear of putting their families at risk\" and are 
apprehensive to break their \"oath of secrecy\" that they gave 
before being trafficked.  (\"Oaths of secrecy\" are a common 
practice in voodoo.)  Gregoire further stated that trafficked 
women are often made to pay back a debt of $20,000 - $50,000 
incurred through their migration to destination countries. 
Once in Europe, their \"madams\" seize their travel and 
identity documents and place them under 24 hour surveillance 
while having them practice prostitution.  In addition to 
debriefing repatriated trafficked women, IOM assists with 
food, toiletries, family contact, and transportation back 
home. 
 
 
TRACKING THE TRAFFICKED 
----------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) Trafficked women destined to Miami and the United 
States go through a long transiting process.  Van Hemert 
claimed traffickers look for the \"weak links\" in 
the system.  Women from Edo travel to Cotonou and Lome, he 
said, to apply for US and Schengen (European Union) visas. 
If successful, many women return to Lagos to apply for Dutch 
transit visas to travel on KLM.  If unsuccessful, they travel 
to the Port of Lome and are put on fishing boats to South 
America.  Van Hemert visited Lome to see the port himself and 
was shown which boats were available for transit across the 
Atlantic.  He said the process was very easy and relatively 
inexpensive and characterized the vessels as barely sea 
worthy, surmising that many may have been lost at sea.  Van 
Hemert further stated that women regularly traveled with two 
or three passports using different identities and sometimes 
different nationalities, in particular Ivoirian.  Destination 
countries in South America are primarily Guyana and to a 
lesser degree Suriname and Venezuela.  Once in Guyana, 
trafficked women either apply for US and Schengen visas, 
obtain fraudulent visas, or travel via boat to Caribbean 
islands with European or American protectorate status, 
through which they enter the destination countries.  He 
specified Miami as the port of entry for the United States 
from the Caribbean and South America.  Based on this pattern, 
Van Hemert was amazed that a \"few weeks ago\" the USG \"took 
Suriname off its trafficking list.\"  Van Hemert stated that 
the Dutch Consulate General here has seen many fraudulent 
Surinamese visas from Nigerian applicants and has heard 
reports of counterfeit Surinamese currency in Nigeria.  He 
said that he refuses all transit visa requests that contain 
Surinamese and US visas. 
 
 
6. (C)  The European trafficking pattern is very organized 
and is operated much like an underground railroad by Nigerian 
women who are married to European men and serve as guides and 
madams.  Most trafficked women enter Europe via Barcelona, 
Spain which is known by Van Hemert to be a \"weak link.\" 
According to Van Hemert, a Spanish madam meets the trafficked 
women at the Barcelona airport and provides them food and 
housing and a plane ticket onward to Brussels. Once in 
Brussels, the women are met by a Dutch madam and taken to the 
Netherlands. Some women stay in Amsterdam to work, but others 
are taken to Arnhem, Netherlands on the German border and 
work at a specific bar there as prostitutes. Their passports 
are surrendered and the women then transit to Italy, the 
ultimate destination country, where the demand is greatest. 
 
 
COLLUSION OF TRAFFICKERS AND SENIOR NIGERIAN IMMIGRATION 
OFFICIALS? 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
7. (C) Van Hemert reported that starting in June 2003, the 
Netherlands has chartered two flights back to Lagos 
containing 47 and 53 trafficked women respectively.  He 
explained that previously, GOKN and the Nigerian Immigration 
Service (NIS) had a good working relationship.  On several 
occasions, GOKN has paid for NIS officials to travel to the 
Netherlands and help identify trafficked Nigerian women for 
deportation.  He characterized the current relationship as 
strained, however. Dutch confidence has been lost in NIS as 
they believe that air tickets meant for other West Africans 
mistakenly deported to Nigeria have been confiscated by NIS 
officials and used for their own purposes.  As a result, GOKN 
now provides cars for deportees to return to their countries 
of origin from Nigeria.  In addition, NIS has demanded that 
more officials visit the Netherlands to view their operations 
and receive $500 per diem while visiting. NIS has also made 
numerous visa requests for private individuals going on 
tourism.  Van Hemert also has a strained personal 
relationship with Dr. Baba Jide Brown, Assistant Comptroller 
General of Immigration and head of the division that covers 
Lagos.  He finds it interesting that Dr. Brown has been in 
his position for 20 years despite Nigeria\'s tumultuous 
political history and succession of democratic and military 
governments.  He also views the U.S.-educated Dr. Brown as 
arrogant and questions how he is able to afford his 
lifestyle.  As a result of this strained relationship, a 
chartered flight of trafficked women from Amsterdam scheduled 
for 22 September was canceled by NIS. 
 
 
8. (C) Van Hemert reported that he has interviewed several 
women who initially claimed that they had lost their Schengen 
Visa or Dutch Residency Permit.  Upon further interview, the 
women, who were apparently legitimate travelers, revealed 
that as they were about to board their flights for the 
Netherlands, a NIS official requested to meet with them in an 
office.  Once in the office, the womens\' passports are taken 
and the women claim to have been detained at the airport for 
two and three days.  Van Hemert stated that he believes \"look 
alikes\" then take the passports and travel with them.  He 
also believes that these passports are circulated and are 
used by many women. Van Hemert also asserted that trafficked 
women are likely used in the drug trade as well during their 
travels throughout the trafficking routes.  Of the 12 
Nigerian lawyers and investigators on staff at the Dutch 
Consulate General, none will go to the airport to investigate 
these allegations for fear of reprisals or assassinations. 
 
 
 
 
CONFIRMATION FROM CATHOLIC SECRETARIAT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
9. (C) Badejo confirmed the prevalence of trafficking women 
to Europe and the US from 
Edo State and called the state the \"capitol of traffickers.\" 
He further confirmed the collusion of government officials 
and traditional rulers with traffickers and stated that 
voodoo, coercion, and threat of violence are used to quiet 
the trafficked.  The Secretariat has programs in Benin City 
that offers rehabilitation services and counseling for 
trafficked women.  Nigerian nuns and priests are also located 
in Europe, providing similar services.  In 2002, a Nigerian 
nun working with trafficked women was murdered in Italy. 
Badejo stated that many nuns and priests working there 
receive numerous threats from traffickers and unknown 
persons.  Badejo was not aware of South America as a 
transiting point for trafficking, but stated that traffickers 
work through agents in Benin, Cote d\'Ivoire, and Ghana.  In 
these countries, he said there are camps where women are 
\"instructed in their duties,\" informed of the costs of their 
travel, take voodoo oaths of secrecy, and sign agreements to 
repay their expenses.  Most women, Badejo stated, are aware 
that they are going to be prostitutes.  He said trafficking 
for prostitution is inculcated into the culture and that many 
women practice the trade to send money back to their 
families.  Societal pressure is intense on young women in Edo 
and Badejo characterized fathers as telling their daughters 
\"you are no use to me here.  Go to Europe and bring home 
money so that I can enjoy my old age.\" 
 
 
10. (C) COMMENT: The trafficking of women is an important 
component of international organized crime in Nigeria.  The 
effects are particularly acute in Europe and GOKN and the 
Government of Italy have amended their immigration laws to 
facilitate deportation of illegal immigrants in response to 
this and other problems.  Although Europe is the number one 
destination of trafficked women, it is believed that the 
trend in the United States may be growing.  The extent of the 
trade to the US is currently unknown, but the product of 
stricter enforcement of immigration laws by USG since 
September 11, 2001 may yield more information in the near 
future.  If Nigerians take great lengths to traffic women to 
Europe via South America, they are also likely to traffic 
women to the United States and it may be a matter of time 
before effects of the trade are seen. 
 
 
11. (C) It is difficult to document how the trafficking 
syndicate is organized.  Nigerian society is marked by 
corruption at every level and it is not surprising that it 
may include senior NIS officials and traditional rulers.  The 
lack of cooperation from trafficked women in identifying 
members of the syndicate, the appropriate fear of possible 
reprisals and assassinations, and the nature of Nigerian 
bureaucracy make confirming this information extremely 
difficult.  However, Van Hemert is well versed on the issue 
and his three years of experience lends his assertions 
credibility.  Affected posts should be mindful of the 
phenomenon of trafficked Nigerian women and ascertain whether 
they may be applying for U.S. visas. Information shared by 
the Secretariat and Van Hemert also begs another question: 
are the women truly trafficked or smuggled illegal immigrants 
seeking economic gain? END COMMENT

SUBJECT: NLC PLANS TO BOYCOTT ALL AFRICA GAMES AS PART OF A 
NATIONAL PROTEST AGAINST THE GAS PRICE HIKE 
 
REF: LAGOS 02043 ABUJA 01700 
 
 
Classified By: Laboff Michael Veasy Reason: 1.5 (B & D) 
 
 
1. (U)  On October 1, gas stations throughout the nation 
increased their prices from 34 naira per liter to 39.5 naira 
in Lagos and Abuja and as much as 60 naira per liter in 
several states in the east. While the majority of gas 
stations have raised prices (a handful of Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) pumps are still charging 34 
naira).  Although the GON announced the start of deregulation 
of gas prices, it did not specifically mention an increase. 
Following the price hike, The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) 
announced that it plans to protest the overnight increases in 
fuel prices by calling a general strike and asking all 
Nigerians not to attend the upcoming All Africa Games. 
 
 
2. (U)  The NLC has moved up its National Executive Council 
meeting from October 6 to October 4 in Ibadan so that labor 
leaders have more time to organize if they decide to begin 
mass protest on Monday.  Labor leaders also met with 
forty-two human rights organizations in Lagos midday on 
October 3 to formulate a unified strategy.  In addition, the 
NLC has received support from the Congress of Free Trade 
Unions (CFTU), Nigeria\'s newest trade union center.  The 
CFTU is comprised of senior staff associations who 
disassociated themselves from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) 
following complaints that the TUC leadership misled its 
constituents during the previous gas price strike in June. 
 
 
3. (U)  Laboff spoke with Bayo Olowoshile, Acting General 
Secretary of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff 
 
SIPDIS 
Association of Nigeria, who expressed concern about 
Nigeria\'s image as it prepares for the All Africa Games. 
PENGASSAN represents managers and senior-level employees 
within the petroleum sector.  Consistent with its softer 
stance during the previous strike, which prompted the TUC 
split, Olowoshile told Laboff that PENGASSAN is trying to 
convince the NLC to shelve the strike and seek other options. 
 However, NLC General Secretary John Odah said the NLC 
remains unsympathetic with regard to the impact on the games, 
since the GON was aware of the possible fallout. 
 
 
4. (C)  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole told Poloff that 
PENGASSAN is not on board for a national strike, but he 
thought they would come around when they were isolated.  He 
said NUPENG would not take independent action such as telling 
its workers to stop hauling gasoline.  However, he was quite 
loud and clear to poloff and several other interlocutors that 
the problem was Obasanjo trying to get his way without 
consulting, not deregulation per se.  He said Obasanjo could 
have talked with the NLC and other stakeholders about a small 
price hike if the GON needed money for the All Africa Games 
or other projects, and would probably have won agreement to 
adding 2-4 naira. 
 
 
5. (U)  In Lagos, labor leaders will probably extend their 
efforts to incorporate growing protests over recent 
restrictions on danfo buses, since they see the ban as 
another example of government policies that have increased 
transportation costs for Nigerian workers whose salaries are 
already well below an acceptable living wage.  Danfo buses 
serve as an informal public transportation system widely used 
throughout the country by a majority of Nigerians.  Workers 
claim that the decision to replace danfo buses with city 
buses in parts of Lagos has failed to provide viable options, 
since the new public transportation has extremely limited 
capacity to accommodate the large number of Nigerians who 
previously used the informal system.  In addition, the cost 
of public transportation has increased more than fifty 
percent. For example, commuters who paid 20 naira for danfo 
buses in Lagos are now paying 50 naira for 
government-operated transport. 
 
 
6. (C)  Comment:  The issue of gas price deregulation was 
noticeably absent from President Obasanjo\'s October 1 
Independence Day address, which has led to claims by NGOs and 
labor leaders that the GON intentionally deceived the 
Nigerian public.  Labor will use this claim to mobilize 
general support of its planned boycott of the All Africa 
games in Abuja.  Senior GON officials told Econoff that the 
deregulation decision was taken two weeks ago in the Federal 
Executive Council.  The GON plan was to say nothing and 
access the climate after deregulation took effect, adding 
that the non-announcement gives the GON the ability to fine 
tune its position if there is a major labor crisis. 
 
 
7. (U)  There is a fair amount of disingenuous behavior on 
both sides.  The GON is claiming that it deregulated but did 
not \"increase\" the price, while the unions claim that they 
were not warned.  In fact, everyone has been waiting since 
July for the price increase shoe to drop.  The outstanding 
question is whether the games or unrest will force the GON to 
back down again. 
 
 
8. (C)  For his part, Mobil Managing Director Mike Fry said 
that while he was not responsible for Mobil\'s downstream 
operations, he believed Mobil, CTN and Agip would all keep 
their prices across the country in the 38-39.5 naira band for 
October in response to the letter of instructions from the 
GON, but raise prices gradually to the 58-60 naira break-even 
price for importing gasoline.   End comment.

SUBJECT: THE IMPENDING STRIKE:  THE VIEW FROM LAGOS 
 
1.  (SBU) The looming showdown between the unions and the GON 
over fuel deregulation in Nigeria is about more than the fuel 
price.  Anecdotal comments from people in Lagos tell us they 
are very angry about the way the price increase was 
implemented without any direct announcement, as if the 
government was hoping citizens wouldn\'t notice.  As one 
officer of a civil society organization said, \"it was done in 
the most annoying way possible.\"  We\'re told it somehow seems 
symptomatic of the general disrespect on the part of 
President Obasanjo for the Nigerian people (\"he treats us 
like we\'re harlots:  use, then ignore,\" said one political 
contact).  The issue also brings focus to strongly held 
feelings about the corruption and unfairness of Nigerian 
society.  One worker said \"poor people like us are pressed 
for every last Naira for fuel, while retired generals smuggle 
whole tanker loads of it.\"  This being Obasanjo\'s last term, 
we have been told a number of times, a massive money grab is 
underway by the rich, and increasing the fuel price must have 
something to do with it. 
 
 
 
 
NUPENG and PENGASSEN 
-------------------- 
 
 
2.  (SBU) Acting Econ Chief and visiting INR officer saw the 
presidents of both petroleum unions NUPENG and PENGASSEN 
midday Friday October 3.  Neither union is as yet committed 
to a strike, but NUPENG President Peter Akpatason was more 
forward leaning (\"...all signals indicate a strike\"). 
PENGASSEN President Ogbeifun Louis Brown said its strike 
policy would be determined by its umbrella organization, the 
TUC, which will meet the week of October 6 (date TBD). 
NUPENG\'s strike position will most likely be locked in 
Saturday, October 4, when the NLC meets in Ibadan.  Although 
they are members of different umbrella labor groups, the 
positions of the two unions had much in common.  The 
interests at stake for both are much broader than the price 
increase itself.  Both referred us to a two-part \"ultimatum\" 
they have given the GON:  (1) one week to respond to their 
request for a dialogue on petroleum policy, and (2) an 
explanation of the government\'s position on \"the issues of 
price adjustment, maintenance of the refineries, ports and 
other infrastructural development in the downstream sector as 
well as the planned privatization of NNPC...\" 
 
 
3.  (SBU) We asked both unions what the threat conveyed in 
the ultimatum actually was; the text refers to \"any action we 
might deem fit...,\" but neither could tell us what \"action\" 
that might be.  Despite outraged references by both unions to 
the price hike, both were quite prepared to see substantially 
higher prices if that is what it would take to make domestic 
Nigerian refineries viable.  The clearly evident bottom line 
was to secure the employment of their members in the 
refineries.  If the public had to pay above market rates in 
consequence, so be it.  It was noteworthy that neither union 
president knew what current world prices for petroleum 
products are, nor what prices in other west African countries 
are (in both cases, much higher than in Nigeria). 
 
 
The Yoruba View 
--------------- 
 
 
4.  (SBU) Acting Econ Chief and visiting INR officer also 
visited a senior officer in Afenifere, the principal Yoruba 
organization, for his views on the impending strike.  He was 
about to leave for the midday meeting between Lagos\' civil 
society organizations and the NLC, but told us that on Monday 
the country \"would be ungovernable,\" and that violence would 
break out far more quickly than it did in July.  The \"area 
boys\" (street thugs) would take immediate advantage of the 
situation to loot vehicles and make travel impossible.  For 
him too, the point of the confrontation with the government 
was not really the price increase, but rather rampant 
corruption and Obasanjo\'s dismissive attitude toward the 
public.  He worried, though, that a serious confrontation 
could be employed by the military to return to power, with 
some real public support. 
 
 
Danfos 
------ 
 
 
5.  (U) There is in addition a brand new irritant:  the 
banning from Victoria and Ikoyi Islands (in daylight hours) 
of danfos, the dilapidated orange minivans on which the 
overwhelming majority of Lagos residents depend.  In their 
place is an as yet limited fleet of city buses.  From the 
narrow, technocratic perspective of the transportation 
planner this may make sense; lots of small, noisy vehicles 
replaced by large buses, fares paid to thousands of 
individual operators replaced by fares paid to a state 
operation.  The timing, however, reflects an almost surreally 
bad sense of judgement; the ban was implemented on the same 
day as the fuel price increase, and now disgruntled crowds 
gather at the control points where the danfos are halted 
waiting for onward transportation that will cost nearly twice 
as much.  Not nearly enough buses are available yet.

SUBJECT: BETWEEN THE HAMMER AND THE ANVIL:  THE PROPOSED 
WAGE HIKES 
 
 
1.  (SBU) The likely wage increases looming over the Nigerial 
fiscal landscape will affect the already difficult situation 
of both the federal and state governments.  The federal 
government has (apparently) committed itself to a 12.5 
percent increase in workers\' salaries, at least at the lowest 
levels of the pay scale.  The federal government is being 
deliberately vague about its understanding of the agreement 
(if that is what it is), possibly because it can\'t really 
afford to pay what it is already paying.  The federal 
government is going increasingly into debt just to meet its 
current obligations, but most of the 36 states are in much 
worse shape, and view a federal wage hike with unadulterated 
dread.  Their workers will want the same deal, but many of 
the states are already in the process of fiscal collapse. 
Some are bankrupt or as good as, and often pay their workers 
intermittently.  State workers in Anambra state recently went 
six months without pay, while Osun and Lagos states fell 
three months behind; Kogi, Kwara, and several other states 
are a year in arrears. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  The states are really between the hammer and the 
anvil.  With the exception of the oil producing states and 
Lagos, they have little control over their incomes.  They 
live month-to-month on allotments from the federal government 
and spend almost their entire budgets on salaries.  Since 
most states have few non-salary expenses to cut to stay 
within budget, the prospect of matching a federal wage hike 
is a real threat.  The 36 governors, meeting recently to 
consider the situation, issued a statement saying they were 
unable to match the federal government\'s pay raise.  Last 
week, however, two northern states (Nasarawa and Zamfara) 
broke ranks in a fit of bravado (or one-upsmanship they can\'t 
afford, as they are among the poorest) to announce they will 
pay the increase.  Some of the oil-producing Delta states are 
reported to be able to pay but the hapless majority echo the 
federal government in warning that the pay increase must 
inevitably result in layoffs. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  The unions, of course, have seen this coming, and 
are warning against reductions.  It\'s not that the state and 
federal governments don\'t have the money to pay wage 
increases, they say, it\'s that they waste the money through 
mismanagement and corruption, and their incompetence and 
corruption aren\'t the union\'s problem.  The unions have a 
point; without endemic corruption and mismanagement the 
governments could pay the increase and perhaps much more. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Part of the governments\' mismanagement, 
however, is that they have too many workers, an inconvenient 
fact the unions ignore.  Furthermore, the unions want wage 
increases now.  It isn\'t at all clear when the federal and 
state governments will actually get rid of mismanagement and 
corruption, but it is overwhelmingly obvious that it isn\'t 
going to be \"now.\"  Or even soon.  So the stage is set for a 
confrontation; a similar showdown in 2000 resulted in 
nationwide strikes and concessions by the governments. 
Ultimately, the state and federal governments will agree to 
spend more than they can, governments will borrow more and 
pay back less, and their workers will be paid less often. 
Services will suffer, and civil servants will continue to 
moonlight and resort to corruption to survive.  Thus the can 
gets kicked down the road, and nothing substantial changes.

1.  Following its emergency National Executive Council (NEC) 
meeting in Ibadan on Saturday, October 4, the Nigeria Labour 
Congress (NLC) announced a nationwide strike to begin at midnight 
on Thursday, October 9.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole said the 
Thursday start date allows labor leaders and NGOs to strengthen 
their mobilization efforts and gives workers time to prepare for 
the anticipated long battle with the GON.  Oshiomhole said the 
strike and campaign against price deregulation in the oil sector 
will be managed under the auspices of a broad coalition of trade 
unions, civil society organizations, and other NGOs.  This 
partnership will be known as the Labor Civil Society Coalition 
(LASCO).  LASCO has demanded that gas prices return to the pre- 
October 1 rate of 34 naira per liter, the repair and full 
operation of all local refineries, and a publication of contracts 
awarded for the repair of refineries. 
 
 
2.  Oshiomhole said the decision to deregulate fuel prices is not 
a party policy or party agenda, but solely that of a President 
\"who does not care about the plight of his people.\"  He added that 
previous administrations offered specific strategies regarding the 
use of money derived from such increases while the GON has not 
explained how it plans to spend the money saved by deregulating 
gas prices.  Oshiomhole also warned that price hikes will occur 
regularly and could reach two hundred naira before the end of 
Obasanjo\'s tenure. 
 
 
3.  Aviation workers under the National Union of Transport Workers 
(NUATE) and Air Transport Service Senior Staff Association of 
Nigeria (ATSSAN) have decided to join the strike and advised 
airlines not to use Nigerian airspace.   Unlike the July strike to 
protest an earlier price hike, ATSSAN claims air traffic 
controllers are prepared to join the effort, which would likely 
ground both domestic and international flights.   Uncertainty 
regarding air travel in Nigeria may affect the All Africa Games, 
prompting many international visitors to consider whether they 
should leave early or risk being trapped in Nigeria until the 
crisis is resolved. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Comment:  While the least likely scenario would be a 
resolution that includes a return to regulated prices and 
government subsidies, it is still not clear how the GON will react 
to the planned strike.  Despite a deteriorating relationship 
between the GON and NLC, Oshiomhole maintains a good working 
relationship with Obasanjo and will likely seek a negotiated 
resolution.  If the two sides reach an agreement, Oshiomhole will 
have to sell it to a constituency that already believes the GON 
does not bargain in good faith, as the government has failed to 
implement several agreements during the past year. 
 
 
5. The GON continues to defend its decision to deregulate the 
downstream sector, however, President Obasanjo and several top 
government chieftains have consistently dissociated themselves 
from actual increases in gas prices.  Instead, government 
officials have been quick to blame oil marketers for the price 
hikes.  The GON will likely refuse to negotiate the issue of gas 
prices with labor under the pretext that it is not responsible for 
the increases.  A prolonged strike may force the GON to consider a 
strategy that defines how the GON plans to spend money saved by 
deregulating prices.  This type of agreement is not without 
precedent.  The two previous administrations addressed criticism 
of increased fuel prices by establishing socioeconomic development 
initiatives.  Babangida formed the Directorate for Food, Road and 
Rural Infrastructure and Abacha established the Petroleum Trust 
Fund.  We predict that LASCO will back down on the issue of 
deregulation, but it could push for a resolution that redirects 
funds previously used for subsidizing imported fuel to repair 
Nigeria\'s refineries and promote economic development.  However, 
it will be virtually impossible for the refineries to be brought 
up to anything approaching a competitive standard in the near 
future. 
 
 
6.  The duration of the strike depends largely on labor\'s ability 
to convince Trade Union Congress (TUC) associations to join the 
effort, particularly air traffic controllers under ATSSAN and the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria 
(PENGASSAN).  ATSSAN would have a significant impact on 
international travel at a time when Nigeria is hosting thousands 
of international visitors, while the Department of Petroleum 
Resources (DPR) employees under PENGASSAN can affect the oil 
industry\'s ability to export petroleum products.  DPR is Nigeria\'s 
oil and gas industry\'s regulatory body responsible for authorizing 
crude oil exports.  Their involvement may bring the two sides to 
the negotiating table sooner than expected.  End comment.

PRICE SHOWDOWN

1.  (SBU) Summary:  According to Chevron management some two 
weeks ago President Obasanjo ordered the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to cancel all outstanding orders 
for refined petroleum products, thus committing the country 
to an abrupt course of petroleum market reform and 
liberalization.  Union and NGO reaction was to call for a 
general strike.  Oil companies met among themselves October 6 
and will meet with their unions and the NNPC October 7 to 
plot a course and to decide whether jointly to order a tanker 
load of refined product to put fuel in the Nigerian pipeline. 
 The downstream traders must assess the likelihood of being 
allowed to sell the fuel here at a market price.  They have 
assurances from the GON that they can, but the issue is 
highly political, and they will be prepared to divert the 
tanker until the last moment.  The outcome of the decision is 
not yet known.  Chevron believes the petroleum unions may 
have lost control of their own policy in the current crisis, 
and are being swept along towards a strike that is not in 
their best interests.  End Summary 
 
 
What\'s broken, and why 
---------------------- 
2.  (C)  CG Lagos and Consulate officers met with senior 
management at Chevron/Texaco October 6 for an extensive 
discussion of upstream and downstream petroleum issues 
(upstream, septel).  Under the current system, we were told, 
the NNPC imports all refined product and apportions it in a 
strikingly non-transparent manner among the 1000 or so 
independent distributors and the 6 major oil companies in the 
downstream market.  The supply is sharply limited by several 
logistical bottlenecks at Lagos port, so distribution is 
strictly a zero-sum game -- a situation guaranteed to give 
rise to the extensive bribery said to plague the NNPC.  Many 
of these independents don\'t actually sell in Nigeria at all; 
a sign and a canopy over some pumps are all that is required 
to get a distribution license from the NNPC.  These 
distributors, license in hand, fill their tankers at the NNPC 
and deliver the gas across the border.  Independents who do 
sell in Nigeria buy from the NNPC at the subsidized price and 
sell not at the N34 they are supposed to charge but at the 
highest price their locality can support. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Having done very nicely on the initial sale the 
independents improve matters by paying taxes on their volume 
as if they had sold the petrol for N34; an underpayment that 
Chevron believes costs the GON $1 billion a year.  The status 
quo is a high performance cash cow for the independent 
operators and the NNPC bureaucracy, two powerful opponents of 
reform.  The irony, of course, is that these people get rich 
by operating a defacto free market system, while consumers 
are gouged by shortages and exhorbitant prices. 
 
 
4.  (C)  The government is also getting fleeced.  The NNPC 
pays $2 billion a year to buy refined product abroad at 
market prices and pass it on to distributors at a subsidized 
price.  Added to the $1 billion in under-collected taxes, 
that is almost  seven percent of Nigeria\'s GDP, but there is 
more:  crude that could have been exported at $29 a barrel is 
provided to country\'s refineries at $22 a barrel.  In 
Chevron\'s view, President Obasanjo is personally persuaded 
that the system must be fundamentally altered, but does not 
trust anyone below the top leadership of the NNPC.  During 
the summer he personally \"took over the (petroleum) file\" and 
began working with a small alternative body, the Petroleum 
Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, to help him transform the 
downstream petroleum economy.  10 to 14 days ago, Chevron 
says, Obasanjo personally directed the NNPC to cancel all its 
contracts for supply of refined product (the NNPC had already 
contracted deliveries for the fourth quarter of \'03 and the 
first quarter of next year).  He then informed the oil 
companies that they would be able to import what they wanted 
and sell it at market price, with the request that they not 
exceed N40 per liter in the first month.  This draconian 
step, just before his October 1 announcement of petroleum 
market liberalization, seems intended to demonstrate that the 
bridges back to the old system have been burned; if so, it is 
a bold gesture. 
 
 
Fixing it, and cutting the unions\' power 
---------------------------------------- 
5.  (SBU)  At present Nigeria has seven to ten days of 
refined product on hand.  Nothing is in the pipeline.  The 
pricing baton has been handed abruptly to the oil companies, 
and they are deliberating what to do with it.  They met with 
their unions,  amongst themselves, and with the petroleum 
unions and the NNPC; the outcome is not yet known.  They are 
consulting among themselves to decide whether to pool 
resources and order a tanker load of fuel as a test case. 
The ship would lift in South Africa, and during its three to 
four days enroute the companies will monitor the fluid and 
intensely political situation here to gauge whether it will 
be possible to sell the cargo at market rates.  If it appears 
questionable they will divert the ship to a different market 
in the region. 
 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  This is real brinksmanship on Obasanjo\'s 
part.  As the ship nears Lagos the country will be down to a 
few days reserve.  If the unions prevent it from discharging, 
he will take the country\'s empty fuel tanks and beat the 
unions over the head with them.  Obasanjo has already handed 
the unions the opportunity to disrupt the All Africa Games; 
an object of great national pride.  Now the unions must 
grapple with the awkward dilemma of what to do about the 
temptation; despite a rather puny call for Nigerians to stay 
away, so far the unions (and the population) have avoided 
using the Games to show their displeasure.  Chevron thinks 
Obasanjo\'s subtext in setting this crisis in motion at this 
time is to lure the unions into a series of untenable 
positions with the intent of curbing their power.  Obasanjo 
is not presenting an easy target and is making it harder for 
the opposition to agree on what the target (the government or 
the companies) actually is.  End Comment 
 
 
7.  (C)  Chevron thinks (and we agree) there isn\'t much 
solidarity between the two petroleum unions (NUPENG and 
PENGASSAN) and the rest of the opposition.  Chevron has been 
talking to its unions and is sure they understand that 
deregulation is good for them in the long run.  It means a 
larger, more efficient downstream sector and more gas going 
into gas tanks at a better price.  The unions know (they have 
told us as much) that the price of a liter of gas isn\'t the 
real issue here; it\'s the overall structure of the sector -- 
how much is imported, how much is refined here, and where and 
how it\'s refined -- that matters.  The unions, according to 
Chevron, have 25,000 well paid members sitting (mostly) idle 
in Nigeria\'s four refineries (which, again according to 
Chevron, really need 6000 workers), and they know well that 
those refineries cannot compete in price with imports sold at 
market prices. 
 
 
Making a deal 
------------- 
 
 
8.  (C)  Chevron believes the GON thinks its delapidated 
refineries at Kaduna and Part Harcourt II are salvageable. 
Our late-night conversations October 6 with the presidents of 
the petroleum unions suggest different mixes of salvagable 
capacity, but the common element is there:  a triage 
assessment, followed by a commitment to make competitive (at 
a market price in a deregulated sector) some subset of 
Nigeria\'s current capacity.  This is, however, not what the 
other unions and NGOs are looking for; they (and the public) 
are angry about a lot of things and don\'t care much about the 
subtleties that matter to the petroleum unions.  There will 
be intense pressure on those unions to reject a separate 
peace, and they may not be able to resist it; Chevron 
certainly believes they may be swept away in the current of 
popular anger over higher fuel prices.

1. (C) Haruna John (PROTECT), Deputy Commissioner of Police 
(DCP) resident in Lagos State gave Pol/Econ Officer an update 
on police preparedness for the planned nationwide strike on 
October 9.  According to John, the police force is not/not 
prepared to deal with potential problems that a strike may 
cause due to the GON\'s failure to supply funds for purchase 
of police vehicles, fuel and other needed equipment.  It is 
his unhappy impression that the federal government is more 
than negligent and is actually \"unwilling\" to support the 
police. 
 
 
2. (C) John complained that the GON had not given the police 
advance notice of its intention to raise fuel prices October 
1 to allow the police to prepare for possible demonstrations 
or violence.  The police have taken what steps they could, 
under the circumstances, and placed 17,000-18,000 police on 
standby; however, John pointed out that the force will be 
short of fuel for the few vehicles it has.  He added that in 
past emergencies his officers had to ask friends and family 
to pay for or supply fuel for the cars used for mobile 
patrols.  He also said the force has no tear gas for crowd 
control. 
 
 
3.  (C) The DPC further said that the Oodu\'a Peoples Congress 
(OPC), a Yoruba vigilante organization, has publicly stated 
its intention to involve itself in the strike.  He sees the 
OPC as an \"ethnic militia\" that is better equipped than the 
police and could thus possibly thwart any police action.  He 
added that OPC members are rumored to have links with 
high-level Lagos-based political operatives and will provoke 
violence on order from these operatives.  If the OPC involves 
itself in the strike, John believes there will be more 
trouble this time than during the strike last June when eight 
people where killed.  John said the police had received much 
bad publicity following the June strike.  But despite 
investigations by both the Senate and House of 
Representatives, it has not yet been determined if the police 
was at fault in any of the deaths.  John said this time 
around the police may not be as willing to defuse angry 
crowds of protesters or demonstrators as they were in June. 
Concluding that he and other officials have decided not to 
take risks if a strike occurs, he said, \"our hands are tied.\"

1. (SBU) Summary: Chima Ubani, Executive Director of the 
Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), told us that labor and 
civil society leaders meeting on October 4 and 6 decided to 
begin a two-week general strike on Thursday, October 9. 
Demonstrations will be held on Thursday in Lagos, Abuja and 
Kano, with additional demonstrations slated for the 
Southeast.  A similar scenario is expected for Monday, 
October 13, but the demonstrations\' intensity may be undercut 
by the possible absence of one or both of the two petroleum 
unions, the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior 
Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN).  Conversations with 
the unions\' presidents late on October 6 suggested that the 
unions are under pressure to strike but are actually willing 
to work with the GON to resolve the deregulation issue.  End 
summary. 
 
 
STRIKE AND DEMONSTRATIONS: NOT A REPEAT OF JULY 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
2. (SBU) Ubani said labor organizers and their civil society 
partners learned important lessons from the \"fizzled\" strike 
in July 2003 and are determined not to have a repeat 
performance.  The October 4 and 6 meetings of labor and civil 
society leaders resulted in the formation of an umbrella 
organization called the Labor Civil Society Coalition (LASCO) 
(Ref C) and the creation of a national framework for the 
strike and demonstrations.  Local meetings to detail, \"fine 
tune\" and set up a \"framework for location control\" were also 
set in motion.  LASCO, he says, has planned for a two-week 
action.  Ubani recognizes that two weeks is a long time; the 
\"actual period will be determined on the ground,\" he said. 
Demonstrations have been organized for Lagos, Abuja and Kano, 
and others may be held in Enugu, Port Harcourt and Awka, 
Anambra State.  According to Ubani, Lagos will be the 
\"national center\" of demonstrations, with most taking place 
on the mainland in Yaba and Ikeja with possible rallies in 
Mushin and Akegbala.  Ubani did not believe Lagos Island, 
Ikoyi or Victoria Island would see demonstrations and noted 
that without many vehicles traveling, it would be difficult 
for demonstrators to reach the islands. 
 
 
THE PLAYERS AND THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT 
---------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) Ubani named four national leaders who are in charge 
of LASCO demonstrations: Adams Oshiomole, President of the 
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC), Bamidele Aturu, President of 
United Action for Democracy (UAD), Dr. Jibirin Ibrahim, 
President of the Citizen\'s Forum for Constitutional Reform, 
and Mr. Didi Ododo, General Secretary of the Congress of 
Federal Trade Unions (CFTU).  Aturu will hold a press 
conference Tuesday morning to announce the planned 
demonstrations in Lagos and call on the general public to 
participate.  (Note: CLO is affiliated with UAD, the umbrella 
human rights organization that won prominence fighting the 
Abacha regime.  CLO was then and is still considered one of 
the prominent leaders of the Nigerian human rights 
community.)  Ubani said that LASCO would wait to see how the 
government responds to the announcement but reported that 
LASCO would probably forge ahead with its plans. 
 
 
TO STRIKE OR NOT TO STRIKE, THAT IS THE QUESTION 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Ubani reported that a long list of actors in the 
Nigerian trade union arena was set to strike on Thursday.  He 
included NUPENG and PENGASSAN, but conversations late on 
October 6 with Peter Akpatason, President of NUPENG, and 
Ogbeifun Louis Brown, National President of PENGASSAN, 
suggest that the petroleum unions are not fully committed to 
a strike.  Akpatason identified NUPENG\'s attitude as \"middle 
of the road\" and open to a two- or three-month discussion 
with the GON on \"modalities of deregulation,\" which NUPENG 
supports in principle.  When asked if the NLC and other 
groups would strike without NUPENG, Akpatason said, \"labor 
can\'t argue with us; it\'s our industry.  A few (unions and 
groups) will not be happy, but we think we can bring them 
around to our position.\"  Brown spoke in a distressed tone 
about wanting to \"help the government and Nigerian people\" by 
finding scenarios to address the issue of fuel price.  Brown 
wants a six-month \"emergency structure\" to assess the 
downstream sector and repair the Port Harcourt and Warri 
refineries. 
 
 
BURNING TIRES AND VIOLENCE AGAIN? 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
5. (SBU Ubani does not believe that the demonstrations will 
be violent.  He said local thugs or \"area boys\" would not be 
a factor in the demonstrations, mostly because \"area boys are 
only able to take over when there\'s no leadership.  Once you 
have action called by a known platform with visible leaders, 
area boys have no position to unleash violence.  The only 
violence will be from police if they react poorly.\"  Ubani 
also doubts that demonstrators will attack vehicles, not 
because they won\'t want to, but because there won\'t be many 
cars out there. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The CLO and other civil society groups 
appear committed to the strike, but they seem more upset by 
the manner in which the decision to deregulate was taken than 
with deregulation as an economic policy.  Ubani characterized 
deregulation as an \"unlawful action of the President in 
collusion with gas marketers\" and called for the GON to reset 
the fuel price at 34 naira per liter.  This, of course, is 
unlikely.  Demonstrations will probably take place with or 
without PENGASSAN or NUPENG, but their legitimacy and 
strength may be undercut by the petroleum unions\' absence. 
End comment.

1. (U) Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President Adams 
Oshiomhole announced October 8 at approximately 2300 that 
labor had suspended its planned October 9 strike after the 
NLC, governors, National Assembly legislators, and oil 
marketers reached an agreement.  A hastily organized group, 
known as the Stakeholders Committee on Petroleum, decided 
temporarily to sell fuel at the pre-October 1 price of 34 
naira per liter while they deliberate a long-term strategy to 
deregulate the downstream sector.  The governors said they 
would monitor gas stations in their respective states to 
ensure prices remain at 34 naira until the committee reaches 
an agreement on deregulation.  John Odah, NLC General 
Secretary, told LabOff this morning that an All Stakeholders 
 
SIPDIS 
Summit will be held sometime this month to address supply, 
distribution and pricing of petroleum products. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to the VP of a major downstream company 
who was at the meeting in Abuja the night of October 8, 
however, the labor version (above) is incomplete.  Diesel and 
kerosene, he said, are deregulated effective immediately. 
The NNPC and private marketers will keep gasoline in the 
pipeline; some belated third quarter deliveries are expected 
to straggle in during the coming weeks, and marketers will 
likely begin to import shortly after the next stakeholders\' 
meeting next Thursday, October 16.  Gasoline at the pump will 
stay at 34 naira while NNPC stocks last (this is of course 
somewhat of a fiction, as prices outside a few big cities 
have always been higher).  NNPC contracts for Q4 delivery and 
forward months will begin contracting sharply while that of 
the commercial firms will expand correspondingly.  When the 
first private marketers\' deliveries reach Apapa Port in Lagos 
(probably in late October), the pump price at all petrol 
stations is to correspond to market costs. 
 
 
3.   (C)  Two oil company executives who attended the meeting 
do not expect the Stakeholders\' Committee to have any 
significant impact; for one thing, it is too unwieldy.  All 
36 governors are on it, and they all need to speak.  Next 
Thursday\'s meeting will be little more than a \"photo op\", we 
are told, and the executives believe the national senators 
assigned to the committee will stop attending meetings 
thereafter.  The committee\'s primary purpose is to provide 
cover for a face-saving arrangement for the unions, and that 
has already been accomplished. 
 
 
The President Strikes Back 
-------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (U) President Obasanjo addressed the nation two hours 
before the agreement was reached to argue strongly for the 
benefits of deregulation for the Nigerian consumer and 
economy and to launch a vicious attack on the NLC.  Failure 
to deregulate, he said, is costing everyone time and money, 
and it is unwise to invest more money in the rehabilitation 
of the refineries at Kaduna and Port Harcourt before they are 
privatized.  18 firms presently hold licenses to build 
refineries, he said, but none will take the risk of entering 
the industry due to the price controls that have hampered the 
downstream sector.  He said fuel marketers have been assured 
that the downstream infrastructure (e.g. at Apapa port in 
Lagos) will be improved to remove bottlenecks so Nigeria can 
get as much fuel as it needs.   The NLC knows well the 
benefits of deregulation, Obasanjo went on to say, and has 
endorsed the concept.  The President then launched into an 
extended, scathing attack on the NLC.  He claimed that it has 
become an opposition movement instead of a labor 
organization; contrary to the legislation establishing it the 
NLC wants to attain power through non-democratic means, and 
it is trying to become a parallel government.  Obasanjo also 
accused the NLC of providing cash to hoodlums, threating the 
police and unions such as the air traffic controllers who do 
not want to strike, and is acting out of \"unpatriotic and 
sinister motives.\"  Obasanjo called the planned strike 
\"illegal\" as 15 days prior notice had not been given (note: 
we are unfamiliar with such a requirement).  He referred 
repeatedly to the 8th All Africa Games underway in Abuja, 
saying Nigerians should not shame themselves as hosts in 
front of their brother Africans.  He closed his extraordinary 
attack with a warning against any attempts to obstruct 
traffic or force the closure of shops or banks.  He then 
appealed for calm, adding \"this is an appeal, but also a 
warning.\" 
 
 
5.  (C) Comment:  This agreement averts the immediate threat 
of a nationwide strike, and gives all sides a win.  For the 
first time, the unions, the oil companies and the government 
are all publicly in agreement in favor of deregulation of 
petroleum products. Labor and civil society are still fuming 
over Obasanjo\'s autocratic handling of the issue, but their 
leaders are happy to have won a seat at the table.  They 
will, in other words, give Obasanjo what he wanted (and what 
many of them wanted also), but will appear on television 
while doing so.  It is interesting to speculate on the role 
Obasanjo\'s attack on the NLC played in obtaining this 
agreement.  Union leaders speaking to outsiders dismiss the 
impact of his statement, but it was a naked threat.  Large 
sections of his address can only be understood as the text of 
an implicit threat that he could ban the NLC; he laid out an 
entire justification for doing so.

Classified By: POL/ECON FDAY for reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (C) Private marketers are planning to import fuel in the 
coming weeks for retail sales in Nigeria.  Managers at both 
Texaco and Mobil report that making joint purchases of large 
cargoes to reduce unit cost is preferable to smaller 
deliveries.  A Texaco official indicated his company would be 
most comfortable buying with Mobil and Total, but those 
details are still under consideration, and each of the six 
major marketers is capable and willing to import cargo on its 
own (ref A). 
 
 
2. (C) A Mobil downstream manager told Econoff on October 10 
that Unipetrol has two cargoes already in port.  It appears 
Unipetrol relied on earlier promises by President Obasanjo\'s 
Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Authority (PPPRA) that 
the downstream sector would be deregulated in October (ref 
B).  It purchased cargo and held to the delivery schedule 
even as the strike was impending.  It is unclear at what 
price Unipetrol will sell this cargo, but the Mobil 
representative signaled his company\'s intentions by saying to 
Econoff \"it is our position that the maximum pump price has 
been lifted.\" 
 
 
3. (C) The Mobil official discounted reports that the 
industry agreed to keep fuel prices at 34 naira in the short 
term (reftels).  Referring to press reports outlining the 
agreement, he said there apparently is \"some question as to 
who agreed to what\"  late Wednesday night.  He stressed that 
as far as his company is concerned, the downstream sector has 
been deregulated pursuant to PPPRA directives and President 
Obasanjo\'s comments, including Wednesday night\'s speech. 
Offering proof of this interpretation, the company manager 
told Econoff that prices in Port Harcourt and Calabar are 
above 34 naira today, and opined that it is only in the 
likely \"demonstration zones\" of Lagos and possibly Abuja that 
gasoline prices remain at 34 naira. (Note: many stations in 
Lagos are closed; apparently their owners are waiting to see 
how the pricing situation will be resolved.) 
 
 
4. (C) Texaco managers were more conciliatory about the 
agreement in conversations with Econoff October 9, saying 
that the Stakeholders Committee agreed that prices would stay 
at 34 naira until private marketers\' fuel arrived. 
 
 
5. (C) We have been checking periodically with NGO\'s and the 
presidents of NUPENG and PENGASSAN.  The tension of impeding 
strikes has lifted, and our contacts seem in good humor about 
the state of affairs, but do not all realize how quickly the 
Abuja agreement may be tested by the arrival in the market of 
commercially imported, market price fuel.  PENGASSAN thought 
it would take at least a month for shipments to arrive, by 
which time the Stakeholders\' Committee would have a 
deregulation plan all wrapped up.  NUPENG thought commercial 
imports could be here in two weeks, a more realistic 
assessment, but NUPENG also believed that two weeks is enough 
time to sort out deregulation.  None of these contacts seems 
aware of the two Unipetrol ships in harbor, but two cargoes 
(not even two days of normal supply) will not, in our 
opinion, cause waves.  NUPENG\'s President Akpatason remarked 
to us that many petrol stations have not rolled their prices 
back to 34 naira as they were supposed to.   He did not seem 
quite ready to climb back on his warhorse over it; when asked 
what might be done about it, he seemed to think it would be 
rather difficult to identify the offending owners to berate 
them.

BANKING SECTOR 
 
REF: (A) STATE 287449, (B) MORIARTY-FULLER EMAIL OF 
08222003/0737, (C) MURRELL-KRZYWDA EMAIL OF 
08252003/0228 
 
 
1. (U) Rumors of distress in the Nigerian banking 
sector have raised doubts about the industry\'s health 
and prompted questions about certain banks\' stability. 
Post\'s response follows. 
 
 
2. (U) Rumors of a list of distressed banks first 
surfaced in mid-August.  Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) 
and Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) 
contacts deny the existence of an explicit list of 
troubled banks but inicate that ten or twelve may be 
facing temporaryliquidity problems; these may undergo 
special CBNor NDIC examinations.  Extremely unhealthy 
bankscould eventually be liquidated, but troubled 
insittions ill more likely be asked to restructure, 
re-capitalize or improve corporate governance 
ractices.  Flagrant violations of CBN regulations 
could result in fine 
or sanctions, but most of thse 
can eventually be overcome. 
 
 
3. (SBU) The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) suspended 
two banks, Societe Generale Bank of Nigeria and African 
International Bank, from its clearinghouse in mid- 
August for consistently overdrawing their CBN accounts. 
Both banks had long been suspected of having serious 
capitalization or liquidity problems, and both are now 
attempting to re-capitalize and re-enter the 
clearinghouse.  Societe Generale\'s troubles gained 
notoriety when the Nigerian press reported that a 
number of prominent figures (national lawmakers among 
them) had rather large accounts at the bank.  Industry 
insiders not only confirm these reports but whisper of 
additional irregularities.  A senior official of the 
Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System told us, in fact, 
that one of Societe Generale\'s directors, Dr. Sola 
Saraki of Kwara State, secured large loans for his 
son\'s (ultimately successful) gubernatorial campaign 
without providing repayment.  He argues that the bank\'s 
failure to recover these and other loans played a major 
role in weakening its books, but with fresh injections 
of funds (more than $15 million landed in the bank\'s 
accounts a few days ago), the bank may eventually 
recover. 
 
 
4. (U) The Bank of the North has equally poor loan 
recovery rates, but its problems have not been severe 
enough to warrant suspension from the industry\'s 
clearinghouse.  The CBN replaced the bank\'s board of 
governors in mid-August (the new board is charged with 
restructuring and re-capitalizing the bank), and the 19 
northern states that own the bank have since committed 
to fresh injections of funds.  CBN contacts indicate 
that future loans to northern state governments will be 
severely limited; if this is true, the bank\'s liquidity 
profile will likely improve.  Given the bank\'s 
ownership structure and the political ramifications of 
failure, the bank will likely remain operational. 
 
 
5. (U) CBN and NDIC contacts indicate that Reliance 
Bank and Platinum Bank are generally healthy, but the 
banks\' published accounts are more than a year old. 
The CBN completed its examination of Reliance Bank in 
late September but has yet to prepare a final report. 
While the deputy director of the CBN\'s bank examination 
department in Lagos said he knew of no specific 
irregularities or negative practices, he did mention 
that three of the bank\'s owners, the Vaswani brothers, 
had been deported after allegations of widespread 
economic and financial crimes; their misdeeds may or 
may not indicate gaps in the bank\'s corporate 
governance practices.  The NDIC, meanwhile, has yet to 
begin its examination of Platinum Bank.  According to 
NDIC contacts, Platinum emerged three years ago from 
the liquidation of Nationwide Merchant Bank, one of 
nearly thirty institutions liquidated by the CBN in the 
late 1990s.  A well and favorably known professor at 
the Lagos Business School, Pat Utomi, is one of 
Platinum Bank\'s directors (and chairman of Business 
Day, Nigeria\'s leading daily business newspaper). 
 
 
6. (SBU) Two other banks, NAL Merchant Bank and 
Cooperative Development Bank, also appear relatively 
healthy.  CBN contacts indicate that the banks are 
sound, but the deputy managing director of Financial 
Derivatives Company Limited, a Lagos-based economic 
think tank, suggested that he would be reluctant to 
enter into anything other than short- to medium-term 
transactions with either bank. 
 
 
7. (U) In general, the CBN\'s supervisory oversight 
appears sufficient.  The institution\'s regular 
examinations of Nigerian banks have resulted in the 
closure or liquidation of 35 banks since 1994 and the 
mid-2002 sanctioning of approximately twenty others for 
foreign exchange violations; these have largely stopped 
since then, and respect for the CBN has increased.  The 
institution supports Nigerian banks\' links with foreign 
counterparts and generally does all it can to ensure a 
stable financial system.  The CBN has largely been 
successful: in general, the Nigerian banking sector is 
healthy, and industry insiders insist that the sector 
is set for continued growth.

SUBJECT: NIGERIAN BANKS: LARGELY HEALTHY BUT HARDLY 
CONSUMER-ORIENTED 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Rumors of distress have whispered 
through Nigeria\'s financial sector since mid-August, 
fueled in part by the suspension of two banks from the 
industry\'s clearinghouse and in part by investigations 
of ten or twelve others said to be facing temporary 
liquidity problems.  Some banks may indeed be troubled, 
but these represent only a small proportion of total 
deposits; as such, rumors of widespread distress are 
exaggerated.  The country\'s largest banks are healthy, 
and industry insiders insist that the sector is set for 
continued growth.  This may be the case, but growth 
will likely be limited unless Nigerian banks begin to 
meet the needs of consumers and small and medium 
enterprises.  End summary. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
TROUBLED BANKS OUT IN THE OPEN 
------------------------------ 
 
 
2. (U) The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) suspended two 
banks, Societe Generale Bank of Nigeria and African 
International Bank, from its clearinghouse in mid- 
August for consistently overdrawing their CBN accounts. 
Both had long been suspected of having serious 
capitalization or liquidity problems, and both are 
attempting to re-capitalize and re-enter the 
clearinghouse.  Another troubled institution, the Bank 
of the North, has similar problems, but these have not 
been severe enough to warrant suspension from the 
industry\'s clearinghouse.  The CBN replaced the bank\'s 
board of governors in mid-August (the new board is 
charged with restructuring and re-capitalizing the 
bank), and the 19 northern states that own the bank 
have since committed to fresh injections of funds. 
Given its unique ownership structure and the political 
ramifications of failure, the bank will likely remain 
operational. 
 
 
------------------------ 
OF LISTS AND LIABILITIES 
------------------------ 
 
 
3. (U) Ten or twelve other banks are reportedly facing 
temporary liquidity problems.  Speculation regarding 
the nature of a so-called \"list\" of distressed banks is 
rife and made worse by the CBN\'s reluctance to publicly 
identify any banks under investigation.  The CBN\'s 
refusal to name names casts a pall of suspicion over 
the entire industry and frustrates banks and consumers 
alike: the former find their credibility questioned by 
foreign partners and investors, and the latter worry 
about doing business with banks that could be on the 
verge of failing.  Even so, consumers continue to make 
deposits, and a large-scale run on Nigerian banks is 
unlikely. 
 
 
4. (U) If banks are indeed having liquidity problems, 
the CBN may ask them to restructure, re-capitalize or 
improve corporate governance practices.  Banks with 
severe problems could eventually be closed, but this 
would not be unprecedented: since 1994, the CBN has 
closed or liquidated 35 banks.  Industry insiders point 
out that the elimination of unhealthy banks is, on the 
whole, a good thing and note that the failure of a few 
small banks is unlikely to generate widespread 
distress, particularly when the banks\' deposits account 
for only a small proportion of the industry\'s total. 
Bismarck Rewane, Managing Director of Financial 
Derivates Company Limited, a leading Lagos-based 
economic think tank, points out that Nigeria\'s top 
twenty banks account for approximately 60 percent of 
the sector\'s total assets; the failure of a few small 
banks is therefore unlikely to have a significant 
impact on the industry as a whole. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
CONTINUED GROWTH... IF CUSTOMERS\' NEEDS ARE MET 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
5. (U) Many analysts argue, in fact, that Nigeria\'s 
banking sector has too many banks: ninety-odd banks 
crowd the field, but twenty or thirty might be 
sufficient, particularly when only forty or so conduct 
significant operations in the inter-bank market. 
Rewane believes that the sector will undergo rapid 
consolidation in the near future, predicting that only 
thirty banks will survive the next two years; he 
expects another ten to disappear shortly thereafter. 
The Managing Director of the Nigeria Inter-Bank 
Settlement System, Paul Lawal, shares Rewane\'s 
expectations but believes that consolidation will occur 
more slowly: he expects to see 65 banks two years from 
now.  Lawal reports that the management of several 
smaller banks may be turned over to larger 
institutions, but even with consolidation, he expects 
the banking sector\'s overall capitalization to remain 
the same. 
 
 
6. (U) Consolidation may be driven in part by banks\' 
competition (perhaps with some foreign participation) 
to enter potentially lucrative retail and consumer 
markets.  Retail expansion would be welcome, as banks 
cater almost exclusively to state and local 
governments, oil companies, and large, established 
clients.  Ado Wanka, Executive Director of Corporate 
and Investment Banking at First Bank, Nigeria\'s largest 
and oldest bank, reports that nearly 70 percent of the 
bank\'s income is derived from interest on corporate 
loans; like its competitors, First Bank concentrates on 
securing large corporate clients.  According to Wanka, 
extending credit to the \"common man\" is simply not 
profitable enough to make it worthwhile - and in 
Nigeria\'s uncertain investment climate, high risks of 
default make loans to individuals, entrepreneurs and 
small businesses especially unattractive.  As it is, 
interest rates are so high (at de facto rates of 29 to 
30 percent) that none but the largest and most credible 
clients can afford loans.  Average Nigerians find even 
revolving credit largely inaccessible: the inordinately 
high risk of fraud makes credit card use unwise, and 
revolving credit is not widely offered by banks. 
 
 
7. (U) Small and medium enterprises find it equally 
difficult to obtain credit.  The CBN requires Nigerian 
banks to set aside ten percent of before-tax profits 
for equity investments in industrial enterprises under 
its Small and Medium Industries Equity Investment 
Scheme, but only a small proportion of available funds 
has been distributed.  Banks are often reluctant to 
loan money to businesses with short track records, and 
many claim that entrepreneurs lack \"discipline,\" or the 
ability to ensure that funds are used exclusively for 
investment purposes.  The deputy director of the 
Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation\'s bank 
examination department argues, in fact, that funds 
loaned to small and medium enterprises often end up in 
the personal bank accounts of their owners.  Added to 
these constraints is many entrepreneurs\' wariness of 
equity financing.  Lawal notes that many businessmen 
are reluctant to share control of their enterprises and 
adds that they fear an eventual take-over by equity 
investors. 
 
 
8. (U) Comment: Economic observers generally consider 
the financial sector one of the Nigerian economy\'s 
bright spots.  Banks have enjoyed sustained growth over 
the last few years, and the trend looks set to 
continue, assuming, of course, that consumers ignore 
rumors of distress and continue to make deposits. 
Unfortunately, with so few people having access to 
credit, banks are failing to fulfill one of their 
primary functions: making sure that money goes to those 
who need it.  In many cases, banks simply accept 
government deposits and use them to purchase treasury 
bills or extend loans to federal, state and local 
governments and their parastatals.  As such, banks make 
money but contribute little to productive economic 
activity.  Until this changes, interest rates come down 
and Nigeria\'s investment climate improves, economic 
growth will likely remain less than buoyant.  End 
comment.

 1. (C) Summary: The status of fuel supply and pricing in 
Nigeria remains in question as fuel marketers and labor 
leaders left a stakeholders\' meeting on October 16 with 
little agreement but significant distrust and resentment. 
Labor promises mass action at retail stations if marketers do 
not sell gasoline at the price of 34 naira per liter.  Mobil 
fears it will be targeted for action, possibly including 
violence.  A technical committee will meet in early November 
to discuss the mechanics of deregulation, but its likely 
effect is questionable, and hard decisions regarding supply 
and price must be made in the interim, leaving a volatile 
situation in place. End Summary. 
 
 
--------------------- 
DISAGREEING TO AGREE? 
--------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) A nationwide strike was averted in Nigeria late on 
October 8 when labor, fuel marketers, governors and national 
legislators agreed to form a Petroleum Stakeholders Committee 
(PSC) to discuss the deregulation of the downstream sector, 
which President Obasanjo imposed abruptly the week before 
(reftels).  The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) publicly 
described the agreement as also keeping fuel prices at 34 
naira per liter, at least in the short-term (this was the 
government-imposed ceiling until the president\'s action of 
October 1). 
 
 
3. (C) Confusion and hostility was seen throughout the 
country this last week as fuel stations charged varying 
prices for fuel (ref B), or failed to open altogether because 
managers did not know at what price to sell or feared union 
action.  Adding to the confusion was the arrival of a 
shipment of fuel imported by private marketers (ref A). 
 
 
4. (S/NF) The inaugural meeting of the PSC was held in Abuja 
on October 16.  A communique issued after the meeting by the 
Governors\' Forum states that the Committee agreed to form a 
technical committee to \"harmonize\" positions, that it found 
the marketers had failed to abide by last week\'s agreement, 
and that they should revert to a 34 naira per liter gas price 
\"in the interest of peace.\"  Nonetheless, Anthony Jones, the 
American Country Director of the AFL-CIO\'s Solidarity Center 
in Nigeria (strictly protect), told Labor Officer that the 
NLC feels the governors are backing away from their earlier 
support of labor\'s position that prices should remain at 34 
naira for the short-term.  In a lengthy conversation with 
Econoff within hours of the meeting, John Pototsky, Managing 
Director of Mobil (strictly protect), characterized the 
meeting as acrimonious and divisive, and the formation of a 
technical committee as a sham to waste more time without 
implementation of deregulation. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
LABOR RESORTS TO INTIMIDATION 
----------------------------- 
 
 
5. (S/NF)  Pototsky, clearly distressed and angered by the 
day\'s events, told Econoff that during the meeting, the NLC 
issued threats that Mobil stations will be burned down if the 
company does not revert to 34 naira per liter for gas prices. 
 He said he asked why his company was being singled out for 
such action, and was told it was because some Mobil stations 
sold fuel above 34 naira during the last week, and others 
were most noticeably closed last weekend, after the 
strike-averting agreement was to take effect.  Pototsky said 
he explained to the Committee his dealers closed last weekend 
and early this week for two reasons: 1) NLC road transport 
workers blockaded a Mobil tanker truck parking lot, 
preventing drivers from re-supplying stations running empty 
in the crush of consumers who were panic-buying, and 2) many 
station managers found NLC members taking over their gas 
pumps, ostensibly to ensure that fuel was sold at 34 naira 
but with no control, and at some stations union members were 
attempting to remove fuel directly from underground storage 
tanks.  Pototsky told Econoff he portrayed the situation to 
the Committee as a security and supply problem, forcing his 
stations to close hurriedly.  Pototsky said that when he 
offered this explanation to the Committee, NLC leader Adams 
Oshiomhole left the room to consult with other union leaders, 
only to return saying \"the MD of Mobil is lying.  Such events 
did not take place.\" 
 
 
6. (S/NF) Pototsky stressed to Econoff his belief that Mobil 
stations will be targeted for union action in the coming 
days, and that he does not discount the use of vandalism or 
violence.  Union officials told Consulate staff that a 
directive has gone to all state councils urging mass action 
and disruption of sales of gasoline at stations selling above 
34 naira per liter, beginning Monday, October 20.  The leader 
of the activist group United Action for Democracy (UAD), an 
umbrella organization for many NGOs that led the fight 
against Abacha, told Poloff that his members will support any 
NLC call to mass action.  Newspapers report the unions are 
enlisting the aid of the Oddua People\'s Congress (OPC), a 
militant Yoruba faction in Southwest Nigeria, to help enforce 
a 34 naira pump price.  Pototsky said his belief that his 
stations are at great risk in the coming days will force him 
to decide whether he \"caves in\" and officially sells gasoline 
at 34 naira, or \"holds out\" on his belief that the Petroleum 
Products Pricing Regulatory Authority (PPPRA) deregulated the 
downstream market as of October 1, letting him sell at market 
prices.  Pototsky said he expected a conversation with the 
head of PPPRA on October 17, during which he would seek 
assurances that the PPPRA and presidency support the 
marketers\' view that deregulation has occurred, and market 
price prevails.  If he does not get such assurances, he will 
most likely instruct his dealers to sell gasoline at 34 naira 
per liter.  If he gets sufficient indication that the 
administration will support marketers, he will beef up 
security at his stations and sell at market price, somewhere 
around 39 to 40 naira per liter. 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
TANK FARMS FULL, GAS STATIONS EMPTY 
----------------------------------- 
 
 
7. (S/NF) Other marketers will face the same decision as 
Pototsky in the coming days.  Fuel cargo imported by the 
private marketers under a Unipetrol contract arrived in Lagos 
last weekend (ref A), and another was expected on October 16 
or 17.  News reports peg the landed price of this fuel at 33 
naira per liter.  On October 6, Texaco executives told 
Consulate officers that the company\'s \"break even price\" was 
near 45 naira per liter. Pototsky told Econoff on October 16 
he could profitably sell at a price six to seven naira above 
landed cost, which would include transportation costs and 
\"bridging fees\" (because of poor pipelines, the GON must 
truck fuel from the port of Lagos to depots nationwide to 
ensure fuel supply outside of the Lagos environs -- this 
process remains no guarantee as cities in the North and East 
are often without fuel).  Demurrage fees (those charged by 
the owners of ships for each day a cargo vessel remains in 
port to offload) add a significant variable to fuel costs in 
Nigeria because of the state of disrepair of the Lagos port 
fuel terminal. 
 
 
8. (S/NF) Pototsky told Econoff that an industry 
representative asked the NLC what the marketers are to do 
with the fuel they imported last week, which cannot be sold 
profitably at 34 naira (while last week\'s shipment was 
eventually disclosed in the press, it is unclear if, at the 
time of the stakeholders meeting, the NLC was aware of the 
shipment expected to reach port October 16/17).  He said the 
NLC replied they should leave it in their tanks until the 
stakeholders Technical Committee reaches an agreement on 
higher pump prices.  Pototsky said marketers may do just that 
for at least one or two weeks, but to do so would require all 
retailers to rely solely on fuel supplies from the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), presumably at 
subsidized rates, and he is not certain how long NNPC can 
continue to provide fuel in sufficient quantities to meet 
anything near demand levels (ref C).  Pototsky indicated he 
is not ready to begin further shipments anytime soon. 
 
 
9. (S/NF) Comment.  Both fuel supply and price will remain 
uncertain in the coming weeks.  The decision by Mobil whether 
to sell at market price or revert to the former government 
imposed ceiling will likely set the trend for all other 
marketers.  The uncertainty of this situation will linger as 
long as labor acts brashly to save face, and the government 
fails to intercede on behalf of the marketers in line with 
the deregulation plan marketers insist the administration 
promised would take immediate effect.  End Comment.

included addressing issues of diversity inclusion, an 
important theme as Nigeria struggles to establish a 
pluralist Democracy. 
 
 
3. Guests of honor, numbering over 200 in total, were 
represented by the international diplomatic community, 
the local and national Nigerian political 
establishment, Lagos-area business leaders, 
academicians, local artists, US citizens and mission 
employees. 
 
 
4. The keynote speaker for the event, the Honorable 
Michael Olayemi Cardoso, Commissioner for Economic 
Planning and Budget, Lagos State, highlighted the Lagos- 
Hispanic connection by citing the historical nexus 
between both in the Lagos-area.  Mr. Cardoso also 
announced the partnership between Lagos and the city of 
Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, an initiative that will 
provide an important building block for Nigerian 
outreach and business development in South America. 
 
 
5.  Key U.S.-Nigerian Mission Performance Plan

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: FROM THE ASHES OF NIGERIA AIRWAYS 
 
REF: (A) LAGOS 1690, (B) LAGOS 1768 
 
 
1. (U) The liquidation of Nigeria\'s ailing national 
carrier, Nigeria Airways Limited, may at last be moving 
forward.  According to Bismarck Rewane, Managing 
Director of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, a 
leading Lagos-based economic think tank, the Ministry 
of Justice has begun making preparations to liquidate 
the airline.  While Nigeria Airways may survive as a 
legal entity for years, the Ministry has declared its 
intent to sell the carrier\'s assets and settle its 
debts. 
 
 
2. (U) Rewane tells us a new national carrier will take 
Nigeria Airways\' place.  He expects an established 
international airline to hold 30 percent of the new 
carrier, with core investors holding 20 percent and 
individual shareholders picking up the remaining 50 
percent through an initial public offering.  As the 
largest single shareholder, the international carrier 
would control the airline\'s management. 
 
 
3. (U) With other members of the technical committee 
advising the Ministry of Aviation on the creation of a 
new airline, Rewane recommended that the carrier 
restrict its operations (both passenger and cargo) to 
West Africa and join an international alliance to take 
advantage of the routes allocated to Nigeria Airways 
under the GON\'s existing bilateral air services 
agreements.  Rewane tells us, however, that despite the 
committee\'s recommendations, the new airline may 
operate point-to-point services to Dubai, Saudi Arabia, 
London, Johannesburg and New York. 
 
 
4. (U) Comment: If the GON implements the committee\'s 
recommendations - and if reliable international 
carriers, core investors and individuals express 
interest in holding shares in the new airline - then 
the new carrier stands a good chance of getting off the 
ground.  Of three names under discussion, Nigerian 
Eagle Airlines is most popular.  Given the airline\'s 
emergence from the ashes of its predecessor, however, 
Nigerian Phoenix Airlines might be more appropriate. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: STATUS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY REGULATIONS 
 
REF: STATE 263456 
 
 
1. (U) Nigeria has no specific law governing the 
approval, production, importation, and labeling of 
products of agricultural biotechnology.  Nigeria\'s 
Draft Biosafety Guidelines state proposed procedures to 
follow to import or test GMO in the country. 
 
 
2. (U) In February 2002 the Nigerian Federal Executive 
Council, comprising the president and the federal 
government ministers, approved the Draft Biosafety 
Guidelines.  They have yet to be submitted to the 
National Assembly for enactment.  We have learned that 
the guidelines portray biotech products as generally 
safe for animal and human consumption.  The guidelines 
reportedly also require mandatory labeling of all 
biotech food products to protect \"consumers\' right to 
know\". 
 
 
3. (U) Comment: Nigeria\'s Director General (DG) of the 
National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and 
Control (NAFDAC) recently told the AgAttache that 
\"after attending a biotech conference in Europe, she 
agrees with a mandatory labeling for biotech food 
products\".  NAFDAC has a representative on the National 
Biosafety Committee.  AgAttache countered with a brief 
explanation of the U.S. position on biotechnology and 
gave the DG a recent article highlighting its positive 
attributes.  It is not clear to us if she will 
reconsider her position. (NAFDAC is the GON\'s 
regulatory agency for the registration, advertisement, 
and internal distribution of food imports.) 
 
 
4. (U) We were also told that the Federal Ministry of 
Environment may become the regulatory agency for 
biosafety guidelines, if approved.  (Comment: We 
understand the Ministry is not enthusiastic about 
biotechnology.  We would thus be rather surprised were 
it to become its regulator; moreover, various 
parliamentary and executive government committees, as 
well as private sector entities, have diverging 
interests in the matter.  The GON\'s intergovernmental 
and interagency mechanism for handling biotech issues, 
the National Biosafety Committee, has 18 members, for 
example.  We therefore think NAFDAC will ultimately be 
empowered to regulate the biotech trade.  End comment.)

REF: LAGOS 1937 ET SEQ 
 
 
Classified By: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL JOSEPH P. GREGOIRE FOR REASON 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
 
The wheels of Justice grind slowly.... 
 
 
1. (U)  Although most Nigerian and foreign election observers 
acknowledged that the Spring 2003 gubernatorial, National 
Assembly and Presidential elections were rife with fraud, all 
agreed and all urged disgruntled losing candidates and 
political parties to pursue their claims and complaints in 
the constitutionally-established Elections Tribunals.  Since 
the day after the elections ended, Tribunals have been 
hearing challenges to elections -- including the Presidential 
elections -- in several southern States and other States in 
the north. There is no end of the judicial proceedings in 
sight, and these cases may well linger until the next 
elections in 2007. 
 
 
2. (U) Ekiti - The losing Alliance for Democracy Party (AD) 
has charged fraud in the election of the winner of the 
governorship in this, the newest and smallest Nigerian State. 
 AD charges that Governor Ayo Fayose of the Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) won with a forged official election 
victory certificate.  This past June, the tribunal had thrown 
out the AD suit on technical grounds, deciding that the AD 
gubernatorial challenger and his running mate, Niyi Adebayo 
and Paul Alabi, respectively, had not been properly joined as 
complainants in the suit.  Last week the Court of Appeal 
overturned the Tribunal\'s decision, again on a technicality, 
and restarted the judicial wrangling. 
 
 
3. (U) Anambra - In addition to the turmoil caused by the 
July attempted coup involving kidnapping of the newly elected 
governor at the direction of his political \"godfather\", 
Anambra State is also embroiled in a dispute in the Tribunal 
challenging the validity of the gubernatorial election 
itself.  The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has 
charged that PDP Governor Chris Ngige has stolen \"the mandate 
of the people of Anambra.\"  Months after the elections and 
the swearing in of officials, officers of the Independent 
National Election Commission (INEC) are now coming forward to 
testify in court that they never signed nor certified 
documents declaring Ngige the winner. 
 
 
4. (U) Enugu - The Tribunal in Enugu has flip-flopped so many 
times in its decision on the APGA\'s challenge to the election 
of PDP Governor Chimaroke Nnamani that the President of the 
Court of Appeal in the capital, Abuja, has started action to 
try to move the legal proceedings there.  The suggested move 
has been challenged as unconstitutional since the Nigerian 
Constitution requires that the Tribunals be \"established in 
each State of the Federation\" and \"have due regard to the 
proximity to and accessibility from the place where the 
election was held.\"  A decision is expected next week. 
 
 
5. (U) Akwa-Ibom - Dr. Ime Umanah\'s (All Nigeria Peoples 
Party - ANPP) challenge to the election of PDP Governor 
Victor Attah is apparently in legal limbo.  Umanah had 
charged that Attah was not eligible to run for governor since 
he had allegedly accepted an illegal contribution.  The 
tribunal dismissed the challenge on the grounds of 
insufficient showing of misconduct.  The case is on appeal 
and the National Judicial Council has entered the proceedings 
to investigate charges of possible misconduct by the Tribunal 
judges. 
 
 
6. (U) Bayelsa - The PDP has lost a challenge to one of the 
few National Assembly seats won by APGA.  Citing a procedural 
error, the Tribunal had decided in favor of the PDP.  The 
Court of Appeal, however, reversed the lower court\'s decision 
saying that the court could have exercised its discretion 
\"and overlooked what was obviously a minor non-compliance.\" 
The PDP has re-filed its suit in the Tribunal. 
 
 
\"Defending\" human rights? 
 
 
7.  (C) Prominent attorney and co-founder of the Committee 
for the Defense of Human Rights (CDHR), Femi Falana, along 
with another CDHR former official, Beko Kuti, are alleged to 
have recruited a gang of thugs (\"area boys\") to dislodge 
current CDHR officials and workers from the group\'s 
headquarters in Lagos.  The area boys are reported to have 
forced entry into the CDHR offices, destroyed equipment and 
furniture and severely beaten staff.  Police who were called 
to the scene reportedly did nothing to stop the attack, 
supposedly because they had been bought off by Falana and 
Kuti.  Local media have reported that Falana and Kuti refuse 
to accept that they were not re-elected to head the 
influential, nationwide organization and have decided to take 
back control by force.  (Comment.  Falana, like several other 
leaders of NGOs that led the fight against military rulers 
over the past decades, saw his influence waning as democracy 
struggled to take root and decided to turn to politics as a 
way to remain in the limelight.  In the last election, Falana 
ran and lost as the Presidential candidate of the National 
Conscience Party.  CDHR is in turmoil, but still functioning 
and has asked a group of prominent persons, including lawyer, 
activist and former Presidential candidate, Gani Fawehinmi, 
to look into the matter.  No charges of any kind have been 
filed against Falana or Kuti.)

1. (U) Further to Ref A, Nigeria\'s National Agency for 
Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) 
reports that the approval, importation and labeling of 
food products, including products of agricultural 
biotechnology, is governed by the Drug and Related 
Products Act (as amended) and related Food Products 
Registration Regulations and Prepackaged Food Products 
Regulations. 
 
 
2. (U) Among other things, the laws and regulations 
provide that no food products shall be imported, 
manufactured or distributed unless such food products 
have been registered by NAFDAC.  In addition, the 
Prepackaged Food Products Regulations state that no 
food products shall be sold or imported unless labels 
containing NAFDAC-stipulated information have been 
affixed.  The regulations also state that \"where the 
ingredients of a food item are known to cause 
hypersensitivity, such shall be declared on the label, 
especially those obtained through biotechnology\". 
 
 
3. (U) As things now stand, NAFDAC appears to be 
responsible not only for regulating the registration, 
advertisement and internal distribution of food 
imports, but also for regulating the biotech trade.

Classified By: JGREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
1. (C) Summary.  After more than a month of peace, clashes 
between ethnic groups in the Niger Delta appear on the rise, 
although less deadly than generally reported in the media. 
We have received reports of attacks and counter-attacks at 
multiple locations since Sunday, October 19. Chevron security 
personnel believe the Itsekiri are preparing to return en 
masse to their lands, by force if necessary, and the company 
is making new contingency plans in the event of a repeat of 
the widespread violence and displacement of villagers 
experienced in March 2003.  End Summary. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
CHEVRON READYING FOR ITSEKIRI RETURN HOME 
----------------------------------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Fresh fighting was reported in multiple locations of 
the Niger Delta during the week of October 20. On October 23, 
Dave Beddow, a security consultant from Control Risks Group 
working on-site at Chevron\'s Escravos terminal and tank farm, 
told Econoff that Chevron\'s security team is receiving an 
increasing number of reports of violent clashes along the 
waterways of the Delta, but is frustrated by a lack of 
corroboration and confirmation of deaths and injuries.  The 
security consultant said his team has intelligence that the 
Itsekiri are planning to return to their villages along the 
Escravos and Benin Rivers, and are attempting to align 
themselves with the Ilaje, an ethnic group occupying a narrow 
strip of coastal land North of the Escravos River toward the 
Delta/Ondo state line.  The Ilaje have not played a major 
role in the ethnic conflicts of 2003.  (Note: The Ilaje were 
reportedly attacked by Ijaw in the late 90s in a land grab. 
They are said to have quietly armed themselves thereafter, 
successfully repelling later attacks.  Subsequently, they 
mostly have been left out of the ethnic conflicts.)  Beddow 
also said he has information that the Itsekiri are reaching 
out to the militant Yoruba youth group the Oodua People\'s 
Congress (OPC), based mainly in Lagos.  The OPC are widely 
known as thugs and enforcers, hired by other groups and even 
politicians to provide protection and to pressure and 
intimidate political and financial enemies. (Note: Some 
Lagosians appreciate the \"protection\" the OPC provides some 
communities by enforcing curfews and checking identification 
of people wishing to enter neighborhoods under their 
wardship.) A similar allegation of Itsekiri collusion with 
the OPC surfaced in September; the Itsekiri share a historic 
bloodline to the Yoruba people (ref B). 
 
 
3. (C) In a conversation with Poloff on October 23, Daniel 
Reyenieju, of the Itsekiri National Youth Congress, did not 
confirm the specifics of this report, but did express 
frustration at the inability of the federal government to 
restore law and order in the riverine areas of the Delta. He 
showed equal frustration with the perceived ineptitude of the 
state government to address Itsekiri concerns in the region 
and accused Governor Ibori, an Urhobo with an Itsekiri 
mother, as siding with the Ijaw.  Reyenieju also made an 
appeal for NGOs and donors such as the USG to provide aid to 
the Itsekiri internally displaced persons (IDP) currently 
living mainly in Sapele.  He told Poloff, \"No one discusses 
resettlement or going back home,\" and added, \"We will go home 
peacefully, but if anyone accosts us, we will protect 
ourselves.\"  When asked if the Itsekiri are forming alliances 
with the Ilaje or OPC, he commented that the Ilaje are 
Yoruba, and have their own interest in protecting themselves 
against Ijaw incursions.  He dodged the question of OPC 
involvement in the region by saying, \"If Yoruba were involved 
in the Delta, the Ijaw would be nowhere.  But if the Yoruba 
decide to get involved, they will do it on their own.\" 
 
 
4. (C) Chevron\'s security consultant David Beddow told 
Econoff that, in light of the information that the Itsekiri 
are planning a return to their homes, as well as the 
increasing frequency of violence in recent weeks (ref A), 
Chevron\'s security team is standing-up a mini-IMT (Incident 
Management Team), to formulate contingency plans for likely 
scenarios.  According to Beddow, based on the events of March 
2003 and current intelligence, the IMT will devise response 
plans for three scenarios: 1) the Escravos terminal is 
subject to indirect fire as warring ethnic factions attack 
each other in the waterways and villages surrounding 
Escravos, 2) large numbers of villagers displaced by such 
fighting pour into the Escravos facility seeking refuge, and 
3) one or more of the ethnic factions engages the Government 
Security Forces (GSF) assigned to protect the Escravos 
facility, trying to draw them into battle on the militants\' 
home turf, namely, the waterways of the Delta.  The security 
consultant said the IMT would have new contingency plans for 
Escravos ready by Friday, October 24. 
---------------------------- 
FIERCE BOAT CHASE NEAR WARRI 
---------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) Tony Obuaya, Warri security manager for Shell, told 
Econoff that on Tuesday, October 23, two groups of young men 
in boats chased each other to a point near the Shell 
waterfront of Warri.  A group of five Ijaw took shelter at 
the Shell facilities, four of whom were injured, two 
seriously, according to Obuaya.  Obuaya said Shell personnel 
provided immediate medical treatment to all the injured 
before they left to seek longer-term care.  He noted that in 
interviews with the four who could speak, each gave different 
accounts of what had occurred, so much so that he cannot 
speculate as to the origins of the fight.  But, he is 
suspicious that they were involved in something illegal and 
were trying, ineffectively, to create cover stories. 
 
 
6. (C) Chevron\'s security consultant Beddow had previously 
told Econoff that government forces had \"bumped into\" a group 
attempting to steal a barge.  The security forces gave chase, 
Beddow said, shooting along the way.  Beddow said the 
would-be thieves then found their way to the Shell facility. 
Shell\'s Obuaya denied that account, stating that there was no 
barge involved, and contrary to one report given by an Ijaw 
leader to Poloff, Shell facilities themselves were not 
attacked. 
 
 
----------------------- 
IJAW AND ITSEKIRI CLASH 
----------------------- 
 
 
7. (C) Chevron\'s Beddow also told Econoff that in a separate 
incident, some Itsekiri attacked an Ijaw boating party, 
resulting in one death and perhaps one Ijaw taken captive. 
Beddow said a Nigerian Navy commander confirmed this report. 
Similarly, Joel Bisina, a moderate Ijaw and head of the 
multi-ethnic Niger Delta Professionals for Development, told 
Poloff that on Tuesday, October 21, a group of Ijaw on a boat 
headed to Warri was attacked by \"criminal elements\" involved 
in piracy.  According to Bisina, the attackers, whom he 
presumes were Itsekiri but also admitted he had no proof, 
took the boat and its passengers captive.  He said other Ijaw 
later attempted to free the boat and its passengers, but that 
the armed Ijaw began shooting at the unarmed pirates, 
resulting in several Ijaw getting shot by friendly fire. 
 
 
--------------------- 
IJAW AND URHOBO CLASH 
--------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) In his conversation with Poloff, Bisina also confirmed 
press reports of a violent confrontation between Ijaw and the 
Urhobo elements.  According to Bisina, on Sunday, October 19, 
a group of Urhobo villagers clashed with Ijaw on the waters 
between the villages of Okwagbe and Ayakuroama, which sit 
directly across from each other on opposite banks of a river. 
 Bisina noted that a few weeks ago, some Urhobos were robbed 
along the waterways, and the fighting of the 19th may have 
been retaliation for that event as well as the result of a 
gradual build-up of resentment the Urhobo feel toward the 
Ijaw, who the Urhobo accuse of blocking the waterways and 
stealing from Urhobo boat travelers.  Bisina estimated that 
15 persons from both villages may have been killed on the 
19th.  He noted that press reports far exaggerated the event 
and the casualties, opining that such yellow journalism only 
serves to raise the tension levels in the Delta.  (Note: 
Interestingly, both oil company security officials who spoke 
to Econoff denied any knowledge of this clash, even though 
they claim to have sources throughout the communities and 
offer details of other unconfirmed incidents.) 
 
 
9. (C) Comment.  Numerous conversations from different 
sources with Poloff reveal that feelings of despair and 
frustration are great within the Itsekiri community. 
Itsekiris continue to express disillusionment with federal 
and state government and believe that only they alone can 
protect themselves.  Their desire to return to their villages 
along the Benin and Escravos rivers is great, and they have 
stated their strong intentions to do so regardless of the 
violence that may result. Their previous reliance on the rule 
of law may be reaching an endpoint, as they now identify 
armed defense as their only option.  A move to return to 
their villages may escalate small-arms conflict in the 
region.  This instability continues to pose a considerable 
challenge to oil production in the region, as Shell has only 
recently begun pumping oil from the swamps again, and Chevron 
insists it simply will not, until the government establishes 
and maintains peace in the region.  End Comment.

OPERATIONS 
 
1. (U) An electrical fire at Lagos\' Murtala Mohammed 
International Airport temporarily disrupted flight 
operations on Thursday, October 23.  Several flights 
were diverted or delayed, but skeletal operations 
resumed within a few hours.  Airport authorities report 
that the terminal is still without power but say that 
navigational aids are unaffected; most people expect 
operations to return to normal later today. 
 
 
2. (U) According to press reports and independent 
sources, a fire broke out mid-morning in the basement 
of the airport\'s international terminal, reportedly 
after Nigeria\'s National Electric Power Authority 
(NEPA) restored the airport\'s power supply (it had been 
cut off several days earlier for non-payment of bills). 
An unexpectedly powerful electrical current apparently 
surged through the building\'s electrical panels when 
airport authorities disconnected generators and 
switched to NEPA-supplied power.  Firemen extinguished 
the fire within a few hours, but the building was left 
without electricity. 
 
 
3. (U) Six people were reported injured, but no AmCits 
were among them.  The Nigerian Minister of Aviation, 
Isa Yuguda, ordered a nine-member committee to 
investigate the cause of the fire and imposed a seven- 
day deadline for submission of its findings.

LABOR AND CIVIL SOCIETY MAY DEMONSTRATE AGAIN 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
 
(SBU) 1. The Labor and Civil Society Coalition (LASCO) held a 
press conference on 
October 23 and accused the GON and oil marketers of breaking 
an agreement reached 
between the parties on October 8. (Refs A, B)  National 
Labour Congress (NLC) 
officials told us that new organized mass action is planned 
for November 
6.  LASCO members have scheduled a meeting to mobilize 
supporters 
early in the week of October 27.  Surprisingly, the word 
\"strike\" has not been 
used in formal or informal documents from LASCO regarding the 
planned 
mobilization.  Leaders have used the phrase \"mass protest\" 
instead. 
 
 
(SBU) 2.  Bamidele Aturu, President of the United Action for 
Democracy (UAD) and 
Co-Chairman of LASCO, told POLOFF on October 23 that a final 
decision on the 
\"mass protest\" would be made at a meeting next week.  Aturu 
explained that LASCO 
officials favor democratic processes and seek broad member 
support prior to 
approving any action.  Aturu was critical of the Nigerian 
National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) and of its move to increase the price of 
fuel in its depots from 
N28 to N33, just below the agreed upon retail price of N34. 
He accused the GON and 
oil marketers of operating with \"impunity\" and asserted that 
the GON is obligated 
to regulate the price of fuel for the welfare of the people. 
A LASCO press release 
stated that the GON\'s policy of deregulation is \"totally 
unacceptable,\" arguing that 
petroleum products \"are so crucial to the well-being of the 
individual and the 
nation that their supply and distribution cannot be left to 
the whims and 
caprices of marketers and market prices.\" 
 
 
(SBU) 3.  Except for some NLC officials, however, many LASCO 
leaders argue that the 
current confrontation with GON transcends fuel deregulation 
and addresses the very 
nature of Nigerian democracy itself (Ref C).  Aturu, for 
example, bemoaned the lack 
of a \"democracy dividend\" and said: \"we didn\'t fight the 
military regime for bad 
government, corruption, and insecurity.\"  (Comment. UAD, an 
umbrella organization for 
many human rights groups, was last nationally active during 
the Abacha military 
regime and was responsible for organizing the \"Five Million 
Man March\" on Lagos 
to protest that regime. End Comment) 
 
 
GON DELAYS PROMISED CIVIL SERVANT SALARY INCREASE 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
(SBU) 4. Adding fuel to the fire, the GON has put off to 
October the retroactive 12.5% 
salary increase it promised for July to public sector 
workers.  The GON justified the 
move expressing concern about the inflationary impact of 
paying four months of salary 
arrears.  NLC officials countered that fuel deregulation has 
already caused 
\"inflationary damage,\" and confided to us that the NLC still 
plans to direct its efforts 
to fuel deregulation.  Other civil society contacts also 
voiced their concerns to PolOff 
that the burden of increased fuel prices is too onerous for a 
population whose income 
has remained stagnant for years. 
 
 
(SBU) 5.  COMMENT: The NLC remains the power broker in LASCO 
and has drummed up 
enthusiasm within civil society on the issue of fuel 
deregulation.  This enthusiasm 
appears to reflect a strong desire to use the fuel issue to 
address the myriad of other 
problems civil society sees in the nascent Nigerian 
democracy.   However, much of the 
general public passion that was palpable just before the 
planned strike and protests 
of early October has dissipated, and LASCO may have a hard 
row to hoe to reinvigorate 
the Nigerian public into mass protest action over fuel 
deregulation.  The oft brought 
up grievance of civil society remains the federal 
government\'s perceived unwillingness 
to implement policy within the institutions of a democratic 
system and to consult 
civil society before taking actions that affect society at 
all levels.

Airport has yet to be fully restored after last 
Thursday\'s electrical fire (reftel), but airport 
operations are mostly back to normal.  Regular flights 
have resumed, and passengers are again checking in at 
the airport\'s international terminal.  Airlines are 
trying to minimize the delays of manual check-ins by 
starting hours earlier than usual.  Luggage collection 
is slightly delayed (only one conveyor is working), but 
airline staff are coping by calling passengers\' names 
and distributing bags by hand. 
 
 
2. (U) Airport authorities expect operations to return 
to normal early next week.

1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Chief Odidi of Edo State spent 18 years 
in the U.S., became a U.S. citizen, and made enough money to 
return to his native town and go into politics.  While in the 
U.S., he absorbed American values and political culture, and 
now balances those ideas and aspirations against the 
realities of life as a \"big man\" in a small Nigerian town. 
End summary. 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  Greeting cards in Nigeria have grown steadily 
larger and now rival sheets of drywall in size and weight. 
Chief Stanley Okpo Odidi, Chairman of the Etsako East Local 
Government Council and recent resident of Hemet, California, 
has many of these standing around his office.  They 
congratulate him on his assumption of office two months ago 
and, indirectly, on the successful conclusion of his patient, 
extended campaign to oust his predecessor and have the 
governor of Edo State appoint him interim local government 
chairman until next year\'s election. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Odidi moved to Texas in 1981 and worked there for 
six years before moving to California.  He washed dishes and 
drove cabs before seeing an advertisement for a training 
course as a private investigator.  He took the course and 
became very good at it.  He lived in his car eating Tex-Mex 
(which he misses) for days on stakeouts, went into business 
with his former instructor, and became an American citizen. 
And he made a bundle, enough to launch himself into local 
Nigerian politics.  He came back to Nigeria in 1999, within a 
month of the resumption of civilian rule, to the town of 
Agenabode where his father had been a chief. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  Chief Odidi senior, however, had been dead more 
than 20 years.  Stanley had to remind people who he was, but 
enough of a light bulb went on in people\'s heads to help him 
get a foothold.  Money was the key ingredient, he says. \"It 
doesn\'t take much...a thousand dollars goes a long way here.\" 
 He helped a lot of people out financially and was generous 
with little favors.  And not so little:  he built a 
\"hospital\" with his own funds (it may have been only a 
clinic) and constructed a little school.  Other people in the 
district say he became active in the PDP.  He got close to 
people close to the governor of Edo State and used them to 
get a high-profile meeting with the governor that was covered 
in the press. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  Money is essential, but it is also the key 
vulnerability of Nigerian local politics, Odidi says. 
Nigerians do not have a clear sense of the public good, and 
are really only interested in what politicians can do for 
them directly.  They are in a real sense very selfish, he 
says; they think about themselves and their families, and the 
rest is of no interest.  They would rather vote for a 
politician who gives them a small cash \"dash\" than one who 
will build clinics, schools and roads.  \"It is hard to get 
people to think about \'issues,\'\" says Odidi.  If the voters 
really had their way, no money would be spent on public 
projects; the money for them would be split up and handed out 
directly to the electorate.  This makes Odidi feel 
vulnerable.  No matter how good a job he does, he can easily 
lose to someone who hands out a lot of money, as he did: 
\"money wins every time.\" 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  Odidi wants to do a good job.  His years of 
exposure to American political culture were \"tremendous\" in 
many ways, he says.  He can still give a blow-by-blow account 
of the Huffington/Boxer race in California and has adopted an 
American-style notion of community service.  Many of his 
Nigerian friends who were in the U.S. were similarly 
influenced and have come back to try to do something for the 
common good.  The notion of coming back to Nigeria to work 
for the country is not very Nigerian, he says; it isn\'t 
selfish.  He is quite aware of the impossibility of 
introducing American style democracy here.  His notion is to 
try to \"marry the two ideas,\" the American and Nigerian 
approaches to governance and the public sphere, and move 
people along slowly, helping them appreciate the benefit of 
public institutions. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  In the meantime there is the problem of getting 
his staff to come to work.  And dealing with the 50 or so 
people a day who come in to the secretariat because they are 
hungry or need school fees or clothing.  Asked what the 
district needs most, he says \"everything.\"  The area is 
\"completely poor\" and has nothing, but (particularly among 
older people) there is not necessarily a sense of being poor. 
 People feel themselves to be \"ordinary;\" they have farmed 
all their lives, have no standard of comparison with people 
elsewhere, and are accustomed to making do with little. 
Young people, however, are aware of the outside world and are 
conscious of their poverty.  They are angry and frustrated by 
it but have no idea what to do.  They don\'t believe education 
will lead anywhere as there are no local role models who have 
done well through education.  They may work as motor bike 
drivers, earning perhaps 300 naira a week if they rent the 
bike and 1000 naira if they own it.  \"But don\'t think they 
are going to revolt,\" he said. \"People here are quite docile.\" 
 
 
8.  (SBU)  What youth don\'t want to do is farm.  They look 
down on it as old fashioned, demeaning, hard work.  Within 
the borders of the district is a well-equipped agricultural 
school supported by the Leventis Foundation offering free 
education, room and board to promising young farmers for 
year-long courses.  Not one student from the district is 
there, but Odidi knows that better farming is the community\'s 
only way out and is trying to help farmers modernize.  This 
area is Nigeria\'s agricultural heartland.  The district 
supported Nigeria\'s largest farm until it collapsed with the 
removal of tariffs on imported grains.  Odidi has thus far 
organized 40 farmers into loose cooperatives to benefit from 
the tractor the district is about to buy.  He is also looking 
into other ways to improve agriculture:  seeds, new crops, 
etc.  The transport of produce to market, however, is an 
unresolved problem, as the difference between local and urban 
prices demonstrates.  A box of tomatoes selling for 4000 
naira in Lagos costs 100 naira locally, Odidi said.  Much 
local produce just rots. 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  Comment:  \"There are lots of people like me,\" says 
Odidi, \"younger, well-travelled Nigerians who have come back 
to help change things.\"  At his suggestion we visited one of 
his fellow district chairmen (in Auchi) and found someone 
considerably less comfortable in English but who nevertheless 
had run a modern business and had visited the US for trade 
fairs and training seminars.  What we find interesting in 
Odidi is the calculated blend of old and new:  the cronyism, 
the unabashed use of money, ancient ties and chiefly 
traditional authority by someone who knows why Boxer beat 
Huffington and who wants to move his community into a future 
it doesn\'t know exists.  Odidi has followed in his father\'s 
footsteps as a Nigerian \"big man,\" but he frets about his 
next election opponent and waits impatiently for someone to 
bring him his next cache of tortillas and refried beans.

TAGS: ECON, PGOV, SOCI, NI 
SUBJECT: EBONYI STATE:  FIELD OF DREAMS 
 
Sensitive but Unclassified 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Making something out of Ebonyi state 
will be a challenge.  It\'s in the middle of nowhere, and with 
Nigerian agriculture in the doldrums the state\'s prospects 
seem modest. It\'s a new state, though, and to beat the odds 
its leadership has seized on careful fiscal policy, low 
overhead and good quality in the civil service, and a 
emphasis on education.  End Summary 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  As Consulate records show no official visit to the 
small, new Nigerian state of Ebonyi, we felt the state should 
no longer be denied the aura of prestige conveyed by our 
presence in its capital.  We attempted to call and set up 
appointments.  None of the phone numbers on hand worked, so 
we decided simply to go there and see who we could see.  The 
risk in this approach was that lacking adequate notice Ebonyi 
would miss the opportunity for the pomp and circumstance 
appropriate to our visit.  We could only hope they might 
detect our approach as we crossed the state line, so from 
that point we drove slowly.  It was easy to find the seat of 
government in Abakaliki: the town is very small, as is the 
state of 2.1 million people.  To give them extra time to pull 
themselves together we parked in plain view for some 15 
minutes, and then approached Government House. 
 
 
3.  (SBU)  Governor Sam Egwu was regrettably not \"on seat\" 
(he was in Abuja), so we were ushered (respectfully, but no 
color guard) in to the anteroom of the Chief of Staff to the 
Governor, Chief M. A. Nwankwu.  The anteroom contained a 
disintegrating sofa with enough room left over for a thin 
person to slip through into the office beyond.  We were 
invited in promptly and found the Chief of Staff 
communicating effectively with a small group.  Chief Nwankwu 
had evidently been reading up on his role:  on the desk was 
\"Chiefs of Staff to the American Presidents, Kennedy to 
Carter\" and \"Effective Small Group Communication.\"  We were 
curious to see how much time would elapse before visa 
problems first came up:  less than 20 seconds.  Apparently 
Chief Nwankwu\'s passport has been with Embassy Abuja for an 
extended period.  We commiserated with his misfortune but 
told him there was nothing we could do.  He missed an 
agriculture show in the U.S., but he still hopes to catch a 
poultry show next January. 
 
 
4.  (SBU)  The first thing Chief Nwankwu wanted to emphasize 
was how important his education in the U.S. had been to him 
and to others who had studied there.  The impact of this 
capacity building, one individual at a time, could not be 
overstated, he said.  He studied at the University of 
Northern Colorado and has kept up his contacts there.  He 
wants to establish a relationship between Ebonyi and UNC in 
the field of education and hopes to take his governor there 
after they do the poultry show next year. 
 
 
5.  (SBU)  The second thing he wanted to say was that while 
Ebonyi is a small place in the middle of nowhere, it has 
plans and ideas.  Carved out of backwater areas of Enugu and 
Abia States, it became a backwater with a state flag in 1996. 
 It has always ranked very low in the indices used to 
calculate federal budgetary support, and its educational 
levels have lagged.  Public health is not a pretty picture; 
press reports indicate it has the highest incidence of guinea 
worm in the country.  Its promising agriculture sector 
crashed as a casualty of the oil boom (a familiar story in 
Nigeria), and its rice mill, the largest in Nigeria, closed. 
 
 
6.  (SBU)  The state has nowhere to go but up, said Nwankwo, 
and it intends to go there.  It has a few important 
advantages.  Its creation was not entirely a virgin birth (it 
inherited some of Enugu and Abia\'s debt burden), but it was a 
clean enough start that its new government began life without 
the huge overhang of debt and bloated civil service that 
afflict so many states.  Ebonyi, Chief Nwankwo said, has been 
extremely careful about taking on debt and has kept civil 
service salaries to about 45 percent of the budget, a much 
lower number than most Nigerian states (Ebonyi\'s capital 
investment is 30-35 percent of the budget, a very high 
number, with the balance being debt service and social 
services).  Ebonyi\'s strategy has been to go for quality: 
\"the right staff, the right caliber.\"  It pays the highest 
minimum wage of any state.  It is the only state in the 
southeast, he said, which pays federal scale and is current 
in its salary and pension payments.  It will match the 
federal government\'s promised 12.5 percent pay raise, but 
it\'s going to have to cut funding elsewhere to do it. 
 
 
7.  (SBU)  Ebonyi has hired first class consultants to help 
formulate policies for growth.  These focus heavily on 
education, said Nwankwo.  The governor has instituted 
universal free education (a very expensive proposition, and 
coverage is far from complete), built a new university, and 
established a graduate level exchange program with the United 
Kingdom (112 Ebonyi students are there already, he said). 
The government is digitizing the telephone system (which is 
why our numbers didn\'t work) and has an internet service 
provider about ready to start. 
 
 
8   (SBU)  Chief Nwankwo told us the Deputy Governor, Dr. 
Chigozie N. Ogbu, was in town but working at home.  He called 
ahead and sent us over to the official residence, a large 
dilapidated house with a view over the tin roofed town.  We 
had to wait some minutes, presumably while Dr. Ogbu changed. 
He finally appeared in resplendent white robes and gold 
chain.  The Deputy Governor turned out to be a doctor from 
Michigan, a green card holder of many years standing, who has 
several children in the States.  Like Chief Nwankwo, he 
stressed his gratitude for his education in the U.S., and 
noted how important his American experience has been 
(mid-western winters notwithstanding).  He discussed Ebonyi\'s 
quasi-Appalachian past and (hoped for) education-intensive, 
knowledge-based future in roughly the same terms as Nwankwo, 
adding that the state government has assiduously cultivated 
good labor relations and has never had a strike. 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  For a reality check, we stopped by the offices of 
the National Poverty Eradication Programme for Ebonyi, to see 
A. J. Onwubiko, its director.  This turned out to be our 
third meeting in a row with an American-trained professional. 
 We spent most of the meeting talking about his youth 
training programs (all cancelled by Abuja at present), but 
Onwubiko did confirm the thrust of the government\'s efforts 
as described by Obgo and Nwankwo, adding that given the level 
the state is starting from there is going to be a long way to 
go.  It seemed to us that poverty eradication could start in 
his office: the squalor was Dickensian. 
 
 
10.  (SBU)  Comment:  \"Build it and they will come\" (or not). 
 Is Ebonyi a Field of Dreams?  The state government is making 
the best play it can with a weak hand to make Ebonyi an 
attractive destination:  keeping debt low and the state 
fiscally sound, hiring quality staff and paying them well 
(and on time), bringing in good communications and pushing 
education to the hilt.  Location is working against them, 
however.  Their road link to Lagos goes through the black 
hole of Onitsha where traffic jams add hours to the trip. 
Ebonyi doesn\'t even have an airport.  Visitors fly into 
neighboring Enugu state, and the government drives over to 
pick them up.  These seem like determined people, but we 
aren\'t sure all of this will realistically produce a big 
improvement in the state\'s growth rate without a resurgence 
in Nigerian agriculture to support it.  Ebonyi is doing its 
part: it has just built a large new poultry hatchery.  If 
they can get their passports back and get to the poultry show 
in January, perhaps they can make it fly.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT SHUFFLES THE DECK WITH NEW OIL ADVISOR 
AND NIGERIAN OIL CORP CHIEF 
 
Classified By: J GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY. On Monday, November 3, the GON announced the 
removal of Jackson Gaius-Obaseki as the Group Managing 
Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC). Funsho Kupolokun, former Special Assistant to the 
President on Petroleum Matters, was appointed new GMD, 
effective immediately. The GON also announced Edmund Daukoru 
would replace Dr. Rilwanu Lukman as the Special Advisor to 
the President on Petroleum and Energy. Jafaru Paki will be 
the new Special Assistant to the President on Petroleum 
Matters.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
---------------- 
OUT WITH THE OLD 
---------------- 
 
 
2. (C) Jackson Gaius-Obaseki was unceremoniously replaced as 
head of NNPC by means of a terse statement read by the 
Secretary to the Government of the Federation.  Obaseki had a 
 
SIPDIS 
tumultuous tenure as NNPC chief.  His removal had been 
speculated since August 2003, when almost the entire top 
management of the NNPC was sacked. Obaseki had frequent 
run-ins with both the National Assembly and the Revenue 
Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). 
Obaseki was also never close to Presidential Adviser and 
former OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman, but seemed to 
ensure his political survival, until this week, by reporting 
directly to the President. 
 
 
3. (C) The President may have had enough of Obaseki over the 
issue of fuel deregulation.  The overall mood in Nigeria has 
been tense for the last month as organized labor threatened 
to engage on a nationwide strike to protest rising fuel costs 
as a result of the sudden Presidential announcement on 
October 1 that Nigeria\'s downstream sector would be 
deregulated immediately.  President Obasanjo wanted complete 
deregulation of the downstream sector to take effect 
immediately, whereas Obaseki supported staggered deregulation 
to lessen its impact. 
 
 
4. (U) Deregulation has been a flash point for union and 
public ire also because of the sorry state of the nation\'s 
four oil refineries.  During Obaseki\'s watch (1999-2003), 
repair and maintenance contracts worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars were paid out, yet the refineries rarely achieved 
a production level above 40 percent of capacity. Throughout 
the last year, all four refineries were offline on several 
occasions for weeks at a time.  As a result, this oil 
exporting country has had to import up to 100 percent of its 
fuel consumption needs.  While Obasanjo claims the 
elimination of subsidized NNPC crude oil and fuel purchases 
will save the country two billion dollars per year, union and 
civil society advocates point to the ongoing maintenance and 
repair work at the refineries (to no apparent end) as proof 
of systemic corruption in NNPC, which, they argue, will not 
be addressed by deregulation. 
 
 
No Stranger to Controversy 
 
 
5. (U) Obaseki frequently was called before the National 
Assembly to face charges of misappropriation of oil revenues. 
The RMAFC also investigated the NNPC concerning the operation 
of special accounts for the proceeds of crude oil sales 
(constitutional provisions require revenues to be paid into 
the Federation Account, which is shared by the federal, state 
and local governments). 
 
 
6. (U) Obaseki recently came under fire for admitting in a 
news daily that the NNPC had paid some 224 million naira 
($1.7 million US) for hotel suites he used at the Abuja Nicon 
Hilton over the last four years.  He fueled the fire by 
claiming that this was a sacrifice on his part; he said he 
was forced to stay at the Hilton because the amount allocated 
for his accommodations was inadequate to build a home 
suitable for his position and stature.  He also admitted in a 
recent interview that over 1,000 petitions had been written 
against him during his tenure as GMD of NNPC, and it is only 
by divine intervention that he was able to keep his job. 
 
 
Limited Options 
 
 
7. (C) While there is much wrong at NNPC, and even if he had 
had the best of intentions, Obaseki was limited in his 
professional and political options given the fact that 
President Obasanjo kept Lukman close as Special Advisor, and 
Obaseki was not a member of the cabinet.  Obaseki did manage 
a reorganization of NNPC, and at least in the first three 
years of Obasanjo\'s presidency, fuel queues, long the bane of 
Nigerian commerce and consumers, had virtually disappeared. 
 
 
--------------- 
IN WITH THE NEW 
--------------- 
8. (C) The new NNPC head, Funsho Kupolokun, is a former group 
executive director of NNPC, and an advocate of fuel 
deregulation. He is known to lecture audiences on the 
benefits of deregulation using a laptop PC and projector. He 
has maintained a good relationship with Obasanjo during his 
time as Special Assistant to the President on Petroleum 
Matters, and is an alumnus of the President\'s high school, 
Baptist Boys High in Abeokuta (the president is reputed to be 
kind to the boys of his school).  Kupolokun hails from Ondo 
state in the South South region. 
9. (C) Alhaji Jafaru Aliyu Paki assumes Kupolukun\'s role as 
Special Assistant to the President on Petroleum Matters. 
Paki has a long career in the petroleum industry, beginning 
with Mobil Nigeria.  He worked for NNPC at both the Warri and 
Kaduna refineries, and at the Pipelines and Products 
Marketing Company (PPMC), before being seconded to Unipetrol 
in the 1980s where he served as Executive Director for 
Marketing.  He retired when Unipetrol was privatized.  Paki 
is from Kaduna, and is reportedly close to Vice President 
Atiku. (NOTE:  According to a Shell executive, Jafaru shares 
the Vice President\'s aversion to transparency and his 
inclination to dip into the till.) 
 
 
10. (C) The GON also announced on November 3rd that Dr. 
Edmund Daukoru has assumed the position as Special Advisor to 
the President on Petroleum Matters, from which Lukman 
resigned effective November 1.  An Ijaw from Bayelsa state, 
Daukoru was a manager with Shell Oil during the 1970s and 
early \'80s, and was NNPC managing director under President 
Ibrahim Babingida.  A Shell manager reports that Daukoru is a 
director of Platform Oil, an indigenous company that recently 
won a license in Nigeria\'s marginal fields offering.  News 
reports are calling Daukoru a reform-minded technocrat.  He 
too is considered a strong advocate for downstream 
deregulation, but also said in a recent interview that better 
communication of government policy is needed to win popular 
support. 
 
 
11. (C) COMMENT: Even with NNPC\'s chronic problems, Obaseki 
was at least an approachable figure for both the Mission and 
corporate leaders.  We will report septel on the view from 
within NNPC and the oil business community regarding these 
personnel changes, and what message President Obasanjo may be 
sending by this shuffling.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TOURISM IN NIGERIA: FOR THE BIRDS 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: If a tourist came to Nigeria to look at 
endangered species (or for any other reason), he or she would 
be the most endangered species of all.  Nigeria has 
practically no tourist industry, but there is no inherent 
reason why that should be the case.  While we might have 
doubts about anyone who came to Nigeria for its urban charm, 
from the standpoint of wildlife there is much to see, and 
ecotourists needn\'t fight the crowds.  Last week a Lagos 
officer joined a group traveling around the country to assess 
the potential for bird and wildlife tourism.  The group 
included the owners of a bird tour company, a producer of 
wildlife programs for the Discovery channel, and Phil Hall, a 
long-time naturalist in Nigeria and the country 
representative of a foundation that has supported wildlife 
conservation and national park management for many years.  A 
BBC correspondent joined the group at several points and 
aired several reports on its progress.  The group concluded 
its trip much sobered and discouraged by conditions on the 
ground.  The head of the Nigerian wildlife service met with 
President Obasanjo October 27 to report on the trip and 
discuss its implications for the opening of ecotourism in 
Nigeria; Obasanjo was reportedly taken aback that anyone had 
evinced interest in Nigeria\'s national parks, but he agreed 
to throw some extra resources in their direction.  Despite 
GON efforts, or the lack thereof, a few private initiatives 
hold promise for creating sites that tourists will actually 
pay money to visit.  End summary. 
 
 
2.  (U) From an ecotourism standpoint, Nigeria has one 
particularly potent draw: picathartes oreas, Africa\'s most 
sought after bird.  It is rare, unique and on most birders\' 
top 10 list worldwide.  It can be seen only on the 
Nigeria/Cameroon border, but it is apparently present in 
Gabon.  At present all birders who want to see it go to 
Cameroon, where it is a five-day round trip (once in country) 
to its nesting sites.  The sites in Nigeria are much more 
accessible (and as an added bonus, Nigeria has forest 
elephants and mountain gorillas). 
 
 
3.  (SBU) The birding tour company was so confident of being 
able to put together a workable tour centered on picathartes 
that it has already advertised a tour for next year.  The 
itinerary would include the Cattle Ranch at Obudu, the hill 
village near the picathartes sites, savannah and riverine 
environments along the Niger River, Okomu National Park 
(probably the best remaining rainforest in West Africa) and 
the Jos Plateau.  The organizers, however, began to worry 
once they saw conditions on the ground.  Well-heeled birders 
are usually not rough and ready young backpackers.  They may 
be prepared for some rough roads, but they typically expect 
nothing like the road to picathartes, a barely passable clay 
track featuring bridges with gaping holes.  Planks needed to 
be carefully adjusted so vehicles would not fall into 
streams.  Several weeks\' work with a bulldozer in the dry 
season would take care of much of the problem, but even with 
improved access, the Cattle Ranch may leave travelers 
disappointed.  Although it is the premier tourist 
establishment in the east, it has no landline and cannot be 
reached by e-mail. 
 
 
4.  (SBU) The visit to the savannah/riverine environment in 
Edo State went without incident, but things went downhill at 
Okomu National Park.  The access road was a survival contest 
with stuck vehicles blocking the way.  One of the group\'s 
vehicles nearly became mired, and the BBC 4x4 got stuck for 
two hours.  Again, this is nothing a bulldozer couldn\'t fix 
if the work were done in the right way at the right time and 
kept up.  The lodge was a shock.  Although freshly painted on 
the outside, it looked derelict inside: shabby walls, peeling 
linoleum, black mold on the doors and ceilings, and furniture 
likely banned by some international convention.  The 
potentially picturesque thatched hut built as a dining area 
needed serious attention and cleaning (termite tubes climbed 
untended up wood surfaces to the roof).  We were told the 
national park service is not maintaining the lodge in the 
hope that the state government will build a new one.  The 
latter is seriously considering doing so, and we sat in on a 
meeting at the park to work on the proposal.  Whether a new 
lodge would be any better maintained than the existing one is 
a real question, but with new facilities, the park could be a 
gold mine.  The group found fresh elephant tracks and saw 
scores of bird species, many endemics included.  Several 
canopy platforms have been built, and these afford good views 
of exotic species (reporting officer climbed 130 feet up the 
side of a tree to reach one, an experience for which he 
considers the current post differential inadequate). 
 
 
5.  (SBU) The trip back to Lagos on the Benin/Lagos 
expressway was a complete showstopper.  The divided highway 
is always a horror show; it was no different this time.  The 
organizers concluded they would have to begin the trip 
somewhere other than Lagos, Calabar perhaps, and cover as 
much internal distance by air as possible.  The cost of air 
charter in Nigeria is almost completely prohibitive, but 
staying in the air would minimize the constant problem of 
shakedowns by police at the country\'s ubiquitous roadblocks. 
 These are beyond annoying.  They can occur every couple of 
minutes for miles on end, and without diplomatic plates or a 
willingness to shut up and pay up, every stop can be a 
problem. 
 
 
6.  (SBU) We asked the tour organizers what the odds might be 
of Nigeria working up to 500 ecotourists a year (the most 
popular preserve in Costa Rica, for comparison, gets 100,000 
visitors a year, that is the preserve, not the country). 
The odds aren\'t good, they said.  Too many things need to get 
fixed and stay fixed, and Nigeria\'s reputation is working 
against it.  They were not even sure they should run the one 
trip to which they committed.  If the ecology doesn\'t pull 
the tourists in, of course, there are always the glamorous 
casinos of Lagos.  We stopped at one near the Consulate 
recently and found a dozen waiters asleep on the kitchen 
floor and the croupiers asleep with their heads on the green 
baize. 
 
 
7.  (U) Comment: Tourism is a sensitive subject here. 
Nigerians and their supporters believe they get a bad rap 
internationally and regularly protest that the State 
Department\'s travel warnings are inaccurate and unfair. 
That said, most of our contacts will admit that the birders\' 
experience wasn\'t exceptional.  Nigerians simultaneously 
boast of wonderful natural sites and bemoan the lack of 
infrastructure to get there.  Even worse, the Miss World 
fiasco of 2002 was a devastating blow to Nigeria\'s image for 
anyone thinking of visiting. 
 
 
8.  (U) Despite the doom and gloom, there is a glimmer of 
light on the horizon.  Travel advertising in the U.S. is 
increasing in conjunction with the recently established World 
Airways direct flights from New York and Atlanta to Lagos 
(although the jury is still out on how successful that effort 
will be).  The indefatigable president of the Africa Tourism 
Association is a Nigerian, Wanle Akinboboye, who struggles to 
bring tourists, including a steady trickle of 
African-American mayors ) to Nigeria and has built an 
internationally acceptable resort that goes down well with 
foreign guests.  There is also an annual African Heritage 
Festival, heavily subsidized by the Lagos State government, 
that mightil impresses the handfu of Americans who attend. 
 
 
9.  (U) The just-cocluded 8th All Africa Games was the 
biggest boonto Nigerian tourism since Festac in 1977. 
Accordng to the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Tourism 
Association Omotay Omotosho, between August and id-October 
2003 there were 70,000 visitors assocated with the Games, 
25,000 of which were considred bona fide tourists who sought 
information frm the National Travel Bureau. 
 
 
10.  (U) For th most part, whatever hope there is for a 
tourism industry in Nigeria lies with private sector efforts. 
 A few resorts are opening, and hotels are refurbishing with 
the knowledge that if you don\'t build it, they won\'t come. 
That said, Nigeria\'s take-off as a travel destination is 
still a long way off.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIAN NATIONAL LABOUR CONGRESS OPPOSES 
OBASANJO\'S LABOR REFORM BILL 
 
 
1. (U) The latest stage in the recurring disputes between the 
President and the National Labour Congress (NLC) was 
President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s submission of a bill to the 
National Assembly to revise laws governing trade unions.  The 
bill seeks to amend Nigeria\'s Trade Unions Act by recognizing 
multiple trade unions centers and calling for voluntary union 
membership.  In addition, the bill removes a mandatory 10 per 
cent dues check-off for trade union centers, giving unions 
the option of financially supporting affiliate organizations 
like the NLC. 
 
 
2. (U) NLC Deputy President Joseph Akinlaja told ConGen\'s 
Political/Labor Specialist that the NLC met on Friday, 
October 31, and issued a communique which criticized the 
Presidency for its attempt to weaken the organization. 
Likewise, during a meeting with Anthony Jones, Country 
Director for the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center, NLC President 
Adams Oshiomhole characterized GON efforts to dismantle the 
current labor structure as a \"civilian dictatorship\" that has 
led unions \"to fight for their lives in a way they never had 
under Abacha.\"  Oshiomhole added that the NLC is considering 
several strategies to defeat the proposed legislation, 
including a plan to mobilize opposition to the bill through a 
state-by-state campaign to ensure that its rank and file 
understands the impact of the GON-proposed revisions. 
 
 
3.  (U) The NLC is also working to form alliances within the 
National Assembly and is aggressively seeking support from 
several key GON leaders, including representatives of the 
Senate and House Committees on Labor and the Senate 
President.  Akinlaja told PolSpec that the two legislative 
houses are quite supportive of labor\'s stance on a wide range 
of issues and key leaders have committed themselves to 
defeating the bill.  However, the mood at Labor House (NLC 
headquarters) is not as optimistic, according to Anthony 
Jones, who is observing NLC meetings to develop a national 
strategy.  Jones told LabOff that following the failed 
Stakeholders Forum that saw several government leaders 
distance themselves from the NLC, the NLC leadership is 
beginning to question whether its allies within government 
will serve as visible advocates for labor despite pressure 
from the Presidency. 
 
 
4. (U) Although the NLC remains optimistic, it has begun 
considering its legal options should the bill pass.  While 
the NLC is not considering strike as an option to contest 
Obasanjo\'s recent efforts to reform labor laws, its leaders 
argue that it has primarily used the right to strike as a 
tool to force the GON to honor commitments it has already 
made.  They believe that a GON commitment to bargain in good 
faith and constructively involve unions in promoting 
worker-friendly policies would empower labor in other ways 
and promote a more industrious process to resolve conflicts. 
 
 
5. Comment.  Union leaders are also seeking labor reform and 
have become increasingly philosophical as they reassess their 
role in improving the quality of life for Nigerian workers. 
Their grievances are more procedural and focus on 
establishing a sustainable process for implementing and 
enforcing collective bargaining agreements.  While unions are 
pleased with the collective bargaining process in the private 
sector, the GON has struggled to maintain productive 
relationships with key labor leaders.  The NLC leadership is 
concerned that labor\'s power lies solely in its right to 
strike, which has created an environment characterized by 
confrontation.

SUBJECT: OBASANJO, OIL MARKETERS WIN OVER LABOR AND CIVIL 
SOCIETY 
 
REF: (A) LAGOS 2200Q(B) LAGOS 2322 
 
 
(SBU) 1. SUMMARY Labor and civil society have lost steam and 
will not strike over fuel deregulation; however, there have 
been some rumblings from oil sector labor unions over the 
proposed privatization of the nation\'s refineries (SEPTEL). 
President Obasanjo appears to have successfully stymied the 
strike movement by transferring the public anger over fuel 
deregulation onto oil marketers and threatening to cut the 
National Labour Congress (NLC) off at the knees by amending 
the Trade Unions Act of 1996 (Ref B). END SUMMARY 
 
 
CIVIL SOCIETY BAILS 
------------------- 
 
 
(SBU) 2. POLOFF spoke with Bamidele Aturu, co-chairman of the 
Labor and Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), on November 3 to 
discuss LASCO\'s future plan of action.  Aturu had cooled down 
his previous remarks (Ref A) and was repeatedly vague and 
non-committal about strike action, preferring to discuss the 
nature of Nigerian democracy in broad terms as opposed to the 
specifics of deregulation.  It is clear, however, that LASCO, 
of which NLC is a member, does not favor strike action at 
this time.  POLOFF pressed Aturu on his previous comment, \"If 
Obasanjo doesn\'t come to the table, we will compel him to.\" 
He conceded that Obasanjo has not come to the table, but 
asserted that civil society members \"are not soldiers and do 
not carry arms, therefore we must use the modicum of public 
opinion.  Once we do this, people will begin to see reason.\" 
He identified public symposiums and lectures as means to 
educate the people on the perceived ills of fuel 
deregulation.  Aturu renewed his criticism of Obasanjo for 
\"putting the cart before the horse\" by essentially 
deregulating the down stream sector via executive order 
without public debate, bypassing democratic institutions as a 
mechanism for public policy change, and ignoring civil 
society as a stakeholder. 
 
 
(SBU) 3. POLOFF questioned Aturu whether LASCO could motivate 
the public behind another focused issue, as it was able to in 
October with fuel deregulation. He half-heartedly mentioned 
Local Government Area (LGA) reform as an issue he felt the 
people would rally behind.  (Note:  LGA elections that were 
to occur in April 2002 were postponed to August 2002 and now 
have been indefinitely postponed, causing much concern and 
criticism, especially in the volatile Niger Delta region. End 
note.)  Aturu further expressed the need for civil society to 
continue dialogue with GON officials and the public to 
address the continued democratization of Nigeria, a general 
position that is echoed by NLC officials, showing a 
consistent calculation not to commit to future action. This 
may also reflect the reality that traditional civil society 
has not been able to motivate the public behind one cause 
since the fall of the Abacha regime without the muscle and 
prestige of the NLC. 
 
 
(SBU) 4. J. I. Akinlaja, General Secretary of the National 
Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), 
discussed deregulation with POLOFF on 4 November.  Akinlaja 
echoed both Aturu\'s sentiments on deregulation and his 
cautious demeanor. In a meeting on October 31, the NLC 
membership voted not to strike over the issue of fuel 
deregulation.  Instead, Akinlaja, who also serves as the Vice 
President of the NLC, said that labor would assess the 
situation during the month of November and then decide on 
their next action. In the interim, LASCO representatives and 
concerned Nigerians would be visiting each of the 36 states 
to observe the effects of deregulation on the people. 
Akinlaja showed particular concern for the rising costs of 
petroleum products and other basic goods.  The NLC reportedly 
solidified this position in a letter to Obasanjo on 6 
November. 
 
 
(SBU) 5. COMMENT  Obasanjo appears to have yet again mastered 
the Nigerian political game -- at least stage one of the 
battle over fuel deregulation.  He has forced through public 
policy on his own terms and successfully diffused much of the 
criticism by diverting it onto the oil marketers, claiming 
that the GON no longer had a role in the price of fuel.  In 
addition, he was able to prolong political maneuvering and 
lull LASCO into coming to the negotiation table -- avoiding a 
strike and sucking the wind out of their sails.  As a result, 
labor and civil society have not been able to successfully 
rally the public behind their cause as they had done in early 
October. Their continued non-committal pattern and not 
seizing upon opportunities to strengthen their position by 
disrupting high level international events, such as the All 
Africa Games and the upcoming December 8 Commonwealth Heads 
of Government Meeting (CHOGM), appear to reflect a desire to 
not rock the boat too hard.  (Note:  NLC Chairman Adams 
Oshiomole in a press interview on November 7 stated that NLC 
would not target CHOGM. End note.) In essence, labor and 
civil society are talking the talk, but not walking the walk.

SUBJECT: OUT IN AFRICA: A VISIT TO EKITI STATE 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1. (U) Summary.  PolOffs made a one day familiarization visit 
to the tiny land-locked State of Ekiti.  In April 2003, 
Ekiti, like its neighboring states in the southwest except 
Lagos, got rid of its Alliance for Democracy governor and 
elected a representative of the ruling Peoples Democratic 
Party. But the new governor is fighting off challenges to his 
election and may yet lose his seat.  Though Ekiti is small 
and poor, it is better off in some ways than other southern 
states. End summary. 
 
 
Ekiti - small state, big plans, no money 
 
 
2. (U) Ekiti State was carved out of the northern end of Ondo 
State in 1996. With its population of nearly two million, the 
majority of whom are ethnic Ekitis (a sub-group of the Yoruba 
tribe), it is the newest, smallest (in population), and, by 
some reports, the poorest of Nigeria\'s thirty-six states. 
Most of the topography of Ekiti is softly rounded, 
rain-eroded hill country.  In fact, the word \"ekiti\" means 
\"hill\" in the local dialect and a number of the towns in the 
State have hyphenated names that end in \"ekiti.\"   For 
decades, the economy was based mainly on the production of 
cocoa and palm oil.  However, with the development of the oil 
industry in the mid-seventies, Ekiti (then still part of Ondo 
State), like the rest of Nigeria, abandoned most of its 
traditional sources of income and waited for its share of the 
oil wealth.  According o most Ekiti residents, they decided 
to raise their visibility by forming their own State because 
whatever oil moneys the State of Ondo was allocated never 
seemed to trickle down to them. 
 
 
3. (U) Politically, Ekiti had been a minor player in the 
Yoruba-controlled, southwest bloc of states that had been 
firmly with the Alliance for Democracy (AD) Party.  Its 
relationship with the AD was severed in the 2003 elections 
when the majority Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won the 
governorship, the National Assembly seats and carried the 
state for President Olusegun Obasanjo. 
 
 
Getting there 
 
 
4. (U) There are two reasons to go to Ekiti by car.  First, 
there is a sign outside the capital of Ado-Ekiti announcing 
an airport nearby, but no flights are listed for this airport 
and no one we talked to knew if it is still used at all. 
Second, compared to all the roads in the southeast and most 
of the roads in the southwest, the roads to and in Ekiti are 
surprisingly good.  The median strips and soft shoulders on 
the highways have, obviously, not seen a road crew in decades 
and are so overgrown in some places that the road appears to 
be one long, green tunnel.  However, we encountered no 
vehicle-devouring potholes, and, although there were the 
usual checkpoints every mile or so, our armored US vehicle 
with diplomatic plates breezed past them at sixty miles an 
hour. 
 
 
5. (U) The city of Ado-Ekiti is clean, compared to Lagos, and 
its buildings and roads appeared to be maintained.  Heavy 
morning rush hour traffic was moving at a reasonable speed 
unencumbered by that bane of Lagos residents, the okada 
(dare-devil drivers of motorcycle transportation for hire.) 
The okadas are replaced on Ado-Ekiti streets by brightly 
painted, and sedately driven, red and yellow taxis. We saw no 
beggars.  The main market was crowded and busy and appeared 
to be well stocked with food, household goods and clothes. 
In the morning and afternoon, groups of uniformed school 
children walked to or from the many schools that were open, 
operating and seemed well attended. The PDP and AD had 
offices on the main thoroughfare, as did the Justice Party, 
the National Conscience Party (NCP), the Justice Center for 
the Less Privileged, the Poverty Eradication Program, the 
Hare Krishna Society, and the Church of Latter Day Saints. 
 
 
His Excellency 
 
 
6. (U) Since we visited Ekiti during Ramadan, Governor Ayo 
Fayose, who is Muslim, may have been fasting and for that 
reason unable to meet with us.  His aide said he was engaged 
in urgent meetings.  However, another reason may have been 
that controversy has surrounded Fayose since before he was 
chosen by the PDP to run for governor this year, and he may 
have been avoiding another probing of his problems.  His 
detractors say that he has lied about his academic 
credentials and that he was a less than honorable businessman 
(he owns a car dealership).  Femi Falana, NCP candidate for 
Governor of Ekiti, attorney and one of the founders of the 
embattled Committee for Defense of Human Rights (CDHR) 
(septel), has demanded that Fayose account for 4.5 billion 
naira.  Fayose allegedly received the money from the GON for 
Ekiti State since the gubernatorial elections.  Falana claims 
the governor has not spent any of the billions of naira to 
help citizens of Ekiti, and he ought not to claim the state 
is poor just because it receives the smallest federal 
allocation.  Last, but certainly not least, Fayose\'s election 
as governor is still being challenged in the Election 
Tribunals, and he recently lost an appeal of a lower court 
decision in the case, which means he faces more weeks, if not 
months, of uncertainty as to whether or not he will continue 
to be governor. 
 
 
Her Excellency 
 
 
7. (U) PolOffs were invited to have lunch at the governor\'s 
residence with the wives of the Governor and Deputy Governor. 
 Feyisetan Fayose, or \"Her Excellency Mrs. Fayose\" as she 
prefers to be called, had laid on a Nigerian-style official 
reception complete with prepared remarks, videocameras, and 
fifteen or twenty members of her staff in attendance to 
applaud at appropriate points in her speech.  Although her 
husband has been in office for only a few months, she has 
already set up the \"Fayose Foundation\" which, she says, will 
work on the problems of HIV/AIDS in Ekiti including provision 
of medical care, drug and condom distribution, educational 
and nutritional programs, and hospice care.  She went on at 
length to describe plans for her Foundation to provide 
mobility aids for the handicapped, aid and training for 
handicapped persons who want to work, micro-loans to empower 
women who want to start their own businesses, family planning 
advice, senior citizens\' services, poverty eradication and 
improved healthcare state-wide.  Her challenges in getting 
started are money and equipment, and she was not hesitant in 
asking what the USG could do to help. We advised her that the 
USG has many programs that might be able to help, but her 
group would have to prepare proposals that we could consider. 
 
 
8. (U) At lunch, the wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Esther 
Alulco, was more talkative and seemed more politically savvy 
than the Governor\'s wife.  She said that AD is finished as a 
power in Ekiti but will survive as a \"relic\".  On the other 
hand, Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural group that is one 
of founders of AD will continue to be a force in the state 
because, she said, \"we are of the Yoruba culture.\"  Though 
apparently good-intentioned, neither woman has any prior 
training or experience in any of the areas in which they 
proposed to make their marks -- social work, community health 
services, education.   An example: as we stepped outside the 
door to leave the governor\'s residence, we were met by a 
full-grown ostrich.  The governor\'s wife said that there had 
been two ostriches when they took over the residence, but one 
had died.  When asked if the survivor was male or female, she 
said she didn\'t know.  We suggested that if the bird laid 
eggs, it might be female.  She said it did lay eggs, but she 
seemed reluctant to accept that this established the bird as 
female. 
 
 
9. (C) Comment.  Four years until the next governors\' 
election is a long time.  While it may appear now that the AD 
is \"finished\" in Ekiti, the new PDP governor is not yet sure 
of keeping his office.  In addition, though he has only been 
in office for less than six months, he has yet to make any 
significant moves to better the lives of his constituents, 
and without an infusion of funds from somewhere, he may never 
be able to get any beneficial programs started.  Fayose is 
reported to have a \"back to the soil\" program in the works 
that will give funds and training to any unemployed Ekiti who 
wants to get back into traditional farming, preferably the 
production of cocoa.  Former Minister of Science and 
Technology, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, 
and Senator for Ekiti South district, Dr. Bode Olowoporoku, 
has introduced federal legislation that would direct funds to 
projects like this.  If the Governor and the Senator can get 
the funding, which is always the problem in Nigeria, this may 
be the way forward for Ekiti.  If they can, the tiny state 
may be one half step ahead of other states that continue to 
clamor for a return to local or regional control of their 
resources.

SUBJECT: FMR BIAFRAN PRESIDENT GENERAL OJUKWU MEETS WITH CG 
 
 1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Consul General and POLOFF (notetaker) met 
with former Biafran President General Chief Chukwuemeka 
Odumegwu Ojukwu and his assistant Prince Bob J. Onyema on 10 
November.  Ojukwu has plans to travel to the US at the end of 
November.  Ojukwu discussed court cases contesting the 
results of the 2003 national election; the All Progressive 
Grand Alliance (APGA) party\'s consultations with the All 
Nigeria\'s People\'s Party (ANPP) and the 2007 presidential 
election; national reforms and economic development; Biafran 
independence groups; and politics of the South-South and 
South-East. END SUMMARY 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
CONTEST OF THE 2003 ELECTION RESULTS 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
2. (SBU) \"I oppose the presidency of Obasanjo, that is what I 
do generally,\" was his opening greeting to the CG when asked 
of his current activities.  Ojukwu speculated on pending 
court cases contesting gubernatorial elections, believing 
that the results could be overturned in APGA\'s favor in two 
states in the South-East and one in the South-South.  He 
commented that Governor Muhammadu Buhari\'s contest of the 
2003 presidential election \"will take a long time\" because 
there is \"no capable judge or one who has the courage to 
pronounce\" a decision against Obasanjo.  Ojukwu prophesied a 
two-year court battle, resulting in no \"dramatic change.\" 
Ojukwu concluded by saying that the President\'s People\'s 
Democratic Party (PDP) \"didn\'t do very well; they won, but 
they didn\'t do very well.\" 
 
 
------------------------------- 
APGA AND ANPP UNIFIED FOR 2007? 
------------------------------- 
 
 
3. (SBU) Ojukwu turned his attention to the 2007 presidential 
election.  He does not believe that Buhari and the ANPP will 
win the national election, but believes the party will 
consolidate its position in the North.  A \"viable alliance\" 
between the north\'s ANPP and the east\'s APGA might improve 
ANPP\'s chances and he stated that APGA is already \"seeing 
what we can do.\"  Although Ojukwu said there are many things 
that the ANPP and APGA agree upon -- such as stamping out 
corruption -- he foresaw stumbling blocks in regards to 
economic development, and appointments based on quotas 
instead of merit.  Furthermore, Ojukwu does not believe there 
can be any compromise on Shari\'a between the devoutly 
Catholic Igbos and northern Muslims and he questioned why 
Nigeria should be a member of the Organization of Islamic 
Countries (OIC).  On the economic front, Ojukwu said that the 
continued marginalization and slow to non-existent economic 
development in the Niger Delta and South-East would not be 
alleviated by the ANPP.  However, Ojukwu views the 
consultation between the ANPP and APGA positively and 
believes that continuous dialogue will improve conditions in 
the long run, despite their disagreements. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND REFORMS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) Other OPEC countries, Ojukwu explained, use oil 
revenues to build roads, but in Nigeria \"we use oil to feed 
people - a policy that needs to be changed.\"  He argued that 
Arab nations do not need oil for foodstuffs because their 
populations are small.  Then he blamed the oil producing Arab 
states for making \"corruption a way of life,\" presumably 
making a parallel to the chronic state of corruption in 
Nigeria, especially in regards to oil revenues.  The CG asked 
if the need for oil was exacerbated ecause Nigerians have 
left their former economic activities, such as agriculture, 
for jobs in the oil sector.  Ojukwu insisted that this 
development occurred before the oil boom, stating that 
Malaysia once used Nigeria as a model for its palm oil 
industry, of which Nigeria was a major exporter.  Now Nigeria 
imports palm oil from Malaysia.  The CG pointed to the vast 
plantations in Malaysia and questioned why Nigeria could not 
do the same.  Ojukwu likened the disparity to the lack of 
national identity in Nigeria.  Malaysia has \"a polity with a 
sense of nationhood that we don\'t have,\" Ojukwu continued to 
explain.  Everything in Nigeria is destroyed, because 
Nigerians first think of their ethnicity and not of their 
country no matter how large or small the event is.  \"Until we 
can find that polity, we will not progress.  We need a 
national conference to redesign Nigeria for Nigerians as 
opposed to a patchwork of Nigeria to suit British commercial 
interests.  We were handed Nigeria in that form and we are 
too shy to do something fundamentally different.\" 
 
 
5. (SBU) Ojukwu showed great optimism for Nigeria, believing 
it could become \"the biggest and most dynamic country in 
black Africa, but first it must become a cohesive nation.  No 
one can do it for us, but ourselves.\"  He stressed the need 
for constitutional reform and decentralization, saying \"it 
should be written into the constitution that there must be a 
constitutional review every five years.  If we don\'t, we are 
mortgaging the future of the next generation based on the 
ignorance of the previous one.\"  However, Ojukwu expressed 
sadness in the fact that any cause he were to champion would 
be colored by the Biafran War and perceived as a means to 
lead Biafrans again.  Nevertheless, Ojukwu concluded, \"I am 
still alive.  I am still Nigerian and I will continue to make 
suggestions.\" 
 
 
--------------------------- 
BIAFRAN INDEPENDENCE GROUPS 
--------------------------- 
 
 
6. (SBU) When asked about Biafran independence groups, Ojukwu 
said that they represent mostly youths exercising freedom of 
expression.  He did not believe that they can succeed in the 
short-run and was not alarmed by their assertions.  He did, 
however, describe this movement as a reflection of the 
frustrations of the people in the region, highlighting the 
economic deprivation and unemployment that plagues the nation 
and the Igbos of the East.  \"Even in democratic practice, we 
should learn to tolerate things unpleasant,\" Ojukwu opined. 
He recounted that in a meeting with President Obasanjo, 
Ojukwu could not denounce these groups as \"they are Igbos and 
have some justifications.\"  He advised the President to 
listen to them and find ways to alleviate their problems. 
\"It is a cry; and as a President you should do something to 
help them.\"  In the east, the most dangerous development is 
hunger.  Ojukwu observed that distended stomachs were 
becoming a common sight in the East and he worried that when 
properly enraged, these people may make the troubles in the 
Delta seem minor by comparison. 
 
 
------------------------------ 
SOUTHERN POLITICS: A JAMBALAYA 
------------------------------ 
 
 
7. (SBU) The Federal Government has long ignored the plights 
of Delta and Rivers States, Ojukwu explained.  He stressed 
the irony that the region that produces the nation\'s wealth 
does not reflect it and the people of the region \"are doing 
nothing, not even agriculture.\"  He understood their 
frustration and expressed compassion for their condition. 
\"No amount of troops will quell the political effort,\" he 
said in reference to the Nigerian military\'s Operation 
Restore Hope in Delta State.  \"The side I find troublesome is 
the blackmailing of oil companies.  I don\'t support that 
transaction.  They should blackmail their own government\" to 
do something about their problems rather than the companies 
that were easy targets.  Furthermore, Ojukwu regretted the 
practice because \"success triggers\" the trend.  There needs 
to be a long-term solution from the GON. 
 
 
------------------------ 
THE TROUBLE WITH ANAMBRA 
------------------------ 
 
 
8. (SBU) Ojukwu ended his discussion by focusing on the state 
politics of Anambra and the need for decentralization. 
(Background: Governor Chris Ngige, was kidnapped by the man 
who financed and rigged his election for not following 
through on back room promises some of which were made while 
the aspiring governor was naked.  The bizarre incident caused 
a state constitutional crisis and political brawl that 
attracted national attention.)  Embattled Governor Ngige 
apparently sought assistance from Ojukwu who chuckled when 
describing how he has been hiding so that no one will try to 
hand the troubles of Anambra over to him.  He described the 
situation in Anambra as tragic and shared the CG\'s amazement 
at how Anambra\'s crooked politicians brazenly operate with 
impunity.  \"I told Ngige, as long as I have a picture of you 
naked, you\'re not fit to be a governor.\" 
 
 
9.  (SBU)  Anambra, in Ojukwu\'s opinion, reflects a core 
problem in Nigerian politics -- too much power rested in the 
Federal Government.  Ojukwu heavily advocated 
decentralization, saying that states only exist when based on 
constitutions that derive power from within the state, not 
from a \"proclamation from the center.\"  He identified a first 
step as giving powers to the already existing zonal 
structures, or regional groupings of states.  In reflection, 
Ojukwu tied decentralization to his own political ghost of 
Biafra, believing that the GON\'s biggest but erroneous fear 
is that decentralization would reopen these old national 
wounds.  \"That was not the reason for the war,\" he 
pronounced.  Ojukwu concluded that when politicians and 
individuals accept responsibility and address problems that 
need to be addressed, \"Nigeria will stand as a beacon to the 
rest of Africa.  I want to tell the people who are living 
here now that we haven\'t arrived there yet, but we will.\" 
 
 
--------------------- 
BIOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND 
--------------------- 
 
 
10. (SBU) Ojukwu was born November 4, 1933 in Zungeru, Niger 
State.  He received his primary and secondary education in 
Nigeria and a B.A. and M.A. in the United Kingdom, studying 
history at Epsom College, Lincoln College, and the University 
of Oxford and concluded his education in 1962.  He also 
received military training from the Eaton Hall Office Cadet 
School and Joint Services Staff College in the UK.  Ojukwu 
enlisted in the Nigerian Army in 1957 and was based in the 
North, rising to the rank of Colonel in 1962.  From 1966 to 
1967, Ojukwu was appointed Military Governor of the defunct 
Eastern Region.  In May 1967 he was proclaimed Head of State 
and Commander-In-Chief of the \"Republic of Biafra\" and was 
dismissed from the Nigerian Army in July of that year.  In 
1968 he was made General of the Biafran Army and held that 
position throughout the Biafran Civil War of 1967-1970.  In 
January 1970 he was granted political asylum in Cote d\'Ivoire 
and did not return to Nigeria until his pardon on June 18, 
1982.  He holds the traditional titles of Ikemba Nnewi and 
Eze Igbo, is married, and maintains his address at 29 Queens 
Drive, Ikoyi, Lagos.  He has another residence in Enugu 
State.  He will travel on 29 November to Maryland with his 
wife where he receives regular medical treatment for his 
eyes.  He said that when in the US, he doesn\'t go out much 
and he is looking forward to staying in his hotel and reading 
his books.  Ojukwu does not often like to travel saying, \"I 
have a thing about traveling out of Nigeria.  Ever since I 
returned from exile, I never felt comfortable leaving.\"  His 
wife, however, is a frequent traveler and often buys products 
for her beauty shop in Nigeria.

SUBJECT: AMCITS NOT/NOT TAKEN HOSTAGE IN DELTA - CHEVRON 
USES NEW STRATEGY 
 
 
Classified By: J GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (C) 
 
 
1. (C)  Chevron\'s special security manager, Hamish Macdonald 
(sic), told Econoff on November 14 that no Americans were 
taken hostage in an incident earlier this week.  Press 
reports indicate that four barges and 21 Chevron contractors 
were seized by Ijaw youths in the riverine area near Warri on 
November 11.  The hostages and barges were reported to have 
been released the following day. 
 
 
2. (C) Macdonald said that all the kidnapped contractors were 
Nigerian, and that Chevron was able to secure their release 
shortly after the company was made aware of their capture. 
He said that while the barges were retrieved, equipment and 
foodstuffs onboard had been pilfered and vandalized. 
 
 
3. (C) Macdonald further told Econoff that Chevron employed a 
new strategy in dealing with the incident that should prove a 
successful model for similar incidents and for ongoing 
negotiations with communities for access to and safety of oil 
installations in the Delta swamps.  Macdonald was reluctant 
to go into detail via mobile phone, but he said the company 
used the Delta State Security Council to secure the release 
of the hostages and barges.  He said that unlike previous 
incidents, the Council was effective this week because it 
convened key community leaders and traditional rulers that 
held sway with the youths involved. 
 
 
4. (C) Macdonald said Chevron paid no money and made no 
promises for return of the kidnapped personnel and stolen 
barges; he said \"this was handled the right way, and the way 
we all should handle community relations.\"  He said he was 
encouraged by the prospect of using the new strategy to help 
return Chevron to its onshore fields in the Delta.  Macdonald 
offered to meet Econoff in person next week to discuss the 
steps taken in this incident.

SUBJECT: OBASANJO SHOULD RESIGN CLAIMS CIVIL SOCIETY GROUP, 
UNITED ACTION FOR DEMOCRACY 
 
REF: (A) LAGOS 2200 (B) LAGOS 2322 (C) LAGOS 2330 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Civil society organizations continue to 
agitate on the national scene in an attempt to realize public 
policy and institutional reform, but have yet to produce real 
movement in that direction.  Calls for protest against the 
upcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) 
appear to be hollow, and possible disruptions will likely be 
minimal -- if noticeable at all. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (SBU) United Action for Democracy (UAD) has called for 
President Obasanjo to resign from office, claiming that 
Obasanjo \"has not listened to public opinion\" and runs a 
government akin to a \"military dictatorship.\"  UAD has also 
\"advised\" heads of state not to attend CHOGM scheduled for 
December 3-6 in Abuja, but claims that they will not 
\"blackmail\" the high profile event.  The group argues that 
Nigeria is not fit to host the event under the present 
administration, which it claims came into office through 
electoral fraud.  It also renewed its criticism of Obasanjo\'s 
recent policies and slow or nonexistent implementation of 
democratization (Refs A, B, and C).  UAD claims that 
forty-six other organizations are collaborating with it in 
this effort.  However, it is important to note that the 
National Labour Congress (NLC), UAD\'s partner in the Labour 
and Civil Society Organization (LASCO) in protesting the 
GON\'s recent fuel deregulation, is visibly absent, as is 
LASCO itself. 
 
 
3. (SBU) POLOFF spoke with Bamidele Aturu, president of UAD, 
on 13 November.  Aturu, who is also the co-chairman of LASCO, 
told us UAD will hold a symposium in Lagos on November 18 for 
member NGOs to discuss the state of Nigeria\'s democracy. 
Time and venue had not yet been determined, but Aturu said he 
is expecting one hundred persons to attend.  Aturu also 
announced that a rally is planned for December 3, the opening 
day of CHOGM, in the Yaba district of Lagos.  Other rallies 
are promised nation-wide, including Abuja, but plans for 
these other events are not yet firm.  As with fuel 
deregulation, the largest complaint of UAD and other civil 
society organizations is that the GON regularly fails to 
consult with them before it implements public policy that 
affects their constituencies.  They complain that Obasanjo\'s 
style of government is little different than that of a 
military dictatorship and they have begun to advocate 
impeachment as a means to remove him from office. 
 
 
4. (SBU) POLOFF\'s counterpart at the British Deputy High 
Commission told her last week that HRM Queen Elizabeth II 
will arrive in Abuja on December 3 to officially open CHOGM 
and will stay in Abuja for the entire conference, departing 
on December 6.  Her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, will 
accompany the Queen to Abuja, but has also scheduled a visit 
to Lagos.  Prime Minister Tony Blair is scheduled to arrive 
December 4 and will depart on December 8.  When informed by 
POLOFF of the possibility of UAD rallies in Abuja during the 
Queen\'s stay, the BDHC did not express concern. 
 
 
5. (SBU) COMMENT: Bamidele Aturu, who appeared to have left 
the human rights struggle in Nigeria after the fall of the 
Abacha regime, has become visible again in the past two 
months, making many statements urging civil disobedience.  To 
date, there has been no public response in the form of 
demonstrations or protests on the issues that he raises.  His 
criticisms of the government may have intellectual merit, but 
little application or efficacy in the Nigerian body politic. 
In a society that even Obasanjo himself describes as always 
pursuing \"position, power, possession, plaudit, popularity, 
and pleasure\", it is possible that Aturu is positioning 
himself on the national stage for self-aggrandizement, as 
well as forwarding his philosophies.  Regardless of Aturu\'s 
personal motives, the increased activity of civil society 
organizations is a positive sign of the continuing 
democratization of Nigeria. 
 
 
6. (SBU) The non-governmental organizations (NGOs) comprising 
civil society have in general been seeking to define 
themselves since the fall of the Abacha regime.  With the 
menace of military dictatorship no longer looming on the 
horizon, their identities are yet to be solidified.  Although 
these NGOs were able to effectively organize against 
Obasanjo\'s fuel deregulation policy, under the leadership of 
LASCO they were unable to follow through and effect change. 
While these NGO leaders philosophize and advocate privately 
and within their own circles, their calls have yet t 
resonate loudly among the Nigerian public. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BAKASSI: THE VIEW FROM CROSS RIVER STATE 
 
 
REF: YAOUNDE 1667 
 
 
1.(SBU)   SUMMARY. Political, traditional, military and 
civilian officials in southeastern Nigeria see peaceful 
negotiations as the best resolution to the dispute 
between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi 
Peninsula. While Bakassi indigenes feel left out of the 
implementation process for the International Court of 
Justice ruling, the state governor, residents, military 
officers and traditional leaders say they have no plans 
other than negotiation to promote the Nigerian agenda. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2.(SBU)   In a recent visit to Cross River State, Lagos 
Consul General and PAS Information officer met 
separately with a variety of political, military and 
traditional stakeholders with an interest in the future 
of the Bakassi Peninsula. The Peninsula, a strip of 
coastal swamp, forms the southeastern most tip of Cross 
River State. Both Nigeria and Cameroon claim 
sovereignty over the 1000-square kilometer peninsula, 
and over oil exploration in the Gulf of Guinea around 
its coastline.  Members of the Efik fishing community 
that live on the peninsula regard themselves as part of 
Nigeria.  Although there are no accurate population 
figures, several sources made a guesstimate of 5,000 
Nigerian inhabitants. 
 
 
3.(SBU)   While all parties said that Nigeria will respect 
the ICJ ruling, they will do everything possible to 
peacefully protest it. Cross River Governor Donald Duke 
characterized Nigeria\'s negotiations with Cameroon as a 
homegrown and \"unique solution to a common African 
problem,\" rather than an international solution. 
 
 
4.(SBU)   Nella Andem-Ewa, an attorney, former Cross River 
justice minister, and a member of the Nigeria-Cameroon 
Mixed Commission responsible for implementing the ICJ 
decision told CG that,  \"We are not trying to set aside 
the (ICJ) judgment, we are only trying to find a better 
way to implement the judgment in a way that properly 
safeguards the interests of Nigeria and Cameroon.\" The 
Bakassi residents \"should be assured that their 
interests are being taken care of,\" she added. 
 
 
5.(SBU)   Andem-Ewa said the Nigeria-Cameroon Mixed 
Commission and its subcommissions on population and 
border issues, are now making good progress at 
implementing the ICJ ruling, which covers the entire 
Nigeria-Cameroon border from Lake Chad to the Gulf of 
Guinea.  Earlier this year, Nigeria announced that it 
would be pulling its troops out of disputed areas 
around Lake Chad.  This progress follows earlier 
misgivings over the commission\'s purpose and mutual 
suspicions that the countries had hidden agendas in 
working with the commission.  Andem-Ewa said that the 
commission will now move to the land border, followed 
by the Bakassi issue, finishing with the offshore 
disputes. 
 
 
6.(SBU)   Andem-Ewa said there is no Nigerian push to gain 
control of Bakassi because of oil, explaining that most 
oil deposits are offshore, beyond the reach of the ICJ 
ruling, and already under Cameroonian control.  She 
said her personal opinion is that joint control of the 
peninsula could be an option, an idea that other 
officials supported.  She said the laws of possession 
and control give Nigeria the right to at least some of 
the water bordering the peninsula and added that by the 
time the boundary delineation is concluded, Cameroon 
will see that it still owns those areas it laid claim 
to before the dispute. 
 
 
7.(SBU)   The paramount traditional ruler of Bakassi, His 
Royal Highness Etinyin Etim Okon Edet was less 
conciliatory.  He railed against Cameroon, the ICJ and 
the international community (including America) for 
turning over Nigerian territory to Cameroon.  Edet 
vehemently argued that the ICJ ruling is in bad faith 
because it fails to address the plight of the people 
living in the peninsula.  He urged the international 
community to stop relying on the \"technicality of law\" 
to solve a problem that is bound to affect the lives 
and destiny of a people.  The paramount ruler (who 
stands to be a leader without any land or followers if 
Bakassi goes to Cameroon) claimed that the ICJ was 
stacked against Nigeria, that the conclusion was 
unfair, and that not a single Cameroonian can claim 
residence in the peninsula.  Another of his key 
arguments was that Nigerians don\'t even speak French. 
 
 
8.(SBU)   If Nigeria would not fight to keep Bakassi, Edet 
said, then Bakassi residents should hold a plebiscite 
to decide which country they want to join.  (Andem-Ewa 
and Duke also supported the idea.)  The paramount ruler 
went on to argue that if such a vote were not possible, 
he would consider peacefully seceding to form his own 
country along the lines of what he characterized as 
other small, \"successful\" African countries like Sao 
Tome and Guinea Bissau.  Edet said his opposition to 
Cameroonian citizenship for Bakassi residents stems 
from the historical connection of his Efik ethnic group 
to the Efik chiefs in Calabar.  \"We have affinity with 
the Oba of Calabar, and we are sad that the ruling 
overlooked this important fact,\" Edet said. 
 
 
9.(SBU)   Edet, Andem-Ewa and Duke all said that the ICJ 
never visited or consulted with the Bakassi residents 
before the ruling, but Andem-Ewa said the commission 
planned to meet with the residents before it took 
further decisions.  All three of our interlocutors 
observed that the ICJ ruling negatively affects growth 
and development of the peninsula.  Both the GON and the 
state governments have suspended development in Bakassi 
until the dispute is resolved.  Governor Duke said the 
only project he has been willing to undertake is the 
drilling of boreholes which, although technically 
illegal on \"Cameroonian\" territory, is justified as a 
humanitarian project.  Many officials said that sea- 
side erosion is causing significant problems on the 
peninsula.  (Comment:  While jetties on the south of 
the island have washed away, dire predictions of \"no 
Bakassi by 2005\" seem exaggerated. End comment) 
 
 
10.(SBU)  Brigade Commander Y.M. Dogo, in charge of the 
Nigerian soldiers deployed to Bakassi, showed ConGen 
staff a room-sized model of the Bakassi Peninsula, with 
the disputed boundary clearly demarcated.  Presently, 
he said, one-third of the peninsula is ceded to 
Cameroon, although no one lives there; the remaining 
two-thirds is inhabited by Nigerian villagers.  Dogo 
said that his men, who have been deployed to Bakassi 
for a decade, are determined and prepared to defend 
Nigerian territories, but plan to fight only if 
provoked. 
 
 
11.(SBU)  COMMENT.  A final solution to the Bakassi dispute 
may be far off but all Nigerian parties seem committed 
to using the Mixed Commission to resolve it peacefully. 
Despite his protests, Paramount Ruler Edet has neither 
the political room, the economic resources nor the 
military might to back up his threats of secession.  As 
the Commission works out its solution, though, 
humanitarian development will continue to suffer as 
neither country wants to invest in land over which it 
does not have assured control.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  Engaging Islam in Southern Nigeria. 
 
Ref: Abuja 001949. 
 
 
1.   Summary:  Working closely with PAS, post engaged the 
southern Muslim community on the \"Shared Meaning of Ramadan 
and Thanksgiving\" and hosted an Iftaar dinner for Muslim 
community leaders. 
 
 
2.   The Media Message:  During Ramadan, ConGen Lagos 
reached out to southern Nigeria\'s Muslim community through 
both live and taped radio talk shows, distribution of post- 
produced publications, roundtable discussions with print 
media and interviews for broadcast news.  Post targeted 
local language media outlets and Muslim-focused broadcast 
shows, in addition to a nationally syndicated television 
talk show.  To improve its outreach, post utilized high- 
ranking post staff like the Consul General as well as a 
Muslim spouse who has lived in America and an officer who 
used Yoruba to multiply the message. 
 
 
3.   Post has already seen media coverage of one-half of 
these engagements and expects the balance to appear by 
November 28.  By that time, post\'s message will have reached 
millions of Nigerians, including the large Hausa Muslim 
community in Lagos, the middle-class Yoruba Muslim community 
of Lagos and the Yoruba Muslim community in Ibadan that is 
often seen as the leadership of the southwestern Nigerian 
Muslims. 
 
 
4.   Post\'s message focused on the shared meaning of Ramadan 
and Thanksgiving.  Beyond the coincidence of timing this 
year, Post highlighted the values of charity, reflection, 
family and -- ultimately -- celebration that characterize 
the two holidays.  Using this positive message as a 
springboard, Post staff discussed the practice of Islam in 
America, particularly the enshrined freedoms of a 
multicultural group to practice its faith as it wishes. 
Staff discussed the formal laws that protect freedom of 
religion in America, as well as the increasing realization 
that there is a need to better understand Islam through 
informal channels like President Bush\'s Iftaar dinners. 
 
 
5.   Moving to foreign policy, staff stressed that the war 
on terrorism is not a war on Islam and highlighted President 
Bush\'s own statements from September 17, 2001 on the need to 
disassociate the two ideas.  This being Nigeria, inevitably 
discussions also turned to visas.  Staff had the opportunity 
to clarify many misconceptions about US visa policy.  They 
addressed the fact that visa policies have become stricter 
across the board since September 11, regardless of religion, 
but that Muslim applicants are not singled out or refused 
NIVs based on name, religion, or the number of wives they 
have.  Lastly, staff highlighted the cooperation between 
Nigeria and the USG to fight terrorism and support an open 
democracy. 
 
 
 
 
6.   Iftaar Dinner:  In addition to the public outreach, the 
CG hosted the third annual Itaar dinner on November 12.  The 
Secretary General of the Nigerian Supreme Consul for Islamic 
 
SIPDIS 
Affairs observed that each dinner has been better and more 
relaxed than the last.  (Comment: Indeed, the first CG 
hosted dinners were a bit stilted with invitees wondering 
about the sincerity of the invitation.  However, ongoing 
contacts with the Islamic community throughout the year has 
engendered a genuine spirit of shared interests.  End 
comment.) 
 
 
7.   Comment Continued:  After all of the media and Iftaar 
events, participants expressed a genuine desire for more 
outreach and more information about one another\'s policies 
and practices.  Post intends to host many more encounters 
with southern Nigeria\'s Islamic community throughout the 
year.

Classified By: J GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Nigeria\'s Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) 
has set November 14 as the deadline for investors to submit 
expressions of interest to be core investors (51 percent) in 
the country\'s four refineries.  Major U.S. oil companies tell 
us they are not interested. Labor is taking a cautionary 
position. END SUMMARY

--------- 
 
 
2. (U)  Signaling a continuation of President Obasanjo\'s 
promises to reform the Nigerian economy, particularly the 
petroleum sector, on October 28 the Bureau of Public 
Enterprises (BPE) issued an announcement that the federal 
government intends to divest 51 percent of its interest in 
the nation\'s four refineries.  The GON later announced that 
prospctive \"Core Investors\" were to submit expressions f 
interest by November 14.  A similar advertisemnt was placed 
in the Economist magazine. 
 
 
3.(C) At a monthly lunch meeting of major U.S. based 
companies doing business in Nigeria on November 6 the 
managing directors of ExxonMobil (upstream) Mobil Producing 
Nigeria (downstream), Texaco Nieria (downstream) and 
ConocoPhillips (upstream) xpressed their surprise at the 
announcement, and their reservations about the proposed 
refineries sale.  While reticent about sharing data, the 
downstream executives said their companies would not buy 
stakes in the refineries, although John Pototsky of Mobil 
said his company would consider a management contract. 
 
 
4. (SBU) Nigeria\'s refineries -- two at Port Harcourt and one 
at Warri and Kaduna respectively -- are notorious for 
breakdowns, turnaround and maintenance contracts that never 
end, and a lack of crude feedstock due to vandalism and 
disrepair of feeder pipelines.  Technically capable of 
processing 445,000 barrels of crude per day, the refineries 
rarely work above 40 percent capacity, and frequently Nigeria 
imports almost all of the fuel it consumes.   The management 
of the Kaduna refinery told visiting Embassy Abuja PolCouns 
and ECONOFF in September that nearly half of the Kaduna 
refinery was designed to use high-sulfur crude from Venezuela 
rather than Nigeria\'s Bonny Light, so as to be able to 
extract feed stock for fertilizer and bitumen for road repair 
and other civil engineering purposes.  NNPC has also imported 
high-sulfur Saudi crude to use that refining capacity at 
Kaduna, but until March of this year, Kaduna was operating at 
less than 50 percent  capacity, about 750,000 liters a day, 
largely because no high-sulfur crude had been imported since 
the middle 1990s.

Any Takers?

5. (C) The American oil and gas company executives said they 
knew of no major oil company interested in buying a majority 
share of the existing refineries.  In a meeting with 
Consulate staff in October, executives at ChevronTexaco 
(upstream) and Texaco Nigeria (downstream) also doubted if 
any credible international company would invest in the 
refineries, and added that of thefour, only the newest 
refinery at Port Harcourt had any potential for commercial 
viability.  A Chevron executive said GON officials admitted 
to him that the older plant in Port Harcourt and the refinery 
in Warri may need to close, and that the GON would be 
hard-pressed politically to make the same statement about the 
Kaduna plant, although closing it may be the best course of 
action.  At the November 6 lunch, Pototsky of Mobil averred 
that his company is not interested in the refineries not only 
because of their disrepair, but also because of environmental 
concerns.  He said the impact they have on the environment 
could make investment in them a \"dead-end issue for any U.S. 
company.\"  Jules Harvey of Texaco tacitly agreed with that 
assessment.  The two downstream captains of industry 
suggested Chinese or European bidders may be interested, but 
may not have the capital available to bring the refineries up 
to capacity. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Chief Uzodimma of Niger-Global told POLOFF and 
Econoff that his company has submitted an expression of 
interest in the refineries along with a U.S. partner. 
However, Uzodimma expressed concern that the process will 
become politicized, the result being refineries being sold to 
GON cronies with no real capacity to rebuild the ailing 
refining industry. 
 
 
7.  (C)  Austin Oniwon, a high-ranking NNPC official, told an 
Embassy Abuja Econoff in Abuja last week that former NNPC 
Group Managing Director Jackson Gaius-Obaseki and former 
Energy Advisor Rilwanu Lukman had advised President Obasanjo 
in mid-October that no company would buy the refineries in 
their present condition.  They then told him it was imprudent 
and foolish to attempt to sell the refineries before the 
end of the year.  According to Oniwon, Lukman explained to 
Obasanjo that no reputable company would buy the Kaduna or 
Warri refineries knowing that even under GON-ownership, the 
refineries, could not operate owing to sabotage and constant 
pipeline breaks.  Oniwon added that Vice President Atiku 
stated to Obasanjo during the same meeting that Lukman and 
Gaius-Obaseki were wrong and that the refineries could easily 
be sold by the end of the year.  Obasanjo, according to 
Oniwon, then said he too thought the refineries could be 
easily sold.  Oniwon went on that he and Gaius-Obaseki 
subsequently concluded that the Vice President and President 
did not want the refineries to work in the short-term because 
they wanted to pay off their cronies and supporters who are 
making millions of dollars by importing fuel into the 
country. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Labor has a Refined Approach 
----------------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) Recent newspaper accounts have alleged that the 
Petroleum & Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria 
(PENGASSAN), a white-collar union, will strike if Nigeria\'s 
refineries are privatized.  Ogbeifun Brown, National 
President of PENGASSAN, told POLOFF on November 7 that the 
newspapers are \"getting us wrong.\"  Brown stated that 
PENGASSAN supports the privatization of refineries if sold as 
the GON advertises, where NNPC will maintain 49% ownership 
and a private corporation have 51% ownership.  Brown stated 
that PENGASSAN would strike if the transaction were to be 
done without transparency and sold wholly to a private 
individual with no capital or experience in the oil industry. 
\"We have an open mind; it is the Government\'s decision and we 
can only suggest,\" said Brown.  He also asserted that there 
are many multinationals that can properly finance the project 
and have the expertise \"to do it right.\" 
 
 
9. (C) POLOFF quizzed Brown on the state of the nation\'s 
refineries.  Brown said that he has heard reports that the 
Warri refinery is having \"turn-around maintenance\" and should 
be operational by the first week of December.  He explained 
that the Kaduna refinery is not operational only because it 
has no crude to refine.  He bemoaned the state of the 
pipelines due to neglect and vandalism and identified their 
dilapidated condition as the source of Kaduna\'s problems. 
When asked if privatization would mean downsizing of the 
labor force, Brown said this would be a necessary step.  His 
concern is that the GON will not properly provide for 
displaced workers. PENGASSAN will thus demand that workers be 
provided with severance pay and guaranteed protection of 
their workers\' benefits and pensions, \"as it is done in 
civilized society.\"  Should these considerations be met, 
Brown believes downsizing will not be a contentious issue , 
and pointed to the successful mergers of AGIP/Unipetrol and 
Chevron/Texaco as models. 
 
 
10. (C) Brown expressed sober enthusiasm for Kupolokun as the 
new head of  NNPC and stressed that he is \"not a new hand, 
but a group executive and engineer in the system who rose 
through the ranks.\"  Brown stated that he is ready to work 
with Kupolokun.  \"He should be able to turn us around,\" he 
said, and foresees problems only if Kupolokun \"formulates 
policy independently and forces it down our throats.  But if 
he his ready to consult, he can bring us along.\"  In 
principle, PENGASSAN supports Kupolokun\'s policy to break up 
the NNPC\'s Pipelines and Products Marketing Company and sell 
parts of it individually.  However, Brown reiterated that \"we 
will not take dictation for one person\" and stressed the need 
for consultation. Brown demurred when asked if he believes 
Kupolokun will change NNPC\'s reputation of extreme 
corruption, saying that PENGASSAN has no position on the 
subject since it has no proof and will not make judgments 
based on supposition and rumors. 
 
 
11. (C) COMMENT. The downstream petroleum sector in Nigeria 
is undergoing a dramatic transformation with deregulation of 
retail marketing, even if privatization of the refineries 
exists only in policy and dialogue. Assessing the viability 
of the companies that BPE announces as potential core 
investors will be the first test of credibility of this 
exercise. The next will be how BPE and the Presidency handle 
the process. (Note. Both the President\'s Assistant on 
Privatization Matters and the new chief of NNPC have pledged 
stakeholder participation in the privatization process and a 
greater GON effort at public awareness.)  Finding capable 
willing investors remains the GON\'s greatest challenge to 
refinery privatization.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NATIONS WITHIN A NATION: A VISIT TO EDO AND ONDO 
STATES 
 
 
Classified By: CONSUL GENERAL ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AN 
 
 
D (D). 
 
 
1. (U) Summary. The impact of the ethnic diversity of 
Nigeria\'s close to 400 distinct ethnic groups on the 
country\'s politics and developing democracy was made clearer 
in a recent  visit to Edo and Ondo States.  Ondo State, is 
older by decades than its neighbor Edo and has regional 
governing experience.  It has gotten off to a good start 
under a newly elected administration that has plans to 
significantly increase agricultural production and lure back 
teachers.  By contrast, Edo State is only twelve years old. 
Although almost 100 per cent ethnic Edo, the new governor\'s 
election is still being challenged and he may yet lose his 
seat.  Edo has joined a recently formed group with the other 
Nigerian ethnic minorities and the group has indicated it 
will support the presidential aspirations of former military 
leader, Ibrahim Babangida.  Tony Anenih, former Minister, 
close advisor of President Obasanjo, and prominent son of Edo 
is still deeply and passionately involved in the State\'s 
politics and is maneuvering to get his son into the 
governor\'s chair in the 2007 elections. End summary. 
 
 
Background 
 
 
2. (U) Although most observers admit that Nigerian politics, 
tradition, history and culture are dominated by three major 
ethnic groups, Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, a recent study 
concludes that there are at least 389 distinct, indigenous 
ethnic groups in Nigeria.  As the nation moves toward 
democratic government, these groups are demanding more 
recognition and more control over their own affairs.  In the 
last elections, the predominantly-Yoruba and southwestern 
Alliance for Democracy (AD) party made an obvious 
ethnocentric move and declined to field a candidate against 
the Yoruba incumbent presidential candidate of the ruling 
Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).  Igbos in the southeast 
openly demanded that the Presidency should go to an ethnic 
Igbo.  A former Hausa military ruler from the mostly Muslim 
north publicly and privately urged Muslims to vote Muslim -- 
which would almost guarantee a Hausa President.  Looking to 
the 2007 elections, a group claiming to represent the other 
386 ethnic groups was formed this month in the capital Abuja. 
 The group, the Ethnic Minorities Movement of Nigeria (EMMN), 
adds another layer of unpredictability to the traditional 
Nigerian political struggle to form winning alliances among 
the southeast, southwest and the north, and EMMN has, at 
least initially, vowed to support a Hausa -- Ibrahim 
Babangida.  Ondo and Edo States are a microcosm of the ethnic 
diversity that is the problem and promise of Nigeria\'s past, 
present and, possibly, its future. 
 
 
Edo and Ondo 
 
 
3. (U) Edo and Ondo share a common border and are similar in 
some ways.  They are both southwestern States, with similar 
topography, bad roads and crumbling infrastructure.  Both 
claim to have the best educated populations with the highest 
number of PhDs and university professors.  Before  the 
development of the oil industry, the economies of both States 
were based on agriculture and forestry.  The differences 
between the two are, however, more striking.  Ondo has been a 
defined and recognized province, territory or State in 
Nigeria since 1915.  Its population of about 5 million is 
almost entirely Yoruba.  Ondo\'s southern border is coastline 
along the Bight of Benin and also includes a small part of a 
lower corner of the Niger River Delta.  This access to the 
sea allows a small fishing industry to operate, but, 
unfortunately, Ondo has no on- or off-shore oil.  Edo became 
a State only in 1991.  Its approximately 3 million residents 
are ethnic Edo who trace their roots back many centuries to 
the ancient Kingdom of Bini.  These people speak the Edo 
language and do not claim to be a sub-group of any other 
ethnic group.  Edo is poor in resources and landlocked. 
However, Benin City, where the internationally renowned 
ancient Benin Bronzes were created, is the capital of Edo and 
it draws a modest amount of visitors to the State. 
 
 
New administration in Ondo is off to a fast start 
 
 
4.  (U) PolOffs met with Ondo Speaker of the House of 
Assembly Victor A. Olabimtan on a one day familiarization 
visit to the State.  Ondo, like four of its neighboring 
States to the west, abandoned the AD and elected the full 
slate of PDP candidates, headed by Governor Chief Segun 
Agagu.  Olabimtan was eager to tell us what the new 
administration had accomplished in less than six months in 
office.  He started his prepared remarks by saying that Ondo 
is a \"peaceful\" State with the most highly educated 
population in the country.  \"We don\'t fight; we reason our 
way to solutions to our problems,\" he boasted.  He said the 
Agagu administration is concentrating  on the revival of the 
agricultural sector in Ondo, especially the production of 
cocoa.  The State has already hired consultants to study ways 
to increase rice production that used to be produced in the 
State in export level quantities.  Ondo is also launching 
several programs to lure people back to the agriculture-based 
rural towns.  Teachers who agree to work in these places will 
be given \"bush bonuses\" and even cars; people willing to farm 
in the areas will receive no-interest, \"community-based\" 
loans and equipment.  Development of bitumen mining is being 
pursued as another source of revenue and jobs for the State. 
The Speaker said that Ondo has the largest deposits of 
bitumen and that two companies, one Nigerian (Beecon) and the 
other Canadian (Naisan), have already received approval from 
the GON to start work. 
 
 
No more \"khaki boys\" 
 
 
5. (U) Turning to politics, Olabimtan thanked the USG for 
supporting Nigeria and for \"helping us to stabilize our 
democracy.\"  He continued, saying \"Democracy has come to 
stay.  We will have no more \'khaki boy\' rulers!\"  He 
expressed great interest in US visitor exchange programs for 
legislators and government administrators.  However, all is 
not sweetness and light in Ondo.  The State is having some of 
the same problems as several other States with challenges and 
protests from the losing parties in the 2003 elections.  The 
Ondo State chapter of the AD, calling the Agagu 
administration one of \"fiction, falsehood and visonless 
government,\" has challenged the Governor to tell voters why 
he has fired 30% of the civil servants appointed by the 
previous (AD) Governor and why it has not yet paid months of 
back pay to teachers.  Olabimtan said that the new 
administration had inherited financial and personnel problems 
from the previous government. 
 
 
Edo State motto: \"The heartbeat of the nation\" 
 
 
6. (U) Benin City, the capital of Edo State, looks no better 
nor worse than any other major Nigerian city with its bad 
roads, busy and crowded markets and streets, but it does have 
an entire street in the heart of the downtown area for makers 
and sellers of bronze and brass.  We met with Dr. Osagie 
Obayuwana, who is a lawyer and the gubernatorial candidate of 
the National Conscience Party (NCP) in the 2003 elections, 
and Esosa Edosomwan, a professor of economics and NCP State 
Chairman.  Obayuwana, who received his law degree from 
Michigan State, claimed his party was the only credible 
opposition to the ruling PDP in Edo State. \"We are the party 
of revolutionaries,\" he declared.  He touched on a theme we 
have heard from political activists in other parts of the 
south, that Nigeria needs to overhaul its 1999 Constitution 
by calling a Sovereign National Conference.  \"Once the people 
have spoken (by referendum on a new Constitution) we can 
mobilize and move forward,\" he said.  According to Obayuwana, 
until the Constitution is amended to conform to the wishes of 
the people for more control and \"true federalism\", Nigeria\'s 
new democracy is unstable.  Edosomwan observed that the NCP 
was the party of liberals, progressives and welfarists.  He 
said pessimistically, \"Most Nigerians are ignorant of how 
government should work.  The NCP wants to energize the people 
because we can not keep waiting for our so-called leaders to 
change or to make changes.\"  Edosomwan said the NCP has a 
political enlightenment and education program that it plans 
to roll out in all of Nigeria after the new year -- if it can 
find funding.  He said that the Party was already working 
with some US organizations, notably the US Congressional 
Black Caucus, and was trying to get more help from 
Nigerian-Americans and other Nigerians in the diaspora. 
 
 
Anenih - The Fixer 
 
 
7. (U) Edo also has a continuing political imbroglio.  Tony 
Anenih, former Minister of Works and Housing, confidant of 
President Olusegun Obasanjo and nicknamed \"the Fixer\" by his 
political colleagues for his ability to work behind the 
scenes for Obasanjo, is also the longtime political 
\"godfather\" in Edo State.  Anenih and Chief Gabriel 
Igbinedion (father of the second term PDP Governor, Lucky 
Igbinedion) have been battling for control of politics in Edo 
since the State was created.  Matters heated up in October 
when the Igbinedion forces in the State Assembly impeached 
the Speaker of the House,  Friday Itulah, one of Anenih\'s 
godsons.  The media have reported that the fight is about who 
will be governor of Edo in 2007.  Anenih is said to be 
setting up the machinery and grooming one of his sons to get 
the position.  Igbinedion is said to prefer somebody else -- 
anybody else -- for the position.  Charges of duplicity and 
allegations of fraud, coercion, and favoritism have been 
flying among the two sides and various factions of the Edo 
group since the impeachment, but no one has taken any legal 
action.  The voters of Edo have four years to decide whether 
Anehih gets to keep his \"godfather\" title. 
 
 
Environmental rights are human rights 
 
 
8. (U) PolOffs had just time in a one day familiarization 
visit to meet with Godwin Uyi Ojo, Programmes Director for 
Environmental Rights Action/ Friends of the Earth, Nigeria 
(ERA).  ERA was formed in 1993 as an organization dedicated 
to the principle that \"All people shall have the right to a 
generally satisfactory environment favorable to their 
development.\"  The group now has offices in Benin, Bayelsa, 
Lagos and Port Harcourt.  The group is funded by 
contributions from private citizens in Nigeria and some 
foreign contributions.  It gets no funds from the GON.  Ojo 
is a political ecologist with degrees in environment and 
development, and social studies from England and the 
Netherlands.  He has a weekly environmental column in the 
Guardian newspaper and is the author of several books of 
poetry on the environmental struggle in Nigeria.  Ojo said 
ERA does not support a particular party but would support a 
party that was effective in furthering the goals of the 
group.  He said the group is not positive on the PDP\'s grasp 
of environmental issues and its apparent \"military mindset.\" 
As an example he cited that President Obasanjo had banned gas 
flaring in 1979.  Nothing was done up until 2002 when he 
banned it, again.  Suddenly, in 2003, all the oil and gas 
companies announced a 51 per cent reduction in flaring -- 
without any verifiable data to prove the reduction. 
 
 
9. (C)  ERA currently has a team of international 
environmental law specialists reviewing Nigeria\'s 
environmental laws and drafting a proposed new law that will 
focus on the human rights issue of a peoples\' right to 
control their natural resources.  In addition, they are 
following closely the development of tin mining in Jos and 
Edo States so that \"Mistakes that were made in the Delta (oil 
region) will not be made again.\"  Ojo said his organization 
supports the calls for a Sovereign National Conference 
because the 1999 Constitution does not protect peoples\' right 
to control their resources.  He added that the organization 
will lobby and press for national legislation that will 
assure the people are represented in all future environmental 
projects.  Lastly, he told us he was sad to see that the US 
had given an award to Chevron, a company that, he said, \"had 
hired military gunboats to kill people.\" 
 
 
10. (C)  Comment.  Not much has changed in the southwest 
since the April and May elections.  Even some of the names of 
the players are the same.  It is a hopeful sign, however, 
that though many thought the last elections were rife with 
fraud and they are being doggedly challenged in the Elections 
Tribunals, for the most part Nigeria got through the 
elections without the violence or military intervention that 
had marred previous elections, and both winners and losers 
are actively preparing and positioning for the next round in 
2007.

1. (C) SUMMARY. At the monthly Businessman\'s Lunch held at 
the American Guest Quarters pub in Lagos on November 6, 
executives of two major fuel marketing companies confirmed 
that the sector is essentially deregulated, and that there is 
no significant threat of mass action by organized labor (ref 
A).  They noted that the industry must have regular access to 
dollars to pay for their fuel imports, and suggested that 
changes are needed to the Nigerian Dutch Auction System (DAS) 
for currency exchange in order to handle the volume of 
exchange the marketers require monthly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
----------------------- 
THE RECENTLY OLD SYSTEM 
----------------------- 
 
 
2. (SBU) Until October 2003, Nigeria\'s downstream petroleum 
sector had been closely regulated and controlled by the GON 
(ref B).  Retail sellers faced both price ceilings on all 
refined products as well as profit margin caps and \"bridging\" 
fees collected ostensibly to help move fuel to the north from 
southern refineries and from the port of Lagos.  Nigeria\'s 
four refineries have never worked at full capacity, and their 
production has never met domestic demand.  Thus, even as 
Nigeria became the world\'s seventh largest exporter of crude 
oil, it found itself importing much, if not most, of its 
refined fuel needs through private marketers and the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). 
 
 
3. (SBU) As world market prices for fuels increased in recent 
years, private marketers eventually stopped importing fuel 
because they could not sell it profitably given GON price 
ceilings.  By 2002, NNPC was essentially the sole importer of 
fuels to Nigeria.  (Note: Depending on the state of the 
country\'s refineries, imports generally account for 60 to 100 
percent of domestic fuel supply. NNPC benefited from GON 
subsidies as it imported fuel at market prices but sold it to 
private marketers wholesale and to consumers through several 
retail outlets at the artificially low price caps.  When its 
refineries worked, the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) was also allowed to buy oil from Nigeria\'s 
crude production at prices far below market.  This 
two-pronged NNPC subsidy was said to cost the GON some two 
billion dollars annually.  In late June 2003, the GON raised 
the price ceiling (effectively raising the price) of gasoline 
to 40 naira per liter from 26.  A nationwide protest strike 
that resulted in scattered violence and several deaths 
effectively shut down the country for eight days.  A 
compromise was reached setting the price for gasoline at 34 
naira per liter. 
 
 
--------------------------- 
THE ARRIVAL OF DEREGULATION 
--------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) This system changed dramatically when President 
Obasanjo deregulated the downstream sector by pronouncement 
on October 1, 2003 (ref C).  Although private marketers 
believed Obasanjo had promised them that all price caps would 
be lifted and prices would be market driven from that day 
forward, the NNPC maintained its selling price at the 
previously imposed ceiling.  Consumers became confused 
overnight, as private fuel stations began charging 40 naira 
per liter or more for gasoline, while NNPC stations kept 
their price at 34.  Panic buying soon escalated tension and 
black market prices, and fuel queues began snaking from 
stations once again.  When confronted by angry accusations 
from an array of fronts that he had unilaterally raised fuel 
prices for the second time in six months, Obasanjo replied 
that any increase in fuel prices was not his doing.  He 
insisted that he had merely deregulated the downstream 
sector; retailers were now setting prices. This left private 
marketers politically exposed, and gave the Nigerian Labor 
Congress (NLC) a vehicle from which to rally.  The NLC 
denounced both Obasanjo for failing to consult civil society 
before making such a significant change to government policy 
and operations, and the fuel marketers for taking advantage 
of the common man for the sake of profits. 
 
 
5. (SBU) The country was headed for another nationwide work 
stoppage when an agreement to avert the strike was reached 
late on October 8 (refs D, E). But the agreement unraveled 
almost as soon as it was reported (ref F).  The unions 
insisted that marketers agreed to keep prices at 34 naira per 
liter for at least one month while a Stakeholders Committee 
was formed and would meet to discuss and manage deregulation. 
 Marketers maintain they did not agree to continue selling at 
the previous price cap.  They say they tacitly agreed that 
prices would likely remain at 34 naira until the first 
shipment of fuel imported by marketers hit the Lagos port. 
(Marketers  maintain that the lowest viable price for 
gasoline is  currently 40 naira per liter.)  The marketers 
claim union officials misjudged how long it would take the 
first industry shipment of gasoline to arrive; while unions 
believed it would be at least four weeks, Unipetrol had 
already placed an order for two shipments relying on the 
President\'s pledge to deregulate, and those shipments were 
underway as the strike deal was reached.  Subsequently, just 
days after the supposed \"agreement,\" prices again jumped 
overnight.  NLC leaders claimed they had been duped, and some 
union elements began targeting private dealers for pickets, 
protests and even violence.  In the confusion some dealers 
closed, inciting passions even further as consumers had even 
less fuel available to them and opportunists and 
black-marketers took advantage of the supply crunch. 
 
 
6. (SBU) Most marketers rolled back their prices quietly to 
avoid confrontation, but as the stalemate dragged on and the 
federal government appeared intransigent, the NLC\'s pressure 
and sway on the issue began to weaken and fade.  By the end 
of October, most union leaders admitted they retained too 
little momentum to call the strike back on. The Stakeholders 
Committee met but accomplished little, and Obasanjo took 
other shots at the NLC via legislation to curtail it\'s power 
(ref G).  Meanwhile, marketers continued to import fuel, and 
NNPC itself shifted to market prices.  By the third week of 
October, fuel queues in Lagos all but vanished, and the 
average cost of gasoline now hovers around 39 to 42 naira per 
liter.  As had been the case even when the GON imposed a 
price cap, fuel prices in regions outside of urban centers 
vary, as supply to bush regions and to the north is spotty. 
(Note: domestic disturbances also affect fuel availability. 
For example, Econoff noted on November 13 and 14 that long 
and testy fuel queues stretched throughout the southern city 
of Port Harcourt.  Earlier in the week, demonstrations and 
violent clashes sparked by the murder of a traditional ruling 
chief blocked the road between the city and the nearest fuel 
depot, causing a supply crunch by Thursday, and a run on 
re-opened stations on Friday.) 
 
 
------------------------------------ 
DEREGULATED, BUT WATCHED AND PRODDED 
------------------------------------ 
 
 
7. (C) At the Businessman\'s Lunch on November 6, John 
Pototsky, Managing Director of Mobil Nigeria, and Jules 
Harvey, Vice President for West Africa of Texaco 
International, said the marketers have been told by GON 
officials at the NNPC, the Department of Petroleum Resources 
(DPR) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Authority 
(PPPRA) that while the downstream sector is operating in a 
deregulated environment, the agencies do not want to see 
widely varying prices around the country and between 
retailers.  Pototsky said the industry has been warned, 
\"don\'t cause chaos with prices.\"  He said there seems to be a 
regional split forming within the ranks of decision makers 
and regulators, with northern government officials winning 
dominating policy decisions these days.  Some have called for 
price fixing and the continuation of the Petroleum 
Equilisation Fund (PEF), which is essentially a tax on sales 
to pay marketers for costs associated with transporting fuel 
from the Lagos port to the north (known as \"bridging\"). 
 
 
8. (C) Pototsky also noted that the GON seems focused only on 
gasoline prices; officials ignore what the retailers charge 
for diesel or kerosene, which are the fuels primarily used by 
industry and businesses.  The same can be said for organized 
labor.  From the outset of the deregulation effort, all 
attention has been on the price of gasoline.  Even the 
agreement reached on October 8 accepted that kerosene and 
diesel prices would immediately rise to market rates.  (Note: 
Because of Nigeria\'s inadequate power grid, almost all 
businesses use generators to supply backup or primary power, 
adding a significant cost to doing business here.  Nigeria\'s 
stagnant textile industry has linked deregulation to an 
effect on production by publicly claiming some 50,000 jobs 
may be lost due to the increased cost of running textile 
mills after a rise in NNPC\'s \"black oil\" price and an alleged 
diversion of industry fuel allotments.) 
 
 
9. (U) Meanwhile, the DPR has issued new guidelines and 
directives for marketers on issues including import 
licensing, quality control and safe transportation of 
products. 
 
 
----------------- 
PLENTY OF FUEL... 
----------------- 
10. (C) Mobil\'s Pototsky and Texaco\'s Harvey indicated that 
the industry is fully engaged in fuel importation.  Pototsky 
was quoted in the press as saying his company anticipated 
importing 13.4 million liters of gasoline in three shipments 
by mid-November. (Note: Pototsky and Harvey noted that most 
gasoline imported to Nigeria is unleaded -- now the most 
common gasoline available on world markets -- even though 
vehicles here are generally equipped for leaded fuel.  There 
has been discussion in recent months among African leaders 
that countries should convert to unleaded gasoline in the 
near future, but Pototsky said retailers here cannot market 
their gasoline as \"unleaded\" because it often becomes blended 
with NNPC fuel of varying grades when stored in tanks.) 
 
 
11. (C) In a separate conversation with Econoff, an 
ExxonMobil official stated that the downstream industry is 
now trying to import as much fuel as possible, in effect 
\"flooding the market.\"  He said the marketers are doing so 
primarily to ensure a steady supply of fuel nationwide.  He 
said that in this time of tense transition to a market-based 
fuel sector, they do not want to give the unions or any other 
detractor the opportunity to claim that in spite of 
deregulation -- or perhaps because of it -- not only has the 
price of gasoline risen, but the country still faces 
shortages.  Thus, according to the ExxonMobil official, the 
goal of the marketers for the near term is to flood the 
market with fuel, and get it distributed nationwide.  Along 
with trying to ensure stable supply and prices, the industry 
has turned to public outreach to win consumers to the side of 
deregulation; new radio jingles paid for by the marketers 
extol the benefits of deregulation. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
...BUT HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT? 
---------------------------- 
 
 
12. (C) The marketer\'s new problem, according to Pototsky, is 
getting enough foreign currency to pay for the fuel 
shipments.  Businesses in Nigeria can acquire dollars twice 
weekly through Nigeria\'s Dutch Auction System (DAS).  Each 
Monday and Wednesday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) 
announces the amount of dollars it will be auctioning. 
Companies seeking dollars then post a bid via an authorized 
bank.  They specify what amount they seek, at what rate they 
will exchange naira for that amount, and for what purpose 
they seek the dollars.  An amount of naira equivalent to 
their bid must be available in their bank at the time the bid 
is made.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays the CBN announces the 
winning bids, and immediately deducts the equivalent naira 
from the current accounts of the banks representing the 
winning bidders.  The CBN then transfers dollars into the 
correspondent bank accounts of the winning bidders.  Any 
dollars not used must be returned to the CBN within five days 
to be exchanged for naira at the rate the dollars were 
purchased. 
 
 
13. (C) According to Pototsky, when the President deregulated 
the downstream sector in a relatively sudden manner last 
month, his administration did not anticipate the need of the 
marketers to obtain dollars to pay for fuel imports. 
Pototsky said that when NNPC pays for an imported shipment, 
it uses dollars it obtained from crude oil sales kept in 
accounts outside of the DAS.  He told Econoff that marketers 
now need approximately $120 - $150 million per month to pay 
for their fuel shipments, and are obliged to obtain dollars 
only through the DAS.  He said they found themselves outbid 
at several DAS auctions in October, and realized further that 
their bids could equal up to 35 percent of the dollars sold 
at any given auction.  On November 12 Pototsky told Econoff 
that while the CBN sold enough dollars to Mobil in the 
November 5th auction to cover its outstanding invoices, he is 
not certain how Unipetrol fared. (Unipetrol was the first 
marketer to import fuel after deregulation took effect.) 
 
 
14. (U) (Note: The CBN uses the DAS to control the exchange 
rate, so the amount of dollars it supplies at each auction 
varies, and the supply relative to the demand can vary 
widely.  For example, the CBN managed to keep the DAS 
marginal exchange rate at 135.55 naira to the dollar on both 
November 3 and November 5.  However, the amount of dollars 
sold ($103 million and 331 million respectively) accounted 
for 82 percent of the demand on November 5 (bids totaled $403 
million), and only 30 percent on November 3 (bids totaled 
$351 million).  On November 10, bidders requested $217 
million, and the CBN sold $183 million, or roughly 85 percent 
of demand, maintaining the exchange rate at 135.52 naira to 
the dollar.) 
 
 
15. (C) Pototsky told Econoff that marketers want the GON to 
create a separate allocation of dollars available for fuel 
purchases, or allow for advance funding of fuel purchases. 
Pototsky also said that he and other marketers are worried 
that under the current system, they will either not obtain 
dollars in time to pay their fuel invoices, or the large 
volume of their bids at any given auction will \"decimate\" the 
DAS.  The marketers\' bids for dollars might create spikes in 
demand and, if successful, edge out other industries for 
access to the limited amount of foreign currency allowed by 
the CBN at each auction.  The new managing director of 
Citibank Nigeria told Econoff that another option the 
marketers may pursue is to press the GON to allow the 
companies to buy dollars as an industry block through a 
\"syndicated import letter of credit,\" rather than 
individually through the DAS as they do now.  That option may 
become more important in the future if companies choose to 
order shipments jointly; currently, each company orders its 
own fuel shipments and sells some of it (in naira) to the 
others when a shipment arrives in port.  (As Mobil\'s Pototsky 
told Econoff, \"We\'re tough competitors when it comes to 
selling product and services throughout Nigeria, but we 
shouldn\'t compete bitterly just to get the product here. 
That could really blow out the market.\") 
 
 
-------------------------- 
THOUGHTS ON NEW NNPC CHIEF 
-------------------------- 
 
 
16. (C) At the Businessman\'s Luncheon, Pototsky and Harvey 
praised the new group managing director of NNPC, Funso 
Kupolokun, for his decision to attend a marketers\' meeting 
the day after his appointment was announced (ref H) to 
reassure the industry of the President\'s resolve to 
deregulate and reform the downstream sector.  Both men agreed 
that Kupolokun has been accessible in the past and 
understands the industry well.  However, Bob Smith, MD of 
ConocoPhillips (upstream), cautioned that Kupolokun may be 
too \"hands on\" and not delegate enough decision-making, 
making the organization more bureaucratic and lethargic. 
Most oilmen at the table agreed that there is a risk of 
stagnation within NNPC for the short-term; managers and 
supervisors may be afraid to act on requests and applications 
until they get a clear impression of the new GMD\'s 
intentions, goals, likes and dislikes.  For his part, 
Kupolokun has publicly stated that he plans a comprehensive 
review of the organization, and will eliminate unnecessary 
positions and ineffective workers. 
 
 
 
 
17. (C) COMMENT: While it seems deregulation of the 
downstream sector has taken root, critical issues remain 
outstanding that might cause significant strain on the 
system. We will watch for continued complaints from unions 
and northerners regarding prices, and for attempts by 
government officials from the north to institutionalize 
temporary or holdover pricing schemes used to bridge the 
supply chain as in the past.  NNPC\'s Kupolokun will continue 
to press for reform, but a backlash is possible from those 
who benefited financially from the inefficiencies of the old 
system, and from managers within NNPC ranks he may try to 
sack along the way.  The link between currency exchange rates 
and the availability of dollars for the marketers to pay for 
their imports may have an impact on marketers\' ordering 
decisions, and possibly on the valuation of the naira.  And 
implementation of the GON\'s announced intention to finally 
repair and privatize the country\'s refineries could affect 
both the volume and price of products and the relative 
strength of the players involved in the entire downstream 
sector. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: EXPAT OIL WORKERS KIDNAPPED IN NIGER DELTA -- MORE 
TO COME? 
 
 
Classified By: J GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
 
1. (SBU) On Thursday, November 27, seven expatriates were 
kidnapped in Nigeria\'s Niger Delta region. One has escaped or 
has been released.  No American citizens appear to be 
involved. 
 
 
2. (CO) The seven expatriate employees of the Canadian 
pipe-coating company Bredero Shaw were kidnapped off a boat 
near Warri (they reportedly hail from Britain, Australia, 
Russia and possibly Brazil and/or Colombia).  An oil company 
security manager reported that the kidnappers are Ijaw, who 
released one hostage.  On November 28, Econoff was informed 
of the kidnapping by Frank Omare, Special Assistant to the 
Governor of Delta State, where Warri is located.  Omare is 
one of several new special assistants of Ijaw ethnicity 
Governor James Ibori appointed to assist the Delta State 
Security Council react to violence in the Warri region. (Some 
speculate that Ibori has made Ijaw appointments to his circle 
of advisors as a way to increasingly factionalize the various 
Ijaw militant groups.)  Omare noted one of the hostages 
escaped.  Omare told Econoff that the Nigerian Navy had 
\"seized suspected points\" along the waterways, but he could 
not elaborate on that statement at that moment.  He said he 
was on his way from Asaba to Warri to assist in the release 
of the remaining hostages. 
 
 
3. (CO) Also on November 28, Dudley McDaniel, Operational 
Manager for Chevron\'s Escravos oil terminal and tank farm, 
told Econoff that he was informed that the kidnappings took 
place as the workers were practicing a water evacuation drill 
from their Warri facilities. Mcaniel said one of the 
kidnapped crew escaped on Friday, November 28, and reported 
that the victims were hooded and transported to an unknown 
location by boat, and that the trip took approximately two 
hours.  McDaniels also said the Navy and other elements of 
Operation Restore Hope have stepped up patrols and were 
taking steps to intercede in the kidnappings. 
 
 
4. (CO) This event highlights a sudden upsurge in kidnappings 
in the Delta region during the month of November (septel). 
This week, a Halliburton security manager sent an inquiry to 
the general security community asking for corroboration of a 
report that criminal elements in the swamp regions are 
planning multiple actions across the Delta during the 
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) scheduled 
for the first week of December in Abuja.  The report, 
considered credible by the source, indicated that the goal of 
the actions would be to shut down all oil production from the 
Delta during the CHOGM, which is to be highlighted by a visit 
from the Queen of England. 
 
 
5. (CO) Chevron\'s McDaniel told Econoff that he was aware of 
no specific threat as described above.  He did say that 
perhaps in preparation for the CHOGM activities, the Nigerian 
Navy has been conducting exercises in and around the 
Escravos/Warri area this week.  He noted an impressive 
display and use of three former buoy tenders given the GON by 
the USG earlier this year, and that the Navy used a Chevron 
floating rig to practice assaults and hostage release 
scenarios.  He said the troops appeared well organized and 
capable. 
 
 
6. (CO) COMMENT:  We have no corroboration of the report that 
mass action will take place in the Delta in conjunction with 
CHOGM.  The Delta \"criminal elements\" are factionalized among 
ethnic groups and even within ethnic groups.  The region is 
plagued by simple bandits and robbers, illegal oil bunkerers 
and pirates, whose financial and political interests differ 
greatly, making it difficult to foresee an organized attempt 
at massive disruption.  However, it is possible that an Ijaw 
umbrella group could spread the word that it is encouraging 
action of some kind during the CHOGM, thus leading to 
several, if not many, independent incidents of banditry, 
vandalism and/or kidnapping.  This would pose a far more 
difficult scenario for the GON -- or the instigators -- to 
contain once under way.  END COMMENT.

TAGS: EFIS, ETRD, ECON, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIAN SHRIMPERS: HOPEFUL (BUT UNLIKELY) 
PLAYERS IN U.S. MARKETS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Nigeria\'s principal fisheries products, 
shrimp and prawns, are destined almost exclusively for 
export, but only a small percentage of Nigeria\'s total 
catch makes its way to U.S. markets.  Exports are 
hindered primarily by high shipping costs and consumer 
preferences.  Industry representatives say interest in 
expanding exports to U.S. markets is high, but unless 
conditions change, significant increases are unlikely. 
End summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Of all commercial fisheries in Nigeria, shrimp 
fisheries are by far the most lucrative.  With nearly 
three-quarters of the country\'s 250 vessels dedicated 
to shrimp trawling, Nigeria\'s fisheries produce shrimp 
and little else.  Trawlers with twelve- or thirteen- 
person crews spend as many as 50 consecutive days in 
the Niger Delta region, often many miles offshore, and 
return with hundreds of metric tons of processed and 
frozen shrimp.  Approximately ninety percent of the 
catch is exported, most of it to Europe, China and 
Japan.  Very little of it makes its way to U.S. 
markets. 
 
 
3. (U) Sam Azebeokhai and Robinson Omomia, President 
and Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Trawler Owners 
Association (NITOA), respectively, say several of the 
association\'s 45 member companies are looking for ways 
to expand exports to the United States.  Many purchase 
trawling vessels from U.S. manufacturers, and more than 
a few are interested in strengthening relationships 
with their U.S. counterparts. 
 
 
4. (U) The interest is there, but Nigerian shrimp 
producers find it difficult to export to U.S. markets, 
mostly because transportation is prohibitively 
expensive.  It is also scarce.  Since few if any ships 
sail directly between the U.S. and Nigeria, most 
exporters find it easier and more economical to send 
their catch elsewhere.  In just a few months, they will 
find it even easier to do so: NITOA expects to open a 
large-scale fisheries laboratory in Lagos in mid- 
January.  The facility was built with EU technical 
assistance and will streamline the certification of 
shrimp products\' compliance with international 
standards.  Azebeokhai and Omomia believe the 
laboratory will make European markets even more 
attractive to Nigerian shrimp producers. 
 
 
5. (U) Exports to U.S. markets are further hindered by 
consumer preferences for peeled shrimp with no heads. 
According to Manjit Sadarangani, Managing Director of 
Atlantic Shrimpers Limited, Nigeria\'s largest shrimp 
exporter, the preference leads to significant weight 
loss: up to 35 percent in some cases.  Nigerian shrimp 
exporters may be able to sell their products at a ten 
percent premium in U.S. markets, but they lose so much 
weight meeting consumers\' demands that they can make 
more money in Europe selling heavier products at 
slightly lower prices. 
 
 
6. (U) Comment: Nigerian shrimp producers looked 
briefly to AGOA to provide a cost-effective means of 
entering U.S. markets, but shrimp and prawns are 
excluded from AGOA trade preferences.  They are 
likewise excluded from GSP concessions, although they 
are free of duty, with the exception of shrimp and 
prawns containing meat products (these are subject to 
five percent ad valorem tariffs).  In the absence of 
duties, shipping costs and consumer preferences appear 
to be the biggest obstacles facing Nigerian shrimp 
exporters.  A further obstacle may be Nigeria\'s 
inadequate use of turtle excluder devices.  Shrimp 
producers are reluctant to use them, even though their 
non-compliance could lead to the exclusion of their 
products from U.S. markets.  At the moment, the absence 
of a large market leaves little incentive for 
compliance.  Unfortunately, unless Nigerian shrimp 
exporters partner with U.S. firms or overcome these 
barriers, significant inroads in U.S. markets are 
unlikely.  End comment.

REF: LAGOS 1705 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Two major players, MTN Nigeria 
Communications Limited and Econet Wireless Nigeria 
Limited, dominate Nigeria\'s mobile communications 
industry.  The latter has long played second fiddle to 
its much larger competitor, but Econet executives 
insist that with Vodacom Group\'s purchase of a 51 
percent stake in the company, its rival will soon be 
singing a different tune.  End summary. 
 
 
2. (U) Bolaji Balogun, Econet\'s Chief Marketing 
Officer, exudes enthusiasm.  Having been with Econet 
since the beginning (and having raised much of its 
financing), he is particularly attached to the company. 
He knows it inside and out, takes its successes and 
failures personally, and believes passionately in its 
potential to become Nigeria\'s leading mobile service 
provider.  The firm\'s subscriber base is still smaller 
than its competitor\'s (Econet has some 860,000 
customers compared to MTN\'s 1.5 million), but the 
company has been building network capacity non-stop for 
the last six months, and its services now cover 45 
(compared to MTN\'s 50) major cities.  If coverage 
expands and subscriptions increase, MTN\'s dominance may 
soon be a thing of the past. 
 
 
3. (U) Balogun has every reason to be optimistic. 
South Africa\'s Vodacom Group has just agreed in 
principle to a $230 million purchase of 51 percent of 
Econet\'s shares, and Balogun expects Vodacom to provide 
access to $200 million of additional financing.  With a 
steady supply of funds (perhaps supplemented by an 
International Finance Corporation line of credit), 
Econet\'s chronic money problems will be much less 
pressing.  And with sufficient financing, the firm will 
be able to pursue its expansion plans with 
unprecedented energy.  Balogun expects the two 
companies to sign the deal (and Econet to change its 
name to Vodacom) in mid-December.  After that, he says, 
MTN\'s days as Nigeria\'s leading mobile service provider 
will be limited.  With characteristic enthusiasm, 
Balogun predicts his firm\'s subscriber base will exceed 
MTN\'s by December 2004. 
 
 
4. (U) Balogun\'s optimism is further fueled by his and 
industry observers\' belief that Econet\'s network 
quality surpasses that of its major competitor.  Its 
backbone is capable of carrying more traffic with 
relatively fewer dropped calls, and Balogun expects its 
edge over MTN to increase significantly as the firm 
expands its network.  That edge will be enhanced by 
Econet\'s flexibility and responsiveness to consumer 
demands.  The firm has beaten its major competitor on 
more than one occasion: it was the first to introduce 
global system for mobile communications (GSM) services, 
and it was the first to introduce per-second billing 
and lower tariffs, something Nigerian consumers have 
long demanded. 
 
 
5. (U) Comment: If Vodacom\'s entry into the Nigerian 
telecommunications market creates the waves Balogun 
expects it to, his firm could very well surpass MTN to 
become the country\'s largest mobile service provider. 
The market is huge (Balogun expects the industry to 
have 10 million customers by 2010), and serious 
competitors are few and far between.  The highly 
anticipated September 29 entry of Globacom, the 
country\'s second national operator, was disappointing 
(the firm has only 100,000 customers, is reportedly 
losing them, and failed to offer the low prices and 
better than average service consumers expected), and 
industry observers say it is having trouble raising the 
financing it needs to continue building its network. 
The national carrier\'s mobile subsidiary, M-TEL, is no 
more a threat to the industry\'s major players than it 
ever was, and neither it nor any of Nigeria\'s private 
telephone operators show signs of capturing significant 
market share.  If Balogun\'s expectations prove 
accurate, Econet/Vodacom may not be playing second 
fiddle much longer.  End comment.

REF: (A) LAGOS 2363 (B) LAGOS 2330 
 
 
1.  (U) SUMMARY:    The United Action for Democracy 
(UAD) held a rally in the Yaba district of Lagos on 
December 3 to protest President Obasanjo\'s policies and 
governance, as well as the Commonwealth Heads of 
Government Meeting (CHOGM) taking place December 5-8 in 
Abuja.  Mobile Police (MOPOL) arrested six persons, 
including UAD leader Bamidele Aturu, and reportedly 
beat several others.  Journalists were allegedly 
assaulted; and one news agency had its equipment and 
film taken and its reporters were briefly detained. 
The protestors remain in custody at the State Criminal 
Investigation Department at Panti in Yaba.  UAD 
attorneys have requested their release on bail and 
hoped to appear at their possible arraignment December 
4.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
-------------- 
THE YABA RALLY 
-------------- 
 
 
2.  (U) Press reports indicate that over 100 MOPOL, 
armed with batons and AK-47s, had assembled at 0400 on 
December 3 at the Yaba Bus Stop in anticipation of the 
rally held later that day.  UAD demonstrators 
reportedly numbered 1,000 and were soon joined by a few 
thousand more street traders from the nearby Yaba 
market.  After the rally reached Liberation Square in 
Yaba, UAD leader Aturu chastised Obasanjo for 
squandering the nation\'s wealth, pointing to the 
example of Obasanjo\'s importation of bulletproof 
Mercedes, reportedly worth 400 million USD, while the 
rest of Nigerians live in abject poverty.  \"Obasanjo 
believes the support of foreign governments will make 
him survive, but the Nigerian people will disgrace him 
before his masters,\" Aturu allegedly said referring to 
the CHOGM.  During Aturu\'s speech in the square, MOPOL 
used tear gas to disperse the crowd and allegedly began 
beating demonstrators with batons and gun butts.  MOPOL 
also assaulted a television crew from Minaj 
Broadcasting International, confiscated its equipment 
and film, and briefly detained the crew.  Another one 
from Galaxy Television reported being beaten, but was 
able to keep its film footage.  Human rights groups 
reported minor injuries among the protestors. 
 
 
3.  (U) In a December 3 press release, the Civil 
Liberties Organisation (CLO) listed the following 
detainees, in addition to Aturu: Adebowale Balogun, 
President of the Yoruba Revolutionary Movement, 
Chairperson of the Yoruba Democratic Front, and a party 
leader of the National Conscience Party (NCP); Kamilu 
Mustapha of the Youth Democratic Front; Daga Tola and 
Joseph Anua of the Democratic Socialist Movement; and 
Joel Emerole of the Democratic Alternative.  CLO claims 
that their detention is illegal and infringes on their 
constitutional rights of freedom of expression and 
assembly.  The Nigerian Police assert that the 
protestors are being detained for not obtaining a 
permit for the rally.  As of December 5, the detainees 
had yet to be arraigned. 
 
 
-------------------------------- 
TENSIONS LEADING UP TO THE RALLY 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
4.  (U) The UAD, one of the lead organizations behind 
the November strike threat over fuel deregulation, has 
been agitating for the past several weeks and widely 
publicized its intended rally (ref A).  The UAD asserts 
that in response to its vocal opposition of Obasanjo\'s 
policies and its calls for his impeachment, the State 
Security Service (SSS) has been harassing the group. 
The CLO, which shares offices with UAD, reported that 
SSS personnel visited the UAD secretariat on November 
28 and issued \"threats of clampdown,\" intimidated UAD 
officials, and has been surveilling UAD members. 
Newspapers have also reported that the Director of the 
SSS has listed UAD as a \"group perceived as a threat to 
national peace.\"  Alluding to the December 2 release of 
the Human Rights Watch report alleging human rights 
abuses by the Obasanjo government -- including torture, 
intimidation, extra-judicial killings, and quelling of 
public dissent in the press and society at large - the 
CLO asserted that the violent dispersal of the rally 
and the activities of the SSS \"are increasing evidence 
of the Obasanjo Government\'s attempts to stifle freedom 
of expression.\" 
5.  (SBU) COMMENT: There is no doubt that there is much 
discontent among the populace.  Abject poverty, endemic 
corruption, and the lack of accountability of the 
federal, state, and local governments are issues 
enflaming discontent.  Civil Society has been 
vocalizing Nigerians\' dissatisfaction with the 
Government more audibly ever since the July strikes 
over fuel deregulation.  Although Obasanjo successfully 
prevented another strike over fuel deregulation in 
November that would have coincided with the All-Africa 
Games, Bamidele Aturu and his like-minded colleagues 
continue to carry the torch of civil disobedience and 
public outcry, no matter how dim the flame (ref B). 
Their apparent defeat in November may have impeded 
their efforts, but the rally seems to have motivated 
Civil Society to continue agitating against the GON. 
Nevertheless it has not yet generated broad support 
amongst the body politic.  END COMMENT.

and Ambassador Jeter told British High Commissioner Philip 
Thomas that 
President Obasanjo had been  very agitated over the issue of 
the Bakassi 
Peninsula in a meeting earlier in that day (septel).  The 
Ambassador noted that 
Nigeria might be willing to fight over Bakassi if the 
International Court of Justice(ICJ) judgement goes against 
Nigeria\'s interests. President Obasanjo may need outside 
mediation to avoid being pushed towards military 
intervention, and to foster dialog with 
Cameroon, preferably before the ICJ ruling is announced.  A/S 
Kansteiner 
observed that the new French Foreign Minister is very 
interested in Africa and 
could be an asset in joining the US and UK in sending a 
strong and unified 
message to Nigeria and Cameroon.  Specifically, the message 
would be that a 
military response by either side to the Court\'s decision 
would be 
internationally unacceptable and would be catastrophic for 
Nigeria\'s image, reputation and leadership in Africa. 
 
 
 
 
2. The High Commissioner remarked that in his previous 
conversations with the 
Nigerian President, Obasanjo had indicated a willingness to 
abide by the ICJ\'s decision, although he appears to have told 
French President Chirac that the Army might not swallow a 
verdict against Nigeria.   The High Commissioner pointed out 
that Cameroon\'s military capability does not match 
Nigeria\'s  which could cause Nigeria to do something 
stupid.  The Ambassador replied that while Nigeria\'s 
military would take casualties in an encounter, they would 
eventually overwhelm the Cameroonian military.  He noted that 
national pride and Presidential egos were factors in the 
building tensions.  Nigeria is already publicly accusing 
Cameroon of mistreating Nigerian citizens who constitute 90 
percent of the population in the Peninsula and, the 
Ambassador observed, there are already unconfirmed reports 
that Nigeria might do something pre-emptive. 
 
 
3. Thomas turned to the broader problem of Nigeria\'s 
difficult economic 
situation and lack of institutional political strength that 
could lead to a 
power grab before the 2003 elections. He said that former 
President Babangida 
is a wild card in the political game.  Furthermore, it is 
still unclear if 
the Obasanjo-Abubakar ticket will survive and, if it does 
not, who else might emerge as alternatives. The High 
Commisioner agreed that there are no quick fixes to ensure 
Nigeria\'s democracy and the country is too important to walk 
away from. 
 
 
4. Thomas fully endorsed the idea of holding a bilateral 
meeting on Nigeria in London during October and suggested 
that the World Bank and perhaps the EU be included along with 
representatives from the Department of State, the FCO and 
Number 10.  Ambassador Jeter recommended including 
representation by Canada. The Ambassador proposed that DFID 
and USAID meet on one day while political meetings take place 
simultaneously; a second day could be devoted to a joint 
political/economic/assistance session on Nigeria. 
 
 
5. The High Commissioner strongly agreed with the Assistant 
Secretary\'s views that the shared goal of both the US and the 
 
SIPDIS 
U.K. is the preservation of civilian rule in Nigeria and a 
peaceful election in 2003.  The alternative -- implosion in 
Nigeria  -- would be an enormous humanitarian tragedy. 
 
 
6.  Comment: The concerns expressed in the meeting over 
saber-rattling between Nigeria and Cameroon were underlined 
in the July 28 issue of the widely read Sunday Vanguard 
newspaper.  An article expressed fear that Cameroonian 
authorities have something up their sleeves and are deploying 
their troops close to the border with Nigeria.  The article 
goes on to assure the reader that Nigeria has taken steps to 
\"have as many men on the ground in case of any surprise act 
of aggression by Cameroon.\"  End Comment. 
 
 
7. Assistant Secretary Kansteiner did not clear this cable 
before his 
departure.

SUBJECT: FUTURE OF NIGERIAN OIL & GAS 
 
1. Cable is sensitive but unclassified.   Please protect 
accordingly. 
 
 
2.(SBU)  Summary: On July 11 and 12, Econoffs met with a 
variety of oil producing and servicing companies to gain 
insight into the current state of the Nigerian oil and gas 
industry and assess the country\'s potential contribution to 
world oil supply over the next ten years.  Companies 
expressed very positive views on future exploration and 
production opportunities, highlighting their new investments 
in deep water and natural gas projects.  Oil companies 
unanimously agreed they could meet the GON\'s ambitious 
target of 40 billion barrels of reserves and 4 million 
barrels/day of production by 2010. While all believe Nigeria 
has the capacity to contribute a larger share of world 
supply, actual production will depend on OPEC quota 
restraints and the country\'s ability to ttract investment. 
End Summary. 
 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Companies Look to DeepWater 
------------------------------------- 
 
 
.(SBU) In a series of meetings with ChevronTexaco,Conoco, 
ExxonMobil, Shell, and Halliburton repreentatives,  Econoffs 
received a detailed view ofthe Nigerian oil and gas sector, 
especially the ompanies\' plans to seriously increase 
production. In order to speak more freely, the 
representatives asked that they not be identified directly. 
Most of the increase in production will come from deep water 
blocks, which are areas with water depths between 500-1500 
meters.  All companies expressed great enthusiasm over the 
future production possibilities of these blocks.  Wells 
drilled from the first round of deep water licenses, awarded 
in 1993, are scheduled to begin producing next year.  The 
first of those fields, Shell\'s Bonga, could produce as much 
as 225,000 b/d at full operation.  The government recently 
completed agreements from the 2000 round of deep water 
licenses.  Companies believe deep water exploration in 
Nigeria has only just begun.  With more exploration and 
advances in technology, many more substantial discoveries 
could be made. 
 
 
---------------------- 
The Future of Gas 
---------------------- 
 
 
4.(SBU)  Encouraged by the government\'s ban on routine 
flaring by 2008, investment in the gas sector is on the rise. 
 Although the Nigerian economy is heavily dependent on oil 
today, gas could be the future.  According to a government 
study published last year, Nigeria has an estimated 182 
trillion standard cubic feet (tcf) of recoverable gas 
reserves. However, sources say the country could possess as 
much as 300 tcf. Currently the ninth largest source, some 
companies believe Nigeria could become the second or third 
largest producer as the industry develops and world demand 
for cleaner fuel increases. Currently, most of the gas will 
be exported to the European and American markets.  Companies 
also expect to supply gas to the West African Gas Pipeline 
once it is brought online. 
 
 
5.(SBU)  One potential short-term impediment to gas 
development is the absence of gas provisions in the 
Production Sharing Contracts (PSC), the contracts that govern 
the deep water projects.  At the moment, the contracts make 
no provision for who owns or has the right to develop the 
gas.  The government and the companies will have to negotiate 
a solution.  Failure to reach a timely compromise could 
hamper future operations. 
 
 
6.(SBU)  In the future, many believe that Nigeria, given the 
right conditions, could develop a very successful gas 
industry.  To encourage the process, oil companies suggest 
that the Nigerian government develop a national energy plan, 
including policies aimed at increasing domestic gas 
utilization.  Companies cited deregulation of the gas market, 
specifically market driven pricing, as a prerequisite to a 
successful market.  Companies would also like the government 
to create fiscal incentives for private investment in the 
sector. 
 
 
---------------------------- 
OPEC : Feeling the cut 
---------------------------- 
 
 
7.(SBU)  While capacity building investment continues, this 
year\'s OPEC cutbacks have not gone unnoticed in Nigeria. 
Even indigenous oil firms have been affected, unlike previous 
years when multi-national companies took most of the hit. 
During the cutbacks, companies are focusing on capacity 
building rather than production.  With billions of dollars 
being pumped into deepwater and gas projects companies could 
be, as one company representative stated,  \"on a collision 
course with OPEC\" if the quota levels remain unchanged. 
 
 
8.(SBU)  The question of where OPEC quotas will be allocated 
in the future is on the minds of all companies.  Some fear 
that the government will first allocate production to joint 
venture projects, not the deep water PSC blocks, because of 
the instant revenue benefit.  Under the joint venture 
arrangement, the government gets a share of oil revenue 
immediately unlike PSCs where the oil companies recover costs 
over time before sharing a portion of the profits. 
Substantial production cutbacks could have a very negative 
impact on the oil companies\' large and time sensitive deep 
water investments. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Impact of Community Issues on Production and Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
 
9.(SBU)  While investment in deep water and gas projects 
continues at full speed, companies continue to wrestle with 
the challenges that come with operating in Nigeria.  One of 
the most significant issues is community relations.  Even 
though the companies all expressed concern over the daily 
impact of community disturbances on operations, they all 
believed tht problems were manageable and would not 
significantly impact production levels over time. But even 
figuring in community interruptions to production (one 
company figured 40 percent of total capacity could be offline 
at any time), Nigeria\'s production future still looks 
robust. 
 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
The NNPC as a Business Partner 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
10.(SBU)  In addition to community issues, many 
representatives expressed frustration in their business 
dealings with the NNPC.  Even beginning a business venture 
with the government can be difficult.  One problem expressed 
was \"contract erosion,\" meaning that the NNPC has a 
tendency to change the rules of the game after contracts were 
signed.  Lack of transparency in awarding energy sector 
contracts was also cited as a serious problem. 
 
 
11.(SBU)  Once ventures begin, general bureaucratic delays 
over the course of a project have a significant impact. To go 
from winning the license to beginning production can be a 
long and frustrating process. Due to bureaucratic 
impediments, the first deep water wells will take 10 years to 
begin operations, an unusually long period of time according 
to company representatives. 
 
 
12.(SBU)  As for future relations, one company representative 
stated that the government does not have enough money to 
continue all planned projects.  This uncertainty creates a 
difficult investment climate. As of April 2002, the NNPC was 
$1.78 billion behind on its joint venture cash calls, the 
government\'s contribution to costs.  However, he stated that 
the private sector possesses the capital and the appetite to 
increase its share of investment.  Companies encouraged 
efforts by the USG to support a more stable investment 
climate in Nigeria. 
 
 
------------ 
Comment 
------------ 
 
 
13.(SBU)Comment:  All the oil companies we spoke with gave 
the picture of a very robust and expanding Nigerian energy 
sector. Despite the obstacles, companies appear undeterred by 
potential hurdles such as OPEC quotas, security problems in 
the Delta, and frustrating relations with the government. 
While investments in capacity building are in full swing, 
Nigeria\'s share of OPEC quotas seems too small given the 
level of current investment and the government\'s own targets 
for production. If Nigeria\'s quota share does not increase, 
companies could face difficulties recovering the cost of 
their current investments. 
 
 
14.(SBU)  Nigeria remains a committed member of OPEC, giving 
every indication they plan to remain within the OPEC fold. 
Rilwani Lukman, Obasanjo\'s oil advisor and current OPEC 
President, recently said that Nigeria would like to increase 
production but only if the move will not depress prices.   It 
remains to be seen what the government will do if the 
increase in Nigeria\'s production capacity does not translate 
into a greater share of OPEC quotas.  In all likelihood, 
Nigeria will remain with OPEC and fight for a larger quota 
share.  However, in the past Nigeria has frequently produced 
above its quota and could certainly do so again in the 
future.  End Comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, ECON, EWWT, ASEC, NI 
SUBJECT: THE LAGOS PORT COMPLEX: FAR FROM SECURE 
 
1. (U) Summary: Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and 
Customs officials report marked gaps in security at the 
Lagos port complex.  Access to the port is only 
nominally controlled, and electronic surveillance and 
tracking systems are non-existent.  Goods are 
statutorily subject to Nigeria\'s 100 percent inspection 
policy, but Customs officials ultimately see only a 
small proportion of total traffic.  The addition of new 
cargo scanning equipment may improve the situation, but 
a sea change in port security is unlikely.  End 
summary. 
 
 
2. (U) The Lagos port complex is the largest and 
busiest of Nigeria\'s several ports.  It handles 40 
percent of all traffic, and many consider it the 
gateway not only to Nigeria, but also to West Africa. 
It is one of the world\'s most expensive ports (second 
only to the port of New York) and one of its least 
efficient.  Exporters and importers alike face 
bureaucratic delays and administrative hurdles, wait 
unusually long for goods to clear customs, and contend 
with notoriously corrupt officials. 
 
 
3. (U) The NPA controls the port\'s physical security. 
Except for the side fronting the river, the entire 
complex is walled and topped with concertina wire. 
Personnel and trucks move through two or three main 
gates, each of which is supposedly subject to strict 
controls.  It appears, however, that traffic enters and 
leaves the port with little scrutiny: in a fifteen- 
minute period during Econoff\'s presence, not a single 
truck or person passing through one of the gates was 
stopped or questioned by officials.  The NPA recently 
issued photo ID cards to employees and port personnel, 
but demands that they display the cards are infrequent. 
Captain Stephen Koffi, Harbor Master at the Lagos port 
complex, says electronic monitoring and video 
surveillance systems are months (if not years) away. 
He laments the lack of sophisticated technology but 
says resources are limited. 
 
 
4. (U) Customs officials voice the same complaint. 
Funds are scarce, and with limited staff, the Nigeria 
Customs Service finds it impossible to conduct thorough 
physical inspections of all goods transiting the port. 
N. H. Angyu, Customs Area Controller at the Apapa area 
of the Lagos port complex, says exports are subject to 
a cursory inspection at the port gate (a statement that 
seems wholly inaccurate, as trucks are rarely stopped) 
and put through a more thorough inspection at the 
port\'s export bay.  Even then, it is highly unlikely 
that Customs officials inspect each and every item in 
each and every container.  Customs officials dispense 
with the 100 percent inspection policy for certain well- 
known exporters.  Instead, they conduct random checks, 
a practice that violates Nigerian law but fits with 
international practice.  Angyu hopes the early 2004 
introduction of container scanning equipment will 
improve inspections of imported goods, but the machines 
will not be used (at least not initially) for exports. 
These, unfortunately, will continue to undergo the 
usual physical inspections. 
 
 
5. (U) NPA and Customs officials nonetheless say 
security has improved over the last few months, mostly 
due to more stringent port access controls, but 
shippers and freight forwarders disagree.  One shipping 
company told Econoff that it loses five percent of its 
imports to pilferage.  People walk away with bags of 
rice, flour or cocoa, and NPA and Customs officials do 
nothing to stop them.  In many cases, the company says, 
port and Customs officials are part of the problem. 
The shipping company pays for its own security and is 
installing electronic surveillance systems, but a small 
percentage of its shipments continues to disappear. 
 
 
6. (U) Freight forwarders also recognize gaps in port 
security, and many say Customs officials are incapable 
of effectively tracking or inspecting shipments.  An 
executive at one of Nigeria\'s leading freight 
forwarders told Econoff that 50 percent of all imports 
are smuggled into the country.  He also claims that 90 
percent of Nigeria\'s non-oil exports are contraband. 
Hundreds of containers of putative furniture components 
are exported every month, he says, but these are often 
full of raw timber (an export prohibited under Nigerian 
law) bound for East Asia.  The Nigeria Customs Service, 
the executive asserts, is corrupt from the top down, 
and companies find it easy to under-declare shipments 
as long as they bribe appropriate officials. 
 
 
7. (U) Comment: If this is indeed the case, and if 
Customs officials depend on bribes to supplement their 
relatively meager salaries, it appears many officials 
will have an interest in maintaining the status quo. 
As such, new cargo scanning equipment may not be as 
effective as might be hoped (or operate as long as 
expected).  Furthermore, if funds remain scarce, 
security improvements will move forward only 
incrementally if at all.  NPA and Customs officials are 
surprisingly optimistic about meeting the 2004 deadline 
for the implementation of the International Ship and 
Port Security Standards, but unless political will 
increases and significant changes occur, meeting the 
deadline will be difficult, if not impossible.  End 
comment.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: On Friday, December 5, Itsekiri militants 
attacked Ijaws in boats and in villages on the Benin River, 
north of Warri.  There are reports of houses burned and 19 
persons killed.  Nigerian military forces reacted quickly, 
and although some related skirmishes were reported on 
Saturday, calm was restored Sunday.  Ijaw representatives 
tell us they intend no violence in turn, but tension in the 
Delta has been raised a notch in anticipation of a possible 
Ijaw retaliation. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (C) On Friday afternoon, December 5, Post received 
information from several sources that Itsekiri militants 
attacked Ijaws on the Benin River, northeast of Warri in the 
Niger Delta region.  Several days prior to these reports, the 
NGO IFESH, which receives financial support from the USG to 
conduct conflict resolution and skills training programs 
among all ethnic groups in the region, informed Mission 
personnel that it was working to avert a rumored Itsekiri 
raid on Ijaw-held villages.  Late in the afternoon on 
December 5, Lieutenant Colonel Dogo, Commanding Officer of 
the Nigerian Army\'s Seventh Battalion based in Warri, told 
Econoff that an attack had taken place, but that it was minor 
and limited to boats and villages along the Benin River. 
Col. Dogo said that forces from the Nigerian military joint 
task force, deployed to the area under the aegis Operation 
Restore Hope, swiftly interceded and ended the clashes. 
 
 
------------------ 
The Itsekiri Arise 
------------------ 
 
 
3. (C) The Itsekiri have thousands of internally displaced 
persons in the environs of Sapele, which sits on the Benin 
River north of Warri.  During the bloody clashes of March and 
April 2003, Ijaw are said to have raided Itsekiri villages 
along the Benin River, driving Itsekiri from the area and 
resettling the villages in place of the Itsekiris. During a 
visit to the region in October, displaced persons in Sapele 
told Poloff, Econoff and CRO of Ijaw raids, which, they 
claimed, resulted in dozens of deaths, razed homes and entire 
villages emptied of Itsekiri (ref A).  Mission staff also 
visited the town of Koko, which lies on the Benin River north 
of Sapele.  Itsekiri from Koko told Mission staff of a raid 
on that town that destroyed many homes and buildings, 
including the well-developed local government compound, and 
resulted in numerous deaths.  Destruction consistent with 
accounts of the raid remained visible, and the population of 
Itsekiri currently living in Koko is far below the town\'s 
structural capacity.  At the time of the Mission staff visit, 
Itsekiri of all stripes begged for assistance to return to 
their homes and rebuild their villages and fishing 
capabilities.  But they also insisted that if pushed much 
farther by the Ijaw, they would counter by whatever means 
necessary to stop what they consider to be a form of ethnic 
cleansing, in order to return to their home villages.  In 
October, several clashes between the Itsekiri and Ijaw 
prompted Chevron to review contingency plans for its 
facilities at Escravos, and security consultants onsite told 
us that the Itsekiri were planning for an eventual return to 
their homes (ref B). 
 
 
4. (C) On Monday, December 8, Econoff spoke with Kevin Drake, 
a security consultant with Control Risk Group, currently 
working at Chevron\'s Escravos oil terminal and tank farm 
Southwest of Warri.  Drake told Econoff that the attacks of 
December 5 took place in two locations, one near the village 
of Oye near the mouth of the Benin River, and the other near 
Koko.  Drake described the area around the mouth of the Benin 
River at the Gulf of Guinea as being Itsekiri lands.  He said 
the Ijaw, having previously replaced Itsekiri inhabitants in 
the region, control a small strip of swamp along the Benin 
River north of Oye, sandwiched between what has traditionally 
been Itsekiri communities.  He said on Friday, December 5, 
Itsekiri raiding parties from Oye attacked several Ijaw 
boats.  He was unclear as to the fate of the Ijaw, but he 
said the boats were later taken up river to Koko.  He noted 
that the initial Itsekiri attacks were against Gbaramatu 
clans of the Ijaw, but that Ijaw from the Egbema clan were 
later involved in skirmishes.  This is consistent with news 
reports indicating Itsekiri attacked several Ijaw villages 
along the Benin River, which would now be home to Egbema 
Ijaw.  News reports estimate up to 19 persons were killed. 
 
 
------------------------- 
Military Uses Helicopters 
------------------------- 
 
 
5. (C) During the time of the attacks, according to Drake, 
the crew of a Nigerian Joint Task Force helicopter flying 
along the Benin River spotted one or more Itsekiri speedboats 
with armed men on board.  Drake said the Task Force has 
previously made it clear it will not tolerate any speedboat 
activity on the rivers that appears to involve raids or 
illegal activity.  The helicopter crew buzzed the boat or 
boats, which caused the militants to divert their course, 
stand down, and take cover in the swamps.  Drake said that as 
far as he knows, no shots were fired from the helicopter. 
BBC radio reported on December 9 that military helicopters 
were used to buzz the areas around raided villages, and that 
automatic weapons were fired from helicopters into villages. 
The BBC reporter quoted Brigadier General Zamani, commanding 
officer of the Joint Task Force, as saying that his forces 
were using helicopters as a means to disperse clashing 
elements, and that shots may have been fired for that effect, 
although the reporter quoted other witnesses as suggesting 
the military had taken sides.  We have no confirmation of 
this report at this time. 
 
 
6. (C) Chevron\'s security consultant Drake told Econoff that 
skirmishes between the Itsekiri and Ijaw continued through 
Saturday, but by Sunday all was quiet.  He noted that 
statements in the press from Nigerian military commanders 
reporting robust deployment of forces through the riverine 
area were merely \"bullish, overblown propaganda,\" since, by 
his estimate, the military has little logistics capacity to 
deploy troops by boat in the region.  A print news report on 
December 8 suggested that a Navy vessel was taken by Ijaw 
militants and several naval crewmen held hostage.  We have no 
corroboration of that report, and one Ijaw leader denied to 
Poloff any knowledge of such an incident. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Clashes Limited to the Creeks 
----------------------------- 
 
 
7. (C) Drake told Econoff he is confident that at this time 
there is no threat against Chevron oil facilities in the 
Delta from this latest spate of ethnic clashes.  He said 
these attacks are strictly inter-ethnic land grabs and 
retaliatory strikes, and because this fight is for land along 
the Benin River, it should not threaten the company\'s 
facilities at Escravos.  Chevron has not yet returned to its 
other facilities in the swamps of the Niger Delta after most 
were closed due to vandalism and safety concerns in the wake 
of the larger unrest of March and April. 
 
 
----------------------------- 
Ijaw Promise Not to Retaliate 
----------------------------- 
 
 
8. (C) On December 8 and 9, Poloff spoke with several sources 
within the various Ijaw communities.  All stated that the 
current Ijaw position is defensive and that retaliations 
would only come if another attack is visited upon them.  Dan 
Ekpedibe, an Ijaw Youth leader and Secretary of the Federated 
Niger Delta Ijaw Communities (FNDIC), the organization 
believed responsible for starting the recent trend of 
kidnappings and extortion, corroborated the reports and 
stated that although the riverine areas are tense, Warri is 
relatively calm. When asked about the hijacking of a naval 
vessel and the hostage-taking of naval personnel, Ekpedibe 
stated he was not aware of the incident.  Joel Bisina, 
President of the Niger Delta Professionals for Development 
and moderate Ijaw, also discussed the river attacks with 
Poloff.  Bisina, who recently attended decision-making 
meetings with various groups of the Egbema clan of the Ijaws, 
confirmed the Egbema\'s decision to also stand down and take a 
defensive posture.  In response to the Itsekiri attacks, the 
Ijaws are attempting to meet with Delta State Governor James 
Ibori on December 9 to advocate for a political solution. 
The solution, however, is a repeated demand from the Ijaw to 
create more Local Government Areas in Ijaw territory. 
 
 
9. (C) COMMENT. While Ijaw representatives tell us they will 
not stage reprisal raids against the Itsekiri for last 
weekend\'s attacks, their forebearance is unlikely to be a 
lasting guarantee of peace between these ethnic groups. 
Their villages are scattered throughout the wild and 
complicated Niger Delta swamps and creeks, and coordination 
is difficult.  The Ijaw are more factionalized than the 
Itsekiri, with several leaders, groups and NGOs claiming to 
represent part or all of the Ijaw interest.  Governor Ibori 
of Delta State appointed several Ijaw as special advisors to 
his peace process, an effect of which has been to further 
instill a feeling of mistrust among the more militant 
factions of Ijaw clans. Both sides have weapons and threaten 
to use them to defend themselves and their interests.  Thus, 
the greatest danger in the Delta remains the possibility that 
a series of small skirmishes will spiral out of control, 
causing scores of deaths, massive dislocation of villagers, 
and possibly renewed attacks on oil installations in the 
region.  Nigerian military action remains a wild card.  The 
military response in the region since the build-up of 
Operation Restore Hope has been measured and relatively 
effective, and the Navy recently increased its presence in 
the deeper waters of the Delta (ref C).  However, given the 
brazenness in which illegal and violent activities have taken 
place recently, a heavy-handed military response with 
civilian casualties -- as was seen in recent years during 
other Nigerian internal conflicts -- still weighs on the 
minds of Delta watchers as a possible worst-case scenario.

REF: ABUJA 2085 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: ConGen Lagos officers observed the initial 
meeting of the Warri Forum on Peace, Security, and Human 
Rights organized by USG grantee Academic Associates 
PeaceWorks (AAPW) November 18-20 in the Delta State capital 
of Asaba (reftel).  Partially funded through USAID and DRL, 
the meeting centered on security and use of conflict 
management tools.  Senior representatives of the Nigerian 
Army, Navy, State Security Service (SSS), Police Force (NPF), 
and Delta State Government participated alongside Ijaw, 
Itsekiri, and Urhobo elders and youths.  The atmosphere was 
cordial and discussions were productive, drawing out candid 
comments from senior GON officials about their operational 
capabilities and personal feelings.  All participants 
identified weaknesses within themselves and other parties, 
including shortcomings of the GON, criminal activities of 
ethnic youths, and the squalid social conditions that fuel 
violence.  Fortunately, all parties brushed aside the locally 
rooted issues of the ethnic conflict to facilitate discussion 
and focus on the Forum\'s main themes. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
CLOSED LIPPED MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT? 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Nigerian Army was well represented. 
Brigadier-General (BG) Elias Zamani, Commanding Officer (CO) 
of the Joint Task Force (JTF), Operation Restore Hope, 
attended all sessions of the Forum.  He was accompanied by 
Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Goro Dogo, CO of the 7th Army 
Battalion in Warri; LTC Adamu Lanre, JTF Chief of Operations; 
and Captain (CPT) O.B. Ogunjimi, CO of the Delta Naval 
Station in Warri.  In response to ECONOFF\'s remarks about 
relaxing the curfew in Warri town and its appearance of being 
under control, BG Zamani pointedly quipped, \"No, let\'s not 
exaggerate.  I have no control.  I have the situation 
contained right now.  Containment is all I can hope for until 
we can pull out.  I\'ll never have control.\" 
 
3.  (SBU) Supporting BG Zamani\'s statement, LTC Dogo 
portrayed GON efforts as those of a \"fire-brigade,\" a 
characterization often repeated during the sessions by 
security men and Delta residents alike.  \"We need to go,\" he 
said, \"beyond control of crises to resolution.  Suppression 
by security forces is not enough and is not long term.\"  Dogo 
admitted that soldiers and police in the Delta have little 
outside support and when threatened by militant youths, \"my 
soldiers have the right to flee and protect their lives.\" 
Several participants, including other military and GON 
officials, shared Dogo\'s concerns, for they openly admitted 
that the militant youths are better armed and equipped than 
the JTF, which has little or no capability to project power 
despite the GON\'s recent acquisition of former U.S. Coast 
Guard buoy tenders.  In contrast, BG Zamani expressed concern 
about the international human rights community and its 
potential criticism of military actions against youths 
despite the youths having the upper hand.  NPF and SSS 
officials echoed this concern. 
 
----------------- 
THE LONE DEFENDER 
----------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) A. Amoo, SSS Director for Delta State, represented 
the agency at the Forum.  Amoo was the only GON official who 
vigorously tried to defend the GON and its policies.  Despite 
voicing support, Amoo identified unemployment, the 
mishandling of Delta State elections, federal supremacy, oil 
company failings, and communities claiming land based on 
family ties as the causes of the Warri conflict.  Amoo blamed 
the communities for \"disserving themselves\" and called on 
them to differentiate between problems that can be handled by 
the communities and those that should reach the federal 
level. Amoo railed against the media\'s use of \"yellow 
journalism,\" exaggerated and inaccurate reports, and accused 
the media of unprofessional and unethical practices that 
incite violence and enflame tensions. 
 
-------------- 
KEYSTONE COPS? 
-------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Charles Akaya, Commissioner of Police for Delta 
State, and his Assistant Commissioner, J.O. Abiona, also 
attended the Forum. Akaya called for community policing and 
requested information on criminals and criminal activity, 
saying that the police cannot act if they do not know what to 
act upon.  When Abiona asked the warring communities to share 
information if they want to \"stop the nonsense,\"  groans and 
murmurings of disagreement followed his remarks.  Akaya 
recommended creating a state police force, which might 
forever change the make-up of the centralized national 
police, believing this move necessary to \"secure the 
communities.\"  The Delta State Attorney General echoed 
Akaya\'s calls for a state police force.  (COMMENT: Putting 
the police under the jurisdiction of the states is anathema 
to the Federal Government.  END COMMENT.) 
 
6.  (SBU) Akaya also stated that piracy, hostage taking, and 
bunkering should be checked through community policing as 
well and stated that such policing should be legalized. 
(COMMENT: It is unclear whether he advocated vigilantism, as 
exhibited by the acts of groups like the O\'odua People\'s 
Congress and the Bakassi Boys who often commit human rights 
abuses, or a more traditional method of control through a 
local chief or oga (boss man).  At one point Akaya suggested 
that the problem with the vigilante Bakassi Boys was not that 
they exist as a sort of militia, but rather that they have 
been allowed to get out of hand.  END COMMENT.) 
 
7.  (SBU) Many other participants echoed the call for better 
law enforcement and prevention, including prosecution of 
known criminals and illegal bunkerers.  \"We know who the 
bunkerers are,\" cried an Ijaw youth, alluding to unnamed 
wealthy and influential individuals in Abuja, as well as 
unidentified international actors.  An Itsekiri youth added 
that crude stolen by youths is resold at substantially higher 
prices on the international market by these unnamed persons. 
 
---------------------- 
WARRING WARRI WARRIORS 
---------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) Participants of the three ethnic groups -- the 
Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo -- criticized the GON, the Delta 
State Government, and the oil companies for their plight. 
Participants claimed that there had been no economic 
development of any of the riverine areas of the Delta, 
whether by the Federal and State Governments or the oil 
companies before the first crisis erupted in 1997. An Ijaw 
remarked: \"The Federal Government doesn\'t treat Deltans as 
Nigerians, but as Ijaws, Itsekiris, and Urhobos,\" and drew a 
parallel to Rwanda pointing out that not until the crisis was 
out of control did anyone respond.  \"The U.N. would do a 
better job than the Federal Government in the Delta.\" 
\"People want a sense of belonging, a sense of being a part of 
a greater community,\" explained an Ijaw youth. 
 
9.  (SBU) An Itsekiri youth echoed that the communities\' 
biggest issues are underdevelopment and poverty. Decrying 
recourse to the \"fire brigade approach to conflict 
management,\" an Itsekiri elder criticized the GON\'s 
collection and distribution of oil revenues and stated that 
as long as the GON receives oil revenues, it will not deal 
with crises in the Delta.  If the GON received its funding 
through taxes, she said, the GON would address the crisis 
because it could not neglect the issues of the taxpayers.  An 
Ijaw youth voiced support, claiming that if oil revenues had 
no global or national impact, \"no one would pay any attention 
to us.  When Chevron\'s boats are hijacked, a query comes from 
on high.  When villages are burned and people are killed no 
one calls us.  The system is only interested when money is 
threatened.\" 
 
----------------------- 
MORE ON THE WARRI FORUM 
----------------------- 
 
10. (U) The Warri Forum on Peace, Security and Human Rights 
was developed by Academic Associates PeaceWorks, under the 
direction of long-time American resident in Nigeria Judith 
Burdin-Asuni. Ms. Asuni orchestrated an earlier forum in 
Warri during the 1999 crisis.  The Forum held in November in 
the Delta State capital of Asaba is part of a four-phase 
project, partially funded by USAID and DRL. 
 
11.  (SBU) COMMENT: The November AAPW Forum held the 
attention of all and established a record for the quality of 
the participation by senior GON officials, ethnic leaders, 
and youths who exercise influence within their communities. 
Contacts gained through the Warri Forum and other USG 
initiatives in the Delta have given ConGen Lagos personnel 
unprecedented access to the actors in the conflict.  Although 
the causes of ethnic conflict in the Delta are complicated 
and run deep, the Forum creates opportunities for 
decision-makers to engage in dialogue and cooperation. The 
next phase of the Forum, ongoing dialogue and attempts to 
address the root causes of conflict, will test the mettle of 
the participants and will give us an indication of how far 
the protagonists are willing to go for peace. Meanwhile, this 
program should receive continued support from the USG.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT: A POTENTIAL POWERHOUSE AMONG NIGERIAN PRIVATE 
TELEPHONE OPERATORS 
 
1. (U) Summary. Odua Telecommunicaions, a subsidiary 
of Nigeria\'s Odua Investment Group, is one of a handful 
of private telephone operators.  The firm won several 
3.5 GHz licenses in June 2002 and hopes to break new 
ground in Nigeria\'s southwest by introducing improved 
fixed wireless services.  If it succeeds, it will 
connect over a million customers to Nigeria\'s 
communications network and clinch a position as the 
country\'s largest fixed wireless operator.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) Odua has the potential to dominate the southwest 
region\'s telecommunications industry.  The firm won the 
right to provide fixed wireless services in three of 
Nigeria\'s southwestern states, Ekiti, Ondo and Osun, in 
June 2002 and acquired licenses to provide services in 
two more states, Ogun and Oyo, when the original 
licensees failed to pay a performance bond.  Odua has 
completed almost half of a microwave radio transmission 
backbone spanning the five states, and it hopes to 
finish work in March 2004, construct a complete loop by 
the end of the year, and begin expanding into Kwara and 
Kogi states shortly thereafter. 
 
3. (U) Given the firm\'s ambitious expansion plans, it 
is not surprising that Odua\'s Chief Technical Officer, 
Olusegun Owolabi, is an optimistic fellow.  Right now, 
he says, the firm has an installed capacity of 100,000 
lines.  Owolabi expects capacity to increase to 760,000 
lines by the time the first half of the network is 
finished, and he expects it to increase to 1.1 million 
lines by the time the loop is completed. 
 
4.  (U) If Owolabi\'s expectations are met, Odua will 
become Nigeria\'s largest fixed wireless operator.  With 
1.1 million lines, Odua\'s capacity will exceed that of 
the country\'s national operator, Nigeria 
Telecommunications Limited (which has only half a 
million fixed lines) and come close to matching that of 
the country\'s leading global system for mobile 
communications (GSM) provider, MTN Nigeria 
Communications Limited, which has 1.5 million 
subscribers.  Owolabi hopes the introduction of fixed 
wireless services will reduce traffic on Nigeria\'s over- 
subscribed GSM networks and improve the overall quality 
of communications, particularly through the 
introduction of an alternative to Nigeria\'s national 
operator. 
 
5. (U) Like other telecommunications firms, Odua has 
had to build its own backbone.  Much of its equipment 
is supplied by Harris Communications Systems Nigeria 
Limited, the local subsidiary of U.S.-based Harris 
Corporation, one of the world\'s leading providers of 
telecommunications equipment and services.  Odua works 
closely with Harris and other U.S. firms, and Owolabi 
expects the relationship to continue.  He also expects 
to draw on the relationship to expand into rural 
telephony.  In fact, Owolabi believes Odua\'s reliance 
on U.S. suppliers will improve the firm\'s chances of 
securing a $20 million U.S. Export-Import Bank loan to 
finance the construction of rural switches across 
Nigeria\'s southwest. 
 
6. (U) Owolabi plans, too, to implement a $5.4 million 
e-learning project through the University of Ibadan, 
once one of West Africa\'s premier universities.  Odua 
has agreed to supply 4,000 lines to the school, which 
ultimately hopes to work with Columbia, Johns Hopkins 
and Stanford Universities to provide online and video- 
conferenced courses to students.  If the school 
succeeds, it will be among the first Nigerian 
universities to introduce such technology. 
 
7. (U) Comment. Odua is one of only seven or eight 
functioning private telephone operators in Nigeria. 
Twenty-six firms won 3.5 GHz licenses in June 2002, but 
only a handful have begun operating.  As such, Odua\'s 
competition is limited.  If its introduction of fixed 
wireless services is successful, it can easily 
establish itself as one of the Nigerian 
telecommunications industry\'s major players.  It stands 
a chance of vastly improving access to communications 
services across the southwest, as well as of 
significantly expanding rural telephony and students\' 
access to advanced technology.  Given its reliance on 
U.S. suppliers, Odua may also open doors to U.S. 
businesses seeking to enter the Nigerian market.  Odua 
is a firm to be watched.  If it succeeds, other firms 
may follow its lead. End comment.

1. (C) SUMMARY: Barely 60 days after President Obasanjo 
declared Nigeria\'s downstream petroleum sector officially and 
completely deregulated, and 30 days after he replaced the 
head of the powerful national petroleum corporation, a GON 
regulatory agency shut down fuel stations of a US-based 
company and announced regional price caps on gasoline sales. 
A second pricing advisory authority more in line with the 
President\'s views is cautiously attempting to nullify the 
price caps, but marketers are wary of making any moves that 
will bring the wrath of regulators upon their gas stations. 
As organized labor threatens another mass action, this time 
over his privatization policies, the President is walking a 
fine line between placating unions and activists who seek 
relevance in a dissatisfied but largely unmotivated society, 
and his method of enacting government reform by executive 
fiat.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------- 
You Call this Deregulation? 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) A deregulated downstream petroleum sector had been 
chugging along since President Obasanjo suddenly did away 
with price-caps and other vestiges of government control on 
October 1 (ref A), shuffled his top petroleum advisors in 
early November, and replaced the head of the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation with someone seen as 
supportive of his deregulation policies (ref B).  However, 
efforts by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to 
re-impose price caps on the sale of gasoline have undercut 
the President\'s tough rhetoric, and have forced fuel 
marketers to second-guess the environment in which they 
believed they were doing business. 
 
3. (C) On December 8, the DPR announced publicly that it was 
imposing new price caps on gasoline sales in Nigeria. 
According to the DPR, Lagos retail prices are not to exceed 
41 naira per liter (Lagos market prices had been hovering 
between 39.90 and 42 naira per liter), Abuja prices are 
capped at 42.50 naira, and a ceiling range of 45 to 48 naira 
per liter is set for Nigeria\'s northern region. (As we have 
seen since deregulation began, attention is being paid only 
to the price of gasoline; other fuels, such as diesel and 
kerosene, which are important industrial and consumer 
products throughout Nigeria, are not affected (ref C).) 
DPR\'s latest action followed a series of advertisements taken 
out in Nigerian daily newspapers announcing price caps by 
state.  Meanwhile, according to John Pototsky, Managing 
Director of Mobil Producing Nigeria, the DPR closed some of 
the company\'s fuel stations and arrested the managers for 
charging what the agency felt were too high prices.  Mobil 
stations were closed for two weeks in the large, commercially 
busy city of Ibadan, north of Lagos.  The stations are now 
open, and Mobil is keeping its prices within the bounds set 
by DPR. 
 
4.  (C) Mobil\'s Pototsky told Econoff on December 13 that the 
council established by the President last summer to help 
usher in his deregulation scheme, the Petroleum Products 
Pricing Regulatory Authority (PPPRA), met with marketers 
several times in recent weeks and has assured them that, DPR 
actions and announcements notwithstanding, the downstream 
sector remains deregulated and retailers should feel free to 
charge market prices for their fuel products.  Pototsky added 
that now that he has his stations open again, he is not going 
to be the first to cross the line in the sand drawn by DPR. 
Should other marketers follow Pototsky\'s lead, de facto price 
caps will remain in effect across Nigeria, regardless of the 
PPPRA\'s assurances that the caps have been lifted, because 
marketers fear DPR more than they trust PPPRA. (This is not 
the first time Mobil has been targeted by deregulation foes; 
during the run-up to a nationwide strike in October (ref D), 
Mobil stations were specifically targeted for pickets and 
threats of violence by labor unions and enforcers sent to 
counter price increases (ref E).) 
 
------------------------------- 
Obasanjo Throwing Labor a Bone? 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) When asked where he thought the new Group Managing 
Director of NNPC, Funso Kupolokun, stood on the matter, 
Pototsky said Kupolokun will say and do whatever the 
President needs at any given moment.  Pototsky said the 
President is probably trying to throw some sort of bone to 
the unions by allowing the DPR to publicly state it is 
imposing price caps, while having PPPRA attempt to quietly 
soothe fuel marketers\' jitters by claiming the sector remains 
deregulated. 
 
6. (SBU) Unions and other civil society organizations have 
tried to use fuel price increases as a means to mobilize 
Nigerians to stand up against what they feel is a presidency 
acting unilaterally and undemocratically (refs F, G).  The 
activists lost steam after an aborted nationwide strike in 
October, but have been again calling for mass action 
beginning January 1, this time over disagreement with the way 
the President has handled the move to privatize the nation\'s 
chronically flagging oil refineries (ref H).  The petroleum 
industry unions have stated they have no objection to 
refinery privatization in principle, but believe the 
government is rushing the process, and the unions want proof 
that legitimate buyers with technical expertise will assume 
control of the refineries. 
 
7. (C) In what may be another attempt to assuage unions 
enough to keep them from striking on January 1, the President 
may meet with union leaders on December 17 to discuss the 
status of the privatization plan. Also, the Director General 
of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the agency 
overseeing GON parastatal privatization, was recently quoted 
as saying only institutional investors, rather than 
individuals, will be allowed to purchase controlling shares 
of public enterprises, and that no refineries will be sold 
yet this year (contrary to the GON\'s previous goal of selling 
at least one of the four by the end of 2003).  Mobil\'s 
Pototsky told Econoff he doubts the unions will actually 
begin a strike on New Year\'s Day, in part because so many 
Nigerians and expatriates living in Nigeria will be away from 
home for the holidays, which will reduce the number of 
available workers who might support a strike, and thus limit 
a strike\'s impact.  Pototsky surmised that if the unions 
manage to gain enough momentum to pull off a mass action, it 
will be during the second or third week of January at the 
earliest. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT: The DPR\'s moves to impose price caps, labor 
unions\' calls for a strike in opposition to the GON\'s 
refinery privatization plan, nd fuel supply chain problems 
(septel), all pose challenges to the President\'s deregulation 
plan.  If Obasanjo is allowing DPR to play on the sympathies 
of unions and civil society activists in hopes of buying him 
breathing room, his Administration will likely have to 
release at least some details of the letters of interest from 
potential partners wishing to buy control of the nation\'s 
refineries (due November 14).  But, if the GON ultimately 
appears to be placating traditional cronies through the 
refineries\' sales (ref H), the President may eventually find 
little wiggle room left in the face of mass action. 
Regardless of the likelihood of a strike, as Jules Harvey, 
Managing Director of Texaco, recently said at a business 
luncheon, \"This is only the beginning of a very long and 
complicated process of deregulation.\" END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: BIO ON WARRI NAVAL COMMANDER CAPTAIN O.B. OGUNJIMI 
 
REF: ABUJA NI 1445 
 
Classified By: J GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (S N/F) On November 19, Poloff and Econoff met Captain 
Olufemi B. Ogunjimi, Commanding Officer (CO) of Nigerian 
Naval Station Delta (NNS Delta), headquartered in Warri, 
Delta State, at a forum discussing peace and security in the 
Niger Delta. 
 
2. (S N/F) Septel provides further context and background to 
place this potentially up-and-coming officer in a political 
environment with examples of how things really work in his 
world.  He is interesting not simply because he is the CO of 
the Naval base at Warri, but rather, because he is willing to 
talk rather openly about how politics and money play into his 
job as a military officer. 
 
3. (S N/F) On December 10, the same ConGen officers met with 
Ogunjimi at a restaurant in Lagos for a discussion on the 
situation in the Delta. Dressed casually in a loose shirt and 
slacks, Capt. Ogunjimi, a boyish looking, reserved man, 
described his home of origin only as \"up there, far away from 
Lagos.\"  He noted he has a wife and children living on 
Victoria Island in Lagos, where he has kept a home for 16 
years, although he said he does not like the chaotic nature 
of the city. 
 
4. (S N/F) Ogunjimi told Poloff and Econoff that in the 
mid-1980s, as a Second Lieutenant based in Lagos, he 
conducted the first seizure in Nigeria of a vessel caught 
illegally bunkering oil.  Addressing a theme of  \"political 
reality\" he returned to throughout the conversation 
(septel), Ogunjimi said he was offered a bribe to release the 
vessel, which he claimed he turned over to his commanding 
officer.  Ogunjimi also said he quickly asked for a transfer 
when, on the day of the seizure, the men he arrested appeared 
at a restaurant in which he was eating and paid for his meal. 
 Ogunjimi said his transfer was approved, and added that the 
ship and crew were later released. 
 
5. (S N/F) As Commanding Officer of NNS Delta, Captain 
Ogunjimi said he commands a force of some 600 men, and 
reports to Rear Admiral Bob-Manuel, the Flag Officer 
Commanding (FOC) for the Western Naval Command (WNC) based in 
Apapa, Lagos.  Ogunjimi\'s command is a component of the 
Joint Task Force (JTF) Operation Restore Hope, established in 
August to coordinate military and security efforts in the 
Delta in response to violence between ethnic groups there and 
activities involving oil theft (reftel). Ogunjimi discussed 
with Mission officers his work over the last year, and the 
challenges he and his men face with what he described as 
inadequate equipment and limited resources.  He said the 
political pressures of working in the Delta are great, noting 
that he has learned to take vessels he seizes for illegal 
bunkering to Lagos, rather than to hold them at his base in 
Warri where pressure to release them is more direct.  He said 
that of the 10 ships he seized in eight months, two were 
ordered released by his superiors (septel). 
 
6. (S N/F) Ogunjimi said he approves of the Navy\'s policy of 
rotating Warri commanders in and out annually.  He says this 
practice should prevent them from becoming entrenched and 
corrupted by the political environment of the Delta, and will 
also keep them safe.  He half-jokingly referred to threats 
upon his life and said that for personal security he lives on 
the base when his family is not visiting (as do other JTF 
senior officers, he said). To maintain the appearance of 
impartiality and objectivity, the Captain said he does not 
make friends in the Warri community or spend much time there 
because to do so would immediately give rise to accusations 
of favoritism. 
 
7. (S N/F) Ogunjimi appeared satisfied with his performance 
at NNS Delta, but said he looks forward to his next posting 
as a Staff Officer at Naval Headquarters in Abuja.  He said 
his replacement, whom he did not name, should arrive at Warri 
on or about January 8. Ogunjimi will leave the post in 
mid-January. He said commanding the Warri base \"would be a 
beautiful job, if not for the politics.\" Nonetheless, he said 
he would rather not command a Naval base again. 
 
8. (S N/F) COMMENT: If we can take him at his word and 
demeanor, as well as his command\'s recent public record, 
Captain Ogunjimi seems to be an honest officer interested in 
preserving security and upholding the rule of law.  Ogunjimi 
is probably a man to watch as he makes his way toward higher 
ranks.  He said he should be eligible for promotion to 
commodore within four years, after his tour at Naval HQ and a 
stint at the Nigerian War College. He would likely remain a 
good contact of the Mission if called upon. END COMMENT.

December 1 with Femi Falana, former president of the 
Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) and 
well-known international human rights lawyer, to discuss the 
internal battle for power within the CDHR. CDHR executives 
have accused Falana and former CDHR president, Beko 
Ransome-Kuti, of hiring a faction of the vigilante group 
O\'odua People\'s Congress (OPC) to ransack CDHR\'s headquarters 
in mid-September.  That action sprang from problems allegedly 
centering on infighting among current and former organization 
leaders, a 300,00 USD grant from the Ford Foundation, and the 
personalities and political aspirations of Ransome-Kuti and 
Falana.  END SUMMARY.

Adams faction of the OPC ransacked CDHR\'s headquarters in 
Ikeja, Lagos.  In their wake, the OPC thugs destroyed office 
and audio/visual equipment, confiscated bank statements and 
other financial documents, damaged the interior of the 
building, and stole personal and organizational funds.  The 
attackers also beat a staff member about the head, sending 
him to the hospital for several days.  Police were called to 
quell the violence and arrested several OPC members.  CDHR 
secretariat members allege that Femi Falana was on hand to 
 
SIPDIS 
coordinate the release of the vigilante members.  Four OPC 
vigilantes returned to CDHR headquarters to stand guard until 
CDHR executives had them removed by the police.  In a press 
statement, CDHR\'s secretariat alleged that former CDHR 
presidents Ransome-Kuti and Falana had hired the OPC thugs to 
enforce the firing of the CDHR secretariat by a 
self-appointed Caretaker Committee composed of Ransome-Kuti 
and an associate. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CAN NIGERIA HAVE A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
3.  (SBU) CDHR has been embattled for some time, but 
dissension came to a head in May 2003.  On May 10, CDHR 
delegates from the various state branches met for their 
Annual General Conference (AGC) in Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti, Falana\'s 
home state.  The AGC attempted to elect three officers to 
two-year terms as provided in the organization\'s 
constitution.  The Lagos State branch, headed by Falana, sent 
40 delegates who were not AGC voting members, allegedly in an 
attempt to sway the election in his favor.  Falana\'s faction 
contested the re-election of the secretary-general and 
reportedly rioted at the conference, destroying property and 
harassing delegates, when it became apparent his candidate 
would not be elected.  The AGC immediately adjourned and 
reconvened May 31 in Benin City, Edo.  Similar events ensued 
and Falana\'s faction reportedly attempted to confiscate the 
ballot box.  Members of Falana\'s faction also assaulted 
delegates and allegedly poured acid on a CDHR member of the 
Edo State Branch.  Police were brought in to restore order. 
The second AGC was able, however, to elect the current 
secretary-general, president, and vice president of the 
 
SIPDIS 
organization. 
 
4.  (SBU) CDHR executives allege that Falana sought the 
assistance of Ransome-Kuti to contest the election. 
Ransome-Kuti had dissociated himself from CDHR in 1995 
because he was not allowed to run for re-election after seven 
years as the president.  In 2003 Ransom-Kuti returned and 
designated himself and an associate as members of a Caretaker 
Committee, deriving his authority from the \"inconclusive\" 
election outcome.  In this capacity, Ransome-Kuti attempted 
to run CDHR\'s activities and finances.  CDHR executives 
allege that on July 10 Ransome-Kuti led a group of 40 
militants to invade CDHR headquarters and hold a meeting of 
the Caretaker Committee.  Police came to disperse 
Ransome-Kuti and his supporters.  He tried again doing this 
on July 25 and September 5 and met the same response.  On 
September 6, officers from the Ikeja Division of the Nigeria 
Police Force reportedly cautioned Ransome-Kuti against 
further action and implored both parties to settle their 
disputes in civil court. 
 
5.  (SBU) In a recent meeting with POLOFF and Economic 
Counselor, Falana denied association with the violence 
surrounding the CDHR.  He stated that his linkage to the 
violence was \"an afterthought\" and proceeded to discuss the 
May conferences and place the blame on Ransome-Kuti.  Falana 
substantiated many of the CDHR executive\'s assertions in 
regards to the candidates he supported, but dissociated 
himself from the violent behavior of the Lagos State Branch 
members.  When asked by POLOFF if he saw irony in human 
rights activists\' assaulting members of a human rights 
organization, he shrugged his shoulders, gave a broad smile, 
and claimed that he was out of the country at the time. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
PECULIAR PERSONALITIES: BIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6. (SBU) Femi Falana acted as CDHR president from 1997 to 
2001.  He also served as vice president from 1995 to 1997. 
As a human rights lawyer, Falana has been active in many 
organizations.  He is the president of the National 
Association of Democratic Lawyers and is secretary-general of 
the African Bar Association.  He is now advocating for the 
GON to sign the protocols of the African Court of Human 
Rights and the African Court of Justice.  Falana is also 
trying to organize a West African Bar Association for ECOWAS 
countries.  Under the Abacha regime, he was often arrested 
for his outspokenness on human rights.  In 1995, Falana was 
one of the lead attorneys defending Ogoni environmentalist 
and playwright, Ken Saro Wiwa, and his eight Ogoni comrades. 
In recognition for his work, he received the 1996 American 
Bar Association\'s International Human Rights Award.  In 1999 
he was an Alliance for Democracy gubernatorial candidate for 
Ekiti State and again in 2003 under the National Conscience 
Party, but was unsuccessful both times.  CDHR executives have 
criticized Falana for attempting to use the CDHR to advance 
himself as a political candidate.  The organization claims to 
be non-partisan. 
 
7.  (SBU) Beko Ransome-Kuti, founding CDHR president from 
1989 to 1995, is a medical doctor.  He serves as executive 
director of the Centre for Constitutional Governance and is 
treasurer of the Fasheun faction of the OPC.  At CDHR\'s 
founding, Ransome-Kuti was also the organization\'s landlord, 
having provided it a building in Anthony Village, Lagos. 
When he was not elected president for an eighth year, 
Ransome-Kuti reportedly evicted CDHR from his premises 
without notice, stating that he had the right \"to vote the 
organization out of his property.\" 
 
-------------------- 
OPC - THE DARK HORSE 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) The O\'odua People\'s Congress (OPC) is a Yoruba 
vigilante group that provides security through intimidation 
and extortion.  It, too, is fractured and cyclically in and 
out of favor with the police.  Modiu Abudu, a spokesman for 
the Fasheun faction of the OPC, told POLOFF that the CDHR 
executives had written a letter to the OPC requesting help to 
resolve the dispute.  The OPC held a meeting with the key 
personalities involved and Abudu remarked that it was not 
until he arrived at the meeting that he realized how many 
CDHR members were also OPC members.  Of the 22 members who 
attended, 19 were affiliated with the OPC.  \"I realized that 
we were having our own convention instead of the CDHR\'s,\" 
Abudu remarked.  Abudu confided that neither Falana nor 
members of the CDHR executive are OPC members.  However, in 
previous conversations with POLOFF, CDHR executives expressed 
affinity for the OPC and downplayed many of its human rights 
abuses that Post has documented in previous Human Rights 
Reports. 
 
9.  (SBU) COMMENT: CDHR is rife with intrigue and turmoil. 
Its battles with former presidents who have their own agendas 
reflect the larger society, which is not averse to violence 
as it strives to define itself by any means possible. 
Corruption and power positioning is widespread in Nigerian 
society, and this part of the human rights community is no 
exception.  The CDHR\'s unabashed use of and membership in the 
OPC is unfortunate since the OPC has been involved in mob 
violence and extra-judicial killings.  We advise that USG 
agencies rethink funding of CDHR programs until its internal 
disputes are resolved.  END COMMENT.

STATE PLEASE PASS TO USTR GLORIA BLUE 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, EFIN, EINV, ECON, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: 2004 NATIONAL TRADE ESTIMATE REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 310953 
 
1. (U) In response to reftel, Post is pleased to 
provide the following update to the 2003 National Trade 
Estimate Report.  The figures in paragraph 2 will be 
updated by USTR. 
 
------------- 
TRADE SUMMARY 
------------- 
 
2. (U) The U.S. trade deficit with Nigeria was $4.9 
billion in 2002, a decrease of $2.9 billion from $7.8 
billion in 2001.  U.S. goods exports in 2002 were $1.1 
billion, up 10.7 percent from the previous year. 
Corresponding U.S. imports from Nigeria were $6.0 
billion, down 32.0 percent from 2001.  Nigeria is the 
52nd largest export market for U.S. goods.  The flow of 
U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Nigeria in 2001 
was $1.5 billion, up from $1.2 million in 2000.  U.S. 
FDI in Nigeria is primarily concentrated in the 
petroleum sector. 
 
--------------- 
IMPORT POLICIES 
--------------- 
 
Tariffs 
 
3. (U) Tariffs provide the Nigerian government with its 
second largest source of revenue after oil exports.  In 
its last major tariff revision in March 2003, the 
Nigerian government cut duties on 230 tariff line items 
(mostly raw materials, base metals, and capital 
equipment) to as low as 2.5 percent, while raising them 
on 30 line items (largely plastic, rubber, and aluminum 
articles) to as high as 65 percent.  Most increases 
were relatively small.  The Nigerian government 
announced similar cuts and increases, often on the same 
items year-on-year, in 2000 and 2001 and will likely 
announce another round of tariff adjustments as part of 
its 2004 budget. 
 
4. (U) Frequent policy changes and uneven duty 
collection make importing difficult and expensive and 
create severe bottlenecks for commercial activities. 
The problem affects foreign and domestic investors 
alike and is aggravated by Nigeria\'s dependence on 
imported raw materials and finished goods.  Many 
leading importers resort to under-invoicing and 
smuggling to avoid paying full tariffs. 
 
Non-tariff Trade Barriers 
 
5. (U) The Nigerian government continues to violate WTO 
prohibitions against certain non-tariff trade barriers. 
Bans on a variety of items - sorghum, millet, wheat 
flour, cassava, frozen poultry, vegetable oil (in 
bulk), kaolin, gypsum, mosquito repellent coils, 
printed fabrics, used clothing, and bagged cement - 
continued into 2003.  A ban on used car imports also 
continued but was altered to prohibit the importation 
of vehicles more than eight (rather than five) years 
old.  Food products such as fruit juice in retail 
packs, pasta, biscuits, confectionery and chocolate 
products, canned beer, and bottled water were added to 
the list of banned items in 2003. 
 
Customs Barriers 
 
6. (U) Nigeria\'s ports continue to present major 
obstacles to trade.  Importers face inordinately long 
clearance procedures, high berthing and unloading 
costs, erratic application of customs regulations, and 
corruption.  The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) stepped 
up enforcement of its 100 percent physical inspection 
policy in 2001 in an attempt to reduce smuggling and 
under-valuation of imports, but officials admit they do 
not have the resources to inspect every incoming 
container.  The NCS operates a pre-shipment inspection 
regime under which contracted inspection companies at 
ports of origin issue inspection reports that their 
Nigerian counterparts use to indicate items shipped, 
their value, and applicable customs duties. 
 
7. (U) The NCS planned to abandon its pre-shipment 
inspection regime for 100 percent destination 
inspections in 2002 and 2003, but introduction was 
delayed when importers protested that NCS officials 
might use their positions as sole valuation authorities 
to extract unauthorized facilitation fees.  The 
Nigerian government now hopes to introduce destination 
inspections in early 2004, but NCS risk assessment and 
other databases are not fully operational. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
STANDARDS, TESTING, LABELING, AND CERTIFICATION 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
8. (U) Rules concerning sanitary and phytosanitary 
standards, testing, and labeling are relatively well 
defined, but bureaucratic hurdles slow the approval 
process.  Regardless of origin, all food, drug, 
cosmetic, and pesticide imports must be accompanied by 
certificates of analysis from manufacturers and 
appropriate national authorities, and specified animal 
products, plants, seeds, and soils must be accompanied 
by proper inspection certificates.  U.S. exporters may 
obtain these certificates from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture.  By law, items entering Nigeria must be 
labeled exclusively in the metric system.  Products 
with dual or multiple markings should be refused entry, 
but such items are often found in Nigerian markets. 
 
9. (U) High tariffs and erratic application of import 
and labeling regulations make importing high-value 
perishable products difficult.  Disputes among Nigerian 
agencies over the interpretation of regulations often 
cause delays, and frequent changes in Customs 
guidelines slow the movement of goods through Nigerian 
ports.  These setbacks often result in product 
deterioration and significant losses for perishable 
goods importers. 
 
10. (U) The National Agency for Food and Drug 
Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is charged with 
protecting Nigerian consumers from fraudulent or 
unhealthy products.  The agency recently targeted the 
illicit importation of counterfeit and expired 
pharmaceuticals for special attention, particularly 
when imports are from the Far East and South Asia. 
NAFDAC\'s severely limited capacity for carrying out 
inspection and testing contributes to an occasionally 
heavy-handed or arbitrary approach to regulatory 
enforcement, and the agency has occasionally challenged 
legitimate food imports. 
 
11. (U) U.S. products do not appear to be subject to 
extraordinary or discriminatory restrictions or 
regulations, but the widespread use of fraudulent 
documentation by non-U.S. exporters may put U.S. 
exporters at a competitive disadvantage.  When illicit, 
undocumented imports of particular products such as 
frozen poultry exceed legal imports, the fact of 
meeting stipulated Nigerian standards becomes 
irrelevant. 
 
---------------------- 
GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT 
---------------------- 
 
12. (U) The Obasanjo administration has made modest 
progress on its pledge to practice open and competitive 
bidding and contracting for government procurement and 
privatization.  The initial stages of the tendering 
process tend to be transparent and even-handed, but as 
tenders move through the decision-making process, they 
often become opaque.  Allegations by unsuccessful 
bidders of corrupt behavior by senior government 
officials and foreign companies are common, but they 
rarely provoke substantive reactions. 
 
13. (U) New procurement and contracting guidelines were 
issued in January 2001, and a due process office, the 
Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence Unit, was 
established.  The agency acts as a clearinghouse for 
government contracts and procurement and monitors the 
implementation of projects to ensure compliance with 
contract terms and budgetary restrictions. 
Procurements worth more than 50 million naira (about 
$380,000) are subject to full due process.  Foreign 
companies incorporated in Nigeria receive national 
treatment, and government tenders are published in 
local newspapers.  U.S. companies have won Nigerian 
government contracts in several sectors. 
 
---------------- 
EXPORT SUBSIDIES 
---------------- 
 
14. (U) The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) 
and the Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM) administer 
industrial export incentive programs that include tax 
concessions, export expansion grants, export 
development funds, capital assets depreciation 
allowances, and foreign currency retention programs. 
Funding constraints limit the effectiveness of these 
programs, and many people allege that only favored 
individuals and businesses benefit.  Aside from these 
limited incentive programs, Nigeria\'s non-oil export 
sector does not receive subsidies or other significant 
support from the government. 
 
15. (U) In an effort to attract investment in 
export-oriented industries, the Nigerian government 
established the Nigerian Export Processing Zone 
Authority (NEPZA) in 1992.  Of five zones established 
under NEPZA, only the Calabar and Bonny Island (Onne) 
export processing zones function.  NEPZA rules dictate 
that at least 75 percent of production in the zones 
must be exported, but lower export levels are 
reportedly tolerated.  The Nigerian government 
converted the Calabar export processing zone into a 
free trade zone in 2001, but it is unclear whether the 
new designation has improved its export performance. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) PROTECTION 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
16. (U) Nigeria is a member of the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) and a signatory to the 
Universal Copyright Convention (UCC), the Berne 
Convention, and the Paris Convention (Lisbon text). 
Legislation pending in the National Assembly may 
establish a legal framework for an IPR system compliant 
with WTO rules.  At the moment, Nigeria\'s IPR laws 
afford protection that complies with most WTO 
provisions. 
 
17. (U) Despite Nigeria\'s active participation in these 
conventions, its reasonably comprehensive IPR laws, and 
growing interest among individuals in seeing their 
intellectual property protected, piracy is rampant. 
Counterfeit pharmaceuticals, business and entertainment 
software, music and video recordings, and other 
consumer goods are sold openly throughout the country. 
 
18. (U) The Nigerian government\'s lack of institutional 
capacity to address IPR issues is a major constraint to 
enforcement.  Relevant Nigerian institutions suffer 
from low morale, poor training, and limited resources, 
and fraudulent alteration of IPR documentation is 
common.  Patent and trademark enforcement remains weak, 
and judicial procedures are slow and subject to 
corruption.  Companies rarely seek trademark or patent 
protection because they generally perceive Nigerian 
enforcement institutions as ineffective.  Nonetheless, 
recent government efforts to curtail IPR abuse have 
yielded results.  The Nigerian police, working closely 
with the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC), have 
raided enterprises producing and selling pirated 
software and videos, and a number of high-profile 
charges have been filed against IPR violators. 
Unfortunately, most raids appear to target small rather 
than large and well-connected pirates, and very few 
cases involving copyright, patent, or trademark 
infringement have been successfully prosecuted.  Most 
cases have been settled out of court, if at all. 
 
19. (U) Nigeria\'s broadcast regulations do not permit 
re-broadcasting or excerpting foreign programs unless 
the station has an affiliate relationship with a 
foreign broadcaster.  This regulation is generally 
respected, but some cable providers illegally transmit 
foreign programs.  The National Broadcasting Commission 
(NBC) monitors the industry and is responsible for 
punishing infractions. 
 
20. (U) IPR problems in Nigeria\'s film industry 
worsened dramatically following the Nigerian 
government\'s 1981 nationalization of the country\'s 
filmmaking and distribution enterprises as part of its 
campaign to \"indigenize\" the economy.  The legitimate 
film distribution market has yet to recover.  Almost no 
foreign feature films have been distributed in the 
country in the last two decades, movie theaters have 
ceased to operate, and the widespread pirating of 
foreign and domestic videos discourages the entry of 
licensed distributors. 
 
----------------- 
SERVICES BARRIERS 
----------------- 
 
21. (U) Foreign participation in the services sector is 
generally not restricted.  Regulations provide 100 
percent foreign access to service sectors, including 
banking, insurance, and securities.  Central Bank of 
Nigeria directives stipulate minimum levels of paid-in 
capital.  At least two foreign banks have initiated 
operations in Nigeria in recent years, and several 
Nigerian banks have received infusions of foreign 
capital. 
 
22. (U) Professional bodies in engineering, accounting, 
medicine and law define minimum professional 
requirements.  Nigeria imposes quotas on expatriate 
employment based on firms\' issued capital.  Quotas are 
especially strict in the oil and gas sector.  Oil 
companies must hire Nigerian workers unless they can 
demonstrate that particular positions require expertise 
not found in the local workforce.  Fields such as 
finance and human relations are almost exclusively 
reserved for Nigerian hires, but certain geosciences 
and management positions may be filled by expatriates 
with the approval of the National Petroleum Investment 
and Management Services (NAPIMS) agency.  Each oil 
company negotiates with NAPIMS for its expatriate 
worker allotment. 
 
 
 
------------------- 
INVESTMENT BARRIERS 
------------------- 
 
23. (U) Under the Nigerian Investment Promotion 
Commission (NIPC) Decree of 1995, Nigeria allows 100 
percent foreign ownership of firms outside the 
petroleum sector.  Investment in the petroleum sector 
is limited to existing joint ventures or 
production-sharing agreements.  Foreign investors may 
buy shares of any Nigerian firm except firms on a 
\"negative list\" (such as manufacturers of firearms and 
ammunition and military and paramilitary apparel). 
Foreign investors must register with the NIPC after 
incorporation under the Companies and Allied Matters 
Decree of 1990.  The Decree prohibits nationalization 
or expropriation of a foreign enterprise by the 
Nigerian government except in cases of national 
interest. 
 
24. (U) Despite efforts to improve the country\'s 
investment climate, disincentives to investing in 
Nigeria continue to plague foreign entrepreneurs. 
Potential investors must contend with high business 
taxes, confusing land ownership laws, arbitrary 
application of regulations, corruption, and extensive 
crime.  There is no tradition supporting the sanctity 
of contracts, and the court system for settling 
commercial disputes is weak and sometimes biased. 
Foreign oil companies are under pressure to increase 
procurement from indigenous firms.  NAPIMS has set a 
target of 40 percent local content for oil-related 
projects; how that is achieved - whether it is based on 
the value of the contract or the nature of the goods 
and services used and whether using a Nigerian partner 
or subcontractor is sufficient regardless of the origin 
of equipment or raw materials - remains nebulous and 
subject to negotiation on a project-by-project basis. 
 
25. (U) Nigerian government efforts to eliminate 
financial crimes such as money laundering and 
advance-fee fraud (or \"419 fraud\" after the relevant 
section of the Nigerian Criminal Code) have increased 
but been largely ineffective.  Fraud, theft, and 
extortion are rampant.  With the encouragement and 
cooperation of U.S. law enforcement agencies, more 
\"419\" perpetrators are being prosecuted by the Nigerian 
government. 
 
26. (U) International watchdog groups routinely rank 
Nigeria among the most corrupt countries in the world, 
but Nigeria is beginning to show signs of reversing 
decades of corruption and economic stagnation.  While 
sales of U.S. goods and services to public and private 
sector enterprises is not restricted, U.S. suppliers 
face endemic anticompetitive behavior.  Some U.S. 
exporters believe sales are lost when they refuse to 
engage in illicit or corrupt behavior.  Others say 
Nigerian businessmen and officials understand that U.S. 
firms must adhere to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
standards and ultimately believe these restrictions 
help minimize their exposure to corruption. 
Unfortunately, U.S. exports to Nigeria occasionally 
suffer from unfair trade practices by foreign 
competitors willing to accommodate requests for 
improper payments. 
 
------------------- 
ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
------------------- 
 
27. (U) The growth of electronic commerce and 
telecommunications in Nigeria, albeit from a low base, 
offers opportunities for the provision of U.S. products 
and services.  While there are no trade restrictions 
that discriminate against such U.S. products, high- 
technology industries suffer from the same constraints 
noted for other industries.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TALE OF TWO CONVENTIONS 
 
REF: LAGOS 2527 
 
1.  (U) The Alliance for Democracy (AD) party parted in two 
when opposing groups held separate national conventions in 
Lagos and Abuja last week.  Plagued by infighting and the 
controversial self-appointment as party chairman of Ahmed 
Adamu Abdulkadir, President Obasanjo\'s Special Advisor on 
Manufacturing and the Private Sector (reftel), the two 
conventions disowned each other and thus widened the divide 
between the Abuja- and Lagos-based party militants. 
Nigeria\'s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) 
did not attend either convention because it did not want to 
legitimize either group before likely court action, and thus 
neither faction is officially recognized. 
 
 
2.  (U) As expected, the Lagos convention elected former Osun 
State Governor Bisi Akande as National Chairman, and expelled 
Abdulkadir from the party for alleged anti-party activities. 
Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who was rumored to have 
bankrolled the Lagos convention, spoke to the delegates and 
reportedly vowed that the AD will be \"the rallying point for 
the realignment of the progressive forces...(to) lead Nigeria 
in a new direction.\" 
 
3.  (U) The Abuja convention elected former AD Senate leader 
Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa as National Chairman.  Although 
Akinfenwa stated he will reconcile the differences in the 
party, Abuja delegates expelled both former AD National 
Secretary and party leader in the House of Representatives

1. (S N/F) SUMMARY: Captain O.B. Ogunjimi, commander of the 
Naval base in the heart of Nigeria\'s oil-rich but troubled 
Delta region, recently described to ConGen Officers his 
experiences fighting oil thieves in the Delta.  According to 
Ogunjimi, corruption within his command is not as rampant as 
generally believed, the Nigerian Navy is effectively 
countering illegal bunkering, and security forces are 
pursuing oil theft \"cartels\" operating in the Delta.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S N/F) On December 10 in Lagos, ConGen Officers met with 
Captain Olufemi (\"Femi\") Ogunjimi, Commanding Officer (CO) of 
Nigerian Naval Station Delta (NNS Delta), headquartered in 
Warri, Delta State (ref A). It is widely held that past 
commanders of the Warri Naval base may have been complicit in 
illegal activities and given the job as a perk to personally 
profit from the posting, but Ogunjimi willingly discussed his 
tour of duty in command of Warri, and in particular, his 
efforts to combat illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta. 
 
---------------- 
Commanding Warri 
---------------- 
 
3. (S N/F) Captain Ogunjimi took command of NNS Delta in 
April 2003, just after the outbreak of ethnic violence that 
left scores dead and shut down 40 percent of Nigeria\'s crude 
oil output (ref B), and before President Obasanjo declared 
curbing oil theft, or illegal bunkering, a national priority. 
(In June 2003, after Shell Oil placed newspaper ads claiming 
it was losing 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to 
thieves (ref C), the Obasanjo Administration made action 
against illegal bunkering a cornerstone of its policy in the 
Delta.) Ogunjimi said he commands about 600 men at the NNS 
Delta, some 100 of whom are deployed at the Escravos oil 
terminal and tank farm operated by Chevron.  The most 
significant assets at his disposal are two 180-foot patrol 
vessels, which were formerly U.S. Coast Guard buoy tenders 
donated by the USG in 2003. (A third is based in Lagos.) 
Ogunjimi said these vessels generally patrol the littoral 
areas of the Delta, have small caliber automatic weapons 
mounted on deck, and carry a crew of 55, including sailors 
capable of engaging in interdiction and hostage rescue 
missions. Ogunjimi noted a complement of smaller vessels at 
his command, which he said are frequently in a state of 
disrepair. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Main Mission: Stop Illegal Bunkering 
------------------------------------ 
 
4. (S N/F) Captain Ogunjimi described his chief mission in 
the Delta: curbing illegal bunkering. Considered a known 
secret for years (ref D), in early summer 2003 government and 
 
SIPDIS 
oil company officials began talking openly about the problem, 
and estimates of the country\'s crude oil loss from theft 
ranged as high as 300,000 bpd. (Nigeria\'s crude production 
reached 2.2 million bpd in November 2003.)  Joint Task Force 
(JTF) Operation Restore Hope was called up in August to quell 
ongoing ethnic clashes and to curb the theft of oil (ref E). 
A Shell security official told Econoff that as of mid October 
the company\'s crude loss due to theft had been sharply 
reduced as a result of Operation Restore Hope, at times to as 
low as 40,000 bpd. 
 
----------------- 
Cartels and Mules 
----------------- 
 
5. (S N/F) Captain Ogunjimi likened illegal oil bunkering in 
Nigeria to the drug trade in countries like Colombia (ref F). 
He said cartels have formed in the Delta, and each has carved 
out a territory the others generally respect.  Ogunjimi\'s 
description of the typical bunkering operation is consistent 
with past reports (ref E).  According to the Captain, a 
tanker (\"mother ship\") anchors approximately 50 miles 
offshore during daylight to avoid being spotted by Navy 
coastal patrols.  Arrangements are made for villagers to tap 
into the Delta\'s vast network of pipelines, usually in the 
swamps, and fill small oil barges.  At nightfall the mother 
ship moves closer to shore, where the barges are pulled 
alongside and the crude is transferred, allowing the tanker 
to slip away without detection. 
 
6. (S N/F) Ogunjimi said that since his goal is to break 
these cartels, he has implemented night patrols to intercept 
illegal transfers of oil from barge to tanker.  Ogunjimi said 
he is not interested in pursuing the \"loaders\" of the crude 
-- usually young villagers who cannot resist the money 
offered to tap pipelines and fill barges. Ogunjimi estimated 
that 90 percent of Delta locals involved in illegal bunkering 
are Ijaw; the remaining 10 percent are a mix of other ethnic 
groups, including Yoruba and Igbo from outside the Warri area. 
 
7. (SBU) Note: Ijaw youth leaders told Mission staff in 
October that many of the villagers who are hired for illegal 
bunkering do not consider what they do a crime but rather a 
business.  According to the Ijaw leaders, this belief is 
supported by the fact that the villagers are hired by 
\"powerful men from Abuja\"; they have easy access to pipelines 
often with the complicity of oil company employees; and the 
security forces in the swamps are told -- or paid -- to look 
the other way. Last year, a pilot contracted to Chevron 
emphatically told CG that it is easy to spot illegal 
bunkering from small planes; what is lacking is the will to 
take action to stop it. End Note. 
 
------------------------------------ 
In Defense of His Mission and His Men 
------------------------------------- 
 
8. (S N/F) Captain Ogunjimi said many people in the public at 
large, the government, and even within the ranks of the Navy, 
do not understand the complexity of oil-related activities in 
the Delta.  According to him, their ignorance leads to wrong 
impressions of the Navy\'s effort in the region, including 
incorrect accusations of wrongdoing.  (A widely repeated 
explanation of what sparked the particularly bloody ethnic 
clashes in March 2003 is that, after a disagreement between 
an oil baron and a corrupt Navy officer over the movement of 
stolen oil, Navy forces and the Ijaw militia of the oil baron 
engaged in a series of skirmishes.  The Ijaw then attacked 
villages of Itsekiri, with whom the Ijaw have had a 
long-standing dispute over political and territorial 
boundaries.) 
 
9. (S N/F) Illustrating his point about misconceptions, 
Ogunjimi said some 20 ships pull into the Escravos River and 
its tributaries each week to transfer petroleum products 
legally. Bona fide traders register with the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), he said, which gives 
Ogunjimi\'s headquarters a weekly listing of ships that will 
moor in the Delta to transfer cargo.  Ogunjimi said he uses 
those lists to identify illegal bunkerers; any ship taking on 
crude that is not on the weekly NNPC list will be boarded and 
seized.  Ogunjimi is aware of the allegation that the Navy 
facilitates illegal bunkering by looking the other way when 
paid to do so, and by seizing cargoes of those unwilling to 
pay bribes or who are the enemy of a powerful cartel; 
however, he maintained this is simply an incorrect inference. 
 People who don\'t know the system jump to wrong conclusions, 
he said, when they see some ships coming and going without 
Navy interference (ships on the NNPC list), while other ships 
are boarded and seized (ships not on the list). 
 
10. (S N/F) Ogunjimi claimed that oil company employees 
facilitate illegal bunkering.  He said there is no other 
explanation for the ease in which pipelines or flow stations 
are tapped.  Without assistance, the Captain said, simple men 
from fishing villages would have no way of knowing which of 
the many pipes crisscrossing the Delta carry crude, diesel, 
gas or water. Ogunjimi also echoed the allegation of Ijaw 
youth leaders that oil company employees are so directly 
involved in illegal bunkering that pilfering barges are often 
brought directly to manifolds and spigots to obtain oil; no 
vandalizing of pipelines is required. 
 
----------------------------- 
Catch and (Sometimes) Release 
----------------------------- 
 
11. (S N/F) Captain Ogunjimi claimed that his command had 
seized 10 ships involved in illegal oil transfers in eight 
months.  He said the powers-that-be in Nigerian government 
pay close attention to his work.  For example, Ogunjimi noted 
that when his men seize a vessel, he reports first to the 
Naval Chief of Staff in Abuja, and then to his commanding 
officer, Rear Admiral Antonio Ibinabo Bob-Manuel in Lagos. 
Ogunjimi said that after bringing the first three vessels 
seized under his command to NNS Delta, he was subjected to 
intense political pressure locally to release them. He said 
he was offered bribes and was threatened.  That experience, 
he said, taught him to immediately move to Lagos any ship he 
seizes in the Delta, which lessens the political pressure and 
intimidation he and his officers must endure. According to 
Ogunjimi, of 10 ships recently seized, three remain moored at 
his base in Warri, five were transferred to Lagos and two 
were released. 
 
12. (S N/F) The Captain described one occasion on which he 
claimed he was ordered by superiors to release a vessel. He 
said his men seized the tanker British Progress (carrying a 
British crew) about the time of the seizure of the Russian 
tanker African Pride.  Within days, he was ordered to release 
the vessel and crew on the grounds that it was an NNPC ship 
authorized to take oil.  When Econoff suggested it was 
strange that the NNPC would load a ship offshore from barges 
in the middle of the night as the Captain had described, 
Ogunjimi smiled and said, \"That is what I was told, and I 
received orders to release it.\" 
 
------------ 
The Russians 
------------ 
 
13. (S N/F) In mid-October, Nigerian news outlets carried 
headlines that the ship African Pride, with a largely Russian 
crew, had been caught in the Delta loading crude illegally. 
Ogunjimi said the ship was seized in a night raid.  The 
Captain said the ship and crew (including two Georgians and a 
Romanian) were transferred to Lagos, where prosecutors 
publicly stated that charges would be filed.  Ogunjimi would 
not or could not say who leased the ship, but disclosed that 
the cargo belonged to a Nigerian. The African Pride, he 
noted, remains anchored just offshore of Lagos, with the crew 
still confined onboard. 
 
----------------------------- 
Can the Effort be Maintained? 
----------------------------- 
 
14. (S N/F) COMMENT. Captain Ogunjimi may be sincere when he 
says GON security forces want to break the illegal bunkering 
cartels, rather than simply arrest villagers hired to tap 
pipelines, and his efforts do appear to have reduced the 
volume of oil stolen from the Niger Delta. But will 
Ogunjimi\'s stated strategy of pursuing the ships that 
transport oil away from the Delta remain effective over time? 
Ogunjimi\'s efforts are only one step up the \"cartel\" supply 
chain.  The GON does not appear to be targeting the financial 
backers of the illegal trade, although the refrain that 
\"everyone knows who they are\" is often repeated in the Delta. 
Ogunjimi himself noted that \"they (cartels) are always coming 
up with new ways to get around us.\" And even if Ogunjimi is 
as honest as he appears to be, there is no guarantee that his 
replacement, due in mid-January 2004, will be equally so. END 
COMMENT.

     E. 2003 LAGOS 499 
 
Classified By: JOSEPH GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: Nigeria continues to face periodic fuel 
shortages as the GON, fuel marketers and the public adjust to 
a quasi-deregulated environment.  Inadequate port facilities 
in Lagos create bottlenecks for delivery of imported fuel, 
and changing government policies create business uncertainty 
for sellers of fuel.  Short- and long-term relief may come as 
private marketers look to other Nigerian ports to ease 
shipping congestion and negotiate with the NNPC to assume 
management of key offloading facilities. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) During the 2003 holiday season, Nigerian motorists 
again found themselves waiting in lines for gasoline and 
paying more for public transport as fuel stations ran short 
of supply.  Ongoing supply chain problems continue to plague 
the country\'s fuel markets, as do the GON\'s re-regulation 
policies for the downstream petroleum sector.  An executive 
with a major fuel retailer in Nigeria told Econoff that since 
deregulation took effect October 1 (ref A), Nigeria\'s 
domestic and imported fuel supply has been meeting only about 
55 percent of market demand, so retailers routinely close 
their stations on an ad-hoc basis.  An air freight company 
executive also reported that shortages of jet fuel at the 
Lagos international airport has forced airlines to adjust 
routes and fueling patterns. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
SHIP TO SHORE: BOTTLENECKS AT THE LAGOS PORT 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) In conversations with Econoff, Jules Harvey, Texaco 
International\'s Vice President for West Africa, listed port 
congestion as a major contributor to Nigeria\'s ongoing fuel 
crunch.  Because Nigeria\'s refineries remain largely offline, 
most fuel sold in the country is imported. After retail price 
caps were eliminated in October, private marketers entered 
the import business cautiously.  Harvey told Econoff that the 
six major private fuel marketers in Nigeria formed a 
purchasing committee to which each company submits bids 
indicating how much fuel it is willing to bring to Nigeria 
during a given time frame and at what cost.  Winning bidders 
then purchase fuel on international markets and arrange for 
its delivery to Lagos ia tanker ships.  Upon arrival, 
cargoes are divided among the companies roughly according to 
existing marketshare, the original purchaser being reimbursed 
at the time of delivery by each recipient company for its 
share of the cargo. 
 
4. (SBU) Problems arise as soon as fuel tankers arrive in the 
waters off the coast of Nigeria.  The water level at the 
berthing docks for the main fuel jetty at the Apapa port in 
Lagos is too shallow to handle large tankers coming from 
overseas (35,000 tons plus).  Consequently, fuel cargoes must 
be transferred to smaller vessels (15,000 tons) at sea before 
being brought into port. 
 
5. (SBU) The main fuel offloading jetty at Apapa belongs to 
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  Once 
cleared by Customs and port managers, fuel ships berth at the 
jetty, and cargo is pumped through a manifold that sends fuel 
either to NNPC\'s storage tanks or to those belonging to one 
of the private marketers. (Besides the six major \"private 
marketers,\" Nigeria licenses over 1,000 \"independent 
marketers\" (ref B). The independent marketers may own as few 
as one gas station, and generally purchase fuel from NNPC.) 
Delays occur because the jetty has insufficient capacity to 
handle the number of ships needed to relay fuel cargoes. 
Moreover, according to one fuel importer, regardless of when 
a private marketer\'s ship is cleared for offloading, NNPC 
vessels always take precedence at the jetty, forcing the 
marketers\' ships to wait.  These delays in offloading result 
in significant demurrage fees for the marketers that drive up 
their business costs.  A backup of fuel deliveries is evident 
simply by scanning the horizon south of Lagos where ships 
wait to be offloaded or to bring fuel to port.  On a boat 
tour December 26, Econoff counted some 55 tanker ships 
anchored off the coast near the entrance to Lagos\' harbor 
channel.  Most were small vessels registered in Lagos, but 
large tankers were also anchored at sea, including some 
transferring fuel to smaller ships. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
COMPANIES AND THE CBN ENTER UNCHARTED WATERS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Texaco\'s Harvey noted another element to the fuel 
supply challenge in Nigeria: designated importers sometimes 
fail to deliver their scheduled fuel cargoes.  He noted that 
some of the companies\' managers grew accustomed to the old 
system whereby NNPC imported fuel, sold it to the marketers 
at a fixed rate, and mandated a retail price cap which 
effectively became the universal sales price.  For these 
managers, this early phase of deregulation is a new business 
model with which they are neither familiar nor comfortable. 
On several instances since October, companies chosen by the 
private marketers\' ad-hoc import committee to purchase 
cargoes of fuel failed to deliver product on time (or at 
all), causing a supply problem for all of the private 
marketers. Harvey attributed such delivery failures to a 
combination of the inexperience and poor business decisions. 
 
7. (C) Marketers sometimes also have difficulty obtaining 
dollars from the Central Bank of Nigeria\'s (CBN) Dutch 
Auction System (DAS) to purchase fuel abroad (ref C). Under 
the current arrangement, the company purchasing fuel on the 
international market pays for that cargo in dollars, and the 
other marketers pay the purchaser for their respective share 
of the cargo in naira at the time of delivery.  Harvey told 
Econoff that at a stakeholders\' meeting on January 5, 
President Obasanjo promised marketers that the CBN would make 
$200 million per month available to the industry for fuel 
stocks. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
POSSIBLE SHORT-TERM FIX: PORT HARCOURT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) Texaco\'s Harvey told Econoff that marketers are 
analyzing import options to ease the strain on the fuel jetty 
in Lagos, including delivering fuel to Port Harcourt in the 
far south of Nigeria and to Calabar in the southeast near the 
Cameroon border.  Such a move could help the companies move 
fuel more easily throughout Nigeria\'s southern, 
south-central, and eastern regions where supplies often run 
dry and black-market prices were reported to have been as 
high as 200 naira per liter in recent weeks. (Since 
deregulation, the going rate for gasoline in Lagos has been 
between 39 and 42 naira per liter, but the Department of 
Petroleum Resources (DPR) recently told marketers not to 
charge above 41 naira per liter in Lagos, and between 42 and 
48 naira per liter elsewhere (ref D).) 
 
--------------------------- 
THE POTENTIAL OF ATLAS COVE 
--------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) The Atlas Cove fuel jetty, now being completely 
rebuilt, may help alleviate port congestion for fuel 
shipments when it returns to operation.  Atlas Cove lies near 
the entrance to Lagos\' harbor channel, and is deep enough to 
handle large tankers.  That would allow for faster, more 
efficient, and less expensive offloading of fuel.  Viewing it 
from a boat in the channel, the new jetty nearing completion 
does appear large and modern.  However, the Atlas Cove jetty 
is connected to NNPC storage tanks only, so under current 
arrangements, private marketers would not use Atlas Cove for 
their imports. 
 
------------------------- 
MANAGEMENT OF THE JETTIES 
------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Texaco\'s Harvey told Econoff that the marketers are 
negotiating with the NNPC to turn over management of both the 
main jetty at Apapa and the new jetty at Atlas Cove to 
private industry.  Harvey said his company is interested in 
forming a consortium to operate the jetty, but other 
proposals include hiring an international port management 
company, or offering a management contract to one of the 
marketers.  Marketers believe that many of the actual 
delivery delays could be eliminated with proper (private) 
management of jetty operations.  Harvey said President 
Obasanjo is pressing NNPC Group Managing Director Funso 
Kupolokun to turn over management of the Apapa jetty to the 
industry, but Harvey believes that the NNPC will not turn 
over Atlas Cove anytime soon.  Harvey said that if NNPC 
someday agrees to turn over management of Atlas Cove, the 
marketers will build an underwater pipeline network to move 
fuel directly from the jetty to the companies\' storage tanks, 
which lie near each other about four miles from Atlas Cove. 
 
------------------ 
OPPORTUNISM KNOCKS 
------------------ 
 
11. (SBU) The Nigerian press and government regulators also 
point to greed as a cause of recent fuel queues.  In 
mid-December, President Obasanjo announced that as of January 
1, 2004, a fuel tax of one and one-half naira per liter would 
be imposed nationwide in an effort to raise revenue for road 
repair and maintenance.  Observers allege that after the 
President\'s tax announcement, some retailers began hoarding 
their fuel supplies in hopes that after the first of the year 
they could charge consumers the amount of the tax but 
under-report their sales to the government and pocket the 
difference.  That may not be a universal or even common 
practice, but motorists reacted to Obasajo\'s announcement by 
trying to fill their tanks before the end of the year, 
causing a run on already tight fuel supplies.  The usual 
exodus of Nigerians from urban centers to  villages for the 
holidays also contributed to a spike in demand, and 
subsequent gas station queues.  Since January 1, occasional 
fuel queues may be found at retail gas stations, but the 
situation is not out of the ordinary, at least when compared 
to conditions seen throughout 2003 when supply problems again 
became 
noticeable (ref E). 
 
------------------ 
SAME OLD SAME OLD? 
------------------ 
 
1. C) Fue maketers may have also reduced fuel imports in 
Decmber after the Department of Petroleum Resources (PR) 
reinstated a price-cap.  Higher than expecte crude prices 
and a decline in the value of the aira made the DPR price 
caps particularly unwelcoe to the arkeers astheir narrow 
profit margin degraded further. Moreover, a flurry of other 
poposals covering matters such as how prices must b posted 
at stations to how sales will be monitored and taxed have 
been bandied about publicly by government officials, 
legislators, unions and other activists at both the federal 
and state levels, gave retailers an increasing feeling of 
business uncertainty going into the new year.   Nonetheless, 
Jules Harvey of Texaco told Econoff on January 6 that his 
company has increased its retail gasoline price to 42.5 naira 
per liter in Lagos to absorb the new fuel tax, and that this 
move, so far allowed by DPR, provides Texaco a sufficient 
margin to continue importing fuel in the near-term.  But 
Harvey noted that the new year was rung-in under the same 
dark clouds of poor government planning and coordination, 
poor transportation infrastructure, and union strike threats 
seen throughout 2003.  He said President Obasanjo is trying 
hard to keep deregulation and reform of the petroleum sector 
on track, but he is \"quite lonely at the top.\"

SUMMARY:  According to Senior World Airways staff, all 
flights to and from the United States to Lagos have been 
cancelled effective January 1, 2004, until further notice. 
This will affect between 800 and 1,000 curren ticket 
holders.  END SUMMARY. 
 
1.  On January 5, 2004, Embassy Econoff spoke with Senior 
World Airways officials who confirmed the suspension of all 
World Airways flights between the United States and Nigeria 
effective January 1, 2004.  World Airways told Econoff that 
the airline chose not to renew its contract with Ritetime, 
which served as the World Airways booking agent, after it 
expired on December 31, 2003, because Ritetime owed World 
Airways over USD 2 million in arrears payments for charter 
services.  This will leave between 800 and 1,000 passengers 
stranded in Nigeria. When passengers arrive at the World 
Airways office in Lagos, they encounter a sign on the door 
that states \"Effective immediately, all flights are 
cancelled until further notice.\"  World Airways\' staff in 
Lagos left for Belgium due to security concerns as airline 
officials have received reports that stranded passengers are 
creating disturbances in Atlanta, New York and Lagos. 
 
2. ConOff is working to get a more accurate count of the 
number of stranded AmCits; however, it is estimated that 
more than half could be dual nationals.  World Airways\' 
tickets are charter tickets and cannot be used on other 
international flights.  Any inquiries concerning World 
Airways flights should be directed to Ritetime Travel in 
Lagos, 011-234-1-270-5600 or in the United States at (770) 
613-0011. 
 
3.  According to Nigerian news accounts, Ritetime Managing 
Director, Dr. Peter Obafemi is promising a flight on 
Thursday to get the stranded passengers out.  We do not have 
independent confirmation of this. 
 
4.  World Airways, through its public relations office in 
Lagos will issue a press release in the next few days 
explaining why they halted service.

REF: LAGOS 000031 
 
1.  On Thursday, January 8, 2004, approximately fifty 
stranded World Airways passengers appeared at the Consulate 
demanding assistance in returning to the U.S.  Some of the 
passengers claim they have been stranded since December 31 
and have been staying overnight at the airport while 
awaiting word from World Airways as to when they can return. 
 
2.  In an effort to be responsive and to calm the 
passengers, ACS Officer arranged a meeting with the stranded 
passengers in which the Consul General attended.  The Consul 
General advised the passengers that we were concerned about 
their situation and attempting to find alternatives for 
their travel.  However, their only financial recourse may be 
a legal one. 
 
3.  Passengers received a briefing from the ACS officer as 
to the repatriation process and alternatives such as 
securing flights via another carrier as well as obtaining 
money from family and friends to assist them financially. 
 
4.   The passengers stated their appreciation at having the 
Consul General speak with them.  Further, they stated it was 
the first time during this entire ordeal that they felt 
anyone cared about their situation. 
 
5.   Over the past two days, we have collected eleven 
applications for a loan.  Of those, we have determined that 
four are truly in need of repatriation.  We have also 
received additional passengers that are asking for letters 
for their employers or schools.  We have learned that World 
Airways tickets were sold through Friday, January 9, 2004. 
The airline stopped flying on December 31. 
 
6.   ACS Officer believes we will continue to see stranded 
passengers who become increasingly destitute as time passes. 
As they come in, we will process them all as individual 
repatriation cases.

1. (U) Summary: World Airways recently announced the 
indefinite suspension of its charter flights between the 
United States and Nigeria.  Company executives say World\'s 
booking agent, Ritetime Aviation and Travel Service, owes 
the airline nearly US $2 million and argue that World cannot 
continue to operate charters without being paid. 
Unfortunately, this leaves 800 to 1,000 people stranded in 
Lagos with tickets that cannot be used on other airlines. 
Many have waited nearly two weeks in the hope that Ritetime 
would make good on its promises to send a plane, but as of 
17:00 Wednesday, January 14, no aircraft has appeared. 
Airport contacts reported random acts of violence on 
Tuesday, January 13, and stranded AmCit passengers say that 
the offices of Ritetime and World were ransacked the same 
day, but no violence has occurred since then.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) World Airways announced the cancellation of its 
charter flights between the United States and Nigeria 
effective January 1, 2004.  In its press release, World 
named Ritetime Aviation and Travel Service the \"contractor 
and sole marketing agent\" for its charter flights and said 
it had \"no control over Ritetime\'s ticket sales or 
reservations,\" particularly when Ritetime sold tickets for 
flights beyond the December 31 expiration of its contract 
with World.  The press release also stated that Ritetime had 
\"not made its payments to World Airways.\"  Under the 
circumstances, World executives say they had no choice but 
to discontinue services.  The Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority sent a scathing message to World Airways calling 
on the airline to honor its commitment to passengers \"to 
avert even more ugly scenes which can jeopardize good 
relations,\" but World executives chose not to respond to the 
letter. 
 
3. (U) The airline\'s decision leaves 800 to 1,000 people 
stranded, all of them holding charter tickets that cannot be 
used on other airlines.  Twenty-nine people returned to the 
United States on a Transatlantic Airlines flight, and others 
may board charter flights from Lagos to Accra and from there 
to New York later this week, but many stranded passengers 
are still looking for a way home.  International flights 
from Lagos are almost completely booked until mid-January. 
In its press release, World Airways expressed its \"genuine 
apologies for any inconvenience\" but said there was nothing 
it could do.  Company executives say World will not send 
rescue flights, particularly when passengers in Lagos and 
New York are becoming increasingly agitated.  As of Tuesday, 
January 13, there appeared to be a solution: Ritetime has 
allegedly chartered a European Airways plane to ferry 
passengers from Lagos to Accra and on to New York at no 
extra charge.  However, as of 17:00 Wednesday, January 14, 
no aircraft has appeared. 
 
4. (U) Comment: World Airways executives have expressed 
interest in finding another booking agent and re-introducing 
charter flights in four to six months - the Lagos-New York 
route is potentially one of the airline\'s most lucrative - 
but World\'s damaged reputation will make this difficult. 
The Nigerian press has repeatedly castigated the airline, 
GON officials have expressed disappointment in World\'s 
decision to cancel its flights, and the Nigerian Civil 
Aviation Authority has expressed anger at the airline\'s 
refusal to rescue stranded passengers.  World Airways 
executives will meet GON officials later this month, but 
even this may not be enough to salvage the airline\'s 
reputation.  Whether or not World re-enters the market, 
other U.S. air carriers are lining up to take its place. 
Continental Airlines has made serious inquiries, and KLM 
reports that Northwest will start a Lagos to Detroit run in 
June or July 2004.  End comment.

1.   (U) SUMMARY.  The development of natural resources in 
the Nigeria-Sao Tome and Principe Joint Development Zone 
(JDZ) took another step forward after a joint regulatory 
body gave ExxonMobil the go-ahead to exercise preferential 
rights in the Zone. An American-Nigerian company will have a 
similar opportunity after ExxonMobil, followed by winners of 
the twenty companies that tendered non-preferential bids in 
October 2003. The Joint Development Authority operating in 
Abuja is preparing for the robust development of petroleum 
and other natural resources in the JDZ, and diversification 
into other commercial enterprises.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) On December 30, the fifth Nigeria-Sao Tome Joint 
Ministerial Council meeting announced that exploitation of 
the Joint Development Zone may begin in the foreseeable 
future as the Council agreed to give ExxonMobil the 
opportunity to exercise its preferential rights to bid on 
specific blocks in the JDZ. ExxonMobil has thirty days to 
submit its bids, after which Environmental Remediation 
Holding Corporation (ERHC), a Houston-based firm now doing 
business as Chrome Energy Corporation (CEC), will exercise 
its preferential rights. 
 
------------------- 
CHARTING THE COURSE 
------------------- 
 
3.   (U) Work on the JDZ began in 1999 when the heads of 
state of Nigeria and of Sao Tome and Principe agreed to 
negotiate a formal treaty regulating the development of a 
zone of overlapping maritime boundary claims between the two 
countries.  Negotiations began in 2000, and a treaty was 
signed and ratified by both countries in 2001 covering a 
Joint Development Zone of almost 35,000 square kilometers. 
The treaty will be in force for 45 years with a review after 
30, and Nigeria and Sao Tome and Principe will share 
resources on the basis of a 60/40 ratio, respectively. 
 
4.   (U) Disagreements between the countries over elements 
of the treaty stalled further development of the JDZ until 
the Nigeria-Sao Tome and Principe Joint Development 
Authority (JDA) announced the opening of the 2003 JDZ 
Licensing Round in April 2003.  Nine blocks were offered, 
and bids were due by October 18.  A summary of signature 
bonuses offered in the bids (see below) was issued on 
October 27. 
 
5.   (SBU) Sam Dimka, head of Corporate and Public Affairs 
for the JDA, told Econoff that twenty companies submitted 33 
bids for eight of the nine blocks offered.  Most were for 
the northern-most blocks which are generally considered to 
hold the most promise; no bids were received for Block 08, 
one was received for Block 09, and the single bid for Block 
07 did not conform to bid requirements set forth in the 
published Guidelines for Investors, according to Dimka. 
 
-------------------------- 
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS 
-------------------------- 
 
6.   (SBU) Winning bidders will be offered production 
sharing contracts (PSC) by the JDA.  (A PSC is a contract 
whereby one party, usually an international oil company, 
takes all of the risks and bears all the cost of finding and 
producing petroleum.  After recouping such costs, the 
contractor shares production with a national oil company.) 
The JDA will evaluate bids first according to specified 
technical criteria and then commercial criteria. A key 
element of the commercial evaluation will be the signature 
bonus offered by the bidders.  The signature bonus is a 
premium each bidder agrees to pay in a lump sum within 30 
days of signing a PSC with the JDA.  The Guidelines for 
Investors stipulated that a signature bonus of at least $30 
million was required per block. (The JDA\'s Dimka told 
Econoff that the bid for Block 07 included a signature bonus 
of less than $30 million so the bid was deemed non- 
compliant.)  ChevronTexaco reportedly offered $123 million 
for Block 01. Dimka estimated that Sao Tome and Principe 
alone will receive between $100 million and $200 million by 
mid-2004 from the signature bonuses.  Bidders are also to 
offer production bonuses for specific future production 
thresholds. 
 
7.   (U) In addition to the bonuses, each bidder was 
required to pay a $15,000 application fee per block, as well 
as a $10,000 bid processing fee per block.  Companies had 
the opportunity to purchase data and non-exclusive seismic 
surveys on the blocks at commercial rates from firms 
including PGS, WesternGeco and Veritas. 
 
------------------- 
PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS 
------------------- 
 
8.   (U) Third Party Interests must be settled before the 
JDA offers contracts on the bids.  ExxonMobil and 
Environmental Remediation Holding Company, now operating as 
Chrome Energy within the Chrome Group of Nigeria, had been 
conducting exploration activities under agreement with the 
Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (DRSTP) prior 
to negotiation of the JDZ treaty.  Both companies were 
subsequently given preferential bidding rights under the 
treaty. 
 
9.   (U) ExxonMobil has first opportunity to bid on three 
blocks, and may hold stakes as high as 40 percent, 25 
percent, and 25 percent respectively in the blocks.  The 
company has 30 days after it was notified by the JDA to 
exercise its rights (until about January 30, 2004). 
Subsequently, Chrome Energy will be given 15 days to 
exercise its rights to six blocks.  The maximum stake Chrome 
may own in its blocks varies from 15 to 30 percent.  Chrome 
may bid on blocks already bid by ExxonMobil, but the two 
companies cannot hold a combined interest greater than 40 
percent in any one block. 
 
10.  (U) Dimka told Econoff that these preferential bids 
must also include a signature bonus at least equal to the 
proportion of its preferential right in a block when 
compared to the highest bid for that block in the 2003 
licensing round.  For example, if ExxonMobil submits it\'s 
first preferential bid on a block for which ChevronTexaco 
submitted the highest signature bonus, ExxonMobil\'s 
signature bonus must match at least 40 percent of 
ChevronTexaco\'s offer. 
 
---------------------------- 
LOOKING FOR FAST DEVELOPMENT 
---------------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU) Representatives of the two countries and the JDA 
have publicly stated that the amount of the signature bonus 
will not be the sole determinant of a winning bid. 
Considerations such as experience, financing, and commitment 
to local content will be closely evaluated.  The JDA\'s Dimka 
told Econoff that the Authority will choose companies that 
show a capacity and intent to develop and produce oil in the 
Zone quickly and efficiently.  The JDA, he said, is 
concerned that some bidders, particularly smaller companies 
indigenous to West Africa, have submitted bids in hopes of 
gaining rights they do not plan to develop but instead would 
transfer later at hefty fees.  Dimka said the JDA is not 
interested in licensing such \"land grabs.\" 
 
---------------- 
MULTIFACETED JDA 
---------------- 
 
12.  (SBU) Dimka also told Econoff that the JDA is set up as 
a \"one-stop resource\" shop for the companies that will 
ultimately develop the JDZ, as it is both the exploratory 
body offering licenses and the regulatory agency 
implementing the Zone\'s Petroleum Regulations and collecting 
taxes, royalties and fees.  Dimka said knowledgeable and 
talented individuals from both countries staff the JDA.  He 
noted the JDA\'s Chairman, Dr. Taju Umar, holds a PhD in 
Geology and was formerly associated with Nigeria\'s 
Department of Petroleum Resources. Dimka himself worked in 
the public affairs office of Nigeria\'s former Advisor to the 
President for Petroleum Matters, Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, 
including while Lukman served as Secretary General of OPEC. 
 
13.  (SBU) According to Dimka, the JDA will be financially 
self-sufficient, and will develop and manage resources in 
the Zone other than oil, such as fishing and non-petroleum 
minerals.  Dimka said the JDA will invest in other 
commercial interests, such as service industries and 
airlines.  Dimka also said the JDA is committed to ensuring 
the security of operators and facilities that will be 
established in the Zone, and will coordinate that effort 
between the two countries and private security firms. 
 
------------------------------ 
BOON FOR SAO TOME AND PRINCIPE 
------------------------------ 
 
14.  (SBU) Dimka told Econoff that while this venture will 
benefit both countries, the potential windfall it may create 
for the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (DRSTP) 
is enormous.  He did note that the DRSTP must develop its 
infrastructure and commercial centers significantly in the 
near future to handle the influx of business the JDZ will 
bring.  For example, he said recent meetings held in DRSTP 
used all available hotel space, and that several new large 
hotels are needed.  He also noted that international oil 
companies and Nigerian banks are interested in negotiating 
land purchases now with the expectation that they will 
establish future operations on the islands.

1. (U) Summary: World Airways recently announced the 
indefinite suspension of its charter flights between 
the United States and Nigeria.  Company executives say 
World\'s booking agent, Ritetime Aviation and Travel 
Service, owes the airline nearly US $2 million and 
argue that World cannot continue to operate charters 
without being paid.  Unfortunately, this leaves 800 to 
1,000 people stranded in Lagos with tickets that cannot 
be used on other airlines.  Many have waited nearly two 
weeks in the hope that Ritetime would make good on its 
promises to send a plane, but as of Wednesday, January 
14, no aircraft had appeared.  Airport contacts 
reported random acts of violence on Tuesday, January 
13, but airport officials denied the claims.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) World Airways announced the cancellation of its 
charter flights between the United States and Nigeria 
effective January 1, 2004.  In its press release, World 
named Ritetime Aviation and Travel Service the 
\"contractor and sole marketing agent\" for its charter 
flights and said it had \"no control over Ritetime\'s 
ticket sales or reservations,\" particularly when 
Ritetime sold tickets for flights beyond the December 
31 expiration of its contract with World.  The press 
release also stated that Ritetime had \"not made its 
payments to World Airways.\"  Under the circumstances, 
World executives say they had no choice but to 
discontinue services.  The Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority sent a scathing message to World Airways 
calling on the airline to honor its commitment to 
passengers \"to avert even more ugly scenes which can 
jeopardize good relations,\" but World executives chose 
not to respond to the letter. 
 
3. (U) The airline\'s decision leaves 800 to 1,000 
people stranded, all of them holding charter tickets 
that cannot be used on other airlines.  Twenty-nine 
people returned to the United States on a Transatlantic 
Airlines flight, and others may board charter flights 
from Lagos to Accra and from there to New York later 
this week, but many stranded passengers are still 
looking for a way home.  International flights from 
Lagos are almost completely booked until mid-January. 
In its press release, World Airways expressed its 
\"genuine apologies for any inconvenience\" but said 
there was nothing it could do.  Company executives say 
World will not send rescue flights, particularly when 
passengers in Lagos and New York are becoming 
increasingly agitated.  As of Tuesday, January 13, 
there appeared to be a solution: Ritetime had allegedly 
chartered a European Airways plane to ferry passengers 
from Lagos to Accra and on to New York at no extra 
charge.  However, as of Wednesday, January 14, no 
aircraft had appeared. 
 
4. (U) Comment: World Airways executives have expressed 
interest in finding another booking agent and re- 
introducing charter flights in four to six months - the 
Lagos-New York route is potentially one of the 
airline\'s most lucrative - but World\'s damaged 
reputation will make this difficult.  The Nigerian 
press has repeatedly castigated the airline, GON 
officials have expressed disappointment in World\'s 
decision to cancel its flights, and the Nigerian Civil 
Aviation Authority has expressed anger at the airline\'s 
refusal to rescue stranded passengers.  World Airways 
executives will meet GON officials later this month, 
but even this may not be enough to salvage the 
airline\'s reputation.  Whether or not World re-enters 
the market, other U.S. air carriers are lining up to 
take its place.  Continental Airlines has made serious 
inquiries, and KLM reports that Northwest will start a 
Lagos to Detroit run in June or July 2004.  End 
comment.

Passengers

1. Summary:  On Thursday, January 15, 2004, Conoff participated 
in a telephone call initiated by representatives of World 
Airways.  World Airways executives asked if Post could provide an 
approximate number of World Airways passengers still stranded in 
Lagos, adding that the carrier plans to operate a \"humanitarian 
flight\" from Lagos to New York on Sunday, January 18, 2004. 
Peter Obafemi, CEO of Rite Time Travel is also making independent 
efforts to assist stranded passengers with their return to the 
U.S.  As of 1800 Friday, January 16 Consulate is aware of at 
least 11 Amcits who remain stranded in Lagos.  End Summary. 
 
2.  On January 15, ACS Officer spoke to the following 
representatives of World Airways: Bob Dubois, Director of 
Passenger Sales, Allen Fort, Vice President of Sales, Robert 
Perry, Vice President of Business Development, Ann Aktabowski, 
Vice President of Ground Services and Mark McMillan, corporate in- 
house Counsel.  Mr. Dubois asked ACS Officer to provide them with 
a sense of how many World passengers we believed were still 
stranded in Lagos.  This information would assist World in making 
a decision as to how to proceed in rescuing the stranded 
passengers.  The executives confirmed that they have distanced 
themselves from Obafemi, and will not speak with him because they 
are pursuing legal avenues against him and Rite Time over this 
matter. 
 
3.  We do not have an accurate count of how many passengers 
remain.  ACS Officer advised World Airways that approximately 125 
passengers, including minor children and legal permanent 
residents, have visited the Consulate seeking assistance.  In 
addition, RSO confirmed the presence of approximately 80 World 
Airways passengers still stranded at Murtalla Mohammed 
International Airport on January 15.  We do not know the 
nationalities of this group or how many of them may be the same 
passengers that came to the Consulate.  Some or all of them may 
have departed on the January 15 TransAtlantic flight to JFK via 
Accra.  Finally, we do not know how many others are waiting in 
their villages, have taken alternate flights, or simply have 
given up the trip. 
 
4.  World Airways executives promised to keep the lines of 
communication open with the Consulate and provide specific 
details regarding the humanitarian flight.  Aktabowski assured 
Conoff that, although the situation \"is not World Airways\' 
fault,\" the airline would do everything it could to help resolve 
the matter.  Aktabowski stressed that the January 18 flight will 
be a \"moral gesture of good will,\" not an assumption of 
responsibility.  She cautioned, however, that beyond the January 
18 flight, World Airways cannot operate without receiving payment 
for services already rendered.  She added that World Airways is 
not obligated to operate without a contract. 
 
5.  At approximately 1500 on January 15, Peter Obafemi advised 
Conoff that he would provide seats aboard a departing 
TransAtlantic flight at no additional charge for all stranded 
passengers who had visited the Consulate.  At the same time, 
Henry Seymour, a former representative of Rite Time who has 
distanced himself from Obafemi, offered six Amcits and 11 other 
passengers seats on the same flight at a discounted price of 
$700.00.  At 2230, Obafemi confirmed that he was able to board 
150 stranded World Airways passengers on the TransAtlantic flight 
but he could not tell us how many of them were Amcits.  Obafemi 
said he was not sure when he could assist approximately 150 
additional passengers who he says remain stranded in Lagos. 
Furthermore, Obafemi admitted, tickets have been sold through 
March. 
 
6.  Comment:  Based on Obafemi\'s estimate, ACS Officer will 
provide World Airways\' executives with an approximate number of 
150 remaining passengers of unknown nationalities.  While post 
continues to work with Obafemi and World Airways, we will stress 
that our goal is to ensure the safe return of American citizens. 
As of 1600 on January 16, 9 additional AmCit passengers had 
contacted the Consulate seeking assistance in obtaining flights 
to the U.S.  Right now, we are aware of 11 Amcits who are still

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: UNHCR COUNTRY REP GIVES OVERVIEW 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: POLOFF met with Eusebe Hounsokou, UNHCR 
Country Representative to Nigeria, on January 7 and discussed 
concerns about potential violent uprising of Nigerians living 
on the Bakassi Peninsula, the possible repatriation of 
Nigerian refugees from Cameroon to their homes in Taraba 
State, Nigeria, and UNHCR funding of child trafficking 
programs in Nigeria. END SUMMARY. 
 
------- 
BAKASSI 
------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Hounsokou visited the Bakassi region in December 
2002, shortly after the ICJ ruling in favor of the Government 
of Cameroon (GRC).  While there, he met members of the 
Bakassi Liberation Front (BLF) who told him they are willing 
to fight to protect their perceived rights.  Since then, 
Hounsokou and UNHCR offices in Nigeria and Cameroon have been 
monitoring developments in the Bakassi Peninsula and the 
Anglophone region of Cameroon.  In previous discussions with 
POLOFF, Hounsokou expressed concern for Nigerian nationals 
living in Bakassi and for Anglophone Cameroonians in general. 
Hounsokou thinks that Bakassis may be arming themselves like 
the ethnic groups in the Niger Delta.  Although he is unable 
to substantiate his concerns, he believes it would be easy 
for Bakassi fishermen to smuggle arms into the region in 
their fishing boats. 
 
3.  (SBU) UNHCR offices in Yaounde reported to UNHCR Lagos in 
October 2003 that a splinter group from Southern Cameroon\'s 
National Council (SCNC) had declared its independence and 
claimed that its youths were armed.  Should Nigeria cede the 
Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon, Hounsokou believes the 
Bakassis may begin an armed struggle against the GRC, which 
would create a refugee crisis.  He identified the SCNC as a 
\"natural ally\" of the Bakassis and feels that a conflict in 
the Bakassi Peninsula may inflame tensions in Anglophone 
Cameroon. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
REPATRIATION OF REFUGEES TO TARABA STATE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) UNHCR Nigeria estimates that approximately 17,000 
Nigerian refugees live in neighboring Cameroon.  Mostly 
ethnic Fulani herders, they fled Benue and Taraba States 
following ethno-religious clashes between the Tiv and Jukun 
peoples in January 2002.  Hounsokou will coordinate a field 
assessment in Taraba State in early February to determine if 
conditions will enable the refugees to return to their home 
villages.  He has asked representatives from the US, UK, 
German, and Canadian Missions to accompany him along with 
representatives from ICRC, FAO, and UNICEF.  (UNHCR will 
likely look for international support and possible donor 
partners to help organize repatriation.) 
 
------------------------------ 
HUMAN SECURITY PROGRAM FUNDING 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (U) Hounsokou is expecting a US $2 million budget to fund 
a country program on Human Security.  ECOWAS and the UNHCR 
will jointly seek funding for the project.  UNHCR Nigeria has 
submitted a project proposal to its headquarters and has tied 
in child trafficking.  Hounsokou believes child trafficking 
is a post conflict problem within the region; he wants to 
identify programs that target source and destination 
communities to alleviate this growing trend.  He expressed 
interest in USG efforts in combating trafficking in Nigeria, 
regionally and domestically, and may solicit assistance from 
the Mission to identify programs. 
 
6. (U) The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is scheduled to 
visit Nigeria in April.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, EPET, KDEM, PGOV, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: DEREGULATION AND THE FUEL TAX: HIGHER 
PUMP PRICES PROMPT LASCO TO CALL A JANUARY 21 
NATIONWIDE STRIKE 
 
1.  On January 7, 2004, the Nigeria Labour (NLC) warned 
the GON that labor and civil society groups will call a 
nationwide strike beginning January 21 if the GON fails 
to rescind its proposed 1.50 naira per liter fuel tax 
before that date. Although the National Assembly has 
not approved the tax proposal (in fact, Obasanjo has 
deleted it from his budget request), the fuel tax or an 
equivalent levy is reportedly being charged at service 
stations throughout the nation.  Since issuing the 14- 
day ultimatum, labor has emphasized that its position 
includes an earlier demand that service stations sell 
fuel at the pre-October regulated price of 34 naira per 
liter.  Anthony Jones, the AFL-CIO Solidarity Center 
Country Director who is working closely with the NLC to 
avert a strike, told Laboff that \"mobilization\" is just 
beginning, suggesting that the Labor and Civil Society 
Coalition (LASCO) efforts will likely be much less 
organized than the nationwide strike in July 2003 and 
the \"mobilization\" campaign for a threatened strike in 
October. 
 
2.  Laboff spoke to NLC Deputy President Joseph 
Akinlaja on January 13 regarding the possible strike 
and asked him if the NLC would consider suspending the 
strike if the GON does not approve the tax.  Akinlaja 
said the NLC would continue mobilizing until fuel 
prices revert to the 34 naira per liter price.  Despite 
press reports and public perception that clearly 
focuses on the fuel tax or levy as the impetus for the 
mass action, Akinlaja contends that deregulation 
remains at the heart of the conflict.  He said LASCO, 
which is comprised of approximately fifty civil society 
groups, the NLC, and the Congress of Free Trade Unions 
(CFTU), is meeting around-the-clock to develop and 
implement a mobilization strategy to meet the January 
21 strike date.  Despite LASCO\'s widespread support, 
the Trade Union Congress (TUC), which includes the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of 
Nigeria (PENGASSAN), has not agreed to participate in 
the strike. 
 
3.  At the beginning of its mobilization efforts, the 
NLC held several unorganized and poorly attended pre- 
strike rallies on January 15.  Akinlaja, who spoke at 
an event in Ikeja, Lagos, told the audience that the 
NLC has put in place a plan that will ensure that the 
strike achieves its objectives.  These objectives 
include the call for the immediate lowering of the fuel 
price back to the 34 naira per liter.  Although 
Akinlaja did not comment on why the turnout at the much- 
publicized rally was unimpressive, he reiterated 
labor\'s commitment \"to give whatever it takes to force 
government to accede to the NLC\'s demands.\"  After the 
event, Labspec asked several labor leaders to respond 
to recent press reports that President Obasanjo had 
sent a letter to the National Assembly on January 14 
requesting that the fuel tax proposal be withdrawn from 
consideration.   These labor leaders contend that the 
President\'s letter was merely designed to deceive 
Nigerians.  They also claim that Obasanjo is attempting 
to distance himself from criticism while giving 
Nigerians time to adjust to de facto implementation of 
higher fuel prices. 
 
4.  Comment:  Months of strike threats followed by 
failed agreements between labor and the GON have taken 
a toll on the Nigerian public, making people less and 
less ready to answer labor\'s \"mobilization\" calls. 
While most Nigerians bitterly oppose the fuel tax, they 
are becoming less confident in the NLC\'s ability to 
lead in these types of \"quality of life\" issues.  NLC 
leaders recognize that their credibility has been 
severely damaged due to their decision to suspend 
previous strike actions in favor of GON-NLC negotiated 
agreements, which the GON has often failed to 
implement.  Desperately in need of a victory to sell to 
its constituents, the NLC may choose to strike, no 
matter what the GON does or does not do, merely to try 
to send a message to Obasanjo that the organization is 
still a major political player.  However, since labor 
is not prepared to sustain a strike and mobilization 
has been relatively weak, cooler heads within LASCO may 
choose to use Obasanjo\'s attempt to remove the fuel tax 
to claim victory and call off the strike.  This 
scenario is even more likely since labor leaders have 
told Laboff that they do not expect to win the battle 
over deregulation.  If the NLC decides to call the 
strike, Nigerians may stay home from work for a time 
but protests will likely be poorly attended, 
unorganized, and short-lived.  End comment.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECON, EFIN, EINV, ETRD, NI 
SUBJECT: HIGHER AND HIGHER: NIGERIA\'S MEANS OF 
FINANCING MEDIOCRE GROWTH 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Officers\' in-country travel, anecdotal 
evidence, and media commentary point to inordinately 
high and steadily rising prices in Nigeria.  People 
regularly complain that frequent increases in the cost 
of living and slow economic growth are hardly the 
dividends of democracy they expected after the demise 
of military rule.  Prices are high and getting higher, 
and real per capita economic growth has averaged little 
more than 3.5 percent per annum over the last five 
years.  The upward trend in prices has multiple causes 
and far-reaching effects, and we expect it to continue 
throughout this year and into the next.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Nigerians frequently complain of high prices and 
an ever-increasing cost of living.  Market traders 
wonder how to make ends meet, and businessmen and 
agricultural producers lament the high cost of doing 
business.  Even the relatively wealthy grumble about 
over-priced goods and perceive gradual increases in the 
overall price level.  Available data support their 
perceptions: the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) 
recently noted that inflation began to trend upward 
(from approximately 10 percent in August) in the fourth 
quarter of 2003 and expects average annual inflation to 
exceed 12.5 percent, a phenomenon driven primarily by 
rising food and domestic fuel prices coupled with loose 
fiscal and monetary policies.  The EIU is not wide of 
the mark: the Central Bank released data January 14 
indicating that the twelve month moving average rate of 
inflation rose from 10 percent in August to 12.3 
percent in October.  Annualized month-on-month 
inflation accelerated from 18.4 percent to 23.6 percent 
during the same period. 
 
3. (U) The rate of inflation in Nigeria is measured by 
movements in a composite urban and rural consumer price 
index (CPI), with the weights assigned to food and 
fuel/electricity representing 70 and 10 percent of the 
CPI basket of goods, respectively.  As such, changes in 
food and fuel prices drive changes in the overall 
index.  Food prices, in turn, are influenced by a 
variety of factors, including rainfall and other 
climatic conditions, wages, domestic inputs, and import 
prices.  As these rise and food prices increase, so too 
does the CPI and the average cost of living.  Changes 
in food prices may be the most noticeable indicators of 
rising prices, but increases in the overall price level 
- the rate of inflation - are related to a variety of 
factors that go beyond fluctuations in rainfall and 
agricultural productivity. 
 
4. (U) Inflation in Nigeria is also closely related to 
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies.  The EIU 
estimated Nigeria\'s 2003 federal budget deficit at 5.8 
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) or US$2.8 
billion (with Nigeria\'s 2003 real GDP estimated at 
US$48 billion at current prices).  To finance the 
deficit, the Government of Nigeria (GON) borrows 
domestically (it sells Treasury bills and recently 
introduced longer-term government bonds to the public) 
and internationally.  And borrow it does: the GON\'s 
domestic debt equals about 25 percent of GDP and is 
rising fast.  External debt stands at an estimated 
US$30.9 billion.  In attempts to keep the cost of 
government borrowing (or interest rates) at tolerable 
levels, the Central Bank often accommodates the central 
government by simply printing money to fund the 
deficit, especially when private investors choose not 
to buy government debt instruments.  The result is 
excess liquidity, which the Central Bank occasionally 
tries to mop up by raising interest rates.  Whether 
through the government\'s direct borrowing or the 
Central Bank\'s printing of money to accommodate a 
deficit, deficit financing tends to fuel inflation. 
 
5. (U) Government borrowing in Nigeria contributes to 
inflation: there is no doubt about that.  It keeps 
domestic interest rates up and thereby raises 
production costs and forecloses investment 
opportunities, especially in agriculture and 
manufacturing.  This is normally the outcome since 
little of the deficit spending finances productive 
investment.  The cost of money is thus relatively high: 
the Central Bank\'s minimum rediscount rate (MRR) alone 
is 15 percent.  By law, banks can charge interest rates 
equivalent to the MRR plus four, or 19 percent, but in 
reality, rates often reach 29 or 30 percent.  Thus, 
many businesses, particularly small and medium 
enterprises, find it difficult to secure financing. 
When they do, they incur significant expenses.  These 
are factored into production costs and reflected in the 
final prices of goods and services.  High interest 
rates may be less overt contributors to Nigeria\'s 
relatively high prices, but like the factors mentioned 
above, they raise the cost of doing business. 
 
6. (U) Inflation indicates a rising overall price 
level, but prices are high in and of themselves. 
Insufficient and poorly maintained infrastructure, 
particularly the lack of reliable road and railway 
networks, efficient communications systems, and an 
adequate power supply, increases the cost of doing 
business.  According to Nigeria\'s Ministry of Works, 
nearly 80 percent of the country\'s 140,000-km road 
network is in a state of disrepair.  The condition of 
the country\'s railway network is even worse: the three 
lines are in such poor shape, in fact, that trains 
rarely run.  The dismal state and limited reach of 
Nigeria\'s road and railway networks make the movement 
of goods time consuming and expensive, and delays at 
Nigeria\'s borders and ports of entry - particularly at 
the Lagos port complex - exacerbate the problem. 
Nigeria\'s fixed-line and mobile communications 
networks, too, are grossly inadequate.  The country\'s 
national operator has an installed capacity of fewer 
than 500,000 lines, and the country\'s four mobile 
service providers supply only 3 million lines to a 
population of 130 million consumers.  Inefficient 
communications systems raise the cost of doing 
business, as does the country\'s equally unreliable and 
inadequate power supply.  Nigeria\'s state-run National 
Electric Power Authority has an installed capacity of 
6,000 megawatts (MW) but typically distributes about 
half that, a quantity far short of the estimated 10,000 
MW the country needs.  Not surprisingly, frequent power 
outages force businesses to supply generators, fuel, 
and diesel storage tanks and raise production costs. 
 
7. (U) Added to this is Nigeria\'s dependence on 
imports.  The country imports virtually everything, 
including manufactured goods, capital equipment, fuel, 
and food items like dried fish and rice.  Once one of 
the world\'s leading exporters of palm oil, groundnuts, 
poultry, and other items, Nigeria now exports little 
more than crude oil.  Domestic producers cannot meet 
the demands of a large and growing population, so 
Nigerian consumers rely on relatively expensive 
imported goods and services.  Of course, imports become 
relatively more expensive as the value of the currency 
declines.  The naira was relatively stable (at 
approximately N120:US$1) during the first ten months of 
2003, but increasing demand for foreign currencies - 
particularly in the wake of the GON\'s decision to 
deregulate the downstream oil sector - pushed the naira 
to its lowest rate (approximately N140:US$1) in years. 
Given the Central Bank\'s declining reserves and limited 
ability to continue to defend the naira, the currency 
will likely depreciate further.  As a result, imports 
will become even more expensive, and complaints of high 
prices will likely grow louder. 
 
8. (U) Inadequate security and widespread corruption 
also raise costs.  In the absence of an effective and 
well-trained police force, businesses provide their own 
security - and spend heavily on private guards, fences, 
perimeter controls, and electronic surveillance 
systems.  Such precautions raise operating costs, as do 
the payoffs and kickbacks that many individuals 
consider an unavoidable cost of doing business in 
Nigeria.  For the third consecutive year Nigeria was 
named the world\'s second most corrupt country in 
Transparency International\'s 2003 Corruption 
Perceptions Index, and anecdotal evidence suggests that 
graft affects every sector of the economy.  Businessmen 
report paying bribes to clear imports through customs, 
lower their tax burdens, win operating permits or 
licenses, and cut through bureaucratic red tape.  Many 
consider bribes a means of getting things done quickly 
and easily: to resist, people think, is to invite 
unnecessary delays.  Payoffs may indeed be a means to 
an end, but they increase costs and perpetuate an 
already inefficient system. 
 
9. (U) Having run large deficits in 2002 and 2003 and 
anticipating a deficit of about 3 percent of GDP in 
2004, the GON will find it difficult to reduce 
expenditures while simultaneously meeting new 
commitments, particularly if oil prices (and government 
revenues) decline in 2004.  As a result, the GON\'s 
fiscal policy will likely remain expansionary, and it 
will either continue to borrow or attempt to finance 
the deficit by printing more money.  If it does the 
latter, the increased money supply will lead to an 
increase in the overall price level: as the supply of 
money relative to the supply of goods increases, or as 
more money chases the same quantity of goods, vendors 
will adjust their prices accordingly.  The overall 
price level will rise, and individuals will note an 
increasing cost of living. 
 
10. (U) Comment: Following years of military rule, 
Nigerians hoped, possibly against reason, that the 
civilian rule inaugurated in 1999 would quickly yield 
tangible dividends of democracy.  Instead, what they 
have experienced economically are high and seemingly 
ever rising prices.  Their hopes dashed, most Nigerians 
now seem resigned to double-digit inflation, which is 
nothing less than a disguised tax that hits the less 
well to do particularly hard.  Since these \"taxpayers\" 
are poorly organized and largely silent, we know of no 
reason why inflation should subside dramatically during 
the next two years.  The people who could provide 
relief are least likely to endorse policies that will 
erode their nominal income.  These people generally 
oppose devaluation of the naira, particularly since an 
over-valued naira lowers the cost of their imports. (It 
also renders non-oil exports less competitive, textile 
products being an example, and thus retards development 
of manufacturing.)  The elite also prefer trade bans to 
higher tariffs since bans are the currency of exchange 
for political support and thus directly benefit people 
with influence.  Lastly, everyone opposes personal 
income tax increases, largely because nobody believes 
that such revenues will be used for the common good. 
Under the circumstances, we expect double-digit 
inflation to continue to be the government\'s preferred 
means of financing what is likely to be mediocre growth 
during the foreseeable future.  End comment.

Classified By: Consul General Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) an

1. (U)  Anarchy reigns in the government of Anambra State. 
Since the challenged gubernatorial election in April 2003, 
the state has countenanced the July abduction of Governor 
Chris Ngige (reftel B), a state coup attempt, and the 
Governor\'s questioned resignation.  Everyone has accused 
everyone else of having been fraudulently elected.  At the 
federal level, multiple players, including President Olusegun 
Obasanjo and Vice President Abubakr Atiku, have tried to use 
the courts or the power of their political offices to shape 
the government of Anambra to their liking.  The 35 other 
governors in Nigeria have rallied to the defense of the 
beleaguered Ngige.  On January 12, Ngige won another round in 
the continuing tussle for control when a federal appeals 
court reinstated him by overturning an ex parte Enugu state 
court order that tried to strip Ngige of the governorship. 
The wrangling is not over.  The press screams daily 
accusations that federal government officials engineered the 
coup attempt in the first place, and that the President is 
using a weak and corrupt judicial system to accomplish what 
brute force and illegal action did not. 
 
The rule of law 
 
2. (U) According to the Nigerian Constitution, Governors are 
supposed to be the Chief Security Officers for their states. 
The crisis in Anambra is significant for all of Nigeria 
because there the Governor himself has been threatened, 
chased into hiding and assaulted by both the State Police and 
State Security Service (SSS) since the July coup attempt. 
President Obasanjo and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), 
have not moved to support Ngige and re-establish order in 
Anambra.  They claim to prefer a \"political settlement\" which 
has seen the party careen between supporting Ngige and/or his 
political \"godfather\", millionaire Chris Uba, who proudly 
proclaims that he bought the election of every winning 
politician in the state.  None of the coup plotters, 
including Uba, has been brought before a court, though many 
Nigerian jurists have said that their actions in July were 
clearly treasonous. 
 
3. (U)  At times, the godfather has had better protection 
than the Governor.  In both July and before the recent Enugu 
court ruling, Ngige\'s official State Police bodyguard details 
were called off leaving him vulnerable to repeated assaults 
and attempts on his life.  Based on his July experience, this 
time Ngige immediately went into hiding when his bodyguards 
deserted him, only to resurface under the protection of 
private guards and a favorable appeals court ruling. 
 
Nigerian democracy 
 
4. (C) Comment.  Nigeria is a tribal culture and accustomed 
to rule by \"chiefs\", \"big men\" or \"godfathers.\"  It is a 
long-deprived people now driven to acquiring as much money as 
possible as quickly as possible, and a people who accept 
payment of tribute and respect to a leader as an expected 
cost of doing business.  But while politics is business in 
Nigeria, the situation in Anambra is an aberration even for 
this country at its current stage of cultural, political and 
economic development. 
 
5. (C) Comment continued.  Last April, Nigeria completed its 
first successful election and transfer of 
civilian-to-civilian governments.  All observers admit there 
was electoral fraud, pay-offs and winners chosen by 
\"godfathers\", but the elections were held, the military did 
not intervene and the losers are still taking their 
complaints to the courts and not to the streets.  Therefore, 
the developments in Anambra are all the more galling to 
Nigerians who see that situation as a civilian coup 
unsanctioned by a Presidency responsible for ensuring that 
Constitutional rule is upheld.  In fact, critics allege, the 
President has encouraged and protected the culprits. 
Hypotheses about the President\'s role generally point to 
Nigeria\'s inescapable skein of personal patronage -- in this 
case the godfather\'s brother is part of Obasanjo\'s inner 
circle. Whatever the reason, Anambra is ground zero for the 
worst example of total disregard for rule of law in Nigeria 
today.  After years of ruthless and greedy military 
dictatorships, many Nigerians are determined to work within 
legal systems and to build democratic institutions.  But the 
tangled web of intrigue and political intimidation in Anambra 
makes a mockery of rule of law in Nigeria.

SUBJECT: SAA NAMED NIGERIAN EAGLE\'S TECHNICAL PARTNER 
 
REF: 03 LAGOS 2153 
 
1. (U) Summary: On Wednesday, January 14, GON officials 
announced the selection of South African Airways (SAA) 
as Nigerian Eagle Airlines\' technical partner. 
Executives close to the deal expect the new airline to 
replace Nigeria\'s ailing national carrier, Nigeria 
Airways Limited, later this year.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Competition for the position of technical 
partner was far from fierce: SAA was the only 
established international airline to answer the GON\'s 
November 17 call for expressions of interest in 
Nigeria\'s new flag carrier.  Even so, the airline\'s 
proposal was subject to a thorough evaluation. 
Executives at Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) 
Limited, the Lagos-based economic think tank acting as 
the project\'s financial advisors, compared SAA\'s 
operations to those of Lufthansa and report being 
\"impressed\" by SAA\'s technical and managerial capacity. 
They say the airline is capable not only of operating 
domestic and regional flights, but also of providing 
long-haul point-to-point services to London, Dubai, 
Saudi Arabia, and Johannesburg. 
 
3. (U) As Nigerian Eagle Airlines\' technical partner, 
SAA will exercise management control and direct the 
airline\'s day-to-day operations.  SAA is expected to 
purchase at least 30 percent of the carrier\'s $60 
million total equity, although FDC executives say SAA 
would like to control a slightly larger proportion. 
The financing, they say, has not been fully agreed, but 
they expect core investors to hold 40 percent of 
Nigerian Eagle Airlines and intend to offer the 
remaining 30 percent to individual shareholders in an 
initial public offering slated for late 2004 or early 
2005 (or shortly after the new carrier posts two 
consecutive quarters of earnings).  Nigerian Eagle 
Airlines will be wholly privately owned, but as 
Nigeria\'s designated flag carrier, it will acquire 
landing rights at major airports and gain access to the 
routes available under the GON\'s existing bilateral air 
services agreements. 
 
4. (U) Comment: Having found a reliable technical 
partner, one of the only things Nigeria\'s new flag 
carrier lacks is a group of core investors.  Finding 
them is FDC\'s next step.  Nigerian Eagle Airlines seems 
to have gotten off to a good start.  If it gets off the 
ground later this year, Nigeria\'s aviation industry 
should receive a substantial boost - and begin to 
repair a reputation badly damaged by Nigeria Airways\' 
failures.  End comment.

2.  Henry Seymour, spokesperson for World Airways, claims that 
although they were able to board 318 passengers, 39 passengers 
that originated in Lagos were left behind.  Seymour advised ACS 
Officer that there are no plans underway for World Airways to 
rescue the stranded 39.  When Post\'s expeditor went to Murtala 
Mohammed International Airport to ascertain the exact number and 
nationality of passengers that were left, none could be located. 
 
3.  As of 0900, Wednesday, January 21, 2004, 4 stranded 
passengers that missed the January 18 flight came into the 
Consulate seeking assistance in making flight arrangements to 
JFK.  The passengers claim they were in the East and were unaware 
of the World Airways flight.  Post will continue to assist any 
stranded World Airways passengers on an individual basis.

1. (SBU) Nigerians awoke to a state of confusion Wednesday, 
January 21, as competing reports circulated as to whether the 
Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) was continuing its call for a 
nationwide strike (ref A).  Although commerce continues 
across sectors, the NLC maintains that the strike is on, and 
some workers stayed home on Wednesday. 
 
2. (SBU) The NLC called for a strike to force the government 
to eliminate a 1.5 naira fuel \"tax\" recently imposed as part 
of President Obasanjo\'s 2004 budget request, and to roll back 
what the NLC claims are harmful aspects of the GON\'s 
downstream deregulation policy (ref B).  The NLC specifically 
demands that gasoline be sold at 34 naira per liter, as it 
was before the President announced on October 1, 2003, that 
the downstream sector would be henceforth deregulated (ref 
C). Since that date, gasoline prices have risen to 42 to 43 
naira per liter in Lagos, and higher in other regions. 
Black-market sales command much higher prices.  Union leaders 
maintained throughout Wednesday morning that a strike is 
being conducted, and NLC president Adams Oshiomhole is in 
Lagos for a strategy meeting scheduled for Wednesday 
afternoon (septel). 
 
---------------------- 
FUEL PRICES JANUARY 21 
---------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The GON has stated several times in recent days that 
the fuel tax has been rescinded, but the NLC insists it will 
not call off the strike until it has proof at the pump that 
the consumer price for gasoline has been lowered.  For its 
part, the GON stated that it has lowered prices at the two 
stations run by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC).  By mid-morning in Lagos, the price of gasoline at 
the NNPC station was 41 naira per liter.  But a survey of 
other stations, including Conoil, Mobil and Total, indicate 
that private retailers\' prices remain at 42.50 naira per 
liter.  Oando, formerly Unipetrol, is selling gasoline at 43 
naira per liter.  Private marketers told us they will pass 
the \"tax\" on as long as their shipments are charged the one 
naira-fifty levy at port (septel). 
 
4. (SBU) Consulate staff sent to monitor the situation 
reported at mid-morning that most fuel stations on Lagos\' 
mainland, where the bulk of Lagosians live, were not selling 
fuel.  They noted that some stations appeared to be staffed 
but not operating.  This may be due to confusion over whether 
the attendants, most of whom would be union members, should 
be on strike, or confusion over pricing.  It may also be a 
function of supply problems.  Tanker drivers are usually the 
first union members to go on strike, so supply may not have 
been delivered widely overnight.  Further, Nigeria continues 
to face a fuel supply crunch, which is being exacerbated by 
the threat and now possible execution of a strike (septel). 
Nonetheless, a Mobil station on the more exclusive Victoria 
Island, which was closed Tuesday late afternoon probably due 
to a lack of supply, was selling fuel Wednesday morning. 
Only a few cars queued for fuel Wednesday, whereas the line 
stretched for blocks Tuesday morning as drivers prepared for 
the strike. 
 
-------- 
AIRPORTS 
-------- 
 
5. (SBU) Union officials claim to have warned international 
airlines to avoid Nigerian airspace beginning January 21 
because of the strike, and on Wednesday morning union 
officials at the airport stated their workers were striking. 
However, consulate expediters at the Lagos international and 
domestic airport complex reported at noon that airline 
workers were at their desks, passengers moved through 
terminals in an orderly fashion, and flights appeared to be 
operating as scheduled, including the daily Virgin Atlantic 
flight to London. 
 
------------- 
OTHER SECTORS 
------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Executives with the nation\'s first and fourth 
largest banks told us that their branches are closed today, 
Wednesday, and would remain so until they can assess the 
situation.  It was widely reported that many Nigerians 
withdrew funds from banks Monday and Tuesday in order to have 
sufficient cash on hand to get through the strike. 
7. (SBU) Traffic was lighter than usual throughout Lagos, but 
transport vehicles and taxis, whose unionized drivers are 
usually at the forefront of strike actions, were plying the 
streets in fairly large numbers.  DHL and FEDEX had not 
delivered parcels as of noon.  Crude production does not seem 
affected. No violence has been reported. 
8. (SBU) Mission will continue reporting daily updates and 
specific septels as the situation warrants.

1.  (C) EST&H officer met on December 16 with a reluctant 
Deputy Director of Environment and Conservation, M. M. Omar 
(Protect) to discuss illegal trade in ivory in Nigeria as 
reported in a December 15, 2003 BBC article entitled, \"West 
Africa\'s Ivory Trade Thrives\".  According to Deputy Director 
Omar (a former IV grantee), Nigeria\'s air and seaports once 
had several regulatory agencies in place to monitor illegal 
exports of ivory.  Now, however, the agents have been removed 
because higher authorities reportedly found that air 
passengers had to traverse too many checkpoints and sometimes 
missed their flights.  He stated that a new law, currently 
under review, will add penalties and other features not 
addressed in the current law, and should go a long way toward 
reducing the illegal trade in ivory. 
 
2.  (C) The Deputy Director thought controlling ivory 
entering Nigeria from abroad was key.  He did not rule out 
illegal ivory finds in Nigeria nor would he name suspected 
cities where it is sold saying only that most of the tusks 
were not Nigerian.  However, a December 2003 report by the 
NGO, Traffic, stated that 40% of the illegal trade occurs in 
Lagos with other major markets in Abuja, Kaduna, and Kano and 
to a lesser extent in Benin City, Onitsha and Port Harcourt. 
An informal survey by EST & H officer of two markets in Lagos 
showed merchants openly displaying and selling ivory.  Ivory 
is reportedly a favorite commodity of diplomats and others 
from America, China, Italy, Japan and Korea according to 
Traffic.  Further, Chinese and Lebanese buy processed and raw 
ivory in bulk for shipment out of Nigeria.  Omar stated that 
Nigeria has many more than the 543 elephants the BBC said are 
living in its\' national parks, but the exact number is 
unknown.  According to Traffic, Nigeria has 478 elephants in 
the definite category, 340 in the possible category with 
another 300 in the speculative category. 
 
3. (C) Capacity building inside Nigeria and at the ports of 
entry is taking place, but Omar commented that the Ministry 
should move slowly to ensure that personnel are not only well 
trained but also honest and committed to their jobs. 
Environment classes are now part of Nigeria\'s university 
curricula and there is a School of Wildlife, so there is a 
considerable pool of unused but trained manpower.  The 
Ministry of Environment is working with conservation groups 
and other partners on building capacity and writing the new 
conservation law. 
 
4.  (C) Although he wanted to be more forthcoming, the Deputy 
Director stated that all information of a political nature 
involving the ivory trade must come from the Minister of the 
Environment or Permanent Secretary, and that as a civil 
servant, he could only address technical issues.  During an 
interruption in the meeting, Omar was told that he had 
another \"international visitor\" waiting.  He said he hoped it 
was not another call about the ivory trade because the issue 
has attracted added urgency since the above mentioned BBC 
news report. 
 
5.  (U) Background:  Nigeria became a party to the Convention 
on International Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (CITES) in 1975.  It enforces the Convention 
through its domestic Endangered Species Decree 11/1985 (now 
an act of the National Assembly), which addresses the 
issuance of import, export, re-export permits and 
certificates involving the trade and/or traffic in wild 
animals, plants and products.  One of the major obstacles to 
enforcement of the current and future law is the lack of 
coordination between implementing agencies.  According to the 
Traffic report, between 1989 and 2003 Nigeria was connected 
to 400 illegal seizures worldwide.  Based on its past 
problems, Nigeria must show compliance with Resolution Conf. 
10.10 (Rev.) by March 2004 or risk the suspension of trade in 
CITES listed species in and out of Nigeria.

SUBJECT: LASCO CALLS OFF STRIKE 
 
REF: Abuja 99 
 
1.  On January 21, shortly after the Labor and Civil Society 
Coalition (LASCO) began a nationwide strike to protest GON 
policies pertaining to petroleum pricing, NLC President 
Adams Oshiomhole made an official announcement to suspend 
the strike.  The announcement came before labor and civil 
society groups were scheduled to meet in Lagos to develop a 
strategy in preparation for a prolonged battle with the GON. 
 
2.  Motajo Abdul Kareem, Assistant Secretary for the 
National Union of Air Transport Employees, told Labspec that 
LASCO made the decision to ensure that the organization 
complies with a \"request\" from the Federal Appeals Court 
(reftel).  While the court made no definitive ruling on 
January 20 regarding a GON appeal contesting the NLC\'s right 
to strike, both parties were ordered to return to court on 
January 26 to argue their cases.  In the meantime, the court 
\"advised\" the GON to discontinue a 1.50 Naira per liter levy 
on imported fuel charged to oil marketers.  In turn, the 
court \"advised\" the NLC to suspend its strike pending a 
final ruling on the GON appeal. 
 
3.  Several hours before Oshiomhole\'s announcement, NLC 
Deputy President Joseph Akinlaja told Laboff that LASCO 
would only suspend the strike when lower prices resulting 
from the discontinued levy are reflected at the pump.  The 
NLC now fears that moving forward would be in violation of 
the Federal Appeals Court \"request,\" thus damaging its 
position when it returns to court for further argument on 
January 26.

SUBJECT:  DYNAMIC MLK DAY EVENT DRAWS 250 IN LAGOS 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  The Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (MLK) 
celebration in Lagos, Nigeria, drew over 250 people as 
well as local press to share an evening of speeches, 
artwork and music in commemoration of the late civil 
rights leader. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) The program, which featured U.S. speaker Dr. 
Walter E. Fluker, focused on the theme of \'successes\' 
and the application of legal civil rights victories in 
today\'s society.  These victories included the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
reflections on Brown v. the Board of Education 1954 
(Topeka, KS), as well as civil actions that supported 
the passage of these landmark public policy victories. 
 
3. (U) Dr. Fluker, who delivered a powerful speech on 
the need for moral leadership in developing society, 
was interrupted several times by applause as he drew a 
nexus between Nigeria\'s drive for civil rights and the 
struggle for equality in the United States.  Other 
notable speakers included the Charg  for the U.S. 
Mission to Nigeria, Rick L. Roberts and Lagos Consul 
General Robyn Hinson-Jones. 
 
4. (U) Upon entering the event, guests viewed a paper 
show highlighting prominent African-Americans.   The 
paper show featured Dr. King - as guests celebrated his 
legacy on the eve of the 75th Anniversary of his birth. 
 
5. (U) As the program commenced, we played audio 
vignettes of famous Dr. King speeches culminating in 
his passionate \'mountaintop\' address shortly before his 
assassination.  Guests, including international 
diplomats, Lagos business and political leaders, U.S. 
Consulate General personnel, local school 
administrators and the local media, later remarked on 
the effectiveness of this technique as an attention 
grabbing method to start the program. 
 
6. (U) In an effort to support the local arts and bring 
a new dynamic to the MLK Day celebration, the U.S. 
Consulate General, Lagos, commissioned a string art 
portrait of Dr. King which was officially unveiled at 
the start of the program.  The 4x4 piece of artwork, 
which garnered positive feedback from the audience, 
will be housed at the Lagos Public Affairs section but 
will also be utilized as part of African American 
History Month planning and programs. 
 
7. (U) Other program highlights included the appearance 
of well-known Nigerian Jazz singer Yinka Davies, who 
performed a rousing rendition of \"This Little Light of 
Mine\' for the event.   In addition to Davies, a local 
accapella group called The Pillars performed \'We Shall 
Overcome\" in English, Housa, Yoruba and Igbo. 
 
8. (U) At the conclusion of the program, guests were 
invited to socialize on the lawn of the Consul 
General\'s residence, where refreshments were served. 
 
9. (U) New to this year\'s program was the distribution 
of event evaluation forms.  Over 70 guests (almost 30 
percent of the total) completed all or part of the 
forms that will be used as a measuring tool to measure 
our effectiveness.  Additionally, the forms will enable 
more in-depth reporting to the Department of State on 
the effectiveness of Public Diplomacy Programming in 
Nigeria. 
 
10. (U) Result: Outstanding.  While press reports and 
assessment of media coverage is ongoing, this event was 
warmly received by those who attended.  The 
presentations and speeches were strengthened by the 
powerful oratory of Dr. Walter E. Fluker, who expressed 
his interest to the Cultural Affairs Officer in 
returning to Nigeria at a future date.  Guests were 
provided with new info-packs about Dr. King and the 
U.S. Civil Rights movement as they exited the venue, 
and those who took time to complete the event 
evaluation form also received a copy of Dr. King\'s 
famous \"American Dream\" speech.

1. (C) SUMMARY: While Nigerians try to determine if a 
national strike is on or off and whether or not there is a 
tax on gasoline (refs A, B), the country\'s fuel supply 
problems are not only clear, they are, in fact, worsening. 
Private marketers have scaled-back fuel imports in the face 
of business uncertainty, and a shortage of storage capacity 
has left much of the East of Nigeria without fuel. 
Meanwhile, international traders have reneged on GON orders, 
diverting cargo to more lucrative sales elsewhere.  Even 
while the GON insists deregulation is in effect, it continues 
to take actions that undermine the viability of a 
market-driven downstream sector, and may re-introduce a 
subsidized market scheme. Nigerians can expect fuel queues 
again by the end of January. END SUMMARY. 
 
-------------- 
TAX? WHAT TAX? 
-------------- 
 
2. (SBU) In late-December, President Obasanjo announced 
during the presentation of his budget request that the GON 
would assess a 1.50 naira per liter fuel levy.  According to 
the President, the income from this levy would be used to 
finance desperately needed road repairs, and accordingly, the 
system of poorly (and corruptly) managed tollbooths along 
Nigerian interstate highways would be dismantled.  As of 
January 1, fuel retailers charged the extra naira-fifty at 
the pump, and tollbooths were closed. 
 
3. (C) Labor, other civil society groups, and some 
legislators immediately assailed the measure and questioned 
the legality of what they dubbed a new \"fuel tax.\" (The 
National Assembly\'s House of Representatives Finance 
Committee Chairman, Alhaji Farouk Lawan, told EconCounselor 
January 21 that the President\'s 2004 budget submission 
specified that the Executive expected to raise 45 billion 
naira by the new \"fuel tax\" in 2004.)  In reality, the 
assessment was not a tax on fuel consumption, but rather a 
levy on fuel imports.  According to a Mobil executive, 
beginning on January 1, 1.5 naira was assessed on each liter 
of fuel marketers offloaded at the port of Lagos, and that 
amount was then passed on to consumers through the pump 
price. (Nigeria continues to import most of the fuel it 
uses.) GON representatives, including Funso Kupolokun, the 
Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC), publicly defended the propriety of the 
measure as an existing levy that merely lapsed in 
enforcement, and not a new tax requiring legislative approval. 
 
4. (SBU) With a Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) strike threat 
looming larger, the GON began backing away from its 
commitment to the levy by the second week of January.  The 
President went so far as to state in a letter to the National 
Assembly that the implementation of the \"tax\" was unintended; 
he merely meant to highlight a policy option.  On January 20 
a federal court \"advised\" that the fuel tax be rescinded (ref 
C), and the GON soon insisted it no longer assessed the levy. 
 As proof, the GON said the pump prices at the two fuel 
stations operated by NNPC, one in Abuja and one in Lagos, had 
reverted to pre-levy prices.  In fact, by Wednesday, January 
21, the pump price at NNPC\'s station in Lagos had decreased 
by 1.50 naira. 
 
5. (C) Jules Harvey, Texaco International\'s Vice President 
for West Africa, told Econoff on January 20 that the 
Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) sent a 
notice to marketers in late December explaining the levy and 
how it would be assessed by the Department of Petroleum 
Resources (DPR).  Harvey said that his company would consider 
the levy in effect until informed otherwise by PPPRA.  A 
union official told Labatt that GON representatives 
specifically told  union representatives a letter signed by 
President Obasanjo rescinding the levy was sent to marketers 
in recent days.  As of January 21, private marketers\' pump 
prices in Lagos were one naira-fifty or more higher than the 
NNPC price, suggesting such letters had not been received, or 
that marketers were still trying to recoup the cost of the 
levy already paid on existing fuel stock. 
 
------------------------------------ 
SUPPLY TIGHT, AND ONLY GETTING WORSE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C) We previously reported that Nigeria\'s fuel supply was 
tight due to infrastructure problems, poor business 
practices, and government regulation (ref D).  According to 
Texaco\'s Harvey, private fuel marketers are importing only 
about 20 percent of the fuel now on the market, with NNPC 
importing the remaining 80 percent. (Harvey said that private 
marketers have been importing an average of 10 cargoes per 
month since October.) Harvey previously estimated that this 
combined volume represents only about 55 percent of Nigeria\'s 
current market demand.  Harvey says his Texaco stations in 
the East and Northeast of Nigeria are almost always closed 
for lack of supply.  Texaco and other private marketers have 
little or no storage capacity in those regions, and the 
volume of imports is insufficient to maintain a supply chain 
via tanker trucks from Lagos (the poor state of roads in the 
South and East also contribute to transport difficulties). 
Harvey said he has discussed this matter with GON officials, 
who have suggested that private marketers may be able to 
lease storage tanks from NNPC at some point in the future. 
 
----------------------- 
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) Harvey noted that NNPC will likely run short of fuel 
by the end of January.  He said international traders of fuel 
have reneged on contracts with NNPC to bring fuel to Nigeria. 
 Harvey said traders who agreed to NNPC purchase offers in 
2003 are now facing losses as high as one million dollars per 
cargo on those contracts due to higher-than-expected crude 
prices and high winter demand for petroleum products in the 
U.S. The traders are diverting cargoes slated for Nigeria to 
more lucrative ports.  Such international market forces, 
combined with ongoing refinery problems, leave Nigeria with 
an almost identical fuel shortage situation it faced during 
the first two months of 2003, when fuel queues returned to 
the country after a three year hiatus (ref E). 
 
8. (C) Harvey said NNPC\'s Kupolokun has decried the practice 
of diverting cargoes, and threatened to blacklist traders who 
breach contracts with NNPC, insisting the GON will never do 
business with such companies in the future.  When asked if 
the international traders simply don\'t care if they are 
blacklisted by Nigeria or face penalties for breach of 
contract, Harvey said it is not that they don\'t care, but 
when assessing their options, they choose not to lose a 
known, large quantity of money in the short-term.  Harvey 
noted that such a choice is made easier given the GON\'s 
history of blacklisting companies only to reinstate their 
privileges after intercessions from a Nigerian state governor 
or other interested party. 
 
---------------------- 
THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) Harvey also told Econoff that Kuplokun and Obasanjo 
himself have met with marketers in recent weeks to continue 
ironing out downstream deregulation; Kupolokun actually came 
to Harvey\'s office in Lagos in mid-January. Harvey says that 
Kupolokun has tried to win concessions from the private 
marketers over pricing, and even tried to persuade them to 
absorb the fuel levy without passing the cost on to consumers 
at the pump.  Nonetheless, Harvey said both men generally 
agree with the marketers\' assertion that the companies 
should not be expected to operate in Nigeria at a loss. 
Harvey said Obasanjo, while appearing sympathetic to the 
business realities of the marketers, also expressed his 
frustration over the pressures he faces to scale-back 
deregulation.  Harvey said Kupolokun is clearly still in line 
with Obasanjo\'s thinking on this issue, but is forced by 
political realities to try to negotiate concessions regarding 
price caps and profit margins.  Harvey described Kupolokun as 
\"very good and straight forward\" as NNPC\'s chief executive, 
still capable of pressing forward with deregulation. 
 
10. (C) Harvey noted one option floated by the GON that 
smacks of pre-October government encumbrance of the 
downstream sector.  He said some GON officials have suggested 
that to maintain the semblance of deregulation  during this 
period of tumultuous world prices and domestic unions 
challenges, private marketers would be encouraged to continue 
importing fuel by having NNPC purchase their cargoes at 
market rates.  Under this plan, NNPC would then sell the fuel 
back to the marketers at a reduced price, which would be 
passed on to consumers.  In effect, the GON would return to 
subsidized fuel sales, artificial pricing, and a closely 
regulated downstream sector.   Harvey did not say how 
seriously this option is being considered by either the GON, 
or the industry.

1. (U) Summary: South Africa\'s Vodacom Group recently 
announced plans to purchase a 51 percent stake in 
Nigeria\'s second largest mobile service provider, 
Econet Wireless Nigeria Limited.  The US$250 million 
deal represents Econet\'s best chance of overtaking its 
one major competitor, MTN Nigeria Communications 
Limited, but neither Vodacom nor Econet will be able to 
move forward until outstanding legal issues are 
resolved.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) South Africa\'s Vodacom Group is poised to take 
control of Nigeria\'s second largest mobile service 
provider, Econet Wireless Nigeria Limited.  Vodacom 
agreed in principle to a $250 million purchase of a 51 
percent stake in the company in mid-December, and the 
two signed a management agreement shortly thereafter. 
Vodacom technical experts are now surveying Econet\'s 
mobile network and making plans to improve service 
quality, and company executives are preparing for an 
unprecedented expansion.  They expect to match western 
quality of service standards in three to six months. 
 
3. (U) Vodacom\'s infusion of cash is a boon for Econet: 
with access to hundreds of millions of dollars of 
additional financing, its chronic money problems may 
become a thing of the past.  And with a steady supply 
of funds, it should be able to build the network 
company executives have dreamed about.  Econet has long 
maintained that its network is superior to that of its 
one major competitor, MTN Nigeria Communications 
Limited, and company executives hope that by providing 
more extensive and better quality service, their firm 
will ultimately become the dominant player in Nigeria\'s 
mobile communications industry.  The gap between the 
two, according to one of Econet\'s chief executives, is 
a mere 370,000 active subscribers. 
 
4. (U) Unfortunately, neither Vodacom nor Econet will 
be able to move forward until outstanding legal issues 
are resolved.  Vodacom\'s mid-2003 expression of 
interest prompted Econet\'s parent company, Econet 
Wireless International (EWI), to seek an injunction in 
Nigeria\'s courts to stop the deal, alleging that by 
entertaining and then accepting Vodacom\'s offer, Econet 
was reneging on an agreement to let EWI increase its 
stake in the company from 5 to 33 percent via a US$150 
million equity injection.  When Nigeria\'s high court 
failed to appoint an arbitration panel within a 
stipulated sixty-day period, EWI took its case even 
further: it applied to the United Nations Commission on 
International Trade for arbitration and sued Vodacom 
for breach of contract, arguing that the firm induced 
Econet to violate its agreement with EWI. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: No one is sure what the dispute\'s 
outcome will be, but Vodacom executives have come up 
with a clever means of circumventing the issue. 
According to one executive, Econet will likely transfer 
its global system for mobile communications (GSM) 
license, network, and subscribers to a newly created 
Vodacom Nigeria, a move that would leave Econet nothing 
more than a shelf company equipped to fight legal 
battles.  If the plan works, Vodacom could expand 
freely - and its entry into the Nigerian 
telecommunications market could create remarkable 
waves, particularly since it faces only one other major 
player.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NEW YEAR OFFERS NO REPRIEVE FROM DELTA VIOLENCE 
 
REF: 2003 LAGOS 2193 
 
Classified By: R. HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. The New Year has so far offered Nigeria\'s 
Delta region little reprieve from the violence that marked 
2003.  Recent incidents reflect heightened tensions in the 
Warri area, and ethnic clashes remain a constant possibility. 
 While it was hoped that attempts at dialogue between the 
warring groups would sow seeds of promise, the Ijaws and the 
Itsekiris are each becoming factionalized internally and 
leaders are finding it difficult to reign in the disaffected. 
 The Urhobo may also become more violent. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) On January 8, a group of Itsekiri attacked boats 
carrying Ijaw traveling to a local market. Newspapers 
reported 18 deaths, and private security consultants in the 
Warri area told us it was likely that at least 10 Ijaw were 
killed. As usual, details remain largely uncorroborated, as 
reports from the area are sketchy, contradictory, and prone 
to exaggeration.  For example, an Itsekiri activist group 
issued a press release soon after the incident describing a 
nearly reverse-image of what now appears to be the truth; the 
group claimed that Ijaw militants in speed boats attacked and 
killed 18 Itsekiri returning home from a celebration.  All 
other sources indicate an Itsekiri militant youth group named 
the Gallant Boys killed Ijaw villagers.  The Gallant Boys, 
ostensibly operating independently, had not been known for 
violent attacks prior to this incident.  Ijaw leaders have 
appealed for calm and claim they will refrain from a 
retaliatory attack, unless further provoked.  In a separate 
incident, Ijaw activists held a press conference on January 
13 stating that a group of Itsekiri attacked an Ijaw boat and 
kidnapped an Ijaw traditional chief. 
 
3. (U) Over the weekend of January 17, ethnic Itsekiri from 
the village of Obonti reportedly clashed with ethnic Urhobo 
from the neighboring village of Ugbokurusu located outside 
Sapele.  No deaths have been reported.  The two communities 
have been fighting since 1999 over a nearby oil well.  In 
2001 the Urhobo attacked Obonti, so this recent attack by the 
Itsekiri may have been in retaliation.  An Itsekiri youth 
leader disappointed with the violence told us he believes 
that the dispute had already been settled, and questioned 
whether Itsekiri elders failed in not resolving the issue 
through dialogue earlier.  The youth reported that leaders 
have condemned the attack and called for calm, highlighting 
the Itsekiri\'s gratefulness to the Urhobo who help shelter 
thousands of displaced Itsekiris around Sapele. 
 
4.  (C) Dennis Amachree, security manager for Halliburton, 
reported that tension has increased, with a risk that further 
clashes between these groups could spread along the main 
highway between Warri and Benin City. Thousands of Itsekiri 
displaced by violence from their villages in the riverine 
area of the Delta have been living for the past year in and 
around Sapele, which is largely an Urhobo community.  This 
situation differs from that of the past several months in 
that an outbreak of violence in Sapele, a modestly developed 
town connected to the outside world by roads, power and 
telecommunications, could spread far more quickly than 
clashes occurring in villages isolated deep in the swamps. 
 
5. (U) On January 15, soldiers assigned to Joint Task Force 
Operation Restore Hope reportedly engaged militant Ijaw youth 
in a gun battle while conducting a \"cordon and search\" 
operation in the village of Bomadi. One of the tasks of 
security forces in the Delta is to disarm the warring ethnic 
factions, which the Task Force tries to do by means of 
occasional village-level sweeps and house-to-house searches. 
Newspaper accounts quoted Bomadi residents as saying 10 
militants were killed during the January 15 incident, while a 
military spokesman was quoted as saying one militant and one 
soldier were killed. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT: These latest incidents may indicate a new 
boldness on the part of the Itsekiri, who told Mission staff 
several months ago that they were growing increasingly 
resentful of being displaced from their homes and would 
return to what they consider their traditional lands by 
whatever means necessary (reftel).  The Gallant Boys may be 
driving this new wave of violence; if so, it may signify the 
emergence of greater factionalization amongst the Itsekiri. 
Should the Itsekiri around Sapele clash more frequently with 
their neighbors, we are likely to see more militancy among 
the Urhobo, who, of the three ethnic groups vying for power 
and representation in the Delta, have thus far been the least 
involved in violence.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: WHY IS NIGERIA SO EXPENSIVE? 
 
REF:  Lagos 00115 
 
1. (U) Summary: From ICASS to inspectors, anyone 
monitoring the cost of living in Nigeria should be 
warned that Nigeria is getting more expensive every 
day.  Diplomatic and international management officers 
are particularly frustrated by prices that play havoc 
with any organization\'s plans.  Why do we pay so much 
more each year for what seems like so much less?  This 
cable explains why Nigeria\'s rise in prices in 2004- 
2005 will outstrip this year\'s budget.  End summary. 
 
Show Us the Money 
----------------- 
 
2. (U) Wage increases have been federally mandated over 
the last four years for all Nigerians, but inflation 
has moved faster.  Since 1999, for example, the U.S. 
Mission to Nigeria\'s staff have benefited from a 20 
percent generalized cost of living increase, just about 
the increase that foreign missions were required by 
Nigerian law to give to their personnel during 1999- 
2003.  During the same period, the all-urban consumer 
price index rose 62 percent.  What we have seen at post 
is typical of what we are seeing now: wages are rising, 
but inflation is eroding purchasing power.  The 
convergence of extra income, scarce capital investment 
in th non-oil sector, and stagnant productivity has 
jaked up prices without improving living standards. 
 
3. (U) Prices are rising, in large part because 
Nigerian manufacturers are not competitive and canot 
meet levels of dmestic demand that outstripsupply. 
Inadequate infrastructure makes their operating costs 
too high relative to those of neighboring states. 
Domestic entrepreneurs invest little in plants and 
equipment because the country\'s manufacturing 
utilization rate barely clears 40 percent. 
Entrepreneurs also know that Nigeria\'s government 
budget deficits drive interest rates up while reducing 
the number of potentially profitable investment 
projects.  Wary private investors thus channel their 
surplus funds to debt instruments paying high interest 
rates instead of risky capital investments that might 
raise manufactured output.  Expenditures on physical 
insecurity and corruption add to rising prices. 
 
Not Only Fish or Fowl 
--------------------- 
 
4. (U) Nigeria is so import dependent that Nigerian, 
diplomatic, and international organization management 
officers can never expect a respite from rising prices. 
The country imports virtually everything, from 
manufactured goods, capital equipment, and fuel to 
everyday food items like dried fish and rice.  From 
1999 to 2003, the value of manufactured imports rose 42 
percent while the volume of such goods increased by 
much less.  In a backlash against imported goods, the 
GON has published an ever-growing list of banned items 
despite knowing that the ever-resilient import sector 
will smuggle in whatever will sell.  But smuggling 
isn\'t cheap and no shopper will be immune to the added 
cost of picking up the smuggler\'s tab. 
 
5. (U) Energy costs have most probably doubled since 
1999.  Despite Nigeria\'s position as a major oil 
exporter, its barely functioning refineries force 
Nigeria to import much of its petrol at world prices. 
The price of energy products affects operating costs 
directly and indirectly.  Refined petroleum products 
(gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricants, etc.) have risen 
about 90 percent since 1999, and that rise has had a 
substantial cumulative ripple effect on every sector of 
the economy that uses transportation - from mopeds to 
Mercedes. 
 
Stand By, Please 
---------------- 
 
6. (U) Not a day passes in Lagos without power being 
cut by the National Electric Power Authority.  Without 
a steady supply of electricity, the din of the ever- 
present generators at every middle and upper class 
residence and most businesses is the sound of the city. 
The cost of electric power in Nigeria relative to its 
neighbors is excessively high as a percent of operating 
costs.  Estimates indicate that the differential is 
plus thirty percent if not more.  Virtually all 
enterprises, public and private, need backup generators 
for emergency power.  The wear and tear of constant 
power outages prematurely ages equipment, and the early 
repair or replacement compounds the cost of running 
every enterprise. Even Lagos\' roadside barbers charge 
more for a haircut when their mini-generators must be 
used. 
 
What Price Safety, Corruption 
----------------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) The woeful state of Nigeria\'s roads raises the 
cost of operating and maintaining vehicles, probably by 
a factor of two, relative to what it would be if the 
roads were well maintained.  Post\'s experience shows 
that our vehicles break down twice as fast as they 
should.  Moreover, the cost of operating our fleet is 
high since security vehicles must often accompany our 
employees due to violent crime on the roadways.  Our 
high security costs are not limited to safeguarding 
vehicles.  Ensuring the physical security of almost 
every home and workplace calls for a private guard 
force.  Year by year, the contract price for a constant 
number of guards rises, largely because of the reasons 
adduced above.  This Mission\'s guard contract called 
for 325,185,337 naira in 2000; in October 2004, the 
figure will be 456,365,286.  The increase is a whopping 
40 percent. 
 
8. (U) Of course, not all crimes are violent, but 
virtually all forms of crime fuel rising costs. 
Corruption in all sectors of the economy imposes 
additional costs.  We cannot quantify these with 
respect to our operation, but suppliers doubtless pass 
on to us part of these \"transactions\" costs as they 
relate to their dealings with third parties.  Moreover, 
management officers and businessmen operating in 
Nigeria find themselves hiring additional staff to 
ensure that no Nigerian employee has central control 
over materials, money or hiring.  Nigeria\'s 
dysfunctional system of administration compels rational 
organizations to divide resources to conquer temptation 
to steal money, misappropriate resources and materiel, 
and thwart hiring practices based on family or ethnic 
ties rather than competency.  While American business 
practices focus on efficiency by doing more with the 
necessary less, doing business in Nigeria requires 
having abundant material and human resources to deliver 
basic services, absorb inefficiencies, mitigate 
misappropriation, and install checks and balances to 
counter corruption and theft. 
 
9. (U) Comment: Like every other business in Nigeria, 
the cost of goods and services that Mission Nigeria 
will provide to its employees and clients in 2004 will 
cost at least 12.5 percent more than it did in 2003. 
Meeting the rising cost of living and doing business in 
Lagos perplexes even the most thrifty management 
officer or businessman.  In this season of Mission 
Program Plan preparation, we are keenly aware that 
accomplishing our goals for Africa\'s most populous 
country will be ever more costly as Nigeria becomes 
less efficient and more expensive.  End comment.

STATE PASS TO EXIM AND TDA 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ENRG, EINV, PGOV, TRGY, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S POWER SECTOR PRIVATIZATION 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED 
 
1.  (U) Summary: The head of Nigeria\'s National 
Electric Power Authority (NEPA) told Embassy staff 
January 22 that the GON has begun unbundling the state- 
owned electric power monopoly to privatize the company, 
even before a power sector reform bill is passed into 
law. A dearth of managers experienced in the new 
processes that the parastatal company is implementing 
is slowing progress.  Foreign investment and capacity 
building is needed. End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) On Thursday January 22, EconCounselor and 
EconSpecialist met with Joseph Makoju, Managing 
Director of the Nigerian National Electric Power 
Authority (NEPA), who confirmed that the unbundling of 
NEPA in advance of its privatization started on January 
1, 2004.  The first step was to make its ten 
distribution centers nationwide semi-autonomous. The 
heads of the distribution centers are now referred to 
as Chief Operating Officers (COOs) and are responsible 
for day-to-day operation of the centers, while NEPA 
headquarters sets revenue targets and supervises the 
COOs.  They report directly to NEPA\'s Managing 
Director. NEPA\'s executive directors for distribution 
and transmission monitor the performance of the 
autonomous units.  Revenue targets have been set for 
the distribution centers, and NEPA hopes to raise the 
service fee collection rate from 60 to 80 percent 
within the year. 
 
3.  (SBU) Makoju hopes that improved performance of the 
distribution centers in the next six to twelve months 
will help ensure NEPA\'s self-sufficiency to meet its 
liabilities and embark on new projects, such as 
replacement of old and faulty transmission lines. He 
opined that although the Federal Government provides 
NEPA with capital for some transmission projects, that 
funding stream will dry up given the government\'s 
\"irrevocable\" plan to privatize NEPA. 
 
4.  (SBU) According to Makoju, NEPA plans to grant 
autonomy to the transmission centers in the second 
quarter of 2004, while the six generating plants will 
be floated as private companies.  He did not specify 
when the generation plants would be granted autonomy. 
He confirmed that NEPA headquarters is undergoing 
restructuring. The headquarters is being reduced. 
After autonomy is granted the various units, much of 
the staff will be deployed to the field. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Independent Power Projects: the Burden of the Dollar 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (SBU) Makoju admitted that more investments are 
needed to improve the transmission lines, and that 
independent power projects (IPPs) would go a long way 
toward improving power generation. He confirmed that 
NEPA has received IPP proposals, but it is exercising 
caution in entering into agreements.  Since the 
contracts would be dollar denominated, it would be 
\"suicidal,\" he said, to enter into such agreements 
given current collection rates, low power rates or 
tariffs, and the continuing depreciation of the naira 
against the dollar. 
 
6. (SBU) Makoju said AES Corporation\'s IPP in Lagos 
supplies about 10 percent of the power to NEPA\'s 
national grid, for which AES receives about 20 percent 
of the total revenue accruing to NEPA. He said the 
agreement is a huge burden on NEPA\'s finances, now in 
very bad shape. Since NEPA pays AES in dollars, the 
naira\'s depreciation has made this agreement a losing 
proposition for NEPA. Makoju disclosed that NEPA is 
negotiating with AES to restructure the agreement. 
 
7. (SBU) Makoju opined that if the tariff were raised 
to economic levels and reviewed yearly to incorporate 
the reality on the ground, private companies would 
invest in Nigeria\'s power sector. He asserted there is 
huge investment potential. 
 
------------------------------------ 
NEPA Wants Help In Capacity Building 
------------------------------------ 
 
8. (SBU) Makoju said NEPA needs assistance in capacity 
building.  The unbundling exercise is leading to use of 
new and complex processes, such as transfer pricing, in 
which NEPA staff have little experience. Makoju 
appealed for continued assistance from USAID/NEXANT to 
complete the process. He hopes the USG and U.S. 
companies will show more interest in it, particularly 
as unbundling and privatization evolves. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment. Although NEPA\'s privatization is a 
huge task, it is a prerequisite to jumpstarting 
Nigeria\'s ailing economy, bedeviled as it is by the 
problem of poor infrastructure. If the power sector can 
be made more efficient, it will improve industry 
capacity utilization, which has long been conditioned 
by inadequate electric power. Since business firms in 
Nigeria depend on generators to provide power and use 
power from NEPA as a back up when available, this 
raises production costs and thus renders Nigerian 
products non-competitive in international markets. 
 
10. (SBU) A proposed Power Sector Reform Bill must be 
passed into law to give legal backing to NEPA\'s 
unbundling and privatization. Such a law would offer 
comfort to potential investors in the sector. In the 
absence of more action this year, the Obasanjo 
administration\'s efforts to reorganize NEPA may simply 
add to the number of failed privatizations in Nigeria 
in recent years. End comment.

Anambra - New twists in the continuing crisis 
 
1. (U)  The crisis of the Governor vs. the \"godfather\" 
continues to grind on in Anambra State.  There have been 
accusations that the GON, namely President Olusegun Obasanjo, 
is doing nothing to bring peace and order to Anambra, and, in 
fact, may be the main force stirring up trouble for Governor 
Chris Ngige.  Possibly in response to those charges, Senate 
President Adolphus Wabara has attempted to broker a truce 
between Ngige and his \"godfather\", millionaire Chris Uba. 
Wabara brought the two opponents together twice, in December 
and last week, along with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 
officials, prominent members of the Igbo community and local 
traditional rulers. The result of these meetings was the 
so-called \"Owerri Peace Accords\", reported to be heavily 
weighted in Uba\'s favor, but which allowed Ngige to remain in 
office. 
 
2. (U) Neither side respected the agreement.  Uba immediately 
got a friend on the high court in Enugu State to issue an 
order ousting Ngige from office.  The Ngige faction persuaded 
the Appeals Court to reverse the Enugu court and the Governor 
celebrated by choosing his own Deputy Governor -- in 
contravention of the \"Peace Accords\" which had given Uba the 
right to pick the Deputy Governor.  Meanwhile, back in the 
Senate, Wabara was swearing in a hand-picked \"Implementation 
Committee\" for the \"Peace Accords.\" 
 
3. (U) All parties are behaving as if the crisis has been 
resolved in their respective favors.  The Inspector General 
of Police, Tafa Balogun, continues to resist all demands that 
he restore Ngige\'s police bodyguard that was taken from him 
by the Enugu court order.  Ngige travels around Anambra and 
Abuja with private bodyguards and is much photographed doing 
his gubernatorial duties -- handing out prizes at high 
schools, attending important weddings and funerals, 
appointing his cabinet.  Sometimes, he drives himself because 
he doesn\'t trust anyone to do it for him. Yesterday, his 
armored car reportedly broke down.  Uba, after a short 
vacation abroad, is back pulling strings and, allegedly, 
attempting to pay off federal legislators to get them to 
declare a state of emergency in Anambra and put him in power. 
 There are new players and court decisions every day and no 
final resolution in sight. 
 
Anambra - Police action: good, bad and otherwise 
 
4. (U) Inspector General Balogun announced January 27 the 
discovery of a large cache of illegal guns in the huge and 
sprawling Onitsha market.  The guns were discovered during 
the capture of six men described as burglars and two others 
said to be \"arms dealers.\"  Along with the guns, police 
discovered blank gun license forms and blank Nigerian 
international passports.  A police spokesman told the 
Guardian newspaper that the police are not yet certain what 
the guns and official forms were being stockpiled for, but 
that \"it was generally believed that they might be intended 
for no good.\"  Balogun issued a statement praising the 
Anambra police units and in the same statement said that his 
new program to fight corruption in the police force had 
resulted in the firing or prosecution for corruption of 
almost 900 policemen nationwide.  Sixty-five will be tried 
for extorting money (\"dash\") from motorists.  The saga 
continues.

SUBJECT: EKITI UPDATE: HIS AND HER EXCELLENCIES 
 
REF: 2003 LAGOS 2349 
 
1. (U) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governor Peter Ayodele 
Fayose and his wife Feyisetan of tiny, impoverished Ekiti 
State have had their Public Relations Director working 
overtime recently to \"spin\" them a high-profile, positive 
public image. The couple has been appearing almost weekly in 
newspaper \"personality\" pieces proclaiming undying love and 
admiration for each other, and extolling the power of prayer 
to solve all problems, governmental and personal. 
 
2. (U) On the darker side, Her Excellency (Mrs.) Fayose, as 
she prefers to be called, has somehow escaped an NGO suit 
against 26 \"first ladies\" which includes the wives of the 
president, vice president and at least six of the 36 
governors.  The ladies are 
being accused of fraud and corruption for the misuse of funds 
through \"foundations\" set up in their names.  Although she 
has no verified training or experience in any field, one of 
the first things Mrs. Fayose did when her husband took office 
was to set up the \"Fayose Foundation,\" which is said to be 
involved in health care, education, services for the elderly, 
entrepreneurial 
programs, etc. (Reftel).  She claims that her education 
program and program to feed people with HIV/AIDS has already 
lowered the number of HIV/AIDS sufferers in Ekiti State -- 
although she does not say how the patients were identified, 
how many there were or are now, and, most important, how her 
\"Foundation\" is financed. 
 
Fighting to save his office 
 
3. (U) For his part, His Excellency is fending off lawsuits 
on several fronts.  The most important suit was brought in 
the Elections Tribunal by the Alliance for Democracy Party 
(AD) shortly after Fayose was elected in April.  This suit 
charges that Fayose presented falsified documents when he 
registered to become a candidate.  The case has been 
dismissed or postponed on technicalities three times.  When 
the Tribunal finally sat to hear the case on January 27, the 
courtroom was invaded by armed \"thugs believed to have been 
sponsored by top politicians\" according to police reports. 
The police, who had been dealing with violence between the AD 
and PDP supporters since Fayose\'s election, were prepared and 
out in force around the courthouse.  They were able to disarm 
the protesters and force them from the courtroom.  The trial 
was postponed. 
 
4. (U) When the trial resumed on February 3, the court wanted 
to know why the diplomas and school certificates Fayose had 
presented as a candidate were for a \"Peter Ayodele Oluwayose\" 
and not Peter Ayodele Fayose.  Fayose\'s father testified that 
in 1974 God had told him to change the family name to 
\"Oluwayose\" or he would die.  The Governor swore that he only 
changed his name back to Fayose in 1994, and for this reason, 
all his school records are in the name \"Oluwayose.\"  Lawyers 
for the AD presented results from an investigation they said 
showed \"Oluwayose\" was actually a person who lived in Ibadan 
in Oyo State and was the owner of the diplomas and school 
certificates.  They further pointed out that Fayose was 
unable to present any document at all, such as a passport or 
driver\'s license, showing that he had used the name 
\"Oluwayose\" at any time prior.  A decision is expected soon 
from the Tribunal. 
 
5. (U) The Governor is also being sued for 5 billion naira by 
Omegabank for damages to its business reputation.  The bank 
had been the Ekiti State\'s central bank since the State was 
created.  State funds were deposited with Omegabank and the 
bank says it frequently provided loans to the State when it 
was short of funds and paid State employees directly.  In 
January, Fayose removed all State funds from Omegabank and 
alleged that the bank had been over-charging the State 
government 500 million naira per year in fees from the 
beginning of their relationship and was now refusing to 
negotiate to reduce the fees.  The bank countered saying 
that, shortly after assuming office, Fayose had demanded that 
the bank hire some of his relatives and, most importantly, 
that the bank accept his uncle, one Adabayo Brown, as the 
chairman of its board of directors. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment.  This is just one example of the sometimes 
farcical nature of state governance Nigerian-style that says 
much about this fledgling democracy.  While many politicians 
\"just don\'t get it\" when it comes to transparency, NGOs, 
civic organizations and businesses do.  Bringing suit against 
State Governors and first ladies is a step in the direction 
of demanding accountability from politicians.  But only when 
the political high jinks result in certain losses at the 
ballot box, will Nigerians begin to see some of the dividends 
of democracy in governance.  Unfortunately, that is still a 
long way off.

Classified By: Consul-General Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) an 
 
d (d) 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On February 3 POLOFF visited quarry sites 
in Ogun State where trafficked Beninese children had been 
rescued in September and October 2003 (reftel).  POLOFF was 
accompanied by Bose Akinola of the NGO Voice of Women in 
Africa and members of the Women\'s Consortium of Nigeria 
(WOCON).  The visit uncovered the grisly working conditions, 
the lack of resources for NGOs and GON law enforcement 
combating trafficking, and the reason why trafficking 
persists in the region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------ 
PAINTING A PICTURE 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) Off the secondary road from the Ogun State capitol of 
Abeokuta to the town of Eruwa and leading onward to Oyo 
State, a series of dirt tracks crisscross the bush leading to 
the illegal quarries that dot the landscape along the Oyan 
River.  The quarries, unlicensed by the GON, resemble a 
poorly planned archaeological dig, but instead of scientists, 
men and boys with pick axes methodically dig through a 
36-inch layer of dirt to reach small rocks and boulders. 
Strewn about, the rocks look more like a gardener\'s nuisance 
than a profitable illegal venture that supplies gravel for 
roads and stones for housing.  Well-hidden by the thick 
foliage separating it from the main road, each site is a 
collection of wide holes dug in a meandering fashion with 
layered edges in the earth that reach depths of only 4.5 feet. 
 
3.  (U) POLOFF came upon a new quarry site by following one 
of the many 1.5 ton dump trucks as it passed through several 
tollbooths unimpeded.  As the vehicle passed, two children 
ran off into the bush, while the six men stayed behind and 
worked -- unfazed by their visitors.  The men, Hausa from 
Northern Nigeria, plunged their pick axes into the edge of 
the carved hole several times, stooped over to pick up small 
boulders with one hand and flung them into a small pile. 
Behind them was a pile of fine silt, the remnants of sifted 
loose dirt separated from the pebbles, which also formed a 
large mound.  This scene is repeated daily and nightly 
throughout the Oyan River area. 
 
------------------------ 
ON THE BACKS OF CHILDREN 
------------------------ 
 
4.  (U) One quarry site, near Ijaoulu village where 20 
Beninese children were found last year, still evidenced the 
poor working conditions and squalor in which they once lived. 
 Expansive in comparison to the site worked by the Hausa, the 
Ijaoulu quarry had children as young as five working and 
living at the site where Akinola said some children worked 
there for three to four years without leaving.  Tattered 
clothes were strewn about and nearby were remnants of butcher 
paper and plastic tarps used as bedding.  Three largish, 
blackened stones comprised a meager fire ring that was their 
only means to cook food.  Dried cassava root was left beside 
the fire ring, evidence of a hasty departure. 
 
5.  (U) Akinola, who discovered most of the Beninese 
children, explained that each child earned its trafficker 750 
naira or $5.51 a day -- an exorbitant amount reflecting the 
lucrative trade.  Often the children\'s families received 
small, lump sums for selling their children to traffickers. 
However, the children rarely received any money from the 
trafficker and were provided with limited food and often had 
to find their own water.  They were never given any clothing 
or blankets.  After the September and October raids, Akinola 
said children are rarely seen working during the day. 
Instead they hide in nearby villages sometimes reportedly 
hiding crouched down in large, covered clay pots during the 
day to avoid detection.  The children leave for the quarries 
at night. 
 
------------------ 
OPERATION MIDNIGHT 
------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU) The NPF Anti-Trafficking Unit and the SSS have 
informally created a task force called Operation Midnight. 
Akinola, working with WOCON, identifies villages and quarries 
with trafficked children, informs the task force, and guides 
them to the site at night -- a service for which she has 
received harassment and threats.  It is through this work 
that approximately 300 Beninese children have been rescued. 
However, Akinola said the Ogun State government provides no 
cooperation, surmising that many within the state government 
are profiting from the illegal quarries.  Employers of the 
trafficked children were initially arrested, but later freed 
after the traditional ruler of Abeokuta who pressed for their 
release, accepted the employers\' promises to end the use of 
child labor. 
 
7.  (SBU) Despite the recognized good work, Akinola, WOCON, 
the NPF, and SSS all are under-funded.  The NPF 
Anti-Trafficking Unit is housed in the corner of a building 
in a police compound.  The 20x10-foot room has two crude 
picnic benches and tables adjoined to each other with two 
warren-sized offices adjacent. Two anti-trafficking posters 
supplied by NGOs provide the only decoration on the wall. 
There is no telephone and because the director\'s personal 
cell phone is with a company that does not have coverage in 
Abeokuta, no one can contact the unit directly.  Nor do they 
have any communications equipment, office supplies, 
handcuffs, or leg guards.  The eight-man unit is short four 
officers.  Repeated requests for supplies from headquarters 
in Abuja have not produced any results.  Their jurisdiction 
covers the Oyan River area of Ogun State, the hotbed of known 
child trafficking activity in Southwestern Nigeria. 
 
------------------ 
PREVENTION EFFORTS 
------------------ 
 
8.  (U) POLOFF also visited a child trafficking source and 
destination village with WOCON, an organization that has been 
doing fieldwork in trafficking since 1997.  Bara Orile is the 
traditional seat of 73 neighboring villages in the Oyan River 
area of Ogun State located near the quarry sites.  The 
village chief said Beninese children sometimes overnighted in 
the village that also served as a residence for a Beninese 
trafficker who was later extradited to Benin.  Bara Orile\'s 
own children are trafficked to Lagos and work as domestic 
servants in the homes of the middle-class and the affluent. 
The village\'s economy is depressed and the once vibrant cocoa 
and cashew fields were abandoned with the rest of Nigeria\'s 
agriculture during the oil boom.  Cassava is the only crop 
left.  The village once had a secondary school, but it is 
closed and the primary school appeared under-used.  The 
chief, who is charged by Ogun State with overseeing the 73 
nearby villages, does not receive his salary. 
 
9.  (U) WOCON did a program assessment of the village and 
will start a child trafficking awareness campaign and 
cooperate with village elders to forcefully discourage the 
practice.  In addition, WOCON will press the state government 
to pay the chief\'s salary and arrange for micro-credit loans 
to purchase gari machines.  Gari, a staple food made from 
cassava, would quickly generate income for the village 
located 15 kilometers outside of Abeokuta.  In the long-term, 
WOCON will attempt to rejuvenate cashew and cocoa production, 
but helping hands may be hard to find given the village\'s 
history with the more lucrative trafficking.  WOCON has met 
success with this dual approach: small-scale, directed 
sustained economic development and building awareness for 
child trafficking. Two other villages have successfully 
generated profitable small-scale economic enterprises and its 
elders and community leaders have disavowed trafficking, 
chastising those who persist. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
HEADLINE GRABBER OR IMPASSIONED FIGHTER FOR THE CAUSE? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
10.  (C) Mrs. Titi Abubakar, wife of the Vice President and 
founder of the Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication 
Foundation (WOTCLEF), has been active and vocal about her 
measures to combat trafficking, generating national attention 
to the issue.  When Akinola notified WOTCLEF about the plight 
of the Beninese children, the organization immediately 
swooped in.  Akinola claims that WOTCLEF promised monies to 
her organization to recuperate her expenses as well as 
pressing the NPF to provide much needed supplies to the 
Abeokuta Anti-Trafficking Unit.  These promises have not been 
kept.  In contrast, the Ogun State government gave 5 
million-naira to WOTCLEF for its work in repatriating the 
Beninese children.  WOTCLEF also received a 10 million-naira 
grant from the World Bank in 2003. 
 
11.  (C) It has been rumored that Mrs. Abubakar embezzles 
from her organization.  Mrs. Abubakar, along with 23 other 
wives of prominent politicians, is a defendant in a suit 
filed in Federal High Court in Abuja compelling her to 
account for the funds that her organization has received. 
The original suit was filed in Federal High Court in Lagos in 
June 2003 and has been postponed until February 18 in the 
Abuja court.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: NEW BANS ON IMPORTS 
 
REF: 03 ABUJA 600 
 
PARA THREE RELATES PROPRIETARY INFORMATION. PLEASE 
PROTECT ACCORDINGLY. 
 
1. (U) Summary: GON officials recently announced a new 
series of import bans, this time on items ranging from 
toothpaste and wheelbarrows to plastics, textiles, 
detergents, and meat products.  The bans\' impact on 
overall U.S. exports to Nigeria will likely be minimal, 
but some U.S. firms, particularly Procter & Gamble, 
will suffer losses.  Mission personnel will continue to 
support U.S. exporters and convey USG concerns about 
Nigeria\'s protectionist trade policies to GON 
officials, but given the bans\' political nature, 
convincing the GON to remove them or replace them with 
tariffs will likely be difficult.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Nigeria\'s use of import bans as a trade policy 
tool is nothing new: several of the twenty-odd items on 
the GON\'s September 2003 Import Prohibition List have 
been banned for years.  The bans\' cumulative impact on 
U.S. producers has been negligible, mostly because the 
specified items comprise (or would comprise) a very 
small percentage of overall U.S. exports to Nigeria 
(reftel).  Although the GON\'s latest additions to the 
Import Prohibition List more than double its length, 
most of the newly banned items are not among the mix of 
products exported to Nigeria by U.S. firms.  Certain 
producers, of course, do stand to lose, particularly 
those who export plastics, textiles, detergents, meat 
products, or men\'s footwear.  U.S. trade data suggests 
potential losses to these producers could total $30 
million per year, but unless these exports account for 
a significant proportion of an individual firm\'s total 
exports, businesses will survive intact.  The potential 
$30 million loss represents no more than 3 percent of 
total U.S. exports to Nigeria.  Thus far, U.S. firms 
seem relatively unconcerned at the prospect of losing 
access to Nigerian markets.  Inquiries and protests 
have been few and far between. 
 
3. (SBU) Only one firm, Procter & Gamble, has requested 
Mission advocacy.  Company executives said February 6 
that P&G would have to discontinue sales of its Ariel 
detergent (which it imports from Morocco) in October 
2004 if the GON\'s ban on imported soaps and detergents 
remains in place.  Having lost $27 million in its first 
nine years of operation, P&G Nigeria has only recently 
begun to break even and begin expanding its operations. 
It opened a $10 million diaper and feminine pads 
factory in 2002 and invested $4 million in a second 
feminine pads facility set to open next month.  These 
plants, together with a proposed detergent factory, may 
be at risk if P&G\'s profits from Ariel can no longer be 
realized and re-invested.  The firm may be able to 
offset its losses by producing detergent locally, but 
regaining lost market share may be difficult.  P&G 
executives have spoken to President Obasanjo and 
Ministry of Finance officials, but the GON shows no 
willingness to lift the ban. 
 
4. (U) GON officials are not unfamiliar with arguments 
against import bans.  Mission personnel have frequently 
pointed out that bans are inefficient, economically 
counter-intuitive, and difficult to enforce.  Bans do 
little to stimulate domestic production, in part 
because they raise the costs of doing business and in 
part because corresponding increases in contraband 
goods deprive local manufacturers of any incentive to 
increase productivity. Banned items have long entered 
the country illegally - the Nigeria Customs Service 
lacks the personnel and technical capacity it needs to 
prevent this - and will likely continue to cross 
Nigeria\'s porous borders.  Consumers also bear the 
costs of illegally imported goods or expensive locally 
manufactured goods, and society as a whole suffers. 
Moreover, local manufacturers are in many cases 
incapable of expanding production quickly enough to 
offset anticipated shortfalls.  Nigerian meat and fruit 
producers, for example, would have to spend years 
building their industries before their farms and 
orchards would yield significant increases in output or 
revenue. 
 
5. (U) Under Nigeria\'s World Trade Organization 
commitments, GON officials should have replaced import 
bans with tariffs long ago.  Mission personnel have 
frequently reminded GON officials that bans are illegal 
under WTO rules, but the GON insists \"WTO protocol 
allows countries to impose bans of a maximum of five 
years to enable local industries to compete.\" 
Replacing the bans with tariffs would make sense: like 
bans, tariffs reduce imports, but they have the added 
benefit of generating tariff revenue, something that 
accounts for a significant proportion of the GON\'s 
total annual income.  If the GON imposed 100 percent 
tariffs on each of the items it now bans, it could earn 
nearly $30 million per year from the U.S. alone.  The 
failure to levy tariffs deprives the GON of tariff 
revenue and leaves in place bans that violate WTO rules 
and contradict the GON\'s stated commitment to more 
liberal trade policies. 
 
6. (SBU) Despite these arguments, GON officials are 
unlikely to change course.  Some have hinted at future 
bans, arguing that benefits to local producers far 
outweigh lost tariff revenue.  GON officials say 
repeatedly that by eliminating (or at least reducing) 
imports, bans stimulate domestic production and give 
local producers a chance to compete.  This, in turn, 
supposedly creates jobs, raises incomes, and enhances 
economic growth.  These arguments are largely 
inaccurate, but they appeal to a public desperately in 
need of jobs, and GON officials know this.  With the 
2007 elections three years away and politicians already 
trying to garner suport, GON officials are unlikely to 
abandon populst policies.  Import bans are highly 
political isues, and many provide lucrative means of 
rewarding politicians\' largest campaign contributors. 
Bas on bagged cement and noodles, for example, beneft 
one particular firm, Dangote Industries, whoseowner is 
thought to have contributed $25-50 millon to President 
Obasanjo\'s 2003 election campaign. 
 
7. (SBU) Import bans rarely succeed in stimulating the 
local economy, but they do create opportunities for 
corruption.  Those who import banned items provide 
kickbacks to Customs officials and transportation 
companies, and local manufacturers who benefit from the 
bans often express their appreciation in cash.  In the 
end, everyone kicks up, a handful of people make a 
great deal of money, and Nigerian consumers bear the 
costs.  Those who benefit from the system have little 
incentive to eliminate it, every incentive to maintain 
it, and even greater incentives to expand it. 
 
8. (U) Comment: Mission personnel will continue to 
support U.S. exporters and convey USG concerns about 
Nigeria\'s protectionist trade policies to GON 
officials.  Advocacy may be most effective if President 
Obasanjo is approached directly, particularly since the 
vast majority of import bans appear to originate in his 
office.  The U.S. Trade Representative\'s Office and 
other Washington agencies could help by preparing a 
high-level demarche.  In the meantime, Mission 
personnel will concentrate on expressing USG concerns 
in meetings, speeches, op-eds, and press briefings. 
Mission personnel will also promote new business 
opportunities to U.S. exporters.  Paradoxically, the 
benefits to U.S. producers may actually outweigh losses 
related to the bans, particularly if U.S. exports of 
capital equipment and other inputs to Nigerian start- 
ups increase.  We might express our opposition to the 
GON\'s import bans, but we should also do what we can to 
take advantage of new business opportunities.  End 
comment.

REF: 2003 ABUJA 448 
 
Classified By: Consul-General Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.5 (b) an 
 
d (d). 
 
 1.  (U) On February 6, unknown assailants killed Chief 
Amino-Sari Dikibo, National Vice Chairman of the South-South 
Zone of the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), as he was 
traveling to attend a Conference of South-South Governors in 
Asaba, Delta State.  Dikibo, who had a police escort and 
driver, was reportedly shot once in the head after two cars 
stopped in front of his convoy and turned around to pursue 
him along the Kwale-Ogwashi-Uku road in northeastern Delta 
State.  Observers who viewed the body and vehicle said 
Dikibo\'s skull was \"shattered.\" 
 
2.  (U) In his monthly television address, President Olusegun 
Obasanjo, a PDP member, said Dikibo was killed by \"a band of 
armed robbers,\" eleven of whom are now in police custody.  A 
press report indicates that Delta State highways experienced 
a spate of armed robberies last year and that on the day of 
Dikibo\'s death, armed gangs robbed several persons in the 
area.  The same report noted that the driver of Dikibo\'s 
vehicle and escorting police officers were neither harmed in 
the alleged robbery nor were they stained with blood, 
although brain matter and blood stained the back seat of the 
vehicle. 
 
3.  (U) Press commentators have noted the similarity between 
Dikibo\'s murder and the political killing in March 2003 of 
Marshall Harry, the National Vice Chairman for the 
South-South Zone for the All Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP), 
the most popular opposition party to the PDP in the region 
(reftel).  Before his death, Harry, a former PDP politician, 
had repeatedly stated that he feared for his life.   He 
blamed his fears on Peter Odili, Governor of Rivers State, 
who, Harry said, wanted him killed. 
 
4.  (U) To obtain further details on the murder, POLOFF spoke 
with Delta State Attorney General (AG), A. A. Utuama February 
9.  Utuama confirmed that the National Police Force in Asaba 
is investigating the incident.  Utuama stated he had no 
further information beyond that reported by the press and an 
initial phone call from Delta State Governor James Ibori. 
(Standard procedure calls for a written report to be 
submitted to the AG after an investigation is complete, at 
which time the AG may recommend prosecution.)  Commissioner 
of Police for Delta State Charles Akaya told POLOFF February 
9 that he, too, could not discuss the case until he received 
clearance from headquarters in Abuja. 
 
5.  (C) COMMENT: The reported circumstances of Dikibo\'s death 
are not consistent with an armed robbery.  None of his 
possessions were taken and the description of the single 
gunshot wound to his head implies he was shot at close range. 
 Armed robberies in Nigeria usually involve automatic and 
semi-automatic weapons fired indiscriminately at victims.  If 
Dikibo\'s death is the result of a robbery, it is highly 
unusual that a driver seated in the car with the victim 
survived unscathed.  The reported facts of the shooting 
suggest an assassination. 
 
6.  (C) Motives for the possible assassination are unknown. 
However, it is unusual that high-ranking members of his own 
party, including the President, have so quickly dismissed his 
murder as a bungled robbery.  The relatively close timing of 
the murder to the anniversary of the assassination of 
Marshall Harry makes it difficult to simply dismiss Dikibo\'s 
death on the grounds that he simply was a man in the wrong 
place at the wrong time.  Circumstances point to various 
possibilities: a reprisal assassination by the ANPP avenging 
Harry, a PDP insider acting alone, or a calculated move 
within PDP.  Dikibo may have been on the wrong side of 
continuing feuds between the President and Vice President or 
a feud between the President and the southern governors, one 
of whom, James Ibori of Delta State, has been known to be 
involved in the killing of rivals.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: THEY STARTED IT: WORLD AIRWAYS AND RITETIME 
TRADE ACCUSATIONS 
 
REF: LAGOS 83 
 
1. (U) Summary: World Airways and Ritetime Aviation and 
Travel Service executives called on Mission personnel 
February 9 and 10, respectively.  Both groups related 
the series of events leading to World\'s December 2003 
decision to suspend its scheduled charter flights 
between the United States and Nigeria.  Their accounts 
differ wildly.  Mission personnel recommended that the 
two sides meet to discuss their differences, but 
reconciliation does not seem likely, particularly with 
heavily damaged reputations and anywhere from $1.3 to 
$2 million at stake.  Not surprisingly, the 75 
passengers still holding tickets for February and March 
World Airways flights will have to make alternate 
travel arrangements.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) World Airways executives say the company\'s 
booking agent, Ritetime Aviation and Travel Service, 
owes the company nearly $2 million in back payments. 
This, they say, was the major reason behind the 
airline\'s December 2003 decision to suspend all flights 
between the United States and Nigeria.  Ritetime\'s late 
payments reached such high levels in late 2003 that 
despite bank assurances that the payments would be made 
(note: the airline\'s managers now believe some of these 
letters were forged), World executives deemed the 
company\'s financial exposure too great to continue 
flying.  World says it delivered a notice of 
cancellation to Ritetime on December 15 and refused to 
fly beyond the December 31 expiration of the firms\' 
contract.  Company executives understood this would 
leave hundreds of passengers stranded, but they decided 
they could not continue operating without being paid. 
They claim they had no control over Ritetime\'s ticket 
sales and had no way of knowing how many people would 
be affected by the cancellations.  They admit having 
made regrettable business decisions, but they lay much 
of the blame for the companies\' fall-out at Ritetime\'s 
feet. 
 
3. (U) Ritetime\'s account differs wildly.  Company 
executives admit owing World only $1.3 million and say 
they explained several times that the idiosyncrasies of 
the Nigerian financial system (namely, that all 
payments are made in cash) would necessarily make 
payments late.  Ritetime executives also take issue 
with World\'s use of funds, particularly where catering 
services and the handling of excess baggage are 
concerned.  They object to World\'s decision to provide 
an MD-11 freighter to carry December travelers\' extra 
bags to Nigeria, saying the company could have saved 
money by putting the bags on future flights.  World 
executives, for their part, say this would have taken 
much too long and insist they had no control over the 
amount of extra baggage accepted by Ritetime when 
passengers checked in.  Ritetime managers believe World 
was solely responsible for transporting passengers and 
bags. 
 
4. (U) Ritetime executives say they regret having left 
people stranded in December and January, but they put 
the blame squarely on World\'s shoulders, claiming their 
contract expired not on December 31 but on January 31. 
Ritetime executives also say the two firms agreed in 
late 2003 to extend their contract to November 30, 
2004, something World did not mention.  World 
executives said, however, that they believed the 
contract\'s third page had been substituted since 
Nigerian Central Bank officials reported a bank account 
in World Airways\' name that company executives knew 
nothing about.  World executives expected to discuss 
the matter with bank officials this week. 
 
5. (U) Surprisingly, Ritetime executives believe they 
may be able to reconcile with World and resume 
operations later this year, perhaps as early as March. 
They expressed dismay at their counterparts\' refusal to 
talk, saying repeatedly they believed they could reach 
an agreement if World would come to the negotiating 
table. 
 
6. (U) World executives show no signs of accommodation. 
They have no desire, they say, to continue working with 
Ritetime, and they plan to take legal action to recover 
their money.  In the meantime, World is looking for a 
new booking agent.  Executives say they hope to re- 
enter the market later this year, perhaps as early as 
June.  Next time, they say, they will present a 
position paper to GON officials, enlist the support of 
the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), and 
handle passengers\' reservations themselves.  World 
executives say a Monday morning meeting with NCAA 
officials went well, and they expect to have the GON\'s 
support if they decide to resume operations in Nigeria. 
 
7. (U) Comment: Both firms\' reputations were heavily 
damaged by World\'s decision to suspend operations. 
Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in the U.S. 
and Nigeria, a fiasco that was widely covered by the 
media on both sides of the Atlantic.  Most returned 
home in mid-January, but a handful, mostly people who 
were unaware of World\'s cancellations, remain in Lagos. 
Both World and Ritetime executives say they are working 
to refund the passengers\' money or make alternate 
travel arrangements.  Given the companies\' damaged 
reputations, World\'s financial losses, and the latter\'s 
animosity toward Ritetime, reconciliation is a pipe 
dream.  Mission personnel urged the two sides to meet, 
but it seems unlikely that World will agree.  Their 
next meeting will probably be in court.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SMALL ENTREPRENEURS THINK BIG 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Small entrepreneurs face many 
constraints, but they think big.  Increasing interest 
in microfinance may expand access to credit and 
alleviate a particularly pressing problem.  If it does, 
Nigerian entrepreneurs may think even bigger.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The Nigerian business environment presents 
obstacles almost too numerous to count.  Power supplies 
are notoriously unreliable, transportation and 
telecommunications infrastructure is poor, barriers to 
registering new businesses are inordinately high, and 
access to credit is insufficient.  Small entrepreneurs 
face these constraints and more, but they persist in 
doing business.  According to the Nigerian Ministry of 
Industry, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account 
for 10 percent of Nigeria\'s manufacturing output and 70 
percent of industrial employment.  They play an 
immeasurably large role in the informal economy and 
provide income for untold numbers of people. 
 
3. (SBU) GON officials frequently acknowledge the 
importance of SMEs in driving economic growth, but 
efforts to support small entrepreneurs have been only 
moderately successful.  The GON\'s Small and Medium 
Industries Equity Investment Scheme (SMIEIS) requires 
commercial banks to set aside 10 percent of before-tax 
profits for equity investments in industrial 
enterprises, but much of this vast pool of money 
remains on banks\' books.  Of the $150 million set aside 
since the program\'s June 2001 inauguration, only thirty- 
five percent has been invested.  Bank executives say 
they lack the expertise to evaluate the 
creditworthiness of small enterprises and object to 
expectations that they nurture businesses in which they 
invest.  They are not venture capitalists, they say, 
and they simply cannot give small entrepreneurs the 
advice and training they need.  SMEs have proven risky 
investments in the past, and bank executives are 
reluctant to purchase equity when they cannot be 
certain of returns. 
 
4. (U) Given Nigeria\'s shortage of commercial 
financing, micro and small business owners look to 
microfinance institutions (MFIs) for funding.  These 
are often the only realistic sources of loans for the 
smallest of Nigeria\'s entrepreneurs, many of whom may 
need only a few hundred dollars.  Some institutions, 
like the Community Development Foundation (CDF), have 
operated for years and financed hundreds of small 
businesses.  CDF is funded by international donor 
organizations and engages principally in wholesale 
microfinance, giving loans of $800 to $35,000 to apex 
MFIs whose memberships range from 50 to 500 individuals 
or groups.  The organization has awarded approximately 
$1.3 million in more than 240 loans since its inception 
a decade ago, and Executive Director Akin Akintola 
reports a 95 percent repayment rate.  CDF\'s experience 
shows that micro and small business owners can and will 
repay loans, even when wholesale interest rates (at 21 
percent) are comparable to existing commercial rates. 
 
5. (U) CDF supplements its loans with grants earmarked 
for capacity building programs.  These provide 
strategic planning and management training and teach 
small entrepreneurs how to develop sound business 
plans, which CDF executives hope will eventually help 
small business owners secure financing from commercial 
or community development banks.  Akintola believes 
capacity building is an important part of microfinance 
- it\'s about more than just money, he says - but the 
organization does what it can to reduce loan 
recipients\' reliance on MFIs and link them with private 
sector institutions, the theory being, of course, that 
CDF will be able to expand its client base as people 
secure financing elsewhere. 
 
6. (U) Ford Foundation and World Bank officials share 
Akintola\'s recognition of the importance of technical 
assistance.  Both organizations provide wholesale loans 
to MFIs, but emphasis on capacity building is growing. 
The Ford Foundation\'s Representative for West Africa, 
Dr. Adhiambo Odaga, notes that funding goes 
increasingly to programs designed to strengthen 
governance and management techniques and spread best 
practices.  The Ford Foundation\'s $3 million annual 
budget funds technical training and computerization 
programs and supports efforts to establish an MFI trade 
association, introduce performance standards, and offer 
a more limited range of easy to understand products. 
These efforts will be supplemented by the World Bank\'s 
recently announced $34 million technical assistance 
program.  Officials say they hope to provide business 
development services, create alternative dispute 
resolution mechanisms, and work with the Nigerian 
Corporate Affairs Commission to reduce the business 
registration process from 41 days to four.  With 
computerization and continued assistance, they say, 
significant improvements are possible. 
 
7. (U) Comment: Increasing interest in microfinance and 
capacity building may expand access to credit and 
alleviate one of Nigerian entrepreneurs\' most pressing 
problems.  If SMIEIS and other GON support programs are 
improved and expanded and if MFIs continue to operate, 
entrepreneurs may not have everything they need, but 
they may be free of at least one constraint.  With 
sufficient financing, small business owners can 
continue to think big.  According to World Bank 
officials, catfish and cassava production might be 
excellent places to start.  End comment.

SUBJECT: Nigeria 2004 Special 301 Review on IPR 
Protection 
 
Ref: State 29549 
 
1. SUMMARY. Progress on IPR protection in Nigeria 
continues to be hampered by inadequate funding and poor 
public and government awareness.  Nonetheless, we do not 
believe Nigeria should be added to the Watch List because 
improvements, however small, are detectable, and any 
momentum would likely be lost with sanctions.  While the 
GON improved its position in the last year regarding its 
use of computer software, it has not yet paid licensing 
fees. Nigeria made slight improvements in the areas of 
optical media piracy and prosecution of IPR violations, 
but a lack of resources and training, coupled with low 
public and government understanding and appreciation of 
the benefits of IPR protection, leave enforcement weak. 
Industry and government representatives nonetheless 
attest to the GON\'s continued attention to IPR issues and 
incremental efforts to address piracy and improve 
enforcement.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------- 
A. Optical Media Piracy 
----------------------- 
 
2. Nigeria remains a large market for a wide range of 
pirated optical media products. Pirated versions of CDs 
and VCDs abound for sale on the streets of Nigeria\'s 
urban centers. Much of the pirate disc industry is 
centered in a section of Lagos where several local 
optical media companies have the capacity to produce over 
500 copies of CDs, DVDs, and VCDs daily. 
 
3. The GON appears to have taken a step toward addressing 
this problem, but effective enforcement is stalled. We 
are told that the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) now 
requires anti-piracy holograms to be included on optical 
media; however, a court injunction has put the 
prosecution of at least one case in jeopardy, as well as 
future enforcement of the hologram scheme. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
B. Use/Procurement of Government Software 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. Until recently, the GON was considered the largest 
abuser of IPR in that most, if not all, government 
offices used pirated software. In early 2002 President 
Obasanjo directed all ministries and parastatals to 
account for the software in their possession, and to 
regularize software usage.  In 2003 the National 
Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), in 
coordination with the NCC, completed an audit of software 
in use by the government and negotiated license 
agreements with the software owners. 
 
5.  Microsoft reports that it has signed licensing 
agreements with most government and parastatal agencies, 
and considers this a major step toward legitimizing 
government usage of its software.  However, the GON is 
yet to pay the fees associated with the licensing 
agreements, and it is unclear when or if such funds will 
be appropriated. 
 
------------------- 
C. TRIPS Compliance 
------------------- 
 
6. Nigeria is a signatory to the Universal Copyright 
Convention and the Berne Convention. In 1993, Nigeria 
became a member of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization (WIPO) and thereby became party to most of 
the major international agreements on intellectual 
property rights. The Patents and Design Decree of 1970 
governs the registration of patents; and the Standards 
Organization of Nigeria is responsible for issuing 
patents, trademarks, and copyrights. Once conferred, a 
patent conveys an exclusive right to make, import, sell, 
or use the products or apply the process. The Copyright 
Decree of 1988, based on WIPO standards and U.S. 
copyright law, makes it a crime to export, import, 
reproduce, exhibit, perform, or sell any work without the 
permission of the copyright owner. 
 
7. In 1999, amendments to the Copyright Decree 
incorporated most TRIPS protections for copyrights, 
except provisions to protect geographical indications and 
undisclosed business information. The amendment also gave 
the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) additional 
enforcement powers. 
 
8. Four TRIPS-related bills and amendments have been 
under consideration for two years, but none have been 
forwarded to the National Assembly. The Ministry of 
Justice is reviewing their provisions.  According to the 
GON, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
reviewed the first three of the acts listed (all except 
the plant and animal variety legislation) and determined 
that their enactment would bring Nigeria into full 
compliance with TRIPS. 
 
--The Nigerian Copyrights Commission (NCC) and the 
Trademarks and Patents Registry (TPR) prepared a bill 
that would merge both agencies to establish an 
Intellectual Property Commission (IPCON). The draft law 
provides for the new commission to retain a part of the 
fees it would collect to fund operations and programs. 
 
--The Ministry of Justice is reviewing an amendment to 
the Patents and Designs Act that will make comprehensive 
provisions for the registration and proprietorship of 
patents and designs. 
 
--The Ministry of Justice is also reviewing an amendment 
to the Trademarks Act that will improve existing 
legislation relating to the recording, publishing, and 
enforcement of trademarks. 
 
--A bill to provide protection for plant varieties, 
including biotechnology, and animal breeds, was discussed 
by various agencies, but no progress has been reported. 
 
-------------- 
D. Enforcement 
-------------- 
 
9. Law enforcement remains weak, and the judicial process 
is slow and subject to corruption. Inadequate funding of 
law enforcement and judicial functions is the major 
obstacle to effective enforcement of IPR laws.  Police 
and courts lack everything from staff and computers to 
vehicles and office supplies. 
 
10. Companies rarely seek trademark or patent protection 
because it is generally perceived as ineffective given 
the sad state of police and court infrastructure. 
Microsoft reports it pursued only one raid in 2003.  The 
company has made an effort to assist government IPR 
enforcers with logistical support, such as donating a bus 
for the movement of officers to the location of a raid. 
The company also reports that it has been asked for a 
wide variety of in-kind assistance, and it does not want 
to fall into a pattern in which it is expected to pay for 
the proper enforcement of Nigerian law.  It is unlikely 
that law enforcement will improve without assertive 
political leadership, policy direction, and perhaps most 
important, adequate financial support. 
 
11. Another key deficiency is an inadequate appreciation 
among regulatory officials, distributor networks, and 
consumers of the benefits of intellectual property rights 
protection. This is coupled with the fact that the 
average consumer price of legally produced or imported 
materials is beyond the reach of most Nigerians.  In 2003 
the managers and legal advisors of two banks charged with 
using unlicensed software convincingly claimed they 
simply didn\'t realize they were obligated to use licensed 
copies of computer operating systems. In another 
instance, two major insurance firms have been balking at 
pressure to pay licensing fees, each insisting that it 
will pay only after its competitor does so. 
 
12. Nigeria\'s over-stretched and under-trained police 
lack sufficient understanding of IPR. The Nigerian 
Customs Service has received some WIPO sponsored 
training, but even those officers who can identify 
pirated imports are not allowed, under the current law, 
to impound the offending materials unless the copyright 
owner has filed a complaint against that particular 
shipment, which is only done in very rare instances. 
 
13. IPR cases are handled primarily by the Federal High 
Court, whose judges generally have broad familiarity with 
IPR protection law. However, an appeal might not be 
handled by a knowledgeable judge, and misapplication of 
the law is not uncommon. Lagos is the only region in 
Nigeria where most judges have a reasonable knowledge of 
IPR. Further exacerbating the problem, most legal 
practitioners do not possess adequate knowledge of 
intellectual property rights to properly handle cases. 
 
14. Nigerian artists including writers, filmmakers, and 
musicians have in recent years campaigned for more 
effective copyright protection. Lawyers active in IPR 
issues formed the Industrial Property Law Interest Group 
(IPLIG) to educate the public and lobby on behalf of 
industrial IPR issues. IPLIG has sponsored copyright 
conferences and initiated an IPR course at the Lagos Law 
School. Software company representatives, represented by 
the Business Software Alliance (BSA), successfully worked 
directly with the Nigerian Government to stop its use of 
pirated software. Nigerian filmmakers formed the Proteus 
Entertainment Agency to challenge copyright infringement 
and promote stronger law enforcement. However, a member 
of a group called Musical Owners Rights Association of 
Nigeria (MORAN) is said to have obtained an injunction 
against his prosecution for pirating music in Abia State 
in Southeastern Nigeria, placing a hold on hologram 
enforcement. 
 
----------------------------- 
RECOMMEND NO CHANGE IN STATUS 
----------------------------- 
 
15. COMMENT. Although Nigeria is a large market for 
pirated goods, it should not be included in USTR\'s 
Special 301 Watch List. The GON is pursuing efforts to 
shore up its regulatory and legal framework. Overall, the 
GON continues efforts to improve IPR protection. 
President Obasanjo\'s commitment to ensure that GON 
agencies use licensed software proves the government is 
not oblivious to its obligations and maintains IPR among 
the issues of international importance it attempts to 
address.  Furthermore, since the Nigerian populace 
perceives that the value of its money has shrunk 
substantially over the last few years (which is, in large 
part, true), any move that would seem to place a higher 
burden on consumers would be intepreted as a cave-into 
U.S. policies and interests and hence would be greeted 
with animosity, if not outright hostility.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: KTEX, ETRD, EINV, ECON, PREL, NI, AGOA 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: AGOA III: INFORMATION ON TEXTILE AND 
APPAREL PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES 
 
REF: (A) STATE 26964, (B) 03 Abuja 1972 
 
1. (U) Summary: Nigeria\'s textile and apparel industry 
is uncompetitive and in decline, and manufacturers are 
skeptical about the possibilities of reversing the 
industry\'s long downward trend.  Nigerian producers are 
not yet eligible for AGOA textile and apparel benefits, 
and most believe that AGOA alone will not bring about a 
substantial increase in their textile or apparel trade 
(Ref B).  Many are leaving the business, with 
corresponding negative upstream effects on Nigerian 
cotton producers.  End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
TEXTILE PRODUCTION FACILITIES 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Over the last ten years, many of Nigeria\'s 
textile mills have permanently shut down.  Membership 
in the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association 
(NTMA) has declined from 124 members in 1994 to fewer 
than 60 today; most remaining mills are operating at 
only 60 or 70 percent capacity.  The industry has shed 
more than 60,000 of its 140,000 jobs, and most 
observers expect further decline. 
 
3. (U) Nigerian spinning, weaving, and processing 
facilities are fully mechanized, but equipment is often 
outdated and poorly maintained.  According to NTMA\'s 
executive director, Nigerian spinning facilities have 
810,000 spindles and 26,000 open-ended rotors.  The 
country\'s weaving facilities, he says, have 16,840 
shuttle looms and 2,640 shuttle-less looms and produce 
approximately 450 million meters of gray cloth 
annually.  Most Nigerian textile manufacturers import 
ginned cotton from neighboring countries, but some, 
like locally owned Nigerian Textile Mills and part 
Indian owned Afprint, operate domestic cotton 
plantations and ginneries.  A handful of firms also 
produce polyester yarns and fabrics. 
 
----------------------------- 
APPAREL PRODUCTION FACILITIES 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Nigeria has no organized apparel industry.  Most 
garments are produced by individual tailors or by small 
businessmen working with one or two assistants and a 
handful of sewing machines.  Locally produced or 
imported cotton fabric is the most common input, with 
imports coming chiefly from ASEAN countries.  These 
should decline after the GON\'s January 2004 ban on 
textile imports.  Finished products range from 
traditional dress to designer clothes geared toward 
Nigeria\'s affluent. 
 
----------------------------------- 
TARGET MARKET FOR FINISHED PRODUCTS 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) According to NTMA\'s executive director, 65 
percent of Nigeria\'s textile production, mostly cotton 
or polyester yarn and gray cloth, is sold domestically, 
with the remaining 35 percent exported to neighboring 
countries or Europe (primarily Italy, Spain, and 
Portugal).  Yarn produced from Nigerian cotton is often 
exported as discounted non-dying yarn due to 
contamination by fibers from cotton pickers\' 
polyethylene bags.  None of Nigeria\'s finished products 
are exported to the U.S. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (U) Nigerian textile manufacturers are uniformly 
bleak about the prospects of turning around a declining 
industry.  High input prices, unreliable power 
supplies, and poor transportation infrastructure have 
forced many producers to close their doors, and many 
observers expect further decline, particularly since 
attracting new investment has become increasingly 
difficult.  Nigerian producers are not yet eligible for 
AGOA textile and apparel benefits, and few producers 
have expressed interest in expanding textile or apparel 
manufacturing facilities.  Unless Nigeria secures AGOA 
textile and apparel certification or sees its main 
textile products, cotton yarn and gray cloth, become 
eligible for duty-free treatment, the legislation\'s 
extension is unlikely to have much impact.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, EPET, KDEM, NI, PGOV 
SUBJECT: Nigeria:  NLC Plans Protests Against Casualization 
in the Banking Industry 
 
1. (U) On February 26, Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) 
President Adams Oshiomhole announced that the NLC, the 
Congress of Free Trade Unions (CFTU), and several civil 
society groups have planned demonstrations in Lagos 
beginning March 4, 2004 to protest casualization (use of 
contract labor) in the banking industry.  NLC Assistant 
General Secretary Denja Yakub told PolSpec that the decision 
to mobilize its members follows a series of failed 
negotiations between the National Union of Banks, Insurance 
and Financial Institutions Employees (NUBIFIE) and industry 
employers.  NUBIFIE, one of the NLC\'s 29 unions, has 
identified fifty-six Nigerian banks that employ most of 
their non-professional staff through contracts.  Since 
Nigerian labor law prohibits contract workers from joining 
unions and gives employers the option to extend benefits or 
not, many companies operating in Nigeria employ contract 
workers to reduce labor costs.  Nigerian labor law permits 
employers to hire workers through private contractors if 
length of employment does not exceed 90 days.  However, the 
NLC argues that the practice is widely abused since most 
contract employees remain with their companies for years by 
simply renewing their work agreements every three months. 
 
2. (U) Mazi Okechukwu, President of the Chartered Institute 
of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), an umbrella organization for 
all registered banks in Nigeria, told reporters that banks 
\"will seek all avenues, including legal action, to prevent 
the NLC from disrupting banks operations.\"  While several 
banks have vowed to seek judicial redress to prevent the 
planned demonstrations, the NLC defends its right to 
organize such events in order to uphold workers rights and 
promote international standards pertaining to the freedom of 
association. Labor leaders are concerned, however, that the 
Federal Court set a precedent in January 2004 when it agreed 
to hear a GON claim that the NLC\'s plans to strike against a 
proposed fuel tax were illegal.  Although the Court 
eventually ruled in favor of the NLC, labor leaders were 
ordered not to act until the GON had exhausted its appeals. 
The NLC viewed the injunction as an infringement on its 
right to organize, since it effectively disrupted labor\'s 
mobilization efforts.  The NLC believes that any recognition 
or decision by the courts to hear a case involving planned 
protests against the banking industry would also constitute 
a denial of labor\'s right to organize. 
 
3. (U) Despite escalating tensions between industry workers 
and employers, Okechukwu said the CIBN plans to reach out to 
the NLC to seek a peaceful resolution to the dispute. In 
what appeared a desperate move to stave off the action, 
Yakub said several banks have contacted the NLC, either to 
deny accusations that they have failed to observe Nigerian 
labor laws pertaining to contract labor or to express their 
intention to comply with existing labor legislation. 
Publicly, the NLC contends that the protest will begin as 
planned unless all banks \"accept unconditionally the 
existing laws regulating the operations of workers in the 
workplace,\" which includes the freedom of association. 
However, Yakub told Polspec the NLC has agreed to meet with 
industry representatives this week.  He said the NLC would 
likely agree to suspend protests if banks show a commitment 
to trade unionism and are willing to \"enter into agreement 
on the appropriate time frame within which to regulate the 
appointment of casual workers and unionize the 
organization.\" 
 
4.  (U) While the NLC seeks to strengthen its credibility 
among its constituents, labor leaders hope their battle with 
the banks will provide momentum as they look to broaden the 
issue of casualization.  Concerns about the use of contract 
work are slowly moving into the national spotlight and, 
despite growing tension between Nigeria\'s three labor 
consortia, all unions have a common interest in forcing 
companies to employ only full-time permanent staff.  As they 
fight the battle over casualization, labor leaders are also 
stressing that companies must accept greater responsibility 
for ensuring that their contractors maintain legal and 
organizational standards in the treatment of their 
employees. 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment:  NLC officials have raised concerns 
regarding the role of U.S. organizations operating in 
Nigeria, including the U.S. Consulate, in policing its 
contractors.  The Consulate\'s recently severed relationship 
with ServTrust highlights challenges in using contract 
labor.  Forty contract employees were displaced on January 
31, 2004, when the Consulate decided to reduce staff by 
terminating its contract ith their employer, ServTrust. 
Although the deciion was made mre tha one month before 
the contact was officially terminated, ServTrust failed to 
warn its employees, which left them unprepared to subsist as 
they look for new jobs.  ServTrust employees and NLC 
contacts recently raised the issue with Laboff complaining 
that although the majority of the contracted employees had 
worked at the Consulate for many years, they had been paid 
substantially less than Consulate FSNs with similar job 
descriptions, and none of the contract workers received 
severance pay or benefits from ServTrust upon their 
dismissal.  Former ServTrust employees argue that the 
Consulate failed in a duty to ensure that the workers were 
treated fairly by the contractor, who they say paid salaries 
late and refused to grant sick leave.  End comment.

SUBJECT: CROSS RIVER AND AKWA IBOM:  WAITING PEACEFULLY FOR 
DIVIDENDS OF DEMOCRACY 
 
REF: 2003 LAGOS 2293 
 
1. (U) Summary.  On a recent familiarization visit to the 
southeastern States of Cross River and Akwa Ibom, PolOffs 
found officials with many plans for economic development in 
the region.  All are targeting agriculture and tourism as a 
way to diversify and lessen dependence on income from oil. 
Private citizens are forming and funding social service 
organizations to provide services the new democratically 
elected governments can not.  There was no evidence that four 
years of civilian government after a decade of military rule 
has improved the quality of life of the average citizen in 
these States. End summary. 
 
Calabar - The famous Obudu Ranch and the infamous Charles 
Taylor 
 
2. (SBU) The Cross River region, renowned for its beauty and 
bio-diversity, has been a definable area of Nigeria since 
pre-colonial time.  Its population of around two million 
ethnic Efiks, Ejagham and Bekwara has not migrated to other 
regions nor mixed with other ethnic groups.  Though the 
actual borders have varied, there has been a Cross River 
State since Nigerian independence in 1960 and its capital has 
always been the ancient trading city of Calabar.  One of 
Cross River\'s claims to fame these days is the Obudu Cattle 
Ranch, established in 1951.  The \"Ranch\" is the State\'s 
often-touted hope for the development of a revenue-generating 
tourist industry sufficient to relieve its dependence on oil 
income.  Calabar was most recently in the news because it is 
the place the Government of Nigeria (GON) offered as asylum 
to the former President of Liberia, Charles Taylor.  Taylor 
has been charged with committing war crimes against Liberia 
and other African countries.  However, PolOffs visited Cross 
River State the week of February 9, and saw neither the 
\"Ranch\" nor Charles Taylor.  In fact, the universal responses 
to our questions about the whereabouts or future of Taylor in 
Nigeria, were averted eyes, uneasy laughter and attempts to 
direct the conversation elsewhere -- to the \"Ranch\", for 
instance. 
 
But what have you done for me lately? - A meeting with the 
Speaker of the Assembly 
 
3. (SBU)  PolOff and PolSpec met with Cross River Speaker of 
the State House of Assembly, the Hon. Bassey Eko Ewa, Esq., 
and several officials in charge of State Ministries. 
Officials in charge of agricultural development did not 
attend, and the Speaker told us that there is no separate 
ministry for tourism.  At the end of prepared welcoming 
remarks, the Speaker turned to what the USG could do for 
Cross River.  He said the State would be pleased to send 
Assembly Members to participate in democracy-building 
seminars in the US, or any exchange program for legislators 
between our two countries.  He said there had been no 
follow-up to a 1999 USAID-sponsored democracy workshop and 
seminar in which Cross River legislators had participated and 
that they had found very useful.  He then asked a public 
affairs official to take over the briefing.  This official 
gave us a summary of the State government\'s plans for the 
next four years.  He said Cross River suffers from an 
unemployment rate of around 50% which the administration of 
Governor Donald Duke plans to address mainly through 
agricultural development.  The government wants to promote a 
return to \"money crops\" such as palm oil nuts and rubber that 
were profitable for Cross River in the distant past.  Also 
encouraged is the planting of potentially lucrative new crops 
such as pineapple.  The government has announced it will 
provide \"soft money\" (low/no interest, easy repayment) 
micro-loans to unemployed men and women, as well as free 
fertilizer to jump-start its agricultural plans.  The 
government plans to focus also on security to entice private 
investors.  The Polytechnic Training College in Calabar has 
been upgraded to University status (complete with medical and 
law schools).  This official predicted that future graduates 
of the University would find jobs created by the private 
investors enticed to Calabar by the improved security. 
 
4. (SBU) Cross River is, like the rest of Nigerian States, 
dependent for its operating budget on the Federal 
Government\'s allocation to it of a share of national oil 
revenues.  Not surprisingly, Cross River officials claim 
their allocation is insufficient and the smallest in the 
nation.  In addition, the State wants to address another 
problem plaguing the Nigerian economy: there are almost no 
good jobs in the private sector, so most of the work force 
works for the government or goes into the military.  The 
State has two top priority projects to address these 
problems.  It is developing a free trade zone about five 
kilometers outside the city of Calabar.  The project is named 
\"Tinapa\" which means \"fun and leisure\" in the local Efik 
language and is expected to bring in about 300 jobs.  In 
addition, a large part of the current budget is reportedly 
devoted to the promotion, maintenance and further development 
of the Obudu Ranch. which everyone in Cross River hopes will 
bring in additional private sector investment and jobs. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment.  Tourism, as a way to diversify away from a 
dependence on oil, may be a non-starter for Cross River 
(reftel).  There is no capital investment in capacity 
(hotels, motels, restaurants etc.), in infrastructure 
(reliable electricity, potable water, passable roads), and no 
trained labor pool or training currently available.  The 
recently upgraded University of Calabar, like every other 
university and technical school in Nigeria, has no courses in 
hotel management, culinary arts, or travel and leisure 
services.  PolOffs spent two nights in the best hotel in 
Calabar.  Every room we saw was dirty, fixtures were hanging 
from walls, faucets leaked rusty water, and it was obvious 
that nothing had been properly repaired or replaced in years. 
 Not one single item on the breakfast menu was available at 
the hotel \"restaurant\", the tablecloths were dirty from the 
previous night\'s dinner customers (and stayed dirty for our 
two day stay), and managers as well as servers were obviously 
untrained. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment contd.  We also visited a fish farm and 
outdoor restaurant built a few years ago by a local 
physician.  Half a dozen grounds keepers were languidly 
raking up the few pieces of debris on the paths through this 
attractive, garden-like setting.  The actual ponds where the 
fish breeding is done and that supply the restaurant were so 
stagnant and choked with algae that we could not see the fish 
until one of the grounds keepers threw crumbled crackers in 
the water.  Then hundreds of fish, so many that they appeared 
to be one animal, boiled to the surface of the green and 
slimy water.  We also visited the Calabar National Museum, 
which is well-kept and housed in the former residence of the 
colonial governor.  After waking up the two attendants dozing 
in the afternoon heat in the gift shop, we noted that the 
last visitor had signed the guest book four month prior. 
There was a two month gap between him and the next previous 
visitor. 
 
7. (U) Comment contd.  Two weeks after our visit, newspapers 
reported that the federal Nigerian Tourism Development 
Corporation (NTDC) had been demanding payment of \"license 
fees\" from Cross River hotels and restaurants.  Governor 
Donald Duke issued a statement saying that \"henceforth no 
hotelier or hospitality operator...should pay monies...to 
(the NTDC) until further instructions are received from the 
newly established Cross River State Tourism Board which is 
the body regulating tourism and hospitality business in the 
State.\"   End comment. 
 
A few good women 
 
8. (U) In addition to familiarization with the region, a goal 
of the visit was to establish or re-establish contact with 
NGOs in the area.  PolOffs visited the Director of the Women 
in Detention Rights Initiative (WDRI), Margaret Okopko. 
Okopko is a practicing lawyer and was recently named a 
Special Advisor to the Governor for Women\'s Affairs working 
with the State\'s First Lady on these issues.  She told us 
that she started WDRI in 1999 and has, with occasional 
contributions from friends, funded it almost 100 per cent 
with her own money since then.  She says that, five years 
ago, she was visiting a (male) client in a Calabar jail when 
she heard a baby crying.  She went looking for the source of 
the crying and discovered a woman and infant sitting on the 
floor in the hallway of one of the cell blocks.  The woman 
told her that her husband had her arrested for domestic 
violence, and she and her child had been sleeping and sitting 
in the hall for three days.  Okopko left, rallied a group of 
her friends, and went back two days later to help the woman. 
This was the beginning of WDRI.  She, and her staff of three, 
try to provide free legal services in six southeast States. 
Currently there are about thirty women detained in their 
region; five in and around Calabar.  She says the 
organization wants to expand and enhance its services, and 
especially to develop educational programs that will change 
the treatment of Nigerian women accused of crime.  Okopko 
says that a woman charged with a crime can be incarcerated 
indefinitely and will certainly, immediately, and probably 
permanently, be ostracized.  This happens without formal 
charges, trial, conviction or any other examination of facts. 
 Okopko would, obviously, like help funding her 
organization\'s activities, and we advised her to submit 
program proposals for consideration. 
University of Calabar 
 
9. (U) The University of Calabar has a large and well 
maintained campus and boasts a student population of more 
than 15,000.  We met with Georgette Antigha, who manages the 
University\'s health education programs dealing with HIV/AIDS, 
STDs, teen pregnancy, and illegal drug use. She is also a 
Professor of Theater Arts in the Drama Department.  Antigha 
said the University program started in 1991 with funding from 
several sources, including UNICEF and USAID.  She said that, 
since the first Nigerian HIV/AID case was found in Cross 
River, programs like the one at the University are accepted 
and have benefited from high visibility early on.  At one 
point, the program was reaching thirty new students per week. 
 Funding began to dry up in 1999 and now the program reaches 
only about sixty students per year.  To maximize the impact 
of the program, Antigha says they have revamped the program 
to a \"train the trainers\" format.  Students volunteer and pay 
a token fee for the training.  She said she would like to see 
the program reach even more university students than it did 
in the beginning, as well as extend to secondary students. 
We encouraged her to submit program proposals. 
 
Akwa Ibom - More good women 
 
10. (U) Akwa Ibom was part of Cross River until it became a 
State in 1987.  The majority of its population of about three 
million are ethnic Ibibio, Annang and Oron, which lends logic 
to separating it from the administrative control of members 
of the three different ethnic groups that make up the 
population of Cross River.  Akwa Ibom is also one of the 
oil-producing Delta States that has a sea coast as its 
southern border.  In addition to its federal allocation of 
revenues from on-shore production, the recent GON move to 
allow the States a greater share in off-shore production will 
add significantly to Akwa Ibom\'s operating funds.  Our 
contact in Akwa Ibom, Comfort Umanah, is a young, energetic 
union leader.  She is an organizer and representative for the 
State\'s radio and television workers, and very well known to 
State officials up to and including the Governor. 
 
11. (U) We met with Deputy Majority Whip of the State House 
of Assembly Mabel Udongwo who is also chairperson of the 
Assembly Committee on Women, Children and the Media.  Udongwo 
lamented the fact that there are few women in politics 
nationally as well as in Akwa Ibom.  She said this was due 
more to cultural factors than to lack of financial backing. 
Although women are a majority of the Nigerian population, 
fifty percent of them are illiterate, and most girls, 
particularly in the villages, are not encouraged to aspire 
beyond an elementary education.  In addition, most Nigerians 
consider politics a violent business for men only, and few 
husbands would encourage their wives to enter the political 
arena.  Politics for  Udongwo, however, is a family affair. 
Mr. Udongwo is a Local Government (LG) Chairman and 
encouraged his wife, then working as a professor of 
management at the Polytechnic Institute, to run for LG 
office.  She says she saved for ten years to finance her 
campaign herself because she wanted to \"be where the action 
is.\"  She ran twice and lost, but on her third try she aimed 
higher and won a seat in the House of Assembly.  She has 
formed her own NGO, Women in Politics, because she says 
\"Women are more honest and sincere than men and, thus, are 
able to fight corruption better.\"  Udongwo says she has 26 
local women ready and able to run for LG office on March 27, 
and her aim is to get at least ten women into the House of 
Assembly in the 2007 elections.  Her focus has been on 
grassroots issues such as poverty, potable water, reliable 
electricity, good roads, and she has sponsored the State\'s 
first agricultural development bill. 
 
The \"Bag Man\" 
 
12. (SBU) The Governor\'s Political Advisor, Udo Ekpengyong, 
could not tear himself away from the televised quarterfinal 
of the All-Africa Soccer Championships to talk with us very 
long.  When he did, he had several long-standing complaints 
about Mobil Oil Company\'s operations in the State that he 
wanted USG help in resolving.  According to Ekpengyong, Akwa 
Ibom had attracted the oil companies because it can produce 
at least two thousand barrels per day and has no political or 
security problems.  (Comment.  Actually, Mobil reported that 
its Akwa Ibom operations produced over 500,000 barrels per 
day in 2003. End comment.)  He complained that Mobil has 100 
percent of its operations in Akwa Ibom, yet has never fully 
compensated the State for environmental damage caused by 
those operations.  In addition, Mobil keeps its office and 
in-country staff in Lagos.  Ekpengyong says Mobil should move 
all staff, administration, and the jobs they engender to Akwa 
Ibom.  He continued saying that, in addition to moving jobs 
from Lagos, Mobil needs to offer scholarships to Akwa Ibom\'s 
restless, unemployed youth.  Without this \"encouragement\" and 
hope for a brighter future, the youths might \"explode\" in 
violence and unrest, making it difficult to do business in 
Akwa Ibom. When asked what are the most pressing political 
issues on which he was advising the Governor, Ekpengyong said 
there are no pressing political issues in Akwa Ibom at this 
time.  He said there was no problem with the 2003 elections 
and the State is not adding new LGs, so there will be no 
problem with the 2004 elections.  He ended our meeting saying 
that the Governor, also, is focused on grassroots issues such 
as electricity, clean water, and fighting corruption.  He 
said that all day, from very early in the morning, he had 
been seeing supplicants in his office and been giving out 
money to help the people. 
 
The Speaker is upbeat 
 
13. (SBU) Affable House Speaker Nelson A. Efiong cut short a 
committee meeting to meet with us late in the afternoon on 
our last day in the Southeast.  He told us straight-away that 
his wife and children are American citizens and that, as Mrs. 
Efiong had said she never wanted to live in Nigeria, both she 
and the children were living in the US.  Efiong said he and 
his wife had met and married while they were in college in 
Texas.  Both were settled into careers in the US when 
governor Victor Attah asked him to return and be a part of 
his government.  Efiong said the Governor had been stymied in 
his first term by \"disgruntled losers\", but now the 
administration is moving on important issues such as 
streamlining the civil service, internal security, building 
and maintaining infrastructure, agricultural development, and 
encouraging private investment in the State.  He proudly 
noted that the Champion Beer Company, once a major employer 
in the capital city of Uyo, had recently been bought by an 
Indian group.  He said that the Champion factory has resumed 
production and local distribution, and planned national 
distribution by the end of 2004.  In addition, he said that 
the Meridian Hotels are committed to developing the Nwaniba 
Tourist Center on the sea coast.  Plans for the Tourist 
Center include a five-star hotel. 
 
Politics - No problem 
 
14. (U) Although several states are still wrestling with the 
local government issue, Efiong said Akwa Ibom does not have 
this problem.  The State set up its LGs using the 
parliamentary system rather than a presidential system. 
According to Efiong, this is a more efficient and less 
expensive way to run the LG system, and it insures more State 
oversight of how the LGs are run.  On the question of whether 
the State would create new LGs, he said that the recent 
federal decision on the on-shore off-shore allocation of oil 
revenues would bring more money into the State, thus doing 
away with the need for additional LGs.  Efiong said the 
Governor wants the people of Akwa Ibom to see the \"dividends 
of democracy\" in a government that serves the people and 
meets their needs.  The administration is interested in U. S. 
seminars, workshops, and exchange programs for legislators. 
 
15. (SBU)  Comment.  It is becoming clearer that, after years 
of watching military dictators and their cronies loot the 
national treasury, most Nigerians believed that the way to 
\"spread the wealth\" and \"get a piece of the action\" is to put 
on the trappings of democratic government.  Talking to second 
term officials is \"deja vu all over again.\"  Most have spent 
the past four years of elected government building mansions, 
stashing cash and paying off past and future supporters. 
Most still spout grandiose plans for future development and 
better lives for citizens, but country-wide the roads are in 
terrible shape, teachers at every level are not paid and 
constantly on strike, electricity is unavailable or 
unreliable, and even in the major cities drinking water is 
delivered by truck -- and only to those who can afford it. 
Some States have passed agricultural development legislation, 
but none of the officials we spoke to could point to a single 
State-funded agricultural project.  Every official we have 
spoken to has put a high priority on developing tourism to 
generate jobs and revenue, but none could cite ancillary 
development necessary to a successful tourism industry.  By 
the 2007 general elections, Nigerians will have waited eight 
years for the \"dividends of democracy\" to make a difference 
in the quality of life of the average citizen.  Those 
elections will tell what type civil society Nigerians want.

SUBJECT: NIGER DELTA: FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF WARRI 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
 
d (d). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: Fighting has broken out in the streets of 
Warri involving members of the Joint Task Force (JTF) 
\"Operation Restore Hope\" and civilians, likely militant Ijaw 
youths.  We have conflicting unconfirmed reports regarding 
the cause of the clashes, but it seems the fighting began 
with a skirmish between the JTF and armed Ijaw youths in the 
early morning of March 9.  It is confirmed that one JTF 
soldier and four Ijaw youths were killed.  Reports of 20 
additional civilian casualties have not been confirmed.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------- 
DIFFERING ACCOUNTS, DRUGS AT THE ROOT 
------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Joel Bisina, a moderate Ijaw and peace activist with 
the Niger Delta Professionals for Development, told POLOFF he 
received unconfirmed eyewitness reports from other sources 
that soldiers indiscriminately fired upon civilians in 
response to an argument between a soldier and a drug dealer. 
He said the shootings occurred in the waterfront neighborhood 
of Senegdene near the Nigerian Port Authority.  Bisina said 
he was told the soldier was purchasing marijuana, but refused 
to pay, and pulled his gun on the drug dealer.  A fistfight 
ensued and the angry soldier went to his barracks and 
returned with a truckload of his comrades.  According to 
Bisina, the soldiers then began to indiscriminately fire upon 
the crowd, resulting in 20 civilian deaths.  Bisina said 
residential buildings were burned in retaliation, which was 
confirmed to us by another source. Bisina reports the 
neighborhood was cordoned off by the military on March 9, 
preventing him from visiting the area. 
 
3.  (C) On March 10, JTF Commander Brigadier General Elias 
Zamani refuted Bisina\'s claim that innocent civilians were 
killed. Zamani told POLOFF that two soldiers, investigating 
the sound of gunfire at 0200 on March 9 inside the main 
market neighborhood of Awor along the waterfront, came across 
armed Ijaw youths. Awor is in the same general area as 
Senegdene. A gunfight ensued, leaving one soldier and four 
youths dead.  At 0400 JTF soldiers surrounded a warehouse in 
an area known to be an Ijaw youth hideout, arrested 70 youths 
and confiscated two rifles and some ammunition.  Zamani told 
POLOFF \"all is calm in Warri.\"  It is unknown at this time 
whether the March 10 fighting occurred before the telcon with 
Zamani. 
 
4.  (C) Reverend Sam Ken, an Ijaw youth leader, verified the 
shoot-out between Ijaw youths and the JTF to POLOFF and 
confirmed one soldier and four youths were killed.  Ken 
claimed that the shootout on March 9 was caused by armed Ijaw 
youths who entered Awor to buy cocaine.  The soldiers upon 
seeing the armed youths opened fire.  JTF reinforcements 
later arrived on the scene and Ken confirmed that they burned 
several Ijaw houses in the Awor neighborhood.  He said he 
heard reports that more deaths occurred as a result, but has 
been unable to verify this information.  Ken said he 
communicated with Zamani and brokered an end to the fighting. 
 He was unaware of any current fighting on Wednesday, March 
10. 
 
----------------------- 
FIGHTING MAY BE ONGOING 
----------------------- 
 
5.  (C) On Wednesday, March 10, ECONOFF spoke with Dennis 
Amachree, Halliburton\'s Country Manager for Corporate 
Security.  According to Amachree, soldiers fired \"wantonly\" 
in Warri again throughout the morning of March 10, and that 
the situation was degrading to \"complete mayhem.\" Amachree 
said one of his employees was moving about Warri on Wednesday 
morning attempting to assess the situation after Tuesday\'s 
clashes.  Amachree said buildings and homes had been burned. 
By mid-morning, according to Amachree, the employee came upon 
renewed fighting near the old airport, located near the 
geographic center of the city, about halfway between the port 
complex and the current airport.  Amachree said he had first 
received information that an oil company\'s waterfront 
facility had been raided by Ijaw boatman in the early hours 
of March 9, triggering a military response to defend the 
facility. But he said as of Wednesday he had heard that a 
drug bust resulted in a soldier\'s death, and now the 
soldiers were simply retaliating.  He said the ongoing 
fighting was not ethnic-based, but rather, was an unchecked 
reaction by angry soldiers. 
6. (C) Amachree said Delta Governor Ibori traveled to Warri 
on Wednesday in an attempt to stop the shooting.  Amachree 
said a meeting of security forces and government officials 
was taking place Wednesday late-morning. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT: Given these reports, it seems likely that 
soldiers came upon armed Ijaw youths attempting to buy 
cocaine and opened fire.  Reinforcements did later burn Ijaw 
homes.  During the exchange, it is likely that civilian 
deaths took place, but have yet to be confirmed.  Civilian 
killings by JTF soldiers have occurred intermittently within 
Warri since Operation Restore Hope began in August 2003. 
However, these killings were previously located at 
checkpoints and mainly targeted commercial motorcycle 
operators who refused to pay a 20 naira ($0.15) extortion fee 
as reported in the 2003 Human Rights Report. (Note: These 
same instances occur daily throughout Nigeria by police and 
security forces. End note.)  Stray bullets have killed 
civilians as well, including a 16-year old boy in 
mid-February.  To date, civilians have not been the targets 
of mass, indiscriminate killings. 
 
8. (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  JTF soldiers generally are poorly 
trained, poorly equipped, and receive minimal logistical 
support from military headquarters in Abuja.  In addition, 
they receive pay only sporadically, and often prey upon 
civilians through bribes, extortion, and intimidation to 
supplement their incomes.  JTF soldiers mainly man 
checkpoints within the city of Warri, and sometimes serve on 
Navy vessels escorting commercial supply convoys for oil 
companies. They rarely engage militant youths directly in the 
swamps.  On occasions where they have engaged with militant 
youths, they are often out-gunned and are prone to flee 
instead of holding their ground. 
 
9.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  Recent killings of soldiers and 
sailors have not provoked retaliatory strikes as some Delta 
watchers anticipated.  However, eight months of relative 
boredom and inadequate resources may have taken their toll, 
breaking down morale and increasing tension between the 
military and civilians. Innocent civilian casualties are 
always at risk.  END COMMENT.

STATE PLEASE PASS FCC 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECPS, ECON, EINV, NI 
SUBJECT: NITEL: NEW MANAGEMENT, LITTLE CHANGE 
 
1. (U) Summary: One year into its three-year management 
of Nigeria\'s national carrier, Nigerian 
Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), the Netherlands\' 
Pentascope International has generated surprisingly 
little change.  Executives remain optimistic, but given 
Pentascope\'s slow progress in implementing reforms, 
repairing and expanding fixed line and mobile networks, 
and strengthening NITEL\'s balance sheets, that optimism 
may be misplaced.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) For months, Pentascope executives have awaited 
approval of proposed structural reforms.  President 
Obasanjo\'s mid-November decision to dissolve NITEL\'s 
board delayed consideration, and the board\'s nwest 
members, appointed January 13, have yet to take a 
decision.  Pentascope\'s proposal calls for general 
managers to report directly to NITEL\'s chief executive 
(rather than to various executive directors) and for 
territorial managers to report to NITEL\'s chief 
technical officer, a move that would streamline 
operations and hasten decision-making.  NITEL\'s Lagos 
Zone General Manager, Segun Oguntoyinbo, believes the 
proposed reforms would generate \"radical change,\" but 
he is not optimistic they will be introduced anytime 
soon.  Decisions within NITEL are taken slowly, he 
says, largely due to the need to win government 
approval. 
 
3. (U) The board\'s failure to approve reforms may 
present obstacles to Pentascope\'s expansion plans.  The 
firm\'s business plan is ambitious, but progress is 
slow.  The plan estimates capital expenditures at $900 
million over three years, calls for the rehabilitation 
of existing networks, and projects the installation of 
600,000 new fixed lines (to bring total installed 
capacity to 1.3 million lines) and 1.2 million new 
mobile lines (up from about 120,000 now) by the time 
Pentascope relinquishes management control.  Given the 
pace of work, it is unlikely NITEL will meet that 
deadline.  The firm has only recently begun 
rehabilitation efforts, and most observers are 
skeptical of its ability to meet even the relatively 
modest target of 150,000 lines per year.  Network 
expansion is behind schedule - managers expected to 
complete the installation of new mobile lines months 
ago - and future attempts will likely fall even further 
behind, not least because contract terms are 
unrealistically short. 
 
4. (U) Oguntoyinbo points out that under a recently 
awarded contract, Germany\'s Siemens and China\'s Huawei 
Technologies have only nine months to add 250,000 fixed 
lines to NITEL\'s Lagos network.  It may be virtually 
impossible to meet that deadline, but delays are 
nothing new.  Plans for 41 new switches have yet to be 
implemented, and local fixed wireless pilot programs 
are moving more slowly than expected.  According to 
Oguntoyinbo, NITEL has installed 10,000 fixed wireless 
lines in each of two locations, but the pilots have yet 
to generate significant results.  If they do, NITEL may 
elect to abandon fixed lines in favor of fixed wireless 
networks - the latter are less expensive and suited to 
both urban and rural areas - but as in everything else, 
progress may be slow. 
 
5. (U) NITEL has performed dismally over the last 
fourteen years.  It boasts only 700,000 fixed lines, of 
which only 500,000 are even sporadically operational, 
and provides notoriously poor service.  Some 60 percent 
of calls are never completed, and nearly 180 faults per 
100 lines are recorded annually.  Pentascope executives 
hope to increase call completion rates to 95 percent 
and reduce interruptions to fewer than 50 faults per 
100 lines, but improvements have been minor.  The 
firm\'s balance sheet is weak - federal and state 
governments, the military, and corporate and individual 
customers owe nearly $320 million in unpaid fees - and 
it typically manages to collect only 70 or 80 percent 
of total annual revenues.  Pentascope has recouped $30 
million since taking over, but debtors have been slow 
to settle accounts.  Revenue collection may improve 
with the introduction of pre-paid billing systems for 
fixed lines, but plans are still being tested. 
 
6. (U) Not surprisingly, NITEL has steadily been losing 
market share to competitors.  Lagos now accounts for 
only 30 percent of NITEL\'s total revenue, down from 60 
percent a few years ago, and customers are steadily 
leaving NITEL for mobile service providers and private 
telephone operators.  These provide more reliable 
service at comparable or lower prices, and the ready 
availability of lines eliminates the months- or years- 
long wait for NITEL lines.  The recent entry of a 
second national operator, Globacom, will likely 
increase competition, but Oguntoyinbo believes the 
Nigerian telecommunications market is large enough to 
absorb several different players.  He \"appreciates the 
challenge\" of Globacom\'s entry but believes NITEL has 
several advantages over its competitors.  The firm\'s 
executives know the market, he says, and have the 
technical expertise and long-standing customer 
relationships that others lack. 
 
7. (U) Oguntoyinbo expects private telephone operators 
to continue working with NITEL, if only to take 
advantage of the preferential interconnection fees he 
expects NITEL to offer.  In the meantime, Pentascope 
executives are doing what they can to retain customers. 
In mid-December they introduced a 75 percent reduction 
in NITEL\'s international tariffs, cutting rates from 
N99 ($0.73) per minute to N34 ($0.25) per minute in off- 
peak hours.  Executives report a 20 to 25 percent 
increase in traffic, and many expect the numbers to 
improve.  Oguntoyinbo hopes, if nothing else, that 
Pentascope will succeed in increasing NITEL\'s emphasis 
on customer service.  The customer should be king, he 
says, and NITEL should work to maintain the integrity 
of its brand. 
 
8. (U) Comment: Observers applauded Pentascope\'s 
arrival early last year, but the firm has struggled to 
meet expectations.  Some believe its executives found 
NITEL in a more pronounced state of disrepair than they 
expected, set unrealistic goals, and are now paying the 
price.  Pentascope\'s efforts to improve NITEL\'s 
infrastructure, expand existing fixed line and mobile 
networks, and strengthen the firm\'s balance sheets have 
been complicated by the necessity of coping with 
government interference and entrenched bureaucracy.  As 
such, it is perhaps unsurprising that Pentascope\'s 
executives have generated relatively little change over 
the last year.  If they continue to make so little 
progress, it may be some time before NITEL is ready for 
privatization.  Oguntoyinbo believes the GON may sell 
15 to 20 percent of its shares in an initial public 
offering (IPO) later this year, but most observers take 
such statements lightly.  GON officials talked about an 
IPO in August 2002 and again in November 2003 but 
delayed the event both times.  The process has been 
botched before, and it will likely be botched again.

1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The rate and level of violence in the 
Niger Delta has been increasing in recent weeks (ref A). 
Plans for March 27 elections in several key Local Government 
Areas (LGA) have been suspended, fueling tension between 
ethnic groups in the region.  Meanwhile, thousands of 
internally displaced Itsekiri are agitating for a return to 
their homes as their living conditions steadily worsen. 
Signs of preparations for renewed conflict between Ijaw and 
Itsekiri in the riverine areas are reported.  If ethnic 
conflict erupts, the military\'s reaction is unpredictable as 
troops are increasingly weary of their Delta deployment and 
pressure for a solution is mounting on all sides.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
ITSEKIRIS TO RESIST ELECTION POSTPONEMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Local Government Area (LGA) elections are scheduled 
nationwide for March 27.  The Delta State Government has 
postponed elections in Warri North, Warri South, and Warri 
Southwest LGAs, which have seen several spates of violence in 
the last seven years between rival Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic 
groups contesting land access, oil revenues, and political 
power.  Attempts to improve relations through peace dialogues 
have produced mixed results.  Although support for 
NGO-organized peace dialogues is strong (ref B), ethnic 
groups recently pulled out of the Delta State Government\'s 
Inter-Ethnic Dialogue. Delta State Governor James Ibori, 
whose oft-trumpeted \"peace plan\" to quell violence in the 
state is fizzling, championed the dialogue.  The dialogue 
ended when the state government, claiming that all parties 
were in agreement, unilaterally postponed LGA elections in 
and around Warri to prevent violence. 
 
3.  (C) Daniel Reyenieju, President of the Itsekiri National 
Youth Congress, on March 8 told POLOFF the Itsekiri oppose 
the election postponement and will fight the decision in the 
courts.  (Note: In the Nigerian context, youths are young and 
middle-aged men. End Note.)  Reyenieju, along with other 
prominent Ijaw and Itsekiri elders and youth leaders, had 
participated in the Inter-Ethnic Dialogue. According to 
Reyenieju, a discussion about local elections never took 
place nor was agreed upon by the Itsekiri.  Talks broke down 
and the Itsekiri walked out. 
 
4.  (C) Reyenieju was dismayed, frustrated, and angry over 
the postponement of elections.  He fears that when elections 
do take place, Ijaws will flood the LGAs with non-residents 
in a bid to rig the outcome.  Moreover, he is at odds with 
the state government\'s reasoning to postpone elections to 
avoid an escalation of violence.  Violence always accompanies 
elections in Nigeria, he explained, and stressed that 
tensions were much greater and violence more commonplace when 
Ibori and President Olusegun Obasanjo were up for election in 
April 2003.  Ibori, a member of the President\'s ruling 
People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), received Itsekiri support in 
his election bid despite, Reyenieju emphatically said, the 
displacement of thousands from the Benin River and the 
burning of Koko, one of the most heavily populated Itsekiri 
villages, the day before the election.  Since March 2003, 
Reyenieju pointed out that several Ijaw militant youths have 
been appointed as Special Assistants to the Governor -- a 
position that brings access to the governor and money. 
 
----------------------------------- 
IJAW SUPPORT ELECTION POSTPONEMENT 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Daniel Ekpide, Secretar of the Federated Niger Delta 
Ijaw Communities (FDIC), told POLOFF on March 4 that the 
election pstponement showed a \"serious desire by the state 
government 
 resolve issues.\"  The Ijaw have beenagitating 
for greater political representation wthin the LGAs since 
1997.  In 1997, the Warri Southwest LGA seat was transferred 
from an Ijaw villge to an Itsekiri village by the state 
governmen, sparking intense violence.  Each of the three 
GAs is divided into 10 wards.  In each of these LGAs, the 
Itsekiri hold the plurality of wards and, therefore, control 
the LGA chairman and chancelorships.  As a result, claims of 
political disenfranchisement have fueled Ijaw demands for 
ward redistricting and an increase in the number of wards 
within the LGA.  Ekpide has called for ward redistricting 
based on the most recent 1991 population census, which, he 
contends, shows the Ijaw are more populous in the region. 
 
6.  (C) Contrary to reports on March 10 (refA), Ekpide 
characterized Warri as calm, claiming there was no tension 
within the riverine Ijaw areas.  He stated the Ijaw were 
keeping \"hush,\" despite recent attacks by the Itsekiri -- 
attacks that each group has blamed on the other.  Relations 
with the JTF and police were also categorized as good, 
despite sporadic skirmishes.  He said the Ijaw were 
cooperating with state government- and NGO-led peace 
dialogues and blamed the slowing progress on the Itsekiri. 
Ekpide further described the distressed state of the Ijaw 
within the riverine area and found fault with the state 
government for the lack of basic health and education 
services. 
 
-------------------------------- 
THE DELTA\'S INTERNALLY DISPLACED 
-------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) The Nigerian Commission for Refugees reports that 
800,000 Nigerians are internally displaced nation-wide due to 
communal violence, creating volatile pockets throughout 
Nigeria.  In Delta State, 9,000 Itsekiri have been displaced 
from their homes along the Benin River, and 1,000 Ijaw have 
fled their homes in Warri Southwest LGA.  Internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Delta State have not received 
humanitarian aid from the GON, but have instead relied on a 
$50,000 grant from the USG implemented by the International 
Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH).  Displaced 
for almost a year and with living conditions steadily 
deteriorating, the IDPs are frustrated and edgy.  Donor 
fatigue has set in among their financial supporters.  The 
most acute is the 9,000 Itsekiri IDPs living in and around 
the Urhobo city of Sapele.  Reyenieju reports that children 
have not been attending school, young girls are forced into 
prostitution, young men have become criminals, and the weak 
and elderly are dying (ref C). 
 
8.  (SBU) Reyenieju claims the USG has been \"lazy\" in 
comparison to its previous aid efforts in the region. 
Appreciative of past support, he advocates for continued aid, 
but prefers a longer-term solution and requested that the USG 
petition the GON to enable IDPs to return to their homes. 
Ekpide also stated conditions were worsening for Ijaw IDPs in 
the region.  (Note: The USG has been active in the Delta 
through its initial aid to the IDPs, the funding of two peace 
dialogues implemented by NGOs, and the recent agreement by 
Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum and USAID to begin a cassava 
production program.  POLOFF emphasized these programs to 
Reyenieju, but with the exception of the joint Shell-USAID 
program, the others are nearing completion and future funding 
has not yet been identified.  End note.) 
 
-------------------------------- 
IMMINENT VIOLENCE NEAR ESCRAVOS? 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) David Beddow, Security Coordinator for Chevron 
Nigeria Ltd\'s (CNL) Escravos transfer terminal and tank farm, 
told ECONOFF on March 8 that \"an offensive by the Itsekiri 
could be imminent.\"  Beddow believes attacks will only be 
delayed due to lack of fuel and boats.  In mid-February, CNL 
security staff reported to ECONOFF that a group of Ijaw 
youths in speedboats harassed nearby Itsekiri villages within 
sight of Escravos.  The youths dressed in warrior white, 
waved white flags and placed one on an oil jetty farther up 
the Escravos River. During the wave of violence that spread 
through the Delta swamps in March 2003, workers at the 
Escravos terminal noted that Ijaw attack parties wore white 
and displayed white flags during their attacks on Itsekiri 
villages. 
 
10. (C) Reyenieju confirmed the incident to POLOFF and said 
the flag staking was symbolic to show that the Ijaw were now 
claiming the land. When asked if the Itsekiri were readying 
themselves for defense or attack, Reyenieju claimed that the 
Itsekiri would only defend themselves.  He stated he did not 
see any signs of renewed violence in the creeks, claiming 
that the Itsekiri had been chased from their homes and now 
only existed in large numbers in and around Escravos. 
 
11.  (C) The Escravos terminal, a joint venture of 
ChevronTexaco and the GON, is protected by approximately 200 
soldiers of the Joint Task Force, \"Operation Restore Hope,\" 
which was sent to the region in August 2003 to restore order 
in the Warri area.  Beddow told ECONOFF that CNL is not 
taking any action as a result of their concerns of increased 
violence; nor does he anticipate that JTF forces would engage 
in \"inter-community battles.\"  CNL has recently started a 
slow return to their production facilities in the surrounding 
riverine area, receiving JTF escorts and protection for their 
flow stations and their supply transports (septel). 
 
12.  (C) Brigadier General Elias Zamani, Commanding Officer 
of the JTF, told POLOFF on March 8 that rumors of increased 
violence exist, but the JTF is prepared to maintain the 
\"fragile peace\" and implement the decision of the Delta State 
Government to postpone LGA elections.  He stressed that the 
right of the people to participate in the electoral process 
should not be abridged, but contended the postponement was in 
the best interest of peace.  In general, Zamani characterized 
the situation in the Delta as suffering from \"normal 
skirmishes,\" but that the JTF was containing violence, as 
opposed to controlling it.  Zamani said he had no fears of 
renewed kidnappings, referring to the common practice of 
abducting oil company employees and contractors for ransom. 
 
13. (C) As part of the Inter-Ethnic Dialogue, the Delta State 
Government promised to return the Itsekiri IDPs to their 
homes along the Benin River.  The Itsekiri welcome the 
initiative, pending a security guarantee.  BG Zamani told 
POLOFF that the JTF staff has drafted a security plan and 
will work together with the Delta State Government.  Yet, no 
movement on the plan has been seen.  Reyenieju has little 
confidence that either can produce what they have been 
promised.  Enraged, Reyenieju stated his only enemy was the 
Delta State Government whom he chided for not providing basic 
social services or showing a sincere desire to address the 
root causes of the conflict.  He renewed his claims that the 
Itsekiri would not go on the offensive or \"transfer its anger 
with the government onto other groups,\" but would deal 
directly with the state government on these issues. 
 
14.  (C) COMMENT: The JTF does not have the capability to 
patrol and maintain security in the riverine area.  Instead 
it has focused on securing oil installations, selectively 
limiting illegal bunkering activity off its coast through the 
use of USG-gifted buoy tenders, and keeping peace in the city 
of Warri.  This situation on the ground makes it unlikely the 
Itsekiri will safely return to the Benin River in the near 
future.  The postponement of the LGA elections is a win for 
the Ijaw, and may signal concessions from the Delta State 
Government in their favor. Ijaw youths have been folded into 
the state government by Governor Ibori, from which they 
appear to have benefited financially.  Elsewhere in Delta 
State, people seem apathetic towards the LGA elections, as 
all have accepted that the PDP candidates will win. 
 
15.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  Ibori\'s motives, however, are 
unclear.  It is uncertain whether he is keeping troublemakers 
easily accessible and manipulated, or whether the youths, who 
acted as hired thugs during the previous elections and now 
facilitate illegal bunkering, are being rewarded for their 
past and current cooperation.  What cannot be ignored is the 
growing dissatisfaction with the status quo by the common 
Ijaw and Itsekiri living in the riverine area, who may not be 
easily controlled or manipulated from Warri.  Claims by both 
sides that neither will initiate attacks seem hollow, 
especially given reports of provision hoarding. 
 
16.  (C) COMMENT CONTINUED.  The reaction of the JTF is 
another wildcard.  Even though stationed in large number at 
the Escravos Terminal, the JTF does not have a history of 
engaging unless their facilities are directly threatened. 
But recent clashes between military forces and residents of 
Warri suggest some troops have reached a breaking-point based 
on fatigue, impatience, or boredom (ref A).  Candid comments 
to ConGen Officers by commanders showing concern over the 
potential backlash from the international community for any 
collateral damage inflicted on civilians may be lessening in 
credibility as the stalemate in the Delta drags on. 
Commanders may be faced with increased pressure from Abuja to 
take more aggressive action, utilizing unruly, poorly 
trained, and ill-equipped troops who can become unmanageable 
when responding to a threat or crisis

1.  (C)  Summary:  During February, there was a marked 
increase in reported incidents in the Lagos Consular 
district.  RSO statistics for February indicate an increase 
in overall crime in Lagos from January.  The significance of 
the incidents involving AMCITS is that there have not been 
any for a considerable period of time.  RSO believes it is 
too early to tell whether the increase of incidents is 
directed against the population in general or foreigners in 
particular.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Reftels outline the incidents involving AMCITS 
during February 2004.  The incidents range from errors in 
judgment on the part of the victim to outright criminal acts 
carried out by police and criminal elements.  Until February, 
it was common for Consulate to be stopped by police and asked 
for a \"dash\", but rarely ordered to go to a police station. 
The only incident involving an American Consulate staff 
member being taken to a police station last year was the 
result of the American not having his Consulate 
Identification, and no radio or cell phone with him when he 
was detained by a policeman on a local beach known to be a 
high crime area.  Otherwise, Consulate staff and American 
School teachers have not been regularly victimized in 
criminal incidents. 
 
3.  (C)  RSO maintains criminal statistics gleaned from 
monitoring police radio frequencies.  Statistics indicate 
general criminal activities for February 2004 in line with or 
less than February 2003.  However, there is an increase in 
crime from January 2004 to February 2004.  A sampling of the 
crime statistics including the first eleven days of March 
2004 is noted below: 
 
Month/Year Carjacking Murder Home Invasion Missing Persons

      2 
 
These statistics represent general trends in crime against 
the general population in Lagos. 
 
4.  (C)  Post officials have been in contact with Lagos State 
Government officials, British, Dutch, Russian, and French 
diplomats as well as business contacts through OSAC. 
Criminal acts have increased against the foreign community as 
a whole.  For example, a security officer from an 
international organization was advised that he violated a 
traffic law and the policeman entered his vehicle.  When the 
security officer advised the policeman that he had to notify 
his staff, the policeman excused himself for the 
misunderstanding.  A Russian diplomat\'s car was shot at by 
thieves who were in the process of robbing two buses.  Two 
Russian females were injured.  A British national returning 
from Benin was stopped on the Badagery Road twice by illegal 
roadblocks and relieved of cash.  At the most recent OSAC 
executive board meeting, OSAC officers were advised that 
since February first eight robberies by a gang using commando 
tactics has robbed companies along the river in Warri.  Shell 
has been robbed twice, the second time with resulting deaths. 
 A South African father and his daughter were robbed by two 
Nigerian men wielding machetes.  In Port Harcourt, there has 
been an upsurge in thefts of Toyota crew cab pickup trrucks. 
Last year there was a spate of carjackings involving Toyota 
crew cabs and until February there had been a lull in thefts. 
 Toyota pickup engines are reportedly used for repairing 
generators.  Incidents involving Americans have been reported 
reftels. 
 
5.  (SBU)  More disturbing than attacks against foreign 
nationals are the number of attacks against Nigerian 
officials.  These attacks have been against political figures 
and other senior government officials.  Most, if not all, of 
these officials have been escorted by protective details. 
Press reports advised the President has decried the increase 
in criminal incidents and directed the police to take action. 
 
6.  (C)  Post believes it is too early to determine whether 
these incidents indicate a sharp rise in crime that will 
continue or a spike in crime that will subside in the coming 
months.  Last year in the same period, many of the \"area 
boys\" and others involved in current criminal activities were 
occupied with elections as members of politicians\' armed 
entourages.  Most were armed by the politicians and were not 
disarmed at the conclusion of elections. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Post held a town meeting on February 27th and RSO 
has sent out security tips to Mission community, OSAC 
members, and diplomatic Crisis Cooperation group.  The 
Consular Section has included these tips in the most recent 
Wardens\' message.  RSO has met with the Commissioner of Lagos 
State Police and the Deputy Commissioner for Operations to 
express his concern over the incidents involving AMCITS. 
Post continues to monitor these criminal incidents.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: WAR ON NAFDAC: THE BATTLE AGAINST 
COUNTERFEIT DRUGS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Just three months after an attempted 
assassination of Director General Dr. Dorothy Akunyili, 
Nigeria\'s National Agency for Food and Drug 
Administration and Control (NAFDAC) seems to be under 
attack.  Fires gutted the agency\'s Lagos office on 
March 7, and less than 72 hours later, its Kaduna 
laboratory burned down.  Despite these attacks, 
NAFDAC\'s management and staff remain focused on their 
goal of significantly reducing the manufacture and 
distribution of counterfeit drugs.  Barring further 
attacks on its personnel and facilities, the agency may 
achieve some success.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Fires gutted NAFDAC\'s Lagos office last Sunday, 
just weeks after the agency restated its commitment to 
reducing the proliferation of counterfeit drugs.  The 
fire affected key directorates of the agency\'s Lagos 
operations, including the Ports Inspection Directorate 
(PID), the Establishment Inspection Directorate (EID), 
and the director general\'s office.  According to one of 
NAFDAC\'s senior staff, the agency lost records of its 
port activities and raids.  Parts of its Enforcement 
Directorate and Administrative Department survived 
intact, but hundreds of records were lost.  The PID and 
EID have been relocated, and the agency\'s director 
general is now expected to work from Abuja. 
 
3. (U) Even as investigations into the cause of the 
fire began, NAFDAC\'s Kaduna laboratory, its largest, 
burned down.  According to news reports, fires started 
simultaneously in the laboratory\'s three buildings 
around 0300 on Wednesday, March 10, ultimately 
destroying millions of dollars of equipment.  Nigeria\'s 
National Assembly responded by calling for 24-hour 
surveillance of all NAFDAC facilities, and the agency\'s 
senior staff advised personnel to keep a low profile, 
particularly in light of speculations that a powerful 
cartel may have been involved in the two incidents. 
 
4. (U) The fires follow three reported attempts on the 
life of NAFDAC Director General Dr. Dorothy Akunyili. 
Late last December, gunmen allegedly attacked Dr. 
Akunyili in her hometown, Agulu, in Anambra State. 
Earlier incidents took place at her home in Abuja while 
she was on official trips.  The GON responded by 
calling for increased security around Dr. Akunyili and 
NAFDAC\'s staff and facilities nationwide. The GON 
reportedly deployed security personnel, and NAFDAC 
hired private security agencies at several of its 
facilities. 
 
5. (U) Many observers believe NAFDAC\'s moderate success 
in reducing the manufacture and distribution of 
counterfeit drugs may have earned it very powerful 
enemies.  According to the Chairman of NAFDAC\'s 
Governing Council, Dr. Andy Andem, the agency destroyed 
substandard and fake products worth N6.07 billion ($45 
million) in 72 exercises in the year to November. 
Andem says the agency secured thirty convictions in 
counterfeit drugs-related cases in 2003 and believes 
another forty cases are pending in Nigerian courts. 
NAFDAC routinely embarks on enlightenment campaigns to 
educate the public about genuine products and expose 
fake versions and their manufacturers, if the 
identities of the latter are known.  Such exposure may 
not sit well with producers of counterfeit drugs. 
 
6. (U) NAFDAC\'s regulation and control of the 
manufacture, distribution, sale, and use of drugs has 
improved significantly since Dr. Akunyili was appointed 
in April 2001.  In the three years since she took 
office, Dr. Akunyili has reorganized NAFDAC\'s 
operations and created directorates for registration 
and regulatory affairs, laboratory services, narcotics 
and controlled substances, ports inspections, 
establishment, and enforcement.  The new directorates 
have given the agency a clearer focus and significantly 
improved its success in the fight against counterfeit 
drugs.  NAFDAC staff believe three GON policies have 
also helped: the ban on the importation of drugs and 
other regulated products through land borders; the 
designation of specific ports and airports through 
which drugs and pharmaceutical raw materials can be 
imported; and the requirement that all shipping 
companies and the Nigerian Ports Authority release 
shipping and cargo manifests to the agency\'s 
inspectors. 
 
7. (U) Comment: No security staff were present when 
Econ staff visited NAFDAC\'s Lagos office.  Senior 
officials point out that although NAFDAC personnel 
remain committed to reducing the manufacture and 
distribution of counterfeit products, the agency 
remains vulnerable to future attacks.  Like many 
unresolved fires at public offices like the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation and the Lagos High 
Court, the fires at NAFDAC raised suspicions that 
individuals acted to destroy incriminating evidence. 
If so, they obviously succeeded, as critical case 
records and data were lost.  NAFDAC personnel say they 
will continue to try to reduce the manufacture and 
attacks on personnel and facilities and with Dr. 
Akunyili\'s increased determination, the agency may have 
some success.  End comment.

SUBJECT:  NIGERIA: POLITICAL MURDERS OR MURDERED POLITICIANS? 
 
REF:  LAGOS 545 AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.   (U) The spate of high profile attacks and killings of 
prominent Nigerian politicians and public figures has again 
caused many to question the strength, and even the future, of 
democratic governance in Nigeria.  In the last three weeks, at 
least ten prominent Nigerians have been brutally attacked. 
Several have died in the attacks, while a few managed to escape. 
The boisterous and raucous Nigerian press is full of speculation 
that the killings and attacks are somehow politically motivated. 
One of the papers reported that there had been 32 \"political 
killings\" since 1999.  Another printed a list of fifty-five 
supposedly politically connected murders and attacks in the 1999- 
2004 period - including a couple beheaded by an angry \"lover\" and 
incidents involving \"students\" stabbed in fights.  Less than half 
of the list has any connection to politics or politicians. 
Nevertheless, the number of attacks recently cannot be ignored 
although the jury is still out on what this all means. 
 
Dikibo murder 
 
2.  (U) The first weekend in March, all the newspapers carried 
front-page pictures of the body of Chief Aminasoari Dikibo lying 
in a pool of blood on the back seat of his car.  According to 
witnesses, Dikibo, a National Vice Chairman (South-south region) 
of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was being driven to Abuja 
for a meeting when his car was ambushed and he was killed with a 
single bullet to the head.  President Olusegun Obasanjo quickly 
(too quickly, according to some) labeled the incident an 
attempted robbery, and the police rounded up the usual five 
suspects.  In only one instance in the growing number of high 
profile murders in the last five years, the case of the murder of 
Attorney General Bola Ige, has anyone been charged or brought to 
trial.  In the last two years, the victims in southern Nigeria 
include not only Ige, but also Rivers State opposition politician 
Marshall Harry and PDP leader Andrew Ogun.  On the gubernatorial 
front, Lagos State Governor Bola Tinubu\'s convoy was attacked in 
Anambra State; the Benue State governor\'s convoy was attacked a 
few days earlier. Currently, Abia State Governor Orji Kalu is 
accusing a top PDP operative of threatening to kill him.  Last 
week saw an attack on Lagos\' Third Mainland Bridge against the 
Chief of Naval Staff\'s convoy and three luxury buses were struck 
on the same bridge a few days later. 
 
Attack on Tinubu\'s convoy 
 
3. (U) According to news reports, on March 6, gunmen attacked 
Tinubu\'s armed, twelve-car convoy on its way back to Lagos from 
Anambra State.  Witnesses (and even the Governor himself) 
initially told the press that the attack was an attempted 
robbery.  Governor Tinubu was not in any of the vehicles when the 
attack occurred, but one policeman attached to Tinubu\'s entourage 
was seriously wounded.  There are unconfirmed reports that 
several attackers were killed. 
 
4. (U) There are conflicting views on whether the attack was, in 
fact, politically motivated.  Some pundits allege that the attack 
could be the handiwork of such prominent personalities as Chief 
Chris Uba, a major acto in the crisis that followed the botched 
kidnapping of Anambra State Governor, Dr. Chris Ngige.  Uba is 
said to be deeply angered by Tinubu\'s support for his political 
rival, Ngige, and could have seen Tinubu\'s unexpected presence in 
Anambra as an opportunity to teach the insubordinate governor a 
lesson by example. 
 
5. (U) Another suspect is everyone\'s favorite bad boy and 
candidate for villain, former Military President, Ibrahim 
Babangida (IBB).  IBB is rumored to be very uncomfortable with 
Tinubu\'s growing popularity in the southwest and is said to be 
having difficulty accepting Tinubu\'s emergence as the most 
popular Yoruba politician.  IBB\'s presidential ambitions are no 
secret, and he has been working since the last elections to win 
 
SIPDIS 
the south for himself in 2007. 
 
6. (U) Whether any of these theories proves true or not, it is 
clear that any successful attempt on Governor Tinubu\'s life would 
have had serious consequences for Nigeria.  Members of Tinubu\'s 
Cabinet and the Lagos State Police Commissioner told CG that 
there would almost certainly have been spontaneous attacks by the 
Yorubas in Lagos and other parts of the southwest against 
perceived Igbo and Hausa enemies.  Such attacks could have 
attracted retaliatory killings of Yoruba in other parts of 
Nigeria.  Gangs of unemployed and restless youths would have 
joined in the fray to release pent up frustrations, and the 
criminal element would have certainly taken advantage of the 
breakdown in civil order. 
 
7. (SBU) Sources close to the Governor have told CG that the 
attack on Tinubu was much more serious and organized than has 
been reported, while the Deputy Governor\'s Special Assistant told 
PolSpec that the attack happened exactly as reported in the 
papers.  Despite our inquiries, so far no one has answered the 
good investigator\'s question:  \"Who would benefit if Tinubu were 
suddenly removed?\"  Although his death could cause civil disorder 
and ethnic clashes for a period, there is not one \"suspect\" who 
clearly wants to step into the vacuum such an event would leave. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: In addition to the violence against Governor 
Tinubu and other prominent Nigerians, the southern states have 
recently seen an upswing of crime against ordinary people, both 
Nigerian and foreign, residents as well as diplomats (reftel). 
To date, there is no discernible line connecting the dots to a 
particular culprit or condition that explains these events - be 
they political or criminal.  Nor can we tell whether this spate 
of violence constitutes a spike or a trend.  The killings and 
other criminal activities cut across all racial, ethnic, 
geographic, economic and political groups.  Post continues to 
monitor the situation closely and will report further 
developments.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: PRISONS CONDITIONS AT KIRI KIRI 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On February 19, POLOFF and LEGATT met with 
prison officials of the Lagos State Command and interviewed 
detainees awaiting trial at Kiri Kiri Medium Security Prison. 
 Officials and prisoners alike highlighted problems with 
overcrowding, healthcare, and poor record keeping.  They 
complained of NPS\'s lack of resources and the judiciary\'s 
inability to process detainees, many of whom have been 
awaiting trial for up to sixteen years.  Poor police 
investigative techniques, the use of arbitrary detention, and 
malfeasance also present problems.  Fraud, waste, and abuse 
of prison resources are common among prison officials.  NGOs, 
not the federal government, provide aid and support.  As a 
result of these conditions, prisoners rioted recently in 
Lagos.  No AMCITS are known to be held at Kiri Kiri Medium 
Security Prison.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------- 
OVERCROWDED PRISONS 
------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) The Lagos State Command of the National Prison 
Service (NPS) has a capacity of 2,795 prisoners in its five 
facilities.  NPS officials stated they are housing a total of 
4,911 prisoners in Kiri Kiri Maximum Security, Kiri Kiri 
Medium Security, Kiri Kiri Women\'s, Badagry, and Ikoyi 
Prisons.  The Lagos prison system is at 175% capacity.  The 
most acutely overcrowded are Kiri Kiri Medium and Ikoyi 
Prisons.  Kiri Kiri Medium Security has a capacity for 740 
inmates, but holds approximately 1,259 inmates -- 170% of its 
capacity.  Built to house 800 prisoners, Ikoyi Prison now 
holds 2,105 -- 263% of its capacity.  In contrast, Badagry 
Prison, which has a 300-prisoner capacity, is under utilized. 
 
3.  (SBU) The press reports over 2500 cases of scabies, 800 
asthmatics, and 300 cases of tuberculosis in the Lagos prison 
system.  The HIV/AIDS rate is believed high and screening for 
the disease is irregular at best.  Limited AIDS awareness and 
education is received by prisoners and anti-retroviral drug 
treatment is rare.  Narcotics use is common and undermines 
disease prevention efforts.  Each prisoner is given a ration 
of 150 naira ($1.11) per day, which prison officials deem 
inadequate, believing 500 naira ($3.70) would be needed.  As 
a result, most prisoners are malnourished and rely on family 
members to supplement their food rations. 
 
4.  (SBU) Children are also incarcerated with adults and 
subjected to the same health risks.  NPS officials and 
prisoners told POLOFF that the police often bring teenage 
boys into Kiri Kiri Medium Security Prison and falsify their 
age with fraudulently obtained court documents.  Prisoners 
stated that 40 to 50 children are erroneously housed at Kiri 
Kiri Medium Security Prison due to this practice.  They claim 
the police have threatened the children with death if they 
reveal their true age to prison officials.  Ikoyi Prison, 
which has a separate juvenile facility, is so overcrowded 
that children regularly interact with adult prisoners. 
 
---------------- 
PRISONER WELFARE 
---------------- 
 
5.  (U) Regina Akpan, an NPS official in charge of prisoner 
welfare, told POLOFF she could not provide services for the 
prisoners without the assistance of NGOs and that federal 
funding of the prisons was inconsistent and incapable of 
sustaining even existing programs.  She said NGOs such as 
Prisoners Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA), the 
Civil Liberties Organization, Life Link Organization, and the 
Catholic Secretariat provided numerous programs and services. 
 Family contact facilitation, recreational activities, 
spiritual counseling, legal services and various educational 
and training opportunities are available through these 
groups.  Some of these programs include adult literacy 
classes, health education, hair dressing/braiding classes, 
and tailoring classes.  Computer training is also provided, 
but Akpan said classes have been put on hold as electrical 
spikes from the local power supply, worsened by the lack of 
surge protectors or uninterrupted power supply terminals, 
have damaged their equipment. 
 
----------------------- 
DEFUNCT JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
----------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) There is no little process in the Nigerian criminal 
justice system.  A survey, by the National Human Rights 
Commission in September 2003 of all Nigerian prisons, found 
23,335 awaiting trial within the system, 4,244 of which are 
in Lagos State.  H. D. Kess Momoh, the Controller of Prisons 
for Lagos State, told POLOFF approximately 60% of all inmates 
are detainees awaiting trial. PRAWA, an advocacy NGO that 
also provides training and aid to prisoners, estimates that 
over 80% of detainees are awaiting trial for periods ranging 
from three to sixteen years.  Many have already been 
incarcerated beyond the maximum penalty for the crime of 
which they are accused.  Overcrowding is due to many factors, 
but mainly to the common police practice of arbitrary 
detention.  In the vicinity of a crime, it is not uncommon 
for the police to make mass arrests and identify potential 
suspects from those detained at a later date.  Bribery and 
extortion are often involved, as police officers demand 
bribes to release prisoners, regardless of guilt.  As a 
result, it is the poor who suffer the most from these 
practices. 
 
7.  (U) Irrespective of guilt or innocence, the judiciary 
further slows the process.  Record keeping is poor and 
antiquated.  POLOFF observed prison officials typing records 
on old typewriters, using carbon paper, and haphazardly 
storing their work in a cupboard with 12 cubbyholes.  No 
records were placed in separate folders and no filing system 
could be discerned.  For some prisoners, the GON does not 
know why they are incarcerated, as their case files have been 
lost.  Others have repeatedly gone to court for their initial 
arraignments, only to have their cases continued -- usually 
without explanation.  NPS officials and prisoners alike 
stated the greatest hindrance in the judicial system is the 
lack of transport trucks known as \"black Marias.\"  Two \"black 
Marias\" are used in the Lagos State Prison Command to take 
prisoners to the various Lagos courts.  Each has a capacity 
to hold 15 to 20 persons -- inadequate for the Lagos State 
Prison Command\'s needs.  Many prisoners are, therefore, 
unable to meet court dates, further delaying the judicial 
process. 
 
------------ 
PRISON RIOTS 
------------ 
 
8.  (U) On February 7 prisoners at Ikoyi Prison rioted for 
two days over the death of an HIV positive inmate who died 
after waiting nine years for his case to come to court. 
Mobile police later secured the prison.  During the riots, 
prisoners burned down the medical storeroom.  Prisoners were 
protesting their conditions and the lack of due process in 
the judiciary.  They were not provided basic items such as 
soap, blankets, and mattresses.  Nor were the prisoners 
afforded basic health care.  When the prisoners burnt down 
the storeroom, it reportedly housed these supplies that had 
not been distributed to the population.  A similar riot broke 
out in June 2003 at Kiri Kiri Medium Security Prison, 
resulting in several deaths. 
 
---------------------------- 
THE LONG WAIT OF UNCERTAINTY 
---------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) POLOFF interviewed three prisoners at Kiri Kiri 
Medium Security Prison.  Each was being held on charges of 
suspected robbery.  Ignatius Ani has been awaiting trail for 
11 years and has never appeared in court since his arrest. 
Joseph Ody has never appeared in court and has been in 
custody for 6 years.  Gabriel Onu, held in custody for 4 
years, has been to court nine times within the past year.  He 
has not been arraigned.  His arraignment has been continued 
each time because the individual he was arrested with does 
not have legal representation.  The prisoners said they knew 
of many individuals who have had their arraignments postponed 
18 to 20 times and they railed against the failings of the 
judiciary.  Their greatest complaint was the lack of \"black 
Marias\" and they faulted the government for not providing 
them with their opportunity to be heard in court.  They also 
pointed out poor practices and treatment by the police.  Each 
of the men described their conditions as poor, but believed 
that prison officials were providing them with as many 
resources as they were able. 
 
10.  COMMENT: The three prisoners hold the position of 
\"provost\" within the prison, meaning that they are the bosses 
of their cellblocks.  One of the prisoners was well dressed 
and displayed an expensive watch.  Corruption by prison 
officials has been reported in the press, such as smuggling 
contraband to prisoners and diverting prison funds.  It is 
likely these provosts profit from their good relations with 
prison officials, which may reflect the lack of criticism of 
their keepers.  Despite prison corruption, the glaring 
problem of prison overcrowding remains.  The police and 
judiciary have shown themselves to be ill-equipped, grossly 
inefficient, and derelict in their duties.  The criminal 
justice system is chaotic and in dire need of reform.  END 
COMMENT.

------------------------------ 
Overland Links Inland Airports 
------------------------------ 
 
2. (U) Overland Airways now connects Abuja and Lagos to 
Nigeria\'s less frequented inland airports.  Planes link 
Abuja to the southwestern cities of Ibadan, Ilorin, and 
Akure and ferry passengers between Abuja and Bauchi, a 
northeastern city expected to attract increasing 
numbers of tourists to the nearby Yankari Game Reserve. 
 
3. (U) Overland\'s Managing Director, Captain Edward 
Boyo, says the company is taking a new approach to 
domestic transportation.  The company\'s 18-seat Beech 
1900D aircraft will ultimately link Nigeria\'s four 
corners to Abuja and Lagos in a sophisticated hub and 
spoke system, improving mobility and ease of travel and 
sparing passengers time-consuming inconveniences. 
Already, Ibadan residents no longer have to make the 
two-hour drive to Lagos to catch a flight to Abuja, and 
Ilorin and Akure residents can fly to Abuja without 
transiting Lagos.  Boyo eventually hopes to acquire a 
fourth and fifth plane, achieve nationwide coverage, 
and construct a corporate aircraft maintenance facility 
outside Lagos (reftel). 
 
----------------------------------- 
NEPA Improves Collection Efficiency 
----------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) The Managing Director of Nigeria\'s National 
Electric Power Authority (NEPA), Joseph Makoju, said on 
March 18 that NEPA\'s collection efficiency improved 
from 50 to 75 percent over the last four months, a 
change due in part to the January 1 decentralization of 
the company\'s distribution sections.  NEPA\'s revenue 
collection now averages N5 billion ($37 million) per 
month.  Makoju expects revenues to increase with the 
drive to install pre-payment meters in government 
establishments by the end of 2004 (despite criticism of 
recent installations at the legislative quarters in 
Abuja) and to ensure that all customers are metered by 
2006. 
 
5. (U) Makoju told EconSpec that NEPA plans to 
introduce a multi-year tariff order (MYTO) system to 
review the agency\'s tariffs at least once a year. 
This, he said, \"would provide comfort to investors by 
ensuring that tariffs are indexed to changes in non- 
controllable costs, thereby guaranteeing `real\' returns 
on investments.\"  When asked about the process of 
unbundling NEPA, Makoju said he expected the 
transmission section to become a semi-autonomous unit 
in April 2004, with the generating section unbundled by 
the fourth quarter. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
GON to Revive Liquefied Petroleum Gas Sector 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) The GON recently inaugurated a ten-man committee 
to devise a plan to revive the country\'s liquefied 
petroleum gas (LPG) sector.  The Special Adviser to the 
President on Energy and Petroleum Matters, Edmund 
Daukoru, publicly stated that the need to revive the 
sector is driven by the high cost of imported LPG, or 
cooking gas.  The Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers 
Association of Nigeria (LPGMAN) claims the GON loses 
N2.9 billion ($21 million) annually from the import of 
LPG.  Many LPG marketers claim that the 30 per cent 
import duty, 7 per cent port surcharge, and 5 per cent 
value added tax on imported LPG unduly raise prices and 
object to having to pay duties and taxes when oil 
importers do not.  Nigeria imports LPG largely because 
it cannot convert enough of its natural gas to LPG. 
Domestic supplies of LPG have contracted from 160,000 
tons per year in the late 1980s to some 40,000 tons in 
2002. 
 
7. (U) Nigeria\'s LPG utilization for domestic and 
industrial purposes is relatively low.  The GON seeks 
to bring per capita consumption levels in line with the 
West African average of 3.7 kg per year over the next 
five years.  This, Daukoru says, would represent a 
seven-fold increase and could result in sales worth 
about N47 billion ($348 million) annually.  To 
facilitate the sector\'s growth, the GON plans to 
construct nine strategically located LPG storage depots 
and revamp the country\'s ailing refineries.  The GON\'s 
ten-man steering committee will oversee these efforts 
and coordinate attempts to identify, appraise, and 
implement business development opportunities in the LPG 
sector.  The committee will also promote and monitor 
the implementation of a domestic gas sector blueprint 
and assist in developing an LPG policy and a proper 
regulatory and institutional framework.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: TELECOMMUNICATIONS ROUNDUP 
 
REF: (A) LAGOS 524, (B) 03 LAGOS 2565 
 
1. (U) Summary: Recent conversations suggest the 
Nigerian telecommunications industry is evolving 
rapidly.  Officials at Nigeria\'s Bureau of Public 
Enterprises (BPE) say they hope to take NITEL public in 
June; M-Tel executives say they expect to complete the 
installation of a 1.2 million line mobile network in 
August; and executives at Nigeria\'s largest fixed 
wireless operator, Odua Telecommunications, say they 
hope to complete the construction of a five-state 
network in December.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------- 
NITEL: Plans for a June IPO 
--------------------------- 
 
2. (U) BPE officials say they hope to sell 20 percent 
of the GON\'s shares in Nigeria\'s national operator, 
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), in an 
initial public offering in June.  The company\'s shares 
have not been valued, but the BPE\'s Director of 
Infrastructure and Networks, Irene Chigbue, says she 
expects the opening price to fall between N0.80 and N1 
per share.  If domestic investors snap up the 20 
billion shares on offer as rapidly as some observers 
expect, NITEL may raise as much as $150 million. 
 
3. (U) BPE officials delayed the sale of an initial 
tranche of shares twice before (Ref A), but Chigbue 
believes NITEL is better prepared this time.  The 
company\'s board recently approved a business plan and 
accepted an audit of the 2002 accounts, and BPE 
officials say the board will consider the firm\'s 2003 
results within the next few weeks.  With these, BPE and 
NITEL will be able to move ahead with an initial public 
offering, but only after selecting an issuing house, 
naming the various parties to the issue, winning 
Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission approval, 
and preparing a prospectus. 
 
4. (U) Chigbue added that two foreign firms, one from 
Singapore and the other from China, have expressed 
interest in purchasing the 51 percent controlling 
interest the GON hopes to sell to a core investor.  If 
either firm submits a proposal to the BPE and initiates 
the competitive bidding process and subsequent sale, 
the GON will likely compensate NITEL\'s managers, 
Pentascope International, for the early termination of 
their three-year contract and turn the firm over to new 
parties.  Chigbue says the GON would like nothing 
better than to see NITEL successfully privatized, 
particularly after a botched attempt in 2002.  The 
firm\'s privatization, she says, remains one of the 
GON\'s top priorities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
M-Tel: A Slow Rollout, but a Rollout Nonetheless 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (U) M-Tel executives admit having experienced delays 
rolling out their 1.2 million line mobile network, but 
CEO Aad Loois expects to complete 90 to 95 percent of 
the network within the next three months, with the 
remaining 5 or 10 percent coming online in August. 
Lines are selling rapidly, with total subscriptions 
sometimes doubling in two-week periods.  Loois hopes to 
respond to that demand by beginning the installation of 
several hundred thousand additional lines in the fourth 
quarter. 
 
6. (U) M-Tel awarded $50 million contracts for the 
installation of its mobile network last March.  Each of 
the three contractors, Motorola, Ericsson, and ZT of 
China, were expected to install 400,000 lines within 
four and a half months of the signing of letters of 
credit.  These were signed last August, but 
difficulties clearing equipment through customs delayed 
construction until mid-November.  Motorola\'s Country 
Manager, Raphael Udeogu, expects to complete the 
network\'s rollout in late March or early April, but he 
says only 30 or 40 percent of the network will be used, 
mostly because it lacks sufficient connections to 
NITEL\'s transmission backbone.  Promised repairs and 
extensions never materialized, so like other mobile 
service providers, Motorola has had to fill in the 
gaps.  Udeogu hopes to win a multi-million dollar 
contract to supply much-needed connecting points later 
this year. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Odua: A Powerhouse Enters the Market 
------------------------------------ 
7. (U) Executives at Nigeria\'s leading fixed wireless 
operator, Odua Telecommunications, say they hope to 
complete the construction of a 1.1 million line fixed 
wireless network by the end of the year.  The company\'s 
backbone is more than two-thirds complete, and it 
recently rolled out in two of the five southwestern 
states included in its 3.5GHz license (Ref B).  Odua\'s 
Chief Technical Officer, Olusegun Owolabi, expects to 
introduce services in the remaining three within the 
next few months. 
8. (U) Odua is well ahead of its competitors.  Of the 
twenty-six firms that won 3.5GHz licenses in June 2002, 
only Odua has started operating.  It bills itself as 
customers\' \"sure link\" and emphasizes the reliability 
and affordability of its services.  Calls cost as 
little as N4 ($0.03) per minute, and customers can 
purchase pre-paid calling cards for as little as N200 
($1.48).  Subscribers have responded positively, and 
Owolabi expects to sell lines easily.  Like other 
Nigerian operators, Odua will likely find that demand 
far exceeds supply. 
 
9. (U) Comment: Despite privatization snags, rollout 
delays, and poor basic infrastructure, the Nigerian 
telecommunications sector is evolving rapidly.  It 
continues to attract foreign investment, and it remains 
one of the fastest growing sectors of the Nigerian 
economy.  Given Nigerians\' insatiable demand for 
telecommunications services, the sheer size of the 
market, and operators\' desire to profit, the 
telecommunications sector will likely remain one of the 
economy\'s strongest engines of growth.  The sector\'s 
expansion should create lucrative business 
opportunities, particularly for U.S. firms.  Motorola 
and Harris (Ref B) have already profited, and others 
would do well to follow their lead.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA:  Labor Update 
 
REF: (A) Lagos 462  (B) Lagos 146 
 
 
Banks become the first casualty in labor\'s renewed battle 
over casualization 
 
1.  On March 2, approximately 30 of the 56 Nigerian banks 
accused by the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) of engaging in 
anti-labor practices announced their decision to reduce 
contract labor and allow their employees to unionize (ref 
A).  However, many banks have reluctantly implemented the 
new policy.  A Citibank Manager, for example, told the CG 
that his employees met with the unions in a parking lot at 
night, adding that there was no way the bank would let union 
organizers into the building. 
 
2.  Following the banks\' concession, the Ministry of Labor 
and Productivity, the NLC, and industry representatives 
agreed to develop a house union structure allowing industry 
employees to join the National Union of Banks, Insurance and 
Financial Institutions Employees (NUBIFIE) or the 
Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and 
Financial Institutions Employees (ASSBIFIE).  The process 
began in mid-March and is being monitored by a joint 
committee comprised of representatives from the Ministry of 
Labor and Productivity, the NLC, the Nigerian Employers 
Consultative Forum (NECA), and the Chartered Institute of 
Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN). 
 
3.  The agreement is a victory for the NLC, an organization 
whose leadership is struggling to maintain credibility both 
internally and among the Nigerian public.  Labor leaders 
have indicated that their dispute with banks pertaining to 
the use of contact work is a first step toward a nationwide 
campaign against \"casualization\"; that is, part-time, 
intermittent, or temporary workers. 
 
 
NLC threatens to resume strike over petroleum tax 
 
4.  The NLC has again issued a threat to resume its 
suspended strike if the GON continues allegedly to disobey a 
court order that prohibits it from collecting a 1.50 Naira 
fuel tax (ref B).  The NLC wrote a letter to the Secretary 
of the Federal Government of Nigeria alleging that the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and other 
marketers continue to incorporate the fuel tax in their 
pricing. 
 
5.  In January, the Federal Appeals Court ruled that both 
parties should return to pre-tax prices pending its official 
decision.  The parties were also ordered to work together to 
resolve the dispute.  However, NLC lawyer, Femi Falana, told 
the court during its last hearing, that there has been no 
dialogue between the NLC and the GON.  While the NLC is 
considering a plan to mobilize the public, it will likely 
defer action until after the court returns from recess in 
mid-April. 
 
Dispute over benefits at ExxonMobil leads to a lockout 
 
6.  Bayo Olowoshile, Deputy General Secretary of the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of 
Nigeria (PENGASSAN), met with Laboff on March 8, 2004, to 
request assistance in resolving a three-year old dispute 
regarding staff pensions and other benefits at ExxonMobil. 
Olowoshile explained that the package for ExxonMobil 
downstream employees, as a percentage of total remuneration, 
is not consistent with the package offered to upstream 
employees.  In addition, he said the benefits given to 
downstream employees are as much as thirty percent below 
industry standards.  By early March, the dispute had 
escalated, resulting in a lockout of several employees at 
Mobil Oil Plc.  However, on March 16, ExxonMobil and 
PENGASSAN signed an agreement to reexamine the benefits of 
workers downstream, and the locked-out Mobil employees were 
allowed to return to work.

1. (U) Summary: An informal survey of Lagos commercial

Official guidelines do not exist, and counterfeit notes 
are rarely reported to Central Bank or law enforcement 
officials.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) While some bank representatives claim they 
rarely, if ever, receive counterfeit U.S. currency, 
most of those surveyed say they occasionally see 
counterfeit notes.  In the absence of uniform handling 
procedures, most banks simply perforate and return 
counterfeit currency to customers.  Since only one in a 
handful of dollar notes may be counterfeit, bank 
tellers typically make little fuss, particularly if the 
customer is well known.  Other bank representatives say 
they detain and question customers presenting 
counterfeit currency, and some invite Nigerian law 
enforcement officials to investigate if customers are 
uncooperative or unable to provide satisfactory 
explanations. 
 
3. (U) Currency exchangers say they typically return 
counterfeit currency to customers.  In the past, they 
perforated counterfeit notes before handing them back, 
but since most customers claimed they could easily 
return them to their source, this practice gradually 
stopped.  Groups of currency exchangers operating in 
the informal market have apparently created +ACI-security 
checks+ACI- by marking genuine notes in ways unique to each 
particular group.  Unmarked notes are treated with 
suspicion until they are tested, verified, and marked 
accordingly.  Customers aware of this practice allay 
their fears of receiving counterfeit currency by 
requesting marked notes. 
 
4. (U) None of the commercial bank representatives or 
currency exchangers surveyed had any idea how many 
counterfeit notes might be in circulation.  The 
practice of returning counterfeit currency, they say, 
makes record keeping difficult. 
 
5. (U) Post has distributed recommended guidelines for 
the handling of counterfeit U.S. currency to Central 
Bank officials and commercial bank representatives. 
Additional recommendations may be addressed to Joseph 
Sanusi, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Central 
Business District, Abuja, Federal Capital Territory.

SUBJECT:  OIL  INDUSTRY  CAUTIOUSLY  EMBRACES  NIGERIAN 
LOCAL CONTENT 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY.  The GON requires oil companies to 
use indigenous contractors in joint venture projects, 
with a current target goal for \"local content\" set at 
40 percent of a company\'s aggregate spending on a 
project.  Defining what constitutes local content and 
enforcing the target fairly and efficiently have proven 
difficult, and domestic fabrication and labor 
capacities remain low.  The industry wants to ensure, 
as it undertakes the effort to increase indigenous 
participation in contracts, that the concept of local 
content is based on a contractor\'s ability for domestic 
value-added rather than on the nationality of the 
equity stakeholders alone.  With restrictive 
legislation and higher local content targets on the 
horizon, the next several years offer an excellent 
opportunity for American companies both to participate 
in capacity building of Nigerian domestic firms, and to 
establish manufacturing and service operations in- 
country.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U) The GON encourages foreign companies involved 
in the oil industry to maximize Nigerian participation 
in the projects they undertake. But local content 
targets are not codified and are administered in 
different ways by the Department of Petroleum Resources 
(DPR), the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the 
National Petroleum Investment and Management Services 
agency (NAPIMS). Interest and confusion over targets 
run high, as evidenced during the Offshore West Africa 
Conference held in Abuja March 17-19.  According to 
Paul Heuper, Special Energy Advisor at the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, who was a presenter at the 
conference, the breakout session for local content 
discussion was attended by over 100 people (compared to 
20 at other sessions), and at one point degenerated 
into a free-for-all shouting match between members of 
the audience and a Shell representative leading the 
discussion.  Heuper told ECONOFF that there seemed to 
be no common understanding of what are the current and 
near-term GON goals, and no agreement as to what 
constitutes local content. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
WHAT IS LOCAL CONTENT: OWNERSHIP OR VALUE-ADDED? 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3.   (SBU) Companies doing business in Nigeria\'s 
petroleum sector must obtain various business and 
project permits from DPR. The Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, meanwhile, limits the number of expatriates 
who can enter Nigeria to fill jobs.  The limits on 
expatriate workers vary with the level of expertise 
required and the training or experience Nigerians may 
have to do the anticipated work.  Furthermore, every 
contract worth $500,000 or more entered into by an oil 
company must be reviewed at multiple stages by NAPIMS, 
which insists that 40 percent of the aggregate spending 
on projects in Nigeria be on \"local content.\"  But, 
multinational oil companies and oil services firms 
alike complain that they have little guidance 
specifying what constitutes local content on any given 
project.  In a recent meeting with Maureen Scurry of 
the U.S. Export-Import Bank (USEXIM), Tom Hoffman, 
Chevron Nigeria\'s General Manager for Finance and 
Information Technology, lamented that too often 
businesses that are essentially shell corporations 
owned by at least one Nigerian are used to partner with 
international firms for the purpose of technically 
meeting local content requirements, but the former 
contribute little by way of actual Nigerian input. 
 
4.   (SBU) NAPIMS, for example, may approve a 
refurbishing contract that includes as a subcontractor 
a firm owned by a Nigerian, even if that firm has 
minimal facilities in Nigeria and ultimately ships the 
parts to the United States or elsewhere to be retooled 
and then re-imported.  Hoffman said his company would 
rather not use such firms because they provide no value 
added to a project: they provide no inputs derived from 
Nigeria and may have few Nigerian employees other than 
those who own the company.  According to Hoffman, such 
arrangements are neither cost effective nor 
sustainable.  Phillip Chukwu, Group Managing Director 
of NAPIMS, admitted to ECONOFF on March 16 that in many 
people\'s minds, including Nigerians in both business 
and government, such arrangements are sufficient to 
meet local content requirements.  Chukwu nonetheless 
agreed with Hoffman that the process would be more 
effective if the government established guidelines 
focused on a company\'s domestic value added to a 
project rather than the nationality of its owners. 
 
------------------------------------ 
CHEVRON\'S LOCAL CONTENT VALUE MATRIX 
------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) According to Chevron\'s Hoffman, his company 
uses a value matrix to determine the local content a 
contractor will provide if brought into a project. 
Elements that Chevron evaluates include the number of 
Nigerians the company employs and in what positions, 
the nature of the supply chain that will support the 
project, the extent to which raw materials to be used 
in the supply chain originate in Nigeria, and the 
amount of taxes the contractor pays to the Nigerian 
government.  Gibson Ola, Chevron Nigeria\'s Supply Chain 
Manager, added that the company\'s goals regarding local 
content are to increase the value added in Nigeria and 
to build domestic capacity in the sector, including 
training Nigerians to work in oil services. 
 
---------------------------------- 
NAPIMS PROCESS SLOW AND BURDENSOME 
---------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Chevron\'s Ola described Nigeria\'s local 
content regulatory regime as a work in progress. 
Hoffman said that in the absence of regulation, NAPIMS 
uses its contracting approval process to promote local 
content.  According to Hoffman, projects worth $500,000 
or more must be reviewed and approved by NAPIMS at 
several stages. NAPIMS officials evaluate everything 
from the advertisements a company will run for bid 
solicitation to the details of the contracts and 
subcontracts used at various phases of the project. 
NAPIMS chief Phillip Chukwu described his agency\'s 
relationship with the oil companies as advisory, but 
admitted that a project will not go forward without 
NAPIMS approval at each step. 
 
7. (SBU) The NAPIMS approval process is often 
burdensome, according to officials in oil companies, 
oil services firms, and NAPIMS.  The NAPIMS review is 
cumbersome and slow, to the point that the approval 
process sometimes is longer than the lifespan of the 
intended contract.  By the time approvals are obtained 
in some instances, a new contract must be negotiated 
and maneuvered through NAPIMS all over again.  Hoffman 
said the delays in the NAPIMS process add uncertainty 
and cost to Chevron Nigeria\'s contracts, which in turn 
hamper local content capacity building as project 
managers are less willing to work with unknown or new 
Nigerian firms in order to minimize the risk of further 
delays.  Uncertainty in NAPIMS review frustrates oil 
services companies (OSC) as well.  Ray Blanchard, 
Manager of Cooper Cameron\'s operations in Nigeria, told 
ECONOFF that his company never knows if its bids on 
contracts will satisfy NAPIMS local content rules, even 
though all but a handful of Cameron\'s employees are 
Nigerian including managers, and the company maintains 
relatively large office, workshop, and fabrication 
facilities in the Delta. 
 
8. (SBU) NAPIMS\' Chukwu agreed his agency\'s approval 
process sometimes takes longer than the timeframe of a 
proposed project, and said he is trying to streamline 
the review process.  He said NAPIMS is considering 
reducing the number of departments involved in contract 
approval, and raising the contract threshold for the 
agency\'s review to perhaps one million dollars, which 
Hoffman also suggested would provide welcomed relief. 
 
----------------------------- 
LEGISLATION FOR LOCAL CONTENT 
----------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) A bill submitted in 2003 to codify local 
content rules is scheduled for consideration in the 
National Assembly in late March.  In the meantime, 
NAPIMS plans to increase local content goals from 40% 
of aggregate spending on a project to 45% by 2006 and 
70% by 2010.  Chevron managers told us that the oil 
industry in Nigeria is working as a group through the 
Oil Producers\' Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos 
Chamber of Commerce to shape the bill, but more 
important, the accepted definition of local content. 
Chevron\'s Hoffman said that in addition to pressing the 
view that Nigerian value added is more important than 
equity stake, the industry will press to see that local 
content requirements work to the advantage of firms 
having such capability in bid qualifications. 
According to Hoffman, the industry would like to see 
companies contributing a greater percentage of value 
added local content win contracts even if other 
technical elements, such as longevity or financial 
liquidity, are less developed than competitors offering 
little value added. 
 
--------------------------------- 
INDUSTRY SEES WRITING ON THE WALL 
--------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) When asked why the industry is pursuing what 
appears to be the more restrictive local content 
requirement based on value added, Hoffman admitted that 
the oil companies see the writing on the wall and know 
they need to help shape the legislation if it is to be 
\"done right.\"  Hoffman said there is a risk to using 
shell companies to meet local content goals because 
sometimes such companies have little capacity to 
deliver on contracts, forcing project managers to hire 
additional contractors to do the same work.  These 
delays, along with the delays in NAPIMS approvals, are 
more costly to the foreign oil companies than are 
higher contract costs associated with doing business 
with firms offering more value added, even if the 
latter need assistance in capacity building.  Greater 
local content improves the net project value if it 
reduces project delays, according to Hoffman. 
 
11. (SBU) Hoffman also said that value added local 
content should be more cost effective over time.  He 
and Chevron\'s supply manager Ola said principles of 
corporate responsibility also demand a commitment to 
tangible local content.  They also noted that future 
corporate opportunities, like gas exploration, lie in 
developing economies like Nigeria, and developing local 
content will help access those opportunities. 
 
----------------- 
CAPACITY BUILDING 
----------------- 
 
12. (SBU) Hoffman identified four requirements for 
development of Nigeria\'s local content in the oil 
sector.  First, capacity and capability must be built. 
There are too few indigenous firms in Nigeria that can 
provide the products, fabrication or services needed by 
the international oil companies operating in the 
country.  Hoffman said business management must also be 
improved so that companies like Chevron Nigeria can be 
confident that subcontractors will perform as 
contracted and will be sustainable and grow over time. 
He said financing is a major issue, particularly with 
start-ups.  And finally, Hoffman stressed that 
companies like his must be willing to make mid- to long- 
term business commitments to indigenous firms. 
 
13. (SBU) Hoffman admitted that his company\'s worldwide 
procurement practices appear contradictory to the goals 
outlined above, in that ChevronTexaco, as a 
multinational corporation, pursues a policy of 
\"strategic sourcing.\" ChevronTexaco tries as much as 
possible to do business with suppliers and service 
companies that can provide products and services 
worldwide, rather than to have its regional business 
units enter into multiple contracts for the same item. 
Chevron Nigeria\'s Hoffman said that 90 percent of his 
company\'s overall spending in terms of dollar value and 
employee time goes toward 10 percent of its contracts. 
In other words, Hoffman said, Chevron tends to do 
business with \"the big boys\" and large contracts. 
Nonetheless, ChevronTexaco aims to leverage its 
worldwide strategic sourcing by encouraging its major 
suppliers to look to Nigeria as a place to establish 
manufacturing, fabrication or servicing bases.  In 2003 
Chevron Nigeria brought 14 of its biggest suppliers to 
Nigeria for site visits and discussions centered on 
possible establishment of operations here, a result of 
which would give Chevron reason to continue or expand 
its contracts with these suppliers, all the while 
meeting local content rules of one of its key markets. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
LEVERAGING LOCAL CONTENT FOR U.S. BUSINESSES 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
14. (SBU) CONGEN and USEXIM staff discussed with 
Chevron\'s supply chain team the opportunities for 
American businesses in Nigeria in the context of the 
local content requirements.  ECONOFF also discussed the 
same with NAPIMS Group Managing Director Phillip Chukwu 
and a group of managers from DPR.  It may appear that 
local content rules could thwart U.S. business 
opportunities by limiting access to Nigerian projects. 
But it was acknowledged by both corporate and 
government officials that Nigeria lacks capacity to 
provide significant local content in part because in 
the near to mid-term the GON and domestic firms will 
lack the financial wherewithal to make significant 
investments in domestic capacity. 
 
15. (SBU) COMMENT: Chukwu admits extensive foreign 
investment is needed to sustain and grow the petroleum 
sector, especially Nigeria\'s fledgling gas industry. 
Accordingly, potential exists for American firms to 
take advantage of the development of local content 
standards in Nigeria in several arenas, by providing 
input for local fabrication, facilities and skills 
training for domestic refurbishing businesses, and 
technical partnerships for service contracts.  Broader 
ventures might include establishing a Nigerian presence 
along the lines of Chevron\'s strategic sourcing 
concept. 
 
16. (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED. Maureen Scurry of USEXIM 
noted that USEXIM can help finance American training 
programs in Nigeria.  This seems to be a little known 
or contemplated concept here.  Both corporate and 
government representatives agreed training needs are 
great and will be ongoing in Nigeria; American 
companies may want to take advantage of the opportunity 
to provide such training with USG assistance.  American 
supply and service firms that can manage the ongoing 
challenges of infrastructure, political risk, and 
security in Nigeria may have a unique opportunity in 
the coming years to capitalize on the inevitable march 
resulting in greater local content, all the while 
improving Nigeria\'s domestic capacity, which will 
ultimately improve the country\'s overall economic 
footing and provide opportunities for investment in 
other sectors. END COMMENT.

\"It wasn\'t me...or maybe it was.\" 
 
1. (U) Continuing its losing ways, the Alliance for Democracy 
Party (AD) lost another challenge to the April 2003 elections 
that gave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) five of the six 
southwestern gubernatorial offices AD had held since 1999. 
 
2. (U) Immediately after the elections, the AD had brought 
suit in the Elections Tribunal charging that newly elected 
PDP Ekiti State Governor Peter Ayodele Fayose had presented 
false credentials to the State Independent Election 
Commission, and was thus not qualified to run for or hold the 
office of Governor. (ref B)  The AD claimed that the school 
records and other documents Fayose submitted bore the name 
\"Peter Ayodele Oluwayose\", a resident of Ibadan in Ogun 
State.  Fayose put his father on the stand to testify that 
God had told him (the father) to change the family name to 
Oluwayose or die. After several postponements, the last one 
ordered when fighting broke out in the courtroom between 
supporters of the two parties, the Tribunal threw out the AD 
case saying that AD did not offer sufficient proof that 
Fayose was not also Oluwayose and, thus the true owner of the 
credentials. 
 
3. (U) Two weeks later, the Tribunal issued a decision in the 
AD\'s case against PDP Delta State Governor James Ibori.  The 
AD claimed that Ibori was ineligible because he had been 
convicted in 1995 of theft by fraud of over ten million 
naira.  Based on the testimony of a defense witness who 
claimed that he was the one who had been charged and 
convicted, and not Ibori, the Tribunal decided that someone 
named James Onanefe Ibori had been convicted, but it was not 
proven that this person and Governor James Ibori were one and 
the same.  The day after the decision, the witness clarified 
his testimony saying that he was not convicted instead of 
Ibori -- they were both convicted of the crime of theft by 
fraud on the same day, but in separate trials.  The AD has 
vowed to appeal the Fayose case and the Ibori case is set for 
retrial in April. 
 
OPC now stands for peace 
 
4. (U)  Once proscribed for its violence prone activities and 
labeled as terrorists by President Obasanjo, the pan-Yoruba 
group, Odua Peoples Congress (OPC), may have resolved to 
follow the path of peace.  Gani Adams, leader of one of the 
two factions of OPC, stressed the organization\'s new image 
during his opening remarks at a March 16 OPC-organized 
conference in Lagos calling for no violence in the up-coming 
local government elections. Prominent Nigerians, including 
diplomats, former Ministers, and civil society leaders 
attended the conference.  Owelle Rochas Okorocha, 
Presidential Advisor on Inter-party Affairs, represented the 
Presidency, and Lagos Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu also sent a 
representative. 
 
5. (U) Adams described the conference as the first in a 
program of political education that the OPC hopes will serve 
as a catalyst for \"positive political socialization\" in 
Nigeria.  He said the one-day meeting is part of the OPC\'s 
plan to help find a new and lasting solution to Nigeria\'s 
historical difficulty with maintaining democratic governance 
through \"free and fair elections.\"  Adams, who is also on the 
Presidential Committee on Peace, used the occasion to 
distance his faction from the recent spate of attacks and 
violence he blamed on the other faction led by Dr. Frederick 
Faseun. 
 
6. (U) Comment. The conference highlighted the fact that 
Adams\' faction has been gaining support from the respectable 
side of Nigeria\'s political and civil society establishments. 
 In reaction to the recent spike in attacks on prominent 
persons, some political leaders have even hired members of 
the OPC as bodyguards.  Governor Tinubu and other notables 
attended Adams\' wedding a few months ago.  If the March 27 
local government elections come off relatively peacefully in 
the southwest, it might be a sign that there is a new and 
responsible OPC dedicated to peace and unity in Nigeria. 
End comment. 
 
 
Pa Adesanya takes sick leave 
 
7. (U) Afenifere, the pan-Yoruba socio-political group that 
is designated to mediate between two rival factions of the AD 
(ref A), announced in mid-March that its octogenarian leader, 
\"Pa\" Abraham Adesanya, was leaving his position, temporarily, 
to seek medical treatment abroad.  Chief Reuben Fasoranti, 
according to Afenifere\'s National Publicity Secretary, Dayo 
Adeyeye, is to be the \"Acting Leader\" until Adesanya \"comes 
back and is in a position to function as leader.\" 
Fasoranti\'s political credentials date from the First and 
Second Republics in Nigeria.  He was close to famed Yoruba 
leader, the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo.  He is from Ondo 
State and served as State Commissioner of Finance in the 
early 1980\'s.  Fasoranti is currently the Ondo State leader 
of Afenifere. 
 
8. (U) Comment. The AD split into two factions after losing 
badly in the April 2003 general elections.  Afenifere, one of 
the organizations that helped found the AD, was asked to lend 
Adesanya to mediate so that the Party could present a united 
slate of candidates in the March 27 local government 
elections.  Unfortunately, just as negotiations were to 
begin, Adesanya suffered a major, crippling stroke. 
Reportedly, before he stepped down, Adesanya got the two 
sides to pledge to submit a unified slate.  The appointment 
of Fasoranti, who is not from Lagos and does not have a 
following in either Afenifere or AD, seems to be the best 
move the two groups can make with only a week until the 
elections.  Fasoranti is a \"place holder\" to keep the groups 
stabilized until after the elections and/or Adesanya is able 
to resume his leadership.

REF:  Lagos 00546 
 
1.   (SBU)  Summary:  Within the past 6 months, six LES 
    members and four guards have been fired from ConGen Lagos 
    for visa-related fraud and malfeasance.  Ongoing 
    investigations by the DS Anti-Fraud agent and the RSOs 
    office indicate that there is still more internal fraud to 
    be uncovered.  Post believe the situation to be serious and 
    asks that Department send a TDY AFU agent assist with the 
    current investigations (reftel) and to cover the AFU summer 
    staffing gap.  The Chief of the Consular Section concurs 
    with this request.  End summary 
 
2.   (SBU) Malfeasance in the Consular Section consists of 
    altering case files, documents, electronic records, and 
    issuing improper appointments. The most common internal 
    fraud theme seems to be money for documents, mainly visas 
    and appointment letters. In the past six to eight months, 
    six locally employed staff have been fired.  In addition, 
    four guards from the Local Guard Force (LGF) have been fired 
    for accepting money for visa appointments and two Mobile 
    Police Officers (MOPOL) were asked to be removed from the 
    Consulate detachment due to their involvement in accepting 
    money from visa applicants in line. 
 
3.   (SBU) The DS Anti-Fraud Agent has a number of cases 
    open at any given time, the majority regarding malfeasance 
    in the Consular Section.  Due to the sensitivity of said 
    cases, the Agent must often work alone or ask for RSO 
    assistance.  Most of the investigations are complex, 
    convoluted and have multiple channels.  For example, a 
    former Consulate gardener was instrumental in facilitating 
    the sale of expedited appointments to visa applicants 
    through secondary persons outside the Consulate. 
    Ultimately, the trail always seems to lead back to a locally 
    employed staff person. 
 
4.   (U) ARSO/I is scheduled to depart post in early July 
    and his replacement is not due to arrive until mid-October. 
    Post is concerned that a four-month gap will inundate the 
    AFU successor with many of the same issues that have been 
    resolved.  Post respectfully requests that consideration be 
    given to support a TDY AFU Agent for the reasons outlined 
    above and in reftel.

STATE PLEASE PASS TO FCC, EX-IM, AND OPIC 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECPS, ECON, EINV, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: GLOBACOM: SIX MONTHS ON 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Late February marked the six-month 
anniversary of Globacom\'s introduction of global system 
for mobile communications (GSM) services.  The firm won 
mobile, fixed, and international gateway licenses in 
August 2002 (as Nigeria\'s second national operator) but 
experienced lengthy delays rolling out its mobile 
network.  The firm is now expanding rapidly, and 
company executives say Globacom is on track to become 
Nigeria\'s leading mobile service provider.  Outside 
observers are skeptical.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) Globacom\'s highly anticipated August 29 rollout 
attracted thousands of subscribers.  Scores of people 
signed up in the company\'s first four or five hours of 
operation, and many of those who failed to acquire 
lines in Abuja snatched them up in Lagos a month later. 
Since then, the firm has expanded rapidly, signing up 
600,000 subscribers in its first six months and adding 
another 100,000 in March.  Service is available in 49 
major cities and hundreds of smaller towns and 
villages, and company executives say they connect two 
or three towns every week, far exceeding their target 
of 36 major cities within a year of operation. 
Globacom\'s microwave radio transmission backbone spans 
thousands of kilometers in four of Nigeria\'s six geo- 
political zones, and executives say they plan to expand 
into the northwest and northeast later this year. 
According to one executive, the network is growing 
faster than any other in Africa. 
 
3. (U) Globacom executives say the firm has spent an 
estimated $1.2 billion to construct its mobile and 
fixed networks and build an international gateway to 
connect GSM users to the outside world.  Fixed lines 
run to a handful of corporate customers (mostly members 
of the firm\'s ownership group), and company executives 
expect to begin building the first phase of a 10,000- 
kilometer (6,250-mile) fiber optic backbone in the next 
few weeks.  Once completed, the network will link 
Lagos, Ibadan, Port Harcourt, and Abuja, and as many as 
half a million customers will have access to fixed or 
fixed wireless communications services. 
 
4. (U) Globacom executives say the fiber optic backbone 
will allow for cheaper, more frequent domestic and 
international connections.  The backbone will turn the 
company into a \"carriers\' carrier\" by allowing it to 
transmit calls for other operators and simultaneously 
allow it to distribute SAT-3 bandwidth to local 
Internet service providers.  Globacom executives hope 
to do what Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), 
the country\'s national operator, has not: take 
advantage of the high capacity underwater fiber optic 
cable (the South Atlantic Telecommunications Cable No. 
3/West African Submarine Cable/South Africa Far East 
Cable, or SAT-3) linking Nigeria to the rest of the 
world.  As Nigeria\'s second national operator, 
Globacom\'s access to the cable is guaranteed.  The 
company is not yet connected, but executives say 
logistics and pricing negotiations with NITEL are 
nearly complete. 
 
5. (U) Globacom has cut prices, introduced flexible 
payment plans, and offered regular promotions in an 
aggressive attempt to attract subscribers.  The 
company\'s tariffs beat those of its competitors, and 
customers say they appreciate the choice between pre- 
and post-paid payment plans and per second or per 
minute billing.  Globacom was the first of Nigeria\'s 
GSM providers to offer per second billing, and company 
executives believe the innovation plays a key role in 
attracting customers.  They believe their promotions 
are equally important, pointing out that potential 
subscribers line up in droves to buy N6,000 ($45) pre- 
paid Classic lines.  The rate beats the N6,480 ($49) 
offered by Globacom\'s major competitor, MTN Nigeria 
Communications Limited, and Globacom executives expect 
the trend to continue.  The key to making money, they 
say, is in the amount of time customers spend on air, 
not in the amount of money they spend to subscribe. 
 
6. (U) Globacom executives expect to undercut 
competitors in more ways than one.  They say Globacom 
offers better service, and customer surveys support 
that assertion.  At only 7 percent, Globacom\'s 
estimated call drop rate is significantly lower than 
those of its competitors: 70 percent of calls on MTN\'s 
network are dropped, and more than 40 percent of calls 
on Econet\'s network are dropped.  Globacom executives 
hope to supplement the company\'s basic quality of 
service with a variety of value-added, pay per use 
features such as photo transmission and text to email 
services, something the firm\'s 2.5G network can support 
more easily than competitors\' less sophisticated 2G 
networks.  Several features are already included in 
Globacom\'s Magic Plus package.  Company executives say 
they want to focus on introducing high quality, high 
technology services, something they see as a 
particularly effective means of attracting and 
retaining customers. 
 
7. (U) Comment: Globacom executives expect to match 
their competitors\' transmission capacity relatively 
quickly.  The firm is expanding at an ever-increasing 
pace, and executives say they are on track to install 4 
million lines by the end of 2005.  If they do so, they 
will certainly make a name for themselves.  The firm\'s 
biggest competitors, MTN and Econet, have just over 2 
million and 1 million subscribers, respectively, and 
both have been plagued by over-subscription problems 
and customer complaints.  Their inability to match 
Globacom\'s tariffs will likely lead to losses of market 
share, and if they lose existing customers while 
recruiting relatively fewer subscribers, they may well 
give up their dominance of the Nigerian mobile services 
sector. 
 
8. (U) Comment continued: Not everyone believes that 
Globacom will have quite the success its executives 
expect.  Its GSM network rollout was delayed for 
months, and like other firms, it has had to spend more 
than it expected to build its transmission backbone, 
supply the infrastructure that NITEL does not provide, 
and put generators and diesel storage tanks at 
individual cell sites and switching centers.  Industry 
observers say the company has had trouble securing 
financing, and many doubt that it will be able to 
continue expanding at such a rapid pace.  Insiders say 
the firm is also troubled by a heavy-handed management 
approach and a lack of direction.  Chief Executive Mike 
Adenuga has a reputation for micromanaging, stifling 
ingenuity and innovation, and dismissing employees for 
questioning company doctrine.  Globacom employees have 
expressed dissatisfaction with company management, and 
outside observers publicly wonder if the firm will be 
able to meet the requirements of its three licenses 
quickly enough to satisfy the average consumer.  Given 
Globacom\'s internal weaknesses, meeting the Nigerian 
public\'s expectations of improved services and lower 
prices may be difficult.  If it does succeed in meeting 
those expectations, however belatedly, Nigerian 
consumers and the broader Nigerian economy will reap 
rewards.  End comment.

     (B) LAGOS 309 
 
1. (U) In response to questions raised in the above- 
referenced email, Post is pleased to provide the 
following information: 
 
2. (U) Designated Abuja and Lagos EconOffs have primary 
responsibility for trade agreement monitoring and 
compliance.  The Mission\'s commercial counselor and 
agricultural attach are closely involved, especially 
in Mission-sponsored public awareness campaigns.  With 
State support, the agricultural attach generally takes 
the lead on issues affecting trade in agricultural 
goods. 
 
3. (U) The Mission\'s Trade Compliance Committee 
e 
coordinates inter-agency trade agreement monitoring and 
compliance efforts.  The committee meets quarterly to 
review GON trade policies and recommend action to 
policymakers in various Washington offices.  The 
committee comprises the deputy chief of Mission, the 
economic counselor, Abuja and Lagos EconOffs for trade, 
the commercial counselor, the agricultural attach, and 
USAID representatives. 
 
4. (U) State recently took the lead in coordinating the 
Mission\'s response to the GON\'s January 2004 
announcement of bans on more than 40 products.  The 
Lagos EconOff for trade collected data on the list of 
banned items, narrowed it to those of particular 
interest to U.S. businesses and economic sectors, and 
coordinated the first quarter\'s Trade Compliance 
Committee meeting, the findings of which were 
transmitted on February 10 (ref B).  The Departments of 
State, Commerce, and Agriculture, through their 
respective officials at Post, have jointly planned an 
awareness campaign to educate the Nigerian public about 
the disadvantages of bans and have recommended that the 
USG focus on specific issues in high-level meetings 
with the GON later this year.  In general, State leads 
the Mission\'s efforts to respond appropriately to the 
GON\'s increasingly protectionist trade policies. 
 
5. (U) Comment: Nigeria\'s trade policies tend to change 
suddenly and arbitrarily.  Decisions regarding tariffs 
and import bans are made at several levels of 
government, including the presidency.  A lack of timely 
published official rulings makes monitoring difficult, 
and enforcement of official policy is rarely 
consistent.  State EconOffs in Abuja and Lagos track 
Nigeria\'s ever-changing trade policy landscape by using 
contacts in a variety of govenment and private sector 
offices to obtain information quickly, put it in a 
business context, and forward it to interested parties. 
While the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture have 
great expertise in their fields, State EconOffs 
understand the broad implications of trade policy 
decisions and provide the USG with in-depth 
understanding of trends.  No other agency on the ground 
can provide that service.  End comment.

PRODUCTION 
 
REF: LAGOS 499 
 
Classified By: Joseph Gregoire for reasons 1.5 (b)(d) and (e). 
 
1. (C) ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco and Shell have received 
instructions from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC) to anticipate reductions in their April production 
quotas in response to an anticipated OPEC decision to reduce 
production worldwide.  Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria\'s presidential 
advisor on oil matters, announced February 24 that Nigeria 
would reduce its oil output by 150,000 barrels per day to 
comply with an OPEC agreement on production cuts. (reftel). 
 
2. (C) Mary Feeley, ExxonMobil\'s General Manager for 
Exploration, told ECONOFF on March 15 that ExxonMobil 
received notice from NNPC that it should expect a reduction 
in its April allocation of Nigeria\'s OPEC quota.  Feeley said 
she is not certain how NNPC determines each company\'s 
allocation, noting that decisions regarding the quota are 
made \"in a black box,\" and the companies are simply told what 
they can expect to lift each month. The following day, Kevin 
Kassner, a senior advisor on Chevron Nigeria\'s Executive 
Staff, added that the company had also been notified that its 
April allocation will be reduced.  In a meeting with ECONOFF 
and Paul Hueper of the U.S. Department of Commerce on March 
22, O.J. Agbarah, Shell\'s Area Production Manager based in 
Warri, said Shell is expecting to reduce itsApril production 
in the area from 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) to between 
350,000 to 380,000 bpd. 
 
3. (C) ExxonMobil\'s Feeley and Chevron\'s Kassner both noted 
that such a notice from NNPC is never the final word. 
According to them, the companies are always 
prepared for \"swing production,\" when NNPC requests more 
liftings mid-month that drive output higher than the 
pre-stated monthly allocation. 
 
4. (C) COMMENT: The GON seems prepared to comply with a 
reduction in crude output if OPEC continues that tack at its 
March 31 meeting.  In so doing, Nigeria would be trying to 
leverage its position that it deserves a quota increase. 
Daukora recently stated publicly that he is hopeful Nigeria\'s 
quota will be raised from 8.2 percent to 10 percent of OPEC\'s 
total production.  NNPC Group Managing Director Funsho 
Kupolokun also said he hopes for a higher quota, noting that 
the recent commissioning of Total\'s Anemnam/Kpono oil field 
raises Nigeria\'s production capacity to 2.8 million bpd, 
almost 800,000 bpd over the country\'s quota.  The GON\'s 
cooperative stance may be a hedge: if the OPEC meeting does 
not end in an agreement on reduced output or if it appears 
other members will not comply with such an agreement, NNPC 
may use swing production to maintain the country\'s current 
high output.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA - SAO TOME JDZ: EXXONMOBIL BIDS BLOCK 1 
 
REF: LAGOS 82 
 
Classified By: J. GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B) (D) AND (E) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: ExxonMobil has exercised only one of its 
preferential bids for crude oil exploration and development 
in the Nigeria - Sao Tome and Principe Joint Development Zone 
(JDZ).  ExxonMobil matched ChevronTexaco\'s bid on Block 1, 
leaving the Joint Development Authority to determine the 
final number of stakeholders for what is considered the JDZ\'s 
most valuable block and which company will become the 
operator. Chrome Energy is in the process of exercising its 
preferential bids. Meanwhile, an ExxonMobil official 
cautioned that the Government of Sao Tome may not be prepared 
to deal with the complexities of modern oil development.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
EXXONMOBIL\'S PREFERENTIAL BID FOR BLOCK 1 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) On or about February 20, 2004, ExxonMobil exercised 
its preferential bid for crude oil exploration and 
development rights in the Nigeria - Sao Tome and Principe 
Joint Development Zone (reftel).  ExxonMobil and Chrome 
Energy were allowed preferential bids based on exploration 
work the companies had done under separate agreements with 
the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (DRSTP) 
before it entered into a joint development treaty with 
Nigeria in 2001. The Joint Development Authority (JDA) 
administering and regulating the zone ended a licensing round 
in October 2003 for nine blocks within the JDZ, by which time 
20 companies had submitted bids for eight of the blocks.  The 
bids included signature bonuses due when awards are 
announced.  ExxonMobil was then allowed to exercise its 
preferential right, and Chrome will follow suit. ExxonMobil 
was given a preferential right to shares in any three blocks 
within the JDZ equaling no more than 40 percent, 25 percent, 
and 25 percent of the equity, respectively. The company had 
to match the highest bonus offered in the licensing round for 
the blocks it sought, but the percentage it will pay of the 
associated bonus will equal its share of a block. 
 
3. (C) Mary Feeley, ExxonMobil\'s General Manager for 
Exploration, confirmed to ECONOFF on March 11 that the 
company had matched ChevronTexaco\'s signature bonus of $123 
million for Block 1.  Feeley also said that ExxonMobil did 
not exercise its right to bid on two additional blocks.  She 
suggested that ExxonMobil chose to focus its resources and 
efforts on Block 1, considered the most valuable of this 
licensing round, because of the number of surprisingly high 
bids submitted  and the relative uncertainty regarding actual 
deposits and potential development and production costs in 
the JDZ. 
 
----------------- 
WHO WILL JOIN IT? 
----------------- 
 
4. (C) Feeley said the JDA will soon consider the other bids 
for Block 1.  ChevronTexaco\'s $123 million bid should have 
placed it in a position to take a majority share in the block 
and thus become operator.  But a surprisingly high bid of 
over $100 million by Nigeria\'s Consolidated Oil (Conoil) may 
cause the JDA to divide the remaining stake in Block 1 
between the two companies, in effect making ExxonMobil the 
majority stakeholder and operator if it is granted 40 percent 
equity.  Conoil\'s financial capability is suspect, according 
to Feeley; she had heard, however, that Conoil has partnered 
with Norway\'s Statoil on the bid, which may ease JDA fears of 
Conoil\'s ability to participate effectively in development of 
the block.  Feeley said ExxonMobil is not concerned about it 
or Chevron acting as operator.  She said either company will 
lead the project effectively and the two companies will work 
well together via operating and technical committees formed 
to administer joint projects. 
 
-------------------- 
AMATEURS IN SAO TOME 
-------------------- 
 
5. (C) When asked how well the Government of Sao Tome and 
Principe is handling its entry into the world of oil 
producing states, Feeley cautiously opined that many people 
in the DRSTP involved in the JDZ and domestic oil sector are 
amateurish in their approach and expectations.  For example, 
some government officials still cling to expectations of 
rapid wealth accumulation by the DRSTP once the JDZ bids are 
finalized.  She said this expectation persists regardless of 
how often and carefully she and other corporate 
representatives explain that, under the production sharing 
contracts (PSC) that will govern the licenses, the 
Governments of Nigeria and the DRSTP will not receive revenue 
from oil production until five to ten years after first-oil. 
 
6. (U) Under a PSC, a private oil company bears the total 
cost of developing a project, such as drilling wells, 
installing well heads, building piping and platforms, and in 
the case of deep offshore projects, bringing in floating 
production, storage and offloading vessels (FPSO).  Once 
production begins and oil is pumped and sold, the company 
shares revenue from crude production with a government entity 
only after the company has recouped its development costs. 
After the initial period of producing \"cost oil\" from which 
the company keeps all revenue (but on which it pays taxes), 
the company and the government split the revenue from the 
production of \"profit oil.\"  Usually the profit oil ratio is 
very favorable to the company in the early stages of 
production, but the ratio inverts steeply over time as 
production markers are reached. 
 
7. (C) For example, Feeley disclosed that ExxonMobil 
negotiated an initial 80/20 split of profit oil with the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in 1993 for 
the Erha offshore project in Block 209, with ExxonMobil 
receiving 80 percent.  That ratio will shift to 70/30 after 
production reaches 350 million barrels.  As production 
increases, the ratio will shift further to the advantage of 
NNPC increasingly fast. 
 
8. (C) Feeley said the typical cost of developing a deepwater 
project at 2,000 to 3,000 meters, the water depth of portions 
of the JDZ (the water depth of Block 1 is approximately 1500 
meters), is two to three billion dollars.  She estimated that 
the JDA and the two constituent countries will not see 
revenue from the JDZ, other than the initial bonus payment 
and ongoing taxes, for a period of five to ten years after 
first-oil is marketed. 
 
------------------------------- 
JUST WHO ARE THE OTHER PLAYERS? 
------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) Feeley also reiterated a concern voiced by other 
companies involved in the JDZ licensing round, including the 
JDA (reftel), that the qualifications and credibility of the 
bidders other than the international oil companies (IOC) are 
questionable, and their intent to develop the blocs as soon 
as possible is suspect.  Following ExxonMobil\'s preferential 
bid, the JDA will give Chrome Energy its opportunity to 
exercise preferential bids on six blocs, for shares of 15 to 
30 percent.  After Chrome\'s bids are submitted, the JDA will 
assess all bids in this round and award contracts in all 
blocks.

1. (S N/F) SUMMARY. The head of Nigeria\'s leading indigenous 
petroleum marketing firm and son of a former Lagos State 
governor told ECONOFF that in a private conversation with 
President Obasanjo and NNPC chief Funsho Kupolokun last 
weekend, Obasanjo confirmed rumors that the GON uncovered a 
coup plot by junior officers (reftels).  Femi Otedola, sole 
owner of Zenon Petroleum, said he was told that the GON found 
a speech prepared by the leader of the coup plot, and that 
the GON discovered $25,000 had been deposited in an account 
in Cote d\'Ivoire to be used to buy weapons for a coup 
attempt.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (S N/F) On April 6, Femi Otedola, President and CEO of 
Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd., met with ECONOFF and ECONSPEC 
(a Nigerian Locally Employed Staff) to discuss his company\'s 
fuel marketing operations and the state of the downstream 
petroleum sector generally.  According to Otedola, Zenon 
controls 85 percent of the Nigerian diesel market, and the 
company is rapidly expanding to control a greater share of 
its vertical business stream from the refinery to the retail 
pump (septel).  Otedola is the son of Chief Michael Otedola, 
who was elected governor of Lagos State in 1992 as a result 
of bitter party infighting but was replaced with a military 
governor when Sani Abacha came to power in 1993.  Femi 
Otedola was put on the Board of the Nigerian Investment 
Promotion Commission (NIPC) earlier this year. 
 
3. (S N/F) During a long and frank conversation about his 
business and Nigeria\'s ongoing fuel woes, Otedola made 
several references to private conversations he has had with 
President Obasanjo, including discussions on getting the 
government out of the fuel business and on privatizing 
Nigeria\'s refineries.  Otedola said President Obasanjo 
recently asked him if Zenon would build a refinery in Lagos 
near the Atlas Cove fuel jetty if the government gave the 
company the land.  Otedola told ECONOFF that such a project 
would cost a half-billion dollars, which he was not 
interested in investing in such a manner at this time.  When 
pressed for reasons why, he said the political risk is still 
too great in Nigeria.  Otedola said he is concerned that the 
split between Obasanjo and Vice President Atiku is large and 
growing. 
 
4. (S N/F) Otedola then pointed to the recent reports of a 
coup plot as further evidence of the high level of political 
risk keeping him from making large capital investments in 
Nigeria that would require him to take on significant debt. 
He noted he keeps Zenon profits in several large Nigerian 
banks from which he can transfer funds to European accounts 
within 24 hours if he senses grave problems in Nigeria.  He 
said that the government\'s public attempt to play down the 
coup plot story was a ruse (ref A). 
 
5. (S N/F) Otedola intimated he met with Obasanjo and Funsho 
Kupolokun, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), on Sunday April 4, and 
was told details about the coup plot. He was not willing to 
share many details, but Otedola said he was told that the GON 
found a speech regarding the coup on the computer of the lead 
plotter.  He also said the GON discovered $25,000 deposited 
in a bank account in Cote d\'Ivoire for the purchase of 
weapons to be used in the coup attempt.  When asked if the 
coup plotters were generals at the top of the military 
command, Otedola said emphatically that junior officers 
hatched the plot (ref B).  He added that current senior 
officers would not plot against Obasanjo, but if they did, 
they could accomplish a coup relatively easily. 
 
6. (S N/F) Otedola noted that he would be meeting with 
Kupolokun in Lagos on Friday, April 9, and would probably 
speak with the President again before leaving Nigeria for 
London sometime in the next 10 days.  Otedola said he keeps 
his family in London and maintains commercial and residential 
real estate holdings there.

SUBJECT: SCANDAL BREWING OVER NIGERIAN FUEL IMPORTS 
 
 
Classified By: J. GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.5 (B), (D), AND (E). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. A scandal is brewing in Nigeria over prices 
paid by the government for imported fuel. International fuel 
traders have been falsifying the dates of bills of lading to 
reflect particularly high market prices, overcharging the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by $300 
million or more. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C N/F) On April 2, Chris Finlayson, Chairman and Managing 
Director of Shell Petroleum Development Corporation of 
Nigeria (SPDC), told Consul General and Econoff that a 
scandal is brewing within the NNPC over payments made to 
international fuel marketers.  Finlayson said some marketers 
have been changing the dates when fuel shipments bound for 
Nigeria were loaded in order to take advantage of 
particularly high market prices.  He said the total 
overpayment by NNPC may be as high as $330 million. 
Finlayson noted that Shell is not one of the marketers in 
question, but is becoming a leading fuel supplier for NNPC. 
 
3. (C N/F) On April 6, Femi Otedola, President and CEO of 
Zenon Petroleum and Gas, the largest supplier of diesel fuel 
in Nigeria, essentially corroborated Finlayson\'s report. 
Otedola said over $300 million has been overpaid by NNPC for 
fuel imports, and that many leading international traders are 
involved.  According to Otedola, NNPC contracts to pay its 
suppliers the market price on the day a ship is loaded with 
fuel.  He said NNPC recently discovered, however, that bills 
of lading were altered to reflect loading on days of high 
market prices.  Discrepancies were found when comparing dates 
on the bills of lading with dates of landing in Lagos. 
 
4. (C N/F) Pointing to examples, Otedola said that while a 
tanker loading fuel at a refinery in Bahrain usually takes 
four weeks to arrive in Lagos, comparisons between the bills 
of lading and dates of arrival of some shipments reflected 
only a four-day difference, and in other cases, if taken at 
face value, indicated the journey took nine months.  Otedola 
said 73 shipments from refineries in the Persian Gulf, 
England, and Venezuela listed delivery times of only one day. 
 NNPC is attempting to get compensation for the over-charge. 
Otedola went on that most of the fuel traders supplying 
Nigeria are implicated in over-charging NNPC, and showed a 
list of 17 companies that supplied fuel in the first quarter 
of 2004, several of which, he said, are significant players 
in international markets, such as Trafigura and Vitol. 
Otedola added that three companies clearly not involved in 
the scandal are British Petroleum, ChevronTexaco and Shell. 
 
5. (C N/F) Otedola recommended that NNPC stop contracting 
with international fuel traders and negotiate purchases 
directly from refineries worldwide.  According to him, such a 
move would have two positive effects.  Otedola calculates 
that NNPC would save some four billion dollars a year in 
expenditures on imported fuel.  (Note: Prior to deregulation 
in October 2003, NNPC, then the sole importer of fuel, lost 
two billion dollars per year because it sold stock to 
retailers below purchase price. After October 2003, NNPC 
initially stopped subsidizing fuel sales, letting marketers 
import fuel to be sold at market prices.  However, sources 
agree that NNPC is back in the business of subsidizing 
gasoline sales while it maintains a facade of deregulation by 
encouraging private marketers to import fuel that NNPC 
purchases at market price.  NNPC then sells the fuel to 
marketers and retailers at a reduced price to ensure that 
those companies maintain a profit margin while holding 
consumer prices to informal caps set by the Department of 
Petroleum Resources. End Note.) 
 
6. (C N/F) Otedola added that by cutting out the 
international traders, NNPC would also enhance the 
environment in which Nigeria\'s refineries could be restored 
and operated.  Otedola said he believes international fuel 
trade \"mafias\" are behind the failure to bring Nigeria\'s 
refineries back on-line and to capacity.  Otedola is 
convinced these traders arrange for the vandalization of 
crude oil feeder pipelines, which keep the refineries at Port 
Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna closed or under-capacity.  He said 
the international traders generally receive at least one 
million dollars per shipload of fuel to Nigeria and have 
grown accustomed to the easy money Nigeria offers as long its 
refineries remain down. 
 
7. (C N/F) As an example, Otedola described an arrangement 
the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) had with Sahara 
Energy for the provision of diesel to an emergency power 
generation plant in Abuja.  He said that while a pipeline was 
under construction to deliver fuel to the main power plant, 
NEPA paid some five billion dollars to Sahara over four years 
for diesel to the back-up plant.  It was later discovered 
that NEPA had received only about one billion dollars worth 
of fuel, according to Otedola.  Otedola said that he, too, 
was contracted to deliver diesel fuel to the plant on 
occasion; however, he petitioned the president to investigate 
the matter after becoming suspicious of NEPA\'s ongoing 
contract with Sahara and the fact that the pipeline for the 
power plant was never finished.  He said his intervention led 
to an investigation that ultimately resulted in the 
cancellation of NEPA\'s contract with Sahara. 
 
8. (C N/F) COMMENT:  The allegation that international 
traders bilked NNPC of hundreds of millions of dollars is yet 
another example of the poor management of Nigeria\'s energy 
sector, and highlights the complex links between crude sales, 
fuel importation, refinery maintenance, and energy production 
here.  Otedola is probably right in suggesting that 
long-standing sweetheart deals between the NNPC and a variety 
of fuel traders is keeping the system inefficient.  That may 
also explain why the GON just can\'t seem to get its 
refineries running even after spending a billion dollars or 
more on maintenance contracts over the last four years. 
Otedola said he initially bid to purchase the Port Harcourt 
refinery offered for privatization, but he recently told 
President Obasanjo he will not invest in the refinery so long 
as NNPC purchases fuel from traders instead of negotiating 
directly with refineries in other countries and leasing ships 
itself to deliver fuel to Nigeria.  It is not clear if 
Otedola\'s assumption that the international traders\' stake in 
Nigeria\'s current fuel market is the main driver behind the 
country\'s refinery woes.  But it is clear that the 
fundamentals of infrastructure security, interim supply 
stability, and transactional transparency must still be 
addressed if the GON is to be taken seriously about its 
efforts to deregulate and largely privatize Nigeria\'s 
downstream petroleum sector.  END COMMENT.

     C. ABUJA NI 760 
 
Classified By: ROBYN HINSON-JONES FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (D) AND (E) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: We have no reports of military action over 
the weekend in the Niger Delta swamps as residents and oil 
companies anticipate a GON response to an attack on Friday, 
April 23 that left seven dead, including two AmCits and three 
Nigerian Navy security personnel (reftels). Press reports 
over the weekend clarified that U.S. armed forces are not 
being deployed to the region.  Meanwhile, oil operations 
appear normal in the Delta.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) We have no reports of significant military action over 
the weekend in response to the attack on a 
ChevronTexaco-contracted utility boat April 23 off the Benin 
River in the troubled Niger Delta.  Seven of nine occupants 
of the boat were killed by gunfire, including two AmCit 
contractors, three Nigerian Navy personnel onboard for 
security, and two Nigerian contractors operating the vessel. 
A fourth Navy personnel escaped unharmed, and a third AmCit, 
an employee of ChevronTexaco, was shot but survived.  A GON 
security official was injured during the subsequent rescue of 
the attack\'s survivors. 
 
3. (C) Reports from a variety of sources last week indicated 
the military was readying itself for operations against 
villages in the area in an effort to capture the killers, 
deter future incidents of this nature, and restore oil 
company confidence that the region is safe to work in.  There 
were conflicting reports whether the military was targeting 
Itsekiri or Ijaw villages, and whether it was focusing on an 
area along the Benin River near the location of the 
shootings, or on villages near the Escravos facility.  It 
appears high-level military personnel toured the Delta both 
for reconnaissance and as a means to boost troop morale. 
Press reports last week indicated that President Obasanjo 
ordered Rear Admiral Antonio Bob-Manuel, the Flag Officer 
Commanding (FOC) of the Western Naval Command based in Lagos, 
to travel to Warri and oversee operations from there for at 
least one week. 
 
4. (C) On Saturday, May 1, a Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) 
security manager stationed at the Escravos crude oil terminal 
and tank farm reported observing no military action to date. 
He said, \"we are not seeing and not anticipating any major 
operations against Ijaw/Itsekiri villages in our area or 
along the Benin River at the moment.\"  He did note that 
several senior Navy officials visited the facility on Friday, 
April 30, and that he anticipated military action of some 
kind in the future, but he suggested no time frame.  He 
offered no news of military movement in a separate 
communication on Sunday, May 2. 
 
5. (C) The CNL security manager described the Delta region as 
\"understandably quiet,\" and said Chevron continues to fly 
personnel and equipment to offshore locations and across the 
swamps. He said pilots have been tasked to report any 
observed activity by community militants or by government 
security forces (GSF).  He also said CNL continues to use 
boats to supply the GSF security teams in place at major 
facilities.  (Note: Oil companies in the Delta provide food, 
water, shelter and sometimes transport for military and 
police forces assigned to protect oil installations.  End 
Note.)  We have seen no change in Shell\'s posture since last 
week, when Managing Director Chris Finlayson told Consul 
General that Shell operations were largely unaffected by the 
April 23 attack, other than some heightened security. 
 
6. (U) Over the weekend, Nigerian newspapers reported that 
the United States was not sending troops to the Delta in 
response to the attack.  These stories clarified news stories 
from last week that claimed teams of investigators were being 
sent by the State Department to investigate the attack, and 
that the Joint Task Force (JTF) commander in Warri welcomed 
U.S. troops to the Delta to assist in ferreting out the 
culprits and securing the region.

Classified By: Consul General Robyn Hinson-Jones for reasons 1.4 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The Nigerian Police Force (NPF) arrested 
and later released Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka and six other 
human rights activists on May 15 during a rally held in Lagos 
opposing President Olusegun Obasanjo\'s administration and its 
policies.  Soyinka later met with the CG and POLOFF on May 19 
and gave his account of the rally, the mission of his new 
organization Citizens Forum (CF), and his assessment of 
Obasanjo.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
LAGOS RALLY, A BUILDUP FOR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Hundreds of protestors assembled at Campos Square, 
Lagos Island on May 15 in anticipation of Soyinka\'s arrival. 
With equal anticipation police, already present at the scene, 
destroyed the speaker\'s podium and dispersed the protestors 
with tear gas in advance.  The protestors later regrouped and 
were soon joined by Soyinka and other prominent human rights 
activists including Gani Fawehinmi, Beko Ransome-Kuti, and 
Femi Falana.  Soyinka told us that police again fired tear 
gas into the crowds and then arrested seven rally organizers, 
including Soyinka, by \"bundling us into a meat wagon.\"  En 
route to NPF Lagos headquarters, the truck was diverted and 
Soyinka told us he meet with two police officials he knew who 
apologized for the arrest.  He then received a call from NPF 
Inspector General Tafa Balogun who expressed the same 
sentiments and explained that he never gave orders to arrest 
anyone, but to only break up the rally.  Within an hour, 
Soyinka and his colleagues were released without charge. 
 
3.  (C) The NPF has publicly denied arresting Soyinka, 
claiming he was merely detained.  The press and the 
opposition Alliance for Democracy (AD) party have 
hypothesized that Soyinka\'s arrest was the work of an 
overzealous and newly appointed Lagos Commissioner of Police 
who wants to score points with Obasanjo by keeping protestors 
in check and exhibiting independence from Lagos Governor Bola 
Tinubu, who is the AD\'s most prominent politician.  Soyinka 
told us that both explanations were \"rubbish.\"  He surmised 
that Obasanjo directed the disruption of the rally and his 
arrest.  The President, Soyinka opined, feels embolden by his 
recent successful break up of former President and recent All 
Nigeria People\'s Party (ANPP) presidential candidate 
Mohammadu Buhari\'s most recent rally (ref A).  \"Besides, 
Obasanjo cannot show preference to another Yoruba man,\" 
Soyinka jested.  Soyinka told us he would continue his 
efforts to point out the failings of the government. 
 
--------------------------- 
CITIZENS FORUM\'S GAME PLANS 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Citizens Forum (CF), a newly created civil rights 
organization founded by Soyinka and others is a coalition of 
human rights groups and civic organizations.  CF advocates 
the creation of a Sovereign National Conference (SNC) to 
reverse unconstitutional enactments by Obasanjo and formulate 
a new constitution.  On these two issues CF coalition members 
are in agreement.  They differ, however, on whether Obasanjo 
and other politicians should resign from office and a 
National Unity Government be created.  Soyinka has been 
erroneously quoted in the press as calling for Obasanjo\'s 
resignation.  On May 19, Soyinka held another press 
conference to clarify his position.  \"I would like to see 
those largely fraudulent arms of governance vanish, and I may 
yet join in the call for their suicide.  The fact, however, 
is that I have not yet done so.  My tactical priorities for 
now are stemming the nation\'s drift towards fascism and 
convening a Sovereign National Conference.\" 
 
5.  (C) Soyinka detailed to us his vision for the SNC.  He is 
calling for 500 participants representing human rights 
groups, the military, the NPF, politicians, religious groups, 
tribal leaders, concerned professionals, and scholars who 
would meet over a six month period.  The SNC would be tasked 
with creating a new constitution, replacing the Independent 
National Electoral Commission (INEC), and addressing national 
issues such as ethno-religious violence, corruption, and the 
nature of Nigerian democracy.  When pressed how he would get 
sitting politicians to buy into a forum that could jeopardize 
their legitimacy, Soyinka said there were two schools of 
thoughts on the issue.  There are some who advocate that 
decisions are binding with immediate effect, creating a 
National Unity Government and beginning a new election cycle. 
 However, Soyinka advocated a binding decision that would be 
implemented with the next scheduled national elections of 
2007.  Soyinka reasoned that politicians would not feel their 
existing tenures threatened and those who will not have 
reached their term limits could run on the platform of 
implementing social change that they helped create.  He 
stated that Obasanjo has been receptive to the idea in 
private meetings when tensions are high, but then dismisses 
it when situations cool. 
 
-------------------------------- 
OBASANJO, PLACATER OF THE NORTH? 
-------------------------------- 
6.  (C) Soyinka showed disdain for many of Obasanjo\'s 
policies, which he described as unilateral and dictatorial, 
rising to a \"level of intolerance reaching academic 
proportions.\"  The recent announcement of a state of 
emergency in Plateau State over unabated ethno-religious 
violence in May (ref B) was of deepening concern to Soyinka. 
He was disturbed with Obasanjo\'s coup of suspending the 
governor, deputy governor, and state assembly and replacing 
them with a former military governor of Plateau State after 
Obasanjo\'s attempts to force the state house of assembly to 
impeach the governor failed.  Soyinka attributed the decision 
to Obasanjo\'s political precariousness in light of increasing 
national instability and his habitual placation to northern 
sentiments, which Soyinka claims dates to Obasanjo\'s career 
in the military. 
 
7.  (C) Kano and Delta States, Soyinka argues, should have 
had states of emergency enacted several times under 
Obasanjo\'s rubric for justifying that of Plateau.  Soyinka 
pointed out the recent Kano riots (ref C) and its history of 
being a manipulated flashpoint of religious violence as a 
more probable justification for a suspension of the state 
government, but believes this has been purposely ignored by 
Obasanjo.  Soyinka thinks Obasanjo may use the threat of a 
state of emergency to keep erring governors in check or in an 
attempt to wrest power from the AD in Lagos, which Soyinka 
described as an insolent state that the president\'s party has 
been enviously eyeing. 
 
8.  (C) COMMENT: Soyinka made it clear to us that he is ready 
to return to the national arena of civil disobedience and be 
active in producing social change in Nigeria.  He currently 
is setting up a literary institute at the University of 
Nevada - Las Vegas, but intimated that it was not too 
demanding on his time.  He has since returned to the United 
States and is making arrangements to be permanently based in 
Lagos, commuting to Nevada when needed.  As instability and 
public dissatisfaction increases, the message of Soyinka and 
his colleagues and their continued efforts to demonstrate 
against the Obasanjo administration will keep this Nobel 
Laureate in the news for sometime to come.  END COMMENT.

Econet and Vodacom Sign Five-Year Management Deal 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (U) South Africa\'s Vodacom Group and Econet Wireless 
Nigeria Limited, Nigeria\'s second largest mobile 
service provider, signed a five-year management 
contract on April 1, sealing a deal expected since mid- 
December (ref A).  Econet has adopted a transitional 
name, V-Networks Nigeria Limited, and relinquished 
management control to Vodacom, which will provide 
support for procurement, network design, rollout, 
marketing, and other group services.  Executives expect 
Vodacom to supply $250 million in equity by the end of 
the third quarter, with investment reaching as much as 
$600 million over the next five years.  A reconstituted 
firm, Vodacom Nigeria Limited, will then enter the 
market. 
 
3. (U) Comment: Executives close to the deal expect 
Vodacom\'s entry to improve existing network operations 
and enable the firm to compete more aggressively in the 
Nigerian telecommunications sector.  Vodacom\'s expected 
injection of funds may alleviate the firm\'s chronic 
money problems and allow it to improve services and 
expand more rapidly than it has in the past, rapidly 
enough, perhaps, to threaten its one major competitor, 
MTN Nigeria Communications Limited.  End comment.

4. (U) South African Airways\' (SAA) board accepted a

Eagle Airlines\' technical partner (ref B).  The 
agreement gives SAA management control and a 49 percent 
stake in Nigerian Eagle Airlines, Nigeria\'s new flag 
carrier.  Core investors will likely hold 40 percent of 
the airline\'s $60 million equity, with private 
shareholders taking the remaining 11 percent in an 
initial public offering. 
 
5. (U) Executives at Financial Derivatives Company 
Limited, the Lagos-based economic think tank acting as 
the project\'s financial advisor, expect Nigerian Eagle 
Airlines to begin domestic flights in the fourth 
quarter.  SAA has prepared a detailed launch plan, they 
say, and company executives expect Nigerian Eagle 
Airlines to offer frequent flights between Lagos, 
Abuja, and other major cities.  The airline eventually 
hopes to add services to London, Dubai, Jeddah, 
Johannesburg, and New York.

New Money Laundering Law Signed

6.  (U) The GON\'s newly signed money laundering law 
repeals the Money Laundering Act of 2003 and states 
that \"no person or body corporate shall, except in a 
transaction through a financial institution, make or 
accept cash payment of a sum exceeding: (a) N500,000 or 
its equivalent, in the case of an individual, or (b) 
N2,000,000 or its equivalent, in the case of a body 
corporate.\"  Individuals who violate the law will face 
prison terms of two years or more and fines of at least 
N250,000 ($1,900), a figure likewise applied to 
corporations. 
7. (U) Comment: The GON adopted the original money 
laundering law in an attempt to avoid sanctions from 
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money 
Laundering.  The new version is designed to ensure 
Nigeria is eventually removed from the FATF\'s list of 
countries whose anti-money laundering programs fail to 
meet internationally recognized standards.  The law may 
be difficult to enforce given the poor organizational 
and institutional capacity of the Economic and 
Financial Crimes Commission and related bodies, but it 
represents a step toward reducing cash transactions and 
increasing financial system transparency.  It will have 
little effect, though, unless banks cooperate with law 
enforcement agencies to identify possible criminal 
activity, something they have so far been reluctant to 
do.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIAN DOMESTIC SHIPPING LAW TAKES EFFECT 
 
REF: LAGOS 634 
 
1. SUMMARY. Nigeria\'s sweeping Cabotage Act took effect 
on May 1, requiring all vessels used for domestic trade 
to be Nigerian built, owned and manned.  Nigeria has 
little capacity to meet any of the three requirements, 
and one-year waivers are allowed under the law.  The 
GON has done little to implement the law through 
administrative guidance and processes, and an exception 
for fishing vessels is being carved out even before 
regulatory schemes have been enacted.  Oil executives 
are dismissive of the law\'s impact on their industry, 
asserting that waivers will be easily obtained as 
government officials know all too well that Nigeria\'s 
indigenous industry cannot support the law\'s reach. 
While intended as a protectionist measure to boost 
indigenous participation in shipping and in petroleum 
services, there is no reason to believe that in the 
near term this legislation will be widely enforced or 
that it will have the desired effect of strengthening 
Nigeria\'s fledgling shipping industry.   END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Nigeria\'s Cabotage Act of 2003 took effect May 1, 
2004.  Another example of Nigeria\'s growing 
protectionist proclivity, the law restricts the use of 
foreign vessels used in domestic trade on Nigerian 
waters in an attempt to encourage indigenous firms to 
participate in Nigeria\'s shipping industry.  Most 
analysts agree that Nigeria\'s current registry of 
Nigerian-owned vessels is inadequate to handle the 
domestic coastal trade market.  For example, recently 
published figures from the Nigerian Maritime Authority 
(NMA) indicate that as of December 2003, 1,258 vessels 
were engaged in off-shore oil operations, only 22 of 
which were Nigerian-owned.  Likewise, two Nigerian 
papers recently cited a report on petroleum product 
movement through the Lagos port complex indicating that 
of 266 tanker vessels engaged in coastal trading in 
2003, only 44 were Nigerian-owned. (Because of limited 
jetty facilities, large international tankers bringing 
fuel to Nigeria transfer their cargoes at sea into 
smaller tankers for offloading onshore.) 
 
3. Further, the Nigerian shipbuilding industry is far 
under-capacity in respect to the number of vessels used 
to move goods and people on Nigerian waters.  We do not 
have figures as to the number or types of ships being 
built in Nigeria, but the local newspaper BusinessDay 
recently published a list of eleven shipyards with 
dockyard/slipway capacity ranging from 250 to 25,000 
tons.  Seven had capacities under 2,000 tons. 
 
4. Some growth is reported in the domestic shipping 
sector.  A new industry group has been formed in Lagos, 
the Indigenous Shipowners\' Association of Nigeria 
(ISAN), and some Nigerians are entering the shipping 
industry, particularly as Nigerian-owners of cabotage 
vessels. For example, a new Nigerian-Norwegian joint 
venture, Vigeo Farstad Shipping Ltd., is reportedly 
operating six offshore oil supply vessels.  Japaul 
Ltd., a Port Harcourt shipping firm with a reported 18 
vessels, has announced it will attempt to raise capital 
for expansion by going public on the Nigerian Stock 
Exchange (NSE), a still novel but sound approach to 
capitalization as Nigerian bank interest rates remain 
high and loan maturities short. 
 
5. American oil company executives repeatedly have told 
us they are unconcerned about the cabotage law and they 
anticipate getting waivers for vessels that do not meet 
the law\'s requirements. (COMMENT: Oil companies are 
already working with the GON to meet local content 
requirements in contracting (reftel), so it may be that 
they simply view this law as more of the same. END 
COMMENT.)  Oil services companies could be most 
directly affected by implementation of the law, but 
also seem unconcerned. 
 
6. The Nigerian fishing industry\'s imports of American 
vessels and parts and equipment may be most affected by 
the law if it is not amended.  Manjit Sadarangani, 
owner of Atlantic Shrimpers Ltd., told Commercial 
Attache and Econoff that he wrote several letters to 
the GON arguing the Cabotage Act contradicts the 
Nigerian Investment Promotions Decree of 1995 by 
attempting to restrict foreign ownership of vessels 
transporting passengers or cargo.  He said he further 
argued that since fishing vessels do not transport 
passengers or cargo, they should not have been included 
in the Cabotage Act\'s reach.  Sadarangani said industry 
representatives presented their arguments to President 
Obasanjo directly in early May, and that the president 
ordered fishing vessels be removed from the scope of 
the Cabotage Act. (NOTE: The Embassy sent a letter to 
the GON in mid-May raising concern over the reach of 
the Act and the possibility that the protectionist 
measure may discourage foreign investment in the 
shipping industry, further stifling its expansion 
rather than promoting it as intended.  END NOTE.) 
 
7. We reviewed the Coastal and Inland Shipping 
(Cabotage) Act 2003 as published in the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria Official Gazette, No. 88 Lagos, 3 
October 2003, Vol 90, and an analysis published by KPMG 
in January 2004.  Paragraphs 8-18 summarize Nigeria\'s 
Cabotage Act of 2003. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Only Nigerian-Made Vessels of Nigerian Owners and 
Operators May Ply Nigerian Waters 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
8. Only vessels built and registered in Nigeria and 
that are wholly owned and manned by Nigerian citizens 
may transport cargo and passengers within the waters of 
Nigeria. Further, foreign vessels or tugs cannot tow 
within Nigerian waters except when rendering assistance 
to persons, vessels or aircraft in danger or distress. 
A foreign-made vessel rebuilt in Nigeria may be 
operated in Nigerian waters if all of the rebuilding 
work, including construction of major hull and 
superstructure components, was done in Nigeria. 
Nigerian waters include coastal, territorial, inland, 
and island waters, or any other waters within the 
Exclusive Economic Zone of Nigeria. 
 
----------------- 
Petroleum Sector 
----------------- 
 
9. Several sections of the law apply specifically to 
the petroleum sector.  Any vessel, tug or barge used to 
transport materials or supply services to and from oil 
rigs, platforms and installations located onshore or 
offshore must be owned wholly by a Nigerian citizen. 
The law also applies to the transportation of goods or 
persons to and from an exhaustive list of oil-related 
facilities and operations. 
 
---------- 
Exceptions 
---------- 
 
10. The only exceptions to the Act are for certain 
salvage vessels, vessels used for pollution 
emergencies, vessels used for ocean research by 
Nigerian authorities, and vessels sponsored or operated 
by foreign governments for scientific research. 
 
-------- 
Waivers 
-------- 
 
11. The Minister of Transport may waive provisions of 
the Cabotage Act if there is no Nigerian-owned vessel 
suitable and available to perform a specific activity. 
Likewise, the Minister may issue a waiver if no 
Nigerian shipbuilder has the capacity to construct a 
vessel of a particular type and size needed, or if 
there is no qualified Nigerian officer or crew 
available for specific positions needed. Waivers will 
be valid for one year only, and will be issued first to 
joint venture shipping companies and their vessels 
where the Nigerian partner holds at least 60 percent 
equity in the joint venture, and where that equity is 
held free from any foreign obligations.  Waivers may 
then be issued to vessels owned by any shipping company 
registered in Nigeria. 
 
--------------------------- 
Licenses to Foreign Vessels 
--------------------------- 
 
12. A foreign-owned or foreign-crewed vessel 
participating in the domestic coastal trade must carry 
a license.  A person who resides in Nigeria may apply 
for such a license on behalf of a foreign-owned vessel 
if a waiver condition and other administrative criteria 
are met.  Licenses shall be granted for a fee, which 
must be published.  A tariff will also be imposed on 
vessels obtaining licenses.  A license to a foreign- 
owned vessel shall be valid for no more than one year. 
 
------------ 
Registration 
------------ 
 
13. Every vessel in the domestic coastal trade must be 
registered in the Special Cabotage Register kept by the 
Registrar of Ships.  The Minister of Transport is to 
continually collect information regarding the 
availability, characteristics and uses of Nigerian 
vessels, and record that information in the Special 
Register.  Unless a condition for waiver is present, 
any vessel to be registered must be wholly owned by 
Nigerian citizens or owned by a company of at least 60 
percent Nigerian ownership. 
 
14. \"Bareboat vessels\" to be registered include 
passenger vessels, crew boats, bunkering vessels, 
fishing trawlers, barges, off-shore service vessels, 
tugs, anchor handling tugs and supply vessels, floating 
petroleum storage vessels, dredges, tankers, carriers, 
and any other craft or vessel used to transport 
persons, property or any substance on, through or under 
water. 
 
15. A vessel under a finance agreement may be 
registered if the term of financing is at least three 
years and the financier meets Nigerian citizenship 
requirements under the Act.  The financier\'s interest 
in the vessel may lie only in an investment rather than 
operational capacity, and the financier cannot derive a 
majority of its aggregate revenue from the operation or 
management of the vessel. 
 
16. Foreign-owned vessels already engaged in the 
domestic coastal trade will be allowed temporary 
registration for the duration of the contract for which 
a vessel is employed.  Vessels over 15 years old at the 
time the Act comes into effect will be allowed only 
five more years of service, and must meet seaworthiness 
requirements of appropriate agencies. 
 
------------------------- 
Penalties and Enforcement 
------------------------- 
 
17. Penalties for violations of the Cabotage Act 
include fines up to 15 million naira and forfeiture of 
vessels.  A unit will be created within the National 
Maritime Authority specifically to enforce the Act. 
Officers assigned to the unit may stop and board a 
vessel reasonably believed to be in violation of the 
Act, and may detain the vessel and its officers. 
Officers may search vessels with warrants, and seize 
anything onboard that may serve as evidence of a 
violation of the Act.  A search may be conducted 
without a warrant if exigent circumstances make it 
impractical to obtain a warrant. Under exigent 
circumstances, an enforcement officer may issue a 
detention order without a court order if the officer 
reasonably believes that the vessel was involved in a

SUBJECT: GANG WARFARE IN PORT HARCOURT 
 
REF: ABUJA NI 885 
 
Classified By: JOSEPH GREGOIRE FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), (D), AND (E) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. Gang-style fighting near the city Port 
Harcourt in Rivers State over the last several days has 
resulted in numerous deaths. Two rival gangs associated with 
politically-connected \"godfathers\" are fighting over control 
of villages approximately 10-20 kilometers west of Port 
Harcourt on the edges of the Niger Delta riverine area. If 
the fighting escalates in the next 48 hours, it may threaten 
movement on the waterways leading in and out of Port 
Harcourt, which could affect both oil and gas services as 
well as imports through the ports at Port Harcourt and Onne. 
The fighting in Port Harcourt is unique in Nigeria because, 
unlike the ongoing clashes in the Warri area or up north, the 
conflict in this part of Rivers State is generally not 
ethnically or religiously driven, but stems from disputes 
between political rivals over power and money.  Government 
security forces may be at a loss to deal with this particular 
pocket of violence, because the gangs are known to be 
well-armed and have fairly high-level political backing, and 
because federal forces may be stretched too thin to react. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) On Wednesday, May 26, RSO received information from an 
American-based construction company operating in the Niger 
Delta region that rival gangs had clashed over the last 
weekend and into this week, causing as many as 100 deaths. 
ECONOFF received corroboration from an oil company security 
manager with roots in a village that is at the center of the 
fightinge, and from an executive of a gas production company 
in the region.  We are told two rival gangs associated with 
politically-connected \"godfathers\" are fighting over control 
of the towns of Buguma and Degema, located approximately 
10-20 km. west of Port Harcourt (the villages are visible on 
some Nigerian maps). 
 
3. (C) One concern is that if the fighting escalates, it 
could force the closure shipping lanes along the Bonny River 
channel that are used by oil services companies and 
international oil companies.  Many companies shifted 
operations from Warri to Port Harcourt last year, and most 
offshore development and deep offshore exploration work 
originates from Port Harcourt or the nearby port at Onne. 
Both Port Harcourt and Onne are also home to port complexes 
under the authority of the Nigerian Ports Authority, and are 
used for the landing of Nigerian imports, especially those 
involving the oil and gas industry. 
 
4. (C) An executive of Ocean Energy, an American independent 
offshore oil exploration and development company with 
facility operations based in Onne, told ECONOFF that company 
staff at Onne and Port Harcourt had not noticed any trouble 
in the area, however.  The executive, said he also checked 
with Port Harcourt port management, who reported no 
disruptions. Salem Sallam, a logistics manager with the 
Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) company, which runs the 
Bonny Island LNG plant, confirmed that inter-communal clashes 
took place in Degema and Buguma, but said he expected no 
disruption to Bonny\'s LNG production. 
 
5. (C) Americans live in Port Harcourt, but do not appear 
directly threatened at this time.  Nonetheless, at least one 
jetty in the general area that might be used by oil workers 
was reportedly the scene of a firefight, and the waterways 
could become volaltile.  Also, Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg 
Brown and Root (through a joint venture called TSKJ) 
maintains 60 - 80 Americans (including families) on Bonny 
Island working on the expansion of the Bonny LNG plant. 
Bonny lies just over an hour south of Port Harcourt by fast 
boat, but TSKJ supply lines could be severed if river traffic 
were interrupted. (There are no roads to Bonny, and no fixed 
airstrips on the island other than helipads.)  RSO has 
visited the area and has been briefed on TSKJ contingency 
plans, including evacuation, and RSO, ACS and ECON maintain 
contact with TSKJ on-site managers.  (At the time of this 
writing, the Mission is considering issuing a Warden Message 
regarding the violence around Port Harcourt.) 
 
6. (C) The background to the violence at Port Harcourt is 
different from that elsewhere in the Delta, other than that 
illicit activity often lies at the heart of individual 
conflicts.  In the Warri region, simmering inter-ethnic 
rivalries, along with criminal activity, help sustain a 
general level of instability and lawlessness.  In contrast, 
there is generally law and order in Port Harcourt, but young 
men in the area have formed into gangs to protect a number of 
well-connected individuals including former and current 
Rivers State and national politicians.  The gangs give 
themselves or are given monikers like the \"Ateke Boys,\" the 
\"Bush Boys,\" the \"German Boys,\" and the \"Italian Boys\" to 
identify allegiance to a particular \"godfather.\"  Power plays 
by the central figures are executed by attacks conducted by 
their militias.  Usually the attacks are launched solely 
against rival gangs in their respective territories, but this 
weekend the violence spilled onto jetties and waterways that 
are used for commerce and general transportation. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: It is unclear how state and federal security 
forces will react to the escalation in violence in Port 
Harcourt.   Two sources with knowledge of the Rivers State 
security forces said the State government is at a loss to 
deal with this situation.  Dennis Amachree, the security 
manager for Halliburton, is from the village of Buguma, which 
is at the center of this round of fighting and one earlier in 
the year that also resulted in many deaths.  Amachree told 
ECONOFF that government security forces are anxious because 
they know the gangs have been well-armed by politicians and 
state government officials who previously sponsored some of 
the gangs for their own purposes.  While Embassy staff have 
been told the situation is under control, as we previously 
reported, the military may be stretched too thin to handle 
any new outbreak of violence (reftel). END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: EAIR, ECPS, ETRD, ECON, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA ECONOMIC UPDATE, JUNE 1 
 
1. (U) This update includes: 
 
-- New International Routes for Local Airlines 
-- NITEL Introduces New Tariffs Effective June 1 
-- Recharge Cards Import Ban Effective January 2005 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
New International Routes Approved for Local Airlines 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2. (U) Six local airlines were recently approved by the 
GON to operate new international routes. Four of the 
airlines - Aviation Development Company (ADC), Afrijet, 
Bellview and Kabo may operate intercontinental flights 
from Lagos to Brussels, Madrid, Bombay and Rome 
respectively. Aero Contractors and Chanchangi Airlines 
may run flights to various West African cities 
including Accra, Douala, Malabo and Sao Tome. 
 
3. (U) The Aviation Ministry directed that the airlines 
assigned intercontinental routes must increase their 
capital base to N1 billion ($7.2 million), while those 
on West African routes must increase theirs to N500 
million ($3.6 million) by April 2005. 
 
4. (U) Managing Director of Afrijet, Dr. Harold 
Demuren, said his company, which is recruiting 
crewmembers and procuring equipment, intends to build a 
multi million-naira hangar in Lagos. These upgrades, he 
said, will prepare Afrijet for competition with Iberia, 
as the Spanish airline begins a thrice-weekly flight 
from Lagos in June. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
NITEL Introduces New Tariffs, Effective June 1 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
5. (U) The state-owned Nigerian Telecommunications 
Limited, NITEL, introduced new tariffs for local and 
trunk calls effective June 1. Tariffs on local calls 
increased 51 percent from N4.30k/min to N6.50k/min, 
while trunk calls were reduced 49 percent, from N43/min 
to N22/min. 
 
6. (U) Ig Nwangwu, Public Relations manager of NITEL 
Lagos, said tariffs on calls to GSM networks were 
reduced 13 percent from N30/min to N26/min. But NITEL 
subscribers\' monthly access charge was increased 40 
percent from N500 ($3.60) to N700 ($5.10). 
 
7. (U) Comment: The new tariff regime is NITEL\'s 
response to the keen competition in the sector. Other 
private telecom operators, who have their tariffs 
pegged to the NITEL rate, may also adjust their charges 
appropriately. The effect of the reduction in GSM call 
rates is significant given the prevalence of mobile 
telephony and the GON\'s call for lower tariffs. End 
comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Recharge Cards Importation Ban, Effective January 2005 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8. (U) Minister of Communications Cornelius Adebayo 
recently announced a GON ban on imported recharge cards 
by telecom companies. The ban, which did not come as a 
surprise to most telecom operators, is effective from 
January 1, 2005. 
 
9. (U) Most of the major players in the sector, 
including MTN, Vodacom and the state-owned NITEL now 
import recharge cards. Others like Cellcom and Mtel 
print locally. Joke Giwa of MTN said the company would 
meet the deadline by implementing recommendations of 
the feasibility study it commissioned in September 
2003, on local production of recharge cards. In the 
interim, the company has introduced a Virtual Top Up 
(VTU) method of recharging, which allows subscribers to 
buy airtime without using cards. Nwangwu of NITEL 
stated that the company, which is introducing prepaid 
landlines, will comply with the directive. 
 
10. (U) As the telecom companies jostle to meet the 
deadline, Masterstrokes and Cards Technology, the two 
major local producers of recharge cards are positioning 
for more transactions. The ban is designed to encourage 
foreign firms to establish manufacturing plants in 
Nigeria to take advantage of the huge market.

1. (C) SUMMARY. Recent gang fighting in the Port Harcourt 
area of the Niger Delta highlights yet another brand of 
violence in Nigeria (ref A). Reports from oil services and 
construction company security managers in the field estimate 
that up to 100 people may have died over three to four days 
of fighting last week. As witnessed in that fighting, once 
unleashed, the gangs of Port Harcourt become difficult to 
control, and pose a risk of collateral damage to both local 
residents and the area\'s oil services and shipping 
industries.  In other areas of the South and North, simmering 
ethnic and religious tensions exacerbate struggles for power 
and resources that sometimes become deadly.  But in the 
southern city of Port Harcourt, violence is often perpetrated 
by gangs originally formed as political enforcers during the 
1999 and 2003 elections.  These armed gangs have taken on the 
combined roles of vigilantes and guns for hire.  Americans do 
live and work in Port Harcourt, but to date, we are not aware 
of any Americans killed or injured in this strand of 
violence.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) Deadly clashes between rival gangs in the areas around 
Port Harcourt in the last week of May (ref B) highlight a 
brand of violence unique to this area of the Delta. 
Political heavyweights in Rivers State are said to have 
sponsored enforcer gangs to defend their positions and 
suppress their rivals. The gangs are well-armed and have 
grown in power and belligerence.  We can identify several of 
the gangs and their roots, and it seems two in particular, 
the Ateke Boys and the Bush Boys, are the central enforcers 
of Port Harcourt\'s thug-based rivalries. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
The Ateke Boys: Governor Odili\'s Vigilantes 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (C) It is speculated that immediately following the 1999 
general elections that ushered in a new hope for democracy in 
Nigeria, as well as the rising clout of the president\'s 
People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Peter Odili, the then 
new PDP governor of Rivers State, sought to solidify his 
party\'s power base and eliminate any footholds maintained by 
the opposition All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP).  Dr. Abiye 
Sekibo, the present federal Minister of Transport, was 
Odili\'s state secretary at the time, and is said to have put 
together a gang of armed thugs loyal to the governor and the 
PDP, financed by State and/or party funds.  These enforcers 
were deployed to ANPP strongholds in Rivers State, and 
targeted Chief Rufus Ada George, the former Abacha regime 
governor of Rivers State for whom Odili worked as deputy 
governor prior to the 1999 elections. 
 
4. (C) Over time these Odili-backed thugs grew in power and 
boldness.  It is said they refused to give up their arms, and 
continued to operate in groups as vigilantes and mercenaries, 
willing to commit even murder for hire.  The most notorious 
of these groups is led by a man called Ateke Tom, and became 
known as the Ateke Boys (a sub-set is known also as the 
Icelanders).  Dennis Amachree, Halliburton\'s security manager 
who hails from a village at the center of the recent clashes, 
told us in January 2004 that the Ateke Boys rigged the 1993 
polls in favor of the PDP and intimidated those who favored 
other candidates.  Some say the Ateke Boys have since been 
considered outlaws by the Rivers State and federal 
governments.  Amachree, however, alleges that when reports of 
excessive violence by the Ateke Boys caused the Inspector 
General of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) to send a team of 
investigators to arrest members of the gang and take them to 
Abuja, the Rivers State government intervened, convincing the 
NPF that the Ateke Boys were necessary vigilantes helping 
maintain law and order in the remote villages of the Niger 
Delta region.  Amachree described the Rivers State NPF 
Command as frustrated, prevented by the leaders of the state 
government from taking action as the police watch the Ateke 
Boys flaunt their weapons and criminal activities. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
The Bush Boys: Former Governor Protects Himself 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (C) It is believed that former Rivers State governor Rufus 
Ada George sponsors a group of thugs of his own, known as the 
Bush Boys, to protect himself and his interests in the Port 
Harcourt area.  Ada George was once arrested and detained by 
Odili, and appears to have decided to fight fire with fire. 
The Bush Boys, sometimes referred to as the Amadi-Ama Boys, 
periodically clash with the Ateke Boys over control of 
villages around Port Harcourt, and some 50 people are said to 
have died in such fighting in January. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Asari Gang: Rivalry Leads to Recent Violence 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (C) During the 2003 elections, a vigilante group allegedly 
under the direction of Alhaji Asari Dokubo, the President of 
the Ijaw Youth Council, is said to have run similar 
intimidation and vote rigging schemes as the Ateke Boys, also 
on behalf of the PDP.  A growing rivalry between the Asari 
gang and the Ateke Boys came to a head earlier this year over 
an attempt by the Ateke Boys (on behalf of a state government 
commissioner) to displace the traditional ruler of the area 
known as Kalibariland, west of Port Harcourt.  The Ateke Boys 
moved into the town of Buguma after bloody clashes and 
\"occupied\" it for several months.  The Asari gang retaliated 
in late May (ref B), calling in reinforcements from the Ijaw 
community and possibly the Bush Boys to displace the Ateke 
Boys. 
 
7. (C)  Managers from TSKJ construction company, a consortium 
led by Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root, told 
us on May 28 that it suspended its boat traffic along the 
Bonny River and around Port Harcourt for the weekend in 
anticipation of the ongoing violence and possible response 
from the Nigerian Navy.  Company managers were particularly 
concerned that the violence could escalate with an alliance 
among the Asari gang, the Bush Boys, and unaligned Ijaw 
fighters.  They also were concerned that Governor Odili might 
support the Ateke Boys, fueling the fight and possibly 
shutting down river traffic.  On June 2, news reports and oil 
services company sources indicated that President Obasanjo 
ordered Navy, Army and Mobile Police (MOPOL) assets deployed 
to Buguma and its environs to stabilize the situation, and 
Governor Odili urged the town\'s fleeing residents to return 
home and remain calm. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Naming Rites: International Smorgasbord 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (C) We have also heard of a number of other gangs 
operating in and around Port Harcourt under names such as the 
Italian Boys and the German Boys.  Their sponsors are yet 
unknown to us (as are the roots of their monikers), but the 
gangs seem to be involved in semi-organized criminal 
enterprises such as car theft rings and armed robberies. 
Toyota 4X4 trucks driven by many oil service companies are 
favorite targets. 
 
9. (C) COMMENT.  It seems Governor Odili of Rivers State took 
the same step to try to solidify his power base as other 
politicians and opportunists have done in other parts of the 
Delta; he armed a group of disenfranchised youths and paid 
them for their loyalty.  And as we have seen in the conflicts 
around Warri, once these disenfranchised and disillusioned 
youths taste the power that comes from the barrel of a gun, 
it is impossible to convince them to give it up, and 
extremely difficult to keep them under control.  Odili\'s 
thugs appear to have splintered, and are now fighting each 
other under the patronage of others.  The governor of Rivers 
State may have reached a crossroads; because the state 
government has a vital interest in maintaining peace and 
commercial security in and around Port Harcourt, he may be 
forced to stop backing the Ateke Boys and let the police and 
federal forces clean up the area, if they can.  As said by 
Halliburton\'s Amachree, \"the government has created monsters 
that it cannot control.\"  But control of the waterways of 
Port Harcourt and Bonny River is essential to maintaining 
shipping and oil services operations in the Delta.  END 
COMMENT.

SUBJECT:  BAD WITH THE GOOD - FUEL PRICES RISE  AS  OIL 
PRICES SOAR 
 
REF: A: 2004 LAGOS 30 
 
     B: 2003 Lagos 2422 
 
1.   (SBU) SUMMARY.  As Nigerians wonder if a 
nationwide strike will be called yet again over fuel 
prices, private fuel marketers have decided to scale 
back their import level of the last 60 days as they 
launch a public awareness campaign of their own to 
explain the rise in gasoline prices.  Official consumer 
fuel prices have risen nearly 20 percent in the last 
month with the rising tide of world petroleum prices, 
and the government will be hard pressed to meet demands 
of labor unions threatening to strike unless prices are 
reversed to December 2003 levels.  While the GON has 
not been collecting the controversial fuel tax that 
sparked strike threats in January and led to a court 
order maintaining a fragile peace between the federal 
government and the unions, NNPC is still in the fuel 
business and keeping prices from rising even faster by 
marketing at least half of Nigeria\'s fuel consumption 
at subsidized rates.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) As world petroleum prices reached record highs 
in recent weeks, the price of fuel in Nigeria has also 
been rising.  Pump prices for gasoline in Lagos on June 
7 were generally 49.90 naira per liter, 20 percent 
higher than a month ago, and news reports indicate 
prices are even higher in distant regions of the 
country.  The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has 
threatened a nationwide strike on Wednesday, June 9, in 
protest of the high prices, and is demanding that the 
federal government reduce fuel prices to the December 
2003 level of 36 naira per liter.  The NLC is backing 
away from a claim that the GON violated a court order 
of January 2004 that prohibited it from imposing a fuel 
tax of 1.5 naira per liter.  Industry sources tell us 
the fuel tax has not been collected by the government 
nor charged by marketers since the court order was 
issued, however. 
 
----------------------------- 
Root Cause: Supply and Demand 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Marketers insist that the rise in fuel prices in 
Nigeria is directly linked to rising world petroleum 
costs and other market forces.  Nigeria\'s refineries 
are operating well below capacity, which forces Nigeria 
to continue to import most of the fuel it consumes 
including gasoline (petrol), diesel, kerosene and jet 
fuel.  The government, for the most part, seems to 
accept the marketers\' explanation.  While some 
officials at the Department of Petroleum Resources 
(DPR) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory 
Authority (PPPRA) have publicly stated displeasure over 
\"unauthorized\" fuel price increases, it seems 
regulators are allowing fuel prices to rise without 
taking action against retailers. 
 
4. (U) Marketers have also felt a cash flow pinch in 
recent weeks, after the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) shortened its credit window on fuel 
purchases from 30 to 15 days for major marketers.  Some 
marketers responded by revising their per-liter 
consumer price in order to more quickly cover the cost 
of NNPC-sourced fuel and to cover the high cost of 
borrowing money when required for international or NNPC 
fuel purchases. 
 
------------------------------- 
Just When It Thought It Was Out 
------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) O.T. \"Jimmy\" Adelekan, Executive Director of 
Texaco Nigeria, told Econoff on June 7 that during much 
of March, April and May, private marketers imported 
roughly half of the fuel consumed in Nigeria, leaving 
NNPC responsible for the other half through refinery 
production and imports.  Adelekan said that during 
April and through May 20, marketers imported 100 
percent of the fuel offloaded at the Apapa fuel jetty 
in Lagos, which accounts for half of the nation\'s total 
fuel consumption. Adelekan said that the Port Harcourt 
refinery may be producing up to 40 percent of its 
capacity, but NNPC must still import a large volume of 
fuel to meet market demand.  He said NNPC imports fuel 
through the recently upgraded Atlas Cove transfer 
facility in Lagos, as well as through other ports such 
as Port Harcourt. 
 
6. (SBU) Adelekan said the landed price of petrol in 
Nigeria is about 50 naira per liter. He said NNPC is 
selling fuel to retailers for 38.50 naira per liter, 
indicating that NNPC continues to subsidize fuel 
prices.  Retailers, including the major marketers such 
as Texaco and Mobil, mix their own fuel stocks with 
purchases from NNPC, which lowers the average cost to 
around 44.5 naira per liter.  The retailers then add in 
distribution and profit margins, reflected in an 
average retail price of 49.5 naira per liter in Lagos. 
(NOTE: On June 7 most stations in Lagos sold gasoline 
at 49.9, while Mobil stations uniformly sold at 49.8. 
Diesel was selling at 50 naira per liter at all 
stations observed. END NOTE.) Transport costs to move 
fuel to other parts of Nigeria result in regional price 
differences throughout the country. 
 
7. (SBU)  Texaco\'s Adelekan noted that the rising flap 
over fuel prices has spooked the major marketers, who 
import fuel jointly through an import tendering 
committee (ref A).  According to Adelekan, the 
marketers informed NNPC that they are reducing their 
imports for June, and will continue to do so if they 
are given cause to question their ability to recoup 
import costs, such as government attempts to impose 
price caps below profitability. 
 
-------------------- 
Supply Steady So Far 
-------------------- 
 
8. (U) We have not seen queues stretching for miles 
outside of fuel stations as is the usual occurrence in 
advance of strike-talk and amidst fuel price increases. 
The reason may be that Nigerians have become accustomed 
to NLC strike threats not materializing.  Also, prices 
have been creeping upward based on market pressures, 
rather than radically rising overnight as in the past 
in reaction to government edict.  Recent heavy rains 
have also restricted movement around cities such as 
Lagos, and perhaps have dampened motivation to wait in 
line.  Moreover, supplies have been steady, giving no 
indication of shortage, which usually sparks panic 
buying, hoarding, and roadside black market sales. 
 
9. (U) NOTE: Tankers for NNPC can be seen docking at 
Atlas Cove\'s new jetty at the mouth of the Lagos harbor 
channel, but the facility appears capable of handling 
only one ship at a time.  Atlas Cove also operates a 
single point mooring (SPM) buoy approximately six miles 
offshore Lagos.  Even with the new state-of-the-art 
jetty, offloading at Atlas Cove can be hampered by 
facility problems elsewhere. Atlas Cove is an 
offloading point only, and problems with pipelines or 
distribution equipment at its nearest depot some 60 
kilometers away sometimes slow the offloading process. 
END NOTE. 
 
10. (SBU) COMMENT: Because of marketers\' skittishness 
regarding market prices and potential domestic price 
caps, the outcome of strike negotiations this week will 
have a direct effect on major marketers\' participation 
in fuel importation in the short-term, and possibly on 
fuel supplies if NNPC cannot make up the difference. 
NNPC is clearly still in the business of fuel importing 
and marketing, and still in the business of subsidizing 
fuel prices in Nigeria.  Officials at NNPC, PPPRA and 
DPR seem of two minds over just how far the GON will go 
to deregulate the downstream sector.  For example, 
NNPC\'s Group Managing Director Funshi Kupolokun 
recently reiterated his support for total 
liberalization of the sector, but he did so while 
warning marketers that hoarding and price gouging will 
be met by harsh government penalty, and while 
commissioning a new NNPC \"Mega Station\" in Enugu, one 
of several new government-owned retail fuel outlets 
planned around the country.  Given world petroleum 
prices and market pressures in Nigeria, the GON will be 
hard-pressed to meet NLC demands of a fuel price 
rollback without deepening the government subsidy, and 
potentially eating up any windfall from high crude oil 
prices; the GON has not budgeted for NNPC fuel 
subsidies.  In the meantime, fuel marketers have 
launched a public awareness campaign with 
advertisements in major papers explaining what they say 
is the real reason for price increases. 
 
11. (SBU) But as usual (ref B), most eyes are on petrol 
prices, possibly leaving room for a compromise allowing 
for diesel, kerosene, and jet fuel prices to continue 
rising.  Such a move might allow the NLC and GON to 
save face while avoiding another round of strike 
brinkmanship, but it would worsen the hardship of 
Nigerians who would experience higher long-haul 
transport charges and thus higher commodity prices, 
higher airline ticket prices, and the higher cost of 
using generators passed on to final consumers.  Since 
retail petrol sales are the key to the industry, any 
overt or de facto price cap now would put up yet 
another obstacle in the way toward fuel deregulation in 
Nigeria.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: GON SEEKS ALTERNATIVES TO SAA FOR NIGERIA EAGLE 
AIRLINES 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The GON is considering new expressions of 
interest from European carriers (Virgin Atlantic, Air 
France/KLM and Lufthansa) to become the technical partner to 
the proposed Nigerian Eagle Airlines (NEA). The GON\'s 
introduction of new conditions for a reciprocal agreement 
mandating that Nigerians be allowed to buy 10 percent equity 
in South African Airways (SAA) has stalled the talks with 
SAA, previously designated tentative technical partner to 
the NEA. Executives involved in the talks say Virgin 
Atlantic is likely to be chosen if SAA remains 
uncompromising.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) The anticipated take-off of NEA, previously scheduled 
for second quarter of 2004, is now stalled because of a 
breakdown in talks between the GON and SAA.  This was 
brought about by a recent GON demand that a reciprocal 
agreement permit Nigerians to buy 10 percent equity in SAA 
if it should ever be privatised.  This precondition to the 
signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) reflects 
earlier criticism, particularly by civil society, that the 
GON had moved too quickly to select SAA as the tentative 
technical partner of the new flag carrier. 
 
3. (U) Aviation Minister Isa Yuguda announced the GON\'s 
decision to look for alternatives to SAA as technical 
partner several days ago. Alternative airlines being 
considered include European carriers Virgin Atlantic, Air 
France/KLM and Lufthansa, which he said had submitted bids 
for the joint venture. According to Bismarck Rewane, the 
Managing Director of Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) 
Limited, the project\'s financial advisors, Virgin Atlantic 
seems to be the GON\'s preferred bidder. 
 
4. (U) Though SAA officials have reportedly denied a glitch 
to the signing of an MOU and have asserted that negotiations 
are progressing, Yuguda has merely stated that SAA can 
resubmit a bid to be NEA\'s technical partner. He added that 
SAA\'s willingness or refusal to meet the GON\'s demand for a 
reciprocal agreement remains a major determinant of SAA\'s 
future success or failure to obtain the contract if any. 
 
5. (U) Comment: As the selection process suggests, the 
choice of a technical partner may be more political than 
economic, given the GON\'s historical ties to Europe. If 
selected, Virgin Atlantic would run two daily flights on the 
lucrative Lagos-London route, along with other regional and 
intercontinental routes, reserved for the flag carrier. 
While Rewane believes that the bid is still open, he fears 
that the difficulty of his firm\'s getting together a group 
of core investors will be compounded by the probability that 
the GON will yet introduce new conditions during its 
negotiations with other prospective investors, as it did 
with SAA. End comment.

SUBJECT: MEASURABLE SUCCESS IN NIGERIAN HIV/AIDS 
INITIATIVES 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Ambassadors Tobias and Campbell and 
USAID Country Director Liberi met with Nigerian 
Minister of Health Lambo on June 4 to discuss 
coordination between the GON national HIV/AIDS strategy 
and USG objectives under the President\'s Emergency Plan 
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  Reflecting GON efforts to 
meet increasing demand for treatment in existing 
centers, Lambo announced local production of 
antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to begin in November 2004. 
He also said that while there had been a registered 
decline in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, there is no cause 
for complacency.  Tobias applauded the GON\'s efforts 
and said he hopes Nigeria will serve as an example for 
the region.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU)  On Friday, June 4 in Lagos, Ambassador 
Randall Tobias, Ambassador John Campbell, and USAID 
Director Dawn Liberi met with the Nigerian Minister of 
Health, Professor Eyitayo Lambo.  Lambo said that, 
while Nigeria confronts public relations challenges 
pertaining to its polio vaccine program, HIV/AIDS 
initiatives are becoming more effective.  Lambo added 
that Nigeria\'s national prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS has 
declined from 5.8 percent to 5.0 percent, according to 
national sero-prevalence surveys conducted in 2001 and 
2003. He cautioned that Nigeria could only begin to 
claim success if the prevalence rate continues to 
decline in the next surveillance survey planned for 
2005.  Even with a lower prevalence rate, Lambo 
acknowledged that Nigeria\'s population of \"140\" million 
presents difficult challenges in reducing the number of 
people infected. 
 
3. (SBU) Lambo also said the GON has worked largely 
with the secondary and tertiary institutions in 
implementing HIV/AIDS education and prevention 
programs, adding that work in the primary institutions 
must be revitalized.  Lambo outlined achievements 
Nigeria has made since launching the 2002 pilot program 
to provide affordable antiretroviral (ARV) treatment. 
He said the GON has established 25 treatment centers, 
and over-enrollment in these centers indicates that the 
demand for ARV drugs and resources for treatment far 
exceeds the supply. (GON initiatives provide for an 
initial 10,000 adults and 5,000 children to benefit 
from a monthly administration of ARV drugs. 
Beneficiaries pay 1000N for this service, approximately 
$7 USD per month instead of the $25-$72 USD commercial 
cost for ARV treatment.  The GON is spending 1.5 
billion naira (approximately 11.5 million USD) on this 
subsidized service). 
 
4. (SBU) Lambo outlined five principles that guide all 
GON-supported HIV/AIDS initiatives: 1) country 
involvement, 2) accountability, 3) transparency, 4) 
value-for-money or showing results, and 5) 
sustainability. These reflect Nigeria\'s commitment to 
the President\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
(PEPFAR). Lambo then made nine major points with 
respect to these principles. 
 
Country ownership: It is being achieved in practical 
terms through cooperation between the steering 
committee and the USG. 
 
Adherence to national policy plan guidelines: The GON 
is realizing this by strengthening its existing work, 
particularly in the 25 treatment sites established. 
 
Coordination of efforts: To ensure that \"Three by 
Five\", PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and GON initiatives do 
not duplicate efforts, the implementing agencies\' of 
these programs should not concentrate their efforts in 
one state (as is being done in Jos); instead they 
should coordinate to ensure that treatment centers are 
established in every state. 
 
Strengthening systems: Success is possible only with 
improvement of the overall health care system.  Lambo 
referred to a recent international survey ranking 
Nigeria 187/191 and stated that only an efficient and 
effective system can support the GON goal of having 
350,000 on ARV treatment by 2006. 
 
Focus on commodities: The GON wants to lower barriers 
to ensure acceptance and use of generic drugs.  The 
National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and 
Control (NAFDAC), Nigeria\'s regulatory body, is working 
to certify ARV drugs for future use. 
 
Support for basic research: It is necessary to ensure 
that operational research is being conducted.  Lambo 
said this point is important to him because of his 
background and the time he spent conducting post- 
graduate research in Rochester, New York. 
 
Capacity-building: It will be achieved when there are 
adequate skills among the population and at the centers 
to support often complicated treatment regimes. 
 
Demonstrated commitment: Measurable success will be 
achieved only when Nigeria can show quantifiable and 
concrete results. 
 
Sustainability: It will be achieved when the USG and 
other donors make the commitment to continue investment 
and collaboration.  Lambo expressed concern that since 
ARV treatment is often for a lifetime, beneficiaries 
cannot be abandoned after five years; i.e., at the 
conclusion of PEPFAR. 
 
5. (SBU) Lambo emphasized Nigeria\'s commitment to 
locally produced ARV drugs.  He said three Nigerian 
companies are prepared to begin production by November 
2004. The GON is investigating the potential for 
increasing production capacity through use of an 
existing army drug manufacturing facility in Lagos. 
 
6. (SBU) Ambassador Tobias applauded Nigeria\'s efforts 
and the consistency of the GON message.  He lauded 
Lambo\'s demonstrated leadership and commitment, and 
stated that Nigeria is a positive example for Africa 
and the rest of the world.  Ambassador Tobias expressed 
the intent of the USG to provide assistance that would 
be consistent with the intent of the Presidential 
Emergency Plan, but only in ways that were also 
consistent with the policies of the GON.  Ambassador 
Tobias closed the meeting by emphasizing that USG has 
made a commitment to Nigeria and has the technology, 
wherewithal, and obligation to assist; but the USG will 
do so only within the coordinated framework of 
Nigeria\'s HIV/AIDS policy. 
 
7.  (U) Ambassadors Tobias and Campbell have cleared 
this message.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PREL, PGOV, ECON, KDEM, PINR, NI 
SUBJECT: AH, THE \"O\'S!\" - A VISIT TO OGUN, OYO, OSUN, AND 
ONDO STATES (PART 1 OF 4) 
 
1. Summary. This is the first of a four-part report on 
ConOffs visit to four of the five former Alliance for 
Democracy Party (AD) States, that were taken by the Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2003 and 2004 federal, state 
and local elections.  After one year under new 
administrations, all four States seem to be making progress 
in delivering critical government services such as free 
education, poverty alleviation and infrastructure 
improvements.  The AD and its primary founding organization, 
the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, seem 
to be floundering in their effort to find political 
significance in the southwest before the elections in 2007. 
Ogun State, more than the other three, was able to show 
progress the new administration  made in only one year. 
Despite its proximity to AD-controlled Lagos State, we found 
AD had almost no visibility in Ogun. End summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  Ogun - \"The Gateway State\" and Home State of 
President Olusegun Obasanjo 
 
Ogun State surrounds Lagos State on the north, east and west, 
seeming to crowd Lagos south into the Bight of Benin.  Ogun, 
like the other three States visited, was once part of the now 
defunct Western Region and assumed its current borders only 
in 1976 when it was formed by the merger of the provinces of 
Abeokuta and Ijebu.  The majority of the population is ethnic 
Yoruba or from Yoruba \"sub-ethnic\" tribes such as the Oyo, 
Egba, and Ijebu.  State officials told us that the State has 
now equal numbers of Christians and Muslims.  However, our 
casual observation of the numbers of women wearing distinctly 
Muslim head coverings and men in white Hajj skullcaps on the 
streets and in the markets  gave the impression that Muslims 
are in the majority.  On the main road leading into the 
capital city, Abeokuta, the first place of worship visitors 
pass is a well-kept, possibly new, mosque.  There is almost a 
one-to-one ratio of mosques to churches in Abeokuta. 
 
Economics 
 
3. (SBU) The Right Honorable Titi Oseni, the only female 
Speaker of a State House of Assembly in Nigeria, arranged a 
formal presentation for PolOffs\' visit on May 17.  In our 
meeting were the Commissioners for Information and Strategy, 
Economic Planning and Development, Communications, 
Agriculture and Tourism.  Oseni also invited fourteen members 
of the Assembly, including the lone, remaining Alliance for 
Democracy (AD) member, and a dozen press persons. 
Yosolaoluwa Akinbi, Special Advisor to the Governor for 
Economic Planning and Development, and one of two women in 
Governor Gbenga Daniel\'s cabinet, gave a lucid and detailed 
account of what this year-old administration has done already 
and plans to do.  She pointed out that the State government 
has saved 2 billion naira in the past year in awarding 
contracts for government services by imposing a system of 
transparency and accountability. Akinbi said that Ogun is 
unusual among Nigerian States because only about twenty 
thousand of its five million residents work for the 
government. Job creation by the private sector is, therefor, 
a priority economic issue for the Daniel administration. 
The State has established the Ogun State Employment 
Generation Programme to train unemployed youths for 
agricultural and nonagricultural jobs.  While in training, 
the youths receive 600 naira per week to encourage them to 
stay with the program, and are given favorable loans or 
grants of money and equipment to start up businesses after 
completing the program.  Five thousand men recently completed 
the program at a cost of 80 million naira, and, according to 
Akinbi, this will generate 45,000 future jobs. 
 
4.  (SBU) The Governor\'s goal is for all his administration\'s 
projects to be fully funded by internally generated revenue 
at the end of his four year term. Describing some of the 
steps the administration is taking toward that goal, Akinbi 
said Ogun is cooperating with neighboring Ondo State to 
develop a Free Trade Export Zone.  (Comment.  The Ogun State 
government has contacted the Foreign Commercial Service in 
Lagos to discuss what assistance the USG can give to this 
project. End comment.)  The State has also granted Agip Oil 
development contracts along its coastline. Speaker Oseni 
added that Ogun has already begun advance planning for the 
oil industry in Ogun through infrastructure improvements and 
environmental impact studies.  She said Ogun would not be 
overrun by tanker trailers and pollution as other 
oil-producing States had been.  Agriculture and tourism are 
also high priority areas where the State hopes to attract 
investors and create jobs.  Ogun has begun to rehabilitate 
old or abandoned citrus and cocoa plantations as well as 
establish new plantations.  It has made large purchases of 
the federal government\'s price-subsidized fertilizer for 
distribution to Ogun\'s farmers.  The State claims many scenic 
areas or historical sites, but there is, as yet, insufficient 
support for the 300% growth in the tourism industry that the 
Governor has demanded.  Although the roads in Ogun are some 
of the best-maintained that we have seen in southern Nigeria, 
there are no hotels, restaurants, etc. either along the road 
or in Abeokuta that would meet minimum Western standards. 
 
Image control 
 
5. (SBU) Commissioner for Information Niran Malaolu said the 
Governor\'s main public information message was \"The PDP\'s 
(Peoples Democratic Party) taking over in Ogun is not just a 
fluke; it is a good thing for this region and will bring us 
together.\"  Governor Daniel wants improved government 
services delivered to all the people.  The governor is 
advertising Ogun\'s history of peace and security as a way to 
entice investors and create jobs.  Daniel is focusing on 
housing, especially for the low income families, by offering 
\"micro-mortgages.\"  According to Malaolu, the administration 
is completely caught up on all salary back payments for state 
civil servants, pensioners, health care workers, and 
teachers, and has sufficient budget allocation to continue 
free primary education in the State.  In another move to 
improve services and enhance transparency and accountability, 
Daniel has let contracts to an information technology company 
to install \"e-government\" systems to handle state government 
communications networks, payroll and pension systems, and 
contracting.  Malaolu said these systems will \"create easy 
access between the government and the governed.\" 
 
Politics 
 
6. (SBU) The Right Honorable Oseni then took the floor to 
describe the political scene.  She said that the House of 
Assembly has 26 members representing 20 Local Government 
Areas (LGAs).  Ogun did not create any new LGAs because, 
according to Oseni, they \"didn\'t need them.\"  During the past 
year in office the Assembly has passed 158 resolutions and 
seen 12 legislative bills signed by the governor.  Ogun was 
the first State to pass a Children\'s Rights Bill that 
guarantees its citizens such things as free primary 
education.  The House holds its session in the Yoruba 
language every Wednesday, and has \"Governor Explain This\" 
meetings once every quarter where legislators are allowed to 
quiz the governor on his executive actions.  All general 
sessions of the Assembly are open to the public and records 
of all sessions are published and for sale to the public. 
Oseni said  some of her priorities are improving Assembly 
staff benefits and refurbishing the Assembly\'s public spaces. 
 She invited us to sit in briefly on one of the Assembly\'s 
sessions in its newly refurbished chamber.  In closing, Oseni 
said the legislators are very interested in US exchange or 
training programs for legislators. 
 
7.  (SBU) Biographic note: Justus Olugbenga Daniel was born 
April 6, 1956.  He is the son of a Protestant clergyman.  He 
was educated entirely in Nigeria and holds a degree in 
engineering and an MBA.  In 1990, after holding managerial 
positions with several international engineering firms, he 
founded his own successful company, Kresta Laurel, that 
produces lifting devices and power generators.  Daniel has 
established a non-profit organization, Gateway Front 
Foundation, that benefits, mainly, the people of Ogun State. 
He is married to Yeye Olufunke Daniel and has four sons and 
one daughter.  Daniel has been active in politics since his 
undergraduate days at Lagos Polytechnic and University of 
Lagos.  But he decided to apply his business management 
talents to running a state government only shortly before the 
2003 elections.  In 2004 he was named Best Performing 
Governor in Nigeria for 2003. He carries the traditional 
title of Otunba Adeoti of Omu-Ijebu. End bio note.

1. (C) SUMMARY: This is the first in a series of four cables 
addressing the security, political, and humanitarian 
situation in the Niger Delta based on a field visit by POLOFF 
and ECONOFF to Warri June 7 and 8. This cable addresses the 
overall security situation, Joint Task Force (JTF) Operation 
Restore Hope\'s response to the April 23 killings of two 
AMCITS, the proliferation of small arms, and the 
consolidation of power and purpose by the militant youths in 
the area.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
GETTING THE BALL ROLLING 
------------------------ 
 
2. (C) The killings of two AMCIT oil services contract 
workers along the Benin River (refs A,B,C) have precipitated 
a course of events in the Niger Delta. JTF Commander BG Elias 
Zamani (strictly protect) told Consulate Officers that after 
the killings the JTF arrested over 60 militant youths from 
both ethnic groups in a dragnet to obtain intelligence (ref 
A) and warned them that whichever village was responsible for 
the attack would \"pay.\" Zamani told us he expressed his 
\"disappointment\" with the youth leaders for their poor 
leadership and for creating an atmosphere of chaos and 
violence.  He advised them to cooperate with the JTF and 
provide information on the killings.  Having been held in 
custody together, the youths were able to discuss the attack, 
as well as other issues.  Ironically, this forced 
togetherness in the wake of a JTF investigation helped create 
an atmosphere that laid the foundation for a cease-fire 
agreement (septel). 
 
-------------------------------- 
IJAW YOUTHS, CONSOLIDATING POWER 
-------------------------------- 
 
3.  (S/NF) Sam Ken (strictly protect), a senior militant Ijaw 
youth leader and one of the key architects of the cease-fire, 
told Consulate Officers that he has been cooperating with 
Zamani and the JTF.  He explained that the April 23 attack 
was a planned kidnapping gone awry and carried out by a 
criminal Ijaw militant youth group, which he said are 
self-styled \"commandos.\"  He explained that the commandos are 
broken into groups of operation throughout the riverine area, 
largely along Ijaw clan lines. Commando groups in general are 
also responsible for bank robberies in Warri and other 
violent crimes. Commandos located near the Benin River, Ken 
claims, were responsible for the AMCIT killings and the 
November 2003 kidnappings for ransom of expatriate employees 
from the Scottish oil services firm Bredero Shaw (ref F). 
 
 
4.  (S/NF) Motivated by a fear of JTF reprisals for the AMCIT 
killings and a desire to find a peaceful and political 
solution to the crisis, Ken told CONOFFS that the Ijaw youth 
leadership is cleaning house.  The youth leadership has 
targeted the commando groups, specifically its overall leader 
John Ikpoko.  Ken bluntly stated that the Ijaw youth 
leadership had killed 17 commando leaders and members who had 
refused to abide by the cease-fire or curb their criminal 
operations and delivered them to the JTF headquarters. 
Ikpoko escaped the assassination teams and is in hiding. 
(Note: \"Criminal operations\" does not likely refer to 
facilitating illegal oil bunkering, which Ken was reluctant 
to discuss in detail.  End note.)  On June 5, the JTF held a 
press conference and broadcast pictures of the slain commando 
leaders on national television, claiming that the \"sea 
pirates\" were killed by JTF forces.  Zamani, in his 
conversation with Consulate Officers, claimed that JTF forces 
killed the 17 men.  (Note: In our conversation with Zamani he 
was warm and relatively open, willing to discuss even 
sensitive issues in further detail.  However, when asked 
about the deaths of the 17 \"commandos\", his demeanor changed 
and he became very closed-lipped. His change in behavior may 
lend credence to Ken\'s version of events.  End note.) 
 
------------------- 
THE ORIGINS OF GUNS 
------------------- 
 
5.  (S/NF) Illegal oil bunkering runs rampant in the region. 
Mission reporting has linked shady oil deals to First Lady 
Stella Obasanjo (Ref G).  Ijaw and Itsekiri youths and elders 
accuse unnamed high-ranking politicians in Abuja, while 
unconfirmed reports claim that Lebanese nationals possibly 
funding the terrorist groups Hamas and Hizbollah, the Russian 
Mafia, and drug cartels are involved (Refs B and H). 
Militant youths have been used to protect and facilitate the 
bunkering of crude oil and, to do so, have acquired small 
arms, namely AK-47s.  Ken told Consulate Officers that most 
of the youth\'s weaponry and ammunition comes from the 
Nigerian Army, who sells them in large quantities packaged in 
crates.  Other arms originate from conflict areas in West 
Africa and some are locally made in Warri.  However, Ken also 
implicated Lebanon and North Korea as sources of arms. 
(Comment: In his discussions, Ken was very frank about the 
African origins of arms, including the Nigerian Army.  He 
showed signs of nervousness when implicating the Lebanese and 
was very nervous, agitated, and possibly deceitful when 
implicating the North Koreans.  When pressed to clarify 
further, Ken initially referred to the North Koreans as 
\"small white people,\" then \"Asians,\" then \"Koreans,\" then 
\"North Koreans.\" End Comment.) 
 
-------------- 
JTF Operations 
-------------- 
 
6.  (S/NF) Although the JTF\'s ability to exercise its power 
in the riverine areas around Warri is limited, its actions 
have improved security along the Benin River.  Zamani 
confirmed he has set up a forward deployment base at the 
mouth of the Benin River near the village of Ogheye Dunigun 
(ref A).  He has also set up a deployment area in another 
village further down the Benin River and is slowly ratcheting 
up his presence there.  JTF forces already secure Chevron 
Nigeria Limited (CNL) flow stations and facilities along the 
river, but they are trying to provide longer-term security in 
the area to ensure the safety of CNL operations and enable 
over 10,000 Itsekiri internally displaced persons (IDPs) to 
return (septel).  A handful of Itsekiri youth returned to 
their villages in April, hoping that others will follow, but 
Zamani has told the Itsekiri to wait until he has finalized 
his deployments before they begin returning home in large 
numbers. 
 
7.  (S/NF) Zamani has also declared war on the commando 
groups.  Ken told Consulate Officers that with Ijaw youth 
leadership cooperation, Zamani raided Ogbe-Ijoh (located 
across the Warri River from Warri) and surrounding Ijaw 
villages.  These villages served as one of the major 
operating areas from which criminal raids upon the city of 
Warri and surrounding Itsekiri villages originated.  Several 
sources say that they are now abandoned and the people are 
homeless, likely doubling the previous known figure of Ijaw 
IDPs to 2,000. 
 
8. (S/NF) As if ethnic conflict in Warri was not enough to 
occupy the JTF, Zamani told Consulate Officers he has 
recently deployed some of his troops to areas around Port 
Harcourt, where there has been widespread gangland warfare 
within the past two months (refs D and E).  Zamani said that 
part of his mandate was to protect oil installations 
throughout the larger Niger Delta area and that his forces 
were now protecting facilities there.  He declined to state 
how many have been sent.  Recent press reports claim that 
military forces had clashed with the gangs, leaving 50 dead 
near Buguma.  Zamani said he was unaware of such reports, 
emphasizing his mandate to protect oil facilities only and 
pointed out that two brigades outside of the JTF were 
stationed in Port Harcourt.

1. Summary. This is the second of a four-part report on 
PolOffs\' visit to four of the five former Alliance for 
Democracy Party (AD) States, that were taken by the Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2003 and 2004 federal, state 
and local elections. (Part 1 at reftel)  After one year under 
new administrations, all four States seem to be making 
progress in delivering critical government services such as 
free education, poverty alleviation and infrastructure 
improvements. 
 
2. (SBU)  Oyo State, with the energetic leadership of 
businessman-turned-Governor Rashid Ladoja, is moving out of 
the doldrums and inactivity of the previous administration. 
Former Oyo Governor, Lam Adesina, while voicing the oft-heard 
list of complaints and gripes about the PDP victories in the 
2003 and 2004 elections, still blustered that the AD is 
poised to make a strong comeback in Oyo in the 2007 election 
cycle.  We doubt it.  End summary. 
 
3. Oyo - \"The Pacesetter State\" 
 
(SBU) Oyo State has existed in some form or other since 
pre-colonial days and was ruled by the traditional Alaafin of 
Oyo.  At independence in 1960, the State became part of the 
now defunct Western State, and in 1991 acquired its current 
borders.  Predominantly ethnic Yoruba, Oyo is also home to a 
minority mix of ethnic tribes from all parts of Nigeria.  Oyo 
is the site of the prestigious and well-attended capital city 
University of Ibadan and the UN-sponsored International 
Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) program.  Since our 
visit last year, the State has made progress maintaining and 
repairing infrastructure such as roads and electricity 
supply.  Local officials readily admitted that the State is 
now more than 60% Muslim, and, as in the other three States 
we visited, our observations indicated a higher percentage. 
The Grand Mosque in Ibadan, with its huge gold dome, 
dominates the city skyline and commands visitors\' attention 
more than any church steeple in the city. 
 
Selfish Americans 
 
4.  (SBU) Governor Rashid Adewolu Ladoja, a chemical engineer 
and successful millionaire businessman, impressed us as 
intelligent, candid and astute in his new career as a 
politician.  He graciously dismissed the elaborate press 
conference he had arranged for our meeting and agreed to a 
private session with only a few of his cabinet in attendance. 
 Ladoja started off the meeting by declaring that the US was 
\"very selfish\" in offering its assistance to Nigeria.  He 
said that Nigeria, being a new democracy, had many domestic 
issues of concern that needed US assistance, but the US was 
interested in furthering only its own goals in the region. 
He mentioned specifically, debt relief for Nigeria and US 
membership in both the Paris and London Clubs.  (Comment. 
PolOff responded to the Governor by pointing out that US 
Mission goals in Nigeria, such as promoting political and 
economic stability, are naturally in our self-interest.  If 
our efforts and assistance produced a safe and secure Nigeria 
where US entities can operate, it was a \"win-win\" outcome for 
both nations.  End comment.) 
 
5.  (SBU) Ladoja turned quickly to local issues, saying that 
the PDP had won in Oyo State because the people of Oyo had 
been \"hoodwinked\" by the AD Party.  The people of Oyo have 
been historically outside the mainstream of Nigerian 
politics, according to the Governor.  They were convinced by 
the AD party that they did not need a federal government, and 
that their own AD/Afenifere/Yoruba politicians could do the 
right thing.  \"The PDP candidates were just better than the 
AD candidates.  AD and Afenifere relaxed and that is why they 
lost.\"  The Governor said he had nothing for the Christians 
in Oyo, and nothing for the Muslims either, but everything 
for the citizens of Oyo.  \"We are defining what government 
should be,\" he said.  His administration is concentrating on 
diversification through agricultural development.  Oyo has 
the largest area of arable land in Nigeria and is heavily 
into the federal government\'s subsidized fertilizer program. 
The State has launched the Oyo State Agricultural 
Re-awakening Programme (AIRPOS) which provides seeds, 
tractors and insecticides to farmers willing to plant corn, 
melons and cassava.  There are plans to revitalize Oyo\'s 
abandoned cocoa plantations, and the State government has 
begun to clear State-owned lands and offer one free acre to 
any cocoa farmer who already owns an acre under cultivation. 
Any university graduates specializing in agriculture will 
receive two acres free upon graduation. 
 
Living in the present; preparing for the future 
 
6.  (SBU) As for the future, the Governor said that Oyo was 
not counting on windfall income from recent increases in the 
revenue from oil production.  \"We will not see anything from 
that for several months,\" he said.  Oyo is concentrating, 
instead, on improving delivery of government services now. 
Ladoja said the State is going ahead with improvements to all 
roads, whether they are federal, state or local, without 
asking the federal government for up-front funding or 
reimbursement.  To accomplish this, the State has bought and 
operates its own asphalt plant.  Oyo has increased the 
delivery of potable water to urban and rural areas by 40%. 
All government printing is done in-house to save money. 
While education is still free at the primary level, the 
Ladoja administration is requiring parents to pay for all 
end-of-term exams.  As for the 2007 elections, Ladoja says, 
\"I have the job of running this State today.  We are not yet 
campaigning -- maybe in October of 2006 we will begin.  We 
are working hard now to show the people that we can do the 
job.  We want your help, but we are realistic.  We know you 
are selfish.\" 
 
The sore loser rationalizes 
 
7.  (SBU) Late in the afternoon, we met with the AD former 
governor of Oyo State, Lam Adesina.  Adesina was upbeat about 
the future of AD in Oyo and voiced the mantra we heard from 
other AD members.  He said AD was \"on the ground in Oyo and 
in firm control.\"  Adesina also voiced some of the same 
complaints of other losers in the 2003 and 2004 elections. 
He charged that the people did not really get a chance to 
choose the government they wanted.  \"The PDP just wrote the 
results they wanted.  We know we won in many of the local 
government areas, but PDP interfered with the elections 
process and threw out the results.\"  Adesina wants the whole 
election mechanism disbanded and reformed.  He wants the 
current registration lists, the system for selecting election 
officials, and the validation of results abandoned and 
replaced by systems not controlled by the majority PDP. 
Adesina said that AD still has enough stalwart members in Oyo 
to field candidates and win in 2007. 
 
8.  (SBU) The recent schism in the AD has been healed 
according to Adesina, and the party still has much support, 
not only in Oyo and the southwest, but nationwide.  He says 
\"nobody likes Governor Ladoja\" and the Governor has to travel 
everywhere with bodyguards because he is afraid of attacks. 
The AD wants to create \"true\" federalism in Nigeria and this 
can only be achieved by calling a Sovereign National 
Conference to rewrite the Constitution that was imposed on 
the people by former military regimes.

ONDO STATES (PART 3 0F 4) 
 
REF: A) LAGOS 1205 B) LAGOS 1203 
 
1. Summary. This is the third of a four-part report on 
ConOffs visit to four of the five  former Alliance for 
Democracy Party (AD) States, that were taken by the Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2003 and 2004 federal, state 
and local elections. (Parts 1 and 2 at reftels B and A) 
After one year under new administrations, all four States 
seem to be making progress in delivering critical government 
services such as free education, poverty alleviation and 
infrastructure improvements.  Osun State, under the measured 
and confident control of retired general, Governor Olunsoye 
Oyinlola, is moving ahead on infrastructure projects after 
six months of planning by State officials and community 
representatives.  The fact that Oyinlola was an official in 
the military regime of the late Sani Abacha still causes his 
actions to be closely scrutinized for abuses and compared to 
the Abacha era.  End summary. 
 
Osun - \"The State of Young Faces\" 
 
2.  (SBU) Osun was carved out of the old Oyo State in 1991; 
thus, like Oyo, its population is almost totally ethnic 
Yoruba.  Osun officials readily admit that the State is about 
50-50 Muslim to Christian.  However, casual observation of 
residents on the street and the ratio of well-maintained 
mosques to, obviously, older and aging churches leads to a 
supposition that Osun may have a much higher percentage of 
Muslims. 
 
3. (SBU)  The major highway into Osun\'s capital, Osogbo, is 
in excellent condition.  Amazingly, along the entire length 
that we traveled, the two-lane highway is being repaired and 
widened to a four-lane highway.  Heavy equipment and road 
crews were at work clearing the road shoulders and laying 
asphalt.  Except for the inevitable traffic jam, this one 
caused by an accident involving two sixteen-wheeler tank 
trucks, and the slowdowns for the ubiquitous police check 
points, our trip to Osogbo was fast and smooth. 
 
The Governor is also a Prince 
 
4.  (SBU) Governor Prince Olunsoye Oyinlola made time for us, 
even though we arrived a half an hour late due to the tanker 
accident.  The waiting room outside the Governor\'s office was 
packed with men carrying briefcases and folders of papers, 
obviously waiting for meetings with the Governor. The 
Governor had a tight schedule, but we were immediately 
ushered into his vast and ornately decorated office on the 
top floor of the State executive office building.  Oyinlola 
had arranged a formal press meeting with prepared welcoming 
statements, photographers and video cameras, assembly members 
(including the lone AD Assemblyman) and an exchange of gifts. 
 PolOff had a chance to speak one-on-one with the Governor 
after the welcoming ceremony.  Oyinlola appeared open and 
friendly, and he answered all our questions as fully as time 
permitted.  He said his administration is concentrating on 
poverty eradication and job creation in Osun.  As in other 
States in the federation, government -- local, State, or 
federal -- is the largest employer.  Oyinlola told us that 
79% of the State budget goes to the 5% of the population who 
are government employees.  There are no US businesses, 
franchises or partnerships operating in Osun, and the 
Oyinlola administration wants US help in changing that 
situation.   The Governor said that Osun is perfect for 
foreign and local investment; i. e. it has no crime or other 
security issues, a good infrastructure, and an educated 
population. 
 
Making progress, but the past still haunts him 
 
5.  (SBU) Osun is another of the non-oil-producing States 
that has turned to revitalization of its agricultural 
industry as a way to cut dependence on oil revenue 
allocations.  The State has purchased 330 new tractors that 
will be sold or leased to farmers.  Oyinlola told us his 
administration has secured government funding to improve the 
supply of potable water in the State, and has funded 
improvements in the delivery of health care services from its 
current federal allocation.  Osun has hired 1,500 additional 
health care workers, purchased 31 new ambulances and is in 
the process of constructing its own pharmaceuticals plant. 
This administration has re-hired 2,500 teachers laid off by 
the previous administration, and raised wages for 18,000 
teachers under a new program called the \"Oyinlola Corps.\" 
The Governor said that all State payments to civil service 
and pensioners are now current. 
 
6.  (SBU) Oyinlola is a retired general and was the former 
military administrator of Lagos State during the rule of the 
late military dictator, Sani Abacha.  He has had to try to 
live down his history, but his critics in Osun point to 
wasteful spending such as purchasing motorcycles and cars for 
political supporters, and taking the entire House of Assembly 
with him to Brazil, the UK and the US to purchase the 
tractors for the agricultural development project.  Oyinlola 
counters that the equipment manufacturers paid for the 
travel.

1. Summary.  This is the last in a four-part report of 
ConOffs visit to four of the five formerly Alliance for 
Democracy Party (AD) States, that were taken by the Peoples 
Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2003 and 2004 federal, state 
and local elections. (Parts 1, 2, and 3 at reftels C, B, and 
A)  After one year under new administrations, all four States 
seem to be making progress in delivering critical government 
services such as free education, poverty alleviation and 
infrastructure improvements. Chief Reuben Fasoranti, acting 
head of the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, 
Afenifere, hinted that his group would be joining with other 
ethnic PDP opposition political groups to work to take back 
control of the south -- and perhaps more -- from the PDP in 
the 2007 elections.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Ondo - \"The Sunshine State\" 
 
The boundaries of Ondo Parish were established in 1915 and 
remained essentially the same when the region became a State 
in February, 1976.  The population is predominantly Yoruba 
and Muslim. 
 
3.  (SBU) It was raining hard when PolOffs entered the Ondo 
capital, Akure.  Though roads are good in Ondo, it is 
considered the most neglected and impoverished of the four 
southwestern States we visited.  Governor Olusegun Agagu\'s 
administration has announced that it is addressing all the 
problems of the State -- supply of reliable electricity and 
potable water, road repairs and maintenance, falling 
educational standards, revitalization of the agricultural 
sector, job creation and poverty eradication.  In addition to 
buying closed or failing manufacturing plants with State 
funds and promising to refurbish them to create jobs, the 
Agagu administration is counting on the Free Trade Export 
Zone project with Ogun State to create \"millions\" of jobs. 
Criticized for being slow to tackle Ondo\'s many problems, 
Agagu spent his first six months in office developing the 
\"Road Map to Progress\" for Ondo in conjunction with 
committees of concerned citizens.  As a result, he said, 
after only six months of effort, it is too soon to judge 
whether he and his administration are doing a good job.  \"We 
have a four-year mandate,\" he declared.  \"We are doing well, 
but ask us how we have done in December 2006!\" 
 
Afenifere plotting new courses 
 
4.  (SBU) PolOffs met with Chief Reuben F. Fasoranti at his 
home in Akure.  Fasoranti is the acting head of Afenifere 
while Pa Abraham Adesanya recuperates from a devastating 
stroke.  (Reftel D)  Fasoranti was not very forthcoming.  He 
repeated the mantra that \"AD and Afenifere are strong and \'on 
the ground\' nationwide. The people are used to us and they 
know what we have done and can still do for them.\"  He 
claimed that Afenifere was responsible for the institution of 
free education in Nigeria, and said that, as a result, many 
current leaders and professionals are beneficiaries of this 
and have influenced the political history of the southwest. 
This shared background engenders loyalty that is not lost in 
one election cycle.  According to Fasoranti, the new PDP 
politicians are just following up on programs proposed and 
pursued by Afenifere and AD, such as building and maintaining 
roads, schools and hospitals, and encouraging agricultural 
development with subsidies, grants, and soft loans.  He says 
that the middle class, especially, benefited from 
AD/Afenifere housing subsidies and university scholarships, 
and that the PDP won in the face of all this AD support, only 
through fraud, cheating, and rigging.  Fasoranti explained 
that neither AD nor Afenifere is challenging any of the 
elections in Ondo because \"the rigging was so perfect that we 
cannot put forward an actionable casus belli to make our 
case.\" 
 
5.  (SBU)  Fasoranti told us there is too much political, 
ethnic and religious violence in Nigeria, and that a 
Sovereign National Conference (SNC) is needed so that all 
parties can be heard and receive equitable treatment under 
national law.  \"We are getting ourselves together.  We do not 
rule out alliances with like-minded groups.\"  (Comment.  a 
few days after our visit, Afenifere joined with Ohaneze, the 
pan-Igbo socio-political groups from the southeast, to demand 
that the federal government convene an SNC immediately.  Vice 
President Atiku Abubaker, seeming to be considering the 
demand, promised an SNC would be convened before the 
elections in 2007.  President Olusegun Obasanjo has firmly 
and repeatedly rejected the need for an SNC, and, even as a 
lame duck, Obasanjo continues to consolidate and wield 
considerable control.  An SNC, even at the last minute before 
the next elections seems unlikely.  End comment.) 
6.  (SBU) Despite all the claims of historic loyalty from the 
southwest, Fasoranti said AD and Afenifere are restructuring 
so that \"people will like us again.\"  Asked about the schism 
in the AD between the \"Abuja faction\" (led by Senator 
Mojisoluwa Akinfenwa) and the \"Lagos faction\" (led by former 
Governor Bisi Akande), Fasoranti put off answering directly 
saying that the parties had until October 16 to come up with 
a solution that would satisfy elections officials.  (Comment. 
 Several AD and Afenifere officials have publicly stated that 
the most likely and acceptable outcome is that both leaders 
will step aside in favor of a third person acceptable to a 
majority of the members.  End comment.)  He went on to say 
that it is too early to say what AD and Afenifere are 
planning for the 2007 elections, or who might emerge as the 
new (and possibly younger) leaders of the groups.  Fasoranti 
ended our short meeting, saying, \"sometimes it is not 
effective nor practical to do what the people want, but we 
will keep trying to find and do what is best for the people.\" 
 
7.  (SBU) Conclusion.  As several of our interlocutors told 
us, it is too early to predict a winner or even a 
front-runner in the southwest in 2007 elections.  After a big 
start at launching many promising programs, new PDP 
governments may run out of steam or money, as their 
predecessors are said to have done.  All we can say is that 
Nigerians are used to being disappointed in their national 
institutions and systems, as shown by their widespread apathy 
in the last elections.  By 2007 then may be fed up with 
unfulfilled promises and tired of waiting for the \"dividends 
of democracy\" and become even more apathetic, or they may be 
re-energized by developments and progress at the State level 
to push for broader reform and action.

Classified By: Joseph Gregoire for reasons 1.4 (b), (d), and (e). 
 
1.  (C) Introduction and summary. This is the second in a 
series of four cables addressing the security, political, and 
humanitarian situations in the Niger Delta, based on a field 
visit by Poloff and Econoff to Warri June 7 and 8. This cable 
addresses the recent cease-fire agreement and the Ijaw and 
Itsekiri ethnic groups\' political demands. Now that they 
have brokered a cease-fire, the youth leaders are moving 
toward the goal of healing and eventually transformation of 
the conflict to final resolution.  Continued USG involvement 
in the area, more robust funding of USG-funded 
non-governmental organizations (NGO) involved in the peace 
talks, and increased humanitarian assistance might go a long 
way toward enabling a more stable environment for peaceful 
resolution of the conflict.  End introduction and summary. 
 
-------------------- 
CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT 
-------------------- 
 
2.  (U) In early May 2004 Ijaw and Itsekiri \"youths\" formed 
the Warri Itsekiri/Ijaw Grassroots Peace Front (WIIGPF) and 
declared a cease-fire on June 1 with respect to fighting that 
broke out in March 2003.  The agreement begins with a quote 
by Abraham Lincoln: \"My greatest concern is not whether you 
have failed, but whether you are content with failure.\"  The 
quote reflects the tone of the document and possibly the mood 
of the Ijaw and Itsekiri youths who wrote it.  They now seem 
to have grown tired of the conflict and its effect on their 
society.  The youth leaders claim to recognize that through 
their actions they have \"depleted human and natural 
resources, relentlessly scared away investments, recklessly 
rendered our people homeless, and have ushered in a period of 
unrest characterized by a rise in crime...\" 
 
3.  (U) In their June 1 agreement, the Ijaw and Itsekiri 
youth leaders referred to the April 23 attack on a Chevron 
Nigeria Limited (CNL) contracting group that resulted in the 
death of five people including two AMCITS (ref A), and called 
on their communities to assist Joint Task Force (JTF) 
Operation Restore Hope in apprehending the perpetrators.  The 
youths asserted that the \"people at the grassroots\" are the 
only ones who can resolve the political differences, and 
stated they have created a \"mechanism\" to address these 
\"differences and restore enduring peace.\" They also 
explicitly warned \"any persons or groups engaged in unlawful 
activities that times have changed and that the rules are 
clear.\"  Regardless of ethnicity, they affirmed, \"the law 
will take its due course.\"  They concluded the document by 
giving credit to Delta State Governor James Ibori and JTF 
Commander BG Elias Zamani for facilitating the agreement, and 
renewed WIIGF\'s resolve to enforce it. 
 
------------------------------------ 
BEHIND THE SCENES: YOUTHS AND ELDERS 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C) The term \"youths\" in the Niger Delta and African 
context can be misleading.  The youths are middle-aged men 
who are leaders of their communities.  They are young only in 
comparison to the elders, the traditional rulers and leaders 
who are a generation or two older.  This socio-cultural 
distinction has influenced handling of the conflict. 
Traditionally, the Ijaw and Itsekiri elders acted as brokers 
for their tribes.  As a group, the elders have tended to 
focus on perceived wrongs dating to the beginning of the 
colonial era in 1890 and have exercised limited control over 
the militant youths.  As the recent conflict raged, the youth 
leaders involved in the ethnic fighting, illegal oil 
bunkering, and attacks on oil installations began to 
dissociate themselves from the elders.  The youth leaders now 
hold sway over their own constituents and appear to be 
bringing the elders into the fold, out of cultural respect 
and political necessity.  Various sources have told us that 
the elders have been effectively cut out of decision making, 
however, which facilitated reaching the cease-fire agreement. 
 
 
5.  (C) Sam Ken (protect), a militant Ijaw youth leader and 
key architect of the cease-fire agreement, told Conoffs that 
the elders are no longer a factor in negotiations.  He 
asserted that the JTF and Delta State Government recognize 
this fact and now work directly with the youths.  Zamani 
(protect) confirmed Ken\'s assertions that the JTF now deals 
only with the youth leaders.  He said bypassing the elders 
facilitated the cease-fire, but in recognition of their 
cultural status he will \"pay attention\" to them and bring 
them along if need be.  One Ijaw chief has voiced displeasure 
with the agreement, but Zamani is confident that he can bring 
him around whereas Ken said he has no choice but to abide by 
the agreement.  Daniel Reyenieju, a militant Itsekiri youth 
leader and co-author of the agreement, told Conoffs that the 
Itsekiri elders were also out of the loop. 
 
------------------------- 
CEASE-FIRE IMPLEMENTATION 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) As stated in the cease-fire agreement, the rules have 
changed and anyone not abiding by the agreement will be 
\"brought to book.\"  Some criminal militant youth leaders who 
failed to abide by the agreement were killed recently (ref 
A). The Ijaw and Itsekiri youth leaders who have endorsed the 
agreement have gotten public opinion behind the cease-fire. 
Through the auspices of the U.S.-based International 
Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH), Ijaw and 
Itsekiri leaders have gone into the creeks with IFESH 
officials to publicize the agreement and bring their 
constituents along in the political process. Zamani told us 
their initiative has been well received. 
 
7.  (U) Numerous Ijaw and Itsekiri youth told Conoffs that 
the NGOs, the Delta State Government, and the JTF peace 
initiatives have been well received and continue to have a 
positive impact on moves to resolve the conflict.  Two NGO 
peace initiatives funded by the USG and focused on conflict 
resolution provide a forum for Ijaw and Itsekiri youths and 
elders to discuss their views.  IFESH\'s peace dialogue has 
evoked the most favorable response from participants.  IFESH 
has also implemented USG- and ChevronTexaco-funded 
humanitarian aid and sustainable development projects in the 
region.  Academic Associates Peace Works (AAPW) also receives 
funding from USAID and DRL (ref B).  AAPW\'s Warri Peace Forum 
was the first of its kind in the region and is credited by 
many people for having created an atmosphere of open 
dialogue.  The impact of these USG-funded NGO and GON peace 
initiatives is clear.  Of the six youth leaders who signed 
the June 1 cease-fire agreement, one leader participated in 
all four peace initiatives, two leaders in three of them, and 
three in two of the initiatives. 
 
----------------- 
POLITICAL DEMANDS 
----------------- 
 
8.  (C) Although a cease-fire has been agreed, addressing the 
political and economic grievances (septel) of the Ijaw and 
Itsekiri that fuel conflict is a bigger hurdle.  The core 
Ijaw grievance is the perceived political disenfranchisement 
in the Warri Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Warri South, 
Warri Southwest, and Warri North.  Ken said the Ijaw are 
mainly concerned with Warri Southwest and North.  (Warri 
South is predominantly Itsekiri and partly inhabited by many 
Itsekiri villagers who fled their homes along the Benin River 
as a result of recent conflict.) Ken said the Ijaw could 
accept an agreement with the Delta State Government to create 
additional wards within the LGAs.  He said the Ijaw could 
accept having fewer wards in Warri North, but insisted that 
Warri Southwest be re-organized so that each ethnic group had 
ten wards where the Ijaw perceive themselves to be more 
populous.  Ken insisted that under this arrangement, the 
chairmanships of Warri North and Warri Southwest would rotate 
between the Ijaw and Itsekiri at each election cycle.  When 
asked by Conoffs if such a practice would be democratic, Ken 
said there were no \"free and fair\" elections in Nigeria, 
making the point moot.  Rotation would be agreed upon at the 
primaries since both ethnic groups are predominantly 
represented by the ruling People\'s Democratic Party. If the 
Ijaw could do what they want, Ken said they would carve an 
additional LGA out of each of the two contested LGAs 
dominated by the Ijaw.  But the gerrymandered creation of new 
LGAs can be done only by the federal government, whereas 
wards can be created by state governments. 
 
9.  (C/NF) Besides creating new wards and gerrymandering 
LGAs, Ken wants development committees instituted in each 
LGA. Ken proposes that such committees receive forty percent 
of the LGA share of the federation account, which is largely 
derived from oil revenues.  The committees would use the 
revenue to develop the Warri LGAs, which, Ken said, have been 
grossly neglected by the Delta State Government and the GON. 
When asked how he might persuade the GON to agree to these 
demands, Ken replied that if the GON did not comply, he could 
create a situation such that the GON would be required to 
declare a state of emergency, as it did recently in Plateau 
State. 
 
10.  (C) Reyenieju, an Itsekiri militant youth leader and 
co-author of the cease-fire agreement, was more pragmatic in 
stating Itsekiri demands to Conoffs.  He said there is a 
continued need to restore and reinforce the rule of law and 
to reaffirm the GON\'s responsibility to maintain security in 
the region.  Aware of competing Ijaw political demands, 
Reyenieju did not express support for the creation of LGAs or 
wards.  Instead, he called for elections reflecting the 
combined will of the people, and said he would accept the 
results, pointing out that the Ijaw had boycotted the last 
federal election and had not registered to vote.  He said 
nothing about development committees or the federation 
account, but underscored the need for the Itsekiri internally 
displaced persons to return to their homes and for donors to 
address the economic plight of the region (septel). 
 
11.  (C/NF) COMMENT. The USG-funded peace iniatives and the 
$50,000 in humanitarian aid provided shortly after the 
beginning of the conflict last year have created much 
goodwill toward the USG among the youth leaders and area 
residents.  However, both the Ijaw and Itsekiri have an 
exaggerated sense of USG influence on the GON, as was evident 
from their plea to Conoffs that the USG press the GON into 
action.  Now, the cease-fire agreement appears to be in 
effect and to be receiving broad support.  The youth leaders, 
especially the Ijaw, have shown they have the political will 
and means to ensure others keep in tow (ref A).  Both the 
Ijaw and Itsekiri leaders seem to be looking at the conflict 
comprehensively, and are implementing principles of conflict 
resolution to cope with it.  Now that they have brokered a 
cease-fire, the youth leaders, particularly with the aid of 
IFESH, are moving toward the goal of healing and eventually 
toward transformation of the conflict to its final 
resolution.  Continued USG involvement in the area, more 
robust funding of IFESH and AAPW, and increased humanitarian 
assistance (septel) might go a long way toward enabling a 
more stable environment for peaceful resolution of the 
conflict.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: INITIATION OF EMBASSY EST&H REPORTING: 
FINDINGS OF THE 2003 DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY; 
FERTILITY, FAMILY PLANNING, HIV/AIDS: PART I OF III 
 
 
1. Introduction.  This report is the first of what will 
become regular reports by the officer responsible for 
environment, science, technology, and health (EST&H) at 
Embassy Abuja.  Pending the assignment in Abuja of such 
an officer, the Mission\'s economic officers, assisted 
by USAID colleagues, will produce the initial reports. 
For the foreseeable future, the thrust will be on 
Nigerian developments relating to the President\'s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Readers should 
expect most of the reports to address the social and 
economic factors that influence the spread of this 
disease. The reports will be geared toward the needs 
and interests of officials within the Office of the 
Global AIDS Coordinator, as well as other interested 
parties within the interagency community.  End 
introduction. 
 
2.  Summary.  The findings below and in the two cables 
that follow are lifted from the executive summary of 
the 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey.  The 
findings provide baseline data that much of our 
subsequent reports will reflect.  This one presents the 
most recent aggregate data on Nigerian fertility, 
family planning, and HIV/AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted infections.  The second report addresses 
women\'s health and social status.  The third centers on 
malaria control, and child health and nutrition.   We 
will follow the evolution of the relevant indicators 
closely, not only because of their importance to 
PEPFAR, but also because of their relationship to the 
Millennium Development Goals.   End summary. 
 
3. The 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2003 
NDHS), published in April 2004, is the third national 
demographic and health survey conducted in Nigeria. The 
2003 NDHS is based on a nationally representative 
sample of over 7,000 households. All women 15-49 years 
of age in these households and all men aged 15-59 in a 
sub-sample of one-third of the households were 
individually interviewed. The survey provides up to 
date information on population and public health in 
Nigeria.  The 2003 NDHS records current information on 
fertility levels and preferences, awareness and use of 
family planning methods, maternal and child health, 
breastfeeding practices, nutritional status of women 
and young children, childhood mortality, use of anti- 
malaria bed nets, female circumcision, marriage, sexual 
activity, and awareness of and behavioral responses to 
AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections in 
Nigeria. 
 
FERTILITY 
 
4. Fertility Levels, Trends, and Preferences.  The 2003 
NDHS established that the total fertility rate (TFR) in 
Nigeria was 5.7 in 2003.  This means that, at current 
fertility levels, the average Nigerian woman who is at 
the beginning of her childbearing years will give birth 
to 5.7 children by the end of her lifetime. (In other 
words, for every 10 Nigerian women who are at the 
beginning of their childbearing years, 57 children will 
be born during the women\'s lifetime. Multiplying the 
birth data below by a factor of 10 will yield whole 
numbers.) Compared with previous national surveys, the 
2003 survey shows a modest decline in fertility over 
the last two decades: from a TFR of 6.3 in the 1981-82 
National Fertility Survey to 6.0 in the 1990 NDHS and 
5.7 in the 2003 NDHS. However, the 2003 NDHS rate of 
5.7 is significantly higher than the 1999 NDHS rate of 
5.2, which underestimated the level of fertility then 
prevailing in Nigeria. 
 
5. The 2003 NDHS shows that, on average, rural women 
will have one more child than will urban women (6.1 and 
4.9, respectively) during their childbearing years. 
Fertility varies considerably by region of residence, 
lower rates being recorded in the south and higher 
rates in the north. Fertility is also strongly 
correlated negatively with a woman\'s educational 
attainment. 
 
6. Most Nigerians, irrespective of their number of 
living children, want large families. The ideal number 
of children was 6.7 for all women and 7.3 for currently 
married women at the time of the survey.  Nigerian men 
want even more children than do women. The ideal number 
of children for all men was 8.6 and for currently 
married men 10.6. Clearly, one reason for the slow 
decline in Nigerian fertility is the desire for large 
families. 
 
7. Birth Intervals. A 36-month interval between 
deliveries is best for mother and child. The median 
birth interval in Nigeria was 31 months in 2003. The 
median interval was lowest among mothers aged 15-19 (26 
months) and highest among mothers 40-49 years of age 
(39 months). While there was no difference in birth 
intervals between urban and rural women, birth 
intervals varied considerably by region of residence. 
Women in the South West have the longest median birth 
interval (37 months) and women in the South East the 
shortest (27 months), a difference of almost one year. 
 
8. Initiation of Sexual Behavior and Childbearing at 
Young Ages. One-third of women between the age of 25-49 
reported they had had sexual intercourse by age 15. By 
age 20 more than three-quarters of women and by age 25 
nine-tenths of them had had sexual intercourse. One- 
quarter of the teenage women surveyed had given birth 
or been pregnant. Early childbearing occurs more often 
in rural areas: 30 percent of rural women aged 15-19 
had begun childbearing compared with 17 percent of 
urban women in the same age group. The median age at 
first birth is nonetheless rising. Whereas median age 
at first birth was less than 19 years among women over 
age 35, it was 20.3 years among women aged 25-29. 
 
FAMILY PLANNING 
 
9. Knowledge of Family Planning Methods. About eight in 
ten women and nine in ten men knew of at least one 
modern method of family planning in 2003. The pill, 
injectable contraceptives, and the male condom are the 
most widely known modern methods among both women and 
men. Mass media is an important source of information 
on family planning. Radio is the most frequent source 
of family planning messages: 40 percent of women and 56 
percent of men said they had heard at least one radio 
message about family planning during the year preceding 
the survey. Conversely, however, more than half of the 
women (56 percent) and 41 percent of the men had not 
been exposed to family planning messages by a mass 
media source. 
 
10. Current Use. Thirteen percent of currently married 
women were using some method of family planning during 
the survey, including 8 percent using a modern method. 
The most common modern methods are the pill, injectable 
contraceptives, and the male condom (used by between 
1.6 and 3.4 percent of all women sexually active). 
Urban women are more than twice as likely as rural 
women to practice contraception (20 percent versus 9 
percent) and its use varies significantly by region. 
Thirty-three percent of married women in the South West 
practiced contraception compared with just 4 percent of 
women in the North East and 5 percent of women in the 
North West. 
 
11. Source of Family Planning Methods. Fifty-eight 
percent of users had obtained their contraceptives from 
private health care providers.  Less than half as many 
had gotten them from the public sector (23 percent). 
The private sector is the most common source for the 
pill (74 percent) and male condoms (59 percent). The 
provision of injectable contraceptives for current 
users was shared equally by the private sector and the 
public sector (8 percent each). 
 
12. Unmet Need for Family Planning. While most women 
want large families, a minority want to limit their 
family size or wait some time before having their next 
birth although they are not using contraceptives. 
Seventeen percent of currently married women were in 
these two categories and had an unmet need for family 
planning. 
 
13. Contact of non-users with family planning providers 
is important for determining whether family planning 
initiatives are effective or not. During the year 
preceding the survey, only 4 percent of non-users 
reported they had been visited by a family planning 
service provider at home; 6 percent of non-users had 
visited a health facility and discussed family planning 
with a provider; and 24 percent of non-users who had 
visited a health facility had not discussed family 
planning. These data indicate missed opportunities for 
increasing family planning acceptance and use. 
 
HIV/AIDS AND OTHER STIs 
 
14. Knowledge. Almost all men (97 percent) and most 
women (86 percent)participating in the survey reported 
they had heard of AIDS. Considerably fewer knew how to 
prevent transmission of the virus; men were better 
informed than women. Sixty-three percent of the men and 
45 percent of the women reported knowing that condom 
use protects against HIV/AIDS. More respondents (six in 
ten women and eight in ten men) reported knowing that 
limiting the number of sexual partners may prevent 
HIV/AIDS. Less than half of the sample population knew 
that mother to child transmission of HIV is possible 
through breastfeeding. Fewer people (less than one in 
ten) knew that a woman living with HIV can take drugs 
during pregnancy to reduce the risk of transmission. 
 
15. HIV Testing and Counseling. Six percent of the 
women and 14 percent of the men had been tested for HIV 
and received the results of their test. During the 12 
months preceding the survey, only 3 percent of the 
women and 6 percent of the men had been tested and 
received test results. About 25 percent of the women 
had received counseling or information about HIV/AIDS 
during an pre-natal care visit. 
 
16. High-risk Sex. A much higher percentage of men than 
women reported having had sex with a non-marital, non- 
cohabiting partner during the year preceding the survey 
(39 percent of the men versus 14 percent of the women). 
Less than half of the former (47 percent) and less than 
one-quarter of the latter (23 percent) reported having 
used a condom the last time they had had sex with a non- 
marital, non-cohabiting partner. Fifteen percent of the 
men who were then married or cohabiting reported having 
had high-risk sex in the prior 12 months. 
 
17. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI). Five percent 
of both men and women reported having had a sexually 
transmitted infection or an associated symptom during 
the 12 months preceding the survey. The never-married 
population of both men and women were most at risk. 
Eight percent of never-married women and 7 percent of 
never-married men reported having had an STI or STI 
symptom. Of these, 68 percent of the women and 83 
percent of the men had sought treatment for their STI 
or STI symptom; however, not everyone had gone to a 
health professional.

SUBJECT: FINDINGS OF THE 2003 DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH 
SURVEY, WOMEN\'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL STATUS: PART II OF 
III 
 
REF: LAGOS 1247 
 
1. Summary. The findings below on women\'s health and 
their social status are from the executive summary of 
the 2003 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. The 
nutritional status of Nigerian women falls within the 
internationally accepted normal range. The total 
fertility rate is 5.7 children, high even by African 
standards, and use of modern family planning methods is 
low, only 8 percent for married women. Most births 
occur at home in Nigeria, but most mothers receive pre- 
natal care at least once during pregnancy. Although one- 
fifth of Nigerian women are circumcised, the practice 
is declining. Most working women decide alone what to 
do with their earnings; generally, however, women 
continue to be dominated by men in Nigeria, 
particularly regarding family decisions, and continue 
to be subject to beatings by husbands. End summary. 
 
WOMEN\'S HEALTH 
 
2. Nutritional Status of Women. The mean body mass 
index (BMI) of Nigerian women at the time of the survey 
was 22.3, which falls well within the internationally 
accepted normal range (between 18.5 and 24.9). Almost 
two-thirds of the women (64 percent) in the sample 
population had BMIs falling in the normal range; 15 
percent were thin, including 2 percent severely thin. 
The youngest women were the most likely to be thin. 
One-quarter of the women 15-19 years of age had a BMI 
of less than 18.5. One-fifth of the Nigerian women 
weighed more than they should have: 15 percent were 
overweight and 6 percent obese. 
 
3. Maternal Care. Almost two-thirds of mothers in 
Nigeria (63 percent) had received antenatal care (ANC) 
for their most recent live birth in the five years 
preceding the survey. One-fifth of mothers (21 percent) 
had received ANC from doctors; almost four in ten of 
the women had received care from nurses or midwives (37 
percent). Almost half the women (47 percent) had made 
the minimum number of four recommended visits, but most 
of the women who had received antenatal care had not 
gotten care within the first three months of pregnancy. 
Slightly more than half of the women who received 
antenatal care said they had been informed of potential 
pregnancy complications (55 percent). Fifty-eight 
percent of the women had received iron tablets; almost 
two-thirds had had urine or blood samples taken; and 81 
percent had had their blood pressure measured. Almost 
half (47 percent) of the women had not received tetanus 
toxoid injections during their most recent birth. 
 
4. Most births in Nigeria occur at home (66 percent). 
Only one-third of the live births during the five years 
preceding the survey occurred in a health facility. 
Slightly more than one-third of the births were 
attended by doctors, nurses, or midwives. A smaller 
proportion of women had received postnatal care. Only 
23 percent of the women who gave birth outside a health 
facility had received postnatal care within two days of 
the birth of their last child. More than seven in ten 
women who delivered outside a health facility had 
received no postnatal care at all. 
 
5. All the data on maternal care showed that rural 
women are disadvantaged compared to urban women, and 
there are marked regional differences among women. 
Women in the south, particularly the South East and the 
South West, received better care than women in the 
north, especially women in the North East and North 
West. 
 
6. Female Circumcision. Almost one-fifth of Nigerian 
women are circumcised, but the practice is declining. 
The oldest women are more than twice as likely as the 
youngest women to have been circumcised (28 percent 
versus 13 percent). This practice is most widespread 
among the Yoruba (61 percent) and Igbo (45 percent), 
who traditionally reside in the South West and South 
East. Half of the circumcised respondents could not 
identify the type of procedure that had been performed. 
Among the women who identified the procedure, the most 
common involved cutting and removal of flesh (44 
percent of all circumcised women). Four percent of the 
women reported they had undergone infibulation. 
 
7. Among the 53 percent of Nigerian women who had heard 
of female circumcision, two-thirds (66 percent) 
believed that it should be discontinued, while 21 
percent wanted the practice to continue. Less than half 
of circumcised women wanted the practice continued (42 
percent). Continuation finds greater support among 
southerners than northerners and among those who are 
circumcised than the uncircumcised. Among men who had 
heard of the practice, almost two-thirds were against 
continuation of female circumcision, while about one- 
fifth favored it. 
 
8. Perceived Constraints to Use of Health Care. Almost 
half of the women in the survey cited at least one 
barrier to their accessing health care services. The 
most commonly cited problem was getting money for 
treatment (30 percent), followed by distance to a 
health facility, and having transport (24 percent 
each). One in ten women said getting permission to 
access such services was a problem. 
 
WOMEN\'S CHARACTERISTICS AND STATUS 
9. While most Nigerian women have had some education, 
42 percent have never attended school. This is almost 
twice the percentage of men who have never attended 
school (22 percent). 
 
10. Slightly over half of the women respondents 
reported being employed (56 percent) during the time of 
the survey. Eighty-four percent of working women had 
earned cash only or cash in addition to in-kind 
earnings. Almost three-quarters of the women who had 
received cash earnings reported that they alone had 
decided how their earnings had been used. Another 16 
percent said they had decided jointly with their 
husbands or someone else. Only 10 percent of the women 
reported that someone else had decided how their 
earnings would be used. 
 
11. The 2003 NDHS recorded information on women\'s role 
in different types of decisions in the household. 
Almost half (46 percent) of the married women 
participating in the survey reported they did not have 
final say (either singly or jointly) in any decision. 
Among the married couples, the husbands dominated 
household decision-making. 
 
12. The respondents were asked whether husbands can 
justifiably beat their wives for specific reasons. Most 
men and women (about six in ten) believed there are 
occasions when a man is justified beating his wife. 
About half the women respondents believed that husbands 
can rightly beat their wives if the latter leave the 
home without telling their husbands or if the wives 
neglect the children. These were also the most common 
justifications cited by men (50 percent and 47 percent, 
respectively).

SUBJECT: REVIVING THE NIGERIAN RAILWAY SYSTEM 
 
1. (U) Summary: Odu\'a Investment and Lemna 
Incorporated, a U.S. firm, recently signed a memorandum 
of understanding (MOU) to build a $361 million light 
rail system.  Opponents have charged that the MOU 
violates the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) Act 
1955. Its proponents seek to amend the law to ensure 
private development of the rail system, given the 
moribund condition of the state-owned NRC. Should the 
law be amended, rail transport could attract huge 
investments, as did the telecoms sector. End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Odu\'a and Lemna Inc. Sign Memorandum of Understanding 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. (U) Odu\'a Investment, a Nigerian conglomerate owned 
by the five southwestern states, recently signed a 
project memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Lemna 
Incorporated, an American firm.  The project aims to 
restore rail transportation between Lagos and Ibadan by 
2006, at a cost of $361 million (N48.7 billion). 
According to Remi Omotosho of Odu\'a, during peak hours 
the `Lifeway light rail\' project could move 36,000 
passengers an hour both ways, following establishment 
of connections at Abeokuta and Sagamu, both in Ogun 
State. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Exclusive Legislation Invalidates MOU 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) The Odu\'a-Lemna MOU endorsed by the governments 
of Lagos, Oyo and Ogun States, is being contested. Its 
opponents charge that it is invalidated by the Nigerian 
Railway Corporation (NRC) Act of 1955, which restricts 
the construction or extension of railway lines to the 
state-owned NRC. The Act vests authority `for 
observance of specific and uniform standards in the 
operation of railways\' in the NRC, and has been the 
source of the Corporation\'s monopoly status. A 
provision of the Act nevertheless permits the Transport 
Minister to give consent to `persons other than the 
Corporation to construct or operate a railway within 
Nigeria\'. This provision was basis of the ongoing 
construction of the Ovwian/Aladja-Ajaokuta railway at 
the Ajaokuta Steel complex. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Stakeholders Resolve to Review the Act 
-------------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) Omotosho claims that the process of amending or 
repealing the law will begin in July following a 
stakeholders\' conference.  Whether such action will 
occur is arguable. A. Abubakar, NRC Managing Director, 
suggested it may not since, he said, Odu\'a had not 
consulted the Corporation before the MOU was signed or 
officially sought the Ministry of Transport\'s consent. 
According to Abubakar, the NRC has forwarded a bill to 
Obasanjo to create a Nigerian Railway Commission in 
order to regulate the rail transport sub-sector. He 
said the bill, which may be sent to the National 
Assembly soon, would, if enacted, lay the groundwork 
for an imitation of the GON\'s feat in the telecoms 
sector, as private operators would provide the bulk of 
rail transportation. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (U) The time is right for the NRC\'s monopoly to be 
broken, given its moribund state. The Corporation has 
less than 4,000 km of narrow gauge tracks and a large 
fleet of obsolete engines and haulage carriages.  The 
NRC\'s upgrade would require billions of dollars to be 
fully operational, making it unattractive to 
prospective investors. But the GON\'s political will to 
privatize the railway sub-sector may have weakened, 
given the failure of Chinese and Indian management 
teams at the NRC to turn the corporation around.  The 
Canadian Consultancy that replaced them does not appear 
to have had more success. Besides, much of Nigeria\'s 
freight is transported by trucks and trailers, some of 
which are owned by political allies of the ruling 
political party; these transporters can be expected to 
oppose anything that might mean losing market share to 
an efficient rail system. The light rail project might 
nonetheless be the best means to turn the sector around 
were the NRC to become a regulator. In that event, rail 
transport could attract huge investments, as did the 
telecoms sector these last three years. End comment.

SUBJECT: CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT AT NATIONAL HOSPITAL, 
ABUJA: RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
 
 
1. Summary. In early May 2004, President Obasanjo 
canceled the contract of the expatriate management team 
of the National Hospital of Abuja, a year before it was 
to be up for review.  The British managers had been 
facing discontented staff, equipment breaking down, and 
the envy of Nigerian professionals who believe they are 
as qualified as were the expatriates to run the 
hospital. To do this well, the interim management team 
will have to liquidate substantial salary arrears and 
ensure repair and maintenance of key equipment. 
Commissioned in 1999, the hospital had state-of-the art 
equipment that risks falling into disrepair unless the 
new team effects a quick turnaround. The time may be 
right for U.S. firms like Adams & Associates to take up 
the challenge. End summary. 
 
2.  In April 2004, Obasanjo dissolved the governing 
board of the National Hospital, Abuja and replaced it 
with an interim management committee.  He also 
terminated the GON\'s management services agreement with 
International Hospitals Group Limited, a British firm, 
at that time.  Obasanjo\'s action may have been 
motivated in part by longstanding unresolved labor 
issues at the hospital. According a Daily Times report 
of October 3, 2003, the hospital staff was then owed 34 
months salary arrears.  By then, IHG had been managing 
the National Hospital about a year; that is, since 
November 2002 based on a contract signed in February 
2002. Perhaps these arrears should not be attributed 
solely to the IHG, however. The Daily Times further 
reported that while the Presidency had released funds 
to cover 17 of the 34 months in arrears, the Hospital 
had, as of October 2003, not confirmed receipt of such 
funds. 
 
3.  Whether such funds were ever disbursed is 
questionable.  It is possible that the GON withheld 
these funds from the National Hospital on the grounds 
that its contract with IHG was generous enough for the 
latter to cover the hospital\'s personnel costs.  An 
article that appeared in ThisDay, a leading Nigerian 
daily newspaper, in late 2002 or 2003 asserted that IHG 
was to receive $6.55 million annually over a ten-year 
period.  The award of the contract had provoked the ire 
of a former speaker of the Federal House of 
Representatives, Ghali Umar Na\'Abba.  At his 
instigation, the Special Project Committee of the House 
had issued a report concluding that \"for reasons of 
cost., availability of Nigerian doctors and personnel 
here and abroad to do this job, national security and 
pride, stemming the brain-drain, etc., the [Special 
Project Committee] advised that the management contract 
option be given another thought if not entirely put 
away.\" 
 
4.  Critics of the contract had alleged that that the 
British firm lacked experience and the capability to 
handle the project. Obasanjo replied that \"the 
selection process [had] adopted international bidding 
standards through transparent and competitive 
tendering.\"  The President had further noted that 
unlike other bidders for the contract, IHG\'s proposed 
professional fee had been among the lowest and IHG had 
submitted audited accounts of its operations covering 
the preceding six years. More important, IHG had been 
the only bidder offering to invest in the National 
Hospital. While more than a year ago Na\'Abba had 
asserted that staff morale had plummeted following the 
news of the proposed privatization of the hospital, as 
recently as May 11, 2004 the Daily Trust claimed that a 
South African firm was then negotiating to buy the 
hospital. 
 
5. Whether the change in management at National 
Hospital, Abuja is a sign that privatization is moving 
along is arguable. The communiqu issued at the end of 
the annual general conference of the Nigerian Medical 
Association on May 2, 2004 at Kwara Hotels, Ilorin 
gives cause for concern.  The communiqu noted that 
\"the association commends the Federal Government for 
terminating its contract with the IHG Management 
Consultants hitherto engaged to manage the National 
Hospital and bringing back on board Nigerians to manage 
the hospital.  The Association sees this as a positive 
development, as it has always affirmed its firm belief 
in the ability of Nigerian doctors to manage the 
Nation\'s hospitals.  The Association hopes that the 
newly engaged indigenous managers will be given the 
utmost assistance and free hand in their efforts to 
reposition the National Hospital.\" 
 
6. Plans for the establishment of the National 
Hospital, Abuja, had been on the drawing board a long 
time.  Former Nigerian president Shehu Shagari first 
suggested the project on September 23, 1981.  His plan 
was derailed until the mid nineties when the wife of 
the former dictator Sonny Abacha declared in Beijing in 
1996 that his government would soon build was then to 
become the National Hospital for Women and Children. 
The hospital was commissioned in May 1999 by the 
military chief of state General Abdulsalami Abubakar. 
A year later, President Obasanjo approved its change of 
name to National Hospital, Abuja, to confirm its access 
to male and female patients. 
 
7.  Comment.  The performance of the management teams 
of the National Hospital, Abuja has been less than 
stellar since its opening five years ago.  The politics 
of labor may have prevented IHG from performing as well 
as it might have under a less politicized clime.  The 
risk is great that the interim Nigerian managers will 
do no better. The Daily Trust report of May 11 suggest, 
however, that the GON may be prepared to weather the 
storm.  If that report is correct, Obasanjo\'s 
termination of the contract with IHG may have provided 
an opportunity for a firm like Adams and Associates of 
Cambridge to manage or invest in the National Hospital, 
Abuja. This U.S. company is working with EX-IM Bank on 
other public health projects in Nigeria and might be 
prepared to take up this challenge.

USDOL FOR ROBERT YOUNG 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ELAB, KDEM, PGOV, ECON, NI 
SUBJECT: GON INTENT TO ABOLISH NATIONAL LABOR CONGRESS 
 
 
1. Summary. President Obasanjo\'s government seems to be 
pursuing efforts to persuade the national assembly to 
disband the Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC).  The 
Government of Nigeria  (GON) asserts that it wants to 
liberalize Nigeria\'s labor movement.  The NLC believes 
the GON\'s move is vindictive and designed to weaken the 
only active opposition to GON rule.  The Senate is 
split along party lines on the matter.  End summary. 
 
2. For the second time in five months, President 
Olusegun Obasanjo may soon present a bill to the 
national assembly seeking to amend the Nigerian Trade 
Unions Act.  This bill, like the previous one, would 
put an end to the Nigerian Labor Congress as the only 
central labor organization in Nigeria.  The bill also 
aims to codify the process and procedures through which 
labor organizations may declare strikes. 
 
3. Among other things, the bill proposes liberalization 
of the Nigeria labor movement via registration of 
multiple labor unions that would replace the NLC. The 
bill would require trade unions wishing to declare a 
nation wide strike to secure the prior approval of at 
least two-thirds of its members.  Now, the NLC\'s 
central committee decides such matters. 
 
4. The GON claims the bill is justified since its 
enactment would ensure compliance with the 
International Labor Organization\'s (ILO) requirement 
that labor confederations be democratically organized. 
The GON further claims that the bill would promote 
democratization of labor and thus strengthen it, as 
well as allow workers to choose to become members of a 
labor organization of their own choice, in keeping with 
the spirit of the constitution. 
 
5. The NLC thinks otherwise. Its Deputy President, 
Joseph Akinlaja, told the media that the bill springs 
from the federal government\'s vindictiveness rather 
than a commitment or concern for the labor movement. 
\"If we want multiple labor centers, it will be the 
decision of the workers rather than by any law of the 
federal government\", Akinlaja said.  He suggested it is 
not a coincidence that the GON revived the idea of 
presenting such a bill to the national assembly barely 
a week after the NLC led a nation-wide strike 
protesting GON-approved fuel price increases. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. The general belief in labor circles is that the 
GON\'s sole aim is suppressing labor and silencing 
voices of dissent as witnessed during the last three 
industrial actions embarked upon by the NLC. We have 
not seen the latest version, but recall that the 
previous one sought to permit the existence of multiple 
labor federations.  No doubt, such action would weaken 
the NLC\'s power and influence as the sole labor 
federation recognized by law. The bill that circulated 
late last year stipulated that trade unions no longer 
had to be affiliated to a central labor organization in 
Nigeria. 
 
7. Last year\'s bill had also sought to outlaw strikes 
not approved by two-thirds of the members of a labor 
union. The bill stipulated that \'no trade union or 
registered federation of trade unions by whatever name 
called, shall embark on an industrial action unless 
upon a resolution approving the strike action, passed 
by at least two thirds majority of delegates 
representing all the members of the union or federation 
of trade unions in secret ballot at a meeting for that 
purpose.\' 
 
8. Another section of the previous bill indicated that 
a government official (the Registrar) \"shall remove 
from the register the Nigeria Labor Congress as the 
only central labor organization,\" while another section 
stipulated that two or more trade unions, irrespective 
of their trade, occupation, or industry, could jointly 
form a federation of trade unions. 
 
9. Not all labor leaders are apt to be unhappy about 
reviving the proposed bill.  The rival Trade Union 
Congress, an association of senior employees who are 
not allowed by law to affiliate with the NLC, had 
supported aspects of the labor bill last year. TUC Head 
of Administration, Dan Uhumangho, had then told our 
political specialist that the TUC supported the removal 
of all relevant sections of the bill that recognized 
the NLC as the sole labor federation in Nigeria.   He 
said the TUC believed that every player in the labor 
sector should be allowed to have a say on any issue 
that affects it, since the NLC merely represents its 
own constituency and has no right to speak for others. 
Uhumangho had further said that the TUC supports 
creation of multiple labor centers, saying this is in 
line with democratic principles and the ILO\'s 
convention on freedom of association. 
10. On the other hand, Uhumangho had said the TUC did 
not support the aspects of the bill that seek to 
discontinue automatic dues check-off for union members. 
He had said that if check-off dues, which remain the 
major source of union funding, were rescinded, the 
unions would have cause to seek funding from outside 
sources that the GON might consider inimical to 
Nigeria\'s national interests. Uhumangho had added that 
the TUC also opposed withdrawal of a trade union\'s 
right to engage in industrial action. 
 
11. It is not clear how the new bill will play out in 
the national assembly. The senate is split along party 
lines on the matter.  Several senators of the ruling 
party, the People\'s Democratic Party (PDP), hailed the 
bill, saying it is democratic in that it gives workers 
freedom to decide to what group they may belong. But an 
Alliance for Democracy senator has claimed that the PDP 
aims to impose a dictatorship. According to the 
senator, the bill \"violates the basic constitutional 
liberties of freedom of association and expression of 
ideas\". Most senators, however, believe the fate of the 
proposed bill will depend on views to be articulated at 
a public hearing soon to be organized. 
 
12. What is clear is that even if the ILO has 
consistently advocated the existence of multiple labor 
federations in a country as a means of guaranteeing 
freedom of association, this fact does not, in and of 
itself, fully explain the GON\'s latest move. The likely 
re-introduction of the bill and its prospective impact 
on the NLC are indications that the GON is pursuing 
this measure to weaken organized labor\'s resistance to 
its unpopular policies.

SUBJECT: FINDINGS OF THE 2003 DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH 
SURVEY; MALARIA, CHILD HEALTH, NUTRITION: PART III OF 
III 
 
REF: (A) LAGOS 1247, (B) LAGOS 1268 
 
1.  Summary.  The findings below were drawn from the 
executive summary of the 2003 Nigeria Demographic and 
Health Survey. Malaria remains a major public health 
problem in Nigeria.  Infant mortality is worse than 
what may have been commonly believed. Most children are 
under-weight or stunted, especially in northern 
Nigeria. The rate of vaccination of children in Nigeria 
is the lowest among African countries in which DHS 
surveys have been conducted since 1998. The PEPFAR- 
related program we will pursue in Nigeria calls for 
complex interagency coordination; we want to begin 
doing this without delay.  We thus seek S/GAC\'s 
assistance in identifying a seasoned mid-level officer 
available now to press forward.  End summary. 
 
MALARIA CONTROL 
 
2.  Nets. Although malaria is a major public health 
concern in Nigeria, only 12 percent of households 
reported owning at least one mosquito net at the time 
of the survey. Even fewer, 2 percent of households, 
owned an insecticide treated net (ITN). Rural 
households were almost three times as likely as urban 
households to own at least one mosquito net. Overall, 6 
percent of children below five years of age had slept 
under a mosquito net including 1 percent of children 
under an ITN. Five percent of pregnant women had slept 
under a mosquito net the night before the survey, one- 
fifth of them under an ITN. 
 
3. Use of Anti-malarial Drugs Among Pregnant Women. 
Overall, 20 percent reported having taken an anti- 
malarial drug for prevention of malaria during their 
last pregnancy in the five years preceding the survey. 
Seventeen percent reported having used an unknown drug, 
and 4 percent had taken paracetamol or herbs to prevent 
malaria. Only 1 percent had received intermittent 
preventative treatment (IPT) or preventive treatment 
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar/SP) during an 
antenatal care visit. Among pregnant women who had 
taken an anti-malarial drug, more than half (58 
percent) had used Daraprim, which has been found to be 
ineffective as a chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy. 
Thirty-nine percent had taken chloroquine, the 
chemoprophylactic drug of choice until the introduction 
of IPT in Nigeria in 2001. 
 
4. Among children who had been sick and had fever or 
convulsions, one-third had been given anti-malarial 
drugs. Most had received the drugs at the onset of the 
fever/convulsions or the following day. 
 
CHILD HEALTH 
 
5. Mortality. On the basis of the 2003 NDHS survey, 
infant mortality is estimated to be 10 per 1,000 live 
births for the 1999-2003 period. This rate is 
significantly higher than the estimates from both the 
1990 and 1999 NDHS surveys.  The earlier surveys 
underestimated mortality levels in certain regions of 
the country, which in turn biased the national 
estimates downward. The higher rate recorded in 2003 is 
more likely due to better data than an actual increase 
in overall mortality risk. 
 
6. The rural infant mortality rate (121 per 1,000) was 
considerably higher in 2003 than the urban rate (81 per 
1,000), in large part because of the difference in 
neonatal mortality rates. As in other countries, low 
maternal education, the low position of mothers on the 
household wealth index, and shorter birth intervals are 
strongly associated with increased mortality risk. The 
under-five mortality rate for the 1999-2003 period was 
201 per 1,000. 
 
7. Vaccinations. Only 13 percent of Nigerian children 
between 12 and 23 months of age could be considered 
fully vaccinated at the time of the survey; that is, 
they had received BCG, measles, and three doses each of 
DPT and polio vaccine (excluding the polio vaccine 
given at birth). This is the lowest rate of vaccination 
among African countries in which DHS surveys have been 
conducted since 1998. Less than half of the children in 
the survey had received each of the recommended 
vaccinations, except polio 1 (67 percent) and polio 2 
(52 percent). More than three times as many urban 
children as rural children were fully vaccinated (25 
percent and 7 percent, respectively). WH0 guidelines 
are that children should be administered all the 
recommended vaccinations by 12 months of age. In 
Nigeria, only 11 percent of children between the age of 
12-23 months received all the recommended vaccinations 
before their first birthday. 
 
8. Childhood Illness. In the two weeks preceding the 
survey, 10 percent of the children had experienced 
symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and 31 
percent had had a fever. Among the children who 
experienced symptoms of ARI or fever, almost one-third 
(31 percent) had sought treatment at a health facility 
or from health care provider. 
 
9. About one-fifth of children had had diarrhea in the 
two weeks preceding the survey. Twenty-two percent of 
the mothers reported that their children with diarrhea 
had been taken to a health provider. Overall, 40 
percent had received oral rehydration salts (ORS), 
recommended home fluids, or increased fluids. Less than 
one-fifth of the children (18 percent) had been given 
an ORS solution despite 65 percent of the mothers 
having said they knew about ORS packets. While 20 
percent of the mothers said they had given their sick 
children more liquids than usual, 38 percent of mothers 
said they had curtailed fluid intake. 
 
NUTRITION 
 
10. Breast-feeding. Breast-feeding is almost universal 
in Nigeria.  Ninety-seven percent of children born in 
the five years preceding the survey had been breast- 
fed. Just one-third of the children had been given 
breast milk within one hour of birth (32 percent). Less 
than two-thirds had been given breast milk within 24 
hours of birth (63 percent). Overall, the median 
duration of any breast-feeding is 18.6 months, but the 
median duration of exclusive breast-feeding was only 
half a month. 
 
11. Complementary Feeding. Three-quarters of breast- 
feeding infants between 6-9 months of age-the 
recommended age for introducing complementary foods-had 
received solid or semi-solid foods during the day or 
night preceding the survey. Fifty-six percent had been 
given food made from grain; 25 percent received meat, 
fish, shellfish, poultry or eggs; and 24 percent fruits 
or vegetables. Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin A 
had been consumed by 20 percent of the breast-feeding 
infants 6-9 months of age. 
 
12. Nutritional Status of Children. Overall, 38 percent 
of the children participating in the survey were 
stunted (short for their age), 9 percent were wasted or 
thin (low weight-for-height), and 29 percent were under- 
weight (low weight-for-age). Generally, children living 
in rural areas or in the north and children of 
uneducated mothers were significantly more likely to be 
undernourished than other children. The children in the 
North West were particularly disadvantaged: one-third 
were severely stunted, which reflects extensive long- 
term malnutrition in the region. 
 
ORPHANS 
 
13. Less than 1 percent of children nationwide had lost 
both parents by the time of the survey. Six percent of 
children under age 15 had lost at least one parent. 
 
COMMENT 
 
14.  The HIV/AIDS findings in Part I (ref A) of our 
three-part report on the 2003 Nigeria Demographic and 
Health Survey provide baseline figures against which we 
will judge our performance as we implement PEPFAR with 
our Nigerian hosts. During the next six months, we will 
set up an in-country interagency mechanism through 
which to coordinate U.S. and Nigerian HIV/AIDS programs 
so that the result of our collective effort will be 
more encouraging than that which would be the case if 
the interested parties were to work separately. We will 
need time. Ambassador Tobias, himself, noted in his 
February 23, 2004 letter introducing PEPFAR to the 
members on Capitol Hill, that \"addressing HIV/AIDS in 
the developing world requires confronting overstressed 
and struggling health care systems with limited 
capacity to provide treatment and care; social 
inequalities such as those involving the status of 
women, girls, and the poor; and the varied economic and 
political circumstances (as well as diverse and deeply 
ingrained cultural patterns) as of each country.\"  We 
will monitor closely and report regularly on the 
evolution of the indicators reflecting these elements 
during the next year.  We will do so to help channel 
substantial resources and rapidly expand the delivery 
of HIV/AIDS services to effective partners committed to 
the principles of the Emergency Plan. 
 
15.  Shortly, we will send to HR and AF a position 
description statement for the person whom we hope will 
soon arrive at post to focus full time on the PEPFAR 
and related programs. We would welcome the engagement 
of the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (S/GAC) in 
an active dialogue with our colleagues in HR to 
identify a seasoned mid-level officer who is now or 
will soon be available to fill the position. We would 
also appreciate being sent a current listing of S/GAC 
personnel with whom to work on the program components 
of PEPFAR\'s implementation in Nigeria.

SUBJECT: Privatization of the Central Mint? 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The GON plans to divest itself of 
Nigeria\'s Mint.  But, with the Central Bank of Nigeria 
vying to buy the majority stake, the privatization of 
the nation\'s official printer is in question.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) The media have reported that Nigeria\'s 
government wants to get out of the secure printing 
business. In line with GON\'s initiatives to help get 
the country\'s economy on track, the Bureau of Public 
Enterprises (BPE) has recommended that the Nigerian 
Security Printing and Minting Company (the Mint) be 
privatized and that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) sell 
off its 55 percent share.  According to a Mint 
official, Don Etim, the Nigerian national printer of 
paper bills and other secure paper is also 20 percent 
owned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and 25 
percent by a technical partner, De La Rue Company (De 
La Rue) of the UK. 
 
3. (U)  Etim told Econoff June 29 that the MOF\'s 55 
percent equity is much coveted by both the CBN and De 
La Rue.  As the Mint looks to a greater commercializing 
of its services, it hopes to bid on profitable national 
and regional secure paper jobs, such as money and 
passport printing.  Etim said the Mint has positioned 
itself for success by producing products with high- 
quality printing equipment from the German company, 
Heidelberger Druckmaschinen; using of secure paper 
products from the renowned US company, Crane & Co.; as 
well as money counting equipment from US-based Currency 
Systems International, now a part of De La Rue. 
 
4.  (U) Were the government to endorse the sale of 
MOF\'s 55 percent share in the Central Mint, De La Rue 
might nonetheless have trouble acquiring it. Through 
its technological support to the firm, De La Rue holds 
a subscription warrant entitling it to 25 percent 
ownership of the Mint.  But De La Rue has yet to pay 
money for its share of the Central Mint. According to 
Etim, the BPE would require full payment of De La Rue\'s 
25 percent share before it might be eligible to buy the 
MOF\'s 55 percent stake. 
 
5. (U) Comment: The other shareholder, the CBN, would 
own a 75 percent stake in the Central Mint were the CBN 
to pick up MOF\'s 55 percent equity.  The question would 
then be, is this really privatization?  Would this not 
be seen as a power play by the CBN to be both overseer 
and operator of the nation\'s money printing facility? 
If such were the outcome, it could be argued that the 
BPE would have failed in efforts to privatize the Mint. 
End Comment.

SUBJECT: HIV/AIDS FINDINGS OF NIGERIA\'S 2003 
DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH SURVEY 
 
REF: LAGOS 1247 
 
1. Summary: The findings below are from the 2003 
Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and expand 
on the findings presented in reftel. Knowledge of AIDS 
in Nigeria is fairly widespread, but knowledge of 
prevention is less so. Knowledge, attitudes, and 
practices related to prevention and control of HIV/AIDS 
and care of people living with the virus vary 
considerably by age group, region, and education level. 
These findings can be used to target programs and 
tailor messages on HIV/AIDS. End summary. 
 
Overall Impact 
 
2. The first case of HIV infection in Nigeria was 
recorded in 1986 and rates of infection have increased. 
Estimates of HIV prevalence rose from 1.8 percent in 
1991 to 4.5 percent in 1996, and the 2001 National 
HIV/Syphilis Sentinel Survey estimated a national HIV 
sero-prevalence rate of 5.8 percent.  Regional 
prevalence rates varied significantly, from a high of 
7.7 percent in the South South to a low of 3.3 percent 
in the North West.  The greatest actual concern is 
projected mortality due to AIDS over the next few years 
and its socio-economic consequences. Projections of 
annual deaths caused by AIDS in Nigeria have increased 
from fewer than 50,000 in 1999 to about 350,000 in 2003- 
2004.  The number of Nigerian children who are likely 
to lose one or both parents to AIDS is projected to be 
near 2 million in 2003-2004.  The magnitude of the 
problem has prompted the Government of Nigeria to 
review its national HIV/AIDS policy. 
 
Knowledge of Prevention Methods 
 
3. More men than women overall know about condom use 
and limiting partners as ways to avoid AIDS, but the 
pattern of knowledge by background characteristics are 
similar for men and women. By age group, the youngest 
and oldest men and women in the survey (ages 15-19 and 
40-49) are least likely to know about these specific 
ways to avoid HIV transmission. The low knowledge rates 
among the youngest group (37 percent for women and 52 
percent for men) are important to note because sexual 
activity often begins before age 20. 
 
4. Knowledge of prevention methods varies widely by 
education level. Knowledge of condom use to avoid AIDS 
ranges from 33 percent among women with no education to 
74 percent among women with higher education. For men, 
the rate ranges from 45 percent among those with no 
education to 81 percent among those with higher 
education. 
 
Beliefs about AIDS 
 
5. Some of the NDHS questions gauged how many people 
correctly reject local misconceptions regarding HIV and 
AIDS. The survey measured the percentage of people who 
know that a) it is possible for a healthy-looking 
person to have the AIDS virus, b) AIDS cannot be 
transmitted by mosquito bites, c) AIDS cannot be 
transmitted by witchcraft or other supernatural means, 
and d) a person cannot become infected by sharing food 
with someone with AIDS. Again, levels of knowledge are 
higher among men than women, and the greatest 
variability is by level of education. 
 
6. Overall, 53 percent of women and 73 percent of men 
know that a healthy-looking person can have AIDS. For 
each of the misconceptions about transmission noted 
above, about 40 percent of women know that none is 
really a mode of transmission; the percentage is 
slightly higher for men. Respondents who know that a 
healthy-looking person can have AIDS and who also 
reject the two most common misconceptions about 
transmission (AIDS can be transmitted by mosquitoes or 
supernatural means) are in a minority: 21 percent of 
women and 28 percent of men. 
 
Stigma and Discrimination 
 
7. To assess the level of acceptance of persons living 
with HIV, respondents were asked questions regarding 
behavioral treatment and attitudes. Overall, about 40 
percent of respondents reported they would be willing 
to care of a family member with HIV at home. The 
greatest variation in this response was by region. Only 
one quarter of respondents in the South West said they 
would care for a sick relative at home. A majority of 
respondents overall (61 percent of women and 70 percent 
of men) said they believe the HIV-positive status of a 
family member does not need to remain a secret. But 
only 20 percent of women and 28 percent of men said 
they would purchase vegetables from a person with the 
AIDS virus. And only 23 percent of women and 27 percent 
of men believe that a female teacher with the AIDS 
virus should be allowed to continue teaching in school. 
Only 3 percent of women and 7 percent of men reported 
acceptance of all four indicators in this category. 
 
Knowledge of Mother to Child Transmission 
 
8. Overall, 24 percent of women who had given birth in 
the two years preceding the survey had received 
counseling about HIV/AIDS during a prenatal care visit. 
This rate varied by region, ranging from about 60 
percent in the South East and South West to only 15 
percent and 11 percent in the North East and North 
West, respectively. 
 
Sexual Negotiation, Attitudes, and Communication 
 
9. To assess the ability of women to negotiate safer 
sex with a spouse who has a sexually transmitted 
infection (STI), all respondents were asked a) whether 
a wife is justified in refusing to have sex with her 
husband if she knows he has a STI and b) whether she is 
justified in asking her husband to use a condom. Nearly 
90 percent of women and 95 percent of men responded 
that a woman may either refuse to have sex with her 
husband or ask him to wear a condom in this situation. 
Both men and women are more likely to report that a 
woman is justified to refuse to have sex than to 
propose use of a condom. 
 
10. The NDHS assessed whether male respondents agreed 
with various statements regarding condoms. Thirty 
percent of men agreed with the statement that condoms 
are inconvenient to use, and 37 percent agreed that 
condoms reduce sexual pleasure. Most men know that 
condoms cannot be reused, and a majority agree that a 
condom protects against disease. Overall, 30 percent of 
men agreed with the statement that a woman has no right 
to tell a man to use a condom. This rate varies by 
region: 73 percent of male respondents agreed with the 
statement in the North West, while between 10 and 25 
percent of the male respondents in the other regions of 
the country agreed with the statement. 
 
11. Nationally, 36 percent of married women and 58 
percent of married men said they had discussed 
prevention of AIDS with their partners. Over 90 percent 
of respondents said that discussion of AIDS is 
acceptable in the media, at home, and in schools, 
churches, and mosques. 
 
High Risk Sex and Condom Use 
 
12. For both men and women, the percentage of 
respondents engaging in high-risk sex (sex with a non- 
marital, non-cohabiting partner) increases with level 
of education, from 2 percent of women and 11 percent of 
men with no education to 33 percent of women and 48 
percent of men with higher education. The percentage of 
respondents who use a condom when they engage in high- 
risk sex also increases with education level. 
 
13. Compared to overall percentages, high-risk sexual 
behavior is more prevalent among young men and women 
(age 15 to 24). Among these respondents, 29 percent of 
women and 78 percent of men reported having high-risk 
sex in the 12 months preceding the survey. As with 
respondents overall, the percentage of young men and 
women engaging in high-risk sex increased with 
education level: from 3 percent among women with no 
education to 75 percent among women with higher 
education. There was an insufficient number of cases of 
men to allow for analysis by education level. High-risk 
sexual behavior also varies by region for women. Most 
female respondents in the southern regions reported 
having engaged in high-risk sex, while only 35 percent 
in North Central and fewer than 10 percent in North 
East and North West reported similarly. Nationally, 
most young women who are sexually active live with a 
partner, while more young men who are sexually active 
do not live exclusively with a single partner. The 
percentage of young people with multiple partners is 
fairly low: 2 percent of women and 8 percent of men. 
 
Sexual Behavior among Young People 
 
14. One fifth of women age 15-19 had sex before the age 
of 15, and half of women aged 20-24 had sex before age 
18. Percentages among men are lower (8 percent and 22 
percent, respectively). The percentage of women who had 
sex before age 15 declined with increasing education, 
from 42 percent among women with no education, to less 
than 1 percent among women with higher education. 
 
15. Overall, young women are less than half as likely 
as young men to know of a source of condoms. For both 
men and women, the likelihood of knowing of a source is 
greater for respondents with higher education levels 
and in the southern regions. Among sexually active 
respondents aged 15-24, only 6 percent of women and 17 
percent of men reported using a condom the first time 
they had sex. No urban-rural variation was found among 
young persons as to whether or not they had had 
premarital sex, but urban women and men were about 
twice as likely to have used a condom the last time 
they had sex. 
 
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) 
 
16. Overall, 55 percent of women had never heard of 
STIs. One-fifth of all women could identify a symptom a 
man might have, and one-fifth could identify a symptom 
a woman might have. Most men have heard of an STI (71 
percent), though not all who had heard of an STI could 
identify a symptom a man or woman might have. 
 
Orphans 
 
17. Overall, the NDHS found that fewer than 1 percent 
of children had lost both parents as a result of AIDS; 
however, 6 percent of children under age 15 had lost at 
least one parent. The highest prevalence is in the 
South East, where 11 percent of children have lost one 
or both parents. Nationwide, 11 percent of children 
under age 15 are living with neither mother nor father, 
as are 18 percent of the children aged 10-14. 
 
Comment 
 
18. The NDHS findings can help to target programs and 
tailor messages on HIV/AIDS for different age groups, 
regions, and education levels. Several findings raise 
questions that warrant further explanation or 
investigation. With regard to beliefs and social 
stigma, for example, while 45 percent of women and 59 
percent of men knew that a person cannot become 
infected by sharing food with someone who has the AIDS 
virus, only 20 percent of women and 28 percent of men 
reported they would buy vegetables from a shopkeeper 
who has AIDS. Also related to beliefs and such stigma, 
men in the South West are least likely to be willing to 
care for a family member with HIV, but most likely to 
believe that the HIV-positive status of a family member 
does not need to remain a secret. Perhaps this second 
belief does not reflect an acceptance of openness per 
se, but rather a desire to know the HIV-status of 
potential partners to better avoid those who are HIV- 
positive. 
 
19. Generally, men and women with higher education 
levels are more likely to know about HIV/AIDS and 
prevention methods and to engage in behaviors that help 
prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The notable exception 
to this correlation is in regard to having sex with non- 
married, non-cohabiting partners, where likelihood 
rises with education level for both men and women. 
Reliable data on HIV prevalence among these groups are 
needed to determine whether this high-risk behavior is 
of great concern or whether it is offset by the higher 
rates of condom use and other preventative behavior.

SUBJECT: Nigerian Crude Not Yet Flowing from Total - 
Other Union Actions Pending 
 
1. Contrary to media reports that an agreement between 
the French oil company Total and Nigeria\'s white-collar 
oil workers union PENGASSAN has been reached allowing 
for immediate resumption of the company\'s crude oil 
production, O.B. Haffner, Corporate Affairs Manager for 
Total Nigeria, told ECONOFF on Thursday morning, July 
8, that there is no final agreement between the parties 
and that production has not resumed.  He suggested 
negotiations are ongoing and may be close to 
resolution, and said he would have a clearer indication 
of their progress and possibly a timetable for 
restarting production by 3:00 p.m. local time on July 
8. 
 
2. On Wednesday evening, July 7, Haffner reiterated the 
company\'s public statements that oil production was 
halted as a precautionary measure due to a \"degraded 
safety situation\" resulting from a union dispute over 
perceived inequities involving expatriate versus 
Nigerian hiring for high-skill jobs.  Haffner told 
Econoff Wednesday morning that the company expected to 
be pumping crude again by the end of the weekend or 
early next week. 
 
OTHER PENDING UNION ACTIONS 
 
3. Meanwhile, the umbrella union organization Nigeria 
Labour Congress (NLC) publicly softened its position on 
a threatened industrial action over the state of the 
nation\'s refineries after what were deemed fruitful 
discussions between the NLC and GON officials regarding 
pension reform.  But simultaneously, the NLC issued new 
strike warnings in conjunction with fuel prices.  NLC 
representatives were quoted as saying prices have risen 
contrary to a court ruling of mid-June that resolved a 
two-day nationwide strike over the consumer price of 
gasoline. 
 
4. ExxonMobil and PENGASSAN continue to negotiate 
contracts, and company officials have publicly stated 
their confidence that negotiations will conclude 
amicably.  PENGASSAN issued a 21-day ultimatum on July 
5, promising industrial action against the company for 
failure to conclude collective bargaining. 
 
5. COMMENT: In the past, the major oil companies 
operating in Nigeria have generally avoided crude 
production and lifting interruptions as a result of 
disputes with the white-collar union PENGASSAN.  At 
times, PENGASSAN employees working at corporate 
headquarters have engaged in work-to-rule actions, 
which slowed administrative functions, but outright 
closure of production has been rare in recent years. 
The disclosure in today\'s newspaper the Guardian that 
ExxonMobil\'s Managing Director Mike Fry is leaving 
Nigeria may give PENGASSAN room to claim a victory, as 
Fry was blamed for stalled collective bargaining 
negotiations.  The resumption of talks yesterday 
suggests that both sides are ready to conclude this 
round of contract negotiations without incident. 
Nonetheless, the closure of Total\'s production this 
last week stands as a reminder that the ongoing 
struggle for greater local content and hiring in the 
petroleum sector, during a trend of company 
restructuring and streamlining, may have an impact on 
corporate and government coffers. END COMMENT.

1. O.B. Haffner, Corporate Affairs Manager for Total 
Nigeria, told ECONOFF on Friday, July 9, that the 
company has resumed crude oil production from its Elf 
Petroleum Nigeria Ltd. unit.  Total\'s Nigeria 
production was closed for one week as a result of a 
union dispute (reftel).  Haffner said Total\'s 
production should reach \"optimal level\" by the end of 
the day. 
 
2. Haffner noted that negotiations with the white- 
collar union PENGASSAN have not concluded, and no 
agreement has been finalized.  Nonetheless, he said, 
the unions are satisfied by the company\'s level of 
commitment to the talks, and he said a fair agreement 
should be within reach.  \"All is well now,\" Haffner 
concluded.

SUBJECT: JULY 2004 INTERIM UPDATE OF 2003 NIGERIA INVESTMENT 
CLIMATE STATEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 141379 
 
This appendix updates the 2003 Nigeria Investment Climate 
Statement.  It is intended for investors, pending re- 
publication of the Country Commercial Guide (CCG) (of which 
the Investment Climate Statement is a chapter).  The CCG 
will henceforth be released on a calendar year basis (i.e., 
in January rather than in August, as had been the practice). 
 
The text below reflects the significant changes in the 
investment climate that have occurred in Nigeria in the last 
year (July 2003 - July 2004). Those parts of the 2003 
Investment Climate Statement that remain valid have not been 
modified by this appendix since the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria 
is satisfied that they continue to reflect the state of 
affairs as of July 2004. 
 
Openness to Foreign Investment 
------------------------------ 
 
Replace paragraph 4 of this section by the following text: 
 
The GON has substantially opened Nigeria\'s 
telecommunications sector.  The Telecommunications Act of 
2001 abolished requirements for standard mobile technologies 
and authorized the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) 
to issue licenses to existing and prospective service 
providers, effectively ending NITEL\'s monopoly over 
telecommunications services.  In early 2001, the NCC 
auctioned off licenses for global systems for mobile 
communications (GSM), an effort commended in both local and 
international circles for its transparency.  Four 
enterprises, including NITEL, won licenses. Globacom won 
mobile, fixed, and international gateway licenses as 
Nigeria\'s second national operator in mid-2002.  By mid 
2004, Nigeria\'s leading mobile service providers supported 
slightly more than three million subscribers. 
 
Delete paragraph 6 of this section. 
 
Conversion and Transfer Policies

Dispute Settlement 
------------------ 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Performance Requirements and Incentives 
--------------------------------------- 
 
Replace paragraph 1 by the following text: 
 
Import Policies1: Tariffs provide the Government of Nigeria 
(GON) its second largest source of revenue after oil 
exports.  But frequent policy changes and uneven duty 
collection make importing difficult and expensive, and 
create severe bottlenecks.  Nigeria\'s dependence on imports 
aggravates the situation. 
 
In its last major tariff revision in March 2003, the GON cut 
duties on 230 line items (mostly raw materials, base metals, 
and capital equipment), but raised tariffs on 30 others 
(largely plastic, rubber, and aluminum articles).  Most 
increases were relatively small.  The GON had announced 
similar cuts and increases in 2001 and 2002. 
 
Bans prohibit about 60 line-item goods imports including 
meat, fresh fruit, cassava, pasta, fruit juice in retail 
packs, toothpicks, soaps and detergents, textiles, plastics, 
and barite (used in well drilling).  The GON banned 41 items 
in January 2004. 
 
Under Import Policies, replace paragraph 5 by the following 
text: 
 
In 2002 and again in 2003, the GON announced plans to 
replace its pre-shipment inspection regime by one mandating 
100 percent destination inspections at Nigerian ports of 
entry.  The proposed change was twice deferred, however, 
amid doubts about officials\' ability to implement it. 
Importers feared corruption would increase if the Nigerian 
Customs Service had sole purview over goods\' classification 
and valuation.  Many major shippers prefer pre-shipment 
inspection because it provides them with official 
documentation to refute charges of overvaluation or 
inappropriately classified goods, if necessary. 
 
Under Government Procurement, replace paragraph 1 by the 
following text: 
 
 
The GON awards contracts under an open tender system, 
advertising tenders in Nigerian newspapers and opening them 
to domestic and foreign companies.  Procurement has 
gradually become more transparent, but corruption persists. 
 
Under Government Procurement, replace paragraph 3 by the 
following text: 
 
In January 2001, the GON issued procurement and contracting 
guidelines clarifying competitive tendering and decision- 
making procedures, defining bid security and mobilization 
fee rules, and providing for audits of capital projects. 
The GON then established the Budget Monitoring and Price 
Intelligence Unit to act as a clearinghouse for government 
contracts and procurement, and to monitor the implementation 
of projects to ensure compliance with contract terms and 
budgetary restrictions.  Procurements above N50 million 
(about $380,000) are subject to due diligence review through 
this Unit. 
 
Right to Private Ownership and Establishment 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Protection of Property Rights 
----------------------------- 
 
Delete paragraph 2.  Replace paragraphs 9 and 10 by the 
following text: 
 
Most raids involving copyright, patent, or trademark 
infringement appear to target small rather than large and 
well-connected pirates. Very few cases have been 
successfully prosecuted.  Most cases are settled out of 
court, if at all.  Those adjudicated in court are handled 
primarily by the Federal High Court, whose judges are 
generally broadly familiar with intellectual property rights 
(IPR) law.  Lower court judges, as well as most legal 
practitioners, are often unfamiliar with IPR, so 
misapplication of the law is common. 
 
Transparency of the Regulatory System 
------------------------------------- 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Efficient Capital Markets and Portfolio Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
Replace paragraphs 3 and 4 by the following text: 
 
The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) was buoyant in 2003 and 
remained so as of July 2004.  The NSE operates six branches 
nationwide. The volume of shares traded and market 
capitalization continue to rise.  The NSE continues to 
expand its membership and investor pool, and some 200 
enterprises are listed on the exchange. 
 
Government debt instruments are available. Except for 
federal government instruments of short and medium maturity, 
other instruments of state governments and parastatal 
companies are often considered high risk because of the 
historically poor performance of Nigeria\'s public 
enterprises. 
 
Eighty-nine full-service commercial banks operate in 
Nigeria, a number reflecting the rarity of bank mergers and 
acquisitions.  Capital concentration is nonetheless 
significant, as Nigeria\'s 10 largest commercial banks held 
55.3 percent of total bank assets and 56.2 percent of total 
deposit liabilities as of the end of 2003, and accounted for 
44.3 percent of total credit extended that year.  Central 
Bank guidelines stipulate a 2 billion naira ($15 million) 
minimum capital requirement for new banks; existing banks 
must maintain 1 billion naira ($7.5 million) in capital. 
 
In July 2004, the new Governor of the Central Bank of 
Nigeria Charles Soludo announced a new capital requirement 
of 25 billion naira ($187 million) for all banks in the 
country. The Central Bank has set a December 2005 deadline 
for compliance with this directive. Governor Saludo has 
stated that the new capitalization requirement will 
encourage bank mergers and acquisitions, and will thus 
strengthen the banking industry, as well as the Central 
Bank\'s regulatory and supervisory capabilities. 
 
The implementation of tight monetary policies by the Central 
Bank to stabilize the naira and curb imprudent lending has 
led to liquidity problems at some banks in the last year. 
The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) had 
reported that unsound loans and advances increased from 4.6 
to 12 percent of the industry total during 2002, reaching 
105 billion naira ($783 million).  In 2003, the NDIC 
committed itself to scrutinizing and closing unsound 
financial institutions.  High reserve requirements for 
public sector lending have dramatically reduced lending to 
government and parastatal entities. 
Political Violence 
------------------ 
 
Replace paragraph 3 by the following text: 
 
Nigeria continues to experience communal violence.  . 
Violence in the Delta region, the middle-belt states, and 
Kano resulted in hundreds of deaths in 2003, and sporadic 
ethno-religious violence in Plateau State resulted in 
several hundred deaths and the declaration of a state of 
emergency in early 2004.  The advent of vigilante groups in 
various parts of the country, particularly the Delta region 
and Eastern Benue State, has exacerbated communal violence. 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Bilateral Investment Agreements 
------------------------------- 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
OPIC and Other Investment Insurance Programs 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Labor 
----- 
 
Insert the following new paragraph after paragraph 4 
(paragraph entitled \"Collective Bargaining\"): 
 
Collective bargaining in the petroleum industry is 
relatively efficient compared to that in other sectors. 
Except for a longstanding unresolved dispute over the 
industry\'s use of contract labor, issues pertaining to 
salaries, benefits, health, and safety and other working 
conditions tend generally to be resolved quickly through 
negotiation. Organized labor\'s efforts to address broad 
political issues, however, have resulted in industrial 
actions that continue to affect industry productivity. 
 
Foreign Trade Zones/Free Ports 
------------------------------ 
 
No significant change since 2003. 
 
Foreign Direct Investment Statistics 
------------------------------------ 
 
These statistics will be updated in the next Investment 
Climate Statement, which will be published in January 2005.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S SPECIAL BRAND OF ISLAM 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. The Ambassador met with the Secretary 
General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic 
Affairs Lateef Adegbite in early July  to discuss the 
nature of Islam in Nigeria, includingthe dividends of 
democracy, procedural safeguards inherent in Sharia 
law, the urgent need to restartcommencement of the 
polio vaccination campaign in the northes, and 
religious reconciliation.  Adegbite\'s remarks 
andoutspoken support for Obasanjo may reflect that they 
are both Yoruba and from the same district.indicate 
that ethnic unity is more important than religious 
differences.  Adegbite distanced the practice of Islam 
in Nigeria from practices in other parts of the world 
that have been linked withterrorism, emphasizing the 
religious tolerance and acceptance that characterizes 
Islam in Yorubaland and, he said, in other parts of the 
nation.  Adegbite represents the moderate, tolerant 
Yoruba brand of Islam that is anathema to the more 
fundamentalist Islamic thought found in northern 
Nigeria. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
2. (SBU) The Ambassador met with the Secretary General 
of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Dr. 
Lateef Adegbite on July 1 in Lagos.  Adegbite opened by 
saying that said Nigeria is making progress on the 
issues of Sharia law and Muslim/Christian 
reconciliation.His concern is that of showing Islam and 
its estimated 60 million Nigerian followers in the most 
positive light possible. 
 
3. (SBU) Adegbite asserted that the nature of Islam in 
Nigeria has nothing to do with terrorism that many 
people associate with other parts of the world. 
Adegbite He expressed concern over a perceived 
\"blacklisting\" of Nigerian Muslims as a supporters of 
terrorism by outsiders.  Adegbite emphasized that 
Nigeria\'s own brand of Islam is non-violent, and that 
its Muslims have never harbored or supported secret 
patrons of terrorism.  Adegbite saidasked Ambassador 
Campbell to assist in \"de-listing\" Nigeria, as 
assistance from various organizations outside Africa to 
build mosques and schools has dried up as a result of 
Nigerian Islam\'s false association with terrorism. 
Adegbite underscored that the practice of Islam in 
Nigeria is different fromthan in other parts of the 
Muslim world. 
 
3.4. (SBU) Adegbite offered hisa historical perspective 
on Nigeria\'s religious conflicts over the past decade. 
He recalleddiscussed religious conflict overabout 
Sharia law that arosein 1981 in Kaduna and Jos, which 
overflowed into Plateau State.  He stated that current 
religious disturbances are often political or ethnic in 
nature, like thoese past events. 
 
4.5. (SBU) Adegbite discussed the current conflict in 
Plateau, which began in 2001.  He suggested that theThe 
conflict problem stems from the indigenous population\'s 
monopoly hold on government jobs that excludes more 
recent immigrants to the state.practice of appointing 
persons to various positions in agencies of the 
Government of Nigeria (GON), excluding persons from the 
immigrant communities in the process. Adegbite 
described the indigenous communities of Plateau as 
mostlyentirely Christian and the immigrants as 
mostlyentirely Muslim. He stated that the immigrants, 
feeling disenfranchised, vent their anger by attacking 
rival religious institutions.  While the conflict in 
Plateau appears to be religious, its root causes are 
rivalries between \"indigenes\" and newcomers that are 
often expressed in ethnic and religious termspolitical. 
As for the historical conflicts between the indigenous 
farmers and immigrant herders, economic competition and 
employment are also important underlying factorsat the 
base. 
 
RELIGIOUS RECONCILIATION 
 
56. (SBU) Adegbite discussed the activities of the 
Nigerian Inter-Religious Council, a Muslim and 
Christian group with a mission of religious 
reconciliation.  It was Ffounded five years ago by 
Muslim imams and Christian preachers to intervene 
positively in the Sharia crisis, .  iIt is a grassroots 
effort by 25 Christians and 25 Muslims, whose members 
are the highest-ranking religious leaders in Nigeria, 
who work to and who together and sometimes on foot 
visit communities to defusediscuss religious issues. 
The Council\'s coordinator is Professor Obaje, President 
Obasanjo\'s Chaplain.  The Sultan of Sokoto is also a 
member of the Council. 
 
67.  (SBU) Adegbite cited the practice of Islam in 
Yorubaland territory as an example of successful 
religious coexistence both with Christianity and 
traditional Yoruba religion.  He characterized the 
Yoruba way of thinking as open and tolerant, and Yoruba 
adherents of Christianity, Islam, and indigenous 
paganism or traditionalreligions are united by a strong 
sense of all come together in this region under acommon 
ethnicity.      8. (SBU) Adegbite said the Nigeria 
Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) dates back 
to the creation of the Muslim Society of Students in 
1954.  He went on that the NSCIA will celebrate its 
golden jubilee this August.  NSCIA would welcome 
Ambassador Campbell\'s and Embassy staff\'s participation 
in its celebrations. 
 
7.9  (SBU) Adegbite contrasted the differences between 
the political roots of Islam in Nigeria and the 
practice of Islam in theArab world.  While Nigerian 
Muslim scholars trained in Saudi Arabia tend to be more 
conservative and traditionalist in their practice of 
Islam, they are reluctant to criticize the conventional 
practice of Islam in Nigeria. Adegbite said Arab 
influence is limited because traditional 
leaders-sultans, sheiks, and emirs--fulfill both 
religious and civil functions in the region.  Adegbite 
asserted that they exercise firm control over the 
North.  He also remarked that these leaders have very 
close relationships with the United States and the 
United Kingdom. 
 
SHARIA LAW 
 
810.  (SBU) Adegbite asserted there is strong support 
for the establishment of Sharia law in Nigeria, 
particularly among the younger population.  He said 
divorce, family, and estate issues are those most often 
brought into Sharia courts.  Adegbite is pleased that 
Muslims in Nigeria have not been denied the right to 
choose their own legal system under the current 
democratic dispensation.  This is one of the dividends 
of democracy provided by the constitution.  This 
process for adopting Sharia includes a resolution that 
must be passed by the state House of Assembly, where 
Muslims must carry their Christian counterparts along. 
Adegbite said prominence must be given to the 
traditional coexistence of Muslims and Christians after 
the establishment of Sharia so as not to allow ethnic 
differences to aggravate religious complexities. 
 
11.  (SBU) While discussing Sharia law in the North, 
The Ambassador cautioned Adegbite about the human 
rights repercussions of stoning and amputations as a 
form of punishment. Adegbite replied that a legal 
system should not be evaluated solely on the basis of 
its possible forms of punishment.  He pointed to 
provisions for execution by electric chair, firing 
squads, and hanging in the statutes of many nations, 
including the United States.  Adegbite went on that 
these punishments do not necessarily indicate the moral 
value of the legal system that delivers them.  Adegbite 
agreed with Ambassador Campbell that Sharia law is a 
fast and cheap means to deliver justice, and emphasized 
that it is a manifestation of the religion of the 
followers of Islam. 
 12.  (SBU) Adegbite cited the example of adultery to 
illustrate the safeguards built into Sharia law. 
Adegbite statAdegbite said he had offered his legal 
services as a friend of the court in a sharia case 
involving possible adultery.  (Adegbite did not mention 
the name of Amina Lawal in the discussion, but that is 
to whom he was referring.)  In his analysis, Adegbite 
emphasized that since no man had acknowledged the 
paternity of the child in question, the defendant 
should not have been found guilty of adultery. 
Adegbite argued that the case was, therefore, flawed in 
the terms of Sharia law, and, thus, should have been 
dismissed - as it was.  Adegbite cited as evidence of 
Sharia\'s popularity the attendance ofasserted that the 
Governor of Kano was forced to accept Sharia law since 
there is widespread and strong grassroots support for 
Sharia law in Kano State.  Support is strong despite 
the harshness of its punishments.  He said two million 
people in Kano for the public inauguration of Sharia 
law. 
 
POLIO 
 Because of this crowd, the governor could not get to 
the podium to make his speech and so was forced to 
deliver a televised message. 
 
9.  (SBU) The Ambassador expressed grave concern about 
asked the progress of the polio vaccination campaign in 
Kano.  Adegbite replied that he had visited the Kano 
governor to discuss the issue.  Adegbite claimed the 
governor is not against the vaccination campaign in 
principle, but the governor will not accept government- 
sponsored vaccines.  He insists that the polio vaccine 
be from a Muslim supplier.  The governor told Adegbite 
that Kano State authorities had arranged to obtain the 
vaccine from suppliers in Malaysia or Indonesia and 
that vaccinations would resume shortly.  Adegbite 
stated that he had cautioned the governor about the 
negative international image resulting from this issue. 
Adegbite said he would personally follow up with the 
governor on the need for the resumption of polio 
vaccinations in Kano. 
 
PRESIDENT OBASANJO 
 
10.  (SBU) Adegbite gave high marks to Obasanjo and his 
administration.  Adegbite stated that Obasanjo, given 
his military background, is the right man for the job 
of President.  Adegbite said Nigeria\'s political 
culture has changed, fueled as it was by the democratic 
elections of 1999 and 2003.  He said the biggest 
dividend of democracy is the air of freedom that 
Nigerians now enjoy.  Adegbite characterized this 
freedom as palpable, and that with respect to both the 
written and spoken word, Nigeria is wholly a free 
country.Adegbite affirmed that one of Obasanjo\'s 
greatest contributions has been his promotion of good 
international relationships between Nigeria and the 
rest of the world.  (Comment. In a recent press 
article, Adegbite was quoted as saying that 
(CHOGM)Obasanjo looks \"like a successor to Mandela\". 
End comment.) 
 
11.  (SBU) Adegbite recalled that he and Obasano are 
both from a district near but stated that although they 
are both from Abeokuta., ethnic loyalty does not drive 
this support.   Adegbite noted that Abeokuta hasis one 
district in Nigeria that has disproportionately 
produced Nigeria\'s contemporary leaders.  He mentioned 
Anglican Archbishop Peter Akinola, President of the 
Christian Association of Nigeria, Chief Rotimi 
Williams, perhaps the leading Lagos attorney, and the 
late Moshood Abiola, candidate for thechallenger to the 
presidency.  Adegbite attributed Abeokuta\'s unique 
distinction to the residual influence of freedreturned 
slaves who had returned to Africa and founded strong 
communities in that district.  Adegbite mentioned that 
his own great-grandfather had been a returned slave. 
The first church in Nigeria was founded in Abeokuta in 
1842, marking the beginning of organized Christianity 
in Nigeria.  The early influence of the Christian 
missionaries and of their schools gave the town an 
educational lead.  The interaction between the returnee 
communities, the missionaries, and the indigenous 
population was characterized by an  openness and 
outward-orientation that today\'s leaders inherited, he 
concluded. 
 
12. (SBU) COMMENT.  Adegbite is friendly and well 
disposed toward the West.  The official location of his 
law practice is in Abuja, and he is often there for his 
own and NSCIA business.  He maintains an office in 
Lagos, where he works closely with American companies 
doing business in Nigeria.  To show Islam in its most 
positive light, he has been active publicly on issues 
of Sharia law, polio, and religious reconciliation.  He 
believes that there are enough procedural and other 
safeguards in Sharia law to preclude stoning, a view 
widely held by educated Muslims.  Adegbite\'s support 
for Obasanjo indicates that ethnic unity may sometimes 
trump religious difference, especially at the 
leadership level among Yorubas.  Adegbite is a close 
ally of the traditional northern Muslim establishment. 
It is their leadership that risks challenge should 
Islam in Nigeria evolve toward more fundamentalists 
ways of thinking and practice.  Adegbite was unwilling 
to discuss such fissures within the Muslim community.

SUBJECT: HARRIS CORPORATION DUKING IT OUT FOR A 
LUCRATIVE NIGERIAN TELECOMS CONTRACT 
 
REFTEL LAGOS 00676 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Harris Communications, a U.S. firm, 
faces Japanese NEC for a multi-million dollar contract 
with Globacom for microwave telecommunications 
equipment.  Whether the playing field is level is an 
open question.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Harris Communications Systems Nigeria Ltd. 
(Harris), a subsidiary of Harris Corporation of Redwood 
Shores, California, is pursuing a $30 million microwave 
communications equipment contract in Nigeria.  Harris 
is a large player in the local telecommunications 
equipment market, and counts as customers three of the 
four GSM service providers in Nigeria (South Africa\'s 
MTN, Zimbabwe\'s Econet Wireless International, and M- 
Tel, a subsidiary of state-run NITEL). 
 
3. (SBU) The Nigerian company Globacom, which Harris 
eyes as a potential customer, holds the fourth and 
final GSM license in the country.  While late to roll 
out its mobile network (reftel), Globacom has plans for 
a system that could eclipse Nigeria\'s largest mobile 
players, MTN and Econet.  Such a feat might be possible 
since MTN and Econet are oversubscribed and are having 
a hard time keeping up with Nigerian demand.  Harris 
Nigeria could raise its revenue in Nigeria in the near 
term thirty percent if it were to clinch the Globacom 
contract. 
 
The Competition 
 
4. (SBU) Globacom has narrowed its search to two 
microwave equipment suppliers: Harris and the Nippon 
Electric Company (NEC) of Japan.  Globacom initially 
courted a number of other firms including Alcatel and 
Siemens.  Harris Nigeria company executive told Econoff 
that Globacom is likely to choose a supplier within the 
next two weeks. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment.  Were Globacom to award the contract 
to NEC, the latter might gain more than just a large 
share of Nigeria\'s microwave communications equipment. 
It could also establish a foothold in an equipment 
market sector in which there has so far been only one 
player, Harris.  Harris is concerned that the NEC may 
be prepared to use whatever tactic is necessary to gain 
access to the Nigerian market. 
 
Downside of Doing Business in Nigeria 
 
6. (SBU) While Harris is engaged in negotiations with 
Globacom, Harris is preparing itself for what it did 
not expect when it came to Nigeria.  As a supplier to 
NITEL-owned M-Tel, Harris may soon be pressed to accept 
naira payment for some of its local business.  Payment 
in naira could reduce Harris\'s profit margin as a 
result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, the 
effect of which could be magnified were Harris to be 
compelled to pay additional income taxes in Nigeria. 
 
7. (SBU) Nigeria\'s population numbers about 130 
million, but its fixed telephony rate is a mere four 
telephone landlines per 1,000 people.  GSM service is 
thus the only viable mid- to long-term connectivity 
resource in Nigeria. Since GSM services were introduced 
in August 2001, about four million subscribers have 
become hooked to mobile phones.

SUBJECT: POLITICAL UNDERTONE OF SLOK AIR\'S GROUNDING 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Since the suspension and subsequent 
revocation of its license in March, Slok Air remains 
grounded. Though accused of having violated aviation 
regulations, the airline\'s travails have been 
associated with a political face-off between Orji Kalu, 
Abia State Governor and owner of Slok, and the ruling 
Peoples\' Democratic Party (PDP). While aviation 
operators are divided on the merits of the revocation 
of the airline\'s license, the Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority (NCAA) denies that it succumbed to political 
influence.  Other stakeholders are watching the 
regulatory authority attentively. End summary. 
 
2. (U) On March 12, 2004 the NCAA announced the 
suspension of two domestic airline operators, Slok 
Airlines and IRS Airlines, citing violation of aviation 
regulations. The NCAA claimed that IRS Airlines was 
sanctioned for destroying an instrument landing system 
at Kano Airport while Slok was suspended for offenses 
ranging from operating more aircrafts than approved by 
the NCAA to inadequate maintenance of its fleet. 
Although IRS has since regained its license and resumed 
operations, Slok remains grounded, as the Aviation 
Ministry subsequently revoked its air transport license 
(ATL). 
 
3. (U) Slok Air began operating in January 2004 with 
two B737-200 aircrafts flying daily between Lagos, 
Enugu, Port Harcourt and Owerri.  Having planned to 
extend flights to thirteen other Nigerian cities, the 
airline was to have acquired possibly eight additional 
aircrafts. By March the airline had added two more 
aircrafts to its fleet, but these were not listed on 
its operations specification documentation. Soon 
thereafter, the airline was accused of running all four 
aircraft with inadequate maintenance, as well as 
disregarding weather advisories. 
 
4. (U) Slok Air\'s suspension and subsequent revocation 
of its ATL nonetheless has political undertones. Slok 
Airlines is a subsidiary of Slok Nigeria Limited and is 
owned by Orji Uzor Kalu, Governor of Abia state. Kalu 
who recently had a face-off with a chieftain of the 
ruling Peoples\' Democratic Party (PDP), is said to have 
floated the airline in anticipation of a presidential 
campaign in 2007. According to Stanley Uhajuruka, 
Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Kalu has, 
however, been a \"thorn in the flesh\" of the PDP, on 
whose platform he was twice elected governor. Uhajuruka 
charges that to \"check\" the outspoken governor, the GON 
revoked his airline\'s ATL under the cover of 
technicalities. 
 
5. (U) Aviation operators are divided on the issue. 
Edward Boyo, Managing Director, Overland Airways, 
believes the sanctions were justified and long overdue. 
But the Nigerian Aviation Safety Initiative, an 
aviation non-governmental organization, believes the 
GON\'s actions were high-handed and should be reversed. 
What seems clear is that Governor Kalu was not making 
many friends in the industry.  Boyo, for instance, 
added that besides violating industry regulations, Slok 
Air was charging airfares 20 percent lower than its 
competitors, pricing that nearly destabilized the 
market and would have been unsustainable. 
 
6. (U) Comment: Although Slok Air might have failed to 
abide by the regulations, the way the sanctions were 
imposed suggests political motivation. Boyo has 
asserted that the carrier \"would have been sanctioned 
much earlier if it were not owned by a governor\", a 
statement that reflects the school of thought that if 
the governor had remained \"good\", his aircraft would 
have continued to fly despite their technical 
shortcomings. Skeptics say the Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority has to do more than just deny that political 
motives were behind its actions; it needs to sanction 
all erring operators without fear or favor. This is not 
the case, so the operators, investors and other 
stakeholders are watching the industry\'s regulators 
more closely now than in the past.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NO REPORTS OF AMCITS IN BAYELSA KIDNAPPING 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. Reports indicate several expatriate 
hostages have been taken near Brass in Bayelsa State in 
the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.  We have NO/NO 
reports of American citizens being taken hostage, but 
an American-French drilling venture may be involved. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Preliminary but credible reports indicate 
several expatriate hostages have been taken by restive 
community members in Bayelsa State.  News reports 
indicate the hostages work for Conoil Limited, an oil 
services subsidiary of Conoil Nigeria, the privatized 
oil company formerly called National Oil.  We have also 
heard, but have not confirmed, that an American-French 
oil services company, Forasol Drilling West Africa, 
with offices in Port Harcourt, may be involved. 
 
3. (SBU) Diplomatic and security sources tell us that 
seven (7) French contractors, one Ivorian, one Croatian 
and 20 to 50 Nigerian oil workers are being held by 
community members over a dispute with Conoil regarding 
its hiring practices.  An oil services security manager 
told Econoff that the governor of Bayelsa State has 
flown to the area known as Sangana to negotiate with 
community leaders for release of the hostages. 
 
4. (SBU) COMMENT: Bayelsa State, a nearly homogenous 
ethnic Ijaw region, generally has not bee a locus of 
oil-related communal violence or disruption.  However, 
this incident serves as a reminder that the estranged 
relationships between communities and oil companies, 
and the volatility of the Delta, extend beyond the 
Warri area.  Last November, ChevronTexaco faced a stand- 
off on one of its platforms off the coast of Bayelsa, 
and past incidents between communities in Bayelsa and 
GON forces have been bloody (Odi, for example).  The 
challenge of Bayelsa is that it is even more remote and 
undeveloped than Delta or Rivers States.  Consequently, 
agitation regarding community development issues will 
flare periodically.  We will keep an eye on this 
situation to see how the state and federal governments 
handle this sensitive matter.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA\'S SPECIAL BRAND OF ISLAM 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. The Ambassador met with the 
Secretary General of the Nigeria Supreme Council 
 
SIPDIS 
for Islamic Affairs Lateef Adegbite in early July 
to discuss the nature of Islam in Nigeria, 
including procedural safeguards inherent in Sharia 
law, the urgent need to restart of the polio 
vaccination campaign in the north, and religious 
reconciliation.  Adegbite\'s outspoken support for 
Obasanjo may reflect that they are both Yoruba and 
from the same district.  Adegbite distanced the 
practice of Islam in Nigeria from terrorism, 
emphasizing the religious tolerance that 
characterizes Islam in Yorubaland and, he said, 
other parts of the nation.  Adegbite represents 
the moderate, tolerant Yoruba brand of Islam that 
is anathema to the more fundamentalist Islamic 
thought found in northern Nigeria. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) The Ambassador met with the Secretary 
General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic 
Affairs, Dr. Lateef Adegbite on July 1 in Lagos. 
Adegbite opened by saying that Nigeria is making 
progress on the issues of Sharia law and 
Muslim/Christian reconciliation. Adegbite asserted 
that the nature of Islam in Nigeria has nothing to 
do with terrorism.  He expressed concern over a 
perceived \"blacklisting\" of Nigerian Muslims as 
supporters of terrorism by outsiders.  Adegbite 
emphasized that Nigeria\'s own brand of Islam is 
non-violent, and that its Muslims have never 
harbored or supported secret patrons of terrorism. 
Adegbite said assistance from various 
organizations outside Africa to build mosques and 
schools has dried up as a result of Nigerian 
Islam\'s false association with terrorism. 
Adegbite underscored that the practice of Islam in 
Nigeria is different from other parts of the 
Muslim world. 
 
3. (SBU) Adegbite offered his historical 
perspective on Nigeria\'s religious conflicts over 
the past decade.  He recalled  conflict over 
Sharia law in 1981 in Kaduna and Jos, which 
overflowed into Plateau State.  He stated that 
current religious disturbances are often political 
or ethnic in nature, like those past events. 
 
4. (SBU) Adegbite discussed the current conflict 
in Plateau, which began in 2001.  He suggested 
that the conflict stems from the indigenous 
population\'s monopoly hold on government jobs that 
excludes more recent immigrants to the state. 
Adegbite described the indigenous communities of 
Plateau as mostly Christian and the immigrants as 
mostly Muslim. He stated that the immigrants, 
feeling disenfranchised, vent their anger by 
attacking rival religious institutions.  While the 
conflict in Plateau appears to be religious, its 
root causes are rivalries between \"indigenes\" and 
newcomers that are often expressed in ethnic and 
religious terms.  As for the historical conflicts 
between the indigenous farmers and immigrant 
herders, economic competition and employment are 
also important underlying factors. 
 
RELIGIOUS RECONCILIATION 
 
5. (SBU) Adegbite discussed the activities of the 
Nigerian Inter-Religious Council, a Muslim and 
Christian group with a mission of religious 
reconciliation.  Founded five years ago by Muslim 
imams and Christian preachers to intervene 
positively in the Sharia crisis, it is a 
grassroots effort by 25 Christians and 25 Muslims, 
the highest-ranking religious leaders in Nigeria, 
who work to defuse religious issues.  The 
Council\'s coordinator is Professor Obaje, 
President Obasanjo\'s Chaplain.  The Sultan of 
Sokoto is also a member of the Council. 
 
6.  (SBU) Adegbite cited the practice of Islam in 
Yorubaland as an example of successful religious 
coexistence both with Christianity and traditional 
Yoruba religion.  He characterized the Yoruba way 
of thinking as open and tolerant, and Yoruba 
adherents of Christianity, Islam, and indigenous 
religions are united by a strong sense of common 
ethnicity. 
 
7.  (SBU) Adegbite contrasted the differences 
between the political roots of Islam in Nigeria 
and the Arab world.  While Nigerian Muslim 
scholars trained in Saudi Arabia tend to be more 
conservative and traditionalist in their practice 
of Islam, they are reluctant to criticize the 
conventional practice of Islam in Nigeria. 
Adegbite said Arab influence is limited because 
traditional leaders-sultans, sheiks, and emirs-- 
fulfill both religious and civil functions in the 
region.  Adegbite asserted that they exercise firm 
control over the North.  He also remarked that 
these leaders have very close relationships with 
the United States and the United Kingdom. 
 
SHARIA LAW 
 
8.  (SBU) Adegbite asserted there is strong 
support for the establishment of Sharia law in 
Nigeria, particularly among the younger 
population.  He said divorce, family, and estate 
issues are those most often brought into Sharia 
courts.  Adegbite is pleased that Muslims in 
Nigeria have the right to choose their own legal 
system under the current democratic dispensation. 
The Ambassador cautioned Adegbite about the human 
rights repercussions of stoning and amputations as 
a form of punishment. Adegbite replied that a 
legal system should not be evaluated solely on the 
basis of its possible forms of punishment.  He 
pointed to provisions for execution by electric 
chair, firing squads, and hanging in the statutes 
of many nations, including the United States. 
Adegbite went on that these punishments do not 
necessarily indicate the moral value of the legal 
system that delivers them.   Adegbite said he had 
offered his legal services as a friend of the 
court in a sharia case involving possible 
adultery.  (Adegbite did not mention the name of 
Amina Lawal in the discussion, but that is to whom 
he was referring.)  In his analysis, Adegbite 
emphasized that since no man had acknowledged the 
paternity of the child in question, the defendant 
should not have been found guilty of adultery. 
Adegbite argued that the case was, therefore, 
flawed in the terms of Sharia law, and, thus, 
should have been dismissed - as it was.  Adegbite 
cited as evidence of Sharia\'s popularity the 
attendance of two million people in Kano for the 
public inauguration of Sharia law. 
 
POLIO 
 
9.  (SBU) The Ambassador expressed grave concern 
about the progress of the polio vaccination 
campaign in Kano.  Adegbite replied that he had 
visited the Kano governor to discuss the issue. 
Adegbite claimed the governor is not against the 
vaccination campaign in principle, but the 
governor will not accept government-sponsored 
vaccines.  He insists that the polio vaccine be 
from a Muslim supplier.  The governor told 
Adegbite that Kano State authorities had arranged 
to obtain the vaccine from suppliers in Malaysia 
or Indonesia and that vaccinations would resume 
shortly.  Adegbite stated that he had cautioned 
the governor about the negative international 
image resulting from this issue.  Adegbite said he 
would personally follow up with the governor on 
the need for the resumption of polio vaccinations 
in Kano. 
 
PRESIDENT OBASANJO 
 
10.  (SBU) Adegbite gave high marks to Obasanjo 
and his administration.  Adegbite stated that 
Obasanjo, given his military background, is the 
right man for the job of President.  Adegbite said 
Nigeria\'s political culture has changed, fueled as 
it was by the democratic elections of 1999 and 
2003.  He said the biggest dividend of democracy 
is the air of freedom that Nigerians now enjoy. 
Adegbite affirmed that one of Obasanjo\'s greatest

international relationships between Nigeria and 
the rest of the world.  (Comment. In a recent 
press article, Adegbite was quoted as saying that

comment.) 
 
11.  (SBU) Adegbite recalled that he and Obasano 
are both from a district near Abeokuta.  Adegbite 
noted that Abeokuta has disproportionately 
produced Nigeria\'s contemporary leaders.  He 
mentioned Anglican Archbishop Peter Akinola, 
President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, 
Chief Rotimi Williams, perhaps the leading Lagos 
attorney, and the late Moshood Abiola, candidate 
for the presidency.  Adegbite attributed 
Abeokuta\'s unique distinction to the residual 
influence of freed slaves who had returned to 
Africa and founded strong communities in that 
district.  Adegbite mentioned that his own great- 
grandfather had been a returned slave.  The first 
church in Nigeria was founded in Abeokuta in 1842, 
marking the beginning of organized Christianity in

12. (SBU) COMMENT.  Adegbite is friendly and well 
disposed toward the West.  The official location 
of his law practice is in Abuja, and he is often

REF: LAGOS 1475 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY. On July 20, as reported in reftel, 
several expatriate oil services employees were taken 
hostage in Bayelsa State.  We have since learned that 
all have been released, including one American citizen. 
The incident did not involve a host community dispute 
as originally reported, but rather was the result of a 
labor dispute within the contracting company.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) News and field reports indicated July 20 that 
several expatriate oil workers with the indigenous firm 
Conoil Nigeria had been taken hostage in Bayelsa State. 
We have since learned the situation was purely a labor 
dispute internal to the contracting company, Forasol 
Drilling West Africa, an American-French venture. 
Forasol is a unit of U.S.-based Pride Drilling. 
Subsequent to the initial report, we also learned an 
American citizen employee of Halliburton was among the 
hostages.  That AmCit and all other expatriates have 
been released and evacuated from the site.  We do not 
know how many of the Nigerians reported yesterday as 
hostages actually participated in the labor action, but 
all employees appear to be safe and sound today. 
 
3. (SBU) According to our latest information, junior- 
level or temporary workers at Forasol commandeered an 
oil rig yesterday to protest the company\'s downsizing 
plans.  The workers demanded to be made permanent 
hires.  An oil services security manager told us that 
the governor of Bayelsa State flew to the area and 
successfully negotiated the hostages\' release, taking 
the expatriates off the rig in his helicopter. 
 
4. (SBU) Tonte Senibo, Corporate Affairs Officer for 
Forasol, confirmed Wednesday morning that the situation 
occurred on a rig the company managed and that the 
dispute was over wages.  She said all persons held 
against their will were released unharmed and taken to 
a hotel in Bayelsa State.  She expected them to be 
flown to Port Harcourt by 1400 on Wednesday, July 21. 
 
5. (SBU) Senibo stressed that this was a labor matter, 
and added that in the three years Forasol has been 
working in Nigeria, the company has never had a dispute 
with a local community, as was widely reported 
yesterday.  She did note that Nigerian naval vessels 
regularly patrol the waters in which the company works. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT:  We commented in reftel that 
community conflicts in Nigeria occur in many isolated 
areas beyond the normal purview of Nigeria watchers; 
labor unrest is equally indiscriminate in regard to 
location and size of employer.  The speed at which this 
incident was resolved by the affected company and the 
state governor was encouraging, and perhaps reflects 
the realization by officials of the need to end such 
delicate situations quickly, before the potential for 
violence increases.  END COMMENT.

Classified By: Consul General Brian Browne for reasons 1.4 (c). 
 
1. (S/NF) The Mission thanks its colleagues in INR for their 
kind encouragement of continued reporting efforts on the 
Niger Delta. Per your request, we have an update on reftels. 
 
2. (S/NF) Captain Ogunjumi, former Commanding Officer (CO) of 
the Nigerian Naval Station (NNS) in Warri, left his post in 
January 2004 and is now attending the Indian Naval War 
College.  Captain J. A. Ajani has replaced him.  In 
conversations with PolOff and EconOff, Ogunjumi did not name 
illegal oil bunkering cartels or shed light on actors 
involved in the theft.  We believe cartels are run by 
international organized crime groups and senior Nigerian 
government officials and businessmen.  However, their 
identities are unknown to us at this time.  We do know that 
militants hired to facilitate the illegal bunkering were, in 
Ogunjumi\'s estimation, 90% Ijaw and a combination of 
Itsekiri, Urhobos, Yorubas, and Igbos.  A credible source 
informed us on July 1, 2004 of a Lebanese-Nigerian bunkerer 
named FNU Daaboul who was deported in April at President 
Obasanjo\'s instruction.  Our source tells us that Daaboul, a 
Lebanese Christian from Kano, but recently based in Apapa, 
Lagos, had been involved in the illicit activity since 
General Shagari\'s time.  Allegedly, Daaboul was deported 
after failing to heed official warning to end his illegal 
bunkering activities.  Only his son has been allowed to 
remain in Lagos.  Daaboul now reportedly resides in Lebanon. 
His family originates from northern Lebanon. 
 
3. (S/NF) In reference to the ships that were released, 
Ogunjumi told us that he received a \"phone call from Abuja\" 
ordering the release.  He said that a common excuse was that 
they were inadvertently omitted from the day\'s registry of 
authorized legal bunkering ships from NNPC.  However, he 
refuted this assertion by questioning why these ships would 
anchor 50 miles offshore during the day and creep nearer to 
shore at night if they were engaged in a legal activity.  He 
would not say which individuals owned the ships, but did say 
the cargoes were owned by Nigerians.  The two vessels he was 
forced to release were named \"British Progress\" and 
\"Prosperity.\"  The \"British Progress\" had a British crew, 
which he held for four days before superiors in Abuja told 
him to release the ship.  A vessel named \"African Pride\" with 
18 Russian, 2 Georgian, and 1 Romanian crew members was 
officially seized in October 2003 and was registered in 
Liberia.  Ogunjumi told us the cargo was owned by a Nigerian. 
 At the time of our meeting in December 2003, Ogunjumi had 
officially seized 8 ships, including the \"African Pride.\"  We 
do not know at this time specifics regarding the ownership 
and registry of vessels; nor who operates and owns barges. 
We cannot give answers to other questions raised in ref A at 
this time. 
 
4.  (S/NF)  In response to ref B, we cannot give further 
information at this time.  PolOffs visited the region in June 
2004, but were unable to meet with the current Naval 
Commander, Ajani, or the Assistant Commissioner of Police in 
Warri.  PolOff will visit the region again to meet with these 
two individuals, amongst others, and will seek to answers 
questions raised by INR.

SUBJECT:  REMEMBERING DR. RALPH J. BUNCHE 
 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  In a fitting tribute to the late Dr. 
Ralph Johnson Bunche, Nobel Peace Prize winner and 
distinguished African-American diplomat, the Public 
Affairs Section of the U.S. Consulate General, Lagos, 
recently concluded our yearlong program commemorating 
the 100th anniversary of his birth.  Initiated in 2003, 
the program reached over 1,400 Nigerians in 4 states 
We employed this program to advance two key Mission 
Performance Plan (MPP) goals - promoting democratic 
practices and institutions and encouraging peaceful 
conflict resolution.  Kudos for our colleagues in the 
Graphics Department of the  Shultz Center; they 
provided an excellent Bunche exhibit which we 
incorporated into our successful outreach efforts. 
Please visit our website at 
http://nigeria.usembassy.gov for additional program 
coverage. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) Joining people the world over, our yearlong 
Bunche tribute recognized the life and legacy of a 
great American statesman.  As part of this initiative, 
PAS Lagos organized 4 events to pay homage to the life, 
work, vision, and times of Bunche.  These events took 
place at the following locations: 
 
  A) IWO: at Bowen University (7/24/03) 
  B)   LAGOS: at Nigerian Institute of International 
     Affairs (10/30/2003) 
C)   ENUGU: at Community Resource Center  (2/20/04) 
D)   ABEOKUTA: at Southwest Resource Center (6/30/04). 
 
3.   (U) A summary of the full program follows. 
 
A) IWO: BOWEN UNIVERSITY, JULY 30, 2003 
 
On Thursday July 24, 2003, the first PAS Lagos 
centenary celebration of Bunche, drew an audience of 
over 800 people to Bowen University, one of Nigeria\'s 
crop of new private institutions. The audience included 
a high-level delegation of Nigerian public officials, 
Vice Chancellors, Rectors, faculty, students, from 
surrounding institutions in southwest Nigeria, to the 
semi-rural town of Iwo, Osun State.  Held in a 
predominantly Muslim area, the event also hosted the 
traditional Muslim leader of the town, the Oluwo of 
Iwo, and his council members. 
 
The program included a screening of the documentary 
film Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey. We commissioned 
a paper by Professor Alaba Ogunsanwo of the Political 
Science Department, University of Lagos.  Ogunsanwo 
focused on Bunche\'s exemplary life of public service; 
the Lagos PAO offered remarks on Bunche\'s legacy from 
the American perspective. 
 
COMMENT: Within Nigeria\'s growing democracy, private 
universities are seen as representing a renaissance of 
quality education in the country.  PAS Lagos is 
enthusiastic about collaborative events with private 
universities in Nigeria, which are a critical component 
of our strategy to advance US interests in Nigeria 
particularly in supporting the democratic dispensation. 
 
B) LAGOS: NIGERIAN INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, 
OCTOBER 24, 2003 
 
Held on United Nations Day at the prestigious Nigerian 
Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), our second 
program reached Nigerians from all walks of life - the 
diplomatic corps, academics, civic and business 
leaders, among others.  The program also featured a 
roundtable discussion Ambassador Hamzat Ahmadu chaired 
the discussion and former Minister of Education, 
Professor Babs Fafunwa, was our keynote speaker. 
Professor Fafunwa served with Dr. Bunche at the United 
Nations.  In an effort to reach younger, wider 
audiences in Nigeria, more than 100 students attended 
the program from 7 Lagos area schools. 
 
Underscoring the importance of the tribute, Dr. Joy U. 
Ogwu, NIIA Director-General flew in from the UN General 
Assembly to participate in the program.  Mr. Finjap 
Njinga, Director of the United Nations Information 
Center, Lagos, read a statement commemorating the work 
of Bunche by United Nations Secretary-General Kofi A. 
Annan. 
 
The panel presentation paid tribute to the late Dr. 
Bunche\'s legacy as an international diplomat and 
statesman, and included first-hand stories of work with 
Bunche while he was at the United Nations. 
Specifically, Bunche was noted for his tireless work on 
behalf of negotiating an armistice agreement between 
Israel and four Arab neighbors, in addition to his 
promotion of decolonization on the African continent in 
the 1950s and 1960s. 
 
RESULTS:  The event drew 500 people, a large diverse 
audience of diplomats, educators, local government 
officials and students -- many of who had not heard of 
Dr. Bunche prior to the event.  Numerous local media 
outlets were present, which resulted in coverage in 
Lagos-area newspapers and on Lagos-area radio 
stations.. The CG, PAO and CAO each received comments 
from participants, inquiring about Bunche, his legacy, 
and most importantly his role in shaping international 
policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
 
ENUGU: COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER, FEBRUARY 20, 2004 
 
Representatives from the Lagos PAS provided a 
presentation at the Enugu Community Resource Center 
(CRC) celebrating the life and contributions of Dr. 
Bunche. The program included a PowerPoint presentation 
on prominent African Americans, a documentary on the 
career and life of Dr. Bunche, a poster show of Dr. 
Bunche, a robust question and answer session, and a 
closing reception. Approximately 60 contacts, including 
prominent Nigerian author Cyprian Ekwensi and former 
governor of Enugu State Chief C. C. Onoh, were in 
attendance. 
 
RESULTS: PAS used its convening power to draw prominent 
individuals to the program.  In so doing, we helped to 
put the Enugu Community Resource Center on the map. 
Several of our contacts marveled at the USG-supplied 
technology center and promised to return to the Enugu 
CRC. During a fascinating question and answer session, 
issues discussed included the current state of 
Nigeria\'s educational system, approaches to reversing 
Nigeria\'s brain-drain, ways in which to strengthen the 
Nigerian film industry, and how Enugu can benefit from 
future U.S. programming. Participants were most 
appreciative of our efforts and urged us to provide 
additional programs to Enugu State. 
 
D) ABEOKUTA: SOUTHWEST RESOURCE CENTER, JUNE 30, 2004 
 
On Wednesday, June 30, the Abeokuta Southwest Resource 
Center (SRC), in collaboration with PAS hosted the 
final commemorative program to honor the life and times 
of Dr. Bunche.  Over 100 guests filled the center\'s 
auditorium to participate in the program, the final PAS 
tribute to this remarkable man.  The program honored 
Bunche with an educational poster show, the screening 
of the documentary about his life and work. Center 
Director Tunde Kuku and Lagos PAO offered brief 
remarks. The Anthill Arts Foundation of Lagos provided 
a colorful display of artwork to honor Bunche.  This 
artwork was also done to mark the recent observance of 
the International Day of the African Child. 
 
RESULTS: Guests commented on the educational nature of 
the program, and requested additional programs be 
hosted by the Abeokuta SRC.  Program participants 
included the Honorable Commissioner for Information, 
Ogun State, Mr. Miran Malaolu, as well as assembled 
dignitaries from local colleges and universities. 
Media presence was also strong, and included reporters 
from This Day, New Age, Punch, Vanguard, NTA, O.G.T.V, 
Daily Independent, Comet, Champion Newspapers, Ogun 
State Broadcasting, National Interest Newspapers, 
Tribune, and Daily Times. 
 
4. (U) COMMENT:  The yearlong Bunche program reached 
diverse Nigerian audiences, in a number of different 
geographical locations and in unique settings: 
 
  A)   We reached over 1,400 total participants including 
     Christians, Muslims and traditional practitioners. 
B)   Strong media coverage attained. 
C)   Target audiences included youth groups, secondary 
and university students, school administrators, civic 
leaders, local government officials and well-known 
cultural icons. 
D)   Events planned in 4 different cities across 
Nigeria\'s south/east and south/west geopolitical zones. 
E)   The Enugu CRC and Abeokuta SRC are both planned to 
become American Corners networks in Nigeria in FY 2005. 
In addition, we have provided the CRC Enugu with a 
collection of educational advising texts; we plan to 
furnish the Southwest Resource Center in Abeokuta with 
a set as well. Through working with both groups, PAS 
Lagos established broad relationships that will in turn 
enhance future programs. 
 
5. (U) COMMENT: We are particularly appreciative of the 
support we received from the Shultz Center\'s Graphics 
Department; they developed a poster exhibit featuring 
Dr. Bunche and readily shared their files with us.  We 
were able to incorporate their work into our outreach 
efforts. 
 
 
6. (U) CONCLUSION:  The PAS Lagos Ralph J. Bunche year- 
long commemorative program was highly successful at 
achieving its core objective of educating Nigerians 
about he life and times, social and political impact of 
the famous African-American statesman. In addition, 
audience participation and interest was lively at each 
event, and PAS Lagos was able to distribute a large 
amount of information packets about Bunche.  Moreover, 
we advanced our MPP goals in the area of strengthening 
democratic practices and institutions and supporting 
peaceful conflict resolution through this innovative 
program. The program underscored the positive role of 
African-Americans in U.S. diplomacy, and also provided 
Nigerians with vital information about U.S. efforts in 
support of African independence.

1. (SBU) Summary: According to preliminary but credible 
reports, a Pan African Airlines helicopter with an 
American citizen and three other people on board lost 
radio contact at 2:30 a.m. local time after leaving a 
deepwater oil rig. Air and surface searches are being 
conducted but thus far there has been no contact with 
or sighting of the helicopter. Prior to losing contact 
the helicopter apparently reported mechanical 
difficulties. According to our best information, the 
Amcit on board was one of the helicopter pilots. Pan 
African\'s parent company, Air Logistics, has gone to 
the Amcit\'s home and has remained with the family 
during the crisis. There is no indication of any foul 
play. Post is tracking the incident and working to 
confirm details. End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Chevron has reported to post that a Pan 
African Airlines medevac helicopter with two pilots 
picked up an injured Nigerian employee of Transocean, 
Inc. and another passenger from the Setco deepwater rig 
early this morning. (Transocean is drilling a deepwater 
well for Chevron at the Setco rig.) Chevron reported 
that the helicopter was headed to Port Harcourt but 
signaled it was returning to the rig apparently due to 
mechanical problems. The last radio message from the 
helicopter was received at 2:30 a.m. local time. 
 
3. (SBU) Pan African has reported that one of the two 
pilots was an American. Pan African\'s parent company, 
Air Logistics, has gone to the Amcit\'s home and has 
remained with the family during the crisis. 
 
4. (SBU) We have been informed that air and surface 
searches are being conducted. The Nigerian government 
is not actively involved in the searches, but Chevron 
reports that the upstream subsidiary of NNPC has been 
notified of the incident. Chevron reports that there is 
no indication of criminal activity.

SUBJECT: SCRATCH CARD FEVER 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: For the past month, between 5 and 10 
million MTN mobile phone scratch cards have been held 
up in Lagos ports over a payment dispute between MTN 
and the Nigerian Customs Service.  In the country\'s 
cash economy and largely wireless telephony 
environment, scratch cards are an important component 
of the local telecoms market.  MTN has agreed to pay 
indemnity charges incurred since the dispute started, 
but will not pay arbitrary/illegal penalties.   As the 
situation gradually clears up, scratch cards are slowly 
making their way back into the market.  In the meantime 
the Nigerian consumer has been the main loser.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) Pre-paid recharge cards - also known as \"scratch 
cards\" - are the most reliable means of payment for 
Nigeria\'s estimated 3-4 million wireless subscribers. 
In a mostly cash based economy, the scratch card system 
works.  Along the streets of Lagos, hundreds of card 
hawkers sell the pre-paid cards (with a numbered code 
on the back).  MTN\'s wireless clients buy the cards, 
scratch off a security strip to expose the numbered 
code, and call a special phone number and dial in the 
code to place a call.  The prepayment system ensures 
that telecom companies and consumers alike need not 
worry about outstanding bills.  It is a pay as you go 
system. 
 
3. (U) Since early June, MTN scratch cards have been a 
hot but scarce commodity.  Normally, MTN sells 5-10 
million scratch cards monthly in Nigeria.  Media 
reports and the current selling price confirm the 
scarcity of cards on the streets and in MTN stores and 
distribution (\"Friendship\") centers.  Scratch cards 
valued at naira (N) 750 are being sold between N800 and 
N900, and N1500 cards are between N1600 and N1900. 
Some angry MTN clients believe the shortage is a 
moneymaking contrivance of MTN.  In late June, the 
National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), even 
held a press conference stating that its members are 
avid phone users and are prepared to \"lock up\" MTN 
stores across the country to protest the shortage and 
higher prices. 
 
4. (U) Since MTN\'s customer-base includes top 
government officials and MTN has the largest mobile 
network in the country, the GON (including President 
Olesegun Obasanjo) has noted the card shortage.  A 
recent investigation by the Nigerian Communications 
Commission (NCC) held MTN responsible for the scarcity. 
The company was ordered to increase the supply of 
cards.  However, the NCC also noted that millions of 
MTN cards were being held up in Lagos ports by the 
Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). 
 
5. (SBU) During a recent meeting with Econoff and 
EconSpec, MTN Chief Corporate Affairs Executive, Joke 
Giwa, said one month\'s supply of scratch cards is on 
hold in the Lagos ports.  According to Giwa, the 
shortage began more than a month ago when port 
officials demanded \"other charges\" that MTN considered 
improper.  When MTN refused to pay, port officials 
began delaying paperwork and holding up shipments.  The 
port charges on the consignments have been accumulating 
with MTN incurring fees totaling N1 billion ($7.52 
million) as of July 23, though the company owes NCS a 
total of N3 billion ($22.56 million).  Giwa said MTN is 
willing to pay legitimate government fees like import 
duties.  The company has already paid more than N7 
billion ($52.63 million) in legal taxes and duties 
since the beginning of 2004. 
 
6. (SBU) During the NCC investigation, MTN did not 
blame the NCS but rather told GON officials that 
production had been on track, that sufficient supplies 
had been sent to Nigeria, and that the company has 
documentation to prove it.  A review of MTN\'s 
documentation and a visit to its warehouses and 
friendship centers confirmed the hold up was the ports. 
With the spotlight on the ports, the NCS backed down 
and has begun to release the scratch cards.  Progress 
has been slow, but the cards are being distributed in 
Lagos\' streets and elsewhere. 
 
7. (U) Holding press conferences, MTN advised its 
customers not to pay a premium for the cards.  MTN also 
suggested that its clients take advantage of MTN\'s new 
Virtual Top-Up (VTU) system, an electronic recharge 
service. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment: South African MTN is an easy target 
of criticism and unwanted attention in Nigeria.  It is 
the number one mobile service provider in the lucrative 
Nigerian telecoms market.  Its profits from the country 
are known and reported.  As a foreign-owned firm, it is 
often attacked as an outsider that takes money away 
from Nigeria.  Giwa suggested MTN would welcome another 
successful international player in the Nigerian GSM 
market.  An additional international presence would 
deflect attention from MTN and result in more 
competition and better service to subscribers.  End 
comment.

NIGERIA 
 
1.(U) Classified by CG Brian Browne for reason 1.4(d) 
 
2. (U) SUMMARY. In a July 22 meeting with Ambassador 
John Campbell, Ocean Energy Managing Director Raymond 
Marchand stated that the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC) contracting process was protracted 
and involved many duplicative steps but was not 
corrupt. Marchand related that the chronic violence 
in the Delta did not affect Ocean Energy\'s 
operations, which focus on deep-water oil patches. He 
was proud that Ocean Energy also was at the forefront 
among oil companies in hiring Nigerians to important 
positions (i.e., local content) and in funding 
community development projects (CDAs). END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (U) Ambassador John Campbell met with Raymond 
Marchand, Managing Director of Ocean Energy, in Lagos 
on July 22, 2004. CG Brian Browne, Ocean Energy 
Drilling Manager David Halloway, and ConOff Bill 
Murad (notetaker) also attended. Ocean Energy is the 
international arm of the American firm, Devon Energy 
Corporation. 
 
-------- 
SECURITY 
-------- 
 
4. (U) When asked for his approach to security risks 
and outbreaks of violence in oil-producing areas, 
Marchand explained that Ocean Energy\'s risks were 
minimized by the fact that its focus was on deep- 
water drilling, 100 miles out to sea. Headquartered 
in Lagos, Ocean Energy further minimized its risks by 
maintaining only a skeletal, two-person office near 
Port Harcourt. Marchand added that, even under the 
most dangerous conditions, \"business always 
continues,\" and that, for Nigeria to be successful, 
\"everyone knows that the oil business must go on.\" 
 
-------- 
RED TAPE 
-------- 
 
5. (C) Asked about corruption in the oil contracting 
process, Marchand said the Nigerian system was more 
cumbersome than corrupt. In fact, Marchand asserted 
the system, which involves a series of decisional 
reviews as an item moves up the NNPC hierarchy, was 
created to check corruption. The truth is that the 
Nigerians do not trust each other and closely vet the 
decisions of other parts of the NNPC bureaucracy. 
Ocean Energy succeeds by hiring former civil servants 
and experienced private-sector Nigerians who know the 
system well. For example, Ocean Energy recently 
navigated the National Petroleum Investment 
Management Services (NAPIM) approval process in 13 
months instead of the customary 18-24 months needed 
to approve the drilling of a well. Marchand credits a 
culturally savvy staff, led by a former NAPIM 
minister, with reducing Ocean Energy\'s waiting 
period. He mentioned that the current NNPC Managing 
Director, Engineer Funsho Kupolukun, was much better 
than his predecessor, Jackson Gaius-Obaseki. Obaseki 
was self-absorbed and paid insufficient attention to 
the internal workings of the NNPC. Kupolukun, on the 
other hand, is well-versed, involved, and has made 
the NNPC perform more efficiently, though many 
bottlenecks still remain. He said that other oil 
companies often hurt themselves by grousing and 
attempting to push the Nigerians to change their 
system. This will only make the process more 
dilatory, he stated.

6. (U) Marchand explained Ocean Energy\'s successful 
approach to local content and community development. 
While law requires 50% local content, approximately 
75% of Ocean Energy personnel are Nigerian. The 
company\'s drilling team is composed entirely of 
Nigerians except for four x-pat managers who rotate 
in pairs every four weeks. The entire team of 
seismologists who decide where to drill is Nigerian. 
Further, Ocean Energy spends up to $2 million per 
year in local training and CDPs despite the fact that 
they are not yet producing (Oil companies are 
required to fund CDPs but only after actual 
production). Ocean Energy\' community involvmnt is 
even more remarkable given that its deep-water focus 
makes it less vulnerable to local unrest. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. (U) COMMENT. Ocean Energy\'s model of working 
within the Nigerian system, using a largely Nigerian 
staff, and concentrating on deep-sea drilling has 
been successful. While other companies that operate 
closer to shore may not be able to share Ocean 
Energy\'s sense of relief on security isues, they 
perhaps can take a lesson from Marchand and his crew 
on how to navigate the NNPC bureaucracy. END COMMENT.

2005 BAN ON CARD IMPORTS 
 
REF: (A) 04 LAGOS 1562, (B) 04 LAGOS 1364, (C) 04 ABUJA

1. (SBU) Summary: As the GON\'s January 1, 2005 import 
ban on recharge cards draws near, the Nigerian 
Communications Commission is beginning to license 
companies to produce the cards locally. Wary of the 
reliability of most local card producers, major 
Nigerian telecom companies are exploring alternatives 
to recharge cards. Virtual-top-up and electronic 
vouchering seem to be the favored options.  End 
summary. 
 
2. (U) Readily available \"scratch cards\" or recharge 
cards account for much of the success of the Nigerian 
GSM (Ref A), fixed wireless, and international call 
markets.  The cards allow customers to pay for calls up- 
front - a practical means of communication and payment 
in Nigeria\'s largely cash-based economy. 
 
3. (SBU) In May, the Communications Minister announced 
an import ban on scratch cards effective January 1, 
2005.  In a recent conversation with Econoff, 
government-owned Nigerian Security Printing and Minting 
Company (the Mint) official Don Etim welcomed the ban 
and confirmed the Mint\'s interest in getting into 
scratch card production.  The Mint sees itself as well- 
positioned to enter the market since it already prints 
secure paper products such as currencies and entry 
visas (Ref B).  Etim said the NCC will license four 
companies to manufacture scratch cards in Nigeria. 
 
4. (U) The NCC, however, apparently has not yet decided 
to limit the number of licenses.  MTN Chief Corporate 
Affairs Executive, Joke Giwa, and Odu\'a Telecoms Ltd. 
(Oduatel) General Manager, Olusegun Owolabi, told 
Econoff in separate meetings that they had not heard 
about such a limitation.  Owolabi asserted the NCC is 
likely to consider all applications for production 
before announcing the number of licensees. 
 
5. (U) Recently, the NCC announced 27 recharge card 
manufacturers or distributors met the criteria to pre- 
qualify for production licenses.  These companies have 
until August 9, 2004 to submit applications for the 
next and final stage of \"processing the applications\". 
 
6. (U) While telecom company officials we talked to do 
not trust Nigerian local producers of scratch cards, 
they also do not seem concerned about the ban.  They 
are confident about identifying alternatives to scratch 
cards.  Industry sources have reported possible 
substitutes like MTN\'s \"Virtual Top-Up\" (VTU) 
technology, and electronic vouchering systems.  A pilot 
VTU scheme is now available to selected MTN customers. 
VTU users are expected to hold bank accounts through 
which electronic funds are drawn to replenish 
customers\' calling cards. 
 
7. (SBU) Telecom contacts, however, recognize the 
limitation of the VTU in a cash economy like Nigeria, 
and that electronic vouchering may be more appealing to 
most subscribers.  MTS First Wireless (MTS) plans to 
use such a system.  Customers will buy calling time 
from a company-licensed dealer.  They will be given 
vouchers with code numbers that customers will key into 
a phone to recharge minutes.  French company Ingenico 
is reportedly partnering with Chams Nigeria Ltd. for a 
similar system. 
 
8. (SBU) In the meantime, most operators seem to have 
stockpiled cards in anticipation of the ban.  (Comment: 
The recent shortage of MTN scratch cards (Ref A) is 
unrelated to this stockpiling.  MTN is one of the few 
companies we spoke with not stockpiling cards.) 
Oduatel has a one-year supply of recharge cards in 
country, while MTS technical engineers said the company 
has enough recharge cards in stock to tide them over 
until it adopts an alternative means of payment. 
 
9. (SBU) MTN\'s Giwa said the company will consider 
investing in its own production facility in Nigeria if 
no credible manufacturer or supplier of secure recharge 
cards emerges by November of this year.  Giwa welcomed 
interest by U.S. companies.  (Comment: MTN\'s 
traditional scratch card provider, Nitecrest, is one of 
the 27 applicants for a production license in Nigeria.) 
Giwa said she questions the product quality of any 
company already operating in the secure printing 
business in Nigeria.  MTN\'s main concern is ensuring a 
secure product, a factor of importance to MTN\'s 
credibility. 
 
10. (U) Nigeria\'s four licensed GSM operators import an 
estimated 10-20 million scratch cards per month that 
generate naira 10-20 billion ($76 million to $152 
million) in monthly revenues.  In addition, millions of 
long distance, international, and fixed wireless 
recharge cards are imported for use in the local 
market.  The recharge card ban could disrupt the flow 
of billions of dollars in revenue and the life style of 
millions of telecoms customers across Nigeria if 
Nigerian producers cannot supply the market and 
alternative means of payment do not take hold soon. 
 
11. (SBU) Comment:  The telecoms sector is Nigeria\'s 
most profitable one after the oil sector.  Its growth 
potential is evident.  (MTN alone projects a subscriber 
base of 14 million for itself.  It now serves 2.3 
million in the country.) The sector is fast-paced and 
ever changing; innovation may obviate need for recharge 
cards in the not-too-distant future.  Whether the 
recharge card ban will foster local production or the 
use of substitutes will be another Nigerian test of the 
infant industry argument that underpins the numerous 
bans instituted by the Obasanjo administration (Ref C). 
If this ban follows suit with the others, local 
producers by themselves will not be able to take up the 
slack.  Unless substitutes to scratch cards also become 
available, this ban will likely have a negative effect. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: MORE OPTIONS FOR NIGERIAN TELECOMS 
SUBSCRIBERS 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Two Nigerian telecoms companies (MTS 
First Wireless and Oduatel) will begin services this 
month. MTS expects to attract many customers due to its 
unique area code numbering system and its innovative 24- 
hour, zero dial-up internet service. Oduatel expects to 
carve a unique niche by developing a presence in 
Nigeria\'s remote villages now shunned by other private 
telecoms operators.  End summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
MTS First Wireless Rolls Out 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) MTS First Wireless, Nigeria\'s third national 
long distance carrier, plans to roll out its CDMA 2000 
IX phone network in Lagos, August 9. The company 
launched its long distance operations (LDO) service in 
May and is targeting 250,000 subscribers in Lagos, 
Abuja, and Port Harcourt in the upcoming rollout. 
 
3. (U) MTS, also one of Nigeria\'s first mobile 
telephone companies, will establish both a wireless 
phone network and an integrated internet service 
network. Richmond Aggrey, the company\'s chief 
executive, is enthusiastic about its prospects in 
Nigeria\'s booming telecoms market. Encouraged by a 
license that allows MTS to operate both fixed wireless 
and mobile telephones, the company expects much 
patronage, given its unique area code numbering system. 
According to Aggrey, MTS numbers will enable 
subscribers within a particular geographical zone to 
travel anywhere in that zone without having to 
reprogram their phones. (Note: there are six zones in 
Nigeria, MTS is licensed in three. End note.)  This is 
not possible on the networks of Nigeria\'s other major 
fixed wireless phone service providers whose 
subscribers are restricted to major city centers like 
Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja. 
 
4. (U) Reuben Mouka, Head of MTS Corporate Affairs, 
said the company\'s rollout will cover Victoria Island, 
Ikoyi, Isolo, Festac, Apapa and Surulere, the main 
districts in Lagos. He added that these locations were 
used for the company\'s test run.  During the test 
period, MTS subscribers benefited from free calls 
within the MTS network, while calls to non-MTS GSM 
numbers were charged N24.50k ($0.18). These rates will 
be in effect until further notice. 
 
5. (U) Comment: The Nigerian telecoms market is large 
and profitable.   MTS will likely acquire a significant 
share of this market. Providing 24-hour internet 
service to subscribers at a flat rate of N4,000 to 
N7,000 ($30 - $53) will be an important part of MTS\'s 
marketing strategy. Currently, the other operators 
provide this service on a per hour basis and dial-up 
fees range from N4,500 to N25,000 ($34 - $188) for 30 
to 60 hours during on or off peak periods. End comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Oduatel Also Rolls Out, Interconnects With Major PTOs 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. (U) Following its recent signing of a $20 million 
loan agreement with U.S. EXIM Bank, Odu\'a 
Telecommunications Limited (Oduatel) has concluded 
plans to interconnect with major private telecoms 
operators (PTOs) in Lagos. Odu\'a anticipates a full 
rollout in September. 
 
7. (U) The company\'s delay connecting to key telecoms 
operators like MTN, VMobile, Multilinks and Starcomms 
in Lagos had held back Oduatel\'s operations in the five 
southwestern Nigerian states in which it has a license 
to operate, according to Segun Owolabi, Oduatel\'s 
General Manager (Oduatel is wholly owned by these five 
southwestern states - Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Oyo and Ekiti). 
Oduatel earlier had tried interconnecting with the 
GON\'s Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), but 
was disappointed since its subscribers were unable to 
connect to the NITEL network. Oduatel\'s new strategy 
calls for it to interconnect with each of the other 
PTOs in Lagos from its new base station at Ota in Ogun 
state. 
 
8. (U) Oduatel has 13 base stations across the five 
states, including Ibadan (4), Ekiti (2), Ota, and 
Agbara.  (The last two are close to Lagos and have one 
base station each). With its interconnectivity problem 
resolved, Oduatel expects to become the major telecoms 
provider in the remote southwestern villages that the 
Lagos-based wireless PTOs cannot reach. Owolabi is 
confident that Oduatel\'s subscription will grow 
rapidly.  He claims state government offices have 
indicated their willingness to join to the Oduatel 
network. At present, its subscriber-base is growing 
partly because of its recent interconnection with MTN, 
which spent about N75 million ($563,910) to ensure that 
its subscribers can call Oduatel\'s network, he said. 
9. (U) Like most PTOs, Oduatel will rely heavily on the 
prepaid system of payment, using scratch cards. 
Oduatel\'s Owolabi said that because of the dominance of 
the government sector in Oduatel\'s operations area, 
calls from telephones in government offices would be 
prepaid to forestall default. Oduatel may consider 
corporate customers like banks for post-paid services. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Grapples With Prejudiced Ownership Structure 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10 (U) Despite Oduatel\'s optimism, some of its telecoms 
customers are skeptical about its long-term success. 
Now wholly government owned, Oduatel was separated from 
its parent company, Odu\'a Investment Holdings, 
effective July 1, and is seeking new investors, local 
or international. Odu\'a Investment plans to sell at 
least 70 percent of its shares in the company, 
according to Owolabi.  Swedtel of Sweden and a Chinese 
company have expressed interest in Oduatel. Owolabi 
said Oduatel may seek to raise funds in the capital 
market in 2005, after at least six months of actually 
operating. 
 
11 (U) Comment: A recent press report of a change in 
the Odu\'a management team, underscored the need for the 
state governments to \"privatize\" the company. The owner- 
states\' governors had sacked the Chairman and the Group 
Managing Director of Odu\'a Investment and Oduatel. 
Owolabi explained to Econoff and Econspec that the 
former state governors (from a different party than the 
current governors in the states) had appointed the 
executives. Though both executives have since left the 
organization, their replacements (usually political 
appointees) have yet to be appointed. End Comment.

Resettlement Plan Released 
-- Nigerian Economic Summit Group Leaders Support 
Economic Reform 
-- Local Professor/Journalist Confirms Obasanjo\'s

--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Maritime Stakeholders Support Cabotage Law 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (U) The Nigerian Cabotage Law 2003 (reftel) 
continues to generate interest from various 
stakeholders. At a recent forum focusing on 
\"Implementation Guidelines of the Cabotage Law: the 
Role of Financial Institutions\", domestic stakeholders 
claimed the law will help the Nigerian maritime 
industry. Many Nigerians believe effective 
implementation of the law could bolster the proposed 
new National Shipping Policy of the GON, which is being 
formulated by the National Assembly and the Transport 
Ministry in conjunction with some private sector 
operators. (A new shipping policy would update the 
National Shipping Policy Decree 1987.  It identified 
Nigeria\'s maritime interests and established the 
Nigerian Maritime Authority as the implementing agency 
of the policy.) 
 
3. (SBU) Most Nigerian maritime operators believe that 
opportunities exist for collaborations and partnerships 
with US maritime technical experts. They believe there 
is a need to build indigenous capacity in shipbuilding, 
port management, dry dock services and maritime 
security. They also believe that establishing direct 
shipping route between the two countries would promote 
rapid development of the maritime sector and thus 
validate the enactment of the cabotage act. 
 
4. (U) Dissenting voices among local maritime operators 
have criticized of the implementation of the policy. 
They claim the Transport Ministry has granted waivers 
to most foreign firms for their vessels to operate 
under the cabotage law. They believe these vessels are 
being allowed to operate in areas now legally reserved 
for Nigerian-owned vessels. (The Minister of Transport 
may waive provisions of the Cabotage Act if there is no 
Nigerian-owned vessel suitable and available to perform 
a specific activity.  Likewise, the Minister may issue 
waivers if no Nigerian shipbuilder can construct a 
vessel of a particular type and size needed. Foreign- 
owned or foreign-crewed vessels participating in the 
domestic coastal trade must be licensed.  Persons 
residing in Nigeria may apply for licenses on behalf of 
a foreign-owned vessels if waiver and other 
administrative criteria are met.) 
 
5. (U) An official of Italy\'s Grimaldi Lines told us 
that local maritime operators lack capacity in the 
areas in which most of the foreign waivers have been 
granted. He said that although local capacity may be 
enhanced by the implementation of the cabotage law over 
time, they currently cannot meet the requirements of 
the Nigerian shipping industry. Foreign vessels will 
thus remain relevant for some time.  It is in 
recognition of this fact that the waiver clause was 
added to the law. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The cabotage law requires majority 
Nigerian ownership of almost all intercoastal shipping 
concerns.  Since US firms supply workboats and trawlers 
to Nigeria, this law could have a negative impact on 
our commercial interests in this sector.  Additionally, 
the waiver regime is susceptible to political 
interference.  That possibility may make many 
investors, foreign and domestic, reluctant to play in 
the sector.  Belgian and Dutch investors have told us 
that the law, at best, will not encourage investment, 
and most likely, will cause shipping companies to 
rethink their investment plans. End comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
WAGP Environmental Impact Assessment and Resettlement 
Plan Released 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (U) In June 2004 the West African Gas Pipeline 
Company and Chevron Nigeria Limited published Nigeria\'s 
final drafts of the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Resettlement 
Action Plan (RAP). The proposed WAGP will transport 
natural gas from Nigeria to Benin, Togo and Ghana.  In 
compliance with World Bank requirements, the general 
public now has 60 days to comment on the EIA and RAP. 
 
8. (U) The WAGP\'s EIA lists many potential benefits 
including infusion of funds into the Nigerian economy, 
development of the regional energy infrastructure and 
related economic development. On whole, the 
environmental impact will be positive.  The WAGP will 
reduce gas flaring and, concomitantly, air pollution 
and greenhouse gas emissions. Inducing end-users to 
switch to gas fuel from other fossil fuels will provide 
additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Potential negative environmental impacts involve 
conversion of farmland to pipeline easements; 
disturbance of habitats and changes to hydrology caused 
by trenching in wetlands; and changes in habitats, 
soils/sediments, topography, and hydrology associated 
with heavy equipment delivery. Many of these problems 
arise in the project\'s construction phase.  The EIA 
indicates that no permanent high severity negative 
impact will remain after planned mitigation measures 
are applied. No negative socioeconomic impacts of high 
severity are anticipated from the project. 
 
9. (U) The RAP states the WAGP will affect 23 
communities (about 2,500 land owners and tenants) in 
Ogun and Lagos states. All land owners and tenants have 
been contacted by the WAGP contract surveyors as well 
as the independent surveyors hired by the affected 
populations. The affected people were offered two 
options: in-kind or cash compensation. All chose cash 
compensation. The project also will adopt specific 
measures to minimize impacts. 
 
10. (U) Chevron representatives told EconOff that they 
expect World Bank approval of the project, as the EIA 
and RAP meet all of the Bank\'s project criteria. They 
said the local communities also support the project. 
Opposition to the WAGP comes primarily from one 
organization, Environmental Rights Action, they added. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Nigerian Economic Summit Group Leaders Support Economic 
Reform 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
11. (U) In a recent meeting with CG and Econoff 
(notetaker), the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) 
Executive Director and board members pledged continued 
support for economic reform in Nigeria.  The NESG 
agenda for the near future involves (1) capacity 
building, (2) lobbying on priority issues, and (3) 
increased research. 
 
12. (U) A priority area for NESG is business 
disincentives such as bureaucracy and regulatory 
constraints.  Chairman Mazi Sam I. Ohuabunwa relayed 
the group sentiment that it is important that the US 
mission in Nigeria and NESG continue to work together 
to ensure business growth, regulatory change, and 
economic reform. 
 
13. (U) The NESG expressed dismay over the newest DOS 
travel warning for Nigeria.  The warning \"ruffled 
feathers\" within the local business community and was 
seen as a slight by the US government.  They asserted 
the warning had caused several US companies to pull out 
of the joint CCA/NESG Conference scheduled for 
September in Abuja.  Most of all, they worried that the 
travel warning would discourage US trade and 
investment.  CG responded that the statement was not 
intended to stop travel to Nigeria, but to warn 
travelers of the real difficulties they would face in 
Nigeria.  Our top priority is the welfare of US 
citizens abroad, the CG stressed.  However the USG 
continues to encourage and promote trade and investment 
in Nigeria.  The greatest obstacle to US investors was 
not the travel warning but the frequent \"bureaucratic 
anomalies\" and opaque regulatory environment they find 
in Nigeria, he added. 
 
14. (U) FYI: The NESG was formed 11 years ago as an 
expression of private sector determination to reform 
Nigeria\'s economy.  Although the organization had a 
slow start, reviews from government and other agencies 
and companies illustrate that NESG has steadily 
enhanced its influence since its inception.  It is 
known as a growing presence in the country\'s economic 
policy topography. End FYI. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Local Professor/Journalist Confirms Obasanjo\'s Economic 
Dream Team Lacks Potential Clout 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
15. (SBU) The prolific and influential Lagos Business 
School (Pan-African University) professor, Pat Utomi, 
recently discussed the GON\'s economic team with the CG 
and Econoff (notetaker).  Utomi endorsed the widely- 
held view that the country\'s touted economic team lacks 
independent political power.  They are completely 
dependent on President Obasanjo to provide political 
muscle to push any reform forward.  However, having 
been appointed governor of the Central Bank, Charles 
Soludo may be carving out a niche for himself, Utomi 
commented. 
 
16. (SBU) Utomi said, given their lack of political 
clout, the team should have spent much more time 
building a constituency inside government and the 
private sector for their reform program.  Instead they 
have acted like technocrats, unmindful of the realities 
of Nigeria\'s political economy.  Team members are 
perceived as arrogant and unrealistic due to a head-in- 
the-clouds approach to the country\'s economic reform 
process.  While the team has the ear of the President, 
they are estranged from the rest of the system. 
Because of their lack of political and bureaucratic 
panache, Utomi predicted the team will have a very 
tough time obtaining the support needed for their 
reform measures.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA: ONE YEAR AWAY FROM CATEGORY 1? 
 
 
1.(SBU) Summary.  Visits to Lagos by FAA Senior 
Representative for Sub-Saharan Africa, Edward Jones, 
and the Department of Homeland Security Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) Program Managers, David 
K. Taylor and Ed Rao, again bring to the fore the 
possibility of Category 1 status for Nigeria.  In terms 
of safety and security, Nigeria still has months of 
work ahead to meet International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) and FAA requirements for Category 1 
status and to fly a Nigerian carrier directly to the 
US.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) During an August 3rd visit to Nigeria, FAA 
senior representative Jones and Nigerian Civil Aviation 
Authority official (NCAA) discussed FAA and ICAO 
recommendations that safety oversight responsibilities 
be separated from the Ministry of Aviation (MOA) and 
ceded to the NCAA.  The current organizational 
structure places the NCAA under the direct and close 
financial control and authority of MOA.  A requisite 
step in Nigeria\'s progress towards Category 1 status is 
the passage of a civil aviation bill that grants NCAA 
significant autonomy from the MOA. 
 
3. (SBU) Jones reviewed a draft Nigerian civil aviation 
bill that has been languishing in the National Assembly 
for more than a year.  He believes that, in its current 
form, this draft bill does not provide NCAA sufficient 
autonomy.  (A copy of the draft has been forwarded to 
FAA legal advisors who will provide an opinion on the 
draft bill within the next few weeks.)  Nigeria\'s 
acceptance of these recommendations and the subsequent 
passage of a new bill is likely to take time thus 
drawing out the country\'s safety preparations for 
Category 1.  Besides the lengthy process of approving a 
bill, MOA Isa Yuguda told Jones that the NCAA DG will 
never gain budgetary separation from the MOA even if 
aviation safety regulatory powers are ceded to NCAA. 
 
4. (SBU) The NCAA assures Jones that Nigeria will be 
ready for a Category 1 final review in October 2004. 
Even with swift passage of a curative aviation bill, 
Jones believes it will take somewhat longer primarily 
because of low salaries for inspectors and the 
resultant continuous turnover in personnel at this 
position.  (Comment: The timeline for safety 
preparation for Category 1 is actually much longer if 
we take into consideration the fact that current NCAA 
aviation safety regulations will also have to be 
reviewed to make sure they conform with the ICAO- 
compliant civil aviation bill once and if it passes.) 
 
5. (U) Security practices at Murtalla Mohammed 
International Airport (MMIA) are gauged to be about one 
year away from Category 1 compliance.  After their 
second visit to the Federal Airport Authority of 
Nigeria (FAAN) in as many months, TSA officials Taylor 
and Rao again left MMIA reporting deficiencies in 
FAAN\'s progress towards ICAO standards.  The TSA 
officials will be distributing a report of their 
findings.  In a June conversation with Ambassador 
Campbell, Taylor and Rao asserted that it would be 
optimistic to say FAAN could be ready in one year\'s 
time - even assuming no further bureaucratic 
interferences and other stumbling blocks that have 
plagued Category 1 preparation to date.  And FAAN would 
then require another 12 months of hand-holding by TSA 
to ensure continued compliance. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: The combined safety and security 
unpreparedness of Nigeria\'s civil aviation sector for 
ICAO approval indicates that Nigeria is unlikely to 
obtain Category 1 status within the next 365 days. 
Conversations with FAA and TSA officials reveal that 
Nigeria\'s aviation hurdles continue to be numerous and, 
to a large degree, organizational.  As a result, 
Nigerians will have to rely on foreign flag carriers 
for direct flights to the US for the foreseeable 
future.  End Comment.

1. (SBU) In response to the Central Bank of Nigeria\'s 
(CBN) new N25 billion capital base requirement (about 
USD 200 million), banks are forming strategic alliances 
through consolidations, mergers and acquisitions. Big 
banks are expected to comply fully, many smaller banks 
face the unwelcome choice of scurrying to acquire 
capital to meet the requirement or of merging with a 
larger institution that has greater bargaining power. 
Meanwhile, the value of bank shares has been declining 
as skittish investors take to the sidelines to watch 
the action of the market, and some customers of smaller 
banks have been moving deposits to safer large banks or 
to purchasing foreign currency. Although many observers 
believe the new directive will strengthen the Nigerian 
banking sector, it is causing short-term withdrawals 
from the banking system.  Many would like the CBN to 
buffer the shock of the new requirement by phasing it 
in over a number of years.  Senators of the National 
Assembly oppose the requirement, and intend to clip the 
CBN\'s wings.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Banks Give Public Appearance of Keeping Calm Over 
Financial Sector Reforms 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2. (SBU) Since July 6 when Central Bank Governor 
Charles Soludo proposed an increase in the capital base 
of commercial banks, Nigerian bank executives have been 
privately expressing anxiety, despite public statements 
indicating they are calm and confident about the 
future.  Since then, bank executives have been taking 
turns announcing alternative strategies for meeting the 
new capitalization requirement. Meanwhile, depositors 
at many banks are demonstrating their concern and 
showing no compunction about closing accounts at the 
smaller banks and transferring the funds to larger 
banks or purchasing foreign exchange. 
 
3. (SBU) A week after Saludo\'s announcement (ref A), a 
select group of bank chief executives (essentially of 
larger banks) agreed on Saludo\'s prescription for 
strengthening the banking sector.  However, many bank 
executives who did not participate in the discussion 
faulted the steep capitalization increase and the short 
deadline for compliance.  Esan Ogunleye, the Executive 
Secretary of the Chartered Institute of Bankers, for 
 
SIPDIS 
one, told EconSpec during a meeting last week that the 
institute intends to recommend to the CBN a reduction 
in the capital base requirement to 10 billion naira 
(about USD 80 million) for settlement banks (banks that 
clear checks for other banks) and 5 billion naira 
(about USD 40 million) for other banks.  Such action 
would bring Nigeria\'s banks on par with South African 
counterparts whose capital base equals about five 5 
billion naira, according to Ogunleye. 
 
4. (SBU) Most bank execs recognize the need to rebuild 
public confidence in the banking sector.  Some banks 
are advertising their resolve to meet the required 
capital base at minimum cost to stakeholders and to 
ensure the safety of customer funds.  Babajide Rogers 
of Gulf Bank, for example, has assured customers that 
deposits will not be lost whether banks merge or are 
acquired.  In a letter to customers, Bimbo Olashore of 
Leadbank likewise assured \"the bank\'s business will not 
be affected in any way or form\".  But the drop in bank 
share prices and the withdrawal of deposits from small 
or under-capitalized banks suggest that many bank 
customers are not placated by these appeals. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Strategic Alliances And Merger Talks Begin 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU) Banks have started forming strategic alliances 
in preparation for merging or being bought. The 
Intercontinental Bank group, which owns three banks 
(Equity, Gateway and Global banks), will consolidate 
them to achieve N20 billion (about USD 160 million) in 
both capital and accumulated reserves.  This model is 
also expected of other large bank groups like First 
Bank, Union Bank of Africa and Union Bank Nigeria, all 
of which include investment banks.  In March of this 
year, the CBN designated seven banks --First Bank, 
Union Bank, United Bank for Africa, Afribank, Standard 
Trust Bank, Guaranty Trust Bank and Zenith Bank -- to 
clear checks on behalf of other banks.  Each of these 
big settlement banks easily met the required 15 billion 
naira (USD 120 million) capitalization threshold 
(considered collateral) to be a settlement bank. 
Settlement banks will have the easiest time attaining 
the new N25 billion capital base mark without merging. 
 
6. (U) Comment.  To meet CBN requirements, smaller 
banks face options such as mergers with larger banks or 
a collective merger of a number of small banks. 
Smaller banks are at a distinct disadvantage in talks 
with large banks.  Large banks can meet the new 
capitalization requirement on their own.  Because they 
do not need to merge, the large banks can bargain down 
the smaller ones.  The latter\'s best chance for 
survival may thus be that some larger banks see 
opportunities, such as niche market access, in linking 
with smaller banks.  Conversely, many smaller banks see 
merger as their only means of survival -- but in what 
form?  End comment. 
 
7. (SBU) Marina Bank, considered a small family bank, 
hopes to form an alliance to meet the new capital base 
requirement.  Jaiye Oyedotun, Marina Managing Director, 
told Econoff in Lagos that Marina was asked by a \"big 
bank\" to update Marina\'s capitalized value to before 
talks proceed.  According to Oyedotun, if the 
revaluation is not measured liberally, Marina will be 
disadvantaged in any potential alliance or merger, 
possibly resulting in minimal representation on the 
board of directors, a large discount of its shares, 
loss of its corporate identity, and a significant loss 
of jobs.  Comment: In the quest to prove market and 
merger worthiness, some banks reportedly have ignored 
industry taboo by sharing confidential client 
information with other banks.  End comment.  Successful 
mergers will depend on customer and investor 
confidence, the size and business compatibility of 
banks involved (some banks are family or one-man 
banks), valuation at current value of the banks merging 
(a difficult exercise given the prevalence of non- 
performing loans at many banks), post-merger 
integration of separate workforces (job losses are 
inevitable) and generally finding the right banking 
partners. End comment 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Inter-Bank Market In Frenzy As \"Big Banks\" Call In 
Funds 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
8. (SBU) Between July 6 and August 25, the central bank 
had been withdrawing public funds from commercial 
banks, action that had caused some of the smaller or 
inadequately capitalized banks to be late settling 
interbank payments.  Their executives not only faulted 
the central bank but also blamed the big banks for 
calling in funds from the interbank market. Many of the 
smaller banks now find it difficult to meet their 
obligations given the dearth of funds, and, according 
to observers, it is no longer unusual for a bank to \"go 
out of clearing\" for a day or two.  (Comment.  Some 
banks have even allegedly \"refused\" to release deposits 
of public funds, an assertion which we accept with a 
grain of salt, given the right of the central bank to 
recall such deposits.  End comment.)  Khalid Qurashi, 
Managing Director of Citibank Nigeria (the only U.S. 
bank in the Nigerian market), nevertheless told us that 
the central bank\'s gradual withdrawal of public funds 
from banks, and the larger banks\' call of debts payable 
by smaller banks suggest gloomy days ahead for the 
banking sector. 
 
9. (U) For his part, CBN Governor Saludo has charged 
that some banks have been depending on public funds to 
engage in commercial activities unrelated to 
intermediation.  To curb these banks\' abusive use of 
public funds and to control liquidity in the system, 
the central bank is implementing periodic phased 
withdrawals of such funding from the commercial banks, 
according to Saludo.  (Though the CBN most recently 
announced it will stop withdrawing Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) funds.  Comment: 
Speculation is that the NNPC fund withdrawal is merely 
deferred and may eventually be re-implemented.  End 
comment.) The CBN plan is to deposit the public funds 
with banks that meet the 25 billion naira 
capitalization requirement by December 2005. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Bank Stock Prices Decline 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) In recent weeks, active trading of bank 
shares has characterized the stock exchange, as 
speculators have been selling shares of banks 
considered weak or unlikely to meet the capitalization 
requirement.  Big losers include Standard Trust Bank 
(STB), whose share price fell to N4.98 in mid-August 
from a high of N7.90 after its initial public offering 
in January. Other casualties include Cooperative Bank, 
Chartered Bank, EIB International Bank and Gulf Bank. 
(Comment.  The uncertainty and investor apathy for bank 
stocks imply banks like Afribank and Oceanic Bank that 
intend to raise money on the capital market will have a 
hard time doing so, at least in the short term.  End 
comment.) 
 
11. (SBU) In the first half of the year, three large 
banks -- Standard Trust Bank (STB), Guaranty Trust Bank 
(GTB) and Zenith Bank -- raised capital by way of an 
initial public offering; all three reportedly were over 
subscribed. These banks are, however, likely survivors 
of the CBN\'s bank consolidation program, having 
accumulated about 10 billion naira each during their 
IPOs. 
12. (SBU) The opponents of Central Bank Governor 
Saludo\'s initiative may draw comfort from a Senate 
initiative to clip the wings of the central bank.  On 
August 26, the chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, A. Z. Sunday, told Econoffs in Abuja that 
all 60 senators present that day for the second reading 
of a Senate-initiated bill unanimously supported the 
bill to make the Central Bank accountable to the 
National Assembly.  Sunday justified their decision by 
saying it is important that the bank be independent of 
the executive.  (Comment. Sunday did not explain why 
monetary policy would likely be more effective under 
legislative than executive oversight. This is the way 
it should be in a democracy, he averred.  We will try 
to obtain a copy of the bill to see which branch of 
government is likely to permit greater central bank 
autonomy.  End comment.)  Sunday added that he hopes 
the Senate will hold a public hearing on the bill 
within the next month, after which he is optimistic 
that the Senate will approve it.  The Senate would then 
send it to the House for its likely approval.  Were the 
President to refuse to then sign the bill, the 
legislature would override his veto and enact it into 
law by a large margin, according to Sunday. 
13. (SBU) Comment.  As uncertainty over the fate of 
some banks persists, some depositors are closing their 
accounts at smaller banks and queuing to open accounts 
at larger banks.  While that development might be 
healthy for the system as a whole, were customer 
confidence in the small banks to continue to diminish, 
there could be a run on small banks.  The chances of 
that coming about are small, however.  According to 
Citigroup\'s Qurashi, Nigeria\'s banking sector may have 
reached a critical moment stating, \"The Nigerian 
banking sector is sitting on a keg of gunpowder,\".  He 
believes the CBN would be wise to address \"systemic 
distress\" in the banking sector.  Qurashi\'s statement 
notwithstanding, as we indicated in ref B, according to 
Governor Saludo the health of the banking system 
overall is generally satisfactory. 
14. (SBU) Comment, continued.  As the banks approach 
the December 2005 recapitalization deadline, bank 
customers will identify more easily qualified and 
unqualified banks.  Already closer to meeting the 
capitalization requirement than the smaller banks, the 
big banks will point to their compliance or near 
compliance as a marketing tool to lure depositors and 
investors from smaller banks.  The capitalization 
requirement may, in the long run, flush out many weaker 
banks, thus laying the foundation for a stronger 
banking sector in the future.  However, the manner in 
which the requirement was announced sent shocks through 
the banking sector which have also reverberated through 
the relatively small community of depositors and 
investors.  Some bankers hope the CBN will ultimately 
moderate its approach by easing the requirement and by 
giving them more time to scale this more modest hurdle. 
End comment.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  GON military efforts (Operation Flush Out 3) to 
combat Delta militants continue. Oil companies are monitoring 
the situation closely, and are not dismissive of the threats 
by Niger Delta People\'s Volunteer Force (NPDVF) leader 
Asari.  Beyond Shell\'s decision to evacuate workers from two 
stations last week, most of the major oil companies are not 
intending any evacuation or diminution of production. 
However, they have instituted a number of precautionary 
measures, including requesting personnel to minimize travel. 
Shell confirmed the violence has resulted in a small 
production loss of about 50,000 barrels/day of the one 
million barrels/day it produces.  Mission has 437 Amcits 
registered as living in the Port Harcourt area, most of whom 
work for energy sector companies with which our ACS unit is 
keeping close contact. 
 
Security Update 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Abuja Pol/Mil officer met Principal Staff Officer 
Group Captain Labaran on the Chief of Defense Staff at the 
Defense Ministry on September 28.  Labaran said the military 
in the Delta has been taking orders directly from President 
Obasanjo, who telephones them when he is out of town.  The 
GON effort is called \"Operation Flush Out 3\" and is limited 
to Rivers State.   Labaran confirmed that the Army, Navy and 
Air Force are involved. 
 
3.  (C)  Current operations involve helicopter gunships going 
down the creeks looking for \"rebels,\" the contact reported, 
and the overall purpose of the operation is to re-establish 
law and order.  Labaran was aware of the human rights angle 
(other sources tell us civilians have been hit by the 
helicopters), and said it was \"a difficult balance\" against 
the need to restore order.  He claimed high morale among the 
GON troops engaged, but would not elaborate on their 
successes.  Labaran advised Pol-Mil Off that expatriates 
should exercise caution and avoid unnecessary travel to avoid 
being seen as potential hostages by the rebels. 
 
Reports from Major Energy Firms 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Shell: Shell\'s Managing Director (MD)  confirmed 
that the company had evacuated flow stations in Soku and 
Ekulama (River State), due to the close proximity of these 
facilities to military operations.  These evacuations were 
\"localized\" and not a sign that Shell was planning a wider 
evacuation.  The MD stated that AMCITs were among those 
evacuated.  He promised to covey exact numbers of AMCITs 
tomorrow. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Shell has seen press reports of Asari threats 
against the company, but has not received any threats 
directly.  Thus far, there have been no signs on the ground 
of direct threats to Soku, Ekulama, or other Shell facilities 
in the general vicinity.  Shell remained fully staffed in 
these other facilities.  Shell has advised staff in these 
outlying facilities not to conduct any riverine travel, which 
has been the normal mode of their business transportation in 
the area.  Evening travel has also been prohibited.  For 
employees in the city of Port Harcourt, Shell is authorizing 
only essential travel around the city.  The Shell MD also 
confirmed press reports of a small production loss, 
approximately 50,000 barrels/day, from the approximately 1 
million barrels/day it was producing prior to the latest 
violence. 
 
6.  (C)  AGIP/ENI: Public Affairs spokesperson for AGIP 
confirmed that they are taking Asari\'s threats seriously, 
but they have not evacuated any staff.  Production in Port 
Harcourt has not been affected.  They employ a small number 
of AMCITs as contractors.  An AGIP spokesperson confirmed to 
the Consulate General that the firm did not lend their 
helicopter for use in a military raid, as rebel leader Asari 
claims. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Chevron/Texaco: Chevron Texaco\'s Managing 
Director for Offshore Operations reported Chevron was 
monitoring the situation closely, but had no plans to 
evacuate personnel, nor to lower production.  He noted 
Chevron Texaco received frequent threats, and the company was 
accustomed to dealing with these difficulties.  Chevron has 
two flow stations approximately five miles from where the 
military operations took place.  There are roughly 120 staff 
at the two stations.  Half of this number are security 
personnel.  Of the 120, only a handful are expatriate.  He 
stated that Chevron was in constant contact with the Nigerian 
military.  If Chevron found out that the military operations 
were enlarging or moving to areas near their flow stations, 
Chevron would re-assess the situation. 
 
8.  (C) Exxon Mobil: The Acting Managing Director for Exxon 
Mobil reported no plans to move or evacuate any personnel. 
He confirmed that Exxon Mobil has no production facilities in 
the Port Harcourt area.  Its Nigerian production is 
off-shore.  However, its Onne supply base, with over 200 
employees, is close to Port Harcourt; Onne employees reside 
in Port Harcourt.  The company also has a small fabrication 
facility in Port Harcourt, with about 40 employees.  Of the 
roughly 250 employees working in these facilities, only about 
20 are expatriates.  Of these, half are American.  Two weeks 
ago, Exxon Mobil increased its security alert from a level 
two to three.  The company employs a four-tiered system, with 
four the highest alert.  It imposed a travel ban in the area, 
but relaxed the ban last week to allow for essential travel 
only.  Exxon Mobil does not plan to change its security alert 
or travel policy for now.  The company plans to issue a 
communiqe, to employees telling them to exercise caution due 
to the \"national holiday.\" The External Relations Director 
for the company told us that Exxon Mobil has an up-to-date 
evacuation plan. 
 
Reports from Independents and Oil Service Companies 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9.  (C)  Halliburton: Acting Halliburton Security Director 
confirmed that all Halliburton employees working with Shell 
in the affected areas had been successfully evacuated.  Most 
were Nigerian personnel.  Security Director stated that 
Halliburton maintains current evacuation plans.  He believes 
that Asari does not have more than 2000 men, and that the GON 
troops had scored some recent successes, destroying 5 rebel 
bases used by Asari. 
 
10.  (C)  Panalpina: Panalpina Oil and Gas Sales Manager 
confirmed that his firm had noted a significant military 
presence in Port Harcourt.  He explained that his office has 
only 8 expatriates in the Port Harcourt office; he is the 
only American in Nigeria employed by the firm.  In the event 
of an evacuation of energy firm personnel, Panalpina 
personnel would stay behind to assist with the movements, as 
the majors depend on Panalpina transportation assets to move 
their personnel. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Coopers Cameron: Coopers Cameron Manager 
explained that all Coopers Cameron facilities in Port 
Harcourt are guarded by mobile police.  Coopers Cameron staff 
in Port Harcourt are all Nigerian, and after efforts to 
improve local content, all of their managers in Port Harcourt 
are also Nigerian.  Coopers Cameron has banned all travel in 
and out of Port Harcourt until the present tensions cease. 
Echoing similar comments from other contacts, he noted that 
while staff felt secure in Port Harcourt itself, movements to 
and from the airport were not viewed as secure. 
 
ACS Update 
---------- 
 
12.  (C)  Mission ACS unit confirmed that 437 AMCITs 
registered with post live in the Port Harcourt area.  The 
vast majority work in the energy sector, and have access to 
some type of evacuation assistance via their employers. 
However, a small number are teachers, missionaries, or in 
other professions outside of the energy sector.  There are 
also a number of dual nationals who usually do not register 
with the Consulate.  It is difficult to determine the precise 
population of this category.

 Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  Given the significant international press 
coverage and the threats of Ijaw secession made by Niger 
Delta People\'s Volunteer Force (NPDVF) leader Alhaji Dokubo 
Asari, the National  Council of State authorized President 
Obasanjo to take strong actions against Delta militants and 
any other groups that pose a threat to national security. 
There are mixed reports on whether GON military engaged any 
delta militants today.  We continue to be in close contact 
with oil companies and AMCIT wardens. 
 
Security Update 
---------------- 
 
2.  (C) The Council of State authorized President Obasanjo to 
\"deal with persons or groups whose activities or utterances 
threaten the sovereignty\" of the country.  The authorization 
was hardly necessary as a practical matter.  Obasanjo does 
not need the NCS imprimatur.  However, it is symbolically 
important as it provides Obasanjo justification and political 
cover to handle the situation as he sees fit, which could 
include continuing and perhaps intensifying military 
operations if negotiations with Asari fail to yield 
dividends. 
 
3. (C) Shell Managing Director Basil Omiya told Consul 
General that the GON had opened discussions with the NPDVF. 
Omiya said initial read-outs from these discussions were 
positive.  Oyimi added that fighters were seen returning to 
their villages.  However, it is not clear whether they are 
returning to their villages for a brief rest before returning 
to the creeks or if they are laying down their arms. 
Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil reported on-going military operations 
against militants, possibly resulting in some fatalities. 
 
Reports from the Energy Sector 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  Shell: Shell\'s Managing Director (MD) reported 
general quiet within the Port Harcourt city environs, with no 
discernible change in the security situation from yesterday. 
Shell\'s Director for External Relations confirmed press 
reports of closure of the Santa Barbara flow station 
yesterday, as Shell staff were unable to visit the station to 
correct a technical problem.  This is the third Shell flow 
station affected by the security situation; stations at Soku 
and Ekulama were evacuated of non-essential staff, but still 
maintain production.  Production losses from Santa Barbara 
were already included in the reduction of approximately 
50,000 barrels/day reported yesterday. 
 
5. (C )AGIP/ENI: The General Manager (GM) for Public Affairs 
reported that AGIP has not evacuated any staff, despite 
threats by Asari against AGIP personnel.  AGIP production 
remains normal.  The GM indicated that AGIP maintains most of 
its flow stations in Bayelsa, with an additional two in Omuku 
and Ahoda. The editor of Nigerian publication, Oil and Gas 
monthly, told Consulate staff contrary to AGIP claims, he 
believes the company has begun evacuating some staff from the 
Delta region. 
 
6.  (C)  Chevron/Texaco: Chevron continues to monitor the 
security situation through its own security personnel and 
through their contacts with Nigerian military on the ground. 
Although not dismissing the threats, Chevron believes Asari 
is more bluster than anything else.  Nevertheless, Chevron is 
taking precautions.  Chevron gauges that Asari does not enjoy 
widespread popular support.  Chevron senses no agitation in 
the communities near its operations. (Comment: Human Rights 
NGOs and some other civil society groups maintain Asari 
enjoys considerable popular support.  They agree with 
Chevron\'s assertion that Asari has been adept at 
manipulating the international media. End Comment).  For 
October 1, the first day of the Asari\'s threat, Chevron has 
ordered all employees to work from home, but it expects to 
resume normal business operations the following business day. 
 
7.  (C) Exxon Mobil:  Exxon Mobil MD informed Consulate Lagos 
that their local contacts reported some skirmishes between 
the GON and militants in the riverine areas today, possibly 
resulting in some fatalities.  Exxon/Mobil has issued a 
communiqu, advising all employees to exercise caution and 
minimize travel, with a complete travel ban in the areas 
affected by the military operation.  Exxon/Mobil plans to 
meet September 30 to review its threat assessment level, 
currently at level three in a four-tiered system.  There has 
been no change in the company\'s production level. 
 
8.  (C) Halliburton: Acting Halliburton Security Director and 
Facility Manager for Port Harcourt confirmed no changes in 
Halliburton\'s security assessment.  He believes the media 
reports are exaggerating the threat.  He notes that rebel 
activities are restricted to the creeks and waterways, not 
the city of Port Harcourt.  Energy company security officers 
in Port Harcourt will meet later today to compare notes on a 
rally planned for October 1 by the National Association of 
Nigerian Students (NANS) to protest the recent fuel hikes and 
the wider security situation. 
 
9.  (C) Tidex: The MD for Tidex, an oil service company 
(OSC) which runs large boat operations for Chevron and other 
majors in the Port Harcourt, noted that there is increased 
tension in the area, but said he saw nothing to suggest that 
expatriates are being specifically targeted.  On any given 
day, TIDEX has 10-25 AMCITs in the Port Harcourt area. 
 
10. (C) Panalpina: Panalpina Oil and Gas Sales Manager stated 
that his Port Harcourt office reported much higher 
mobilizations of soldiers on the outskirts of Port Harcourt. 
His staff had counted at least 40 armored personnel carriers 
being mobilized on heavy lorries.  He believes that military 
activity has escalated in the area since 21 September. 
Panalpina Manager noted that his staff, like many energy 
sector employees, are generally staying on their compounds, 
and taking precautions such as carrying radios when venturing 
out.  Panalpina is updating its evacuation plans to evacuate 
their personnel by water, if necessary. 
 
11.  (U) Coopers Cameron: Coopers Cameron Manager reported no 
significant changes since yesterday. 
 
ACS Update 
---------- 
 
12.  (SBU)  There have been no reports of any incidents 
involving Americans. 
 
Press 
------ 
 
13. ( C) Several local journalists have informed us that some 
media houses have been pressured by government officials, 
including Rivers State Governor Odili to reduce their 
coverage on the Port Harcourt situation.  This may have 
caused some self-censorship.  Now that the story 
is being covered in the international media, local media is 
reporting more on it.  Nonetheless, Oil Watch Africa, an NGO 
that monitors the energy industry, reported that local 
newspapers carried mostly wire reports on the story, and did 
not seem to be doing independent coverage.  Oil Watch Africa 
reported that local television in Port Harcourt is not 
reporting on the situation.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (S)  Local press headlined today with news of 
government meetings with Niger Delta People\'s Volunteer Force 
(NDPVF) leader Asari in Abuja and purported cease-fire 
agreement.  NGO and energy company contacts stated that the 
situation in Port Harcourt was less tense.  Production 
remains unchanged.  There have been no reports on incidents 
involving 
Americans.  Apparently rival Delta militant leader Ateke Tom 
also has traveled to Abuja to participate in talks with the 
GON, and the GON has summoned Rivers State Governor Odili as 
well.  Local press is now openly discussing the Joint Task 
Force Operation Flush Out.

2.  (U)  Local press headlined today with news of 
government meetings with Niger Delta People\'s Volunteer 
Force (NPDVF) leader Asari in Abuja, stating that the GON 
and Asari had agreed to a cease-fire.  See reftel Abuja 1675. 
 
3.  (C) Marine and Naval Attache returned 30 September from 
a 3-day trip to the Port Harcourt area.  His NGO and oil 
company sources indicates the overall security situation in 
Port Harcourt is quiet, particularly in the city itself.  His 
sources tended to discount Asari\'s assertion that he was the 
head a genuine Ijaw malcontent movement.  They saw Asari as a 
political thug/bunkerer who was trying to cloak himself with 
Ijaw populism in order to vieil the illicit pecuniary 
activities that are his real motivators.  However, he 
explained that there are oil facilities or personnel, whether 
due to their  geographical location or operational nature, 
that have minimal or no real security protection and that are 
vunerable to the local gangs.  While the Attache\'s contacts 
largely downplayed the possibility of a large-scale operation 
by the local militias, they prediced that small-scale attacks 
typical of the delta region may continue as usual.  Further 
reporting on the Attache\'s visit to Port Harcourt will be 
transmitted via DOD channels. 
 
4.  (S)  The Attache also notes that he has received 
information that rival Delta militant leader Ateke Tom 
traveled to Abuja on 29 September, (separately from Asari), 
to participate in talks with the GON.  He notes there are 
rumors that Asari has been talking to the GON for several 
weeks.  He also was informed that that the GON has summoned 
Rivers State 
Governor Odili to Abuja as well. 
 
5.  (U)   Unconfirmed press stated that the GON soldiers 
conducted an operation in  attacked the Gbali community in 
Degema local government area of Rivers on September 23 and 
29, in search of bunkerers who had reportedly disarmed 
military personnel guarding oil installations in the area. 
The press quoted a resident saying, that the town is now a 
\"ghost town taken over by the military in under terrible 
occupation and seizure.\"  Army PRO Second Brigade Nigerian 
Army Port Harcourt confirmed the military had visited the 
town twice in the last 10 days, uncovering an unidisclosed 
quantity of arms and ammunition in village.

STATE PASS TO OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 
 
E.O. 12958: NA 
TAGS: EFIN, ELAB, AMGT, PGOV, NI 
SUBJECT: ENACTMENT OF NEW PENSION ACT 
 
 
1. (U) Summary.  Nigeria\'s National Assembly has 
enacted a new Pension Reform Act that establishes a 
uniform contributory pension scheme for public and 
private sector employees.  The new law confers pension 
management responsibilities on professional pension 
fund administrators, who will maintain retirement 
savings accounts in behalf of public and private sector 
employees.  A National Pension Commission will regulate 
and supervise the activities of the administrators and 
custodians of pension fund assets. The new scheme is 
expected to be fully funded, privately managed, and 
strictly regulated. End summary. 
 
CONTRIBUTION RATES AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
 
2. (U) Under the new scheme, both employers and 
employees will be required to contribute a minimum of 
seven and a half percent of an employee\'s monthly 
earnings to a retirement account.  Employers will have 
the option of bearing the full burden of the scheme. 
Every employee subject to the act\'s provisions will be 
required to maintain an account with a Pension Fund 
Administrator of his or her choice.  Employers will 
have to deduct their employees\' contributions at source 
and remit them within seven days to a Pension Asset 
Custodian designated by the employees\' Pension Fund 
Administrator. The accumulated funds from employees\' 
retirement savings accounts will be drawn down in two 
phases at maturity. First, employees, upon retiring, 
will collect lump sum cash payments that will be not 
less than fifty percent of their current annual 
remuneration. Second, the other half of the funds in 
the retirement savings accounts will be invested in 
annuities designed to provide pension benefits to 
retired employees for the remainder of their lives. 
 
PENSION FUND ADMINISTRATORS(PFAs) 
 
3. (U) Only limited liability companies that will have 
accrued minimum paid-up share capital of N150 million 
(USD 1.15 million at the current exchange rate) will 
qualify to manage pension funds. Fund administrators 
will operate retirement savings accounts in behalf of 
employees and will invest the latter\'s funds in various 
assets through PACs.  The administrators will maintain 
account books of transactions and will provide relevant 
information to the National Pension Commission.  The 
PFAs will compute and pay retirement benefits in line 
with the law regulating the pension scheme. 
 
PENSION ASSET CUSTODIANS (PACs) 
 
4. The responsibility for safekeeping pension funds 
will lie with licensed financial institutions that will 
be required by law to hold pension funds and assets in 
trust. Companies having a minimum net worth of five 
billion naira (USD 38.5 million) will manage the PACs. 
The former will be required to have cumulative balance 
sheet assets of one hundred and twenty five billion 
naira (USD 960 million) or be owned by licensed 
financial institutions with the same balance sheet 
position. (Comment. The one hundred and twenty five 
billion naira requirement may be unrealistic.  The 
National Pension Commission has said it will review the 
new law and recommend amendments. End comment.) Pension 
fund custodians will invest in behalf of PFAs.  They 
will be required to provide data and other information 
relating to their operations and dealings with funds 
administrators to a National Pension Commission. 
 
NATIONAL PENSION COMMISSION 
 
5. (U) The Pension Act establishes a National Pension 
Commission whose principal objective will be to 
regulate, supervise and otherwise ensure the effective 
administration of pensions in Nigeria. The full-time 
officers and staff of the Commission will comprise a 
non-executive chairman, an executive director general, 
four commissioners, and other officials representing 
each of the six geo-political zones of Nigeria.  The 
appointments of the principals will be subject to 
senate confirmation.  The head of the Civil Service and 
one representative of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the 
Finance Ministry, the Nigeria Labor Congress, the 
Nigerian Union of Pensioners, the Nigeria Employers 
Consultative Association, and of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission will also be on the board of the 
commission. 
 
NIGERIAN SOCIAL INSURANCE TRUST FUND (NSITF) 
 
6. (U) The new pension act clarifies the statutory 
responsibilities of the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust 
Fund (NSITF).  While NSITF will continue to provide 
social security insurance services, it will also serve 
as a pension funds administrator.  NSITF will guarantee 
minimum pension benefits as determined by the pension 
commission, and will credit all existing contributions 
plus attributable income less amounts required to 
guarantee minimum pensions to employees\' retirement 
savings accounts. However, NSITF will transfer all the 
funds and assets it holds and manages to pension fund 
custodians as soon as the pension scheme is 
established.  Five years after its establishment, 
employees will be free to transfer their NSITF 
entitlements to any PFA of their choice. 
 
TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
 
7. (U) The pension act makes transitional provisions 
for private sector organizations with existing pension 
schemes, which by law must participate in this new 
scheme.  Private sector organizations that have defined 
contribution schemes will be required to re-compute 
their employees\' contributions and to credit them to 
retirement savings accounts to be opened for employees. 
Such pension funds and assets will have to be 
segregated from the funds and assets of that these 
private sector organizations accumulated before the 
enactment of the new pension scheme. (The old pension 
scheme, also established by legislation, was non- 
contributory for the public sector. Benefits were 
defined and linked to final salary.  The scheme failed 
because it was only partially funded or in most cases 
not funded at all. Until the new pension act was 
passed, pension schemes in the private sector were 
voluntary and governed by trust deeds.  The schemes 
were contributory, insured, self administered, and 
generally successful.) 
 
 
TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR 
 
8. (U) All government ministries and departments will 
establish pension fund offices.  These offices will 
issue government bonds to cover the entitlements to 
pensions existing before the new scheme takes effect. 
The bonds will be redeemed upon the retirement of 
employee contributors who will then have an option to 
buy annuities. 
 
LABOR\'S REACTION 
 
9. (U) On July 15, 2004, the Nigeria Labor Congress 
(NLC) organized an interactive forum to examine both 
the nature of what will be the contributory pension 
scheme and the mechanism and institutions established 
by law to administer the scheme.  The participants 
perceived inadequacies and ambiguities, and called on 
both the Presidency and the National Assembly to 
address them. The NLC fears that the new act 
inadequately addresses existing pension liabilities. 
The NLC said this situation informed its call for 
pension reform scheme that might clear the backlog of 
pension arrears.  The NLC is urging the GON to 
appropriate funds from federal revenue (especially from 
crude oil sales) to clear these liabilities. 
 
10. (U) The NLC also questions the constitutionality of 
the new pension act.  It argues that the National 
Assembly has no constitutional mandate to legislate 
pension schemes for the private sector, and has 
threatened to contest the legality of this new act. The 
NLC is also urging the Government of Nigeria to review 
the composition of the National Pension Commission to 
ensure adequate and equitable stakeholder 
representation. 
 
BANKS EXPECTATIONS 
 
11. (U) Many banks are positioning themselves to 
benefit from the new pension scheme. Some banks have 
begun to form asset management companies or departments 
preparatory to being licensed as pension fund 
administrators (PFA). Notable among them are the 
Investment Banking And Trust Company (IBTC), the United 
Bank for Africa (UBA), First Bank, and NAL Bank. Some 
of these bank were managing contributory pension funds 
for the private sector before the new act became law, 
and expect to become PFAs for such companies once the 
banks become duly licensed. Some of these banks are 
also preparing to be licensed as pension fund 
custodians (PFC). The law stipulates that PFAs cannot 
transact business with affiliated PFCs, however. 
 
CONTRIBUTORY PENSION FUNDS TO ENSURE LONG-TERM FUNDS 
 
12. (U) Many financial operators consider the scheme 
overdue, given its potential as a major source of long- 
term funds. At present, the primary source of liquid 
assets of the financial sector, particularly the 
banking sub-sector, is predominantly short-term funds 
from the public sector. Bank dependence on such funds 
has always been cited as a reason for the low volume of 
credit extended to the real sector of the economy, and 
usually at high interest rates. Sola David-Borha, an 
executive director of the Investment Banking and Trust 
Company, told us in early August that the dearth of 
long-term funds has grossly undermined the investment 
potential of Nigerian banks. She said the pool of funds 
to be generated through the pension scheme will give 
banks greater latitude to invest in productive 
ventures. The availability of these long-term funds 
will ensure cheaper funds for the investing public as 
well, she said. 
 
13. (U) The cost of short-term public funds, which 
often exceeds 15 percent per annum, has usually been 
the banking sector\'s excuse for charging high interest 
rates on loans. Now, as a result of the new pension 
act, it is expected that pension funds will pool 
billions of naira within the first five years of the 
law\'s implementation. This will make it possible for 
banks and their customers to secure easier access to 
funds for working capital, mortgages, etc. at longer 
maturities and possibly lower cost. 
 
14. (U) While concerns have been expressed about what 
return will accrue to contributors of funds to be 
invested by banks and managed by the pension fund 
custodians, Bayo Yusuf, the senior manager of the 
pensions department of United Bank for Africa (UBA), 
told us that contributors to the pension schemes will 
receive the prevailing market interest rate. The law 
expressly states, \"No PFA should give its contributors 
less than 200 basis points below prevailing market 
interest rate\".  Contributors will thus receive some 
return on their \"investment\" at maturity. (Comment. 
The question is, what will be the prevailing market 
rate?  Is it to be treasury bill rate by itself or plus 
so many bonus points?  Is the prevailing market rate to 
be indexed to inflation?  Since the Government has 
sometimes sold treasury bills at a discount to offset 
the differential between the rate of t-bills at par and 
inflation, contributors to the schemes might receive 
little or no return on their investment were 
contributors to be paid a rate of return that is no 
less than 200 basis points below the prevailing market 
rate, as indicated above.  End comment.) 
 
15. (U) Yusuf believes that the possibility of banks\' 
obtaining PFA licenses will help some banks to meet the 
July 2004 directive that they increase their capital 
base from N2 billion (USD 15.4 million) to N25 billion 
(USD 192.3 million) by December 31, 2005. The Act 
requires that PFAs have a N150 million capital base 
(USD 1.2 million), but most banks already have over 
N500 million (USD 3.9 million). Yusuf believes that 
should mergers or acquisitions not be feasible for 
banks to meet the new capital base requirement, some 
may opt to become PFAs, action that could improve the 
quality of funds administration in Nigeria. 
 
16. (U) The law allows companies like Shell Oil and 
Cadbury that have existing pension funds of over N500 
million to set up their own PFAs. Thus the focus of 
some PFAs will likely be on small and medium 
enterprises (five employees and above) that accumulate 
a smaller volume of pension funds, Yusuf said. Such a 
development could encourage positive banking habits and 
also help ensure future income for workers who until 
now have not contributed to pension programs.

Summary 
--------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The Port Harcourt area has been quiet and tensions 
have diminished from earlier this week as Nigeria celebrates 
October 1, its 44th Independence Day.  Local press continues 
to report that the GON flew Niger Delta Vigilante Group 
(NDVG) leader Ateke Tom (the primary rival of Dokubo Asari) 
to Abuja for talks with the GON.  In his Independence Day 
speech, President Obasanjo stated the need to engage in 
dialogue to resolve popular grievances in the Niger Delta, 
and deliver the dividends of democracy to the impoverished 
region.  Indicating the GON was using a carrot and stick 
approach, press reports suggest the military has established 
a presence in Asari\'s home village. 
 
Security Update 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U)  According to the local press, the GON flew the 
NDVG\'s Ateke Tom, to Abuja to widen the scope of the peace 
talks. 
 
3.  (U)  There are no reports of any fighting in the area. 
In several published interviews, Asari stated that peace 
talks had been cordial, but the duration of the cease-fire 
was contingent on the GON meeting his demands for a sovereign 
national conference and for significantly more local control 
over oil resources. 
 
Reports from the Energy Sector 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  On October 1, the Shell Managing Director told us 
that the cease-fire seemed to be holding, and Port Harcourt 
was calm.  An AGIP Security Manager confirmed that Port 
Harcourt was calm, and AGIP employees were going about their 
normal business.  The Cooper Cameron Country Manager 
indicated  their employees were also carrying out their 
normal activities.  Late September 30, Chevron Texaco General 
Manager for Public and Government Affairs confirmed that the 
situation around Chevron Texaco facilities remained calm. 
 
Press Report - Obasanjo: \"A Rapprochement is Taking Place\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Local newspaper \"This Day\" published excerpts from 
  President Obasanjo\'s Independence Day address.  President 
Obasanjo emphasized the need to respond to grievances in the 
Delta region: \"We are talking to those I described as 
rascally elements from the Niger Delta in the efforts to open 
lines of dialogue and peace as they feel aggrieved by their 
authorities.\"  However, he stressed that the GON would not 
tolerate \"acts that would mortgage or compromise the 
interests of the majority.\"  He also reassured listeners that 
peace negotiations were continuing, while appealing to Delta 
officials to respond to the needs of their communities: \"A 
rapprochement is taking place, and peace, stability and 
harmony will return to the Niger Delta.  The obvious 
assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on 
the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the 
Niger Delta.  In the interest of security and stability of 
the Niger Delta in particular and Nigeria in general, I 
appeal to those elected official of the region whose efforts 
are not measured up to expectations, to endeavour to be seen 
to be more alive to their responsibilities and the plight of 
the people they are elected to govern.\"  (Comment: To some 
extent, Obasanjo likely offered this explanation in an 
attempt, not only to reassure the public, but to respond to 
criticism that by opening dialogue with the militants, he was 
only encouraging future miscreancy.  It is also noteworthy 
that he primarily blamed local and state elected officials 
for the sorry state of affairs in the Delta.  End comment.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  However, signally that his government was using a 
carrot and stick approach, the GON sent a not so subtle 
reminder to Asari and others.  Newspapers report that a 
significant military presence has been established in Asari\'s 
village of Buguma.

speech, President Obasanjo stated the need to engage in 
dialogue to resolve popular grievances in the Niger Delta, 
and deliver the dividends of democracy to the impoverished 
region.  Indicating the GON was using a carrot and stick 
approach, press reports suggest the military has established 
a presence in Asari\'s home village. 
 
Security Update 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U)  According to the local press, the GON flew the 
NDVG\'s Ateke Tom, to Abuja to widen the scope of the peace 
talks. 
 
3.  (U)  There are no reports of any fighting in the area. 
In several published interviews, Asari stated that peace 
talks had been cordial, but the duration of the cease-fire 
was contingent on the GON meeting his demands for a sovereign 
national conference and for significantly more local control 
over oil resources. 
 
Reports from the Energy Sector 
------------------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  On October 1, the Shell Managing Director told us 
that the cease-fire seemed to be holding, and Port Harcourt 
was calm.  An AGIP Security Manager confirmed that Port 
Harcourt was calm, and AGIP employees were going about their 
normal business.  The Cooper Cameron Country Manager 
indicated  their employees were also carrying out their 
normal activities.  Late September 30, Chevron Texaco General 
Manager for Public and Government Affairs confirmed that the 
situation around Chevron Texaco facilities remained calm. 
 
Press Report - Obasanjo: \"A Rapprochement is Taking Place\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Local newspaper \"This Day\" published excerpts from 
  President Obasanjo\'s Independence Day address.  President 
Obasanjo emphasized the need to respond to grievances in the 
Delta region: \"We are talking to those I described as 
rascally elements from the Niger Delta in the efforts to open 
lines of dialogue and peace as they feel aggrieved by their 
authorities.\"  However, he stressed that the GON would not 
tolerate \"acts that would mortgage or compromise the 
interests of the majority.\"  He also reassured listeners that 
peace negotiations were continuing, while appealing to Delta 
officials to respond to the needs of their communities: \"A 
rapprochement is taking place, and peace, stability and 
harmony will return to the Niger Delta.  The obvious 
assessment so far is that not much impact has been made on 
the lives and living standards of most ordinary people of the 
Niger Delta.  In the interest of security and stability of 
the Niger Delta in particular and Nigeria in general, I 
appeal to those elected official of the region whose efforts 
are not measured up to expectations, to endeavour to be seen 
to be more alive to their responsibilities and the plight of 
the people they are elected to govern.\"  (Comment: To some 
extent, Obasanjo likely offered this explanation in an 
attempt, not only to reassure the public, but to respond to 
criticism that by opening dialogue with the militants, he was 
only encouraging future miscreancy.  It is also noteworthy 
that he primarily blamed local and state elected officials 
for the sorry state of affairs in the Delta.  End comment.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  However, signally that his government was using a 
carrot and stick approach, the GON sent a not so subtle 
reminder to Asari and others.  Newspapers report that a 
significant military presence has been established in Asari\'s 
village of Buguma.

7.  (SBU)  No incidents involving AMCITs have been reported.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA SIGNS VIRGIN AIRLINES DEAL; AVIATION 
UNION VOWS TO PREVENT AIRCRAFT FROM FLYING ABSENT 
PAYMENT OF BACK WAGES 
 
Reftel: Lagos 1905 
 
1.  Summary.  The Government of Nigeria signed 
September 28 a partnership deal between Nigeria Airways 
(NA) and Virgin Atlantic Airways (reftel), creating 
Virgin Nigeria.  The new carrier anticipates beginning 
operations early 2005.  The Federal High Court ordered 
liquidation of NA assets July 9.  NA employees have 
been demonstrating outside the domestic terminal of 
Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) for the 
past several days demanding payment of back 
wages/pensions and that the new carrier retain some 
existing employees.  The Aviation Unions Grand Alliance 
(AUGA) has vowed to prevent the new carrier from flying 
pending resolution of these issues.  Airport operations 
are not impacted by the current NA demonstration. End 
summary. 
 
Hurried Virgin Nigeria Signing Ceremony 
 
2. (U) GON officials and Virgin Group president Richard 
Branson signed the Virgin Nigeria partnership September 
28.  It was initially planned that President Obasanjo 
and Branson would ink the deal during a televised news 
conference on Nigeria\'s October 1 Independence day. 
The public\'s lukewarm reception to the Virgin deal and 
on-going protest by NA employees may have played a role 
in the government\'s more understated publicity relating 
to the deal. 
 
Police Lock Out Nigeria Airways Employees 
 
3. (U) Disgruntled NA employees have been rallying at 
company headquarters outside the domestic terminal of 
Murtala Muhammed International Airport since Monday, 
September 27.  The employees are demanding payment of 
back salaries and pensions. 
 
4. (U) The Nigerian police quietly took up watch at the 
NA headquarters Sunday September 26.  Though NA is 
operationally defunct, according to Assistant General 
Manager for Public Affairs, Obi Aseme, many of its 
employees are still reporting to work.  When employees 
arrived on September 27 to report for duty, police 
blocked their entry.  The court-appointed liquidator of 
NA assets, Babington Ashaye, reportedly asked for 
government assistance in assuring the take over of the 
property after NA employees foiled several previous 
attempts.  The group of employees quickly transformed 
into an emotionally charged demonstration as the NA 
employees worried the shut out signaled that their 
unpaid wages and pensions would never be recouped. 
While the lock-out has been mostly peaceful, on 
September 30 police discharged tear gas in an 
unsuccessful attempt to disperse the crowd. 
 
Umbrella Aviation Union Vows To Ground New Carrier If 
Labor Demands Are Not Met 
 
5. (U)  Aviation Unions Grand Alliance (AUGA) 
representatives vowed to prevent the new Virgin Nigeria 
carrier from operating, pending satisfactory resolution 
of NA employees compensatory claims.  AUGA 
representatives told Consulate Lagos approximately 1600 
former NA employees and 2300 pensioners have not been 
paid in 18 months and 26 months respectively.  The 
representatives fear the Virgin Nigeria deal will not 
only ensure that NA employees and pensioners are never 
paid back payments, but also result in layoffs of large 
numbers of NA employees.  AUGA sees the Virgin Nigeria 
deal as a bad solution. They expect the new carrier 
will repatriate most profits to the UK and that it will 
hire few Nigerian employees.  (Note: AUGA is the 
umbrella labor organization of the National Association 
of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), Air Transport 
Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATSSSAN), 
and National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) 
End Note). 
 
Security at Murtala Muhammed International Airport Not 
Compromised 
 
7. (U) The NA demonstration is contained in an area 
outside of airport property near the MMIA domestic 
terminal.  Reports of police presence range from 200- 
300 armed mobile police officers.  Tensions are 
reportedly high at the demonstration site.  According 
to Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria contacts, the 
tear gas used September 30 affected a large area around 
the domestic terminal.  However, there are no reported 
disturbances of airport use, local vehicular traffic, 
or flights. 
 
8. (U) Comment: The outstanding labor issue casts a 
shadow over the Virgin Nigeria deal and could possibly 
affect the schedule to begin operations early 2005. 
Thus far the new partnership team has not stated its 
position on whether it is prepared to settle back 
payments owed to NA employees and pensioners.  Over the 
longer term, Virgin Nigeria\'s possible lack of access 
to the Nigeria-U.S. transatlantic route could be a much 
larger obstacle.  End comment.

Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reasons 1.5 (B & D) 
 
Summary 
--------- 
 
1. (C) There have been no reports of fighting between 
the GON military and any of the informal militias in the Port 
Harcourt area.  Press reported celebrations continued 
Saturday and Sunday in the streets of Port Harcourt due to 
the announcement of a tentative agreement between the federal 
government and the two rival rebel groups, the Niger Delta 
People\'s Volunteer Force (NDPVF) and the Niger Delta 
Vigilante Group (NDVG).  There are plans for the GON to meet 
with the rebel groups again on 8 October for further 
discussions.  AGIP drew down personnel last week in what 
appeared to be a limited response to localized threats. 
 
Security Update 
---------------- 
 
2. (C) The Port Harcourt area remained peaceful over the 
weekend and into today.  Asari, and to a lesser extent Tom, 
received heros\' welcomes upon returning to Port Harcourt from 
Abuja.  There were unconfirmed press reports that the GON has 
moved its military forces away from Asari\'s hometown of 
Buguma.  Apparently, the military might have moved forces to 
Buguma while Asari was in Abuja for talks.  This move was 
seen by Asari as a sign of bad faith by the GON. 
 
3. (C) While Port Harcourt celebrated, there remained many 
unanswered questions regarding the communique issued in 
Abuja.  Asari publicly stated that the pact with the 
government is contingent on the GON meeting its demands for a 
national conference, and for a degree of political autonomy 
and resource control.  Government spokespersons have also 
been coy on divulging the details of any agreements reached 
between the GON and the militias. 
 
Energy Sector Report 
---------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) According to a contact in Port Harcourt, average 
persons there welcomed the respite from the violence, and 
were reacting based only on their hopes.  A Shell official 
stated the company was still cautious, but the situation was 
looking better.  Shell is reviewing the security situation 
daily; Shell personnel still need armed escorts to move about 
Port Harcourt. 
 
5. (C) We have credible reports that on September 30, AGIP 
removed some of its personnel and visiting Conoco Philips 
(CP) personnel (including about seven AMCITs) from two AGIP 
facilities around the Port Harcourt area in separate 
incidents.  The move was due to sporadic shooting in the area 
of one facility, (SAIPEM) and a direct threat received by 
AGIP to the other facility.  The SAIPEM fabrication facility 
is 5-8 kilometers south of Port Harcourt.  Production was not 
affected by these withdrawals. 
 
Press Report: Governor Announces Amnesty Plan 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
6. (C) Seeing his national political ambitions being 
tarnished, and perhaps feeling a bit irrelevant to the Abuja 
process, embattled River state Governor Odili made a weekend 
broadcast expressing happiness for the cease-fire, and 
promising to raise a special committee to assist in the 
rehabilitation and reintegration of aggrieved people.  Odili 
reminded listeners that violence would only chase much-needed 
investment away from their region.  The Governor reportedly 
granted amnesty to the militias if they turn in their 
weapons. 
 
ACS Report 
----------- 
 
7. (C) Seven AMCITs were evacuated safely from AGIP 
facilities (para five).  There were no other reports of 
incidents involving AMCITs. 
Comment 
-------- 
 
8. (C) We are getting two distinct interpretations 
regarding the talks between the GON and the rebel groups. 
Some people are interpreting the communique as a sign of a 
final settlement between the parties.  However, an NGO 
official who claims to have participated in the negotiations 
says the agreement is much more tentative and conditional. 
Asari\'s statements that the pact will be broken if the GON 
fails to recognize demands for a sovereign national 
conference and increased resource control lends credence to 
this less optimistic interpretation. 
 
9. (C) What we can say for sure is that violence has 
diminished, and the GON and militants have talked.  Although 
the communiqu was signed, we do not believe a binding, full 
agreement has been reached.  The issues were too many and too 
important for an agreement to have been struck unless Asari 
has actually, albeit not publicly, capitulated on his 
demands.  Nonetheless, the mood is positive, which will help 
to reduce tension and violence in the short term. 
 
10. (C) Rivers state Governor Odili\'s announcement of an 
amnesty was another wild card.  Thorny details of 
implementation were not thought out because Odili probably 
made the statement more for political posturing than to 
advance peace.  Whether the program would extend to those 
guilty of killing civilians, police, or GON military must be 
addressed, as should the fundamental question of whether a 
state governor has this authority.  As these details are 
fleshed out, the proposed amnesty program could boomerang on 
Odili.  As with his relationship with Asari, it will not be 
the first time that Odili has suffered a strong backfire from 
his political machinations.

SUBJECT: A LAGOS STATE PERSPECTIVE ON HIV/AIDS 
 
 
1. Summary. To gather input to develop the Five Year 
Strategy for Nigeria for the Emergency Plan for AIDS 
Relief, USG team members met officials of the Lagos 
State Ministry of Health and the Lagos State Action 
Committee on AIDS (LSACA) on September 20. The HIV/AIDS 
prevalence rate in the state (4.7 percent) is just 
below the national average (5.0 percent). Lagos State, 
however, has the highest prevalence rate of the 
Southwest states, and several \"hotspots\" within the 
state have rates well above the national average. Lagos 
has various prevention, care, and support programs in 
place, but state officials would like to expand and 
enhance them. Few people receive antiretroviral drugs, 
making treatment an area of significant need. The areas 
of need identified by the state officials align well 
with the goals of the Emergency Plan. End summary. 
 
2. USG team members met with the commissioner for 
health, Dr. Leke Pitan, and staff of the Lagos State 
Ministry of Health and (separately) the CEO of the 
Lagos State Action Committee on AIDS (LSACA), Dr. 
Aderemi Desalu, on September 20. 
 
Lagos Prevalence Rates: Just below national 
average but highest in the Southwest 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. USG team members provided an overview of the country 
goals for the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. The 
presentation included prevalence rates drawn from the 
2003 National HIV Sero-prevalence Sentinel Survey from 
the Federal Ministry of Health. The state prevalence 
rate of 4.7 percent is slightly below the national 
prevalence of 5.0 percent, but Lagos has the highest 
prevalence of the Southwest states. Within the state, 
the prevalence rate varies by location, from 1.7 
percent on Lagos Island to 7.7 percent in Ikeja. 
(Comment: The reliability of the survey results has 
been difficult to gauge. The Lagos Island rate of 1.7 
percent seems much too low. End comment.) 
 
State Response: Solid programs 
underway, expansion needed 
------------------------------ 
 
4. Commissioner Pitan explained that LSACA, as part of 
the governor\'s office, is the lead agency for HIV/AIDS 
in the state. As the coordinating agency, LSACA works 
with eleven line ministries, including the Ministry of 
Health. (Comment: Effectiveness in some states has been 
hampered by confusion or wrangling over the scope of 
responsibilities of the SACA and other agencies. Lagos 
State is often cited by the World Bank as an example of 
how coordination can and should work. End comment.) 
 
5. The commissioner commented that most people in Lagos 
State know AIDS is real. He stressed the national 
importance of addressing HIV/AIDS in Lagos, given that 
the state\'s large population is drawn from all areas of 
Nigeria, with many Lagosians frequently traveling to 
their home villages and other parts of the country. He 
highlighted some of the programs in the state, 
including voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) 
centers, prevention of mother to child transmission 
(PMTCT) programs, and centralization of blood 
transfusion services. He added that the state plans to 
establish more VCT centers (with Family Health 
International) and to focus more on treatment. For 
instance, the state plans to embark on its own ARV 
program and is currently obtaining ARV bids from 
several leading pharmaceutical companies. 
 
Prevention: Blood supply system is clear area of need 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
6. Prevention activities in Lagos State include PMTCT 
programs in twelve hospitals, peer educator and other 
programs in schools, and a safe injection program with 
John Snow, Inc. While noting that the bulk of Emergency 
Plan funding will go toward treatment, LSACA CEO Desalu 
also stressed the importance of prevention. 
 
7. A recent state law calls for screening and 
certification of the blood supply. Eighteen screening 
centers exist, but they are not all functional. The 
state remains far from full compliance with the new 
law. Ministry officials asked for USG assistance toward 
the goal of screening 100 percent of the blood supply 
and in increasing the number of volunteer donors. They 
explained that currently less than five percent of the 
blood supply comes from volunteer donors. Most of the 
supply comes from commercial donors (touts), and some 
comes from recipients\' relatives. The officials implied 
that increasing the proportion of supply from volunteer 
donors would reduce the likelihood of HIV in the 
supply. 
 
Care and Support: VCT expansion and refinement needed 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. Fourteen voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) 
centers operate in Lagos State, thirteen supported by 
Family Health International and USAID and one run by 
Medecins Sans Frontieres. Ministry officials said they 
plan to increase the number of VCT centers. One noted 
the importance of strengthening family planning 
programs and clinics that treat sexually transmitted 
infections (STI) and linking them to HIV programs. He 
suggested the low prevalence rate on Lagos Island is 
partially due to the fact that the island has had a 
clinic for STIs for over twenty years and an HIV/AIDS 
voluntary counseling and testing center for more than 
five years. 
 
9. Regarding barriers to people\'s using VCT centers, 
Pitan commented that without hope of antiretroviral 
treatment, many people see no reason to find out or 
make known their HIV status. Another official noted a 
need for youth-friendly services to encourage teenagers 
to be tested, while others commented that social stigma 
remains a significant barrier. 
 
10. A ministry official pleaded for an emphasis on 
children, as they are consistently on the periphery of 
HIV/AIDS strategies. She commented that supportive care 
would be valuable even if no drugs were available. 
Pitan said Lagos would be a good place to start 
pediatric AIDS activities, since Lagos has the largest 
pediatric center in Nigeria. 
 
Treatment: Few programs and significant need 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
11. The Ministry of Health officials requested that we 
allocate the majority of Emergency Plan funds to 
treatment and antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. In 
particular, they said they would like to add ARV 
treatment to the services provided by VCT centers and 
maternity centers.  Currently, only the Lagos 
University Teaching Hosipital is included in the 
National ARV Treatment Program. This site serves about 
500 clients. The Lagos Island General Hospital also 
provides ARV treatment for about seventy-five patients 
who self pay and ten patients for whom Medecins Sans 
Frontieres covers the costs. 
 
12. The ministry officials did not have definitive 
information on private hospitals, but they knew of none 
providing ARV treatment. They said that given the high 
cost, few patients would be likely to seek treatment 
through private hospitals. 
 
Health System: Capacity building 
needed to support programs 
-------------------------------- 
 
13. One of the ministry officials commented that none 
of these specific HIV/AIDS programs can function 
outside a functioning overall health caresystem. He 
requested some USG support for capacity building in the 
health system, especially at the primary care level. 
The USG team explained that the Emergency Plan places 
constraints on general system support, as all funding 
must be directly connected to HIV/AIDS prevention, care 
and support, and treatment. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. HIV/AIDS issues receive relatively strong political 
support in Lagos State. LSACA is perhaps the most 
effective of Nigeria\'s SACAs, with several programs in 
place and a good working relationship with the Lagos 
State Ministry of Health. Clearly, however, much 
remains to be done to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS among 
the large population of Lagos State. The ministry and 
LSACA officials have a good understanding of what is 
needed, and the needs they identified align well with 
the goals of the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

This is a joint Consulate Lagos - Embassy Abuja Cable 
 
1. (S/NF) Summary: Barring a last-minute breakthrough in 
tense, on again, off again talks between the GON and the 
National Labor Congress (NLC), the stage is set for a 
nationwide \"stay-at-home\" on Monday, October 11.  All major 
unions have announced their intention to honor the strike 
protesting a recent fuel price hike (ref A). The strike\'s 
sustainability or the level of violence it may engender is 
unpredictable at this point.  GON security forces have been 
advised to quickly thwart any demonstrations.  Posts held EAC 
meetings on October 6 and 10 and are taking appropriate 
precautionary measures (refs B and C).  In an unrelated event 
that nonetheless adds to the climate of tension, Nigerian 
employees of Royal Dutch Shell began a two-day strike October 
7, protesting company-wide downsizing.  Shell\'s oil 
production has not been affected.  End Summary. 
 
-------------------------- 
GON - Labor Talks Deadlock 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (U) In an effort to avert the national stay-at-home, the 
Ministry of Labor called a meeting October 6 with 
representatives from the NLC, the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC), and the Nigeria Employer\'s Consultative 
Association (NECA).  Total and other independent oil 
companies also attended.  The talks ended abruptly when NLC 
President Oshimohole objected to what he termed only \"low 
level\" government representation.  The NLC insisted 
Ministerial level GON representation was needed for 
meaningful negotiations. 
 
3.  (U) In addition to the talks convened by the ministry of 
labor, the federal Senate Committee on Employment Labour and 
Productivity began closed-door negotiations with the NLC, the 
Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPRA) and the 
NNPC on October 6.  The House of Representatives unanimously 
called on the government to revert to the old fuel price and 
on the NLC to call off the strike until a compromise could be 
reached. 
 
4.  (C) While President Obasanjo is doing everything he can 
(short of compromise) to avert the strike, a source in the 
Presidency says that the pressure on Obasanjo to roll back 
the price inceases is growing among many of his closest 
confidants, both politicians and businessmen.  The source 
speculates that the negative publicity a strike will generate 
for Nigeria and the record price of oil on the international 
market have swayed the opinions of this group of advisors. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Who\'s For A Strike?  We All Are, At Least Rhetorically 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (U) All three major labor federations - The Nigeria Labor 
Congress, Trade Union Congress (TUC), and Center for Free 
Trade Unions (CFTU) - have announced their support for the 
strike.  Many civic, student, and professional organizations 
have also publicly endorsed the \"stay-at-home\" call.  We have 
also heard reports of student groups in some southern areas 
such as Lagos State and Delta State, holding \"warm-up\" 
strikes.  Some oil service companies in Warri, for example, 
suspended operations on October 6, due to one such pre-strike. 
 
(Comment:  The fuel price hike is universally reviled and 
President Obasanjo\'s popularity is flagging.  It is thus no 
surprise that so many unions/organizations have announced 
their support for the strike.  However, it remains to be seen 
how long a \"stay-at-home\" can be sustained.  The fuel price 
controversy has served as a rallying point for many Nigerians 
who are frustrated with the government on  issues not solely 
related to the price hike.) 
 
6.  (U)  In practical terms, we expect most public 
educational institutions to close or have limited operations 
on Monday.  Local contacts say food markets will likely be 
closed during the day, with some opening at night for those 
who \"forgot to stock up.\"  Financial institution contacts are 
expecting staff to report to work, but banks may not fully 
open to the public, due to concern about possible violence. 
The stock exchange expects to trade normally.  The strike\'s 
impact on manufacturing companies will likely vary by company 
and by geographic location.  Oil companies report they plan 
to operate normally.  (Note: Most of the oil companies are 
located on self-contained compounds and/or are off-shore. 
End Note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
Labor Pulling Out All Stops To Make Sure Strike Holds 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7. (U) Desperate to ensure the strike\'s success, the NLC has 
issued detailed \"mobilization\" instructions to its 36 state 
councils. Several symposiums have been held in the Lagos area 
in the run-up to the strike in order to \"sensitize\" the 
public.  On October 6, the NLC began distributing T-shirts, 
badges, leaflets, and handbills to communities in the Lagos 
area.  NLC leader Benson Ukpa expressed to Abuja poloffs his 
satisfaction with pre-strike preparations and claimed that 
\"all of Nigeria\" supported the NLC in this strike. 
 
8. (C) Comment:  The NLC, hurt by Senate approval of a new 
labor bill and a federal court decision that claimed the NLC 
doe not have the authority to call on strike on fuel taxes is 
doing its best to ensure the strike happens. Adherence to the 
stay-at-home is as much a referendum on public support for 
the NLC as it is on the government\'s decision to raise fuel 
prices. 
 
------------------------------ 
GON Won\'t Brook Demonstrations 
------------------------------ 
 
9. (S/NF) GON security contacts told Embassy Abuja that the 
security presence in Abuja, Lagos, and other flashpoints 
would be increased in anticipation of the strike.  RMSA 
reports that GON security services have been ordered to 
quickly thwart any violent demonstrations. 
 
10. (C) To forestall flight disruptions at Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport (MMIA) during the protest, aviation 
authorities have put in place several contingency plans. 
According to a Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) 
official,  Air Force personnel and FAAN security personnel 
will be placed in strategic areas around the airport. 
Authorities have also arranged for the transportation and 
accommodation of air traffic controllers during the 
stay-at-home.  (Comment: We expect international flights to 
continue operations.  Domestic flights are less certai, 
particularly should the strike last longer than a few days.

Preparations - Batten Down The Hatches, 
Stock Up on Money and Food 
--------------------------------------- 
 
11. (U) Bank contacts reported cash withdrawals have 
increased significantly as clients anticipate the need to 
make substantial purchases of food and other supplies over 
the weekend. Many banks said they were considering opening 
over the weekend to meet the extra demand. 
 
12. (C)  As reported refs b and c, the Mission is also taking 
precautionary measures of assuring adequate fuel supply for 
generators and motor vehicles and preparing a warden message 
alerting the non-official community to increase their 
security posture as warranted.  Both American schools will be 
closed on Monday.

Nigerian Shell Workers Stage Unrelated 
Warning Strike; Oil Production Not Affected 
------------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU)  In an unrelated event, Nigerian employees of 
Royal Dutch/Shell began a two-day \"warning strike\" October 7, 
protesting long-planned company-wide downsizing.  Shell 
announced in March 2004 it planned to streamline its 
operations in Nigeria.  According to the press, oil union 
workers oppose the offerered severance package and allege 
Shell is skewing jobs in favor of expatriates.  A Shell 
External Relations representative in Port Harcourt confirmed 
that there is no connection between the Shell strike and the 
proposed NLC strike.  He also confirmed that oil production 
has not been affected.

This cable has been cleared by Embassy Abuja. 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: The crisis-ridden, Yoruba dominated Alliance 
for Democracy (AD) party selected former Osun State governor 
Bisi Akande as its new national chairman in a September 29 
Lagos convention.  Party faithful hoped the convention would 
reconcile rival factions, putting an end to an embarrassing 
public tussle over the party chairmanship.  However, leaders 
of the Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere (AD\'s 
political progenitors), denounced the convention, announcing 
it was severing all ties with the party.  The Lagos State 
governor, Ahmed Tinubu, the lone AD governor, reportedly 
considered the convention a pricey necessity in order to 
bring the party back in compliance with Independent National 
Electoral Commission (INEC) regulations.  AD is reportedly 
casting for alliances outside of Yoruba land: courting VP 
Atiku (a close Tinubu friend) to join the party, should 
President Obasanjo not support him in his 2007 bid for the 
PDP nomination, as well as cozying up to aggrieved Delta 
groups.  However, AD still has a lot of internal 
house-cleaning before it can form effective partnerships. 
END SUMMARY 
 
---------- 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) Once a significant player on the Nigerian political 
scene, AD lost five of the six southwestern gubernatorial 
seats in the flawed 2003 elections, emerging with only the 
Lagos State governorship. The party was further weakened by a 
power struggle between rival national chairmanship aspirants, 
Mojisola Akinfenwa and Bisi Akande, for the post of national 
chairman, which culminated in two separate conventions being 
held late 2003.  The Independent National Electoral 
Commission (INEC) voided both conventions and gave the party 
an October 31, 2004 deadline to resolve its internal crisis 
or organize yet another new convention.  INEC threatened 
deregistration if the party failed to take either of these 
measures. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Internal AD Disputes Give PDP an \"Easy Ride\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Sola Iji, Ondo State chairman for the AD party met 
Polchief, Poloff, and Polspecialist on the eve of the 
September 29 convention.  Iji said the public rift between 
Akinfenwa and Akande had damaged the party\'s ability to 
retain and attract members and to be a voice in national 
politics.  AD party members are supporting other parties\' 
presidential hopefuls, merely because they want to be on a 
winning team, Iji claimed.  He commented that with AD 
consumed by internal crises, the governing People\'s 
Democratic Party (PDP) was having \"an easy ride.\" Iji said 
his state was neutral as to who emerged as the new national 
chairman.  The important thing was for the party to be 
reconciled and to return to compliance with INEC regulations. 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Afenifere Elders Stuck in Ethnic-Based Politics 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
4. (SBU) Iji complained Afenifere, the pan-Yoruba 
socio-political group that authored AD, continued to hobble 
the party\'s efforts to expand its support base.  Afenifere, 
he said, wanted to keep an iron grip on the party and pick 
its leaders.  This alienated both younger and non-Yoruba 
party members.  Iji remarked that the antagonists in the 
current crisis - Papa Adesanya, leader of Afenifere, 
Akinfenwa, and Adanke - are all septuagenarians.  It\'s time 
to make room for new leadership, he concluded, vowing that 
that AD would do so, \"with or without Afenifere.\" 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Lagos Governor\'s Office Has Eye on 2007; 
Seeks Alliance with VP Atiku 
---------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Folorunsho Folarin-Coker, Deputy Chief of Staff to 
Lagos State Governor Ahmed Tinubu, told Polchief in a 
separate October 4 meeting that the governor viewed the 
convention as a \"colossal waste of money.\"  Nevertheless, it 
was necessary in order to bring the party back into INEC 
compliance.  Folarin-Coker alleged the PDP was \"pulling the 
strings\" behind Afenifere in order to foment dissent within 
the party.  The new convention, he said, would therefore 
yield no positive results, since PDP/Afenifere machinations 
would undoubtedly continue.  Folarin-Coker also accused INEC 
of contributing to the AD crisis, saying, \"the only thing 
independent about the commission is the \"I\" in its name.\" 
 
6.  (C) Asked how the party planned to extract itself from 
the crisis, Folarin-Coker replied, \"money.\"  \"These 
conventions are meaningless.  With money, we will regain our 
ward, legislative, and gubernatorial seats.\"  Folarin-Coker 
said VP Atiku could provide the funds needed to restore party 
relevance, and in return AD could provide him a vehicle to 
run for the presidency, should he fail to win the PDP ticket. 
 He maintained that Lagos Governor Tinubu and VP Atiku were 
\"very close\" and were actively discussing strategic 
partnership, should President Obasanjo fail to endorse Atiku 
in 2007. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
Or We Can Ally With the Delta Groups 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Folarin-Coker averred that the governor\'s office and 
the AD party are also engaged in active discussions with 
aggrieved minority Delta groups.  Pressed for how a largely 
South-West Yoruba party planned to attract these disparate 
groups, Folarin-Coker acknowledged the lack of \"perfect 
ideological congruence.\"  However, he insisted that as 
elections approached these groups might find the AD the \"best 
suitable bedfellow.\" 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Convention Atmospherics -- Music, Dance, and More Music; 
Akande Wins while Afenifere Pouts 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8.  (U) PolSpecialist reported the convention had a festive 
atmosphere, as traditional musicians and singers ushered 
attendees into the stadium and delegates and guests sang and 
danced for hours.  Prominent party members including former 
AD governors and legislators attended the event, as did 
representatives from several other political parties.  The 
most important attendee, however, was the Independent 
National Electoral Commission (INEC), whose presence was seen 
as giving the stamp of approval to what party adherents hope 
will be the final, conclusive national convention. 
 
9.  (U) Approximately 4000 delegates voted to choose the 
party\'s national executives with former Osun State Governor 
Bisi Akande emerging as the party\'s new chairman. Leaders of 
the Akinfenwa faction did not attend the convention. 
Immediately after the convention, Afenifere leaders denounced 
the affair and reaffirmed their support for Akinfenwa as the 
party\'s \"authentic leader.\"  On October 5, Afenifere declared 
it was severing all ties with the party. (Comment:  We may 
not have seen the last of the tattered Afenifere-AD alliance. 
 Afenifere leader Adesanya is reportedly trying to sidle up 
to new AD chair Akande in hopes of keeping his relevance. 
End Comment.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) This convention was stricken with the flaws of the 
prior two disputed conventions.  The roster of delegates made 
the outcome pre-ordained.  That many Afenifere leaders and 
Akinfenwa partisans boycotted the meeting is no big surprise. 
 Few people are keen on attending an event at which their own 
public political demise is an integral part of the 
proceedings.  That Afenifere is now publicly estranged from 
the AD demonstrates how far Afenifere has fallen in recent 
times.  If it sold stock, one could buy Afenifere shares at 
distress values.  The split also shows that the AD leadership 
is now independent of Afenifere and feels confident enough in 
its strength or in Afenifere\'s weakness to absorb the 
latter\'s wrath.  The convention may have tapped Akande as the 
new AD chairman, but it confirmed Lagos Governor Tinubu as 
the real leader of the AD. 
 
11. (C) Tinubu is a close political ally of VP Atiku, and 
there has never been much love lost between Tinubu and 
President Obasanjo.  Tinubu will continue to people the AD 
leadership with people that look like him.  He will also try 
to keep his opponents in Afenifere on their haunches by 
fomenting division within that group.  In this vein he called 
an Afenifere meeting on October 5 in which Senator Ayo 
Fasanmi was appointed Afenifere deputy chairman.  Meanwhile, 
Presindent Obasanjo and his cronies want to control the 
Southwest.  They will continue to use Afenifere and disunity 
in the AD to weaken the party.  The notion is plausible that 
VP Atiku may see the AD as an insurance policy should his bid 
in the PDP be unsuccessful.  However, we think Atiku would be 
reticent to fund the AD knowing that such a move, if 
uncovered, would sink him in the PDP. 
 
12. (C) With the withdrawal of Afenifere and possibly the 
Akinfenwa group, the AD may emerge from the convention as a 
less divided party.  But it is also a smaller one, shorn of 
many of its founders and leading members.  The new 
leadership, not so wedded to pan-Yoruba ideals, may be more 
willing to reach out to other groups.  Ironically, because of 
the political split in Yorubaland, they will have less to 
offer these groups.  In the final analysis, the AD is safe 
only in Lagos State.  It will be hard pressed to gain 
meaningful allies among other groups in Southern Nigeria. 
Its best hope does not lie in what it can do for itself but 
in waiting for internal divisions within the PDP to send 
disgruntled PDP members its way.  Until then, the PDP stands 
as the big winner in this latest Afenifere-AD flap because it 
will likely weaken the AD\'s appeal in Yorubaland.

closed.  Very little commercial transportation is available. 
While some senior executives are able to report to work, the 
vast majority of workers, who depend on public transportation 
could not go to work, even if they so desired. Most 
businesses are expected to re-open after 4:00 p.m. 
 
4.  The first phase of the strike is planned to last until 
Octber 14.  The strike will be suspended for two weeks to 
provide government time to roll back the price increase as 
well as to give the populace a respite.  If the price 
increase is not retracted after two weeks, the strike will 
resume indefinitely.  Labor leaders also reserved the right 
to extend the initial four-day strike should there be clashes 
between security forces and labor activists resulting in 
casualties.

Classified By: RSO Kevin Maloy. Reason 1.5 (B) and (D). 
 
1.  (S/NF)  To review Post planning and recent developments, 
Lagos core EAC convened the first day of the national strike. 
 The strike has been called by the National Labor Congress 
and other organizations to protest a fuel price increase 
recently instituted by the federal government.  In attendance 
were the CG, RSO, RMAS, MGT, CON, DEA, POL/ECON, ISC, DAO, 
and FBI. 
 
2.  (SBU)  RSO advised OSAC and oil company contacts reported 
relative calm in the vicinity of Victoria and Ikoyi Islands. 
There are reports of violence by area boys (street gangs) in 
several areas on mainland Lagos, specifically in the 
Maryland, Oshodi, Mushin, and Ketu neighborhoods.  Also, 
reports indicate area boys along the Badagry road toward the 
Benin border have been see attacking private and commercial 
vehicles traveling in the area. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The international airport is operating however the 
domestic airport anticipates difficulties in maintaining fuel 
supplies should the strike continue.  Apparently, there has 
been a reduction in domestic flights due to the concern over 
the fuel supply.  Also, local fuel stations and schools 
remain closed. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The EAC concurred there remains uncertainty 
whether the strike will remain relatively passive (i.e. 
stay-at-home) or will involve protests or demonstrations and 
increased violence. 
 
5.  (SBU)  The EAC reviewed essential staffing for 
10/12/2004.  The Consular Section plans to open on Tuesday 
and Consulate staff will report for duty unless annual leave 
is taken with concurrence of their supervisors.

REF: LAGOS 1920 
 
1. (U) This update includes: 
 
-- Airfare Increase of 40% Expected for Domestic 
Flights 
-- Runway to Shut Down for 8 Months at Lagos 
International Airport for Safety Upgrades 
-- Textile Leaders in the Lagos Area Want to Take 
Advantage of AGOA 
-- Cadbury Nigeria Thrives Despite High Production 
Costs 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Airfare Increase of 40% Expected for Domestic Flights 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (U) While the nation braced for the nationwide stay- 
at-home October 11 in protest over announced fuel price 
hikes, domestic airline operators saw this as the 
opportune moment to decide increased fares.  The press 
reported that fares for domestic travel might increase 
as much as 40 percent due to the expected cost increase 
for jet fuel. (Note:  Most domestic tickets currently 
cost about 10,000 naira (around $75). End Note.) 
However, an official from a domestic airline, Overland 
Airways, told econoff each airline will decide their 
fare increases.  While some companies may seek a forty 
percent hike, others may not. 
 
3. (U) Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) 
Chief Passages Officer, Victor Arisa, told Econoff past 
fuel increases negatively affected domestic airlines. 
People opt for alternative means of travel than pay 
higher fares.  For now, Arisa said, the airfare hike is 
simply being discussed as a possibility.  Comment: Some 
rate of increased fares is expected as carriers pass on 
their increased fuel cost to the consumer. However, 
most observers believe an across-the-board 40 percent 
hike is unlikely.  End comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Runway to Shut Down for 8 Months at Lagos International 
Airport for Safety Upgrades 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
4. (U) Meanwhile, the Murtala Muhammed International 
Airport has closed one of its two runways for re- 
surfacing and rehabilitation.  Domestic and 
international flights will therefore share a single 
runway for up to eight months.  Federal Airports 
Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) General Manager of 
Security, Mrs. A.A. Faworaja, told Econoff the closure 
will not affect flight schedules due to the mutual 
exclusivity of most international and domestic takeoff 
and landing flight times.  The runway\'s rehabilitation 
is expected to cost more than 2 billion naira (about 
$15 million). 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Textile Leaders in the Lagos Area Want to Take 
Advantage of AGOA 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
5. (SBU) Econoff and Econspec recently met with J.P. 
Olarewaju, Executive Director of Nigerian Textile 
Manufacturer\'s Association and Nigerian Textile Mills 
management.  Olarewaju said Nigerian textile 
manufacturers were in bad shape.  In the past seven 
years, nearly 50 mills have closed around the country 
and eleven are currently in danger of the same.  The 
GON banned textile imports in January 2004 to help 
ailing manufacturers; but cheap smuggled imports still 
make their way into Nigeria, crowding out locally-made 
products.  Nigerian textile manufacturers want to take 
advantage of AGOA to boost sales but few have the 
capability to produce textiles for the US market, 
Olarewaju said. 
 
6.  (SBU) Dangote-owned Nigerian Textile Mills told 
Econoff and Econspec it is one of only two or three 
Nigerian textile producers preparing to export to the 
US today.  Dangote Group companies are part of the 
privileged few enterprises in Nigeria with the capital 
base to invest in new equipment and training to meet US 
production and quality standards.  During the meeting, 
Nigerian Textile Mills management pleaded for US market 
information (Note: Econoff referred them to the Lagos 
AGOA Resource Center (reftel) End Note.) 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: President Obasanjo\'s appointed 
Special Advisor on AGOA has been actively prmotoing 
AGOA opportunities to Nigeria\'s textile manufacturers 
through meetings and symposiums.  However this cajolery 
will be largely ineffective until Nigerian 
manufacturers gain the capacity to manufacture 
competitively priced, quality goods.  End Comment. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Cadbury Nigeria Thrives Despite High Production Costs 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
8. (SBU) During a September 24 visit to the Cadbury 
Nigeria processing facility, Managing Director, Bunmi 
Oni, told CG and Econoff that Cadbury is successfully 
navigating the challenges of the Nigerian business 
environment -- uneven power supply, import bans and 
high tariffs on product inputs, and high corporate 
taxes.  Despite high production and ancillary costs, 
Cadbury is doing well.  The company\'s profits have 
increased for each of the last four years and Oni 
predicted that current production would triple or 
quadruple over the next four years. 
 
9. (SBU) To cope with a nationwide power supply 
problem, the energy-intensive Cadbury factory has its 
own eight megawatt power transformer on site.  Cadbury 
also has its own water supply and purification system. 
To cope with the erratic quality and output of Nigerian 
sugar and cocoa crops, Cadbury Nigeria takes measures 
such as providing local cocoa farmers with higher- 
quality plants, or importing products at a higher cost. 
To minimize the impact of Nigeria\'s poor infrastructure 
and the vagaries of its overall agricultural system, 
Cadbury has decided to become as self-contained an 
operation as possible. 
 
10.  (U) Comment: Cadbury Nigeria is proof that 
companies can be successful in Nigeria despite the 
challenging production environment.  However, companies 
have to be innovative and also have access to 
sufficient capital to help them invest in ways that 
overcome Nigeria\'s infrastructural inefficiencies.  For 
companies willing to take on the vast Nigerian market 
opportunities and risks, Cadbury is a successful model 
of ingenuity, resourcefulness and good management.

     B. ABUJA 1727 
 
This is a joint report from Embassy Abuja and Consulate Lagos. 
 
1.  (U) Summary: The nationwide strike in Nigeria continues 
to be well-observed throughout most of Nigeria. Of major 
cities, Abuja apparently has been least affected by the 
strike. Despite on-going negotiations and intervening court 
cases, the strike will likely continue tomorrow on what 
should be the final day of this initial phase of the strike. 
However, labor leaders threatened to prolong the initial 
stay-at-home period because of deaths/casualties/arrests of 
strike participants. Oil production remains unaffected. There 
have been no reported security incidents involving American 
citizens.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Political Developments 
---------------------- 
 
2. (U) A National Labor Congress (NLC) contact told us the 
GON had filed suit with an Abuja High Court seeking permanent 
injunction barring the NLC from continuing the strike. The 
contact said the suit was designed to force the NLC to 
suspend the strike until the court could hear the case, which 
could take months. If the court ruled against the NLC, NLC 
leaders would be forced to choose between calling off the 
strike or risking court sanctions, including possible arrest. 
 
3. However, an official at the Federal Ministry of Labor and 
Productivity told Embassy Abuja she did not think the GON is 
seeking an injunction against the NLC. Rather, she believed, 
the hearing today was on an appeal filed by the GON against 
the injunction the NLC won earlier preventing the GON from 
raising fuel prices. Mission was unable to confirm either 
report or to ascertain the outcome of the court proceedings. 
(COMMENT: Both sides are going to court to try to gain legal 
justification for their positions. What happens in the court, 
however, may be insignificant because at bottom, this is a 
test of competing political wills and agendas. End comment.) 
 
------------------------------- 
Reports from around the Country 
------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) LAGOS: An NLC monitoring team reportedly was attacked 
October 12 by a gang at Ojuelegba round-about. Another NLC 
team clashed with police yesterday at Iyana-Ipaja. No serious 
injuries were reported. Today, \"area boys\" are burning tires, 
blocking traffic, and harassing motorists in the Aja area. 
International flights are operating normally, but domestic 
flights have been scaled back due to low numbers of 
passengers. Most filling stations remain closed today. Banks 
still report low staff turn-out; skeletal services are being 
rendered at head offices and most branches are closed. 
Contacts report that operations are significantly reduced at 
Lagos and outlying ports. Military and police officers were 
observed at the Lagos port facilities. 
 
4.  (U) Circumstances regarding the October 12 death of 
aviation union activist Jerry Agbeyegbe remain cloudy (ref 
b). Police initially claimed he died in a car accident; most 
other reports indicate he was shot in his car sometime during 
the early morning. The National Union of Air Transport 
Employees (NUATE) and other aviation employee associations 
are expected to issue statements today calling for a judicial 
inquiry into the alleged killing. An autopsy is being 
conducted. 
 
5.  (U) AWKA: Newspapers reported that the nine labor leaders 
arrested on Monday were released on bail Tuesday, following a 
protest march and pleas for their release by other labor 
leaders. 
 
6. (U) PORT HARCOURT: There was significant violence on 
October 12 around Eleme Junction, following the shooting 
death of an adult male (ref b). Fighting was also reported 
around the Shell residential area and the airport.  The city 
is calmer today. The strike continues, but more vehicles are 
on the road and some shops and markets are open. Oil service 
company offices remain closed, but production operations 
remain unaffected. 
 
7.  (U) WARRI: The strike continues in Warri. Police patrol 
the streets. The commercial wing of the airport is closed. 
Few filling stations are attending customers. 
 
8.  (U) ONITSHA: There is more movement of people and traffic 
today. The main market and some government offices opened. 
National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) was reportedly 
operating and collecting payments from customers. Some banks 
also opened. Most schools remain closed. 
9.  (U) IBADAN: Like yesterday, people are moving freely and 
schools are open. Most government offices remain closed. 
 
10.  (U) ENUGU: Public offices and schools remain closed. 
Commercial activities continue unaffected. 
 
11.  (U) KADUNA: Offices and schools remain closed.

SUBJECT: Nigeria: TELECOM COMPANIES FACE NIGERIA MARKET 
CHANGES 
 
 
Summary: The July 2004 Central bank decision requiring 
25 billion naira minimum capitalization for all banks 
has affected the telecommunications sector.  Banks have 
reduced their loan portfolios in order to minimize 
their risks and thus appear more attractive as a 
potential partner for merger with other banks.  Bank 
mergers are one of the ways institutions are coping 
with the recapitalization requirement.  For 
telecommunications firms, this shrinkage of loan funds 
comes at a bad time.  Due to strong competition in the 
sector, major telecom operators have been slashing 
connection fees, reducing acquisition costs, and 
introducing value added services in an effort to 
increase and/or maintain market share.   The Nigerian 
Communications Commission (NCC) plans licensing changes 
in 2006 that will further liberalize the sector, 
bringing fixed operator licenses more in line with GSM 
licenses.  End summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Banks on Loan Recovery Drive; Telecoms Hard-Hit 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U) Since the Central Bank of Nigeria announced 
reforms requiring banks to recapitalize to 25 billion 
naira ($188 million) by the end of 2005, most banks 
have tried reducing risk assets by calling in existing 
loans and decreasing the number of new loans and 
credits.  The telecoms, major recipients of bank 
credits since wireless telecoms took off in 2001, have 
been hard hit by these recovery efforts. 
 
3. (U) Since liberalization of the telecom sector in 
2001, telecoms have been an attractive sector for 
Nigerian banks - second only to the oil/gas industry. 
In 2003, Stanbic Bank, in a consortium with 15 other 
smaller banks, granted MTN -- the largest mobile 
telephone company -- a N53 billion ($398 million) short- 
term loan. 
 
 
4. (U) Perhaps an unintended consequence of the CBN 
capitalization requirement, Dirk Smet, Managing 
Director of Starcomms Telecomm, said his company 
responded to the new rule by satisfying local debts. 
Starcomms\' debt for its Nigeria operations is now 
entirely external. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Keener Competition In Telecoms; Connection Fees Fall 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (U) The Nigerian telecom consumer is becoming more 
sophisticated as service provider options and telecom 
consumer education expand.  While the Nigerian telecom 
market is large and the potential for future growth is 
enormous, there is a saturation point for any given 
time period and for players like Starcomms, Smet 
believes that point may be closer than many people 
think. 
 
6. (U) In their efforts to maintain customers, telecom 
operators have been lowering connection fees despite 
the fees\' importance in generating the majority of 
telecom profits.  Telecoms are also offering value 
added services like internet and data transmission. 
Reduction in access charges and elimination of negative 
billing (whereby a customer is billed for periods when 
the line was used on credit) have also become major 
selling points. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
More Liberal Sector Guidelines To Be Introduced 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
7. (U) Exclusivity rights of GSM operators end in 2006 
when the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) plans 
to introduce at least three unified licenses to Private 
Telecom Operators (PTOs). Unified licenses will cover a 
larger area, including across currently sacrosanct 
state borders.  This will allow fixed wireless to 
operate more like mobile phone services. Investors are 
expected to respond favorably to the liberalization. 
 
8. (U) Presently, MTN, Vmobile and Glo Mobile have 2 
million, 1.5 million and 1.3 million subscribers 
respectively.  State-owned Mtel has about 800,000 
subscribers while PTOs like Starcomms have about 
100,000 subscribers on each of their networks. The 
introduction of unified licenses will significantly 
increase PTOs\' subscriber base. 
 
-------------------------------- 
PTOs Talk With Foreign Investors 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. (U) Some telecom companies have already started 
talking to foreign investors in anticipation of the 
unified license policy.  According to Smet, Starcomms 
is presently talking with investors in the US and UK, 
including Emerging Market Partnership (EMP) of 
Washington, DC. He believes the next 18 months will be 
important for Nigeria\'s telecom industry as competition 
for limited local and international financing grows.

1. (U) Summary. The nationwide strike continued for its 
fourth day. The joint labor-civil society coalition will meet 
in Abuja this afternoon and is expected to suspend the strike 
for two weeks as planned. Oil production remains unaffected. 
Around the country, many banks, offices, and schools remained 
closed, though movement and commercial activity increased 
from yesterday. There have been no reported security 
incidents involving American 
citizens.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday declined the 
GON motion for injunction relief to stop the four-day strike. 
 
3. (U) The joint labor-civil society coalition will meet in 
Abuja this afternoon to review the four-day strike. Coalition 
leaders are expected to formally suspend the strike for two 
weeks, in keeping with the resolution passed last week by the 
National Executive Council of the National Labor Congress 
(NLC). The coalition also will deliberate on strategies for 
the next phase of the strike, which would begin October 29 
should the GON and the coalition fail to reach an agreement. 
 
4. (U) Also, NLC President Adams Oshiomhole is expected to 
announce his decision on whether to continue participation in 
the standing committee established by the GON to identify 
measures to ease the hardship caused by the fuel price hike. 
Labor has previously criticized the committee as a tactic by 
the GON to finesse the public into seeing the price hike as a 
fait accompli. Publicly, Labor has stuck to the position that 
it would only be satisfied with a return to the former price. 
If Labor withdraws from the committee, both sides will have 
to identify another venue where GON-Labor negotiations can 
take place. 
 
5. (U) Oil sector contacts continue to report no effect on 
production.

In Oshogbo, members of the commercial drivers union 
reportedly seized the vehicles of union members not observing 
the strike. 
 
7. (U) ONITSHA: Movement of people and traffic has increased.

closed. 
 
8. (U) CALABAR: The governor\'s office operated on skeletal

9. (U) PORT HARCOURT: Banks remained closed, as did most fuel

vehicular movement is still less than normal, but people are 
moving freely. 
 
10. (U) DELTA STATE: The Delta State Council of the NLC 
reportedly decided to extend the strike to include Friday. 
The council said it will extend the strike to show solidarity 
with NLC President Oshiomhole, who was on his way to Asaba, 
the capital of Delta State, when he was temporarily detained 
last Saturday.

PRODUCTION LOSS FROM PIPELINE EXPLOSION 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian Browne for Reasons 1.5 (B & D) 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  On 10 October, a leaking Shell crude oil export 
pipeline which had been vandalized caught fire in the River 
State.  There were no injuries reported.  Shell confirms 
illegal bunkering as the cause of the leak.  Shell will cut 
production by 20,000 barrels a day for a few days while the 
pipeline is being repaired.  The community advocacy group 
Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has 
publicly complained about Shell\'s handling of the leak. 
MOSOP also claims their representatives and journalists 
investigating the incident were arrested by the State 
Security Service. 
 
Bunkering Causes Shell Pipeline Fire; No Injuries 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2.  (SBU)  On 10 October, a Shell crude oil export pipeline 
linked to Bonny Export Terminal caught fire.  The Shell 
External Relations Director confirmed that bunkering caused 
the pipeline leak.  A hacksaw was used to cut the pipe, which 
then leaked oil into a nearby pond; someone set the leak 
point aflame, causing an explosion in the pond.  Shell had no 
reports of any injuries from the incident.  Press reported 
that local youths initially prevented Shell from access to 
the site; the External Relations Director confirmed Shell has 
since been able to access the site.  In addition to reports 
of profits gained by bunkering, miscreants often caused fires 
to create a pretext for environmental and other damage claims 
against the company, he remarked. 
 
Shell Confirms Small Production Loss; Clean-Up Not Started 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Shell engineers are currently attempting to stop 
the leak.  They are assessing the scope of the clean-up 
operation, but have not yet begun to clean the spill. 
Repairs to the pipeline will take a few days. During that 
period, oil will be diverted to a narrower pipeline, and 
production cut by 20,000 barrels a day.  (Note:  Shell 
produces just over half of Nigeria\'s 2.3-2.4 million 
barrels/day, so the loss represents less than 1 percent of 
Shell\'s daily output.  End note.) 
 
MOSOP Notes Env. Damage, \"Inadequate\" Shell Response 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  The community advocacy group, Movement for the 
Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), has publicly complained 
about Shell\'s handling of the leak.  Press reports stated 
that MOSOP President Mr. Ledum Mitee, alleged \"up till now 
(Tuesday) containment measures had not been taken.\"  He said 
that oil from the leak had  reached a tidal creek and was 
threatening a large stretch of farmland.  Mitee denied that 
youths prevented Shell from gaining access to the site. A 
MOSOP representative told us the spillage started on Sunday 
in at least two points. Presently, the pipeline has been 
capped and the fire put out.  The MOSOP representative stated 
that the clean up process has not begun, as Shell brought 
\"grossly inadequate\" equipment to the site. He said the 
communities remained calm during the spillage and fire, and 
never stopped Shell from attending to the situation.  MOSOP 
is also investigating the cause of the spill. 
 
MOSOP: SSS Manhandled Journalists 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The MOSOP representative also stated that on 12 
October, while he and two MOSOP colleagues were at the site, 
they were detained by State Security Service (SSS) for 5 
hours.  The MOSOP officials said that they were not harmed, 
but that three journalists who were also arrested had their 
cameras seized and were \"severely manhandled\". 
Shell: \"Willing to Talk\" to Pressure Groups 
-------------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU)  The Shell External Relations Director indicted 
that Shell regards MOSOP as one of a variety of \"pressure 
groups.\"  He indicated Shell\'s willingness to talk to such 
community groups, but that the company does not view 
discussions with them as a substitute for discussions with 
competent local and state government authorities.  He also 
stated that Shell would be responding to what the company 
regarded as inaccurate statements by MOSOP in the press. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  The leak and fire come at a very 
inopportune moment.  The recent violence around Port Harcourt 
and the nationwide labor strike have tensions high and have 
generated skittishness in the international market.  The time 
of the incident might be coincidental.  However, it could 
also be an attempt by one of the militia groups to gain 
leverage and take action  in talks with the Government by 
reminding Abuja that they have the capacity to realize their 
threats against production.

point aflame, causing an explosion in the pond.  Shell had no 
reports of any injuries from the incident.  Press reported 
that local youths initially prevented Shell from access to 
the site; the External Relations Director confirmed Shell has 
since been able to access the site.  In addition to reports 
of profits gained by bunkering, miscreants often caused fires 
to create a pretext for environmental and other damage claims 
against the company, he remarked. 
 
Shell Confirms Small Production Loss; Clean-Up Not Started 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  Shell engineers are currently attempting to stop 
the leak.  They are assessing the scope of the clean-up 
operation, but have not yet begun to clean the spill. 
Repairs to the pipeline will take a few days. During that 
period, oil will be diverted to a narrower pipeline, and 
production cut by 20,000 barrels a day.  (Note:  Shell 
produces just over half of Nigeria\'s 2.3-2.4 million 
barrels/day, so the loss represents less than 1 percent of 
Shell\'s daily output.  End note.) 
 
MOSOP Notes Env. Damage, \"Inadequate\" Shell Response 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  The community advocacy group, Movement for the 
Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), has publicly complained 
about Shell\'s handling of the leak.  Press reports stated 
that MOSOP President Mr. Ledum Mitee, alleged \"up till now 
(Tuesday) containment measures had not been taken.\"  He said 
that oil from the leak had  reached a tidal creek and was 
threatening a large stretch of farmland.  Mitee denied that 
youths prevented Shell from gaining access to the site. A 
MOSOP representative told us the spillage started on Sunday 
in at least two points. Presently, the pipeline has been 
capped and the fire put out.  The MOSOP representative stated 
that the clean up process has not begun, as Shell brought 
\"grossly inadequate\" equipment to the site. He said the 
communities remained calm during the spillage and fire, and 
never stopped Shell from attending to the situation.  MOSOP 
is also investigating the cause of the spill. 
 
MOSOP: SSS Manhandled Journalists 
--------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The MOSOP representative also stated that on 12 
October, while he and two MOSOP colleagues were at the site, 
they were detained by State Security Service (SSS) for 5 
hours.  The MOSOP officials said that they were not harmed, 
but that three journalists who were also arrested had their 
cameras seized and were \"severely manhandled\". 
 
Shell: \"Willing to Talk\" to Pressure Groups 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Shell External Relations Director indicted 
that Shell regards MOSOP as one of a variety of \"pressure 
groups.\"  He indicated Shell\'s willingness to talk to such 
community groups, but that the company does not view 
discussions with them as a substitute for discussions with 
competent local and state government authorities.  He also 
stated that Shell would be responding to what the company 
regarded as inaccurate statements by MOSOP in the press. 
 
7.  (C) Comment:  The leak and fire come at a very 
inopportune moment.  The recent violence around Port Harcourt 
and the nationwide labor strike have tensions high and have 
generated skittishness in the international market.  The time 
of the incident might be coincidental.  However, it could 
also be an attempt by one of the militia groups to gain 
leverage and take action  in talks with the Government by 
reminding Abuja that they have the capacity to realize their 
threats against production.

REF:  STATE 203125 
 
1.  (U) This Message Responds To Reftel 
Request For Post\'s Assessment. 
 
2. (U) Nigeria is not technically part of the Safe 
Skies for Africa Program (SSFA), but has received very 
similar assistance under a parallel program combined 
with port security called the Nigeria Transportation 
Project.  The program is managed by DOT, in tandem with 
the SSFA program and Nigeria is considered \"active\" 
SSFA for discussion purposes.  In the five years since 
the DOT Nigeria Transportation Project was initiated, 
Nigeria has made significant strides towards improving 
aviation and, to a lesser extent, port facilities. 
Prior to the Nigeria Transportation Project, aviation 
service between the US and Nigeria had been suspended 
since 1993.  Port services were rendered by untrained 
port security personnel with no meaningful oversight 
from senior port authorities.  Today aviation security 
and safety is vastly improved, with Category One status 
for aviation safety within Nigeria\'s reach.  Port 
services, too, are improving. 
 
3. (U) Meeting aviation goals, step by step: Aviation 
service in Nigeria, specifically security, was 
sufficiently lacking that, in 1993, the FAA suspended 
direct flights to the US.  In large measure, thanks to 
the DOT Nigeria Transportation Project and aviation 
security technical assistance rendered by the former 
FAA Security, aviation security improved materially and 
the suspended ban was lifted in December 1999.  Other 
aviation achievements include: 
 
-- August 2000 open-skies agreement reached between the 
US and Nigeria.  The agreement facilitated three direct 
air services between Nigeria and the United States, 
accomplished with wet lease arrangements and a charter 
service.  These direct services have since failed for 
commercial reasons, but we anticipate Continental 
Airlines will begin direct service to Nigeria in early 
2005.  This would be the first scheduled direct service 
by a U.S. carrier to the African continent in more than 
10 years. 
-- Various technical assistance programs in the areas 
of aviation safety oversight, air navigation services, 
airport security and training capability with the 
Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Nigerian Airspace 
Management Agency, Federal Airports Authority of 
Nigeria, and the Nigerian College of Aviation 
Technology. 
-- Purchasing and installation of security screening 
equipment worth more than $2.5 million for Lagos, Kano, 
Port Harcourt and Abuja airports.  In addition training 
was provided to some 120 screeners. 
 
4. (U) Progress at the ports: Nigerian ports are of 
international importance, and a portion of the world\'s 
oil security depends on their accessibility.  The DOT 
Nigeria Transportation Project helps to ensure progress 
in security, stability and liberalization at the ports. 
Thus far, achievements include: 
-- Full port security and environmental assessment, 
-- Training courses for more than 150 Nigerian Port 
Authority personnel, 
-- Seminar on oversight and anti-corruption for 
Ministries of Transportation and Aviation. 
 
5. (U) Project Results: Aviation infrastructure, safety 
and security in Nigeria are greatly enhanced as a 
direct result of the USAID/DOT-funded Nigeria 
Transportation Project.  Missions led by the Office of 
the Secretary, as well as FAA visits and TSA 
inspections, have generated favorable reports of 
Nigeria\'s strides in these areas. 
 
6. (U) The DOT Nigeria Transportation Project plays a 
critical role in helping to secure US-Nigerian trade in 
petroleum.  Further improvements in access to Nigeria\'s 
exit and entry points would improve Nigeria\'s trading 
prospects and help make Nigerian goods more competitive 
on the world market.  These upgrades would also make 
Nigeria a more attractive market for U.S. business and 
investment.  Mission looks forward to continued 
collaboration with the Department of Transportation on 
these important endeavors. We hope to discuss areas of 
future cooperation at the October 25-29 Safe Skies for 
Africa Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa.

SUBJECT: WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE DELTA - A LAGOS 
PERSPECTIVE 
 
REF: ABUJA 1675 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Supplementing the views expressed reftel, 
this message provides Lagos\' perspective of the Delta crisis. 
This latest gush of violence is a moment of acceleration in a 
negative spiral that began years ago.  The eruption is a 
byproduct of not only the 2003 elections but also of economic 
stagnation, rivalries among local political actors, the 
deracination of traditional social structures, criminality, 
and an inchoate Ijaw nationalism that seeks to express itself 
in strident terms due to the coarse environment the Delta has 
become.  Because the Delta crisis is such a complex ensemble 
of factors, a quick fix is illusory.  Without sustained 
government attention to the political and economic 
underpinnings of this crisis and flexibility from Delta 
militants, we may see only a very brief respite before the 
temperature heats once more.  Because the crisis is in 
Nigeria\'s oil patch, it is the country\'s most significant 
internal national security threat.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Ijaw Nationalism- An Evolving Dynamic 
------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) Ijaws claim to be Nigeria\'s fourth-largest ethnic 
group. They comprise a near majority in the oil-producing 
Delta region.  Rival Ijaw militant leaders Al Haji Dokubo 
Asari(Niger Delta People\'s Volunteer Force - NDPVF) and Ateke 
Tom (Niger Delta Vigilante Group -NDVG) have been behind much 
of the violence that has occurred in Rivers State over the 
past several months.  While Tom is generally dismissed as a 
political thug empowered by Rivers State Governor Odili in 
the 2003 elections, Asari\'s leadership pedigree is more 
nuanced and his ultimate ambitions more veiled than his 
rivals.  Like Tom, Asari was employed to do local dirty work 
by the PDP (Obasanjo\'s party) during the 2003 election 
season.  He performed the job with relish.  Thus, that the 
2003 election was plush with fraud was not the reason that 
Asari broke allegiance with the local power structure.  It 
was the failure of Asari, Governor Odili, and Ateke Tom to 
reach a mutually satisfactory division of the spoils of 
victory that ended their relationship and put Asari on his 
present course. 
 
3.  (C) Odili had helped Asari obtain the presidency of the 
Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC) in 2001.  However, Asari apparently 
was more ambitious than Odili would willingly accommodate. 
Asari reportedly got involved with labor contracts at the 
port in Port Harcourt.  He hired out his men as protection 
squads to Odili rivals within the PDP.  He also put his hand 
in chieftaincy squabbles, thus challenging what Odili felt 
was his gubernatorial prerogative.  Moreover, Odili reduced 
his subvention to Asari and his minions once the 2003 
elections were over. 
 
4.  (C) Only after the break with Odili did Asari assume the 
mantle of militant Ijaw nationalist leader as the essence of 
his persona.  We believe the assumption of this role was more 
tactical than principled.  Yet, it has generated a certain 
dynamic that controls Asari perhaps as much as he controls 
it. 
 
5.  (C) Civil society sources in Rivers State say Asari has 
managed to dissociate himself in the public\'s eye from his 
foul play during the 2003 elections.  Many perceive Asari as 
a legitimate rebel leader with an attractive political 
platform -- sovereign national conference and greater 
resource control.  Jaye Gaskia, president of the 
Environmental Rights Association, told us Asari represents a 
blend of Ijaw nationalism, personal ambition, and economic 
opportunism.  One\'s final opinion of Asari rests on which 
element you grant the greatest weight, Gaskia maintained. 
 
6.  (C) Patterson Ogon (Director of the Ijaw Council for 
Human Rights) and Chief Edwin Clarke (traditional Ijaw ruler 
in Warri, Delta State) told us separately that Asari enjoys 
the moral support of many Ijaw elders.  They remarked that 
his demands are not distinct from claims the elders have been 
putting forth for years.  However both leaders reserved their 
prerogatives as elders to \"negotiate\" for the Ijaw people. 
7.  (C) Comment:  Whatever the true motives behind Asari\'s 
actions and rhetoric, he is now riding the undisciplined 
tiger of Ijaw nationalism, which makes him both a leader and 
a captive. He must move carefully.  If he tarries too long in 
negotiations in Abuja, people will begin to see him as a 
sell-out or ineffectual. However, if he does not show 
flexibility, further confrontation with the GON military is 
likely.  The adulation has probably caused him to start 
believing much of his own propaganda.  He will try to use 
this climb in his popularity to secure a position as the 
single most important Ijaw leader. However, rival Ijaw 
leaders -- militant and mainstream -- are not likely to cede 
easily to him.  End Comment. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Limited Ability to Disrupt Oil Production 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) As most recently demonstrated by Asari, militia 
groups in the Delta have the capacity to disrupt normal 
business operations in the energy sector.  Even without the 
direct threats of kidnappings, and sabotage, militants can 
quickly manufacture such an environment of instability that 
certain areas become \"no-go\" zones for companies, hindering 
necessary repairs and maintenance work, which might 
precipitate eventual production losses.  More to the point 
regarding the threat posed to Nigeria\'s national security, 
there are some tracts within the Delta that are ungovernable 
from Abuja because of the weak, short arms of the central 
government and its security apparatus. 
 
9.  (C) While any diminution in production could hurt Nigeria 
and rattle international markets, the extent of the potential 
disruption is limited by a range of factors, including 
facility distance from shore, security measures in place at 
oil facilities, and the heretofore unproven capability of the 
militias to conduct operations over a large distance. The 
independent research institution Menas of the United Kingdom 
assessed in its September 30 report that at most, crude 
supplies of 150,000 - 200,000 bpd of supplies are at risk 
from Asari out of the 2.4 million bpd produced by Nigeria. 
 
10.  (C) Extension of militia activity into Delta State, 
Bayelsa State, and other areas of Rivers State where Ijaws 
are a significant portion of the population could cast a 
shadow over more of Nigeria\'s oil production.  However, the 
quick expansion of this threat is unlikely for several 
reasons.  Primarily, it would imply a copycat or that Asari\'s 
influence has spread to these areas.  For now, we do not 
sense that other competing local militia leaders are willing 
to subordinate their ambition to Asari\'s just yet. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
GON Willingness To Talk - Good Political 
Strategy If Nothing Else 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) In the meantime, senior-level GON officials have met 
with NDPVF leader Asari in recent weeks. A contact with ties 
to the GON told us Obasanjo sees the recent flare-up as 
essentially a localized political spat that just happened to 
take place in the oil patch.  Obasanjo\'s aim is to talk Asari 
down to size and to hopefully revive the more moderate, older 
Ijaw leadership with whom he feels more comfortable and able 
to control. 
 
12.  (C) The level of distrust between the GON and Asari is 
palpable.  Ijaw community leader Patterson Ogon told us Asari 
felt President Obasanjo would stop short of addressing the 
fundamental Ijaw demands.  Patterson maintained that Asari\'s 
signature of the September 29 cease-fire document was thus 
\"tactical,\" designed to test how far Obasanjo would go. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Lots Of Aggrieved, But Few Carry The 
Punch Of Those In The Oil Patch 
------------------------------------- 
 
13.  (C) While Asari has not gotten what he wants from Abuja. 
 Just by meeting with Obasanjo, he has gotten more than most. 
 Asari\'s pilgrimage to Abuja and triumphal return home has 
sparked a lot of criticism, particularly by mainstream 
political opponents of the Obasanjo regime.  They have cried 
that the reward received for trying to work nonviolently 
within the system has been Obasanjo\'s silence.  Conversely, 
by brandishing weapons, Asari has gotten Abuja\'s undivided 
attention. 
 
14.  (C) The possibility of other groups taking a page from 
Asari\'s playbook cannot be discounted.  Noting the success of 
Asari\'s tactics in gaining the president\'s attention, some 
groups murmur they should take up arms as well.  However, 
other groups would find it difficult to approximate Asari\'s 
impact.  First, most do not operate in the oil-rich Delta and 
therefore lack the same strategic leverage.  Second, would-be 
guerrilla fighters from outside the delta region do not enjoy 
the same topographical advantages afforded by the Delta\'s 
murky swamps and creeks.  Militia groups from non-delta areas 
would likely find it more difficult to combat government 
forces.  Last, many of the grumbling organizations do not 
have the present capacity or funding to mount any significant 
tactical military operations. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Calls for National Conference Ever Present - 
But Will it Happen Or Matter? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C) Agitation for a sovereign national conference is 
increasing in Nigeria.  At the forefront of this effort are 
regionally or ethnically-based groups such as the Yoruba 
Afenifere, the Ohaneze Ndigbo (Igbo), Southern Minorities 
Movement, and Middle Belt Progressive Movement.  Members of 
these groups have formed an umbrella organization, the Ethnic 
Nationalist Forum, for the primary purpose of garnering 
support for a national conference.  President Obasanjo has 
consistently resisted a national conference, concerned it 
would become a venue for secessionist demands as well as to 
wrest power away from him.  Against this backdrop came the 
successful August 2004 stay-at-home strike organized by the 
Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of 
Biafra (MASSOB) in the Southeast.  Given the tragedy of the 
attempted Biafra secession, this strike caused the government 
to take notice. 
 
16.  (C) In an attempt to dampen agitation for a conference, 
presidential political advisor Jerry Gana publicly raised in 
early October the possibility of a \"national dialogue.\"  This 
trial balloon was also a chunk of bait.  The GON is 
attempting to see how many pro-national conference supporters 
it can co-opt.  Even if the government earnestly supported a 
conference, the planning would take months.  While there 
would be militant agitation at such a conference, the 
attendees would likely be carefully vetted to ensure the vast 
majority opposed any form of secession.  Even among the 
southern groups who endorse a conference and oppose Obasanjo, 
support for secession is not strong.  However, among these 
groups there are varying degrees of support for reducing 
presidential power within the national government, devolving 
power from federal to state institutions, reassessing 
resource allocation between the different tiers of government 
and reviewing the federal and presidential system of 
governance in favor of a parliamentary system. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (C) The outbreak of violence in the Delta region is 
rooted in economic stagnation, fighting over the spoils of a 
flawed electoral process, rising criminality, Ijaw 
nationalism, and the breakdown of traditional structures. 
Because this agitation comes from within Nigeria\'s oil patch, 
it represents a significant, highly visible challenge for the 
government.  This problem will not go away soon. GON 
willingness to talk appears to have been a good tactical move 
in the short run.  It might also have been the only true 
avenue open.  The attempt at dialogue has ushered in a moment 
of relative quiet. 
 
18.  (C) However unless substantive progress is made, raised 
expectations will metastasize into renewed frustration and 
possibly violence.   In the end, Obasanjo will temporize as 
much as possible and concede little.  The militants will want 
more, fast.  For talks to work, both sides will have to 
exercise a degree of statesmanship to which each is 
unaccustomed.  Given the level of distrust and gamesmanship, 
we suspect the new rounds of talks to yield little progress. 
 
19.  (C) Groups in other regions of Southern Nigeria will be 
closely watching how these talks unfold.  However, we do not 
predict that these other groups will imitate Asari\'s 
confrontational tactics.  Agitation for a national conference 
will likely be more of a political force in most of the south 
than will be armed aggression.  While political frictions 
exist throughout the southern tier of the country, most 
contacts do not see the continued viability of the Nigerian 
state as under imminent threat. 
 
20.  (U) This message has been cleared by Embassy Abuja.

WITH DELTA MILITANTS, CALLS FOR \"SINCERE\" NATIONAL 
CONFERENCE 
 
REF: LAGOS 2134 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C)  Summary:  In an October 14 meeting with the Consul 
General and Pol/Econ chief, Bayelsa State Governor 
Alamieyeseigha, Nigeria\'s only Ijaw governor, downplayed the 
import of talks between the GON and Ijaw Delta militant 
leaders Dokubo Asari and Ateke Tom.  Clearly seeing Asari as 
an usurper who could encroach on his position in the Ijaw 
leadership condominium, Alamieyeseigha dismissed Asari as a 
\"CNN creation.\"  He maintained that a national conference was 
required to address fundamental problems plaguing the Delta 
region and Nigeria as a whole.  However, Alamieyeseigha held 
out little hope that the GON would convene earnestly such a 
conference.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Ijaw Grievances Are Real, But Asari Is A Fraud 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2. (C) Bayelsa State governor D. S. P. Alamieyeseigha is the 
lone Ijaw governor in the Niger Delta region.  Ijaws claim to 
be Nigeria\'s fourth largest ethnic group and to comprise a 
majority of inhabitants of the oil-rich Delta region.  Asked 
about recent talks between militant leader Dokubo Asari and 
the GON, Alamieyeseigha responded that Asari was a \"CNN 
creation\" who had been given a world stage by a single 
journalist, i.e. CNN\'s Jeff Koinange, whose reputation in 
Nigeria could use some varnish.  \"Asari is a nothing who at 
the last minute decided to use the Ijaw cause,\" the governor 
averred, in an implicit reference to Asari\'s recent past as 
political hireling of Rivers State Governor Peter Odili.  The 
governor heaped blame on Odili for \"arming those boys\" during 
the 2003 elections and sharply criticized Odili for \"not 
exercising the leadership\" to disarm Asari and others once 
the elections were over.  Alamieyeseigha dismissed the notion 
that Asari now might be too much for Odili to handle, noting 
that he (Alamieyeseigha) had summoned Asari for talks and had 
no difficulty in getting Asari to come and see him. \"If Odili 
wanted to stop this, he could,\" Alamieyeseigha concluded. 
 
3.  (C) Alamieyeseigha predicted that \"nothing much\" would 
emerge from the GON-Asari talks.  The GON does not have the 
political will to bring meaningful change to the Delta or for 
the Ijaws.  Meanwhile, no matter how much noise Asari makes, 
he has not been cloaked with the raiment of Ijaw leadership. 
He is not authorized to cut a deal on behalf of the group. 
 
4. (SBU) The governor told us the problems of the Ijaw and 
Delta are well-known.  Oil is the Nigerian lifeline. Yet the 
Delta which bears the brunt of oil-related environmental 
degradation has no control over oil resources and has not 
benefited from the tremendous revenues that revert to the 
GON.  Speaking more like an Ijaw activist than the chief 
magistrate of a multi-ethnic state, the governor maintained 
that Ijaws were insufficiently integrated into the central 
government power-structure and decision-making apparatus. 
While Ijaws represent the fourth largest ethnic group, they 
have always been woefully underrepresented in national 
offices, ministerial appointments and as recipients of the 
concomitant patronage that flows from occupying these 
offices.  Buttressing his points, he remarked that there is 
no electricity in Bayelsa state. He further claimed that no 
Ijaw had been in a visible position of power at the federal 
level since 1979 when Joseph Wayas held the senate 
presidency. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
National Conference Needed, But GON Not Sincere 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
5. (C)  To achieve long-term stability, Alamieyeseigha 
maintained that Nigeria needs political restructuring -- more 
federalism, less central government.  The Delta peoples 
require greater decision-making participation and increased 
resource control.  Delta residents, he said, should be 
strategic partners with the oil companies and with the 
federal government.  On the national level, Alamieyeseigha 
said the federal government should engage in increased and 
better consultation with the states.  There should also be 
greater minority political participation. 
 
6. (C) Alamieyeseigha said in his view a national conference 
would be the best vehicle for advancing these issues and 
addressing fundamental problems plaguing Nigeria as a whole, 
and the Delta region in particular.  The desired outcome 
would be a downsized federal government, increased 
independence at the state level, and greater resource control 
for Delta peoples.  He stressed the indivisibility of Nigeria 
and said change should come through dialogue, not arms. 
 
7. (C) Alamieyeseigha had scant confidence the GON would 
convene such a conference.  He said that President Obasanjo 
was not seriously contemplating a conference.  Moreover, he 
felt that Obasanjo did not really believe in dialogue or in 
listening to opposing viewpoints.  For Obasanjo, dialogue as 
a mere stalling tactic -- engage the opponent in talks so 
that you might weaken his activism.  He noted that \"Delta 
stakeholders\" had been meeting with the President for years, 
with no tangible results.  Alamieyeseigha concluded that even 
if the GON convened a national conference, it would freight 
it with endless committees and reports, resulting in few 
substantive changes. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C)  Although an elected governor, Alamieyeseigha spoke 
almost exclusively from his Ijaw heart.  What he sees as Ijaw 
political and economic deprivation clearly rankles him. 
However, while Alamieyeseigha wants greater resource control 
for Ijaws, he is not prepared to countenance upstart Ijaw 
militants who seek to supplant his leadership role as the 
most important Ijaw office holder.  While he castigated 
Asari, Asari is ironically the governor\'s ally.  Asari\'s 
antics have embarrassed and undermined the national office 
aspirations of Rivers State Governor Odili.  Alamieyeseigha 
wants the South-South to produce the 2007 PDP 
vice-presidential candidate, but Odili is not who he has in 
mind.  Given the importance of the Ijaw, he thinks the person 
to be elevated to that position should be Nigeria\'s lone Ijaw 
governor -- himself.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA ECONOMIC UPDATE OCTOBER 2004 
 
1. (U) Summary: Nigerian manufacturers estimate they 
lost roughly USD 150 million due to the October 11-14 
nationwide fuel price strike.  The strike may resume as 
early as November 1.  Several local airlines have 
increased fares on domestic routes, primarily in 
response to the increase in aviation fuel costs.  Fuel 
supply has also been a problem for the airlines.  Banks 
continue to consolidate in order to meet the 
capitalization requirement set by the Central Bank of 
Nigeria (CBN).  US bank, Citigroup (NIB), underscoring 
its long-term to the Nigerian market, broke ground on a 
N3.2 billion (USD 25 million) new head office complex 
in Lagos. End summary. 
 
2. (U) This update includes: 
 
-- Strike: Businesses Count Losses 
-- Domestic Fare Increases; Shortages of Aviation Fuel 
-- More banks Mergers 
-- Citibank Nigeria Builds New Head Office Complex 
 
----------------------------------- 
Strike: Businesses Count Losses And 
Brace for Possible Phase II 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Since the October 11-14 national strike against 
the government-mandated September 23 fuel price 
increase, businesses have been counting their losses. 
The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) 
estimated the strike took approximately N20 billion 
(USD 150 million) out of its members\' pockets. 
 
4. (U) The Nigerian press has been rife with reports of 
further price hikes in the offing, triggered by the 
escalating world crude-oil prices.  However, the 
Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPRA) has 
stated that it did not expect further price increases 
yet, since products now being sold were imported 
previously, when world market prices were lower. 
(Note: Gasoline sold at N43 per liter before the 
September 23 increase. Currently it sells for between 
N52 and N55 across the country.  Diesel increased from 
N52 to N60 and kerosene from N50 to N62 per liter. End 
Note.) 
 
5. (U) The two-week respite given at the end of the 
October 11-14 strike by the NLC and other strike 
organizers expires November 1.  The NLC has ordered its 
affiliate unions and state councils to \"mobilize\" for 
phase II of the strike, but it has not yet announced 
the strike\'s official resumption.  Talks between labor 
leaders and the GON continue. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Domestic Airfares Increase; Aviation Fuel Shortages 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
6. (U) Effective October 11, Nigerian domestic air 
carriers increased fares between N1500 and N4500, which 
represented about a 20 percent mark-up.  The managing 
director (MD) of one airline told us the fare increases 
result from the rise in aviation fuel prices and from 
fuel supply concerns.  (Note: Domestic retailers 
increased aviation fuel prices by 28 percent on 
September 9.)  The MD stated that airlines in the 
competition-fierce domestic industry have been 
reluctant to raise fares in response to previous fuel 
price hikes for fear of losing customers.  However, the 
latest increase was too large for the carriers to 
absorb.  The other part of the equation, the MD said, 
was fuel supply, which he characterized as \"haphazard.\" 
The MD said the supply problem was especially acute in 
Abuja. Routes between Abuja and smaller airports such 
as Ibadan and Ilorin were becoming unreliable. Some 
airlines have chosen not to raise the nominal price of 
their flights but have added a hefty \"fuel surcharge.\" 
 
 
------------------ 
More banks Mergers 
------------------ 
 
7. (U) Banks continue to consolidate in order to comply 
with the CBN\'s July 6 directive requiring all banks to 
recapitalize to N25 billion ($188m) by December 2005. 
Two mergers occurred in October. The new banks are 
Astrabank (made up of Manny, Guardian Express, First 
Atlantic and Assurance banks) and Sterling Bank 
(Prudent, Magnum Trust, EIB International, NBM Bank and 
Trust Bank of Africa). 
 
8. (U) Astrabank has a combined network of over 120 
branches, total asset N71 billion ($533m), total 
deposit N48 billion ($361m) and total shareholders 
funds N11 billion ($82m). While Sterling bank also with 
about 120 branches, has total asset base N100 billion 
($751m), a total deposit base about N66 billion ($496m) 
and total shareholders fund N15 billion ($112m). 
 
9. (U) The banking recapitalization initiative yielded 
its first acquisition in October as Guaranty Trust Bank 
(GTB) acquired Inland Bank.  Stating a need for country- 
wide strength, GTB which had strong operations in 
southern Nigeria acquired Inland bank, whose 44 
branches were primarily located in the north.  This 
acquisition will raise GTB\'s capital base from its 
current N34 billion ($255m) to an estimated N40 billion 
($300m) by end-2004. 
 
10. (U) Meanwhile, some banks continue to try to meet 
the CBN requirement by raising funds from the stock 
market. Notable among such banks are Oceanic bank, 
Access bank and Afribank. Oceanic bank floated its 
initial public offer (IPO) to raise N16 billion or 
$120m, while Access bank is attempting to raise N8.7 
billion or $65.4m. Afribank, which is partly state- 
owned, also went to the market to raise about N9 
billion or $67.7m. (Comment: Some analysts are 
skeptical the market can accommodate all the IPOs in 
the offing. End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
Citibank Nigeria Builds New Head Office Complex 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
11. (U) On October 22, Citigroup (Nigeria International 
Bank) held a ground-breaking ceremony for its new N3.2 
billion ($24m) head office complex in Lagos.  The 
building is expected to be completed by December 2006. 
With over $87 million (N11.6bn) in investments, 
Citigroup (NIB) represents the largest US investment in 
Nigeria outside the energy sector, providing some 400 
jobs in Nigeria.

 1. (C) Summary:  The ruling PDP controls the governments in 
all the southern states except Lagos.  As so often happens 
when a party obtains such dominance, most political friction 
in the south is no longer the child of inter-party 
competition. It is a product of the leviathan party\'s own 
internal dynamics and inconsistencies. Throughout the south 
President Obasanjo is attempting to throttle his internal 
opposition, many of whom are allied with Vice President 
Atiku. This has produced fissures in many state PDP 
organizations. Obasanjo will win many of these confrontations 
but, in the process, several PDP state chapters will be 
bruised and weakened.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
PDP: Control The South, Control The 
Party...And Perhaps The Country 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (C)  The Independent Nigeria Elections Commission (INEC) 
awarded the PDP all Southern States, except Lagos, in the 
2003 elections; Elections universally criticized as stained 
by fraud.  The PDP is demonstrably stronger in the South than 
the only other party that claims a nationwide base--the ANPP. 
Conversely, the ANPP is stronger in the North than the PDP. 
 
3. (C)  As conventional wisdom now stands in Nigeria, he who 
controls the PDP, should control the presidential and most 
others elections in 2007.  Although constitutionally barred 
from the 2007 election for now, Obasanjo is working hard to 
make his imprint the one that dominates the party and the 
next electoral cycle.  A key strategy toward achieving this 
objective is to squelch all known opposition within the PDP. 
The often clumsy, heavy-handed  pursuit of this mission has 
spawned some successes but it has also generated greater 
discord underneath an already rancorous party tent.  What 
follows are a few illustrative examples of Obasanjo\'s 
hard-line strategy against internal opposition within the PDP. 
 
---------------------------- 
Things Fall Apart in Anambra 
---------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) Anambra State has become a hotbed of political 
intrigue.  This is due in part to the intense struggle among 
competing local politicians and their allies in Abuja seeking 
to control both the State government and the party apparatus. 
 At the center are Governor Chris Ngige and millionaire 
businessman Chris Uba, Ngige\'s former partner, now mortal 
enemy. Uba, is the brother of Presidential Special Assistant 
Andy Uba--a member of Obasanjo\'s inner circle.  Due to this 
filial nexus, Chris Uba is seen as enjoying Obasanjo\'s 
support. Meanwhile Ngige is now aligned with VP Atiku. Uba 
has been trying to oust Ngige because Ngige reneged on a 
pre-election  arrangement that would have ceded a 
considerable windfall from the state\'s coffers to Uba. 
 
5. (C) While Uba has been stalking Ngige, the PDP national 
executive council, controlled by Atiku allies, expelled Uba 
from the party.  In an apparent show of support for Uba, 
Obasanjo overturned the expulsion. Since then Uba has been 
unrelenting in his efforts to realize Ngige\'s downfall. Uba 
has gone to the extent of publicly claiming he helped Ngige 
rig the election, stealing it from All Progressive Grand 
Alliance (APGA) candidate, Peter Obi.  An APGA official has 
told us APGA has been holding close door talks with Uba in an 
attempt to arrange a deal that would give their candidate the 
gubernatorial chair.  Uba has clearly suggested to APGA that 
his involvement in the talks and his ability to deliver was 
based on the support of his brother and of President Obasanjo. 
 
6.  (C) National Assembly elections in Anambra have also been 
a battleground between Obasanjo and Atiku allies.  Prior to 
the 2003 elections, PDP\'s Executive Council forwarded to the 
Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) names of 
three senatorial candidates in Anambra state.  The three 
candidates--Ben Obi, Joy Emordi, and Christian Ukchukwu, all 
Atiku confederates--won the elections in their respective 
senatorial districts.  However, the party executive wrote a 
letter asking INEC to replace the apparent victors with three 
other party members.  INEC acceded to the party\'s request and 
the three men--Ikechukwu Abana, Emma Anosike, and a Ugochukwu 
Uba--were sworn in as senators. (Ugochukwu is Chris and Andy 
Uba\'s brother.)  Although an election tribunal faulted the 
entire process and ordered the process reversed, neither INEC 
nor the PDP has complied.  An unabashed braggart, Chris Uba 
has told many people that the President ordered the 
replacements.  Obasanjo has denied any role in the 
replacements. Yet, the normally decisive Obasanjo has not 
exerted his authority to make INEC or the PDP comply with the 
court order to reinstate the original candidates.  (Comment: 
If you were to ask many Anambrans, they would state the 
senatorial elections were twice stolen.  First, APGA probably 
won two of the seats but INEC gave the victory to the PDP, 
only for one faction of the PDP to take the spoils from the 
other.  This embarrassing episode is one of the reasons cited 
by world-renowned Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe in his 
October 18 refusal of Nigeria\'s second highest award, 
Commander of the Federal Republic.  End Comment). 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Abia State Crisis - Obasanjo Clips Governor\'s Wings 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
7.  (U) Abia State Governor Orji Kalu has been a long-time 
resident of Obasanjo\'s dog house and it does not look like he 
will be paroled any time soon.  On March 5, Kalu further 
kindled the President\'s ire by accusing the PDP leadership, 
including Board of Trustees Chair Tony Anenih, of plotting to 
assassinate him.  Kalu further alleged receiving phone calls 
from the President\'s office threatening him for making such 
an allegation.  Apparently unhappy with Kalu\'s antics, the 
presidency revoked the license of Kalu\'s Slok airline, citing 
alleged licensing infractions. In turn, Kalu attempted to 
dismiss his pro-Obasanjo Deputy Governor who had publicly 
contradicted Kalu by stating there was no plot to assassinate 
the Governor. After Abuja placed pressure on Kalu, he 
relented in chasing his deputy toward the exit ramp. 
However, Slok airlines remains grounded in Nigeria. (Comment: 
Kalu is a colorful politician who likes the swirl of 
controversy.  However, his popularity has waned appreciably 
since 2002.  This ally of VP Atiku and former lackey of 
ex-head of state Babangida is now vulnerable to political 
attack. Kalu\'s slump has little to do with Obasanjo\'s 
tactics.  His governance has deteriorated.  Meanwhile the 
success of APGA and the Movement for the Actualization of the 
Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) in the southeast has made 
many of the Igbo, PDP governors and other elected officials 
less germane to the politics of their region. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Obasanjo Has Smooth Sailing Within The PDP In Southwest 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
8.  (U) Unlike the Southeast where anti- and pro-Obasanjo 
forces within the PDP struggle, Obasanjo\'s opposition within 
the party is negligible in all five PDP controlled 
Southwestern states. Top loyalists like National Vice 
Chairman Bode George (recently sacked along with the board of 
the Nigerian Ports Authority over allegations of corruption) 
and prominent Oyo State politician Lamidi Adedibu appear to 
have successfully threshed opposition to Obasanjo in these 
states.  In this region, opposition comes mainly from the AD, 
personified by Governor Tinubu of Lagos State. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
South-South fights over Vice Presidential Ticket 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
9.  (C)  The big fights within the South-South states have 
been over the party\'s vice presidential ticket and over 
selection of the regional vice president in the party. With 
the presidential nomination likely to travel north, the VP 
selection will migrate South, perhaps to the South-South or 
Southeast. The Southwest is unlikely since Obasanjo from that 
area. His long tenure as president would militate against the 
region producing the next vice president. Pro-Atiku Governors 
Attah of Akwa Ibom, Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa, and Kalu of 
Abia are angling for the prize. Obasanjo apparently favors 
Rivers State Governor Peter Odili, chiefly because Odili 
checked his scruples at the door and delivered handsomely to 
Obasanjo in the 2003 election. Odili\'s fortune has suffered 
because of the recent violence in his state (reftels). 
Indicating his affinity for the governor, the usually gruff 
Obasanjo has given the velvet glove treatment to Odili by not 
directly upbraiding him for the commotion in Rivers or 
declaring a State of Emergency as Obasanjo did in Plateu 
State.  Apparently, Obasanjo hopes Odili can rebound from 
this detrimental episode. 
 
10.  (U) Second, there was intense competition among the PDP 
governors in the zone over replacement for the murdered 
Animasoari Dikibo, the region\'s National Vice Chairman of the 
party. The zone is split between the selection of Godspower 
Ake and Dr.Tarila Tebepah.  Ake is Governor Odili\'s Special 
Advisor and nominee and Tarila is supported by four of the 
other five governors (Cross River Governor Duke has remained 
neutral). The four governors alleged that PDP national 
headquarters imposed Governor Odili\'s nominee on the zone to 
prepare the groundwork for Odili to get the vice presidential 
nomination in the 2007 presidential elections. 
 
---------------------------------- 
The Law of Unintended Consequences 
---------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C) While attempting to render an iron grip on the party 
 machinery in the South, Obasanjo and his lieutenants should 
be careful about who they squeeze out and what the rejected 
might do. Two of the GON\'s greatest headaches are people who 
once were allied with the Obasanjo\'s faction of the PDP.  One 
is Alhaji Dokubo Asari, the central figure in the recent saga 
of the Niger  Delta.  The other is Ralph Uwazurike, leader of 
MASSOB in the Southeast. 
 
12.  (C) Banished from the PDP mainstream after losing favor 
in the Obasanjo camp, both men have taken actions seeking to 
make mainstream electoral politics irrelevant--Asari with his 
threat against oil production and Uwazureike by canvassing 
for Biafran independence. Most others who have been and will 
be dispossessed by the PDP will not go to such extremes, but 
many likely will seek solace in opposition parties. 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  (C) If not properly managed, the struggle for PDP party 
control could further aggravate schisms already hurting most 
of the party\'s southern chapters. In a bid to assert his 
authority, Obasanjo seemingly has empowered his loyalists to 
seize control of the various state machines in any manner 
they deem fit.  Due to the strength of Obasanjo\'s position 
and VP Atiku\'s waning influence in the south, Obasanjo 
loyalists will likely win a majority of these tiffs.  But the 
heavy-handedness is taking a toll on the party.  The Obasanjo 
group may gain tighter control of the southern PDP, but at 
the price of creating greater division within the party and 
of adding to the roster of ex-members who join the opposition.

SUBJECT: AVIATION FUEL SHORTAGES GROUND MANY DOMESTIC 
FLIGHTS 
 
REF:  Lagos 2195 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1. (U) An end appears in sight for the Nigerian jet 
fuel shortage, as a tanker is in the process of 
delivering 14,800 metric tons to Lagos.  Conoil 
Producing Limited, the downstream firm selected to 
supply aviation fuel to the country for this quarter, 
failed to make its October delivery.  As a result, over 
the last week, domestic airlines confronted serious 
shortages in aviation fuel. Numerous domestic flights 
were cancelled, consolidated, and/or delayed because of 
the supply problem.  According to the press, over 1,000 
passengers were stranded at Nnamdi Azikiwe airport in 
Abuja over the weekend.  Aviation fuel increased from 
N45 to N62 per liter in September and now is reportedly 
being sold for as high as N85. Some international air 
travel has been delayed by the shortage, and flights 
are landing in neighboring countries to obtain fuel. 
End summary. 
 
Conoil Defaults on Jet Fuel Delivery for Nigeria 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
2.  (U)  Press reported on November 8 that Nigerian 
firm Conoil defaulted on delivery of aviation fuel for 
the month of October; an emergency tender granted to 
African Petroleum PLC also failed to resolve the 
shortage.  Due to the high cost of importing fuel, the 
five downstream fuel marketers (Oando Plc, African 
Petroleum Plc, Mobil Oil Nigeria, Texaco Nigeria Plc, 
and Total Nigeria Plc) conduct an auction to determine 
which firm will be responsible for importing jet fuel 
for the quarter.  Conoil had won the bid for October, 
but defaulted on the actual delivery of the cargo. The 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has 
placed a one-year ban on Conoil importing jet fuel, as 
it failed to deliver a 30,000 metric ton consignment 
into the country. 
 
Jet Fuel Prices Climbing Since September 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Aviation fuel prices jumped from N45 to N62 per 
liter in September.  Deregulation in the downstream 
fuel sector caused the September price increase, but 
was subsequently compounded by Conoil\'s October failure 
to meet commitments to deliver fuel to the country. 
Since then the price of the fuel, known as Jet A1, has 
been steadily inching up.  It is now selling for as 
high as N85 per liter.  Domestic airline operators have 
passed on these cost increases to the customer through 
an overall fare increase and hefty fuel surcharges. 
 
Fuel Surcharges and Rising Ticket Prices 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  On November 4, Chachangi Airlines warned its 
customers via radio announcements that it would have to 
reduce its flights if the fuel supply remained 
uncertain.  Edward Boyo, Overland Airlines official, 
confirmed that his company was struggling to cope with 
the fuel scarcity.  Boyo said the price hike in fuel 
was only a secondary concern for most operators.  He 
said that some of Overland\'s flights were being 
cancelled, while others were being consolidated to put 
larger numbers of passengers on one flight.  Press 
reported that over the weekend, more than 1,000 
passengers were stranded at the domestic wing of the 
Abuja airport.  Press quoted the managers of numerous 
airlines saying that instead of several flights per 
day, they had been reduced to flying only one or two. 
Exxon Mobil has been able to continue to fly its 
personnel around the country, but Brazilian oil major 
Petrobras could not return some personnel from an 
offshore rig on November 5 due to the shortage of fuel. 
 
Oando Demanding Surcharges for Fuel 
----------------------------------- 
 
5. (U) Boyo said Oando, the only marketer currently 
dispensing fuel to domestic airlines, is  \"exploiting\" 
the scarcity. He alleged that some staff members of the 
company are demanding \"additional payments\" from the 
desperate airline operators.  Boyo called on the GON to 
better regulate the sector. 
 
Int\'l. Flights Diverted, Delayed, Due to Shortage 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6.  (U) International flights have been forced to land 
in neighboring countries, such as Ghana, to take on 
enough fuel to fly to Europe.  Energy sector contacts 
have confirmed that both Friday and Saturday British 
Airway flights to London were forced to land elsewhere 
to re-fuel, and were delayed for as much as six hours 
while the airlines attempted to locate fuel. 
 
Fuel Delivered and Resolution in Sight 
--------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U)  An official from Shell Nigeria Oil Products, 
Shell\'s downstream division, confirmed that a tanker 
with 14,800 metric tons of Jet-A1 fuel is at berthed at 
the Apapa Port in Lagos, and is currently discharging 
fuel to marketers.  The Shell official expects that the 
supply of jet fuel will return to normal as of the 
evening of November 9.

Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reasons 1.5 (B & D) 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) and allied civic 
organizations continue to lay the groundwork for a November 
16 nationwide strike.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole has 
threatened that the strike will be indefinite and targeted to 
affect oil production and export.  Over the years, many oil 
and gas workers affiliated with unions NUPENG and PENGASSEN 
have observed strikes, but have generally allowed essential 
workers to report for duty in order to shield production from 
disruption during a strike.  Oil majors have contingency 
plans in place and say they are prepared to weather the 
strike -- for a while.  However, if the strike lasts a 
considerable period and the NLC is succeeds in getting the 
unions to keep essential workers at home, then the strike 
will take the unprecedented step of affecting oil production. 
 End Summary 
 
NLC Lays Groundwork With November 3 Lagos Rally 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (U)  On November 3, the NLC and civil society groups 
organized a rally in Lagos as part of their mobilization 
campaign for the scheduled November 16 nation wide strike. 
The event is the first in the series of rallies planned by 
the coalition to boost compliance with the strike. Thousands 
of workers and ordinary Nigerians joined the procession.  In 
his address to the crowd, Oshiomhole asserted the strike 
would be indefinite and would be targeted to affect oil 
production and export. The rally ended abruptly but 
peacefully, when Lagos police insisted that the organizers 
had no legal permit to organize the event. 
 
3.  (U)  (Note:  Last week the NLC withdrew from the 
\"palliative committee\" established by the GON.  The 
committee\'s mandate was to recommend relief measures that 
would cushion the impact of the fuel price increase.  The NLC 
objected that reviewing the propriety of the fuel price hike 
itself should have been part of the committee\'s mandate.  In 
apparent reaction to the NLC\'s criticism, the GON announced 
November 4 that it was adding the issue of petroleum product 
pricing to the committee\'s agenda.  The NLC has since 
announced that it is re-joining the palliative committee. 
End Note.) 
 
GON Attempts to Avoid Strike 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  The GON is seeking court action to prevent the 
strike.  The Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear the case 
on 11 November.  The Ministry of Labor has announced that 
public sector workers participating in the strike will not be 
paid. 
 
GON, NLC, and Oil and Gas Union Relations 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Oil and gas sector workers are members of two 
unions: the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Workers (NUPENG), and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior 
Staff Association (PENGASSEN), and are affiliated with the 
NLC through the Trade Union Congress (TUC).  NUPENG is the 
union for more junior workers in the oil and gas sector, 
while senior and white-collar workers are members of 
PENGASSEN.   Since the early 1990s, Nigeria\'s oil and gas 
exports have not/not been affected significantly by 
industrial action.  While NUPENG and PENGASSEN workers 
generally have observed strikes, they have allowed sufficient 
number of their members to work so that production never 
suffered materially during previous strikes. 
 
Oil Unions Plan to Participate in Strike 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (C)  The two oil and gas sector unions met on November 9, 
and have announced that they will participate in the strike. 
Prior to this announcement, PENGASSAN\'s Secretary, Michael 
Fadakinte told PolSpec that his union will participate in the 
strike as directed by the Trade Union Congress, but may not 
be willing to stop crude oil export. In press reports on 
November 4, the Deputy President of PENGASSEN stated that 
PENGASSEN intended to maintain essential services \"until it 
becomes absolutely necessary to do otherwise.\" 
 
Chevron Texaco: PENGASSEN Key to Nigeria\'s Production 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7.  (C)  Chevron Texaco Environmental, Health, and Safety 
Manager Robnett reported that NUPENG and PENGASSEN typically 
wait until the last minute to decide whether to join a 
national strike.  Robnett expects jockeying and brinksmanship 
to continue until the strike begins.  She noted that the 
unions often hold discussions separate from the NLC with the 
federal government, using the threat of a production shutdown 
as a bargaining chip for gains in other areas.  Robnett 
confirmed that in the past, the oilfields have not shut down 
unless PENGASSEN agreed to strike.  In many cases, NUPENG has 
declared its support for a strike, but the workers in the 
fields continue to work. 
 
Exxon Mobil: Focused on Contingency Plans 
------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  Exxon Mobil External and Government Relation 
contacts indicated it was directing most of its efforts 
toward contingency planning in the event of a strike. 
 
Shell: NLC Wants Strike to Bite 
------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Shell reported that its union staff has often joined 
in national strikes, but workers have tended to shield 
production during such events.  However, the Shell External 
Relations Director indicated that the NLC wants this strike 
to \"bite,\" and so may require the unions to \"deliver on 
production.\"  Shell has a contingency plan to continue with 
production \"for some time\" in the event of a full work 
stoppage.  During past strikes, Shell has been able to 
maintain production for more than two and a half weeks.  As 
reported reftel, Shell is seeking a court injunction to 
prevent its workers from joining the November 16 strike.  The 
judge has adjourned the case until November 18; a success, at 
least temporarily, for labor, as it allows labor to launch 
the strike on November 16. 
 
10.  (SBU)  (Comment:  Shell is currently in the midst of a 
dispute with unions over re-structuring and terminating of 
some workers.  The unions have not been happy with severance 
packages offered to workers soon to be laid off; the unions 
led a two-day strike at Shell in recent weeks.  While the 
restructuring clash within Shell is separate from the NLC-led 
fuel dispute, Shell workers may join the NLC strike to gain 
an additional platform to voice discontent over 
restructuring.  End Comment). 
 
Halliburton: Echoes PENGASSEN Role is Key 
----------------------------------------- 
 
11.  (C)  A representative from oil service company 
Halliburton stated that the strike would hold.  Halliburton 
employees are both NUPENG and PENGASSEN members, who, in the 
past, have followed instructions from their national unions 
to join or sit out national strikes.  The Halliburton 
representative remarked the level of PENGASSEN\'s 
participation would determine the impact on the upstream 
sector. 
 
Seabulk: Export Maritime Operations will Continue 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
12.  (C)  Oil Service company and marine transport firm 
Seabulk forecasted there may be an impact on production, 
particularly on-shore, but that the effect would not be dire. 
 Companies more reliant on on-shore operations, (principally 
Shell, through its SPDC unit), will be hit hardest, as will 
companies with more Nigerian employees (Shell, AGIP). 
Seabulk management indicated full stoppage of maritime 
activities generally does not occur during national strikes. 
Maritime employees with Seabulk currently belong to NUPENG 
and PENGASSEN, but have not participated in past strikes. 
Export tankers are crewed largely by expatriates, and are 
generally not affected by strikes.  However, mooring, static 
tow, and other smaller work boats crewed by Nigerians could 
be affected by a strike.  If Nigerian crews were not 
available to carry out crew changes and re-supply of crews in 
the field, this might also eventually impact production.  In 
general, the maritime sector is more labor intensive than the 
energy sector, and more workers are required \"on deck\" to 
ensure the functioning of the vessels and cargo transport. 
In the unlikely event of Seabulk striking, management has 
indicated that it would attempt to bring in third country 
nationals to temporarily fill positions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (C) Most of our energy contacts indicated that once a 
production crew is in place in the field (typically working 
one to two week rotations), they will continue working 
regardless of a strike.  If history is an accurate guide, 
even if the strike is generally honored, we can expect 
production to continue normally for a few weeks. 
 
14.  (C) We will be in uncharted territory if strike is 100% 
successful with NUPENG, and more importantly, PENGASSEN 
employees, fully respecting the call to stay at home. 
Production could also be negatively affected if the strike 
last for more than three weeks.  A few points are clear: 
on-shore production will be affected more quickly than 
off-shore production, with Shell and AGIP being the most 
vulnerable due to their high levels of on-shore production 
and large numbers of Nigerian employees.  Exxon Mobil, with 
all production off-shore, is likely to be the least impacted.

 SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC) and allied civic 
organizations continue to lay the groundwork for a November 
16 nationwide strike.  NLC President Adams Oshiomhole has 
threatened that the strike will be indefinite and targeted to 
affect oil production and export.  Over the years, many oil 
and gas workers affiliated with unions NUPENG and PENGASSEN 
have observed strikes, but have generally allowed essential 
workers to report for duty in order to shield production from 
disruption during a strike.  Oil majors have contingency 
plans in place and say they are prepared to weather the 
strike -- for a while.  However, if the strike lasts a 
considerable period and the NLC is succeeds in getting the 
unions to keep essential workers at home, then the strike 
will take the unprecedented step of affecting oil production. 
 End Summary 
 
NLC Lays Groundwork With November 3 Lagos Rally 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (SBU)  On November 3, the NLC and civil society groups 
organized a rally in Lagos as part of their mobilization 
campaign for the scheduled November 16 nation wide strike. 
The event is the first in the series of rallies planned by 
the coalition to boost compliance with the strike. Thousands 
of workers and ordinary Nigerians joined the procession.  In 
his address to the crowd, Oshiomhole asserted the strike 
would be indefinite and would be targeted to affect oil 
production and export. The rally ended abruptly but 
peacefully, when Lagos police insisted that the organizers 
had no legal permit to organize the event. 
 
3.  (SBU)  (Note:  Last week the NLC withdrew from the 
stakeholders committee established by the GON.  The 
committee\'s mandate was to recommend relief measures that 
would cushion the impact of the fuel price increase.  The NLC 
objected that reviewing the propriety of the fuel price hike 
itself should have been part of the committee\'s mandate.  In 
apparent reaction to the NLC\'s criticism, the GON announced 
November 4 that it was adding the issue of petroleum product 
pricing to the committee\'s agenda.  The NLC has since 
announced that it is re-joining the committee.  End Note.) 
 
GON, NLC, and Oil and Gas Union Relations 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  Oil and gas sector workers are members of two 
unions: the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Workers (NUPENG), and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior 
Staff Association (PENGASSEN).  NUPENG is the union for 
laborers in the oil and gas sector, while senior and 
white-collar workers are members of PENGASSEN.  Since the 
early 1990s, Nigeria\'s oil and gas exports have not/not been 
affected significantly by industrial action.  While NUPENG 
and PENGASSEN workers generally have observed strikes, they 
have allowed sufficient number of their members to work so 
that production never suffered materially during previous 
strikes. 
 
Oil Unions Plan to Participate in Strike 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (SBU)  The two oil and gas sector unions met on November 
9, and have announced that they will participate in the

1.  (U)  Mission was contacted by OPIC this week to provide 
comments regarding environmental, worker health, and safety 
implications for the proposed West African Gas Pipeline 
(WAGP) project in Nigeria.  Mission is pleased to have the 
opportunity to provide these comments.  However, Mission 
does not believe it is possible to provide detailed feedback 
before the pending OPIC Board Meeting on 11 November.  Post 
is supportive of the project\'s goals, which include 
stimulation of the private sector through reliable power 
transmission, and progress on environmental goals, through a 
reduction in gas flaring and increased use of gas in place 
of less ecologically-sound alternatives. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Post is aware that a full environmental impact 
study on the project was carried out.  Nonetheless, OPIC 
should be aware that in a recent Nigerian press account, the 
non-governmental organization, Environmental Rights Action 
(ERA) has alleged potential negative impacts from the WAGP 
project, including destruction of farmland, adjacent 
villages, mangroves, and barrier beaches to clear access 
the pipeline route.  The press article or additional follow- 
on action by ERA could create a degree of negative public 
sentiment towards the project.  Mission will conduct 
discussions with project sponsors and local stakeholders 
regarding environmental/social issues relevant to WAGP.  We 
anticipate carrying out these meetings by the end of 
November, and issuing a Mission statement on the WAGP 
project soon thereafter.

ANAMBRA STATE

Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  In what appears to be a full throttle 
attempt to provoke a state of emergency in Anambra State, 
armed bands have been on a rampage in the state over the past 
two days.  They have burned government buildings, including 
the Governor\'s residence and State Election Commission 
building, media outlets and commercial facilities.  They also 
reportedly briefly held hostage some State Assembly members. 
Numerous state officials are now in hiding.  The police have 
been conspicuously absent. Just back from the United States, 
Anambra State Governor Chris Ngige was in Abuja when the 
violence erupted on Wednesday, and he has not returned to 
Anambra. President Obasanjo is holding an emergency security 
meeting, today, November 12 to discuss the unfolding crisis. 
The armed bands are likely the handicraft of millionaire 
Chris Uba who has been trying to oust Ngige since the two men 
had a falling out shortly after Ngige\'s disputed election in 
2003.  End Summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Armed Youths Go On A Rampage 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U)  According to press reports, roving bands burned 
and/or looted the following establishments over the two-day 
period, November 10-11: 
-- Governor\'s residence 
-- Deputy governor\'s office 
-- State Assembly Complex 
-- Women\'s Development Center (state-affiliated) 
-- Ikenga hotel (government- owned) 
-- Anambra State Broadcasting Service (two radio stations and 
one television facility) 
-- Anambra State Independent Electoral Commission 
-- Several commercial and private vehicles 
 
3. (U) Press and other sources reported that the police did 
not respond to the attacks against government facilities. 
The commissioner of the State Police pleaded \"helplessness\" 
in a television broadcast and sought the assistance of 
neighboring state commands.  Numerous Ngige supporters claim 
the police in some instances helped transport the marauders. 
Reports of the numbers of persons possibly killed during the 
violence vary widely.  The police claim no/no deaths; while 
Ngige\'s others allege up to 27 fatalities.  Most news reports 
put the death toll around 7-10. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Members of State Assembly Briefly Taken Hostage; 
Speaker of the State Assembly Pleads for USG Intervention 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4. (C) Mike Balonwu, Speaker of the Anambra State Assembly 
called Embassy Abuja November 10 reporting that \"anarchy\" was 
reigning in the state.  Balonwu alleged that Chris Uba was 
orchestrating the violence in an effort to disrupt local 
elections scheduled for December 18 and provoke President 
Obasanjo into imposing emergency rule.  In a November 11 
follow-up call with Consulate Lagos, Balonwu further claimed 
that the \"hoodlums\" surrounded his legislative quarters and 
briefly held him and other State Assembly members hostage, at 
which point the police \"evaporated.\"  Balonwu said he only 
managed to escape with the assistance of the State Security 
Service (SSS).  Balonwu reported that he and other state 
officials are now in hiding. 
 
5. (C) Balonwu urged USG intervention to prevent Obasanjo 
from declaring a state of emergency and replacing Ngige as he 
did Plateau State Governor Dariye.  It is time, Balonwu said, 
for Obasanjo to \"act like a leader and stop letting his 
friends do whatever they want.\" 
 
6.  (C) Chief O. Ukwa, an Igbo traditional leader and member 
of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), told us that he 
met Chris Uba and Chief Chris Orijiekwe, a PDP official, in 
Anambra state several days ago.  Ukwa recalled Uba 
cryptically saying that a plan was in motion to foil the 
planned December 18 local elections and to bring his feud 
with Ngige to a head.  Ukwa claimed that as this encounter 
was ending, Orijiekwe intimated that he would soon be \"number 
one in the state.\"  During this violent spate, Orijiekwe has 
been quick with public statements condemning Governor Ngige 
for losing control of the state and that the tumult was 
evidence of popular discontent with Ngige\'s governance. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Emergency Security Meeting in Abuja 
----------------------------------- 
 
7. (U) According to the press, President Obasanjo is 
convening an emergency meeting on the Anambra crisis, today, 
November 12.  The meeting is to be attended by Obasanjo\'s 
chief security advisors and Anambra State Governor Ngige. 
Ngige was in Abuja (on reportedly unrelated matters) at the 
time of the outbreak of the violence on Wednesday.  Ngige 
apparently has not sought to return to Anambra due to fears 
over his personal safety. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) This outcrop of violence is the latest episode in the 
long-running feud between Chris Uba and Chris Ngige.  As 
reported reftel, Uba has been trying to oust Ngige since 
Ngige reneged on a 2003 pre-election arrangement that would 
have ceded a considerable windfall from the state\'s coffers 
to Uba.  It is almost certain that Uba bankrolled this latest 
rampage.  Uba\'s goal is to make Ananmbra ungovernable so that 
Ngige is relieved of the helm.  His animus for Ngige has led 
the unrestrained Uba toward these extreme tactics.  Uba must 
have felt certain that he holds most of the aces before 
taking such a gambit.  The next few days and the meetings 
held by President Obasanjo in Abuja will show whether he 
assessed correctly if he succeeds in unseating Ngige.  If 
Ngige survives this latest attack from Uba, he must still 
contend with Uba\'s forces in the upcoming December elections, 
where Uba will attempt to further entrench his supporters. 
 
9.  (C) Comment Cont\'d:  It is not clear what would happen if 
Ngige is ousted.  One possible scenario is that Peter Obi 
would be eventually installed as governor. Obi was the All 
Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate who most 
Anambrans believe won the 2003 election (reftel).  APGA has 
filed suit protesting the 2003 elections and Obi and Uba have 
been in closed door talks, but no deal has been sealed. 
Alternatively, Uba is probably interviewing several PDP 
officials in the state to determine which would be the most 
pliant and trustworthy to do his bidding if placed in the now 
damaged governor\'s mansion. 
 
10.  (C) Comment Cont\'d.  Thus far, Uba has been given a long 
leash in creating mischief in Anambra.  However, Anambra is 
now an unalloyed national embarrassment that could hurt 
Obasanjo because of Uba\'s clear links to the President.  Uba 
probably now has the upperhand over Ngige.  But if the 
political backlash is too severe, Obasanjo might move to 
quiet Uba or even jettison him. End Comment.

1.  (C) Summary: Abia State Governor Kalu has announced that 
he will run for President in 2007. Kalu is being partially 
financed by VP Atiku, who likely is using the abrasive 
Southeastern governor as a stalking horse.  Meanwhile, 
Senator Nzeribe is bankrolling the very long-shot 
presidential campaign of Governor Udenwa of Imo State -- 
placing these two Igbo governors on a collision course. 
According to sources, Nzeribe wants to occupy the Imo 
Governor\'s mansion in 2007.  Lagos State Governor Tinubu and 
the South West Chairman of the People\'s Democratic Party 
(PDP) George continue to inveigh the other, with George 
accusing Tinubu of instigating the planned November 16 
national labor strike to embarrass President Obasanjo. 
Tinubu has vehemently denied George\'s allegation.  Privately 
Tinubu told us he would maintain law and order in Lagos 
during the strike, despite disagreeing with Obasanjo\'s 
deregulation policy.  The All People\'s Grand Alliance (APGA) 
is hopeful (but perhaps not very realistic) that 
soon-to-be-concluded court cases disputing the 2003 
gubernatorial races in Enugu and Anambra states will redound 
to the party\'s benefit.  End Summary.

Igbo Governors Stake Claims for 2007 Presidency 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
2. (C) The flamboyant governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu, has 
announced publicly his intention to seek the 2007 PDP 
presidential nomination.  As ambitious as he is bombastic, 
Kalu hopes to capitalize on the incessant agitation in the 
Southeast for an Igbo presidential candidate.  By seeking the 
mantle, he also hopes to refurbish his status as an upcoming 
youthful Igbo leader.  This image has been undermined by a 
skein of scandals plaguing Kalu\'s second term and by the 
rising popularity of the Movement for the Actualization of 
the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) and APGA in the 
Southeast -- two groups that also lay claim to the political 
voice of the Igbo.   Sources tell us that Kalu has been 
telephoning many of the Nigeria\'s political literati 
informing them of his plans.  Kalu has not been completely 
discreet regarding his backing, intimating to more than one 
person that VP Atiku is helping to finance his campaign. 
 
(Comment:  If Kalu\'s claim concerning Atiku is true, Atiku is 
playing one of several possible versions of a cynical, if 
astute, political game.  Atiku may be using Kalu as a 
diversion to shift President Obasanjo\'s attention away from 
Atiku and toward the irascible Kalu who the President 
probably dislikes more than he dislikes VP Atiku.  If this is 
the case, Kalu may be too taken with himself to induce that 
he is an expendable weapon in Atiku\'s armory.  Alternatively, 
Kalu and Atiku could have reached a gentleman\'s agreement 
whereby Kalu agreed to be the battering ram with the 
understanding that should Atiku be offered a presidential 
slot on the party ticket, Kalu would be offered the VP 
position.  The fault in that plan is that neither actor is a 
gentleman and such an agreement would crumble at the 
slightest instance that it no longer served one of the 
player\'s optimal interests.  End Comment.) 
 
3.  (C)  Meanwhile, Igbo sources indicate that millionaire 
senator Arthur Nzeribe is bankrolling the long-shot 
presidential aspirations of Imo State Governor Udenwa. 
Nzeribe\'s actions are not borne of affection for the Imo 
governor.  The crafty Nzeribe is known to be pining to occupy 
the governor\'s mansion in Owerri, capital of Imo.  By 
dangling a picture of the presidential mansion in front of 
the taciturn Udenwa Nzeribe hopes Udenwa will turn the keys 
to Imo over to him in 2007.

Lagos State Governor and PDP SW Chairman In War of Words; 
Governor Denies Agitating for National Strike 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
4.  (SBU)  Over the past couple of weeks, the local press has 
been replete with recriminations between Lagos State Governor 
Ahmed Tinubu and PDP SW Chairman Bode George, a staunch 
Obasanjo ally.  George has gone so far as to accuse Tinubu of 
bankrolling the scheduled November 16 national strike in an 
effort to embarrass Obasanjo\'s administration.  George has 
also threatened to \"deal with\" Tinubu.  Tinubu has vehemently 
denied George\'s allegation and has said that he takes neither 
kindly nor lightly George\'s threats.  (Comment:  George has a 
reputation of political rough-housing.  While nothing is 
proven, his critics link him to many of the incidents of 
violence in the Southwest against Obasanjo\'s political 
opponents.  End Comment.) 
 
5.  (C) Tinubu told the Consul General the last thing he 
wanted was violence to occur in Lagos as a result of the 
strike.  Not only would it result in potential loss of life 
or limb, it would be injurious to business investment. 
Moreover, he did not want to give Obasanjo a pretext to 
intervene in Lagos.  Consequently Tinubu said he would do all 
that he could to ensure that things did not \"get out of 
control\" during the strike.  He said that he had spoken with 
the police and instructed them not to behave too 
aggressively.  He also said he talked to student leaders and 
the market women\'s association, in which his mother wields 
significant influence.  Tinubu criticized Obasanjo\'s method 
of fuel price deregulation, arguing that instead of creating 
a \"palliative committee\" after-the-fact, Obasanjo, using 
excess oil revenues, should have provided an economic 
stimulus package contemporaneous to the price increase, which 
would have better mitigated the hardships resulting from the 
price hike. 
 
6.  (C) Overall, Tinubu characterized Obasanjo as a \"poor 
strategist.\"  The president, he said, should have moved to 
solidify a southern base across party lines.  This would have 
isolated his northern rivals -- the real threat.  However, 
since the President is incapable of tolerating and 
incorporating dissenting viewpoints, the south is more 
fractured than ever, with the exception that most people are 
now against Obasanjo, Tinubu said.  Tinubu confirmed that he 
and VP Atiku were talking about \"their future.\"  All options 
are open, he said.  Tinubu also believed that the President 
was still toying with a third term option (reftels). 
 
------------------------------- 
Courts to give justice to APGA? 
------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Peter Obi, the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) 
candidate believed to have won the 2003 Anambra gubernatorial 
race told us the court case contesting the election results 
is progressing well.  Obi has also been a frequent flyer to 
Abuja lately where he is said have had discussions with 
millionaire businessman Chris Uba.  Uba is widely believed to 
have financed the violence that engulfed Anambra state last 
week, which resulted in the razing of numerous prominent 
government facilities, including the governor\'s mansion. (ref 
B)  It is unlikely that Uba would have engaged in such a 
brazen gambit just to usher Obi into the governor\'s mansion 
-- at least not yet.  Uba and other allied kingmakers are 
probably interested in someone more pliant than the 
independent-minded Obi. 
 
8. (C) According to an APGA insider who lives in Enugu, the 
State Security Service (SSS) reportedly stopped Enugu State 
Governor Nnamani at the Abuja airport as he was attempting to 
leave the country with five - seven million dollars.  The 
funds were handed over to President Obasanjo who read Nnamani 
the riot act.  This incident may influence the already 
on-going court case protesting the 2003 elections in Enugu. 
APGA is also believed to have been the legitimate winner in 
that state.

TAGS: PHUM, PREL, KCRM, KWMN, NI 
SUBJECT: TIP: NIGERIA INTERIM ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: STATE 228458 
 
1.  When Post made its submission last March for the 2004 
TIP Report, the GON had just created the National Agency 
for the Prohibition of Traffic in Persons and Other 
Related Matters (NAPTIP).  With a staff of over 150 now 
in place, the fledgling agency has demonstrated its 
commitment to combating trafficking and has made a 
discernable level of progress in all areas described 
below.  However, inadequate funding for NAPTIP and other 
anti-trafficking efforts is a major constraint.  NAPTIP 
relies heavily on international organizations and foreign 
governments for financial and other support, particularly 
for assistance to victims.  Fortunately, international 
organizations report a good working relationship with 
NAPTIP. 
 
2.  The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) Anti-trafficking Task 
Force, which existed before the establishment of NAPTIP, 
also continues to combat trafficking.  The head of the 
task force reports that their activities have decreased 
as NAPTIP\'s have grown.  She commented that the task 
force now plays a \"complementary role.\" The task force is 
also under-funded, perhaps more so than NAPTIP.  Police 
officers claim that NAPTIP staff are better paid.  They 
commented that these perceived discrepancies do not 
foster a good working relationship. 
 
a) Progress made in reducing TIP-related corrupt 
practices by officials with responsibility for regulating 
cross-border movement. 
 
3.  NAPTIP officials realize that corruption is an 
important issue.  The agency has received reports from 
informants and foreign officials that law enforcement 
officers and individuals in the immigration and airport 
authorities collaborate in trafficking across Nigeria\'s 
borders.  To address the problem, NAPTIP has briefed the 
heads of police and immigration on the issue and warned 
them of the agency\'s resolve to investigate and prosecute 
any official involved in TIP offenses.  NAPTIP is also 
working with the minister of aviation to address 
corruption among airport officials. 
 
b) Progress made in increasing the number of 
investigations, arrests, and prosecutions of traffickers, 
as well as continuing the prosecution of those already in 
custody. 
 
4.  NAPTIP established its National Investigation Task 
Force (NITF) by selecting personnel with good records 
from among police and immigration officers.  The agency 
prefers to rely on NITF officers for its investigations 
rather than the police because of concerns about 
corruption and the quality of investigations. 
 
5.  NAPTIP has investigated thirty-five cases since 
February 2004, with many of the cases still pending.  The 
agency has collaborated with the Spanish police, the 
Italian National Anti-mafia Bureau, and the police force 
of the Benin Republic on investigations in several cases. 
NAPTIP has made arrests in thirteen cases.  Four cases, 
involving six traffickers, have gone to court.  One of 
the trials has been completed; NAPTIP officials are 
hopeful of a conviction when the court renders judgment 
November 18. 
 
6.  NAPTIP officials highlighted one case in particular 
as an example of \"best practices.\" This summer, NAPTIP 
apprehended two practitioners of traditional local 
religious magic who were used to facilitate trafficking 
by threatening victims with curses in order to procure 
their silence.  Officials confiscated items from the 
shrines of these two men and the men served as 
prosecution witnesses.  NAPTIP officials reported that a 
high percentage of girls and women trafficked believe 
that they have been placed under curses.  NAPTIP hopes 
the apprehension of these two individuals will help sever 
the instances of cooperation between traditional 
religious practices and trafficking in persons. 
 
7.  NAPTIP officials commented that investigations have 
been far more expensive and time-consuming than 
anticipated when the agency began.  They said their 
investigations so far have been reactive, built on cases 
in which a victim or trafficker has come into their 
custody.  The officials said in the future, pending 
funding availability, they would like to pursue cases 
proactively when they have information but no 
specifically known trafficker or victim. 
 
8.  The NPF Anti-trafficking Task Force has established 
and staffed eleven units in states with the worst 
trafficking problems.  The head of the task force said 
that units from five states have reported thirty-one 
cases, involving thirty-nine victims and fifty-one 
suspects thus far in 2004.  (Note: Records are not kept 
with enough precision at this point to determine which 
cases reported by the police overlap with those tracked 
by NAPTIP.) 
 
9.  Nigerian Immigration Service has anti-trafficking 
units in its seven zonal headquarters and in the states 
considered vulnerable. 
 
c) Progress made in training officials and traditional 
rulers in the new anti-TIP law and NAPTIP mandate 
 
10.  NAPTIP and the NPF Anti-trafficking Task Force have 
made progress in training officials and traditional 
rulers.  NAPTIP has trained its National Investigation 
Task Force on the provisions of the TIP prohibition law, 
care of victims, Interpol standards, and corruption and 
human rights issues.  Agency officials have delivered a 
lecture to police at the Command and Staff College in 
Sokoto State.  The NPF Anti-trafficking Task Force has 
trained senior officers as part of advanced detective 
courses at the Staff College in Jos, Plateau State.  They 
also have distributed copies of the TIP prohibition law 
to the police command office in every state. 
 
11.  NAPTIP officials delivered a lecture at the 
Immigration Training School in Kano to educate 
immigration officers on their role under the TIP 
prohibition law.  They also gave a lecture on the new law 
to judges and magistrates in the Southeast.  The agency 
is arranging to train judges in the South South, 
Northwest, and Central regions as well. 
 
12.  NAPTIP officials have met with several major 
traditional leaders to raise their awareness about 
trafficking and the new law, including the Oba of Benin, 
the Alake of Egbaland (Abeokuta), the Asagba of Asaba, 
and the Emir of Kano.  They said the Emir, perhaps the 
preeminent traditional leader in the North, was 
particularly upset to learn that some traffickers use the 
Hajj to traffic persons to Saudi Arabia. 
 
d) Progress made in assisting TIP victims once they are 
found. 
 
13.  The government has made progress in assisting 
victims.  NAPTIP serves as the point of contact for 
immigration and police officials when victims are found. 
Seventy-four victims have passed through the agency in 
2004.  NAPTIP has directly provided overnight shelter to 
some, but most often, agency officials connect victims to 
nongovernmental or international organizations for 
shelter, counseling, and reintegration assistance.  In a 
couple cases, the government has helped victims 
repatriate to Nigeria.  NAPTIP also has helped to reunite 
several trafficked children with their families. 
 
14.  The Nigerian federal government donated a building 
for a 120-bed shelter in Lagos for a ten-year period to 
be run by the International Organization for Migration 
(IOM) and NAPTIP.  With US and Italian government 
support, IOM renovated the building, which also includes 
offices for IOM and NAPTIP staff.  The US government 
(G/TIP and USAID) provided funds for the salaries of IOM 
and NAPTIP staff for up to one year and for 
transportation, psychological counseling, and personal 
items for victims.  The shelter was opened July 22, 2004. 
However, IOM reports that the shelter is now closed due 
to a lack of operating funds.  NAPTIP expects to open the 
shelter again within a month. 
 
15.  For victims serving as witnesses, a divisional 
police officer is appointed to serve as the witness 
protection officer.  NAPTIP officials and the officer 
work together to provide assistance.  NAPTIP also created 
a brochure to let victims know the agency exists to help 
them if they would like to pursue prosecution.  The 
brochure is distributed to deportees returning to Nigeria 
in hopes that it will encourage unidentified trafficking 
victims among them to come forward.  The brochure has 
prompted at least one woman returned from Italy to 
contact NAPTIP. 
 
16.  The Ministry of Labour and Productivity, in 
collaboration with the ILO, NAPTIP, the police and other 
federal agencies, has a program to provide food, 
transportation, and other logistical assistance to 
reunite internally and externally trafficked children 
with their families. 
 
17.  At the state level, the government of Akwa Ibom has 
donated a shelter for trafficked children and has pledged 
to establish a skills acquisition center.  The government 
of Kano State is working with UNICEF to establish a 
shelter for victims. 
 
e) Progress made in developing an anti-TIP media campaign 
 
18.  NAPTIP has created a website to provide information 
to the public (www.naptip.gov.ng).  The agency also has 
established a hotline for victims and anyone seeking or 
wanting to provide information about trafficking.  The 
hotline is staffed twenty-four hours a day.  The number 
is provided on various NAPTIP publications and through 
other agency efforts.  The ILO also has incorporated the 
hotline number into its TIP awareness raising efforts. 
 
19.  NAPTIP has developed a good working relationship 
with the media.  The agency has distributed copies of the 
anti-trafficking law and other materials to various media 
offices.  NAPTIP involved the media when officials 
visited the eleven states with the worst trafficking 
problems to publicize the new anti-TIP law.  NAPTIP 
officials have appeared on national talk shows and state 
programs.  They have developed a relationship with 
newspaper bureau chiefs to encourage them to give TIP 
stories prominence when they arise.  Some police chiefs 
also have worked to publicize cases in the media. 
 
20.  NAPTIP has developed and produced television 
advertisements in English and Pidgin English.  The ads 
aim to publicize the existence of NAPTIP and its 
commitment to pursuing traffickers and assisting victims. 
The agency does not have funding to air the ads, but 
officials have approached the minister of information as 
well as private companies and the European union to ask 
for support.

SUBJECT: GON PROMISES FUEL PRICE REDUCTION AND LABOR 
SUSPENDS STRIKE 
 
 
1.  (U) On November 15, the GON announced it would 
reduce the price of fuel to N49 per liter. Responding 
to the promised price reduction, the Labor and Civil 
Society Coalition (LASCO) suspended the strike planned 
to begin November 16. Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) 
President Adams Oshiomhole told journalists that the 
decision was promoted by the price reduction as well as 
by last week\'s court order restraining the NLC from 
embarking on the strike.  Oshiomhole said the decision 
to suspend the strike is subject to change, however, if 
the price reduction is not implemented within the next 
week. 
 
2.  (U) Denja Yakub, NLC assistant secretary, told 
Polspec that LASCO suspended the strike to ensure that 
the coalition complied with the court order. The court 
has not yet ruled on the GON appeal contesting the 
NLC\'s right to strike. Both parties were ordered to 
return to court on November 17 to argue their cases. 
The court order issued last week restrained the NLC 
from striking until a ruling was made in the appeal 
case. 
 
3. (U) Although the strike was called off, many 
Lagosians decided to remain home today. Vehicular 
traffic was much lighter than normal and many workers 
did not report to duty. The suspension of the strike 
has caused the local business community to give a 
collective sigh of relief. Two attorneys who represent 
major banks told the Consul General that depositors at 
their banks were making massive withdrawals in 
contemplation of the threatened indefinite strike. 
Firms in other sectors were also bracing for loss or 
dislocation of business. We expect Lagos to return to 
normal tomorrow.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ECPS, ECON, EINV, NI 
SUBJECT: NIGERIA: SECOND ATTEMPT AT NITEL TELECOM 
PRIVATIZATION 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: Nearly three years after a failed 
attempt to privatize state-owned Nigerian 
Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), the Bureau of 
Public Enterprises (BPE) is again seeking investors for 
the company. Currently under a three-year management 
contract with Dutch company, Pentascope BV, NITEL is 
trying to improve its chances of attracting credible 
investors by expanding its network, particularly in the 
Lagos area. NITEL management and staff seem more 
compatible with the attempted privatization than during 
the first round. End summary. 
 
----------------------------- 
Another Privatization Attempt 
----------------------------- 
 
2. (U) State-owned Nigerian Telecommunications Limited 
(NITEL) is again slated for privatization, following a 
failed attempt about three years ago. The Bureau of 
Public Enterprises (BPE) is accepting expressions of 
interest (EOI) for 51 percent of the GON\'s equity in 
NITEL. 
 
3. (U) The BPE also plans to sell 20 percent of the 
remaining 49 percent shares on the stock market through 
an initial public offer (IPO). Though scheduled for the 
last quarter 2004, the IPO may be deferred. According 
to Suleyman Ndanusa, Director General, Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), BPE has not requested the 
required SEC approval for an IPO. (Comment:  Once a 
request has been submitted, the Commission\'s approval 
could be obtained within one month. But it is unlikely 
an IPO will be approved before the year ends, since BPE 
has not yet submitted its request.  End Comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
NITEL May be More Attractive to Investors Now; 
Staff Support Privatization 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
4. (U) NITEL\'s Lagos Zone General Manager, Young Eyo, 
told us the company is more marketable than it was two 
years ago.  Key marketing features include NITEL\'s 
monopoly of the SAT3/WASC cable facility and the 
operation of a more reliable GSM subsidiary, M-TEL. The 
Southern Africa Western Africa Submarine Cable 
(SAT3/WASC) and South Africa-Far East (SAFE) cable is a 
15,000-kilometer high performance fiber optic cable 
connecting Europe, South Africa and the Far East. It 
provides cheaper, high quality alternatives to 
satellite links. (Comment: However, there is talk that 
the GON may transfer the operation of the SAT3 to 
another state-owned agency. If so, NITEL would likely 
become less attractive to prospective buyers. End 
comment.) 
 
5. (U) Eyo said NITEL management and staff more clearly 
see the inevitability of the company\'s privatization 
than they did three years ago. The firm\'s recent focus 
on customer care and aggressive marketing has helped 
reorient staff, he said.  Akin Olufade, the Deputy 
General Manager of Operations, Lagos Zone, added that 
staff is earnestly looking forward to full 
privatization and an improvement in operations and 
conditions of service. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Network Expansion; NITEL Tries to Face Competition 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. (U) The Lagos Zone remains a major hub for the 
company\'s activities. However it has lost many 
customers to private telecom operators (PTOs), which 
offer better services, mostly using GSM and fixed 
wireless technologies. This keen competition is 
inducing the state-owned company to expand its network 
in the zone.  Earlier this year, the company awarded 
Germany\'s Siemens and China\'s Huawei Technologies a 
contract to add 250,000 fixed lines to NITEL\'s Lagos 
network. (Comment: The ambitious expansion plan, 
relying mostly on fiber optic technology, is being 
characterized as \"ongoing\" but the results are not yet 
visible. NITEL\'s local fixed wireless pilot program 
that should have taken off at midyear is also moving 
more slowly than expected. End comment.) 
 
7. (U) According to Eyo, fixed lines remain NITEL\'s 
focus, as the company seeks to carve a niche for 
providing data transmission services to customers, 
particularly businesses. 
 
--------------------------- 
Introduces Prepaid Platform 
--------------------------- 
 
8. (U) Revenue collection remains a major problem for 
NITEL, mainly due to its inadequate data recording 
systems. This chronic gap encouraged the company to 
introduce the \"NITEL Prepaid Platform\" during the third 
quarter 2004. This scratch-card service allows 
subscribers to make calls on all NITEL and PTO phones, 
after dialing a secret code number.  Distinctly 
different from the prepaid service provided by other 
GSM operators and PTOs, which are adapted to specific 
networks, NITEL\'s prepaid platform has all the features 
of a calling card and can be used for both local and 
international calls. NITEL officials acknowledge that 
public awareness of this more comprehensive prepaid 
service is very low. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Highly Indebted To GSM Operators 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) Press reports estimate NITEL\'s debts on 
interconnection fees to major GSM companies (MTN, 
Vmobile and Globacom) at $82.7m (N11bn). NITEL 
subscribers soon may be unable to access these GSM 
networks as the operators are threatening to cut them 
off. (Comment: This huge debt may have a dampening 
effect on NITEL\'s privatization efforts. End comment.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
GON Too Hands-On in NITEL Management? 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10. (U) The GON decided to improve NITEL before 
privatizing it in order to increase the potential sale 
price of the company. Towards that end the GON awarded 
Dutch firm Pentascope BV, a three-year contract to 
operate NITEL. Recently, however, the Senate initiated 
a probe of the contract, alleging \"fundamental flaws\". 
Industry watchers say the probe is primarily motivated 
by a desire to target former BPE director, Nasir el- 
Rufai (Currently Minister of the Federal Capital 
Territory (FCT).  The no-nonsense, blunt-talking El 
Rufai has had a string of run-ins with lawmakers when 
he was at BPE and now as head of the FCT.) They 
acknowledge, however, that there may be some problems 
with the Pentascope contract. 
 
11.(U) Similarly, the top officials of NITEL\'s GSM 
subsidiary, M-TEL were recently sacked for \"non- 
performance\". On September 6 a GON-appointed board 
Chairperson suspended the managing director of M-TEL (a 
Pentascope appointee) and retired seven other top 
Nigerian officials of the company. Shortly after, the 
chairperson was also relieved of his duties. This 
action resulted in negative press reports and an 
attendant decline in market share. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (U) It is difficult to predict when NITEL will be 
privatized.  There is a certain ambivalence within the 
government about selling it.  This duality, coupled 
with the very real institutional shortcomings of the 
company have continually stalled NITEL\'s efforts to 
improve its services, become profitable and be more 
attractive to prospective investors. If reports are 
true of GON attempts to transfer SAT3 to another 
agency, thereby stripping NITEL of its major selling 
point this would confirm that the GON remained 
conflicted with itself on whether to get out of the 
business of being a telecom provider.  Getting the 
privatization process right is critical to the 
credibility of the privatization.  The GON process has 
failed to privatize any major utility company since 
1999.  Recent government action casts doubts on the GON 
ability or willingness to privatize the company soon. 
End comment. 
 
13. (U) This Cable has been cleared by Embassy Abuja.

1.  (C) Summary:  As a cavalcade of Nigerian dignitaries 
gathered in Anambra for the funeral of Chief Asika -- the 
former administrator following the Biafran war -- the crisis 
in the state continued to roil.  Anambra Governor Ngige made 
cameo appearances in the state during the past several days 
before returning to Abuja Sunday night to continue 
discussions with nemesis Chris Uba this week (refs a and b). 
Ngige told Polchief that although he should not have to 
negotiate with an \"illiterate thug\" he was prepared to 
compromise for the sake of peace; some issues, however, were 
deal-breakers. 
 
2.  (C) Summary Cont\'d:  Ngige implored the USG to convince 
President Obasanjo to stop backing Uba, or at the very least, 
to fully restore his security detail.  Although support for 
Ngige is not very strong because most Anambrans realize he 
came to office on the wings of a fraudulent election, they 
are even more repulsed by Uba\'s \"gangsterism.\"  A neighboring 
Southeast Deputy Governor told Polchief that only Obasanjo 
could end to the crisis.  The question is will he?   End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
Ngige: Yes to Compromise, but My Wife is Non-Negotiable 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
3.  (C)  Polchief traveled to Onitsha, Anambra to attend to 
funeral of Chief Asika, former administrator of the region 
following the Biafran war.  Luminaries from throughout the 
country were present including former head of state Gowon. 
Anambra State Governor Ngige was conspicuously absent for 
most of the ceremony, arriving from Abuja only after most 
dignitaries had departed.  Polchief later met with Ngige in 
his capital Awka  On the way, we stopped to see one of the 
state-owned buildings that had been burned the previous week 
by the armed bands purportedly suborned by Chris Uba (ref a). 
 
4.  (C)  Asked how the Abuja talks with Chris Uba were 
progressing, Ngige alternated between outrage and pragmatism. 
 Ngige said that he should not have to face Uba at all.  Uba 
is a private person and an illiterate thug to boot. 
President Obasanjo is on record saying he wants to end 
corrupt practices in Nigeria; he should start with Chris Uba, 
Ngige argued. 
 
5.  (C)  However, Ngige said he would \"sacrifice\" for the 
sake of peace.  Ngige admitted that Uba \"helped\" him win the 
elections but said the assistance rendered did not tally with 
Uba\'s outrageous compensation claims.  Specifically, Ngige 
said he was prepared to concede to Uba\'s faction the state 
PDP chairmanship and six commissioner slots.  He was also 
prepared to negotiate with Uba the party list for the 
scheduled December 18 local level elections -- though with 
the burning of the State Independent Electoral Commission, 
Ngige now thought this date no longer realistic.  Finally, 
Ngige intimated he would be willing to make a \"reasonable\" 
monthly payment to Uba. 
 
6.  (C)  Ngige said that there were some issues, most notably 
the position of deputy governor, which were non-negotiable. 
Ngige said, \"Uba is greedy.  I am prepared to compromise but 
if someone asks you to negotiate over your wife, then you get 
up from the table.\"  (Note:  The Uba/Ngige talks being held 
under the aegis of the Presidential Peace Committee 
established last week were scheduled to resume the evening of 
Sunday, November 21.  However, they were postponed by 
Committee Chair, Ebonyi Governor Egwu to the evening of 
Monday, November 22.  End Note.) 
 
7.  (C)  Ngige implored the USG to \"talk to\" Obasanjo.  Local 
allies could not help, he insisted.  Ideally, the president 
would jettison Uba, but Ngige acknowledged this was unlikely. 
Asked to speculate why the President had failed to restrain 
Uba given the national embarrassment Anambra has become, 
Ngige said Andy Uba, the President\'s special adviser and 
elder brother to Chris, wanted to be Anambra governor.  If 
Anambra became ungovernable and the president had to declare 
a state of emergency, this would open the door for Andy, 
Ngige proffered. 
 
8.  (C) Ngige asked that we pressure Obasanjo to fully 
restore his security detail and that of the State House 
Assembly members. (Note:  The Speaker of the House and 
numerous other high-ranking state officials remain in hiding. 
 reftels.  End Note.)  Ngige claimed to have only four 
policemen dedicated to him.  This level of support, Ngige 
said, was insufficient to safeguard against attack. 
Moreover, he argued, it sent the \"wrong signal\" to Uba\'s 
faction.  (Comment:  The national newspapers have been 
chocked full of allegations from Ngige\'s camp that Uba has a 
hit-list and Ngige is at the top of it.  These stories, which 
Ngige also relayed to polchief, contain a fair amount of 
hyperbole.  For example, Uba and by extension the president 
are accused of creating Sudan-style \"janjaweed\" in Anambra. 
While the language is clearly sensationalist, the alleged 
threats against Ngige cannot be dismissed given the history 
between the two men.  End Comment). 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Ordinary Anambrans Don\'t Exactly Rally 
to Ngige, But Support Him Over Uba 
-------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) As armed bands were marauding through Anambra burning 
state buildings, including the governor\'s residence, most 
Anambrans kept their heads low.  Ngige claimed this was 
because he issued instructions that people not retaliate so 
as not to give Obasanjo pretext for declaring a state of 
emergency.  However, our contacts said the lack of a public 
protest was the offspring of common sense.  Most people did 
not want to get caught in the mayhem.  In addition, there was 
a sense that this was not their fight.  Ohaneze Ndigbo, the 
largest pan-Igbo political/social group, has issued a 
statement condemning the arsons, but stopping short of fully 
endorsing Ngige.  A traditional chief told polchief that an 
Igbo council of elders plans to meet soon and it too will 
issue a statement, along the same lines.  The chief said that 
while some Anambrans continue to have issues with the 
fraudulent way in which Ngige came to power, this was not the 
way to remove him. 
 
10.  (C) Many contacts said they hoped the on-going All 
Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) court case would decide the 
governorship definitively in favor of APGA candidate Peter 
Obi.  In the meantime, however, Ngige was the recognized 
governor and he should not be removed by Uba\'s \"gangsterism.\" 
Some contacts noted that they had been impressed with Ngige\'s 
governance, saying it was as if Ngige were out to prove a 
point. 
 
(Comment:  APGA is widely believed to have won the 2003 
elections (ref c).  Ngige and other state officials appeared 
unconcerned by Obi\'s court case, however.  The State 
Secretary General told polchief that the case would drag on 
 
SIPDIS 
until at least 2007, since Ngige\'s lawyers intended to call 
over 400 witnesses. End Comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
Enugu Deputy Governor: Only Obasanjo Can End Crisis 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
11.  (C)  Enugu State Deputy Governor Chief Itanyi told 
polchief that most of the southeast governors supported Ngige 
but were vocally reticent for fear of angering Obasanjo. 
Personally, Itanyi felt that the southeast governors should 
stand firm against Uba, since his shenanigans in Anambra 
could potentially disrupt the entire subregion if commerce is 
disrupted and Anambrans are forced to seek refuge from the 
violence in neighboring states.  However, influential 
political leaders have been watching the Anambra crisis 
unfold from the sidelines, Itanyi said.  Despite seeing Ngige 
as the lesser of two evils in his battle with Uba, most feel 
this is one dispute from which they should steer clear. 
Itanyi dismissed Ebonyi Governor Egwu\'s prospects of 
brokering a lasting peace between Ngige and Uba.  A deal 
mediated by Egwu would be ephemeral, Egwu suggested.  Egwu 
said only President Obasanjo could end the crisis -- the 
question is does he want to? 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (C) The irony of having stolen the elections and then 
insisting that the USG help maintain that post in the name of 
\"democracy\" appears to be lost on Ngige.  That said, Uba\'s 
violent, strong-arm tactics may be even more unconscionable. 
Obasanjo could do himself, Anambra, and Nigeria a big favor 
if he were to ensure that the court case examining the 2003 
elections in Anambra is fair and transparent.  This could be 
the best vindication of democracy in troubled Anambra.  Short 
of this, most Anambrans hope that ultimately Obasanjo will 
intervene to rein in Uba and restore a semblance of order in 
Anambra.  However, from our vantage point in Lagos, it does 
not appear that Obasanjo will step into the morass unless his 
own fortunes become jeopardized or he is prodded to take 
action.

SUBJECT: ASARI WITHDRAWAL FROM PEACE PROCESS UNCLEAR; SHELL 
CONTRACTOR KILLED IN BAYELSA 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (SBU)   Press accounts state Niger Delta People\'s 
Volunteer Force (NDPVF) leader Asari has pulled out the peace 
talks with the Government of Nigeria.  However, Shell\'s 
External Relations Director told us that his sources in the 
area indicate Asari has not withdrawn from the peace accord. 
Shell reported that a contractor was killed in the Delta 
region on 17 November; Shell employees repelled an attempt to 
take over a rig on 20 November.  It is not yet known whether 
the perpetrators of these attacks are associated with Asari. 
U.S. firm Seabulk received a threat on 18 November 
purportedly from the NDPVF to attack its joint venture 
operation and to kidnap expatriate workers unless the firm 
pays a ransom. In direct discussions between Seabulk and 
Asari, Asari neither endorsed nor renounced this threat. 
While extortion has become a regular component of doing 
business in the Delta, Seabulk noted an increase in 
extortionate letters the firm has received during the last 
few weeks. 
 
Press: Asari Pulled Out of the Peace Process 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
2.  (U)  Press accounts from November 17 and 18 state that 
the Niger Delta People\'s Volunteer Force (NDPVF) leader Asari 
pulled out the peace talks with the Government of Nigeria. 
The Vanguard newspaper reported Asari stating that, \"I can 
only speak to what I have seen and observed and I can tell 
you that the process has not been transparent and this lack 
of transparency I always knew would not sustain the process. 
All I can say now is that that Obasanjo is not committed to a 
peaceful resolution of the conflict.\"  The Vanguard alleged 
that Asari was disgruntled that rival militia leader Ateke 
Tom had turned in less weapons than had the NDPVF. 
 
Shell Disputes Press Reports of Asari Pullout 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  (SBU)  The Shell External Relations Director stated that, 
contrary to press reports, his reliable sources indicate that 
Asari had not withdrawn from the peace accord.  The Chevron 
Texaco Environmental, Safety, and Health Manager noted no 
uptick in security threats against Chevron.  A survey of most 
other American firms working in the Delta region produced no 
other complaints of recent increased tensions or threats by 
community groups. 
 
Contractor Killed in Bayelsa; Shell Repels Rig Seizure 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.  (SBU)  Over the weekend, Shell experienced two separate 
attacks.  It is not yet known whether the perpetrators of 
these incidents are associated with Asari.   In the first 
incident, the Shell External Relations Director confirmed 
that a contractor (nationality unknown) was killed on 17 
November in the creek area of Nembe, Bayelsa state.  No 
further details were available.  In the second incident, a 
Shell security employee reported that on 20 November, about 
150 community youths attempted to seize Rig 75 in Bayelsa 
State.  Shell employees locked the rig down, and the youths 
were not successful.  The Nigerian Army appears to have shot 
one youth in the leg during the ensuing altercation.   No 
Shell or military employees were injured.  The Shell employee 
reported that the youths attacked due to a dispute concerning 
a Memorandum of Understanding between the community and 
Shell. 
 
Group Claiming to Represent Asari Threatens Seabulk 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Managing Director (MD) of U.S. firm Seabulk 
informed the U.S. Consulate that it had received a threat on 
18 November, allegedly from the NDPVF, to shut down its joint 
venture operation (which operates five crewboats in Nigeria), 
and to kidnap expatriate workers at the JV company base, 
unless the firm paid 3 million naira to the NDPVF and 
immediately employed 50 workers from the Niger Delta. 
Seabulk representatives met with Asari on 19 November, at 
which time Asari did not appear to know about the threat. 
However, he was unwilling to renounce the threat, and 
indicated that he would get back in touch with Seabulk later. 
 Seabulk?s MD also stated that several letters from 
community groups making various demands and appeals have now 
copied Asari on their letters. 
 
6. (SBU)  The Seabulk MD also noted an uptick in the number 
of threatening letters from various community groups 
demanding meetings this month.  He stated that U.S. firm 
Tryco had also been approached by a group claiming to 
represent Asari.  The Seabulk MD is of the opinion that the 
GON negotiations with the NDPFV have opened the door for 
extortion by other community groups.  The MD also indicated 
that these types of demands become more prevalent close to 
the Christmas holidays, as communities attempt to raise funds 
for end of the year festivities. 
 
7. (SBU)  Seabulk passed to the Consulate copies of letters 
to Seabulk from the Ijaw Youth Council, Okira Local 
Government Council, and the Brass Local Government Council. 
The letters include charges of \"utter neglect of local 
content policies, deliberate and calculative discriminatory 
policies and employment and empowerment measures against Ijaw 
youth,\" to demands for sports promotion, employment, 
contracts, and homage to the Executive Chairman.  (Note: 
Upwards of 90 percent of Seabulk employees are Nigerian, many 
from the Delta region.)

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS NIGERIAN STOCK EXCHANGE 
 
 
1. (U) Ambassador John Campbell visited the Nigerian 
Stock Exchange (NSE) in late October.  The program 
included remarks by NSE management, the Ambassador\'s 
ringing of the closing bell, brief question and answers 
with the press, lunch with NSE management and traders, 
and interaction with principal stock traders. 
 
2. (U) The NSE is one of Africa\'s leading securities 
exchanges with one of the best rates of return on 
investment in the world, according to NSE Director 
General Dr. Ndi Onyiuke.  The market has risen 
approximately 40 percent in annualized terms over the 
last four years.  The all-share index has grown from 
100 in 1984 to an all-time high of 26,000 in 2004.  It 
is at just over 22,000 at present. 
 
3. (U) Industry watchers predict further growth over 
the next few years, given the introduction of new 
derivative instruments, pension reform, and the 
reactivation of the corporate and government bond 
market in Nigeria.  The NSE has a relatively strong 
regulatory capacity within the Nigerian context and is 
a signatory to the World Federation of Exchanges 
international code on money laundering.  The exchange 
sponsors several international investment road shows to 
the United States and Europe each year in an effort to 
attract investment from the Nigerian diaspora and from 
international fund managers.  The NSE reports Americans 
hold USD 300 million worth of shares on the exchange. 
 
4. (U) Dr. Ndi Onyiuke stressed the importance of 
integrity and transparency in the NSE\'s activities. 
The NSE has rigorous standards to prevent and detect 
fraud, she asserted during her conversation with 
Ambassador Campbell.  The public\'s trust in the 
exchange has been central to its success. Ndi Onyiuke 
acknowledged that corruption and fraud are problems in 
Nigeria.  However, she maintained that only a small 
number of individuals committed these criminal 
activities, which unfortunately give the entire country 
a black eye.  Ndi Onyiuke hopes the NSE will serve as 
an exemplar of how businesses and government 
institutions can operate in Nigeria. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
5. (SBU) Ambassador and Consulate Staff visited the NSE 
the day after Transparency International (TI) released 
its Corruption Perceptions Index 2004, ranking Nigeria 
as the third most corrupt country in the world, a 
marginal improvement over 2003 when Nigeria was ranked 
number two.  The ranking appeared to weigh heavily on 
Ndi Onyiuke who went to great lengths in her discussion 
with the Ambassador to differentiate the NSE from 
corrupt individuals and institutions in Nigeria.  Most 
reports we hear about the exchange are favorable and 
indicate that Ndi Onyiuke and her predecessors have 
been largely successful insulating the exchange from 
large-scale fraud and unscrupulous business practices. 
Clearly, however, the NSE is handicapped by the global 
image of Nigeria as a country long on corruption and 
short on transparency.  The NSE stands as one of the 
few in Nigeria that plays by the rules of the market. 
In doing so and doing so successfully, it demonstrates 
to Nigeria that fair practice and profit are not 
antagonists.  This is a lesson Nigeria needs and we 
should encourage and support the NSE to the extent 
possible.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES 
 
REF: A. (A) LAGOS 540 
 
     B. (B) LAGOS 1210 
 
1. SUMMARY:  The government of Delta State plans to hold 
local council elections in Warri November 27 in three areas 
where elections were suspended March 2004.  The majority 
ethnic group in the area, the Ijaws, have threatened to 
boycott the elections because they believe the configuration 
of the local government areas dilutes their voting strength 
and will result in their under-representation in local 
government.  Due to the possibility of protests and violence 
surrounding the elections, Post issued a warden message 
advising Amcits in Warri to avoid unnecessary travel November 
27.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  Barring a last-minute court injunction, the government of 
Delta State will conduct local council elections November 27 
for three areas in Warri: Warri South, Warri North, and Warri 
Southwest.  The Delta State Independent Electoral Commission 
(DSIEC) will supervise the elections. The state government 
originally scheduled the elections for March 27, along with 
elections in the other areas of the state.  However, violence 
between the two major ethnic groups, the Ijaws and the 
Itsekiris, caused the government to postpone the elections to 
prevent a further escalation in violence (reftel A). 
 
3. Arguing that several issues have not yet been resolved, 
Ijaws have vowed to boycott the elections. Edwin Clark, a 
prominent Ijaw chief, told Poloff that two key issues are 
prompting the boycott: non-participation of the Ijaws in the 
last voter registration and the allegedly discriminatory 
demarcation of wards.  According to Clark, most voters remain 
unregistered in five of the ten wards in Warri, and most of 
these voters are Ijaw.  He commented that the government has 
put soldiers in Warri to maintain the fragile peace, and yet 
it threatens to disrupt the peace by holding these elections. 
Clark said the government is \"looking for trouble\"; the 
unwillingness of the courts and the government to address the 
problems is \"driving people to action.\"  Clark said he could 
not predict whether violence would erupt if the elections go 
ahead. (Comment: What Clark did not say was that Ijaw leaders 
are in part responsible for the number of unregistered 
voters. During the last voter registration exercise, Ijaw 
leaders persuaded their followers to boycott that process as 
well. End comment.) 
 
4. Itsekiris also are displeased with the current ward 
demarcation and have taken the issue to court. Newspaper 
reports over the past weeks, however, indicate Itsekiri 
residents plan to participate in the elections.  Isaac 
Jemide, an Itsekiri leader, advised the Ijaws to follow the 
Itsekiri example and contest the ward demarcation in court 
instead of boycotting the elections. 
 
5. A newspaper reported that an Ijaw group, the Federated 
Niger Delta Izon Congress, warned all foreign nationals 
working on oil installations to leave Warri by noon on 
November 27 or face possible harm.  According to the report, 
the group plans to take over oil installations in the creek 
areas.  A Chevron contact told Poloff that the threat was not 
a great cause for concern because few expatriate oil workers 
remain in Warri; most have already been moved from the area 
because of the ongoing violence over the past couple years. 
 
6. COMMENT:  Warri has not yet recovered from the upsurge in 
violence in March 2003 when more than 100 people were killed 
and property worth millions of naira was destroyed.  The 
\"ceasefire\" of June 1, 2004, has brought a period of relative 
calm to the area (reftel B).  The disputes and threats 
surrounding the planned November 27 elections reveal that 
tensions remain high and little progress has been made to 
address underlying issues of the Warri power struggle.  END

SUBJECT: HALLIBURTON BAN LIKELY TO BE REVERSED; FIRM 
CRITIQUES BARITE IMPORT BAN AND JV UNDERFUNDING 
 
REF: ABUJA 1663 
 
Classified By: Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reason 
s 1.4 (D & E) 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Halliburton has indicated the GON is likely to 
quietly lift the ban against the firm\'s activities in 
Nigeria.  The move was facilitated by the October 5 return to 
Nigeria of radioactive sources stolen in 2002 but later 
recovered by Halliburton. Halliburton also expressed concerns 
regarding funding constraints for joint venture petroleum 
operations with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC).  The Halliburton Business Development Manager noted 
the NNPC often curtails oil service company operations 
mid-year, due to the GON\'s failure to meet budget 
allocations for NNPC.  Halliburton also expressed alarm at 
the ban on the importation of barite, a mineral used in 
drilling mud.  Instead, oil service companies are being 
directed to a Nigerian firm awarded an exclusive import 
license, which charges three times the world price for 
barite. 
 
GON Likely to Lift Halliburton Ban 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Energy Off met Halliburton\'s Business Development 
(BD) Manager Jim Mills and Halliburton (outside) legal 
counsel Oghogo Akpata on 18 and 19 November.  Both indicated 
the ban against Halliburton entering into new oil service 
contracts is likely to be lifted soon.  They indicated 
President Obasanjo was likely to approve a carefully brokered 
agreement that would allow the company to enter new 
contracts.  Halliburton is currently waiting for the 
President and Attorney General to meet to conclude the 
agreement.  Halliburton legal counsel indicated the return of 
the radioactive sources to Nigeria on 5 October played a 
central role in the GON\'s apparent about face.  (Note: The 
sources had been stolen from a Halliburton site in Nigeria, 
and shipped as scrap in Germany. Halliburton\'s decision to 
ship the sources to the U.S. for examination in the firm\'s 
laboratories raised the ire of the GON; President Obasanjo 
voiced intense displeasure that the sources were not returned 
immediately from Germany to Nigeria.  End Note.) 
 
Quiet Reversal of Ban Likely 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  Given the GON\'s public pronouncements against 
Halliburton, the reversal in GON policy is likely to be 
downplayed.  In recent weeks, Halliburton has attempted to 
get its side of the story out, to prepare public opinion for 
an eventual reversal of the ban.  Halliburton states that the 
radioactive sources were imported with the knowledge and 
consent of GON for use in normal petroleum production 
activities, and that the firm immediately reported the 
disappearance to the GON. However, in a reversal from an 
earlier position, Halliburton legal counsel did admit that 
the radioactive sources were licensed, but incorrectly so, as 
the recent establishment of a Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory 
Authority seems to have created temporary confusion regarding 
which entity had the authority to license nuclear materials 
in Nigeria. 
 
Halliburton Suffers Severe Business Impact 
------------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The BD Manager stated Halliburton suffered a severe 
business impact from the ban, but overall oil production did 
not suffer as Halliburton\'s competitors swiftly picked up 
its business.  He was frustrated that the GON, perhaps to 
gain additional negotiating leverage, tried to link 
resolution of the ban on new contracts for Halliburton Energy 
Services Company with the TKSJ (an international consortium 
involving Halliburton division Kellogg, Brown, and Root, or 
KBR) bribery scandal on the construction of the NLNG plant. 
Mills noted that Halliburton Energy Services Company is a 
separate legal entity from KBR, the Halliburton entity 
charged in the bribery scandal.  He believes that all 
Halliburton divisions have been unfairly smeared in the 
scandal. 
 
Serious Concerns with JV funding 
-------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Echoing common industry concerns, the BD Manager 
expressed frustration with the joint venture (JV) funding 
situation in Nigeria.  JV funding constraints are the largest 
impediment to additional oil and gas exploration and 
production in Nigeria.  The BD Manager is concerned about the 
downward trend in JV funding by the GON, noting that there 
are fewer rigs running in Nigeria than two years ago due to 
JV funding constraints. (Note: The parastatal Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, is typically the 
dominant equity partner in joint ventures with international 
firms.  Oil production in Nigeria is currently under the 
joint venture model, although deepwater fields currently 
under construction are under a production sharing contract 
model.  As the dominant equity partner, NNPC is required to 
contribute the majority of the equity capital.  NNPC does not 
retain its own revenues from year to year, and hence funds 
all equity shares with allocations from the GON budget. 
Increased petroleum revenues from this year\'s high oil 
prices do hold out hope of at least temporarily ameliorating 
the JV funding issue during the next year.)  The BD Manager 
noted a yearly pattern, in which NNPC does not receive the 
full amount of funds allocated to it.  In September or 
October of a given year, the GON announces the budget data, 
including an allocation for NNPC.  By about April of the 
following year, the GON does not have sufficient funds, and 
NNPC is forced to curtail the budget.  In turn, U.S. 
contractors are ordered to curtail their operations.  Rig 
operations are halted, and expensive equipment often has to 
be re-located to projects outside of the country, causing 
significant losses for affected firms, including American oil 
service companies (OSCs).  The BD Manager noted that, unlike 
some other parastatals, NNPC is not willing to be \"carried\" 
through alternate financing arrangements when it does not 
have cash on hand to complete planned projects; rather, the 
NNPC simply stops operations. 
 
Sole Legal Barite Importer Charges 3 Times World Price 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
6.  (SBU)  The BD Manager also expressed his concerns with 
the Nigerian import bans in general, and the ban on barite 
importation in particular.  Barite is used as a weighting 
agent in drilling mud for oil and gas exploration.  It has 
been banned by the GON, allegedly in the interest of 
fostering a local barite industry.  However, Nigeria does not 
have the infrastructure to mine it in industrial quantities, 
and the small-scale hand mining that does exist is inadequate 
to meet the needs of petroleum operators in Nigeria.  The BD 
Manager noted that Nigeria does not have large quantities of 
barite, and would run out of the mineral in a little more 
than three years, if it were produced in-country in 
industrial quantities.  (Note: It appears to be an open 
question whether the relatively small quantity of barite 
found in Nigeria would economically justify capital intensive 
mining investment for barite exploitation.)  The BD Manager 
stated that barite can be purchased on the world market for 
approximately $120/ton, but the Ministry of Solid Minerals is 
now pressuring firms to purchase it from a Nigerian company 
awarded an exclusive import license for $350/ton.  The import 
ban has not resulted in any industrial quantity barite 
production. 
7.  (C)  According to the BD Manager, Halliburton and other 
OSCs are in danger of failing to meet their contractual 
obligations with multinational energy firms to carry out 
drilling operations, due to the lack of barite in the market. 
 
Comment 
-------- 
8.  (C)  Concerns about barite importation are not limited to 
Halliburton, and have been voiced by a variety of companies 
at industry conferences.  Inflated pricing for barite and 
other inputs for the petroleum sector also exacerbates the 
problems caused by GON inadequate JV funding, as operators 
and their contractors are forced to divert scarce project 
funds to pay higher than market values for essential inputs. 
The ban on barite may violate WTO policies, and may be 
causing significant financial losses for American firms. The 
ban on barite, like the other import bans, raises serious 
concerns about the GON\'s commitment to liberalizing its 
trade regime, and creating an enabling environment to support 
credible local industry as well as attract needed foreign 
investment.  The award of sole rights to import barite to one

SUBJECT: TIP: COURT DELIVERS FIRST CONVICTION UNDER 
ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAW 
 
1. Summary.  The High Court in Benin City delivered the 
first conviction under the 2003 Human Trafficking 
Prohibition Law last week.  Sarah Okoya was found 
guilty of attempting to procure persons for 
prostitution, attempting to organize foreign travel for 
prostitution, and deceitfully inducing persons to 
travel out of Nigeria.  The judge sentenced Okoya to 
three years\' imprisonment, eleven years less than the 
maximum penalty.  The conviction was an important 
symbolic step in Nigeria\'s efforts to combat 
trafficking.  It both reflects and reinforces the 
gradual change in attitude toward trafficking as a 
serious crime, and hopefully will pave the way for 
future convictions.  End summary. 
 
2. On November 18, the high court in Benin City 
delivered the first conviction under Nigeria\'s Human 
Trafficking Prohibition and Law Enforcement Act of 
2003.  According to a press release from the National 
Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons 
(NAPTIP), Sarah Okoya was found guilty on six counts 
each of attempting to procure persons for prostitution, 
attempting to organize foreign travel for persons for 
prostitution, and deceitfully inducing persons to 
travel out of Nigeria. The Edo State chief judge 
sentenced Okoya to thirty-six months\' imprisonment. 
 
3. According to the verdict, Okoya convinced six girls 
to travel with her under the pretext that she had jobs 
for them in Spain.  Her defense was that the girls\' 
parents agreed to let them go with her.  The party 
travelled only as far as Cotonou, Benin, before Okoya 
was arrested and she and the girls were returned to 
Nigeria by the Nigerian Embassy.  NAPTIP brought 
charges against her September 29, 2004. 
 
4. The court could have sentenced Okoya to a fourteen 
year prison term.  The judge, however, declined to 
sentence Okoya to the maximum ten-year term for 
deceitful inducement, saying she did not agree with the 
penalty provisions in that section of the law. 
According to newspaper reports, the judge also said 
that if Okoya had succeeded in trafficking the girls 
into prostitution, she would have faced the full brunt 
of the law because that offence \"undermines the 
integrity of the society and brings an international 
disgrace to Nigerians.\"  The judge  noted that 
trafficking is now a topical international issue and 
took the opportunity to warn parents about the new 
trafficking prohibition law. 
 
5. Shadrach Haruna, head of the NAPTIP Legal and 
Prosecution Department, told Poloff the court case 
received significant coverage in the Benin City media. 
Coverage in papers with national circulation, however, 
has been limited.  Haruna said NAPTIP currently is 
prosecuting five other trafficking cases.  He and other 
officials hope the Okoya conviction will demonstrate 
Nigeria\'s  commitment to combatting traffficking and 
help pave the way for additional convictions. 
 
6. Comment.  Achieving this first conviction was an 
important milestone for NAPTIP in demonstrating the 
brunt of the anti-trafficking law.  That the chief 
judge presided over the case also is a sign of the 
court\'s seriousness.  The judge\'s comment that the 
penalty for deceitful inducement to travel was too 
severe was somewhat unfortunate, but overall, the 
verdict was a good one.  Additionally, the judge\'s 
admonishment to parents hopefully will make another 
dent in the common perception that it may be in the 
family\'s best interest to send children away.  It also 
suggests parents might be held liable.  The emerging 
realization that trafficking reflects poorly on Nigeria 
internationally may help combat the crime, especially 
given the current heightened attention government and 
society are focusing on improving Nigeria\'s image 
abroad.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIAN TEXTILE MANUFACTURER UNDULY 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AGOA 
 
 
1. (U) Summary.  The US Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement (TIFA) delegation and Mission econoffs 
visited a textile manufacturer in Zaria 13 November. 
A.K. Mansoori, Managing Director of Anamruh Limited, 
assured the visitors that Nigerian textile 
manufacturers will soon take advantage of AGOA 
opportunities.  It is more likely, however, the 
manufacturers may find the hurdles to market entry too 
daunting to overcome.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) The US delegation to the November 11 Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks in Abuja, 
and Econoffs from Abuja and Lagos traveled to Zaria, 
Kaduna State, November 12 to meet with a Nigerian 
textile manufacturer, A.K. Mansoori, Managing Director 
of Anamruh Limited, and hear his views on taking 
advantage of AGOA opportunities. 
 
3. (U) Mansoori said the stumbling block to successful 
Nigerian textile exportation is lack of affordable 
financing.  He said this prevents manufacturers from 
investing in newer technologies to produce high-quality 
textiles at competitive world prices.  When asked about 
other competitive disadvantages like lack of skilled 
workers, trained management, and the poor 
infrastructure in Nigeria, Mansoori gave no 
satisfactory reply.  Instead, he dwelled on the 
sector\'s arguable potential to take advantage of AGOA 
export opportunities if it had access to capital. 
 
4. (SBU) Comment: Even with the AGOA textile visa, it 
is unlikely that Nigeria\'s textile sector will be 
competitive on the world market.  In addition to 
interest rates at 20-30 percent, non-competitive labor 
force and the excessive costs of power and transport 
continue to hinder manufacturers. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment continued: Over the past decade, 75 
percent of Nigerian textile factories have shut down 
nationwide.  The remaining manufacturers are holding 
out, hoping for better days ahead.  AGOA and the 
textile visa have offered hope -- albeit a thin one. 
The GON is sustaining this optimism by singling out the 
textile sector as its key focus under AGOA.  For any 
positive movement, however, the GON would have to 
invest more heavily in infrastructure and banks would 
have to lower interest rates.  For both to happen at 
the same time would require not only the political will 
and economic commitment of the GON, it would take a 
degree of government and private sector coordination 
that has heretofore been lacking.  Despite Mansoori\'s 
optimism, we do not see this as being in the cards. 
Nigeria\'s textile industry will likely continue to 
flounder despite AGOA access.  Perhaps Mansoori summed 
up the quandary best when he stated: \"The reason for 
the failure of Nigeria is the Nigerian factor.\"  End 
comment.

1. Late November 26, the Delta State government again 
postponed the Warri local council elections.  Delta State 
Independent Electoral Commission (DSIEC) representatives 
reportedly announced the elections were being postponed for 
\"logistical reasons.\" The elections are rescheduled for 
December 2. 
 
2. Edwin Clark, a prominent Ijaw chief, told Poloff he and 
many others in Warri believe the elections were postponed for 
fear of violence, not logistical gaps.  Clark said the Ijaw 
concerns about the elections (reftel) remain unaddressed and 
the court still has not ruled on whether the elections can go 
ahead.  He said if the elections are held December 2, Ijaws 
will not only boycott them but \"take action\" to stop them. 
 
3. Comment: Though Clark does not control Ijaw militants, he 
has been publicly vocal intimating violence, and his 
statements likely reflect sentiments of militants. Tensions 
remain high and the possibility for violence remains 
considerable if elections are held December 2.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NIGERIA ECONOMIC UPDATE, NOVEMBER 2004 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The National Electric Power Authority 
(NEPA) generated significantly less power in November 
than normal due to poor planning, maintenance and 
repair issues.  The World Bank recently estimated 
Nigeria loses $496 million per year from power 
failures. The Nigeria-Sao Tome and Principe joint 
development authority is offering five deep offshore 
oil blocs for sale, ahead of Nigeria\'s sale of about 27 
onshore and offshore blocs in early 2005. The GON\'s 
local content campaign got a boost as Schlumberger 
began working with indigenous firms to raise funds for 
local marginal field operations. Nigerian 
Telecommunications Limited (NITEL), the state-owned 
telecommunications company, owes GSM operators millions 
of dollars; operators have begun terminating services 
for some subscribers. End summary. 
 
2. (U) This economic update includes: 
-- A Power Sector Update 
-- Offshore Oil Blocs Up for Licensing 
-- Schlumberger Helps Indigenous Operators 
-- State-owned NITEL Highly Indebted to GSM Companies 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
- 
Power Sector - Massive Loss of Generation; Electricity 
Tariffs May Rise; US Firm to Build State Plant 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
- 
 
3. (U) NEPA\'s power generation declined from 4,000MW to 
2,566MW.  This resulted in massive load shedding across 
the country. Much of Lagos has been without electricity 
the majority of the past several weeks.   Businesses 
and residents, who have the wherewithal, have been 
forced to rely on auxiliary power sources throughout 
most of November.  Those less fortunate have had to 
suffer through long periods without power and light. 
The World Bank recently estimated that Nigeria loses 
$469 million a year from power failures. 
 
4. (U) NEPA reported that three hydropower stations 
(Kainji, Shiroro and Jebba) are operating at about 55 
percent capacity, due to low water levels.   (Comment: 
With rainy season just now ending, if water levels are 
already a problem, this difficulty is only likely to 
escalate as Nigeria moves further into dry season. 
NEPA said it \"used up\" all the water, anticipating a 
\"big flood,\" which never materialized.  End Comment.) 
The Egbin thermal plant in Lagos is also operating 
below its 1,320MW, due to repair and maintenance work. 
(Comment: Technicians from Japan arrived about a week 
ago to work on the Lagos plant. End comment.) NEPA said 
it hopes to increase generation to at least 3,000MW 
early December.  However, that would still be less than 
50% of total installed capacity of 6,654MW and well 
short of the GON\'s target to increase installed 
capacity to 10,000MW by 2007.  Press reported that NEPA 
plans to increase electricity tariffs from between 40% 
and 194% to achieve full cost recovery.  The 
subsidization of NEPA and NEPA\'s resultant lack of 
popularity have been major impediments to NEPA\'s 
privatization and to attracting increased private 
investment to the struggling sector. 
 
6. (U) Meanwhile, U.S. firm Black and Veatch announced 
plans to partner with an indigenous company and the 
Kwara State Government to build a gas-fired Independent 
Power Plant (IPP) worth $275 million.  About $170m of 
the total sum is projected for constructing a gas 
pipeline to fuel the plant. In what may be a harbinger 
of things to come, the arrangement will exclude NEPA 
from the sale of electricity, and allow direct sale 
from the IPP to industry.  The plant, which should be 
completed in 2006, has an estimated output of 105 
megawatts. (Comment: GON plans to increase power 
generation from current 3,000MW to 10,000MW by 2005 
appear unachievable, despite the number of ongoing IPP 
projects of various state governments, which are at 
different levels of completion. End comment.) 
 
--------------------------- 
Oil: Blocs Up for Licensing 
--------------------------- 
6. (U) The Nigeria-Sao Tome and Principe Joint 
Development Zone (JDZ), November 15, opened a call for 
bids for the award of five deep offshore oil blocs in 
the zone. Bidding in this second JDZ licensing round is 
expected to close December 15, with winners announced 
December 31. 
7. (U) Edmund Daukoru, presidential adviser on 
petroleum and energy, said Nigeria would award 27 
onshore and offshore oil blocs the first quarter of 
2005.  The GON is aiming for $29 billion in petroleum 
revenue by 2007 and 40 billion barrels of oil reserves 
while producing 4.5 million barrels per day by 2010. 
Daukoru said the allocation and exploration of the 
blocs in 2005 would be critical in meeting these 
targets. (Comment: Stakeholders at a recent forum in 
Lagos opposed the GON\'s \"rush\" to license new blocs in 
2005. They claimed the country has yet to fully benefit 
from previously licensed blocs, most of which are not 
yet operational. End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
--- 
Schlumberger Helps Indigenous Operators of Marginal 
Fields 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
--- 
9. (U) Schlumberger announced plans to work with a 
consortium of four indigenous oil companies to develop 
four marginal fields, believed to have high prospects. 
(Note: In 2003, 31 indigenous companies were awarded 
licenses to operate 24 marginal fields - those oil 
fields which are no longer profitable for production 
for major oil firms, but which can present attractive 
opportunities for smaller companies. However, a large 
number of these companies had been unable to work these 
fields due to insufficient start-up capital. End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
State-owned NITEL Incur Enormous Debts to GSM Companies 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
11. (U) State-owned, Nigerian Telecommunications 
Limited (NITEL), and some private telecom operators 
(PTOs) owe major GSM operators (MTN, Vmobile and 
Glomobile) an estimated $97.7 million.   NITEL alone 
owes about $82.7 million. As a result of these mounting 
debts, MTN has cut off subscribers on some PTO 
networks. (Comment: Industry watchers speculate the 
high level of indebtedness may cause some PTOs to 
liquidate or lead to consolidation within the telecom 
industry. This would further simplify the introduction 
of Unified Telecom Licenses in 2006, when some PTOs 
will have approval to provide mobile services. End 
comment.)

REF: LAGOS 2353 AND PREVIOUS 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  The Anambra State crisis continues to 
replay itself like a B-rated soap opera.  Nigerian press 
reported that on November 29 gunmen attempted to assassinate 
embattled Anambra Governor Chris Ngige, presumably at the 
behest of his nemesis -- the presidentially connected, Chris 
Uba  (reftels).  The Anambra police and even a member of 
Ngige\'s staff contradict the press\' reports.  Meanwhile, on 
November 30, the Enugu Court of Appeal ruled that a lower 
court lacked jurisdiction to remove Ngige from office.  While 
this court decision may result in the full return of Ngige\'s 
security detail, it will not resolve the Anambra crisis. 
Ngige and Uba continue to talk, but thus far have failed to 
reach agreement.  President Obasanjo has yet to step in 
decisively to bring this embarrassing drama to a close.  End 
Summary. 
 
Assassination Attempt Against the Governor?  Probably Not. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
2.  (U)  On Tuesday, November 30, virtually all Nigerian 
dailies led with reports of a thwarted assassination attempt 
against Anambra State Governor Chris Ngige.  Respected 
newspapers headlined, \"Ngige escapes assassination in Awka,\" 
and reported a sudden fusillade as pre-positioned assassins 
took aim on the Governor\'s convoy.  Ngige and members of the 
Senate Committee on State and Local governments were touring 
the government buildings that had been burned November 10-11 
when the shootings occurred, allegedly forcing them to 
scamper for cover. 
 
3.  (C)  However, Anambra State Police Commissioner Felix 
Ogbaudu and members of Ngige\'s own staff contradicted these 
press reports in conversations with PolChief.  Ogbaudu, 
present at the time of the shootings, said mobile police 
(MoPol) assigned to Ngige fired into the air as the convoy 
approached its visit site.  Apparently Mopol believed \"area 
boys\" associated with Uba were in the vicinity.  Ogbaudu 
insisted, however, that no area boys were present. (Note: 
MoPol comes under a separate command structure than the State 
police.  End Note.) 
 
4.  (C) Ogbaudu blasted the press for \"repeatedly telling 
lies.\"  He vented, \"Where are the cars allegedly riddled with 
bullet holes as a result of this assassination attempt? 
Where are the bodies of the 27 people the newspapers said 
were killed during the November 10-11 arsons?  No one was 
killed earlier this month and there was no assassination 
attempt on Monday.\"  Ogbaudu said Nigerian journalists 
publish what they are paid to write, without regard to truth 
or to the public impact.  Ogbaudu asserted that for Ngige and 
Uba, the press was but a tool in their base attempts to 
achieve their respective political ambitions and to demonize 
the other. 
 
5.  (C)  Chucks Akunna, Chief Press Secretary to the 
Governor, told Polchief the Ngige team had heard earlier in 
the day that Uba\'s faction was planning to demonstrate near 
the sites they were to visit.  Akunna, who was inside the 
burned Anambra Broadcasting Station as the convoy approached, 
said the governor\'s MoPol fired into the air to disperse the 
crowd.  Akunna said Mopol fired because they claimed armed 
men were among the demonstrators.  Akunna confirmed there was 
no return fire from the crowd.  Akunna believed that one 
person had been injured, but did not have any further details. 
 
(Comment:  Ogbaudu is not exactly a neutral observer, he is 
presumably allied with Uba.  Ogbaudu has been accused of 
standing idly by while armed bands burned government 
buildings earlier in the month.  Some even accused the police 
of abetting the marauders and Ngige has called for Ogbaudu\'s 
replacement.  However, the separate account given by Akunna, 
a Ngige man, tracks, more or less, with Ogbaudu\'s report. 
There does not appear to have been an assassination attempt. 
End Comment.) 
 
... Meanwhile Court Rules in Favor of Governor Ngige 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  (U)  Meanwhile, on November 30, the Nigerian Court of 
Appeal, sitting in Enugu State, vacated the January 2 order 
of a lower Enugu court, which directed that Ngige be removed 
from office.  It was this lower court order that spurned the 
Nigerian Inspector of Police to remove Ngige\'s security 
detail.  A court in Awka, capital of Anambra, had earlier set 
aside the lower court\'s ruling, ushering in the show-down at 
the Appeal Court. 
 
7.  (C)  Ngige\'s press secretary and Ngige\'s senior adviser 
(who also happens to be Ngige\'s elder sister) told Polchief 
separately that the governor was pleased and relieved by the 
court decision.  They hoped this decision would result in the 
full restoration of Ngige\'s security detail.  Both expected, 
however, that Uba\'s faction would appeal to the Supreme Court 
in Abuja. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8.  (C)  Governor Ngige, State Assembly Speaker Balonwu, 
State Secretary Chukwura, and various other state officials 
have cloaked themselves in the mantle of \"besieged victim,\" 
blithely failing to note that the governor stole the election 
in the first instance.  They claim, for example, that they 
sleep in different houses every night; that they\'ve sent 
their wives and children into hiding; that Uba is monitoring 
their phone calls, etc., etc.  Speaker Balonwu\'s 
conversations with Mission staff have been particularly 
dramatic with him accusing President Obasanjo, and by \"its 
non-action,\" the USG, of supporting \"state terrorism.\"  Uba\'s 
camp probably does wish a plague on the governor\'s house -- 
at least as long as Ngige is its occupier; and the ill will 
is probably reciprocrated.  There may even be some in the Uba 
faction prepared to harm the governor.  However, in our view, 
Ngige and entourage now may be overplaying the \"victim role.\" 
 Anambra would be better served if they spent more energy 
seriously trying to resolve the crisis in the state, and less 
time in the press conference room.

SUBJECT: DOES INSPIRATION MATTER? THE SAFE SKIES FOR AFRICA 
CONFERENCE NIGERIAN DELEGATION 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reasons 1.4 (b & d) 
 
 1. (U) Summary.  The GON sent a three-member delegation to 
the Safe Skies for Africa Conference in Johannesburg, South 
Africa October 25-29; Lagos US Consulate Econoff also 
attended the event.  The Nigerian delegation said, upon 
returning home, it would push for passage of a pending 
aviation bill and will seek to secure additional security 
equipment.  The delegation believes both initiatives are 
critical toward meeting international aviation safety and 
security standards.  Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials 
cautioned the GON to seek alternative sources for obtaining 
aviation equipment.  U.S. assistance, they said, is shifting 
away from equipment transfers and moving toward training and 
capacity building.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) The Nigerian delegation (NIDEL) members to the Safe 
Skies for Africa (SSFA) Conference in Johannesburg October 
25-29 were Mr. Desmond Ugwuegbulem, Federal Airports 
Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Director of Airport Operations, 
Mrs. A.A. Faworaja, FAAN General Manager for Security, and 
Mr. Obi Anadu, FAAN General Manager for Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport. 
 
WHO WILL FUND SECURITY EQUIPMENT? 
--------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) Throughout the conference, the NIDEL repeatedly raised 
the need for more security equipment to Econoff and US 
aviation officials.  TSA and DOT officials replied that 
future USG contributions for aviation security in Nigeria 
mostly will be in training and consultation rather than 
security equipment itself.  The US has already provided USD 
3.2 million in aviation security equipment to Nigeria through 
the DOT Nigerian Transportation Project. 
 
4. (SBU) GON aviation officials need to realize that they 
have to take greater responsibility for purchasing their own 
equipment and that they should not place undue reliance on 
the US to transfer equipment to them.  At the November 11 
US-Nigeria bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement 
(TIFA) talks in Abuja, an uninvited MOA official waited 
outside the conference room for several hours to deliver a 
request that we supply Nigeria with additional aviation 
security equipment. 
 
5. (SBU) According to DOT, however, Nigeria has received more 
equipment than any other African nation.  DOT has provided 
Nigeria new passenger screening equipment, explosive trace 
detectors, and hand held and metal detectors for all four 
major international airports (Lagos, Abuja, Kano, and Port 
Harcourt).  In addition, DOT has trained 300 personnel on the 
use of the equipment, and has provided maintenance contracts 
for all the equipment.  DOT thinks its role in helping to 
equip Nigerian airports with state of the art passenger and 
cargo screening equipment has been fulfilled. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment. Following years of equipment transfers, 
Nigerian aviation officials have in place new state of the 
art security equipment at all major international airports. 
The major concerns now are the maintenance of the equipment 
and of the training levels of the personnel using the 
equipment.  Additionally, equipping airports with similar 
equipment is an important concern.  DOT had recommended to 
Nigerian MOA officials that the older equipment removed from 
the international airports be placed at appropriate domestic 
airports.  The time has come for Nigerian aviation officials 
to identify alternate funding sources for additional security 
equipment.  Nigeria might raise funds for equipment through 
airport taxes or a budget allotment on an annual basis.  DOT 
believes that Nigeria has in place the foundation for 
becoming a world-class aviation hub on the security side. 
Flight safety concerns remain to be addressed.  End comment. 
 
PUSH FOR CIVIL AVIATION BILL 
---------------------------- 
 
7. (U) NIDEL members told Econoff that passage of civil 
aviation legislation stalled in the National Assembly is 
necessary for further progress towards meeting international 
aviation standards.  (Amembassy Abuja will send a copy of the 
draft bill to US FAA legal experts to determine if it meets 
ICAO standards.  If so, this will be an important step in 
creating an aviation regulatory environment that will comply 
with the requirements for reaching FAA Category One status.) 
 
8. (SBU) NIDEL member, Ugwuegbulem, told Econoff he will do 
his part to encourage passage of adequate legislation.  He 
plans to inform the new MD of FAAN, Alhaji Gambo Umar, of its 
importance in the hope that Umar will, in turn, stress its 
importance to MOA.  MOA will then work with National Assembly 
members to pass the bill. 
 
9. (C) Comment.  A strong aviation sector in Nigeria would 
benefit both US and Nigerian interests.  Direct routes 
between the US and Nigeria would result in improved market 
access and increased trade.  We were pleased with the 
enthusiasm the NIDEL displayed at the SSFA Conference. 
However, the trio probably does not have the bureaucratic 
clout and influence to change budget allocations or effect 
legislation.  Notwithstanding NIDEL apparent buy-in, we 
suspect SSFA Conference messages and ideas will not resonate 
loudly at the MOA where the true impetus for change must 
come.  As a result, it may be some time before Nigeria 
attains the aviation stature it covets and the concomitant 
economic openness that stature would help produce.  End 
comment.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  Chevron Texaco (CT) Nigeria confirmed that local 
community members occupied the Robert-kiri flow station near 
Port Harcourt, Rivers State on 5 December.  Thirty CT 
employees, including one Amcit, are being held at the 
facility.  A CT delegation, accompanied by State Assembly 
members, is en route to Robert-kiri to negotiate with the 
villagers.  CT has ceased production of between 10,000 - 
20,000 barrels/day at the facility. Shell also confirmed that 
local villagers occupied the Ekulama I and II flow stations, 
near Kula in Rivers state, on 5 December.  The villagers have 
now departed the Shell facilities, and there were no 
injuries.  The Italian Embassy told Embassy Abuja there was 
an unsuccessful attempt to take over an AGIP facility on 
December 3. 
 
Chevron Texaco Station Remains Occupied; One Amcit Held 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.  (C)  Chevron Texaco (CT) External Affairs Director Femi 
Odumabo confirmed local community members have been occupying 
the Robert-kiri facility near Port Harcourt since 5 December. 
 At this writing, Odumabo and a delegation from the Rivers 
State Assembly are en route to negotiate with the 
townspeople.  CT Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) 
Manager reported approximately thirty CT employees, including 
one Amcit, are being held by the community members.  CT has 
moved to security code 4 at a number of its facilities in the 
area.  (Chevron operates under a 5-tier security system; at 
level 5, the company completely withdraws from an area.)  The 
number of community members occupying the facility has 
fluctuated from the approximately 300 villagers who initially 
took over on Sunday morning to as few as 25; currently over 
one hundred villagers appear to be participating.  The locals 
have been reticent to voice many specific demands.  A Chevron 
official told us the only demand has been to speak with 
President Obasanjo.  Chevron Texaco has shut down production 
at the flow station, because the production activities could 
endanger the villagers, including children, currently 
occupying the facility.  The flow station\'s capacity is 
modest, between 10,000 - 20,000 barrels/day. 
 
Occupation of 2 Shell Stations Resolved Peacefully 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3.  (C)  In a nearby incident, Shell Security Coordinator 
Mike Achu confirmed local villagers occupied the Ekulama I 
and II flow stations, near Kula in Rivers state, for a day 
beginning on 5 December.  (Note: As per reftel, on 24 
September, Shell evacuated approximately 200 personnel from 
the Ekulama and Soku facilities when militants killed two 
Shell Nigerian boat crew members and disarmed six mobile 
police in Soku.)  Achu said the villagers left the stations, 
and there were no injuries.  A planned intervention by the 
state security forces was aborted when the occupation was 
peacefully resolved.  Approximately 80,000 barrels of 
production were lost as a result of the occupation.  Achu 
said production would be restored shortly.  Achu reported no 
information involving Americans or other expatriates, noting 
that these flow stations were typically staffed by Nigerians.

SUBJECT: CONVERSATION WITH EXXON MOBIL MANAGING DIRECTOR 
 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reasons 1.4 (D & E) 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  Exxon Mobil Managing Director for Nigeria John 
Chaplain said the challenges facing Nigeria\'s energy sector 
are: 1) under-investment in JV funding; 2) civil unrest; 3) 
specific pending legislation governing local content and gas 
fiscal terms; and 4) a corrupt and overly bureaucratic 
Nigerian business culture.  End summary. 
 
Chronic Under-investment for 30 Years; Next Year Better? 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
2.  (C)  Pol/Econ Chief and Energy Off met Managing Director 
(MD) of ExxonMobil Nigeria, John Chaplain, and External 
Relations Director Udom Inoyo.  Chaplain said one of the 
largest problems confronting energy firms in Nigeria is the 
significant under-investment by the GON\'s parastatal Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in petroleum 
operations.  Chaplain estimates the sector has suffered from 
30 percent under-investment for 30 years.  The MD noted that 
the energy sector historically received 70 percent of the 
budget recommended by the National Petroleum Investment 
Management Services (NAPIMS), NNPC\'s investment unit.  This 
underfunding leads to significant delays in projects, he 
said.  However, the MD noted that the $4.3 billion the GON 
has allocated for the sector for the coming year, if 
actualized, would represent an upward shift in investment. 
 
3.  (U)  Not everyone agrees JV funding should be a top 
priority.  There are compelling arguments for many sectors 
that historically have also been underfunded.  Senator Udoma 
noted at a recent industry conference that the $4.3 
billion/580 billion naira budget proposed for JV funding was 
more than the GON\'s combined budgetary allocation of 540 
billion naira for education, health, power, and 
infrastructure.  He urged that approximately 10 to 11 billion 
naira be re-allocated for these needs.  He argued the JV 
funding only represents about 60 percent of the GON funding 
for the energy sector, and that the GON will actually spend 
950 to 980 billion naira next year in the sector.  While 
acknowledging that oil and gas are capital-intensive 
industries, he called for additional jobs in the sector for 
Nigerians. 
 
4.  (C)  External Affairs Director Inoyo said the Nigerian 
fiscal regime is highly favorable to the government, with 
petroleum profit tax and royalty rates of 85 percent.  He 
stated that overall, about 95 percent of the energy returns 
flowed to the GON.  Yet, the Delta region remains 
underdeveloped lacking in almost all basic infrastructure. 
Both Chaplain and Inoyo said the Niger Delta Development 
Commission (NDDC) was improving, but it had a long way to go 
before it would be effective.  Inoyo noted that majors give 
the NDDC three percent of oil revenues; in Exxon Mobil\'s 
case, the contribution amounted to $100 million in 2003.  It 
is unclear where that money and the other petroleum related 
tax revenues eventually end up. 
 
Unrest in the Delta Second Major Challenge 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  The MD pointed to unrest and instability in the 
Delta region as the second major challenge.  He noted, 
however, that ExxonMobil is more insulated from these 
pressures than the other majors because its operations are 
off-shore; the closest operation to land is 11 miles from 
shore. 
 
New Legislation is Third Major Challenge 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Chaplain voiced concern with pending legislation, 
including local content and downstream gas bills, and a 
proposed model production sharing contract for the gas 
sector.  Chaplain said that in the quest to increase national 
content, NNPC is asking that large contracts be broken into 
smaller bits to be handled by Nigerian firms.  This 
reductionist strategy would discourage construction of 
integrated capabilities among local firms, and lead to the 
mushrooming of many small firms with only limited 
capabilities.  He also noted that operating with many small 
contracts increases costs, and makes it complicated for the 
majors to manage the larger pool of contracts. 
 
7.  (C)  Chaplain raised significant concerns regarding 
pending legislation on downstream gas and a new model 
production sharing contract (PSC) for the gas sector.  He 
stated that the proposed gas PSC would ?totally kill the gas 
sector.?  He indicated that proposed policies on joint 
venture projects and associated gas projects were also 
troublesome.  The proposed fiscal terms were 
simply taking too much out, leaving nothing for the 
investor, Chaplain argued.  (Comment: The MD and External 
Relation Director\'s comments regarding pending legislation 
are reflective of general industry opinion.  There is concern 
regarding all pending legislation mentioned, but there is 
particular concern that the proposed gas fiscal terms will 
stifle the development of this industry.  The major energy 
firms, including Exxon Mobil, are discussing with the GON how 
to resolve their differences over the pending legislation and 
model contracts.  End comment.) 
 
The \"Nigeria Factor,\" Fourth Major Challenge 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  The MD pointed to the Nigerian business climate, or 
what he termed the \"Nigeria factor\" as the fourth major 
challenge facing operators in country.  Operations take about 
twice as long to mount in Nigeria as in other countries where 
EM operates, significantly increasing production costs.  Due 
to excessive bureaucracy and corruption, decisions and 
approval processes in Nigeria may take 18 months instead of 6 
to 9 months elsewhere.  GON actions, such as import bans, 
create doubt regarding its commitment to a positive 
investment climate.  These factors, coupled with security 
concerns and infrastructure challenges, lead to production 
costs higher in Nigeria than in other countries where EM 
operates. 
 
World Oil Prices Could Alter Challenges 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C)  Finally, the MD pointed to world oil prices as 
the \"wild card\" which could alter the relative importance of 
any of the challenges facing the industry.  For example,if 
world oil prices remain relatively high, the GON and NNPC are 
likely to face fewer problems funding JV projects.  However, 
if a glut in world oil capacity were to drive down prices, 
the GON would likely face intense pressures in balancing its 
JV budget with funding for pressing social needs. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (C)  Chaplain\'s cited challenges beg the question: why 
work in Nigeria?  For now, Nigeria\'s pros apparently 
outweight her cons.  Chaplain waxed optimistically as he 
discussed Nigeria\'s untapped oil and gas reserves. 
Nigeria, he said, is like the Gulf of Mexico in the 1970s. 
The industry is pushing into new frontiers, particularly 
deepwater exploration.  In addition, the high quality of 
Nigerian sweet crude commands a premium price, which allows 
the majors to realize significant economic returns, despite 
high production costs.  ExxonMobil paid the NDDC more than 
$100 million last year only because its revenues totaled more 
than $3 billion.  Nonetheless, the GON will need to make some 
adjustments to allow the sector to approach its potential. 
Immediate steps in that regard would be redressing the 
proposed gas fiscal terms 
and local content legislation.

Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  As of 0900 (local) December 7, thirty Chevron Texaco 
(CT) employees, including one Amcit, continued to be held at 
the Robert-kiri flow station near Port Harcourt, Rivers 
State.  There are no reports of injuries, threats, or 
maltreatment of the detained, and CT has been in 
communication with them.  While a few of them may have knives 
and other implements, the occupiers do not appear to be 
heavily armed.  Informal talks to resolve the occupation are 
on-going and formal negotiations in Port Harcourt may begin 
as early as noon (local) today, with community members, CT 
and state GON officials participating.  The Consul General 
and other Consulate officials have been in constant contact 
with Chevron and GON officials regarding the overall 
situation, and the status of the Amcit involved.  End 
Summary. 
 
30 CT Employees Still Held; No Reports of Injuries 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
2.  (C)  Chevron Texaco (CT) Nigeria\'s Environmental, Safety 
and Health Manager, Cheryl Robnett confirmed the 30 CT 
employees, including one Amcit, continue to be held at the 
Robert-kiri flow station (reftel).  Robnett confirmed CT is 
able to communicate with those being held.  While some of the 
townspeople may have knives or other homemade weapons, there 
are no reports that the occupiers are heavily armed.  No one 
has reported the presence of firearms.  Chevron confirms 
there are no reports of injuries and the employees are not 
being mis-treated. 
 
Formal Negotiations Scheduled to Begin Today 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C)  A Rivers State delegation went to the flowstation 
late yesterday evening to negotiate with community members. 
However, the community members refused to meet with the GON 
delegation last night.  According to Chevron, the community 
members talked via telephone to them.  The sides reached 
agreement to meet Chevron perhaps as early as noon today in 
Port Harcourt.  Rivers State officials will be included in 
these formal discussions.  The delegation will be led by 
Tonye Harry, Deputy Speaker of the Rivers State House of 
Assembly, who is from the community involved in the 
occupation. According to Chevron, the occupiers also agreed 
to begin to leave the facility, but we have no verification 
that this exit has begun. 
 
AMCIT Assistance 
----------------- 
 
4.  (C)  The Consul General has been in constant contact with 
Chevron officials regarding the status of the Amcit being 
held at Robert-kiri, and has discussed this matter with the 
Rivers State Deputy Governor.  (Note: Governor Odili is 
currently in Italy.  End note.)  Similarly, other sections of 
the Consulate, including the DATT and RSO, have been in 
regular communication with their Nigerian and Chevron 
counterparts.  The Consul General will also travel to Port 
Harcourt early on December 8 to meet with the Deputy Governor 
and oil company officials about this situation and other 
related issues. 
 
Supply Shortage is Concern; Re-Supply Plans in Process 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
5.  (C)  Chevron ESH Manager Robnett told energy officer, 
CT\'s major worry during a community invasion is a shortage of 
food and other supplies, since these disputes are usually 
resolved without injuries.  Normally, CT facilities are 
stocked with a couple of weeks of supplies for the small 
number of employees working at the facility.  With the 
addition of occupiers, supplies often run out quickly. 
Robnett said should the occupiers remain throughout today, CT 
will begin talking with them about re-supplying the facility.

SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS ON TIP INTERIM 
ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: LAGOS 2301 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian Browne for reason 1.5(b). 
 
1. (U) The information below responds to interim assessment 
follow-up questions from the November 19, 2004, email from 
Rachel Yousey. 
 
2. (U) Has NAPTIP investigated any of the informant reports 
of corruption among law enforcement, immigration, and airport 
officials? 
 
Answer: NAPTIP has begun to pursue some allegedly corrupt 
officials working at the airports (see paragraph 3).  NAPTIP 
officials said they are taking a cautious approach because of 
the sensitivity of the issue of corruption.  They need to be 
careful not to engender animosity within the police force and 
Immigration Service.  For their credibility and because of 
the inertia that sometimes affects the legal system, they 
know the first cases they pursue must be built on very solid 
information.  They considered their visits to various 
agencies to warn officials about the new law an important 
step in laying a foundation for pursuing cases effectively. 
 
3. (C) What is NAPTIP doing to address corruption among 
officials at the airports? 
 
Answer: NAPTIP has requested undercover access to airports 
from the minister of aviation. The agency has information on 
TIP syndicates that operate in the airports. Agency officials 
believe, however, that undercover access is necessary to 
finish building their cases and to arrest those officials 
involved in the alleged syndicates. The minister of aviation 
currently is considering NAPTIP\'s request. 
 
4. (U) Have Immigration Service anti-trafficking units done 
anything concrete? Are they actually engaged in combating 
trafficking? 
 
Answer: The units are engaged in combating trafficking.  The 
head of the unit in Edo State reported that they have 
presented public seminars in all local government areas. 
They support NAPTIP in surveillance, arrests, and 
prosecutions.  They receive deported victims and provide them 
a non-accusatory rehabilitative environment.  They interview 
the victims and help them find their relatives or connect 
them with a shelter. 
 
5. (U) What has the Ministry of Labour and Productivity\'s 
repatriation program accomplished? How many victims have been 
provided this food, transportation, and reunification 
assistance? Does the assistance overlap with that provided by 
NAPTIP and other programs? 
 
Answer: According to ILO, which funds the Ministry of Labour 
program, no children have been repatriated through the 
program yet.  With the first round of funding, the Ministry 
has conducted preparation activities, including training 
staff in several states and distributing information about 
the program to Nigerian embassies in other West African 
countries.  ILO expects to release the second funding tranche 
soon, with a goal of repatriating 100 externally trafficked 
children and 200 internally trafficked children.  It is 
expected NAPTIP and other agencies will rely on this program 
for repatriation assistance when victims are identified.

1. (SBU)  This cable provides an overview of a major new 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Nigeria.   ..Brass 
LNG is planned as a world class, greenfield facility to be 
located in Brass, Bayelsa State.  Brass LNG will be a two- 
train facility for liquefaction and shipping, with an 
initial production capacity of 10 million tons LNG, 2.4 
million LPG, and 0.2 million tons condensate annually. 
Brass LNG shareholders include the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Chevron Texaco, 
ConocoPhillips, and ENI International.  The Final Investment 
Decision for Brass LNG is projected for mid-2006.  Proposed 
downstream gas legislation and new gas fiscal terms could 
significantly impact the financial viability of the Brass 
project.  End summary. 
 
Project Overview 
----------------- 
 
2.  (U)  Brass Liquefied Natural Gas is planned as a world 
class, greenfield LNG facility to be located in Brass, 
Bayelsa State.  Brass LNG Limited incorporated in Nigeria on 
December 9, 2003.  The site will include a two-train 
facility for liquefaction, and shipping facilities.  Brass 
LNG\'s products will include 10 million metric tons of LNG, 
2.4 million metric tons of LPG, and 0.2 million metric tons 
of condensate per annum. 
 
Capital Structure and Financial Details 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U)  Shareholders for the Brass LNG plant include the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with a 49 
percent stake, and Chevron Texaco, ConocoPhillips, and ENI 
International, each with a 17 percent stake.  The notional 
budget for Brass LNG is about $3 billion, but more precise 
figures await completion of the Front End Engineering 
Design. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Additional investment for a possible expansion of 
Brass LNG might bring the total investment as high as $10 
billion.  Brass management does not endorse press reports of 
projected income of $10 billion annually for the project. 
 
Nigeria\'s Drive to End Gas Flaring 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Nigeria was chosen as the proposed site for the LNG 
plant due to its abundant supplies of natural gas (estimated 
at more than 170 to 180 trillion cubic feet, the seventh 
largest in the world), and because of the GON\'s campaign to 
end gas flaring by 2008. Natural gas projects such as Brass 
will play a significant role in developing an export market 
for gas that might  otherwise be flared. 
 
Proposed Brass Facilities 
--------------------------- 
 
 
6.  (U)  The conceptual design for Brass LNG involves 
locating an LNG processing facility on-shore, next to the 
existing Nigerian AGIP Oil Company (NAOC, the joint venture 
between parastatal NNPC and Italian ENI) oil terminal on 
Brass Island, Bayelsa State.  The waters off of Brass Island 
are quite shallow, so berthing ships is  problematic.  The 
proposed solution involves a 6-kilometer long trestle, with 
a jetty for LNG and LPG ships, turning basin and breakwater, 
and a 9-kilometer dredged channel to allow ships to 
approach. 
Gas Sourcing 
------------- 
 
7.  (U)  Once operations are underway, the various 
shareholders will each contribute approximately 850 million 
cubic feet/day of gas as feedstock from their existing 
fields. 
 
 
 
Project Milestones: FEED Contract Recently Signed 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8.  (U)  A number of significant project milestones have 
taken place.  Shareholders signed the Heads of Agreement 
(HOA) for Brass LNG in October 2003.  Brass LNG awarded the 
contract for the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) of the 
facility to Overseas Bechtel Incorporated on 10 November 
2004.  Completion of the FEED is expected within 12 months, 
and includes provisions for a subsidiary of NNPC, the 
National Engineering and Technical Company Limited, to 
participate in the contract.  The project will then move to 
the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction phase, 
expected to begin in the third quarter of 2006.  The project 
is planned for completion by the second half of 2009. 
 
End Market 
----------- 
 
9.  (SBU)  According to Martin Hutchison, Managing Director 
for Brass LNG, the facility\'s first LNG sales will likely be 
to the U.S., but consideration will also be given to the EU. 
Domestic sales are not currently planned, given the 
existence of price regulation in Nigeria\'s downstream 
market. 
 
Final Investment Decision 
------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU)  The Final Investment Decision (FID) for Brass 
LNG is expected in mid 2006.  According to MD Hutchison, 
steps to the FID include satisfactory conclusions on a range 
of issues, including: 
 
--Completion of the FEED and resolution of all technical 
issues 
--Competitive EPC environment 
--Community and other stakeholder engagement 
--Environmental considerations 
--Satisfactory security arrangements 
--Price and timing with respect to market entry 
--Impact of new legislation 
 
Policy Considerations 
----------------------- 
 
11.  (SBU)  Proposed GON downstream gas legislation and new 
gas fiscal terms could significantly impact the Brass 
project.  The Brass management team is carefully watching 
the evolution of these policies and conducting economic 
analysis to determine the impact of current and proposed 
fiscal terms on the project\'s viability. 
 
 
 
Comment 
--------- 
 
12.  (SBU)  There is a growing call in Nigeria for revival 
of the domestic gas market, particularly the domestic LPG 
for cooking.  Nigeria, despite its immense gas reserves, has 
the lowest per capita gas consumption in West Africa.  The 
domestic LPG market collapsed a few years ago, largely due 
to the imposition of a number of tariffs and taxes on 
imported LPG, including a 30 per cent import duty, 7 per 
cent port surcharge, and 5 per cent value added tax. 
Additionally, the country lacks a backbone gas pipeline 
system for domestic distribution, so LNG cannot easily be 
harnessed for power generation.  International investors 
have not been willing to consider investments in the 
domestic gas sector, as prices remain regulated and below 
international levels.  MD Hutchison frequently speaks on the 
need for realistic price signals in the Nigerian gas market 
before international investors will be tempted to invest in 
this area.  Unfortunately, as new export gas projects are 
approved and move ahead, the tension within country over the 
lack of gas for domestic use becomes ever more acute.

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  This cable responds to OPIC requests for Mission 
comments on OPIC insurance for the West Africa Gas Pipeline 
project.  Mission is not aware of any GON opposition to the 
WAGP project, and believes the project advances GON and USG 
goals.  There could be some negative publicity generated by 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Friends of the 
Earth/Environmental Rights Action regarding the project. 
Local communities and landowners that feel threatened by the 
project may also voice opposition.  In a country with a 
history of community and militia invasion and destruction of 
energy facilities, negative publicity regarding the project, 
whether well-founded or not, could be employed in a manner 
that increases the project\'s political risk.  However, most 
Nigerians support or are benignly indifferent to the project. 
 Greater engagement and information sharing with responsible 
Nigerian environmental NGOs and local communities could 
perhaps help reduce potential opposition to the project. 
 
WAGP Supportive of GON\'s Fiscal and Environmental Goals 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
2.  (C)  Mission is responding to OPIC requests for comments 
on possible OPIC insurance to be issued to the West African 
Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAPCo) for the construction of 
the West Africa Gas Pipeline project.  (Note: U.S. firm 
Chevron Texaco Global Technology Services Company made the 
application to OPIC on behalf of WAPCo.)  Mission notes that 
the GON fully supports the WAGP project, and in fact has a 25 
percent equity stake in the project through the parastatal 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.  We are not aware of 
any widespread public opposition to the project, although one 
NGO described public sentiment towards the project as mixed. 
Mission is not aware of any negative impact on U.S. policy 
and interests of the country, nor concerns regarding the 
integrity of WAPCo.  Mission believes WAGP supports Nigeria\'s 
stated economic and environmental goals in the gas sector. 
Mission is not aware of any uneconomic use of raw material or 
labor associated with WAGP, or adverse impact on the 
country\'s balance of payments.  Mission is not aware of 
deleterious worker health and safety impacts to the project. 
 
Possible Negative Publicity due to FOE/ERA Concerns 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3.  (C)  There could be possible negative publicity 
generated by comments made by international NGO Friends of 
the Earth (FOE).  FOE and its Nigerian affiliate, 
Environmental Rights Action (ERA), have commented negatively 
on WAGP\'s environmental impacts.  The groups assert that: 
 
--consultations on the environmental impact statement (EIA) 
report were flawed; 
--public presentation of the EIA was not properly carried 
out, as stakeholders had no access to the report at 
designated display centers; 
--the World Bank (WB) Extractive Industry Review restrains 
the WB from new investments in the extractive industries 
until areas of contention are resolved and corrective 
measures put in place; 
--the project is unlikely to reduce gas flaring; and 
--the project threatens the sovereignty of member countries. 
 
WAPCo/Chevron Texaco believe that they have adequately 
responded to concerns raised by the groups. 
 
Public Perception Can Generate Political Risk 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (C)  Regardless of the scientific facts concerning the 
environmental impact of WAGP, agitation by FOE/ERA and any 
resulting public perception of WAGP as environmentally or 
socially harmful could generate some political risk for the 
project.  A local newspaper published a lengthy article in 
early November, re-iterating FOE/ERA charges against WAGP. 
Even a small group, whether politically disaffected or 
motivated by possible monetary gain, has the potential to 
disrupt WAGP construction or operations.  Local communities 
that feel their existence or livelihoods may be threatened by 
the pipeline are also a concern.  Agitated local communities 
have been known to impede production activity in the oil 
sector and to occupy oil facilities periodically.  Similar 
actions can take place regarding a pipeline.  Other possible 
risks include physical attacks on WAPCo personnel and 
physical infrastructure.  Mission notes that companies 
operating in the Delta routinely receive extortionate letters 
demanding concessions to the local community, upon threat of 
kidnapping or physical violence.  While WAGP will be 
constructed to the west of Lagos and outside of the volatile 
Delta region, the project, particularly during the 
construction phase of the project, has the potential to 
attract disaffected groups seeking private gain.  As such, 
WAPCo could possibly be subject to some incidents of 
intimidation or threats of violence.  In all likelihood, such 
action would be of a much lesser degree than in the Delta. 
 
Court Case Moving Forward? 
--------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)  Supported by ERA, two private individuals have 
reportedly filed suit in Federal High Court to invalidate the 
WAGP Environmental Impact Statement.  Mission will report on 
the court case septel. 
 
Comments from Other Environmental Groups 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6.  (C)  The Nigerian Conservation Foundation has not yet 
commented on WAGP, maintaining they do not yet have 
sufficient information on the pipeline route to reach a 
conclusion on its impact.  Nigerian NGO Friends of the 
Environment Chairwoman attended three stakeholder meetings on 
WAGP, and found community sentiment toward the project to be 
mixed.  Given the potential gas flaring reduction benefits to 
WAGP, she believes the project should move forward, but did 
recommend the establishment of an independent monitoring 
group to ensure WAGP management met its obligations to local 
community groups. 
 
Comment 
-------- 
 
7.  (C)  Mission believes that greater engagement and 
information sharing with Nigerian environmental NGOs would be 
a prudent course of action to counteract some of the negative 
publicity generated by FOE/ERA.  While some environmental 
groups appear to be cautiously supportive of the project, 
others did not believe that they had sufficient information 
to render a final judgment on the project.  Engaging those 
NGOs who are willing to evaluate WAGP on its technical and 
environmental merits, rather than as a political test case, 
could improve public perception of the project, and hence the 
project\'s political risk profile.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  Major Nigerian newspapers published an 
extraordinary exchange of letters between President Obasanjo 
and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national chairman Audu 
Ogbeh.  In his letter, Ogbeh claimed Nigeria was in a parlous 
state, specifically citing Obasanjo\'s inaction in resolving 
the political crisis in Anambra.  In his rather 
unpresidential and brusque reply, Obasanjo admits to having 
learned that Ngige was the benefactor of a rigged election, 
yet turned a blind eye to this transgression.  Publication of 
the letters has sent the ruling PDP into a paroxysm of 
recrimination, with members of competing factions calling for 
the resignations of their internecine rivals.  Opposition 
parties are clamoring for Ngige\'s resignation or new 
elections.  Ngige has denied admitting he lost the election. 
End Summary. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Startling Letters on Anambra Crisis 
----------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U)  The December 13 \"This Day\" newspaper carried an 
exchange of letters on the Anambra crisis between President 
Obasanjo and PDP national chairman Ogbeh.  Ogbeh\'s letter, 
dated December 6, urged the president to resolve the crisis 
within the state and to arrest the arsonists who destroyed 
numerous government buildings November 10-11 (reftels). 
Obasanjo responded with a 14-page screed, defending his 
actions in Anambra and counter-accusing Ogbeh of failing in 
his duties as chairman to address the root of the crisis -- 
what Obasanjo termed the \"intraparty\" dispute between 
Governor Ngige and his nemesis Chris Uba (reftels). 
 
3.  (C)  Obasanjo continued in his letter that during a 2003 
meeting, Uba told Ngige, \"You know you did not win the 
election, and Ngige answered \"Yes, I know I did not win.\" 
The president writes he was \"horrified\" at hearing this and 
immediately asked both men to leave his residence.  However, 
since Ngige had been constitutionally declared the winner, 
Obasanjo said he decided to live with the \"moral dilemma\" by 
only having pro forma interaction with Ngige until the 
governor\'s term expired; Ngige did the \"honorable thing\" and 
resigned; and/or Ngige was thrown out of office legally. 
(Note: The All People\'s Progressive Alliance, APGA, is 
contesting Ngige\'s election in court.  APGA\'s Peter Obi is 
widely believed to have won Anambra.  End Note.)  Obasanjo 
claims the substance of this revelation about the fraudulent 
election was reported to Ogbeh who also failed to redress the 
issue.  (Comment: While trying to put the onus on Ogbeh as 
party chairman, Obasanjo is hoisted by his own petard.  What 
action could Ogbeh take to remove Ngige when Obasanjo, the 
nation\'s chief magistrate, remained passive, notwithstanding 
the criminal admissions he had heard?  End Comment.) 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Letter Fall-Out -- Calls for Resignations 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U)  Prominent, pro-Obasanjo members of the PDP, are 
calling on Ogbeh to resign.  However, PDP governors (who are 
mostly aligned with VP Atiku) are siding largely with Ogbeh. 
(Note: Increasingly, Ogbeh has been drifting toward Atiku\'s 
camp and away from Obasanjo.  End Note.)  The PDP national 
secretariat is meeting but has yet to issue an official 
 
SIPDIS 
statement.  All major opposition parties--the Alliance for 
Democracy (AD), APGA, and the All Nigerian Peoples Party 
(ANPP)--are bleating for Ngige\'s resignation.  AD Director of 
Publicity, Dayo Adeyeye went further than most other parties, 
saying that Obasanjo\'s revelation proves the PDP rigged 
elections across the country. (Note: The Yoruba-dominated AD 
lost control of most of the southwest to the PDP in 2003. 
End Note.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
Ngige Denies Admitting He Stole the Election 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) Ngige has publicly denied the president\'s allegation. 
 Ngige\'s press officer Chukks Akunna told Polchief that the 
governor \"never said such a thing to the president.\"  Akunna 
added that in his view the President\'s distaste for Ngige is 
\"personal\" and that Obasanjo seemed determine to see him 
ousted from office.  Yet in a conversation with the Consul 
General, the mercurial Ngige was much more coy, stating he 
would not allow himself to be drawn into this verbal fracas. 
He preferred to remain silent, letting \"people believe what 
they wanted to believe.\" In a meeting last month with 
Polchief, Ngige all but admitted not having won the election. 
 He said Uba \"helped\" him considerably. (reftels).  Akunna 
warned that the President may be in for more than he 
bargained since the 2003 presidential and gubernatorial 
elections were held in Anambra on the same day, on the same 
ballot.  If those ballots are false, then so too are the 
returns giving Obasanjo the victory in Anambra, Akunna 
asserted. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C)  Ogbeh\'s letter to Obasanjo was critical but 
professional.  In some passages, it was even statesmanlike, 
within a Nigerian political lexicon that tends  towards 
hyperbolic rhetoric.  Even in this milieu, Obasanjo\'s 
response is jarring.  The president\'s revelation that he 
heard Ngige admit to stealing the election, yet did nothing 
about it suggests he has lost his political compass.  In his 
desire to shift blame to Ogbeh, Obasanjo seems not to have 
considered that the public would hold him personally 
accountable for this gross failure to uphold the standards of 
democracy.  Conversely, Obasanjo may have taken a calculated 
risk.  By exposing his passivity, he also revealed Ngige\'s 
active criminality.  Obasanjo might have figured he could 
weather the resultant storm, but Ngige might not.  Moreover, 
should the nettlesome PDP chairman be swept in the tide, or 
at least made more reticent, so much the better.  Thus far, 
the public mostly appears to view Ogbeh as a \"patriot\", who 
sought to give the President sage, if difficult, counsel. 
However, Ogbeh\'s fate is in the hands of the party, not the 
public, and his future is unclear. 
 
7.  (C)  Comment Cont\'d.  Ngige is squarely on the hot seat 
right now and is squirming to find solace and support. 
Neither will come in abundance.  However, Ngige is resilient 
and will try to stay in place as long as possible.  How the 
electoral tribunal hearing the Anambra case handles this 
latest information will be telling.  This could well 
determine Ngige\'s destiny.  End Comment.

1. Summary 
 
Nigeria remains a major transit route for illicit 
trafficking of narcotic drugs. There is evidence that 
narcotics transiting Nigerian ports and borders reach 
the United States in amounts sufficient to have a 
significant effect on United States. However, Nigeria 
does not produce any of the narcotic drugs. 
Cannabis/marijuana is grown domestically in Nigeria and 
is exported to the neighboring West African countries 
from where it is exported to Europe. There is a small, 
but increasing local narcotics market. 
 
There is overwhelming evidence of Nigeria\'s strong 
commitment to keep narcotics from being transited 
through Nigeria and being abused by Nigerians. The 
overall result is prevention of narcotics from reaching 
markets in other countries. 
 
Nigeria\'s commitment is demonstrated by the creation of 
the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 
1989 and is currently headed by a very energetic and 
able Chairman and assisted by qualified personnel in 
the 37 commands throughout the country. The government 
of Nigeria has also taken steps to fully fund the 
agency though this has not been successful. But, the 
agency is budgeted for and at least the Government 
meets 50% of it.  There has been registered success in 
Drug Interdiction mostly at the airports though this 
still falls short of the overall expectations. 
Basically this is due to lack of adequate funding. 
Also, the Government established an Academy for NDLEA 
cadet and since its establishment, more than 5,000 
cadets have been trained. In its fight against illicit 
drug trafficking, NDLEA has lost more than 200 
personnel in the process. Despite inadequate resources, 
NDLEA is still performing an excellent job in drug 
interdiction. Nigeria is part to the 1988 UN Drug 
Convention. 
 
11. Status of Country 
 
As mentioned in para.1, Nigeria is not producer of 
narcotic drugs but a major drug-transit hub. Heroin and 
Cocaine transit Nigeria on their way to neighboring 
countries, Southern Africa, Europe and increasingly to 
the United States. These drugs originate outside Africa 
as demonstrated by the origins of the flights from 
which the traffickers are arrested. 
Drug interdiction is the sole responsibility of the 
NDLEA. However, NDLEA works alongside other agencies 
mentioned in the previous report. Heroin and Cocaine 
seizures have dominated the NDLEA activities at the 
Murtala Mohamed International Airport in Lagos. There 
was however a major seizure of 30 kilograms of Cocaine 
at the Benin-Nigerian border post in December. This 
shows how the drug traffickers keep changing their 
tactics upon an improvement in NDLEA\'s continued 
performance of its duties. Trade in and local 
consumption of Marijuana has been on the increase in 
the year 2004. This is shown by the quantities seized 
and the number of arrest made in the year. On the whole 
there has been an increase in narcotic drugs business 
despite Government efforts to combat illegal 
trafficking in drugs. 
 
111. Country Actions Against Drugs in 2004 
 
Policy Initiatives. 
The relationship between the U.S government and 
Nigerian Agencies has continued to improve.  Training 
programs, technical assistance and equipment donations 
have continued. NDLEA Academy in Jos, Plateau State 
received twenty computers and is still targeted in the 
next letter of amendment. Other beneficiaries in the 
5th Amended Letter of Agreement are EFCC and NPF. 
 
 
 
 
 
Accomplishments- 
In 2004, NDLEA commenced a systematic implementation of 
all various anti-money laundering legislations and 
policies. Based on this, five commercial banks have 
been investigated and prosecuted for aiding and 
abetting money laundering. NDLEA also intensified its 
bank inspection operations. 
NDLEA continues to lead in the region in the fight 
against drug trafficking. It has initiated and 
established a permanent secretariat for the Inter- 
Governmental Action Task Force Against Money Laundering 
in West Africa (GIABA). 
 
 
Law Enforcement Efforts 
In 2004, NDLEA seized 51,022.04 kilograms of cannabis, 
92.273 kilograms of cocaine, 53.368 kilograms of heroin 
and 198.118 kilograms of psychotropic substances by the 
end of October. In the same period, the agency arrested 
3,067 drug traffickers and over 98% of them were 
successfully prosecuted. The seizures were concentrated 
airports, seaports and border posts. NDLEA still 
experiences lack of enough personnel to cover all the 
entry points. 
In the same period, the Nigerian government intensified 
its campaign against corruption by going against 
serving government officials including state Governors. 
President Olusegun Obasanjo has consistently berated 
state government officials over misappropriation of 
public funds. A case for the review of the Federal 
constitution has been made and the immunity clause 
under which the governors were hiding is up for review. 
 
 
 
Corruption- Corruption is fully entrenched in the 
Nigerian society and still remains a significant 
barrier to effective narcotics enforcement. It is 
systematic and society tends to condone it. The socio- 
economic conditions in Nigeria seem to be the root 
cause. There is widespread unemployment and the 
salaries of Civil servants are meager. The government 
often fails to pay salaries on time. The most affected 
in this group are the Law Enforcement officers who have 
fallen victims of corruption. Several have been 
dismissed as a result of being compromised. I effort to 
combat corruption, the Nigerian Government, through the 
Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Act of 
2000, established the Independent Corrupt Practices and 
Other Related Offences Commission. The Act prohibits 
corrupt practices and other related offences;, and also 
prescribes punishment for the offences. Under Section 
6, the Commission is empowered to receive and 
investigate reports of corruption and where 
justifiable, prosecute the offenders. It is also 
empowered to educate the public on and against bribery, 
corruption and other related offences. The commission 
in 2004 endeavored to execute its duties despite the 
logistical problems it faced.  The Commission as 
embarked on a public awareness campaign and has so far 
taken it to primary and Tertiary institutions. In 2004, 
ICPC has investigated and is in the process of 
prosecuting high profile Nigerian government officials. 
These include Judges, Commissioners, Permanent 
Secretaries and Ministers. An attempt by the National 
 
SIPDIS 
Assembly to repeal the Anti-corruption Act 2001 has 
failed. The government is more than committed to the 
anti-corruption crusade. There is a proposed 
constitutional amendment to remove the immunity of 
Governors and currently there is a governor being 
investigated for corruption and money laundering. ICPC 
also established a training academy. ICPC now boasts of 
12 qualified and motivated prosecutors and is now 
recruiting private prosecutors to replace the police 
prosecutors. It has also established two zonal offices 
and expects to open four more offices in 2005. The 
government has also appointed two Judges in each of the 
37 states to handle corruption cases. The ICOPC budget 
was presented to the National Assembly, defended and it 
is hoped that the budget will be approved with minor 
amendments. 
 
All cases dealt with by the Commission have no 
relationship with Narcotic drugs trafficking. The USG 
provided technical assistance to the Commission through 
the Bureau of international Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Agency. It was the second phase of the 
program and through it the Commission will get 
additional training and technical assistance. This 
includes a Resident Legal Advisor (RLA). She is 
currently in Nigeria on a fact-finding mission and will 
be back in March 2005 for six months. 
Agreements and Treaties-Nigeria is party to the 1988 UN 
Drug Convention, the 1961 UN Single Convention on 
Narcotic Drugs, as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and 
the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. 
Nigeria ratified the UN Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, and the 
Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants. The 1931 
U.S-UK Extradition treaty, which was made applicable to 
Nigeria in 1935, is the legal basis for U.S extradition 
requests. The U.S-Nigeria Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty (MLAT) that was entered into on January 14 2003 
is still in force. 
 
Cultivation /Production-Marijuana/Cannabis is grown all 
over Nigeria but it is concentrated in central and 
northern states of the country. I t is also grown in 
large quantities in Ondo and Delta states. Its market 
is concentrated in West Africa and Europe. None is 
known to have found its way to the United States. In 
the execution of its duties, NDLEA destroyed more than 
200,000 hectares of it in 2004. 
 
 
Drug Flow/Transit-Nigeria remains a conduit for heroin 
and Cocaine from Asia and South America respectively. 
Interdiction is mainly at the Murtala Mohamed 
International Airport in Lagos where NDLEA conducts 100 
percent searches on both passengers and luggage. This 
has led to the change of routes by traffickers. The use 
of Port Harcourt Airport by British Airways has been 
identified as a new route in Nigeria. The use of 
seaports is still the preferred means because of the 
laxity of security at these ports. 
 
 
Domestic Programs (Demand Reduction) - As stated in the 
2004 report, drug abuse is on the rise in Nigeria. This 
is a result of the availability of the drugs on the 
local market in Nigeria\'s large cities. Local 
cultivation and use are still big problems in Nigeria. 
However, NDLEA has expanded its counter-narcotics 
programs to primary and Tertiary institutions. In 2004, 
NDLEA improved on its sub-regional operational scheme 
and launched a special operation code named \"Operation 
Tiger\". The success of this operation has been 
unprecedented. It has led to seizures of substantial 
amounts of narcotics and the apprehension of several 
drug dealers who have provided valuable information to 
the agency. 
 
 
 
1V.  U.S Policy Initiatives and Programs 
Policy Initiatives-The U.S-Nigeria counter narcotics 
cooperation did not change in 2004. U.S training 
programs, technical assistance and equipment donations 
to NDLEA have continued. In 2004, the 2002 Letter of 
Agreement signed by the USG and the Government of 
Nigeria was amended for the fourth time. The Fourth 
amendment provides for additional $ 300,000 for the 
modernization of the Nigerian Police Force. 
 
Bilateral Accomplishments - No comment 
 
The Road Ahead 
The Nigerian Police force has not been very cooperative 
in its dealings with the U.S Government. This has been 
manifested in its failure to follow a new recruit 
curriculum and a mid-level in-service training program 
that were designed by the Department of Justice 
advisors to the Nigerian Police Force. The Minister of 
Police affairs had also refused to sign the 4th 
Amendment to the Letter of Agreement in which the NPF 
was the sole beneficially. He later signed when 
Washington gave us a deadline. He, however, expressed 
his willingness to call all the parties involved in 
Police activities to wit IG, Chairman Police Service 
commission, his Permanent Secretary and the U.S 
mission. He has not done anything on it. The Inspector 
of Government (IG) has been a stumbling block in the 
operations of the police. According to the Minister of 
Police Affairs, the IG has persistently failed to 
report to him about the assistance that the U.S 
government has been rendering to the police force. A 
lot is still desired from the police administration. 
The remaining Agencies (NDLEA, ICPC & EFCC) have shown 
that they are committed to their work and there are 
indicators that they are now effective on the ground. 
The progress so far made by them is capable of being 
sustained with minimum guidance. The political will to 
prevent corruption and tackle drug trafficking is 
apparent and this has enabled the agencies to perform 
their duties with ease.

Nigeria is still the most populous country in Africa. 
It has a large economy that has been mismanaged over 
the past years and as a result poverty is prevailing. 
The economy is growing but not at the pace to cater 
for the high unemployment. Because of the economic 
problems faced by the society, Nigerians have resorted 
to crimes such as trafficking of persons, narcotics 
and financial fraud commonly known as 419. Efforts 
have been made by the government to put an end to 
these crimes but the socio-economic conditions have 
not been conducive to the measures put in place. \"Four- 
One-Nine\" otherwise known as Advance fee fraud is the 
most practiced form of financial crimes in Nigeria. In 
2001, Nigeria was placed on the list of non- 
cooperative countries and territories in combating 
money laundering. It has not been proved that money 
laundering in Nigeria is related to narcotic proceeds 
or that the proceeds from money laundering are 
controlled by local drug-trafficking organizations. 
Most of the transactions leading to money laundering 
is done through commercial banks and this is why the 
EFCC is now mandated to regularly inspect bank 
transactions. 
Government law, policy and practice discourage money 
laundering. This is seen from the laws enacted since 
2002 and the institutions put in place to combat it. 
Money laundering is a criminal offence in Nigeria 
under the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004. 
This law also covers drug-related money laundering. 
 
The economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) 
was created in 2002 and has actually been in operation 
since April 2003. In 2004, EFCC has recorded 
remarkable success in the area of money laundering. 
Notorious Advance Fee Fraud Kingpins (419) have been 
arrested and are currently being prosecuted by the 
EFCC. These include a group that was involved in the 
renowned Brazilian Bank scam involving $242 million. 
Their assets worth about $300 million have also been 
seized. 
 
In 2004, the commission has been involved in the 
prosecution of more than 100 high profile financial 
crime cases in the Nigerian High Courts. These cases 
involve Pipeline vandalization, tax evasion, bank 
frauds and money laundering. For the first time in the 
history of the country, a sitting Governor is being 
tried for corruption and money laundering. Several 
Nigerians have also been charged with terrorism. There 
are several money laundering cases being tried in the 
high court. In 2004 a conviction was secured in the 
High court in Kaduna 
 
In 2004, the Commission established the Financial 
Intelligence Unit (FIU) as a pilot scheme. FIU is now 
receiving and analyzing Suspicious Transaction reports 
(STRs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs). This 
helps the Unit to monitor money trail and typologies 
for money laundering. EFCC shares these reports with 
other Law Enforcement Agencies locally and 
internationally. 
 
 However, in 2004, a lot of efforts were made. NDLEA 
intensified bank inspection operations. Also, Nigeria 
initiated and tirelessly followed up the establishment 
of a permanent secretariat for the Intergovernmental 
Action Task Force Against Money Laundering in West 
Africa (GIABA). As a result of these efforts, Nigeria 
has been removed from the list of non-cooperative 
countries. 
 
Nigeria is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention 
against Transinational organized Crime. Nigeria is 
also a signatory to the UN Convention Against 
Corruption. 
 
The Government of Nigeria continues to ensure that 
money laundering and other financial crime are reduced 
in Nigeria. EFCC and ICPC are doing a great job in the 
area. The laws are in place and if the constitution is 
amended to provide for the prosecution of sitting 
Governors for corruption, it will be a great 
achievement in the war against money laundering.

1. (SBU) Summary. Private sector and Nigerian economists and 
American businessmen with interests in Nigeria told the 
visiting U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Nigeria Trade and 
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks that the Nigerian 
economy remains a mixed story.  President Obasanjo\'s vaunted 
economic dream team has crafted and partially implemented 
some needed economic reforms.  However, a myriad of political 
considerations mixed with cronyism, counterproductive 
economic nationalism and ambivalence toward free markets have 
stymied many reforms and produced numerous protectionist 
measures. 
 
 
 
2.  (SBU)  Summary Cont\'d:  Participants asserted that one of 
the most significant challenges facing the Nigerian economy 
is a capricious regulatory environment, characterized by 
import bans established in a manner that would do Byzantium 
proud.  Nigeria\'s high-cost business environment poses 
additional concerns.  Nevertheless, participants concurred 
that Nigeria offers a wealth of business opportunities. 
Participants urged the U.S. delegation to press the GON for 
greater economic openness and consistency in order to fuel 
economic growth and more robust non-oil sector income 
generation.  End summary. 
 
SNAPSHOT OF ECONOMY 
------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Economic experts Ayo Teriba and Bismarck Rewane 
presented an overview of the Nigerian economy to the U.S. 
TIFA delegation.  With a GDP of $53 billion (formal economy 
only), Nigeria has the fourth largest economy in Africa.  The 
average GDP growth rate in the last five years has been 4.9 
percent.  However, income inequality has also increased.  The 
Gini coefficient for Nigeria is now approximately .60. 
(Note: The Gini coefficient is a number between 0 and 1, 
where 0 corresponds with perfect equality -- everyone has the 
same income -- and 1 corresponds with perfect inequality -- 
where one person has all the income, and everyone else has 
zero income.  The Gini index for Nigeria was 50.6 during 
1996-1997, which was associated with the richest 20 percent 
of the population accounting for 55.7 percent of income while 
the poorest 20 percent accounted for 4.4 percent of that 
period\'s income.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU)  Nigeria\'s primary sector (agriculture and crude 
petroleum) accounts for 49% of GDP and services account for 
44%.  Nigeria\'s small secondary sector (manufacturing, 
utilities, and mining) accounts for only 7% of GDP, making 
the country chronically import-dependent. In 2003, imports of 
manufactured goods, machinery and transport equipment and 
chemicals accounted for 73.9 percent of total imports.  For 
most of these items, there is no comparable domestic 
production, making import bans an ineffective policy for 
spurring local production. 
 
PRESIDENT CHANGES THE RULES OVERNIGHT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Dick Kramer, a long-time US businessperson in Nigeria 
told the TIFA delegation that President Obasanjo is 
determined to establish a \"legacy\" before he is 
constitutionally out of office in 2007.  Kramer believed that 
Obasanjo is under this self-imposed pressure to rush his 
economic reform plan.  He argued Nigeria would have been 
better served had Obasanjo begun implementing these needed 
reforms in his first term. 
 
6. (C) Fuad Abdullah of Proctor and Gamble expressed 
frustration that Nigeria economic conditions often change 
almost overnight. Lagos Business School Director Pat Utomi 
remarked that policy formulation often appears as \"cloak and 
dagger\" creating an uncertain business environment.  The 
U.S. businessmen noted that corporate investment plans are 
long-range and require consistent, predictable economic 
policies.  Manufacturers, they said, work on the basis of a 
7- to 10-year horizon; while petroleum industry companies 
often work from 30-year business models.  Despite instituting 
some good economic reforms, Obasanjo has failed to deliver 
investors what they need most -- predictability and 
consistency. 
 
DREAM TEAM: MORE BRAINS THAN POLITICAL MUSCLE 
--------------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) The Nigerian economic analysts and U.S. businessmen 
concurred that Obasanjo has assembled an impressive  \"dream 
team\" of economic advisors. Federal budget transparency, the 
pension reform act, the National Economic Empowerment and 
Development Strategy (NEEDS), and banking recapitalization 
were cited as examples of necessary economic initiatives. 
However, participants said, implementation has lagged. 
Participants further noted that the economic dream team only 
has influence over a limited range of economic decisions 
affecting trade and investment. 
 
WHY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD POLICIES 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Participants said some policies intended to reform 
and benefit the economy are having unintended negative 
effects.  For example, Rewane asserted that thus far the only 
implementation of the pension reform is that money is being 
deducted from federal employees\'s paychecks to be set aside 
for eventual investment.  But because adequate investment 
vehicles do not yet exist for these monies, the pension 
reform is having the effect of decreasing consumer purchasing 
power without  a counterbalancing increase in investment. 
Similarly, participants assessed the banking reform requiring 
a minimum 25 billion naira capitalization base for all banks 
as a good initiative.  However, the demand that banks attain 
this level in only 18 months -- was problematic, they said. 
The result has been hurried mergers and an erosion in public 
confidence in the banking sector. 
 
Import Bans - Bane of Existence 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Problems posed by import bans are having a much 
larger negative impact on both local and international 
companies operating in Nigeria.  The bans purportedly are to 
protect and encourage local production.  Yet,  because of the 
ad-hocery that characterizes the ban and tariff regime, even 
this stated goal is hardly realized. Many local manufacturers 
have been unable to obtain or afford production inputs 
because many import bans prohibit goods required in their 
manufacturing  processes.  In some areas, local manufacturers 
have been forced to close or reduce operations, leaving the 
country even more dependent on imports in these sectors -- 
exactly the situation the GON intended to reverse. 
 
10. (C) Abdullah of Proctor and Gamble said P & G has yet to 
see a profit on USD 50 million invested in Nigeria (ref A). 
Nigeria\'s ban on essential manufacturing inputs not available 
locally caused the company to lose USD 50,000 per day from 
July to November.  Abdullah said President Obasanjo\'s promise 
in September to lift the ban was not effectuated until late 
November. Abdullah added it would be helpful if there were a 
single point person within the GON with whom multinational 
companies could liaise.  (Comment:  The bans symbolize the 
duality of the Nigerian economic environment.  On one hand, 
some reform is afoot.  On the other, political and other 
objectives trump purely economic considerations. It is in 
this complex ambit of political payback and nepotism, 
regional and ethnic considerations, and  corruption, that the 
ban and tariff regime is crafted.  Moreover, it is authored 
by people not on the economic dream team, but by those within 
the innermost circle of political confidants and loyalists. 
The decisional process is opaque.  The players involved often 
shift, depending on the particular issue in question.  As a 
result, the tariff/ban regime has become a patchwork of 
protection of special interests that are not even always 
internally consistent.  End Comment.) 
 
Nigeria\'s High-Cost Business Environment 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) Peter Yap, MD of Harris Corporation, the largest 
supplier of telecomm equipment in Nigeria, told the U.S. TIFA 
delegation of \"perpetual challenges\" characterizing the 
Nigerian business climate.  Lack of transparency, excessive 
import document requirements, the need for additional 
security measures, infrastructure weaknesses, civil 
disturbances were all perennial features of the Nigerian 
landscape, Yap said.  Paul McKee of Seaboard Group echoed 
Yap\'s sentiments, telling the delegation that Nigeria is an 
unnecessarily expensive business environment.  Companies must 
often supply their own power, water, and road maintenance and 
even when a company is prepared to tackle these 
infrastructure challenges, it still must contend with 
corruption.  McKee noted for example that Seaboard was 
willing to pave the road leading into its facilities, but was 
prevented from doing so by local political bosses who derive 
rent from getting successive contracts to repair roads and 
never fulfilling the contracts. 
 
12. (SBU) Nigerian economic experts and U.S. businessmen 
pleaded for greater predictability and stability from the GON 
and urged the USG to exhort the GON on their behalf.  The US 
TIFA delegation raised these concerns with GON officials, but 
did not receive much traction. (See ref C for a report on the 
formal GON-USG trade and investment talks). 
 
13. (C) Comment: President Obasanjo has given his economic 
advisers some latitude in developing progressive economic 
reforms.  However, there are cross currents. Obasanjo is at 
core a military man.  His life experiences have been based on 
control and hierarchical systems\' attributes 
counterproductive to economic growth and dynamism. In 
addition, as described ref B, economic reforms are 
constrained by a complex web of counterpoised patron/client 
networks.  Obasanjo is beholden to this system, which helped 
him ascend to the presidency and his economic decisions must 
respect the business interests of those in this club. 
 
14.  (C) Comment Cont\'d.  Moreover, the issue is not just 
Obasanjo; rather there is an entire, powerful body of people 
who are reluctant to fully embrace market forces.  In sum, 
there are three sets of players on the Nigerian economic 
stage: 1) Reformers; 2) Those who tepidly back reform as long 
as they are not unduly hurt; and 3) Those who favor the 
protectionist status quo.  Groups one and three are 
antinomies and will never reconcile.  Ultimate victory 
belongs to the side that can win the majority of members of 
the middle group.  End Comment.

Session: Bismarck J. Rewane, CEO and MD of Financial 
Derivatives, Ayodele O. Teriba, CEO of Economic Associates, 
Atedo Peterside, CEO of Investment Banking and Trust Company

Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (U)  Press reports indicate a Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) pipeline was vandalized, with 
the resulting spill set ablaze in the Lagos exburb of Ilado 
on December 20.  The pipeline fire was reportedly 
extinguished late December 22, although NNPC was not willing 
to confirm this.  Consulate personnel confirmed the presence 
of smoke and a large fire in that general area.  Fatalities 
are likely, and there are unconfirmed reports that toll may 
reach 200.  The NNPC pipeline carried fuel from the Atlas 
Cove Jetty to NNPC fuel depots in Ejigbo, Lagos and Mosimi 
in Ogun State. 
 
2.  (U)  The press reports that NNPC security and the police 
were attempting to arrest the bunkerers, when the bunkerers 
ignited the fire in retaliation.  The blaze quickly spread 
in the nearby area.  This was the second major fire in the 
Ilado area in the last three months; the previous fire 
killed around fifty.  Ilado now has a reputation as a \"haven 
for illegal bunkering.\"

of five deep offshore oil blocs in the zone. Bidding in this 
second JDZ licensing round closed December 15. Edmund 
Daukoru, Presidential Adviser on Petroleum and Energy, said 
the awards of oil blocks 2 through 6 would be concluded by 
31 December, 2004, when winners will be announced. (Note: 
The GON awarded rights to develop bloc 1 to a consortium 
involving ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil and Norway\'s Equity 
Energy Resources for $123 million in 2003. End note.) 
Overall, 26 oil companies submitted bids for the five oil 
blocks on offer. 
 
------------------------------- 
Intense Bidding for Bloc Four 
------------------------------- 
3. (U) There is considerable interest in bloc 4, which 
covers 857 sq km, and is considered the most lucrative bloc. 
Leading competitors for block 4 include Houston-based 
Environmental Remediation Holding Corporation (ERHC), now 
50% owned by Nigerian operator Chrome Energy.  (Note: Chrome 
is expected to exercise a preferential right for bloc 4, as 
the company secured working interests in six blocs two years 
ago.  End note.) U.S. firm ECL International offered the 
largest signature bonus of $175 million, and so must be 
considered a leading competitor.  (Note: Signature bonuses 
are one important component in the GON\'s evaluation of a 
firm\'s offer.)  However, the spotlight has been on Nigerian 
firm Conoil\'s offer of a signature bonus of $150 million 
(N20 billion).  This is a ground-breaking offer for an 
indigenous firm, which historically have been small and 
undercapitalized.  The GON is attempting to increase 
national content in the energy sector; awarding bloc 4 to 
Conoil would meet this objective, while still ensuring the 
GON gains a significant signature bonus.  U.S. firm Vintage 
Oil and Gas also bid on Bloc 4, offering a $135 million 
bonus; indigenous oil companies Anardako Petroleum and 
Hercule Oil/Centurion Energy bid $90 million and $81 
million, respectively, in signature bonuses. 
-------------------------- 
Bids For Additional Blocs 
-------------------------- 
4. (U) Energy Equity Resources, Filtim Huzod Oil and Gas 
Limited, and a consortium composed of Kuwait-based I.C.C. 
and Iranian firm Oil Exploration and Operations Company 
(OEOC)bid for blocks 3, 5 and 6. Signature bonuses offered 
by these companies ranged between $37 million and $45 
million.

SUBJECT: SEABULK EMPLOYEE TAKEN HOSTAGE 
 
Classified By: Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne for Reason 
s 1.4 (D & E) 
 
Summary 
-------- 
 
1.  (C)  Seabulk reported to Energy Off on 26 December that 
an employee was taken hostage near Amatu, Bayelsa State, on 
25 December while carrying out operations for Shell.  The 
employee is a Croatian national.  The Iduwini National 
Movement for Peace and Development is demanding ransom and 
other concessions from Shell and its contractors for his 
release.  Shell and Seabulk are negotiating with Delta and 
Bayelsa state and local officials tomorrow, 28 December.  The 
Seabulk Managing Director recently reported to us that 
security in the Delta region is becoming less certain, and 
Seabulk has had to forgo contracts and lose money due to 
increased security concerns. 
 
Seabulk Croatian Employee Kidnapped From Vessel at Gunpoint 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
2.  (C)  Managing Director (MD) Robert Clemmons of Seabulk 
reported that Croatian employee, engineer Ivan Roso, was 
taken hostage near Amatu, Bayelsa State, approximately 20 
miles off-shore of the Dodo River, on 25 December.  A Seabulk 
vessel was operating for Shell when it was approached by a 
heavily armed boat mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun. 
Bandits commandeered the Seabulk vessel; the vessel and most 
of the crew were eventually released.  However, Roso, the 
first mate, was retained as a hostage; it is not clear why he 
was targeted.  Seabulk management believes Roso is possibly 
being held at an old cement factory in Bayelsa State. 
Clemmons stated that reports indicate Roso is being treated 
well. 
 
Iduwini National Movement Makes Ransom Demands 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3.  (C)  Clemmons reports a group called the Iduwini National 
Movement for Peace and Development has made numerous demands 
for Roso\'s release, including ransom ranging from 20 million 
to 50 million Naira (approximately 147,000 USD to 367,000 
USD).  Clemmons stated that Seabulk appears to have been 
caught in the middle of a dispute between Shell; Shell\'s 
normal contractor in the area, Maersk; and members of the 
Iduwini  Movement.  (Note: Seabulk had agreed to lift oil for 
Shell during the holidays, as its normal contractor for this 
area, Maersk, was not operating.  End note.)  Additional 
demands by the Iduwini National Movement for Roso\'s release 
are directed towards Shell and Maersk, and relate to 
employment, memorandums of understanding, and ceasing legal 
action against the group.  Clemmons charged Shell, in 
critical need of a substitute for Maersk, with concealing the 
true level of operational risk in the area from Seabulk. 
 
Negotiations On-Going in Bayelsa and Delta 
------------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  Clemmons reported Shell is taking the lead role in 
the negotiations; Shell and Seabulk are seeking assistance 
from both Bayelsa and Delta State officials. (While Roso was 
kidnapped in Bayelsa State, many key security officials for 
both the government and Shell are based in Warri, Delta 
State.)  In line with advice from the CG, Clemmons will meet 
tomorrow, 28 December, with the Delta State Governor and 
other officials to seek assistance prior entering 
negotiations with the Iduwini Movement.  The CG has offered 
to further assist by interceding with state officials if 
Seabulk believes it is necessary.  Energy Off, RSO, and ACS 
Officer have maintained regular contact with Clemmons, and 
have given him advice on negotiations and personal safety as 
he travels in the Delta region.  (Note: Clemmons is an AMCIT, 
and a regular Consulate contact in tracking events in the 
region.) 
 
Clemons had Predicted Upswing in Violence 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5.  (C)  In a discussion with Energy Off one week ago, 
Clemmons predicted an upswing in violence in the Delta again 
after the holidays, when operations again return to full 
swing.  Consistent with other recent reports from 
interlocutors in the region, Clemmons stated security in the 
Delta region is becoming critical.  Retaining staff is 
becoming a large issue; the captain of the vessel 
commandeered on 25 December is leaving the country.  Clemmons 
observed that security costs are escalating significantly. 
For example, entry into an area now requires prior 
negotiations with the community.  Seabulk maintains on-going 
discussions with 17 communities to support its current 
operations.  These security complications have caused Seabulk 
to lose several million dollars in the last few months in 
increased costs and lost business opportunities. 
 
Donated Chevron Boats May Pose a Danger 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Clemmons also claimed that two speed boats donated 
by Chevron Texaco to its host community in Escravos are now 
being used to hold up maritime vessels.  Clemmons reported 
the vessels are capable of 28 and 32 knots, and are faster 
than any Seabulk vessel, placing his and other maritime crews 
in considerable danger. Clemmons reported at least one of the 
vessels has a 50-caliber machine gun mounted on it. 
(Comment: We cannot currently confirm this claim about the 
use of the Chevron-donated boats.  However, it highlights the 
complexities of operating in the Delta.  Assets used to 
resolve one problem can transform to cause another problem. 
We will check with Chevron to learn the current status of the 
two donated boats, and comment septel.  End comment.)

TAGS: ECON, SOCI, PGOV, NI 
SUBJECT: Person-on-the-street in Lagos: How\'s the 
Economy? 
 
 
1.  (U) Summary: Official statements and statistics 
emanating from the GON give a picture of an economy on 
the rebound.  However, the official position is at 
variance with what one hears in the market stalls and 
living rooms of Lagos.  Consulate staff interviewed a 
cross-section of Lagosians, soliciting their overall 
impressions of the economy.  The verdict -- bad.  High 
fuel costs, lack of a reliable power supply, and 
increased costs of living were universally cited as top 
concerns.  Discussants blamed the federal government 
and President Obasanjo for these problems.  They voiced 
severe skepticism about the economic reforms, which the 
government vaunts are paving the way for economic 
growth.  This report, by definition, is 
impressionistic.  However, this person-on-the-street 
perspective is reflective of the mood in Lagos and 
probably of the mood throughout most of southern 
Nigeria.  In other words, most Nigerians think times 
are hard and getting harder.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Fuel, Power, and the High Cost of Living 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Almost every individual complained most 
vociferously about fuel costs.  To our surprise, there 
was no variance by income level.  The teacher, street 
vendor, mid-management banker, all cited fuel costs as 
their number one concern and claimed the recent fuel 
price increases significantly drained their disposable 
income.  (Note: In October, as part of downstream 
deregulation reforms, the GON raised the price of 
gasoline from N43 to N53 per liter.  The GON then 
lowered the official price to N49 in November following 
a four-day national strike.  Increases in fuel costs 
have a ripple effect leading to price hikes across a 
wide range of sectors, including consumer goods and 
comestibles.  Some increases may be warranted, but many 
appear opportunistic.  End note.) 
 
3.  (U) Electricity, or rather the lack thereof, was 
the second most-cited concern.  Lagosians with the 
wherewithal to have generators at home have relied 
almost exclusively on these auxiliary sources of power 
for the past several months.  The cost is high.  A mid- 
level sales manager for a Nigerian beer company told us 
he spent N7, 000 to run his generator in the month of 
November.  This cost is in addition to the tariff he 
will still have to pay the non-performing National 
Electric Power Authority (NEPA).  The generator costs 
represent almost 10 percent of the manager\'s monthly 
net salary of N72,000.  Yet he was among the fortunate 
minority.  Most Lagosians simply remained in the dark 
at night; they lived by candles.  Televisions remained 
off; air conditioners and fans were not on for weeks. 
Sections of Lagos were eerily dark and quiet.  People 
were bored and hot in the evenings.  During the day, 
those small businesses that relied on NEPA as their 
exclusive power supply ground to a halt.  Many 
Lagosians did not make money during the extended power 
shortage that was the prelude to this holiday season. 
 
4.  (SBU) A printer, who produces office supplies and 
is a member of the Nigerian Association of Small and 
Medium Enterprises (NASME), said fuel price increases 
and insufficient power supply were twin scourges of the 
Nigerian economy.  Most production is done from 
auxiliary power sources, and the fuel for these 
generators is increasingly expensive.  She said that 
most small and medium enterprises (SMEs) pass the extra 
costs to consumers, since they do not have the 
economies of scale to absorb these shocks.  To further 
reduce overhead, some SMEs have resorted to hiring only 
part-time workers.  NASME members would produce more 
and generate more employment if the power supply were 
sufficient and reliable, this member said. 
 
5.  (U) Complaints about the high cost of living and 
low purchasing power were on the lips of all our 
interlocutors.  The price of 50 kg of imported rice, a 
staple here, has increased 20 percent to N6,000 ($45) 
in less than a year.  The price of 10 kg of imported 
frozen chicken increased 33 percent to N4,000 ($30). 
Many Lagosians have had to buy cheaper foods and reduce 
their consumption of meat in order to put enough food 
on the table to feed their families.  Housing costs 
have spiraled in commercial centers like Lagos. 
Claiming they too are only trying to cope with the 
rising cost of living, many landlords have raised rents 
significantly even though they have made no 
improvements to the accommodations.  An FSN reported 
her annual rent for a standard three-bedroom apartment 
increased from N150,000 ($1,128) for 2003 to about 
N250,000 ($1,880) for 2004.  A parking lot attendant 
said he and other tenants in a densely populated area 
of the city now pay as much as N2,000 ($15) monthly for 
a single room on the mainland, up from N800-N1000 
($6.00-$7.50) previously.  Additionally, many landlords 
are asking for one to three years\' lease payment in 
advance, putting many long-standing tenants in a bind. 
With a banking sector characterized by high interest 
rates, people have to borrow money from relatives and 
friends.  Often, people have been forced to move. 
 
6.  (SBU) A sales representative from a multinational 
manufacturer of household care products said the low 
purchasing power of Nigerian consumers is noticeably 
affecting company sales.  The effect is doubly 
worrisome since her company produces many basic, not 
luxury, goods.  Despite a national population of over 
120 million people, the company estimates the effective 
market size for a given product line in Nigeria is 
300,000.  This reduced market results in a profit 
margin lower than in other African countries far less 
populous than Nigeria, she said. 
 
-------------------------------- 
A Peek into the Education Sector 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) A schoolteacher in a public secondary school 
told us that he is  \"highly disappointed.\"  Salaries 
are not paid regularly.  Classrooms, laboratories, and 
other facilities are dilapidated.  Many teachers now 
supplement their salaries with other businesses, such 
as organizing extra classes for students or selling 
clothes and other items.  The teacher added that many 
students have to help contribute to their family\'s 
income.  Thus, the children work (primarily petty 
trading) in the morning and then walk to school, 
because of high transportation costs.  Understandably, 
these worker-students arrive tired and are inattentive 
in class. 
 
8.  (SBU) A retired teacher from the Oyo state service 
said retirees fare no better than employed teachers. 
She said pensioners have to be physically present to 
collect their pensions, which are usually paid two or 
three months in arrears.  She asserted that current 
teachers, understandably, lack motivation.  \"If serving 
teachers are already suffering and they see what 
retirees are going through after teaching all these 
politicians and professionals, how can anybody expect 
them to be dedicated?\" 
 
----------------------------- 
A Peek into the Health Sector 
----------------------------- 
 
9.  (U) A recently hired nurse in a private health 
center told us she now earns N15,000 ($113) monthly, 
after working at a state-owned clinic for three years, 
where she earned  N8,000 ($60) a month.  Recounting her 
experience in public service, she said the irregularity 
of salary payments caused more hardship than the low 
amount of the salary.  She and her self-employed 
electrical technician husband and two children 
practically lived on credit, hoping the government 
would pay arrears when promised. 
 
10.  (U) The nurse said the 88 percent salary increase 
has been depleted by the incessant rise in prices of 
basic goods and services.  Like most Lagosians with a 
reasonably well-paid job, she is besieged with requests 
from destitute friends and relatives.  She shared a 
remark commonly heard in Lagos: each gainfully employed 
individual supports at least twenty other people.  She 
wondered aloud how she survived on N8,000 for so long, 
when N15,000 now is insufficient. 
 
11.  (U) Regarding the provision of health care, 
patients in public hospitals usually receive bad 
service from demoralized medical personnel.  A Lagos 
FSN whose mother is hospitalized described his ordeal. 
He said relatives have to search the city to find 
prescribed drugs unavailable in the hospital pharmacy. 
Nurses refused to attend to the elderly woman\'s needs 
and advised the family to designate someone to stay 
with her at the hospital.  The FSN remarked that 
government hospitals only provide \"lodging\" for the 
sick; care and attention must come from the family.  He 
further noted that in addition to coping with the 
stress of his mother\'s illness, he has been without 
electricity for four months, and is thus relying on 
generator power, incurring even more expenses. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
Nigeria Imports What It Has; Exports What It Doesn\'t 
Have 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
12.  (SBU) A water treatment officer with the Nigerian 
ports authority (who also is owed several months\' 
salary) wondered why the country defies basic economic 
laws - \"importing what it has, and exporting what it 
lacks.\"  With vast agricultural lands, Nigeria imports 
foodstuffs like rice, she observed.  While Nigeria 
supplies the Niger Republic with electricity, Nigerians 
cannot get reliable power, she lamented.  (Note: The 
NEPA transmits electricity to the Niger Republic under 
an extended contract with Niger Electric Company.  Many 
Nigerians believe they pay more for electricity than 
consumers in the Niger Republic and that NEPA does a 
better job supplying the Niger Republic than it does 
taking care of its home base.) 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
13.  (U)  The attitude of most Nigerians toward the 
economy and their immediate economic future is gloomy. 
Fuel price increases, lack of electricity, rising food 
and consumer prices, unemployment, poor public health 
and education services, and an unfriendly housing 
market have contributed to feelings of widespread 
anxiety and fear among Lagosians about the trajectory 
of Nigeria\'s economy.  All this is occurring against a 
backdrop of historic oil prices and the accumulation of 
an unprecedented level of foreign exchange reserves. 
They shudder at what would happen if the bottom fell 
out in the oil market.  Thus, when they hear government 
officials trumpet economic reform and assert that the 
country\'s economic fundamentals are on the mend, this 
news has a hollow ring to them. 
 
14.  (U) The \"ordinary Lagosian\'s\" perspective on 
economic reform is very ambivalent.  There is universal 
support for ending rampant corruption and increasing 
transparency.  In addition, support reform initiatives, 
which they perceive as resulting in better services, 
such as telecommunications deregulation.  However, they 
are conflicted about measures that may help the country 
in the long run, but harm their personal interests in 
the short to medium term.  Downstream petroleum 
deregulation is an example.  Lagosians seemed to 
understand the sector must be deregulated in order to 
attract private investment and rehabilitate the 
country\'s oil refineries.  Yet, they bristle at 
increased fuel prices. 
 
15.  (U) In the final analysis, most Lagosians, like 
most people anywhere, will judge the efficacy of 
economic reform by how it improves their economic 
standing.  Thus far, most people believe this year has 
been a bad one economically and their glimpses into the 
future have not fueled optimism.  If the Lagosians we 
spoke to are representative of the country, support for 
the GON economic policies will continue to truncate 
unless the GON is viewed as taking steps to alleviate 
the average person\'s economic diminution.  People will 
be looking toward policies that spell job creation, 
arrest the rise in consumer prices, and bring more 
reliable electrical power generation.  Unfortunately, 
some of these goals point to economic policies that 
would be inconsistent with each other and with some 
existing economic reform measures.  If public support 
for reform is a GON objective, it will have to do a 
delicate balancing act.

Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Consul General visited Rivers and 
Bayelsa States December 8-10.  He met the Deputy Governors of 
both states (the Governors were out of Nigeria),Rivers State 
Assembly leadership, environmental and human rights 
activists, opposition leaders and researchers at Port 
Harcourt\'s leading socio-economic think tank.  The visit came 
on the heels of the December 5 occupation of Chevron and 
Shell oil companies\' facilities by agitated local 
communities.  While Port Harcourt and Yenogoa were free of 
violence, interlocutors in both capitals cited escalating 
tension in the Delta.  In their totality, the Consul 
General\'s conversations revealed the chasms separating  key 
players in the Delta, and showed the distance needed to be 
traversed before these actors can reach a modus vivendi that 
minimizes disruption of oil company activity and offers hope 
of sustained economic improvement to the local communities. 
End Summary 
 
------------------------------------------ 
RIVERS DEPUTY GOVERNOR--COMPANIES AT FAULT 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  During their December 8 meeting, Rivers State Deputy 
Governor Gabriel Toby told the Consul General that progress 
was being made between Chevron Texaco officials and local 
community representatives to resolve the disagreements 
between the company and local area that precipitated the 
occupation of the Robert-Kiri flow station on December 5th. 
Toby stated that several state officials, including the State 
Assembly\'s Deputy Speaker, were acting as mediators between 
the company and the local residents.  He mentioned that the 
active interposition of the state had lowered tensions in 
that local community, paving the way for the current 
negotiations.  He was optimistic that the talks would lead to 
a Memorandum of Understanding between Chevron and the local 
community. 
 
3. (C)  However, Toby chastised Chevron for having ignored 
warning signs of growing tension in the local community. 
Evidently, the local Chevron staff had failed to respond to 
several missives sent by the local community to Chevron\'s 
Port Harcourt office. Toby\'s criticism of Shell, which 
suffered a contemporaneous occupation of a facility, was 
harsher.  He accused local Shell management of being 
disingenuous with local residents. Shell management 
dissembled, making commitments they had little intention of 
honoring, Toby asserted.  Shell had been warned repeatedly by 
State officials about their record of broken promises on 
employment and community projects; but the company\'s 
officials thought they could continue to finesse the local 
leaders.  On the other hand, Chevron\'s local manager had not 
lied.  His omission was that he failed to take the 
community\'s agitation seriously.  Perhaps inured to  local 
agitation because he has heard so much angry rhetoric in the 
recent past, he neglected to inform the Lagos headquarters of 
the rising temperature and to make any serious attempt 
himself to defuse the tension before it erupted. 
 
4.  (C) At the crux of the matter were jobs and money.  Toby 
accused the oil companies of neglecting to hire sufficient 
indigenes of the area.  Most of the companies\' Nigerian 
workers came from other parts of the country, although many 
were employed in jobs such as boat operators or in unskilled 
positions that could have been staffed via the local 
employment pool, maintained the Deputy Governor.  However, 
mid-level management in the companies were mainly Nigerians 
from other parts of the country; they used their position in 
the company to hire their ethnic kith, to the detriment of 
the unemployed local residents.  Toby also cited the 
companies for failing to fashion the right kinds of economic 
development projects and then for inadequately funding those 
projects they did author. 
 
5. (C) The companies were their own worst enemy, Toby 
continued.  They only dealt with the local communities after 
situations boiled over.  Only after a disturbance did they 
seek state government intercession, Toby groused.  The 
companies traditionally ignored the concerns of local 
residents. Only when the residents take matters or oil 
facilities literally into their own hands do they get the 
companies\' attention.  Even then, the attention span is 
brief, he spoke.  The companies will be attentive only as 
long as it takes to sign an Memorandum of Understanding; but 
the minute the Memorandum of Understanding is signed it 
becomes a dead letter, Toby asserted.  With the crisis 
averted and local agitators seemingly placated, the companies 
revert to the mode of operation that existed prior to the 
Memorandum of Understanding.  Toby stressed that the 
companies not only failed to liaise regularly with 
appropriate state government agencies, i.e., Economic 
Development, Environmental Affairs and local government 
affairs, the companies often rebuffed state government 
attempts to establish communications outside of crisis 
situations. 
 
6. (C) Toby said the companies\' attitude caused significant 
disappointment and some rancor within the state government. 
Nevertheless, River state would always help to extricate the 
companies from these hot situations.  The State Government 
believes it has an obligation to the local communities\' 
welfare, but also it recognizes the economic importance of 
the oil companies.  The River State government\'s role in 
mediating between the companies and the communities is an 
attempt to strike a balance between conflicting positions of 
economic populism held by the local communities, and that of 
business realism which drives the companies\' behavior. 
 
7 (C) Replying to a question from the Consul General, Toby 
opined that both the Federal Government and the Niger Delta 
Development Commission (NDDC) have fallen woefully short of 
carrying their fair share of the developmental burden in the 
Delta.  The Deputy Governor stated the NDDC had just 
finalized its master plan for development in the Delta; 
however, the plan was almost dead on birth. President 
Obasanjo bristled when he discovered the plan estimated that 
most Delta inhabitants lived below the world poverty line. 
Obasanjo threatened to veto the plan.  The presidential 
threat was not lifted until the language on poverty was 
softened.  Toby pointed to this wordsmithing as an example of 
the legerdemain that Abuja seems to relish to the prejudice 
of actual progress on local development issues. 
 
8 (C)  Consul General thanked Toby and the Rivers Government 
for their swift intercession in the Robert-Kiri occupation, 
stressing the importance of bringing the parties to the table 
and of resolving these types of incidents without casualty or 
property damage. 
 
9 (C)  However, the Consul General noted that, in the long 
run, settling the community disputes via ad-hoc, individual 
MOU\'s risked creating a patchwork of localized settlements 
that could cause nearly as many problems as they solved.  A 
community will compare its compact with those reached by 
other communities and other oil companies. This could raise 
invidious comparisons and spark jealousies that degenerate 
into something worse.  Moreover the frequency of these 
disruptions and take-overs seemed to beg for a more 
comprehensive, strategic approach to the relationship between 
the local communities and the oil companies.  Toby, echoed by 
the State Commission for Information and Secretary of the 
State Government, said they would endorse such a 
comprehensive approach and hoped the NDDC would play a 
leading role in orchestrating all of the local, state, 
national and international stakeholders. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
TALKING TO THE LAW MAKERS--BLAME ABUJA 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10 (C) In a separate December 8 meeting, Speaker of the 
Rivers State Assembly, Rotimi Amaechi, labeled the federal 
government as the main cause of turmoil in the State. 
Amaechi stated that Nigeria was nominally a federal system 
but was highly centralized de facto.  Abuja siphoned off 
resources and revenues from the Delta but failed to re-invest 
in local people or communities.  The federal government was 
mostly absent from the lives of people.  Moreover, the state 
government could only offer limited resources which he 
claimed had been put to good use in power generation and some 
road construction.  But the state did not have sufficient 
funds to go around.  In this milieu, local communities come 
to see the oil companies--the only physical presence of the 
modern and monied outside world they see--as a surrogate 
government. Thus, poverty-driven frustration among the local 
population is directed at the oil companies because the 
companies are the only entity with which the people have 
immediate contact. 
 
11 (C) Amaechi predicted disruption in the Delta would 
continue until GON\'s policies changed to reflect true 
federalism i.e., greater distribution of resources to Rivers 
State.  This, according to him, will ensure that 
oil-producing areas derived adequate compensation from their 
resources.  Amaechi added that the local communities now feel 
empowered by the fact that taking over a facility may send 
ripples throughout the international oil market.  Because of 
this realization, more communities will be more apt to occupy 
facilities. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
LOCAL NGO\'S BLAST GOVERNMENT AND COMPANIES 
------------------------------------------ 
 
12. (SBU) Representatives of several Port Harcourt-based NGOs 
offered Consul General their unique perspective on the Niger 
Delta.  The majority of the NGO official participants accused 
all stakeholders (including the international community) of 
lack of genuine concern for social deterioration in the Niger 
Delta.  According to them, chronic poverty and unemployment 
remain the most significant causes of tension in the region. 
Port Harcourt remained one of Nigeria\'s fastest growing 
cities despite high unemployment there.  People from many 
parts of Southern Nigeria flocked to the city, believing the 
oil industry abounded in jobs and wealth.  The reality is 
that jobs in the industry are few.  Thus, Port Harcourt was 
now the home of pools of unemployed migrants.  Women often 
experienced the brunt of this poverty.  Forced to be family 
breadwinners, many women were compelled into prostitution, 
with their clients being the relatively small number of 
employees in the oil sector.  The NGO officials stated that 
long-standing poverty and unemployment has strained 
traditional social structures and mores. 
 
13. (SBU) The social order had become inverted.  Youth no 
longer listened to traditional elders.  Now, armed-toting 
young men held more sway within the communities than the old 
chiefs.  This shift in leadership also meant that violence, 
not negotiation, is progressively becoming the preferred mode 
of dispute resolution in the area, the activists warned. 
Spreading their analysis wider than the Delta, the activists 
deplored the existing money-dominated, violence-prone 
political process in Nigeria, alleging that it alienated the 
vast majority of their countrymen.  They identified the 
politicians\' propensity to hire and arm local youths as 
responsible for conflict in many parts of the Niger Delta. 
To achieve lasting peace, the NGO leaders urged the 
international community to support reform in Nigeria.  In 
particular, they demanded electoral reform that will allow 
political candidates and parties more representation of the 
average person to emerge.  In their opinion, the current 
political leadership in Nigeria did not represent the true 
aspirations of the people, nor did it command widespread 
legitimacy. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
OIL COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES FEEL PICKED UPON 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
14 (C) The Consul General hosted an evening dinner for Port 
Harcourt-based Chevron-Texaco and Halliburton officers 
December 8th.  Both officials stated that security in Port 
Harcourt was adequate but  tensions were on the rise in the 
outlying areas.  Notwithstanding the on-going disarment 
exercise for local militias, the officials noted a marked 
increase in armed young men in these outlying areas.  The 
company officials described a security situation where the 
militias are so influential in the creeks and rural areas 
that the writ of the Governor of River State is being reduced 
to that being the mayor of Port Harcourt: the State 
Government\'s presence does not extend very far beyond the 
capital.  The Halliburton official lamented that company 
vehicles are plastered with dozens of decals--each sticker 
evidence of payment to a score of villages and hamlets that 
impose their own road and transportation fees and taxes. 
 
------------------------ 
Bayelsa--Ijaws Are Angry 
------------------------ 
 
15. (SBU ) In Yenegoa, the Consul General met Deputy Governor 
Jonathan and the majority of the State Cabinet.  The Bayelsa 
officials treated the Consul General to a litany of 
complaints about overcentralization of governmental power in 
Abuja, which resulted in an inequitable distribution of 
resources between Bayelsa and Abuja.  Their expostulations 
had an decided ethnic timbre.  State officials claimed 
Bayelsa was the heartland of the Ijaws, purportedly Nigeria\'s 
fourth largest ethnic group.  However, the Ijaws have been 
historically marginalized as a player in national politics. 
The Bayelsa officials called for greater Ijaw influence in 
national politics and more political and economic autonomy 
for Bayelsa.  Unless these issues were addressed, unrest in 
the area would continue, sang the chorus of government 
officials.

Comment 
-------- 
 
16 (C) Port Harcourt is a teeming city, in many ways a 
smaller, equally active version of Lagos with its legendary 
traffic snarls and ominous pools of loitering, unemployed 
youth. Port Harcourt is also the political hub of the drama 
that has become the Niger Delta.  On the one level it is 
bustling; dig deeper, it exemplifies much of what is wrong in 
Nigeria.  Port Harcourt\'s economy is one-dimensional--it 
lives off oil.  The sector produces both great wealth and 
activity.  The infrastructure and presence of the oil majors 
and the related oil services companies is all around. 
Meanwhile, state and federal governments are largely 
dysfunctional.  In the functions of government, the laws of 
graft overrule the laws of gravity.  Funds do not trickle 
down to the modest segments of the population.  Among those 
in the latter category, the perception is that both 
government and the oil sector have encroached into their 
ancestral land to siphon oil without giving due compensation 
to the local population. 
17 (C) Comment cont. One key problem is the stakeholders 
mistrust each other.  Each actor clearly sees the dilemma 
from their own self-centered vantage point and is basically 
insensitive to the concerns of the others.  Consequently, 
there is a great gulf in perception.  The state government 
blames the federal government and the oil companies.  The oil 
companies blame the local communities and  federal 
government.  The local communities blame the companies.  The 
NGO\'s blame everyone, including the international community. 
The solutions the Consul General heard were simplistic and 
one-sided--\"get the other guy to do what I want.\" 
 
18 (C) Comment cont.  Against this stark background, the 
current tack of establishing individual Memorandum of 
Understandings with each agitated community is of dwindling 
effectiveness.  What is emerging is a patchwork of temporary 
truces.  These arrangements are fragile and tend not to 
withstand the test of time.  The situation begs for a more 
comprehensive approach that will begin to better define the 
permanent relationships among the oil companies, local 
communities and the different tiers of government.  More 
governmental resources need to be brought to bear as the oil 
companies cannot be forced into the position of becoming 
quasi-development agencies. Yet recent history demands that 
the companies must play an active, visible role in the 
communities.  Last, the objective of all parties must be 
economic growth, economic diversification and employment in 
the Delta.  Non-oil private sector investment is a 
fundamental but largely missing ingredient in the Delta. 
Unless there is a paradigm shift in strategy along the lines 
summarized above, conditions in the Delta will worsen, and 
more incidents that interrupt the operations of the oil 
companies will likely occur in the future.  End comment.

SUBJECT: SOUTHERN POLITICAL FIGURES TALK OF REMOVING A 
STUMBLING OBASANJO 
 
REF: A. LAGOS 2513 
 
     B. ABUJA 2075 
 
Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (S)  Based on the Consul General\'s conversations with 
several political contacts over the past few days, talk of 
\"what to do with President Obasanjo\" is widespread.  Many 
Southern political figures believe Obasanjo is not only 
unpopular and increasingly detached from sound political 
moorings, but also politically vulnerable.  A weak economy 
and a rather dispirited holiday season only added fuel to 
this uncharitable sentiment.  In the view of these political 
figures, Obasanjo\'s mishandling of his exchange of letters 
with People\'s Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman Audu Ogbeh 
epitomizes the president\'s detachment and weakness. 
 
2.  (S) Distilled to its essence, Ogbeh\'s letter delivered 
two broad messages to Obasanjo (reftels).  First, Ogbeh 
cautioned that he was beginning to see political storm clouds 
gather in such a way that reminded him of the early signs of 
trouble that presaged the downfall of the Second Republic in 
1983.  Secondly, Ogbeh observed that economic and social 
conditions in Nigeria were amiss; he urged Obasanjo to take 
steps to improve the economic lot of the average Nigerian. 
However, because of his own desire to jettison Ogbeh, 
Obasanjo chose to focus on the first message and to 
purposefully misinterpret it as a threat not a warning.  His 
critics say he ignored the second message about Nigeria\'s 
economic sickness, because he does not see the reality of the 
current situation.  While Ogbeh\'s letter was an accurate 
barometer of public opinion, Obasanjo and his minions saw it 
as such an inaccuracy that they could expect this perceived 
misstep by Ogbeh to cost him his job.  Thus, they leaked the 
letter, hoping to publicly rub Ogbeh\'s nose in it.  However, 
publication of the letter only strengthened Ogbeh\'s position 
in the public mind and thus ultimately protected his position 
within the party. 
 
3.  (S) Obasanjo also misjudged his own political standing. 
Obasanjo believed the revelations in his response letter 
would hurt Ogbeh.  Instead, they have hurt Obasanjo. 
Miscalculating his strength within the party, Obasanjo 
believed he could force Ogbeh from the PDP chairmanship.  But 
Vice President Atiku has more control of the party\'s internal 
structure than Obasanjo, and Ogbeh is aligned with Atiku. 
After weathering Obasanjo\'s blow, Ogbeh has now gone on the 
counter-offensive.  Ogbeh has called the PDP National 
Executive Committee to meet January 4 to tackle the party\'s 
current foremost issue: the 2003 election fraud in Anambra 
State.  This meeting has all the portents of another 
presidential setback--Obasanjo may be forced to jettison his 
support for Anambra businessman/heavy Chris Uba. 
 
4.  (S) The rumblings in the PDP are reflective of the angst 
making its rounds through the political elite in Lagos. 
Obasanjo\'s opponents strongly believe he intends to continue 
his presidency beyond 2007.  This belief, coupled with many 
political operatives\' assessment that Obasanjo is running the 
country poorly, has led to significant chatter about the 
possibility of removing Obasanjo from office.  A lot of this 
may be the futile chatter of opposition politicians 
chastising the person responsible for their being sidelined. 
Whenever Nigeria hits a bad patch, rumors of coups arise. 
This time, the ease and frequency with which people broach 
the subject is noteworthy. 
 
5.  (S) Perennial presidential candidate and opposition 
politician Tunji Braithwaite (strictly protect) told CG that 
even Yoruba politicians have been holding a series of 
meetings lamenting about Obasanjo\'s performance, or lack 
thereof.  He said the \"hot heads,\" the most vocal of the 
bunch, have been advocating some type of quick ouster.  Some 
endorsed encouraging the military to take over.  Braithwaite 
said the more moderate attendees wanted to explore 
impeachment proceedings using Obasanjo\'s tacit support for 
Chris Uba in the Anambra political saga as the gravamen of 
their charges.  The impeachment proponents argue that it is 
the safer approach, and would at least constrain Obasanjo\'s 
behavior while the proceedings were being conducted.  The CG 
told Braithwaite that it was a dire mistake for a civilian 
politician to advocate a military takeover.  The CG continued 
that such a move would be disastrous for Nigeria and its 
international relationships.  Whatever opposition is mounted, 
it must be done through legal, democratic channels, the CG 
stressed. 
 
6.  (S) Professor Ukande Damachi (strictly protect), a 
long-time contact and advisor to former Head of State 
Babangida, informed CG that Babangida was very worried about 
the potential for a military coup.  Damachi said Babangida 
was spending both his time and own money in trying to keep a 
lid on the military.  Babangida was not doing this for 
altruistic reasons, of course.  He has every intention of 
running in 2007 and does not want the country to fall apart 
before then, Damachi confided.  Damachi and the CG discussed 
that Obasanjo possibly could lower the political temperature 
if he took steps to resolve the Anambra crisis and to ensure 
military pensions and salaries were paid timely. 
 
7.  (S) Comment:  Obasanjo is a general and thus should know 
better than to end up facing too many battles on different 
fronts.  He has more enemies than allies and the list of the 
former appears to be growing.  Politically, he has 
overstepped and overstayed his welcome in the Anambra crisis. 
 He has let the crass antics and ambitions of Chris Uba drag 
him into an affair that never really offered much benefit. 
Now that it has become a national scandal and has escalated 
into an intra-party showdown, Anambra could become an 
Achilles heel.  Obasanjo would be wise to quickly and 
decisively estrange himself from Chris Uba.  That would be a 
key first step in what appears to be a long row of fence 
mending that he will need to do in order to put a damper on 
much of the chatter that is building against him.  End 
comment.

Classified By: Consul General Brian L. Browne per 1.4 b and d 
 
1.  (S/NF)  Summary:  During an early December visit, Abia 
State Governor Orji Kalu told Consul General his presidential 
bid is tactical.  Kalu admitted he was serving as Vice 
President Atiku\'s stalking horse to distract President 
Obasanjo, with the understanding that Kalu will emerge as 
Atiku\'s running mate.  Kalu intimated that he had 
participated in discussions with other People\'s Democratic 
Party (PDP) members, including VP Atiku, about fomenting 
civil unrest to remove Obasanjo from office prior to 2007. 
The Consul General advised Kalu that attempting to engineer 
either a coup or civil unrest would be an extreme misstep 
that could do irreparable damage to Nigeria and its 
democratic maturation. 
 
2.  (S)  Summary continued: Prominent human rights attorneys 
told the Consul General that progressive forces in southern 
Nigeria are attempting to coalesce to counter the PDP.  The 
All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) announced that Chairman 
Chekwas Okorie was being removed from his position for 
anti-party activities.  The APGA rift has been caused by lack 
of money and interference by the PDP.  Senator Musiliu 
Obanikoro left the Alliance for Democracy to join the PDP. 
The move is a major blow to Lagos State Governor Tinubu. 
Obanikoro was a member of Tinubu\'s inner circle.  End 
summary. 
 
 
KALU ADMITS HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID IS TACTICAL, WARNS OF CIVIL 
UNREST 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  (C) Abia State Governor Orji Kalu confided to Consul 
General that his presidential bid was basically a ruse.  With 
his highly publicized bid, Kalu hoped to distract Obasanjo\'s 
ire from VP Atiku and also to undermine Obasanjo\'s attempts 
to push River State Governor Peter Odili as a candidate. 
(Although from Rivers, Odili is of Igbo extraction.  Obasanjo 
hopes he can placate both the South-South and Southeast if 
Odili is either his hand-picked presidential or 
vice-presidential candidate.)  In exchange for running 
interference, Kalu said he hoped to be selected as VP Atiku\'s 
running mate.  Kalu claimed that VP Atiku retained as firm 
control of the party machinery as he did during the 2003 PDP 
convention when Atiku was the decisive figure in swinging the 
convention toward renominating Obasanjo.  If we can get to 
the party convention, Atiku is a certain winner, the 
ebullient Kalu predicted. 
 
4.  (S/NF) Kalu and others in the People\'s Democratic Party 
(PDP) believe Obasanjo has lost touch with political reality 
and is steering Nigeria toward collapse.  Kalu feared the 
country might not make it to the 2007 elections.  Moreover, 
Obasanjo is still contemplating amending the constitution to 
allow himself a third term, Kalu opined.  If Obasanjo 
continues his current bad performance or actually seeks a 
third term, Kalu warned he and other PDP members, including 
Atiku, would take extra-legal action to remove him from 
office; they would go as far as to foment civil unrest, Kalu 
suggested. 
 
5.  (S/NF) The Consul General plainly told Kalu that 
attempting to orchestrate a coup or civil unrest was the acme 
of shortsightedness.  Once such forces are unleashed you can 
no longer master them, the CG warned.  The \"solution\" that 
emerges could be more dire than the problem you attempted to 
solve. Taking such a gamble would injure Nigeria domestically 
and internationally.  Moreover, history would rue such a 
decision and would blame him for it.  If you honestly 
believed you controlled the PDP, the best tack would be to 
adhere to the rule of law and the democratic electoral 
process, the CG offered.  If Atiku believed he had the inside 
track to the presidency in 2007, the last thing he would want 
is Obasanjo to fail to make it to 2007.  Instead of 
encouraging extra-legal activity, Atiku, and by extension, 
Kalu, should be dousing such talk, explained the CG.  Their 
efforts should be focused on advocating essential political 
and economic reform so that Nigeria can be in the best shape 
possible come 2007.  If you believe victory is within reach, 
you should want Nigeria to be on the mend. You should 
safeguard not endanger the thing for which you claim to be 
fighting, the CG concluded. 
 
6.  (S/NF)  Comment:  It is no surprise Kalu and Atiku are 
working together.   However, Kalu\'s talk about civil unrest 
shows the depth of anti-Obasanjo feeling held by some members 
of the president\'s own party.  Kalu has exaggerated more than 
once in his life and his statement about extra-legal activity 
could be in this genre.  Nevertheless, we clearly signaled 
that such escapades would win no succor from our corner and 
that the electoral game was the only game in town as far as 
we were concerned.  End Comment. 
 
PROGRESSIVES ARE UNITING TO COUNTER PDP IN THE SOUTH 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.  (C)  Prominent human rights attorney Femi Falana, an 
unsuccessful 2003 Ekiti State gubernatorial candidate, told 
the Consul General that he and others from the pre-1999 human 
rights/democracy movement are working to broker a closer 
relationship among progressive forces in southern Nigeria. 
Focusing on the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in the Southwest, 
the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) in the Southeast 
(the two regionally based parties), and a handful of even 
smaller parties, they are working to counter what they view 
as the PDP\'s attempt to monopolize the country.  Lagos State 
Governor Tinubu is purportedly involved in the effort. 
 
APGA TURMOIL 
------------ 
 
8.  (C)  Because of its own internal turmoil, APGA may not be 
able to contribute much to this inter-party dialogue.  The 
week of December 13, members of the National Executive 
Committee of APGA announced Chairman Chekwas Okorie was being 
removed from his position for anti-party activities. 
Friction between Okorie and APGA\'s Anambra gubernatorial 
candidate Peter Obi seems to be a factor in the removal. 
(Note: Peter Obi was the putative winner of the 2003 Anambra 
gubernatorial election.) 
 
9.  (C) Okorie has been accused of taking money from the 
Atiku-Ngige axis in the PDP in exchange for withholding APGA 
support for Obi court case challenging the election results. 
(Chris Ngige is the current governor of Anambra.)  Meanwhile, 
Obi and Ngige nemesis Chris Uba have apparently had some 
negotiations aimed at reaching an agreement that would put 
Obi in power in Anambra and allow Uba to maintain some 
influence in the state.  As both the APGA and the PDP 
experience internal dissension, competing factions in each 
party are working with different factions from the other 
party to destroy their internal enemies.  Thus, the murky 
world of politics in Anambra gets even more sullied. 
 
SENATOR OBANIKORO MOVES FROM AD TO PDP 
-------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  Senator Musiliu Obanikoro left the AD to join the 
PDP.  The move is a major blow to Lagos State Governor 
Tinubu, the only AD governor in the country.  Obanikoro 
reportedly was a member of Tinubu\'s inner circle, and one of 
the people being considered to succeed Tinubu.  Obanikoro can 
expose many of Tinubu\'s political secrets and strategies, 
including plans to maintain AD power in Lagos and to control 
Afenifere.  Obanikoro may have valuable information on 
Tinubu\'s close relationship with Vice President Atiku and 
their plans to prepare for a possible Atiku-Tinubu ticket in 
the 2007 presidential elections.  Obanikoro\'s move is further 
indication of the PDP\'s resolve to wrest Lagos from Tinubu 
and the AD in 2007.

SUBJECT: NEAR CRASH OF CHANCHANGI AIRLINER RESURFACES 
QUESTIONS ABOUT AIR SAFETY 
 
 
LANDING GEAR FAILS TO DEPLOY; PASSENGERS SAFE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
1. (U) Forward landing gear failed to deploy on a 
Chanchangi Airlines (Nigeria) flight from Port Harcourt 
to Lagos yesterday.  According to report, the pilot of 
the Boeing 272 detected problems as as it prepared for 
landing at Murtala Mohammed International Airport 
(MMIA).  Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) 
foamed the runway to reduce friction when the nose of 
the plane skidded on the pavement, while the pilot 
dropped remaining jet fuel into the Atlantic Ocean and 
instructed the 70-75 passengers to prepare for a rough 
landing.  FAAN safety staff and firefighters were 
repositioned along the runway.  The plane landed 
roughly but safely.  No injuries were reported. 
 
LAGOS AIRPORT CLOSED FOR SEVEN HOURS; FLIGHTS DIVERTED 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
2. (U) The flight forced closure at MMIA between about 
five p.m. and midnight yesterday.  Most international 
flights were delayed and one flight to South Africa was 
cancelled.  Incoming flights were diverted to Abuja, 
other cities in Nigerian and Accra, Ghana.  The 
Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has grounded 
all Chanchangi flights for the time being.  A 
Chanchangi operations manager confirmed to us that FAAN 
inspectors, flight engineers, and safety control 
personnel are testing all Chanchangi aircraft today. 
The airline hopes to resume passenger flights tomorrow. 
and today is running test flights between Lagos and 
Kaduna with Chanchangi to check mechanical functions. 
FAAN contacts predict the airline will return to the 
skies by later this evening. 
 
KENYAN AIRLINER ALSO CATCHES FIRE 
---------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) This was the second of two incidents at MMIA on 
December 29.  Six hours earlier, firefighters were 
called to the runway to extinguish a fire in the 
landing gear of a Kenyan Airwayslines aircraft as it 
taxied to the terminal. fire emanating from its landing 
gear.  No injuries were reported. 
 
4. (U) This is the third relatively close call in 
Nigeria in recent months of which we are aware.  Four 
USG employees from AmConsulate Lagos were passengers 
aboard a Bellview Airlines flight October 31.  After 
aborting landing due to high winds, the plane narrowly 
cleared a building at the edge of the runway.  The 
plane then diverted to land on a different runway, in 
the dark with no runway lights. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: These incidents highlight the uneven 
state of Nigeria\'s domestic airlines.  The domestic 
airline sector is very active, with numerous daily 
flights between the major cities of Lagos, Abuja, and 
Port Harcourt alone.  However, the civil aviation 
inspection system is weak, and compliance with 
international maintenance standards is probably low. 
Better regulation of domestic airlines is needed now 
more than ever, given the growth in domestic air 
travel.

Shell to Re-Start Production in Kula Region 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
1.  Shell External Relations Director Don Boham confirmed to 
us on 5 January that Shell has reached an accord with the 
community in the Kula area to allow about 114,00 barrels/day 
of oil production, halted in early December 2004, to re- 
start.  Shell remains in negotiations with the community 
concerning a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). However, 
Boham noted that the community had agreed to allow 
production to begin before concluding an agreement, \"as a 
gesture of goodwill.\"  He noted that Shell is now conducting 
process checks on its facilities in Ekulama and Egbema, with 
an eye towards re-starting production within the week. 
 
Chevron Already Pumping Again in Kula 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2.  Chevron Texaco (CT) General Manager for Public and 
Government Affairs Femi Odumago confirmed CT has re-started 
production at its Robert-kiri flow station, while continuing 
to negotiate an MOU with the community that disrupted 
operations at the station in early December.  Chevron had 
reported between 10,000 and 20,000 barrels of day of 
production had been halted due to this occupation and 
detention of its workers.

Banking Reform Effort Drives Industry Change 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Since the July 6 Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) 
announcement of banking sector reforms requiring banks 
to have a 25 billion naira minimum capital base by 
December 2005, banks have been busy formulating 
strategies to meet this goal.  With the exception of 
approximately ten of the largest banks, most banks will 
have to merge with others to meet the CBN requirement. 
Investment Bank and Trade Corporation (IBTC) Head of 
Trade Finance, Oluwande Muoyo, stated that most merger 
candidates are in the partner identification phase. She 
added, given that there is only one year left to comply 
with CBN requirements, one might expect banks to be 
moving into the operational reorganization phase. 
However, to ensure safe, strong banks emerge from this 
process, management needs time for thorough due 
diligence on potential partners.  Most banks are still 
in the throes of this process. 
 
3. (U) Soon after the CBN announcement, a handful of 
banks quickly identified merger partners, and publicly 
announced their plans.  Yet rumors are beginning to 
emerge that at least one of these agreements will fall 
through in the coming months.  While banking stocks 
listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange have been heavily 
traded during the last few months, the banks\' overall 
stock prices are in decline.  Industry observers are 
still positive about the CBN directive, believing the 
changes will lead to a stronger Nigerian banking 
sector.  Yet uncertainty continues to be the word of 
the day when it comes to the banking sector in Nigeria. 
Banks formal consolidation plans were due to the CBN on 
Friday, January 7.  Post will report on the continued 
banking reform process as those plans are made publicly 
available. 
 
------------------------------- 
Power Sector Reform Bill Signed 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) On December 20, President Obasanjo signed into 
law a long-awaited power sector reform bill.  The bill, 
heralded as a major tool in rehabilitating Nigeria\'s 
ailing power sector, had been pending in the National 
Assembly since President Obasanjo\'s first term. The 
power sector reform bill is expected to create a power 
sector regulatory agency to foster and oversee an 
enabling environment for private sector participation 
in the sector. 
 
5. (U) Media reaction to the signing of the bill was 
mostly positive.  The law promises to break the 
monopoly currently enjoyed by the Nigerian Electric 
Power Authority (NEPA), the state-owned power company, 
which has utterly failed to deliver reliable 
electricity supplies.  Nigerians hope the law will pave 
the way for the entrance of experienced private sector 
power providers to deliver efficient and constant 
electricity to residencies and industries. However, it 
is not clear if Nigerians are able or willing to pay 
the higher tariffs such private sector operators are 
likely to charge. (Comment: In 2004, NEPA generated 
4,000 MW, though President Obasanjo recently said 
10,000 MW was needed to meet average national demand. 
The need for private investment in the sector to meet 
bourgeoning demand is enormous.  Details that emerge 
over the next few months regarding the new power sector 
regulatory body will play a large role in determining 
the private sector\'s willingness to invest in this now 
crippled sector.  End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Recharge Card Import Ban Target Date Extended 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (U) Telecom recharge cards can be imported into 
Nigeria until March 31, 2005, the Nigerian Ministry of 
Communications (MOC) recently announced.  An import ban 
on the cards was set to take effect January 1, 2005, 
but MOC officials moved the date back, as functioning 
local recharge card production facilities do not yet 
exist.  The MOC expects eight total production 
facilities to be operational by the March 31 deadline. 
(Comment:  We expect some recharge card production in 
Nigeria will be possible by March 31, but it is 
doubtful that sufficient high-quality production 
capability will be functional by then.  A card scarcity 
situation may arise, as it did June 2004 (reftel).  End 
comment.) 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
A Nigerian Success Story: Expanding Cassava Operations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (SBU) Chris Okeke is a partner in one of the largest 
private law firms in Nigeria; he is also the proud 
owner of 6000 hectares of cassava farms in four 
Nigerian states, including Delta and Kwara States. 
Okeke sees his agricultural philosophy as the true path 
to sustainable development in Nigeria -- based on hard 
work, investment in the land, and self-reliance.  Okeke 
has never received assistance from sources such as 
USAID or other aid agencies.  Starting with 150 
hectares of land left to him by his father, Okeke built 
two cassava processing plants.  He soon realized 
cassava supply was problematic, and has since focused 
on vertical integration, buying the land needed to 
guarantee an uninterrupted supply of cassava to his 
factories.  He is now purchasing land in Oyo State, and 
expects to fully supply his processing facilities 
within the next two to three years. 
 
8. (SBU) Okeke views numerous business problems endemic 
to Nigeria as challenges to resolve using logic.  When 
faced with numerous \"area boys\" demanding money, he has 
trained and employed them on his farms.  His goal is to 
reach profitability in the processing facilities, and 
then sell off sixty percent of farmland from which he 
sources his cassava to farmers he has trained over the 
last few years.  Okeke believes offering the farmers a 
reliable income will allow his plans to succeed, and 
this type of investment is the only way for the 
Nigerian agricultural sector to get back on its feet. 
(Comment: Okeke\'s initiative is notable, but not widely 
known.  We will periodically report on other similar 
success stories, which demonstrate Nigerian 
entrepreneurs working towards reviving the country\'s 
economy, and diversifying its revenues beyond petroleum- 
based sources. End comment.)

Power Sector Reform To Be Signed Soon? 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) President Obasanjo may soon sign a long-awaited 
power sector reform bill into law. Awaited as a major 
tool in rehabilitating Nigeria\'s ailing power sector, 
the bill had been pending in the National Assembly 
since President Obasanjo\'s first term. The power sector 
reform act will establish a power sector regulatory 
agency to foster and oversee an enabling environment 
for private sector participation in the sector. 
(Comment.  The power that will be given the new 
regulatory body will play a large role in determining 
whether private sector firms will invest in this now 
crippled sector. End comment.) 
 
5. (SBU) The law promises to break the monopoly enjoyed 
by the Nigerian Electric Power Authority (NEPA), the 
state-owned power company, which has utterly failed to 
deliver reliable electric power.  Nigerians hope the 
law will encourage private sector suppliers to deliver 
efficient and constant power to residences and business 
firms. (Comment: In 2004 NEPA generated 4,000 MW at 
peak capacity output.  President Obasanjo recently said 
10,000 MW is needed to meet average national demand. 
The need for private investment in the sector is thus 
enormous. End comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
Recharge Card Import Ban Target Date Extended 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The Nigerian Ministry of Communications (MOC) 
recently announced that rechargeable telephone calling 
cards may be imported into Nigeria until March 31, 
2005.  An import ban on the cards was set to take 
effect January 1, 2005, but MOC officials have not 
implemented the ban, as functioning local recharge card 
production facilities do not yet exist.  The MOC 
expects eight production facilities to be operational 
by the March 31 deadline.  (Comment:  We expect some 
recharge card production in Nigeria by March 31, but 
doubt that much high-quality production capability will 
be available by then.  Cards could once again be in 
short supply, as they were in June 2004 (reftel).  End 
comment.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
A Nigerian Success Story: Expanding Cassava Operations 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
7. (SBU) Chris Okeke, a partner in one of the largest 
private law firms in Nigeria, also cultivates 6000 
hectares of cassava in four Nigerian states including 
Delta and Kwara States.  Taking advantage of 150 
hectares of cassava under cultivation that his father 
had left him, Okeke built two processing plants before 
realizing that the supply of cassava was problematic. 
He has since been integrating vertically, buying land 
to ensure an uninterrupted supply of cassava to his 
factories.  He is now purchasing land in Oyo State, and 
expects to supply fully his processing facilities 
within the next two to three years. 
 
8. (SBU) Okeke considers his agricultural philosophy -- 
hard work, investment in the land, and self-reliance -- 
the underpinning of sustainable development in Nigeria. 
He views the numerous business problems as challenges 
to be resolved using logic.  A while back, for example, 
when \"area boys\" (unemployed thugs) demanded money, he 
trained and employed them on his farms.  He said he 
seeks to profit from his processing facilities, and 
then sell sixty percent of the farmland he cultivates 
to farmers he has trained over the last few years. 
Okeke said offering the farmers the prospect of a 
reliable income is the only way to revive Nigeria\'s 
agricultural sector.  (Comment: Okeke\'s initiative is 
notable, but not widely known.  We plan to report other 
success stories showing Nigerian entrepreneurs 
diversifying Nigeria\'s economy. End comment.)
