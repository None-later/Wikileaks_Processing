1.  SUMMARY:  HUN SEN\'S PRECEDENT SETTING VISIT TO 
BANGKOK REVEALED NO NEW PRK FLEXIBILITY ON THE KEY 
ASPECTS OF AN INTERNAL SETTLEMENT.  HE REMAINS OPPOSED TO 
AND INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCE AND TO SIHANOUK\'S 
PROPOSALS.  IN THEIR DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM, THE THAI 
APPARENTLY FOCUSED ON THE EXTERNAL ASPECTS OF A 
SETTLEMENT (AND BUISNESS DEALS) AFTER BEING REBUFFED WHEN 
THEY RAISED THE INTERNAL ISSUES.  THEY ARE REPORTEDLY 
READY TO CARRY ON REGULAR CONSULTATIONS WITH HUN SEN AND 
TO HOST FOUR PARTY KHMER TALKS AFTER JIM 2.  END SUMMARY 
 
------- 
ARRIVAL 
------- 
 
2.  PRK PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN ARRIVED HERE YESTERDAY 
MORNING ON A SPECIAL THAI AIR FORCE FLIGHT FROM 
VIENTIANE.  HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A 22-MEMBER ENTOURAGE 
INCLUDING:  HIS WIFE; GENERAL TIE BANH, VICE CHAIRMAN OF 
THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS AND DEFENSE MINISTER; KONG 
SAM-OL, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS; DIT 
MUNTI, FIRST DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS; CHAM

MINISTERS; AND LONG KEM, PRK AMBASSADOR TO LAOS. 
 
3.  HUN SEN WAS ESCORTED ON THE FLIGHT FROM VIENTIANE BY 
TWO OF PRIME MINISTER CHATCHAI\'S ADVISERS -- M.R. 
SUKHUMPHAN BORIPHAT AND DR. SURAKIAT SATHIRATHAI.  ON 
ARRIVAL HE WAS GREETED AT THE AIRPORT BY PM\'S OFFICE 
MINISTER ANUWAT WATTANAPONGSIRI.  THE PM\'S SON, KRAISAK, 
AND THE HEAD OF HIS PRIVATE ADVISORY GROUP, PHANSAK 
WINYARAT WERE ON HAND TO GREET HIM ON ARRIVAL AT THE 
HYATT CENTRAL PLAZA HOTEL. 
 
---------------- 
PRESS CONFERENCE 
---------------- 
 
4.  AFTER LUNCH, HUN SEN GAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AT WHICH 
HE ACCUSED THE THREE RESISTANCE FACTIONS OF BEING 
INFLEXIBLE AND REITERATED HIS DETERMINATION TO PREVENT 
POL POT FROM COMMING BACK.  HE ALSO CONDITIONED HIS 
SUPPORT FOR A SEPTEMBER WITHDRAWAL OF THE VIETNAMESE 
FORCES ON A \"POLITICAL SOLUTION\" BEING \"ATTAINED,\" 
INCLUDING CESSATION OF INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE 
THREE KHMER RESISTANCE GROUPS.  HE DID, HOWEVER, OFFER 
THAT THE PRK WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN INTERNATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE CUT OFF AT THE SAME TIME AS THE OTHER FACTIONS. 
 
5.  HUN SEN ENDORSED AN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL COMMISSION 
TO VERIFY THE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL, TO OVERSEE THE 
CESSATION OF AID AND TO \"MONITOR\" THE GENERAL ELECTION. 
HOWEVER, HE REJECTED AN INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
ARGUING THAT \"WE PEOPLE CAN PROTECT OUR OWN PEACE IF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY STOPS SUPPORTING POL POT.  IF 
FOREIGN COUNTRIES STOP SUPPORTING POL POT, I CAN 
GUARANTEE HE CAN NOT RETURN TO POWER IN KAMPUCHEA.\" 
 
6.  HUN SEN ALSO SAID THAT THE PRK HAD ALREADY RELEASED, 
FOR HUMANITARIAN REASONS, MORE THAN 200 THAI CAPTURED IN 
CAMBODIA AND THAT ANOTHER 300 WOULD SOON BE RELEASED. 
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE WERE ALLEGEDLY FORTUNE-HUNTERS 
DIGGING GEMSTONES IN WESTERN CAMBODIA. 
 
7.  ON REFUGEE ISSUES, HE SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY SIGNED 
AN AGREEMENT WITH THE UNITED NATION HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR 
REFUGEES ON \"PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES\" FOR REPATRIATING 
REFUGEES.   HE ANTICIPATED DISCUSSING THIS PROBLEM WITH 
PM CHATCHAI.  \"WE ARE WILLING TO WELCOME REFUGEES WHO 
WANT TO GO HOME, IF THAILAND COOPERATES AND AN AGREEMENT 
IS REACHED.\" 
 
------------------------- 
MEETING AT PM\'S RESIDENCE 
------------------------- 
 
8.  FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE, HUN SEN PROCEEDED IN 
THE LATE AFTERNOON TO THE PM\'S RESIDENCE FOR TWO HOURS OF 
TALKS.  GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN SUWIT YOTMANI SAID THAT THE 
TALKS, WHICH WERE \"FRANK AND FRIENDLY,\" INCLUDED FM 
SITTHI, RTA CINC GENERAL CHAWALIT AND PM\'S SECRETARY 
GENERAL PANYA SINGSAKDA.  ALSO PARTICIPATING FROM THE MFA 
WERE PERMSEC KASEM, POLITICO-MILITARY COORDINATOR LT GEN 
CHARAN, POLITICAL DEPARTMENT DG THEP, AND AMBASSADOR AT

DEPUTY CINC GENERAL WANCHAI, RTA CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL 
CHARUAY AND SUPREME COMMAND CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL SUNTHON. 
 
9.  FM SITTHI REPORTEDLY LEFT THE MEETING ONE HOUR BEFORE 
IT ADJOURNED, AND HE DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE 
SUBSEQUENT DINNER CRUISE. 
 
10.  REPORTS OF WHAT TRANSPIRED IN THE MEETING ARE 
SKETCHY, BUT ACCORDING TO \"THE NATION,\" THERE WERE SOME 
TENSIONS WHEN THAI DELEGATES RAISED THE ISSUE OF THE 
\"MODALITY\" OF CONSTITUTING A RECONCILIATION GOVERNMENT. 
HUN SEN BRIDLED AT THIS, ARGUING IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR 
THE FOUR CAMBODIAN FACTIONS TO DISCUSS.  CHATCHAI 
REPORTEDLY DROPPED THE SUBJECT, AND THE TALKS CONTINUED 
IN A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE.  FM SITTHI HAD SAID EARLIER 
THAT THE THAI WOULD NOT \"BARGAIN\" WITH HUN SEN (OVER 
INTERNAL ISSUES), BECAUSE \"WE ARE NOT KHMERS.\"  IN THE 
SAME VEIN, GENERAL CHAWALIT SAID THAT THAILAND WILL LEAVE 
THE KHMER FACTIONS TO RESOLVE THEIR INTERNAL CONFLICT. 
BUT HE ADDED THAT THAILAND HAD TO INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE 
PEACE PROCESS WHICH MAY STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. 
 
11.  ONE SOURCE SITED IN \"THE NATION\" CLAIMED THAT BOTH 
SIDES HAD AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO THE GRADUAL REDUCTION OF 
EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE RIVAL KHMER FACTIONS WHILE THE 
VIETNAMESE TROOPS ARE WITHDRAWN.  BOTH PROCESSES WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY AN INTERNATIONAL MECHANISM YET 
TO BE ESTABLISHED.  OTHER \"NATION\" SOURCES, HOWEVER, WERE 
\"MORE CAUTIOUS\" AND SAID ONLY THAT HUN SEN HAD NOT 
SOFTENED HIS POSITIONS. 
 
12.  HUN SEN REPORTEDLY PROPOSED REGULAR CONSULTATIONS 
BETWEEN THE RTG AND PHNOM PENH.  ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT 
SPOKESMAN SUWIT, PM CHATCHAI AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL. 
THE GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN ALSO SAID THAT PM CHATCHAI \"WILL 
TRY TO DO WHATEVER HE COULD\" WITH REGARD TO HUN SEN\'S 
SUGGESTION THAT THAILAND HOST FOUR-PARTY KHMER PEACE 
TALKS.  HOWEVER, IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER JIM 2 IN 
JAKARTA IN FEBRUARY. 
 
13.  THAI ARMY TEVEVISION COVERAGE HAD HUN SEN SAYING 
THAT HE WOULD NOT ACCEPT SIHANOUK\'S PROPOSALS DEALING 
WITH A JOINT ARMY AND GENERAL ELECTIONS.  HE INSISTED 
THAT THE PRK MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO UNTIL AN ELECTION IS 
HELD TO DETERMINE WHO WOULD GOVERN THE COUNTRY. 
 
14.  ONE BANGKOK POST SOURCE SAID THAT HUN SEN REITERATED 
MANY OF THE POINTS HE MADE IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT 
HE ALSO DISCUSSED THE OPENING OF TRADE LINKS WITH 
THAILAND.  HUN SEN SAID THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD DO 
BUSINESS IN FISHING, LOGGING AND GEMS, RESOURCES WHICH 
REMAIN PLENTIFUL IN THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY.  ACCORDING TO 
ONE ACCOUNT, KONG SAM-OL, HUN SEN\'S VICE PRIME MINISTER, 
WAS TO HOLD TALKS WITH SENIOR THAI OFFICALS ON WAYS TO 
DEVELOP TRADE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

---------- 
OPEN ENDED 
---------- 
 
15.  PM CHATCHAI AND HUN SEN CONTINUED THEIR TALKS AT A 
WORKING BREAKFAST TODAY AT HUN SEN\'S HOTEL BEFORE

REPORT, THE PM\'S ADVISORS MAY HAVE PERSUADED HUN SEN TO 
EXTEND HIS VISIT AN ADDITIONAL DAY AND TO LEAVE FOR PHNOM 
PENH TOMORROW, AND ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE THAT HE COULD SO 
EXTEND HIS VISIT IF HE WISHED.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
3.(S) ON 27 MARCH, MFA DIVISION I (INDOCHINA) DIRECTOR 
NOPADOL GUNAVIBOOL BRIEFED POLOFF ON DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER 
SUKHUMBHAND\'S 24 MARCH MEETING WITH CAMBODIAN DEFENSE 
MINISTER TEA BANH AND MINISTER OF STATE SOK AN.  NOPADOL 
DESCRIBED THAI AND CAMBODIAN VIEWS ON THE CEASE-FIRE IN 
NORTHWESTERN CAMBODIA, AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS, AND 
THE JULY 26 ELECTIONS.  HE SAID HUN SEN WOULD VISIT THAILAND 
IN EARLY MAY.  NOPADOL ALSO DESCRIBED THE SCHEDULE FOR THE 
UPCOMING FRIENDS OF CAMBODIA (FOC) MEETING, AND HE STRESSED 
THAI SENSITIVITY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DETENTION OF KHMER ROUGE 
LEADERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
4.(C) THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF NOPADOL\'S BRIEFING WAS TO 
DISCUSS SUKHUMBHAND\'S MEETING WITH TEA BANH.  NOPADOL 
DESCRIBED THE 90-MINUTE SUKHUMBHAND-TEA BANH MEETING AS 
\"RESTRICTED,\" ATTENDED ONLY BY CPP MINISTER OF STATE SOK AN, 
THAI MFA PERMANENT SECRETARY SAROJ CHAVANAVIRAJ, AND THAI 
AMBASSADOR TO CAMBODIA DOMDEJ BUNNAG.  PRESENT AT NOPADOL\'S 
BRIEFING WERE POLOFF AND EMBOFFS FROM AUSTRALIA, GERMANY, 
NEW ZEALAND, AND SINGAPORE.  NOPADOL\'S COMMENTS SUPPLEMENT 
THE READ-OUT PROVIDED BY SUKHUMBHAND TO THE DCM (REF A). 
 
TIMING OF HUN SEN\'S VISIT 
------------------------- 
 
5.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF TEA BANH\'S 
VISIT WAS TO PREPARE FOR HUN SEN\'S TRIP TO BANGKOK, WHICH 
WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY.  THE RTG HAD 
REQUESTED AN EARLIER DATE, BUT HUN SEN WOULD CONTINUE TO BE 
IN MOURNING FOR THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER UNTIL THE END OF 
APRIL. 
 
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
6.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SOK AN HAD CONFIRMED THAT THE 
CAMBODIAN ELECTORAL LAW\'S RESIDENCY PROVISIONS (AN OBSTACLE 
TO RANARIDDH\'S PARTICIPATION) WOULD BE AMENDED BY THE 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY BY 26 MARCH.  NOPADOL NOTED THAT THIS HAD 
NOT YET OCCURRED AS PROMISED.  HE SAID THE CAMBODIANS HAD 
ALSO SAID THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WOULD: 
 
- FACILITATE THE WORK OF THE NATIONAL ELECTION COMMITTEE 
(NEC); 
 
- ALLOW FUNCINPEC MEMBERS AND OTHER CAMBODIANS ABROAD TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION; 
 
- DROP THE PROVISION REQUIRING CANDIDATES TO PRODUCE VOTER 
CARDS WHEN REGISTERING THEIR CANDIDACIES;  AND 
 
- REDUCE THE PARTY REGISTRATION DEADLINE FROM 120 DAYS 
BEFORE THE ELECTION TO 80 DAYS. 
 
CONTRACTING ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE 
-------------------------------- 
 
7.(C) NOPADOL SAID SOK AN HAD COMMENTED ON THE RGC\'S 
CONTRACT WITH THE CICCONE FIRM FOR ELECTORAL MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEMS.  SOK AN HAD SAID THAT THE CONTRACT WAS NOT INTENDED 
TO OBVIATE THE NEED FOR FOREIGN AID, BUT THE RGC NEEDED A 
BACK-UP SERVICE-PROVIDER IN CASE AID WAS NOT FORTHCOMING. 
ON 25 MARCH, THE THAIS RELAYED THIS STATEMENT TO PRINCE 
RANARIDDH, WHO RHETORICALLY ASKED WHAT WOULD PROMPT THE RGC 
TO DOUBT THAT AID WOULD BE FORTHCOMING, GIVEN THAT VARIOUS 
GOVERNMENTS HAD ALREADY SIGNED AID AGREEMENTS.  RANARIDDH 
ALSO DENOUNCED CAMBODIAN INTERIOR MINISTER SAR KHENG\'S 
STATEMENT THAT HE HAD BEEN UNAWARE OF THE CONTRACT WITH 
CICCONE. 
 
8.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE RTG FELT THAT THE CONTRACT HAD 
MOST LIKELY BEEN SEEN BY THE CPP AS A WAY TO PRESSURE DONORS 
TO RELEASE MONEY, BUT HE WITHHELD FURTHER JUDGMENT AS HE HAD 
NOT YET SEEN THE CONTRACT AND HE BELIEVED THE RGC DID INDEED 
REQUIRE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE ELECTIONS. 
 
THAI ELECTORAL ASSISTANCE 
------------------------- 
 
9.(C) IN THE 24 MARCH MEETING, SAROJ HAD SAID THAT THE ASEAN 
COUNTRIES, IN THE MIDST OF THEIR ECONOMIC CRISIS, WOULD BE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE RGC WITH TECHNICAL BUT NOT FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE.  SUCH ASSISTANCE WOULD MOST LIKELY BE ORGANIZED 
ON A BILATERAL BASIS AND INVOLVE THE TRAINING OF PERSONNEL, 
BUT NOPADOL STRESSED THAT THE RGC HAD NOT YET INDICATED WHAT 
TYPE OF ASSISTANCE IT REQUIRED.  SOK AN REPORTEDLY SAID HE 
WOULD CONSULT WITH HUN SEN REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF 
INVITATIONS TO ASEAN TO SEND ELECTION OBSERVERS AND 
REGARDING CONSULTATION WITH THE NEC TO DETERMINE WHAT SORT 
OF ASSISTANCE WOULD BE REQUIRED.  NOPADOL ESTIMATED THAT 
THAILAND MIGHT PROVIDE 10 ELECTION OBSERVERS, WITH ALL OF 
ASEAN PROVIDING 75 OF THE ANTICIPATED TOTAL OF 300-350. 
 
CEASE-FIRE TALKS 
---------------- 
 
10.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND HAD STRESSED THAT THE 
FOUR PILLARS OF THE JAPANESE PEACE PLAN COULD PROCEED 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, E.G. RANARIDDH COULD RETURN BEFORE FULL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CEASE-FIRE AND TROOP REINTEGRATION. 
SUKHUMBHAND HAD URGED TEA BANH TO ONCE AGAIN DISPATCH 
GENERALS TO MEET WITH FUNCINPEC ARMED RESISTANCE COMMANDER 
LTG NHEK BUN CHHAY, AND HE (SUKHUMBHAND) SAID THE RTG WAS 
\"READY TO FACILITATE THESE TALKS.\"  TEA BANH AGREED THAT IT 
WAS IMPORTANT TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE CEASE-FIRE IN ORDER 
THAT DISPLACED PERSONS COULD RETURN TO CAMBODIA AND 
RANARIDDH WOULD NOT BE DISQUALIFIED FROM RUNNING IN THE 
ELECTION ON THE BASIS OF FUNCINPEC CONTROLLING ITS OWN ARMED 
FORCES. 
 
11.(C) WHEN THE RTG RELAYED TEA BANH\'S COMMENT TO RANARIDDH, 
THE PRINCE REPLIED THAT THE RESISTANCE FORCES IN QUESTION 
WERE RCAF SOLDIERS (LOYAL TO BUT NOT ORGANIZATIONALLY 
MEMBERS OF FUNCINPEC) UNDER THE COMMAND OF RCAF GENERALS 
APPOINTED BY THE KING.  RANARIDDH THEN UNDERMINED HIS OWN 
ARGUMENT (ABOUT CONTROL OVER RESISTANCE FORCES) BY POINTING 
OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO ORDER A UNILATERAL CEASE- 
FIRE. 
 
AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS 
-------------------------------- 
 
12.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND HAD ASKED IF HUN SEN 
WOULD OBJECT TO AMNESTY FOR FUNCINPEC COMMANDERS NHEK BUN 
CHHAY AND SEREY KOSAL.  SOK AN REPLIED THAT HE HAD NOT 
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT MATTER, BUT, IN A SUBSEQUENT LUNCH 
MEETING, TEA BANH SAID HE FORESAW NO DIFFICULTY WITH 
AMNESTY.  (NOTE: IT APPEARS AS OF 30 MARCH THAT THE KING HAS 
DECLINED TO GRANT AMNESTY GIVEN OBJECTIONS RAISED BY HUN 
SEN.  END NOTE.) 
 
SUKHUMBHAND NOT TO ACCOMPANY RANARIDDH 
-------------------------------------- 
 
13.(C) AFTER CONCLUDING HIS DISCUSSION OF THE TEA BANH 
MEETING, NOPADOL SAID THAT SUKHUMBHAND WOULD NOT ACCOMPANY 
RANARIDDH BACK TO CAMBODIA ON 30 MARCH.  HE SAID THAT 
SUKHUMBHAND HAD MADE HIS INITIAL OFFER DURING A TIME WHEN 
RANARIDDH\'S AMNESTY WAS UNCERTAIN, AND THE PRINCE APPEARED 
TO FACE ARREST UPON RETURN. 
 
SCHEDULE FOR THE 19 APRIL FOC MEETING 
------------------------------------- 
 
14.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT THE 19 APRIL FOC MEETING WOULD 
FOLLOW THE SCHEDULE OF THE GROUP\'S LAST GATHERING IN MANILA. 
HE SAID INDONESIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ALATAS WOULD ARRIVE IN 
THE AFTERNOON OF 18 APRIL, IN TIME FOR A TROIKA MEETING THAT 
EVENING.  THE FOC MEETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THE REGENT 
HOTEL ON THE MORNING OF 19 APRIL AND END AROUND 1330 HRS, 
FOLLOWED BY A TROIKA PRESS CONFERENCE THAT AFTERNOON. 
(NOTE: IT APPEARS THAT A/S ROTH WOULD NEED TO DEPART NO 
LATER THAN 1345 HRS IN ORDER TO CATCH A 1515 HRS FLIGHT. 
END NOTE.) 
 
15.(C) NOPADOL SAID THAT WHILE THAILAND WOULD BE HOSTING THE 
MEETING, THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT WOULD ONCE AGAIN CHAIR IT 
(AND, ACCORDINGLY, INVITATIONS WOULD BE SENT OUT BY 
PHILIPPINE EMBASSIES).  HE SAID THE MFA HAD MADE A BLOCK 
BOOKING AT THE REGENT AND REQUESTED TO BE INFORMED OF EACH 
GOVERNMENT\'S PARTICIPANTS SOONEST.  HE NOTED THAT THE 6 
MARCH FOC COMMUNIQUE HAD CALLED FOR THE 19 APRIL MEETING TO 
TAKE PLACE AT A \"HIGH LEVEL,\" AND HE SEEMED SURPRISED THAT 
MOST EMBOFFS BELIEVED THEY WOULD BE REPRESENTED AT THE SAME 
LEVEL AS IN PREVIOUS FOC MEETINGS.  (NOTE: THE GOJ WILL 
REPORTEDLY BE REPRESENTED BY VICE FOREIGN MINISTER KOMURA. 
END NOTE.) 
 
THE KHMER ROUGE 
--------------- 
 
16.(S) AFTER THE GROUP MEETING, POLOFF AND NOPADOL PRIVATELY 
DISCUSSED REPORTS OF LARGE-SCALE KHMER ROUGE DEFECTIONS. 
NOPADOL SAID THAT HE BELIEVED THE FIGHTING HAD ENDED BY THE 
AFTERNOON OF 27 MARCH AND THAT THE KHMER ROUGE LEADERS WOULD 
NOT NEED TO CROSS INTO THAILAND.  HE SAID THAT HE DOUBTED 
THE RGC CONTROLLED ANLONG VENG, AND HE ADDED THAT HE HAD 
HEARD THE SPLIT WITHIN THE KHMER ROUGE HAD ORIGINATED OVER 
LOGGING (NFI).  PER REF B, POLOFF STRESSED THE USG INTEREST 
IN SEEING THE KHMER ROUGE LEADERS DETAINED UNTIL THEY COULD 
BE TRIED IN AN APPROPRIATE VENUE.  (NOTE: AS REPORTED IN REF 
C, THE DCM HAD ON THE SAME DAY CONVEYED OUR CONCERN TO 
SUKHUMBHAND.  END NOTE.)  NOPADOL RESPONDED THAT IT WOULD BE 
IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE DETENTION OF K.R. LEADERS SECRET WHILE 
THEY REMAINED IN THAILAND AND THAT THE RTG WOULD WANT THEM 
MOVED OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
 
17.(S) BASED ON REF D, POLOFF SPOKE TO NOPADOL ON 30 MARCH 
TO REASSURE HIM THAT THE USG WAS EXPLORING (WITH VARYING 
DEGREES OF FORMALITY) THE OPTION OF KHMER ROUGE TRIALS IN 
SEVERAL COUNTRIES.  NOPADOL SAID THAT HE HAD CHECKED WITH 
HIS MILITARY SOURCES AND, TO THE BEST OF HIS KNOWLEDGE, THE 
KHMER ROUGE LEADERS WERE STILL IN CAMBODIA. 
 
ACTION REQUESTED 
---------------- 
 
18.(U) PLEASE ADVISE SOONEST OF U.S. ATTENDEES AT THE 19 
APRIL FOC MEETING AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOTEL ROOMS 
REQUIRED.  UNLESS OTHERWISE ADVISED, WE WILL PLAN ON U.S. 
ATTENDEES STAYING AT THE REGENT AS PART OF THE THAI BLOCK 
BOOKING.

Classified By: DCM ALEXANDER A. ARVIZU.  REASON 1.4 (D). 
 
1.  (C)  SUMMARY/COMMENT:  In an effort to gage the current 
situation in Thailand\'s south, Bangkok PolOffs recently 
completed an extended trip through Narathiwat, Pattani, and 
Yala provinces, meeting with a cross-section of interlocutors 
including local Islamic groups, security officials, 
academics, journalists, and businessmen.  The visit focused 
on three main themes: security; education; and local 
sentiments.  On security, we heard a wide range of 
assessments of the situation in southern Thailand, from Thai 
security officials who claimed it was improving, to local 
businessmen who predicted worse to come.  Education was a 
major theme in all our meetings.  Many locals are upset over 
Royal Thai Government interference in Islamic \"pondok\" 
schools and the general lack of educational opportunities; 
the government remains concerned over the pondoks\' role in 
the violence.  Local Muslims uniformly expressed frustration 
and anger over perceived historical \"injustices\" that 
continue, in their minds, to be perpetrated by the police and 
military.  Local anger continues to be directed at symbols of 
the Thai central government, especially the police.  We did 
not detect strong or overt anti-U.S. sentiment.  END 
SUMMARY/COMMENT. 
 
2.  (C)  Bangkok PolOffs traveled to Thailand\'s southernmost, 
Muslim majority provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala 
from September 7th - 9th.  In Narathiwat province, PolOffs 
met with the leader of the Provincial Islamic Council, Abdul 
Rahman Samad; Deputy Provincial Police Commander Col. 
Krachang Suwannarat; and with local business leaders from the 
Narathiwat Industry Council.  In Pattani, PolOffs met with 
Dr. Phirayot Rahimmula and Dr. Chidchanok Rahimmula from 
Prince of Songkhla University; local Army Commander Col. 
Yotchai Yangyuen; prominent journalist Paret Lohasan; and 
local businessman Anusat Suwanmongkon.  In Yala PolOffs met 
with Dr. Ismail Lufti Japagiya, Rector of Yala Islamic 
College, and with leaders of the Young Muslim Association of 
Thailand. 
 
APPEARANCES 
----------- 
 
3.  (C)  Traveling through Thailand\'s southernmost, Muslim 
majority provinces is surprisingly easy.  There is a 
deceptive calm for a region that is supposed to be under 
selective martial law.  The atmosphere has the outward 
appearance of normality as people go about their business, 
and security forces maintain a lax approach. The roads are 
excellent, and the roadblocks set up by Thai security forces 
go mostly unmanned during the day.  There are large numbers 
of people on the streets, and businesses are open.  People in 
public reacted generally positively when our obviously 
foreign group passed by.  Even at the Krue Se Mosque, the 
center of fighting during the attacks of April 28, locals 
seemed pleased to see a group of \"tourists,\" complaining that 
the tourists who used to visit from Malaysia and Singapore no 
longer came. 
 
SECURITY SITUATION 
------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  Despite almost daily incidents of violence directed 
against symbols of Thai authority, local Thai security 
officials presented generally optimistic assessments of the 
violence.  Narathiwat\'s deputy Police Commander, Col. 
Krachang Suwannarat, characterized the ongoing violence as 
directly related to the activities of separatist groups. 
Col. Krachang said that local students who had studied 
abroad, specifically those who had studied in Indonesia, had 
been radicalized, and were returning to commit violence. 
However, Krachang felt that the situation in the south was 
improving.  He said recent arrests of pondok teachers 
involved in recruiting students to commit violence had 
disrupted separatist activity.  (Note:  While insisting that 
the situation was improving, Krachang did admit that the 
technology and sophistication of the attackers was continuing 
to improve.  During our conversation, Krachang casually 
showed PolOffs a cell phone detonator that he said had been 
removed from a diffused bomb, noting that bomb technology had 
improved.  End Note) 
 
5.  (C)  Col. Yotchai Yangyuen, Commander of the Pattani Army 
Circle, also put a positive spin on this year\'s increase in 
violence, claiming that recent attacks were in the \"normal 
pattern.\"  Yotchai said army efforts to stop the violence are 
being hampered by inexperienced soldiers, and by the 
difficulty of getting information from locals unwilling to 
cooperate with uniformed security forces. 
 
6.  (C)  The feelings of local business leaders over the 
security situation was mixed.  Chinese-Thai Pattani 
businessman Anusat Suwanmongkon, owner of the CS Pattani 
hotel, gave an optimistic assessment of the security 
situation, blaming the sensationalist Bangkok media for 
exaggerating reports of violence in the south.  Anusat 
highlighted his personal good relationships with his Muslim 
neighbors and employees.  A much more grim outlook was 
provided by members of the Narathiwat Industrial Council. 
Also ethnically Chinese, they felt increasingly threatened by 
their Muslim-Malay neighbors.  They noted that local 
Chinese-Thai businessmen were usually armed and probably 
would leave if the situation continued to deteriorate. 
 
EDUCATION - THE CENTRAL ISSUE? 
------------------------------ 
 
7.  (C)  Local Muslims remain extremely sensitive to outside 
interference with their traditional religious schools, but 
showed strong interest in broadening educational 
opportunities for their community.  Dr. Lutfi Japagiya, the 
controversial Rector of the Yala Islamic College, said that 
he hoped his rapidly expanding Pattani campus would be able 
to offer greater opportunities for local Muslims.  Japagiya 
readily admitted that his school received large donations 
from foreign sources, but said he was forced to accept 
international donations because of lack of funding from the 
Thai government.  Sounding a conciliatory tone, Japagiya said 
his role as an educator was to provide educational 
opportunities for his students.  To do that, Japagiya hopes 
to expand his college to 10,000 Muslim students, including 
1,000 foreign students, and teach them subjects beyond Islam, 
including IT, economics, Chinese, and English.  He said he 
wanted to teach his students who believe that non-Muslims are 
the enemy that this is not the case. 
 
8.  (C)  Abdul Samad, in his capacity as Chairman of the 
Narathiwat Islamic Council, oversees pondok schools in the 
province.  He claimed that local pondoks were not being used 
to distribute separatist literature or indoctrinate students. 
 He said that local youths were instead being \"brainwashed\" 
by outsiders.  Samad said the NIC held regular training 
programs for provincial religious teachers to prevent 
extremist teachings.  Like Japagiya, Samad hopes that a 
planned Islamic university for southern Thailand -- which he

prepare his students for a \"globalized\" world, by teaching 
them English and Chinese, in addition to Islamic studies. 
Samad was very moderate in tone and went out of his way to 
praise the U.S. tradition of religious freedom.  (Note: 
Samad invited PolOffs to view an ongoing training session for 
pondok teachers at the central Mosque.  PolOffs visited the 
training session and observed 200  teachers, male and female, 
participating in a \"brainstorming\" activity on how to improve 
education in the pondoks.  The group received PolOffs 
politely.  End Note.) 
 
\"INJUSTICES\" - WHAT DOES THE POPULATION REALLY WANT? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
9.  (C)  The consensus among our interlocutors was that most 
southern Thai Muslims do not necessarily want a separate 
state, but rather an end to the historical injustices they 
attribute to government authorities.  In some conversations, 
local Muslims blamed the Bangkok-based media for exaggerating 
the level of violence in southern Thailand, and asserting 
that many incidents were separatist related (Ref C), when in 
reality many are related to local business or personal 
conflicts.  Many Muslims complained   that heavy-handed 
police tactics were contributing to local resentment towards 
security forces. 
 
10.  (C)  According to Professor Perayot Rahimmula of Prince 
of Songkhla University in Pattani, the RTG exaggerates the 
threat of separatism.  Most southerners only want security, 
three meals a day, and the opportunity to send their children 
to school, he asserted.  Pirayot called the problem \"a local 
issue,\" and denied a link to international terrorism.  The 
professor commented that the youths who participated in the 
28 April attacks against government targets had been 
manipulated into believing they were carrying out a religious 
jihad as expounded in the \"Jihad in Pattani\" booklets some 
carried.  In general, he felt that police brutality and 
insensitivity towards Muslims, and not separatism, was the 
key contributing factor for the worsening violence. 
 
11.  (C)  Pattani based journalist Paret Lohasan, who works 
for large, Bangkok-based outlets, agreed that the local 
population is not really interested in separatism, but is 
vulnerable to manipulation by separatists who exploit 
grievances stemming from everyday poor treatment at the hands 
of security forces and civilian officials. 
 
12.  (C)  PolOffs met with a several members of the Young 
Muslims Association (YMA) of Thailand in Yala.  Comparing 
this year\'s unrest to the historical separatist movement, 
they noted that the significance of religion was a new 
element when compared to separatist movements of the past. 
They claimed the public was more supportive of previous 
movements that based claims of autonomy of historical and 
cultural grounds, rather than for religious reasons.  Members 
also said that the youths behind the 28 April  attacks had 
been misled by poor religious teachings, a belief that black 
magic would protect them, and a sense they were part of a 
jihad.  The YMA members are angry over Thai security forces 
raids of mosques and pondok schools, and suspicious over U.S. 
intentions in the region.  They asked PolOffs about rumors 
that circulate in the South that the USG is inciting the 
violence for its own ends, and politely listened to denials. 
 
13.  (C)  COMMENT:  In our assessment, the problem of 
Thailand\'s \"south\" is localized in the southernmost, Muslim 
majority provinces.  The good infrastructure, clean streets, 
and large numbers of people going about their business might 
be deceptive given the many violent attacks that have 
occurred this year, but they do provide important context 
when measuring the scope of this problem.  Southern Thailand 
is not burning. 
 
14.  (C)  In our series of meetings we heard two common 
themes over and over from local Muslims: concerns about 
education; and a strong local feeling of \"injustice.\"  Our 
Muslim interlocutors tend to blame the government and 
\"outsiders\" for southern problems, without exhibiting much 
willingness to assume responsibility for promoting 
non-violent solutions to grievances, however legitimate. 
 
15.  (C)  COMMENT:  Embassy believes that expanded public 
diplomacy efforts, focused on education/skills training, 
would be welcomed by a large part of the population. 
Bilateral security assistance focused on expanding the 
coordination and analytical ability of Thai security forces 
should also remain a priority for the USG.  However, 
uniformed Thai officials and other manifestations of the Thai 
central government presence are deeply resented by much of 
the southern population.  Accordingly, U.S. assistance to 
Thai law enforcement and security officials in the south 
should be kept as low-key as possible.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: THAILAND:  PM THAKSIN KICKS OFF HIS RE-ELECTION 
CAMPAIGN WITH PROMISES APLENTY 
 
REF: (A) BANGKOK 7186 (B) BANGKOK 6995 
 
 1.  (U)  Summary.  In a live nationally-televised Bangkok 
rally on October 17, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 
officially opened his run for re-election with a flurry of 
\"populist\" promises to the Thai voters.  From job training 
programs and new housing projects to expanded transportation 
systems and river basin development, Thaksin promised to 
eradicate poverty in Thailand within his next term if his 
government is given another four year lease in office. 
Thaksin was in rare form, alternately boasting of his ability 
to deliver while lambasting the main opposition Democrat 
Party (DP) for its inability to do so.  In a calculated ploy 
to humanize his image, Thaksin admitted to a tendency to lose 
his temper with critics and bemoaned the effect of being 
Prime Minister on his sex life.  DP Leader Banyat Bantadtan, 
not surprisingly, criticized Thaksin for holding a gaudy 
campaign inauguration while providing no answers to the 
issues of Avian Flu and southern violence.  Despite -- or 
perhaps because of -- recent polls showing a softening in 
voter support, the Prime Minister is mounting a pronouncedly 
populist political campaign that offers something for 
everyone in Thai society.  End Summary. 
 
GRAND OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THAKSIN\'S SECOND BID 
 
2.  (U)  PM Thaksin formally launched his bid for a second 
four year term before thousands of loyalists from his Thai 
Rak Thai (TRT) party in a nationally televised extravaganza 
on October 17.  The Hua Mark indoor Stadium venue in Bangkok 
was connected through a teleconferencing link to thousands 
more TRT supporters at eight locations throughout Thailand, 
including Samut Sakhon, Chon Buri, Chiang Mai, Nakhon 
Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Nakhon Phanom, Saraburi and 
Phattalung.  The Prime Minister came with a full bag of 
trademark \"populist\" promises for his next term, designed to 
appeal especially to voters in the nation\'s 74,000 villages. 
Vowing to the national audience that he will eradicate 
poverty in Thailand over the next four years, Thaksin 
promised his crucial rural constituency that his earlier 
rotating village fund scheme will evolve into a system of 
village \"banks\" offering easy access to loans for farmers. 
Thaksin also announced that his government will form a 
organization to take out loans for poor farmers that the 
recipients will be able to repay with produce and livestock. 
 
3.  (U)  Thaksin declared that his second administration will 
also dispatch \"poverty eradication caravans\" throughout 
Thailand to provide job training for the unemployed, who 
would also be given a 100 baht daily allowance (approx. 41 
baht equals 1 US dollar) for participating.  Thaksin also 
promised that land right papers will be issued to squatting 
farmers who are now occupying and using public land.  In 
another nod to the nation\'s lower income group, Thaksin 
announced that he will expand his 30 baht medical care 
program through increased levies on tobacco, alcohol and 
other \"vices.\"  The poor will also be given more low cost 
housing and slums will be eradicated (though no one will be 
forced to leave them, he reassuringly added). 
 
4.  (U)  Thaksin also provided for Thailand\'s middle class in 
his package of promises.  Addressing a subject dear to the 
heart of every Bangkok commuter -- the city\'s massive traffic 
jams -- Thaksin vowed to spend 1.1 trillion baht to improve 
traffic flow in and around the capital.  He promised to build 
more \"sky train\" (elevated tracked transport) and subway 
routes -- while keeping fares low for the ridership.  Tax 
deductions up to 60,000 baht will be offered to those caring 
for elderly parents.  Small business will be granted a higher 
tax deductible income base on their revenue.  Thaksin told 
his supporters and the nationwide audience that that his 
second administration also will develop the country\'s river 
basins and construct more reservoirs to combat drought. 
Bureaucratic performance will be improved and corruption 
addressed. 
 
\"I CAN DELIVER\" 
 
5.  (U)  Thaksin, casually dressed in his TRT party jacket 
and clearly dominating his enthusiastic, flag-waving crowd, 
repeatedly pumped on the theme of TRT\'s ability to deliver on 
its promises.  He outlined his own successes and also made 
repeated references to the opposition Democrat Party\'s 
\"failures.\"  Referring to the question of how he will fund 
all of his promised programs, Thaksin -- the country\'s most 
successful businessman -- declared that \"we have the money 
because I know how to make money.  And when I promise to do 
something, you can be sure I can deliver, unlike the other 
party that failed because they promised but couldn\'t 
deliver.\"  Thaksin referred proudly to his record as prime 
minister over the past four years, pointing out that during 
this period Thailand came out of the economic crisis that had 
plagued it since 1997.  (Note:  Thaksin emphasized how his 
government has performed for the nation\'s economy.  For 
example, he  pointedly noted to his audience in the DP 
stronghold southern city of Phattalung that under his 
administration rubber and palm oil prices are good, as are 
tourist numbers) 
 
THAKSIN MAKES SOME INTERESTING ADMISSIONS 
 
6.  (U)  Thaksin told the assembled faithful that, though 
weary from his four years in office, he believed he had 
successfully addressed many of the country\'s problems.  In a 
moment of introspection, Thaksin admitted that he had been 
\"rash and hot headed at times\" with his critics, but vowed to 
\"keep cool.\" (Note:  This is not the first time the Prime 
Minister has vowed to curb his famous temper.)  Oddly, after 
ruing that his duties as Prime Minister has given him little 
time to spend with his family, he volunteered that \"my sex 
life also suffers.\"  The two-hour show concluded with 
displays of cheering crowds, balloons and fireworks. 
 
TRT TARNISHED IN RECENT MONTHS 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment:  Thaksin has come out with a strong 
populist platform that will undoubtedly excite his rural vote 
base, if not the more skeptical Bangkok electorate.   He is 
anxious to shore up a widely perceived sag in his party\'s 
popularity since last summer\'s win of the Bangkok 
governorship by the Democrat Party.  Troubled by an inability 
thus far to stem chronic violence in the south and a recent 
revival of the Avian Flu scare, Thaksin is talking more 
defensively.  His public comments scale back his earlier 
predictions of a massive Thai Rak Thai win in the next 
general election.  In recent remarks, Thaksin appeared to 
back away from his earlier call for 400 out of 500 
parliamentary seats.  On October 12, Thaksin told the 
\"Nation\" newspaper that the TRT is \"certain\" to win 200 seats 
and to take a proportionate number of the 100 party list 
seats given automatic appointments in ratio to their parties\' 
total vote.  Apart from the latest reshuffle (ref b), Thaksin 
has been rolling out a number of public initiatives recently 
to buttress his popularity.  These include the recent 
inauguration of a campaign against corruption, salary hikes 
for low-level government employees and minimum wage 
increases. 
 
CAMPAIGNING TO ACCELERATE 
 
8.  (SBU)  Comment continued:  Election campaign-related 
activities will continue to pick up.  So will the exchange 
between the opponents.  DP Leader Banyat Bantadtan criticized 
Thaksin for holding a gaudy campaign inauguration while 
providing no answers to the issues of reemergence of Avian 
Flu and southern violence.  Thaksin, for his part, will 
likely repeat his characterization of the DP as weak, out of 
touch and unable to deliver on campaign promises.  Thaksin 
appears confident that his hold is secure on the vote-rich 
north and northeast regions of the country.  He is preparing, 
however, for a battle with the DP for the much less certain 
south and central regions.  His campaign kickoff suggests 
that Thaksin will rely on a re-election strategy of direct 
appeal to voters over the head of local power brokers, 
something similar to the method that served him so well in 
2000-01.  He is again prepared to offer the electorate as 
many blandishments as it takes to win, whether they are 
financially sound and fully realizable or not.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: THAI VIEWS OF A MORE ASSERTIVE CHINA 
 
REF: BANGKOK 4085 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Darryl N. Johnson.  Reasons 1.4 (a and d) 
 
 1.  (C)  Summary.  When analyzing China\'s growing influence 
in the region, Thai experts tend to: accept China\'s growing 
power as inevitable; hope that problems associated with 
China\'s growing strength will either fix themselves or be 
mitigated by other powers like the United States or India; 
and, keep their fingers crossed that trade deals with China 
lead to growth in Thailand without destroying domestic 
enterprises.  Thai analysts note that China is deftly 
building up good will in the region to assuage any concerns 
about hegemony.  Perhaps naively, they tend to discount 
notions that China will jeopardize its generally good 
relations in the region in the near future by pressuring 
ASEAN nations to support Beijing on political or strategic 
issues. 
 
2.  (C)  Thai experts tend to view China\'s growing role as 
either not affecting the influence of other countries or as 
coming at the expense of Taiwan and Japan rather than the 
United States.  Nonetheless, some warn that China\'s growing 
role in the region comes at a time when the United States 
appears preoccupied in the Middle East and with the War on 
Terror.  The MFA believes that it will be 15 years before 
China could pose a security threat to the region and expects 
the U.S.-Thai security alliance to counter any future threat. 
 While almost all experts note the generally positive nature 
of Sino-Thai links -- pointing to China\'s help during 
conflicts with Laos and Cambodia, China\'s positive role 
during the Asian financial crisis and China\'s signing with 
ASEAN the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea -- they also 
point to the growing possibility of contention in several 
fields:  trade, Burma, energy, and Chinese development in the 
upper Mekong River region.  Undermining their analysis, Thai 
government analysts notably tend to discount the possibility 
of internal unrest, demographic problems or economic upheaval 
upsetting current growth patterns inside China.  Similarly, 
they tend not to focus on the possibility of conflict between 
Taiwan and the Mainland -- an attitude criticized by some in 
academia and the media as overly optimistic.  Thai Government 
experts would benefit from opportunities to share views on 
China\'s role in the region with U.S. delegations.  End 
Summary. 
 
PALPABLE INTEREST IN THINGS CHINESE 
 
3.  (SBU)  China\'s cultural influence continues to expand in 
Thailand in obvious ways.  In 2003, according to the Thai 
National Statistical Office, 624,214 PRC citizens visited 
Thailand, making it the 6th largest source of tourists to the 
country (after Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and 
Singapore).  The 15 percent of Thais who are ethnic Chinese 
seem to take a greater pride in their heritage -- notably, 
some now use their Chinese surnames along with their Thai 
ones.  The number of Mandarin language schools is growing at 
the same time Japanese language studies are declining. Thai 
sports fans openly pulled for Chinese athletes in the 
Olympics in ways they\'ve never supported Japanese or other 
Asian competitors in the past.  PRC-owned English-language 
CCTV Channel 9 is very popular in Thailand and Mandarin 
broadcasts on CCTV Channel 4 are readily available.  The 
foreign news editor for the national television network 
Channel 9 reported that his station has signed a cooperative 
agreement with CCTV.  According to the editor, Channel 9 airs 
around four direct feeds from CCTV at the top of its 
international news every morning.  The English-language 
newspaper The China Daily plans to open a publishing 
operation in Bangkok in 2005.  The Xinhua news agency is 
quite active and regularly places stories about \"progress\" in 
Tibet and Han-Uighur \"cooperation\" in Xinjiang.  Beijing 
sponsors cultural and educational programs throughout the 
country and has invested heavily in subsidizing Mandarin 
training centers.  Thai journalists are regular beneficiaries 
of Beijing-funded junkets to China.  A recent trip to Tibet 
for ten Thai journalists resulted in a number of glowing 
stories in Thai papers about the benevolence of Chinese rule 
in Lhasa.  Chinese and Thai diplomats express solidarity 
openly. 
 
CHINA\'S RISE IS INEVITABLE 
 
4.  (C)  Thai military, intelligence and foreign policy 
analysts at the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), National 
Defense Studies Institute (NDSI) and MFA tend to view China\'s 
growing influence in Southeast Asia as inevitable.  This 
attitude was probably best described by Thongchai Chasiawath, 
Counselor for the MFA\'s Third Asian Division, who recently 
said \"everyone is scared of the China threat, but if you 
can\'t fight it, you must accept it and become its friend. 
Build ties with that threat so that if they ever do hit you, 
they hit their own interests.\"  Rudiwan Kateluxana of the NIA 
said \"we have no other option but to accept China\'s offer for 
closer economic links -- the opportunity is too great. 
Nonetheless, we have to be cognizant that China is also a 
competitor.  Our challenge during the next few years as we 
use our Free Trade Agreement with China to export our 
agricultural goods, is to improve our competitiveness in 
other areas.\"  CAPT Nopadon Suwanapong of the military\'s 
Strategic Research Institute (SRI), said that \"the concept of 
the \'China Threat\' in traditional strategic terms is gone, to 
be replaced by the concept of China as trading partner and 
economic engine.\"  Several contacts hope that risks to 
Thailand posed by a rising China can be offset by continuing 
strong links with the United States and, to a lesser extent, 
with India. 
 
WINNING GOODWILL BY GOOD BEHAVIOR 
 
5.  (C)  Most Thai experts acknowledge the deft diplomacy 
China recently has used to help reassure ASEAN countries in 
general and Thailand in particular that China is a peaceful 
neighbor.  They cite China signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity 
and Cooperation (TAC), ASEAN Code of Conduct in the South 
China Sea, China\'s leadership role in the Six-Party Talks on 
Korea, the China-ASEAN Strategic partnership and the 
China-ASEAN Joint Declaration on Non-Traditional Threats as 
evidence of China\'s growing trustworthiness.  Thongchai at 
MFA believes that Hu Jintao and the other fourth generation 
leaders in the PRC are much more adept at building regional 
ties than Jiang Zemin was.  \"Hu is building bridges to the EU 
and to ASEAN in a way Jiang never did; Jiang was much more 
concerned with having strong ties with the United States,\" he 
said.  CAPT Arna Charanyananda, J-2 staff officer at the 
Joint Staff College, sees China\'s signing the Code of Conduct 
in the South China Sea as an example of Beijing putting its 
desire to win influence in the region ahead of its short-term 
national interest -- a view echoed by Rudiwan at the NIA. 
\"Ten years ago, China repeatedly threatened to use force over 
the Spratleys,\" Rudiwan explained; \"today, it has renounced 
the use of force.\"  SRI\'s Nopadon thinks that, by tying China 
to regional security protocols, ASEAN is helping to ensure 
that China will act more responsibly. 
 
ECONOMIC LINKS ARE SEDUCTIVE 
 
6.  (C)  In addition to China making effective diplomatic 
moves, all of the Thai China watchers interviewed for this 
message agree that the desire to have access to China\'s 
market is the major driving factor in Thailand\'s growing 
links with the PRC.  According to the Customs Department of 
Thailand, in 2003 Thailand exported 235 billion baht (5.73 
billion dollars) of goods to China, a 54 percent increase 
over 2002.  Also in 2003, Thailand imported 203 billion baht 
(4.95 billion dollars) worth of goods from the PRC, a decline 
of 4 percent from 2002.  The October 2003 Sino-Thai Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 2002 Sino-ASEAN FTA have many 
Thai companies eager to sell their wares in China.  Rudiwan 
believes that growing economic competition between China and 
the United States is good for medium-sized economies like 
Thailand\'s.  Suvapan Tamyuwattana, Director of NIA\'s Division 
One, noted that many ASEAN leaders, including some in 
Thailand, now subscribe to the Chinese maxim, \"what is good 
for China is good for the rest of Asia.\"  MFA\'s Thongchai 
pointed out that PM Thaksin agrees with the maxim that \"a 
rich China will lead to a prosperous Asia\" and claims that 
Chinese leaders who promote economic links with Thailand are 
\"knocking on an open door.\"  Thongchai sees Thailand as 
uniquely situated to serve as a bridge between China and the 
rest of ASEAN.  He is optimistic that China will expand road 
links to Thailand, passing through Laos and Burma, linking 
the two countries. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Public perceptions of the impact of the FTA 
affecting agricultural goods are quite different than the 
optimistic view Thai analysts tend to hold.  87 percent of 
the items covered by the Sino-Thai FTA are fruits and 
vegetables.  According to the Customs Department of Thailand, 
from October 2003 until September 2004 the value of Thai 
fruit exported to China under the FTA was 3.43 billion baht 
(83 million dollars), a 37 percent increase from the previous 
12 months.  For the same period, however, Chinese exports of 
fruit to Thailand were worth 1.28 billion baht (31 million 
dollars) an increase of 125 percent over the previous 12 
months.  For the same period, the value of Thai vegetables 
exported to China was 8.13 billion baht (198 million dollars) 
a 73 percent increase over the previous year while Chinese 
exports of vegetables to Thailand were worth 3.06 billion 
baht (76 million dollars) a 120 percent increase.  Press 
reports and public comments on the FTA Early Harvest pact 
have focused on its impact on Thai farmers in the north of 
the country who have reportedly been overwhelmed by cheaper 
and better Chinese agricultural products such as garlic and 
onions.  Experts complain that the RTG, which was urged to 
quickly conclude the agreement by PM Thaksin, did not 
seriously study the impact of the agreement nor draw up plans 
to help those negatively affected by it.  In addition, 
critics complain that Thai negotiators did not understand or 
anticipate the difficulties faced by intra-provincial trade 
in China, or the effect that excise taxes, documentation 
requirements and other non-tariff barrier would have on Thai 
products going into China.  Ministry of Commerce officials 
admit this lapse and say that it has been a good learning 
experience.  Interestingly, the Thai public seems to blame 
the RTG for rushing into the agreement rather than the 
Chinese for benefiting from it. 
 
MILITARY TO MILITARY LINKS WITH CHINA 
 
8.  (C)  Thailand continues to have good relations with the 
Chinese military.  The Chinese military attache in Bangkok is 
a Brigadier General.  Chinese defense sales delegations visit 
Bangkok frequently.  Many Thai military officers are 
appreciative of China\'s assistance in supplying small arms, 
tanks and artillery shells during conflicts involving Laos 
and Cambodia and every year a number of Thai officers receive 
military training in China.  Nonetheless, Thai officers 
acknowledge a vast disparity between Thailand\'s military 
links with the United States and links with the PRC.  \"Most 
of the equipment we received from China was not of good 
quality when we received it and it is all outdated now,\" 
General Ronachuck Swasdikiat, former Commanding General of 
the National Defense Studies Institute,  said.  NIA\'s Suvapan 
notes the growing number of security seminars and dialogues 
Thailand and ASEAN countries have with China and expects 
these to continue to increase.  However, a number of Thai 
military officers are quick to emphasize that China\'s 
influence on the Thai military is minuscule compared to that 
of the United States.  \"For every one officer we send to 
Beijing for training, we send 400 to the United States,\" one 
explained. 
 
DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN BANGKOK 
 
9.  (C)   PRC diplomats in Bangkok have told U.S. Embassy 
officials that they view the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok as 
Beijing\'s leading diplomatic presence in ASEAN.  Chinese 
Ambassador Zhang Jiuhuan is a polished professional -- a 
veteran of two previous tours to Bangkok and one in Singapore 
-- who speaks excellent Thai and English.  Mid-level Chinese 
Embassy staff tend to be much more professional than their 
predecessors.  The PRC Embassy in Bangkok has done a 
masterful job of reaching out to Sino-Thais.  While attending 
a large PRC-hosted function that included several hundred 
ethnic-Chinese Thai nationals, one senior Chinese official 
proudly claimed that \"ten years ago this would have been 
Taiwan\'s crowd.\"  Thai military and government officials 
attended PRC National Day on October 1 in large numbers and 
at senior levels. 
 
 
CHINA AND THAKSIN 
 
10.  (C)  Allegations that Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 
is under Beijing\'s spell are rife in Bangkok.  Outspoken 
Thaksin critic Kavi Chongkittavorn of the Nation calls 
Thaksin \"China\'s deputy sheriff.\"  Professor Thitinan 
Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University claims that 
Thaksin\'s decision to single out and expel Falun Gong 
adherents from Bangkok in preparation for 2003\'s APEC Leaders 
Summit was directly due to pressure from Chinese leaders 
(NOTE:  Falun Gong adherents also were not tolerated under 
the previous Thai administration).  Thitinan and Kavi both 
claim Thaksin has been receptive to overtures from Beijing in 
order to win contracts for Thaksin\'s family multinational 
company, Shin Corporation.  They point to a recent telecom 
license deal involving Shin\'s IPStar broadband satellite 
system and the China Satellite Communications Corporation 
(Chinasat) as an example of how China has rewarded Thaksin 
for his support of closer business links. 
 
CHINA\'S RISE COMING AT WHOSE EXPENSE? 
 
11.  (C)  Many Thai analysts believe that both Japan and 
Taiwan are losing influence to a rising China.  Rudiwan notes 
that China\'s growing influence in the region comes at a time 
when Japan is declining in power and the United States is 
preoccupied in the Middle East and with the War on Terror. 
She suggests that ASEAN countries are improving ties with 
China to take into account China\'s rise and to hedge bets in 
case the United States remains occupied elsewhere.  Rudiwan 
also points out that China\'s effective use of Free Trade 
Agreements with ASEAN countries make those countries more 
linked to China and cut Taiwan out.  In 2003, according to 
the Customs Department of Thailand, Thai exports to Taiwan 
were worth 108 billion baht (2.63 billion dollars), or 46 
percent of exports to the PRC.  In 2001, Thai exports to 
Taiwan were worth 85 billion baht (2.07 billion dollars) or 
67 percent of the value of exports to the Mainland.  In 2001, 
more Taiwanese than mainland tourists visited Thailand but 
those numbers have reversed since then.  Nopadon sees 
participation in regional meetings as an effective bellwether 
of influence. He notes the growing number of Chinese scholars 
at conferences outlining the future of Southeast Asia and 
sees fewer and fewer Japanese scholars attending. Kavi 
Chonkittavorn claims that contacts between senior Thai and 
Chinese leaders are much more frequent than they were in the 
past and seem to be coming at the expense of meetings between 
Thai and Japanese leaders. 
 
12.  (C)  Political Minister Hasegawa Susumu and First 
Secretary Hajime Kishimori of the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok 
 
SIPDIS 
are also convinced that China\'s growing role in Southeast 
Asia is coming at Japan\'s expense.  They privately lament 
that Tokyo does not seem to have a coherent strategy to 
reengage with the region.  MFA\'s Thongchai also believes 
China\'s growing role is coming at a time when Japan\'s 
influence is declining.  He thinks that it would be good for 
U.S. interests if Washington were to urge Japan to take a 
more active leadership role in fora affecting Thailand. 
 
CHINA TAKING OVER ASEAN? 
 
13.  (C)  Many analysts suspect China\'s participation in the 
ASEAN region is an attempt to further expand its influence, 
perhaps at the expense of the United States.  Arna of the 
Joint Staff College describes China\'s \"partnership strategy\" 
as the means by which China hopes to emerge as a long-term 
counterweight to the United States in the region.  Under this 
\"partnership strategy\" China stresses the need for 
multilateral approaches in ASEAN and ARF as the best means to 
solve regional problems. China is also not hesitant to play 
up its role as a member of the UNSC P-5.  While Arna believes 
China wishes to use only economic influence in the near-term, 
he is convinced that China\'s ultimate aim is to replace the 
United States as the strongest power in the region.  Rudiwan 
at NIA claims that every country in ASEAN remains quietly 
suspicious of China\'s real agenda in the region and is 
concerned about its influence in ASEAN.  Nonetheless, she 
notes, so far the attractiveness of the China market coupled 
with China\'s good behavior in North Korea and the Spratleys 
has more than offset that suspicion.  MFA\'s Thongchai also 
believes that China wants ASEAN to be \"China-centric\" and is 
convinced of China\'s long-term goal to supplant the United 
States in the region.  However, he discounts concerns that 
China will be able to exercise power on a par with the United 
States for decades.  On the other hand, Nopadon believes that 
China\'s growing role in ASEAN will not allow the organization 
to act contrary to China\'s wishes ten years from now. 
 
UNITED STATES REMAINS THE PREEMINENT POWER 
 
14.  (C)  General Ronachuck observed that Thailand is not 
about to replace the United States with China as its 
strategic partner; \"we are cordial with China, we are allies 
with the United States, and that\'s not about to change\" he 
said.  NIA\'s Suvapan goes further by saying \"We recognize 
that China is trying to use growing economic ties to create 
an atmosphere of political and security dependence, but this 
issue is quite sensitive among Thai senior officials who 
intend to rely on the United States as the prime guarantor of 
security in the region for the foreseeable future.\"  MFA\'s 
Thongchai thinks that, to counter the risk of a rising China, 
Thailand will need to rely more strongly on the bilateral 
relationship with the United States.  He does not see this as 
a zero sum game, however, noting that if China and the United 
States can continue to improve relations with each other, 
they could work jointly in the region to promote stability. 
 
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE -- ARE THAIS NAIVE? 
 
15.  (C)  Most of the analysts interviewed seem convinced 
that China\'s impressive economic growth will continue for the 
next several years uninterrupted.  None seem willing to 
seriously entertain the notion that China\'s huge unemployment 
figure, overheated financial sector, insolvent banks, aging 
population or underdeveloped interior might upset the 
economic juggernaut.  As a result, Thai analysts seem unable 
to consider moves a struggling China might make that could 
jeopardize regional security.  COL Thavin Akaramathayut, J-3 
Staff officer at the Joint Staff College, realizes that China 
must continue to maintain a high level of economic growth in 
order to modernize and believes that China will be unwilling 
to jeopardize Southeast Asia\'s peaceful environment for the 
foreseeable future.  Nopadon is also generally optimistic 
about China\'s emerging role in Southeast Asia and seemed 
unwilling to consider alternative scenarios where internal 
problems cause China to act aggressively to divert domestic 
attention.  Thongchai at MFA is convinced that Chinese 
leaders will not make any aggressive moves in the region for 
the foreseeable future; \"their number one concern is to 
maintain Party control and they will do nothing to jeopardize 
the economic growth that allows the Party to remain in 
power.\"  He added, \"China can\'t afford a war over Taiwan, it 
would kill economic growth.\"  Rudiwan agreed by saying, \"We 
are not sure that China would use force against Taiwan; in 
the near term we think China wishes not to jeopardize its 
economic development.  In the future, however, we are not 
sure what China\'s long range strategy is.\"  She added, \"We 
believe the United States will continue to successfully use 
influence over Taiwan to prevent Taipei from declaring 
independence.\" 
 
OVERLY ROSY PICTURE? 
 
16.  (C)  General (ret.) Teerawat Putamanonda, an influential 
thinker on a number of security issues, is concerned that 
Thai leaders have too rosy an opinion of future relations 
with China.  \"I think they are not considering our potential 
points of conflict carefully enough,\" he cautioned.  Teerawat 
is especially concerned that China\'s growing influence in 
Burma will undermine Thailand\'s interests there and hurt 
efforts to stop the drug trade between Thailand and Burma. 
Doctor Panitan Wattanayagorn of Chulalongkorn University said 
that, while Thailand should not overlook the possible 
benefits of closer ties with the PRC, it is in Thailand\'s 
best interests to think about less sanguine possibilities. 
Panitan thinks that Thai analysts covering China could gain 
much by having more regular meetings with U.S. counterparts. 
 
 
SOME AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT STARTING TO APPEAR 
17.  (C)  While noting the generally good relationship 
between China and ASEAN countries, some analysts predict that 
the number of contentious issues will grow as China becomes 
stronger.  Thongchai noted how forcefully Beijing responded 
to Singapore PM Lee Hsian Loong\'s recent trip to Taipei and 
expressed concern over how abjectly Singapore apologized and 
made amends for the \"offense.\"  Kavi of the Nation finds it 
significant that ASEAN resisted Chinese overtures to accede 
to the protocol of the Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free 
Zone but is skeptical that the effort may have served as a 
wake up call to ASEAN leaders that they need to stand up to 
Beijing more frequently.  Joe Horn, an Anglo-Thai businessman 
with offices in Bangkok and Beijing believes that trade 
friction between Thailand and China will only increase. 
\"It\'s fairly easy to avoid the political hotbuttons with 
Beijing -- Tibet, Falun Gong, Taiwan -- but as more and more 
Thai consumer companies are undercut by cheap Chinese 
imports, there will be a growing call to protect Thai 
industry,\" he predicted.  Thongchai at MFA and General 
Teerawat believe that Burma will become an increasingly large 
irritant between China and Thailand.  Thongchai believes that 
Chinese efforts to reach the Andaman Sea through Burma are at 
odds with Thailand\'s interests in having Chinese goods bound 
for ASEAN pass through Thailand. 
 
18.  (C)  General Ronachuck believes that China\'s planned 
dams along the upper Mekong River will give it a great deal 
of influence over countries downriver.  SRI\'s Nopadon 
foresees Mekong subregional development and the drive to find 
new sources of fossil fuels as the two issues most likely to 
cause bilateral problems between China and Thailand.  He sees 
energy security as second only to Taiwan as a potential cause 
for China to use force in the region.  Nopadon described 
Beijing\'s attitude towards Taiwan as \"irrational\" and, 
looking at Chinese spectators\' behavior during the recent 
Asian Games, expressed concern about rising nationalism in 
the PRC.  LTG Tanongsuk Tuvinun, Superintendent of the 
National Defense College, is also skeptical that Thailand can 
avoid economic disagreements with China; \"China says it does 
not want to be a superpower, but it seems to be moving in 
that way by acquiring better defense technology, improving 
its space program and modernizing its military.  Every 
country looks at China as a potential export market, yet look 
around at how many companies import far more from China than 
they export there.\" 
 
WHEN COULD CHINA POSE A SECURITY THREAT? 
 
19.  (C)  NIA\'s Rudiwan concludes that China will continue to 
try to use its economic clout to influence ASEAN countries in 
the political and security fields.  Nonetheless, she doesn\'t 
see China as an outright security threat for several years. 
Thongchai predicts it will be 2020 at the earliest before 
China will have the potential to pose a military threat to 
Thailand.  If present economic trends continue and China can 
maintain 7 percent annual growth, Thongchai believes China 
could have the means to possess three or four aircraft 
carriers by 2020. 
 
COMMENT 
 
20.  (C)  While Thailand\'s desire to see China emerge in the 
future as a responsible member of the international community 
are in line with our objectives, Thai analysis of the 
ramifications of China\'s growing influence seems inadequate 
and overly optimistic.  RTG economic officials seem unable to 
gauge the impact of many of Thailand\'s recent trade deals 
with China, and Thai strategic thinkers seem overly sanguine 
about the effect China\'s rise will have on the security 
situation in the region.  Thailand\'s close ties with the PRC 
give Thai sinologists some insights that might be beneficial 
to American experts.  A regular exchange of views between 
Thai and U.S. sinologists could improve our insights into 
Chinese policies and practices in this region while helping 
the Thais to improve their analysis.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: RTG ADMITS DEATHS OF DETAINEES TAKEN AFTER 
DEMONSTRATIONS IN NARATHIWAT 
 
REF: BANGKOK 7391 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Robert Clarke.  Reason:  1.4 (d) 
 
1.  (U)  Summary:  Late on October 26, Royal Thai Government 
(RTG) officials confirmed that 78 demonstrators (of over 1300 
detainees) taken in custody after an October 25 clash with 
security units at Tak Bai Police Station in Narathiwat 
province died \"in transit\" to an army camp in Pattani.  These 
deaths brought the death toll from Tak Bai incident to 84 
when added to the six demonstrators killed by gunfire at the 
scene of the clash.  According to the RTG report, about 80 
percent of the 78 victims died of asphyxia and the remainder 
from convulsions.  Photographs taken at the site in 
Narathiwat where the demonstrators were loaded onto army 
trucks show them being laid on the truck beds and apparently 
piled several stacks high on top of each other.  Some Muslim 
and other observers have warned that the deaths of the 
detainees will lead to revenge and deepening violence in the 
South.  On October 27, Thaksin announced to the Thai Senate 
that he will convene an inquiry into the death of the 78 
Muslim protesters who were rounded up by police and military 
troops and crammed into trucks.  One unsubstantiated account 
claims that some of the detainees died from beatings suffered 
en route to Pattani.  End Summary. 
 
RTG OFFICIALS\' GRISLY REPORT ON TAK BAI INCIDENT AFTERMATH 
 
2.  (U)  At a hastily arranged press conference in Pattani 
late on October 26, Dr. Pornthip Rojansunant, Deputy Director 
of the Justice Ministry,s Central Institute of Forensic 
Science (and the country,s most respected pathologist), 
Deputy Permanent Minister of Justice Manit Suthaporn and 
Major General Sinchai Nutsathit, Deputy Commander of the 
Fourth Army Region, announced that 78 detainees had died 
while being transported from Tak Bai Police Station in 
Narathiwat to Pattani, a distance of about 120 kilometers, 
the previous day.  On the morning of October 27, in an 
interview with Thai Channel 11, Dr. Pornthip repeated her 
initial explanation of the causes of death by stating that 
cursory autopsies indicated that about \"80 percent\" of the 78 
victims died of asphyxia or suffocation.  The remaining 20 
percent, she said, appeared to have died from \"convulsions.\" 
Dr. Porthip also released frontal facial photos of the dead, 
which showed multiple bruises.  She stated that many of the 
dead had twisted limbs and some had broken spines, indicating 
they were crushed by the overcrowded conditions. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Porntip said she had not conducted an 
investigation of the trucks used (reported to be between 20 
and 25 to transport 1300 detainees).  Nor had she 
investigated the  procedures of detention and transport 
employed by the Police and Army.  However, pictures in the 
press taken from video footage show that the detainees, with 
their shirts removed and their hands tied behind them, had 
been piled face down in the trucks and stacked in layers of 
three.  The military trucks are designed to transport 
approximately 20 individuals normally seated in two rows on 
either die of the flatbed trucks.  During the press 
conference, officials did not state the time it took to 
transfer the detainees from Tak Bai to Camp Ingkhayyut 
Borihan in Pattani by this method during the evening of 
October 25.  However, several sources indicate that the 
transit time was between 4-5 hours along a 4-lane highway for 
a trip that normally takes about 90 minutes. 
 
THAKSIN ANNOUNCES INVESTIGATION 
 
4.  (U)  Prime Minister Thaksin flew to Narathiwat on October 
25 and praised the security forces for their actions in 
controlling the demonstration at the police station.  He said 
that the government had \"run out of patience against elements 
instigating violence.  He added that security forces should 
forego the use of weapons in managing protests .  He 
reportedly said the security units at Tak Bai had taken the 
correct step in firing their weapons in the air.  \"They did a 
great job.  They have my praise.\"  These comments were made 
before revelation of the detainee transport deaths.  On 
October 26, on initially hearing of the additional 78 
victims, he reportedly said, \"It\'s about bodies make weak 
from fasting. Nobody hurt them.\"  On October 27, Thaksin 
announced to the Thai Senate that he will convene an inquiry 
into the death of the 78 Muslim protesters who were rounded 
up by troops and crammed into trucks.  Thaksin told the 
Senate that his government will set up a committee to 
investigate why the detainees were apparently crowded into 
trucks until they couldn\'t breathe.  Thaksin told the 
legislators that \"We feel sorry. We tried to take care of 
them well. They should not have died. There will be a 
committee to investigate so that we can draw lessons from 
this.\" 
 
5. (C) A visiting NGO representative who met with Thaksin on 
October 27 said that the Prime Minister had admitted that 
\"mistakes\" had been made in the joint police-military 
transport operation.  He claimed that the phases that police 
had used to break up the demonstration (negotiations, then 
water hoses, and only then force) had been taken under his 
instructions.  On October 27, MFA Americas Director General 
Nongnuth, echoing Thaksin\'s earlier reaction, told us that 
the security forces had not realized how weak the detainees 
were from fasting, and in addition had used the wrong type of 
tarpaulin, a less air-permeable type, to cover the transport 
trucks en route. 
 
CONFUSION OVER ANNOUNCEMENT OF MASS DEATHS 
 
6. (C)  On October 27, Dr. Pornthip told the Embassy that the 
hastily arranged press conference on Tuesday, October 26 at 
C.S. Pattani Hotel was actually prepared for General Sirichai 
Tunyasiri, Director of the Southern Border Provinces 
Peace-Keeping Command (SBPPC) to give an official account of 
the event to the public.  But Sirichai didn,t show up at the 
scheduled time and, therefore, she and her superior, Deputy 
Permanent Secretary for Justice, Manit Suthaporn, and Fourth 
Army Deputy Commander Maj. Gen. Sinchai Nutsathit had to 
conduct the press conference themselves.  A source in the 
Thai military told the Embassy that  Prime Minister Thaksin 
wanted the medical team, not the military commander or the 
Director of SBPPC, to disclose this information to the 
public.  Mr. Anusart Suwanmongkol, owner of the C.S. hotel, 
observed that it was the first time that this kind of press 
conference (normally held inside the nearby 
Ingkayutthaboriharn military camp) was staged at a private 
hotel. 
 
7. (C)  According to Dr. Pornthip, she examined the bodies of 
the detainees on Tuesday, October 26, at 8.00 a.m. at Pattani 
Provincial Hospital, confirmed the total number of 78 deaths 
(not including 6 killed at the scene of the demonstration), 
and had reached her conclusions about asphyxiation being the 
primary cause of death.  She also told us that although all 
the bodies had bruising type wounds, there were no 
penetrative or gunshot type wounds.  As in her public 
interview, she refused to comment on details surrounding the 
loading and transporting of the 1,300 arrested demonstrators 
or the conditions in the trucks.  She maintained her version 
that she only came to the hospital to examine the bodies on 
the morning following the day of the incident.  She stressed 
that what she found upon arriving at the hospital were just 
the dead bodies of 78 protesters and was thus not in a 
position to comment on any circumstantial evidence or other 
details. 
 
8. (C) Poloff met October 27 with the news editor of the 
English-language daily, the Nation.  She told him that one 
source had claimed that the first truckload of detainees, 
reportedly filled with those identified specifically as 
\"trouble-makers,\" had arrived at the Ingkayutthaboriharn 
military camp with its passengers either dead or dying from 
beatings.  This story has not been otherwise confirmed. 
 
REACTIONS FROM MUSLIM AND HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS 
 
9. (U)  Muslim groups and human rights organizations in 
Thailand have reacted strongly to this tragedy. Abdullahman 
Abdulsomat, Chairman of Narathiwat provincial Islamic 
committee described the government actions at Tak Bai as 
\"totally insane... Certainly, this will escalate further and 
who knows what will happen next.\"  Nideh Waba, Chairman of a 
private religious schools association, reportedly warned that 
\"Those militants... will fight back harshly with suicide 
attacks -- they (the government) have to kill thousands of us 
or hundreds of thousands of our brothers here to prevent us 
from standing up against this massacre.  This is totally 
unacceptable and the prime minister must take direct 
responsibility for the consequences,\"  Even more ominously 
the Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO) published 
on its Thai language website a threat of revenge from the 
\"Suicide Unit of Ramadan Sharif\" for the incident and a 
threat against the Senior Muslim Representative in Thailand, 
the Chula Ratchamontri, if he makes any statements in support 
of the RTG\'s action at Tak Bai.  The PULO website features 
photos of the incident, mainly featuring handcuffed young 
Muslim males lying on the ground at the Tak Bai site with 
Thai troops and police standing over them.  Similar footage 
was shown for a few hours on government owned television 
stations on October 26. 
 
10. (U) Thai National Human Rights Commissioner Jaran 
Ditthapichai told journalists October 27 that the Commission 
will send a letter to PM Thaksin to express its strong 
concerns over the deaths and to demand that the government 
implement appropriate measures to solve the Southern problem 
carefully and peacefully. 
11. (U) On October 27, local Thai NGOs circulated material 
from the HongKong-based Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) 
which charged that \"this is another mass killing committed by 
Thai security forces in southern provinces. Before this 
event, the government\'s official figures showed that more 
than 400 people had been killed since this January.  The AHRC 
is gravely concerned that the Thai authorities\' repeated use 
of violence against civilians badly affects the rule of law 
in the country, and further encourages impunity of the police 
and soldiers to get involved in further violence.\"  This 
statement was accompanied by an appeal to write PM Thaksin 
and other RTG ministers in protest. 
 
ESCALATING TENSIONS 
 
12.  (C)  Comment:  PM Thaksin has now promised to 
investigate the deaths of the detainees, but he does not seem 
to be moving quickly enough--or sympathetically enough--to 
avert widespread Thai Muslim anger over the Tak Bai incident. 
 Many observers fear that a lasting backlash is inevitable 
and will provoke further security clampdowns that generate 
further violence in the South.  Some fear a watershed 
hardening of Muslim attitudes that will attract outside 
radical groups that have apparently not been involved in 
Southern violence to date.  It remains to be seen how the 
majority of Thai non-Muslims will react, but many of our 
contacts have expressed shock at the tragedy and sympathy for 
fellow citizens who died after participating in a 
demonstration entirely within their constitutional rights.

1.  (C) Summary/Comment:  As Thailand moves towards general 
elections in February 2005, Post believes, along with many 
local political observers, that barring a dramatic attack 
outside the southernmost Muslim provinces, the current level 
of violence in the south -- and the Royal Thai Government\'s 
(RTG) handling of it -- will not affect Prime Minister 
Thaksin\'s likely reelection.  First, most Thais remain either 
indifferent to the south or even supportive of the 
government\'s hard-line position, so Thaksin\'s posture will 
not lose him votes nationwide.  Thaksin can use the success 
and popularity of his economic policies plus nationalistic 
feelings in order to rally his non-South base for victory. 
Second, Thaksin won handily last time without much support in 
the Muslim southern provinces, and failure to make hoped-for 
inroads into the Democrat Party (DP) electoral southern 
stronghold this time will not significantly harm his overall 
reelection chances.  Post will report separately on speeches 
made by the King and Queen on the southern situation in 
recent days and their increasingly high-profile role in 
publicly calling for peace and unity.  End Summary/Comment 
 
THE SOUTH WON\'T HURT THAKSIN IN THE ELECTION 
 
2.  (C)  To date the South does not appear to be a central 
issue that will significantly lessen Thaksin\'s electoral 
prospects or threaten his grip on power, despite the fact 
that political observers and the media generally agree that 
southern violence is the most high profile domestic issue. 
Despite daily criticism directed at Thaksin and his southern 
policies by some of the major Bangkok media outlets, the 
impression of many observers is that the majority of Thai 
voters will still support Thaksin when it comes time to vote 
in the February 2005 national elections. 
 
3.  (C)  Academic Amat Sombun, who lives in the southern 
province of Pattani, told the Embassy that he believes that 
the current violence has not greatly affected Thaksin\'s 
overall support in Thailand, and would likely have little 
impact on the prospects of Thaksin\'s Thai Rak Thai (TRT) 
party even in the south.  Amat noted that in the southernmost 
Muslim majority provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat, 5 
incumbent MPs (all Muslim members of the \"Vadha\" -- which 
means \"unity\" in Arabic -- faction) will  run again under the 
banner of TRT.  He feels that TRT has a good chance of at 
least maintaining those seats. 
 
4.  (C)  Thirapat Serirangsan, the Dean of the Political 
Science school at Sukhothai University, agreed with this 
analysis.  He told the Embassy that while the situation in 
the south will prevent TRT gains at the expense of the DP in 
the Muslim majority provinces, TRT will win comfortably on a 
nationwide basis. 
 
5.  (C) Among the large number of Thai voters in the north 
and northeast regions, the problems of the south remain 
distant, both literally and figuratively.  Much closer to 
home for northeastern voters are Thaksin\'s many populist 
economic measures targeted towards rural voters, such as debt 
restructuring for farmers, which remain extremely popular. 
And for many other Thais increasing prosperity, reflected by 
Thailand\'s quickly growing economy (6.8 percent in 2003 and 
an estimated rate of 5.5 - 6 percent this year), is the most 
important factor in the election. 
 
POLITICS REMAIN LOCAL 
 
6.  (C)  Science Minister Korn Dabbaransi told Poloff on 
November 10 that outside of the three affected southern 
provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, most Thais in the 
other 73 provinces were \"indifferent\" about the situation in 
that region.  Korn opined that for most Thai voters, the 
issues of jobs, medical care and housing would supersede the 
very real security concerns of their counterparts in the 
southern provinces. 
 
7.  (C)  Even among prominent Muslim-Thai politicians there 
is an understanding that events in the south are unlikely to 
stop Thaksin from being reelected in an overwhelming fashion. 
 Muslim Senator Den Tomina, an opposition politician whose 
late father is regarded as a martyr and icon of the Pattani 
independence movement -- and who himself has been accused of 
being sympathetic to today\'s militant Muslim separatists -- 
told Poloffs that Thaksin had told him confidently and 
personally that the southern situation \"will not impact 
voters in other regions.\"  Den said he agreed with Thaksin\'s 
analysis.  Den noted that for the majority of voters across 
Thailand, especially those in northern rural areas, Thaksin\'s 
\"populist\" economic policies were much more important than 
his southern strategy. 
 
MANY THAIS SUPPORT A TOUGH APPROACH TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
 
8.  (C)  Thais in Bangkok often express indifference to, or 
even approval of tough government tactics in the south. 
While some are sensitive to a backlash effect from blundering 
by Thai authorities (such as at Kru Se Mosque and Tak Bai), 
many Thais actually want the government to take a harder line 
towards \"troublemakers\" in the south who have assassinated 
state authorities and innocent Buddhist victims.  We don\'t 
have an empirical measure on how widespread these feelings 
really are, but anecdotal evidence suggests that many Thais 
are supportive of a tough policy; on the street, Bangkok 
Thais have been heard using derogatory terms when speaking 
about \"ungrateful\" southern Muslims; taxi drivers talk about 
the need for a \"tough leader to take care of these problems 
in South;\" even an MFA official, who spoke in confidence, 
said \"the feeling even here among many of my colleagues is 
that if the southerners don\'t want to be Thais, well...screw 
them.\" 
 
9.  (U)  Recent polling data by INR (reftels A, B) seems to 
support this anecdotal evidence.  Sample surveys taken before 
the October 25 incident at Tak Bai show that the majority of 
urban Thais approve of the way the government is handling the 
situation in the south, and the way the government approaches 
terrorism.  This data tracks with surveys conducted after the 
Krue Se mosque incident in late April of this year by 
Rajabhat Suan Dusit University where most respondents said 
they supported a strong policy towards the South. 
 
10. (C)  Prominent Muslim-Thai observers have noticed similar 
trends.  Dr. Charan Malulim, a prominent Muslim academic and 
member of the official investigation commission into the 
October 25 Tak Bai incident, told the Embassy that he is 
frightened by strong negative sentiment and growing anger 
among Buddhist Thais towards southern Muslims.  He believes 
that the effect of the attacks by southern militants on 
symbols of Thai authority has been to bring out strong 
nationalistic feelings among the Buddhist majority.  He 
suggested that the tabloid media is encouraging this 
sentiment. 
 
11. (C) While we have no hard evidence that the Prime 
Minister is cynically manipulating reaction to the southern 
situation this way, Thaksin can use this apparent growing 
resentment among some Thai Buddhists, which increases with 
each attack against symbols of Thai authority or Buddhist 
civilians, to play on strong Thai nationalist sentiment and 
rally voters around him and TRT because they look like 
attacks on \"Thailand.\"  This may be why he refuses to 
officially \"apologize\" for Tak Bai and the unnecessary deaths 
that took place when detainees were transported from there on 
October 25.  Of concern, however, is that this refusal to 
apologize -- which undermines his credibility with Muslims -- 
plays into the hands of the ill-defined group of Muslim 
militant \"separatists\" who are bent on increasing general 
support among the populations of the Muslim majority 
provinces of the south. 
 
COMMENT:  DESPITE THE SOUTH...LOOKS LIKE FOUR MORE YEARS 
 
12.  (C)  Comment:  Thaksin has faced serious criticism 
internationally and domestically over his handling of the 
violence in southern Thailand.  This criticism, along with 
the growing public concern -- mainly that it will spread 
North -- about the problem, makes the south one important 
domestic issue with the potential to erode his general 
popularity.  That said, it doesn\'t appear that the crisis has 
undermined Thaksin\'s administration sufficiently to threaten 
his broader dominance of Thai politics.  As noted above, the 
general voting public, beyond the Bangkok chattering classes 
and media, continues to support Thaksin and his southern 
policy.  That support, coupled with the apparent desire by 
many Thais for Thaksin to take a security-weighted line in 
the south, means that Thaksin can probably continue the 
government\'s ineffective (and, in the longer term, possibly 
counter-productive) policies vis-a-vis the south without 
serious national political consequences. 
 
13.  (C)  The wild card factor would be a dramatic attack on 
a major metropolitan or tourist area before the election.  In 
such a situation, voters could turn on Thaksin, blaming him 
for failing to \"protect us.\"  However, given the public\'s 
mood and Thaksin\'s ability to play on nationalist sentiment, 
the public might just as likely rally around the prime 
minister, and support even stronger and one-sided government 
countermeasures following such an attack. 
14.  (C)  Few would deny that political problems stemming 
from the deteriorating situation in the deep South have 
embarrassed Thaksin\'s administration at a certain level: 
policy approaches appear ineffective and insincere; the 
Bangkok press and opposition Democrats highlight his failures 
to curb violence; and there is growing negative international 
attention to the situation in the South, highlighted by 
recoil from the handling of the events of April 28 and 
October 25.  For most Thais, however, these factors will not 
be as important as popular economic programs and nationalist 
sentiment when it comes time to vote in the national 
elections.  The deep South\'s travails will not likely derail 
Thaksin\'s reelection.  End Comment

 (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary.  In public remarks about his December 9 
meeting in Rangoon with SPDC Chairman Than Shwe and other 
Burmese leaders, PM Thaksin said that he found \"reasonable 
and convincing\" their assessment of the challenges they face 
from ethnic minorities, and seemed to imply that he also 
accepted their explanation of why they continue to keep NLD 
leader Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) under house arrest.  MFA 
official Damrong Kraikruan, who took notes in the PM\'s 
meeting, told us that he doubted that Thaksin intended to 
leave such an impression about ASSK\'s continued detention. 
Damrong\'s readout of the Thaksin-Than Shwe discussion 
emphasized that Thaksin had raised ASSK\'s detention and was 
firm in delivering the international community\'s message that 
the SPDC must move towards dialogue and \"real democracy.\" 
Thaksin reportedly engaged the Burmese in a general 
discussion about democracy, and was told that the SPDC would 
pursue its Road Map.  End Summary. 
 
THAKSIN\'S RADIO ADDRESS ON HIS VISIT TO BURMA 
 
2. (SBU) PM Thaksin used part of his regular December 11 
radio address to comment on his meeting two days before in 
Rangoon with SPDC Chairman Than Shwe and other Burmese 
leaders (see para 10 below for text).  He spoke 
extemporaneously, recounting that he told the Burmese he did 
not want to interfere in their domestic affairs, but also 
stating that he had conveyed concerns of Western democratic 
countries about Burma\'s need to shift to a democratic path. 
After summarizing part of the Burmese response, Thaksin noted 
that he asked about ASSK\'s detention and then paraphrased 
responses by Than Shwe and Vice Chairman Maung Aye claiming 
that \"chaos\" had followed her previous releases and stressing 
that the SPDC faced dangerous threats to Burma\'s national 
unity from numerous \"ethnic minorities.\"  Thaksin, claiming 
his own experience with \"these movements,\" said he found the 
Burmese reasoning both \"reasonable and convincing,\" a 
statement which many interpreted as \"endorsing\" the SPDC 
leadership\'s explanation of its decision to extend ASSK\'s 
house arrest.  That was certainly the interpretation put on 
Thaksin\'s remarks by the English-language Bangkok Post 
newspaper, which ran a December 12 front-page article 
claiming that Thaksin had said he \"found Burma\'s reasons for 
keeping opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest 
convincing.\"  (Note:  Thaksin did not make a direct statement 
along these lines in his remarks.  End Note.) 
 
MFA OFFICIAL PROVIDES CONFIDENTIAL READOUT ON THAKSIN-THAN 
SHWE MEETING 
 
3. (C) MFA official Damrong Kraikruan, the only Thai official 
besides PM Thaksin and FM Surakiart to sit in (as notetaker) 
on the Rangoon meeting with Than Shwe and other SPDC leaders, 
gave Polcouns a readout on December 13.  Asked about the 
Prime Minister\'s radio address and the Bangkok Post article, 
Damrong claimed that Thaksin had been roughly relating the 
assessment by both Than Shwe and Maung Aye of the dangers 
they felt they faced from ethnic minorities.  He said that 
Thaksin had indeed been impressed by the passion and 
sincerity with which both top SPDC leaders had repeatedly 
made this argument.  Damrong added that, in his view, the 
Prime Minister was endorsing only that part of the SPDC 
\"reasoning\" and that it was a misinterpretation of his 
remarks to claim that he was also agreeing that ASSK\'s 
continued house arrest was justified. 
 
4. (C) Asked for specifics on the exchanges, Damrong said 
that Thaksin had raised ASSK\'s detention and that Than Shwe, 
speaking in Burmese, had complained that ASSK never 
compromised and said that, as a politician, one should know 
that it was \"impossible to work with her.\"  Damrong said that 
Than Shwe had then launched into an argument (reportedly 
repeated 3 times) -- and joined vigorously by Maung Aye -- 
that Burma was tired of the \"chaos\" that followed each of 
ASSK\'s previous releases as Burma\'s many ethnic minorities 
who want to \"separate\" from Burma tried to take advantage of 
opportunities presented.  Than Shwe and Maung Aye said, 
according to Damrong, that the SPDC had to keep Burma united 
and prevent it from being torn apart by the ethnic minorities. 
 
5. (C) Damrong said that PM Thaksin had also tried to engage 
Than Shwe on the need for democratization and, in a situation 
of \"globalization,\" the need for Burma to listen to the rest 
of the world and to explain its actions, \"or nobody will 
understand.\"  Damrong said that Thaksin spoke of the 
international community\'s call for genuine political dialogue 
and reconciliation, and said that it should not be ignored. 
He also told the Burmese that Thailand was ready to assist 
\"if Myanmar (Burma) is open about the process.\"  Damrong said 
that a specific \"Bangkok Process\" meeting was not mentioned. 
 
6. (C) Damrong said that Thaksin had noted that, in order to 
obtain the confidence of the international community, Burma 
did not have to stick to a particular form of democracy as 
\"democracy comes in many forms.\"  The Prime Minister had 
added, Damrong said, that the important thing was that the 
form was \"really democratic.\"  Pressed on what Than Shwe and 
Maung Aye said in response, Damrong said they seemed to agree 
with the point but said they intended to move forward on 
their Road Map, including reconvening the National Convention 
in February, 2005.  They claimed to have invited ASSK and the 
National League for Democracy (NLD) to participate, despite 
her \"denials.\"  (Note:  Per Embassy Rangoon, ASSK actually 
refused to participate in the May 2004 National Convention on 
SPDC terms, and has not been invited to the upcoming National 
Convention.  End Note.)  Damrong said that the Burmese 
leaders had even claimed they were \"building democracy,\" 
although he noted that Than Shwe had twice used the term 
\"guided democracy.\" 
 
7. (C) Asked for Thai conclusions about the results of the 
Thaksin-Than Shwe meeting, Damrong said that the Thai Prime 
Minister had \"delivered the international community\'s 
message,\" but he (Damrong) felt that the main Burmese 
response was negative:  \"(Rangoon) has no willingness to free 
ASSK.\"  They will go ahead with the Road Map.  He said that 
the discussion on bilateral issues was \"mixed.\"  However, 
Maung Aye, who Damrong confirmed was \"unusually talkative, 
perhaps reflecting a new status in the top leadership,\" had 
been enthusiastic about increasing tourism.  The Burmese had 
also agreed that constructing the road through Burma from 
Thailand to India should continue.  Thaksin, Damrong said, 
had sought tighter Burmese measures against drugs and had 
been pleased that Than Shwe and Maung Aye both said they were 
trying to be responsive to his request for arrest of two 
specific drug figures.  Damrong said that Thaksin had 
mentioned in passing to Than Shwe that Thailand hoped to see 
resumption of the SPDC-KNU negotiations, and had discussed 
this subject in more depth with PM Soe Win. 
 
8. (SBU) Damrong said that the Burmese side in this meeting 
had started out larger but was cut down to the \"top five\" 
SPDC leaders, including Than Shwe, Maung Aye, Soe Win, 
Secretary 1 Thein Sein, and General Thura Shwe Mann.  PM 
 
SIPDIS 
Thaksin had limited the Thai participants to three:  himself, 
FM Surakiart, and Damrong as notetaker. 
 
9. (C) Comment:  PM Thaksin and FM Surakiart, the architects 
of Thai policy towards Burma, continue to try to keep a 
balance between their \"constructive engagement\" approach to 
Rangoon -- which they see as the best means to resolve unique 
Thai-Burmese cross-border problems -- and their desire for 
credibility with the U.S. and other countries concerned about 
SPDC repression.  During Ambassador Johnson\'s December 8 
farewell call on FM Surakiart, the Foreign Minister went out 
of his way to preview that Thaksin would raise \"hard issues\" 
with Than Shwe, including the release of ASSK and political 
dialogue and democratization issues.  By all accounts, the 
Thais believe that Thaksin did, in Damrong\'s phrase, \"deliver 
the international community\'s message.\"  But it also comes 
through in the accounts of Thai diplomats in Rangoon (Ref A) 
and that of Damrong that Thaksin\'s exchanges with the SPDC 
were not as forceful and we would have liked.  End Comment. 
 
TEXT OF PM THAKSIN\'S BURMA COMMENTS IN HIS DECEMBER 11 RADIO 
ADDRESS 
 
10. (U)  Text source is a Thai language text provided by the 
Public Relations Department, Office of the Prime Minister, 
from a tape of the address.  Translation from the Thai 
language by Embassy Bangkok.  Begin Text: 
 
\"On Thursday, December 9, I traveled to Myanmar (Burma) to 
attend the Fourth World Buddhist Summit in Rangoon.  The 
Laotian Prime Minister also attended.  I arrived there at 
0800 hours and departed at 1430 hours on the same day. 
 
I had discussions with Burmese leaders.  I met with Senior 
General Than Shwe, Chairman of the SPDC.  Vice Senior General 
Maung Aye was also present, together with Prime Minister Lt. 
General Soe Win, Lt. General Thein Sein, and other SPDC 
officials, who attended the meeting briefly. 
 
Foreign Minister Surakiart joined me in the talks.  Our 
discussion was a good, sincere, and straight-forward exchange 
on many issues. 
 
I opened the discussion by telling them that, since we 
(Thailand and Burma) are neighbors, and if you are confident 
in my sincerity toward the Burmese people and the Government 
of Burma over the past four years, I urge you to talk about 
all topics in a straight-forward manner.  I have the 
etiquette not to intervene in your domestic matters.  But I 
am expected by international community to push the Government 
of Burma for a shift to a path towards democracy at the 
soonest moment.  I thus have to do this properly.  While I 
will not interfere in your domestic matters, at the same time 
I must convey the concerns of Western democratic countries 
for you to hear, so that you will consider what you should or 
should not do. 
 
The subsequent exchange was sincere on many issues.  I am 
able to recount some of what was discussed, but not 
everything. 
 
The Burmese insist, first, that they will not retreat. 
Second, they said they are moving ahead on the seven 
proposals in their Road Map towards democracy, as they have 
outlined them.  They will hold the Second National Council 
Convention in February.  Moreover, they informed me that they 
had invited Aung San Suu Kyi (ASSK) to participate, but ASSK 
subsequently denied having ever been invited.  (Embassy Note: 
 As in para 6 above, this appears to be a reference to ASSK\'s 
refusal to participate in the May 2004 National Convention on 
SPDC terms, and not to any invitation to the planned February 
National Council Convention.  PM Thaksin and the Thai MFA 
apparently did not catch the nuances.  End Note.) 
 
I then asked them about the continued detention of ASSK. 
They said ASSK was released three times.  But whenever she 
was released, the country fell into chaos.  They said that 
one should feel sympathy for Burma.  They said their country 
has over 130 minority groups, with some areas having as many 
as 33 ethnic groups living in them.  If order (i.e. security) 
is not properly set up in advance, they believe that the 
leaders of these many ethnic groups will declare themselves 
to be president or other title of leadership, leading to a 
breakup of Burma.  Burma, in their view, will be disorderly, 
with nothing left of unity.  Thus, their goal is to maintain 
respect for the integrity of Burma. 
 
This is their reasoning, which is reasonable and convincing 
(to me) since I am familiar with many aspects of these 
movements.  The Burmese have been making many efforts.  So, 
we (Thailand) try to push for the soonest reconciliation.  In 
our view, when our neighbor has peace and prosperity, 
Thailand will also have peace.  If they can\'t achieve it, 
Thailand is impacted by their problems. 
 
For example, we now have over one million Burmese migrant 
workers in Thailand, a matter on which Burma has cooperated 
well. 
 
I also talked over other issues in the bilateral 
relationship.  One topic was tourism, an area in which the 
Burmese are willing to welcome our investment and 
development.  A second was the highway connecting Thailand, 
Burma, and India, which they are willing to continue to work 
on.  Third is the Burmese workers in Thailand.  They are 
willing to send their officials here to prove the citizenship 
of those workers in order for issuance of legal documents for 
them, which would allow the workers to continue at their jobs 
for another period of time.  Eventually, a Burmese worker 
quota will be introduced. 
 
We also discussed narcotics suppression, an issue on which 
they have cooperated well over the past two years, and will 
continue to do so.  I asked them specifically about two bad 
men living in Burma named Bang Ron and Wei Sei Kang.  The 
Burmese said they have already ordered their regional 
commanders to look into this matter.  If the two men are 
found to be living in Burma, they will get them.  So these 
two guys have to find a new place to live.

STATE PASS TO USTR FOR A/USTR BWEISEL 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETRD, ECON, PREL, TH, US-Thai FTA 
SUBJECT: U.S.-THAILAND FTA: STATUS AND PROSPECTS 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1.  (SBU)  The November 22 announcement by the Thai lead 
negotiator that the RTG was seeking a postponement of the 
December 2004 FTA round was the culmination of several 
complex crosscurrents within the RTG and Thai society.  The 
ostensible reason for the postponement, the upcoming 
(February 6) elections, is genuinely believed by some senior 
officials, as is the need for additional time for 
preparation, but is probably the least important element of 
the whole story.  Key elements within the RTG are 
dissatisfied with the comprehensiveness of the U.S. 
negotiating framework, particularly its inclusion of labor, 
environment, and financial services, as well as the emphasis 
on negative lists in services and investment.  Key private 
sector organizations, notably the Thai Bankers Association, 
also have voiced their objections to U.S. requests. The 
prospective U.S. offer has disappointed some here, especially 
in areas such as temporary entry.  The RTG currently is split 
into two camps on how to proceed: the first, led by Finance 
Minister Somkid and Chief Economic Adviser Pansak, argues for 
a go-slow, narrowly focused market access agenda; the second, 
led by lead FTA negotiator Nitya (who is allied with Foreign 
Minister Surakiart), favors a faster, more comprehensive 
approach, arguing that such an FTA would transform and 
modernize the Thai economy.  They also stress the high costs 
of non-participation as other countries pursue FTAs with the 
U.S. 
 
2. (SBU)  Resolution of this debate awaits the February 
elections.  Our opportunity for input is limited, although we 
may be able to make our negotiating framework more attractive 
here by emphasizing benefits to small and medium sized 
enterprises, a politically favored sector of the Thai 
economy.  In spite of the delay and internal RTG 
soul-searching, we remain basically optimistic about the 
FTA\'s prospects because we don\'t see how either side\'s 
fundamental interests in having an FTA have changed.  For the 
U.S., it is our best chance to maintain a favored trading and 
investment position with Thailand that is jeopardized by 
several imminent developments.  Equally important, an FTA 
will be transformational for Thailand, effecting a shift in 
many of its governmental institutions towards a more 
rules-based economy.  That will be good for Thailand, good 
for the U.S., and will serve as a positive precedent for the 
many other developing economies which are weighing economic 
development and trade policy options.  In asking for a 
comprehensive, transformational FTA with the U.S., we are 
asking Thailand to do something unprecedented, something that 
it will find very hard.  Negotiations are likely to take some 
time.  Progress could prove non-linear, with periods of rapid 
movement forward, followed by some regression, a hiatus, and 
repetitions of this cycle.  It will require patience, 
determination, and judgment, with no guarantee of success. 
But we believe it is worth the considerable effort likely to 
be required.  End Summary. 
 
FTA TALKS PUT ON HOLD 
 
3. (SBU) On November 22, the RTG\'s chief negotiator announced 
that his government was proposing to the USG that the FTA 
negotiating round scheduled for the week of December 13 be 
postponed.  The reasons he cited for the request were the 
upcoming Thai national elections (currently scheduled for 
February 6, 2005), and the need for additional time to 
prepare for further talks with the U.S.  This announcement 
was pursuant to a decision made the previous day by the RTG\'s 
newly created FTA Oversight Committee.  In addition to the 
postponement request, the Committee ordered the relevant 
agencies to further study the major issues in the FTA and 
provide recommendations on a future course of action. 
 
4. (SBU) While the explanations publicly provided by the lead 
RTG negotiator are undoubtedly genuine, no one here believes 
they represent the complete story -- or even the primary 
story -- behind the postponement request.  Rather, the 
postponement was the culmination of several complex 
crosscurrents within the RTG and Thai society. 
 
THE ELECTIONS 
 
5. (SBU) Prime Minister Thaksin\'s Thai Rak Thai Party and its 
allies have gone into full campaign mode for the February 6 
national elections, and all other issues are being viewed 
through the election prism.  It is an unfortunate fact that 
public sentiment concerning Thailand\'s several free trade 
initiatives is almost entirely negative.  Perhaps the most 
talked about trade deal is Thailand\'s \"early harvest\" tranche 
of the ongoing FTA talks with China.  While the early harvest 
provisions contain significant benefits for prospective Thai 
exporters to China, press coverage has centered almost 
entirely on increased imports of Chinese onions and garlic, 
and resulting depressed prices for Thai farmers in this 
sector.  (We have yet to see a mass media article that 
mentions any increase in consumer welfare due to lower food 
prices.) 
 
6. (SBU) Against this backdrop, the U.S.-Thai FTA talks are 
regarded by the RTG as a potential political liability best 
avoided in an election campaign.  From the perspective of the 
RTG, the only way the FTA talks with the U.S. could have been 
a useful campaign tool would have been an early harvest 
component which contained some attractive market access 
improvements for Thai exporters.  The U.S. preference for a 
single undertaking that addresses substantially all trade and 
investment barriers meant that there would be no pre-election 
\"presents\" for Thailand (and the Thai Rak Thai party).  Once 
that fact was recognized by PM Thaksin and the relevant RTG 
ministries, support for a pre-election negotiating round 
largely evaporated. 
 
7. (SBU) But we don\'t accept the claim that the postponement 
request is all about -- or even primarily about -- an 
exogenous factor like the elections.  For one thing, trade 
policy, while recently controversial and a political 
negative, is not a big vote-mover here.  Many issues 
overshadow it.  For another, Thailand\'s FTA talks with Japan 
are about as controversial here as those with the U.S., and 
yet the previously scheduled FTA talks with that country, 
scheduled for the week of December 6 in Bangkok, have gone 
ahead (and with very little media scrutiny).  We doubt the 
December 13 FTA talks with the U.S. in remote Hawaii would 
have generated much in the way of media attention here. 
 
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PREPARATION TIME 
 
8. (SBU) There is no question that the RTG has found itself 
ill prepared for negotiations with the U.S.  The belated 
formation (in early November, five months after the start of 
negotiations) of the RTG\'s FTA Oversight Committee (chaired 
by Finance Minister Somkid) is, in part, a belated 
recognition that more work on positions has to be done, 
especially in (but not limited to) labor, environment, and 
financial services (the Committee\'s creation is also partly 
motivated by internal power struggles within the RTG -- para 
15).  One of our working level contacts in the Ministry of 
Commerce said, \"If you look at the guys on our (the RTG\'s) 
labor and environment teams, you can see right away that they 
are not prepared to negotiate anything.\"  A Labor Ministry 
source said that as of late November, his ministry had yet to 
complete translating into Thai the text presented by the U.S. 
in the October FTA round. 
 
9. (SBU)  But like the elections, we don\'t accept that the 
need for greater preparation time is the major reason for the 
postponement.  Only a minority of the negotiating groups were 
faced with serious preparation related obstacles that would, 
arguably, delay further meetings.  Preparation for 90 percent 
of the negotiating groups would have been advanced by the 
December talks, since the talks would have provided 
opportunities for information exchange, clarification of 
positions, and so forth.  It is evident that factors other 
than the need for additional time for preparation played a 
role in the postponement. 
 
\"REQUEST SHOCK\" 
 
10. (SBU)  While the RTG thought that it had done its 
homework in preparation for the FTA talks with the U.S., it 
has found out that much more remains to be done.  The RTG -- 
or at least many of its key officials -- were seemingly 
caught off guard by the scope and depth of U.S. requests in 
many areas.  These areas include labor; environment; 
financial services.  When we express our astonishment to RTG 
officials at their surprise at the U.S. agenda (after all, 
the U.S. must rank as the most transparent country in the 
world in terms of negotiating goals in our trade relations -- 
our complete negotiating agenda has been available on the 
Internet for several months prior to the start of 
negotiations), they respond that 1) the full impact and 
ramifications of the U.S. requests had not been fully 
appreciated; and 2) not all RTG officials had been fully 
briefed in advance on the U.S. negotiating position.  A 
prominent official that probably falls into this category is 
the Prime Minister; while he is a supporter of an FTA with 
the U.S. -- indeed, he claims authorship of the idea -- he is 
probably unaware of what its contents are likely to be.  All 
indications are that he has been caught off guard by the 
overall U.S. request list, and is disappointed that the U.S. 
is unwilling to negotiate a quick and politically attractive 
\"early harvest\" package.  (Note: We believe the RTG\'s \"early 
harvest\" plan for the FTA with the U.S. largely involved 
formally renewing key provisions (Articles 4 and 10) of the 
U.S.-Thailand Treat of Amity and Economic Relations.) 
 
\"LITTLE DEALS WITH BIG COUNTRIES\" 
 
11. (SBU)  Seen through Thai eyes, the U.S. requests suffer 
from comparison with the other recent trade deals Thailand 
has concluded.  Many of these deals lack (at least for now) 
comprehensive market opening substance, opting instead for 
relatively easy \"early harvests.\"  This is the case for both 
China and India.  Even the FTA with Australia is fairly 
slow-pitch: aside from reductions in goods tariffs, very 
little was accomplished.  By comparison, the breadth of the 
FTA with the U.S. is wildly ambitious -- maybe too ambitious 
for some.  One knowledgeable local observer said, \"Thaksin 
wants little deals with big countries; they make good 
headlines without causing too much trouble.\" 
 
 
\"OFFER SHOCK\" 
 
12. (SBU)  The RTG has also had to review its strong desire 
for a temporary entry chapter (or at least strong temporary 
entry provisions as part of a services chapter) in the FTA. 
The desire for a U.S. visa is strong in Thailand (the U.S. 
has long been the country of choice for education, for 
example); one of the strongest appeals of the U.S.-Thailand 
Treaty of Amity and Economic relations are the reciprocal 
preferential visa provisions.  We believe the RTG has been 
counting on reaffirming and perhaps upgrading this provision 
as a big part of its public sales campaign for the FTA. 
Adding insult to injury is the inclusion of temporary entry 
chapters in the Chile and -- most importantly -- Singapore 
FTAs.  Thailand\'s rivalry with the latter country is an 
important reason behind the RTG\'s persistence in asking for 
temporary entry provisions.  Lead Thai negotiator Nitya 
recently cited the temporary entry provisions negotiated in 
the U.S. FTA with Singapore in wondering aloud to the 
Ambassador whether an FTA without temporary entry provisions 
would be acceptable to the RTG.  He said, \"Of course, it 
isn\'t my call, but you know what the Old Colonel (PM Thaksin) 
thinks about Singapore.\"  We believe the RTG\'s basic position 
on somehow addressing temporary entry is inflexible, and as 
such is probably one of a handful of issues that falls 
outside the normal give and take of the negotiating process. 
In the absence of some treatment of temporary entry in some 
context (not necessarily within the FTA), we question whether 
the RTG will agree to an FTA. 
 
13. (SBU)  The RTG hopes that the post-U.S. election climate 
will be more amenable to the discussion of temporary entry. 
In noting that the President\'s party has strengthened its 
majority in Congress, some officials here are hopeful that 
the U.S. may re-think its position on temporary entry and 
trade agreements.  In arguing for a delay in further FTA 
talks, the Prime Minister\'s chief economic adviser, Dr. 
Pansak Vanyaratyn, asked the Embassy\'s Economic Counselor, 
\"Why don\'t we wait until both of our governments have a 
mandate?\"  The \"mandate\" Pansak probably was referring to in 
the case of the U.S. was a reconsideration of our position on 
excluding temporary entry from trade agreements. 
 
PRIVATE SECTOR OPPOSITION 
 
14. (SBU) The corporate elites of Thai society are viewed by 
many here as highly insecure.  \"They don\'t see any 
opportunities in liberalization, only the loss of privilege,\" 
one source told us.  While there is considerable truth in 
this statement, we think it is somewhat exaggerated; in 
reality, private views are mixed.  In general, the Federation 
of Thai Industry (which accounts for much of the 
manufacturing sector here) generally is supportive of the 
FTA.  Opposition to the FTA is centered in the Thai Bankers 
Association and large swathes of the Thai Chamber of 
Commerce.  These are powerful organizations, and they no 
doubt have made their voices heard. 
 
INTER-MINISTERIAL CONFLICT 
 
15. (SBU)  Long simmering differences over policy and 
jurisdiction boiled over in the November 21 FTA Oversight 
Committee meeting that called for the December round\'s 
postponement.  Far from being resolved, these differences 
could become sharper in the coming months.  Normally (and by 
law), trade negotiations are led by the Ministry of Commerce. 
 For the U.S. FTA, the Foreign Ministry has the lead.  Lead 
Thai FTA negotiator Nitya has the title of Adviser to the 
Foreign Minister.  This is not a very powerful position.  The 
Chair of the FTA Oversight Committee is Finance Minister 
Somkid.  Somkid is a politically powerful Cabinet minister (a 
coterie of MPs owe him allegiance); he is thought to be a 
leading proponent of the skeptical, \"go-slow\" school 
regarding the FTA with the U.S., favoring a narrow agenda 
that focuses on traditional market access issues.  His major 
ally on the FTA Oversight Committee is Dr. Pansak.  This pair 
have found common cause in blocking Nitya\'s plans for the 
FTA, which included the December negotiating round.  Nitya 
(allied with FM Surakiart) favors a full speed ahead, 
comprehensive FTA agenda.  In terms of both institutional and 
personal political power, this pair easily outguns Nitya. 
This intra-governmental conflict could continue -- and even 
worsen -- beyond the February elections. 
 
16. (SBU) At the inaugural November 22 meeting of the RTG\'s 
newly created FTA Oversight Committee, the various themes of 
the several dissenting factions -- those concerned over the 
elections, inadequate preparations, \"request shock\", or 
\"offer shock,\"  -- came together, finding common cause in a 
call to stop forward progress on the FTA pending a 
reassessment of the entire FTA exercise.  Most observers here 
think the FTA talks will be re-started after the elections, 
but such an eventuality awaits a formal decision to that 
effect by the FTA Oversight Committee. 
 
POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS 
 
17. (SBU)  Frustrated by the proliferation of ill-informed 
FTA oversight committees (we currently count four that play 
some role in the FTA) and his inability to chart the course 
of the FTA talks, Nitya is lobbying to be given the title of 
Thai Trade Representative.  This can be designated a Cabinet 
level position, and would give him a fighting chance of 
regaining control over the FTA agenda.  We understand a 
decision regarding this is not likely until after the 
elections.  Everyone here thinks that Thaksin\'s Thai Rak Thai 
party and its allies will win handily, probably increasing 
their majority in the lower house of parliament.  If the 
post-election Minister of Commerce is a politically powerful 
figure, it is possible that Commerce may seek to assert its 
leadership in the U.S.-Thai FTA talks.  In that case, 
Commerce probably would resist increasing Nitya\'s power, and 
the latter could find his position untenable.  But, while a 
Commerce takeover of the talks could spell trouble for Nitya, 
it might not be all bad for the FTA; what is needed to drive 
negotiations forward is 1) strong commitment 2) from a 
powerful figure.  A new Commerce Minister might prove just 
the ticket.  In this regard, we find it significant that the 
Commerce-led FTA talks with both India and China continue to 
move forward, while the MFA-led FTA talks with the U.S. and 
Japan have been delayed. 
 
18. (SBU) Somkid and Pansak are thought to be dissatisfied 
with both the U.S. negotiating framework and (derivatively) 
proposed pace of the FTA negotiations.  Somkid (seconded by 
Pansak) has described the negotiating mandate set forth in 
U.S. Trade Promotion Authority legislation as negotiating 
\"pre-conditions,\" (they count 17 such TPA pre-conditions in 
total) and as such undermine the RTG\'s desire for both sides 
to negotiate from a clean slate.  They also object (in 
varying degrees) to various U.S. positions (as cited in paras 
10-12).  Their initial response has been to halt the talks, 
albeit temporarily.   Somkid and Pansak surely have the 
support of PM Thaksin, at least for now.  Said one long time 
Thai observer, \"This is a classic Thai response to being 
pushed faster or farther than they want to go; they step 
back.\" 
 
19. (SBU) But the temporary delay is only a tactical move; we 
think major strategic decisions have been deferred until 
after the February elections.  Foreign Minister Surakiart 
recently told the Ambassador, \"We have a mandate to pursue 
these talks after the elections,\" and vowed to resume talks 
once \"the necessary parliamentary and legal processes are 
complete.\"  Surakiart added that he had made these points to 
U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick during the recent APEC 
meeting in Santiago, Chile.  The full speed ahead school, 
which includes FM Surakiart, have been arguing that with the 
proliferation of FTAs, the costs of non-participation are 
likely to be very high. 
 
20. (SBU) In a separate meeting with the Ambassador, Finance 
Minister Somkid was somewhat less encouraging, telling the 
Ambassador, \"We will not do anything we cannot explain to the 
Thai people.  After the elections, we will meet with our 
entire FTA team and look at every position; I think we can 
handle everything.\"  He then made an indirect pitch for an 
\"early harvest\" approach: he described a meeting he had with 
the lead Japanese FTA negotiator, where he had urged the 
Japanese to consider immediate FTA concessions, leaving other 
areas for later.  He concluded by saying, \"We need to be 
careful.  Many in Thai society are ready to be opposed to an 
FTA with the U.S.  We don\'t want to let that happen.\"  While 
he didn\'t spell out exactly how he proposed to avoid such an 
eventuality, the overall message seemed to be, \"Go slow, be 
moderate in your requests.\" 
 
21. (SBU) We find it significant that no RTG official has 
told us they are opposed to the FTA per se.  The opposition 
for now seems mostly short term and tactical.  We think there 
is a good chance that even hard core opponents of Nitya, such 
as Pansak, may change their tune after the elections; in 
Pansak\'s economic writings, he touts the modernizing effect 
of FTAs.  Whatever its short term political advantages may 
be, a narrow market access type of FTA will not yield much in 
the way of economic modernization. 
 
WHAT WE SHOULD DO 
 
22. (SBU)  While it is easy to be discouraged by some of the 
attitudes toward the FTA that are prevalent here, we see the 
current hiatus as a temporary setback that in no way alters 
the overall situation.  A Free Trade Agreement with Thailand 
clearly remains in our interest.  Usually, an FTA is designed 
to take bilateral relations to a new level.  In the case of 
Thailand, however, much of our motivation is the preservation 
of our current position.  The U.S. currently is Thailand\'s 
largest trading partner.  In investment, U.S. firms have 
privileged access to the Thai market under the Treaty of 
Amity and Economic Relations (AER).  But our status is 
imminently threatened by current trends.  In view of GATS MFN 
issues, we doubt the AER has much of a future as a 
stand-alone document.  The relentless rise of China\'s 
economic profile in this region represents a challenge to the 
U.S.\'s trade and investment leadership.  Additionally, 
Thailand is negotiating a number or other FTAs, which 
probably will create some trade diversion that disadvantages 
U.S. exporters.  Given these developments, without a new 
framework for our commercial relationship we will find it a 
challenge to maintain our current position. 
 
23. (SBU)  We also think pursuing an FTA is the right thing 
to do for reasons that go beyond maintaining our position 
here.  A close precedent to what we are trying to accomplish 
with our FTA with Thailand is the Mexico component of NAFTA. 
Like Mexico, Thailand is a medium-sized developing economy. 
Like Mexico, Thailand is essentially not a rules-based 
economy, relying, instead, to a great extent on personal, 
informal arrangements.  As envisioned by the U.S., our FTA 
with Thailand will effect a transformation within the Thai 
economy, by moving it towards a more rules-based, transparent 
way of conducting commerce.  Such a transformation will be 
hard to achieve; it will be much harder than anything 
Thailand is likely to ask the U.S. to do.  It is also a safe 
bet that, similar to the case with Mexico, that a 
comprehensive FTA will see Thailand make the vast majority of 
the concessions, since the vast majority of the existing 
trade and investment barriers are on the Thai side.  Leading 
RTG policy makers are aware of the transformational, 
modernizing potential of the FTA and, in their more visionary 
moments, cite that potential as the FTA\'s chief attraction. 
But, it is an open question whether the Thai Government or 
people are willing and capable of effecting such a 
transformation.  The chief architect of PM Thaksin\'s economic 
plan (\"Thaksinomics\"), Pansak Vanyaratyn, wrote, \"I am not 
sure we have the iron will to stay the course.  I am not 
certain that we, meaning, the Thai State or the Thai private 
sector, have the will or the stamina to complete the change 
that we have set in motion.\"  We share Dr. Pansak\'s 
uncertainty. 
 
24. (SBU)  While posing great challenges, the 
transformational potential of an FTA with Thailand is what 
makes it worthy of great effort on our part.  By helping 
Thailand move toward more rules-based, transparent, and 
efficient governance, an FTA with the U.S. will be the 
catalyst for much higher output and living standards in 
Thailand.  It will be a world showcase, serving as a positive 
precedent for the many other developing economies which are 
weighing economic development and trade policy options. 
 
25. (SBU)  Deciding on the future course of the FTA is 
largely a Thai question which eventually will be resolved by 
a debate within the Thai Government and society.  Our 
opportunity for input is limited.  As far as the U.S. 
management of the FTA negotiations goes, we don\'t have a lot 
of fine tuning to recommend since there are few, if any, 
complaints in this area.   On the contrary, Amb. Nitya has on 
several occasions publicly expressed his appreciation for the 
professionalism of the lead USTR negotiator. 
 
EMPHASIS ON SMEs COULD HELP 
 
26. (SBU)  The Thaksin Government has placed a heavy emphasis 
on small and medium sized businesses.  Following the 1997 
economic crisis, the RTG believed that the potential in SMEs 
and the traditional sector, given its great flexibility, 
diversity, and low import content, would provide a new source 
of economic growth and income.  The RTG has introduced a host 
of economic programs aimed at boosting this sector of the 
Thai economy, which already accounts for almost 40 percent of 
Thailand\'s GDP.  This sector also represents a core 
constituency of Thaksin\'s Thai Rak Thai party. 
 
26. (SBU)  Our FTA framework could be more attractive to the 
RTG if there was a greater emphasis on SMEs across the 
various negotiating groups.  This would mainly involve 
changes in formatting and emphasis, not new concessions.  RTG 
officials point out that an FTA that could be marketed in 
Thailand as an \"SME FTA\" would be a much easier sell to Thai 
public opinion (and would be much more attractive to PM 
Thaksin, whose exact position on the RTG\'s internal FTA 
debate remains uncertain).  Our nascent \"Group on Small and 
Medium Enterprises and Other Cooperation\" represents a good 
start; it is possible that other opportunities to emphasize 
SMEs could be identified and exploited in other negotiating 
areas.  For example, in the government procurement chapter it 
might be possible to highlight the small business set-aside 
provisions, and gear our efforts in trade capacity building 
toward this area.  It might be possible to enlist the aid of 
the U.S. Small Business Administration on this project. 
 
27. (SBU)  In spite of the delay and internal RTG 
soul-searching, we remain basically optimistic about the 
FTA\'s prospects because we don\'t see how anyone\'s fundamental 
interests in having an FTA have changed.  It is 
overwhelmingly in Thailand\'s interest to have an FTA with the 
U.S., whether one argues on the grounds of its 
transformational, modernizing effect; the high costs of 
non-participation; market access; strategic alliances; or 
some combination of these.  An FTA with Thailand remains 
overwhelmingly in our interest, whether one argues on the 
grounds of maintaining our strong position here; the hugely 
beneficial transformational effects in the Thai economy 
likely to accrue from the FTA; or the demonstration effect on 
other developing economies.  In asking for a comprehensive, 
transformational FTA with the U.S., we are asking Thailand to 
do something unprecedented, something that it will find very 
hard.  Negotiations are likely to take some time.  Progress 
might be non-linear, with periods of rapid movement forward, 
followed by some regression, a hiatus, and a repetition of 
this cycle.  It will require patience, determination, and 
judgment, with no guarantee of success.  But we believe it is 
worth the considerable effort likely to be required.
