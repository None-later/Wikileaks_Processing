SUBJECT:  UZBEK ISLAMIC MILITANT SURFACES IN PESHAWAR? 
 
REF:  TASHKENT 2018 
 
1.  CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR ESCUDERO.  REASON: 1.5 (B) 
AND (D). 
 
2. (C) ACCORDING TO BBC CORRESPONDENT MONICA WHITLOCK 
(PLEASE PROTECT), UZBEK ISLAMIC MILITANT \"TAKHIRJON\" HAS 
SURFACED IN PESHAWAR.  TAKHIRJON LED THE 1991 \"ADOLAT\" 
UPRISING WHICH BRIEFLY TOOK OVER THE HOKIMIATE OFFICES IN 
NAMANGAN CITY (IN THE FERGANA VALLEY), DEMANDING AN 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC.  THE DEMONSTRATION WAS BROKEN UP AND 
TAKHIRJON FLED TO AFGHANISTAN.  OUR INFORMATION UNTIL NOW 
WAS THAT HE, WITH PERHAPS A FEW DOZEN TO A COUPLE HUNDRED 
FIGHTERS, WAS WITH THE TAJIK OPPOSITION IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
3. (C) THE SOURCE FOR THE INFORMATION THAT HE IS IN 
PESHAWAR IS HIS BROTHER, PRESUMABLY A RELIABLE ONE.  THE 
BROTHER ALSO TOLD WHITLOCK THAT UZBEK POLICE HAVE 
ARRESTED TWO OF TAKHIRJON\'S OTHER BROTHERS, ONE IN 
SAMARKAND AND THE SECOND IN NAMANGAN.  NEITHER OF THE 
ARRESTED BROTHERS IS ISLAMICALLY ACTIVE, HE CLAIMED. 
 
4. (C) WHITLOCK SAID SHE HAS HEARD THAT \"JUMABOY 
NAMANGANI,\" TAKHIRJON\'S DEPUTY COMMANDER, IS NOW IN 
TAVILDARA, TAJIKISTAN, WITH OPPOSITION WARLORD MIRZO RIO. 
SHE NOTED THAT THE BRITISH GOLD MINERS RECENTLY HELD 
HOSTAGE BY MIRZO RIO INITIALLY COMMENTED TO HER THAT THEY 
HAD BEEN SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF UZBEKS WITH THE 
WARLORD, BUT THEN REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE ANY 
FURTHER. 
 
5. (C) COMMENT:  THE GOU\'S LONG-STANDING FEAR OF ISLAMIC 
ACTIVISTS IS EXACERBATED BY ITS CONCERNS ABOUT THE 
TALIBAN ADVANCE IN AFGHANISTAN.  IN A RECENT CONVERSATION 
WITH THE AMBASSADOR (REFTEL), PRESIDENT KARIMOV LINKED 
THE 1992 ADOLAT UPRISING WITH THE DANGER OF CREEPING 
ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM FROM AFGHANISTAN.  THE ARREST OF 
TAKHIRJON\'S RELATIVES IS ALMOST CERTAINLY LINKED TO THOSE 
SAME FEARS, EVEN THOUGH THE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE 
ADOLAT LEADER\'S LOYALTIES LIE MORE WITH THE TAJOPP AND 
AFGHAN TAJIK COMMANDER MASSOUD THAN WITH THE TALIBAN.

SUBJECT:  KARIMOV URGES CLOSER COOPERATION WITH U.S., COMMITS TO 
FRANK AIRING OF DIFFERENCES 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB JOHN E. HERBST, REASONS:  1.5 (B,D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY:  ON NOVEMBER 1, THE AMBASSADOR PRESENTED 
CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT KARIMOV.  THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A 
SPIRITED DISCUSSION OF ABOUT ONE HOUR DURING WHICH KARIMOV 
ARGUED FOR DEEPER COOPERATION WITH THE U.S., CHARGED RUSSIA WITH 
MANEUVERING TO RESTORE HEGEMONY IN CENTRAL ASIA, AND OUTLINED 
THE STRATEGY OF UZBEKISTAN (AND CIS FRIENDS UKRAINE AND GEORGIA) 
TO FOIL RUSSIAN DESIGNS.  KARIMOV REITERATED HIS FAMILIAR 
ARGUMENT ABOUT UZBEKISTAN\'S CENTRALITY TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND 
VALUE AS A PARTNER TO THE UNITED STATES.  HE CONCLUDED BY 
STATING UZBEKISTAN\'S WILLINGNESS TO RESPOND TO OUR CRITICISMS ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND OTHER ISSUES.  HE SEEMED, HOWEVER, TO RELEGATE 
THE HARD OR CONTENTIOUS ISSUES TO FOREIGN MINISTER KAMILOV.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C)  AMBASSADOR HERBST PRESENTED HIS CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT 
ISLOM KARIMOV ON NOVEMBER 1.  THE MEETING WHICH FOLLOWED WAS 
ALSO ATTENDED BY FORMIN KAMILOV AND DCM (NOTETAKER).  PRESIDENT 
KARIMOV THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HAVING SPOKEN TO THE PRESS IN 
UZBEK ON HIS ARRIVAL IN TASHKENT ON SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28.  THIS 
GESTURE HAD SIGNIFIED THE RESPECT AND ESTEEM OF THE UNITED 
STATES FOR UZBEKISTAN AND ITS PEOPLE.  RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED 
STATES WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.  UZBEKISTAN APPRECIATED THE 
MATERIAL HELP IT RECEIVES FROM THE U.S. AND, ABOVE ALL, THE 
ATTENTION UZBEKISTAN RECEIVES FROM SENIOR U.S. POLICY-MAKERS. 
NO COUNTRY COULD UNDERTAKE DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORMS 
WITHOUT HELP.  HE SALUTED THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
EUROPE IN TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS.  THESE 
EFFORTS WERE LAYING THE BASIS FOR PROGRESS ON DEMOCRATIC AND 
ECONOMIC REFORMS. 
 
GROWING U.S. - UZBEKISTAN COOPERATION 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
3. (C) RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND UZBEKISTAN HAD GONE 
THROUGH VARIOUS PHASES IN THEIR SHORT HISTORY, KARIMOV OBSERVED. 
THE VISIT OF SECRETARY ALBRIGHT IN APRIL HAD BEEN A 
BREAKTHROUGH.  IN HER THREE DAYS IN UZBEKISTAN, SHE DID MORE 
THAN MEET OFFICIALS.  SHE ACTUALLY GOT A FLAVOR FOR THE PEOPLE 
AND THEIR CULTURE.  HUMAN CONTACTS WERE VERY IMPORTANT.  WHEN 
KARIMOV MET HER IN NEW YORK AT THE MILLENNIUM SUMMIT, SECRETARY 
ALBRIGHT HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HER VISIT HAD GIVEN HER MUCH TO 
REFLECT UPON.  THE VISIT HAD SHAPED HER OPINIONS ON UZBEKISTAN 
AND THE REGION. 
 
4. (C) KARIMOV NOTED THAT UZBEKISTAN\'S POSITIONS ON 
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES - FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THE U.N. FRAMEWORK - 
OFTEN WERE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE UNITED STATES.  THIS WAS 
NOT BECAUSE UZBEKISTAN SOUGHT TO CURRY FAVOR WITH US.  IT WAS 
BECAUSE UZBEKISTAN, ACTING IN PURSUIT OF ITS OWN INTERESTS, 
USUALLY FOUND ITSELF IN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S.  UZBEKISTAN 
AGREED WITH THE U.S. MORE OFTEN THAN UZBEKISTAN\'S NEIGHBORS DID, 
INDEED MORE OFTEN THAN MOST COUNTRIES.  UNLIKE SOME OF THEM, 
UZBEKISTAN DID NOT SHIFT ITS POSITIONS DEPENDING ON SOME PETTY 
CALCULATIONS.  KAZAKHSTAN, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS PRO-U.S. ON A 
QUESTION ONE DAY AND OPPOSED THE U.S. THE NEXT. 
 
5. (C) A CLEAR ILLUSTRATION OF UZBEKISTAN\'S CLOSENESS TO THE 
U.S. ON KEY ISSUES WAS THE MIDDLE EAST, KARIMOV CONTINUED. 
ISRAELI POLITICAL LEADER NATAN SCHARANSKY HAD RECENTLY COME TO 
TASHKENT ON ONE OF HIS FREQUENT VISITS AND HAD MET KARIMOV. 
KARIMOV AND HE HAD AGREED THAT COUNTRIES NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED 
IN THE PEACE PROCESS WERE GLAD TO SEE IT FALTER.  OTHER 
\"FANATIC\" COUNTRIES WERE DELIBERATELY INFLAMING THE SITUATION. 
THOSE THAT WERE COMPLACENT IN THE FACE OF THE WORSENING 
SITUATION DID NOT CONSIDER THE DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR 
THEMSELVES.  NOTING PRESIDENT PUTIN WAS NOW ON AN OFFICIAL VISIT 
TO PARIS, KARIMOV SAID PUTIN AND THE FRENCH WERE PRESSING TO 
OPEN THE PEACE PROCESS TO THEIR PARTICIPATION.  THE U.S. WAS 
RIGHT TO RESIST THESE EFFORTS.  RUSSIA HAD NO RESOURCES TO OFFER 
AND THEREFORE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE. 
RADICAL FORCES WERE ALSO AT WORK IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN, 
KARIMOV NOTED.  THE GOU WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE U.S. ON 
AFGHANISTAN THROUGH AMB SAFAYEV\'S MEETINGS WITH A/S INDERFURTH. 
 
6. (C) ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, KARIMOV NOTED HIS OWN GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH USEXIM AND USEXIM PRESIDENT HARMAN.  U.S. 
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WAS ALSO VERY WELCOME.  HE CITED THE CASI 
BORDER SECURITY PROGRAM AS AN INSTANCE OF THIS. 
 
7. (C) THE VISIT OF NEWLY-APPOINTED DEFMIN GULAMOV TO THE U.S. 
SHOWED OUR INCREASING CLOSENESS ON SECURITY ISSUES, KARIMOV 
SAID.  GULAMOV WAS BEING RECEIVED AT A SENIOR LEVEL THROUGHOUT 
THE ADMINISTRATION.  UZBEKISTAN WAS UNDERTAKING DEEP MILITARY 
REFORMS AND HAD THE FIRST CIVILIAN DEFMIN IN THE CIS.  KARIMOV 
KNEW AND RESPECTED GULAMOV AS A SCIENTIST.  THE RUSSIANS WOULD 
MUCH PREFER TO DEAL WITH A GENERAL AS DEFMIN, SINCE GENERALS 
TYPICALLY HAD BEEN TRAINED IN SOVIET MILITARY INSTITUTIONS. 
GULAMOV, BY CONTRAST, WAS MODERN AND ENLIGHTENED.  KARIMOV DID 
NOT WANT TO SEE THE MILITARY MEDDLE IN POLITICS OR TAKE PUBLIC 
POSITIONS ON POLITICAL ISSUES AS IN RUSSIA. 
 
VIEWS ON THE NIS -- THE RUSSIANS ARE SCHEMING 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
8. (C) WITHIN THE CIS, UZBEKISTAN, GEORGIA, UKRAINE AND 
SOMETIMES AZERBAIJAN HAD COMMON POSITIONS, SAID KARIMOV.  TO THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S QUERY ABOUT MOLDOVA, KARIMOV REPLIED THAT LUSINCHI 
WAS WEAK AND WOBBLY.  UZBEKISTAN AND ITS FRIENDS IN THE CIS WERE 
COMMITTED TO A CIS OF INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES AND 
OPPOSED TO RUSSIAN ATTEMPTS TO DOMINATE THE OTHERS. 
THE FOUR WANTED THE CIS TO FOCUS MAINLY ON BUILDING ECONOMIC 
LINKS SUCH AS TRADE AND INVESTMENT.  IN AN INTERVIEW JUST 
PUBLISHED IN THE FRENCH NEWSPAPER FIGARO, PUTIN HAD SAID RUSSIAN 
FOREIGN POLICY DID NOT SEEK TO DOMINATE OTHERS.  THIS WAS NOT 
TRUE.  ONE ONLY HAS TO LOOK, FOR EXAMPLE, AT HOW RUSSIA WAS 
USING NATURAL GAS SALES AND TRANSPORT AS LEVERAGE OVER UKRAINE 
AND TURKMENISTAN. 
 
9. (C)  THE EURASIAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY RECENTLY LAUNCHED IN 
ASTANA BY RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BELARUS, KYRGYZSTAN AND TAJIKISTAN 
SHOWED, KARIMOV ARGUED, THAT RUSSIA WAS GIVING UP ON THE CIS, 
BECAUSE IT COULD NOT IMPOSE ITS WILL ON ALL.  RUSSIA WAS PUSHING 
INSTEAD FOR A CLOSER, RUSSIA-DOMINATED SUBGROUP OF CIS 
COUNTRIES.  ON THE SECURITY FRONT, RUSSIA WAS PUSHING A PARALLEL 
INITIATIVE WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE CIS SECURITY TREATY.  RUSSIA 
HOPED THAT THE OTHER CIS MEMBERS WOULD ULTIMATELY BE ATTRACTED 
TO JOIN THESE SUB-GROUPS, WITH THE END RESULT BEING SOMETHING 
LIKE THE USSR.  PUTIN WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM YELTSIN, BUT MERELY 
MORE AGGRESSIVE AND MORE FOCUSSED AROUND THE AGENDA OF RESTORING 
RUSSIA\'S GREAT POWER STATUS. 
 
10. (C) THE AMBASSADOR ASKED HOW UZBEKISTAN\'S RELATIONS WITH 
RUSSIA AND PUTIN HAD EVOLVED SINCE THE LATTER\'S VISIT SOON AFTER 
HIS ELECTION.  KARIMOV NOTED THAT PUTIN\'S FIRST VISIT HAD BEEN 
AS PRIME MINISTER.  HE WAS SENT BY YELTSIN TO PERSUADE KARIMOV 
TO COME TO MOSCOW FOR TALKS.  YELTSIN HAD TRIED HARD FOR A LONG 
TIME TO BRING KARIMOV AND SHEVARDNADZE BACK UNDER MOSCOW\'S WING. 
HE AND SHEVARDNADZE WERE DETERMINED NOT TO DO SO.  ALIYEV, 
HOWEVER, WAS NOT SO FIRMLY SET ON MAINTAINING HIS DISTANCE FROM 
THE RUSSIANS.  KARIMOV JUDGED HIM TO BE CAPABLE OF SWITCHING 
CAMPS AT SOME POINT.  UNLIKE SHEVARDNADZE, ALIYEV WAS NOT DRIVEN 
BY CONVICTION, ONLY TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.  INCIDENTALLY, NIYAZOV 
WAS COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE AS A PARTNER FOR ANYONE.  HE HAD TRIED 
TO USE TURKMENISTAN\'S NATURAL GAS TO BLACKMAIL VARIOUS PARTNERS 
AND HAD BEEN SHOWN UP AS NOT SERIOUS. 
 
11. (C) ONCE PUTIN HAD BECOME PRESIDENT, HE HAD RENEWED HIS 
ATTEMPTS TO BRING KARIMOV BACK INTO THE FOLD, KARIMOV CONTINUED. 
RUSSIA CONSIDERED UZBEKISTAN TO BE A GATEWAY TO THE ARAB AND 
MUSLIM WORLD.  WITH ITS HOLY SITES AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF NOTED 
ISLAMIC SCHOLARS FROM UZBEKISTAN\'S HISTORY, UZBEKISTAN HAD TO BE 
CONSIDERED CENTRAL TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY AND 
LEARNING OWED MUCH TO UZBEKISTAN AND WAS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH 
WAHHABISM AND OTHER DEBASED IDEOLOGIES.  FRIENDSHIP WITH 
UZBEKISTAN SHOULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. FOR THE SAME REASON - 
TO BUILD BRIDGES TO THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  THE \'FANATICS\' WANTED 
POWER IN UZBEKISTAN PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE 
COUNTRY\'S IMPORTANCE IN ISLAMIC TRADITION.  THE LEADER OF 
ISLAMIC COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES COMPLETELY SHARED 
KARIMOV\'S VIEWS ON THIS MATTER.  RUSSIA UNDERSTOOD; THE U.S. 
SHOULD TOO. 
 
AFGHANISTAN - TREADING LIGHTLY 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 
12. (C) TURNING TO AFGHANISTAN, KARIMOV NOTED THE RECENT TALIBAN 
VICTORIES AND MASOOD REVERSES.  THE RUSSIAN MEDIA HAD BEEN 
EXAGGERATING THE DANGER OF A TALIBAN VICTORY FOR CENTRAL ASIAN 
SECURITY.  THEY HAD DEPICTED A TASHKENT \"SURROUNDED BY 
WAHHABITES.\"  THE TALIBAN WERE SUPPOSEDLY MASSING FORCES ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE BORDER FROM TERMEZ AND ACQUIRING BOATS TO 
INFILTRATE ACROSS THE AMU DARYA.  ALL OF THIS WAS PUBLISHED 
DELIBERATELY TO SOW PANIC AMONG UZBEKISTAN\'S PEOPLE.  THE 
RUSSIANS HOPED THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD PRESSURE KARIMOV TO ASK FOR 
MILITARY HELP FROM RUSSIA.  RUSSIA HAD TRIED TO PROVOKE A \"SMALL 
BORDER WAR\" BETWEEN UZBEKISTAN AND THE TALIBAN IN ORDER TO FORCE 
THE GOU TO ACCEPT RUSSIAN MILITARY HELP.  THE AMBASSADOR ASKED 
HOW RUSSIA COULD ACCOMPLISH THIS.  WAS KARIMOV SUGGESTING RUSSIA 
SUPPORTED THE TALIBAN MATERIALLY?  KARIMOV ANSWERED NO. 
RUSSIA\'S TACTICS WERE FOR EXAMPLE THE ISSUANCE OF PRESIDENTIAL 
ADVISER YASTRZEMBSKIY\'S PUBLIC THREATS IN MAY OF RUSSIAN AIR 
STRIKES ON TERRORIST BASES IN AFGHANISTAN.  THIS WAS INTENDED TO 
PROVOKE THE TALIBAN TO ATTACK UZBEKISTAN (WHICH WOULD HAVE TO 
ALLOW ITS AIRSPACE TO BE USED UNDER SUCH A SCENARIO).  RUSSIA 
WAS MANEUVERING TO SET THE TALIBAN AGAINST UZBEKISTAN.  RUSSIA 
HAD REINFORCED ITS SECURITY AND OTHER COOPERATION WITH 
KYRGYZSTAN, KAZAKHSTAN AND TAJIKISTAN.  THIS WAS OF LITTLE USE 
TO RUSSIA SO LONG AS UZBEKISTAN REFUSED TO PLAY.  RUSSIA ALSO 
WAS BUILDING UP THE TALIBAN THREAT IN ORDER TO DIVERT 
INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION FROM ITS DOINGS IN CHECHNYA.  UZBEKISTAN 
WANTS NORMAL RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA, RELATIONS OF TWO STATES ON 
AN EQUAL FOOTING, KARIMOV CONCLUDED.  THE RUSSIANS\' GOAL WAS 
MILITARY BASES, WHICH KARIMOV WOULD NEVER ALLOW. 
 
13. (C) AS TO THE GOU\'S RECENT CONTACTS WITH THE TALIBAN, 
KARIMOV SAID UZBEKISTAN DID NOT EXPECT TO FIND COMMON GROUND 
WITH THESE RADICAL, FANATICAL IDEOLOGUES.  KARIMOV KNEW AND HAD 
TOLD GENERAL MUSHARRAF ABOUT UZBEKISTAN\'S KNOWLEDGE OF TALIBAN 
SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND INVOLVEMENT IN DRUG TRAFFICKING. 
NEVERTHELESS, UZBEKISTAN WANTED TO AVOID NEEDLESSLY PROVOKING 
CONFLICT WITH THE TALIBAN.  EVEN IF THE TALIBAN MANAGED TO TAKE 
OVER THE WHOLE TERRITORY OF AFGHANISTAN, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE 
TO GOVERN IT.  THE MOVEMENT WOULD SPLINTER AND NEW FIGHTING 
WOULD START.  THE ONLY HOPE FOR A LASTING SETTLEMENT WAS AN 
INCLUSIVE GOVERNMENT ENCOMPASSING MANY DIFFERENT POLITICAL 
FORCES.  UZBEKISTAN SUPPORTED THE INITIATIVE OF THE FORMER KING 
OF AFGHANISTAN.  HIS REPRESENTATIVE WOULD VISIT TASHKENT LATER 
THIS MONTH. 
 
14. (C) THE AMBASSADOR TOLD KARIMOV THE U.S. IS COMMITTED TO 
DEEPENING OUR COOPERATION WITH UZBEKISTAN ACROSS MANY FRONTS. 
HE WAS IMPRESSED BY THE RANGE OF AREAS WHERE WE WERE ALREADY 
WORKING TOGETHER.  THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY WOULD SURELY EXPAND 
AND NEEDED THE COOPERATION OF THE GOU IN LOCATING SUITABLE 
PROPERTY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW EMBASSY.  KARIMOV INDICATED 
HIS SUPPORT.  THE AMBASSADOR NOTED AGAIN THAT WE NEEDED TO BUILD 
OUR COOPERATION ACROSS ALL FRONTS, WHICH INCLUDED NOT ONLY 
SECURITY BUT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC AREAS. 
 
15. (C) PICKING UP THE AMBASSADOR\'S HINT, KARIMOV SAID HE HAD 
DELIBERATELY DISCUSSED ONLY THE AREAS WHERE THE GOU AND U.S. 
VIEWS WERE IN ACCORD.  NEXT TIME THE TWO SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE 
AREAS WHERE THE GOU AND THE U.S. DID NOT SEE EYE TO EYE.  HE 
KNEW WE HAD CONTACTS WITH SO-CALLED OPPOSITION FIGURES.  SOME OF 
THEM WERE NOT GENUINE OPPOSITION FIGURES BUT INSANE (BOLNOY). 
AFTER THE AMBASSADOR HAD BEGUN TO FORM HIS OWN DIRECT 
IMPRESSIONS OF THESE MATTERS, HE WOULD BE GLAD TO OPEN A DIRECT, 
FRANK EXCHANGE ON THEM.  FOR NOW, HE WOULD ONLY SAY THAT THE 
U.S. SHOULD APPLY AN APPROPRIATE STANDARD WHEN JUDGING 
UZBEKISTAN\'S PERFORMANCE.  THE STATE DEPARTMENT\'S DEMANDS WERE 
NOT ALWAYS REASONABLE, BUT THE GOU WAS OPEN TO DISCUSSING THEM. 
THE AMBASSADOR INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT ON THESE ISSUES, AT WHICH POINT KARIMOV GESTURED TO 
FORMIN KAMILOV, SAYING THE AMBASSADOR SHOULD DISCUSS THESE 
MATTERS WITH KAMILOV. 
 
16. (C) COMMENT:  THIS WAS A GOOD FIRST MEETING WITH KARIMOV. 
HE WAS SPONTANEOUS AND ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN AWAY FROM HIS 
SCRIPT.  WE ARE INTRIGUED BY HIS SUGGESTION THAT, AFTER THE 
AMBASSADOR HAD BEEN HERE A LITTLE WHILE, WE SHOULD DISCUSS THE 
DIFFICULT INTERNAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES.  BUT KARIMOV\'S 
PROMPT REJOINDER THAT THE AMBASSADOR SHOULD TAKE THESE ISSUES UP 
WITH KAMILOV MAY MEAN THAT KARIMOV PREFERS TO AVOID THEM.

SUBJECT: AFTER THE BOMBINGS: KARIMOV\'S DECISION-MAKING 
DICHOTOMY 
 
REFS:  A) Tashkent 385  B) Tashkent 1052  C) Tashkent 726 D) Tashkent 2603 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB. JON R. PURNELL, FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
1.  (C) Summary.  This is the second of two cables, which 
provides insight into President Karimov\'s decision-making 
process.  The first of which looked at Karimov\'s possible 
succession plans (ref D).  Although Uzbekistan was rocked 
twice this year by terrorist bombings, little has changed 
for President Islom Karimov.  The terrorist attacks have 
had little impact on either the population or Karimov\'s 
policies but have highlighted an apparent dichotomy in his 
decision-making and policy formulating ability:  he is a 
keen analyst of regional security issues, but curiously 
passive about confronting domestic challenges.  His hold on 
power, a number one concern, remains unchallenged, reducing 
his impetus to make any kind of change.  End summary. 
 
DICHOTOMY OF VISION 
------------------- 
2.  (C) When President Karimov makes decisions regarding 
policy for Uzbekistan, he most likely considers their 
impact on his own position first and foremost.  Minister of 
Defense Gulomov (protect) indicated as much in confidence 
during a recent DOD visit when he told DCM (then Charge) 
that Karimov cares only about security and his position, 
and sometimes the two do not coincide.  What is good for 
the country in the longer term is presumably also a factor 
in his calculations, since his legacy is inextricably 
linked to the success or failure of Uzbekistan as a state. 
However, short-term security concerns and maintaining his 
hold on power still remain top priority. 
 
3.  (C) Karimov is capable of strategic vision, especially 
regarding regional security.  In this realm, his decision- 
making appears shrewd and rational; he readily acknowledges 
the U.S. role in Afghanistan as beneficial to Uzbek and 
Central Asian security.  His concerns about internal Afghan 
politics and Russian influence in the region are well 
founded and clearly articulated.  It is in this well 
defined area of security that we find a reasonable, 
intelligent partner in Karimov and Uzbekistan. 
 
4.  (C) By contrast, Karimov can appear remarkably short- 
sighted in other areas, such as macro-economic reform and 
democratic development.  Karimov\'s horizon seems to be only 
three or four months down the road and no further.  He has 
exhibited this tendency at least since the mid-1990s.  Many 
of these policies, however, have outlived their usefulness 
and only serve to hamper economic growth and democracy 
building.  Karimov clings to his Soviet command-style 
economic background, apparently believing that his populace 
can survive without cash as the National Bank starves the 
market of local currency. 
 
A DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS 
------------------------ 
 
5.  (C) When faced with unexpected threats, however, 
Karimov\'s response appears to be retrenchment.  In certain 
cases, like after the 1999 Tashkent bombings and the Rose 
Revolution in Georgia, Karimov has had a knee-jerk reaction 
that abandons much rational explanation.  In the wake of 
Uzbekistan\'s worst terrorist attacks since 1999, Karimov 
has curiously done very little in the policy realm.  He has 
placed the blame on his neighbors and Western countries 
like the U.K.  He has shown no interest in innovation or 
new policies that could lead to loosening the Govenment\'s 
firm control over what is said in Uzbekitan\'s mosques.  He 
also likely fears that any tye of loosening would provide 
an opening for Hizb-ut Tahrir (HT) or other etremists. 
Additionally, Karimov sees no profit fr himselfin 
adopting major new economic policies  Elites, including 
members of Karimov\'s own famly, are doing very well under 
current economic cnditions.  There is no incentive for 
these elite to make changes that might threaten their 
wealt.  And he so thoroughly controls bank functions that 
virtually the entire inancial system is nder his thumb. 
 
6.  (C) In he past, Karimov has used distinctive occasions 
lke the opening of an Oliy Majlis (legislature) sesion to 
make some sort of policy statement (ref A.  On April 29, 
Karimov addressed the opening sesion of the Oliy Majlis 
(ref B), during which hefocused on terrorism and laid the 
blame on the Western media, HT, and outsiders.  While he 
did address the nation on Uzbek TV on March 30 after the 
first spate of suicide bombings (ref C), he did not do so 
after the July 30 events.  In fact, in August, Karimov 
attended the opening session of the Oliy Majlis but chose 
not to make an address.  He had perfect opportunity during 
the official Independence Day commemoration on August 31 to 
present a policy address, but he did not. 
 
7. (C) Karimov\'s curious pause on the policy front at this 
time could simply be due to a lack of ideas and vision.  He 
is a Soviet-era hold over, as is most of his government, 
who is focused on his position and ways to keep it.  His 
lack of a vision for Uzbekistan\'s future is severely 
limited by his experiences as well as his preoccupation 
with security.  Other leaders might have fired the top 
police chief, Interior Minister Almatov, or the 
intelligence czar, NSS Chair Inoyatov, for failure to 
prevent terrorist attacks.  Such moves here, we expect, 
would only rock the political boat and upset Karimov\'s 
prized balance.  In the meantime, he does little to address 
the question of why terrorists have found Uzbekistan 
fertile ground for recruiting people willing to die to 
oppose his regime.

SUBJECT: FIRST DAUGHTER LOLA (KARIMOVA) CUTS LOSE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB. JON R. PURNELL, FOR REASONS 1.4 
(B, D). 
 
1. (C) For at least the past month, the youngest of 
President Islom Karimov\'s three children, 26-year old 
Lola Karimova, has been frequenting restaurant/club 
Barkhan (\"shifting sand dune\") on a near nightly 
basis.  On November 13, we once again ran into the 
First Daughter at this location.  During this 
encounter, she identified one of the men in her booth 
to poloff as her boyfriend and confirmed the club was 
hers. 
 
2. (C) Karimova typically arrives in her -- one-of-a- 
kind, for Tashkent -- Porsche Cayenne S Sports 
Utility Vehicle around ten o\'clock for the 
traditional floorshow and stays until the wee hours 
dancing the night away in the raucous disco.  On 
occasion, her older sister, Gulnora, joins her around 
three o\'clock in the morning.  Taking her prominently 
reserved booth amidst all the action and protected by 
four bodyguards, Lola Karimova drinks a fair amount 
of alcohol and dances freely while 28-year old 
Barkhan proprietor \"Timur\" and Ms. Karimova\'s 
thuggish-looking boyfriend also serve to keep 
potential dance partners at bay. 
 
3. (C) Comment: Lola Karimova, who reportedly also 
owns chic Tashkent nightclub Basha, would appear to 
favor her new club, the Barkhan.  It remains unclear 
whether she is the owner by appropriation/hostile 
takeover, or whether she reached a partnership 
agreement with \"Timur,\" who is rumored to own the 
popular restaurant Karavan, as well.  Considering the 
plethora of foreign contractors, diplomats, and First 
Family members who habitually attend the Barkhan, the 
securQis astonishingly light.  Barkhan ownership 
is obviously well connected, as it\'s the only place 
in town that flaunts selling non-Uzbekistan produced 
hard alcohol, which is against the law.

SUBJECT: PRESIDENT KARIMOV NOT AN ORPHAN, AND OTHER FAMILY 
SECRETS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMB. JON R. PURNELL FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D). 
 
1.  (C) Summary: Although his face was covered in bruises, 
the physical resemblance to the President is striking.  In 
a wide-ranging conversation with poloff, Islom Karimov\'s 
estranged nephew, Jamshid Karimov, and Jamshid\'s mother, 
Muslima Karimova -- the President\'s sister-in-law -- 
revealed details about their famous relative.  They said 
that President Karimov was never an orphan, as his official 
biography asserts, but grew up in a \"normal family.\" 
Threatened politically by a minor corruption scandal 
involving his older brother, Hurshid, Karimov began to 
distance himself from his family in the mid-eighties; he 
broke off contact entirely when he became First Secretary 
of the Uzbek SSR in 1989.  The Jizzak Hokimiyat maintains 
Jamshid and his mother in modest comfort -- perks given in 
exchange for keeping a low profile.  Jamshid, a small-time 
journalist with casual connections to the local human 
rights community, claimed that his recent decision to sign 
on as a stringer with IWPR prompted local authorities to 
have him beaten.  Jamshid\'s IWPR colleague, however, said 
that the beating was more likely a random act of violence. 
End summary. 
 
NEVER AN ORPHAN 
--------------- 
 
2.  (C) On December 26, poloff spoke with Jamshid Karimov 
(strictly protect), a Jizzak-area journalist hired in 
October as a stringer by the USG-funded media NGO, 
Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR).  As reported 
in a short Reuters news bulletin, Karimov had been beaten 
by two unidentified assailants on December 20.  The article 
mentioned that Karimov is the nephew of President Islom 
Karimov.  Poloff was greeted at the family\'s small 
apartment by Jamshid who, even with a bruised face, closely 
resembles his uncle, and by Jamshid\'s mother, Muslima 
Karimova (strictly protect), the widow of President 
Karimov\'s elder brother Arslan.  Over the next hour and a 
half, Jamshid and Muslima discussed their family\'s break 
with Uzbekistan\'s First Family, providing tantalizing 
glimpses into the President\'s early career and family life. 
 
3.  (C) Muslima laughed at the official story of the 
President\'s upbringing.  (Note: According to his official 
biography, President Karimov is an orphan.  The President 
is known to be close to his wife\'s family; his biological 
family is never mentioned, nor is Pyotr, Karimov\'s son by 
his first wife.  End note.)  He was no orphan, Muslima 
stated, he had six brothers and one sister, and grew up in 
a \"normal family\" in Samarkand.  Of Karimov\'s seven 
siblings, two brothers -- Hurshid and Ibodulla -- remain; 
one lives in Tashkent, the other in Samarkand.  She said 
that Karimov first started circulating the orphanage story 
in the mid- to late 1980s as a way of distancing himself 
from his family. 
 
4.  (C) Both Jamshid and Muslima stated that the early 
family relationship had, in fact, been fairly close. 
Muslima\'s earliest recollections of Islom Karimov were from 
their student days when the future president would 
constantly pester her for small loans.  \"He never paid me 
back,\" she commented ruefully.  Muslima implied that 
Karimov\'s marriage to Natalia, the daughter of the Chairman 
of the Tashkent Agricultural Machinery Plant, Pyotr Kuchmi, 
had been a union of ambition.  Karimov had a son, whom he 
named Rustam.  But after he divorced Natalia in the late 
1960s, she had their son\'s name changed to Pyotr. 
 
THE BREAK 
--------- 
 
5.  (C) Karimov began to distance himself from his family 
in late 1985 and early 1986, when his brother, Hurshid, a 
distributor of retail food products (mostly tea), became 
embroiled in a minor corruption scandal.  At the time, 
according to Muslima, Karimov was Deputy Chairman of 
Gosplan, and was expecting a promotion.  Karimov called his 
brother Arslan (Muslima\'s husband) and demanded that they 
disown Hurshid, arguing that their careers were in danger. 
Arslan, the Chair of the Jizzak City Court, refused.  (Now 
Hurshid is a rich man, Muslima said with some resentment; 
he lives in a fancy house in Tashkent and is protected by 
Ismoil Jurabekov.)  From that point on, there was almost no 
contact, Muslima stated.  Karimov was soon named First 
Secretary of Kashkadarya and spent almost all of his time 
shuttling between Tashkent and Karshi.  It was then, 
Muslima and Jamshid said, that Karimov began to claim that 
he had been orphaned. 
 
6.  (C) The final break came in 1989, the year Karimov was 
named First Secretary of the Uzbek SSR.  Arslan died that 
year in what Muslima described as a \"suspicious\" collision 
with a bus.  A street in Jizzak was named after him, but 
Karimov ordered it changed back to the original name. 
Karimov\'s eldest brother died that year, as well. 
According to Muslima, Karimov made a brief appearance at 
the funeral, where he offered 350 Rubles to the family (not 
a small sum in those days).  Since then, there has been no 
direct contact.  Muslima occasionally calls the 
Presidential Apparat if she needs something specific, such 
as medical treatment.  The one time she tried to get 
through to the President\'s residence, she said, his 
daughter Gulnora picked up the phone and hung up 
immediately. 
 
7.  (C) The Presidential Apparat offers some material 
support, provided through the Jizzak Hokimiyat, but it is 
far from lavish.  \"All he has to do is sign a paper, and 
we\'d be set up,\" Jamshid\'s wife complained.  Instead, the 
family was compelled to sell their large house in Tashkent 
and move to an apartment in Jizzak, where they live in 
modest comfort.  The family\'s gas, electricity, and phone 
bills are paid for, and the Hokimiyat provides occasional 
gifts during holidays.  In exchange, Jamshid implied, the 
family is expected to keep a low profile.  The only thing 
that Karimov has done for his family, Jamshid\'s wife 
interjected, is to maintain a mausoleum in the Shakhri 
Zinda complex in Samarkand. 
 
AN UNINSPIRING CAREER, MILD INTEREST IN HUMAN RIGHTS WORK 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
8.  (C) Soon after the break, Jamshid began working as a 
journalist for \"Jizzak Pravda,\" a Communist Party newspaper 
that later became the official paper of the regional 
Hokimiyat.  Bored with what he described as an 
unchallenging sinecure, Jamshid was introduced to IWPR 
Director Galima Burkharbaeva by the Chairman of the Human 
Rights Society of Uzbekistan, Jizzak native Tolib Yakubov. 
(Jamshid said that he had struck up a friendship with 
Yakubov in 1998 and over the next few years had come to 
know several members of Jizzak\'s local human rights 
community.)  Jamshid said that he was attracted by the 
prestige of working for an international media NGO and, in 
any case, the money was good (100 dollars per article). 
So, in October of this year, he signed a contract and began 
working as a stringer. 
 
9.  (C) This, however, was just the kind of attention that 
the Jizzak Hokimiyat did not want.  Almost immediately 
after filing his first articles, Jamshid was called in by 
the Regional Chief of the National Security Service, a man 
named Morozov, who promised to arrange a better government 
job if Jamshid would only promise to stop working for IWPR. 
According to Jamshid, Morozov was particularly worried that 
Jamshid would be seen covering Jizzak\'s frequent small 
human rights demonstrations.  Jamshid\'s older sister, 
Gulbahor Karimova, a local political operative running for 
parliament on the National Democratic Party ticket, also 
asked Jamshid not to work for IWPR.  Later, Jamshid was 
offered the newly created job of \"personal publicist\" for 
Regional Hokim Ubaidulla Yamankulov.  Jamshid said that he 
was inclined to take the position, but the offer was 
withdrawn at the last minute, at the insistence of the 
Presidential Apparat. 
 
10.  (C) Jamshid said that he had not, in fact, done much 
work for IWPR, and that he had not covered demonstrations. 
Nevertheless, on December 20, the evening before a 
demonstration was scheduled to take place in front of the 
Jizzak Hokimiyat, Jamshid was accosted by two persons on 
the street, dragged to the pavement, and kicked repeatedly 
in the head.  \"These are methods used by the security 
service,\" Jamshid stated.  Speaking with poloff later that 
day, Jamshid\'s IWPR colleague Ulugbek Haidarov (protect), 
stated that Jamshid\'s attackers had been drunk and that the 
incident was almost certainly a random act of violence.  No 
one would dare do this to the President\'s nephew without 
approval from the very top, Haidarov reasoned.  Haidarov 
stated, the Chief of Staff of the Jizzak Regional Ministry 
of Health treated Jamshid personally. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  (C) Kept from public view for the better part of two 
decades, Jamshid Karimov is not an influential man.  His 
and his mother\'s ruminations offer insights into a 
personality that remains to this day largely a cipher. 
Karimov and those around him have gone to great lengths to 
promote, and jealously safeguard, what now appears to be an 
apocryphal myth of orphaned childhood.  Jamshid and 
Muslima\'s accounts were detailed and hung together 
coherently; it seems extremely unlikely that they would 
concoct such an elaborate tale, much less stage a beating, 
just to plant a story.
