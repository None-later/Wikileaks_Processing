1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN 
RESPONSE TO REFTEL: 
 
-   A.  ON AUGUST 5, 1973, TWO TERRORISTS 
SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS BELONGING TO AHMAD ABD 
AL GHAFFUR\'S GROUP OF FATAH DISSIDENTS ATTACKED 
HE CROWDED TRANSIT LOUNGE OF THE ATHENS 
INTERNA\'IONAL AIRPORT WITH GRENADES AND GUNFIRE, 
ILLING FIVE PERSONS AND INJURING 55 OTHERS.  THEY 
WERE CAPTURED, TRIED AND SENTENCED TO DEATH BY A 
GREEK COURT IN JANUARY 1974.  THEIR SENTENCES WERE 
COMMUTED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT IN APRIL 1974, AND 
GREECE EXPELLED THEM TO LIBYA IN MAY 1974.  THE 
\'WO GUNMEN WERE APPARENTLY FREED BY LIBYA, SINCE 
ONE OF THEM WAS WITH ABD AL GHAFFUR WHEN HE WAS 
KILLED IN BEIRUT ON SEPTEMBER 13, 1974. 
 
-   B.  ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1974, A TWA JET BOUND FROM 
TEL AVIV FOR NEW YORK WITH 88 PERSONS ABOARD 
CRASHED IN THE IONIAN SEA OFF GREECE.  THERE WERE 
NO SURVIVORS.  THE ORGANIZATION OF ARAB 
NATIONALIST YOUTH FOR \'HE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED A STATEMENT IN BEIRUT SAYING 
THA\' A MEMBER OF THEIR ORGANIZATION WHO WAS ON THE 
FLIGHT EXPLODED A CHARGE HE WAS CARRYING AROUND 
HIS WAIST, CAUSING HIS OWN DEATH AND THE 
DESTRUCTION OF THE PLANE.  ON JANUARY 11, 1975, 
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD 
INVES\'IGATORS EXAMINED A RELATIVELY SMALL 
QUANTITY OF DEBRIS RECOVERED AFTER THE PLANE SANK 
IN 10,800 FEET OF WATER, SAID LABORATORY TESTS 
SHOWED CONCLUSIVELY THAT A HIGH-EXPLOSIVE BOMB IN 
A REAR CARGO COMPARTMENT CAUSED THE CRASH.  WE ARE 
AWARE OF NO EVIDENCE LINKING THE CRASH TO GREECE 
OTHER THAN \'HE FACT THAT IT OCCURED IN THE IONIAN 
SEA. 
 
-   C.  ON DECEMBER 23, 1975, RICHARD S. WELCH WAS 
ASSASSINATED BY GUNMEN OUTSIDE HIS RESIDENCE IN 
THE SUBURB OF PSYCHIKO NORTH OF ATHENS.  A GROUP 
CALLING ITSELF \"17 NOVEMBER\" SUBSEQUENTLY CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ASSASSINATION.  SINCE THEN, 
\"17 NOVEMBER\" HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
ASSASSINATION OF FOUR GREEK POLICE OFFICIALS, A 
CONSERVATIVE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER AND, ON 
NOVEMBER 15, 1983, THE ASSASSINATION OF USN 
CAPTAIN GEORGE TSANTES.  \"17 NOVEMBER\" ALSO 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILI\'Y FOR THE A\'\'FMPTED 
ASSASSINATION OF JUSMAGG COURIER M/SGT JUDD ON 
APRIL 3, 1984.  THE GOG INVESTIGATION OF 
\"17 NOVEMBER\" CONTINUES.  NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN 
MADE.  WE HAVE NO NEW INFORMATION TO ADD TO THE 
SUBS\'ANTIAL REPORTING WE HAVE PROVIDED THE 
DEPAR\'MENT ON \"17 NOVEMBER.\" 
 
3.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, THE FOLLOWING 
ANTI-AMERICAN TERRORIST ACTS HAVE OCCURRED IN 
GREECE: 
 
-   A.  A GROUP CALLING ITSELF THE \"REVOLUTIONARY 
PEOPLE\'S S\'RUGGLE\" (ELA) HAS CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILI\'Y FOR SOME 250 BOMBINGS SINCE IT 
FIRS\' APPEARED IN 1974.  ITS TARGETS HAVE INCLUDED 
MULTINA\'IONAL FIRMS, POLICE STATIONS AND THE CARS 
OF FOREIGN, INCLUDING AMERICAN, DIPLOMATS.  ELA 
ALSO RECLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR TWO BOMBS AT THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE IN 1982.  ON MAY 15, 1985, 
CHRIS\'OS \'SOUTSOUVIS, A TERRORIST SUBSEQUENTLY 
FOUND TO HAVE BEEN CONNECTED WITH THE 
ASSASSINATION OF GREEK PUBLIC PROSECUTOR GEORGIOS 
THEOFANOPOULOS ON APRIL 1, 1985, WAS KILLED IN A 
SHOOT-OUT WITH POLICE.  INVESTIGATORS ESTABLISHED 
THAU\'SOUVIS BELONGED TO ELA FROM 1976 TO 1980. 
THE POG INVESTIGATION OF ELA CONTINUES.  NO 
ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE THUS FAR. 
 
-   B.  ON FEBRUARY 2, 1985, A BOMB EXPLODED AT A 
BAR IN GLYFADA FREQUENTED BY U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL, INJURING 55 U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL AND 
DEPENDENTS.  NO GROUP CREDITABLY CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMBING.  THE GOG HAS FILED 
CHARGES AGAINST UNKNOWN PERSONS, A COMMON PRACTICE 
IN GREECE WHEN A SUSPECT\'S IDENTITY REMAINS 
UNDETERMINED. 
 
-   C.  ON JUNE 14, 1985, TWA FLIGHT 847 FROM 
ATHENS TO NEW YORK CARRYING  153 PASSENGERS AND 
CREW WAS HIJACKED SHORTLY AFTER ITS TAKE-OFF FROM 
ATHENS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT BY SAMIR SOLWAN AND 
GOLAB AL-HOBBI, TWO SHI\'ITE LEBANESE TERRORISTS 
BELIEVED TO BELONG TO HEZBOLLAH.  A THIRD 
ACCOMPLICE, ALI A\'WA, WHO WAS UNABLE TO BOARD THE 
FLIGHT IN ATHENS, WAS CAPTURED BY GREEK 
AUTHORITIES AND SUBSEQUENTLY EXCHANGED FOR A 
NUMBER OF PASSENGERS WHILE THE PLANE WAS IN 
ALGIERS.  ON JUNE 15, USN DIVER ROBERT STETHEM WAS 
BRU\'ALLY MURDERED BY THE HIJACKERS AND HIS BODY 
DUMPED ON \'HE TARMAC AT BEIRUT INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT.  THE REMAINING PASSENGERS WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED  GREEK AUTHORITIES ARE 
CONTINUING THEIR INVESTIGATION AS TO HOW THE 
HANDGUN AND HAND GRENADES USED BY THE TERRORISTS 
WERE SMUGGLED ABOARD THE AIRCRAFT. 
 
-   D.  ON JULY 1, 1985, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN 
THE PARKING LOT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE APOLLON 
PALACE HOTEL, THE U.S. AIR FORCE CLUB IN KAVOURI, 
A SEASIDE SUBURB OF ATHENS.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE 
WAS INJURED.  TWO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS -- ELA 
\"ANTI-IMPERIALIST ANTI-AMERICAN STRUGGLE GROUP\" 
-- CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMBING. 
THE GOG INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, WITH NO ARRESTS 
THUS FAR. 
 
4.  WE ARE AWARE OF NO EVIDENCE OF MATERIAL 
SUPPORT PROVIDED TO LOCAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
BY THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES OR NON-INDIGENOUS 
TERRORIST GROUPS.

1.  GREECE. 
 
2.  DURING 1987 GREECE CONTINUED TO BE THE SCENE 
OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS, SPONSORED BOTH BY DOMESTIC 
AND FOREIGN GROUPS.  TWO ATTACKS WERE DIRECTED 
SPECIFICALLY AGAINST AMERICANS.  THE EXTREME-LEFT 
GREEK \"NOVEMBER 17TH\" TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
(ACTIVE SINCE 1975 AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
PREVIOUS KILLINGS OF TWO U.S. OFFICIALS) CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMBINGS ON APRIL 24 AND 
AUGUST 10 OF BUSSES TRANSPORTING U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL IN THE ATHENS AREA.  IN BOTH CASES 
AMERICANS WERE INJURED, BUT FORTUNATELY THERE WERE 
NO FATALITIES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ARRESTS IN 
CONNECTION WITH THESE ATTACKS. 
- 
- 
3.  SYMPTOMATIC OF THE NATURE OF THE TERRORIST 
PROBLEM IN GREECE WERE THE KILLING OF A KUWAITI 
BUSINESSMAN JANUARY 7 BY UNKNOWN BUT PROBABLY 
MIDDLE EASTERN ASSAILANTS, THE SHOOTING WITH 
INTENT TO INJURE SERIOUSLY OF A PROMINENT GREEK 
NEUROSURGEON BY THE \"NOVEMBER 17TH\" ORGANIZATIOM 
FEBRUARY 4, THE SHOOTING AND SERIOUS WOUNDING OF 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE GREEK CONFEDERATION OF 
WORKERS ON JUNE 24, THE SHOOTING WITH OBVIOUS 
INTENT TO KILL OF AN ARAB LEAGUE DEPUTY ON 
DECEMBER 21 (ALSO BY PROBABLE MIDDLE EASTERN 
ASSAILANTS), AND A NUMBER OF BOMBINGS WITHOUT 
APPARENT INTENT TO ENDANGER LIFE BY THE 
\"REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLES\' STRUGGLE\" ORGANIZATION 
(\"ELA\"), INCLUDING A BOMB ATTACK SEPTEMBER 27 AT 
THE U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARY IN CENTRAL ATHENS. 
- 
- 
4.  OFFICIAL EFFORTS NOTWITHSTANDING, THE 
CONTINUANCE OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY ON GREEK SOIL 
DURING 1987 HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY SIGNIFICANT 
SUCCESSES IN POLICE COUNTER-TERRORIST EFFORTS. 
THE MOST STRIKING SUCCESS ENJOYED BY THE 
AUTHORITIES DURING THE YEAR WAS A VIOLENT 
ENCOUNTER WITH A SMALL GROUP OF TERRORISTS ON 
OCTOBER 1 WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF ONE AND 
THE ARREST OF TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN 
REPORTED TO HAVE CONNECTIONS WITH THE \"ANTI-STATE 
STRUGGLE\" GROUP.  HOWEVER, DESPITE ACTIVE POLICE 
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS EVENT, NO 
FURTHER ARRESTS HAVE YET TAKEN PLACE. 
- 
- 
5.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, GREEK AUTHORITIES 
CONTINUED DURING 1987 THE EFFORTS THEY HAD 
INITIATED EARLIER TO IMPROVE SECURITY AT AIR AND 
SEA PORTS OF ENTRY (PARTICULARLY IN THE 
ATHENS-PIRAEUS AREA), TO IMPROVE SURVEILLANCE OF 
SUSPECTED FOREIGN TERRORISTS, TO ENHANCE THE 
TRAINING AND CAPABILITIES OF POLICE FORCES 
DEDICATED TO FIGHTING TERRORISM AND TO IMPROVE 
COORDINATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES.  PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS HAS BEEN 
COMMENDABLE, ALTHOUGH THERE REMAINS COMSIDERABLE 
ROOM FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT.  THE GREEK 
GOVERNMENT HAS GENERALLY BEEN RESPONSIVE TO U.S. 
GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR PROTECTIVE SECURITY FOR 
ITS PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES LOCATED IN GREECE. 
- 
- 
6.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS AN AMBIVALENT 
ATTITUDE TOWARD STATE-SPONSORED TERRORISM AS AN 
INTERNATIONAL POLICY PROBLEM.  GREECE REMAINS THE 
ONLY MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY WHICH DOES 
NOT CONDEMN STATES WHICH SPONSOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  IT CONTINUES TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS 
FOR \"PROOF\" OF STATE COMPLICITY AND TO INTRODUCE 
SO-CALLED \"NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\" INTO ITS 
DECISIONS ON TERRORIST EVENTS WHICH VIRTUALLY 
PRECLUDE EITHER ANY CONDEMNATION OF THOSE 
RESPONSIBLE OR ANY ACTION LIKELY TO DISCOURAGE 
FURTHER SUCH ACTIVITIES.  GREEK RELUCTANCE TO TAKE 
A MORE ACTIVE POSITION AGAINST STATE-SPONSORED 
TERRORISM IS BASED ON A POLICY WHICH APPARENTLY 
DEFINES SOME TERRORIST ORGANIZATIOMS AS 
\"JUSTIFIABLE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS\". 
- 
- 
7.  DURING THE PERIOD JUNE-AUGUST 1987 THE UNITED 
STATES GOVERNMENT CONDUCTED A DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GREEK GOVERNMENT ABOUT ITS CONCERNS RELATING TO 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AND SPECIFICALLY TO 
REPORTS OF CONTACTS BETWEEN GREEK OFFICIALS AND 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABU NIDAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION (WHICH WERE PUBLICLY AND VEHEMENTLY 
DENIED BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT).  THIS DIALOGUE, 
WHILE CONFIDENTIAL, SERVED TO ENHANCE THE 
AWARENESS OF GREEK AUTHORITIES TO THE DEPTH OF 
AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT TERRORIST ISSUES. 
- 
- 
8.  GREECE RECOGNIZES THE PALESTINE LIBERATION 
ORGANIZATION WHICH MAINTAINS AN ACCREDITED 
DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN ATHENS.  WHILE THE PLO HAS 
ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE RHETORICAL SUPPORT IN GREECE 
(FROM ALL MAJOR POLITICAL FACTIONS), THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE THAT THE GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS ASSISTED 
THE PLO OR ANY OF ITS CONSTITUENT ELEMENTS IN THE 
CONDUCT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  THERE IS ALSO NO 
EVIDENCE THAT GREECE HAS EXTENDED SUPPORT TO ANY 
OTHER ORGANIZATION INVOLVED IN TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES. 
- 
- 
9.  THERE WERE NO JUDICIAL RESPONSES TO TERRORIST 
CASES INVOLVING AMERICANS IN GREECE DURING 1987, 
LARGELY BECAUSE THERE WERE NO ARRESTS OF 
PERPETRATORS DURING THE YEAR.  ON OCTOBER 6 AN 
IMPRISONED MEMBER OF THE \"ARMEMIAN SECRET APMY FOR 
THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA\" (\"ASALA\"), VAHE 
KHODAVERDIAN, WAS RELEASED FROM GREEK PRISON AND 
DEPORTED.  HE HAD BEEN SERVING A TEN YEAR 
SENTENCE, WHICH HE SUCCESSFULLY APPEALED WITH A 
CONSEQUENT REDUCTION TO A TERM OF TWO YEARS WHICH 
AMOUNTED TO TIME SERVED. 
 
10.  THE UNITED STATES MAINTAINS AN ACTIVE 
OFFICIAL DIALOGUE WITH GREEK AUTHORITIES ON ALL 
ASPECTS OF TERRORIST-RELATED ISSUES AND IT SEEKS 
TO ASSIST THE GREEK GOVERNMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE 
IN ITS COUNTER-TERRORIST EFFORTS.

REF:  STATE 357278 
 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS THE EMBASSY\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 
DEPARTMENT\'S UNCLASSIFIED ANNUAL REPORT TO THE 
CONGRESS ON TERRORISM IN 1988. 
 
2.  1988 WAS A VERY BAD YEAR FOR COMBATTING 
TERRORISM IN GREECE.  DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS INCREASED THEIR ACTIVITIES 
IN GREECE DURING THE YEAR, USING MORE LETHAL MEANS 
AGAINST AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF TARGETS.  AMERICAN 
OFFICIALS WERE AT PARTICULAR HAZARD AND ONE U.S. 
EMBASSY OFFICER WAS KILLED.  THERE WERE NO 
SIGNIFICANT COUNTER-TERRORIST SUCCESSES ACHIEVED 
BY THE GREEK GOVERNMENT.  IN CONTRAST, GREEK 
JUSTICE MINISTERS TWICE OVERTURNED DECISIONS OF 
GREEK COURTS AND PERMITTED TERRORISTS WANTED IN 
ITALY TO GO FREE.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT MAINTAINS 
ITS RHETORICAL POSITION AGAINST TERRORISM, BUT THE 
RHETORIC HAS NOT BEEN MATCHED BY DEEDS. 
 
3.  A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS OPERATED 
WITH IMPUNITY IN GREECE IN 1988, CARRYING OUT 
REPEATED BOMBINGS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
FACILITIES.  HOWEVER, THE MOST DANGEROUS AND 
DEADLY TERRORIST ORGANIZATION REMAINS \"NOVEMBER 
17\", WHICH CONTINUED ITS THIRTEEN-YEAR CAMPAIGN OF 
MURDEROUS ATTACKS WHICH HAVE OFTEN BEEN AIMED AT 
U.S. OFFICIALS.  \"NOVEMBER 17\" FAILED IN A JANUARY 
ATTEMPT TO KILL U.S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY 
OFFICIAL GEORGE CARROS WITH A BOMB, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY SUCCEEDED ON JUNE 28 IN 
ASSASSINATING THE U.S. EMBASSY DEFENSE ATTACHE, 
NAVY CAPTAIN WILLIAM NORDEEN, WITH A BOMB OF GREAT 
EXPLOSIVE POWER.  ON AUGUST 14, \"NOVEMBER 17\" 
DEMONSTRATED ITS OPEN CONTEMPT FOR GOVERNMENTAL 
AUTHORITY BY SEIZING A POLICE STATION IN SUBURBAN 
ATHENS, BRIEFLY DETAINING ITS STAFF AND STEALING A 
STORE OF WEAPONS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT.  IN ITS 
FREQUENT WRITTEN PROCLAMATIONS, \"NOVEMBER 17\" HAS 
MANIFESTED A HIGHLY ETHNOCENTRIC AND RADICAL 
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY WHICH INCLUDES AMONG ITS 
PERCEIVED DEMONS THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITY, NATO, THE GREEK GOVERNMENT, ALL GREEK 
POLITICAL PARTIES, A MARKET ECONOMY AND ALMOST ALL 
FACETS OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  WHILE LITTLE 
OF SUBSTANCE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INTERNAL WORKINGS 
OF \"NOVEMBER 17\", IT HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED 
SEVERAL IMPORTANT QUALITIES:  RIGID INTERNAL 
SECURITY, A COMMITMENT TO SELF-PRESERVATION, 
METHODICAL PREPARATION AND EXECUTION OF ATTACKS, 
AND A PREFERENCE FOR HOMICIDAL OPERATIONS.  OVER 
THE PAST TWO YEARS IT HAS ALSO SHOWN A WILLINGNESS 
AND ABILITY TO EXPAND SHARPLY THE NUMBER OF ITS 
ATTACKS WHILE EMPLOYING AN EXPANDED RANGE OF 
TECHNIQUES OF GREATLY ENHANCED LETHALITY.  IN 
THIRTEEN YEARS OF OPERATION, NO MEMBER OF 
\"NOVEMBER 17\" HAS EVER BEEN PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED, 
APPREHENDED OR KILLED. 
 
4.  ANY ILLUSIONS THAT GREECE COULD REMAIN 
UNSCARRED BY THE SCOURGE OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPELLED IN 1988. 
FOREIGN TERRORISTS DEMONSTRATED THEIR ABILITY AND 
INTENT TO USE GREECE AS A BATTLEFIELD AND TO MAKE 
IT A VICTIM AS THEY SAW FIT.  IN APRIL, A 
PROMINENT LEADER OF THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR 
THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA (\"ASALA\") RESIDENT IN 
GREECE, HAGOP HAGOPIAN, WAS ASSASSINATED IN FRONT 
OF HIS HOUSE IN ATHENS IN AN APPARENT INTERNAL 
\"ASALA\" DISPUTE.  IN AN EVENT WHICH ATTRACTED THE 
ATTENTION OF THE WORLD JULY 11, GUNMEN USED 
MACHINE GUNS AND GRENADES TO CONDUCT A MASSACRE OF 
PASSENGERS ABOARD THE DAY EXCURSION BOAT \"CITY OF 
POROS\" IN THE SARONIC GULF NEAR ATHENS.  NINE 
PASSENGERS WERE KILLED AND NEARLY ONE HUNDRED 
INJURED.  ONLY HOURS BEFORE THE ATTACK, AN 
AUTOMOBILE PACKED WITH EXPLOSIVES BLEW UP AT A 
MARINA IN PIRAEUS, THE PORT OF ATHENS, KILLING ITS 
OCCUPANTS.  WHILE NO ORGANIZATION HAS CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TWO EVENTS, WHICH WERE 
ALMOST CERTAINLY CONNECTED, CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE 
POINTS TO THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION.  ALTHOUGH 
THE PURPOSE OF THE ATTACK ON THE \"CITY OF POROS\" 
REMAINS A MATTER OF SPECULATION, IT SEEMS LIKELY 
THAT A MUCH LARGER TERRORIST OPERATION WAS IN 
PREPARATION AND WENT WRONG.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
ARRESTS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EVENTS. 
 
5.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT HAS REPEATEDLY STATED ITS 
\"PRINCIPLED\" POSITION IN OPPOSITION TO TERRORISM 
OF ALL FORMS.  THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT SO FAR 
BEEN MATCHED BY SUBSTANTIVE COUNTER-TERRORIST 
ACHIEVEMENTS.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTEDLY 
INCREASED THE RESOURCES AND PRIORITY IT ASSIGNS TO 
COMBATTING TERRORISM, GREEK SHIPOWNERS HAVE BEEN 
IN THE FOREFRONT INTERNATIONALLY IN PROPOSING AND 
IMPLEMENTING IMPROVED SECURITY MEASURES ON 
PASSENGER VESSELS, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY RECEIVED 
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COOPERATION FROM GREEK 
AUTHORITIES IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE KILLING OF 
CAPTAIN NORDEEN.  HOWEVER, IN 1988 THERE WAS ONLY 
ONE ARREST (CITED BELOW), NO CONVICTIONS AND NO 
EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS IN GREECE. 
INDEED, THE CONTRARY IS THE CASE.  IN NOVEMBER AN 
ATHENS COURT DISMISSED CHARGES AGAINST TWO 
SUSPECTED MEMBERS OF THE \"ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE\" 
ORGANIZATION FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. 
 
6.  MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY, GREEK JUSTICE MINISTERS 
TWICE DURING THE YEAR OVERTURNED RULINGS BY GREEK 
COURTS (INCLUDING THE SUPREME COURT) WHICH FAVORED 
EXTRADITIONS OF PERSONS WANTED IN ITALY FOR 
TERRORIST OFFENSES.  IN FEBRUARY THEN JUSTICE 
MINISTER KOUTSOYIORGAS EXERCISED HIS AUTHORITY TO 
REFUSE THE EXTRADITION OF MAURIZIO FOLINI, WANTED 
IN ITALY FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE \"RED BRIGADES\", 
AND PERMITTED HIM TO GO FREE.  IN DECEMBER JUSTICE 
MINISTER ROTIS REFUSED EXTRADITION TO ITALY OF 
PALESTINIAN ABDEL OZAMA AL-ZUMAR, WANTED FOR HIS 
ROLE IN THE 1982 FATAL BOMBING OF A ROME SYNAGOGUE 
BY THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION, AND ALLOWED HIM TO 
DEPART FOR LIBYA.  IN BOTH CASES THE JUSTICE 
MINISTERS CITED THE SUPPOSEDLY \"POLITICAL\" 
CHARACTER OF THE CRIMES AS THE BASIS FOR 
OVERRULING THE GREEK JUDICIARY.  MINISTER ROTIS 
WENT SO FAR AS TO PUBLICLY REFER TO AL-ZUMAR\'S 
CRIME AS \"AN ACT ON BEHALF OF FREEDOM\" WHICH HE 
COMPARED TO THE WARTIME RESISTANCE IN GREECE TO 
THE NAZI OCCUPATION. 
 
7.  THE SINGLE SUCCESS IN COUNTER-TERRORISM IN 
GREECE DURING 1988 WAS THE DETENTION ON MAY 30 OF 
PALESTINIAN MOHAMMED RASHID, WANTED IN THE UNITED 
STATES FOR THE 1982 BOMBING OF A PAN AMERICAN 
AIRLINER OVER THE PACIFIC IN WHICH A FOURTEEN-YEAR 
OLD JAPANESE BOY WAS KILLED.  ON OCTOBER 10 AN 
ATHENS COURT VOTED TWO-TO-ONE IN FAVOR OF THE U.S. 
REQUEST FOR THE EXTRADITION OF RASHID.  AT YEAR\'S 
END, THE CASE IS BEFORE THE GREEK SUPREME COURT 
FOR CONFIRMATION OF THE DECISION OF THE LOWER 
COURT.  UNDER THE GREEK CONSTITUTION AND THE TERMS 
OF THE BILATERAL EXTRADITION TREATY, THE FINAL 
DECISION ON EXTRADITION WILL LIE WITH THE GREEK 
GOVERNMENT IN THE PERSON OF THE MINISTER OF 
JUSTICE.  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO 
SECRET OF THE GREAT SIGNIFICANCE IT ATTACHES TO 
THE SUCCESSFUL EXTRADITION OF RASHID AND THE 
IMPORTANT PRECEDENT WHICH WOULD BE ESTABLISHED BY 
BRINGING HIM TO JUSTICE. 
 
8.  GREECE MAINTAINS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THE 
PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION (PLO) AND 
PERMITS A PLO OFFICE TO OPERATE IN ATHENS. 
HOWEVER, GREECE HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE 
RECENTLY-DECLARED \"PALESTINIAN STATE\". 
 
9.  DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 1988 IN CONNECTION 
WITH ITS ROLE AS ROTATING PRESIDENT OF THE 
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, GREECE CHAIRED THE ACTIVITIES 
OF THE TREVI GROUP, A COORDINATING BODY OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF EC MEMBERS TO WHICH OTHER 
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., HAVE OBSERVER 
STATUS.  GREECE THEREFORE HOSTED THE SEMI-ANNUAL 
MINISTERIAL MEETING OF THE TREVI GROUP IN ATHENS 
DECEMBER 8-9.  THIS EVENT WAS UNFORTUNATELY 
OVERSHADOWED BY THE RELEASE OF AL-ZUMAR ON THE EVE 
OF THE MEETING.

TRANSLATION OF THE \"ELEFTHEROS TYPOS\" ARTICLE ON 
IRA/IRANIAN CONNECTIONS.  ALSO SEE PARA 3 FOR AN 
ADDITIONAL MEDIA REPORT ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
GREEK AND BRITISH AUTHORITIES SUSPECT THAT A LARGE 
QUANTITY OF HEROIN SMUGGLED TO ENGLAND BY TWO GERMANS 
WHO WERE ARRESTED, WAS INTENDED TO HELP FINANCE IRA 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
ACCORDING TO RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM \"ELEFTHEROS 
TYPOS;\" A GROUP OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE AGENTS 
SPECIALIZING IN IRA ACTIVITIES WILL BE VISITING ATHENS 
AND HAVE REQUESTED A BRIEFING FROM GREEK AUTHORITIES ON 
THE EVIDENCE IN THE DRUG SMUGGLING CASE. 
 
THE TWO GERMANS, YURGEN MERX AND HIS WIFE TUNZA-ANNETTE 
MERX, ADMITTED TO SMUGGLING LARGE QUANTITIES OF 
NARCOTICS TO GREAT BRITAIN ON FOUR OCCASIONS.  BRITISH 
AUTHORITIES HAVE TRAVELED TO GREECE IN HOPES OF 
DETERMINING THE BRITISH RECIPIENTS OF THE NARCOTICS. 
THEY HAVE DEDUCED FROM THE GERMANS TESTIMONY THAT THE 
NARCOTICS WERE INTENDED TO FINANCE IRA ACTIVITIES. 
 
ACCORDING TO INFORMATION EXCHANGED BETWEEN RELEVANT 
AGENCIES, THE SECRET IRANIAN SERVICES ARE BEHIND THE 
PREVIOUSLY SMUGGLED A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT. 
 
THE INVESTIGATION FOCUSED ON PATRICK O\'BRIAN, A 40 YEAR- 
OLD IRISHMAN FROM LIMERICK, WHO FOLLOWED THE SAME ROUTE 
AS THE GERMANS AND WAS ALSO ARRESTED IN GREECE.  HE HAD 
SMUGGLED NARCOTICS WORTH 500 MILLION DRACHMAS (USD 2 
MILLION) FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND TURKEY TO GREAT 
BRITAIN.  LAST SEPTEMBER O\'BRIAN WAS SENTENCED TO SERVE 
A NINE YEAR PRISON TERM IN GREECE.  BOTH GREEK AND 
BRITISH AUTHORITIES HAVE CONNECTED THE O\'BRIAN CASE WITH 
THE RECENT GERMAN ARREST. 
 
ON JANUARY 14, THE ARAB NEWSPAPER \"AL WATAN AL ARABI,\" 
PUBLISHED IN BEIRUT AND PARIS, CONTAINED A DETAILED 
REPORT ON IRA CONTACTS WITH THE IRANIAN SECRET SERVICES. 
THE NEWSPAPER NAMED AMIR HOUSEIN TAGAVI AS HEAD OF THE 
WESTERN EUROPEAN SECTION OF THE IRANIAN SECRET SERVICES, 
AND POSITED THAT TAGAVI COORDINATES CONTACTS BETWEEN THE 
IRA AND (THE GREEK TERRORIST GROUP) \"17 NOVEMBER\" AND 
THE \"REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\" OF ABU NIDAL AND THE 
HEZBOLLAH. 
 
LAST JANUARY THE ITALIAN NEWSPAPER \"CORRIERE DE LA 
SERRA\" REPORTED THAT 17 NOVEMBER MEMBERS HAD VISITED 
TEHRAN AND HAD CONTACTS WITH THE IRANIAN SECRET 
SERVICES.  IRANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE DENIED ANY 
CONNECTIONS, WHILE THE ITALIAN JOURNALIST INSISTS ON THE 
ACCURACY OF HIS INFORMATION.

3.  THE FOLLOWING IS EMBASSY TRANSLATION OF A SEPARATE 
MAY 4 STORY BY THE GREEK DAILY \"ELEFTHEROTYPIA\" ON THIS 
ISSUE: 
 
FROM LONDON, THE NEWSPAPER \"INDEPENDENT\" PUBLISHED AN 
ARTICLE YESTERDAY REPORTING THAT IRAN OFFERED GUNS AND 
MONEY TO THE IRA, ASKING IN RETURN THAT ITS ASSASSINS 
MURDER TOP IRANIAN DISSIDENTS.  REFERRING TO WELL 
INFORMED SOURCES, THE BRITISH NEWSPAPER ALSO REPORTED 
THAT OFFICIALS OF THE IRANIAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES 
PROPOSED THIS DURING A SECRET MEETING IN TEHRAN, LAST 
NOVEMBER.  AFTER THREE MONTHS, HOWEVER, THE IRA REJECTED 
THE OFFER.  REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GREEK TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER, AS WELL AS THE ETA, 
PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING. 
 
LAST WEEK, THE IRANIAN CHARGE D\'AFFAIRS IN LONDON HAS 
SUMMONED TO THE MFA AND HAS ASKED THAT THE CONTACTS OF 
IRAN WITH THE IRA BE STOPPED.  THOSE CONTACTS WERE 
DISCLOSED BY THE BRITISH INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.

2.  SUSPECTED TERRORIST GEORGE BALAFAS WAS ACQUITTED 
ON JULY 25 OF 20 CHARGES RANGING FROM MURDER AND 
ARMED ROBBERY TO MISDEMEANORS.  AN APPEAL TO THIS 
ACQUITTAL WAS GRANTED ON AUGUST 2, AND PROSECUTORS 
ARE NOW PLANNING A RETRIAL ON SOME OF THESE SAME 
CHARGES.  BALAFAS WAS RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 5 
PENDING THE NOVEMBER 18 START OF THE SECOND OF HIS 
THREE TRIALS, ON WEAPONS CHARGES STEMMING FROM 
EVIDENCE FOUND AT THE KALAMA SAFEHOUSE.  BALAFAS\' 
THIRD TRIAL, ON ADDITIONAL WEAPONS AND NARCOTICS 
CHARGES, HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.  HIS GIRLFRIEND 
VASILIKI MIHOU IS A CO-DEFENDANT IN THAT TRIAL. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
B. EXTRADITIONS OR RESPONSES TO EXTRADITIONS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  NO EXTRADITIONS ON TERRORIST CASES WERE MADE 
EITHER TO OR FROM GREECE.  THERE WAS NO GOG ACTION 
ON THE LONG-PENDING EXTRADITION REQUEST BY THE U.S. 
FOR TERRORIST MOHAMED RASHID, CURRENTLY IMPRISONED 
IN GREECE. 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
C. IMPEDIMENTS TO GOG PROSECUTIONS AND EXTRADITIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
4.  TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF IMPEDIMENTS EXIST TO 
SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM.  THEY ARE 1) 
LACK OF A STRONG PUBLIC FEELING AGAINST TERRORISM, 
AND 2) PROBLEMS IN THE POLICE AND LEGAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS HAVE INCLUDED 
INADEQUATE POLICE INVESTIGATIVE METHODS, HIGH 
TURNOVER AND POLITICIZATION AT ALL LEVELS IN THE 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, LACK OF A WITNESS PROTECTION 
PROGRAM, AND THREATS AGAINST JUDGES AND WITNESSES. 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PRIORITY PAID BY 
DIFFERENT MINISTRIES TO COMBATTING TERRORISM 
UNDERMINES POLICE MORALE AND HAS PRODUCED AN UNEVEN 
RESPONSE AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
5.  THE VISIT OF THE THEN-TRANSPORTATION AND 
COMMUNICATIONS MINISTER TO ACCUSED TERRORIST GEORGE 
BALAFAS, AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS BY GOVERNMENT PARTY 
PARLIAMENTARIANS CALLING FOR BALAFAS\' RELEASE, 
REFLECTED POLITICAL AND POPULAR SUPPORT FOR BALAFAS, 
AND SUGGESTED TOLERATION OF TERRORISM IN GENERAL. 
THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE POPULAR AND POLITICAL 
REACTION TO TERRORIST ATTACKS, BASED IN PART ON 
GREEK POLITICAL HISTORY AND IN PART ON THE CHOICE OF 
VICTIMS, WHO ARE PERCEIVED BY SOME ELEMENTS OF GREEK 
SOCIETY AS DESERVING PUNISHMENT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
D. GOG RESPONSES - STATEMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
6.  COG OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
PRIME MINISTER CONDEMNED TERRORISM ON NUMEROUS 
OCCASIONS, STATING THAT ERADICATION OF TERRORISM IS 
A GOG PRIORITY.  THEY PROMISED CLOSE COOPERATION 
WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY WITH THE USG, 
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISTS. 
 
7.  THERE WERE OVER TWENTY SIGNIFICANT TERRORIST 
ACTS IN GREECE IN 1994, INCLUDING ASSASSINATIONS OF 
A FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF GREECE AND 
A TURKISH DIPLOMAT, AND THE BOMBING OF A POLICE BUS 
RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF A SENIOR POLICE OFFICAL 
AND INJURIES TO TEN CIVIL SERVANTS.  ROUTINE POLICE 
INVESTIGATIONS OF ALL THESE ATTACKS HAVE NOT 
RESULTED IN ANY BREAKTHROUGHS.  IN ADDITION, ON A 
MONTHLY BASIS GREECE EXPERIENCES AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 
TERRORIST-TYPE INCIDENTS (MOSTLY BOMBINGS), MOST OF 
WHICH ARE DONE BY ANARCHIST GROUPS OR APPEAR TO BE 
PERSONAL VENDETTAS.  THIS IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN 
EUROPE. 
 
-------------------------------- 
E. GOG COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
8.  INTERNAL GOVERNMENT DISSENSION AND LACK OF 
INTER-MINISTERIAL COOPERATION HAS BLUNTED EFFORTS TO 
CREATE AND ENFORCE EFFECTIVE COUNTER-TERRORISM 
PROGRAMS.  FOLLOWING THE BOMBING DEATH OF A SENIOR 
POLICE OFFICIAL ON SEPTEMBER 19, THE GOG DOUBLED THE 
REWARD FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE AND 
CONVICTION OF TERRORISTS TO 500 MILLION DRACHMAS 
(USD 2.1 MILLION). 
 
------------------------------------------ 
F. GOG SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
------------------------------------------ 
9.  THE ERNK (NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT OF 
KURDISTAN), THE POLITICAL WING OF THE PKK (KURDISTAN 
WORKERS\' PARTY), MAINTAINS AN OFFICE IN ATHENS.  THE 
HEAD OF THAT OFFICE GAVE A PROVOCATIVE INTERVIEW TO 
THE GREEK PRESS IN WHICH HE WARNED THAT TERRORISM IN 
TURKEY WOULD CONTINUE, THAT GREEK TOURISTS AND 
BUSINESSMEN SHOULD AVOID TURKEY, AND THAT CASUALTIES 
WERE LIKELY THERE.  THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL GOG 
REACTION.  IN NOVEMBER, HOWEVER, THE PRESS REPORTED 
THAT THE GOG DENIED A VISA TO PKK LEADER KANI 
YILMAZ.  ALLEGATIONS OF CAMPS AND TRAINING IN GREECE 
FOR THE PKK WERE DENIED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BY THE 
GOG. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
G. GOG SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10.  NO SUCH STATEMENTS WERE MADE, ALTHOUGH GREECE 
MAINTAINS GOOD RELATIONS WITH SYRIA AND LIBYA. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
H. MAJOR CHANGE IN GOG ATTITUDE TOWARDS TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
11.  UNFORTUNATELY, 1994 SAW NO IMPROVEMENT IN 
COUNTER-TERRORISM IN GREECE.  THE REPEAL OF THE 
COUNTER-TERRORISM LAW IN DECEMBER, 1993 WAS NOT 
HELPFUL IN THE COUNTER-TERRORISM EFFORT, NOR WAS THE 
SYMBOLISM SHOWN IN THE BALAFAS CASE.  THESE ACTIONS 
CONTRIBUTED TO AN ATMOSPHERE IN WHICH TERRORISTS 
WERE VIEWED WITH SOME SYMPATHY INSTEAD OF AS PUBLIC 
ENEMIES, AND HAD A STULTIFYING EFFECT ON EFFECTIVE 
COUNTER-TERRORISM.

E.O.  12958:  N/A 
TAGS:  PTER, GR 
SUBJECT:  GREECE:  1999 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  STATE 204472 
 
1.  THE TEXT BELOW IS OUR DRAFT CONTRIBUTION TO THE GREEK SECTION 
IN THE FORTHCOMING \"PATTERNS OF GLOBAL TERRORISM:  1999,\" AS 
REQUIRED BY REFTEL. 
 
2.  PROGRESS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM IN GREECE CONTINUED 
TO PROVE ILLUSIVE IN 1999 AS THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AGAINST 
U.S., OTHER FOREIGN, AND GREEK INTERESTS PROLIFERATED 
SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  INTERNATIONAL EVENTS RE- 
IGNITED A LATENT ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING IN GREECE, WHICH 
TERRORISTS AND ANARCHISTS EXPLOITED.  THE AUTHORITIES FAILED TO 
ARREST A SINGLE MEMBER OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION IN 1999 AND 
CONVICTED ONLY TWO SUSPECTS FOR ATTACKS MOUNTED IN PREVIOUS 
YEARS.  GREEK AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO PROMISE REFORMS IN 
COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVES AND METHODS, BUT RESULTS ARE 
INCONCLUSIVE. 
 
FOLLOWING HIS DEPORTATION FROM SYRIA IN OCTOBER 1998 UNTIL HIS 
CAPTURE IN NAIROBI IN FEBRUARY 1999, PKK LEADER ABDULLAH OCALAN 
TRANSITED GREECE THREE TIMES.  EACH TIME, GREEK OFFICIALS QUIETLY 
EXPELLED HIM.  SUBSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL CABINET AND OTHER SENIOR 
OFFICIALS TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING PROVIDED OCALAN 
TEMPORARY SAFE HAVEN IN THE GREEK AMBASSADOR\'S RESIDENCE IN KENYA 
AND WERE COMPELLED TO RESIGN.  IN MARCH, GREECE\'S MOST DEADLY 
TERRORIST GROUP, \"REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER,\" ISSUED 
A MANIFESTO PLACING RESPONSIBILITY FOR OCALAN\'S ARREST ON THE 
GREEK AND U.S. GOVERNMENTS.  IT ALSO BLAMED THE GREEK GOVERNMENT 
MORE GENERALLY FOR FAILING TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY\'S INTERESTS 
VIS-A-VIS TURKEY. 
 
BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY, INDIGENOUS TERRORIST AND ANARCHIST GROUPS 
MOUNTED NUMEROUS ATTACKS AGAINST WESTERN INTERESTS IN GREECE IN 
SEEKING TO EXPLOIT PUBLIC UNHAPPINESS OVER THE OCALAN ARREST AND 
NATO OPERATIONS AGAINST SERBIA DURING THE KOSOVO CRISIS. 
NUMEROUS ANTI-U.S. AND ANTI-NATO DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTED THE AIR 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST SERBIA.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED A PUBLIC 
ANNOUNCEMENT, VALID FOR EIGHT WEEKS, INFORMING POTENTIAL U.S. 
TRAVELERS TO GREECE ABOUT THE SECURITY CLIMATE. 
 
\"17 NOVEMBER\" IS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT ROCKET ATTACKS AGAINST 
SIX TARGETS IN APRIL AND MAY ALTHOUGH IT NEVER CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE OPERATIONS:  THE RESIDENCES OF THE 
GERMAN AND DUTCH AMBASSADORS, BRANCH OFFICES OF THE RULING PASOK 
PARTY, A CHASE MANHATTAN BANK, A BRITISH BANK, AND A FRENCH BANK. 
OTHER TERRORIST AND ANARCHIST GROUPS TARGETED NUMEROUS U.S., 
EUROPEAN, AND GREEK BANKS AND BUSINESSES, A POLICE STATION, THE 
GREEK-ISRAELI FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION, THE AUSTRIAN EMBASSY\'S 
COMMERCIAL OFFICE, AND A UN-AFFILIATED BUILDING.  THE 
PERPETRATORS PLANTED EXPLOSIVE OR INCENDIARY DEVICES (SOME WERE 
DEFUSED) OR STAGED DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS FROM MOTORCYCLES.  AMONG 
THE GROUPS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACKS WERE \"RED 
LINE,\" \"REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI,\" \"BLACK STAR,\" \"ENRAGED 
ANARCHISTS,\" AND \"FILIKI ETAIREIA.\"  MOST ATTACKS WERE TIMED TO 
OCCUR WHEN INJURIES WERE NOT LIKELY TO TAKE PLACE. 
\"REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI\" WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOMBING THE 
INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL IN APRIL, WHICH KILLED ONE GREEK CITIZEN 
AND INJURED ANOTHER.  NO ARRESTS WERE MADE IN ANY OF THESE 
INCIDENTS. 
 
A YOUNG WOMAN ATTEMPTED TO FIREBOMB THE U.S. CONSULATE IN 
THESSALONIKI IN EARLY APRIL, BUT A GUARD EMPLOYED BY THE FACILITY 
FRUSTRATED THE ATTACK AND ALERTED THE POLICE.  AFTER A FEW DAYS\' 
DETENTION, AUTHORITIES RELEASED THE WOMAN INTO THE CUSTODY OF HER 
PARENTS.  LATER THAT MONTH, A BOMB WAS ALSO PLACED AT THE OFFICES 
OF THE FULBRIGHT FOUNDATION IN THESSALONIKI, BUT IT WAS DEFUSED 
AND DESTROYED BEFORE IT COULD EXPLODE. 
 
IN ADDITION, NUMEROUS UNIDENTIFIED CALLERS TO THE U.S. EMBASSY 
ANNOUNCED BOMB ATTACKS AND OTHER LIFE-THREATENING ACTS AGAINST 
THE CHANCERY, U.S. AND GREEK EMPLOYEES, THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY 
SCHOOL, THE CONSULATE IN THESSALONIKI, AND U.S.-AFFILIATED HOTELS 
IN ATHENS.  ALL OF THESE CALLS TURNED OUT TO BE HOAXES. 
 
FOCUSING ON THE \"17 NOVEMBER\" THREAT, U.S. COUNTERTERRORIST 
COORDINATOR SHEEHAN CAME TO GREECE IN JULY FOR CONSULTATION WITH 
MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER CHRYSOCHOIDIS TO ENHANCE 
COUNTERTERRORIST COOPERATION.  CHRYSOCHOIDIS, WHO VISITED 
WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS, PUBLICLY OUTLINED 
HIS PLANS TO MODERNIZE THE HELLENIC POLICE WITH THE AIM OF 
COMBATTING \"17 NOVEMBER.\"  SINCE ITS FIRST KNOWN CRIMINAL ACT IN 
1975, THE MURDER OF A U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIAL, NO MEMBER OF \"17 
NOVEMBER\" HAS BEEN ARRESTED.  ALTOGETHER, \"17 NOVEMBER\" HAS 
MURDERED FOUR U.S. DIPLOMATS AND ONE GREEK EMBASSY EMPLOYEE AND 
HAS WOUNDED NUMEROUS AMERICAN OFFICIALS. 
 
THE HELLENIC POLICE DISCOVERED BLOOD PRESUMABLY BELONGING TO THE 
PERPETRATOR OF THE ATTACK IN MAY ON THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR\'S 
RESIDENCE.  GREEK PRESS REPORTS IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER CLAIMED 
THAT AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY BOTH THE TYPE AND DNA 
OF THE BLOOD SAMPLE AND WERE NARROWING THE SEARCH FOR THE 
PERPETRATOR. 
 
NIKOS MAZIOTIS WAS CONVICTED OF A BOMBING ATTACK AGAINST THE 
DEVELOPMENT MINISTRY IN 1997 AND SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS.  GIORGOS 
BALAFAS, WHO HAS SERVED TIME FOR MORE SERIOUS TERRORIST-RELATED 
ACTIVITIES IN THE PAST, WAS SENTENCED TO SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS 
FOR WEAPONS AND DRUG POSSESSION.  HIS CRIMES WERE TREATED AS AN 
ORDINARY CRIMINAL CASE EVEN THOUGH THEY STEMMED FROM EARLIER 
TERRORIST-RELATED CHARGES.  BALAFAS REMAINS FREE ON BAIL WHILE HE 
APPEALS HIS CASE. 
 
FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S VISIT TO 
GREECE, NOVEMBER 19-20, A SERIES OF EXPLOSIVE OR INCENDIARY 
ATTACKS (AGAIN, SOME OF WHICH DEFUSED) AND DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS 
TARGETED U.S., OTHER FOREIGN, AND GREEK BANKS AND BUSINESSES, AS 
WELL AS A POST OFFICE, THE GREEK-AMERICAN UNION, THE OFFICE OF A 
FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER FROM THE OPPOSITION NEW DEMOCRACY 
PARTY, AND A COMMUNIST PARTY BRANCH OFFICE.  THE \"TEAM FOR ANTI- 
STATE ACTION\" TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOME OF THESE THE ATTACKS. 
THERE WERE NO ARRESTS. 
 
DURING COMMUNIST-ORGANIZED DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE EVENING OF THE 
PRESIDENT\'S ARRIVAL, ABOUT 75 TO 80 PEOPLE FIREBOMBED OR LOOTED 
ALMOST 90 BUSINESSES IN DOWNTOWN ATHENS.  THE POLICE ARRESTED 
ABOUT 30 INDIVIDUALS.  FOUR BOMB THREATS WERE ALSO CALLED INTO 
THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE PRESIDENT\'S 
STAY THERE.  IN ADDITION, AN UNIDENTIFIED RADIO OPERATOR SIGNALED 
TO AIR FORCE ONE SHORTLY AFTER THE PRESIDENT\'S DEPARTURE FROM 
ATHENS THAT A BOMB HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE AIRCRAFT.  THREE MORE 
THREATS OF A BOMB OR ROCKET ATTACK ON THE AIRCRAFT WERE PHONED IN 
SHORTLY BEFORE ITS TAKE-OFF.  ALL THESE THREATS PROVED TO BE 
HOAXES.

TAGS:  PREL, ECIN, ZL, GR 
SUBJECT:  ENGAGING GREECE ON THE BALKANS: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A 
YEAR CAN MAKE 
 
CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION TERRY R. SNELL, REASONS 1.5 
(B,D) 
 
1. (C) LAST APRIL OUR EMBASSY ENDURED DAILY DEMONSTRATIONS, MANY 
OF THEM VIOLENT, BY ANGRY GREEKS PROTESTING THE NATO AIR CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST SERBIA.  EMOTIONS RAN HIGH WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM AND PRO- 
SERB EMOTIONALISM OFTEN TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN.  ALTHOUGH 
POLLS INDICATED OVER 90 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION OPPOSED THE AIR 
STRIKES, PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS AND FOREIGN MINISTER PAPANDREOU 
PERFORMED A DELICATE BALANCING ACT BY KEEPING GREECE FROM 
RUPTURING THE NATO CONSENSUS.  THE GREEK GOVERNMENT ON APRIL 21- 
22 WILL BE UNOFFICIALLY CO-HOSTING A SERB OPPOSITION LEADERS 
CONFERENCE IN ATHENS.  NO ONE IN THE GREEK GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS 
THE PREMISE THAT THE MILOSEVIC REGIME MUST GO.  GREEK DIFFERENCES 
WITH THE U.S. ARE CENTERED ON THE APPROPRIATE TACTICS, ESPECIALLY 
THE EFFICACY OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST BELGRADE. 
 
2. (C) TEN DAYS AGO, LARGELY FOR DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REASONS, 
VOTERS RE-ELECTED THE SIMITIS GOVERNMENT FOR A SECOND TERM.  WITH 
PASOK THE WINNER IN THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS, PM SIMITIS IS 
STARTING TO STRIP THE PARTY OF ITS ANDREAS PAPANDREOU LEGACY AND 
FIRMLY ESTABLISH GREECE IN EUROPE\'S PROGRESSIVE POLITICAL CENTER. 
DESPITE SOME CHANGES AT THE SUBMINISTERIAL LEVEL, THE FOREIGN AND 
DEFENSE MINISTRIES CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PROMOTING 
RAPPROCHEMENT WITH TURKEY, AN INCREASED GREEK ROLE IN THE BALKANS 
AND A PRODUCTIVE, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. 
 
3. (C) PM SIMITIS WILL BE PRESENTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT\'S PROGRAM 
TO THE PARLIAMENT ON APRIL 21.  GREECE WILL JOIN THE EUROPEAN AND 
ECONOMIC MONETARY UNION (EMU) IN JANUARY AND MUCH OF SIMITIS\'S 
PROGRAM WILL BE DEVOTED TO STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN THE 
REQUIRED MACROECONOMIC DISCIPLINE IMPOSED BY EMU AND A 
RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNMENT SOCIAL PROGRAMS IMPORTANT TO MOST 
GREEKS AND ESPECIALLY PASOK\'S CONSTITUENCY.  SIMITIS BELIEVES IN 
CABINET GOVERNMENT AND FM PAPANDREOU WILL TAKE THE LEAD IN 
SHAPING GREECE\'S FOREIGN POLICY.  AS IN THE LAST GOVERNMENT, 
IMLEMENTATION OF ANY NEW INITIATIVES ARE LIKELY TO BE SLOWED BY 
AN INEFFICIENT AND UNCOORDINATED GREEK FOREIGN MINISTRY 
BUREAUCRACY. 
 
4. (C) IN YOUR MEETINGS WITH PAPANDREOU AND DEFENSE MINISTER 
TSOHATZOPOULOS, YOUR OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE GREECE TO 
TAKE ON A GREATER LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMING 
SOUTHEAST EUROPE.   WHILE RECOGNIZING GREECE\'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
STABILITY IN THE REGION, YOU MAY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR 
GREATER FOLLOW THROUGH BY THE FOREIGN MINISTRY TO ENSURE THAT 
PERFORMANCE MATCHES PUBLIC RHETORIC.  THE FOLLOWING POINTS COVER 
SOME OF THE SPECIFIC BALKAN ISSUES YOU MAY WANT TO RAISE: 
 
-- APPRECIATE GREECE\'S CONTRIBUTION OF TROOPS TO KFOR AND SFOR. 
GREEK SUPPORT FOR MODERATE SERB KOSOVARS CAN PROVE VITAL IN 
BUILDING A MULTI-ETHNIC SOCIETY IN KOSOVO. 
 
-- REITERATE U.S. POLICY ON NO CHANGE OF BORDERS IN THE BALKANS. 
 
-- IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PRESSURE ON MILOSEVIC REGIME THROUGH 
STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS.  MUST ISOLATE BELGRADE 
AND CUT-OFF HARD CURRENCY EARNINGS USED TO PROP UP THE REGIME. 
 
-- HIGHLIGHT NEED FOR SUPPORT IN EU TO ACCELERATE ECONOMIC 
ASSISTANCE TO MONTENEGRO. 
 
-- ENCOURAGE GREATER PUBLIC SUPPORT BY GREECE FOR SERB 
OPPOSITION, INCLUDING NGOS AND OTHER CIVIL GROUPS AS WELL AS 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN TO HIGHLIGHT MILOSEVIC\'S REPRESSIVE 
TACTICS AGAINST MEDIA AND CRITICS. 
 
-- NOTE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF MEETINGS WITH LEADERS OF GREECE\'S 
NEIGHBORS (ALBANIA, FYROM AND BULGARIA) AND PROSPECTS FOR GREATER 
COOPERATION ARISING FROM THESE IMPROVED RELATIONS. 
 
-- SUGGEST INCREASED GREEK ROLE IN REGIONAL INITIATIVES SUCH AS 
SECI (BUCHAREST ANTI-CRIME CENTER), STABILITY PACT (TABLE ONE ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS) AND SEDM. 
 
5. (C) OVER THE HORIZON, PAPANDREOU AND TSOHATZOPOULOS WILL BE 
LOOKING TO HEAR A BRIEF ARTICULATION OF YOUR VIEWS ON THE U.S.- 
GREECE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  WE SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
-- IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE ANNUAL BILATERAL CONSULATIONS BEGUN 
BY A/S GROSSMAN. 
 
-- SEEK COMMITMENT FOR MORE FREQUENT VISITS AT DAS LEVEL TO 
FOLLOW-UP ON POLICY INITIATIVES. 
 
-- ENCOURAGE GREEKS TO ADD SUBSTANCE TO, DEFEND, AND PROMOTE THE 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. 
 
-- NOTE UPCOMING REPORTS (NEXT WEEK) ON IPR AND TERRORISM; GREECE 
NEEDS TO RESOLVE THE WTO IPR CASE AND MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS 
ON COUNTER-TERRORISM TO MOVE OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP FORWARD. 
A COUNTER-TERRORISM BREAKTHROUGH IS IMPORTANT FOR AMERICANS\' 
SECURITY IN GREECE. 
 
-- STRESS NEED TO NAIL DOWN DECISION ON F-16 ENGINES; PUSH FOR 
GREEK DECISION TO PURCHASE U.S. M1-A2 TANKS - THE BEST IN THE 
WORLD (WITH TSOHATZOPOULOS ONLY). 
 
-- SUPPORT CONTINUED GREEK RISK-TAKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH 
TURKEY AND REACH POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ON CYPRUS.  STRESS 
WILLINGNESS OF U.S. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS 
POSSIBLE.  EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH ANKARA FOR A 
CONCRETE TURKISH STEP TO IMPROVE GREEK-TURKEY RELATIONS AND PUSH 
FORWARD CYPRUS TALKS. 
 
-- ENCOURAGE GREECE TO FACILITATE FULL TURKISH PARTICIPATION IN 
NATO EXERCISE \"DYNAMIC MIX;\"  WOULD REBOUND TO GREECE\'S CREDIT. 
 
-- PREVIEW OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY PAPANDREOU-CEM-ALBRIGHT 
MEETINGS IN TWO WEEKS IN NEW YORK TO MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS ON 
GREECE-TURKEY-CYPRUS ISSUES.

E.O.  12958:  DECL:  04/20/10 
TAGS:  PTER, GR 
SUBJECT:  PRESS SUPPLEMENT ON THE 25-YEAR HISTORY OF 17 NOVEMBER 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR R. NICHOLAS BURNS; REASON 1.5 (B,D) 
 
1.  (U) THE ATHENS DAILY, \"ELEFTHEROTYPIA,\" PUBLISHED A DETAILED 
23-PAGE SUPPLEMENT TO ITS APRIL 15 EDITION, ENTITLED \"25 YEARS OF 
17N.\"  AT FIRST BLUSH, THE SUPPLEMENT SEEMED TO BE A TYPE OF 
EXPOSE ON 17 NOVEMBER.  ON CLOSER READING, THE COVERAGE\'S MESSAGE 
IS NOT HARD-HITTING.  INDEED, THE SUPPLEMENT MAKES A CASE FOR A 
KIND OF ARMISTICE BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND 17 NOVEMBER AND AN 
INFORMAL AMNESTY FOR THOSE WHO COMMITTED TERRORIST CRIMES. 
 
2.  (U) THE SUPPLEMENT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO ROUGHLY TWO PARTS. 
THE FIRST PRESENTS A FACTUAL HISTORY OF 17 NOVEMBER\'S TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES BEGINNING WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD WELCH IN 
DECEMBER 1975, COMPLETE WITH A DETAILED AND NEARLY COMPREHENSIVE 
CHRONOLOGY AND A MAP OF MAJOR 17 NOVEMBER ATTACKS IN GREATER 
ATHENS.  THE ARTICLES AND INTERVIEWS IN THE FIRST PART CONTAIN 
ALMOST NO NEW INFORMATION AND PRESENT LONG-STANDING, WELL-KNOWN 
VIEWS.  COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN 
PUBLICIZED BEFORE (AND COULD ONLY HAVE COME FROM POLICE FILES), 
ALSO APPEAR.  AMONG THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS PART OF THE 
SUPPLEMENT ARE: 
 
     -- PROSECUTOR IOANNIS DIOTIS, WHO ARGUES THAT THE 
COUNTERTERRORIST LAWS NOW IN THE BOOKS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR 
PURSUING 17 NOVEMBER AND SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS.  THE WEAKNESS, HE 
SAYS, IS THE JURY SYSTEM, WHICH OFFERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRIBERY 
AND THREATS.  DIOTIS SAYS JURIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR 
TERRORIST CASES. 
 
     -- LAW PROFESSOR NIKOS PARASKEVOPOULOS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 
THESSALONIKI, WHO DISCUSSES THE HISTORY OF COUNTERTERRORIST PENAL 
LEGISLATION. 
 
     -- NEW DEMOCRACY DEPUTY DORA BAKOGIANNI (INTERVIEW), WHOSE 
HUSBAND, PAVLOS BAKOGIANNIS, AN ND MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, WAS 
GUNNED DOWN BY 17 NOVEMBER IN 1989.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, SHE SAYS 
THAT PASOK\'S REPEAL OF THE COUNTERTERRORIST LAWS PASSED BY THE 
MITSOTAKIS WAS A MISTAKE THAT HAD NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES.  SHE 
BELIEVES THAT JURIES SHOULD NOT BE A PART OF TERRORIST TRIALS. 
 
     -- FORMER PASOK PUBLIC ORDER MINISTER STELIOS PAPATHEMELIS 
(INTERVIEW), WHO SUGGESTS THAT 17 NOVEMBER HAS BECOME A KIND OF 
EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION THAT DIRECTS OTHERS AND PROBABLY NO LONGER 
REPRESENTS ITS PAST FANATICAL LEFTIST VIEWS EVEN THOUGH IT MAY 
CONTINUE TO USE THE RADICAL VOCABULARY OF AN EARLIER ERA. 
 
3.  (U)  THE SECOND PART OF THE SUPPLEMENT, COMPRISING AN 
INTERVIEW, TWO ESSAYS, AND AN UNSIGNED ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO HOW 
TO APPROACH THE 17 NOVEMBER QUESTION, EFFECTIVELY PROMOTING AN 
INFORMAL AMNESTY. 
 
     -- IN AN INTERVIEW, YIANNIS PANOUSIS, IDENTIFIED AS A 
PROFESSOR OF CRIMINOLOGY, ARGUES THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE 
GREEK GOVERNMENT TO ARRIVE AT A \"POLITICAL\" SOLUTION TO THE 17 
NOVEMBER ISSUE.  THE GOVERNMENT, HE SAYS, SHOULD CONSIDER 
\"REHABILITATION\" OF 17 NOVEMBER MEMBERS, ADDING THAT THE GREEK 
PEOPLE \"HAVE FORGIVEN GERMANS, TURKS, AND THE JUNTA.\"  THE 
INTERVIEW IS ENTITLED, \"A VARKIZA IS NEEDED FOR TERRORISM,\" 
REFERRING TO THE TOWN SOUTH OF ATHENS WHERE THE COMMUNIST-LED 
RESISTANCE AND THE BRITISH-BACKED ROYAL GOVERNMENT SIGNED AN 
ARMISTICE IN 1945 AFTER INITIAL FIGHTING, FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL 
OF GERMAN OCCUPATION FORCES. 
 
     -- IN HER ESSAY, \"POLITICAL VIOLENCE:  A GREEK UNIQUENESS,\" 
MARY BOSSI, A FORMER HIGH-LEVEL PUBLIC ORDER MINISTRY OFFICIAL 
RESPONSIBLE FOR COUNTERTERRORISM UNDER THEN PRIME MINISTER 
MITSOTAKIS, REPEATS HER WELL-KNOWN VIEWS.  SHE IS CRITICAL OF 
WHAT SHE CALLS THE \"APOLOGETIC\" POSTURE OF GREEK GOVERNMENTS VIS- 
A-VIS THE U.S. ON ITS EFFORTS TO CAPTURE THE TERRORISTS. 
SUGGESTING AN AMNESTY, BOSSI SAYS THAT THE \"HONORABLE RETIREMENT\" 
OF THE 17 NOVEMBER QUESTION WOULD BE A KIND OF A SOLUTION. 
 
     -- SOPHIA VIDALI, A LECTURER AT THE SOCIAL ADMINISTRATION 
FACULTY OF THE DEMOCRITUS UNIVERSITY OF THRACE, STATES IN HER 
ESSAY, \"TIME TO FACE POLITICAL MEASURES,\" THAT THE MAIN VIOLENT 
THREAT CONFRONTING GREECE TODAY IS MAINSTREAM CRIME RATHER 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED TERRORISM.  SHE SAYS THAT TERRORISM IS NOW 
A QUESTION ONLY OF FOREIGN RELATIONS.  TERRORISM, SHE CONTINUES, 
SHOULD BE DEALT WITH ON \"POLITICAL TERMS.\"  WHILE THE VICTIMS OF 
TERRORISM SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN, SHE ARGUES THAT A \"DEMOCRATIC 
POLITICAL SYSTEM CANNOT FUNCTION ON THE BASIS OF RETRIBUTION.\" 
 
     -- AN UNSIGNED ARTICLE STATES THAT, ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY 
PROSECUTION OFFICIALS, 17 NOVEMBER\'S TERRORIST ACTIVITIES HAVE 
DECREASED AND ARE LIKELY TO FALL TO ZERO IN THE FUTURE. 
NEVERTHELESS, THE REPORT NOTES THAT 17 NOVEMBER COULD BECOME 
ACTIVE AGAIN AND WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED THE NUMBER ONE 
TERRORIST THREAT FOR GREECE. 
 
4.  (C) COMMENT:  THE IDEA OF A \"POLITICAL SETTLEMENT\" OF THE 
TERRORIST QUESTION IN GREECE, HOWEVER UNWELCOME, IS NOT 
ALTOGETHER NEW.  DEVOTING AN ENTIRE SUPPLEMENT TO THE ISSUE IS A 
DEPARTURE IN PRESS PRACTICE, HOWEVER.  IN THE PAST, 
\"ELEFTHEROTYPIA,\" WITH THE SECOND LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ALL 
GREEK NEWSPAPERS, HAS SERVED AS A MOUTHPIECE FOR LEFT-WING CAUSES 
AND HAS PUBLISHED PROCLAMATIONS OF 17 NOVEMBER.  THE TONE OF THE 
SUPPLEMENT IS THEREFORE NOT SURPRISING.  WE WILL NEED TO BLUNT 
THIS LINE OF ARGUMENTATION WHEN WE LAUNCH OUR REWARDS PROGRAM IN 
THE COMING MONTH.  LEST THERE BE VOICES IN THE SIMITIS 
ADMINISTRATION PUSHING FOR A \"POLITICAL\" SOLUTION,\" WE WILL ALSO 
NEED TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO THE GREEK GOVERNMENT THAT THIS 
IS NOT THE KIND OF RESOLUTION OF THE TERRORIST PROBLEM THAT WE 
HAVE IN MIND.  INTERESTINGLY, THE SUPPLEMENT HAS GONE VIRTUALLY 
UNNOTICED AND UNREMARKED IN THE GREEK POLITICAL SCENE.  THAT, BY 
ITSELF, DEMONSTRATES THE UPHILL TASK WE FACE IN GALVANIZING 
PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR GREEK GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF A ZERO- 
TOLERANCE POLICY ON TERRORISM.

1. (SBU) DepEconCouns delivered reftel points on September 18  to 
Dr. Nike-Catherine Koutrakou, Director of Emergency Humanitarian 
and Food Aid Programs at Hellenic Aid (HA).  On September 23, Dr. 
Koutrakou advised DepEconCouns that the GoG has made Ethiopia and 
Somalia two of its highest priority countries for assistance (in 
addition to Afghanistan and the Palestinian Authority).  While 
Kenya is not one of Greece\'s high priority countries, the GoG has 
allocated assistance funding to it and will continue to do so.  In 
addition, Koutrakou has proposed to HA\'s leadership that Kenya be 
added to Greece\'s list of high priority countries.  Koutrakou 
advised that to date in 2009, HA has given to the World Food 
Program (WFP) EUR450,000 for Ethiopia, EUR150,000 for Somalia, and 
EUR300,000 for Kenya.  In response to the most recent humanitarian 
appeal, Koutrakou told DepEconCouns that she has proposed to 
Ambassador Mercourios Karafotias, Director General of Hellenic Aid, 
that Greece donate an additional EUR300,000 for these three 
countries through the WFP.  No decision, however, can be made on 
whether and when to provide this additional assistance until a new 
Greek government assumes power [Note: Greece\'s Prime Minister 
recently called snap elections, which will take place on October 4. 
End Note].  Reiterating statements made by Ambassador Karafotias to 
DepEconCouns in the past, Koutrakou emphasized that Foreign 
Minister Dora Bakoyannis wants HA, which falls under the MFA, to 
support USG assistance priorities whenever possible.  While 
Koutrakou is not sure whether this policy will be continued under a 
new government, if the MFA\'s new political leaders are put in place 
in a timely fashion and agree, HA could be in a position to donate 
the EUR300,000 to the WFP by mid-November.

SUBJECT: GREECE: 2002 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: A. STATE 201772 
     B. ATHENS 3967 AND PREVIOUS 
     C. ATHENS 3285 
 
 
THE FOLLOWING IS POST\'S SUBMISSION FOR THE 2002 \"PATTERNS OF 
GLOBAL TERRORISM\" REPORT.  RESPONSES ARE KEYED TO REF (A). 
 
A: 
1.  IN SUPPORT OF THE GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM, THE 
GOG HAS ROTATED THREE FRIGATES (HS SPETSES, HS ADRIAS, AND HS 
PSARA) THROUGH ARABIAN SEA DUTY.  EACH FRIGATE CARRIES 
APPROXIMATELY 200 CREW MEMBERS, A S-70B6 HELICOPTER, AND A 
UNIT OF HELLENIC NAVY COMMANDOS.  GREECE HAS ALSO BEEN 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE 
(ISAF) IN AFGHANISTAN.  A 134-PERSON CONTINGENT (FROM THE 
GREEK CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND SUPPORT UNITS) IS IN PLACE IN 
KABUL.  TWO HELLENIC AIR FORCE C-130 AIRCRAFT BASED IN 
PAKISTAN ARE ALSO IN THE AFGHAN THEATER.  FOR MONTHS AFTER 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TWENTY-ONE GREEK PILOTS AND SUPPORT 
PERSONNEL WERE AMONG NATO CREWS PILOTING AWACS AIRCRAFT OVER 
THE U.S. 
 
2.  THE GOG FULLY SUPPORTS UNSCR 1373 AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORT TO COMBAT THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM.  IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH EUROPEAN COMMISSION REGULATIONS, GREECE HAS ORDERED ALL 
BANKS AND CREDIT INSTITUTIONS TO SEARCH FOR ACCOUNTS OF USAMA 
BIN LADEN, THE AL-QAIDA TERRORIST NETWORK, AND OFFICIALS OF 
THE FORMER TALIBAN REGIME.  GREECE HAS BLOCKED SUSPECT 
ACCOUNTS CONSISTENT WITH EU REGULATIONS.  ALSO CONSISTENT 
WITH EU REGULATIONS AND THE EU CLEARINGHOUSE PROCESS, GREECE 
IS BLOCKING ACCOUNTS BELONGING TO INDIGENOUS EUROPEAN 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  THE GOG HAS SEIZED ASSETS BELONGING 
TO 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (17N) SUSPECTS. 
 
3.  CONCERNING GREEK EFFORTS TO ENACT NEW COUNTERTERRORISM 
LAWS, THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER THAT THE 
GOG WILL SUBMIT NEW CT LEGISLATION IN AN EFFORT TO COMPLY 
WITH THE JUNE 13, 2002 EUROPEAN COUNCIL FRAMEWORK DECISION ON 
COMBATING TERRORISM.  THE LEGISLATION WILL CONTAIN MANDATORY 
MINIMUM SENTENCES OF FIFTEEN YEARS FOR PERSONS FOUND TO HAVE 
HELD LEADERSHIP ROLES IN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS AND EIGHT 
YEARS FOR THOSE WHO MATERIALLY ASSIST TERRORISTS.  THE 
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WOULD BE EXTENDED TO THIRTY YEARS, A 
PROVISION LIKELY INCLUDED OWING TO UNHAPPINESS THAT THE 
PROSECUTION OF A NUMBER OF 17N CRIMES IS TIME-BARRED AFTER 20 
YEARS.  THE COUNCIL DECISION SPECIFIES THAT GREECE PASS THE 
LEGISLATION BY DECEMBER 31, 2002. 
 
B: 
4.  FOR ALMOST 27 YEARS SINCE THE 17 NOVEMBER TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION\'S FIRST ACT, THE DECEMBER 23, 1975 MURDER OF 
AMERICAN EMBASSY OFFICER RICHARD WELCH, GREEK AUTHORITIES HAD 
BEEN UNABLE TO PENETRATE THIS TERRORIST GROUP.  17N, NAMED 
AFTER THE DATE IN 1973 WHEN THE GREEK JUNTA CRUSHED A STUDENT 
UPRISING, FOLLOWED WELCH\'S MURDER WITH TWENTY-TWO OTHERS, 
COUNTING FOUR OTHER U.S. EMBASSY EMPLOYEES AMONG ITS VICTIMS. 
 THE ORGANIZATION WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR A MULTITUDE OF 
OTHER CRIMES INCLUDING ATTEMPTED MURDER, ARMED ROBBERY, 
ROCKET ATTACKS, AND PROPERTY THEFT AND DESTRUCTION.  THE 
GROUP\'S AURA OF INVINCIBILITY GREW WITH THE GOG\'S INABILITY 
TO MAKE ARRESTS, AND IT CAME TO BE REGARDED AS ONE OF WESTERN 
EUROPE\'S DEADLIEST TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
5.  THINGS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN 2002 (REF B).  ON JUNE 29, 
A 17N MEMBER NAMED SAVVAS XYROS WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED WHEN A 
BOMB HE WAS CARRYING EXPLODED PREMATURELY IN THE PORT OF 
PIRAEUS.  INFORMATION HE PROVIDED WHILE IN CUSTODY AND SOLID 
GREEK POLICE WORK QUICKLY LED TO THE ARRESTS OF OTHER 
SUSPECTS AND THE DISCOVERY OF TWO SAFEHOUSES CONTAINING LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  EIGHTEEN SUSPECTED 17N 
TERRORISTS ARE CURRENTLY BEHIND BARS, AND THE 17N TRIAL IS 
EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN EARLY MARCH.  ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT 
THE GOG IS DOING ITS UTMOST TO ENSURE A FAIR AND SUCCESSFUL 
PROSECUTION, BUT THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE TRIAL (AT LEAST 18 
DEFENDANTS AND HUNDREDS OF CHARGES WILL BE TRIED IN ONE 
PROCEEDING) POSE DAUNTING CHALLENGES.  TO PROTECT THE 
INTERESTS OF EMBASSY VICTIMS OF 17N AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE 
USG HAS HIRED A GREEK ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT THEM. 
 
6.  (NOTE: UNDER GREEK LAW, VICTIMS OF CRIME AND/OR THEIR 
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO BE REPRESENTED BY LEGAL COUNSEL 
DURING A PROSECUTION.  ADVANTAGES OF SUCH LEGAL 
REPRESENTATION FOR THE VICTIM ARE THAT THE ATTORNEY CAN 
PARTICIPATE IN THE LEGAL PROCESS, AND HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE 
EVIDENCE AND CASE MATERIAL; THAT THE ATTORNEY CAN PROVIDE 
COUNSEL TO VICTIMS CALLED TO TESTIFY; AND THAT AN ATTORNEY IS 
NECESSARY TO INITIATE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION AND/OR 
CRIMINAL CHARGES AND/OR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION AGAINST THE 
DEFENDANTS ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS.  END NOTE.) 
 
7.  THE USG HAS EXPRESSED ITS FULL SUPPORT OF THE GOG\'S 
HANDLING OF THE 17N CASE, WITH PRESIDENT BUSH WRITING PM 
SIMITIS TO CONGRATULATE HIM.  ADDITIONALLY, MINISTER OF 
PUBLIC ORDER CHRYSOCHOIDES, THE GREEK OFFICIAL MOST 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOG\'S RECENT SUCCESS, RECEIVED 
ENCOURAGEMENT FROM CIA DIRECTOR TENET, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF 
STATE ARMITAGE, AND DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY GOV. RIDGE 
DURING AN OCTOBER TRIP TO WASHINGTON, D.C. 
 
8.  WHILE THE BREAKTHROUGH ON 17N HAS DOMINATED GOG 
COUNTER-TERRORISM DEVELOPMENTS IN 2002, GREEK POLICE SAY THEY 
HAVE BEGUN TO TARGET MORE AGGRESSIVELY OTHER DOMESTIC 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE NOW-DORMANT \"ELA\" 
(REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S STRUGGLE), CONSIDERED THE GRANDFATHER 
OF GREEK DOMESTIC TERROR GROUPS; \"REVOLUTIONARY NUCLEI;\" 
\"ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE;\" AND \"1 MAY.\" 
 
9.  FOLLOWING A SERIES OF LEGAL SETBACKS IN 2001 FOR GOG 
ATTEMPTS TO JAIL ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE TERRORIST AND LONGTIME 
CRIMINAL FUGITIVE AVRAAM LESPEROGLOU (WHOSE ATTEMPTED MURDER 
CONVICTION OF 2001 WAS OVERTURNED ON APPEAL, WHILE CHARGES 
REGARDING HIS ASSOCIATION WITH ANTI-STATE STRUGGLE WERE 
DROPPED WHEN PROSECUTION WITNESSES FAILED TO APPEAR OR 
RECANTED TESTIMONY), THE GOG TRIED AGAIN IN 2002 (REF C). 
THE GREEK SUPREME COURT VACATED THE OVERTURNING OF 
LESPEROGLOU\'S ATTEMPTED MURDER CONVICTION, AND HE FOUND 
HIMSELF BACK IN COURT ON THAT COUNT IN SEPTEMBER.  AFTER A 
SHORT TRIAL, DURING WHICH LESPEROGLOU RAILED AGAINST THE U.S. 
(HE OPENED WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: \"I AM HERE, ALTHOUGH 
ACQUITTED, FOLLOWING PRESSURE BY THE AMERICANS AND THEIR 
LOCAL VASSALS WHO WANT MY CONVICTION...\"), HE WAS AGAIN 
ACQUITTED. 
 
10.  A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LESPEROGLOU TRIAL 
AND THE UPCOMING 17N TRIAL IS THAT LESPEROGLOU WAS TRIED 
UNDER THE CONVENTIONAL GREEK FELONY TRIAL SYSTEM THAT USES 
THREE PROFESSIONAL JUDGES AND FOUR LAY ASSESSORS (JURORS) TO 
ARRIVE AT A SIMPLE-MAJORITY VERDICT.  THAT SYSTEM HAS 
RESULTED IN CONSISTENT 4-3 ACQUITTALS OF TERRORIST-RELATED 
SUSPECTS (POSSIBLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO WITNESS INTIMIDATION), AND 
WAS A MAJOR IMPETUS BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE 
COUNTER-TERRORISM LAW PASSED IN 2001.  THE 2001 LAW, WHICH 
WILL BE APPLIED IN THE 17N CASE, ELIMINATES THE FOUR LAY 
JURORS FROM THE PROCESS, AND 17N VERDICTS WILL THEREFORE BE 
DECIDED UPON BY THREE JUDGES ONLY, MAKING THEM MORE LIKELY TO 
BE BASED SOLELY ON THE MERITS OF THE CASE. 
 
C: 
11.  THE GOG DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF 
ANY SUSPECTED TERRORISTS DURING 2002, NOR DID THE USG SUBMIT 
ANY SUCH REQUEST. 
 
D: 
12.  UNDER ARTICLE 438 OF THE GREEK CODE OF CRIMINAL 
PROCEEDINGS, EXTRADITION IS PROHIBITED IF A) THE REQUESTED 
INDIVIDUAL WAS A GREEK NATIONAL WHEN THE OFFENSE WAS 
COMMITTED; B) THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE EXTRADITION HAS BEEN 
REQUESTED IS CONSIDERED BY GREEK LAW TO BE A POLITICAL 
OFFENSE, OR IF IT APPEARS FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE 
EXTRADITION IS BEING REQUESTED FOR POLITICAL REASONS; OR C) 
IF IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE PERSON REQUESTED WILL BE 
PROSECUTED BY THE REQUESTING STATE FOR AN OFFENSE OTHER THAN 
THE ONE FOR WHICH THE REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED.  AT THE 
SAME TIME, ARTICLE 8 OF THE U.S.-GREECE EXTRADITION TREATY 
STATES: \"UNDER THE STIPULATIONS OF THIS TREATY, NEITHER OF 
THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES SHALL BE BOUND TO DELIVER UP ITS 
OWN CITIZENS, EXCEPT IN SUCH CASES WHERE SUCH CITIZENSHIP HAS 
BEEN OBTAINED AFTER THE PERPETRATION OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH 
EXTRADITION IS SOUGHT.  THE STATE APPEALED TO SHALL DECIDE 
WHETHER THE PERSON CLAIMED IS ITS OWN CITIZEN.\" 
 
E: 
13.  FROM PRIME MINISTER SIMITIS DOWN, THE GOG HAS SHOWN A 
STRONG PUBLIC DETERMINATION TO ERADICATE DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
THE DECISION BY SOME 17N ARRESTEES TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR 
CRIMES AS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED HAS CATALYZED A MORE VIGOROUS 
PUBLIC ANTI-TERRORISM STANCE BY THE GOG.  A NOTABLE EXAMPLE 
OF THE NEWFOUND VIGOR WITH WHICH THE GOG HAS CONDEMNED 
TERRORISM IS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER USED THE OCCASION OF THE 
ANNUAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY SPEECH, ALWAYS ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT OF THE YEAR, TO ACCUSE DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS 
(AND 17N IN PARTICULAR) OF \"HIJACKING\" THE LEFT\'S IDEOLOGY 
AND DISTORTING SOCIALISM. 
 
F: 
14.  ON THE OLYMPICS, GREECE CONTINUES TO SEEK ASSISTANCE AND 
COUNSEL FROM THE OLYMPIC SECURITY ADVISORY GROUP (OSAG).  IN 
THAT CONTEXT, EXPERTS FROM THE U.S., UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, 
GERMANY, ISRAEL, AUSTRALIA, AND SPAIN ARE CONTINUOUSLY 
ADVISING AND TRAINING GREEK SECURITY PERSONNEL.  THE 
PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF U.S. TRAINING HAS BEEN THE DEPARTMENT\'S 
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY SERVICE\'S ANTI-TERRORISM ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAM. 
 
15.  GREECE (POPULATION APPROXIMATELY 11 MILLION) IS THE 
SECOND SMALLEST COUNTRY EVER TO HOST A MODERN SUMMER OLYMPICS 
(FINLAND IN 1952 WAS THE SMALLEST).  BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11, 
2001, THE GOG HAD ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS GOING TO SPEND USD 
600 MILLION ON OLYMPIC SECURITY.  THE LATEST FIGURE HAS RISEN 
TO USD ONE BILLION.  THROUGH THE OLYMPIC GAMES SECURITY 
DIRECTORATE (OGSD), THE INTER-MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY 
THE HELLENIC NATIONAL POLICE, OLYMPIC SECURITY PLANNING AND 
OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING IS GOING ON DAILY.  SUCH 
EFFORTS INVOLVE POLICE, MILITARY, COAST GUARD, AND 
VOLUNTEERS.  IN ALL, GREECE IS EXPECTING TO UTILIZE WELL OVER 
40,000 PEOPLE TO PERFORM OLYMPIC SECURITY DUTIES. 
 
G: 
16.  THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLES LIBERATION FRONT (DHKPC), A 
STATE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, 
ANNOUNCED DURING A 1995 PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE ATHENS BAR 
ASSOCIATION THAT IT WAS SETTING UP AN ATHENS OFFICE.  AT 
LEAST TWO ATHENS ADDRESSES HAVE SINCE BEEN PUBLICLY 
IDENTIFIED AS DHKPC OFFICES, AND THE DHKPC WEBSITE CLAIMS 
\"OUR PRESENCE IN GREECE IS QUITE OPEN AND DEMOCRATIC FOR 
EVERYONE TO SEE.\" 
 
H: 
17.  THE GOG DID NOT MAKE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
I: 
18.  THE RECENT SUCCESS IN CRACKING 17N HAS HAD A VERY 
POSITIVE EFFECT ON BOTH THE GOG\'S AND THE GREEK PUBLIC\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM, AS WHAT WAS ONCE A POLITICAL 
LIABILITY IS NOW SEEN AS A PLUS.  THE SITUATION SURROUNDING 
THE PASSAGE (ON JUNE 12, 2001) OF MILESTONE COUNTERTERRORISM 
LEGISLATION PROVIDES AN ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THE SUBJECT WAS 
VIEWED BY THE GOG.  THAT BILL WENT THROUGH IN THE DEAD OF 
NIGHT, ON ITS THIRD AND FINAL READING, AND WITH ONLY 15 OF 
300 MPS (AND ONLY FIVE PASOK MPS) PRESENT.  NOW, FLUSH WITH A 
VICTORY OVER 17N, WE ARE SEEING EVIDENCE THAT THE GOG IS 
GETTING OUT IN FRONT ON TERRORISM, WITH MINISTER OF JUSTICE 
PETSALNIKOS ANNOUNCING NEW ANTI-TERRORISM LEGISLATION ON THE 
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11 (SEE ABOVE, SECTION (A)). 
 
J: 
19.  THE GOG\'S EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS IS DISCUSSED IN SECTION (A), 
PARAGRAPH (2).  OTHER U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND 
INITIATIVES WITH THE GOG IN 2002 INCLUDE THE FBI\'S PROVISION, 
AT THE GOG\'S REQUEST AND TO AUGMENT GOG EFFORTS, OF FORENSIC 
EXPERTISE IN FINGERPRINT AND DNA ANALYSIS, DIGITAL MEDIA 
(COMPUTER) EXPLOITATION, AND EVIDENCE RECOVERY. 
 
K: 
20.  THE GOG HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE IN ASSISTING USG 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO ACTS OF TRANSNATIONAL TERRORISM (E.G. WTC 
DISASTER AND EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN NAIROBI AND DAR ES SALAAM). 
AFTER 9/11 THE GOG ASSISTED THE U.S. IN OBTAINING RECORDS 
(FLIGHT MANIFESTS, HOTEL INFORMATION) PERTAINING TO TWO OF 
THE SEPTEMBER 11 HIJACKERS WHO HAD TRANSITED GREECE. 
 
L: 
21.  THE USG DID NOT SEEK GREEK COOPERATION IN 2002 FOR THE 
PREVENTION OF A SPECIFIC ACT OF TERRORISM AGAINST U.S. 
CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  POLICE COOPERATION WAS ALWAYS 
EXCELLENT WHEN THE EMBASSY WAS THE TARGET OF GENERAL THREATS 
OR DEMONSTRATIONS.

SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE AND THREAT ASSESSMENT 
FOR GERALD GUALA 
 
REF:  PER FAX DTD 12/21 
 
1.  Embassy warmly welcomes and grants country clearance for 
the visit of Mr. Gerald Guala, Botanist, Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, to attend the global biodiversity information 
facility workshop in Chania from January 19 through 22, 2005 
 
2.  Per reftel no Embassy assistance requested. 
 
3.  Pursuant to State 66580 dated March 25, 2004, country 
clearance for any person on TDY for 30 days or more is 
granted contingent on completion of the mandatory personal 
security training.  The Department of State\'s Foreign 
Service Institute (FSI) conducts the approved minimum four- 
day training class, \"Serving Abroad for Families & Employees 
(S.A.F.E.).\"  This is the same course required for employees 
and highly recommended for their eligible family members 
over the age of 18. 
 
4.  It is important that all visitors carefully read the 
information and instructions provided below.  Post wants to 
ensure the best possible service to all official visitors 
and will work closely to arrange details of each visit. 
 
5.  Early morning check-in:  For those coming from 
Washington, D.C., often on the early morning Delta flight 
arriving at 1005, please note there is no guarantee of early 
check-in at the hotel.  Normal check-in time is 1400. 
Although post can request early check-in for travelers, the 
only way to guarantee a room waiting is to reserve it for 
the preceding night.  Travelers who wish to book the 
previous night must request post to make this reservation. 
The traveler is responsible for this expense.  Travelers 
should be prepared to go from the airport directly to the 
office/meetings if they have not paid for a room the night 
before.  The Embassy has a cafeteria that serves breakfast 
and lunch. 
 
6.  Arrivals:  We expect to be able to provide 
transportation for official visitors at the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary level and above upon arrival at the airport. 
 
SIPDIS 
Other visitors should plan to use taxis.  The price of a 
taxi from Athens airport to downtown is approximately 28 - 
30 euros.  Depending on traffic, the trip to the Embassy 
takes 40 to 60 minutes. 
 
7.  Documents required:  Diplomatic and official passport 
holders must have Greek diplomatic visas, a valid Schengen 
visa or diplomatic ID from any other Schengen country, in 
addition to their passport, in order to enter Greece.  The 
Embassy will be unable to obtain plane-side visas for USG 
employees arriving in Greece without proper documentation. 
Holders of tourist passports do not/not require visas.  USG 
employees who plan to operate a motor vehicle while in 
Greece must be in possession of a valid U.S. drivers\' 
license as well as a valid International Drivers\' License 
and must carry proof of third party liability insurance 
while operating the vehicle. 
 
8.  Embassy access:  Embassy Athens has installed a new 
identification badging system, which requires that all 
Department of State employees bring their Global ID and/or 
Smart Card that will be acknowledged as proper Embassy ID. 
DOS employees will be expected to stop by the RSO Office to 
program their ID to be compatible with the Athens system. 
 
9.  Regional Medical Office:  The Health Unit at the Embassy 
is fully staffed.  A State Department medical clearance is 
required by all employees of agencies participating in ICASS 
who will be traveling TDY for more then 60 days a year. 
Health Unit access is not guaranteed without this clearance. 
Family members will not have access to the Health Unit 
unless they are on employees\' travel orders.  We strongly 
recommend that TDYers bring with them proof of current 
medical insurance coverage and medevac coverage if obtained. 
 
10.  Currency:  Greece is a member of the European Monetary 
Union, and the Euro is the currency of the country. 
Accommodation exchange is available on a limited basis 
(responsible agency/section signed authorization) at the 
Embassy cashier office - hours are M-F 0900 - 1100 and 1400 
- 1600.  However, ATMs are readily available throughout the 
country (there is also one at the Embassy); they will accept 
U.S. debit cards.  In addition, most banks and major hotels 
provide accommodation exchange services.  Post is unable to 
provide reverse accommodation. 
 
11.  Office space/laptops/mobile phones:  Office space in 
both classified and unclassified areas is extremely limited. 
For those employees planning on bringing laptops and modems 
to use in their hotels, please remember that this equipment 
can be used for processing unclassified (non-SBU) 
information only.  Current here is 220 volt, 50 cycles, and 
outlets are two-pronged.  Bring along a plug adapter and 
equipment that can handle the voltage.  Laptops are not 
permitted in controlled access areas of the Embassy. 
European GSM mobile phones function normally in Greece. 
12.  Presidential Directive - Trafficking in Persons:  All 
TDY personnel are reminded that President Bush has signed a 
National Security Presidential Directive to advance the 
fight against trafficking in persons.  The United States is 
committed to eradicate trafficking both domestically and 
abroad. Trafficking in persons exists in Greece.  A 
significant number of the people involved in prostitution, 
pornography and the sex tourism phenomenon, are trafficked. 
They are compelled by force, fraud and coercion to submit to 
sexual exploitation.  TDY personnel are advised that any 
involvement with the commercial sex industry is unacceptable 
in light of the diplomatic and foreign policy goals of the 
United States and the ethical standards of the Department of 
State and this Mission. Embassy Management will not tolerate 
any such involvement by Mission personnel and, in this 
regard, will enforce all relevant regulations regarding 
conduct and suitability of U.S. Government employees 
stationed abroad. 
 
13.  Security information: 
 
A.  Embassy Athens is designated \"critical\" for indigenous 
terrorism.  In the past, local Greek terrorist groups have 
targeted prominent Greeks as well as certain non-Greek 
Officials, including Americans.  We believe that the threat 
to official US Government personnel on short-term 
assignments to Greece or visiting for tourism is relatively 
low.  The indigenous groups historically have engaged in 
extensive operational surveillance over long periods of 
time.  In 2003 and again in 2004, the Greek Government made 
significant progress to combat domestic terrorism by 
successfully convicting the leader and key hit men of the 
November 17 terrorist organization and of the ELA.  17N was 
responsible for assassinating prominent Greeks and five 
members of the US Mission over the course of its 30-year 
history.  Convicted ELA members were responsible for several 
bombings, attempted murders and were involved in at least 
one assassination.  While these convictions likely impacted 
on the operational capabilities of 17N and ELA, it is too 
soon to assess whether the threat from domestic terrorism is 
completely eliminated.  We urge vigilance and caution, as 
the worldwide threat from other terrorist groups against 
Americans in general remains high.  Official Americans 
should assume they are potential targets. 
 
B.  Over the past year the U.S. Embassy has experienced 
numerous bomb threats, protest marches, and anti-U.S. 
demonstrations.  These protests are generally peaceful 
though a few provoked random acts of violence.  Travelers to 
Greece are advised that protests or demonstrations could 
occur at any time; unwitting observers or bystanders might 
be identified, to their disadvantage, as Americans.  RSO 
recommends that official U.S. travelers in Greece remain 
alert when moving about in public places and avoid certain 
places where demonstrators frequently congregate.  These 
places include the Polytechnical University area, located on 
28 October (Patission) Street between the National 
Archeological Museum and Omonia Square; Exarchion Square, 
located near Kolonaki; Omonia and Syntagma Squares, which 
are often used as launch sites for large demonstrations; and 
Mavili Square, located near the U.S. Embassy.  Visitors 
should keep abreast of news about large demonstrations and 
avoid these areas and metro stops. 
 
C.  Crime is rated \"medium\" in Greece.  For TDY visitors, 
pick-pocketing and purse snatching are the most common 
crimes.  Taxis are generally safe though metered cabs are 
recommended.  Taxis too will often pick up more than one 
passenger unless prior arrangements are made.  Crimes of 
opportunity - thefts, break-ins, and occasional scams - are 
on the rise.  Travelers should be especially cautious with 
wallets, purses, and parcels when traveling on crowded 
streets, public buses, trolleys, and/or subways.  There have 
been several instances of motorcyclists approaching cars 
stuck in traffic, reaching through open windows or smashing 
closed ones, and stealing whatever is within reach.  We have 
also recently learned of a new scenario in which 
motorcyclists open the trunk of a vehicle and remove the 
contents.  The Embassy recommends keeping purses, parcels, 
handbags, etc. out of sight under the seat or on the floor 
of the car.  Windows should be kept closed and doors locked. 
Pedestrians may also be confronted by beggars and other 
street people who may attempt to divert attention, then 
steal unprotected valuables - either by pick-pocketing or 
snatch-and-grab techniques.  Women are generally safe from 
violent crime in Greece.  Men are aggressive by American 
standards however when pursuing women. 
 
D.  Traffic in Greek urban areas, especially Athens and 
Thessaloniki, is chaotic.  Greece leads the European Union 
in traffic fatalities.  Road rage is common.  Accidents 
often lead to fist fights.  Drivers in Greece should 
exercise caution and common sense.  Drivers and pedestrians 
alike should exercise extreme caution when operating motor 
vehicles or when walking along roadways.  Moreover, tourists 
who rent motorbikes either on the Greek mainland or its 
islands must wear helmets and must take special precautions 
on the local roads that are typically poorly maintained and 
frequently pothole-ridden.  Greece also leads the European 
Union in motorcycle deaths.

The MFA has decided to coordinate relief efforts with the EC\'s Humanitarian Office and relevant UN agencies. End Summary. 
 
2.  Econcouns delivered general points per ref b to Dimitris Platis, Chief Aide to Deputy Foreign Minister Stylianidis (in charge of foreign assistance).  Platis commended, in particular, U.S. efforts to engage Middle East countries in the relief effort.  He said that the MFA has decided to coordinate official assistance and relief efforts with the European Commission\'s Humanitarian Office as well as UN agencies, as appropriate.  Greece plans to participate in the January 11 Donor Conference in Geneva.  Either Foreign Minister Moliviatis or Deputy Foreign Minister Valinakis will probably attend. 
 
3.  According to Platis, the GoG has contributed about one million euros worth of emergency aid, services and cash to disaster stricken areas.  Two Hellenic Air Force C-130 \"Hercules\" transport planes have delivered physicians, rescue personnel and 12 tons of humanitarian aid to the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Thailand (ref a).  The GoG is considering dispatching a third C-130 with humanitarian and medical aid in the near future. Twenty five members of the Greek Emergency Rescue Service (EMAK) have returned from Thailand, where they left behind trailers and specialized rescue equipment. 
 
4.  GoG financial assistance to the Maldives and Sri Lanka (300,000 euros) has already been disbursed.  The MFA is now coordinating with the leading Greek NGOs in soliciting private donations.  The MFA is sponsoring a television marathon and has collected nearly a million euros so far.  In addition, Greek companies and private individuals pledged one million euros to Deputy Foreign Minister Stilianidis on January 3.  According to media reports, the Church of Greece has collected about 100,000 euros, and private donations to UNICEF are coming in at the rate of 40-50,000 euros a day, totaling approximately 300,000 euros this week.  The MFA is urging Greeks to make their donations in cash rather than kind in order to more effectively coordinate assistance with the EC and UN relief agencies.

1.  Embassy warmly welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of DOE funded personnel: Eleanor Melamed, Janet Steele Ahrens, Kenneth Baird, Stephanie Payne Clarke, Timothy Allen Gregoire, Cody John Hostick, Jennifer Ann Jacobs, William Stewart Johnson, Marion Jane McDonald, Robert David Price, Randal James Roberts, Scott M. Verillion, Richard Kern Vessels, II, Robbie Lynn York, William Chester Cliff (alternate), Christine Anne Frei (alternate), Richard David Mackoy (alternate), to travel to Greece from January 16 to February 5, 2005.  The team will install communications equipment, perform acceptance testing, and perform on-site training of Customs officials at locations in Greece. In-Country Point of Contact is Cathleen Carothers, Economic Officer, Tel. (30) 210- 720-2309, cell (30) 6948575525, FAX (30) 210-729-4312. 
 
2.  Per reftel hotel reservations have been made at the Hilton Hotel Athens, 46 Vas. Sophias Avenue, 115 28 Athens, Tel. (30) 210-7281000, FAX  (30) 210-7281111, group confirmation number EMBA230105.  Travelers are expected to pay their own hotel bills prior to departing.  If the room reserved is not to be used, the reservation must be canceled twenty-four hours prior to your reservation date. Otherwise, the traveler is responsible for the cost of the unused room. 
 
3.  Pursuant to State 66580 dated March 25, 2004, country clearance for any person on TDY for 30 days or more is granted contingent on completion of the mandatory personal security training.  The Department of State\'s Foreign Service Institute (FSI) conducts the approved minimum four- day training class, \"Serving Abroad for Families & Employees (S.A.F.E.).\"  This is the same course required for employees and highly recommended for their eligible family members over the age of 18. 
 
4.  It is important that all visitors carefully read the information and instructions provided below.  Post wants to ensure the best possible service to all official visitors and will work closely to arrange details of each visit. 
 
5.  Early morning check-in:  For those coming from Washington, D.C., often on the early morning Delta flight arriving at 1005, please note there is no guarantee of early check-in at the hotel.  Normal check-in time is 1400. Although post can request early check-in for travelers, the only way to guarantee a room waiting is to reserve it for the preceding night.  Travelers who wish to book the previous night must request post to make this reservation. The traveler is responsible for this expense.  Travelers should be prepared to go from the airport directly to the office/meetings if they have not paid for a room the night before.  The Embassy has a cafeteria that serves breakfast and lunch. 
 
6.  Arrivals:  We expect to be able to provide transportation for official visitors at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level and above upon arrival at the airport.  Other visitors should plan to use taxis.  The price of a taxi from Athens airport to downtown is approximately 28 - 30 euros.  Depending on traffic, the trip to the Embassy takes 40 to 60 minutes. 
 
7.  Documents required:  Diplomatic and official passport holders must have Greek diplomatic visas, a valid Schengen visa or diplomatic ID from any other Schengen country, in addition to their passport, in order to enter Greece.  The Embassy will be unable to obtain plane-side visas for USG employees arriving in Greece without proper documentation. Holders of tourist passports do not/not require visas.  USG employees who plan to operate a motor vehicle while in Greece must be in possession of a valid U.S. drivers\' license as well as a valid International Drivers\' License and must carry proof of third party liability insurance while operating the vehicle. 
 8.  Embassy access:  Embassy Athens has installed a new identification badging system, which requires that all Department of State employees bring their Global ID and/or Smart Card that will be acknowledged as proper Embassy ID. DOS employees will be expected to stop by the RSO Office to program their ID to be compatible with the Athens system. 
 
9.  Regional Medical Office:  The Health Unit at the Embassy is fully staffed.  A State Department medical clearance is required by all employees of agencies participating in ICASS who will be traveling TDY for more then 60 days a year.  Health Unit access is not guaranteed without this clearance.  Family members will not have access to the Health Unit unless they are on employees\' travel orders.  We strongly recommend that TDYers bring with them proof of current medical insurance coverage and medevac coverage if obtained. 
 
10.  Currency:  Greece is a member of the European Monetary Union, and the Euro is the currency of the country. Accommodation exchange is available on a limited basis (responsible agency/section signed authorization) at the Embassy cashier office  hours are M-F 0900  1100 and 1400  1600.  However, ATMs are readily available throughout the country (there is also one at the Embassy); they will accept U.S. debit cards.  In addition, most banks and major hotels provide accommodation exchange services.  Post is unable to provide reverse accommodation. 
 
11.  Office space/laptops/mobile phones:  Office space in both classified and unclassified areas is extremely limited.  For those employees planning on bringing laptops and modems to use in their hotels, please remember that this equipment can be used for processing unclassified (non-SBU) information only.  Current here is 220 volt, 50 cycles, and outlets are two-pronged.  Bring along a plug adapter and equipment that can handle the voltage.  Laptops are not permitted in controlled access areas of the Embassy.  European GSM mobile phones function normally in Greece. 
 
12.  Presidential Directive - Trafficking in Persons:  All TDY personnel are reminded that President Bush has signed a National Security Presidential Directive to advance the fight against trafficking in persons.  The United States is committed to eradicate trafficking both domestically and abroad. Trafficking in persons exists in Greece.  A significant number of the people involved in prostitution, pornography and the sex tourism phenomenon, are trafficked. They are compelled by force, fraud and coercion to submit to sexual exploitation.  TDY personnel are advised that any involvement with the commercial sex industry is unacceptable in light of the diplomatic and foreign policy goals of the United States and the ethical standards of the Department of State and this Mission. Embassy Management will not tolerate any such involvement by Mission personnel and, in this regard, will enforce all relevant regulations regarding conduct and suitability of U.S. Government employees stationed abroad. 
 
13.  Security information: 
 
A.  Embassy Athens is designated \"critical\" for indigenous terrorism.  In the past, local Greek terrorist groups have targeted prominent Greeks as well as certain non-Greek Officials, including Americans.  We believe that the threat to official US Government personnel on short-term assignments to Greece or visiting for tourism is relatively low.  The indigenous groups historically have engaged in extensive operational surveillance over long periods of time.  In 2003 and again in 2004, the Greek Government made significant progress to combat domestic terrorism by successfully convicting the leader and key hit men of the November 17 terrorist organization and of the ELA.  17N was responsible for assassinating prominent Greeks and five members of the US Mission over the course of its 30-year history.  Convicted ELA members were responsible for several bombings, attempted murders and were involved in at least one assassination.  While these convictions likely impacted on the operational capabilities of 17N and ELA, it is too soon to assess whether the threat from domestic terrorism is completely eliminated.  We urge vigilance and caution, as the worldwide threat from other terrorist groups against Americans in general remains high.  Official Americans should assume they are potential targets. 
 
B.  Over the past year the U.S. Embassy has experienced numerous bomb threats, protest marches, and anti-U.S. demonstrations.  These protests are generally peaceful though a few provoked random acts of violence.  Travelers to Greece are advised that protests or demonstrations could occur at any time; unwitting observers or bystanders might be identified, to their disadvantage, as Americans.  RSO recommends that official U.S. travelers in Greece remain alert when moving about in public places and avoid certain places where demonstrators frequently congregate.  These places include the Polytechnical University area, located on 28 October (Patission) Street between the National Archeological Museum and Omonia Square; Exarchion Square, located near Kolonaki; Omonia and Syntagma Squares, which are often used as launch sites for large demonstrations; and Mavili Square, located near the U.S. Embassy.  Visitors should keep abreast of news about large demonstrations and avoid these areas and metro stops. 
 
C.  Crime is rated \"medium\" in Greece.  For TDY visitors, pick-pocketing and purse snatching are the most common crimes.  Taxis are generally safe though metered cabs are recommended.  Taxis too will often pick up more than one passenger unless prior arrangements are made.  Crimes of opportunity thefts, break-ins, and occasional scams  are on the rise.  Travelers should be especially cautious with wallets, purses, and parcels when traveling on crowded streets, public buses, trolleys, and/or subways.  There have been several instances of motorcyclists approaching cars stuck in traffic, reaching through open windows or smashing closed ones, and stealing whatever is within reach.  We have also recently learned of a new scenario in which motorcyclists open the trunk of a vehicle and remove the contents.  The Embassy recommends keeping purses, parcels, handbags, etc. out of sight under the seat or on the floor of the car.  Windows should be kept closed and doors locked.  Pedestrians may also be confronted by beggars and other street people who may attempt to divert attention, then steal unprotected valuables Either by pick-pocketing or snatch-and-grab techniques.  Women are generally safe from violent crime in Greece.  Men are aggressive by American standards however when pursuing women. 
 
 
D.  Traffic in Greek urban areas, especially Athens and Thessaloniki, is chaotic.  Greece leads the European Union in traffic fatalities.  Road rage is common.  Accidents often lead to fist fights.  Drivers in Greece should exercise caution and common sense.  Drivers and pedestrians alike should exercise extreme caution when operating motor vehicles or when walking along roadways.  Moreover, tourists who rent motorbikes either on the Greek mainland or its islands must wear helmets and must take special precautions on the local roads that are typically poorly maintained and frequently pothole-ridden.  Greece also leads the European Union in motorcycle deaths.

These places include the Polytechnical University area, located on 28 October (Patission) Street between the National Archeological Museum and Omonia Square; Exarchion Square, located near Kolonaki; Omonia and Syntagma Squares, which are often used as launch sites for large demonstrations; and Mavili Square, located near the U.S. Embassy.  Visitors should keep abreast of news about large demonstrations and avoid these areas and metro stops. 
 
C.  Crime is rated \"medium\" in Greece.  For TDY visitors, pick-pocketing and purse snatching are the most common crimes.  Taxis are generally safe though metered cabs are recommended.  Taxis too will often pick up more than one passenger unless prior arrangements are made.  Crimes of opportunity  thefts, break-ins, and occasional scams  are on the rise.  Travelers should be especially cautious with wallets, purses, and parcels when traveling on crowded streets, public buses, trolleys, and/or subways.  There have been several instances of motorcyclists approaching cars stuck in traffic, reaching through open windows or smashing closed ones, and stealing whatever is within reach.  We have also recently learned of a new scenario in which motorcyclists open the trunk of a vehicle and remove the contents.  The Embassy recommends keeping purses, parcels, handbags, etc. out of sight under the seat or on the floor of the car.  Windows should be kept closed and doors locked.  Pedestrians may also be confronted by beggars and other street people who may attempt to divert attention, then steal unprotected valuables either by pick-pocketing or snatch-and-grab techniques.  Women are generally safe from violent crime in Greece.  Men are aggressive by American standards however when pursuing women. 
 
D.  Traffic in Greek urban areas, especially Athens and Thessaloniki, is chaotic.  Greece leads the European Union in traffic fatalities.  Road rage is common.  Accidents often lead to fist fights.  Drivers in Greece should exercise caution and common sense.  Drivers and pedestrians alike should exercise extreme caution when operating motor vehicles or when walking along roadways.  Moreover, tourists who rent motorbikes either on the Greek mainland or its islands must wear helmets and must take special precautions on the local roads that are typically poorly maintained and frequently pothole-ridden.  Greece also leads the European Union in motorcycle deaths.

REF: A) STATE 01486; B) STATE 01483 
 
1.  Embassy warmly welcomes and grants country clearance for the visit of Allan Krass, NP/NE Physical Science Officer, Charles Edward Messick, Sr., Program Manager, DOE Savannah River Operations Office, James Dunavant and Michael Douglas Dunsmuir of Westinghouse Savannah River Company and Nicholas Lyle Jenkins of NAC International to Greece from January 17-20, 2005. The purpose of the team\'s visit is to discuss with GoG officials and technical experts a proposed shipment of spent research reactor containing US-origin high enriched uranium from the Demokritos Research Reactor. Point of Contact is Cathleen Carothers, Economic Officer, Tel. (30) 210-720-2309, cell (30) 6948575525, FAX (30) 210-729-4312. 
 
2.  Per reftel hotel reservations have been made at the Holiday Inn Hotel, 50 Michalakopoulou Street, 115 28 Athens, Tel. (30) 210-727-800, FAX (30) 724-8187. Travelers are expected to pay their own hotel bills prior to departing.  If the room reserved is not to be used, the reservation must be canceled twenty-four hours prior to your reservation date.  Otherwise, the traveler is responsible for the cost of the unused room. 
 
3.  Pursuant to State 66580 dated March 25, 2004, country clearance for any person on TDY for 30 days or more is granted contingent on completion of the mandatory personal security training.  The Department of State\'s Foreign Service Institute (FSI) conducts the approved minimum four- day training class, \"Serving Abroad for Families & Employees (S.A.F.E.).\"  This is the same course required for employees and highly recommended for their eligible family members over the age of 18. 
 
4.  It is important that all visitors carefully read the information and instructions provided below.  Post wants to ensure the best possible service to all official visitors and will work closely to arrange details of each visit. 
 
5.  Early morning check-in:  For those coming from Washington, D.C., often on the early morning Delta flight arriving at 1005, please note there is no guarantee of early check-in at the hotel.  Normal check-in time is 1400. Although post can request early check-in for travelers, the only way to guarantee a room waiting is to reserve it for the preceding night.  Travelers who wish to book the previous night must request post to make this reservation. The traveler is responsible for this expense.  Travelers should be prepared to go from the airport directly to the office/meetings if they have not paid for a room the night before.  The Embassy has a cafeteria that serves breakfast and lunch. 
 
6.  Arrivals:  We expect to be able to provide transportation for official visitors at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level and above upon arrival at the airport.  Other visitors should plan to use taxis.  The price of a taxi from Athens airport to downtown is approximately 28 - 30 euros.  Depending on traffic, the trip to the Embassy takes 40 to 60 minutes. 
 
7.  Documents required:  Diplomatic and official passport holders must have Greek diplomatic visas, a valid Schengen visa or diplomatic ID from any other Schengen country, in addition to their passport, in order to enter Greece.  The Embassy will be unable to obtain plane-side visas for USG employees arriving in Greece without proper documentation. Holders of tourist passports do not/not require visas.  USG employees who plan to operate a motor vehicle while in Greece must be in possession of a valid U.S. drivers\' license as well as a valid International Drivers\' License and must carry proof of third party liability insurance while operating the vehicle. 
 
8.  Embassy access:  Embassy Athens has installed a new identification badging system, which requires that all Department of State employees bring their Global ID and/or Smart Card that will be acknowledged as proper Embassy ID. DOS employees will be expected to stop by the RSO Office to program their ID to be compatible with the Athens system. 
 
9.  Regional Medical Office:  The Health Unit at the Embassy is fully staffed.  A State Department medical clearance is required by all employees of agencies participating in ICASS who will be traveling TDY for more then 60 days a year.  Health Unit access is not guaranteed without this clearance.  Family members will not have access to the Health Unit unless they are on employees\' travel orders.  We strongly recommend that TDYers bring with them proof of current medical insurance coverage and medevac coverage if obtained. 
 
10.  Currency:  Greece is a member of the European Monetary Union, and the Euro is the currency of the country. Accommodation exchange is available on a limited basis (responsible agency/section signed authorization) at the Embassy cashier office  hours are M-F 0900  1100 and 1400  1600.  However, ATMs are readily available throughout the country (there is also one at the Embassy); they will accept U.S. debit cards.  In addition, most banks and major hotels provide accommodation exchange services.  Post is unable to provide reverse accommodation. 
 
11.  Office space/laptops/mobile phones:  Office space in both classified and unclassified areas is extremely limited.  For those employees planning on bringing laptops and modems to use in their hotels, please remember that this equipment can be used for processing unclassified (non-SBU) information only.  Current here is 220 volt, 50 cycles, and outlets are two-pronged.  Bring along a plug adapter and equipment that can handle the voltage.  Laptops are not permitted in controlled access areas of the he Embassy.  European GSM mobile phones function normally in Greece. 
 
12.  Presidential Directive - Trafficking in Persons:  All TDY personnel are reminded that President Bush has signed a National Security Presidential Directive to advance the fight against trafficking in persons.  The United States is committed to eradicate trafficking both domestically and abroad. Trafficking in persons exists in Greece.  A significant number of the people involved in prostitution, pornography and the sex tourism phenomenon, are trafficked. They are compelled by force, fraud and coercion to submit to sexual exploitation.  TDY personnel are advised that any involvement with the commercial sex industry is unacceptable in light of the diplomatic and foreign policy goals of the United States and the ethical standards of the Department of State and this Mission. Embassy Management will not tolerate any such involvement by Mission personnel and, in this regard, will enforce all relevant regulations regarding conduct and suitability of U.S. Government employees stationed abroad. 
13.  Security information:A.  Embassy Athens is designated \"critical\" for indigenous terrorism.  In the past, local Greek terrorist groups have targeted prominent Greeks as well as certain non-Greek Officials, including Americans.  We believe that the threat to official US Government personnel on short-term assignments to Greece or visiting for tourism is relatively low.  The indigenous groups historically have engaged in extensive operational surveillance over long periods of time.  In 2003 and again in 2004, the Greek Government made significant progress to combat domestic terrorism by successfully convicting the leader and key hit men of the November 17 terrorist organization and of the ELA.  17N was responsible for assassinating prominent Greeks and five members of the US Mission over the course of its 30-year history.  Convicted ELA members were responsible for several bombings, attempted murders and were involved in at least one assassination.  While these convictions likely impacted on the operational capabilities of 17N and ELA, it is too soon to assess whether the threat from domestic terrorism is completely eliminated.  We urge vigilance and caution, as the worldwide threat from other terrorist groups against Americans in general remains high.  Official Americans should assume they are potential targets. 
 
B.  Over the past year the U.S. Embassy has experienced numerous bomb threats, protest marches, and anti-U.S. demonstrations.  These protests are generally peaceful though a few provoked random acts of violence.  Travelers to Greece are advised that protests or demonstrations could occur at any time; unwitting observers or bystanders might be identified, to their disadvantage, as Americans.  RSO recommends that official U.S. travelers in Greece remain alert when moving about in public places and avoid certain places where demonstrators frequently congregate.  These places include the Polytechnical University area, located on 28 October (Patission) Street between the National Archeological Museum and Omonia Square; Exarchion Square, located near Kolonaki; Omonia and Syntagma Squares, which are often used as launch sites for large demonstrations; and Mavili Square, located near the U.S. Embassy.  Visitors should keep abreast of news about large demonstrations and avoid these areas and metro stops. 
 
C.  Crime is rated \"medium\" in Greece.  For TDY visitors, pick-pocketing and purse snatching are the most common crimes.  Taxis are generally safe though metered cabs are recommended.  Taxis too will often pick up more than one passenger unless prior arrangements are made.  Crimes of opportunity  thefts, break-ins, and occasional scams  are on the rise.  Travelers should be especially cautious with wallets, purses, and parcels when traveling on crowded streets, public buses, trolleys, and/or subways.  There e have been several instances of motorcyclists approaching cars stuck in traffic, reaching through open windows or smashing closed ones, and stealing whatever is within reach.  We have also recently learned of a new scenario in which motorcyclists open the trunk of a vehicle and remove the contents.  The Embassy recommends keeping purses, parcels, handbags, etc. out of sight under the seat or on the floor of the car.  Windows should be kept closed and doors locked.  Pedestrians may also be confronted by beggars and other street people who may attempt to divert attention, then steal unprotected valuables  either by pick-pocketing or snatch-and-grab techniques.  Women are generally safe from violent crime in Greece.  Men are aggressive by American standards however when pursuing women.
