1.  (C) SUMMARY.  POST DELIVERS WHALE TALKING POINTS 
IN REFTEL TO GOJ OFFICIALS IN MOFA.  MOFA OFFICIALS 
QUESTION USG CALCULATION OF GOJ QUOTA UNDER \"PAST 
PRACTICES\" FORMULA.  GOJ HAS NOT MADE DECISION 
REGARDING ACTUAL NUMBER OF WHALES TO BE HARVESTED 
BY ANTARCTIC FLEET THIS SEASON, BUT GOJ AND USSR 
OFFICIALS HAVE EXCHANGED \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION\" 
NOT TO EXCEED LAST YEAR\'S HARVESTS.  TOTAL COASTAL 
SPERM WHALE CATCH AS OF JANUARY 7 IS 106 WHALES. 
END SUMMARY. 
- 
2.  (C) ON JANUARY 8, REGFISHATT MET WITH SUSUMU 
AKIYAMA AND KENRO IINO, DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
RESPECTIVELY OF THE FISHERY DIVISION OF THE ECONOMIC 
AFFAIRS BUREAU OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MOFA), 
AND DELIVERED A COPY OF THE FIVE TALKING POINTS 
GIVEN IN PARA 3 OF REFTEL.  BOTH INDICATED THE 
TALKING POINTS WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER WITHIN 
MOFA AND WITH OFFICIALS OF THE FISHERY AGENCY OF 
JAPAN (FAJ).  IINO NOTED IMMEDIATELY THAT FAJ 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CONSULTATIONS REGARDING THE WHALING ISSUE WITH USG 
OFFICIALS.  AKIYAMA STATED THAT \"NO DECISION HAS 
BEEN MADE\" IN GOJ REGARDING THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF 
WHALES TO BE HARVESTED IN THE ANTARCTIC BY THE 
JAPANESE FLEET THIS SEASON.  HE MENTIONED THREE 
FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING AN \"APPROPRIATE\" 
HARVEST AS FOLLOWS: 
- 
(A) THE MOST RECENT HARVEST LEVELS SET BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION (IWC) THAT HAD 
BEEN ACCEPTED BY GOJ (I.E., THE 1984 SEASON OVERALL 
QUOTA OF 3,027); 
- 
(B) CONSULTATIONS WITH CONCERNED COUNTRIES; AND 
- 
(C) THE FINDINGS OF THE IWC SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE 
AT THE 1984 IWC MEETING. 
- 
HE FURTHER MENTIONED HIS \"PERSONAL VIEW\" THAT THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OF THE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE THOSE 
WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT GOJ WOULD OFFICIALLY 
RESPOND LATER TO THE U.S. BELIEF THAT \"THERE IS NO 
NEED FOR CONSULTATIONS.\"  AKIYAMA ALSO POINTED OUT 
THAT JAPAN HAS NO INTENTION OF TAKING AN UNLIMITED 
NUMBER OF WHALES EVEN THOUGH THE FILING OF AN 
OBJECTION WITH THE IWC MEANS GOJ IS NOT BOUND TO 
ANY SPECIFIC QUOTA. 
- 
3.  (C) AKIYAMA SAID THAT GOJ AND THE SOVIET UNION 
HAVE EXCHANGED \"EXPRESSIONS OF INTENTION\" TO CONDUCT 
THIS SEASON\'S WHALING FOR MINKE WHALES IN THE 
ANTARCTIC IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE TOTAL CATCH WILL NOT 
EXCEED LAST SEASON\'S HARVEST LEVELS OF 3,027 WHALES 
FOR JAPAN AND 3,028 WHALES FOR THE SOVIET UNION. 
AKIYAMA NOTED THAT THE EXCHANGE OF INTENTIONS WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION CORRESPONDED TO THE ARRANGEMENT 
REACHED BETWEEN THE USSR, GOJ, AND BRAZIL 
REGARDING LAST SEASON\'S ANTARCTIC HARVEST, A 
COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE IWC SECRETARIAT. 
- 
4.  (C) SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE POSED REGARDING 
THE TALKING POINTS: 
- 
(A) IINO REFERRED TO THE LAST TALKING POINT, AND 
POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE ESTABLISHES A 1984/85 
HARVEST OF 342 WHALES FOR BRAZIL INSTEAD OF THE 
376 USED BY THE USG.  AKIYAMA THOUGHT THAT THE 376 
FIGURE PROBABLY INCLUDES THE TEN PERCENT IWC 
MARGIN OF ERROR THAT IS ALLOWED FOR WHALING IN 
AREA II, BUT HE POINTED OUT THAT PAST PRACTICE 
OF THE USSR/GOJ/BRAZIL AGREEMENTS HAS  BEEN NOT 
TO PROVIDE FOR ANY MARGIN OF ERROR FOR THE 
HARVEST IN AREA II.  THUS, IN THE 1983/84 SEASON 
THE FIVE PERCENT MARGIN OF ERROR ALLOWED BY THE 
IWC FOR AREA II WOULD HAVE ALLOWED A BRAZILIAN 
HARVEST OF 630 MINKE WHALES, BUT THE GOJ/USSR/BRAZIL 
ARRANGEMENT LIMITED BRAZIL\'S HARVEST TO 600 WHALES. 
SIMILARLY, FOR THE 1984/85 SEASON, BRAZIL WILL 
HARVEST 342 WHALES IN AREA II, NOT 342 PLUS TEN PERCENT, 
OR 376 WHALES.  ACCORDINGLY, GOJ\'S QUOTA UNDER THE 
IWC GUIDELINES SHOULD BE 1,941 MINKE WHALES, NOT 
1,924. AKIYAMA AND IINO WANTED TO BE SURE THAT THE 
USG REALIZED THAT A \"PAST PRACTICE\" CALUCATIONS 
WOULD ALLOW GOJ A HARVEST QUOTA OF 1,941 FOR THIS 
SEASON. 
 
(B) THE FISHERY DIVISION OFFICIALS ALSO ASKED FOR 
USG CLARIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE IN THE SECOND 
TALKING POINT TO THE NOVEMBER 13, 1984, LETTER OF THE 
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE REGARDING THE PHRASE \"IN 
EXCESS OF THE 1984/85 QUOTA FOR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE 
MINKE WHALES.\"  IN PARTICULAR, GOJ WANTS TO KNOW IF 
GOJ IS SAFE FROM THE THREAT OF CERTIFICATION UNDER 
THE PACKWOOD AMENDMENT TO THE MAGNUSON FISHERY 
CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT (MFCMA) IF GOJ 
HARVESTS FOR ANTARCTIC MINKE WHALES DO NOT EXCEED 
A CEILING OF 1,924 (OR 1,941) WHALES.  FURTHER 
ELABORATION ON THE SAME QUESTION WAS RAISED 
WITH THE COMMENT THAT USSR AND GOJ WHALERS BOTH 
OPERATE IN AREAS 4 AND 6 BUT ONLY GOJ OPERATIONS 
OCCUR IN AREA 5.  AS A RESULT, AKIYAMA AND IINO 
WONDERED IF THE TALKING POINTS WERE ONLY REFERRING TO 
AN OVERALL ANTARCTIC QUOTA FOR GOJ OF 
1,924 (OR 1,941) OR WHETHER THE QUOTA FOR EACH 
AREA WOULD BE EXAMINED IN ANY USG EVALUATION OF 
WHETHER MINKE CATCH LIMITS ARE BEING EXCEEDED THIS 
SEASON. 
- 
5.  (U) REGARDING REFTEL\'S PARA 5, AKIYAMA 
CONFIRMED THAT 106 SPERM WHALES, ALL MALES, 
HAD BEEN HARVESTED BY THE JAPANESE COASTAL 
WHALING FLEET THROUGH JANUARY 7.

1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2.  ACCORDING TO THE TOKYO PRESS JULY 4, IRANIAN MAJLIS 
SPEAKER RAFSANJANI TOLD REPORTERS AT A JULY 3 PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT IRAN CONDEMNS HIJACKINGS AND ANY OTHER 
TERRORIST ACTS.  AT THE SAME TIME, RAFSANJANI IS QUOTED 
AS CONDEMNING ABOVE ALL THE ROOT CAUSE OF TERRORISM 
WHICH, HE SAID, HINGES UPON THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPER- 
POWERS AND SOME OTHER STATES.  RAFSANJANI REPORTEDLY 
SAID IT WAS WRONG TO CONDEMN THE TWA HIJACKERS WITHOUT 
CONDEMING ISRAEL FOR DETAINING OVER SEVEN HUNDRED 
LEBANESE.  HE ALSO ACCUSED FRANCE OF SUPPORTING IRANIAN 
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY TERRORISTS, WHO HE SAID ARE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR MANY DEATHS OF IRANIAN GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS AND OTHERS.  RAFSANJANI REPORTEDLY ADDED THAT, 
IF THESE MAJOR ACTS OF TERRORISM DISAPPEAR, MINOR 
TERRORISM WILL ALSO END. 
 
3.  IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE \"DAILY YOMIURI\" 
JULY 3, RAFSANJANI REPORTEDLY CLAIMED THAT U.S. EFFORTS 
TO RETALIATE FOR THE TWA HIJACKING, SUCH AS ACTIONS 
DIRECTED AGAINST MEA, WOULD NEVER PROVIDE A FUNDAMENTAL 
SOLUTION TO END TERRORISM.  THUS, HE SAID AS LONG AS 
THE U.S. CARRIES OUT \"BIGGER TERRORISM\" AGAINST SMALL 
STATES, SUCH AS LEBANON AND IRAN, OTHER TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO AN END. 
 
4.  ON IRAN\'S RELATIONS WITH THE U.S., RAFSANJANI SAID 
NO IMPROVEMENT COULD BE POSSIBLE UNTIL THE U.S. 
\"ACKNOWLEDGES ITS PAST MISDEEDS\".  HE ADDED THAT NO 
RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN IRAN AND THE U.S. WAS POSSIBLE 
SO LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN REMAINS IN OFFICE.

-         POLICY SPEECH TO THE DIET 
 
1.  (LOU) SUMMARY:  FOREIGN MINISTER NAKAYAMA\'S MARCH 
2 SPEECH TO THE DIET ON JAPAN\'S FOREIGN POLICY IN THE 
COMING YEAR CONTAINED NO SURPRISES BUT SEVERAL 
INTERESTING SHIFTS OF NUANCE.  NAKAYAMA STRESSED THE 
CENTRALITY OF JAPAN-U.S. ECONOMIC AND SECURITY 
RELATIONS TO JAPAN\'S OVERALL FOREIGN POLICY BUT PLACED 
IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A TRILATERAL RELATIONSHIP ALSO 
INCLUDING EUROPE.  SIGNIFICANTLY, HE DID NOT MENTION A 
THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION AS A BASIS FOR THE 
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., REFERRING INSTEAD 
TO THE STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ASIA-PACIFIC 
REGION.  NAKAYAMA DESCRIBED THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS 
INITIATIVE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE ON THE 
BILATERAL AGENDA AND COMMITTED HIMSELF TO DOING ALL 
THAT HE CAN FOR PROGRESS IN THIS AREA.  ON ASIA, 
NAKAYAMA REITERATED STANDARD THEMES IN RECENT 
DIPLOMACY.  HE PLACED A RELATIVELY BRIEF DISCUSSION OF 
SOVIET RELATIONS AFTER THAT ON ASIA, OFFERING NOTHING 
NEW TO THE SOVIET UNION.  NAKAYAMA REAFFIRMED THE 
THREE PILLARS OF JAPAN\'S INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
INITIATIVE ESTABLISHED BY PRIME MINISTER TAKESHITA: 
PEACEKEEPING, ODA AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES.  ON GLOBAL 
ISSUES, HE PLEDGED SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS 
TO COMBAT DESTRUCTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, DRUGS AND 
TERRORISM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
U.S.-JAPAN BILATERAL RELATIONS 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U) FOLLOWING AN INTRODUCTION THAT DWELLED ON THE 
RAPID PACE OF CHANGE IN THE WORLD AND THE NEED FOR 
JAPAN TO HARNESS ITS ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL POWER 
IN ACTIVE DIPLOMACY, NAKAYAMA PLACED RELATIONS WITH 
THE U.S. AND REPEAT AND EUROPE FIRST AMONG REGIONAL 
ISSUES.  HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANT OF THE TRILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE BUILDING OF A NEW INTERNATIONAL 
ORDER.  TURNING IN THIS CONTEXT TO THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., NAKAYAMA: 
 
--EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF U.S. JAPAN BILATERAL 
ECONOMIC AND SECURITY RELATIONS, NOTING THE NEED FOR 
CLOSER POLICY COORDINATION NOT ONLY ON BILATERAL 
ISSUES BUT ON GLOBAL PROBLEMS AS WELL; 
 
--STRESSED THAT THE STRUCTURAL IMPEDIMENTS INITIATIVE 
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE ON THE BILATERAL AGENDA 
AND THAT HE WILL DO ALL THAT HE CAN TO ACHIEVE PROGRESS; 
 
--SAID THAT HE WILL ACCOMPANY THE PRIME MINISTER TO 
THE U.S. FOR THE MARCH 2-3 SUMMIT AND WILL DO HIS 
UTMOST TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS; AND 
 
--DESCRIBED THE SECURITY TREATY AS THE FOUNDATION OF 
U.S.-JAPAN RELATIONS AND SAID JAPAN IS COMMITTED TO 
FIRMLY MAINTAINING THE TREATY AND ENSURING ITS 
\"SMOOTHER FUNCTIONING;\" 
 
DISCUSSING THE SECURITY RELATIONSHIP, NAKAYAMA NOTED 
THAT, DESPITE DEVELOPMENTS IN EAST-WEST RELATIONS, THE 
BALANCE OF POWER AND DETERRENCE CONTINUE TO BE THE 
UNDERPINNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.  HE DID NOT 
REFER TO A THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION BUT DESCRIBED 
U.S.-JAPAN SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS AS CONTRIBUTING 
BROADLY TO THE STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. 
 
------ 
EUROPE 
------ 
 
3.  STRESSING THE NEED FOR FOR CLOSER JAPANESE 
BILATERAL TIES WITH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, NAKAYAMA 
CALLED FOR BROAD EXPANSION OF THE TRILATERAL 
U.S.-JAPAN-EUROPE RELATIONSHIP.  HE NOTED JAPAN\'S 
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FOR POLAND THE HUNGARY, ASCRIBING 
IT TO AN AWARENESS THAT THE EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN 
EASTERN EUROPE ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY OF THE WORLD AS A WHOLE, INCLUDING JAPAN. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
JAPANESE RELATIONS WITH ASIAN COUNTRIES 
--------------------------------------- 
 
4.  (U) COMMENTING ON ASIA, THE FOREIGN MINISTER: 
 
--URGED THE TWO KOREAS TO CONTINUE THEIR DIALOGUE, 
WELCOMED A POSSIBLE VISIT TO JAPAN BY ROK PRESIDENT 
ROH TAE WU, AND EXPRESSED THE GOJ\'S INTEREST IN 
CONDUCTING A DIALOGUE WITH NORTH KOREA AND SUPPORTING 
\"LATERAL EXCHANGES\" BETWEEN THE JAPANESE AND NORTH 
KOREAN PEOPLE; 
 
--NOTED THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR CHINA TO AVOID 
ISOLATING ITSELF AND THAT IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS 
BETWEEN CHINA AND THE WEST WILL REQUIRE EFFORTS ON 
BOTH SIDES; 
 
--EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE COUP ATTEMPT IN 
THE PHILIPPINES, SUPPORTED FURTHER EFFORTS TO 
CONSOLIDATE DEMOCRACY, AND INDICATED JAPAN\'S CONTINUED 
BACKING FOR THE MAI; 
 
--TOOK NOTE OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ON AN ENHANCED 
UN ROLE IN CAMBODIA AND POINTED OUT JAPAN\'S INTENTION 
TO CONTRIBUTE NOT ONLY TO CAMBODIAN RECONSTRUCTION BUT 
TO THE PEACE PROCESS AS WELL; 
 
--ACKNOWLEDGED JAPAN\'S INTEREST IN PROMOTING RELATIONS 
WITH THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT, AND 
 
--EXPRESSED THE GOJ\'S SUPPORT FOR APEC AND THE 
PROMOTION OF FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF ASIA-PACIFIC 
COOPERATION. 
 
------------------------------- 
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (LOU) NAKAYAMA HAD NOTHING NEW TO OFFER ON 
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIETS IN EITHER SUBSTANCE OR 
NUANCE.  HE REITERATED THE GOJ\'S SUPPORT FOR 
PERESTROIKA BUT CONDITIONED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE 
RELATIONSHIP ON MOVEMENT ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES 
ISSUE. 
 
---------------------------------- 
MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA 
---------------------------------- 
 
6.  (U) NAKAYAMA COUCHED HIS COMMENTS ON THE MIDDLE 
EAST, AFRICA, AND LATIN AMERICA IN TERMS OF JAPAN\'S

ARENS AND JAPAN\'S INTENTION TO MAKE FURTHER 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE; 
 
--EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR THE CHANGES IN SOUTH

STEP TOWARD PEACE IN THE REGION AND PROMISED CONTINUED 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF 
LATIN AMERICA. 
 
------------------------- 
THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY 
------------------------- 
 
7.  (U) COMMENTING ON JAPAN\'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE 
WORLD ECONOMY, NAKAYAMA: 
 
--CALLED FOR JAPAN TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN 
INCREASING POLICY COORDINATION AMONG THE INDUSTRIAL 
DEMOCRACIES THROUGH THE ANNUAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT; 
 
--EMPHASIZED JAPAN\'S NEED TO RECTIFY ITS TRADE 
IMBALANCE THROUGH, INTER ALIA, IMPROVING FOREIGN 
ACCESS TO JAPANESE MARKETS; 
 
--COMMITTED THE GOJ TO DOING ALL THAT IT CAN TO ENSURE 
THE SUCCESS OF THE URUGUAY ROUND. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION INITIATIVE, GLOBAL ISSUES 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8.  (U) FINALLY, NAKAYAMA REAFFIRMED THE GOJ\'S 1988 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION INITIATIVE, IN WHICH THE GOJ 
COMMITTED ITSELF TO COOPERATION WITH UN PEACE KEEPING 
ACTIVITIES, EXPANSION OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE (ODA), AND INCREASED CULTURAL TIES TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES.  HE SAID THAT JAPAN WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND 
AND INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ODA. 
 
9.  NAKAYAMA PLEDGED THAT JAPAN WOULD DRAW ON ITS 
WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE ITS 
COOPERATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.  HE ADDED THAT 
JAPAN WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE UN AND OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN COMBATTING THE DRUG 
PROBLEM.  HE ALSO STATED THAT JAPAN WILL STRENGTHEN 
ITS COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO PREVENT 
TERRORIST ACTS.

2.  EMBASSY IS AWARE OF AT LEAST THREE TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN THE GREATER TOKYO 
AREA MORNING OF FEBRUARY 23.  ONE INCIDENT WAS 
DIRECTED AGAINST A U.S. NAVY HOUSING FACILITY IN 
YOKOHAMA. 
 
3.  COMNAVFORJAPAN NOTIFIED EMBASSY THAT AT 
APPROXIMATELY 0615 FEBRUARY 23 THERE WAS A MAKESHIFT 
MORTAR ATTACK DIRECTED AT THE U.S. NAVY NEGISHI 
HOUSING COMPOUND IN YOKOHAMA.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES 
REPORTED.  INITIAL REPORTS INDICATED THREE PROJECTILES 
IMPACTED INSIDE THE FACILITY.  THE NAVY IS REPORTING 
FURTHER DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT IN SEPARATE CHANNELS. 
 
4.  THE OTHER TWO INCIDENTS OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE 
OCCURED AT THE JAPAN AIR SELF DEFENSE FORCE BASE AT

INJURY IN EITHER INCIDENT. 
 
5.  COMMENT:  MOTIVE AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
ATTACKS REMAINS UNCLEAR, ALTHOUGH THE INCIDENTS ARE 
SIMILAR TO PAST ATTACKS BY ULTRA-LEFT RADICALS, 
PARTICULARLY CHUKAKUHA..  WHILE A CONNECTION WITH THE 
GULF WAR CANNOT BE RULED OUT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THE 
ATTACKS WERE TIMED TO COINCIDE WITH THE FEBRUARY 23 
INVESTITURE OF THE CROWN PRINCE AS THE SUCCESSOR TO 
THE THRONE.  END COMMENT.

WHETHER GOJ HAD FINALIZED ITS VIEW ON IRAN JOINING THE ASIAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK. 
 
3.  TOYODA SAID THE MATTER IS CURRENTLY BEING DISCUSSED 
INTERNALLY WITHIN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY, BUT AS FAR AS THE 
FINANCE MINISTRY OF JAPAN IS CONCERNED, THEY WILL SUPPORT IRAN 
JOINING THE ADB.  TOYODA NOTED THAT EVEN BEFORE FINATT HAD 
MADE EARLIER DEMARCHE (REF B), MOF HAD INFORMALLY COMMUNICATED 
ITS SUPPORT OF IRAN TO THE ADB.  A FORMAL POSITION WON\'T BE 
ANNOUNCED UNTIL MOFA HAS COMPLETED ITS INTERNAL DELIBERATIONS, 
BUT ON MATTERS OF THIS TYPE MOF TYPICALLY PREVAILS OVER MOFA 
UNLESS THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL POLITICAL REASONS WEIGHING IN 
MOFA\'S FAVOR. 
 
4.  MOF\'S DECISION IS BASED ON IRAN BEING A MEMBER OF OTHER 
IFIS (IMF, IBRD) AND ITS INCLUSION AS A REGIONAL COUNTRY UNDER 
ESCAP.  TOYODA SAID MOF SYMPATHIZES WITH USG ON NOT WANTING A 
SPONSOR OF STATE TERRORISM TO HAVE ACCESS TO IFI RESOURCES, 
WHICH MAY THEN ALLOW DIVERSION OF FUNDS TO TERRORIST 
PURPOSES.  BUT GIVEN THE ESCAP DEFINITION OF REGIONAL 
COUNTRIES, AND IRAN\'S OTHER IFI MEMBERSHIPS, MOF FEELS IT 
APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT MEMBERSHIP IN THE ADB. 
 
5.  ON THE OTHER HAND, MOF WILL NOT LOBBY OTHER COUNTRIES TO 
SUPPORT MEMBERSHIP. 
 
6.  TOYODA SAID NONE OF THIS HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE 
IRANIANS. 
 
7.  WITH RESPECT TO IBRD LENDING, AND POSSIBLE FUTURE LENDING 
BY THE ADB IF IRAN BECOMES A MEMBER OF THAT INSTITUTION, 
TOYODA SAID MOF WOULD BE FLEXIBLE, AND POSSIBLY OPPOSE LOANS 
\"A LA THE PRC\" FOLLOWING THE TIANANMEN SQUARE INCIDENT AND THE 
G-7 AGREEMENT.  HOWEVER, IF THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF A 
PROJECT IS SO OVERWHELMINGLY CONVINCING, MOF WOULD HAVE 
DIFFICULTY OPPOSING SUCH A LOAN FOR IRAN IN IBRD OR ELSEWHERE. 
 
8.  ON RELATED MATTERS, TOYODA CONTINUES TO ASK \"WHO\" ASKED US 
ABOUT NORTH KOREA\'S OBSERVER STATUS AT THE ADB.  FINATT SAID 
HE WOULD INQUIRE.  WITH REGARD TO THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT 
FUND OF THE EAI, TOYODA NOTED THAT JAPAN\'S DIET CLEARED THE 
WAY LAST FRIDAY (MARCH 27) FOR JAPAN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MIF 
UP TO $500 MILLION OVER 5 YEARS.  MOF ASKS THE STATUS OF USG 
APPROPRIATIONS.

U.S.-DPRK NUCLEAR TALKS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  NORTH KOREA HAS INSTRUCTED KOREANS WHO 
RESIDE IN JAPAN BUT ARE VISITING NORTH KOREA TO RETURN 
TO JAPAN AND MAY NOT LET THEM VISIT NORTH KOREA UNTIL 
THE END OF JULY.  KOREANS LIVING ABROAD HAVE BEEN 
INSTRUCTED TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF IDEOLOGICAL 
INDOCTRINATION.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS IN JAPAN BELIEVE 
THAT THE DPRK THINKS INCREASED INDOCTRINATION IS 
NECESSARY IN ORDER TO COUNTER POSSIBLE CORRUPTING 
EFFECTS OF CONTACTS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, WHICH 
NORTH KOREA ALSO SEEMS TO BE SUPPORTING.  INCREASED 
INDOCTRINATION MAY ALSO BE NECESSARY IF, AS SOME DPRK 
BUREAUCRATS ADVISE, NORTH KOREA ADOPTS CERTAIN WESTERN 
BUSINESS PRACTICES.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT 
THE U.S.-DPRK TALKS DID NOT SOLVE IMPORTANT ISSUES 
(IAEA INSPECTIONS).  THEY WORRY THAT THE NORTH MAY 
BLOCK FURTHER COMPROMISE BY INSISTING ON \"EQUAL\" 
TREATMENT (SUCH AS THE RIGHT TO INSPECT U.S. BASES). 
NORTH KOREA IS ALSO USING A DIFFERENT TRANSLATION OF 
THE POST-MEETING STATEMENT IN ORDER, APPARENTLY, TO 
CONVINCE ITS PUBLIC THAT THE U.S. HAS AGREED TO 
RESPECT THE KIM IL SUNG SYSTEM AND NOT JUST DPRK 
SOVEREIGNTY.  PYONGYANG HAS ALSO ASKED CHOSEN SOREN TO 
STUDY WAYS OF ACQUIRING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PEACEFUL 
USE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY.  SOME CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS 
BELIEVE THAT THIS MAY INDICATE NORTH KOREA\'S INTENTION 
TO FOREGO THE MILITARY ASPECT OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM. 
END SUMMARY 
 
3.  HAJIME IZUMI (PROTECT STRICTLY), ASSOCIATE 
PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SHIZUOKA, ON JUNE 18 
DISCUSSED CHOSEN SOREN\'S RECENT ACTIVITIES.  (IZUMI IS 
A LONG-TIME EMBASSY CONTACT WITH GOOD ACCESS TO THE 
CHOSEN SOREN ORGANIZATION.) 
 
KOREANS RESIDING IN JAPAN TOLD TO RETURN 
---------------------------------------- 
4.  IZUMI MET WITH CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS ON JUNE 14. 
THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DPRK ORDERED KOREANS WHO WERE 
IN NORTH KOREA AT THE TIME BUT WHO PERMANENTLY RESIDE 
IN JAPAN, TO RETURN TO JAPAN, BEGINNING ON JUNE 15. 
KOREANS IN JAPAN WERE INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO TRAVEL TO NORTH KOREA UNTIL THE END OF JULY. 
SOME HIGH-RANKING CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS, HOWEVER, WERE 
ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN NORTH KOREA. 
 
5.  SOME KOREAN RESIDENTS OF JAPAN RETURNED TO JAPAN 
ON JUNE 10 ON A SHIP THAT ARRIVED IN NIIGATA.  SOME OF 
THEM, ALONG WITH CHOSEN SOREN\'S SENIOR LEADERSHIP, 
ATTENDED A SPECIAL CHOSEN SOREN MEETING IN TOKYO ON 
JUNE 11.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE MEETING WAS PRIVATE AND 
CLOSED.  THOSE RETURNING FROM NORTH KOREA SAID THAT 
THE DPRK HAD INSTRUCTED CHOSEN SOREN TO INCREASE 
IDEOLOGICAL INDOCTRINATION WITHIN THE KOREAN COMMUNITY 
IN JAPAN. 
 
6.  THIS INSTRUCTION, CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS NOTED, WAS 
IN LINE WITH A STATEMENT KIM JONG IL MADE ON APRIL 27 
IN A PRIVATE SPEECH TO SENIOR CADRES IN WHICH HE SAID 
THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN IDEOLOGICAL 
TEACHING IN ORDER TO RAISE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF 
\"ORDINARY\" KOREANS AND OF KOREANS LIVING OVERSEAS. 
 
7.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS FOUND THAT THE NEW DIRECTIVE 
AND THE APRIL 27 KIM JONG IL STATEMENT SEEMED TO 
CONTRADICT A KJI STATEMENT OF MARCH 1991, IN WHICH HE 
SAID THAT KOREANS LIVING ABROAD FACE DIFFERENT 
EXPERIENCES AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ALLOWED SOME 
FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING TO THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES. 
THEY ALSO RECALLED AN AUGUST 15, 1992 STATEMENT BY KIM 
IL SUNG (ANOTHER PRIVATE SPEECH) IN WHICH THE GREAT 
LEADER SAID THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD ADOPT A MORE OPEN 
POLICY TOWARD THE OUTSIDE WORLD, SUPPOSEDLY USING THE 
KOREAN EXPRESSION \"KAEBANG,\" WHICH MEANS \"OPEN DOOR.\" 
(IZUMI COMMENTED THAT THIS MAY BE THE ONLY TIME KIM IL 
SUNG HAS USED THIS EXPRESSION IN SUCH A CONTEXT.) 
 
8.  CHOSEN SOREN, IZUMI RELATED, MANAGED TO RECONCILE 
THE NEW DIRECTIVE ON INCREASED IDEOLOGICAL 
INDOCTRINATION WITH THE PREVIOUS APPARENT POLICY OF 
ENCOURAGING SOME OPENNESS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, 
PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF OVERSEAS KOREANS.  CHOSEN 
SOREN CONCLUDED THAT THE DPRK LEADERSHIP STILL FAVORED 
OPENNESS BUT THAT, IN ORDER TO WARD OFF THE CORRUPTING 
EFFECTS OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, IDEOLOGICAL 
INDOCTRINATION WOULD ALSO HAVE TO INCREASE. 
 
9.  IN IZUMI\'S VIEW, THE DPRK CONSIDERS INCREASED 
INDOCTRINATION AS A WAY TO STRENGTHEN LOYALTY TO AND 
BELIEF IN THE DPRK SYSTEM AND ALSO AS A MEANS OF 
\"PROTECTING\" INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO CORRUPTING OUTSIDE 
INFLUENCES. 
 
IN PYONGYANG . . . 
------------------ 
10.  IZUMI SAID THAT ANOTHER REASON FOR THE INCREASED 
EMPHASIS ON IDEOLOGICAL TRAINING IS THAT, IN NORTH 
KOREA, SOME BUREAUCRATS REPORTEDLY SUPPORT NORTH 
KOREA\'S ADOPTING WESTERN BUSINESS PRACTICES IN ORDER 
TO MAKE NORTH KOREA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL 
INVESTORS.  IZUMI SAID THAT, IN PARTICULAR, SOME 
BUREAUCRATS ARE PUSHING FOR NORTH KOREA TO ACCEPT 
WESTERN NOTIONS OF CONTRACT LAW.  HOWEVER, IDEOLOGUES 
ARGUE THAT ACCEPTING SUCH PRACTICES WOULD THREATEN THE 
PURITY OF NORTH KOREA\'S SYSTEM.  THEY THEREFORE OPPOSE 
THE BUREAUCRATS\' SUGGESTION.  CHOSEN SOREN BELIEVES 
THAT ONE WAY TO REFORM BUSINESS PRACTICES AND ALSO 
MAINTAIN PURITY IS TO INCREASE INDOCTRINATION SO THAT 
THE POSSIBILITY OF CORRUPTION CAN BE MINIMIZED.  (OR 
SO THE THINKING GOES.) 
 
NORTH KOREANS IN JAPAN 
---------------------- 
11.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE SYSTEM OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS RUN 
BY CHOSEN SOREN IS RELATIVELY WELL-ORGANIZED.  THERE 
ARE ABOUT 20 SUCH PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN JAPAN AS WELL AS 
ONE PRIVATE UNIVERSITY IN THE TOKYO AREA CATERING TO 
NORTH KOREANS.  IZUMI SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN MAINTAINS 
A MUCH STRONGER PRIVATE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAN DO KOREANS 
SYMPATHETIC TO SOUTH KOREA.  THUS, CHILDREN OF CHOSEN 
SOREN MEMBERS PROBABLY RECEIVE MUCH STRONGER 
IDEOLOGICAL INDOCTRINATION THAN DO CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS 
ORIENTED TOWARDS THE ROK. 
 
U.S.-DPRK NUCLEAR TALKS 
----------------------- 
12.  IZUMI SAID THAT NORTH KOREA USES A TRANSLATION OF 
THE STATEMENT ISSUED AFTER THE RECENT NEW YORK TALKS 
THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE 
VERSION.  (IZUMI WAS AWARE THAT THE LATTER IS 
CONSIDERED THE \"OFFICIAL\" VERSION.)  CHOSEN SOREN, 
EXPOSED TO THE ENGLISH AND JAPANESE VERSIONS, AS WELL 
AS THE DPRK VERSION, DOES NOT CONSIDER THE TALKS TO 
HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS FOR THE NORTH.  CHOSEN SOREN 
MEMBERS REALIZE THAT THE IAEA INSPECTION ISSUE IS 
UNRESOLVED.  THEY BELIEVE IT HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT 
NORTH KOREA WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO SUBMIT TO IAEA 
INSPECTIONS. 
 
13.  CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS THINK THAT NORTH KOREA WILL 
REFER TO THOSE TERMS, IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE 
STATEMENT, THAT CALL FOR \"UNPREJUDICED, IMPARTIAL, AND 
EQUAL\" TREATMENT.  THEY WORRY THAT THE DPRK WILL REFER 
TO THESE TERMS AND DEMAND \"EQUAL\" TREATMENT (E.G., THE 
RIGHT TO INSPECT U.S. BASES) AND THEREBY MAKE 
COMPROMISE DIFFICULT.  IZUMI SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN 
SEEMS TO WANT TO RESOLVE REMAINING NUCLEAR ISSUES 
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. 
 
14.  IZUMI SAID THAT THE NORTH KOREAN VERSION OF THE 
STATEMENT DOES NOT CORRECTLY TRANSLATE \"SOVEREIGNTY\" 
(\"SHUKEN\" IN THE JAPANESE PRONUNCIATION OF THE SAME 
CHINESE CHARACTERS USED ALSO IN KOREAN).  INSTEAD, THE 
DPRK VERSION USES THE EXPRESSION \"JISHUKEN,\" WHICH HAS 
A MEANING CLOSER TO THE ENGLISH WORD \"INDEPENDENCE.\" 
IZUMI SAID THAT, IN KOREAN, \"JISHUKEN\" CAN ALSO MEAN 
\"NATIONAL SYSTEM\" OR \"INDEPENDENT NATIONAL SYSTEM.\" 
THE USE OF THIS TERM, IZUMI SAID, INDICATES THAT NORTH 
KOREA IS TRYING TO TELL ITS PEOPLE THAT THE U.S. HAS 
AGREED TO RESPECT THE DPRK\'S \"INDEPENDENT NATIONAL 
SYSTEM\" (I.E., THE KIM IL SUNG REGIME) RATHER THAN 
SIMPLY ITS SOVEREIGNTY. 
 
15.  IZUMI ALSO NOTED THAT AT THE POST-MEETING PRESS 
CONFERENCE, THE DPRK REP REFERRED TO \"SHUKEN,\" 
\"JISHUKEN,\" AND EACH COUNTRY\'S \"DIFFERENT POLITICAL 
SYSTEMS\" AS MATTERS ON WHICH THE U.S. AND DPRK REACHED 
AGREEMENT.  IZUMI SAID THAT THIS ALSO SHOWED THAT 
NORTH KOREA WAS TRYING TO USE THE MEETING TO SHOW THE 
NORTH KOREAN PUBLIC THAT THE U.S. HAS AGREED TO 
RESPECT THE KIM IL SUNG SYSTEM. 
 
NON-MILITARY NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY 
------------------------------- 
16.  IZUMI SAID THAT PYONGYANG ALSO INSTRUCTED CHOSEN 
SOREN TO STUDY WAYS OF COLLECTING MATERIAL (OF 
WHATEVER ORIGIN) CONCERNING THE PEACEFUL USE OF 
NUCLEAR ENERGY.  PYONGYANG DID NOT, HOWEVER, EXPLAIN 
THE REASON FOR THIS INSTRUCTION.  IZUMI SAID THAT SOME 
CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT NORTH KOREA MAY WANT 
TO GIVE UP THE MILITARY ASPECT OF ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
AND CONVERT TO PURELY CIVILIAN APPLICATIONS.  (IZUMI 
SAID THAT CHOSEN SOREN SUPPORTED THIS IDEA, IF THIS IS 
A CORRECT INTERPRETATION OF THE DPRK\'S INTENTIONS.) 
CHOSEN SOREN MEMBERS RECALLED THAT, FOLLOWING THE 
FIRST IAEA INSPECTIONS IN JUNE 1992, THE DPRK\'S REP IN 
GENEVA SAID THAT, IF THE WEST WERE TO HELP NORTH KOREA 
DEVELOP A LIGHT WATER REACTOR SYSTEM, THE NORTH MIGHT 
STOP ITS REPROCESSING PROGRAM.

SUBJECT:  BRUNEI FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMED BOLKIAH\'S 
          MARCH 7 - 9 VISIT TO JAPAN 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  BRUNEI FOREIGN MINISTER MOHAMED BOLKIAH 
VISITED JAPAN MARCH 7 - 9 IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY AND 
VACATIONED IN TOKYO THROUGH THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND.  HE 
MET WITH THE EMPEROR, CROWN PRINCE, AND GOJ FOREIGN 
MINISTER KONO.  WITH THE LATTER HE DISCUSSED THE ASEAN 
REGIONAL FORUM (ARF) AND PMC, NORTH KOREA, NPT 
EXTENSION, UN REFORM, APEC, AND BILATERAL ISSUES.  END 
SUMMARY 
 
3.  MOFA 2ND SOUTHEAST ASIA DIVISION DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
MAEDA ON MARCH 16 BRIEFED US ON BRUNEI FOREIGN 
MINISTER PRINCE MOHAMED BOLKIAH\'S MARCH 7 - 9 VISIT TO 
JAPAN, DURING WHICH HE HAD AN AUDIENCE WITH THE 
EMPEROR AND CROWN PRINCE AND MET AND JOINED IN A 
WORKING DINNER WITH GOJ FM KONO.  MAEDA SAID THAT THE 
JAPANESE HAD SUGGESTED MOHAMED\'S VISIT, PRIMARILY TO 
DISCUSS ISSUES RELATED TO BRUNEI\'S 1995 CHAIRMANSHIP 
OF ASEAN.  ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WIFE AND NINE OF HIS 
CHILDREN, MOHAMED REMAINED IN JAPAN DURING THE 
FOLLOWING WEEKEND, WHICH HE SPENT AT DISNEYLAND TO 
CELEBRATE THE END OF THIS YEAR\'S RAMADAN SEASON. 
 
ASEAN 
----- 
4.  MOHAMED DISCUSSED MEMBERSHIP ISSUES PERTAINING TO 
ASEAN AND ITS ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES.  HE SAID THAT 
ASEAN CURRENTLY SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT, IF A COUNTRY 
HAS OBSERVER STATUS AT AN ASEAN EVENT, SUCH A COUNTRY 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED FULL MEMBERSHIP IN THE ARF.  THUS, 
IN MOHAMED\'S VIEW (AND, ACCORDING TO HIM, IN ASEAN\'S 
VIEW), CAMBODIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED FULL MEMBERSHIP 
STATUS IN THE ARF RATHER THAN ITS HERETOFORE LESSER 
STATUS.  MOHAMED SAID THAT AUSTRALIAN FM EVNS HAD 
RECENTLY EXPRESSED AGREEMENT WITH THIS POLICY. 
 
5.  MOHAMED SAID THAT THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ALSO BELIEVE 
THAT THE ARF MEETING LAST YEAR WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND 
SHOULD BE EXTENDED.  ASEAN WOULD BE WILLING TO SHORTEN 
THE PMC TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE.  MOHAMED SAID THAT 
ASEAN IS NOW CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING 
SUCH A CHANGE IN THE ARF/PMC SCHEDULE.  DECISION- 
MAKING WITHIN ARF SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT ON A \"STRICTLY 
CONSENSUS BASIS,\" MOHAMED SAID.  THE \"SPEED\" OF THE 
ARF\'S DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WITH WHICH ALL 
PARTICIPANTS ARE \"COMFORTABLE,\" HE FURTHER ADVISED 
 
6.  MOHAMED SAID THAT IT WOULD BE \"REASONABLE\" FOR 
NORTH KOREA AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE TO JOIN THE 
ARF.  HE REFERRED TO ASEAN\'S POLICY OF ENGAGEMENT WITH 
BURMA AND SAID THAT A SIMILAR POLICY OF INCLUSION 
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA. 
 
NORTH KOREA 
----------- 
7.  MOHAMED SAID THAT BRUNEI WOULD LIKE TO COOPERATE 
WITH KEDO \"AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.\"  HE SAID THAT THE 
ASEAN COUNTRIES WERE THINKING ABOUT ASKING TO JOIN 
KEDO AS ASEAN AND NOT IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES. 
 
NPT 
--- 
8.  KONO EXPRESSED JAPAN\'S SUPPORT FOR THE UNLIMITED 
EXTENSION OF THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.  HE 
ASKED THAT BRUNEI ADOPT A SIMILAR POSITION.  MOHAMED 
COMMENTED THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN ENERGETICALLY 
LOBBYING BRUNEI TO SUPPORT UNLIMITED EXTENSION.  HE 
SAID THAT BRUNEI\'S POSITION IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE 
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT BUT HE COMMENTED THAT, IN LIGHT 
OF KONO\'S REQUEST, BRUNEI WOULD GIVE THE QUESTION OF 
UNLIMITED EXTENSION \"DUE CONSIDERATION.\" 
 
UN ISSUES 
--------- 
9.  MAEDA NOTED THAT BRUNEI HAS IN THE PAST EXPRESSED 
SUPPORT AT THE WORKING-LEVEL FOR JAPAN\'S OBTAINING A 
PERMANENT UNSC SEAT.  MOHAMED TOLD KONO THAT BRUNEI 
SUPPORTS SUCH A SEAT FOR JAPAN.  MAEDA SAID THAT THE 
JAPANESE WERE PLEASED WITH THIS UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT 
AND THAT IT WAS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF SUPPORT JAPAN HAS 
SO FAR RECEIVED FROM BRUNEI. 
 
APEC 
---- 
10.  BRUNEI\'S FOREIGN MINISTER EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR 
JAPAN\'S \"PARTNERSHIP FOR PROGRESS\" CONCEPT OF REGIONAL 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS AN APEC ACTIVITY.  MOHAMED 
SAID THAT HE WAS NOT OPPOSED TO OTHER SUGGESTED APEC 
ACTIVITIES (E.G., TRADE LIBERALIZATION) BUT THAT IT 
WAS IMPORTANT ALSO TO WORK ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AS 
JAPAN HAS SUGGESTED IN ITS PARTNERSHIP CONCEPT. 
 
BILATERAL ISSUES 
---------------- 
11.  THE JAPANESE THANKED MOHAMED FOR THE ASSISTANCE 
(BOTTLED WATER, CLOTHES, FOOD) THAT BRUNEI PROVIDED IN 
RESPONSE TO THE JANUARY KOBE EARTHQUAKE.  MAEDA 
COMMENTED THAT BRUNEI LEASED TRUCKS AND DISTRIBUTED 
THE GOODS ITSELF, WITHOUT INVOLVING THE GOJ.  HE SAID 
THAT THE GOJ WELCOMED THE INITIATIVE BRUNEI TOOK IN 
THAT REGARD.  MOHAMED THANKED JAPAN FOR ITS 
COOPERATION IN HAVING SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED LAST FALL 
A BILATERAL AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE REGULAR DIRECT 
FLIGHTS BETWEEN OSAKA AND BRUNEI.  THERE ARE NOW TWO 
FLIGHTS A WEEK.  MAEDA SAID THAT NO JAPANESE CARRIERS 
HAVE ASKED TO FLY THIS ROUTE, ALTHOUGH THE JAPANESE 
ARE ENTITLED UNDER LAST FALL\'S AGREEMENT TO DO SO IF 
THEY WANT THEM.  THUS ONLY BRUNEI\'S CARRIER IS NOW 
USING THE ROUTE. 
 
12.  KONO AND MOHAMED DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT BRUNEI 
WILL SOON \"GRADUATE\" FROM THE OECD\'S DAC LIST AND WILL 
THEREFORE BECOME INELIGIBLE FOR JAPANESE OFFICIAL 
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.  MAEDA SAID THAT THIS WOULD 
OCCUR AROUND THE BEGINNING OF 1996.  BOTH SIDES WOULD 
LIKE TO CONTINUE SOME FORM OF ECONOMIC COOPERATION TO 
REPLACE JAPAN\'S ODA PROGRAM BUT NOTHING FIRM HAS BEEN 
DECIDED.  MAEDA SAID THAT BRUNEI, BECAUSE OF A LACK OF 
EXPERIENCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES, WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE 
IN THE POSITION THAT SINGAPORE WAS WHEN JAPAN AND 
SINGAPORE WORKED OUT THEIR ONGOING \"PARTNERSHIP 
PROGRAM.\"  UNDER THIS PROGRAM, JAPAN AND SINGAPORE ARE 
TO CARRY OUT A FIVE-YEAR EFFORT, FUNDED INITIALLY IN 
LARGE PART BY JAPAN BUT FUNDED TOWARD THE END MAINLY 
BY SINGAPORE, UNDER WHICH JAPAN WILL ASSIST SINGAPORE 
IN BECOMING AN ODA DONOR RATHER THAN RECIPIENT.  MAEDA 
SAID THAT BRUNEI IS NOT AT A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT 
WHERE A SIMILAR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WOULD BE 
APPROPRIATE. 
 
13.  COMMENT:  CONSISTENT WITH MAEDA\'S ASSESSMENT, 
MOHAMED\'S VISIT TO JAPAN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY 
ROUTINE.  THE JAPANESE SIDE MADE ITS USUAL POINTS ON 
UN ISSUES AND ON THE APEC \"PARTNERSHIP FOR PROGRESS\" 
CONCEPT.  WE NOTE THAT IN RECENT HIGH LEVEL EXCHANGES, 
THE JAPANESE HAVE BEGUN INCLUDING THE NPT EXTENSION 
ISSUE AS AN AGENDA ITEM.  END COMMENT
