TAGS:  PTER, PREL, PE 
SUBJECT:  SENDERO CELEBRATES FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
\"ARMED STRUGGLE\" 
 
REF:  LIMA 5476 
 
1.  IN MOST IMPRESSIVE SERIES OF COORDINATED ATTACKS 
IN LIMA SINCE JULY, 1984, TERRORISTS, PRESUMED TO 
BE SENDERISTAS CELEBRATING FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THEIR MAY 18, 1980 \"DECLARATION OF WAR\" ON GOP, 
STRUCK AT VARIOUS DIPLOMATIC AND BUSINESS TARGETS 
IN LIMA AREA NIGHT OF MAY 16.  IN ADDITION TO 
DYNAMITE CHARGES THROWN AT RESIDENCE OF U.S. AMBASSADOR 
AND AT PERUVIAN-NORTH AMERICAN CULTURIAL INSTITUTE 
(IPNCA) (REFTEL), 3 CHARGES DESTROYED MAIN DOOR 
AND PART OF ENCLOSURE WALL OF CHINESE (PRC) EMBASSY 
IN SAN ISIDRO.  PRESS REPORTS THAT BOMBS WERE ALSO THROWN 
AT REAR OF SOVIET EMBASSY IN SAN ISIDRO HAVE BEEN 
DENIED BY PERUVIAN POLICE.  REPORTED ATTACKS ON CUBAN 
AND ISRAELI EMBASSIES HAVE ALSO BEEN DISPROVED (IN 
ISRAELI CASE, BY EMBOFF CALLING ISRAELI EMBASSY). 
IN ALL INCIDENTS INVOLVING DIPLOMATIC CHARGES, DAMAGE 
WAS MINOR; ONE EMPLOYEE OF PRC EMBASSY WAS REPORTED 
TO BE SLIGHTLY WOUNDED BY FLYING GLASS. 
- 
2.  ACCORDING TO OUTLINE OF EVENTS REPORTED IN PRESS, 
SERIES OF ATTACKS BEGAN ABOUT 2100, WHEN PARTIAL 
BLACKOUT OCCURRED IN PORTIONS OF LIMA DUE TO DYNAMITING 
OF AT LEAST TWO ELECTRICAL TOWERS, AT MATUCANA 
AND HUINCO, IN MANTARO VALLEY POWER GRID.  PORTIONS 
OF MIRAFLORES, SAN ISIDRO AND CENTRAL LIMA WERE 
AMONG AREAS AFFECTED, AND BROWN-OUTS OCCURRED 
SPORADICALLY IN REST OF CITY.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, 
SHOOTING OCCURRED AND DYNAMITE WAS THROWN AT TWO 
PERUVIAN MARINE POSTS, IN UPPER-CLASS SUBURB OF 
CHACARILLA DEL ESTANQUE, AND IN JICARILLA, IN SUBURB 
OF SAN MARTIN DE PORRES.  IN BOTH CASES, SHOOTING 
RESULTED BETWEEN POLICE AND SUBVERSIVES,  WITH TWO 
POLICEMEN KILLED.  WE SUSPECT THAT REPORTED GUN- 
BATTLES SAID TO HAVE OCCURRED AT MINISTRY OF WAR AND 
AT 79TH GUARDIA CIVIL STATION IN CHACARILLA WERE 
DUE TO NERVOUS GUARDS FIRING IN AIR.  AT LEAST SIX 
SUSPECTS WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AT JICARILLA, SOME 
OF WHOM WERE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FOUND IN NEAR-BY 
VAN.  AT ROUGHLY SAME TIME,ANOTHER ARMED GROUP TOSSED 
DYNAMITE AT MUNICIPAL OFFICES AND AT BRANCH OF 
BANCO WEISE IN SUBURB OF VILLA MARIA DE TRIUNFO, 
CAUSING DAMAGE BUT NO CASUALTIES.  DYNAMITE CHARGES 
WERE ALSO TOSSED AT TODOS SUPERMARKET IN MONTERRICO 
AND AT OFFICES OF UTILITY ELECTROLIMA IN SUBURB 
OF SAN JUAN DE LURIGANCHO, CAUSING MAJOR DAMAGE 
AT BOTH SITES.  SCATTERED EXPLOSIONS WERE REPORTED 
AT OTHER LOCATIONS, INCLUDING SAN MARCOS UNIVERSITY 
AND PLAZA DE ITALIA.  FINALLY, SUBVERSIVE ELEMENTS 
ILLUMINATED LARGE HAMMER AND SICKLE DISPLAYS ON 
HILLS ABOVE WORKING-CLASS SUBURBS OF EL AGUSTINO AND 
VILLA EL SALVADOR.  IN LATTER CASE, POLICE ARRIVED 
AT SITE QUICKLY AND ARRESTED AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER 
OF PERSONS TRYING TO FLEE THE AREA. 
- 
3.  AT OUTSET OF WAVE OF ATTACKS, POLICE RUSHED 
REINFORCEMENTS TO HOMES OF MEMBERS OF NATIONAL 
ELECTIONS BOARD (JNE), WHO HAVE BEEN RECEIVING 
TELEPHONE DEATH THREATS FOR LAST TWO WEEKS.  AT 
HOME OF JNE SECRETARY GENERAL OSWALDO CORPANCHO, 
POLICE REPORTED THAT A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO 
HAD BEEN APPROACHING HOUSE FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
PILED INTO SAME CAR AND FLED WHEN POLICE ARRIVED. 
- 
4.  COMMENT:  VARIETY AND COORDINATION OF ATTACKS 
SUGGESTS THAT, AFTER A PERIOD OF RELATIVE QUIESENCE, 
SENDERO LUMINOSO HAS AGAIN REPLENISHED ITS RANKS 
AND REGAINED ATTACK CAPABILITY IN LIMA, IN SPITE 
OF ARRESTS OF VARIOUS KEY MEMBERS.  POLICE ARE 
UNANIMOUS IN ATTRIBUTING ATTACKS TO CELEBRATION OF 
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF \"DECLARATION OF WAR.\"  SL HAS 
PREVIOUSLY CELEBRATED SIMILAR ANNIVERSARIES WITH 
SPECTACULAR ATTACKS.  ACTUAL ANNIVERSARY, OF COURSE, 
IS TOMORROW AND MORE VIOLENCE MAY WELL TAKE PLACE. 
EMBASSY IS TAKING ADDITIONAL SECURITY PRECAUTIONS 
(SEPTEL).

REF:  (A) STATE 42378 
-     (B) 87 LIMA 5659 
-     (C) 87 LIMA 6577 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS PERU PORTION OF DEPARTMENT\'S NEW 
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM (REF A). 
REFS B AND C CONTAIN MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON 
PERUVIAN GUERRILLA GROUPS. 
 
3.  SINCE THE APPEARANCE OF TERRORISM IN 1980, 
TERRORIST ATTACKS AND GOVERNMENT RESPONSES HAVE 
RESULTED IN A DEATH TOLL ESTIMATED AT OVER 10,000. 
DURING 1987, PERU CONTINUED TO CONFRONT TWO SIGNIFICANT 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE LARGER GROUP, KNOWN AS 
\"SENDERO LUMINOSO\" (\"SHINING PATH\"), KILLED AT 
LEAST 600 PERSONS IN 1987.  ITS VICTIMS RANGED 
FROM PEASANT OPPONENTS TO GOVERNMENT AND PARTY 
OFFICIALS AND THE SECURITY FORCES.  IN ADDITION, 
SENDERO CARRIED OUT NUMEROUS BOMBINGS AND BLACKOUTS. 
DURING ONE BLACKOUT IN NOVEMBER 1987, SENDERO 
DETONATED A BOMB IN FRONT OF THE U.S. EMBASSY, 
CAUSING MINOR MATERIAL DAMAGE.  THE SMALLER  \"TUPAC 
AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT\" (MRTA) ALSO WAS ACTIVE 
DURING 1987, KILLING AS MANY AS 20 PERSONS AND 
CARRYING OUT NUMEROUS BOMBINGS.  THE MRTA ON 
SEVERAL OCCASIONS BOMBED THE USG INSTALLATIONS 
AND U.S. COMPANIES, CAUSING MINOR 
MATERIAL DAMAGES (BUT NO PERSONAL INJURIES).  NO 
FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS CARRIED OUT ATTACKS IN 
PERU. 
 
4.  THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO MAKE IMPORTANT ARRESTS 
OF ALLEGED TERRORISTS DURING 1987, INCLUDING HIGH- 
RANKING MEMBERS OF THE MRTA.  THE GOVERNMENT NONETHE- 
LESS WAS UNABLE TO WEAKEN SENDERO SIGNIFICANTLY, AND 
SENDERO APPEARS TO HAVE ENLARGED ITS AREA OF OPERATIONS 
DURING THE PAST YEAR.  PARTICULARLY WORRISOME IS 
SENDERO\'S EXPANSION INTO THE COCA-PRODUCING AREAS OF 
THE JUNGLE, LEADING THE GOVERNMENT TO CHARGE THAT 
SENDERO IS COOPERATING WITH NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. 
THIS IS PROBABLY TRUE IN SOME INSTANCES; IT IS 
CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT SENDERO HAS SOUGHT TO PORTRAY 
ITSELF AS DEFENDING PEASANT COCA GROWERS. 
 
5.  JUDICIAL EFFORTS AGAINST TERRORISM CONTINUE TO 
MOVE SLOWLY.  THERE IS A HUGE BACKLOG IN PERUVIAN 
COURTS, AND TERRORISM SUSPECTS FREQUENTLY ARE DETAINED 
FOUR YEARS PENDING TRIAL.  FEWER THAN 50 PERSONS WERE 
CONVICTED OF TERRORISM DURING 1987.  AMONG THE CASES 
CURRENTLY BEING TRIED ARE 15 PERSONS ACCUSED OF THE 
JUNE 26, 1986 BOMBING OF THE CUZCO TRAIN STATION, 
DURING WHICH TWO AMERICANS AND SEVEN OTHER FOREIGNERS 
WERE KILLED, AND SEVERAL AMERICANS WERE WOUNDED. 
 
6.  SENDERO DOES NOT APPEAR TO RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT 
FROM ANY FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OR FOREIGN TERRORIST 
GROUP.  THERE ARE REPORTS THAT PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS 
IN THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL WESTERN EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES HAVE COLLECTED FUNDS ON BEHALF OF SENDERO, 
BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THESE FUNDS ARE CHANNELED 
TO SENDERO.  THE INTERNATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT, 
A GROUP OF MAOIST PARTIES HEADQUARTERED IN LONDON, 
PERIODICALLY ISSUES MANIFESTOS SUPPORTING SENDERO. 
 
7.  CLAIMS OF CUBAN AND NICARAGUAN SUPPORT FOR THE 
MRTA SURFACE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PERUVIAN PRESS. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN THAT AT LEAST ONE MRTA 
LEADER TRAVELED RECENTLY TO NICARAGUA BUT HAS NOT 
DEMONSTRATED OR CLAIMED THAT THESE COUNTRIES PROVIDED 
ANY MATERIAL SUPPORT TO THE MRTA.  THE MRTA DOES HAVE 
CLOSE TIES TO THE M-19 TERRORISTS OF COLOMBIA AND 
THE ALFARO VIVE CARAJO OF ECUADOR.  IT IS LIKELY THAT 
THE MRTA HAS ACQUIRED ARMS FROM ONE OR BOTH OF THESE 
GROUPS. 
 
8.  PERU GIVES NO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION TO THE PLO, BUT 
THE PLO HAS HAD AN INFORMATION OFFICE IN PERU SINCE 1979. 
PERU DOES NOT ACCORD OFFICIAL STATUS TO THE SALVADORAN 
FMLN. 
 
9.  PERU RECEIVED NO EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR TERRORISTS 
DURING 1987.  IN 1986, PERU DEPORTED TO ECUADOR AN 
ECUADOREAN CITIZEN ACCUSED BY HIS GOVERNMENT OF 
PARTICIPATING IN TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.  PERU DID NOT 
INITIATE ANY EXTRADITION REQUESTS FOR TERRORISM IN 
1987. 
 
10.  PERU HAS NOT ASSISTED, TRAINED, OR PROVIDED 
SANCTUARY TO FOREIGN TERRORISTS.

1.  (U) AT LEAST TWO UNIDENTIFIED GUNMEN JULY 14 
SHOT AND KILLED THE GOVERNOR OF CHINCHA PROVINCE, 
LOCATED IN LIMA\'S NEIGHBORING ICA DEPARTMENT. 
THE TERRORISTS SHOT HIM SIX TIMES IN FRONT OF 
HIS HOME AND IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS WIFE.  THE

PRINCIPAL, HAD EARLIER BEEN THREATENED AND 
GIVEN FIVE DAYS TO RESIGN FROM THE SCHOOL.

2.  (S/NF/NC/ORCON) SOURCE ONE IS A RETIRED NAVAL 
OFFICER, NOW LEGAL ADVISOR TO THE NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  IN FEBRUARY 1990 HE POLLED THE 
THREE MILITARY AND THE POLICE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES 
ON THEIR ESTIMATES OF SL STRENGTH AND DERIVED WHAT HE 
JUDGED TO BE AN APPROXIMATE AVERAGE OF THE FOUR 
SERVICE ESTIMATES.  SOURCE TWO IS AN 1991 MILITARY 
ESTIMATE REPORTED BY PICA (HDL-16640).  SOURCE THREE 
IS A JANUARY 1991 POLICE SUMMARY OF SL DATA SEIZED 
DURING RECENT RAIDS AGAINST SL SAFE HOUSES.  THE 
POLICE CLAIM THEIR NUMBERS REPRESENT SL\'S ESTIMATE OF 
ITS OWN STRENGTH.

6.  (C) WE ARE CURRENTLY COMPILING COMPARABLE DATA ON 
THE TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.  AS THE 
ANTI-TERRORISM POLICE TELL US, THIS IS MUCH HARDER 
DATA TO COME BY BECAUSE THE POLICE BEGAN WORK ON THE 
\"MRTA PROBLEM\" ONLY UNDER THE FUJIMORI GOVERNMENT. 
WE HOPE TO SEND ALONG SOME ESTIMATES OF MRTA CADRE 
STRENGTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

1.  (C)  SUMMARY.  AT A MARCH 21 PRESS 
CONFERENCE, EX-PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA CALLED FOR 
A NATIONAL FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI; HE ALSO RULED

OUT HIS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 1995.  GARCIA 
BLASTED ATTEMPTS BY THE FUJIMORI ADMINISTRATION 
TO REOPEN CORRUPTION CHARGES AGAINST HIM.  FEW 
IN LIMA BELIEVE THAT GARCIA WILL NOT RUN FOR 
PRESIDENT; IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW MANY ARE 
WILLING TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD INTO A NATIONAL 
ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT.  END SUMMARY. 
REOPENING THE GARCIA CORRUPTION CASE 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  (U)  THE CATALYST FOR GARCIA\'S PRESS 
CONFERENCE WAS THE GOP\'S PUBLISHING OF A SUPREME 
DECREE AUTHORIZING THE SOLICITOR GENERAL TO 
REOPEN THE \"ILLICIT ENRICHMENT\" CHARGES AGAINST 
GARCIA.  GARCIA\'S LAWYERS IMMEDIATELY HAD A 
LOW-LEVEL JUDGE ISSUE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST 
REOPENING THE CASE ON THE GROUNDS OF DOUBLE 
JEOPARDY.  GARCIA TOLD THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT 
THE SUPREME DECREE WAS A \"JUDICIAL MONSTROSITY\" 
AND THAT IT WAS THE ANSWER BY THE FUJIMORI 
ADMINISTRATION TO GARCIA\'S CRITICISM OF GOP 
POLICIES.  GARCIA DECLARED IT WAS THE TIME TO 
BREAK THE INFORMAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND APRA AGAINST CRITICIZING THE 
ADMINISTRATION.  HE BLAMED FUJIMORI AND SOME OF 
HIS \"MILITARY ADVISORS\" FOR USING EVEN THE TAX 
OFFICE TO PERSECUTE HIM. 
 
GARCIA CALLS FOR A NATIONAL ANTI-FUJIMORI FRONT 
--------------------------------------------- --

PAGE 03        LIMA  04541  01 OF 02  261219Z 
4.  (U)  GARCIA DECLARED THAT FOR THE LAST 18 
MONTHS THE PERUVIAN PEOPLE HAD SUFFERED A PLAGUE 
OF \"VICIOUS CAPITALISM\" THAT HAD NOT BORN 
CONCRETE RESULTS.  HE CHARACTERIZED FUJIMORI\'S 
TRIP TO JAPAN AS A COMPLETE FAILURE SINCE THE 
PRESIDENT RETURNED WITH \"ONLY USDOLS 20 MILLION 
IN DONATIONS.\"  GARCIA CHARGED THAT BUSINESSMEN 
WHO THAT TRAVEL WITH FUJIMORI DO SO ONLY TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF MONEY TO BE MADE OFF OF ASSISTANCE 
CONTRACTS.  GARCIA ADDED THAT THE GULF BETWEEN 
FUJIMORI AND THE CONGRESS IS WIDENING AND THAT 
EVEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE CANNOT GET AN 
APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT. 
 
5.  (U)  REFERRING TO FAILURE OF MOTHERS FROM 
THE \"GLASS OF MILK\" PROGRAM TO SEE A GOP 
REPRESENTATIVE, GARCIA ASKED, \"WHAT DANGER DO 
THESE POOR PERUVIAN MOTHERS REPRESENT WHEN THEY 
ONLY ASK FOR BREAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN?\"  HE 
ALLEGED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS CUT OFF IN THE 
PALACE WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF A STRONG ORGANIZED 
PARTY.  THE OPPOSITION WAS COMPOSED OF A RIGHT 
WHOSE LEADER (MARIO VARGAS LLOSA) HAD LEFT THE 
COUNTRY, APRA WHICH HAD JUST LEFT OFFICE, AND A 
FRACTURED LEFT.  GARCIA STATED THAT THE ONLY WAY 
TO OPPOSE FUJIMORI WAS BY FORMING A UNITED FRONT 
FROM THESE ELEMENTS TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC 
REVITALIZATION AND PACIFICATION. 
 
\"I WILL NOT RUN FOR PRESIDENT\"

6.  (U)  GARCIA CLAIMED THAT AN IMPEDIMENT TO A 
SUCCESSFUL OPPOSITION TO FUJIMORI WAS THE 
CONFLICTING AMBITIONS OF POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES.  THE WAY TO SOLVE THIS 
\"CANDIDITITIS\" WAS FOR POLITICAL LEADERS TO 
RENOUNCE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.  TO SET THE 
EXAMPLE HE SAID, \"I RENOUNCE BEING A CANDIDATE 
FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC IN 1995 TO 
PAVE THE WAY FOR THE NATIONAL FRONT.\"

LAST MONTH HE PROCLAIMED THAT HE WAS NOT A 
CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE APRA

PARTY.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS HE GRACIOUSLY ACCEPTED 
THE JOB AFTER THE APRA CONVENTION INSISTED BY 
ACCLAMATION THAT HE AGREE TO ACCEPT THE HONOR. 
THE LIKELIHOOD OF HIS ORGANIZING A NATIONAL 
FRONT AGAINST FUJIMORI IS SLIM.  THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE ULTRA-LEFT PUM PARTY, A PARTY 
THAT SHARES THE SUBSTANCE OF MANY OF GARCIA\'S 
CRITICISMS AGAINST FUJIMORI, TOLD POLOFFS THAT 
\"HIS PARTY WOULD NEVER COOPERATE WITH APRA.\"  HE 
EXPLAINED THAT HE COULD DEAL WITH THE RIGHT 
BECAUSE HE KNEW THEIR IDEOLOGICAL POSITION, BUT 
COULD NOT COOPERATE WITH APRA BECAUSE THEY WERE 
SIMPLE OPPORTUNISTS.  THE OTHER PARTIES MAY BE 
PLAYING THE SAME SONG, BUT THEY ARE HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY TO ACCEPT ALAN GARCIA LEADING THE 
BAND.  QUAINTON

            LIFE ON LIMA\'S OUTER FRINGE 
 
1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2. SUMMARY:  VILLA EL SALVADOR, A SHANTY TOWN 
SUBURB OF LIMA, IS SYMBOLIC OF THE BATTLE 
BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SENDERO LUMINOSO 
AND THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE LOYALTIES OF A 
POVERTY-STRIKEN POPULATION.  BECAUSE OF ITS 
LIMITED PRESENCE AND RESOURCES, THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS DIFFICULTY RESPONDING TO THE SENDERO\'S 
SELECTIVE CAMPAIGN OF TERRORISM OR THE 
POPULATION\'S EXPECTATIONS.    END SUMMARY. 
 
SHINING EXAMPLE ON THE HILL: VILLA EL SALVADOR 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
3.  POLITICAL OFFICERS RECENTLY REVISITED VILLA 
EL SALVADOR, LIMA\'S MOST SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT 
\"PUEBLO JOVEN\" (PJ - LITERALLY YOUNG TOWN).  IT 
IS A FAVORITE STOP ON THE POVERTY TOURISM ROUTE 
IN PERU.  ONE OF THE LARGEST AND OLDEST 
\"SPONTANEOUS\" SETTLEMENTS THAT RING METROPOLITAN 
LIMA, \"VILLA\" IS WIDELY CONSIDERED THE 
PROTOTYPICAL SUCCESS STORY OF WHAT A SQUATTER 
INVASION CAN BECOME THROUGH COMMUNITY 
ORGANIZATION AND HARD WORK.  VILLA LIES IN 
LIMA\'S SOUTHERN CONE AND IS HOME TO ABOUT THREE 
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PERSONS.  FOUNDED 
TWENTY-ONE YEARS AGO, VILLA HAS GENERALLY MADE 
THE TRANSITION FROM A SQUATTERS SHANTY TOWN TO A 
POOR WORKING CLASS \"BEDROOM COMMUNITY\" WITH AN 
AIR OF SETTLED PERMANENCE:  MANY HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES ARE MADE OF BRICK OR CEMENT BLOCK; 
ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE 90 PERCENT OF THE 
TOWN\'S HOMES HAVE TELEVISION; THE MAIN STREET 
AND MANY SIDE STREETS ARE PAVED. 
 
4.  WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE DAILY STRUGGLE FOR 
EXISTENCE LIVED BY MOST INHABITANTS OF LIMA\'S 
SHANTY TOWNS, RESIDENTS OF VILLA EL SALVADOR ARE 
GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE WELL OFF.  THE 
COMMUNITY IS ORGANIZED BY SECTIONS, AND ELECTED 
DELEGATES TO THE UMBRELLA VILLA EL SALVADOR 
SELF-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION (\"CUAVES\") HAVE 
FOUGHT HARD, AND WITH SOME SUCCESS, TO OBTAIN 
ELECTRICITY, WATER, SEWAGE AND GARBAGE 
COLLECTION FOR MANY PARTS OF VILLA.  VILLA\'S 
HARD WORK AND SOLID ORGANIZATION (AND 
CONSIDERABLE INTERNATIONAL LARGESSE) EARNED IT 
AN OFFICIAL COMMUNITY CHARTER AND INTERNATIONAL 
RECOGNITION IN THE FORM OF A \"PRINCE OF 
ASTURIAS\" AWARD FROM SPAIN\'S CROWN PRINCE 
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. 
 
5.  HOWEVER, LIFE IN VILLA IS BY NO MEANS EASY. 
VILLA RESIDENTS MUST PAY A MINIMUM OF 0.50 SOLES 
(1.36 SOLES CURRENTLY EQUALS 1 U.S. DOLLAR) FOR 
THE CHEAPEST BUS TRANSPORTATION TO LIMA. 
PRINCIPAL WAGE EARNERS, WHO AVERAGE PERHAPS 10 
SOLES A DAY IN EARNINGS, SPEND AT LEAST 10 
PERCENT OF THAT ON TRANSPORTATION.  THE RANKING 
POLICE SERGEANT ON DUTY AT VILLA\'S ONLY POLICE 
STATION TOLD POLITICAL OFFICERS THAT ON HIS 
OFFICIAL SALARY OF 7 SOLES A DAY HE MUST PROVIDE 
SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF, HIS WIFE AND FOUR 
CHILDREN.  CLAIMING THAT HIS COLLEGE-AGE SON 
NEEDED THE EQUIVALENT OF 3 SOLES A DAY TO ATTEND 
THE UNIVERSITY, AND HIS PRINCIPAL LUNCHEON MEAL 
MIGHT COST TWO SOLES, HE SHRUGGED WHEN HE ASKED 
RHETORICALLY HOW HE WAS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE 
REST OF HIS FAMILY ON THE REMAINDER OF HIS LEGAL 
SALARY. 
 
6.  ACCORDING TO THE POLICE OFFICIAL, 
ABSENTEEISM IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF VILLA EL 
SALVADOR WAS RAMPANT BECAUSE FAMILIES IN THE 
TOWN WERE REQUIRED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN OUT TO 
WORK AT AN EARLY AGE RATHER THAN TO SCHOOL.  IN 
ANY EVENT, THE POLICE SERGEANT DISMISSED MOST OF 
THE TEACHERS IN THE LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS 
UNDER-QUALIFIED AND UNDER-MOTIVATED OUTSIDERS. 
MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE EQUALLY LIMITED. 
RESIDENTS DEPRECATED THE QUALITY OF MEDICAL CARE 
AVAILABLE TO THEM, NOTING THAT THE NEAREST 
HOSPITAL WAS NOT ONLY DISTANT, BUT NOT EVEN 
FULLY FUNCTIONING. 
 
7.  WITH UNCERTAINTY OVER THE VALUE OF THE 
NATIONAL CURRENCY, THE DOLLAR HAS BECOME THE 
PREFERRED MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE FOR TRANSACTIONS IN 
VILLA EL SALVADOR.  CITY OFFICIALS ESTIMATED 
THAT BUSINESSES OR HOUSES ON THE TOWN\'S MAIN 
STREET SOLD FOR 4,000-5,000 DOLLARS, WITH PRIME 
CORNER LOCATIONS GOING FOR AS MUCH AS 
TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.  ALL TRANSACTIONS 
ARE IN DOLLARS.  ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF PERU\'S 
MONEY SUPPLY IS IN DOLLARS. 
 
PROBLEMS IN CAMELOT: SENDERO WITHIN THE GATES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  SENDERO LUMINOSO IS TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE 
TOWN\'S GOVERNMENT.  THREE FACTORS SUPPOSEDLY 
MADE THE TOWN IMPENETRABLE TO THE SENDERO 
TERRORISTS:  THE LEADERSHIP\'S CLOSE TIES TO THE 
POPULATION, THEIR LINKS WITH TRADITIONAL PARTIES 
OF THE LEFT, THE TOWN\'S COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONAL 
STRUCTURE, AND ITS LEVEL OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT.  FOREIGN AID TO VILLA EL SALVADOR, 
AS A \"MODEL SLUM,\" WAS ALSO HELPFUL. 
 
9.  HOWEVER, VILLA\'S REPUTATION AS A REDOUBT 
AGAINST SENDERO WAS LITERALLY EXPLODED WITH THE 
ASSASSINATION OF VICE-MAYOR MARIA ELENA MOYANO 
ON FEBRUARY 15.  NEXT, VILLA\'S CITY HALL AND 
POLICE STATION WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY DESTROYED 
BY A SENDERO LUMINOSO CAR BOMB ON APRIL 8, 
1992.  ALSO DAMAGED IN THE ATTACK WERE NEARBY 
BUILDINGS INCLUDING A COMPLEX HOUSING A SCHOOL 
AND VILLA\'S COMMUNITY RADIO AND TELEVISION 
STATION.  IN ADDITION, IN 1992 AN SL-ASSOCIATED 
SLATE ALSO LEGITIMATELY WON AN ELECTION IN THE 
MICRO-INDUSTRIAL PARK TO REPRESENT THE PARK IN 
VILLA\'S GOVERNMENT.  PERUVIAN SENDERO EXPERT 
CARLOS TAPIA SUBSEQUENTLY DESCRIBED VILLA EL 
SALVADOR AS A SHINY APPLE THAT CUT OPEN REVEALED 
ITSELF TO HAVE BEEN INFESTED WITH SENDERO WORMS. 
 
POLICE RARELY VENTURE INTO THE CITY 
----------------------------------- 
 
10.  POLITICAL OFFICERS VISITED THE SHELL OF THE 
STILL FUNCTIONING POLICE STATION.  THERE ARE 
SOME 70 POLICEMEN WORKING IN THREE SHIFTS FOR 
THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.  ACCORDING TO THE SENIOR 
POLICE SERGEANT INTERVIEWED, POLICE ONLY VENTURE 
OUT OF THE STATION IN PAIRS, HAVE NO VEHICLES 
(THEIR PATROL CARS WERE DESTROYED BY THE CAR 
BOMB), AND HAVE NO TELEPHONE.  THE POLICE 
OFFICIAL REPORTED THAT IT COULD TAKE UP TO AN 
HOUR FOR ANY REINFORCEMENTS TO ARRIVE ONCE THEY 
HAD BEEN REQUESTED USING THE ONE RADIO LINK 
AVAILABLE AT THE STATION.  SINCE AT LEAST A 
DOZEN POLICE GUARD THE MUNICIPAL CENTER AT ALL 
TIMES, AT BEST ONE OR TWO PATROLS ARE AVAILABLE 
FOR RESPONDING ON FOOT TO ASSISTANCE CALLS FROM 
THE COMMUNITY AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  ALTHOUGH THERE 
ARE SCHOOLS WITHIN SIGHT OF THE POLICE 
HEADQUARTERS, THE OFFICIAL INDICATED THAT NO 
COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO STUDENTS WAS ACTIVE OR 
CONTEMPLATED. 
 
11.  THE POLICE IN VILLA EL SALVADOR HAVE LITTLE 
EXPECTATION OF REINFORCEMENTS FROM LIMA IN THE 
EVENT OF TROUBLE, AND AT LEAST ONE POLICEMAN 
ADMITTED TO A MODUS VIVENDI WITH SENDERO.  THE 
OFFICER TOLD POLOFFS THAT HE LIVED IN VILLA WITH 
HIS FAMILY -- SENDERO KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW 
THEM.  HE EXPLAINED THAT WHILE HE OFTEN HAD 
FRANK DISCUSSIONS WITH \"THEM\" ABOUT CURRENT 
EVENTS, HE AVOIDED PHILOSOPHICAL DEBATES AND 
SAID BOTH SIDES \"KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THINGS\" 
BETWEEN THEM. 
 
VILLA\'S LEADERS STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL 
------------------------------------- 
 
12.  MICHEL AZCUETA, FOR TWENTY YEARS THE MAYOR 
OF VILLA EL SALVADOR, ESTIMATED THAT IN THE AREA 
OF VILLA EL SALVADOR PROPER AND THE ADJOINING 
SHANTY TOWN, THE SENDERO LUMINOSO HAS BEEN ABLE 
TO ESTABLISH A MAJOR PRESENCE WITH PERHAPS 7-10 
ACTIVIST MEMBERS AND APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY 
ACTIVE SYMPATHIZERS IN THE COMMUNITY. 
 
FUJIMORI REMAINS POPULAR 
------------------------ 
 
13.  AZCUETA, WHO WAS ELECTED IN 1989 ON AN 
OPPOSITION SLATE AS A LIMA CITY COUNCILMAN, 
ACKNOWLEDGED PERUVIAN PRESIDENT FUJIMORI 
RETAINED HIS POPULARITY WITH THE RESIDENTS OF 
THIS OUTLYING COMMUNITY.  FUJIMORI\'S PRINCIPAL 
APPEAL, IN AZCUETA\'S VIEW, WAS HIS CAREFULLY 
CULTIVATED IMAGE AS A \"NON-POLITICIAN.\"  THE 
INHABITANTS OF HIS TOWN, REMARKED AZCUETA, WERE 
FED UP WITH POLITICIANS AND TRADITIONAL POLITICS 
SINCE THE COUNTRY\'S POLITICAL STRUCTURES AND 
PROCESSES HAD PRODUCED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
CONCRETE BENEFITS FOR THEM. 
 
UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL AND MAYORAL ELECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
14.  AZCUETA DEMURRED WHEN ASKED IF HE PLANNED 
TO BE A CANDIDATE IN THE UPCOMING CONSTITUTIONAL 
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS.  HE WAS UNCERTAIN WHO MIGHT 
RUN, NOTING THAT A LIKELY TACTIC OF THE SENDERO 
LUMINOSO GUERRILLAS WOULD BE TO ENGAGE IN 
INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ASSASSINATION 
AGAINST LOCAL CANDIDATES IN OUTLYING AREAS WHILE 
USING CAR BOMBINGS IN LIMA FOR THEIR PROPAGANDA 
VALUE.  ATTACKS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS, IN ADDITION 
TO DEMONSTRATING THE GOVERNMENT\'S INABILITY TO 
PROVIDE LOCAL CANDIDATES AND OFFICIALS WITH 
PROTECTION WOULD HAVE SEVERAL EFFECTS, IN 
AZCUETA\'S VIEW.  IN ADDITION TO ADVANCING THE 
SENDERO STRATEGY OF SHOWING THE GOVERNMENT 
IMPOTENCE, RANDOM ASSASSINATIONS WOULD LIKELY 
DETER THE BEST CANDIDATES FROM SEEKING OFFICE. 
THE RESULT, IN AZCUETA\'S VIEW, WOULD BE 
SECOND-BEST OR MEDIOCRE CANDIDATES TAKING THEIR 
PLACE.  SUCH A GROUP OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS UNABLE 
TO RESOLVE PERU\'S PROBLEMS, OR EXACERBATE THEM, 
WOULD FIT INTO THE SENDERO\'S STRATEGY, CONCLUDED 
AZCUETA. 
 
15. COMMENT:  VILLA EL SALVADOR ILLUSTRATES THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S DIFFICULTIES IN FIGHTING SENDERO 
LUMINOSO.  THE RELATIVE PROSPERITY THAT BRINGS 
TELEVISION ALSO BRINGS THE RISING EXPECTATIONS 
OF GOOD LIFE OF THE \"TELENOVELAS\" DEPICTED ON 
THE SOAP OPERAS AND DEMANDS FOR SERVICES THE 
GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROVIDE. 
 
16.  THE PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY A LIMITED 
PRESENCE IN A TOWN WHICH IS PART OF THE 
CAPITAL\'S METROPOLITAN AREA, PERHAPS 45 MINUTES 
FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  WHAT CONTACT THE 
AVERAGE RESIDENT OF VILLA EL SALVADOR HAS WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVE, I.E., 
THE TAX COLLECTOR COLLECTING MONEY OR THE 
POLICEMAN DEMANDING A BRIBE.  SENDERO IS 
CAPITALIZING ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S LIMITED 
PRESENCE BY PICKING AND CHOOSING TARGETS OF 
OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER ISOLATE THE GOVERNMENT 
FROM THE PEOPLE.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
SELF-HELP AND LOCAL INITIATIVE OF THE RESIDENTS 
OF VILLA EL SALVADOR SHOW WHAT CAN BE DONE 
WITHOUT, OR DESPITE, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. 
SENDERO IN VILLA EL SALVADOR IS FIGHTING TWO 
ENEMIES: LOCAL LEADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT. 
SENDERO HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE HEADWAY IN RECENT 
YEARS. 
 
17.  EVEN THOUGH THE ARREST OF SENDERO LUMINOSO 
FOUNDER AND LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN ON SEPTEMBER 
12 MAY TEMPORARILY DISRUPT THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
OPERATIONS, THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS--POVERTY, 
ECONOMIC STAGNATION, RACISM, UNRESPONSIVE 
GOVERNMENT--UPON WHICH IT HAS FED REMAIN.  AND 
EVEN IF VILLA EL SALVADOR TURNS THE CORNER, TE 
NEXT WAVE OF POTENTIAL SYMPATHIZERS, NOW SITTING 
ON THE SAND HILLS ABOVE THE TOWN IN CARDBOARD 
HOUSES, WILL ALREADY BE DEMANDING ITS SHARE OF 
THE ECONOMIC PIE.

TAGS:       PGOV, PHUM, OAS PE 
SUBJECT:    THE CCD, POVERTY AND THE SENDERO 
 
1. (U)  SUMMARY:  IN AN INITIAL STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS OF DEPARTMENTAL VOTING PATTERNS, 
POVERTY LEVELS PROVED A MUCH BETTER PREDICTOR OF 
VOTING TURNOUT IN THE NOVEMBER 22 CCD ELECTIONS 
THAN DID THE PRESENCE OF THE SENDERO LUMINOSO 
TERRORIST GROUP.  THE IMPACT ON ABSTENTIONISM OF 
RELATIVE POVERTY WAS ALSO MUCH GREATER THAN ITS 
IMPACT ON SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT PARTY. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U)  SLIGHTLY LESS THAN ONE WEEK AFTER THE 
OAS RENDERED ITS VERDICT AND EIGHTEEN DAYS LATER 
THAN PERU\'S NATIONAL ELECTION BOARD PROMISED, 
THE OFFICIAL RESULTS OF THE NOVEMBER 22 
CONSTITUENT CONGRESS ELECTIONS WERE ANNOUNCED. 
FOLLOWING IS A FIRST ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF 
POVERTY AND THE PRESENCE OF THE SENDERO LUMINOSO 
ON VOTING TURNOUT AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
IN THE CONSTITUENT CONGRESS (CCD) ELECTIONS. 
 
POVERTY AND THE VOTE 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C)  BASED UPON DEPARTMENTAL VOTING FIGURES, 
THE IMPACT OF POVERTY, ABSENTEEISM AND SUPPORT 
FOR THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN ANALYZED USING 
SIMPLE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TECHNIQUES FOR 
BIVARIATE DISTRIBUTIONS. 
 
4. (C)  IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT POVERTY AND 
POLITICAL VIEWS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED  IN THE 
CASE OF PERU, POVERTY APPEARS TO HAVE A MUCH 
GREATER IMPACT ON THE DECISION TO VOTE THAN IT 
DOES ON WHICH CANDIDATE OR PARTY A VOTER CHOSES. 
 
5. (C)  TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT OF POVERTY, THE 
VOTE IN DEPARTMENTS WITHIN WHICH 48 OF PERU\'S 50 
MOST IMPOVERISHED PROVINCES (ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT 
TO COUNTIES IN THE UNITED STATES) WAS COMPARED 
TO THE REST OF PERU.  WHEN ABSENTEEISM AND 
SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT\'S \"NEW 
MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90\" PARTY WERE COMPARED IN THE 
MOST POOR AND LEAST POOR DEPARTMENTS, THE IMPACT 
ON ABSTENTEEISM WAS MARKED.  APPROXIMATELY 29.4 
PERCENT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN NON-VOTING RATES 
CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR STATISTICALLY BY THE 
POVERTY FACTOR.  IN CONTRAST, ONLY 10.8 PERCENT 
OF THE DIFFERENCE IN SUPPORT FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S \"NEW MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90\" ALLIANCE 
CAN BE EXPLAINED BY ECONOMIC IMPROVERISHMENT. 
 
6. (C)  WHY DID RELATIVE POVERTY APPEAR TO HAVE 
SUCH AN IMPACT ON THE VOTE?  ALTHOUGH VOTING IS 
COMPULSORY IN PERU, CHANGING ONE\'S VOTING 
LOCATION IS A DIFFICULT AND TIME-CONSUMING 
PROCESS.  THE OPTION OPEN TO PERUVIANS IS TO NOT 
VOTE AND EITHER PAY, OR HOPE TO EVADE THE 12 
DOLLAR FINE FOR NON-VOTING.  FOR THE POOR, WHO 
HAVE LITTLE CONTACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN ANY 
EVENT, THE RISK OF THE FINE EVER BEING COLLECTED 
IS MINIMAL.  CONSTITUTIONS ARE SEE AS ABSTRACT 
DOCUMENTS WITH LITTLE IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE. 
THUS, IN THE NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION, IT APPEARS 
THAT IRRELEVANCE COMBINED WITH ECONOMIC 
NECESSITY COMBINED TO REDUCE VOTER TURNOUT IN 
PERU\'S POOREST AREAS. 
 
THE SENDERO LUMINOSO AND THE VOTE 
--------------------------------- 
 
7. (C)  MANY COMMENTATORS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION CONGRATULATED PERUVIANS FOR 
DEFYING SENDERO LUMINOSO (SL) THREATS AND 
CASTING THEIR BALLOTS.  IN 1992, APPROXIMATELY 
25 PERCENT OF THE COUNTRY WAS DECLARED TO BE IN 
A STATE EMERGENCY.  JUST UNDER HALF OF PERU\'S 
POPULATION (47.45 PERCENT) LIVED IN THESE 
EMERGENCY ZONES.  TWO WAYS TO MEASURE THE IMPACT 
OF TERRORISM ON THE VOTE WOULD BE TO LOOK AT 
PERCENTAGES OF NON-VOTERS (THE FEAR FACTOR), OR 
LEVELS OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT (REJECTION 
OF GUERRILLAS FACTOR) IN EMERGENCY ZONES VERSUS 
AREAS DECLARED FREE OF SUBSTANTIAL GUERRILLA 
INFLUENCE. 
 
8. (C)  WHEN NON-VOTING RATES IN DEPARTMENTS ALL 
OR PART OF WHICH WERE DECLARED \"EMERGENCY ZONES\" 
AS OF NOVEMBER 3 WERE COMPARED WITH DEPARTMENTS 
WITHOUT EMERGENCY ZONES, ONLY 9.1 PERCENT OF THE 
DIFFERENCE COULD BE STATISTICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR. 
 
9. (C)  WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IN VOTING RATES IN 
DEPARTMENTS WHERE THERE WERE EMERGENCY ZONES IN 
NOVEMBER WERE COMPARED TO THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN 
ON THE LIST IN FEBRUARY, TEN MONTHS EARLIER, BUT 
REMOVED IN NOVEMBER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNFICANT 
DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED. 
 
GUERRILLAS AND SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
10. (C)  IF THE ACT OF VOTING IS TAKEN AS A 
HIGHLY SYMBOLIC STATEMENT OF OPPOSITION TO 
TERRORISM, THIS SHOULD ALSO TRANSLATE INTO SOME 
DEGREE OF SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. 
PARTICULARLY AFTER THE CAPTURE OF SL FOUNDER AND 
LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN AND MUCH OF THE SL\'S TOP 
LEADERSHIP, MANY EXPECTED THE GOVERNMENT TO HAVE 
RECEIVED A SURGE OF SUPPORT.  YET WHEN THE 
PERCENTAGE OF THE GOVERNMENT VOTE (SUPPORT FOR 
THE \"NEW MAJORITY/CAMBIO 90\" ALLIANCE) IN 
DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT ANY EMERGENCY ZONE IS 
COMPARED SIMILAR VOTES IN DEPARTMENTS WITHOUT 
EMERGENCY ZONES, ONLY 6.2 PERCENT OF THE 
DIFFERENCE CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR STATISTICALLY BY 
THIS VARIABLE.  THE DIFFERENCE ESSENTIALLY 
DISAPPEARS WHEN THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAD 
EMERGENCY ZONES IN FEBRUARY ARE COMPARED TO THE 
REST OF PERU.  APPARENTLY, WHAT HAROLD WILSON 
SAID ABOUT POLITICS ALSO APPLIES TO PERUVIAN 
VOTERS\' MEMORIES.  THIS FINDING TALLIES WITH THE 
RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUP ANALYSES WHICH A 
GOVERNMENT POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM PERFORMED. 
THIS FIRM FOUND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WERE 
INCREASINGLY THE FOCUS OF VOTER\'S ATTENTION WITH 
THE PRESUMED RESOLUTION OF THE GUERRILLA PROBLEM 
FOLLOWING GUZMAN\'S CAPTURE.

12. (C) COMMENT:  BASED UPON A DEPARTMENTAL 
LEVEL ANALYSIS OF VOTING PATTERNS, POVERTY 
APPEARS TO HAVE HAD A MUCH STRONGER IMPACT ON 
THE VOTING DECISION IN THE CCD ELECTIONS THAN 
THE SENDERO.  THE TERRORIST GROUP\'S RELATIVE 
LACK OF IMPACT ON THE VOTING MAY BE DUE IN PART 
TO A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY.  IT WAS WIDELY 
BELIEVED IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTIONS THAT THE 
SL CONSIDERED THE CCD ELECTIONS ESSENTIALLY 
UNIMPORTANT.  WHILE THE SL CONDUCTED A TERROR 
BOMBING CAMPAIGN IN LIMA IN THE WEEK BEFORE THE 
ELECTION, THE ATTACKS HAD TAPERED OFF SEVERAL 
DAYS BEFORE THE VOTING.  IF THE SL HAD HOPED TO 
HAVE AN IMPACT IN NOVEMBER WITH THIS LAST MINUTE 
EFFORT, IT APPARENTLY FAILED.  IF THE GOVERNMENT 
HAD HOPED TO RECEIVE A \"GRATITUDE VOTE\" FROM A 
GRATEFUL POPULATION, IT TOO WAS DISAPPOINTED. 
WHILE THE GOVERNMENT DID GAIN A MAJORITY IN THE 
CCD, THE RESULTS REFLECT MOSTLY THEIR BETTER 
ORGANIZATION AND FULLER COFFERS.  CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S MAJORITY WAS ALSO HIGH 
LEVELS OF OPPOSITION DISORGANIZATION AND POOR 
TACTICAL DECISIONS BY APRA AND ACCION POPULAR TO 
BOYCOTT THE ELECTION. 
 
13. (C)   THE STUDY OF GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS 
IN PERU IS CONSIDERED A SUB-FIELD OF LEGAL 
STUDIES AND THIS TRADITIONAL, NON-QUANTATIVE 
BENT IS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PERUVIAN 
SOCIAL INVESTIGATORS.  SINCE EMERGENCY ZONES DO 
NOT, IN MOST CASES, CORRESPOND EXACTLY WITH 
POLITICAL BOUNDARIES, A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS 
COMPARING PRECINCT TALLIES WITH EMERGENCY ZONES 
AND POVERTY WILL BE NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE 
EXACT NATURE AND IMPACT OF THESE VARIABLES. 
 
14. (C)  SUCH A DETAILED, QUANTATIVE ANALYSIS 
MAY BE A LONG-TIME COMING.  MOST OF THE 
COMMENTARY THUS FAR PRODUCED BY PERUVIAN 
POLITICIANS, INTELLECTUALS AND ACADEMICIANS 
FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER 22 ELECTION HAS BEEN 
IMPRESSIONISTIC, HISTORICAL AND SUBJECTIVE.  ONE 
LONG-TIME STUDENT OF THE IMPACT OF GUERRILLAS 
AND VOTING INSISTED TO POLOFFS DECEMBER 31 THAT 
THE SL OBVIOUSLY HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE 
NOVEMBER 22 VOTE.  UNFORTUNATELY, SHE HAD NO 
DATA OR ANALYSIS TO BACK UP HER GUT FEELING.

APPEARS TO BE LETTING THE OUTSIDE WORLD KNOW 
ABOUT THE IMPROVED SITUATION, AND THUS IMPROVING 
TOURISM AND REGAINING INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
AND COOPERATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) AMBASSADOR AND MRS. ADAMS, ACCOMPANIED 
BY AID DEPUTY COUNTRY DIRECTOR, AID 
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE OFFICER, AND POLOFF 
TRAVELED NOVEMBER 30-DECEMBER 1 TO AYACUCHO, A 
SMALL RUSTIC TOWN IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL ANDES 
(POPULATION OF 35,000, WITH A TOTAL REGIONAL 
POPULATION OF 140,000).  AYACUCHO HAS A HEAVY 
INDIAN INFLUENCE.  QUECHUA IS SPOKEN OR 
UNDERSTOOD BY ROUGHLY HALF THE POPULATION AND 
DISTINCTIVE NATIVE DRESS IS MUCH IN EVIDENCE. 
THE TOWN STILL IS HEAVILY COLONIAL IN 
ARCHITECTURE, WITH MANY BUILDINGS DATING FROM 
THE 18TH CENTURY.  NO POLITICAL POSTERS OR 
SLOGANS OF ANY KIND WERE EVIDENT, EXCEPT FOR 
OCCASIONAL SPRAY PAINT GRAFFITI WITH THE NAME OF 
A LOCAL APRA POLITICIAN.  THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL 
EVIDENCE THAT AYACUCHO HAD ONCE BEEN A DANGEROUS 
PLACE, OR THAT ITS VICINITY HAD BEEN THE SCENE 
OF FREQUENT SENDERO ATTACKS AND GOVERNMENT 
CLASHES.  DESPITE THE SENSE IN AYACUCHO THAT ONE 
IS IN A REMOTE LOCATION, ACCESS TO LIMA IS EASY 
SINCE ITS AIRPORT IS SERVED BY PERU\'S FOUR 
DOMESTIC AIR CARRIERS. 
 
----------------- 
DETAINEE REGISTRY 
----------------- 
 
3.  (U) THE AMBASSADOR\'S FIRST STOPS IN AYACUCHO 
WERE TO INAUGURATE THE AID-FUNDED DETAINEE 
REGISTRY COMPUTERS AT THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS 
AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC MINISTRY OFFICE.  ATTORNEY 
GENERAL BLANCA NELIDA COLAN PARTICIPATED IN THE 
CEREMONY AT THE PUBLIC MINISTRY AND HOSTED A 
RECEPTION AFTERWARDS.  DETAINEE REGISTRY CENTERS 
ENABLE CITIZENS TO LOCATE INDIVIDUALS DETAINED 
ON TERRORISM AND TREASON CHARGES BY POLICE OR 
MILITARY (IN EMERGENCY ZONES) AUTHORITIES ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY.  BY NEXT SEPTEMBER, 13 SUCH 
CENTERS SHOULD BE OPERATIONAL THROUGHOUT PERU. 
AYACUCHO IS THE THIRD SUCH CENTER OPENED SINCE 
LAST FEBRUARY.  (LIMA AND TARAPOTO WERE THE 
FIRST TWO, HUANUCO SHOULD BE OPENED IN JANUARY.) 
 
------- 
ORPHANS 
------- 
 
4.  (U) US-TEAM THEN VISITED THE USAID-SUPPORTED 
ANDRES VIVANCO ORPHANAGE RUN BY SANTA ANA NUNS 
FOR CHILDREN UP TO AGE 18, INCLUDING NEWBORNS. 
FOUR NUNS ASSISTED BY LAY WORKERS TAKE CARE OF 
APPROXIMATELY 150 CHILDREN, ALMOST ALL OF WHOM 
LOST THEIR PARENTS DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS OF 
SENDERO-MILITARY CONFLICT IN THE AREA.  AN 
ADDITIONAL 180 CHILDREN ATTEND DAY-TIME PROGRAMS 
AT THE FACILITY.  (EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE BY 
LOCAL SALESIAN FATHERS TO ORGANIZE AN ORPHANAGE 
FOR OLDER CHILDREN.)  EARLIER THIS YEAR, UNDER A 
CONGRESSIONAL EARMARK FOR DISPLACED CHILDREN AND 
ORPHANS, AID PROVIDED USD 200,000 FOR THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING WORKSHOPS 
AND FOR REPAIRS TO THE ORPHANAGE\'S DECREPIT 
WATER SYSTEM. 
 
5.  (U) WHILE IN AYACUCHO, AMBASSADOR WAS 
PRESENTED WITH A LETTER FROM THE AYACUCHO 
ASSOCIATION OF RELATIVES OF VICTIMS OF TERRORISM 
(AFAVIT) SEEKING ASSISTANCE.  THIS ORGANIZATION 
TAKES CARE OF A FURTHER 100 CHILDREN BETWEEN THE 
AGES OF THREE AND FIFTEEN.  THESE CHILDREN ARE 
NOT TOTALLY DESTITUTE, UNLIKE THOSE TAKEN CARE 
OF AT ANDRES VIVANCO, BUT LIVE IN DIRE ECONOMIC 
CIRCUMSTANCES WITH RELATIVES OR A SURVIVING 
PARENT.  THIS ORGANIZATION IS HEADED BY A 
UNIVERSITY STUDENT WHOSE PARENTS, WHO WERE 
TEACHERS, WERE KILLED BY SENDERO LUMINOSO IN 
1989.  HE EXPLAINED TO POLOFF THAT SIMILAR 
ORGANIZATIONS EXIST IN LIMA AND HUANTA (IN 
NORTHERN AYACUCHO DEPARTMENT). 
 
--------------------- 
NEW UNIVERSITY RECTOR 
--------------------- 
 
6.  (U) AMBASSADOR, JOINED BY AID DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR AND POLOFF, MET WITH EDUARDO GONZALEZ, 
THE NEW RECTOR OF SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGA 
UNIVERSITY IN AYACUCHO, WHO HAD ASSUMED HIS 
POSITION ONLY FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE.  GONZALEZ 
REPLACED PEDRO VILLENA, WHO WAS NAMED MINISTER 
OF EDUCATION IN OCTOBER (REF A). 
 
7.  (U) THE RECTOR EXPLAINED THAT SAN CRISTOBAL 
DE HUAMANGA WAS THE SECOND OLDEST UNIVERSITY IN 
PERU, HAVING BEEN FOUNDED IN 1677.  IT CURRENTLY 
HAS TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND EMPLOYS 400 
PROFESSORS, WHO TEACH IN TEN DIFFERENT 
FACULTIES.  HE CONTRASTED THE CURRENT STUDENT 
ENROLLMENT WITH THE PERIOD OF VIOLENCE DURING 
THE EIGHTIES, WHEN STUDENT ENROLLMENT 
APPROXIMATED ONLY 3,500.  SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE 
STUDENTS COME FROM RURAL AREAS SURROUNDING 
AYACUCHO.  THE EDUCATION FACULTY HAS THE LARGEST 
ENROLLMENT. 
 
8.  (U) GONZALEZ MENTIONED PAST PROFESSOR 
EXCHANGES BETWEEN SAN CRISTOBAL DE HUAMANGA AND 
AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES.  ALL SUCH EXCHANGES ENDED 
DUE TO THE VIOLENCE THAT BEGAN IN THE EARLY 
1980\'S.  THE RECTOR IS SENDING THE EMBASSY A 
LETTER WITH PROPOSALS FOR RESURRECTING SOME OF 
THESE PROGRAMS WITH U.S. UNIVERSITIES.  HE WAS 
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE UNIVERSITY OF 
TEXAS. 
 
9.  (U) THE RECTOR ADDED THAT AMERICAN 
ARCHAELOGIST WILLIAM ISBELL, WHO HAD DIRECTED 
EXCAVATIONS AT THE NEARBY PRE-INCA WARI EMPIRE 
RUINS, WOULD RETURN TO AYACUCHO NEXT MONTH AFTER 
A FOUR YEAR ABSENCE TO CHECK ON THE SECURITY 
SITUATION AND LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
BRINGING UP TO FIFTEEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FROM 
THE U.S. TO WORK ON THE SITE. 
 
10.  (U) AS FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMIC SITUATION, 
THE RECTOR EXPLAINED THAT THE AYACUCHO ECONOMY 
RELIES PRIMARILY ON TEXTILES FOR EXPORT.  HE 
ADDED THAT EASTER WEEK IS A BIG TOURIST EVENT IN 
AYACUCHO AND ATTRACTED APPROXIMATELY SIX 
THOUSAND TOURISTS LAST YEAR, MOST OF WHOM CAME 
FROM WITHIN PERU.  LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE NOW 
HOPING FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND EASTER WEEK VISITORS 
NEXT APRIL.  TOURISM DURING THE REST OF YEAR IS 
STILL LIMITED, BUT WORD IS GETTING OUT THAT THE 
SITUATION HAS IMPROVED, AND SMALL GROUPS OF 
FOREIGN TOURISTS HAVE VISITED AYACUCHO DURING 
THE PAST YEAR. 
 
------------------- 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 
------------------- 
 
11.  (C) FOUR UNIVERSITY STUDENT LEADERS ALSO 
PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING WITH THE RECTOR. 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE STUDENT FEDERATION 
EXPRESSED CYNICISM REGARDING PERU\'S PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATES, AND EXPLAINED THAT HE DID NOT 
SUPPORT ANY OF THEM BECAUSE NONE OF THEM 
APPEARED TO BE SINCERELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE IN AYACUCHO.  HE EXPLAINED 
THAT THE MAJOR CONCERN OF STUDENTS IN AYACUCHO 
WAS THE LACK OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES AFTER 
GRADUATION.  CURRENTLY, THE TWO MAIN SOURCES OF 
JOBS IN AYACUCHO WERE IN THE ARTISAN TRADE OR IN 
THE GOVERNMENT SECTOR AS TEACHERS OR LAWYERS. 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE UNITED STATES, HE PAUSED 
BEFORE SIMPLY STATING THAT HE VIEWED IT AS \"AN 
ADVANCED COUNTRY.\" 
 
--------------------- 
SHINING PATH\'S SHADOW 
--------------------- 
 
12.  (C) SEVERAL AYACUCHO RESIDENTS NOTED TO 
POLOFF THAT SENDERO WAS NO LONGER ACTIVE THERE. 
HOWEVER, A MILITARY OFFICIAL EXPLAINED THAT 
THERE MIGHT STILL BE SENDERO SUPPORTERS IN 
AYACUCHO, BUT THEY ARE NOT OUT IN THE OPEN AND 
HAVE NOT BEEN ENGAGING IN VIOLENT ACTS.  SENDERO 
FOUNDER PROFESSOR ABIMAEL GUZMAN IS STILL 
REMEMBERED IN AYACUCHO.  RECTOR ENRIQUE 
GONZALEZ, A FORMER STUDENT OF GUZMAN\'S, RECALLED 
THAT THE SENDERO LEADER WAS NOT A TALKATIVE 
TYPE, WHICH HE JOKINGLY REFERRED TO AS THE TYPE 
TO BE AFRAID OF.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY 
TUNA (TROUBADOUR-TYPE SINGING GROUP) INDICATED 
TO POLOFF THAT HE, TOO, STUDIED UNDER GUZMAN, 
WHO HE REMEMBERED AS A VERY GOOD PROFESSOR.  HE 
ADDED THAT GUZMAN WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF THE 
TUNA GROUP, AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED IT WHEN THE 
GROUP PERFORMED THE THEME FROM \"ZORBA THE 
GREEK,\" WHICH GUZMAN DANCED TO ON A VIDEO 
CAPTURED BY SECURITY FORCES IN 1991. 
 
13.  (C) A FORMER MAYOR SAID THAT FORMER SENDERO 
LEADER ABIMAEL GUZMAN\'S WIFE AUGUSTA LA TORRE, 
WHO DIED IN 1989, STILL HAD RELATIVES IN 
AYACUCHO.  (A RECENTLY CAPTURED SENDERO LEADER 
HAS INFORMED POLICE THAT GUZMAN ACTUALLY HAD HIS 
WIFE KILLED.)  A LOCAL JOURNALIST NOTED THAT LA 
TORRE\'S PARENTS NOW LIVE IN SWEDEN.  GUZMAN WAS 
ORIGINALLY FROM AREQUIPA AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY 
BLOOD RELATIVES IN AYACUCHO. 
 
14.  (C) WITH THE CASE OF FORMER SENDERO HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACTIVIST GUADALUPE CCALLACUNTO, WHO 
DISAPPEARED IN AYACUCHO IN 1990, SHORTLY 
APPEARING BEFORE THE INTER-AMERICAN HUMAN RIGHTS 
COMMISSION, POLOFF ASKED SEVERAL AYACUCHO 
RESIDENTS IF THEY REMEMBERED HER CASE.  A PUBLIC 
MINISTRY EMPLOYEE AND A UNIVERSITY STUDENT BOTH 
REMEMBERED HER AND SAID SHE WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE 
BEEN KILLED BY THE MILITARY. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15.  (C) A KEY CONCERN OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND 
RESIDENTS APPEARS TO BE LETTING THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD KNOW ABOUT THE IMPROVED SECURITY SITUATION 
IN AYACUCHO, AND THUS IMPROVING TOURISM AND 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION EFFORTS 
IN THE AREA.  WITH LATENT SUPPORT FOR SENDERO IN 
AYACUCHO STILL NOT COMPLETELY ERADICATED, THE 
PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FOCUSING HEAVILY ON 
LOCAL NEEDS AND GRIEVANCES.  TO DO OTHERWISE 
WOULD ENHANCE FRUSTRATION WITH THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT IN LIMA, WHICH WAS A KEY FACTOR IN 
SENDERO\'S INITIAL GROWTH.

SUBJECT: SENDERO LUMINOSO LEADER \"FELICIANO\" CORNERED -- YET AGAIN 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY JAMES F. MACK, DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION, 
AMERICAN EMBASSY, LIMA.  REASON 1.5 (B,D). 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY:  A PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICER IN THE AYACUCHO 
REGION RECENTLY TOLD US THAT HIS UNIT BELIEVES OSCAR RAMIREZ DURAN 
(A.K.A. \"FELICIANO\"), THE MOST IMPORTANT SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING 
PATH - SL) LEADER OUTSIDE OF JAIL, IS STILL CORNERED WITH THIRTY TO 
FIFTY CADRES IN A BROKEN, WOODED REGION NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF 
THE MONTARO AND APURIMAC RIVERS.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT 
PERUVIAN OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR BELIEF THAT THE SL LEADER 
WAS TRAPPED  -- SOMEHOW IN THE PAST HE HAS ALWAYS MANAGED TO 
ESCAPE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C)  COLONEL DARWIN RENGIFO RIOS, SECOND IN COMMAND AT THE 
AYACUCHO MILITARY BASE, TOLD US JUNE 4 THAT THE PERUVIAN MILITARY 
HAD SUCCEEDED IN CORNERING SENDERO LUMINOSO (SL) LEADER \"FELICIANO\" 
WITH THIRTY TO FIFTY SHINING PATH CADRES IN THE TRIANGULAR REGION 
SOUTHWEST OF THE INTERSECTION OF THE APURIMAC AND MONTARO RIVERS. 
THE ROUGHLY 900 SQUARE KILOMETER AREA IS HEAVILY WOODED, LIGHLY 
POPULATED AND CHARACTERIZED BY EXTREMELY BROKEN TERRAIN.  THERE IS 
NO COCA CULTIVATION IN THE REGION; AS A RESULT, THE ARMY BELIEVES 
\"FELICIANO\'S\" GROUP IS UNABLE TO LIVE OFF WAR TAXES.  RENGIFO 
STATED THAT THE PERUVIAN MILITARY HAD LAUNCHED A NUMBER OF 
OPERATIONS INTO THE AREA IN RECENT MONTHS BUT HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN 
CAPTURING THE SL LEADER.  MILITARY FORCES RAIDED \"FELICIANO\'S\" CAMP 
SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS VACATED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND ONCE EVEN 
CAPTURED THE SL LEADER\'S BED.  THE MILITARY ALSO DESTROYED OVER TEN 
SEPARATE FARMING SITES, WHERE SHINING PATH HAD SOWN YUCA AND OTHER 
CROPS AS FOODSTUFFS. 
 
4.  (C)  THE COLONEL ASSERTED THAT AFTER YEARS OF SL ATROCITIES, 
VILLAGERS THROUGHOUT THE REGION ARE FIRMLY ON THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
SIDE AGAINST THE TERRORIST GROUP.  HE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE NOW 
OVER 120,000 RONDEROS (VILLAGE CIVIL DEFENSE MEMBERS) WITH OVER 
6,000 WEAPONS IN THE AYACUCHO MILITARY DISTRICT.  IF \"FELICIANO\" 
AND THE SENDERO CADRES ATTEMPT TO FLEE THEIR CURRENT HIDEOUT, THEY 
WILL BE QUICKLY SPOTTED IN THE TREELESS TERRAIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE 
AREA, RENGIFO CLAIMED.  HE ALSO SAID \"FELICIANO\" CANNOT HIDE OUT IN 
ANY OF THE VILLAGES IN THE REGION BECAUSE THE RONDEROS WOULD 
QUICKLY REPORT HIS PRESENCE.  THE MILITARY IS REPOPULATING VILLAGES 
WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED EARLIER DURING THE HEIGHT OF TERRORIST 
VIOLENCE IN ORDER TO FURTHER REDUCE \"FELICIANO\'S\" FREEDOM OF 
ACTION.  IN MID-JUNE, THERE ARE PLANS TO REPOPULATE TIRCOS, A 
VILLAGE DUE WEST OF SAN FRANCISCO IN HUANTA PROVINCE, RENGIFO SAID. 
 
5.  (C)  \"FELICIANO\" AND HIS GROUP FACE A DISMAL FUTURE, WITH FOOD 
RUNNING OUT AND NOWHERE TO OBTAIN SUPPLIES, ACCORDING TO RENGIFO. 
HE EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT THE GROUP WILL EITHER (1) MAKE A BREAK 
FOR IT AND EXPOSE ITSELF TO MILITARY ACTION, (2) BREAK UP AND 
DISPERSE, OR (3) SUFFER A VIOLENT INTERNAL CONFRONTATION IN WHICH 
SOME SL MEMBERS ARE KILLED.  \"I CAN\'T SAY THAT WE WILL CAPTURE 
\'FELICIANO\' TOMORROW, IN THE NEXT WEEK OR EVEN IN THE NEXT YEAR,\" 
HE SAID, \"BUT TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR SENDERO LUMINOSO HERE.\" 
 
6.  (C)  COMMENT:  PERUVIAN MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR 
BELIEF THAT SL LEADER \"FELICIANO\" HAS BEEN CORNERED MANY TIMES IN 
RECENT YEARS.  WE CANNOT CONFIRM, HOWEVER, THAT \"FELICIANO\" IS IN 
FACT IN THE TRIANGULAR REGION DESCRIBED BY REGIFO; LOCAL MEDIA 
REPORTS HAVE PLACED HIM IN CUSCO, LIMA, THE UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY 
AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN RECENT MONTHS.  DESPITE FREQUENT REPORTS OF 
HIS IMMINENT ARREST, \"FELICIANO\" HAS SO FAR ESCAPED THE ARMY\'S NET.

CHARISMA, ABILITY TO APPEAL TO VARIOUS AUDIENCES, INCLUDING 
PERU\'S INDIGENOUS AND POOREST COMMUNITIES, AND POSITIVE 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND ECONOMIC MESSAGE HAVE HELPED TO CATAPULT 
HIM INTO A RUN-OFF ELECTION WITH PRESIDENT FUJIMORI.  HIS 
NEGATIVES INCLUDE A HOT TEMPER, A TENDENCY TOWARD LECTURING, 
SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC CREDENTIALS, AND A REPUTATION 
FOR HAVING BEEN A PHILANDERER AND OCCASIONALLY HEAVY 
DRINKER.  WHILE TOLEDO WON FAVOR WITH MIDDLE CLASS STUDENTS 
FOR DONNING A RED HEAD BAND AND LEADING 50,000 PROTESTORS TO 
THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED APRIL 9, PRO- 
FUJIMORI SUPPORTERS HAVE ALREADY BRANDED HIM A RABBLE ROUSER 
FOR THE SAME REASON.  PERU 2000 OFFICIALS HAVE ALSO TRIED TO 
LINK TOLEDO TO THE HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL EX-PRESIDENT ALAN 
GARCIA, AND TV TALK SHOWS REVISITED ALLEGATIONS THAT HE 
REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE PATERNITY AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO AN 
ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER.  OTHER PRO-GOVERNMENT PRESS REPORTED 
HE AND HIS WIFE WERE DIVORCED AND HAVE NOT REMARRIED. 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND DRUG USE ARE AMONG OTHER, UNCONFIRMED 
RUMORS THAT COULD SURFACE BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT ROUND.

DARLING OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS 
---------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) TOLEDO\'S EARLY YEARS READ LIKE (AND HE PORTRAYS 
THEM AS) A HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT.  (NO LESS THAN 10 U.S. DAILIES 
AND 2 INTERNATIONAL WEEKLIES INCLUDED HIS RAGS-TO-RICHES 
STORY IN THEIR COVERAGE OF PERU\'S ELECTIONS.)  BORN MARCH 
28, 1946, TO PARENTS OF 16 CHILDREN (SEVEN OF WHOM DIED 
PREMATURELY) IN THE SMALL HIGHLAND HAMLET OF CABANA (ANCASH 
DEPARTMENT), HE GREW UP IN THE SEAPORT TOWN OF CHIMBOTE.  BY 
AGE EIGHT, HE WAS WORKING PART TIME AS A SHOESHINE BOY TO 
SUPPLEMENT THE FAMILY\'S INCOME.  IN SECONDARY SCHOOL, HE WON 
RECOGNITION FOR HIS WRITING SKILLS AND SOON AFTER LANDED A 
JOB WORKING FOR A LOCAL PAPER. IN HIS LAST YEAR OF HIGH 
SCHOOL (1962-63), HE WON (WITH THE HELP OF U.S. PEACE CORPS 
VOLUNTEER JOEL MEISNER) A ONE-YEAR ROTARY SCHOLARSHIP TO SAN 
FRANCISCO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY ECONOMICS. 
 
4.  (SBU) WORKING DURING HIS FIRST YEAR OF UNIVERSITY 
STUDIES AS A PART-TIME GAS STATION ATTENDANT, HE PLAYED HIS 
WAY ONTO THE UNIVERSITY\'S SOCCER TEAM AND WON A SCHOLARSHIP. 
HE GRADUATED IN 1970 WITH A BA IN ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS 
ADMINISTRATION AND THEN STUDIED AT STANFORD, WHERE HE 
COMPLETED MASTERS DEGREES IN HUMAN RESOURCES (1971) AND 
ECONOMICS (1972) AND MARRIED FELLOW STANFORD STUDENT ELIANE 
KARP, A BELGIAN BORN AMCIT, IN 1972.  STARTING IN 1973, HE 
WORKED ON A PHD IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPLETED HIS 
COURSEWORK AND EXAMS IN 1976.  (NOTE:  TOLEDO RECEIVED 
RESEARCH GRANTS FROM USAID AND THE FORD FOUNDATION DURING 
1973-76.  WE HAVE NO RECORDS ON HOW HE FINANCED HIS STUDIES 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 04        LIMA  02475  01 OF 03  251228Z 
AT STANFORD BETWEEN 1971-1972.  TOLEDO DID NOT COMPLETE HIS 
PHD IN ECONOMICS OF HUMAN RESOURCES UNTIL 1992.) 
 
5.  (SBU) BETWEEN 1976 AND 1991, HE WAS A LIMA-BASED 
CONSULTANT TO THE UN, WORLD BANK, IBD, AND WORKED FOR THE 
ILO IN GENEVA AND THE OECD IN PARIS.  TOLEDO THEN TAUGHT AS 
A PERMANENT PROFESSOR AT THE GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS 
ADMINISTRATION (ESAN) IN LIMA FROM 1991-1994.  DURING THIS 
SAME PERIOD HE WAS A VISITING SCHOLAR AT HARVARD.  (NOTE: 
TOLEDO DID A STUDY ON MACRO ECONOMIC ISSUES IN 1988 FOR 
USAID; HE ALSO CONSULTED FOR USAID WHILE AT HARVARD.) 
 
6.  (SBU) TOLEDO CLAIMS THAT, AFTER FINISHING HIS PHD 
COURSEWORK IN 1976 (AND IN BETWEEN CONSULTING JOBS), HE 
ADVISED SEVERAL (UNSPECIFIED) LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES.  HIS 
CV SAYS BETWEEN 1983-1991 HE \"PROVIDED PERIODICAL TECHNICAL 
AND INDEPENDENT ADVICE TO PERU\'S PRESIDENTS BELAUNDE, 
GARCIA, AND FUJIMORI,\" ON EXTERNAL DEBT, STRUCTURAL REFORMS, 
AND ECONOMIC GROWTH STRATEGIES.  (NOTE: FUJIMORI DENIED THAT 
TOLEDO HAD ANY ASSOCIATION WITH HIS GOVERNMENT.)  HE ALSO 
WORKED AS THE DIRECTOR GENERAL AND VICE MINISTER OF 
ECONOMICS AND LABOR STUDIES AND THE MINISTRY OF LABOR (1981- 
1983).

7.  (C) TOLEDO RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 1995, COMING OUT OF 
NOWHERE TO PEAK AT 15 PERCENT BEFORE FADING TO THREE PERCENT 
(AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF TIES TO THE CLAE PYRAMID SCHEME -- 
SEE BELOW) AND A FOURTH-PLACE FINISH. HIS CAMPAIGN CENTERED 
ON JOB CREATION AND INSTITUTIONALIZING PERU\'S PRIVATIZATION 
PROGRAM.  ACCORDING TO EMBASSY FILES, TOLEDO MAINTAINED 
CLOSE CONTACTS TO THE FUJIMORI GOVERNMENT AFTER THE ELECTION 
AND WAS MANEUVERING TO LAND A HIGH-PROFILE MINISTRY OF TRADE 
OR FINANCE JOB THAT ULTIMATELY NEVER MATERIALIZED.  HE 
RETURNED TO HIS JOB AT ESAN AND BECAME DIRECTOR OF THE 
RESEARCH AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN 1998. 
A RELIABLE AND REGULAR EMBASSY CONTACT, HE VOICED HIS 
INTENTION TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2000 TO THE DCM IN 
NOVEMBER 1996. 
 
------------------------------- 
BLACK MARK I:  THE CLAE SCANDAL 
------------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU) TOLEDO\'S REPUTATION IN THE 1995 ELECTIONS SUFFERED 
FROM ALLEGATIONS OF TIES TO THE 1993 COLLAPSE OF A MULTI- 
MILLION DOLLAR PYRAMID SCHEME (CALLED CLAE -- THE LATIN 
AMERICAN CENTER OF BUSINESS ADVICE) IN WHICH THOUSANDS OF 
PERUVIANS LOST THEIR SAVINGS AND SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE 
CONVICTED OF FRAUD.  TOLEDO\'S DIRECT INVOLVEMENT WAS NEVER 
ESTABLISHED, BUT HE HAD WELL KNOWN PERSONAL (AND ALLEGED 
PROFESSIONAL) TIES TO CLAE\'S OWNERS, CARLOS MANRIQUE AND HIS 
WIFE VIOLETA MORI, BOTH OF WHOM ARE IN JAIL AND HAVE

CHARGE HE DENIES).  TOLEDO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF HELPING HIS 
BROTHER WITHDRAW MONEY BEFORE CLAE\'S COLLAPSE.  THE CLAE 
STORY RESURFACED IN MARCH 2000 AS TOLEDO\'S POLL NUMBERS 
GREW.  PRO-GOVERNMENT DAILY EXPRESO AND YELLOW PRESS PAPERS 
PRINTED PICTURES OF TOLEDO AND MANRIQUE IN BOSTON.  TOLEDO 
ADMITTED THAT HE AND MANRIQUE HAD BEEN PERSONAL FRIENDS BUT 
DENIED ANY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION.  THE CLAE STORY RE- 
CIRCULATED DOUBTS ABOUT TOLEDO, BUT NOTHING NEW TURNED UP.

ILLEGITIMATE CHILD, DIVORCE 
--------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) ON MARCH 28, LUCRECIA OROZCO ZAPATA APPEARED ON A 
POPULAR DAYTIME TV TALK SHOW AND ALLEGED THAT TOLEDO HAD 
FATHERED HER SIX-YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE 
AND SUPPORT HER.  THOUGH TOLEDO HAD WON TWO PATERNITY COURT 
JUDGMENTS SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THE SHOW\'S HOSTESS, LAURA 
BOZZO, CLAIMED THE COURTS WERE CORRUPT AND HAD IGNORED A 
POSITIVE BLOOD TYPE MATCH.  BOZZO LED THE TV STUDIO AUDIENCE 
IN CHANTS CALLING ON TOLEDO TO TAKE A DNA TEST FOR SEVERAL 
DAYS THEREAFTER.  TOLEDO REFUSED COMMENT ON THE CHARGES, 
NOTED THE COURTS\' PREVIOUS RULINGS, AND SAID HE HAD ONLY ONE 
WIFE AND CHILD.  OUR FILES CONTAIN NO MENTION OF OROZCO, BUT 
EMBASSY SOURCES TELL US THAT TOLEDO DATED HER OPENLY IN THE 
EARLY 1990S AFTER HE AND HIS WIFE SEPARATED SOMETIME IN 
1988. 
 
10.  (SBU) IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS LEADING TO THIS YEAR\'S 
ELECTIONS, EXPRESSO BROKE A STORY THAT TOLEDO AND HIS WIFE 
                          SECRET 
 
PAGE 04        LIMA  02475  02 OF 03  251229Z 
HAD DIVORCED IN 1992, COMPLETE WITH A PHOTOCOPY OF THE 
WASHINGTON, DC DIVORCE DECREE.  EXPRESSO CLAIMED THAT TOLEDO 
HAD COMMITTED PERJURY WHEN HE CLAIMED TO BE MARRIED IN AN 
APPLICATION FOR OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN 1997.  TOLEDO REFUSED 
COMMENT ON WHETHER HE AND KARP HAD EVER DIVORCED OR 
REMARRIED. 
 
------------------- 
OTHER DIRTY LAUNDRY 
------------------- 
 
11.  (C) TOLEDO\'S DOMESTIC PROBLEMS WERE WIDELY KNOWN WITHIN 
THE MISSION COMMUNITY BECAUSE BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE HAD TIES 
TO USAID.  ELIANE KARP WORKED FOR USAID LIMA FROM 1985-87 
AND HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING BRILLIANT BUT UNRELIABLE AND 
DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH.  SHE SPOKE FLUENT QUECHUA AND WAS 
ACTIVE IN LIMA\'S SMALL JEWISH COMMUNITY.  MISSION STAFF 
RECALL HER HAVING MARITAL DIFFICULTIES.  THERE WERE ALSO 
STORIES THAT SHE WAS A VICTIM OF SPOUSAL ABUSE.  USAID 
DECIDED NOT TO RENEW HER CONTRACT IN 1987 (MAINLY BECAUSE 
HER WORK ATTENDANCE BECAME TOO UNPREDICTABLE AS HER MARRIAGE 
CAME UNDER GROWING STRESS) AND IN JANUARY 1988 SHE SEPARATED 
FROM TOLEDO AND FOUND EMPLOYMENT IN THE WORLD BANK IN 
WASHINGTON.  EVENTUALLY SHE MOVED TO ISRAEL UNTIL SHE AND

TOLEDO RECONCILED IN LATE 1996. 
 
12.  (C) SINCE THEN KARP HAS WORKED AS A MANAGER IN AN 
AGRICULTURE BANK.  THOUGH CREDITED WITH HELPING TOLEDO\'S 
CAMPAIGN BY USING HER KNOWLEDGE OF PERU AND FLUENT QUECHUA 
TO APPEAL TO VOTERS, SHE HAS COME UNDER ATTACK FROM THE 
YELLOW PRESS AND OTHERS FOR HER LIBERAL VIEWS AND STATUS AS 
A FOREIGNER.  SOURCES CLOSE TO TOLEDO CONFIRM THAT KARP 
URGED HER HUSBAND TO DON A HEADBAND AND LEAD PROTESTERS IN A 
MARCH ON THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE AFTER THE POLLS CLOSED 
APRIL 9, A DECISION THAT MANY PERUVIAN OPINION MAKERS 
FOUND QUESTIONABLE. 
13.  (S) A FUJIMORI POLLSTER AND OTHER PRO-GOVERNMENT 
SOURCES HAVE CONVEYED TO CURRENT AND FORMER EMBOFFS THAT THE 
GOP HAS EVIDENCE OF DRUG (INCLUDING COCAINE) USE BY TOLEDO; 
JUST WHEN THE DRUG USE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE OCCURRED IS 
UNCLEAR.  IT MAY HAVE BEEN DURING TOLEDO\'S STUDENT DAYS AT 
THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND STANFORD 25-30 YEARS 
AGO.  THUS FAR, THERE IS NOTHING TO SUGGEST HE CONTINUED, 
BUT THIS ISSUE COULD PROVE EXPLOSIVE IN THE LEAD UP TO THE

CENTRAL ISSUE IN THE SECOND ROUND (I.E., CONTINUE WITH SMEAR 
TACTICS), AS EVERYONE FROM VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
TUDELA ON DOWN HAS FOUND REASONS NOT TO SUPPORT HUMAN RIGHTS 
OMBUDSMAN JORGE SANTISTEVAN\'S PROPOSAL FOR AN ELECTORAL CODE 
OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS TRIBUNAL. FUJIMORI\'S SUPPORTERS HAVE 
ALREADY PORTRAYED TOLEDO AS A RABBLE ROUSING DEMAGOGUE CUT 
IN THE MOLD OF ALAN GARCIA.  WE EXPECT PRO-GOVERNMENT 
JOURNALISTS TO EGG TOLEDO TO ISSUE AN ON-THE-RECORD DENIAL 
OF DRUG USE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, FOLLOWED BY LEAKING OF 
WHATEVER EVIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT HAS.   FOR HIS PART, TOLEDO 
IS LIKELY TO REFUSE ANY COMMENT ON THE ALLEGATIONS.  WE 
SHOULD ALSO REFUSE COMMENT.

SUBJECT: TOLEDO AT THE HELM 
 
REF: LIMA 03297 
 
CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN R. HAMILTON FOR REASONS 
1.5(B) AND 1.5(D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY: ALEJANDRO TOLEDO WAS TENACIOUS IN HIS 
STRUGGLE TO REACH THE PRESIDENCY AND WILL APPLY THE SAME 
TENACITY TO SUCCEED IN OFFICE.  HE COMES TO OFFICE WITH NO 
GOVERNMENT OR MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, AND HIS 
PROPENSITY TO BE A ONE-MAN SHOW CAN BE A NAGGING 
SHORTCOMING.  NONETHELESS, IN OUR VIEW, HE WILL ULTIMATELY 
EXERCISE SOUND JUDGMENT.  HE FACES THE PRESSURE OF 
EXORBITANT CAMPAIGN PROMISES, EXPECTATIONS THAT A VICTORY 
FOR DEMOCRACY CAN SPEEDILY RESOLVE PERU\'S ILLS, AND 
POLITICAL DEBTS.  HE ALSO FACES DIFFICULT ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS.  IT IS THE ECONOMY WHERE HE WILL FOCUS, WHILE 
TRYING TO GIVE OTHER PRIORITIES, SUCH AS JUDICIAL AND 
MILITARY REFORM, THEIR DUE.  INTERNATIONALLY, HE WILL 
PURSUE AN INDEPENDENT COURSE, WHICH NEVERTHELESS WILL BE IN 
ACCORD WITH US MUCH OF THE TIME, AND BE LESS CONCERNED 
ABOUT BEING IN LOCKSTEP WITH PERU\'S NEIGHBORS.  WHETHER HIS 
GOVERNMENT SUCCEEDS OR FAILS WILL ALSO BE SEEN AS A TEST 
FOR DEMOCRACY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GOVERNING STYLE 
=============== 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        LIMA  03418  01 OF 03  191454Z 
2.  (C) WHEN ALEJANDRO TOLEDO ASSUMES THE PRESIDENCY JULY 
28, HE WILL BRING TO OFFICE A STRONGLY PERSONAL ONE-MAN 
STYLE.  DECISION-MAKING WILL RESIDE WITH HIM AS IT HAS 
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.  ALTHOUGH HE TALKS A GOOD GAME ABOUT 
EMPOWERING HIS MINISTERS, TOLEDO HAS NOT PROVEN ABLE TO 
DELEGATE AUTHORITY.  A SOLITARY LEADER, HE DOES NOT EASILY 
EXTEND HIMSELF OR HIS TRUST TO OTHERS.  CLOSEST TO HIM IS 
HIS WIFE, ELIANE KARP.  NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF HER 
INFLUENCE HAVE LED THE TOLEDO CAMP TO LOWER HER PROFILE 
TEMPORARILY, BUT HER INFLUENCE IS SIGNIFICANT AND WILL 
LIKELY GROW. 
 
3.  (C) ALSO AFFECTING TOLEDO\'S PERSONAL STYLE IS HIS NEED 
FOR AFFIRMATION, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL.  AT HOME, THIS 
CHARACTERISTIC, ACCORDING TO CRITICS, BRINGS HIM TO THE 
BORDERS OF A MESSIANIC COMPLEX.  AFTER THE VINDICATION OF 
HIS ROLE IN RETURNING DEMOCRACY TO PERU, TOLEDO NOW SEES 
HIMSELF AS SINGLE-HANDEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR LIFTING PERU OUT 
OF POVERTY OR, AT A MINIMUM, OUT OF ECONOMIC RECESSION. 
THE TEST OF THE TOLEDO GOVERNMENT ON ECONOMIC ISSUES IS 
ALSO THE TEST OF TOLEDO THE MAN - HIS PERSONAL SUCCESS OR 
FAILURE BOUND UP WITH THAT OF HIS GOVERNMENT.  ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL SCENE, TOLEDO\'S NEED FOR APPROVAL INFLUENCES 
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE USG.  HE HARBORS SOME RESENTMENT, 
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE DID NOT BACK HIM OPENLY WHEN HE 
OPPOSED FUJIMORI AND SOUGHT INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION.  HE 
WILL EXPECT TO BE TREATED ON EQUAL FOOTING WITH WORLD 
LEADERS, INCLUDING WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, AND WILL USE THE 
ATTENTION ACCORDED HIM BY OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERITS 
OF THE COMPARISON, AS A BASELINE. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        LIMA  03418  01 OF 03  191454Z 
4.  (C) THE POSITIVE SIDE OF TOLEDO\'S INDIVIDUALISM IS HIS 
TENACITY AND HIS DETERMINATION TO SUCCEED.  HE IS PROUD OF 
BEING A FIGHTER, DEMONSTRATED IN HIS TWO-YEAR STRUGGLE TO 
GET TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PALACE.  HE COMES TO THE JOB, 
HOWEVER, WITH NO EXPERIENCE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL OR IN 
MANAGEMENT.  THIS SHORTCOMING WILL MAKE THE DECISION-MAKING 
PROCESS IN TOLEDO\'S GOVERNMENT APPEAR DYSFUNCTIONAL, BUT WE 
BELIEVE TOLEDO\'S DECISIONS ON THE KEY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE 
TO THE U.S. WILL ULTIMATELY BE THE RIGHT ONES. 
 
PRESSURES 
========= 
 
5.  (C) CHIEF AMONG THE PRESSURES TOLEDO WILL FACE ARE THE 
EXPECTATIONS HE HAS RAISED WITH HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES. 
NEWSPAPERS HAVE PUBLISHED LISTS OF THEM AND THERE ARE MANY 
THAT WILL BE KEEPING SCORE.  ONE ANTI-TOLEDO DAILY, FOR 
EXAMPLE, DID NOT WAIT A DAY AFTER THE JUNE 3 ELECTIONS TO 
HIGHLIGHT THAT TOLEDO ADVISORS HAD ALREADY BACKTRACKED ON 
TWO PROMISES RELATED TO TAXES.  TOLEDO\'S POPULAR SUPPORT 
WILL HELP HIM WEATHER MUCH OF THE CRITICISM, AT LEAST IN 
THE FIRST THREE TO SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE.  HE IS AWARE THAT 
HE HAS TO BE PUBLICLY AGGRESSIVE IN REDUCING THOSE 
EXPECTATIONS, AND HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO DO SO, SPEAKING OF 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

THE NEED FOR PATIENCE. 
 
6.  (C) THERE IS ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HE MAY OWE 
POLITICALLY TO HIS CAMPAIGN\'S SUPPORTERS.  WITH ONLY 
RUDIMENTARY CAMPAIGN FINANCING RULES, THERE IS LITTLE 
INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE FINANCIAL BACKERS AND THEIR 
INTERESTS.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS 
GEORGE SOROS\' OPEN SOCIETY PROVIDED FOR THE JULY 2000 ANTI- 
FUJIMORI PROTESTS (CUATRO SUYOS), ONLY MEDIA BUSINESSMAN 
BARUCH IVCHER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A CONTRIBUTOR.  THERE 
ARE RUMORS THAT ANOTHER, SOMEWHAT UNSAVORY BUSINESSMAN, 
LEON RUPP, HAS BEEN A MAJOR BACKER.  RAUL DIEZ CANSECO, THE 
FIRST VP FROM AN OLD, WEALTHY LIMA FAMILY, ALSO HELPED TO 
BANKROLL TOLEDO\'S CAMPAIGN. 
 
7.  (C) TOLEDO\'S MOST PROMINENT POLITICAL DEBT IS TO 
MORALIZING INDEPENDENT FRONT (FIM) LEADER FERNANDO OLIVERA. 
FIM PLAYED THE CAMPAIGN ATTACK DOG AGAINST APRA\'S ALAN 
GARCIA AND PLEDGED ITS ELEVEN LEGISLATORS TO BACK TOLEDO IN 
THE CONGRESS.  OLIVERA, HOWEVER, IS NOT VIEWED AS A 
RELIABLE POLITICAL PARTNER (REFTEL).  THE KEY FOR TOLEDO 
WILL BE TO BALANCE ANY REWARDS FOR OLIVERA AGAINST 
MAINTAINING COHESION IN HIS OWN PARTY\'S RANKS.  WITHOUT THE 
FIM, THE ONLY OTHER SUBSTANTIAL CONGRESSIONAL BLOC TOLEDO 
HAS SUCCESSFULLY COURTED, TOLEDO\'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA MAY 
SUFFER. 
 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z 
YES, IT\'S THE ECONOMY 
===================== 
 
8.  (C) TOLEDO WILL FOCUS HIS ENERGIES ON THE ECONOMY, 
WHERE HE IS DESPERATE TO GET POSITIVE GROWTH FAST.  HE HAS 
STAKED MUCH ON REVITALIZING THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, 
GENERATING EMPLOYMENT AND BRINGING PERU OUT OF RECESSION. 
HE HAS A SOLID, IF SOMEWHAT ECLECTIC, ECONOMIC TEAM AND IS 
BANKING ON THE LYNCHPIN CABINET APPOINTMENT OF WELL KNOWN 
INVESTMENT BANKER PEDRO PABLO KUCZYNSKI.  HIS TWO VICE 
PRESIDENTS, RAUL DIEZ-CANSECO AND DAVID WAISMAN, BRING 
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. 
 
9.  (C) THE ANTENNAE ARE OUT, HOWEVER, FOR POSSIBLE TURNING 
POINTS IN HOW TOLEDO HANDLES ECONOMIC MATTERS WHEN THESE 
ARE TOUGH ISSUES AND POTENTIALLY COMPETING ADVICE AND 
INTERESTS.  ONE FEAR IS THAT HE MAY RESORT SIMPLY TO HIS 
OWN ECONOMICS EXPERTISE RATHER THAN RELYING ON OR LISTENING 
TO ADVISORS.  ANOTHER IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE MAY BEGIN 
TO PURSUE POPULIST MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC 
PRESSURES AS HIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM EITHER TAKES 
LONGER THAN EXPECTED OR DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS. 
 
10.  (C) NON-DOMESTIC FACTORS, BEYOND TOLEDO\'S CONTROL, 
WILL ALSO INFLUENCE HOW HE DOES ON THE ECONOMY.  ON A 
MACRO-LEVEL, A SLOW DOWN IN THE U.S. AND WORLD ECONOMIES 
WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.  IF THE U.S. ECONOMY 
SLIDES, EVEN GOOD DECISIONS MAY NOT HAVE THE DESIRED 
EFFECT.  WORLD PRICES FOR PERU\'S COMMODITIES AND THE 
POSSIBLE RETURN OF THE DESTRUCTIVE EL NINO WEATHER PATTERN 
ARE ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT PERU\'S GROWTH IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        LIMA  03418  02 OF 03  191454Z 
THE COMING YEARS.  MORE SPECIFICALLY, HOW THE ANDEAN TRADE 
PREFERENCES ACT (ATPA) FARES IN THE U.S. CONGRESS WILL ALSO 
BE IMPORTANT. 
 
11.  (C) IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMY, WE CAN EXPECT TOLEDO 
TO DEVOTE ATTENTION TO JUDICIAL REFORM AND TO THE MILITARY. 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY HAS RECEIVED A STRONG 
BOOST UNDER THE PANIAGUA GOVERNMENT AND IT IS LIKELY TO 
REMAIN ON THE SAME TRACK UNDER TOLEDO.  NEVERTHELESS, 
ALTHOUGH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE HAS BEEN LARGELY RESTORED TO 
THE STATUS QUO ANTE FUJIMORI, THE PERUVIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
REMAINS IN DIRE NEED OF RADICAL REFORM AND MODERNIZATION. 
THE MILITARY, DISCREDITED FOR ITS CORRUPT LINKS TO FORMER 
INTELLIGENCE ADVISOR VLADIMIRO MONTESINOS, FACES AN 
UNSYMPATHETIC MASTER IN TOLEDO.  HE HAS PUT THE ARMED 
FORCES ON NOTICE ABOUT PURSUING CORRUPTION AND ABUSES, 
FAVORS MILITARY BUDGET CUTS AND WILL PRESS FOR GREATER 
CIVILIAN CONTROL. 
 
TOLEDO ON THE WORLD STAGE 
========================= 
 
12.  (C) TOLEDO IS UNLIKELY TO PURSUE POLICIES INIMICAL TO 
THE UNITED STATES.  FAMILIAR WITH THE SCOPE OF THE

SUBJECT: TOLEDO AT THE HELM 
 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, HE WILL NONETHELESS SEEK TO ENSURE 
HE MAKES HIS MARK.  IN COUNTER NARCOTICS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
TOLEDO WILL LIKELY SUPPORT COCA ERADICATION, BUT HE WILL 
INSIST ON CREATING JOBS FOR FORMER COCA GROWERS.  TO ASSIST 
THESE FARMERS, TOLEDO WILL LIKELY ARGUE FOR TRADE 
PREFERENCES ON TEXTILES AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  IN SUPPORTING 
ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT, TOLEDO WILL FAVOR ALTERNATIVE 
CROPS, BUT HE MAY PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL PRICE SUPPORTS. 
OVERALL, TOLEDO HAS INDICATED HE WILL TAKE A HARD LINE 
AGAINST NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS. 
 
13.  (C) UNLIKE THE INTERIM PANIAGUA GOVERNMENT, WHICH 
FAVORED WORKING IN CONSENSUS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS REGARDLESS 
OF DIFFERENCES, TOLEDO WILL PLAY A MORE INDEPENDENT ROLE IN 
REGIONAL RELATIONS.  LINKS WITH BRAZIL WILL NEED REPAIR 
AFTER THE RECENT HISTORY OF BRAZILIAN FAVORING OF FUJIMORI 
AND OF ONE OF TOLEDO\'S FIRST ROUND OPPONENTS, LOURDES 
FLORES NANO.  SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO LOVE LOST WITH 
VENEZUELA\'S HUGO CHAVEZ, REGARDED BY TOLEDO AND MANY IN HIS 
CAMP AS THE ANTI-DEMOCRAT.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE 
COMMON PERCEPTION THAT, IN PART THANKS TO CHAVEZ, 
MONTESINOS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REMAINING A FUGITIVE.

SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT INDICTS FUJIMORI 
 
1.  (U) SUPREME COURT JUDGE JOSE LECAROS INDICTED FORMER 
PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI SEPTEMBER 13 FOR HIS ALLEGED 
COMPLICITY IN THE BARRIOS ALTOS (1991) AND LA CANTUTA 
(1992) KILLINGS AS WELL AS THE 1997 MURDER OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AGENT MARIELLA BARRETO.  BEGINNING THE 
INVESTIGATIVE (INSTRUCTION) PHASE OF THE TRIAL, LECAROS 
WILL FORMULATE IN THE COMING DAYS AN OFFICIAL REQUEST FOR 
INTERPOL TO LOCATE FUJIMORI AND ASSIST IN HIS DETENTION. 
(PRESS REPORTS INDICATE HE HAS ALREADY DONE SO.) 
 
2.  (U) THE INDICTMENT FOLLOWS THE LIFTING OF FUJIMORI\'S 
IMMUNITY BY CONGRESS IN AUGUST.  TWO WEEKS AGO, ATTORNEY 
GENERAL NELLY CALDERON FILED THE CHARGES AGAINST THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT.  THE PROSECUTOR WORKING ON THE CASE ALLEGES THAT 
FUJIMORI USED HIS INFLUENCE TO IMPEDE CONGRESSIONAL 
INVESTIGATION OF THE KILLINGS AND GRANTED AMNESTY TO THE 
PERSONS RESPONSIBLE. 
 
3.   (U) UNDER PERUVIAN PROCEDURES, CHARGES AGAINST A 
PRESIDENT MUST BE HANDLED BY THE SUPREME COURT.  (CASES 
AGAINST LEGISLATORS OR MINISTERS GO TO SUPERIOR COURT FOR 
INVESTIGATION AND ADJUDICATION.)  ONE OF ITS JUDGES, 
USUALLY THE LEAST SENIOR, ACTS AS A JUDGE OF INSTRUCTION TO 
REVIEW THE EVIDENCE.  WHEN THE JUDGE COMPLETES THIS 
INVESTIGATIVE PHASE, HE SUBMITS THE CASE TO THE COURT FOR

TRIAL, IF WARRANTED.  THE ACCUSED CAN BE TRIED IN ABSENTIA, 
THOUGH SENTENCING -- IF FOUND GUILTY -- WAITS UNTIL THE 
PERSON IS IN CUSTODY. 
 
4.  (SBU) COMMENT: PERUVIANS, CHARACTERIZING FUJIMORI\'S 
ALLEGED COMPLICITY AS CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY, SEE THE 
INDICTMENT AS ANOTHER STEP TOWARD THE FORMER PRESIDENT\'S 
EXTRADITION.  JAPAN, HOWEVER, HAS REITERATED THAT IT WILL 
NOT EXTRADITE FUJIMORI.  THE EVIDENCE THAT HAS CARRIED THE 
CHARGES AGAINST FUJIMORI THIS FAR IS LARGELY 
CIRCUMSTANTIAL.  NONETHELESS, IT IS LIKELY THAT LECAROS 
WILL CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROCEED 
WITH A TRIAL.

SUBJECT: PERUVIAN NARCOTRAFFICKER FERNANDO ZEVALLOS: 
INITIATING PROCESS TO REVOKE LPR STATUS 
 
REF: 03 LIMA 5174 
 
Classified By: Polcouns Alexander Margulies.  Reason:  1.5(b/d). 
 
1.  (SBU)  Embassy\'s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
office plans to deliver two letters on January 13: 
 
--  one to suspected narcotrafficker Fernando Zevallos 
Gonzalez requesting that he present himself at the Embassy to 
make a sworn statement regarding his eligibility to enter the 
U.S. as a Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) and informing him 
that there is reason to believe that he is excludable and 
that he has abandoned his status as an LPR (para 5); and 
 
--  a second letter to all airlines operating internationally 
from Peru, informing them that DHS is taking action to 
determine Zevallos\' eligibility to enter the U.S. as an LPR, 
that until his status is clarified Zevallos does not appear 
eligible to enter the U.S., that his Alien Registration 
Receipt Card is no longer valid, that airlines may not 
transport Zevallos to the U.S., directly or indirectly, and 
that failure to comply could result in fines, penalties and 
even seizure of the aircraft (para 6). 
 
2.  (S)  Given Zevallos\' prominence in Peru (Reftel) and the 
wide circulation the letter to the airlines will likely 
receive, it is to be expected that word of DHS\'s action will 
soon become public knowledge and stimulate the sort of 
speculative reporting which is a hallmark of the Peruvian 
press.  Privacy act requirements limit official comment upon 
the case, and Mission responses to press queries will be 
dictated by these constraints.  Post proposes the following 
\"if asked\" guidance. 
 
Q:  What prompted this DHS action? 
 
A:   Privacy Act requirments limit what can be said, but 
there is a question as to the eligibility of Mr. Zevallos to 
enter the United States. 
 
Q:  If there is doubt about his status now, how did he get a 
visa in the first place? 
 
A:  We intend to discuss this issue with Mr. Zevallos. 
 
Q:  In general can you say what might prompt the USG to take 
this kind of action? 
 
A:  I\'d  have to refer you to DHS for any specific comment. 
 
Q:  Isn\'t it true that Mr. Zevallos is currently on trial for 
drug trafficking in Peru? 
 
A:  Yes. 
 
Q:   Did that fact influence DHS\'s decision? 
 
A:   Again, I am unable to comment on specific aspects of Mr. 
Zevallos\'s case. 
 
3.  (S)  Should Zevallos present himself as requested, DHS 
Acting Officer-in-Charge intends to ask questions regarding: 
 
--  When and how Zevallos entered the United States over the 
past few years; 
 
--  Evidence of Zevallos\' connections to the United States, 
such as copies of Federal and State Income Tax returns; and 
 
--  Zevallos\'s claim on his immigration visa application in 
1994 that he had never been arrested, when there is evidence 
that he was arrested on a murder charge in the late 1980s. 
 
4.  (SBU)  TEXT OF LETTER TO ZEVALLOS: 
 
Dear Mr. Zevallos, 
 
The United States Department of Homeland Security - U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests your presence at 
the American Embassy in Lima, Peru.  The purpose of this 
request is to take your sworn statement regarding your 
eligibility to enter the United States as an alien lawfully 
admitted for permanent residence. 
 
There is reason to believe that you are excludable from the 
United States and that you have de facto abandoned your 
status as a resident alien of the United States.  Section 287 
of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act and 8 USC 1357 
grants authority to this office to \"administer oaths and to 
take and consider evidence concerning the privilege of any 
person to enter, re-enter, pass through or reside in the 
United States, or concerning any matter which is material or 
relevant to the enforcement of this Act and the 
administration of the Service...\" 
 
Please be advised that under Section 291 of the U.S. 
Immigration and Nationality Act and 8 USC 1361, you have the 
burden of proof in establishing that you are not inadmissible 
for entry into the United States:  \"Whenever any 
person...makes application for admission, or otherwise 
attempts to enter the United States, the burden of proof 
shall be upon such person to establish that he is eligible to 
receive such visa or such document, or is not inadmissible 
under any provision of this Act...\" 
 
As your admissibility into the United States and your status 
as a resident alien are in question, you are advised that you 
may not travel to the United States without prior written 
authorization from the Department of Homeland Security 
authorizing you to do so. 
 
You have a period of 30 days from the date of this communique 
to contact this office so that we can arrange for your entry 
into the Embassy and prepare for the taking of your sworn 
statement.  You will have every opportunity to present 
evidence that validates your admissibility into the United 
States and status as an alien admitted for permanent 
residence in the United States.  It is important that you 
bring with you the Alien Registration and Receipt Cart (\"The 
Green Card\") that was issued to you by the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
 
Failure to comply with this request will be understood as 
your acknowledgment and recognition that you have indeed 
abandoned your status as a resident alien of the United 
States. 
 
I avail myself of this opportunity to thank you in advance 
for your cooperation in this matter. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Alonso Camarena Gonzalez 
Officer-Charge/Acting 
 
5.  (SBU)  TEXT OF LETTER TO AIRLINES: 
 
Dear Sir or Madam, 
 
The Department of Homeland Security - Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement Office advises all airlines that this office has 
taken action that seeks to determine the eligibility of Mr. 
Fernando ZEVALLOS Gonzalez to enter the United States as an 
alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.  Until the 
question of his status is clarified, Mr. Zevallos does not 
appear to be clearly and beyond a reasonable doubt eligible 
for admission into the United States.  Mr. Zevallos\' Alien 
Registration Receipt Card (I-551) is no longer valid, 
irrespective of the expiration date specified on the document 
itself. 
As such, you are advised that you may not transport Mr. 
Zevallos, either directly or indirectly, to the United States 
without prior written authorization from the Department of 
Homeland Security.  He is not to be allowed to board a U.S. 
bound flight, either from Lima or indirectly from a third 
country. 
You are advised that failure to comply with this memorandum 
could result in fines, penalties, and even seizure of the 
aircraft involved. 
 
Attached please find the authorities as are prescribed within 
the United States Immigration and Nationality Act and Title 8 
United States Code relating to the unlawful transportation of 
aliens to the United States. 
 
I avail myself of this opportunity to thank you and your 
employees for the outstanding and professional cooperation 
which you have always manifested to this agency. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Alonso Camarena Gonzalez 
Officer-Charge/Acting 
 
END TEXT. 
 
6.  (S)  COMMENT:  The DHS action to invite Zevallos to an 
interview with a DHS officer assigned to Embassy Lima is the 
result of information that Zevallos may have commited fraud 
in applying for an immigrant visa in 1994.  At that time, 
Zevallos denied any previous arrest or involvement in 
narcotics trafficking.  It also appears that he has remained 
outside the U.S. for over one year causing his immigrant 
status to lapse.  Zevallos\' high visibility in Peru and his 
reported ownership of Peru\'s largest airline, Aerocontinente, 
will likely draw media attention to the DHS action.  Zevallos 
is currently on trial in Lima for conspiracy to smuggle 3.3 
tons of cocaine to Mexico (with the U.S. its likely final 
destination) in 1995.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PINS, PHUM, PE 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT TOLEDO BLASTS JUDICIARY\'S HANDLING OF 
SENDERO LUMINOSO LEADERS\' TRIAL 
 
REF: LIMA 5163 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY:  President Toledo harshly criticized the 
judiciary\'s handling of the trial of Sendero Luminoso (SL) 
founder Abimael Guzman and other SL leaders in a national 
address 11/6, after Guzman and his co-defendants were 
permitted to disrupt the opening of their oral trial the 
previous day.  The President vowed that no terrorists will be 
released while his government is in office, called for 
\"summary\" trials of terrorists, and announced the 
appointment of a new State Attorney (Procurador) for 
Terrorism who would seek to recuse the three judges presiding 
over the trial.  The televised spectre of Guzman and his 
cronies reaffirming their terrorist actions and showing no 
remorse for the estimated 69,000  deaths resulting from SL\'s 
rebellion caused widespread public revulsion, and politicians 
from across the political spectrum quickly backed the 
President.  While Toledo may have scored some political 
points, his intervention could well be seized on by the SL 
defendants as grounds for a future appeal to the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U)  The first of many retrials of Sendero Luminoso 
founder Abimael Guzman (Reftel) lasted half-an-hour before it 
was suspended after Guzman and four of the 18 defendants 
stood up and began chanting revolutionary slogans.  Presiding 
judge Dante Terrel, President of the three-member \"A\" 
Antiterrorism Chamber, appeared to contribute to the chaos 
through his indecision, alternatively admitting then 
prohibiting television cameras and failing to ensure proper 
decorum in the courtroom.  In the end, Terrel chose to 
suspend the session, with the next hearing scheduled for 
11/12. 
 
3. (U)  President Toledo, in a television address on 11/6, 
promised an \"iron fist\" against SL, called for \"summary\" 
trials of SL terrorists, criticized the court for permitting 
Guzman to use the proceedings for propaganda purposes, 
announced that he would appoint a new State Attorney 
(Procurador) for Terrorism cases and that this official would 
seek to recuse the three-judge panel and would demand life 
sentences for the defendants.  The President also declared 
that stricter security measures would be applied to the SL 
leaders in the Callao Navy Base prison, including the use of 
interview booths with security windows to prevent personal 
contact between the defendants and their attorneys/visitors. 
(Note:  The previous Anti-Terrorism Procurador resigned 
several months ago.  The interview booths were removed 
earlier this year after Guzman and other SL prisoners went on 
a hunger strike.  Press articles over the past month claimed 
that Guzman has been running Shining Path remnants from his 
jail cell, facilitated by liberal visitation policies.  There 
have been previous calls for Judge Terrel\'s recusal, based on 
his representation of terrorist defendants in the early 
1990\'s.  Foreign Ministry legal experts told Poloff on 11/8, 
that the GOP can move for the recusal of the entire 
three-judge panel, but that a final decision will be up to 
the judges themselves or to the Supreme Court.  End Note). 
 
4.  (U)  Media coverage of the opening session was 
sensationalized and public revulsion widespread at the sight 
of Guzman and his co-defendants publicly reaffirming their 
revolution and its bloody consequences.  Most press 
commentary backed the President\'s criticism of the judiciary, 
although some debated whether his intervention constituted 
interference with the Judicial Branch.  Pro-GOP and 
opposition politicians supported Toledo\'s announcements, 
although APRA leader Alan Garcia added that the President 
would leave a resurgent SL as a legacy. 
 
5. (U) The GOP, on 11/8, announced the appointment of 
Guillermo Cabala, ex-director of Office of Control over 
Magistrates (OCMA), the Peruvian agency that investigates 
judicial misconduct, as the new Procurador for Terrorism in 
the Interior Ministry.  Cabala is a respected jurist but 
critics have questioned whether, at 76 years of age, he might 
be a bit long in the tooth for such an important 
responsibility. 
 
6. (U) Legal experts, such as former Foreign Minister Diego 
Garcia Sayan, have pointed out constitutional and procedural 
impediments to holding summary trials or recusing judges once 
a trial has begun.  Cabala sought to soften Toledo\'s remarks 
by saying they should be put in the context of the 
president\'s wish for a speedy and efficient trial.  Cabala 
criticized the inexperience of Judge Terrel, questioned his 
impartiality, noting that Terrel represented terrorists in 
the past, and said he would pursue a legal way to have the 
judges recused. 
 
6. (SBU)  COMMENT:  President Toledo notched up political 
points with his virulent denunciation of the judiciary\'s 
handling of the terrorism retrial and announcement of 
remedial measures.  The outpouring of public revulsion at the 
SL leaders\' antics demonstrates that public rejection of 
Peru\'s terrorist legacy remains strong.  Toledo\'s 
intervention, however, could well be used by the defendants 
as evidence of improper Executive Branch interference with 
the Judicial Branch in any appeal to the Inter-American Court 
of Human Rights; Guzman\'s attorney has already stated to the 
press that he would appeal the court\'s decision to 
international courts. END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: Textile Industry Fears End of MultiFiber Agreement 
 
REF: A) 04 Lima 5816     B) 04 Lima 5445 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  The Peruvian Government fears that the 
termination of the World Trade Organization\'s MultiFiber 
Agreement (MFA) on January 1 will limit the Peruvian textile 
industry\'s ability to compete on both the domestic and 
international markets.  The textile industry accounted for 
approximately 10 percent of exports in 2004 and its leaders 
are politically well connected.  The GOP in October 
implemented temporary textile safeguards on 20 specific 
products in an effort to protect its domestic market.  The 
real challenge to Peru, however, is not in protecting the 
domestic market but rather in ensuring Peru\'s international 
competitiveness, as Chinese garment exports may threaten 
Peru\'s textile trade.  End Summary. 
 
Peruvian Textile Industry 
------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Peru has a vibrant textile and apparel sector, which 
has grown almost 25 percent since the implementation of 
ATPDEA in 2002.  According to Ministry of Trade and Tourism 
(Mincetur) estimates, over 150,000 individuals are gainfully 
employed in the Peruvian textile sector.  The industry 
manufactures many types of clothing, including high-end pima 
cotton shirts and pants as well as standard quality apparel. 
The textile industry uses both imported and locally produced 
cotton and wool in its products.  Local textile officials 
argue that by using first-rate Peruvian grown cotton and 
wool, they produce higher-quality apparel than other 
countries, giving them a unique niche in the international 
textile market. 
 
3. (U) Textile and apparel products account for 
approximately 10 percent of Peru\'s exports.  Through January 
- October 2004, Peru exported $883.3 million in textiles and 
apparel, Peru\'s fourth-largest export.  According to 
Mincetur, 63 percent ($516 million) of Peruvian textile 
exports in 2003 went to the United States (which only 
accounted for two percent of U.S. textile imports).  The 
export of textiles to the United States has increased in 
recent years, due primarily to ATPDEA benefits.  Exports 
grew 21 percent from 2002-2003.

*Through October 2004 
 
Protecting the Domestic Market 
------------------------------ 
 
4. (U) GOP officials fear that the January 1, 2005 
termination of the MultiFiber Agreement (MFA) will threaten 
the ability of its textile industry to compete both 
domestically and internationally.  Peru has already faced 
increasing competition from China in its domestic market; 
textile imports from China tripled from $6.0 million in 1997 
to $17.6 million in 2003.  The Ministry of Labor estimates 
the industry has lost approximately 40,000 jobs since 2000. 
 
5. (SBU) In an effort to protect the domestic market from a 
potential flood of Chinese products, the GOP in October 
imposed temporary safeguards on 20 sensitive products, 
including shirts, pants, sweaters, coats and jackets, t- 
shirts, and sheets.  (Note: These safeguards are an 
extension of the safeguards implemented in November 2003 on 
106 Chinese products.  End note.)  These items, which 
represented 48 percent of Peru\'s total textile imports from 
China in 2003, will be subject to a tax of 12-28 percent, 
depending on the item, upon entry.  Peru is, to date, the 
only country in the world to impose textile safeguard 
measures against China.  The GOP, however, has yet to 
enforce the new safeguards.  GOP officials have also 
mentioned the possibility of negotiating a bilateral accord 
with China on preferential tariffs when Vice President Zeng 
Qinghong visits Lima in late January. 
 
Fear the Dragon: China 
Threatens Peruvian Exports 
-------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Several local consulting firms conducted impact 
analysis on the apparel safeguards and concluded that there 
is no clear evidence that Chinese products will damage the 
local industry.  They did, however, indicate that Chinese 
exports to the United States and the European Union could 
displace Peruvian textile exports.  According to 
Macroconsult, the textile industry could lose as much as 30 
percent of sales to the United States in 2005 and as many as 
50,000 jobs over the next three years.  Although the textile 
industry produces high-quality products, the overall cost of 
Peruvian textiles is 40-50 percent higher than Chinese 
costs. 
 
7. (SBU) Guillermo Arbe, Chief Global Analyst at Apoyo 
Consultants, told us December 15 that he believes Peru will 
have zero growth in textile exports in 2005.  The damage, he 
said, will occur in several ways.  First, China, with 50 
percent lower production costs, will increase production and 
sell its lower-priced basic apparel products on the world 
market.  Even though 45 percent of Peruvian textile 
production is basic apparel, the industry\'s higher prices 
will likely make it unable to compete effectively against 
Chinese products.  Second, other textile producing countries 
displaced by China may shift their production to higher- 
quality products, threatening Peru\'s niche market.  Thus, 
competition will come from not only China, but from other 
textile producing countries. 
 
Some Government Officials Confident 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Although the textile industry fears the worst, GOP 
officials have gone on record, confidently stating that Peru 
should not feel threatened by Chinese competition.  Ministry 
of Production officials argue that Peruvian production of 
high-quality goods (made from pima and tanguis cotton and 
alpaca wool) place Peruvian textiles in a different class 
than lower-quality Chinese products.  Ministry of Production 
officials argue that the textile industry should focus on 
exporting higher-quality products to stave off Chinese 
competition. 
 
9. (U) GOP officials emphasize that Chinese-imposed export 
duties on 148 specific items of clothing and textiles show 
serious effort on the part of the Chinese government to 
limit the competitive threat to other textile-producing 
economies.  Officials are also confident that other 
countries, including the U.S. and the EU, may impose their 
own safeguards, thus guaranteeing market access for Peruvian 
products. 
 
Need for Improved Efficiency, Competitiveness 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
10. (SBU) Mincetur officials explain that in order to 
compete with China in the long term, Peru needs to improve 
its competitiveness.  Julio Chan, APEC Director at Mincetur, 
informed us December 27 that the textile industry must 
develop more efficient techniques, update machinery, and 
focus on producing higher-quality products.  The industry, 
he complained, wants government protection so that it does 
not have to implement any necessary and costly changes. 
Unfortunately, without industry-led change, he continued, 
the textile industry may die a quick death. 
 
11. (SBU) Chan also indicated that, to improve Peru\'s 
overall competitiveness, the GOP must undertake a broad 
effort to improve the quality of its seaports, which have 
some of the highest rates in the Western Hemisphere, and 
reduce the high average costs of labor (currently $1.68 an 
hour compared to $.69/hour in China). 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
12. (SBU) Peru is the only country to date that has placed 
safeguards on Chinese products.  Although protecting the 
domestic industry is important, in the post-MFA world the 
GOP must now focus on ways to improve the competitiveness of 
Peruvian textiles on the international market.  Without key 
improvements, it is likely the textile industry could lose 
up to a third of its export sales.
