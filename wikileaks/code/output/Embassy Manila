1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  DURING JULY 12 LUNCHEON MEETING WITH POLOFF, 
RETIRED DE LA SALLE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR JOEL DE LOS 
SANTOS DESCRIBED THE FUTURE PROSPECTS OF PEACE WITH THE 
MUSLIM COMMUNITY AS LESS THAN ENCOURAGING.  HE FELT THAT A 
MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF MUSLIM 
CULTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INDIGENOUS MUSLIM 
SOCIETIES ON THE PART OF MAIN-LINE POLITICAL LEADERS, BOTH 
MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN.  DE LOS SANTOS WAS AWARE OF HOUSE 
SPEAKER DE VENECIA\'A EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF COL. QADHAFI AND 
CLAIMED THAT LIBYA HAD DIRECTED FUNDS TO PRESIDENT RAMOS\' 
1992 CAMPAIGN.  HE SAID HE HAD COMPLETED A STUDY OF THE 
PEACE PROCESS COMMISSIONED BY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
JOSE ALMONTE, AND CONCLUDED THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WOULD PROBABLY NOT 
PRODUCE A LASTING PEACE WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. END 
SUMMARY 
 
3.  POLOFF INVITED DE LOS SANTOS TO LUNCH TO CONTINUE AN 
ACQUAINTANCE BEGUN THE PREVIOUS WEEK AT THE FIRST 
CONFERENCE ON THE MUSLIM FUTURE (SEE REFTEL).  DE LOS 
SANTOS IS A FORMER PROFESSOR AT DE LA SALLE UNIVERSITY 
SPECIALIZING IN ISLAMIC AFFAIRS WHO NOW WORKS AS A 
CONSULTANT.  HE CLAIMED TO BE CLOSE TO ALL FACETS OF THE 
MUSLIM COMMUNITY, INCLUDING \"BOTH ABOVE GROUND AND 
UNDERGROUND\" SECTORS. 
 
4.  DISCUSSING THE CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH AN EXTREMIST 
INSURGENCY IN THE SOUTH, DE LOS SANTOS SAID THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT HAD LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS REALLY 
HAPPENING IN THE MUSLIM REGIONS.  THE INSURGENTS HAVE BEEN 
LABELED \"ABU SAYYAF\" BY THE MEDIA, BUT THAT ORGANIZATION 
IS JUST THE SURFACE MANIFESTATION OF A MORE PROLONGED 
PROCESS OF THE INSEEPAGE OF ISLAMIC THINKING BOTH AMONG 
THE MUSLIM POPULATION AND ITS POLITICAL LEADERS.  THE 
TENDENCY TO BRAND ALL ENEMIES WITH THE SAME BRUSH FAILED 
TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE MANY DIFFERENCES WITHIN ISLAM; FOR 
EXAMPLE, HE SAID THAT THE LIBYAN BRAND OF \"LITTLE GREEN 
BOOK ISLAM\" IS REGARDED WITH CONTEMPT BY PHILIPPINE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS AS WELL AS MANY OF THEIR MUSLIM BRETHREN 
IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  HE REFERRED TO THE LARGER PHENOMENON 
OF INCREASED ISLAMIC CONSCIOUSNESS AND BUILDING OF 
FUNDAMENTALIST MUSLIM COMMUNITIES AS AS THE \"MOVEMENT\" AND 
SAID IT WAS CONNECTED TO THE EGYPTIAN-BASED MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD SINCE 1988.  EXPOSURE TO ISLAMIC CULTURE 
THROUGH EXPOSURE TO AND EDUCATION IN MUSLIM COUNTRIES HAS 
SINCE THE 1960\'S AWAKENED THE PREVIOUSLY SLEEPY ISLAMIC 
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BANGSA MORO (MUSLIM PEOPLE) OF THE 
PHILIPPINES. 
 
5.  THERE WERE ALSO HUNDREDS OF MUSLIM TEACHERS WORKING AS 
\"TABLEEGH\" -- IN ESSENCE, ISLAMIC MISSIONARIES -- ALL OVER 
MINDANAO.  SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN HAVE ALSO 
BEEN SENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OF TRAINING IN ARAB 
COUNTRIES.  THE GENERAL TREND WAS AWAY FROM SECULARIZATION 
-- PRECISELY THAT TENDENCY REPRESENTED BY THE MORO 
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WITH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT 
WAS CONDUCTING PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.  IN HIS ESTIMATION, 
ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF TODAY\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY REFLECTS 
\"FUNDAMENTALIST\" VIEWS, ABOUT 20 PERCENT SECULAR ONES, AND 
THE REMAINDER IS IN THE MIDDLE.  IN COMPARISON, HE 
ESTIMATED THE MUSLIM LEADERSHIP AS DIVIDED ABOUT 40 
PERCENT EVENLY BETWEEN SECULARISTS AND FUNDAMENTALISTS, 
WITH THE REMAINDER IN THE MIDDLE. 
 
6.  ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, A NUMBER OF MUSLIMS SENT 
TO ASSIST THE \"MOVEMENT\" WHO HAVE BEEN DETAINED BY POLICE 
AND IDENTIFIED AS \"JORDANIANS\" ARE ACTUALLY PALESTINIANS, 
AND THOSE PARTIAL TO HAMAS RATHER THAN THE PLO.  HE IS IN 
TOUCH WITH SOME OF THEIR COMPATRIOTS IN MANILA WHO ARE 
DEGREE CANDIDATES AT LOCAL UNIVERSITIES.  THEY ARE PART OF 
A GROWING WORLD-WIDE ISLAMIC MOVEMENT THAT SEEKS TO CREATE 
MUSLIM COMMUNITIES GOVERNED BY MUSLIM LAW.  DE LOS SANTOS 
SAID THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A SEPARATE 
MUSLIM STATE.  THE MOVEMENT HAS SET UP A NUMBER OF LOCAL 
SELF-HELP ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES WHERE THE 
GOVERNMENT IS WEAK, SUCH AS LOCAL HEALTH CARE. MONEY FOR 
THEIR ACTIVITIES WAS \"NO PROBLEM.\" 
 
7.  DE LOS SANTOS DISCLOSED THAT JOSE ALMONTE, THE 
PRESIDENT\'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, HAD ASKED HIM LAST 
FEBRUARY TO WRITE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PEACE PROCESS AND 
WHERE IT WAS HEADING.  HE SAID ALMONTE IS A CLOSE FRIEND 
WHO WAS A MEMBER OF THE SAME UNIVERSITY GRADUATING CLASS. 
ALMONTE\'S LETTER, THE ORIGINAL OF WHICH DE LOS SANTOS 
SHOWED POLOFF, ASKED HIM TO ANALYZE THE BASIC POLITICAL 
STRUCTURES IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, LIKELIHOOD OF COMING 
TO AN AGREEMENT, AND STEPS THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT TAKE.  DE 
LOS SANTOS TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE STUDY, BUT 
SAID HE PULLED SOME OF HIS PUNCHES IN THE FINAL REPORT. 
SUMMARIZING HIS FINDINGS, HE EXPRESSED DOUBTS THAT THE 
MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (MNLF) WOULD BE COMPETENT 
ENOUGH TO HOLD POWER IF GRANTED IT THROUGH THE PEACE 
PROCESS, AND DOUBTED THAT THE MNLF IN ANY CASE COULD 
NEGOTIATE PEACE ON BEHALF OF ALL FILIPINO MUSLIMS, SINCE 
THE MNLF IS REALLY \"PAST HISTORY\" THAT IS BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY IRRELEVANT AND LOOKED UPON AS A SURROGATE FOR 
THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
8. IN DISCUSSING HOUSE SPEAKER JOSE DE VENECIA, DE LOS 
SANTOS HAD STRONG WORDS FOR THIS \"DEMAGAGOIC POLITICIAN.\" 
HE SAID DE VENECIA HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN SHADY DEALINGS IN 
BOTH LIBYA AND IRAQ INVOLVING CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS FOR 
HIS FIRM, AND HAD TRIED TO \"REPAY\" HIS LIBYAN BENEFACTORS 
BY ACTING AS THEIR FRONT MAN AND ERRAND BOY.  THE LIBYANS 
THOUGHT THEY COULD USE DE VENECIA\'S AID IN ENLISTING 
PRESIDENT FIDEL RAMOS, WITH HIS EXCELLENT AMERICAN 
CONTACTS, AS A WEDGE IN HELPING END LIBYA\'S DIPLOMATIC 
ISOLATION IN THE WEST.  (EMBASSY HAS REPORTED EXTENSIVELY 
ON DE VENECIA\'S EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF COL. QADHAFI).  IT 
WAS A WELL-KEPT SECRET, ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, THAT 
RAMOS HAD RECEIVED FIVE MILLION PESOS (ABOUT DOLS 200,000) 
FROM THE LIBYANS TO FINANCE HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN IN 
1992. 
 
9.  ACCORDING TO DE LOS SANTOS, MOST RESIDENT AMBASSADORS 
OF ISLAMIC COUNTRIES ARE MODERATES, INCLUDING LIBYAN RAJAB 
ABDULAZIZ AZZAROUQ, WHO HE SAID IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE 
PH.D. DEGREE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE 
PHILIPPINES.  HE SAID THAT ABOUT A QUARTER OF LIBYAN 
LARGESSE TO THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY COMES THROUGH THE \"BACK 
DOOR.\" 
 
10.  COMMENT:  DE LOS SANTOS\' VIEWS REPRESENT THOSE OF A 
MUSLIM INTELLECTUAL WITH CLOSE TIES TO NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISOR ALMONTE.  HIS NEGATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CHANCES 
FOR SUCCESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS WITH THE MNLF IS NOT 
REFLECTED IN THE PROGRESS BEING SHOWN TO DATE, ALTHOUGH 
THE QUESTION WHICH HE ADDRESSES -- WHETHER A SUCCESSFUL 
NEGOTIATION WITH THE MNLF WILL USHER IN A LONG-TERM PERIOD 
OF PEACE WITH THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY -- IS ONE THAT NEEDS TO 
BE ADDRESSED.  HIS WARNING ABOUT THE TREND AWAY FROM 
SECULARIZATION AND TOWARD TRADITIONALISM BY YOUNG MUSLIMS 
IS A POINT WE HAVE HEARD BEFORE.  HOWEVER, THE VIEW HELD 
BY MANY OF OUR INTERLOCUTORS IS THAT THE TREND IS TOWARD 
INCREASING RELIGIOUS CONSCIOUSNESS RATHER THAN VIOLENT 
FUNDAMENTALISM.  THIS TREND OBVIOUSLY DESERVES CAREFUL 
WATCHING, AS DO THE DEVELOPING TIES BETWEEN FILIPINO 
MUSLIMS AND THEIR BRETHREN IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

SUBJECT: MISUARI TO USG \"I\'M NO TERRORIST\" 
 
REF: MANILA 6730 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR STEVEN E. ZATE, REASONS: 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: NUR MISUARI HAS DECIDED TO REVERT BACK TO HIS 
ARMED SEPARATIST WAYS, BUT HAS SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE 
UNITED STATES CLAIMING THAT HE WILL NEVER BE A TERRORIST AND 
HAS NOT ALLIED HIS FORCES WITH THOSE OF THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP 
(ASG).  A MISUARI EMISSARY HAS TOLD EMBASSY MANILA HE INTENDS 
TO BE AN \"HONEST ADVERSARY\" IN HIS RENEWED FIGHT AGAINST THE 
PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT (GOP) BUT EVEN NOW IS OPEN TO A REAL 
AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS FOR \"TRUE AUTONOMY\" FOR MUSLIMS.  THE 
MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT - MISUARI FACTION (MNLF-MF) 
MESSENGER INDICATED THAT A FULL POLITICAL AND MILITARY 
ALLIANCE BETWEEN HIS GROUP AND THE ARMED MORO ISLAMIC 
LIBERATION FRONT (MILF) IS IMMINENT AND THAT JOINT MNLF/MILF 
OPERATIONS AGAINST GOP FORCES HAVE ALREADY BEGUN IN CENTRAL 
MINDANAO.  THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR - MISUARI HAS AGAIN TAKEN TO 
THE HILLS BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO MAKE AN ENEMY OF THE U.S. 
OR BE BRANDED AS AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST.  END SUMMARY. 
 
GET THE WORD TO THE US 
---------------------- 
 
2. (C) POLOFF MET NOVEMBER 21 WITH REV. ABSALOM CERVEZA, A 
PROTESTANT CLERGYMAN WHO IS DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTHERN 
PHILIPPINES COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT (SPCPD) UNDER 
THE OFFICE PHILIPPINE PRESIDENT MACAPAGAL-ARROYO.  CERVEZA IS 
A LONG TIME SUPPORTER OF MNLF FOUNDER (AND SUSPENDED MUSLIM 
REGIONAL GOVERNOR) NUR MISUARI AND WAS APPOINTED BY MISUARI 
TO HIS CURRENT POST.  HE REMAINS MISUARI\'S CLOSE CONFIDANT 
AND ADVISOR.  CERVEZA SAID MISUARI HAD ASKED HIM TO PASS 
SEVERAL MESSAGES TO THE EMBASSY AND THE USG.  HE TOLD US THAT 
MISUARI HAS DECIDED THAT THERE IS NO CURRENT HOPE THAT THE 
GOP WILL TRULY HONOR ITS COMMITMENTS TO GRANT TRUE AUTONOMY 
TO THE MUSLIMS - AS CALLED FOR IN THE TRIPOLI AGREEMENT OF 
1976 AND THE PEACE AGREEMENT OF 1996 SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES. 
SINCE THAT IS THE CASE, MISUARI HAS DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE 
HILLS AND LEAD HIS REJUVENATED MNLF FACTION IN THE \"ONLY 
NEGOTIATION THE GOP TRULY UNDERSTANDS - ARMED WARFARE.\" 
CERVEZA SAID THAT MISUARI, WHO REMAINS WITH HIS FIGHTERS IN 
SULU PROVINCE, WANTS THE USG TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT HE IS 
\"NO TERRORIST,\" AND \"HAS NO LINKS WITH THE TERRORIST ABU 
SAYYAF.\"  MISUARI\'S MAN NOTED THAT HIS LEADER HAS 
\"CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED THE ASG AND THEIR UN-ISLAMIC BANDITRY 
AGAINST INNOCENTS.\" 
 
\"IT\'S THE GOVERNMENT\'S FAULT\" 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (C) CERVEZA SAID THAT MISUARI BELIEVES THAT PRESIDENT 
GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO HAS RECEIVED BAD ADVICE FROM SEVERAL 
MEMBERS OF HER CABINET LED BY HER PEACE ADVISER EDUARDO 
ERMITA, SPECIAL PROJECTS ADVISER NORBERTO GONZALES, AND 
DEFENSE SECRETARY ANGELO REYES.  THESE THREE HAD CONSPIRED 
WITH MEMBERS OF MISUARI\'S MNLF CENTRAL COMMITTEE LED BY 
PAROUK HUSSIN TO OUST HIM AND MANIPULATE THE NOVEMBER 26 
ELECTIONS IN THE AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MUSLIM MINDANAO (ARMM) 
TO ENSURE A HUSSIN WIN.  ACCORDING TO CERVEZA THIS WAS THE 
LAST STRAW IN A LONG-RUNNING GOP CAMPAIGN TO DEMOLISH 
MISUARI\'S REPUTATION AND DIGNITY AND TO BRING HIM DOWN IN THE 
EYES OF HIS SUPPORTERS AND ALL MUSLIMS.  \"MISUARI IS A PROUD 
MAN AND WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS DISHONOR, WHILE AT 60 HE IS 
NOT YOUNG, HE IS OUT TO PROVE THAT HE STILL ENJOYS THE 
SUPPORT OF MANY MUSLIMS,\" CERVEZA SAID.  TO PROVE THIS, 
MISUARI HAS SENT HIS FAMILY OUT OF THE COUNTRY, HAS PICKED UP 
HIS ASSAULT RIFLE, HAS REFURBISHED HIS MILITARY COMMAND 
STRUCTURE, AND IS FINALIZING A FORMAL RECOMBINING OF THE MNLF 
AND THE MILF LED BY HASHIM SALAMAT.  (NOTE: SALAMAT BROKE 
WITH THE MNLF IN THE LATE 1970S AFTER DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
MISUARI OVER HOW TO PUSH FOR MUSLIM INDEPENDENCE AND A MORE 
ISLAMIC UNDERPINNING FOR THE SEPARATIST MOVEMENT.  END NOTE.) 
 ACCORDING TO CERVEZA THIS AMALGAMATION IS IMMINENT AND MILF 
AND MNLF-MF FORCES HAVE ALREADY COOPERATED IN JOINT 
OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ARMED FORCES OF THE PHILIPPINES (AFP) 
IN SULU AND IN CENTRAL MINDANAO. 
 
4. (C) CERVEZA ASSERTED THAT THE GOP SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT 
MISUARI WOULD JUST GO AWAY, AS THEY EXPECTED HIM TO DO.  \"THE 
MAN IS NOT STUPID.  HE COULDN\'T BE BOUGHT OFF WITH AN 
AMBASSADORSHIP IN SAUDI ARABIA OR TURKEY,\" CERVEZA SAID. 
\"NOW THAT MISUARI IS MAKING HIMSELF A MILITARY FORCE TO BE 
RECKONED WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS AT A LOSS TO KNOW WHAT TO 
DO,\" HE CLAIMED.  \"THEY HAVE NO PLAN AND HAVE LEFT MISUARI NO 
CHOICE BUT TO RETURN TO THE HILLS.\"  CERVEZA ADDED THAT 
MISUARI BELIEVES THAT HE WILL FORCE THE GOP TO DEAL WITH HIM 
AND HIS FOLLOWERS POLITICALLY TO ASSURE TRUE AUTONOMY ONLY IF 
HE NOW PURSUES THE MILITARY OPTION.  MISUARI\'S MAN INDICATED 
THAT THE GOP WILL NOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN ARMED MNLF AGAIN 
BECAUSE IT FAILED AT DEALING WITH UNARMED MUSLIMS WHO WANTED 
A STRAIGHT POLITICAL SHAKE FOR THE \"MORO NATION.\" 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
5. (C) HUBRIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PRICKLY MISUARI\'S BIGGEST 
FAILING, AND THIS HAS PROMPTED HIM TO TRY AND REVIVE HIS PAST 
GLORY AS A TOUGH LEADER OF AN ARMED SEPARATIST MOVEMENT.  THE 
GOP, IN TURN, UNDERESTIMATED HIS DETERMINATION TO CONTINUE TO 
BE A PLAYER.  A GENUINE MNLF (SULU-BASED AND MOSTLY ETHNIC 
TAUSUG) TIE-UP WITH THE MILF (MOSTLY CENTRAL MINDANAO-BASED 
MAGUINDANAOS AND MARANAOS) IS A DAUNTING PROSPECT AND SHOULD 
GIVE GOP MILITARY PLANNERS AND POLITICAL POLICY-MAKERS PAUSE. 
 MISUARI IS THE MAJOR POWER BROKER IN THE ISLAND PROVINCE OF 
SULU AND THE GOP HAS ITS HANDS FULL WITH THE ASG IN BASILAN 
TO THE NORTH.  AN MILF/MNLF ALLIANCE IS NOT A DONE DEAL 
BECAUSE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT LED TO THEIR SPLIT REMAIN. 
IN ADDITION, THE MILF LEADERSHIP REMAINS IN PEACE 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOP, AND WHILE THESE TALKS ARE 
PROCEEDING SLOWLY, THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD.  HOWEVER, THE 
OPENING OF ANOTHER SEPARATIST FRONT THROUGH MILF/MNLF 
COOPERATION IN CENTRAL MINDANAO WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR THE 
CREAKY, POORLY LED, AND RESOURCE-POOR AFP.  THE AFP STILL HAS 
TO CONTEND WITH A NAGGING COMMUNIST INSURGENCY IN SCATTERED 
PARTS OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND HAVING TO BATTLE ON TOO MANY 
FRONTS LEAVE IT STRETCHED EXTREMELY THIN.  PRESIDENT 
MACAPAGAL-ARROYO RETURNS TO THE COUNTRY FROM THE US AND 
MEXICO ON NOVEMBER 22.  THIS ITEM WILL BE AT THE TOP OF HER 
NOW EVEN MORE PRESSING SECURITY AGENDA.  WITH ALL THE RECENT 
PUBLICITY ABOUT US ASSISTANCE TO DESTROY THE ASG, MISUARI MAY 
HAVE WANTED TO EXPLAIN HIS MOTIVES IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID 
HAVING IS RE-ARMED SEPARATIST FORCES BECOME ANOTHER DIRECT 
(OR INDIRECT) US TARGET.  PROBABLY A WISE MOVE.

1.  (SBU) Dep Pol/C and poloff reviewed the Trafficking in 
Persons (TIP) Interim Assessment Report (ref a) for the 
Philippines in a meeting with Department of Foreign Affairs\' 
(DFA) Americas Division Director Marc De Borja on January 3. 
Dep Pol/C noted that the report had flagged areas of 
progress, including the GRP\'s successful efforts to promote 
awareness of the new anti-trafficking law through varied 
training initiatives and information seminars.  However, the 
GRP had to make more progress in addressing 
trafficking-related official corruption, as well as move 
forward with prosecutions and convictions in TIP cases.  De 
Borja promised to share the report with other GRP offices 
involved in combating TIP. 
 
2.  (SBU) Dep Pol/C reiterated U.S. support for GOJ efforts 
to tighten the screening process for visas to Filipino 
entertainers (refs B and C).  Many of those who receive such 
visas end up as victims of trafficking, and this must be 
stopped, he emphasized, while encouraging the GRP to welcome 
the GOJ\'s new \"Action Plan\" in this area and not try to 
prevent the plan\'s implementation.  De Borja acknowledged 
that many Filipino female \"entertainers\" in Japan ended up as 
trafficking victims.  Despite concerns about reduced 
employment opportunities for Filipinos in Japan, De Borja 
expressed confidence that the GRP would find a workable 
solution that would prevent trafficking, while allowing 
legitimate Filipino performers to continue working in Japan.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The President\'s new anti-corruption czar 
has requested Embassy\'s cooperation, which Embassy officers 
will provide in addition to ongoing coordination with the 
Office of the Ombudsman.  The GRP is making progress on some 
new high profile corruption cases, most recently charging an 
Air Force brigadier general with graft in a case involving 
the alleged fraudulent sale of military equipment.  The 
criminal case involving former military comptroller General 
Garcia is again moving forward after a break for the 
holidays; his court martial is scheduled to resume shortly. 
A Philippine court finally ruled against Ferdinand Marcos 
crony Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco\'s efforts to recover 
coconut industry funds he once controlled.  In addition, a 
U.S. Federal Appeals Court ruled against GRP efforts to 
control the distribution of USD 150 million in funds awarded 
to victims of the Marcos regime.  END SUMMARY.

2.  (C)  As President Arroyo informed Ambassador on January 3 
(ref A), Malacanang has now designated former justice 
secretary (current Presidential Legal Counsel) Mercedes 
 
SIPDIS 
\"Mercy\" Gutierrez to head a task force on corruption.  In a 
lunch with Legatt and DOJ attache on January 6, Gutierrez 
asked the Embassy to assist the task force.  Emboffs agreed 
to do so, while encouraging the task force to focus on some 
high profile agencies to investigate (notably Customs and 
Immigration) and then turn over the cases to the Ombudsmen to 
prosecute.  Embassy continues its own close cooperation with 
the Ombudsman and his staff.  (DCM will host a breakfast with 
Ombudsman and Staffdel Hawkins on January 7.)

GROUNDED 
-------- 
 
3.  (SBU) On January 4, GRP Ombudsman Simeon Marcelo filed 
\"malversation and graft\" charges against Air Force Brigadier 
General Vladimir de los Trino before the civilian 
anti-corruption court, the Sandiganbayan.  According to the 
charge sheet, de los Trino, commander of the Air Force\'s 2nd 
Tactical Operations Wing, ordered the May 2000 sale of four 
power generators at a base in Cebu in the central Philippines 
without authorization or proper use of established public 
bidding processes.  Two mid-level air force officers, Major 
Antonio Garcia and Engineer Nelmida Senen, as well as 
businessman Antonio Ularte were also charged in the case.  De 
los Trino and the other officers allegedly received USD 
16,000 (which they divided among themselves) from businessman 
Ularte for the assets, bypassing a prior public bid of USD 
24,000.  According to media, the Office of the Ombudsman 
acted upon information provided by the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines 
(AFP) in filing the charges.  If convicted, de los Trinos and 
his accomplices could face jail terms in excess of 20 years. 
 
---------------- 
AFP cases resume 
---------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) The criminal case involving corruption and perjury 
charges filed against former AFP comptroller Major General 
Carlos Garcia is again moving forward after a break for the 
holidays.  (Note:  See Refs b-d for additional background.) 
Preliminary hearings in the Sandiganbayan have now resumed. 
However, the Landbank, a Filipino financial institution, 
refused an order of garnishment issued by the Sandiganbayan 
on five U.S. dollar-denominated accounts held under the names 
of Garcia and family.  The Landbank froze Garcia\'s two 
peso-denominated accounts, worth nearly USD 120,000. 
Landbank Vice-President Rosemarie Osoteo, defending her 
company\'s decision, publicly stated that the Sandiganbayan\'s 
freeze order did not apply to the dollar accounts, which, she 
said, were \"confidential\" and could only be opened in cases 
of violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Act.  (Note: The 
bank secrecy laws in the Philippines are among the strictest 
in the world. end note)  The Sandiganbayan plans to challenge 
Landbank\'s decision.  Garcia\'s court martial is scheduled to 
resume hearings on January 11.  He remains in military 
custody. 
 
5. (SBU) Separately, the trial of former AFP Chief of Staff 
and comptroller Lisandro Abadia on corruption charges is also 
scheduled to resume shortly.  Abadia has also been accused of 
perjury and engaging in illegal financial transactions. 
----------------------------- 
Marcos-Era Cases Move Forward 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Representing long-standing GRP efforts to retrieve 
Marcos-era plunder, the GRP won a major victory when the 
Sandiganbayan on December 28 rejected motions for 
reconsideration of earlier decisions that awarded the GRP 
ownership of stock worth millions of dollars in San Miguel 
Corporation and the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB). 
According to Chairman Haydee Yorac of the Presidential 
Commission on Good Government (set up to recover the Marcos 
loot), this case was one of the top priorities undertaken by 
PCGG since 1986.  Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, a close ally 
of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, and his co-defendants had 
appealed the earlier decisions, claiming that they were the 
rightful owners of the stock.  The Sandiganbayan ruled that 
the defendants had bought the stock using funds derived from 
the \"Coconut Consumers Stabilization Fund levy\" -- known 
popularly as the \"coco-levy\" -- imposed during the Marcos 
regime and thus, the stock was owned by the public, in 
particular, coconut farmers.  The court also ruled that 
Cojuangco, who had large-scale control of the coconut 
industry during the Marcos years, had improperly administered 
the fund to his own advantage and did not have a legitimate 
right to own the stock.  Cojuangco and his co-defendants are 
expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. 
 
7.  (SBU) Separately, the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals for 
the 9th Circuit based in San Francisco on December 28 turned 
down a GRP motion that it be allowed to distribute USD 150 
million in funds seized for eventual disbursement to human 
rights victims of the Marcos regime.  The court upheld a 1999 
agreement between the Marcos estate and claimants meant to 
settle all outstanding claims by victims.  The court 
dismissed the GRP\'s claim to distribution rights, stating 
that the GRP was not a party to the 1999 settlement. 
However, most of the funds remain deposited in a special GRP 
account in the Philippines designated for agrarian reform. 
Presidential Press Secretary Ignacio Bunye on December 30 
called the ruling \"academic, because we are already holding 
the funds,\" while promising to earmark them for compensation 
for human rights victims as well as for land reform (pending 
enabling legislation).

expected to share what they learned via specified local 
projects and at a national \"networking\" conference.  The 
project appears worthwhile, though rather costly for the 
comparatively modest results sought.  Successful 
implementation of the project will assist in bringing the 
Philippines\' Islamic educational system into the mainstream. 
Integrating this effort with other ongoing USG projects 
advancing this same goal will better ensure optimum use of 
USG resources.  The Mission\'s Education Committee will 
coordinate in identifying promising projects for funding in 
FY 2005 under the Human Rights and Democracy Fund.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
New project 
----------- 
 
2.  (U) The DRL-sponsored \"Madrasah Teacher Training Project\" 
(Ref c) is now underway in the Philippines.  The USD 400,000 
project is funded by the ESF/Human Rights and Democracy Fund 
(HRDF) administered by DRL.  The Institute for Training and 
Development (ITD), a US-based non-profit NGO, serves as the 
project\'s implementing agency, and began the first phase in 
December 2004.  The project is focused on strengthening and 
improving the madrasah education system prevalent in Muslim 
areas of the southern Philippines.  Muslim educators will be 
exposed to U.S. educational practices and values during the 
course of the project.  An outline follows: 
 
-- Phase one:  ITD selects participants and builds support 
for the project among in-country partner organizations and 
international aid agencies; 
 
-- Phase two:  Twenty-eight leaders from madaris in Mindanao 
travel to the U.S. for a three-week study tour.  In the U.S., 
they attend presentations by university professors and other 
experts, and visit schools, religious organizations, and the 
Department of State and other government offices in 
Washington; 
 
-- Phase three:  The teachers apply what they have learned 
through programs in their schools and communities in the 
Philippines.  Support for these projects is provided in the 
form of \"mini-grants\" in the amount of USD 2,000 each.  The 
teachers will also share their experiences with other 
Filipino Muslim educators at a national \"Educator Networking\" 
conference. 
 
3.  (SBU) Poloff recently reviewed efforts to implement the 
project in meetings in Davao City, Mindanao.  Sally 
Habana-Hafner, Project Manager for ITD, confirmed to poloff 
that phase one of the project had begun and that selection of 
participants was underway.  At this meeting, Alastair 
Douglas, Deputy Project Director of AUSAID\'s Basic Education 
Assistance for Mindanao project (BEAM), also reviewed ways 
best to leverage the substantial efforts BEAM has invested in 
madrasah education in support of the current DRL project. 
 
4.  (SBU) Separately, members of the Association of Muslim 
Students at the University of the Philippines in Mindanao 
expressed support for the project as well as enthusiasm for 
combining secular education and Islamic values.  Ustadz 
Mahmod Adilao of the Ulama League of the Philippines 
commented that madaris offering a full range of religious and 
secular courses would be popular with Muslim students by 
helping them gain skills and find jobs.  (Ref B described the 
Philippine Department of Education\'s latest efforts to 
modernize the Islamic educational system by making it conform 
to national educational standards.) 
 
Other USG projects 
------------------ 
 
5.  (U) In the context of the State visits of President 
Arroyo and President Bush to each other\'s capitals in 2003, 
Mission had launched a 5-year USD 33 million education 
program focused primarily on Muslim Mindanao.  Led and 
administered by USAID, the program involves a range of USG 
agencies and local, U.S. and international NGO\'s.  The ITD 
project comes as a very welcome addition to the larger White 
House-based initiative in the Philippines.  To ensure maximum 
impact of our USD 400,000 investment through IDT, we will 
work to integrate that program with our ongoing educational 
campaign in Mindanao.  Our other projects to improve the 
level of education being offered in madaris include: 
 
-- The Mindanao English Language Education Enhancement 
Project (MELEEP), funded by the Public Affairs Section, 
trains English teacher trainers from the southern Philippines 
to teach more effectively.  As Ref b noted, English language 
is a key addition to the new unified madrasah curriculum; 
 
-- A senior English-language Fellow who speaks Arabic is 
working in the Department of Education on English teacher 
training, funded by the State Department\'s Bureau of 
Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA).  The focus of the 
training program is primarily in Mindanao; 
 
-- Assistance for the Comprehensive Educational Development 
of Mindanao (ASCEND Mindanao) trains and assists school 
administrators and ustadz from selected public schools and 
private madaris in the application of the improved curricula 
and materials.  The two-year project is funded by AID; 
 
-- Under the Tudlo Mindanao (Teach Mindanao) project, Peace 
Corps volunteers work with Mindanao teachers to develop and 
adapt teacher training sessions for English Content Based 
Instruction in math, science and information and 
communications technology. 
 
We advance all of these projects through our Country Team 
efforts, including advocacy with the national government, 
engagement with the ARMM and local government, vigorous 
public diplomacy (including student and teacher exchanges), 
and consciousness of the larger security environment, 
including the GRP-MILF peace process. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Successful implementation of the IDT project will 
further assist in bringing the Philippines\' Islamic 
educational system into the mainstream.  The project should 
yield good and valuable results.  However, at USD 400,000 for 
only 28 direct beneficiaries of a three-week U.S. tour plus a 
teacher conference, it comes in at the higher end of 
cost-to-benefit calculations compared to other USG programs 
now underway in Mindanao.  It is essential that such welcome 
projects be designed and implemented from the earliest stages 
in the closest coordination with current efforts to ensure 
the most effective use of USG resources.  For the 2005 HRDF, 
the Mission\'s interagency Education Committee -- with 
representation from USAID, Peace Corps, Public Affairs, and 
the Political Section -- will identify promising projects in 
country that fill identified gaps in current USG assistance, 
in close consultation with Department\'s DRL.

1.  (C) SUMMARY:  There have been 14 vigilante-style killings 
recently in Cebu.  Critics have implicated Cebu Mayor Tommy 
Osmena in the slayings based on his decision to create a 
special police squad to hunt down criminals.  Cardinal Vidal, 
local congressmen, Cebu\'s Vice Mayor, and human rights groups 
have raised public concerns about the killings.  In pressing 
his anti-crime fight in such extra-judicial directions, 
Osmena seems to be modeling himself after Rodrigo Duterte, 
the notorious mayor of Davao City, where there have been over 
60 vigilante-style killings in the past year.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------- 
Killings in Cebu 
---------------- 
 
2.  (U) There have been 14 vigilante-style killings recently 
in Cebu City.  The killings began on December 22 when two 
hooded men on a motorcycle shot dead a local criminal figure 
in a drive by shooting.  Four more men, each suspected by 
police of involvement in criminal activity, were gunned down 
in separate drive by shootings the next day; two of them were 
at work, two were asleep.  The pattern continued on December 
27 when a lone gunman allegedly shot to death three suspected 
criminals.  The killings continued on December 29 when five 
more suspected criminals were killed.  On December 30, a 
garbage collector suspected of involvement in petty drug 
dealing was also gunned down.  In several of the cases 
mentioned above, the victims\' body was reportedly marked with 
a sign stating, \"I am a thief.\"  Besides sharing a similar 
checkered past, each of the victims reportedly had spent time 
in Cebu\'s criminal detention center. 
 
3.  (U) Philippine National Police (PNP) Director General 
Edgar Aglipay has ordered an investigation into the string of 
killings.  The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) also 
initiated its own investigation. 
 
--------------------- 
Cebu Mayor Implicated 
--------------------- 
 
4.  (SBU) Critics have implicated Cebu Mayor Tommy Osmena in 
the slayings based on recent statements he has made. 
Immediately before the killings began, Mayor Osmena announced 
the formation of a special 24-member police squad tasked \"to 
suppress and prevent crimes\" on December 21.  Osmena noted: 
\"We have to be more aggressive.  It (the team) will seek and 
destroy criminal types of activity.\"  During his press 
briefing, Osmena noted that USD 200-400 bounties will go to 
police officials who \"permanently disable or neutralize\" 
criminals.  Osmena said the team would be called the \"Hunter\" 
squad.  The press later reported that Chief Inspector Arnel 
Banzon of Cebu\'s PNP SWAT team would supervise two 12-person 
groups led by SPO4 Rex Campos and SPO1 Serafin Asingjo. 
 
5.  (U) Cebu City Police Chief Melvin Gayotin, in recent 
remarks, strongly supported the creation of the team, 
clarifying that it would not practice \"vigilante justice,\" 
but rather help to \"find and arrest criminals.\"  Cebu 
Governor Gwendolyn Garcia on December 24 applauded Osmena\'s 
efforts to combat crime in the city.  When he was recently 
accused of sponsoring the summary killings, Osmena replied, 
\"I am not behind it.  But I will say I inspired it.  I don\'t 
deny that.\" 
 
------------------------- 
Protests Against Killings 
------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) Leading public figures have expressed concern about 
the killings.  Cardinal Ricardo Vidal of Cebu admonished 
Osmena and appealed to the new anti-crime unit to arrest 
suspects and not kill them, noting, \"I cannot understand how 
we can terminate the lives of men without the just process we 
are used to.\"  Vidal, who campaigned against the infamous 
\"sparrow\" (New People\'s Army) death squads in the 1980s in 
Davao City, also expressed his deep concern over the violent 
killings during a January 7 meeting with Dep Polcouns.  Raul 
del Mar, an influential Cebu Congressman, publicly echoed 
Vidal\'s concerns.  Rep. Eduardo Gullas of Cebu City\'s 1st 
District also protested, commenting that: \"the ends never 
justify the means.\"  Osmena\'s Vice-Mayor Michael Rama also 
came out against the vigilante-style killings.  Many 
Philippine human rights groups also protested the killings, 
urging the national government to investigate the situation 
fully. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
7.  (C) In pressing his anti-crime fight in such 
extra-judicial directions, Osmena seems to be modeling 
himself after the notorious Mayor Duterte of Davao City (see 
Reftels).  Duterte is clearly behind a group called the 
\"Davao Death Squad,\" which has been implicated in over 60 
vigilante-style killings in the past year.  We are not sure 
why Osmena is advocating such extreme measures.  The crime 
rate in Cebu has gone up, but not dramatically so.  Consular 
Representative in Cebu told poloff that he thought that most 
Cebuanos supported Osmena on the issue, however, as they see 
crime as a serious problem.  Hopefully, the investigation 
into the situation ordered by PNP Director General Aglipay 
will end the rash of killings.  Unfortunately, there have 
been similar investigations in Davao in the past, but to no 
avail.

1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  Over 50 congressmen have signed \"a letter 
of appeal\" calling for President Arroyo to pardon former 
congressman Romeo Jalosjos, who has been in jail since 1997 
for raping an 11 year old girl.  President Arroyo is studying 
the request, apparently in a ploy to win votes for her 
legislative program on fiscal reforms, but there is also very 
strong opposition.  According to a senior adviser, she will 
almost certainly not grant the pardon.  Even contemplation of 
pardoning a convicted child rapist highlights Arroyo\'s 
continued insecurity over her political position.  End 
Summary. 
 
--------------------- 
Pressing for a Pardon 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) With signatures of over 50 congressmen, a recent 
\"letter of appeal\" called for President Arroyo to pardon 
influential former congressman Romeo Jalosjos, who was 
arrested in 1997 and subsequent convicted for rape of an 11 
year old girl.  (Note:  See Para five for further background. 
end note)  Deputy Speaker Abdulgani \"Gerry\" Salapuddin from 
Mindanao and Representative Ernesto Nieva from Manila are 
leading calls for his pardon, along with Jalosjos\' brother 
Cesar and sister Cecilia, both current members of the House. 
Over the holidays, Jalosjos\' mother Angelina led her family 
in making an emotional public appeal to the President to 
grant clemency on the basis that his health had deteriorated 
while in prison. 
 
----------------------- 
Arroyo Considers Matter 
----------------------- 
 
3.  (C) Several sources have confirmed that President Arroyo 
is indeed studying the pardon request.  The President\'s 
Political Adviser Gabriel Claudio told Dep Polcouns on 
January 12 that Arroyo was \"closely reviewing the matter as 
she awaited further input from the Department of Justice.\" 
He confirmed press reports that Presidential chief of staff 
and former National Security Adviser Norberto \"Bert\" 
Gonzales, a known political ally of Jalosjos, was also urging 
her to grant the pardon \"on humanitarian grounds.\"  Claudio 
added that some of the representatives who had signed the 
request for a pardon had indicated that their support for 
Arroyo\'s legislative agenda -- notably, some key fiscal and 
tax reform measures -- could hinge on whether or not she 
granted the pardon. 
 
----------------------------- 
GMA -- Leaning Against Pardon 
----------------------------- 
 
4.  (C) However, Claudio assured Dep Polcouns that he did not 
believe that Arroyo would grant the pardon.  Most politicians 
and other people he had canvassed were fiercely opposed to a 
pardon to a convicted child rapist.  He noted in particular 
that Secretary of Social Welfare and Development Corazon 
\"Dinky\" Soliman and Senate President Franklin Drilon, both 
close allies of the President, had publicly voiced their 
opposition, along with leftist groups and civil society 
advocates for women\'s and children\'s rights. 
Pro-administration Congressman Ronaldo Puno confided to Dep 
Polcouns during a recent meeting that he also did not think 
Arroyo would grant the pardon.  He added, however, that there 
was \"a slim possibility\" that she might do so because of \"her 
political insecurities.\"  Puno remarked that a possible 
pardon of Jalosjos was questionable on legal grounds in any 
case because he had not served the required minimum prison 
time corresponding to his life sentence, and thus was not yet 
eligible for parole.  Puno added that he had met with 
Jalosjos in early 2004 and found the former congressman 
active and in good health, which he commented should indicate 
that humanitarian parole should not be a serious option. 
 
-------------------------- 
Further Background on Case 
-------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU) Jalosjos was already a long-time politician when 
police arrested him in 1997 for raping an 11 year old girl. 
He received two life terms sentences in 1998.  Jalosjos was a 
popular representative from Zamboanga del Norte province in 
Mindanao and the scion of a highly-influential family. 
Despite his conviction and imprisonment, he won reelection to 
the House in both 1998 and 2001 (his seat remained vacant 
during those terms).  The 65-year-old Jalosjos reportedly 
still wields considerable political power even from prison. 
He remains a key member of an influential regional political 
grouping in Western Mindanao called the \"Partido Demokratiko 
Sosyalista ng Pilipinas,\" currently chaired by Bert Gonzales. 
 In addition, Jalosjos, once a television producer and the 
owner of a luxury resort, enjoys strong support from many in 
the entertainment industry. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (C) That Arroyo would even contemplate pardoning a 
convicted child rapist highlights her continued insecurity 
over her political position and surprisingly weak base, 
despite nominal strong majorities for her Administration in 
both Houses.  Since winning last year\'s election in a close 
vote and amid much controversy over voting irregularities, 
Arroyo has appeared to lack confidence, a factor that became 
glaringly apparent when the kidnapping of Filipino worker 
Angelo de la Cruz in Iraq led to her decision to withdraw a 
Philippine peacekeeping contingent early.  In a similar 
anxious state, she seems to be reviewing Jalosjos\' case as a 
way to appease a large segment of the House and other friends 
of Jalosjos.  The good news is that she appears unlikely to 
grant the pardon request, especially in the wake of a recent 
informal agreement that Congress and the Senate could pass 
whichever tax bills they like as long as the net result was 
80 billion pesos more in revenue.  If she does, however, 
Arroyo\'s reputation for caving in to pressure will only grow, 
but this time with a blow to her popularity polls.
