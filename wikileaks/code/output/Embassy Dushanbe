1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY: WE KNOW LITTLE OF INDIGENOUS 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ORGANIZATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.  ON THE 
OTHER HAND THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF NON-AFGHAN MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD ORGANIZATIONS (\"IKHWAN\") OPERATING 
IN AFGHANISTAN USUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ONE OR MORE OF THE 
FUNDAMENTALIST AFGHAN TANZIMS.  WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING WITH THE 
CAVEAT THAT IT LACKS THE DETAIL WHICH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE 
ELSEWHERE.  END INTRODUCTION/SUMMARY. 
 
TRENDS IN IKHWANI ACTIVITY IN AFGHANISTAN 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE FOLLOWING REFLECTS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RECENT 
TRENDS IN IKHWAN ACTIVITY IN AFGHANISTAN.  WE BELIEVE 
THAT THERE IS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF IKHWANIS IN 
AFGHANISTAN WITH PASHTUNS COALESCING 
AROUND GULBUDDIN AND TAJIKS UNITING BEHIND AHMED SHAH MASOUD. 
EVER SINCE THE MURDER OF OVER 30 SHURA NAZAR COMMANDERS BY 
GULBUDDIN\'S COMMANDERS IN 1989, THERE HAS BEEN A MOVEMENT OF 
HEZBI ISLAMI - GULBUDDIN COMMANDERS WHO ARE ETHNIC TAJIKS 
TOWARD AHMED SHAH MASOUD.  THIS TREND ACCELERATED IN 1992-93 WITH 
THE GROWING CONFRONTATION BETWEEN GULBUDDIN AND MASOUD.  THE 
RESULT HAS BEEN GROWING INFLUENCE OF THE IKHWANI WING WITHIN 
MASOUD\'S FOLLOWERS IN SHURA NAZAR AND MORE GENERALLY WITHIN 
JAMIAT-I ISLAMI. 
 
4.  AS REF B SOUGHT TO ELABORATE, THERE APPEARS TO BE 
SIGNIFICANT DIVISION WITHIN THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AND 
WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST NETWORK 
GENERALLY OVER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER TO SUPPORT GULBUDDIN 
OR AHMED SHAH MASOUD. 
 
IKHWANI AND OTHER FUNDAMENTALIST ISLAMIC ACTIVITY 
IN AFGHANISTAN 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
(GAMA AL ISLAMIA) 
 
5.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA AND GAMA AL JIHAD HAVE HAD SENIOR PARTY 
FIGURES IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE THE EARLY-MID 1980\'S.  GAMA 
AL JIHAD HAS IN THE PAST HAD TIES TO (AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
FROM) THE ARAB FUNDAMENTALIST FINANCIER ASMANA BIN LADIN. 
GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS LONG UNDER THE DIRECTION/INFLUENCE OF 
TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO FUNCTIONED AS COMMANDERS AS WELL AS 
PARTY CADRE:  THESE WERE MOHAMMED SHAUQI ISLAMBULLI (WHOSE 
BROTHER ORCHESTRATED THE SADAT ASSASSINATION) AND TALUT 
FUAD KASSEM. ACCORDING TO ARAB JOURNALISTS BASED IN 
PESHAWAR, THE TWO GAMA AL ISLAMIA LEADERS HAD GOOD 
REPUTATIONS AS COMMANDERS AND LED FORCES OF APPROXIMATELY 
300. 
 
6.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS INVOLVED IN THE FAILED 1989 
OFFENSIVE AT JALALABAD, PLANNED AND ORGANIZED BY 
THE ISID.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE 
ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL 1992 DRIVE ON KHOST.  GAMA AL ISLAMIA 
WAS TIGHTLY ORGANIZED ON A CELL-LIKE BASIS AND SHUNNED 
PUBLICITY.  MUCH OF THE LITTLE WE KNOW OF THIS ORGANIZATION\'S 
OPERATIONS SUGGESTS IT TENDED TO CONFINE ITSELF TO 
NANGARHAR AND PAKTIA PROVINCES (THOUGH THIS MAY REFLECT 
THE LIMITED RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SOURCES). 
 
7.  OUR INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT TALUT WENT TO SUDAN 
IN 1992, AS RECENTLY AS FEBRUARY 1993, ISLAMABULI WAS 
IN JALALABAD WHERE (IN FEBRUARY) HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW 
TO A LONDON-BASED ARAB NEWSPAPER. 
 
8.  ANOTHER KEY FIGURE IN THE GAMA AL ISLAMIA IS 
SHEIK OMAR ABDUL RAHMAN, WHOSE ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING BROUGHT GAMA AL ISLAMIA 
INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION.  SHEIK OMAR OPERATED OUT OF 
PESHAWAR IN 1988 AND IN 1990 -- AND POSSIBLY IN INTERVENING 
PERIODS. 
 
(HADIMAT ISLAMI) 
 
 9.  HADIMAT ISLAMI, ALSO KNOWN AS THE \"SERVICE OFFICE,\" 
 WAS THE FIRST INTERNATIONALIST ISLAMIC OFFICE ESTABLISHED 
 TO ASSIST THE AFGHAN JIHAD.  ITS PRINCIPAL LEADER 
 WAS ABDULLAH AZAM, WHO WAS KILLED IN A CAR BOMB 
 ASSASSINATION IN PESHAWAR IN 1991.  THE SERVICE BUREAU, 
 WHICH WORKED WITH BUT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE 
 CONTROL OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, OPERATED REST HOUSES 
 IN THE PESHAWAR AREA FOR COURIERS AND FIGHTERS 
 TRAVELLING TO AND FROM AFGHANISTAN. 
 
COMMENT: 
 
10.  THE PUTATIVE CONCORDAT BETWEEN GENERAL DOSTUM\'S NORTHERN 
ALLIANCE AND JAMIAT-I ISLAMI (AND SHURA NAZAR) AGAINST GULBUDDIN 
POSES A DILEMMA FOR TAJIK IKHWANI\'S WHO MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR 
ETHNIC KIN AND THEIR IDEOLOGICAL BROTHERS -- THE IKHWANI\'S WITH 
GULBUDDIN.  MAKING THE CHOICE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IS THE 
BACKGROUND OF EX-NAJIBULLAH LEADER DOSTUM, WHOSE DEVOTION TO ISLAM 
IS UNDERSTANDABLY SUSPECT AND WHO IS SURROUNDED BY MANY WATTAN 
PARTY CADRE WHO SOUGHT HIS PROTECTION AFTER NAJIBULLAH\'S FALL.

SUBJECT: FORMER PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAJANOV NOMINATED FOR 
PRESIDENT IN WHAT IS SHAPING UP AS A REAL HORSERACE 
 
REF:  A) MOSCOW 22287, B) DUSHANBE 2003, 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE LENINABAD REGION HAS OVERWHELMINGLY NOMINATED 
FORMER PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAJANOV FOR PRESIDENT. HE JOINS 
PARLIAMENT CHAIRMAN RAHMONOV IN THE RACE WHICH WILL BE DECIDED IN 
THE SEPTEMBER 25 ELECTION.  ABDULLAJANOV, WHO SERVED BOTH THE 
OPPOSITION AND THE RAHMONOV GOVERNMENTS AS PRIME MINISTER, 
EMERGES AS A VERY STRONG CANDIDATE, POSSIBLY THE INITIAL 
FAVORITE.  OPPOSITIONISTS\' PUBLIC CONCERNS/THREATS REGARDING THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF A ONE-MAN RACE APPEAR MOLLIFIED.  WE SEE 
ABDULAJANOV LIKELY TO CAPITALIZE ON BROAD DISSATISFACTION WITH 
THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT WHICH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO STOP THE SLIDE 
INTO ECONOMIC CHAOS AND IS WIDELY RESENTED FOR ITS CORRUPTION AND 
HEAVY HANDEDNESS. PUBLIC CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AGAINST 
ABDULAJANOV WILL UNDERMINE HIS CAMPAIGN AS WELL, HOWEVER.  THIS 
IS A HIGH STAKES RACE IN WHICH BOTH SIDES ARE LIKELY TO PULL OUT 
ALL STOPS.  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING COULD BE DECISIVE IN 
DETERMINING WHETHER TAJIKISTAN\'S VOTERS HAVE A CHANCE TO CAST 
THEIR VOTES IN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION.  END SUMMARY 
 
3.  THE LENINABAD REGIONAL ASSEMBLY MEETING IN SPECIAL SESSION 
AUGUST 6 NOMINATED ABDULMALIK ABDULAJANOV, FORMER PRIME MINISTER 
AND CURRENTLY TAJIKISTAN\'S AMBASSADOR IN MOSCOW, AS THE REGION\'S 
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.  HE JOINS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
(AND CURRENTLY CHIEF OF STATE) EMOMALI RAHMONOV IN THE RACE FOR 
PRESIDENT TO BE DECIDED IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS SEPTEMBER 25 (REFS 
A AND B). 
 
4.  THE KEENLY WATCHED LENINABAD SESSION PRODUCED THREE 
CANDIDATES FOR THE REGIONAL NOMINATION: ABDULAJANOV, RAHMONOV AND 
A PROMINENT UZBEK BUSINESSMAN FROM KANIBODAM DISTRICT (YUSUFJON 
AHMADOV). AHMADOV IMMEDIATELY WITHDREW HIS NAME FROM 
CONSIDERATION SETTING UP A HEAD-TO-HEAD CONFRONTATION BETWEEN 
RAHMONOV AND ABDULLAJANOV.  IN A SECRET BALLOT, ABDULAJANOV WAS 
THE EASY WINNER COLLECTING 137 VOTES TO RAHMONOV\'S 33. GOTI 
CENTRAL MEDIA REPORTED THE LENINABAD ASSEMBLY RESULT ONE DAY 
AFTER THE ACTION BUT OMITED THE FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN A HEAD 
TO HEAD CONTEST BETWEEN ABDULLAJANOV AND RAHMONOV AND THAT THE 
ABDULLAJANOV HAD BEEN AS DECISIVE AS IT WAS. 
 
5.  THE LENINABAD ACTION CAME IN THE WAKE OF THE NOMINATION OF 
RAHMONOV BY THE KHATLON REGIONAL ASSEMBLY AND BY THE NATIONAL 
YOUTH FEDERATION (REF B).  BOTH BODIES HAD SENT FORMAL MESSAGES 
TO THE LENINABAD REGIONAL SESSION URGING THAT IT JOIN IN A 
CONSENSUS ENDORSEMENT OF RAHMONOV. 
 
6.  WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPOSITION REACTION TO ABDULAJANOV\'S 
NOMINATION, STATEMENTS ON THE EVE OF THE LENINABAD NOMINATION HAD 
INCLUDED WARNINGS ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF A ONE-MAN RACE FOR 
PRESIDENT.  LEADER OF TAJIKISTAN\'S REFUGEE ORGANIZATION IN MOSCOW 
AND OPPOSITIONIST HABIB SANGINOV WAS QUOTED ON RADIO KHORASAN 
(IRAN) AS HAVING STATED THAT IF RAHMONOV EMERGED AS THE ONLY 
CANDIDATE, THE SEPTEMBER 25 VOTE COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A 
REAL ELECTION.  OPPOSITION COMMANDER REDZUAN IN THE SAME 
BROADCAST WAS QUOTED AS STATING THAT IF RAHMONOV WERE THE ONLY 
NOMINEE THEN THE OPPOSITION WOULD CAST ITS VOTE WITH ROCKETS. 
THERE WILL BE MUCH ATTENTION PAID TO THE FORMAL AND INFORMAL 
OPPOSITION REACTION TO THE NOMINATION OF ABDULAJANOV, WHO WAS 
PRIME MINISTER IN THE BRIEF OPPOSITION GOVERNMENT (SEPTEMBER- 
NOVEMBER 1992) AS WELL AS PRIME MINISTER UNDER RAHMONOV (NOVEMBER 
1992 - DECEMBER 1993).  (ABDULAJANOV WAS ALSO MINISTER OF BREAD 
AND BRIEFLY PRIME MINISTER UNDER TAJIKISTAN\'S FIRST ELECTED 
PRESIDENT, RAHMON NABIYEV.) 
 
7.  STILL TO COME ARE POSSIBLE NOMINATIONS BY THE GORNO 
BADAKHSHAN AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS POSSIBLE 
ACTION BY DUSHANBE AND OTHER DISTRICTS IN THE HISSAR AND GARM 
VALLEYS.  THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE NEW POLITICAL PARTY, \"THE 
PARTY FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RENEWAL,\" AS WELL AS THE 
NATIONAL LABOR FEDERATION MAY NOMINATE OTHER CANDIDATES ALTHOUGH 
AT THIS POINT THAT APPEARS UNLIKELY. RATHER, IF THEY NINATE 
ANYONE AT ALL, THEY WOULD LIKELY LINE UP BEHIND ABDULAJANOV OR 
RAHMONOV. THE LABOR FEDERATION, DOMINATED BY KULYABIS, WILL 
ALMOST CERTAINLY BACK RAHMONOV. 
 
8.  COMMENT/ANALYSIS:  WITH ABDULAJANOV IN THE CONTEST, THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES A REAL HORSE RACE. 
WE ESTIMATE THAT ABDULAJANOV CAN COUNT ON STRONG SUPPORT IN HIS 
HOME REGION OF LENINABAD, AND AMONG TAJIKISTAN\'S UZBEK COMMUNITY 
WHICH MAKES UP APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.  OTHER 
MINORITIES WILL LIKELY ALSO BACK ABDULAJANOV.  THE FORMER 
OPPOSITION HOMELANDS IN THE GARM VALLEY, GORNO BADAKHSHAN AND THE 
GARM AND PAMIRI COMMUNITIES IN FORMER KURGAN TYUBE REGION WOULD 
ALMOST CERTAINLY PREFER ABDULAJANOV TO RAHMONOV -- IF THEY CHOOSE 
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTION.  THIS WOULD APPEAR TO LEAVE ONLY 
THE LESS THAN UNITED KULYAB CLAN AS CLEARLY IN RAHMONOV\'S COLUMN. 
 
MOREOVER, THE RAPID SLIDE INTO ECONOMIC CHAOS ENTAILING UNPAID 
SALARIES AND PENSIONS AND CURRENCY SHORTAGES WILL INEVITABLY CUT 
DEEPLY INTO ANY PRO-RAHMONOV VOTE.  ON THE FACE OF IT, IT WOULD 
APPEAR THAT ABDULAJANOV EMERGES AS THE EARLY FAVORITE IN THE 
RACE. 
 
9.  SEVERAL ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS MAY INTRUDE, HOWEVER. 
THE CIVIL WAR OF 1992 BEGAN AS A NORTH-SOUTH CONFRONTATION 
BETWEEN THE GARM/PAMIRI REGIONS AND THE NORTHERN (LENINABAD) 
REGION. THE LENINABAD POLITICAL LEADERSHIP DREW THE KULYABIS INTO 
THE STRUGGLE TRANSFORMING IT INTO A SOUTH-SOUTH CONFLICT WITH 
LENINABAD ON THE SIDELINES.  RECENTLY, GROWING ANIMOSITY BETWEEN 
KULYABIS AND UZBEKS HAD SEEMED TO BE PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR A 
RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN KULYABIS AND GARMIS, NOTABLY IN THE FORMER 
KURGAN TYUBE REGION AS POST HAS REPORTED (SEE DUSHANBE 1563). 
HOWEVER, RECENT VERY HEAVY FIGHTING IN TAVILDARA DISTRICT HAS LED 
TO NEW TENSIONS BETWEEN GARMIS AND KULYABIS (SEPTEL). 
 
10.  PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE HIGH STAKES INVOLVED IN THIS 
RACE, MAKE IT LIKELY THAT BOTH SIDES WILL BE PREPARED TO USE 
WHATEVER MEANS ARE NECESSARY TO SECURE VICTORY.  PHYSICAL 
INTIMIDATION (OR WORSE) TARGETING CANDIDATES, CAMPAIGN WORKERS 
AND VOTERS CAN NOT BE RULED OUT.  RAHMONNOV\'S ABILITY TO CONTROL 
THE MEDIA FOR HIS PURPOSES IS LIKELY TO BE EXPLOITED.  ALREADY 
HEROIC DESCRIPTIONS OF RAHMONOV AND SCANDAL MONGERING ATTACKS ON 
ABDULAJANOV HAVE APPEARED IN THE GOTI CONTROLLED MEDIA.  THE 
PUBLISHER OF THE PRO-ABDULAJANOV WEEKLY \"TOJIKISTON\" 
HAS TOLD HIS EDITOR THAT FOR TWO MONTHS THE PAPER WILL NOT 
PUBLISH.  HE EXPLAINED THAT IF THE PAPER TAKES A PRO-ABDULAJANOV 
POSTURE THE STAFF WILL BE AT RISK.  HOWEVER, THE PAPER WILL NOT 
SUBMIT TO PRESSURE TO BECOME A RAHMONOV MOUTHPIECE. 
 
11.  FINALLY, THE ROLE OF FOREIGN INTERESTS IS AS YET AN UNKNOWN. 
A LENGTHY PAEAN TO RAHMONOV BY RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SINKEVICH ON 
NATIONAL TELEVISION AUGUST 7 PRESUMABLY DOES NOT SIGNAL A PRO- 
RAHMONOV TILT BY THE RUSSIANS -- WHOM WE EXPECT TO BE EITHER 
QUIETLY PRO-ABDULAJANOV OR NEUTRAL.  BOTH UZBEKISTAN AND RUSSIA 
HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN THE ECONOMIC SCREWS ON TAJIKSITAN -- OR 
MAKE THINGS EASIER, TO INFLUENCE VOTES.  WE NOTE MOSCOW RADIO 
COMMENTARY AUGUST 7 DESCRIBED ABDULLAJANOV AS LIKELY TO GET MOST 
OF THE RUSSIAN MINORITY VOTE AS HE HAD CHAMPIONED BOTH USE OF 
RUSSIAN AS AN OFFICIAL LANGUAGE AND DUAL CITIZENSHIP FOR RUSSIANS 
LIVING IN TAJIKISTAN. 
 
12.  THE ONLY ASSESSMENT THAT CAN BE MADE WITH CONFIDENCE AT THIS 
POINT IS THAT IT APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE A HARD FOUGHT CONTEST 
FOR PRESIDENT.  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING WILL BE CRITICAL IF 
THERE IS TO BE ANY REALISTIC HOPE THAT THE VOTERS WILL HAVE A 
CHANCE OF MAKING A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE.

REF: (A) DUSHANBE 146; (B) DUSHANBE 90; (C) DUSHANBE 02 
 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: RICHARD HOAGLAND, AMB, EXEC, STATE. 
REASON: 1.5 (D) 
 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  At a small dinner party on January 29, First 
Deputy Chairman of the Islamic Revival Party Muhiddin Kabiri 
freely discussed the upcoming elections and his party\'s chances 
of success.  Drawing on his experiences in the last 
parliamentary elections, he opined that President Rahmonov would 
ensure that his party retains power by any means possible. 
Kabiri said that Rahmonov retains popularity, but the next 
generation of voters will look for concrete economic 
achievements before casting their votes for him.  Kabiri, like 
his party, looks to the 2010 parliamentary elections as the 
target date for possible change.  End summary. 
 
2.  (C) DCM participated on January 29 in a small dinner hosted 
by a German Embassy colleague whose featured guest was Muhiddin 
Kabiri, the first deputy chairman of the Islamic Revival Party 
of Tajikistan (IRPT).  Arriving in his newly acquired Mercedes 
Benz 500 series sedan, and more nattily attired than the rest of 
the guests, Kabiri declined offers of wine and champagne and 
settled for downing three or four beers during his stay of five 
and one-half hours.  Over a tasty Persian meal of fessenjun, 
coo-coo, and mastakhiar, Kabiri discussed the upcoming 
elections, the role of the IRPT in Tajikistan, and his own 
political ambitions. 
 
3.  (C) Kabiri said that the 2005 parliamentary election would 
not result in any change of power.  Referring to his own 
parliamentary campaign in Faizobad during the last election in 
2000, Kabiri said that after the first round of voting he was 
the front-runner with 48% of the vote.  Though he had the 
support of all the other opposition candidates for the second 
round, his votes totaled only 48.5%, and the candidate from the 
President\'s party, the People\'s Democratic Party of Tajikistan 
(PDPT), won. 
 
4.  (C) Kabiri said that after the first round results were in, 
some government officials approached him and suggested that he 
take the post of ambassador to Iran or to Turkey rather than 
continue a fruitless campaign to enter parliament.  He was 
specifically told that he had no chance to win the election. 
Kabiri demurred, though he knew the government would not allow 
him to win a seat in parliament.  A good friend who was leader 
of one of the small municipalities told Kabiri that President 
Rahmonov had called him in and ordered him to make sure that 
Kabiri did not win.  Kabiri\'s friend told him that \"I had no 
choice but to do the President\'s bidding, but because of our 
friendship I want you to know what happened.\" 
 
5.  (C) In discussing the upcoming elections, Kabiri said that 
the IRPT had a long-term outlook.  (See Ref A)  Realistically 
speaking, Kabiri said, the IRPT would not win even if the next 
election were fair and transparent.  (He hastened to add, 
however, that this would not/not be the case.)  The IRPT is 
looking to the next parliamentary election -- in 2010 -- as the 
one when a viable alternative to Rahmonov could emerge.  This 
would be the first election in which the post-civil war 
generation would participate, and their desire for increased 
economic opportunities would not be flavored by the desire for 
stability that overrides any democratic tendencies in most of 
the present electorate.  Nonetheless, the President is flexing 
his muscles and chipping away at the IRPT with the recent arrest 
of Shamsiddinov (Ref B). 
 
6.  (C) President Rahmonov, according to Kabiri, already has 
started his campaign for parliamentary elections.  By 
intimidating independent media, Rahmonov wants to ensure that 
not much light is shined on his election tactics.  (Ref C)  And, 
Kabiri averred, Rahmonov plans to subvert the international 
community\'s urging to reform the current election law by \"taking 
over\" the process.  Once he -- via the PDPT\'s control of 
parliament -- brings a draft election law before parliament, any 
reforms will only be to increase the President\'s hold on power. 
 
7.  (C) Kabiri readily admits that Rahmonov himself is popular 
with the electorate.  In a private and confidential poll 
conducted by the IRPT, Rahmonov was the favorite for almost half 
of those polled.  The second leading candidate -- who Kabiri 
would not name -- had support from 11% of those polled, and 
Nuri, the leader of the IRPT, garnered 8%. 
 
8.  (C) Regarding the future of the IRPT, Kabiri said that it is 
considering changing its name, perhaps removing \"Islam\" from it. 
Nuri decided that it might be time to do so and discussed this 
with the President.  Rahmonov told him that it would not be a 
good idea at the present time, and Kabiri characterized 
Rahmonov\'s reasoning as Machiavellian -- the President likes to 
hold up the IRPT to foreign visitors as the only legal Islamic 
party in Central Asia and wants to raise the specter of an 
Islamic \"Taliban style\" party to the electorate.  Kabiri also 
said that Nuri was ready to leave the leadership of the party 
and turn it over to him, but Kabiri said he was not yet ready to 
assume this position. 
 
9.  (C) In fact, Kabiri said he was prepared to support a 
candidate for president from any of the opposition parties, if 
only there were a viable candidate.  The only person who Kabiri 
believes could measure up is Rahmatullo Zoirov, leader of the 
Social Democrat Party of Tajikistan.  But as Kabiri said he told 
Zoirov, \"if only you were Tajik, you could be president.\" 
(Zoirov is an ethnic Uzbek.) 
 
10.  (C) Bio note:  Kabiri was open and frank in his assessments 
and commented how much he enjoyed the discussion.  Unlike most 
Tajik politicians, he relishes hard questions, and he answered 
them thoughtfully.  He spoke in Tajiki and English, and although 
he clearly preferred Tajiki, his English language skills were 
more than adequate.  He obtained his new Mercedes only two weeks 
ago.  He owns a company that imports Russian cars and cranes, 
selling many of them in Afghanistan.  One Afghan customer could 
not pay for the delivery of a crane and gave Kabiri the Mercedes 
instead.  It\'s likely that Kabiri will sell the car soon rather 
than risk trying to service it in Dushanbe -- the closest 
Mercedes Benz dealer is thousands of miles away. 
 
11.  (U) Kabul minimize considered.
