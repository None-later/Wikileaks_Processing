SUBJECT: COUNTERFEITING OF US CURRENCY IN ECUADOR 
RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT 
 
1. On July 29 Guayaquil Consul General and Central Bank 
General Supervisor Mauricio Pareja Canelos briefed some 
150 bank and media representatives on the features of the 
new fifty-dollar bill and its advantages.  Counterfeit 
money, most of which enters the country from Colombia, 
has been a relatively minor problem Pareja told the CG. 
 
2. An analysis, provided to the CG by Pareja, of 
counterfeit currency circulating in Ecuador covering the 
past three semesters revealed that the production of 
false fifty-dollar bills has fluctuated. However, with 
the arrival of this new bill, the Ecuadorian government 
is anticipating a steady decline. From the second 
semester of 2003 to the first semester of 2004 the amount 
of false one-dollar bills and twenty-dollar bills showed 
a considerable increase: one-dollar bills rose from 3,606 
to 6,691 and twenty-dollar bills more than tripled, from 
2,628 to 9,809. This dramatic increase suggests that the 
release of the new twenty-dollar bill in October 2003 has 
not yet contributed to a reduction in counterfeit 
production. In contrast, over the same time period 
counterfeit bills of all other denominations declined: 
five-dollar bills falling from 10,823 to 7,479; ten- 
dollar bills from 11,555 to 6,132; fifty-dollar bills 
from 59 to 26; and one hundred-dollar bills from 1,208 to 
957. According to the Central Bank the total number of 
false US bills encountered in Ecuador over the past three 
semesters was forty thousand units, which the bank 
considers to be relatively minor.

SUBJECT: NO SURPRISES IN GUAYAS AND GUAYAQUIL ELECTIONS 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: A pre-electoral assessment of Ecuador\'s 
largest city of Guayaquil and the surrounding province of 
Guayas suggests that the incumbent Social Christian Party 
(PSC) mayor and provincial prefect are likely to be re- 
elected in local elections on October 17.  Any result 
short of a PSC sweep of its political base in Guayas 
would be interpreted as a setback for the PSC at the 
national level.  President Guitierrez\'s Patriotic Society 
(PSP) candidates for mayor and prefect have almost no 
support.  Some opposition politicians have expressed 
concern about possible electoral fraud in Guayas, but 
their concerns appear to have been addressed. OAS plans 
to field eletion observers in Guayas to monitor the use 
of eletronic voting machines there.  End Summary. 
 
Background 
---------- 
 
2. (U) The province of Guayas has a total of 2,266,274 
eligible voters (26% of the national total), of which 
1,440,070 are in Guayaquil.  There are 10,016 voting 
centers across Guayas, with 7,211 located in Guayaquil. 
Voters will elect one provincial prefect, 28 mayors (all 
incumbents are up for reelection), 8 provincial 
councilors, 123 municipal councilors, and 37 rural 
councils representing 123,000 rural voters.  Guayas is 
one of five Ecuadorian provinces testing a new electronic 
voting system.  The system will be tested in the 
parroquia (parish) of Roca, which has 18,483 voters and 
93 voting centers. 
 
3.  (U) The 2000 election for prefect in Guayas was 
tainted by allegations of fraud against the PSC.  FE 
Humberto Mata who was then a candidate of the political 
movement Fuerza Ecuador, officially received almost 
400,000 votes, only 50,000 fewer than PSC winner Nicolas 
Lapentti.  Mata and his supporters charged that votes 
were stolen from him by manipupaltion of the vote count 
by the PSC although Mata told Guayaquil CG months ago 
that he did not believe enough were stolen to cost him 
the election.  The PSC currently dominates in Guayaquil 
and Guayas.  In 2002 presidential elections, PSC 
candidate Javier Neira (PSC) took 26% of the Guayas vote, 
followed by Alvaro Noboa (PRIAN) with 24%.  In the second 
round of presidential voting in 2002, Noboa won 67% of 
the Guayas vote to President Gutierrez\' 33%. 
 
Incumbents Favored in Major Races 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
4. (SBU) According to various polls, all of which are 
considered to have a significant margin of error, 
incumbent mayor of Guayaquil Jaime Nebot is ahead by a 
wide margin in the Guayaquil mayoral race. Polls sugest 
that Nebot, the popular Social Christian Party (PSC) 
candidate for re-election, will receive about 65% of the 
vote while his closest contender, TV personality Jimmy 
Jairala of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party (PRE), has 
about 20%.  The PRIAN hopeful, Fernando Barreno barely 
reaches 3%. For prefect, Nicolas Lapentti (PSC), who is 
seeking a fourth term, is leading in the polls with 51%. 
His closets contender is Humberto Mata from Fuerza 
Ciudadana with 22% followed by Gloria Gallardo of PRIAN 
with about 7%.  The candidates for mayor and prefect from 
Patriotic Society (President Guitierrez\' political 
party), Felipe Mantilla and Renan Borbua respectively, 
have single digit support of two percent or less. 
 
 
ELECTION PREPARATIONS UNDERWAY 
------------------------------ 
 
5.  (SBU) GUAYAQUIL CONSUL GENERAL MET WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF GUAYAS ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL (TEG) DR. WALTER AVILES ON 
SEPTEMBER 29.  AVILES BELIEVES THE IMPROVEMENTS HE HAS 
MADE WILL PRODUCE TRANSPARENT ELECTION RESULTS WITH 
LITTLE ROOM FOR CORRUPTION.  A BOARD POSTED AT EACH 
VOTING CENTER TO REGISTER VOTES WILL BE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL 
ELECTION MONITORS AT THE VOTING CENTERS AND WILL LIMIT 
THE POSSIBILITY FOR FRAUD BECAUSE THE VOTE COUNT FOR EACH 
CANDIDATE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL.  AVILES REPORTED THE 
TEG HEADQUARTERS WOULD BE OPENED TO POLITICAL PARTY 
REPRESENTATIVES OR CITIZENS WHO WANT TO WATCH THE PROCESS 
IN PERSON THROUGH TWO VIDEO CAMERAS AND TWO HUGE SCREENS 
INSTALLED IN THE TEG AUDITORIUM.  THE TEG HAS EXAMINED 
REPORTS OF POSSIBLE FRAUD IN THE LISTING OF GUAYAQUIL 
ELECTION MONITORES RELATED TO THE MUNICIPALITY AND 
PREFECTURE, BUT THESE WERE CLARIFIED AND RESOLVED THROUGH 
ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION SUBMITTED BY THE ACTING MAYOR 
AND PREFECT.  AVILES SAID MORE THAN 90,000 NEW VOTERS 
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED SINCE NOVEMBER 2003 AND GUAYAS 
PROVINCE WILL TRAIN 60,000 PEOPLE TO WORK IN VOTING 
BOOTHS ON OCTOBER 17. 
 
FRAUD CONCERNS BEING ADDRESSED 
------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE ELECTORAL FRAUD 
BY ROBERTO PONCE (PRIAN), VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE ELECTORAL 
TRIBUNAL OF GUAYAS (TEG), AND ENRIQUE PITA (ID) HAVE 
RESULTED IN THE SUPREME ELECTORAL TRIBUNAL (TSE) 
REASSIGNINIG SOME ELECTION DAY PERSONNEL.  PONCE AND PITA 
CLAIMED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PERSONNEL CHOSEN TO WORK AT 
POLLING PLACES ON ELECTION DAY WERE MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES 
WHO HAD BEEN LISTED AS EMPLOYEES FROM PRIVATE COMPANIES. 
AS A RESULT, THE TSE RECONSTITUTED LISTS OF 2,793 POLL 
WORKERS IN 27 CANTONS. 
 
7. (SBU) GUAYAQUIL CONSUL GENERAL ALSO MET WITH 
ANUNZIATTA VALDEZ, SUB-DIRECTOR OF THE USAID-FUNDED 
ELECTORAL WATCHDOG NGO \"CITIZEN PARTICIPATION (PC),\"ON 
SEPTEMBER 30. VALDEZ CHARACTERISED GUAYAQUIL AS A 
TOLERANT, RESPECTABLE, AND POLITICALLY MATURE CITY.  SHE 
DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY VIOLENCE ON ELECTION DAY AND, TO 
THE CONTRARY, BELIEVES VOTERS REMAIN LARGELY APATHETIC 
ABOUT THE ELECTIONS.  THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY CASES OF 
PRE-ELECTORAL VIOLENCE IN GUAYAS TO DATE. VALDEZ 
REPORTED PC WOULD FIELD 530 VOLUNTEER OBSERVERS IN GUAYAS 
ON OCTOBER 17 TO MONITOR THE ELECTIONS AND THE TALLY OF 
THE VOTES.  VALDEZ PRAISED THE WORK OF THE TEG AND NOTED 
THE TEG HAD FULLY COOPERATED WITH PC\'S OBSERVATION 
EFFORTS.  SHE ADDED THAT MANY CANDIDATES HAVE ALSO 
EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE INVOLVEMENT OF CITIZENS 
PARTICIPATION IN ELECTION OBSERVATION. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (SBU) THE POPULARITY OF THE PSC HAS GROWN IN GUAYAS 
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WITH THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF 
VISIBLE PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CITY OF GUAYAQUIL 
AND THE ROAD SYSTEM IN THE PROVINCE, AND WILL LIKELY 
RESULT IN THE RE-ELECTION OF THE TOP PSC CONTENDERS.  THE 
PRE AND PRIAN, AND EVEN MORE SO THE UPSTART PSP, HAVE ALL 
HAD DIFFICULTY MAKING INROADS AGAINST THE PSC\'S 
INCUMBENCY ADVANTAGE IN GUAYAS.  ANY RESULT SHORT OF A 
SWEEP IN GUAYAS PROVINCE WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS A 
SETBACK FOR THE PSC AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, WHERE IT 
REMAINS THE LARGEST SINGLE PARTY IN CONGRESS. 
 
 
9.  (SBU) WITH LITTLE DOUBT ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE 
MAJOR RACES FOR MAYOR OF GUAYAQUIL (JAIME NEBOT) AND FOR 
PREFECT OF GUAYAS (NICOLAS LAPENTTI), THERE IS LITTLE 
EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE ELECTIONS IN THE STREETS.  THERE IS 
ALSO RELATIVELY LITTLE CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE IN 
GUAYAQUIL ITSELF, ALTHOUGH SURROUNDING AREAS IN THE 
PROVINCE ARE BEDECKED WITH THE USUAL ELECTORAL TRAPPING 
OF BANNERS, PAINTED WALLS, SLOGANS AND POLITICAL RALLIES. 
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ELECTION MONITORING PROCESS AND WHAT 
APPEARS TO BE A COMFORTABLE LEAD FOR THE REELECTION OF 
LAPENTTI AS PREFECT MAY ELIMINATE, OR AT LEAST REDUCE, 
ACCUSATIONS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD THAT MANY IN GUAYAS 
BELIEVE PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE ROLE IN THE DEFEAT OF 
HUMBERTO MATA WHEN HE RAN AGAINST LAPENTTI IN THE LAST 
ELECTION. THE OAS PLANS TO FIELD ELECTION OBSERVERS IN 
GUAYAS TO MONITOR THE USE OF ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES.

1.   Summary:  As expected, the Social Christian Party (PSC) 
dominated election results in its heartland of Guayas 
province and the city of Guayaquil.  Jaime Nebot easily won 
reelection as mayor of Guayaquil and the incumbent PSC 
prefect, Nicolas Lapentti, turned back his challenger and 
won a fourth term as prefect.  Jimmy Jairala, the Ecuadorian 
Roldosista Party (PRE) candidate for mayor of Guayaquil, did 
better than expected; Citizens Force candidate Humberto Mata 
did worse.  The PSC made gains elsewhere on the coast, 
mainly at the PRE\'s expense.  To no surprise, President 
Gutierrez\' Patriotic Society Party (PSP) candidates lost 
badly.  End Summary. 
 
Prefect Race 
------------- 
 
2.   The official vote count is still underway but it is 
clear that Nicolas Lapentti was reelected as prefect for his 
fourth term with approximately 40.2% of the votes. 
Lapentti\'s closest rival, Humberto Mata from Citizens Force, 
won 20.5% of the vote.  Mata received fewer votes than he 
had in the 2000 sectional elections, when he claimed 
electoral fraud.  Gloria Gallardo (PRIAN), was the only 
woman running for prefect of Guayas, and placed third with 
16.8% of the votes.  PRE candidate Adolfo Bucaram, brother 
of disgraced former president Abdala Bucaram, received just 
10% of the vote.  Renan Borbua, PSP prefect candidate and 
cousin of President Gutierrez, received 5.2%. 
 
Mayor of Guayaquil Race 
----------------------- 
 
3.   In Guayaquil, Jaime Nebot (PSC) was reelected for a 
second term as mayor, defeating Jimmy Jairala (PRE) by less 
than had been expected. Some polls had suggested Nebot 
winning by a three to one margin, but the vote count to date 
indicates Jairala received about 29.6% of votes to Nebot\'s 
56.7%.  Jairala\'s relatively strong showing may have been 
due in part to his popularity as a journalist and television 
personality.  Fernando Barreno of the PRIAN was third with 
8.2%.  Felipe Mantilla, PSP candidate and former Governor of 
Guayas, received only 1.7%.  In total, the PSC won 16 out of 
28 mayoral races in Guayas, all of them with more than 35% 
of the vote.  The PRIAN and PRE won 4 mayoral contests each, 
the Popular Democracy Party (DP) won one, one was suspended 
and alliances won the final two races. 
 
PSC Gains Elsewhere in Coastal Region 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.   The PSC also gained in several other provinces within 
the Guayaquil Consular district.  The PSC consolidated its 
power in the provinces of Manabi and Zamora Chinchipe while 
winning the mayoral races in the important cities of 
Babahoyo and Quevedo (in Los Rios province); San Cristobal 
and Isabela (Galapagos); and in Azogues (Caar).  The PRE 
won the prefect and mayor races in Loja but suffered a 
bruising defeat at the hands of the PSC in the race for 
mayor of Machala (El Oro province) and in the race for 
prefect of Manabi, both once considered PRE strongholds. 
The Democratic Left (ID) won the prefect and mayoral races 
in Azuay.  The alliance candidate for the PSP and DP won the 
Galapagos prefect race and the Santa Cruz mayoral race. 
 
Disturbances Marr Voting Day 
---------------------------- 
 
5.   Press reported and police confirmed disturbances in 
five municipalities of Guayas on election day.  In El 
Empalme, disturbances caused the temporary suspension of 
voting.  In Duran, unidentified political party members 
tried to burn a school down where elections had taken place 
as a form of protest.  From that municipality, various PRE 
members drove to the Electoral Tribunal of Guayas (TEG) to 
report fraud against their candidate.  In Isidrio Ayora, 
PRIAN members also took semi-burned electoral ballots to 
Electoral Tribunal of Guayas (TEG) to report fraud.  Press 
also reported confrontations between the police and PRIAN 
members there.  In Samborondon, the president of a voting 
center was reportedly shot as the voting center was closing 
down.  Finally, the elections were suspended and will be re- 
run in the municipality of Simon Bolivar due to violence 
over possible electoral fraud. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
C O R R E C T E D  C O P Y  (ELECTION TERMS UPDATED) 
6.   Despite these isolated disturbances, which affected 
only a minor part of the electorate in Guayas, the elections 
elsewhere were generally peaceful and ran smoothly in most 
voting centers.  Guayaquil Consulate officials visited 30 
voting centers as OEA observers in Guayaquil and encountered 
no irregularities or violence. 
 
7.  The PSC consolidated and boosted its dominance in Guayas 
province and made some inroads elsewhere in the coastal 
region of Ecuador, at the cost of the PRE.  While some fault 
the PSC aging leadership or the PSC\'s overemphasis on public 
works rather than social welfare, many \"costenos\" clearly 
retain faith in the party and are attracted to decisive 
leadership of party strongman Leon Febres-Cordero and the 
can-do attitude of local leaders Nebot and Lapentti. 
Meanwhile, the PRE has slowly been losing ground in the 
absence of Abdala Bucaram and the glaring contrast between 
the results of PSC versus PSC rule.  While the fate of 
President Gutierrez\' PSP is still unclear at the national 
level, it clearly enjoys little support in this part of 
Ecuador.

SUBJECT: PSC SUPPORTS PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT 
 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  On October 25, the Social Christian 
Party (PSC) leadership decided to follow through on party 
leader Leon Febres-Cordero\'s post-electoral threat to 
pursue impeachment proceedings for misuse of funds 
against President Lucio Gutierrez.  PSC leaders tell us 
there are divisions within the party about pursuing this 
course, but also general reluctance to confront Febres- 
Cordero.  Given half-hearted PSC support, it will be 
difficult for the opposition to attract the 67 votes 
required for impeachment.  Unfortunately, this effort 
will divert the Congress from other urgent issues 
requiring Congressional action.  End Summary. 
 
Resistance within PSC 
--------------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) Nebot told the Ambassador and CG on October 26 
that the role of Congress has become a \"shameful 
spectacle,\" with only marginal influence on national 
policy.  He said that while President Gutierrez is bad 
for Ecuador, Vice President Palacios could be worse.  The 
Ambassador emphasized the costs of political instability, 
even by constitutional means, to Ecuadorian democracy and 
the economy.  Without openly criticizing Febres-Cordero, 
Nebot implied his disagreement with the impeachment 
tactic, saying the only thing that would move him to 
challenge the Gutierrez government would be any cut to 
municipal tax resources.  With international oil prices 
at an all-time high, he said, the Gutierrez government is 
less likely to do so.  He denied any desire to run for 
president in 2006, and criticized Ecuador\'s record of 
negotiating international agreements. 
 
3.  (SBU) PSC President Pascual del Cioppo told PolChief 
in October 25 that he and the grouping within the PSC led 
by Guayaquil mayor Jaime Nebot disagrees with Febres- 
Cordero\'s decision.  The Nebot group, which includes del 
Cioppo, Guayas prefect Nicolas Lapentti, and Manabi 
Congressman Simon Bustamante, believes ousting Gutierrez 
will damage national interests and is motivated by 
personal, not national motives.  According to del Cioppo, 
Febres-Cordero and his inner circle of Miguel Orellana 
and Javier Niera are behind the move.  Nebot and his 
supporters have been estranged from Febres-Cordero for 
some time; del Cioppo said the two men meet or talk only 
every two months.  Nebot and Lapentti were furious with 
Febres-Cordero for dominating their election night 
victory press conference.  Nebot did not attend the 
October 25 meeting; Febres-Cordero participated from New 
York by telephone. 
 
4.  (SBU) According to del Cioppo, Congressional support 
in favor of impeachment hovers around 60-62 votes, short 
of the 67 needed to impeach.  The PSC will start the 
process using its own 25 votes to create an impeachment 
commission.  The commission would be expected to submit 
its findings to the plenary the week of November 15.  A 
simple majority of 51 votes will be required for Congress 
to declare that the recommendation to impeach has merit. 
Debate and a final vote would occur by December 9.  Del 
Cioppo expressed some worry that the impeachment process 
might tempt Gutierrez to dissolve Congress. 
 
5.  (SBU) Divisions within the PSC over the merits of 
impeachment are already being reported publicly, 
undermining opposition support for the measure.  Some 
opposition members (even from Pachakutik, formerly 
solidly in favor of impeachment) have criticized Febres- 
Cordero\'s motives.  The President\'s wife, never a great 
defender of her husband\'s government, publicly declared 
in the wake of the PSC decision that the PRE and PRIAN 
will stick with the president.  She said the Socialist 
Party (PS) and Popular Democracy Movement (MPD), usually 
counted among the pro-impeachment opposition, might also 
do so. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6.  (SBU) The decision by the PSC to go forward will not 
cause the fall of the Gutierrez government overnight, and 
at this early stage seems unlikely to come to fruition. 
While opposition to Gutierrez is high, Vice President 
Palacios is not an appealing alternative to the 
opposition.  None of our PSC or ID interlocutors are 
(yet) proposing to pass over the VP in favor of a 
consensus candidate, which would circumvent 
constitutional order. 
 
7.  (SBU) However, at a minimum, the PSC\'s move to get 
the ball rolling on impeachment will divert the Congress 
from pressing issues and prompt undesirable measures from 
the Executive to attract opposition votes.  Both could 
negatively affect a variety of USG interests.  We have 
therefore emphasized to the opposition the high cost of 
political instability.  Nebot appears to have no stomach 
for challenging Febres-Cordero, and denies any desire to 
run for president in 2006.

SUBJECT:  BUCARAM BROTHER DENIES ANY DEAL ON RETURN 
 
REF:  GUAYAQUIL 00489 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  On November 16, former Presidential 
candidate Jacobo Bucaram shared his views with Guayaquil CG 
on the situation within the Roldosista Party (PRE) headed by 
his brother, ex-President Abdala Bucaram.  Jacobo offered no 
predictions about the return of his exiled brother from 
Panama and claimed no deals have been made with President 
Gutierrez to make this happen.  He denied any connection 
between the PRE\'s support for the President in his fight 
against impeachment, and Abdala\'s possible return.  As 
usual, Jacobo denied any further personal political 
ambitions and was most animated when discussing agricultural 
issues, expressing concern about the effect of an FTA with 
the U.S. on Ecuadorian farmers.  End Summary. 
 
Don\'t Look at Me 
---------------- 
 
2.  (SBU) As is his wont, Jacobo made it perfectly clear 
once again that he is not a party insider and has no real 
interest in politics.  Explaining his own relatively 
impressive political history, he said there were certain 
things he had to do out of obligation to his younger 
brother, Abdala.  He expressed a much stronger personal 
preference for his position as rector of the Agricultural 
University and as a private agriculturalist. 
 
No Deal on Return 
----------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Jacobo said his brother Abdala would return when 
he was ready to face the legal situation confronting him in 
Ecuador and suggested that this President could not offer 
sufficient insulation from possible prosecution on pending 
corruption charges. 
 
PRE Down After Local Elections 
------------------------------ 
 
4.  Bucaram acknowledged the PRE had lost considerable 
ground in the October 17 sectional elections (reftel), 
expressing neither surprise nor offering excuses.  Without 
Abdala, the party had no real leadership, he said.  When CG 
pointed out that PRE candidate for mayor of Guayaquil, Jimmy 
Jairala, had received nearly 30 percent of the vote running 
against popular PSC incumbent mayor Jaime Nebot, Bucaram 
replied that was because he was Jimmy Jairala, TV 
personality, and not because he was representing the PRE. 
 
2006 Presidential Contenders Don\'t Include Bucaram 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  (SBU) He stated that Alvaro Noboa (PRIAN) was clearly 
the front runner for the 2006 presidential elections, helped 
by his second place finish in 2002, large sums of cash and 
an organization that is already working to accomplish this. 
He said former vice president Leon Roldos would probably run 
again but he gave him no chance of winning.  Bucaram claimed 
that previous PSC candidate for President, Xavier Neira, 
would be a strong candidate, saying that among the 
contenders last time Jacobo found him to be the most 
intelligent and capable.  Bucaram also did not rule out 
another run for the presidency by PSC Chief Leon Febres- 
Cordero (LFC) who he said would also be a strong candidate. 
LFC has \"so much power in so many places\" that he could 
conceivably win the presidency again.  Jacobo said he had no 
interest in running and did not offer a name for a PRE 
candidate other than Abdala, should he return. 
 
 
Worried About FTA Ag Impact 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  (SBU) Jacobo also commented on the recently completed 
fifth round of the Free trade negotiations in Guayaquil. 
Although he believes that a free trade agreement will and 
should be passed, he also expressed his strong concern about 
the potential damage this will bring to the small scale milk 
and cattle producers of Ecuador.  He claimed that some three 
million people would be negatively affected by damage to 
those sectors.  He did not dwell on the issue of U.S. 
agricultural subsidies, simply stating that small Ecuadorian 
producers were not competitive and were not likely to become 
so in the short term. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Jacobo\'s apparent lack of personal passion for 
Abdala\'s return stands in stark contrast to the party\'s 
official devotion to such an event.  He strikes us as 
realistic about the prospects of any deal that might bring 
Abdala back to Ecuador, where he faces open legal charges, 
and gave the impression that his brother was not the kind of 
person to place himself at risk.  He gave no indication that 
any deal has been made with the President or his supporters 
nor does he give the impression that if one were to be 
negotiated he would be a player in the process.  Bucaram\'s 
favorable mention of Neira, was surprising to us.  Most 
Guayaquil observers that we have spoken to do not share such 
a positive view. 
 
8.  (SBU) Jacobo Bucaram bears the name but doesn\'t carry 
the flame of Abdala.  Although he agreed to run for 
President in 2002, he convincingly claims no real interest 
in politics; and his public and private actions support that 
position.  Jacobo does not act as a spokesperson for the PRE 
or seek out the press.  In conversation he only warmed 
noticeably when discussing immediate family, agriculture and 
his 200-plus hectare farm where he experiments with various 
crops and raises livestock.
