SUBJECT: IRAN TO PUBLISH HAUSA LANGUAGE MAGAZINE 
 
1.  IRAN WILL SOON BEGIN PUBLICATION OF A NEWS MAGAZINE IN 
THE HAUSA LANGUAGE, ACCORDING TO THE MAY 23 ISSUE OF 
GASKIYA TA FI KWABO, THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED HAUSA NEWSPAPER. 
THE MAGAZINE IS TO BE CALLED \"SAKON SAURA\", WHICH ROUGHLY 
TRANSLATES TO \"THE OTHER MESSAGE\". 
 
2.  THE UNATTRIBUTED NEWS REPORT SAYS THE MAGAZINE WAS 
CONCEIVED AS A MEANS OF PROPAGATING IRAN\'S SHI\'ITE 
MANIFESTO.  IT WILL FEATURE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IRAN- 
IRAQ WAR, THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF THE IRANIAN STATE, AND THE WORLDWIDE WAR AGAINST 
UNBELIEVERS.  IT PROMISES TO EXPOSE \"ISRAEL\'S SECRETS 
AND AMERICA\'S OPPRESSIVE TENDENCIES\" AND TO DESCRIBE 
IRAN\'S STRUGGLE TO STOP THEM.  NO DATE FOR THE BEGINNING 
OF PUBLICATION WAS GIVEN, NOR WERE ANY DETAILS PROVIDED 
ON THE MAGAZINE\'S DISTRIBUTION POLICY. 
 
3.  COMMENT:  IF THIS REPORT IS TRUE, THE NEW MAGAZINE 
WILL REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT NEW ATTEMPT BY IRAN TO GAIN 
INFLUENCE AMONG NIGERIA\'S MUSLIM POPULATION OF SOME 
FIFTY MILLION.  PRESUMABLY, THE MAGAZINE WOULD ALSO FIND 
AN AUDIENCE IN NIGER.  NONE OF THE LEADING ISLAMIC 
ORGANIZATIONS IN NIGERIA HAVE SHOWN ANY INCLINATION TO 
EMBRACE IRAN\'S BRAND OF SHI\'ITE FUNDAMENTALISM, AND MOST 
MAINSTREAM ISLAMIC LEADERS--FROM BOTH THE MAJOR FACTIONS-- 
FIND KHOMEINI ABHORRENT.  ONLY THE MOST MILITANT MUSLIM 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN IRANIAN 
PROPAGANDA, AND THEIR NUMBERS ARE VERY SMALL.  THE FMG, 
PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT MAITATSINE TROUBLES, 
IS VERY WARY OF ANY EXTREMIST RELIGIOUS VIEWPOINTS AND 
WOULD BE LIKELY TO MONITOR THE CONTENT AND DISTRIBUTION 
OF THE MAGAZINE VERY CLOSELY.

SUBJECT:  REPORTS OF STARVATION IN NIGERIA 
 
REF:  LAGOS 06244 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  CONGEN HAS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT REFTEL REPORT OF 
DROUGHT-RELATED STARVATION IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  WE 
RECOGNIZE THAT THE SITUATION IN SOME AREAS IS VERY SERIOUS, 
AND WE WOULD, THEREFORE, NOT BE SURPRISED TO FIND SCATTERED 
INCIDENCES OF STARVATION.  HOWEVER, NONE OF OUR SOURCES IN 
THE AREA HAVE REPORTED IT TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM, AND WE 
DOUBT IT EXISTS ON ANY LARGE SCALE. 
 
3.  THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOME AREAS IS 
SUBSTANTIATED BY THE REPEATED PLEAS BY THE NORTHERN 
GOVERNORS FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE--INCLUDING FOOD AID--FOR 
DROUGHT VICTIMS IN THEIR STATES.  MUCH OF THE U.S.--PURCHASED 
MAIZE WHICH RECENTLY ARRIVED IN LAGOS IS EVIDENTLY INTENDED 
FOR THIS PURPOSE.  IF THE AMERICAN GRAIN ACTUALLY FINDS ITS 
WAY TO THOSE MOST IN NEED, THE SITUATION SHOULD BE 
ALLEVIATED SOMEWHAT.  LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS IN THE 
DISTRIBUTION OF AVAILABLE ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AND THE 
SIMPLE INABILITY OF THE NEEDIEST PEOPLE TO PAY FOR 
FOODSTOCKS MAY, IN FACT, BE THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING 
FACTORS TO ANY OCCURRENCES OF STARVATION THAT EXIST. 
 
4.  ARGUING AGAINST REPORTS OF WIDESPREAD STARVATION 
IS THE RELAXED ATTITUDE OF THE FMG TOWARD ALIEN DROUGHT 
REFUGEES IN NIGERIA.  NO EFFORTS WERE MADE TO EVICT 
THESE PEOPLE DURING THE RECENT EXPULSION EXERCISE, AND 
INTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTER MAGORO STATED LAST WEEK THAT 
NIGERIA IS ACCOMMODATING 250,000 ALIEN DROUGHT REFUGEES 
ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.  IF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF 
NIGERIANS WERE THREATENED WITH STARVATION, THE FMG 
WOULD LIKELY HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE TO SO LARGE A 
GROUP OF ALIENS COMPETING FOR AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLIES.

SUBJECT:  25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS IN KADUNA 
 
1.  CEREMONIES MARKING NIGERIA\'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY 
CELEBRATION AT KADUNA\'S MURTALA MOHAMMED SQUARE WERE 
LOW-KEY AND ATTENDED BY A CROWD ESTIMATED BY THE PRESS 
AT 20,000.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE IDEAL--PLEASANT 
TEMPERATURES AND OVERCAST, BUT NONTHREATENING, SKIES. 
HEADING THE LIST OF DIGNITARIES WERE A DELEGATION OF 
TRADITIONAL CHIEFS, LED BY THE EMIRS OF ZARIA AND KATSINA, 
AND HIGH-RANKING MILITARY OFFICERS, INCLUDING AFRC MEMBER 
AIR VICE MARSHAL MOHAMMED YAHAYA AND NDA COMMANDANT MAJOR 
GENERAL PAUL TARFA.  ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WERE STATE 
COMMISSIONERS, POLICE OFFICIALS, AND TOP MEMBERS OF THE 
JUDICIARY.  DIGINITARIES, INCLUDING THE OFFICIAL HOST, 
KADUNA GOVERNOR MAJOR ABUBAKAR UMAR, ARRIVED ON TIME AND 
WITH LITTLE FANFARE.  THE CEREMONIES WENT OFF WITH NO 
NOTABLE HITCHES AND WERE COMPLETED WELL AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, 
ACTUALLY CLOSING AN HOUR EARLIER THAN ADVERTISED. 
 
2.  THE CROWD WAS GENERALLY WELL-BEHAVED AND NOT 
PARTICULARLY ENTHUSIASTIC.  ONLY THE DESCENT OF THREE 
PARACHUTISTS, THE OCCASIONAL BASHING OF PICKPOCKETS BY 
POLICE, AND THE HIGHSTEPPING ANTICS OF EXUBERANT 
YOUNGSTERS ON PARADE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE MUCH CROWD 
INTEREST.  GOVERNOR UMAR\'S SPEECH, THE ONLY ONE ON THE 
AGENDA, WAS BRIEF AND DELIVERED IN A STRONG, CLEAR VOICE. 
THE SPEECH WAS A REPEAT OF PRESIDENGIDA\'S EARLIER 
REMARKS BUT WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS SUCH.  IT WAS GREETED BY 
POLITE APPLAUSE FROM THE AUDIENCE. 
 
3.  GOVERNOR UMAR HOSTED A LATE AFTERNOON GARDEN PARTY AT 
GOVERNMENT HOUSE, DISTINGUISHED PRIMARILY BY THE CASUAL 
NATURE OF THE GATHERING (NO SPEECHES) AND BY ITS BREVITY 
(THE NIGERIAN ANTHEM WAS PLAYED AT 5:45 PM, SIGNALLING THE 
END OF THE EVENT, FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE THE ALLOTTED HOUR 
WAS UP).  THE GARDEN PARTY WAS WELL ATTENDED BY NOTABLES, 
INCLUDING FOUR EMIRS, SENIOR MILITARY AND CIVILIAN 
OFFICIALS, AND SELECTED RETIRED OFFICIALS.  GOVERNOR UMAR 
APPEARED CONFIDENT AND AT EASE IN HIS ROLE AS HOST. 
 
4.  COMMENT.  THE STREAMLINING OF THE CEREMONIES WAS THE 
ONLY NOTABLE DIFFERENCE FROM OTHER SUCH OCCASIONS WE HAVE 
SEEN HERE UNDER THE PREVIOUS REGIME.  CROWD SIZE AND THE 
LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION BY NOTABLES WERE TYPICAL FOR EVENTS 
OF THIS TYPE.  THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SPEECHES AND 
THE LENGTH OF THE FESTIVITIES WAS A BLESSED RELIEF MUCH 
APPRECIATED BY ALL, MOST ASSUREDLY INCLUDING THE CONSULAR 
REPRESENTATIVES IN ATTENDANCE.  THE EVENT WAS NOTABLE FOR 
ITS LACK OF TRADITIONAL DANCERS AND SINGERS; MILITARY 
DRILLS, MARCHING YOUTHS AND MARTIAL MUSIC PROVIDED THE 
BULK OF THE ENTERTAINMENT.  THE USUAL DISTRIBUTION OF 
PRINTED VERSIONS OF MAJOR SPEECHES IN BOTH ENGLISH AND 
HAUSA WAS ALSO DISCARDED.  THESE MINOR CHANGES PROBABLY 
REFLECT EQUALLY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION\'S DEDICATION TO AN 
AUSTERITY PROGRAM AND THE SHORT LEADTIME AVAILABLE TO 
PREPARE FOR THIS YEAR\'S CELEBRATIONS.  END COMMENT.

E.O. 12356:  N/A 
TAGS:  ECON, EIND, ELAB, EPET, EAGR, NI 
SUBJECT:  NORTHERN NIGERIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW GOVERMENT\'S 
POLICIES REMAINS TENTATIVE IN THE NORTH.  MOST CONSUMER 
GOODS ARE IN GOOD SUPPLY, AND PRICES ARE GENERALLY LOWER 
THAN A YEAR AGO.  DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING RAW MATERIALS 
HAS LED TO PLANT CLOSURES TEMPORARILY IDLING MANY WORKERS, 
BUT EMPLOYMENT LEVELS GENERALLY HAVE REMAINED STEADY.  THE 
AGRICULTURAL PICTURE IS STILL BRIGHT, ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF 
FACTORS MAY REDUCE THE HOPED-FOR RECORD HARVEST.  WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF A BRIEF WALKOUT AT THE KADUNA PEUGEOT PLANT, 
THE LABOR SCENE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUITE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF QUARTERLY ECONOMIC 
REPORTS AIMED AT GAUGING PUBLIC REACTION TO THE BABANGIDA 
GOVERNMENT AND THE ECONOMY\'S RESPONSE TO ITS POLICIES. 
THIS INITIAL REPORT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON KADUNA, BUT 
FUTURE REPORTS WILL INCLUDE THE ENTIRE NORTH AND THE SCOPE 
WILL BE BROADENED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC 
INDICATORS AND REACTIONS. 
 
3.  PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ECONOMY 
 
THE GENERAL PUBLIC CONTINUES TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE 
ATTITUDE TOWARD THE BABANGIDA GOVERNMENT\'S ECONOMIC 
POLICIES.  KADUNA\'S NEW GOVERNOR SEEMS KEENLY AWARE OF THE 
DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVENOTS, AND THE 
BASIC ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC SERTAIN TO 
BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHAT FUTURE ROAD TO 
FOLLOW.  WHILE POPULAR SENTIMENT HAD TURNED AGAINST THE 
FMG IN THE LATTER STAGES OF THE BUHARI REGIME, THE PUBLIC 
SEEMS WILLING TO GIVE THE NEW GOVERNMENT THE BENEFIT OF 
THE DOUBT.  EVEN THE RECENT BANNING OF RICE AND MAIZE 
IMPORTS, A MOVE WHICH COULD CAUSE HARDSHIP FOR SOME 
PEOPLE, HAS RAISED NO PUBLIC OUTCRY. 
 
4.  MARKET SURVEY 
 
--AVAILABILITY OF GOODS:  MOST CONSUMER ITEMS ARE IN 
GOOD SUPPLY IN KADUNA.  AUTOMOBILE SPARE PARTS ARE 
OCCASIONALLY AT A PREMIUM, BUT THE SITUATION IS MUCH 
IMPROVED FROM A YEAR AGO.  TIRES THEN AVAILABLE FOR NAIRA 
300 (APPROX. USDOL 330) CAN NOW BE FOUND FOR LESS THAN 
NAIRA 100.  PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WERE BRIEFLY SCARCE DURING 
THE FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER, EVIDENTLY DUE TO PANIC BUYING 
WHEN THE PUBLIC LEARNED THAT THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC) REFINERY WOULD BE CLOSING 
TEMPORARILY FOR ITS REGULAR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE. 
DISTRIBUTION PROBLEMS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SOLVED, AND THE 
SITUATION HAS RETURNED TO NORMAL.  THE EXPECTED GOOD 
HARVEST SHOULD KEEP FOOD SUPPLIES PLENTIFUL IN THE 
MARKETPLACE. 
 
--PRICES:  PRICES ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN LAST YEAR 
FOR MOST ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES, AGAIN REFLECTING THE GOOD 
HARVEST.  GRAIN PRODUCTS ARE SELLING AT PRICES 25 TO 50 
PERCENT BELOW LAST OCTOBER\'S LEVELS.  PRICES, HOWEVER, ARE 
SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION DUE TO A VARIETY OF CHANGING 
ECONOMIC FACTORS.  THE PRICE OF RICE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN 
KADUNA\'S CENTRAL MARKET AFTER THE OCTOBER 1ST ANNOUNCEMENT 
THAT IMPORTATION WOULD BE BANNED, BUT MAIZE PRICES REMAIN 
STEADY EVEN THOUGH ITS IMPORTATION HS ALSO BEEN BANNED. 
GROUNDNUT OIL PRICES JUMPED AFTER PRESS REPORTS THAT A 
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CROP WILL BE LOST TO ROSETTE 
DISEASE.  HERE IN KADUNA, BEAN PRICES ALSO HAVE LEAPED 
DURING THE PAST TWO WEEKS, EVIDENTLY DUE TO HEAVY INSECT 
INFION ON LOCAL FARMS.  PRICES FOR NON-FOOD ITEMS, 
SUCH AS LAUNDRY DETERGENT, ARE AS MUCH AS 25 PERCENT LESS 
THAN 1984 LEVELS. 
 
5.  EMPLOYMENT 
 
THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE PEUGEOT ASSEMBLY PLANT IN 
AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER WAS THE MAJOR EMPLOYMENT NEWS IN 
KADUNA RECENTLY.  THE SIX WEEKS OF FORCED LEAVE IDLED MORE 
THAN 4,000 WORKERS, BUT THE PLANT HAS NOW RESUMED 
PRODUCTION.  DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING RAW MATERIALS FROM 
ABROAD CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MAJOR INDUSTRIAL 
CONCERNS IN THE NORTH.  PRESS REPORTS SUGGEST THAT THE 
STEYR TRUCK PLANT IN BAUCHI MAY ALSO SOON BE FORCED TO 
CLOSE TEMPORARILY FOR THE SAME REASON.  NO MAJOR 
RETRENCHMENT EXERCISES HAVE OCCURRED RECENTLY.  THE NEW 
STATE GOVERNORS HAVE TALKED ABOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF 
CIVIL SERVANTS, BUT THEY HAVE ALSO PROPOSED SETTING UP 
ALTERNATE EMPLOYMENT SCHEMES, PRIMARILY FARMING PROJECTS, 
TO ABSORB THE DISPLACED GOVERNMENT WORKERS. 
 
6.  AGRICULTURE 
 
RAINS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH HAVE BEEN EXCELLENT THIS YEAR, 
BUT EARLIER PREDICTIONS FOR A BUMPER HARVEST MAY HAVE BEEN 
PREMATURE.  WHILE CROP PRODUCTION WILL CERTAINLY BE BETTER 
THAN MOST PREVIOUS YEARS, A NUMBER OF FACTORS WILL REDUCE 
HOPED-FOR RECORD CROPS.  IRONICALLY, FLOODING CAUSED BY 
TOO MUCH RAIN IN AREAS HIT LAST YEAR BY DROUGHT HAS 
DESTROYED MANY CROPS, AND PEST INFESTATION AND DISEASE 
HAVE STRUCK ELSEWHERE.  ONCE THE HARVEST IS IN, STORAGE 
AND DISTRIBUTION SEEM LIKELY TO BECOME PROBLEMS. 
 
7.  NEW INDUSTRY 
 
UNIPETROL WILL BE INAUGURATING A NEW MOTOR OIL/LUBRICANT 
FACILITY IN KADUNA ON OCTOBER 15.  THE PLANT, LOCATED ON 
THE NNPC REFINERY COMPLEX, IS HIGHLY AUTOMATED WITH 
LARGELY FRENCH-MADE EQUIPMENT.  IT WILL SUPPLY OILS AND 
LUBRICANTS FOR MUCH OF THE NORTH, GETTING VOST OF ITS RAW 
MATERIALS DIRECTLY FROM THE REFINERY; SOME ADDITIVES WILL 
BE IMPORTED FROM FRANCE.  THE FACILITY WILL ADD ONLY ABOUT 
20 JO LOCAL EMPLOYMENT ROLLS. 
 
8.  LABOR 
 
THE LABOR SCENE GENERALLY HAS BEEN QUITE IN THE NORTH. 
THE ONLY NOTABLE RUMBLINGS WERE AT KADUNA\'S PEUGEOT 
ASSEMBLY PLANT OCTOBER 4 WHEN WORKERS WALKED OUT AFTER 
LEARNING OF COMPANY PLANS TO DEDUCT 15 DAYS\' PAY FROM 
UPCOMING MONTHLY SALARIES TO MAKE UP FOR DAYS LOST DURING 
THE SIX WEEKS OF FORCED LEAVE IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.

1.  SUMMARY:  DURING A WEEK-LONG TRIP TO BENUE AND GONGOLA 
STATES, CONGEN QUERIED BUSINESSMEN, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, 
FORMER MINISTERS OF GOVERNMENT, CIVIL SERVANTS, AND 
TRADITIONAL TITLEHOLDERS  ABOUT PRESIDENT IBRAHIM 
BABANGIDA\'S HISTORIC DECISION TO REGISTER TWO POLITICAL 
PARTIES OF HIS OWN CREATION.  INTERLOCUTORS AGREED THAT, 
WHILE A DEFT SURPRISE, THE DECISION WAS TOO IDEALISTIC, 
I.E., THE NEW POLITICAL STRUCTURES WILL NEVER BE IMMUNE TO 
THE NIGERIAN ENVIRONMENT OF TRIBAL, ETHNIC, RELIGIOUS AND 
REGIONAL PARTISANSHIP, THE \"MONEYBAGS\" AND CORRUPTION. 
SEVERAL COMMENTATORS OPINED THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW 
SHIFTED HIS VISION TO \"GUIDED DEMOCRACY\" WITH LONG-TERM 
MILITARY SUPERVISION AND A SUSTAINED THREAT OF 
INTERVENTION.  NOTWITHSTANDING SUCH OPINIONS, ALL WILL 
JOIN ONE OF THE TWO NEW PARTIES AND SOME WILL ACTIVELY 
PARTICIPATE IN PARTY AFFAIRS.  REPRESENTATIVE VIEWS FROM 
FOUR INDIVIDUALS ARE PRESENTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
----------- 
BENUE STATE 
----------- 
 
2.  BANNED POLITICIAN PAUL UNONGO, FORMER MINISTER OF 
MINES, POWER AND STEEL IN THE SHAGARI REGIME AND DEFEATED 
NPP CANDIDATE IN THE 1983 BENUE STATE GUBERNATORIAL 
ELECTIONS, HAS BEEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF ORGANIZATIONAL 
EFFORTS IN BENUE STATE OF THE NOW-DISSOLVED PEOPLES 
SOLIDARITY PARTY (PSP).  UNONGO STATED THAT THERE ARE 
THREE THEORIES ABOUT BABANGIDA\'S DECISION.  THE 
\"CONSPIRACY THEORY\" ASSERTS THAT THE PRESIDENT\'S INTENTION 
TO REMAIN IN POWER HAS BEEN MANIFESTED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE 
THE 1985 COUP THROUGHSHIS SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION OF 
OPPONENTS.  THE ABOLISHMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES RULING 
COUNCIL (AE) AND ITS RECONSTITUTION AS A SMALLER GROUP 
AND THE FREQUENT REPLACEMENT OF GOVERNORS ARE CITED AS 
RECENT EVIDENCE.  THEORISTS CLAIM THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF TWO NEW PARTIES BEHOLDEN Y TO H M IS HIS LATEST 
MANEUVER. 
 
THE \"IDEALIST THEORY\" POSITS THE OPPOSITE, THAT PRESIDENT 
BABANGIDA IS SINCERE IN HIS DESIREJ BREAK WITH THE PAST 
AND ESTABLISH A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE THIRD 
REPUBLIC AND THAT HE BELIEVES HE CAN ACHIEVE THIS GOAL 
THROUGH THE TWO NEW PARTIES.  HIS DECISION REFLECTS HIS 
FRUSTRATION WITH BOTH OLD AND NEW BREED POLITICIANS AND 
HIS DESIRE TO LET THE IGERIAOEOPLE DECIDE FOR 
THEMSELVES.  IN SHORT, HE SHOULD BE TAKEN AT HIS WORD. 
 
LASTLY, THE \"THEORY OF GUIDED DEMOCRACY\" CENTERS ON THE 
BELIEF THAT BABANGIDA WILL REMAIN IN SOME AS YET 
UNSPECIFIED ROLE, OR PERMIT HIMSELF TO BE DRAFTED AS 
PVSIDENT, TO EXERT MILITARY GUIDANCE, REWARDS AND 
PUNISHMENT OVER THE THIRD REPUBLIC.  HE RECOGNIZES THATHD 
IGERIA IS NOT READY FOR FULL DEMOCRACY AND WILL NEED 
\"GUIDANCE\" FOR AT LEAST TEN TO TWENTY YEARS, SAY THIS 
THEORY\'S PROPONENTS. 
 
3.  UNONGO SUBSCRIBES TO THE LATTER THEORY BUT WOULD NOT 
CONJECTURE HOW BABANGIDA WOULD DO IT.  THIS WILL NOT 
PREVENT THE DEFUNCT PSP FROM JOINING EN MASSE THE NEW 
SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY (SDP), HE SAID.  THE EX-PEOPLE\'S 
FRONT OF NIGERIA (PFN) WILL DO SO AS WELL BECAUSE THE PSP 
AND PFN WILL STICK TO THEIR PRE-DECISION DEAL, ENGINEERED 
BY HIMSELF AND ALHAJI SHEHU YAR\'ADUA, WHICH SPECIFIED THAT 
THE LOSER AMONG THE TWO WOULD JOIN THE WINNER AFTER 
REGISTRATION.  TOGETHER WITH THE FORMER LIBERAL PARTY (LP) 
THE NEW SDP \"WELFARISTS\" WILL FACE THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN 
CONVENTION (NRC), THE PARTY OF \"PRIMORDIAL CAPITALISTS.\" 
 
4.  COMMENT:  UNONGO IS A DYNAMIC, YOUTHFUL-APPEARING 
POLITICIAN WHO APPEARS TO ENJOY A LOYAL FOLLOWING AMONG 
THE TIV PEOPLE IN NORTHERN BENUE STATE.  AT A LUNCHEON AT 
HIS RESIDENCE IN GBOKO, STATE-WIDE PSP OPERATIVES 
DEFIANTLY PLEDGED TO ROUND UP THEIR SUPPORTERS TO REGISTER 
SDP AND TO TAKE OVER AT STATE CONVENTIONS, TELLING CONGEN 
THAT THEY WOULD BEAT BAGANGIDA AT HIS OWN GAME.  UNONGO 
BASKED IN THEIR HOMAGE, CLEARLY INTENDING TO CONTINUE HIS 
BEHIND-THE-SCENES ROLE AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS. 
END COMMENT. 
 
5.  MR. IYORKOHOL AKURE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BENUE STATE 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND MINES, WAS 
HIGHLY CRITICAL OF BABANDIGA\'S DECISION.  THE NEC 
GUIDELINES FOR REGISTRATION WERE IMPOSSIBLE, HE STATED, 
WITH THE TIME TOO SHORT, THE DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS 
ONEROUS, THE RANGE TOO BROAD, AND THE COSTS PROHIBITIVE. 
THE TWO NEW PARTIES MIRROR THE DISSOLVED PSP AND NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL CONGRESS (NNC) IN OUTLOOK AND PHILOSOPHY, AND IN 
FREE ELECTIONS WITH ALL 13 POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS 
CONTESTING AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THEY WOULD HAVE 
PREVAILED, HE MAINTAINED.  WHAT THEN IS THE EFFICACY OF 
THIS DECISION, HE ASKED.  HE CONTINUED THAT IT ONLY SHOWS 
BABANGIDA\'S LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE NIGERIA POLITY, 
HIS THEORETICAL AND IMPRACTICAL APPROACH TO POLITICAL 
PROBLEMS, AND ABOVE ALL HIS CONTEMPT FOR NIGERIAN CIVILIAN 
SOCIETY.  THE PRESIDENT IS PREDISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE 
SUPERIORITY OF THE MILITARY AGAINST ALL EVIDENCE OF POOR 
JUDGMENT AND SIMPLISTIC THOUGHT, HE OPINED.  IN SUM, THE 
RESULTS OF THE LIFTING OF THE BAN ON POLITICS, THE 
FORMATION OF POLITICAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND THE NEC 
VERIFICATION EXERCISE WERE DEGRADING AND DISILLUSIONING. 
 
NEVERTHELESS, AKURE SAID, THE PSP NATIONAL EXECUTIVE 
COMMITTEE IS RESIGNED TO THE NEW REALITY AND WILL ENJOIN 
ITS FOLLOWERS TO REGISTER WITH THE SDP.  ON OCTOBER 2, 
1992 - ONE DAY AFTER THE RETURN TO CIVILIAN RULE - THE SDP 
WILL REWRITE ITS MANIFESTO TO REFLECT PSP VIEWS, RENDERING 
BANBANGIDA\'S MOVE A PYRRHIC VICTORY, HE CLAIMED. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  AKURE\'S VIEWS, COMING ONE DAY AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT\'S ANNOUNCEMENT, WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
WIDESPREAD INITIAL CONSTERNATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT AMONG 
BENUE STATE PSP ADHERENTS THAT THEIR ASSOCIATION HAD LOST 
OUT.  AS ELSEWHERE THE DECISION WAS SOON VIEWED 
AS JUST ONE MORE CHALLENGE THRUST UPON THEM BY BABANGIDA, 
WHICH WOULD NOT, HOWEVER, ALTER THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF 
NIGERIAN POLITICS.  END COMMENT. 
 
------------- 
GONGOLA STATE 
------------- 
7.  ALHAJI BAMANGA MUHAMMED TUKUR - ELECTED CIVILIAN 
GOVERNOR OF GONGOLA STATE (1983), FORMER GENERAL MANAGER 
OF THE NIGERIAN PORTS AUTHORITY (1975-82), PROMINENT 
BUSINESSMAN, AND TRADITIONAL TITLEHOLDER  (THE WAKILI 
CHAMBA) - WAS EQUALLY CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT\'S 
DECISION.  TO HIM, THE NEW TWO PARTY SYSTEM, RATIFIED BY 
THE COERCIVE \"POWER-OF-THE-GUN,\" IS AN ATTEMPT TO IMPOSE 
IDEAS, FEELINGS, AND LOYALTIES IN THE PRACTICE OF 
DEMOCRACY.  HOWEVER, TRUE DEMOCRACY MUST SPRING FROM THE 
PEOPLE, WHICH EVEN THE U.S.S.R. AND EASTERN EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES ARE REALIZING, AND NEEDS TIME TO DEVELOP, HE 
SAID.  IT MUST GROW FROM INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND WANTS 
COALESCING WITH OTHERS INTO GROUP DEMANDS AND THE 
FORMULATION OF ASSOCIATIONS TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS 
THROUGH POLITICAL ACTION, HE MAINTAINED.  THERE WILL BE NO 
DEVELOPMENT IF AS A PEOPLE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LEARN TO 
GOVERN OURSELVES, TO MAKE MISTAKES, AND TO LEARN FROM 
THEM, HE STATED. 
 
INSTEAD, HE SAID, THE DECISION FORCES PEOPLE TO THINK 
GOVERNMENT\'S IDEAS, ACCEPT ITS VIEWS, AND OPERATE WITHIN 
ITS PRESCRIBED PARAMETERS.  MOREOVER, IT REINFORCES THE 
IDEA OF THE INEVITABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MILITARY 
RULE, HE CONTINUED.  ECHOING A THEME REPEATEDLY 
HEARD, TUKUR SAID THAT THE MILITARY HAS RULED NIGERIA FOR 
21-PLUS YEARS OF ITS 29 YEARS OF EXISTENCE.  THOSE FEW 
SHORT YEARS OF CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION WERE INSUFFICIENT 
TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF DEMOCRACY, HE SAID, BUT THE LONG 
YEARS OF MILITARY CONTROL HAVE TAUGHT THAT THE POWER OF 
COERCION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS TO RULE.  THE NEW 
DECISION, CONTEMPTUOUS AND HUMILIATING, SHOWS BABANGIDA\'S 
TRUE COLORS - A DEMAGOGUE, CONVINCED OF THE MILITARY\'S 
SUPERIORITY, WHO WANTS TO REMAIN IN POWER. 
 
8.  TUKUR CRITIZED THE POLITICAL ASSOCIATION EXERCISE AS A 
USELESS WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  THE NEC REPORT MIRRORED 
THE FMG\'S VIEW  THAT ALL CIVILIAN POLITICAL GROUPS AND 
POLITICANS, OLD AND NEW ALIKE, ARE UNTRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE 
BY THEIR VERY NATURE THEY OPPOSE THE SUPREMACY OF THE 
MILITARY, HE SAID.  THE DECISION THUS PERPETUATES THE IDEA 
THAT MILITARY RULE IS ACCEPTABLE, WHILE DISCREDITING THE 
EDUCATED AND EXPERIENCED CIVILIAN LEADERS.  IN EFFECT, 
THEN, THERE ARE ONLY TWO GROUPS IN NIGERIA - THE MILITARY 
AND EVERYONE ELSE; THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE TWO PARTIES 
AND THE PEOPLE ALLOWED TO DECIDE, HE SUGGESTED. 
 
AS FOR THE NEW LEFT/RIGHT DICHOTOMY, TUKUR OPINED THAT 
NIGERIA COULD NEVER BE TRULY LEFTIST BECAUSE IT IS TOO 
DIVERSE, INSUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED, AND CULTURALLY 
OPPOSED.  THE TRADITIONS OF CHIEFTANCY, RESPECT FOR 
ELDERS, THE EDUCATED LEADING THE UNEDUCATED, AND THE 
EXPERIENCED AS GUIDES CANNOT BE ABOLISHED BY MILITARY 
FIAT.  MOREOVER, THE NIGERIAN PEOPLE ARE CAPITALISTS, 
BUSINESS-ORIENTED, AND FREE-THINKING, SO SOCIALIST AND 
COLLECTIVIST IDEAS WILL NOT PROSPER, HE SAID.  EVEN SO, 
THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOW IMPOSE IDEAS BASED ON THE THINKING 
OF BUREAUCRATS CONTROLLED BY THE MILITARY, SO ONE CANNOT 
TELL.  IN ANY CASE, MEMBERS OF THE NEW PARTIES WILL HAVE 
NO LOYALTY TO THE PARTY STRUCTURES OR THEIR IDEALS BECAUSE 
THEY WILL NOT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT, HE 
CONCLUDED. 
 
9.  COMMENT:  ALHAJI TUKUR REFLECTS VIEWS COMMON AMONG 
NORTHERN TRADITIONAL ELITES - COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY 
TEMPERED BY LEADERSHIP BY THE ARISTOCRACY.  END COMMENT. 
 
10.  ALHAJI ADAMU IBRAHIM, FORMER LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
CHAIRMAN OF BALI, GONGOLA STATE, GAVE VIEWS FROM A 
DIFFERENT, MORE GRASSROOTS PERSPECTIVE.  THE PFN, HE SAID, 
HAD BEEN STRONGER IN HIS AREA THAN ANY OTHER POLITICAL 
ASSOCIATION.  ITS LEADERSHIP HAD BEEN \"NEW BREED\" BUT 
FOLLOWED PFN S DELI 
FFROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL.  HE 
WORRIES THAT THE NEC REPORT AND THE PRESIDENT\'S ADDRESS 
AND DECISION SO CRITICIZED THESE BUDDING POLITICIANS THAT 
THEY WILL NOW OPT OUT.  HAVING BEEN ELECTED IN DECEMBER 
1987 ON PERSONAL MERIT, IBRAHIM HAD WANTED TO JOIN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHAIRMEN, BUT THERE 
WAS NO OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE IN GONGOLA STATE, GIVEN POOR 
COMMUNICATIONS AND INSUFFICIENT TIME.  HE BELIEVES THAT 
VOTERS WOULD FOLLOW HIM IF HE WERE TO INDICATE STRONG 
INTEREST AND PREFERENCE FOR ONE OF THE NEW PARTIES, BUT HE 
HAS DECIDED TO SIT IT OUT RATHER THAN HAVE A POLITICAL 
PROGRAM IMPOSED UPON HIM.  (HE IS NOW GONGOLA STATE\'S 
LIAISON OFFICER IN KADUNA.)  HE SUSPECTS THAT THE SDP WILL 
DO WELL, GIVEN ITS WELFARIST STANCE, BUT THAT THE NRC WILL 
BE VIEWED AS \"MORE ISLAMIC.\"  IN THE END, PREFERENCE WILL 
BE DEPENDENT ON WHICH WAY THE STATE AND NATIONAL 
LEADERSHIP GO, HE SAID. 
 
11.  COMMENT:  ONE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF BABANGIDA\'S 
DECISION MAY BE TO DRIVE OUT SOME OF THE MORE IDEALISTIC 
POLITICAL NEOPHYTES WHO JOINED IN THE POLITICAL 
ASSOCIATION FORMATION EXERCISE.  THE DISILLUSIONMENT 
EXPRESSED BY ALHAJI IBRAHIM IS REPRESENTATIVE OF MANY 
VIEWS CONGEN HEARD FROM MIDDLE-LEVEL GOVERNMENT AND 
BUSINESS CONTACTS DURING THE VISIT TO BENUE AND GONGOLA 
STATES.  END COMMENT.

YOHANNA MADAKI; FELIX ADENAIKE (FORMER MD OF THE TRIBUNE 
NEWSPAPERS); DR. YUSUF BALA USMAN (ABU); SAM IKOKU, 
VETERAN POLITICIAN; AND ALHAJI USMAN ABUBAKAR (FORMER 
STATE COMMISSIONER AND BUSINESSMAN).  THE \"NATIONAL 
QUESTION,\" BALDLY PUT, ASKS WHETHER NIGERIANS ARE ABLE TO 
LIVE TOGETHER IN ONE COUNTRY.  IN VARIOUS WAYS, THE 
SPEAKERS OFFERED INSIGHTS INTO THE INTERWOVEN PROBLEMS OF 
ETHNICITY, RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND CONSTANTLY CHANGING 
POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS.  PREDICTABLY, NO ONE HAD AN 
ANSWER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN THE VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS, A RECURRING THEME THE 
PARTICIPANTS CHEWED OVER WAS THE MULTIPLICITY OF ETHNIC 
GROUPS IN NIGERIA AND THE VARIOUS WAYS, SINCE COLONIAL 
TIMES, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN DEALT WITH.  WHILE SARO-WIWA, 
HIMSELF AN IJAW FROM RIVERS STATE, SUPPORTED THE IDEA OF 
AUTONOMY FOR EACH GROUP, FEW OTHERS SAW ANY POSITIVE GAIN 
FROM FURTHER DIVISION ALONG ETHNIC LINES.  IN FACT, 
SEVERAL SPEAKERS STATED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE CONTINUED 
CREATION OF NEW STATES HAD ENTRENCHED ETHNIC POLITICS IN 
NIGERIA AND INCREASED THE SENSE OF GRIEVANCE AMONG THOSE 
MINORITIES WHICH DID NOT YET HAVE A STATE \"OF THEIR OWN.\" 
 
4.  THE QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY AND THE 
IDENTIFICATION OF RELIGION WITH ETHNICITY ALSO CAME UP 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  ADENAIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, URGED 
NIGERIANS NOT TO SHY AWAY FROM DISCUSSING ETHNIC 
DIFFERENCES AS IF THEY DID NOT EXIST.  HE STATED FURTHER 
HIS CONVICTION THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO FACILITATE THE 
PRACTICE OF ONE\'S RELIGION WITHOUT THRUSTING THE ISSUE 
INTO THE CENTER OF POLITICAL DISCUSSION.  IN SAYING THIS, 
HE CAME AS CLOSE TO A DEFINITION OF SECULARISM AS WE HAVE 
HEARD IN NIGERIA. 
 
5.  DR. BALA USMAN CONCENTRATED HIS LEGENDARY FIRE ON 
EXPLODING SEVERAL MYTHS OR \"FAIRY TALES\" WHICH HE SAID 
INFORMED MOST DISCUSSIONS OF THIS KIND, INCLUDING THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE THREE SPEAKERS WHO HAD PRECEDED HIM. 
HE STATED IT WAS SILLY TO THINK OF ETHNIC GROUPS PRIOR TO 
BRITISH CONQUEST OF HAVING EXISTED WITHIN CLEARLY DRAWN 
POLITICAL BOUNDARIES, ONE TO EACH GROUP.  FURTHER HE 
POINTED OUT THAT THE BRITISH TAKEOVER OF WHAT IS NOW 
NIGERIA HAD BEEN GREATLY FACILITATED BY THE DIVISIONS AND 
ANIMOSITIES AMONG THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND DID NOT 
OCCUR SIMPLY THROUGH FORCE MAJEURE.  FINALLY, SAID BALA 
USMAN, THE SIMPLISTIC DISCUSSION OF POLITICS UNDER THE 
FIRST REPUBLIC IN WHICH EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS HAD HAD 
ITS OWN PARTY BASED ON ITS ETHNIC GROUP WAS ALSO ABSURD. 
ETHNIC SOLIDARITY HAS NEVER EXISTED IN NIGERIA, MAINTAINED 
BALA USMAN, BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE BRITISH, NOR HAVE 
POLITICAL BOUNDARIES EVER COINCIDED WITH ETHNIC BOUNDARIES 
THERE IS ALSO NO SUCH THING, HE SAID, AS \"RELIGIOUS 
POLITICS,\" MAINTAINING THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST 12 
MUSLIM POLITIES IN NORTHERN NIGERIA AND NO SUCH THING AS 
\"THE HAUSA-FULANI.\"  BALA USMAN\'S CONCLUSION WAS THAT, 
SINCE ALL THESE INTERPRETATIONS OF ETHNICITY ARE \"FAIRY 
TALES,\" THE ONLY ANSWER TO THE NATIONAL QUESTION IS FOR 
NIGERIANS TO LIVE WITHIN ONE POLITICAL ENTITY AND WORK 
OUT A WAY TO DO THIS PEACEFULLY. 
 
6.  SAM IKOKU APPEARED TO AGREE WITH BALA USMAN ON 
ESSENTIALS, STATING THAT THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION IS \"HOW DO 
WE LIVE TOGETHER HAPPILY?\"  HE STATED THAT THE SOLUTION 
CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE AMERICAN EXAMPLE (KILLING OFF THE 
INDIGENOUS POPULATION) OR IN THE EUROPEAN EXAMPLE 
(KILLING OFF EACH OTHER).  NEVERTHELESS, HE URGED NIGERIAN 
NOT TO LOOK AT TODAY\'S SITUATION IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA 
AND THE FORMER USSR, BUT RATHER IN AMERICA WHERE THE 
CURRENT RESIDENTS DO LIVE TOGETHER IN HARMONY.  FOR IKOKU, 
THE NIGERIAN STATE MUST ASSERT ITSELF TO GUARANTEE THE 
ESSENTIAL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE OVER ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS 
DIVISIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO LIVE 
AND WORK WHERE THEY ARE. 
 
7.  COMMENT: TO AN AMERICAN LISTENER, THE DISCUSSION WAS 
INTERESTING IN HIGHLIGHTING TWO AREAS IN WHICH NIGERIA 
DIVERGES MOST SHARPLY FROM AMERICAN PRACTICE.  ONE IS WHAT 
APPEARS TO US IN THE NORTHERN HEARTLAND AS A COMPLETE 
INCOMPREHENSION ABOUT WHAT A SECULAR SOCIETY INVOLVES AND, 
OFTEN, WHY IT MIGHT BE DESIRABLE.  THE SECOND IS WHAT 
IKOKU REFERRED TO, NAMELY, AN UNDERSTANDING THAT A CITIZEN 
CAN PRACTICE HIS CIVIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES WHEREVER HE 
FINDS HIMSELF.  IN NORTHERN NIGERIA, AT LEAST, THE MOSLEM 
HAUSA ELITE EITHER CANNOT OR WILL NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT 
SECULARISM INVOLVES; IN FACT, MOST OF THEM WOULD REJECT 
IT OUT OF HAND.  IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE CONSUL GENERAL 
RECENTLY, ALHAJI ISA KAITA REPORTED THAT THE GOVERNOR OF 
KANO HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A FUND TO REBUILD THE JNI CENTER 
BURNED DOWN IN THE KADUNA MAY RIOTS.  HE WAS BLANKLY 
UNCOMPREHENDING WHEN THE CG ASKED IF A LIKE AMOUNT WAS TO 
BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHURCHES DESTROYED AT THE SAME TIME. 
\"OH, NO,\" REPLIED THE VENERABLE ELDER, \"ONLY THE MOSLEM 
GOVERNORS ATTENDED THE MEETING.\" 
 
8.  COMMENT (CONT):  HAD WE PRESSED THE POINT TO ISA KAITA 
AND POINTED OUT THAT MANY CHRISTIANS LIVE IN KANO STATE 
AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH, WE SUSPECT HE WOULD FALL 
BACK ON THE POSITION MANY EXPRESSED IN THE AFTERMATH OF 
THE KANO RIOTS LAST OCTOBER AND THE KADUNA TROUBLES IN 
MAY:  THEY ARE \"STRANGERS\" WHO MAY LIVE HERE IN PEACE BUT 
SHOULD NOT OVERSTEP THE \"BOUNDS OF HOSPITALITY.\"  IN THE 
ZANGON-KATAF EXAMPLE, OF COURSE, THE ARGUMENT WAS TURNED 
AGAINST THE HAUSAS WHO WERE CALLED STRANGERS BY THE 
KATAF.  IN NIGERIA, IT SEEMS, YOU HAVE FULL CIVIL AND 
POLITICAL RIGHTS ONLY IN THAT PLACE WHERE YOU \"COME FROM,\" 
WHICH, TRANSLATED, MEANS YOUR ETHNIC GROUP OR SUB-GROUP. 
IT FOLLOWS, THEN, THAT YOU MUST HAVE YOUR OWN PLACE AND, 
IN MODERN PARLANCE, YOUR \"OWN\" STATE.  IT HAS ONLY 
RECENTLY BECOME APPARENT TO THE CG THAT NIGERIANS BELIEVE 
THIS PRINCIPLE UNDERLINES THE EXISTENCE OF 50 STATES IN 
THE U.S. AND, THEREFORE, EXPLAINS WHY SO MANY NIGERIANS 
STATE THAT SINCE THEIR SYSTEM IS  MODELED ON THE U.S., 
THEY NEED TO HAVE 50 STATES AS WELL. 
 
9.  COMMENT (CONT):  WHAT WAS REFRESHING AT THIS 
CONFERENCE WAS THE DISCUSSION OF THESE ISSUES WHICH ARE 
SO OFTEN SWEPT UNDER THE CARET IN NIGERIA.  THE AUDIENCE 
HAD A FAIR NUMBER OF BUSINESS, ACADEMIC AND MEDIA LEADERS, 
AND THE CITIZEN WILL SURELY CARRY MANY OF THE PAPERS IN 
WHOLE OR PART.  SINCE MOST SPEAKERS DISAGREED WITH EACH 
OTHER EVEN ON WHAT THE \"NATIONAL QUESTION\" IS, HOWEVER, 
IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT THEY COULD NOT COME UP WITH AN 
ANSWER IN THE TIME ALLOTED.  END COMMENT.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY: CONSUL GENERAL MET WITH SDP LEADER AND 
RECENT DETAINEE SHEHU YAR\'ADUA ON FEBRUARY 22. 
YAR\'ADUA SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHY HE HAD BEEN DETAINED, 
BUT THOUGHT IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAD REFUSED TO 
JOIN THE ABACHA GOVERNMENT, HAD SPOKEN OPENLY AGAINST 
IT, AND ALSO HAD AN ORGANIZATION AND FOLLOWING BEHIND 
HIM.  YAR\'ADUA BELIEVES THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WILL BE 
HELD, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY TAKE DIRECTIONS THE GOVERNMENT 
WILL NOT WISH OR BE ABLE TO CONTROL.  HE FIRMLY 
BELIEVES ALL DELEGATES TO IT SHOULD BE ELECTED AND THAT 
THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT MUST NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VETO 
OR CHANGE THE CONFERENCE\'S DECISIONS, ESPECIALLY ON THE 
LENGTH OF TIME THE PRC SHOULD STAY IN POWER.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  SHEHU YAR\'ADUA HAS BEEN HOSTING A NON-STOP 
POLITICAL HOUSE PARTY SINCE HIS RELEASE FROM DETENTION 
IN THE EARLY HOURS OF FEBRUARY 16.  THE STREAM OF 
VISITORS TO HIS HOME HAS BEEN STEADY, REPORTED DAILY IN 
SUCH KADUNA PAPERS AS THE DEMOCRAT.  HE HAS, HOWEVER, 
CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO GRANT INTERVIEWS TO THE PRESS, 
IN SPITE OF OHE FACT THAT THEY HAVE STAKED HIM OUT FOR 
THE PAST WEEK.  WHEN CG CALLED ON YAR\'ADUA AT HIS HABIB 
BANK OFFICE, SHE RAN INTO THE VOA STRINGER AMONG A 
LARGE GROUP OF OTHERS. 
 
4.  YAR\'ADUA SAID HE COULD NOT REALLY EXPLAIN WHY HE 
HAD BEEN DETAINED.  UNLIKE HIS DETENTION, ALONG WITH 
TWELVE OTHERS, IN DECEMBER 1991, WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THE 
MOTIVES OF THE BABANGIDA REGIME, HE COULD NOT FIND THE 
LOGIC BEHIND THIS RECENT EPISODE.  WHEN ASKED IF HE HAD 
BEEN INTERROGATED, HE REPLIED THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO 
ANSWER WRITTEN QUESTIONS THAT HE BELIEVED HAD BEEN SENT 
UP FROM ABUJA.  \"THEY WERE SO STUPID,\" HE SAID, THAT HE 
HAD ENJOYED WRITING OBFUSCUTORY ANSWERS OR ONE-WORD 
NEGATIVES. 
 
5.  HE SAID THE COMMENTS OF OTHERS TO THE PRESS THAT 
YAR\'ADUA HAD SAID NOTHING SO STRONG AS OBASANJO, FOR 
EXAMPLE, WERE NOT VERY HELPFUL.  HE BELIEVED THE BIG 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND CRITICS LIKE OBASANJO WAS 
THE FACT THAT HE, YAR\'ADUA, STILL HAD HIS ORGANIZATION 
AMD FOLLOWING BEHIND HIM.  OBASANJO SPOKE ONLY FOR 
HIMSELF, WHILE YAR\'ADUA HAD SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
6.  YAR\'ADUA ALSO BELIEVED THE ABACHA REGIME MOVED 
AGAINST HIM AS THE ONLY MAJOR POLITICAL FORCE THAT 
REFUSED TO COLLABORATE IN THE CURRENT CABINET.  HE SAID 
HE THOUGHT THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO JOINED THE CABINET 
DID SO BECAUSE NIGERIANS DO NOT BELIEVE THEY CAN REFUSE 
THE MILITARY.  AS A FORMER MILITARY OFFICER, HE KNEW 
THERE WAS NO REASON TO GO RUNNING TO JOIN GOVERNMENT 
WHEN ABACHA TOOK OVER.  AS A STAUNCH ADVOCATE OF 
CIVILIAN DEMOCRATIC RULE, YAR\'ADUA BELIEVED THE ONLY 
PRINCIPLED STAND WAS TO REFUSE TO TAKE PART IN AN 
ILLEGAL REGIME. 
 
7.  YAR\'ADUA BELIEVED THE ABACHA REGIME WAS A 
DO-NOTHING GROUP.  THERE WAS NO PLAN AND NO 
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS.  THE ECONOMIC MEASURES HAD 
NOT YET BEEN PUT IN PLACE.  YAR\'ADUA POINTED OUT THAT 
NONE OF THE BANKS, HIS INCLUDED, HAD RECEIVED ANY WORD, 
FOUR DAYS AFTER THE FIRST FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION 
SINCE DECEMBER, WHAT ALLOCATIONS HAD BEEN MADE AND TO 
WHOM.  HE ALSO BELIEVED THE GOVERNMENT HAD NO IDEA WHAT 
WOULD COME FROM THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND THAT IT 
WOULD BE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE FORCES ITS CONVENING 
WOULD UNLEASH. 
 
8.  ON THE SUBJECT OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE, YAR\'ADUA 
SAID THE REASON HE HAD CALLED IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
FOR A LIFTING OF THE PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL 
ASSOCIATIONS AND MEETINGS WAS TO PERMIT THE FULLEST 
POSSIBLE AIRING OF VIEWS PRIOR TO THE CONVENING OF THE 
THIS PROCESS WAS BUILDING UP HEADS OF STEAM WITH NO 
VENT.  SHOULD THIS CONTINUE, THE OPENING WEEKS OF THE 
CONFERENCE WILL BE EXPLOSIVE.  HE FEARS THE MILITARY 
GOVERNMENT MAY NOT PERMIT THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE UNTIL 
MATTERS QUIET DOWN. 
 
9.  ASKED IF HE PLANNED TO BE A PART OF THE NATIONAL 
CONFERENCE, YAR\'ADUA GAVE A MORE QUALIFIED RESPONSE 
THAN THAT OF SIX WEEKS AGO (REFTEL D).  HE SAID HE 
WOULD WAIT TO SEE THE TERMS OF REFERENCE, PARTICULARLY 
ON THE QUESTION OF HOW THE DELEGATES WOULD BE CHOSEN. 
HE WAS ADAMANT THAT THE CONFERENCE DELEGATES MUST ALL 
BE ELECTED; IF INTEREST GROUPS OR TRADITIONAL RULERS 
WISHED TO HAVE INPUTS, THEY SHOULD DEAL THROUGH THE 
ELECTED DELEGATES, HE SAID.  THIS WAS A FUNDAMENTAL 
PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY.  FURTHER, HE THOUGHT IT WAS 
POINTLESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SAY THAT THE QUESTION 
OF NIGERIAN UNITY AMD WHAT BINDS THE COUNTRY TOGETHER 
SHOULD NOT BE ON THE TABLE.  IT ALREADY WAS ON THE 
TABLE, HE SAID, AND IT NEEDS DISCUSSION.  THE 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVEI E COURAGE TO LET THE ANGER BE 
EXPRESSED AND PERMIT MORE FRUITFUL DISCUSSION TO 
FOLLOW.  FINALLY, HE WAS WAITING TO SEE WHETHER THE 
CONFERENCE WOULD BE GIVEN FULL AUTHORiTY, INCLUDING THE 
AUTHORITY TO SET THE TIME LIMITS ON THE ABACHA 
GOVERNMENT.  IN HIS VIEW, THIS WAS ALSO AN IRREDUCIBLE 
REQUIREMENT. 
 
10.  YAR\'ADUA REPLIED TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT BABANGIDA COULD STILL HOPE FOR 
RESURRECTION AS A CIVILIAN ELECTED PRESIDENT BY SAYING 
THAT \"THE LONGER ABACHA REMAINS IN POWER, THE BETTER 
BABANGIDA WILL LOOK.\"  NEVERTHELESS, YAR\'ADUA CLEARLY 
ENDORSED THE BITTER ATTACK ON BABANGIDA MADE AT THE 
AREWA HOUSE CONFERENCE BY HIS FORMER BOSS OBASANJO.  HE 
ADDED THAT BABANGIDA IS \"TOO OLD, AND LAUGHED WHEN CG 
SAID SHE AND IBB WERE THE SAME AGE. 
 
11.  COMMENT: YAR\'ADUA AS ALWAYS WAS HARD TO READ.  HE 
HAS A NERVOUS MANNER, WITH A FREQUENT COUGH AND MUCH 
FIDGETING.  IN SPITE OF THESE PERSONAL MANNERISMS, HE 
IS CHARISMATIC IN ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS, EXPRESSING 
STRONG OPINIONS WITH CONVICTION.  THE PRINCIPLED 
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES HE DELIVERED RANG TRUE, 
EXCEPT FOR THE NAGGING THOUGHT AT THE BACK OF THE MIND 
THAT HE IS SITTING FAIRLY PRETTY TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE IF THE CONDITIONS HE OUTLINED 
WIN OUT.  SINCE HE HAS NOT JOINED THE GOVERNMENT NOR 
RECOMMENDED ANY PROXIES (AS HAVE, FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE 
LIKE SARAKI AND SHINKAFI), HE IS \"CLEAN.\"  ON BALANCE, 
HOWEVER, WE WOULD JUDGE THAT YAR\'ADUA HAS CONSISTENTLY, 
OVER THE TWO AND MORE YEARS WE HAVE HAD CONTACT, 
EXPRESSED HIS COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC CIVILIAN RULE IN 
LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES BOTH CONVICTION AND A MORE 
NUANCED UNDERSTANDING THAN WE HAVE MET IN OTHER 
NIGERIAN POLITICIANS.  IN SHORT, THE ABACHA REGIME MAY 
REGRET HAVING TAKEN A STEP THAT CAN ONLY HAVE ENHANCED 
YAR\'ADUA\'S REPUTATION.

SUBJECT: LAST GASP FROM KADUNA: POLITICS IN NORTHERN 
NIGERIA 
 
1.  THIS IS THE SECOND OF FOUR END-OF-TOUR, END-OF-POST 
CABLES FROM KADUNA, GIVING AN OVERVIEW OF NORTHERN 
NIGERIA.  THE OTHER THREE WILL DEAL RESPECTIVELY WITH 
THE COMMERCIAL AND ECONOMIC CLIMATE, THE CULTURAL 
SCENE, AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND CONDITIONS.  THEY ARE 
MEANT FOR ORIENTATION OF OFFICERS ARRIVING IN THE 
SUMMER OF 1994 TO TAKE UP REPORTING POSTS IN ABUJA, AS 
WELL AS TO FULFILL POST REPORTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: POLITICAL TRADITIONS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA, 
AS ESEWHERE, STRETCH BACK TO THE PRE-INDEPENDENCE 
PERIOD.  UNLIKE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY, HOWEVER, 
THE LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURE OF THE FIRST PREMIER OF 
NORTHERN NIGERIA, THE SARDAUNA OF SOKOTO, CONTINUES TO 
HANG OVER POLITICAL FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THE 
NORTH.  EQUALLY, NORTHERN POLITICS ARE PULLED IN 
CONFLICTING DIRECTIONS BY THE CONTINUED INFLUENCE OF 
THE TRADITIONAL RULERS AND THE HABITS OF DEFERENCE TO 
ELDERS AND REFUSAL TO SPEAK ILL OF THOSE IN AUTHORITY. 
THE NORTH IS HOME TO TWO STRONG TRADITIONS -- MOSLEM 
CONSERVATISM AND A POPULIST RADICALISM.  IF ADDITION, 
GENERATIONAL FISSURES APPEARED IN THE ABORTED 
TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY WHICH COULD PROVE AN EVEN 
STRONGER CHALLENGE TO TRADITION AND THE ELDERS IF THE 
PROGRAM EVER GETS ON TRACK AGAIN.  ONCE POLITICS RESUME 
OPENLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS AND GROUPS READY TO 
PICK UP WHERE IBB LEFT THEM LAST JUNE 23.  END SUMMARY. 
 
A LITTLE HISTORY 
---------------- 
 
3.  IN THE RUN-UP TO INDEPENDENCE IN THE 1950S, THE 
NORTHERN REGION SPAWNED THREE DISTINCT POLITICAL 
MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE STILL LARGELY MIRRORED IN CURRENT 
POLITICS.  THE ONE THAT WAS ULTIMATELY VICTORIOUS IN 
THE NORTHERN REGIONAL ELECTIONS AND THE FORERUNNER FOR 
THE NATIONAL PARTY OF NIGERIA (NPN) OF THE SECOND 
REPUBLIC AND THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION (NRC) 
OF THE SECOND-AND-A-HALF REPUBLIC, WAS THE NPC, 
NORTHERN PEOPLES CONGRESS.  THIS PARTY WAS THE HOME OF 
THE TRADITIONAL, HAUSA AND FULANI CONSERVATIVES AND 
STILL PROVIDES THE MODEL FOR SOUTHERN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT 
\"NORTHERN POLITICAL DOMINATION.\" 
 
4.  THERE WERE, HOWEVER, TWO OTHER POLITICAL MOVEMENTS 
WITH CHARISMATIC LEADERS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA.  ONE WAS 
THE RADICAL POPULIST NORTHERN ELEMENTS PROGRESSIVE 
UNION (NEPU) WHOSE LEADER WAS AMINU KANO.  THIS GROUP 
WAS CENTERED IN KANO WHICH WAS AND IS STILL TODAY HOME 
TO POLITICAL CURRENTS DIRECTLY AT ODDS WITH THE 
NORTHERN \"ESTABLISHMENT.\"  THIS STRAIN OF POLITICAL 
THOUGHT ACCOUNTED FOR THE STRONG VOTE FOR ABIOLA IN 
KANO ON JUNE 12, AS WELL AS FOR THE NEARLY EVEN SPLIT 
BETWEEN NRC AND SDP IN THE CIVILIAN STATE GOVERNMENTS 
OF KANO, KADUNA, AND KATSINA THAT HAVE JUST BEEN 
ABOLISHED.  NEPU WAS THE FOREFATHER OF THE PEOPLES 
REDEMPTION PARTY (PRP) OF THE SECOND REPUBLIC (ALSO 
HEADED BY AMINU KANO), BUT ITS HEIRS SPLIT IN KANO AND 
KADUNA BETWEEN THE SDP (PEOPLES\' SOLIDARITY PARTY (PSP) 
FACTION) AND NRC WHEN THE PARTIES WERE ORGANIZED BY 
BABANGIDA IN 1989.  MALLAM AMINU KANO DIED IN 1983, BUT 
IS STILL WIDELY REVERED BY NORTHERNERS WHO SAW HIM AS 
AN INCORRUPTIBLE POLITICIAN OF SIMPLE TASTES AND 
SPARTAN LIFESTYLE, QUITE AT ODDS WITH THE NIGERIAN NORM. 
 
5.  THE THIRD POLITICAL MOVEMENT WAS THE UNITED MIDDLE 
BELT CONGRESS LED BY JOSEPH TARKA (A TIV FROM CURRENT 
BENUE STATE).  TARKA PRESSED STRONGLY FOR A FOURTH 
REGION COMPRISING THE MIDDLE BELT MINORITIES (NOWADAYS 
FOUND IN TARABA, BENUE, KOGI, PLATEAU, NIGER, KWARA, 
AND SOUTHERN KADUNA STATES) BUT LOST OUT.  WE HAVE BEEN 
TOLD HIS PLAN WAS SHOT DOWN LARGELY AT THE INSTANCE OF 
ANTHONY ENAHORO (NOW THE HEAD OF THE MOVEMENT FOR 
NATIONAL REDEMPTION), AN INDIGENE OF EDO STATE.  OF 
COURSE, NOT LONG AFTER INDEPENDENCE, ENAHORO MANAGED TO 
PUSH THROUGH THE CREATION OF A FOURTH REGION FOR HIS 
OWN ETHNIC GROUP, AN EVENT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN 
IN THESE PARTS.  TARKA WAS ELECTED TO THE SECOND 
REPUBLIC SENATE BUT DIED IN 198O.  NEVERTHELESS, THE 
MIDDLE BELT CONSIDERS ITSELF TO HAVE A SEPARATE 
POLITICAL EXISTENCE FROM THE FAR NORTH (WITH PERHAPS 
THE EXCEPTION OF NIGER STATE), AND VOTED FAIRLY 
STRONGLY FOR THE NIGERIA PEOPLES\' PARTY (NPP) (OR, IN 
BORNO AND GONGOLA, THE GREAT NIGERIA PEOPLES\' PARTY 
(GNPP)) IN 1979 AND SDP IN THE 1991-93 ELECTIONS. 
 
 
THE SARDAUNA 
------------ 
 
6.  AT INDEPENDENCE, THE NORTHERN REGION GOVERNMENT WAS 
CAPTURED BY THE NPC, WHICH ELECTED SIR AHMADU BELLO, 
THE SARDAUNA OF SOKOTO, AS PREMIER.  GIVEN THE FACT 
THAT THE LAND MASS OF THE NORTHERN REGION WAS AT LEAST 
TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY AND THE DEVOLUTION OF POWER 
FROM THE CENTER TO THE REGIONS UNDER THE FIRST 
CONSTITUTION, THE SARDAUNA WAS AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL 
FIGURE.  HE WAS A PRINCE OF THE SOKOTO RULING FAMILY 
BUT, REPORTEDLY, WAS REGARDED BY THE OPEN RULING SULTAN 
WITH SOME SUSPICION, AND SO THE SULTAN WAS HAPPY TO 
HAVE HIM OUT OF SOKOTO AND IN KADUNA. 
 
7.  THERE APPEARS TO BE NO DOUBT THAT THE SARDAUNA WAS 
A FIGURE LARGER THAN LIFE.  HE WAS, TO BEGIN WITH, 
PHYSICALLY IMPOSING.  BUT, FOR THOSE NORTHERN ELDERS 
WHO SERVED IN HIS GOVERNMENT AND ARE STILL ACTIVE (ISA 
KAITA, LIMAN CIROMA, AHMED TALIB, YAHAYA GUSAU, 
AMBASSADOR JOLLY TANKO YUSUF, MAITAMA SULE, AND MANY 
OTHERS), HIS INFLUENCE IS STILL PALPABLE.  HE IS 
REGARDED AS INCORRUPTIBLE, DEEPLY CONCERNED TO MOVE THE 
NORTH FROM ITS CONDITION OF BACKWARDNESS, AND DEEPLY 
RELIGIOUS.  HIS DEATH AT THE HANDS OF THE PERPETRATORS 
OF THE FIRST 1966 COUP IS CONSIDERED A MARTYRDOM AND 
THE HOUSE HE OCCUPIED IS A NORTHERN SHRINE (NOW THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF AREWA HOUSE, A RESEARCH AND 
DOCUMENTATION CENTER FOR NORTHERN NIGERIA).  HIS 
PORTRAIT IS STILL HAWKED AT EVERY MAJOR GATHERING AND 
FUND LAUNCHING IN THE NORTH. 
 
8.  THOSE WHO REMEMBER THE SARDAUNA RECOUNT THE STORIES 
OF HIS VISITS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH, EVEN TO REMOTE 
AREAS ON THE MAMBILLA PLATEAU AND OTHER SETTLEMENTS OFF 
THE BEATEN TRACK.  THEY WILL MENTION THE JOY WITH WHICH 
THE LOCAL INHABITANTS GREETED HIM, AND THOSE WHO SERVED 
IN HIS GOVERNMENT WILL EMPHASIZE THAT MOSLEM, 
CHRISTIAN, AND PAGAN ALIKE GAVE HIM THEIR ALLEGIANCE. 
THE SARDAUNA\'S PROGRESSES THROUGHOUT THE NORTH INVOLVED 
DISTRIBUTION OF CLOTH AND SMALL HOUSEHOLD WARES, AS 
WELL AS COMMITMENTS TO CONSTRUCT SCHOOLS AND OTHER 
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.  FROM MORE 
IMPARTIAL SOURCES, WE LEARN THAT THE GOODIES WERE 
ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE VILLAGES AND PERSONS WHO 
CONVERTED TO ISLAM; EVEN VILLAGES WHICH HAD BEEN MOSLEM 
FOR SOME TIME CLAIMED TO HAVE RECENTLY CONVERTED IN 
ORDER TO COLLECT THE \"DASH.\"  ONE CHRISTIAN CONTACT OF 
THE CONSULATE WHO HAILS FROM LOKOJA REMEMBERS SXWNDIN 
WITH HIS SCHOOL CLASS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO 
WELCOME THU SARDAUNA TO KOGI DISTRICT.  WHEN, AFTER A 
LONG DELAY, THE PREMIER ACTUALLY APPEARED, HE RESPONDED 
TO THE WELCOME BY REMARKING AUDIBLY WITHIN OUR 
CONTACT\'S HEARING, \"IS THERE SUCH A PLACE AS KOGI 
DISTRICT?\"  OUR CONTACT HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN THE 
IMPRESSION THIS MADE ON HIM. 
 
9.  THIS HISTORY HAS SOME RELEVANCE TO POLITICS TODAY 
SINCE MUCH OF THE SARDAUNA\'S STYLE CARRIES OVER.  THE 
CIVILIAN GOVERNORS OF THE ABORTEDHZHIRD REPUBLIC FROM 
THE NORTHERN STATES CONSIDERED THEIR STATES \"MOSLEM,\" 
AS THOUGH IT WAS NORMAL TO GIVE STATE MONEY TO MOSLEM 
FUND RAISINGS.  THE BABANGIDA HABIT OF FINANCING 
GOVERNMENT BY \"PERSONAL\" DONATION MAY ALSO REFLECT THE 
SARDAUNA\'S STYLE.  WE OBSERVE IN THE NORTH LITTLE 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE NECESSITY FOR A GOVERNMENT TO BE 
NEUTRAL IN MATTERS OF RELIGION, EXCEPT FOR CHRISTIANS 
LIVING IN PREDOMINATELY MOSLEM AREAS.  IN SOME STATES, 
SUCH AS KADUNA OR PLATEAU, THE DEPUTY GOVERNORS WERE 
ADHERENTS OF THE OPPOSITE RELIGION AND SOME EFFORT WAS 
MADE TO MAKE EQUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOTH RELIGIOUS OR 
TO SEND EQUAL NUMBERS OF PERSONS ON BOTH THE HAJJ AND 
THE \"CHRISTIAN PILGRIMAGE\" TO ROME AND JERUSALEM. 
 
 
THE THIRD REPUBLIC 
------------------ 
 
10.  BY FORCING THE NASCENT POLITICAL PARTIES OF THE 
THIRD REPUBLIC INTO TWO COALITIMNS CALLA NRC AND SDP, 
BABANGIDA\'S TRANSITION DID NOT CHANGE POLITICS IN THE 
NORTH IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAY.  THE TRADITIONAL, FAR 
NORTH GENERALLY FELL INTO THE NRC, WHILE THE 
\"PROGRESSIVEE NORTH (BTRNO, YOBE, KANO CITY, AND THE 
MIDDLE BELT) WERE STRONG FOR THE SDP.  EACH PARTY MADE 
ITS TRADITIONAL ALLIANCES WITH THE GROUPS IN THE SOUTH 
-- THE \"ROGRESSIVES\" WITH THE YORUBA AND THE 
\"TRADITIONALISTS\" WITH THE EAST. 
 
11.  WHAT WAS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE FUTURE 
WAS THE EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE BABANGIDA THEORISTS 
TO ELIMINATE THE \"OLDBREED\" FROM THE PLAYING FIELD AND 
ENCOURAGE THE EMERGENCE OF \"NEWBREED\" POLITICIANS. 
SINCE THE BAMNING EVEN FROM POLITICAL ACTIVITY AND 
SUPPORT OF CANDIDATES ON THE PART OF THE OLDBREED 
REMAINED IN FORCE THROUGH THE GUBERNATORIAL ELECTIONS 
OF DECEMBER 1991, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, GOVERNORS, AND 
STATE HOUSES OF ASSEMBLY ELECTED WERE COMPOSED ALMOST 
ENTIRELY OF YOUNGER, POLITICALLY INEXPERIENCED PEOPLE. 
A NUMBER OF NORTHERN OBSERVERS HAVE REMARKED THAT, IN 
THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY AT LEAST, THIS DID NOT SERVE 
THE PUBLIC WELL.  THE NORTHERNERS AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL 
CONFERENCE HAD, FOR EXAMPLE, ARGUED AGAINST THE 
EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE, SINCE 
THIS WOULD ELIMINATE A NUMBER OF RESPECTED LOCAL 
LEADERS WHO HAD LITTLE SCHOOLING.  NORTHERNERS MAINTAIN 
THAT THE SOUTHERN REPRESENTATIVES PUSHED THIS THROUGH, 
AND THAT THE SOUTH HAD MUCH BETTER LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
CHAIRMEN ON BALANCE THUNHLE NORHEP 
CZIOLDERPDMOEUN 
OF TH COMUNITIES IN THE SOUTH ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO 
HAVE FINISHED SECONDARY SCHOOL. 
 
12.  THE RECENT ABORTED TRANSITION ALSO ADVANCED 
FISSURES ALONG GENERATIONAL LINES.  ACCORDING TO THE 
OLD NPC/NPN/NRC TRADITION, THE PARTY ELDERS ARE 
SUPPOSED TO CONVENE AND DECIDE WHO THE CANDIDATE WILL 
BE.  THE FITS AND STARTS OF BANNING AND UNBANNING 
OHOROUGHLYHDIQNUPTED THIS PROCESS THE LAST TPME 
AROUND.  WHEN THE OLDBREED WERE UNBANNED, ADAMU CIROMA 
WAS ABLE TO MAKE A BID FOR THE NRC NOMINATION AND 
EVERYONE EXPECTED UMARU SHINKAFI, HIS JUNIOR, WOULD 
YIELD THE FLOOR.  SHINKAFI REFUSED TO DO THIS.  AFTER 
THE WHOLE \"BAND OF 23\" WAS BANNED AND THE PRIMARIES OF 
\'92 WERE CANCELLED, OPTION A4 WAS ADOPTED.  HERE AGAIN, 
THE NEWBREED LIKE BASHIR TOFA SEIZED THE ADVANTAGE 
OFFERED OF ELIMINATING RIVALS AT THE EARLIEST STAGES BY 
SIZABLE PAYOFFS.  TOFA LOPPED OFF THE CHALLENGE IN KANO 
STATE FROM AMINU WALI AND IN KADUNA FROM GOWON AND, IN 
SO DOING, DEEPLY OFFENDED THE \"ELDERS.\"  THEIR REFUSAL 
TO CAMPAIGN FOR HIM OR, INDEED, TO VOTE FOR HIM, GOES A 
LONG WAY TO EXPLAIN THE MASSIVE SUPPORT FOR ABIOLA IN 
PLACES LIKE KANO AND BAUCHI. 
 
13.  QUITE A NUMBER OF NORTHERN SDP ADHERENTS NOW 
OPENLY CHALLENGE WHAT THEY SEE AS THE DEAD HAND OF THE 
TRADITIONAL RULERS AND THE OLDER POLITICAL GENERATION. 
THEY REFUSE TO SEE WHY THEY SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY BOW TO 
THE DECISIONS OF THE ELDERS.  MANY CONTEMPTUOUSLY 
DISMISS THE EFFORTS OF THE TRADITIONAL RULERS TO PULL 
STRINGS BEHIND THE SCENES.  SO FAR, THESE JUNIORS ARE 
STILL SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE, BUT THEY DO REPRESENT 
THE FORCES OF THE FUTURE.  THE DEAD SARDAUNA AND THE 
NORTHERN TRADITION HE INSTITUTIONALIZED IS FADING FROM 
THE MEMORIES OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION.  THE \"NEWBREED\" 
DO, IN THIS SENSE AT LEAST, REPRESENT A MORE GENUINELY 
DEMOCRATIC AND LESS FEUDAL ORGANIZATION OF POLITICS. 
 
 
THE ROAD AHEAD 
-------------- 
 
14.  ONCE POLITICS RETURN OPENLY TO NIGERIA, THE NORTH 
IS POISED TO REENTER THE FRAY.  SHORTLY AFTER THE 
ANNULLMENT OF THE JUNE 12 ELECTION, VARIOUS MEETINGS OF 
NORTHERN POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. 
ONE, SPEARHEADED BY FORMER SECRETARY TO THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT (UNDER OBASANJO), ALHAJI LIMAN CIROMA, 
COALESCED AROUND THE EFFORT TO FORM A \"NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT\" TO TAKE OVER FROM BABANGIDA.  THE ORIGINAL 
IDEA OF THIS GROUP WAS TO FORM A GOVERNMENT MADE UP OF 
POLITICIANS OF ALL STRIPES; WHAT THEY GOT WAS 
SHONEKAN\'S INTERIM NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHICH FELL SHORT 
IN MANY IMPORTANT WAYS OF WHAT THE GROUW HAD HOPEDTO 
FASHON.  NEVERTHELESS, ADAMU CIROMA, BAM,:- 57174, 
AMINU SALEH,DALHATU TAFIDA, AND S.B. DANIYAN IN THE 
CURRENT CABINET ARE MOST LIKELY NOMINEES FROM THIS 
GROUP.  LIMAN CIROMA CONTINUES TBSPSXVA INLUEZAAL 
ROLE BEHID THE SCENES, AS WITNESS HIS AHMADU BELLO 
MEMORIAL LECTURE AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE AREWA 
HOUSE WORKSHOP ON \"THE STATE OF THE NATION: WHICH WAY 
FORWARD?\"  CONCERNING THIS LATTER IN-GATHERING OF THE 
NORTHERN (AMD SOME SOUTHERN) POLITICAL ELITE, THE FIRST 
PLAN TO ORGANIZE IT OPENLY AS A PREPARATORY SEMINAR FOR 
THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE WAS LATER CHANGED TO PLACE IT 
UNDER THE AUSPICES OF AHMADU BELLO UNIVERSITY.  THIS 
GAVE IT A THIN VEIL OF LEGITIMACY CONSIDERING THE 
CONTINUING PROHIBITION ON POLITICAL MEETINGS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
15.  ALTHOUGH, IN OUR OPINION, THE GROUP AROUND LIMAN 
CIROMA REPRESENTS THE GENUINE OLD GUARD NORTHERN 
POLITICOS, ANOTHER GROUP BEGAN MEETING DURING THE 
SUMMER OF 1993, CALLING ITSELF THE \"NORTHERN ELDERS.\" 
THIS WAS SPEARHEADED BY SUCH PERSONS AS ABDULRAHMAN 
OKENE AND MAITAMA SULE WHO GAVE A CERTAIN COVER, AS 
OLDBREED FORMER CIVIL SERVANTS, TO THE EFFORTS OF THE 
NORTHERN GOVERNORS TO COOPT THE LIMAN CIROMA GROUP. 
THIS GROUP MADE AN EFFORT TO ORGANIZE A CALL FOR IBB TO 
REMAIN IN OFFICE BEYOND AUGUST 27 WHICH, AS WE NOW 
KNOW, CAME TO NAUGHT.  THOSE IN THE CURRENT CABINET 
MOST LIKELY ALIGNED WITH THIS GROUP ARE BASHIR DALHATU 
AND POSSIBLY WADA NAS WHO COMES FROM THE SHINKAFI WING 
OF THE NRC.  MOST RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE GROUP HELD A 
MEETING ON THE FRINGES OF THE AREWA HOUSE WORKSHIP AND 
ISSUED A DECLARATION CALLING FOR NATIONAL UNITY AND 
SUPPORTING THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE. 
 
16.  IF THE DEFUNCT NRC POLITICOS HAVE NOT YET PULLED 
THEMSELVES TOGETHER, THE SDP IS AN EVEN STRANGER 
SITUATION.  FOR ONE THING, THEIR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
WON THE NON-EVENT ON JUNE 12.  FOR ANOTHER, BABA GANA 
KINGIBE, REPRESENTING ONE WING OF THE NORTHERN SDP, IS 
IN THE INNER CIRCLE OF THE MILITARY GOVERNMENT. 
ABUBAKAR RIMI AND SOLOMON LAR, MEMBERS OF THE CABINET, 
REPRESENT RESPECTIVELY THE RADICAL KANO TRADITION AND 
THE MIDDLE BELT CHRISTIANS. 
 
17.  AND THEN THERE IS LT. GEN. SHEHU MUSA YAR\'ADUA 
(RTD).  HE HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES NOT SUPPORT THE 
ABACHA REGIME, NOR DOES HE CONSIDER IT CAME TO POWER 
LEGITIMATELY.  RECENTLY, HIS STAR WAS GIVEN AN EVEN 
GREATER SHINE BY HIS SEEMINGLY POINTLESS DETENTION FOR 
FIVE DAYS.  HE HAS PLENTY OF MONEY AND GREAT AMBITION. 
HE VERY LIKELY ALSO HAS A GOOD DEAL OF ABILITY TO RUN 
THE COUNTRY.  IRONICALLY, HIS MAJOR DRAWBACK IS THE 
PIS FROM THE NORTH.  MANY NORTHERNERS, INCLUDING PEOPLE 
LIKE LIMAN CIROMA, BELIEVE THAT, WHATEVER DECISIONS ARE 
MADE OR NOT MADE ON ROTATIONAL OFFICES AND ZONING AT 
THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE, IT WILL BE A GREAT MISTAKE IF 
THE NEXT ELECTED PRESIDENT IS FROM THE NORTH.  BUT 
YAR\'ADUA WANTS IT AND HE HAS MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS 
-- MONEY, ORGANIZATION, CLEAN HANDS IN THE CURRENT MESS 
-- TO CLAIM A RIGHT TO RULE. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
18.  NORTHERN NIGERIAN POLITICS ARE PROBABLY IN A STATE 
OF MORE PROFOUND CHANGE THAN POLITICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN 
THE SOUTH.  THE HEAVY HUND OF TRADITION HAS PERSISTED 
LONGER HERE, CAUSING INTERGENERATIONAL RESTIVENESS. 
THE FAULT LINES OF THE OLD NORTHERN REGION -- BOTH 
RELIGION AND TRIBE -- STILL EXIST AND IN MANY WAYS CUT 
DEEPER FOLLOWING EIGHT YEARS OF IBB\'S EFFORTS TO 
EXACERBATE THEM.  MOST NORTHERNERS BELIEVE THAT, SHOULD 
PUSH COME TO SHOVE AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE AND THE 
NATION START TO SPLIT UP, THE MIDDLE BELT WILL THROW IN 
ITS LOT WITH THE FAR NORTH AND \"PROGRESSIVE\" 
NORTHEAST.  WE WOULDN\'T WANT TO BE PRESSED ON THIS AT 
THE MOMENT.  IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT THE NORTH HAS NO 
INTENTION OF GIVING UP ON NATIONAL UNITY.   NOR DO 
MAINLINE NORTHERN POLITICIANS INTEND, WE BELIEVE, TO 
TAKE \"NON-NEGOTIABLE\" STANDS THAT WILL GIVE THE 
SOUTHERNERS AMMUNITION.

HRADITIONALSRULERS 
------------------ 
 
3.  IBRAHIM DASUKI, SULTAN OF SOKOTO.  MUCH HAS BEEN 
WRITTEN ABOUT THE SULTAN, BUT IT IS PERHAPS WORTH 
REITERATING THAT HIS POPULARITY  AS NOT RISEN IN THE 
FIVE YEARS SINCE HE HAS OCCUPIED THE THRONE.  HIS 
LAVISH PALACE RENOVATIONS ARE VIEWED BY MANY AS TOTALLY 
AT ODDS WITH ISLAMIC INJUNCTION.  HE IS A SMART, 
SOPHISTICATED MAN, BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN THE 
DEGREE OF VENALITY HE HAS CARRIED OVER FROM HIS BCCI 
DAYS AND HIS ASSOCIATION WITH GENERAL BABANGIDA, TO 
WHOM HE OWES HIS ELECTION TO THE THRONE.  SEVERAL OF 
THE SULTAN\'S SONS HAVE STUDIED IN THE UNITED STATES AND 
AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HAVE SECOND HOMES IN NORTHERN 
VIRGINIA. 
 
4.  ALHAJI SHEHU IDRIS, EMIR OF ZARIA.  THE EMIR OF 
ZARIA, OR SARKIN ZAZZAU TO GIVE HIM HIS HAUSA TITLE, IS 
A FREQUENT INTERLOCUTOR OF EMBASSY AND CONSULATE 
PERSONNEL.  HE LOOKS FOR EXCHANGES WITH FOREIGN 
DIPLOMATS ON BOTH POLITICAL QUESTIONS AND HIS EFFORTS 
TO PROMOTE INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE IN KADUNA STATE.  HE 
IS DEEPLY DISTRUSTED BY THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES IN 
SOUTHERN KADUNA STATE, WHO SEE HIM AS A MAJOR 
IMPEDIMENT TO THEIR ENJOYING FULL POLITICAL AND 
PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE STATE.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE 
ALWAYS ENJOYED EASY ACCESS TO THE EMIR WHO IS FRIENDLY 
AND AS OPEN AS THESE RULERS CAN BE. 
 
5.  ALHAJI ADO BAYERO, EMIR OF KANO.  THE EMIR OF KANO 
IS SOMEWHAT MORE FORMAL WITH US AND IT CAN BE MORE 
DIFFICULT TO GET AN APPOINTMENT WITH HIM, BUT HE, LIKE 
HIS FELLOW EMIRS, IS ALWAYS FRIENDLY AND INTERESTING TO 
TALK TO.  HE TRAVELS FREQUENTLY TO THE UNITED STATES, 
BOTH ON PRIVATE TRIPS AND, OCCASIONALLY, TO VISIT 
VARIOUS NIGERIAN COMMUNITIES AND CULTURAL EVENTS.  HE 
WAS A DIPLOMAT PRIOR TO TAKING THE TITLE THIRTY YEARS 
AGO AND IS, THEREFORE, EASY WITH OTHER DIPL0MATS.  HE 
IS REGARDED BY NORTHERN NIGERIANS TO BE MUCH STUFFIER 
THAN THE EMIRS OF ZARIA OR KATSINA; ONE INTERLOCUTOR 
CLOSE TO THE KATSINA EMIRATE WAS VISIBLY SURPRISED TO 
LEARN THAT THE KANO EMIR ROUTINELY SHOOK THE HAND OF 
THE (FEMALE) CONSUL GENERAL, SOMETHING THAT, 
TRADITIONALLY, HE SHOULD NOT DO.  (ALL OTHER EMIRS BUT 
THE SULTAN OF SOKOTO HAVE EXTENDED THEIR HAND TO THE 
CONSUL GENERAL.) 
 
PRESS 
------ 
 
6.  MALAM MOHAMMED HARUNA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CITIZEN 
PUBLICATIONS.  HARUNA IS A VERY BRIGHT YOUNG JOURNALIST 
WHO IS AT THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING 
WEEKLY MAGAZINES IN NIGERIA.  THE CITIZEN WAS FOUNDED, 
UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF ALHAJI TURI MUHAMMADU, BY A 
GROUP OF REBELS FROM THE NEW NIGERIAN WHO WERE UNHAPPY 
AT THAT PAPER\'S LOSS OF EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE. 
ALTHOUGH HARUNA (AND HIS MAGAZINE) TAKE STRONG 
PRO-ISLAMIC STANDS, THE MAGAZINE IS WELL WRITTEN AND 
ARGUED, A HAPPY EXCEPTION IN JOURNALISM IN NIGERIA. 
PERSONALLY, HARUNA IS FRIENDLY TO AMERICAN DIPLOMATS, 
HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH US AND ANY VISITORS WE MAY HAVE, 
AND WILL UNFAILINGLY RESPECT ANY REQUEST THAT 
DISCUSSIONS BE OFF THE RECORD.  THIS PERMITS US TO HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT BACKGROUND DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM AND HIS 
EDITOR, BILKISU YUSUF (SEE BELOW). 
 
7.  HAJIYA BILKISU YUSUF, EDITOR OF THE CITIZEN 
MAGAZINE.  YUSUF IS NOT ONLY A LEADING JOURNALIST IN 
NORTHERN NIGERIA, BUT SHE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT WOMEN\'S 
ACTIVIST AND MEMBER OF \"FOMWON\" -- FEDERATION OF MUSLIM 
WOMEN OF NIGERIA.  SHE IS EXTREMELY WELL EDUCATED IN 
ISLAM AND IS OBSERVANT IN WAYS THAT LEAD US TO BELIEVE 
SHE MAY BE A MEMBER OF THE DARIKA SECT.  SHE FASTS 
EVERY MONDAY AND THURSDAY, AND WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT 
SHAKE HANDS WITH MEN.  SHE HAS STRONG TIES TO ISLAMIC 
SCHOLARS IN SUDAN AND TRAVELS THERE FREQUENTLY.  WE 
HAVE FOUND HER TO BE FRIENDLY AND OPEN IN DISCUSSIONS. 
CURRENTLY, SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE NIPSS STUDY CLASS, 
AND IS RESIDENT IN JOS FOR TH YIPERIOD. 
 
8.  GARDA SHEHU, MANAGING DIRECTOR, TRIUMPH 
NEWSPAPERS.  GARBA SHEHU PRESIDES OVER A STATE-OWNED 
PRESS OPERATION THAT IS PERPETUALLY STARVED OF FUNDS 
AND SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED 
PRESS.  THIS SAID, HE IS A BRIGHT MAN, ALWAYS READY TO 
SEE AMERICAN DIPLOMATS, AND, LIKE HARUNA AT THE 
CITIZEN, IS PUNCTILIOUS ABOUT HONORING \"BACKGROUND\" 
RULES.  WE HAVE HAD LONG AND FULL CONVERSATIONS WITH 
GARBA SHEHU AND HIS EDITORIAL BOARD; THEY ASK TOUGH BUT 
FAIR QUESTIONS.  GARBA SHEHU IS WIDELY RESPECTED BY 
MANY OF THE NORTHERN ELDERS, PARTLY BECAUSE HE IS THE 
TREASURER FOR THE BAREWA OLD BOYS ASSOCIATION (THE 
SECONDARY SCHOOL A LARGE NUMBER OF THE NORTHERM ELITES 
HAVE ATTENDED) AND WORKS HARD FOR THE ALMA MATER. 
 
9.  ALHAJI TURI MUHAMMADU, NOW RETIRED BUT CHAIRMAN OF 
THE CITIZEN AND A FORMER EDITOR OF NEW NIGERIAN 
NEWSPAPERS.  ALSO A FORMER NORTHERN MANAGER, UTC.  TURI 
MUHAMMADU, WHO COMES FROM NIGER STATE, IS A THOUGHTFUL 
AND VERY INTERESTING INTERLOCUTOR, A RARE NIGERIAN WHO 
READS VORACIOUSLY AND INTELLIGENTLY.  (IN THE PAST 
YEAR, WE HAVE PASSED HIM COPIES OF THE GEORGE SCHULZ 
AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHICH HE DEVOURED IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND 
FOLLOWED IT UP WITH THE MCCULLOGH BIOGRAPHY OF 
TRUMAN.)  HE IS SHY AND GENERALLY DOES NOT COME TO 
VONSULATE PARTIES, BUT IS WILLING TO HAVE ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETINGS AND IS AN INFORMED AND SERIOUS CONTACT. 
 
10.  ALHAJI ISMAILA ISA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DEMOCRAT 
NEWSPAPER, AND CHAIRMAN OF BULET, A CONSTRUCTION FIRM. 
ISMAILA ISA WAS RAISED IN THE HOME OF HIS UNCLE, 
NORTHERN ELDER ISA KAITA, AND COMES FROM FUNTUA IN 
KATSINA STATE.  HE IS ALSO THE LANDLORD OF THE 
CONSULATE OFFICE BUILDING.  IN OUR CONTACTS WITH HIM, 
WE HAVE FOUND HIM TO BE A MAN OF SHALLOW OPINION AND 
CONSIDERABLE PREJUDICE AGAINST AMERICANS.  HE CAN BE 
VERY KIND ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN WE HAVE BEEN IN A FIX 
(SAY, WITH TWO FLAT TIRES ON THE ABUJA ROAD), SO IT 
GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN TO CRITICIZE, BUT HIS NEWSPAPER 
TAKES OFTEN IRRESPONSIBLE POSITIONS AND HE CLAIMS NO 
CONTROL OVER IT.  HA| 
 
BUSINESS 
-------- 
 
11.  ALHAJI AMINU DANTATA.  AMINU DANTATA IS THE 
PATRIARCH OF THE DANTATA ORGANIZATION, A FAMILY FIRM 
INVOLVED IN TRADING AND AGRIBUSINESS ENTERPRISES. 
AMINU DANTATA IS A DEVOUT MOSLEM, A PHILANTHROPIST TO 
ISLAMIC AND OTHER CHARITIES ON A AWESOME SCALE, AND 
PART OF AN ENORMOUS FAMILY.  HIMSELF ONE OF SEVERAL 
BROTHERS/COUSINS, HE HAS FOUR WIVES AND TWENTY-SEVEN 
CHILDREN.  IN OUR PRIVATE CONTACTS, HE HAS BEEN OPEN 
ABOUT HIS DOUBTS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF DEMOCRACY FOR 
NIGERIA, BELIEVING IT IS A NON-INDIGENOUS SYSTEM BEING 
IMPOSED BY THE WEST FOR PROBABLY GOOD, BUT MISPLACED, 
INTENTIONS.  HE IS RELATIVELY UNFORTHCOMING ABOUT HIS 
OWN BUSINESS OR GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN KANO, 
HIS HOME BASE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE IS ALWAYS READY TO SEE 
CONSULATE AND EMBASSY VISITORS AND IS RELAXED AND 
FRIENDLY.  HE MAINTAINS A HOME IN SAUDI ARABIA WHERE HE 
SPENDS A GOOD DEAL OF TIME EACH YEAR DURING THE HAJJ 
AND UMMRA.  HIS CHILDREN HAVE MOSTLY GONE TO SCHOOL IN 
SAUDI ARABIA AND THEN ON TO UNIVERSITY IN MIAMI 
(FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY) FOR THE BOYS AND 
BAYERO UNIVERSITY KANO (FOR THE GIRLS).  AMINU DANTATA 
ALSO HAS HOUSES IN FLORIDA AND GENERALLY A TROUP OF THE 
FAMILY GOES ON SUMMER HOLIDAY IN THE U.S.  (DANTATA DAY 
IN THE VISA SECTION IS A BUSY TIME.) 
 
12.  ALHAJI TAJUDEEN DANTATA, THE SON OF AMINU DANTATA 
WHO IS MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE ORGANIZATION AND IS 
BEING GROOMED TO TAKE OVER THE OPERATION.  TAJUDEEN 
DANTATA IS YOUNG (PROBABLY AROUND 30), AND LOOKS 
YOUNGER, BUT IS THE CHOSEN SUCCESSOR TO TAKE OVER THE 
FAMILY FIRM.  APPARENTLY HIS OLDER BROTHER WAS MEANT TO 
BE THE HEIR BUT WAS KILLED IN A POLO ACCIDENT, SO 
TAJUDEEN HAS ONLY RECENTLY ASSUMED THE MANTLE.  HE IS 
OPEN TO CONTACT WITH AMERICAN DIPLOMATS AND, LIKE MOST 
NORTHERN BUSINESSMEN, KEEPS HIS FAMILY IN KANO WHILE HE 
LIVES PART-TIME IN LAGOS AND TRAVELS THE WORLD. 
 
13.  MUNZALI DANTATA, A COUSIN OF THE TWO ABOVE, IS THE 
PROPRIETOR OF ALL STATES TRAVEL, A FIRM WITH THE AGENCY 
FOR SAUDIA AIRLINES IN LAGOS.  HE IS SOMEWHAT 
INDEPENDENT OF THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE MAIN 
BRANCH OF THE FAMILY AND PRIDES HIMSELF ON BUILDING UP 
HIS TRAVEL AGENCY.  HE ADMIRES THE U.S. AND WOULD LIKE 
TO DEVELOP A TOURIST LINK WITH AMERICA, BUT MAY BE 
SOMEWHAT UNREALISTIC ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK WILL HAVE TO 
BE DONE TO PRODUCE AN ATTRACTIVE TOURIST INFRASTRUCTURE 
FOR AMERICANS.  HE IS THE AUTHOR OF A RECENTLY 
PUBLISHED GUIDEBOOK ON ABUJA AND RUNS BUS TOURSZOF THE 
NEW CAPITAL AS PART OF HIS ENDEAVORS.  HE IS AN 
ENTHUSIASTIC AND ENTERPRISING GUY. 
 
14.  WAZIRI MOHAMMED, A SON-IN-LAW OF AMINU DANTATA, IS 
A DIRECTOR OF PACIFIC MERCHANT BANK IN LAGOS.  HE IS 
KANURI AND COMES FROM MAIDUGURI WHERE HIS FAMILY 
LIVES.  LAGOS HAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ON WAZIRI 
MOHAMMED AND HIS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN THE KINGIBE 
CAMPAIGN.  WE UNDERSTAND FROM A PREVIOUS POLITICAL 
COUNSELOR IN LAGOS THAT WAZIRI MOHAMMED HAS CLOSE LINKS 
WITH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.  HE IS A FOREIGN SERVICE 
BRAT, AND THUS QUITE SOPHISTICATED AND WELL-TRAVELED. 
HE HAS BEEN VERY FRIENDLY BOTH WITH CONSULATE KADUNA 
AND EMBASSY LAGOS PERSONNEL. 
 
15.  ALIKO DANGOTE, RELATED THROUGH HIS MOTHER TO THE 
DANTATA CLAM (HER FATHER WAS A BROTHER TO AMINU 
DANTATA\'S FATHER), IS THE CHAIRMAN (AT AGE 35) OF THE 
DANGOTE GROUP OF COMPANIES.  THE DANGOTE FATHER DIED 
EARLY AND THE FAMILY COMPANY IS NOW CONDUCTED BY A 
GROUP OF BROTHERS, THE PRINCIPAL ONES OF WHOM ARE SANI 
AND BELLO (SEE BELOW).  ALIKO, LIKE AMINU DANTATA, IS A 
MAJOR FIGURE AT MANY CHARITABLE FUNDRAISING EVENTS.  HE 
HAS JUST MARRIED FOR THE THIRD TIME -- LIKE AMERICANS, 
HIS MARRIAGES HAVE BEEN SERIAL RATHER THAN POLYGAMOUS. 
THE DANGOTES HAVE HOMES IN KANO, LAGOS, LONDON, AND 
ATLANTA AND, LIKE THE DANTATAS, TAKE A LARGE GROUP OF 
FAMILY MEMBERS FOR AN AMERICAN HOLIDAY EVERY SUMMER. 
 
16.  SANI DANGOTE, BROTHER TO ALIKO, IS THE BROTHER WHO 
WATCHES OVER THE FAMILY TEXTILE, OILFIELD SERVICES, AND 
COMMODITY (COCOA, SUGAR) TRADING OPERATIONS.  HE HAS 
JUST CONCLUDED A LICENSING AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE 
NUTRASWEET IN NIGERIA, TO REDUCE COSTS OF SWEETENERS 
THE FIRM PROVIDES TO SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURERS.  SANI 
DANGOTE IS A PASSIONATE POLO PLAYER.  HE IS NOT 
PARTICULARLY WELL EDUCATED, HAVING ATTENDED A 
COMMERCIAL COLLEGE IN KANO.  HE ADMIRES AMERICANS AND 
SEEKS TO DO BUSINESS IN AMERICA.  HE IS AN OPEN, 
FRIENDLY, AND ENTERTAINING INTERLOCUTOR.  SANI DANGOTE 
IS MARRIED WITH FOUR CHILDREN, ONE OF THEM BORN IN THE 
U.S. 
 
17.  BELLO DANGOTE IS THE BROTHER CHARGED WITH 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAMILY BANK, LIBERTY MERCHAMT. 
HE WAS EDUCATED IN ITALY AS AN ENGINEER.  HE IS 
MARRIED, TO A SISTER OF SANI DANGOTE\'S WIFE, AND HAS 
THREE CHILDREN, TWO OF THEM BORN IN THE U.S.  LIKE HIS 
BROTHERS, HE IS FRIENDLY TO AMERICANS. 
 
18.  ALHAJI BASHIR BORODO IS A BUSINESSMAN ON A MORE 
MODEST SCALE THAN THE CLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  HE IS THE 
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THE DANTATA COMPANIES (A 
FERTILIZER MIXING PLANT IN KANO STATE) AND THE FORMER 
CHAIRMAN OF THE FORMERLY STATE-OWNED BANK, TROPICAL 
COMMERCIAL BANK, THAT HAS NOW PRIVATIZED.  HE ALSO HAS 
HIS OWN BUSINESS, BORODO AND CO., THAT PRODUCES ICE 
BLOCKS, EXPORTS MOTORBIKES, AND ENGAGES IN OTHER MIXES 
OF TRADING.  HE WAS TRAINED (IN CAIRO) AS AN ECONOMIST 
AND JOINED THE NIGERIAN FOREIGN SERVICE.  ONE OF HIS 
POSTINGS WAS AT THE EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON (FROM ABOUT 
1978 TO 198O) WHERE THE DESK OFFICERS FOUND HIM THE 
STRONGEST DIPLOMAT AT THE EMBASSY.  HE IS FAR AND AWAY 
THE MOST INTELLIGENT CONTACT WE HAVE FOUND ON THE 
ECONOMIC SCENE IN THE NORTH. 
 
19.  MALAM DAHIRU MUHAMMAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CEO 
OF FIRST AFRICA MERCHANT BANK, HEADQUARTERED IN 
KADUNA.  ACTUALLY WE TAKE THAT BACK ABOUT BORODO BEING 
THE \"MOST INTELLIGENT,\" SINCE DAHIRU MUHAMMAD IS IN THE 
SAME CLASS.  EDUCATED AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY, DAHIRU 
MUHAMMAD IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL-INFORMED AND 
OUTSPOKEN INFORMANT ON THE ECONOMIC SCENE.  LONG BEFORE 
IT BECAME THE FASHION, HE POINTED TO THE BUDGETARY AND 
MONETARY POLICIES OF THE BABANGIDA REGIME THAT 
BANKRUPTED THE NATION AND RIDICULED THE CALLS FOR 
ARTIFICIAL PEGGING OF THE NAIRA.  HE IS VERY OPEN TO 
AMERICANS AND WILLING TO MEET WITH US, OFFICIALLY OR 
SOCIALLY. 
 
20.  ISAIAH BALAT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE KADUNA 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND CHAIRMAN OF SEVERAL COMPANIES 
BASED IN KADUNA (FINANCE, OIL SERVICES, ETC.).  BALAT 
IS, TO US, MORE INTERESTING AS AN INTERLOCUTOR ON 
POLITICAL AND ETHNIC QUESTIONS THAN ON COMMERCIAL 
DEVELOPMENTS.  HE WAS ACTIVE IN THE SDP AND STRONGLY 
FOUGHT FOR ABIOLA AND JUNE 12 OVER THE SUMMER OF 1993, 
SEEING THE ISSUE ALMOST COMPLETELY THROUGH HIS SOUTHERN 
KADUNA-CHRISTIAN EYES.  HE IS VERY WELL CONNECTED IN 
KADUNA, FRIENDLY TO AMERICANS, AND HAPPY TO SHARE HIS 
THOUGHTS WITH US.  WE FOUND CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM 
PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ZANGON 
KATAF RIOTS, SINCE HE COMES FROM THAT AREA, AND, SINCE 
THEN, HAS WORKED ON A NUMBER OS COMMITTEES TO TRY TO 
GET AT THE CAUSES OF INTERCOMMUNAL TENSION IN THE STATE. 
 
21.  ALHAJI AUWALU ILU, PRESIDENT OF THE KANO CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE, AND BUSINESSMAN WITH INTERESTS IN CLOTH 
TRADING AND LPG SUPPLY.  AUWALU ILU IS AN ENGAGING 
INTERLOCUTOR WITH HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF THAT PART 
OF THE KANO ECONOMY THAT HIS CHAMBER MOST REPRESENTS -- 
THE ESTABLISHED, MID-RANKING TRADER.  HE IS ALWAYS GOOD 
FOR AN INTIMATE POLITICAL GOSSIP, BUT, OVER THE YEARS, 
WE HAVE FOUND THAT HE SWINGS AROUND A BIT WITH THE 
PREVAILING BREEZE.  NEVERTHELESS, HE KNOWS EVERYBODY 
AND IS ALWAYS WELCOMING TO US WHEN WE DROP IN.  HE HAS 
BEEN VERY HELPFUL DURING AMBASSADORIAL VISITS TO KANO, 
PARTICULARLY AS HE CAN PUT TOGETHER A GROUP FOR DINNER 
THAT IS ALWAYS WORTH MEETING AND TALKING TO. 
 
22.  ALHAJI BAWA GARBA.  WHEN GOD MADE \"ABG,\" HE BROKE 
THE MOLD.  BAWA GARBA IS THE SATTELITE TELEVISION MOGUL 
OF NIGERIA, AND HAS BRANCHED INTO TELEVISION ASSEMBLY, 
SECURITY DEVICES AND OTHER MANUFACTURES.  HE HAS A 
PROMOTIONAL PATTER THAT COULD COME STRAIGHT FROM 
HOLLYWOOD, EXCEPT FOR THE STRONG HAUSA ACCENT.  HE IS 
ACCESSIBLE TO AMERICANS BUT A SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULT 
CONVERSATION PARTNER THAN MOST NORTHERNERS, SINCE HE 
FREQUENTLY TALKS OVER HIS PARTNER. 
 
23.  ALHAJI KASSIM MUSA BICHI, NOW IN HIS OWN BUSINESS 
IN KANO BUT FORMERLY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF NEW 
NIGERIA INVESTMENTS LIMITED, THE FINANCE BRANCH OF 
NNDP, THE NORTHERN STATES\' HOLDING COMPANY.  BICHI HAS 
AN M.A. IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS FROM WILLIAMS COLLEGE 
AND IS FRIENDLY AND ENGAGING, ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT QUICK 
TO ADOPT PREJUDICES (E.G. AGAINST LEBANESE AND INDIANS 
IN THE NIGERIAN ECONOMY) FLOATING ABOUT IN THE AIR.  HE 
IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM, STRICTLY ADHERING TO THE DIETARY 
PRACTICES AND PRAYER SCHEDULES LAID DOWN, AND OBSERVING 
EXTRA FASTING AND NON-PHYSICAL CONTACT BETWEEN MEN AND 
WOMEN. 
 
POLITICS 
-------- 
 
24.  GEORGE HOOMKWAP, SENATOR (NPP) IN THE SECOND 
REPUBLIC AND SDP ACTIVIST IN THE THIRD, HE WAS MOST 
RECENTLY A NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LIAISON OFFICER FOR THE 
SHONEKAN ING.  HOOMKWAP COMES FROM PLATEAU STATE (GOMEI 
GROUP NEAR SHENDAM) AND IS A CATHOLIC.  HE IS ALSO 
CHAIRMAN OF THE JIB BREWERY GROUP IN JOS AND HAS HIS 
OWN MULTI-PURPOSE FIRM.  HOOMKWAP FULLY INTENDS TO BE 
IN THE POLITICAL WHIRLWIND WHENEVER IT STARTS BLOWING 
AGAIN, AND, ALONG WITH HIS SENIOR SOLOMON LAR, HE WILL 
BE AN IMPORTANT FIGURE IN PLATEAU POLITICS. 
 
25.  SENATOR UBA AHMED, SENATOR (NPN, THEN NRC) IN THE 
SECOND AND THIRD REPUBLICS, MOST RECENTLY THE SENATE 
MINORITY WHIP IN THE DISMISSED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. 
ALTHOUGH HE HAILS FROM BAUCHI STATE, HE IS ATTACHED BY 
HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS TO JOS AND LAGOS.  HE HOPES SOON 
TO RESUSCITATE AN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK LOAN TO 
START A FISHING BUSINESS, USING BOATS PROCURED IN 
ALABAMA.  HE IS A MOST ENGAGING FRIEND, WITH A GREAT 
SENSE OF HUMOR.  HE LIKES AMERICANS AND IS EASY TO TALK 
WITH, IF YOU CAN EVER TRACK HIM DOWN. 
 
26.  ALHAJI LEMA JIBRILU, CHAIRMAN OF A NUMBER OF 
KADUNA COMPANIES THATSBEAR VARIOUS TRANSMUTATIONS OF 
HIS INITIALS, MOSTLY BASED ON AGRIBUSINESS.  JIBRILU 
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST CANDIDATES (NRC) IN THE FAILED 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS OF 1991-93 AND ONE OF THE GROUP 
OF 23 DISQUALIFIED IN THE 1992 PRIMARIES.  IN THOSE 
PRIMARIES, JIBRILU ACTUALLY PULLED OUT AHEAD OF THE 
REST, ACCUSING HIS FELLOW CANDIDATES OF CORRUPT 
PRACTICES AND SAYING HE WOULD NOT CONTEST FURTHER.  ALL 
THE SAME, HE WAS DISQUALIFIED ALONG WITH THE REST.  HE 
HAS BEEN WELL-KNOWN TO SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF KADUNA 
U.S. DIPLOMATS AND IS A PERSON OF STRONG CHARACTER AND 
GREAT CHARM.  HE IS A DEVOUT MUSLIM AND HAS A CLOSE 
FAMILY -- HIS TWO SONS AND DAUGHTER FROM HIS FIRST 
MARRIAGE (TO AN ENGLISHWOMAN) HELP RUN PARTS OF THE 
BUSINESS, AS WILL, PRESUMABLY, THE TWO YOUNG SONS OF 
HIS SECOND MARRIAGE (TO A BRAZILIAN). 
 
THE ELDERS 
---------- 
 
27.  NO BIOGRAPHIC WRAP-UP CABLE WOULD BE COMPLETE 
WITHOUT A LOOK AT THE ELDERS.  THE ELDEST OF THEM ALL, 
ALHAJI ISA KAITA, HAS BEEN A FRIEND OF EVERY AMERICAN 
CONSUL GENERAL SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME.  IN OUR 
VIEW HE HAS BEEW A LITTLE READY TO ACCEPT WHATEVER THE 
AUTHORITY OF THE DAY WISHES OR DECREES, NOT STANDING ON 
ANY EASILY VISIBLE PRINCIPLE OTHER THAN AN ACCEPTANCE 
OF WHAT GOD SENDS.  NEVERTHELESS, ISA KAITA IS AN 
INSTITUTION.  THIS MAKES HIS CURRENT STATE VERY SAD, 
SINCE HE SUFFERED A STROKE LAST FALL WHILE ON THE 
LESSER PILGRIMAGE IN SAUDI ARABIA.  SINCE THAT TIME HE 
HAS BEEN BEDRIDDEN AND UNABLE TO MOVE HIS RIGHT ARM AND 
LEG.  ON OUR LAST CALL ON HIM, HE APPEARED DEPRESSED BY 
HIS CONDITION AND SOMEWHAT MORE FRAIL. 
 
28.  THE THREE FRIENDS: YAHAYA GUSAU, AHMED TALIB, AND 
LIMAN CIROMA.  THESE THREE, LISTED IN ORDER OF 
SENIORITY, ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED TOGETHER SINCE ALL 
SERVED IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF THE NORTHERN REGION 
UNDER THE SARDAUNA.  APL THREE ARE MEN OF UPSTANDING 
CHARACTER AND LONG EXPERIENCE, EXCEPTIOLT CORDIAL 
AND UNFAILI GLY COURTEOAS.  YAHAYA GUSAU, AS HIS NAME 
IMPLIES, COMES FROM GUSAU IN SOKOTO; AHMED TALIB FROM 
BORNO, AD LIMAN CIROMA FROM POTISKUM, YOBE STATE. 
GUSAU IS CURRENTLY THE CHANCELLOR OF BAYERO UNIVERSITY 
KANO, WHILE TALIB AND CIROMA SERVE AS CHAIRMEN OF THE 
BOARDS OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES.  CIROMA, THE 
YOUNGEST, HAS BEEN A FREQUENTLY INTERLOCUTOR AND OFTEN 
CALLS UP WHEN SOME EVENT (EITHER OUTRAGEOUS OR 
WONDERFUL BY HIS LIGHT) HAS BEEN BROADCAST ON CNN.
