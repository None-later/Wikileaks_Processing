SUBJECT:  NATO POLITICAL COMMITTEE DISCUSSION OF END OF 
          THE WARSAW PACT AND NEW SOVIET RELATIONS WITH 
          EASTERN EUROPE 
 
REF:  MOSCOW 9594 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  DURING TWO NATO POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
MARCH 26 AND APRIL 2, ALLIES REVIEWED THE IMPLICATIONS OF 
THE END OF THE WARSAW PACT AND NEW SOVIET RELATIONS WITH 
EASTERN EUROPE.  THE DISCUSSION COVERED BOTH SOVIET AND 
VARIOUS EASTERN EUROPEAN ATTITUDES TOWARDS THEIR NEW 
SECURITY RELATIONS.  MOST SAW THE SOVIETS AS SEEKING TO 
AVOID ISOLATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS FINDING IT 
DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME THE ANIMOSITY OF THE PAST FORTY 
YEARS.  ONE FOCUS OF DISCUSSION WAS THE NEW BILATERAL 
TREATIES WHICH THE SOVIETS ARE NEGOTIATING WITH FORMER WTO 
ALLIES.  THE FIRST SUCH TREATY WAS INITIALED WITH ROMANIA 
AND ACCORDING TO THE GERMANS CONTAINS CLAUSES ABOUT NOT 
JOINING ALLIANCES TO WHICH CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY HAVE 
MADE CLEAR THEY ARE NOT GOING TO AGREE.  VARIOUS OTHER 
BILATERAL ARRANGEMENTS AMONG EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS 
A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PACT WERE ALSO 
DISCUSSED AND THE IMS GAVE THEIR ANALYSIS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  IN TWO SUBSEQUENT POLITICAL COMMITTEE MEETINGS, ALLIES 
DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF THE END OF THE WARSAW PACT 
MILITARY STRUCTURES.  A NUMBER OF ALLIES FOUND THE FRENCH 
PAPER ON THE SUBJECT (FAXED TO EUR/RPM) TO BE A GOOD 
SUMMARY OF IMPLICATIONS FOR ARMS CONTROL AND EUROPEAN 
RELATIONS IN GENERAL. 
 
SOVIET VIEWS 
------------ 
4.  THE FRENCH REP SAID THAT IT WAS PREMATURE TO DRAW 
ULTIMATE CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE END OF THE 
WARSAW PACT.  IT WAS CLEAR FROM BILATERAL CONTACTS WITH 
THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHAT THEIR PREFERENCES WERE 
TO REPLACE THE PACT IN THEIR SECURITY POLICIES.  HOWEVER, 
IT WAS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND MOSCOW\'S REACTION 
AS WELL.  THE SOVIETS WERE AWARE OF THE DETERIORATION OF 
THEIR BASIC RELATIONS WITH THEIR FORMER ALLIES.  BUT, THEY 
ARE LESS CONSCIOUS OF THE REASONS FOR THAT CHANGE AS THEY 
BELIEVED EASTERN EUROPE ACTUALLY SAW SOME SECURITY BENEFIT 
FROM THE PACT AND TIES TO THE SOVIET UNION.  IN ANY CASE, 
MOSCOW UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A NEW BASIS FOR 
RELATIONS WHICH MEANS A REJECTION OF THE PAST. 
 
5.  THE ISSUE FOR THE SOVIETS IS HOW TO DEVELOP THOSE 
RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR OWN POLITICAL DISARRAY. 
THE SOVIET MILITARY IS INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO THE BLATANT 
MANIFESTATIONS OF DISLIKE FROM THE FORMER WP ALLIES, 
PARTICULARLY AS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN TEARING DOWN WAR 
MONUMENTS AND OTHER REMINDERS OF SOVIET TROOP PRESENCE. 
AT THE SAME TIME, SOME IN MOSCOW ARE AWARE THAT THE VERY 
INSTABILITY OF THE SOVIET UNION TODAY IS PERCEIVED BY 
EASTERN EUROPE AS A THREAT. 
 
6.  THIS LEAVES THE SOVIETS WITH TWO CHOICES:  LEAVE 
EASTERN EUROPE TO THE WEST AN ACCEPT ISOLATION OR DEVELOP 
NEW RELATIONS ON A MORE EQUAL BASIS.  OBVIOUSLY, THE 
SOVIETS DESPITE THE ODDS, WILL GO FOR THE LATER SOLUTION. 
THIS MEANS THAT THEY WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME STEPS TO REDUCE 
EASTERN EUROPEAN FEAR OF THE SOVIET UNION.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, MOSCOW WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT NATO SHOULD ALSO 
DISAPPEAR AND, IN ANY CASE, EASTERN EUROPE SHOULD NOT 
DEVELOP TOO CLOSE RELATIONS WITH IT.  THUS, THE SOVIETS 
WILL SEEK BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH SOME NEGATIVE SECURITY 
GUARANTEES AND, IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, MAINTAIN SOME FORM OF 
POLITICAL CONSULTATION WITH EASTERN EUROPE EITHER AS A 
VESTIGE OF THE PACT OR MORE LIKELY UNDER SOME NEW FORMAT. 
THE SOVIET MODEL REMAINS, AS EXPRESSED BY BESSMERTNYKH AT 
THE MEETING OF THE PACT CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE WHICH ENDED 
THE MILITARY STRUCTURE, TO DEVELOP RELATIONS WITH EASTERN 
EUROPE AS NEUTRALS ALONG THE LINE OF AUSTRIA AND FINLAND. 
THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE FOR THE SOVIETS IS 
SELF-ISOLATION. 
 
EASTERN EUROPE\'S SEARCH FOR NEW SECURITY RELATIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7.  THE NETHERLANDS REP NOTED THE PERCEPTION AMONG EASTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OF A SECURITY VACUUM WITH THE DEMISE OF 
THE PACT.  HE ARGUED THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF THE 
PACT\'S END WILL BE EASTERN EUROPE\'S SEARCH FOR NEW 
SECURITY STRUCTURES.  REVIEWING A DISCUSSION THE DUTCH 
EMBASSY IN WARSAW HAD WITH POLISH FOREIGN MINISTRY 
OFFICIAL TOWPIK, THE DUTCH REP SAID THAT THERE WERE THREE 
OPTIONS FOR EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES:  JOINING NATO, 
NEUTRALITY, AND USING CSCE STRUCTURES.  IN HIS REVIEW OF 
THESE OPTIONS, TOWPIK INDICATED THAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS 
NONE WAS APPROPRIATE IN CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED TO 
THE SENSE OF VACUUM, THE POLES BELIEVED THEY SHARED WITH 
CZECHOSLOVAKIA AND HUNGARY.  NATO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE 
SOVIET UNION HAD MADE CLEAR THAT IMMEDIATE MEMBERSHIP IN 
THE WESTERN ALLIANCE WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE NOW.  THE THREE 
COUNTRIES REJECTED NEUTRALITY BECAUSE IT SUGGESTED A 
BUFFER ZONE OR \"CORDON SANITAIRE,\" WHICH WAS NO GUARANTEE 
OF SECURITY, BUT RATHER A GREATER RISK.  FINALLY, CSCE 
INSTITUTIONS WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE 
SECURITY. 
 
8.  IN THIS CONTEXT, THE POLES WOULD TRY TO DEVELOP 
BILATERAL TIES WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS INCLUDING GERMANY AND 
THE SOVIET UNION.  BUT TOWPIK HAD NOTED TO HIS DUTCH 
INTERLOCUTOR THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS ALREADY SEEKING 
CLAUSES IN ITS BILATERAL TREATY WHICH WOULD LIMIT POLISH 
INDEPENDENCE.  THE NETHERLANDS REP CLOSED HIS PRESENTATION 
BY NOTING THAT THE POLISH MINISTER OF DEFENSE HAD 
SUGGESTED THAT IN THE SHORT TERM POLAND WOULD HAVE TO 
PRACTICE ARMED NEUTRALITY. 
 
9.  IN DEVELOPING THEIR NEW SECURITY CONCEPTS, THE 
HUNGARIANS WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND WOULD TRY TO MEET SOME 
SOVIET CONCERNS IN THE BILATERAL TREATY, THE GERMAN REP 
ADDED.  AT THE SAME TIME, HUNGARY WOULD SEEK TIES BOTH 
WITH OVERALL WESTERN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE NATO AND THE EC AS 
WELL AS SMALLER REGIONAL GROUPS LIKE THE PENTAGONALE. 
WHILE THEY RECOGNIZED THAT, IN SOME CASES, THESE GROUPS 
DID NOT HAVE A SECURITY PURPOSE, HUNGARY DID BELIEVE 
MEMBERSHIP IN A NUMBER OF GROUPS WITH WESTERN TIES AIDED 
THEIR SECURITY.  THE HUNGARIANS, UNLIKE THE POLES, TRIED 
NOT LIKE TO USE THE TERM SECURITY VACUUM BECAUSE IT 
IMPLIED THAT THERE WERE DISADVANTAGES TO THE END OF THE 
WARSAW PACT, WHILE THE HUNGARIANS CLEARLY SAW THE END OF 
THE PACT AS A NET SECURITY BENEFIT.  HUNGARY ALSO WANTED 
TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ANY PAN EUROPEAN SECURITY PROCESS. 
 
10.  THE UK REP NOTED THAT THE MORE THE EASTERN EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES REDEFINED THEIR SECURITY THE MORE IT APPEARED TO 
ISOLATE THE SOVIET UNION.  ALLIES HAD RECOGNIZED THE 
DANGERS INHERENT IN THIS PROCESS, AND THE SOVIETS WOULD 
USE THESE WESTERN AND EASTERN EUROPEAN CONCERNS ABOUT 
THEIR ISOLATION TO LIMIT THE WEST AND SPECIFICALLY NATO 
TIES TO EASTERN EUROPE.  THE POLES, DURING BRITISH FOREIGN 
OFFICE MINISTER HOGG\'S TRIP TO WARSAW, WERE AWARE OF THE 
SOVIET CONCERNS, BUT THEY REMAINED INTERESTED IN 
DEVELOPING TIES INCLUDING MILITARY LINKS TO NATO.  THEY 
RECOGNIZED THAT MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT POSSIBLE NOW BUT DID 
NOT WANT TO RULE IT OUT AS AN ULTIMATE EVENTUALITY, EITHER. 
 
BILATERAL TREATIES WITH THE SOVIETS 
----------------------------------- 
 
11.  THE GERMAN REP NOTED THAT AS PART OF LOOKING FOR NEW 
SECURITY RELATIONS, THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE 
WILLING TO SIGN NEW TREATIES WITH MOSCOW.  IN THAT 
CONTEXT, HE NOTED THAT DURING THE ROMANIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER\'S VISIT THERE, THE MINISTER HAD INITIALED THE 
TEXT OF THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN BILATERAL TREATY.  WHILE THE 
TEXT HAD NOT BEEN MADE PUBLIC ITS CONTENTS WERE OF HIGH 
INTEREST BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE MODEL FOR TREATIES WITH 
THE OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES.  IN FACT THE SOVIETS 
HAD MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANTED THESE TREATIES, WHICH WERE 
TO REPLACE THE WP AND THE BILATERAL SECURITY TREATIES 
UNDER IT, TO BE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME FOR ALL THE FORMER WP 
ALLIES. 
 
12.  THE GERMAN REP REPORTED THAT THEIR EMBASSIES IN 
MOSCOW AND BUCHAREST BOTH AGREED THAT THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN 
TREATY CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING SECURITY CLAUSES: 
 
--COMMITMENTS BY BOTH NOT TO JOIN ALLIANCES DIRECTED 
AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; 
 
--COMMITMENTS NOT TO LET THEIR TERRITORIES BE USED TO WAGE 
WAR AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; 
 
--COMMITMENTS NOT TO PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE OR OTHER 
SUPPORT TO STATES WAGING WAR AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY; 
 
--AGREEMENT TO BASE THEIR SECURITY ON THE COLLECTIVE 
SECURITY PRINCIPLES OF THE UN CHARTER; 
 
--AGREEMENT TO INFORM EACH OTHER OF A PERCEIVED THREAT TO 
THEIR RESPECTIVE SECURITIES; 
 
--AGREEMENT ON IMMEDIATE CONSULTATIONS IN THE CASE OF 
AGGRESSION AGAINST EITHER PARTY. 
 
13.  THE GERMAN REP SAID THAT SOVIET DEPUTY FOREIGN 
MINISTER KVITSINSKY HAD DEFENDED THE TREATY AS A SIGN OF 
GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS AND NOT AN ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THE 
PACT.  THE SOVIETS RECOGNIZED THAT THE ERA OF MILITARY 
PACTS WAS OVER AND CONTINUED TO ARGUE THAT ITS EVENTUAL 
EVOLUTION WOULD BE THE END OF NATO AS WELL. 
 
14.  THE GERMAN REP ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT THE CLAUSES IN 
THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN TREATY WENT WELL BEYOND ANY WHICH BONN 
ANTICIPATED OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WOULD 
ACCEPT.  HE NOTED THAT UNTIL THE INITIALING OF THE 
ROMANIAN TREATY, THE SOVIET/HUNGARIAN AGREEMENT WAS 
THOUGHT TO BE FARTHEST ADVANCED.  ANTALL WAS EXPECTED TO 
GO TO MOSCOW TO SIGN IT AT THE END OF APRIL.  HOWEVER, THE 
GERMAN REP INDICATED THAT HUNGARY WOULD AS SOON HAVE NO 
TREATY AS SIGN A TREATY WITH SUCH FAR REACHING CLAUSES. 
 
15.  THE U.S. REP SAID THAT HE WAS PERSONALLY SURPRISED 
WITHTHE CONTENT OF THE SOVIET/ROMANIAN TREATY WHICH HIS 
GERMAN COLLEAGUEHAD DESCRIBED.  DRAWING ON REFTEL, HE 
AGREED THAT OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN STATES WERE UNLIKELY TO 
BE WILLING TO GO AS FAR, AND NOTED THAT AS MUCH AS 25 
PERCENT OF THE SOVIET/HUNGARIAN TREATY REMAINED 
BRACKETED.  FROM REFTEL, HE DESCRIBED THE SOVIET INTEREST 
IN THIS NEW GENERATION OF TREATIES AND THE HOPE THAT THEY 
WOULD ALL BE SIMILAR AND WOULD BRING SOME OF THE FORMER 
WARSAW PACT GUARANTEES AND CONSULTATIONS INTO THE NEW 
RELATIONS. 
 
16.  THIS EXCHANGE LED TO A VIGOROUS DISCUSSION AS TO WHY 
THE ROMANIANS HAD ACCEPTED SUCH CLAUSES AND WHAT THE 
EFFECT WOULD BE ON OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.  THE 
SPANISH REP NOTED ROMANIA, BUT ALSO BULGARIA\'S SHAKY 
ECONOMIES WERE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE SOVIET UNION.  THE 
DUTCH REP AGREED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE NEW BILATERAL 
TREATIES AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY COULD EFFECT THE ENTIRE 
PAN-EUROPEAN SECURITY SITUATION.  HE ALSO REMINDED THE 
COMMITTEE THAT SOVIET AMBASSADOR AFANASSIEVSKY HAD 
PROPOSED TO THE SYG THAT NATO \"ENDORSE\" IN SOME WAY THESE 
\"SECURITY\" CLAUSES IN THE NEW BILATERAL TREATIES.  IF THEY 
WENT AS FAR AS THE ROMANIAN TREATY APPARENTLY DID, THAT 
WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE.  AND IN ANY CASE, NATO SHOULD NOT 
BE SEEN AS INTERFERING IN THE NEGOTIATION OF THESE TREATIES. 
 
17.  THE FRENCH REP SAID THAT SHE AGREED THESE NEW 
SECURITY TREATIES WERE AN IMPORTANT NEW FACTOR AND NATO 
SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR DEVELOPMENT CLOSELY.  IT WOULD, SHE 
SUGGESTED, BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE SOVIETS SOUGHT TO 
INCLUDE THE CONCEPTS IN THESE TREATIES IN THE EVOLUTION OF 
THE OVERALL EUROPEAN SECURITY ARCHITECTURE.

SUBJECT: NATO MOVES FORWARD WITH LANDMARK BALLISTIC MISSILE 
THREAT ASSESSMENT 
 
REF: C-M(2004)109 
 
Classified By: Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns for Reasons 1.4 (b/d) 
 
1.  (S) Summary: During the December 9 Ministerial meeting of 
the North Atlantic Council, Foreign Ministers noted the 
completion of the Longer-Term Analysis of Ballistic Missile 
Risks and Threats.  The fruit of more than 18 months of 
negotiations, the Analysis fulfills in part a 2002 Prague 
Summit tasking to examine options for addressing ballistic 
missile threats to the Alliance.  At 180 pages, it provides 
the most comprehensive assessment of WMD and ballistic 
missile (BM) proliferation trends the Alliance has ever 
produced.  Among the document\'s key findings are that some 
countries currently have the capability to launch a ballistic 
missile attack on NATO\'s southeastern flank and U.S. forces 
in the Pacific, and that the risk of a ballistic missile 
attack on any Alliance territory, population centers or NATO 
forces, while moderate, will remain a concern in the decade 
to come.  The Analysis contains unprecedented consensus 
positions on the intentions, capabilities and proliferation 
record of Iran, Syria and North Korea as well as Russia and 
China.  It also addresses the contributions of 
non-proliferation instruments, including new approaches such 
as PSI and UNSCR 1540, as well as the implications of the 
A.Q. Khan network. 
 
2.  (C) Combined with two major feasibility studies and 
ongoing technical consultations, the Analysis provides NATO 
with the political consensus and general assessment necessary 
to move forward with Alliance deliberations on the 
acquisition and fielding of defense capabilities against the 
full range of ballistic missile threats.  In this context, 
USNATO fully appreciates the Intelligence Community\'s strong 
support for the Analysis\'s development, will continue to 
request relevant U.S. intelligence releasable to NATO, and 
welcomes high-level and expert USG officials available to 
brief Allies in the Senior Politico-Military Group on 
Proliferation (SGP) and the North Atlantic Council (NAC) on 
WMD and BM proliferation-related topics.  End Summary. 
 
Context of the Longer-Term Analysis 
----------------------------------- 
 
3.  (U) While NATO has yet to make a definitive decision on 
missile defense for populations and territories, NATO\'s 
Strategic Concept notes that NATO\'s posture against the 
proliferation of WMD and their means of delivery \"must 
continue to improve, including through work on missile 
defense.\"  At the 2002 Prague Summit, NATO Heads of State and 
Government agreed \"to examine options for addressing the 
increasing missile threat to NATO territory, forces and 
population centers in an effective and efficient way through 
an appropriate mix of political and defense efforts, along 
with deterrence\" as well as to initiate a Theater Missile 
Defense (TMD) Feasibility Study. 
 
4.  (C) This TMD feasibility study, which focuses on the 
technical requirements, costs, and time scale of possible 
architectures for an Active-Layered Theater Ballistic Missile 
Defense (ALTBMD) system to protect NATO deployed forces, was 
completed in 2003.  In January 2004, a second Missile Defense 
Feasibility Study was contracted to examine options for 
protecting Alliance territory and population centers.  Upon 
its scheduled completion in July 2005, this study will be 
submitted to the Conference of National Armaments Directors, 
which will review and approve a consolidated report in late 
2005.  This report in turn will be forwarded to the Executive 
Working Group (Reinforced) (EWG(R)), NATO\'s primary forum for 
missile defense consultations. 
 
5.  (C) During the December 9 Ministerial meeting of the 
North Atlantic Council, Foreign Ministers noted the 
completion of the Longer-Term Analysis of Ballistic Missile 
Risks and Threats (reftel), which fulfilled another 2002 
Prague Summit tasking to assess current and potential WMD and 
ballistic missile threats to the Alliance over the next ten 
years.  The fruit of more than 18 months of negotiations, 
this 180-page Analysis contains unprecedented consensus 
positions on key countries of proliferation concern and 
provides the most comprehensive assessment of WMD and BM 
risks and threats the Alliance has ever produced. 
 
6.  (S) The Analysis is divided into five chapters, which 
address non-proliferation regimes and national measures; 
capabilities and intentions; alternative means of delivery; 
secondary proliferation and procurement networks; and 
 
 
intelligence gaps.  As a whole, it clearly demonstrates that 
NATO already faces certain risks and potential threats, and 
that the Alliance must continue to closely monitor the 
intentions and capabilities of countries of proliferation 
concern. 
 
7.  (C) Combined with the EWG(R)\'s ongoing work and the two 
Missile Defense Feasibility Studies, the Analysis provides 
NATO with the political consensus and general assessment 
necessary to move forward with Alliance deliberations on the 
acquisition and fielding of defense capabilities against 
ballistic missile threats.  This includes the goal of 
achieving initial operational capability for an ALTBMD system 
to protect NATO deployed forces by 2010 as well as possible 
steps toward acquiring capabilities to protect Alliance 
territory and population centers against the full range of BM 
threats. 
 
Key Findings of the Longer-Term Analysis 
---------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (S) The risk of a ballistic missile attack on any 
Alliance territory, population centers, or NATO deployed 
forces, while moderate, will remain a concern in the decade 
to come.  Iran and Syria have ballistic missiles that can 
reach parts of NATO territory and deployed forces, and they 
have chemical weapons (CW) for use as warheads.  Concerns 
over Russian and Chinese BM capabilities are currently 
primarily limited to the potential for accidental or 
unauthorized launches, and the risk that their technology 
will proliferate to unstable countries. 
 
9.  (S) Current and future assessments of BM capabilities 
must take into account scenarios where components 
indigenously developed or acquired from abroad are integrated 
into existing missile programs to improve accuracy and 
operational readiness.  Countries developing BMs may not 
necessarily follow U.S. or Russian patterns of development or 
deployment.  North Korea began fielding and selling the No 
Dong after a single flight test, and countries today may rely 
in part on computer modeling or other means aside from easily 
observable test launches to keep their development programs 
covert. 
 
10.  (S) Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are not widely 
recognized as an immediate threat to the Alliance, but an 
indirect risk to NATO deployed forces is possible.  In the 
future, there will be an increased risk that UAVs could be 
converted to carry and dispense CW and biological weapons 
(BW).  The willingness of some states and illegal entities to 
transfer UAV or cruise missile (CM) components, peripheral 
equipment or technology is increasing and requires effective 
counter-proliferation measures to reduce their availability. 
There is currently no disarmament or non-proliferation 
agreement that restrains the production, development or 
possession of UAVs and CMs. 
 
11.  (S) Possession of WMD and their means of delivery has 
become a major goal for both state and non-state actors for 
reasons of prestige, influence or deterrence.  Proliferating 
states and entities are employing increasingly sophisticated 
measures to obtain WMD- or BM-related equipment, materials 
and technologies.  Some countries that were proliferation 
customers in the 1980s have themselves become suppliers.  The 
development of indigenous capabilities in relevant dual-use 
applications such as nuclear power, biotechnology and space 
launch systems can help to conceal ultimate intentions. 
North Korea and Iran as well as Russian and Chinese entities 
are likely to remain the major suppliers of WMD- and 
BM-related equipment, materials and expertise.  The 
identification, monitoring, and eventual dismantlement of the 
A.Q. Khan network show that there is a complicated worldwide 
marketplace for these inputs. 
 
12.  (C) Although arms control agreements and 
non-proliferation regimes will continue to slow the 
proliferation of WMD and BMs, the capability of both 
suppliers and proliferants are likely to improve.  The 
adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 is the 
strongest affirmation of the international community\'s 
support for multilateral treaties and other international 
instruments that seek to prevent WMD proliferation. 
Traditional diplomatic measures are enhanced by new tools 
such as the Proliferation Security Initiative and Operation 
Active Endeavour, which serve to complement and strengthen 
international norms and mechanisms. 
 
 
Select Country-Specific Conclusions 
----------------------------------- 
 
North Korea: 
 
13.  (S) Recent developments in North Korea seem to indicate 
ambitions to use WMD combined with BMs not only as a 
deterrent but also as a political bargaining chip and a means 
of blackmail to obtain economic or financial aid.  Various 
sources place North Korea has having 10 to 30 kg of 
weapons-grade plutonium, and while North Korea claims to have 
a nuclear deterrent, there is uncertainty as to whether it 
currently has operational nuclear weapons for military use. 
It is possible that North Korea would use WMD and BMs if it 
felt that the survival of the regime was at stake. 
 
14.  (S) Pyongyang is reportedly developing a new land-mobile 
intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) derived from the 
Soviet SS-N-6 submarine-launched BM; if confirmed, this 
potential to use a more advanced propulsion technology would 
be of serious concern.  North Korea has continued with 
development work and ground-based testing of the Taepo 
Dong-2, which according to some Allies\' experts with a third 
stage could deliver a weapons payload of 500 kg up to 15,000 
km--i.e., all of the United States and Europe, albeit with 
very poor accuracy.  U.S. forces in the Pacific are within 
range of North Korean missiles, and it is cause for serious 
concern that North Korea\'s willingness to proliferate 
longer-range BM technology will hasten the risk to broad 
expanses of NATO territory. 
 
Iran: 
 
15.  (S) Iran continues to put a high priority on an 
ambitious BM program focused on the development of both 
liquid and solid propellant short-range BMs and medium-range 
BMs with assistance from Russia, North Korea and China. 
Tehran has announced its intention to put satellites into 
orbit, which would establish the technical base to develop an 
IRBM or intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capability. 
 Iran already has BM capabilities that put the southeastern 
flank of NATO within range, and within the next ten years, it 
is likely to produce qualitative and quantitative changes to 
its military capabilities that will significantly increase 
the potential threat to the Alliance and NATO forces deployed 
in the region. 
 
16.  (S) Concerns have been widely expressed over Iran\'s 
nuclear program and its failures and breaches regarding its 
Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), and the IAEA cannot positively identify that 
Iran\'s nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes. 
Should its nuclear program continue to proceed at the same 
pace, Iran could produce sufficient fissile material for a 
first nuclear device by 2010.  Iran is assessed to have an 
offensive BW program and has almost certainly conducted 
BW-related research using spray devices and adapted munitions 
for delivery.  Despite its ratification of the Chemical 
Weapons Convention (CWC), Iran is also assessed to be 
retaining an offensive CW program and has the technological 
capability to develop a CW warhead for use on BMs. 
 
Syria: 
 
17.  (S) There is no evidence that Syria plans to attempt to 
acquire or develop a nuclear weapons capability, and it 
currently lacks the resources, infrastructure and scientific 
expertise to pursue one.  Syria is judged to have a BW 
program in the research and development phase, as well as an 
advanced CW program that includes several facilities for 
testing, production and storage of CW.  Syria can produce 
SCUD missile fuel and various solid propellant ingredients, 
and continues to make progress in this area with probable 
Chinese and Iranian assistance.  It can deliver both sarin 
and VX with aerial bombs, SCUD-Bs and possibly SCUD-Cs. 
Qualitative and quantitative improvements in Syria\'s WMD and 
BM capabilities over the next ten years will increase the 
potential threat to NATO territory, notably the southeastern 
flank of the Alliance. 
 
China: 
 
18.  (S) China has a mature capability to develop and launch 
BMs with nuclear warheads and is carrying out a strategic 
modernization program to improve the quality of its arsenal, 
including replacing liquid-fueled ICBMs with solid-fuel 
systems and deploying more of its BMs on road-mobile 
 
 
launchers.  China is believed to have an advanced CW program 
as well as an offensive BW capability, and its voluntary 
declarations under the Biological and Toxin Weapons 
Convention are believed to be inaccurate and incomplete. 
While China has the capability to pose a potential threat to 
NATO territory or deployed forces, at present Beijing focuses 
on a strategic posture that defends its regional influence in 
Asia.  The greatest concern regarding Chinese capabilities is 
the risk of onward proliferation of technology and material 
to other countries.  In light of all these elements, NATO 
must remain aware of developments in China. 
 
Russia: 
 
19.  (S) While Moscow has no intention of executing military 
operations against the Alliance, Russia has a mature arsenal 
of BMs capable of delivering nuclear weapons to any part of 
NATO territory.  It is also modernizing its BMs at a measured 
pace and is pursuing warhead refurbishment.  While the 
Cooperative Threat Reduction program will continue to improve 
the security of non-deployed nuclear warheads, weapons-grade 
fissile material will likely remain vulnerable to theft. 
Russia\'s BW program, which is probably still offensive, 
remains active and declarations to date have failed to reveal 
the full size and scope of the Soviet program.  Russia 
possesses a number of unacknowledged CW agents and weapons, 
and it cannot be entirely excluded that Russia could pursue 
some non-compliant activity without detection.  It has given 
priority to the development of modern CW systems and agents 
designed to defeat NATO protective systems and circumvent the 
CWC.  In light of its WMD and BM capabilities, NATO must 
remain concerned about the potential threat from Russia. 
 
Small Step for NATO MD, Giant Leap for SGP 
------------------------------------------ 
 
20.  (S) Comment: While the Longer-Term Analysis is but one 
of many inputs into the equation that will determine how NATO 
will face the spread of WMD and BM capabilities, it has also 
succeeded in highlighting proliferation issues of key 
importance to the U.S.  Spirited and sometimes contentious 
debate with Allies (especially France and Germany) over Iran, 
North Korea, and China in the SGP has in the end produced a 
broad and agreed foundation for continued engagement with 
Allies on tough proliferation questions.  In this context, 
USNATO fully appreciates the Intelligence Community\'s strong 
support for the Analysis\'s development, will continue to 
request relevant U.S. intelligence releasable to NATO, and 
welcomes high-level and expert USG officials available to
