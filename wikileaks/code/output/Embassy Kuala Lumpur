SUBJECT:  TIME UPSETS MAHATHIR 
 
1.  PRIME MINISTER MAHATHIR RESPONDED WITH ANTI-WEST 
RHETORIC TO AN ARTICLE IN THE APRIL 10 ISSUE OF TIME 
MAGAZINE WHICH ALLEGED THAT ABU SAYYAF, A SMALL MUSLIM 
EXTREMIST GROUP BASED IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES, WAS 
RECEIVING ARMS, MONEY AND TRAINING FROM ISLAMIC GROUPS 
IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES INCLUDING MALAYSIA.  THE ARTICLE 
ALSO REPORTED THAT \"THE GROUP USES TRAINING CAMPS IN 
MALAYSIA AND IS EXPECTING ARMS SHIPMENTS FROM 
SUPPORTERS THERE.\"  THE PRIME MINISTER DESCRIBED THE 
PIECE AS A \"PART OF A CAMPAIGN BY THE WESTERN MEDIA TO 
DISCREDIT MALAYSIA\" TO \"DETER PEOPLE FROM INVESTING 
AND VISITING HERE, GENERALLY AIMED AT UNDERMINING THE 
NATION\'S ECONOMY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT.\"  PEOPLE UNHAPPY 
WITH MALAYSIA\'S \"VOCIFEROUS\" STAND ON INTERNATIONAL 
ISSUES, HE EXPLAINED, WERE BEHIND THE WESTERN MEDIA\'S 
CONSPIRACY.  HE ALSO CONFIDENTLY CHALLENGED TIME TO 
\"COME TO MALAYSIA AND MAKE A REPORT HERE\" THAT 
MALAYSIA IS TRAINING TERRORISTS.  THE INFORMATION 
MINISTER ECHOED THE PM\'S LINE.  NO ONE FROM THE GOM 
HAS FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY COMPLAINED ABOUT THE 
ARTICLE TO US.  SEVERAL OF OUR MALAYSIAN CONTACTS ARE 
CURIOUS ABOUT THE STORY -- THEY WANT TO KNOW IF IT\'S 
TRUE. 
 
2.  COMMENT:  MAHATHIR WAS STILL ANXIOUS ABOUT THE 
NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A RECENT FORTUNE ARTICLE WHICH 
DESCRIBED THE MALAYSIAN CURRENCY AS AT RISK 
POST-MEXICO, WHEN THE TIME PIECE CAME OUT.  HE ORDERED 
A DELAY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TIME ISSUE BUT DID 
NOT BAN IT.  (OBSERVERS EXPECT THE MAGAZINE WILL BE 
ALLOWED ON THE SHELVES IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.)  WITH 
THE GENERAL ELECTION JUST AROUND THE CORNER, HIS 
RHETORIC WAS VERY MUCH EXPECTED SINCE CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES STILL HAVE A FOLLOWING HERE.  HOWEVER, AS 
COMPARED TO HIS PREVIOUS BOUTS WITH WESTERN MEDIA 
(MOST NOTABLY, DENYING CONTRACTS TO BRITISH FIRMS IN 
RESPONSE TO AN UNFLATTERING ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH 
PRESS), THE PM\'S REACTION TO FORTUNE AND NOW TIME 
PIECES HAS BEEN MODERATE AND APPARENTLY SHORT LIVED. 
THERE MAY BE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS.  DIFFERENT FROM 
PREVIOUS CASES, MAHATHIR WAS NOT PERSONALLY MENTIONED 
IN THE STORIES.  FURTHER, THE LAST TWO ANTI-BRITISH 
AND ANTI-AUSTRALIAN OUTINGS HAVE NOT BEEN VIEWED AS 
CLEAR-CUT VICTORIES FOR THE PM.  FINALLY, GIVEN THE 
MURKY GENERAL HISTORY OF MORO-MALAYSIAN DEALINGS, HE 
MAY FEEL IT BEST NOT TO GO INTO TOO MANY DETAILS.  THE 
FACT THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED ALMOST NO QUERIES FROM THE 
PRESS IS FURTHER INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES 
NOT WISH TO MAKE AN ISSUE OF THIS AT THIS TIME.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, MY 
SUBJECT: MAHATHIR FEUDING WITH ISLAMIC CONSERVATIVES 
 
1. CLASSIFIED BY JOHN R. MALOTT, AMBASSADOR.  REASON: 
1.5(D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY.  AS MALAYSIA\'S CURRENCY HAS TUMBLED AND 
ITS SKIES HAVE FILLED WITH HAZE, PM MAHATHIR HAS STILL 
FOUND TIME FOR A NASTY DISPUTE WITH ISLAMIC 
CONSERVATIVES.  RECENT ACTIONS BY ZEALOUS RELIGIOUS 
OFFICIALS LED THE PM TO ANNOUNCE A PLAN TO UNIFY SYARIAH 
LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL (STRIPPING POWER FROM STATE 
RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS) AND TO CALL PUBLICLY FOR A MORE 
MODERATE, MODERN ISLAM.  OUTRAGED MOSLEM CLERICS HAVE 
CIRCULATED ANONYMOUS LITERATURE ATTACKING THE PM AND THE 
RULING PARTY AND HAVE CRITICIZED THE GOVERNMENT IN FRIDAY 
SERMONS.  THE PROMINENT MUFTI OF SELANGOR STATE EVEN 
CALLED MAHATHIR AN APOSTATE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REACTED 
BY SACKING THE MUFTI, WARNING OTHER ISLAMIC LEADERS, AND 
CURTAILING OPEN DISTRIBUTION OF ISLAMIC OPPOSITION PARTY 
LITERATURE.  THE WIDER MALAY COMMUNITY SHARES SOME OF THE 
CLERICS\' CONCERNS, THOUGH FAR LESS ACUTELY; WOMEN 
ACTIVISTS SEEM TO BE THE SOLE MOSLEM CONSTITUENCY 
SQUARELY BACKING THE PM.  DESPITE MAHATHIR\'S BIZARRE 
OUTBURSTS AGAINST \"THE WEST\" DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, 
IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THE PM ADVOCATES A VERSION OF 
ISLAM THAT SERVES U.S. INTERESTS IN MALAYSIA AND IN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC COMMUNITY.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER 
MAHATHIR\'S HEIR APPARENT, DEPUTY PM ANWAR, WHO IS SO 
REASONABLE ON MANY ISSUES, HAS THE POLITICAL POSITION OR 
THE DESIRE TO TAKE ON MOSLEM CONSERVATISM AS VIGOROUSLY 
AS MAHATHIR HAS DONE.  IN THE LONG RUN, THE GROWING 
PROPORTION OF  MALAYS IN  MALAYSIA\'S ETHNIC  MIX WILL 
PROBABLY LEAD INEXORABLY TO THE FURTHER ISLAMIZATION OF 
MALAYSIAN SOCIETY.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MAHATHIR ATTACKS CONSERVATIVE ISLAM 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. (U) PM MAHATHIR, LIKE MANY OTHER WESTERN-EDUCATED 
MALAYS OF HIS GENERATION, IS AN OBSERVING MOSLEM WITH A 
MODERATE, LARGELY SECULAR WORLD VIEW.  SEVERAL INCIDENTS 
INVOLVING ZEALOUS ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES HAVE ANGERED THE PM 
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  IN JULY, A UNIT OF THE 
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION PROPOSED MAKING THE STUDY OF 
\"ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION\" COMPULSORY FOR ALL STUDENTS, 
INCLUDING NON-MALAYS (IN MALAYSIA, MALAYS ARE NEARLY ALL 
MOSLEMS AND, EXCEPT FOR SOME INDIAN MOSLEMS, NON-MALAYS 
ARE NEARLY ALL NON-MOSLEMS).  AFTER PROTESTS (AND THE 
PM\'S INTERVENTION), THE REQUIRED COURSE WAS BROADENED TO 
\"ASIAN CIVILIZATION.\"  IN AUGUST, SELANGOR STATE 
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES LED THREE MALAY WOMEN AWAY IN 
HANDCUFFS FOR TAKING PART IN A BEAUTY PAGEANT, ATTRACTING 
THE ATTENTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL PRESS.  ALSO IN 
AUGUST, SARAWAK ISLAMIC AUTHORITIES WARNED SEVERAL MALAY 
MEN NOT TO TAKE PART IN A BODYBUILDING COMPETITION THAT 
INCLUDED POSING IN BRIEF OUTFITS.  THE BODYBUILDERS 
IGNORED THIS WARNING AND NEVER RECEIVED PUNISHMENT, 
HOWEVER. 
 
4. (C) AFTER THE MESSY BEAUTY CONTEST INCIDENT, THE PM 
SAID THAT BY EARLY 1998 THE GOVERNMENT WOULD UNIFY 
SYARIAH LAW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THUS SHARPLY CURBING THE 
AUTONOMY OF LOCAL RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES.  THE PM SAID 
VARYING STATE INTERPRETATIONS OF ISLAMIC LAW \"CONFUSED 
THE PEOPLE\" AND ORDERED ALL ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES 
SUSPENDED PENDING THE REVIEW OF STATE LAWS.  HE ALSO 
ORDERED STATE MUFTIS TO REVIEW ALL PROPOSED DECREES WITH 
AN ADVISORY PANEL THAT MUST INCLUDE WOMEN 
REPRESENTATIVES.  THEORETICALLY, THE GOVERNMENT\'S PLAN 
FOR STANDARDIZATION OF SYARIAH LAW WILL REQUIRE THE 
AGREEMENT OF THE STATES\' RULING SULTANS, BUT SUCH 
CONSTITUTIONAL NICETIES HAVE RARELY DELAYED THE PM 
BEFORE.  THE \"UNIFICATION\" OF SYARIAH LAW EARLY NEXT YEAR 
IS ALREADY A FAIT ACCOMPLI AND CONSERVATIVE CLERICS KNOW 
IT, BUT DON\'T LIKE IT. 
 
5. (C) IN EARLY SEPTEMBER, MAHATHIR UNEXPECTEDLY TOOK UP 
THE ISLAMIC ISSUE IN HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE UMNO 
(MALAYSIA\'S RULING PARTY) GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  IN HIS 
SPEECH, MAHATHIR CALLED ON MALAYS TO REJECT EXTREMISM AND 
NOTED THE RESULTS OF SECTARIAN VIOLENCE IN BOSNIA AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST.  HE SAID MOSLEMS NEEDED TO MODERNIZE THEIR 
BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IN ACCORD WITH THE CHANGED 
CONDITIONS OF MODERN LIFE.  HE ALSO CRITICIZED MOSLEMS 
WHO PUT MORE STOCK IN OUTWARD APPEARANCES (SUCH AS 
TRADITIONAL CLOTHES AND BEARDS FOR MEN AND HEADSCARVES 
FOR WOMEN) THAN IN LEADING A MORAL LIE.  SUCH A SPEECH 
MIGHT SOUND SENSIBLE ENOUGH TOWESTERN EARS, BUT BY ALL 
ACCOUNTS IT WAS A DISASER WITH THE LARGELY MALAY 
AUDIENCE (MANY OF THE EN IN WHICH, INCLUDING DEPUTY PM 
ANWAR, SPORTING RADITIONAL DRESS AND GOATEES AND MOST OF 
THE WOMN, INCLUDING ANWAR\'S WIFE, WEARING HEADSCARVES). 
PRESS COMMENT AND PUBLICDISCUSSION OF THE KEYNOTE 
SPEECH, IN PREVIOUS YEARS A PROMINENT ITEM OF PULIC 
DEBATE, WAS VIRTUALLY NIL.  UMNO MEMBERS QUOTED IN THE 
PRESS WERE NON-COMMITTAL, WITH ONE SAYIG ONLY THAT THE 
TOPIC REQUIRED SERIOUS THOUGHT. AS ONE ANALYST SAID, NO 
ONE BUT MAHATHIR WOULD DRE TOUCH SUCH A SUBJECT. 
 
CONSERVATIVES COUNTER-TTACK 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (C) UNLIKE UMNO MEMBERS, SOME CONSERVATIVES DID NOT 
HESITTE TO EXPRESS THEIR OUTRAGE OVER MAHATHIR\'S ATTACK 
ON \"EXTREMIST\" ISLAM.  MALAYSIA\'S SOLE ISLAMIC PPOSITION 
PARTY, PAS, ISSUED A POINT FOR POINT REBUTTAL ON ITS WEB 
SITE AND IN THE PARTY NEWSPAPER.  THE PAS PARTY NEWSPAPER 
ALSO DROPPED A BOMBSHELL BY REPORTING THAT THE PROMINENT 
MUFTI OF SELANGOR STATE HAD CALLED MAHATHIR AN APOSTATE. 
THOUGH THE MUFTI LATER DENIED THE REPORT, MANY (SECOND 
HAND) SOURCES CLAIM THE QUOTATION WAS ACCURATE.  ONE 
SOURCE NOTED THAT THE SELANGOR MUFTI NOW GETS A WARM 
RECEPTION WHEN HE VISITS RELIGIOUS LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE 
COUNTRY.  REPORTEDLY, FRIDAY SERMONS AT MANY MOSQUES HAVE 
INCLUDED BOTH OBLIQUE AND DIRECT CRITICISM OF THE 
GOVERNMENT.  THE POLICE CONFIRMED PUBLICLY THAT ANONYMOUS 
\"POISON PEN\" LITERATURE CRITICIZING THE PM IS CIRCULATING 
AT MOSQUES. 
 
GOVERNMENT TIGHTENS SCREWS 
-------------------------- 
 
7. (U) THE GOVERNMENT HAS RESPONDED FIRMLY TO AGITATION 
BY RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES.  AFTER THE APOSTATE REPORT, 
THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IT WOULD ENFORCE A PREVIOUSLY 
IGNORED BAN ON STREET SALES OF THE PAS NEWSPAPER (UNDER 
MALAYSIAN LAW PARTY PUBLICATIONS MAY ONLY BE DISTRIBUTED 
TO PARTY MEMBERS).  MAHATHIR SAID \"SINCE WE FIND THE 
TABLOID IS LIBELOUS, WE WILL ENFORCE THE BAN 
IMMEDIATELY.\"  ON OCTOBER 14, GOVERNMENT MINISTER IN THE 
PM\'S DEPARTMENT  ABDUL HAMID OTHMAN WARNED MOSLEM GROUPS 
NOT TO \"UNDERMINE THE GOVERNMENT.\"  HE SAID THE 
GOVERNMENT WAS AWARE OF SOME RELIGIOUS LEADERS\' ATTEMPTS 
TO FOMENT TENSION IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS AND WAS 
MONITORING MOSLEM GROUPS.  ON OCTOBER 15, THE UMNO- 
CONTROLLED STATE GOVERNMENT OF SELANGOR ANNOUNCED THE 
TERM OF THE MUFTI OF SELANGOR WOULD NOT BE EXTENDED.  THE 
CHIEF MINISTER OF SELANGOR SAID THE STATE NEEDED A MUFTI 
WHOSE VIEWS \"WERE ACCEPTABLE TO ALL.\"  GRUMBLING IN THE 
RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY LED ABDUL HAMID TO SAY ON OCTOBER 19 
THAT THE \"DECISION IS FINAL\" AND WAS TAKEN BECAUSE OF THE 
MUFTI\'S ADVANCED AGE.  THE MINISTER\'S STATEMENT WAS A BIT 
CURIOUS FOR TWO REASONS: 1) CURTAILING OF THE MUFTI\'S 
TERM WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A STATE, NOT A FEDERAL 
DECISION; AND 2) THE PM HIMSELF HAS REPEATEDLY STATED 
THAT HE WILL NOT STEP DOWN, THOUGH HE IS ONE YEAR OLDER 
THAN THE MUFTI. 
 
VIEWS FROM THE STREET 
--------------------- 
 
8. (C) MANY MALAYS, ESPECIALLY IN URBAN AREAS, SYMPATHIZE 
SOMEWHAT WITH THE PM\'S VIEWS ON RELIGIOUS ZEALOTRY.  THE 
BEAUTY PAGEANT CASE STRUCK MANY AS INDEED EXTREME (IT 
TURNED OUT THAT RELIGIOUS POLICE HAD BOUGHT TICKETS TO 
THE SHOW AND EATEN THE DINNER PROVIDED BEFORE SLAPPING 
HANDCUFFS ON THE MALAY WOMEN IN A WAY DESIGNED TO BE 
HUMILIATING).  PROPONENTS OF CONSERVATIVE ISLAM ARE THUS 
A VOCAL MINORITY, THOUGH WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESERVOIRS OF 
SUPPORT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, ON THE EAST COAST, AND AMONG 
SOME POCKETS OF RELIGIOUS URBAN DWELLERS.  NONETHELESS, 
MAHATHIR\'S REMARKS AT THE UMNO GENERAL ASSEMBLY RAISED 
CONCERNS EVEN AMONG MORE SECULARLY MINDED MALAYS.  ONE 
PROMINENT UMNO POLITICIAN ASKED US RHETORICALLY: \"WHAT 
WILL THE PM SAY NEXT, THAT WE SHOULD EAT PORK?\"  THIS IS 
PERHAPS NOT A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF MAHATHIR\'S VIEWS, 
BUT IT SHOWS THE ANXIETY THAT EVEN MODERATES FEEL ABOUT 
THE TONE AND DIRECTION OF HIS IDEAS ON \"MODERNIZING\" 
ISLAM. 
 
 
WOMEN AND ISLAM 
--------------- 
 
9. (U) ISLAMIC WOMEN ACTIVISTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE 
FULLY BEHIND MAHATHIR.  GROUPS LIKE \"SISTERS OF ISLAM\" 
HAVE LONG BEEN AGITATING FOR MANY OF THE SAME REFORMS 
MAHATHIR HAS PROPOSED.  THE MODERNIZATION OF ISLAMIC 
ATTITUDES TOWARD WOMEN AND THE CREATION OF LEGAL AND 
SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT BETTER PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF 
MOSLEM WOMEN ARE FULLY CONSONANT WITH MAHATHIR\'S IDEAS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (C) THE PM HAS BEEN ON A VERBAL RAMPAGE LATELY, 
UTTERING BIZARRE REMARKS (LIKE HIS ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS 
LAST WEEK) THAT ALMOST SEEM PURPOSELY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. 
WHILE WE FOCUS ON MAHATHIR\'S ANTI-WESTERN REMARKS, IT IS 
WORTH REMEMBERING THAT MAHATHIR LASHES OUT AGAINST 
ANYTHING HE DOESN\'T LIKE, FROM LITTERBUGS TO \"RADICAL 
ISLAM.\"  HE CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATES A MODERATE ISLAM 
SQUARELY IN LINE WITH U.S. INTERESTS AND VALUES.  THE PM, 
FOR BETTER OR WORSE, IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE ON ANYONE, 
INCLUDING CONSERVATIVE ISLAMIC GROUPS THAT GENERALLY HAVE 
NEGATIVE VIEWS TOWARD THE U.S.  MAHATHIR IS ALSO 
IMPORTANT AS A VOICE OF MODERATION WITHIN THE 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC COMMUNITY.  THOUGH THE PM\'S HEIR 
APPARENT, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ANWAR, IS THE PM\'S \"GOOD 
CONSCIENCE,\" ANWAR HAS NOT PROVEN HE HAS EITHER THE 
POLITICAL STANDING OR THE DESIRE TO TAKE ON CONSERVATIVE 
ISLAM.  ANWAR STARTED HIS CAREER AS A MOSLEM ACTIVIST AND 
SEEMS LOATH TO CONFRONT HIS FORMER ASSOCIATES.  FOR 
EXAMPLE, ANWAR\'S REACTION TO THE BEAUTY PAGEANT INCIDENT, 
WHICH HAPPENED WHILE THE PM WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND 
ANWAR WAS IN CHARGE, WAS MUCH LESS VIGOROUS.  MOREOVER, 
ANWAR, IF HE DOES BECOME THE NEXT PM, WILL NOT HAVE 
MAHATHIR\'S ALMOST UNQUESTIONED AUTHORITY.  THUS, FOR 
POLITICAL REASONS HE MAY BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE STRONG 
STANDS THAT UPSET THE VOCAL RELIGIOUS CONSTITUENCY. 
 
IN THE LONG RUN ... 
------------------- 
 
11. (C) IN THE LONG RUN DEMOGRAPHICS WILL PROBABLY 
DICTATE AN INCREASED ROLE FOR ISLAM IN MALAYSIA.  MALAYS 
NOW CONSTITUTE 55 PERCENT OF MALAYSIA\'S POPULATION. 
GOVERNMENT PRO-NATALIST POLICIES FOR MALAYS ARE PREDICTED 
TO LEAD TO A 70 PERCENT MALAY MAJORITY BY 2020.  SOME 
ANALYSTS SAY THAT URBANIZATION AND ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION 
WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASINGLY SECULAR MALAY COMMUNITY. 
RECENT EVENTS SHOW THE OPPOSITE ALSO COULD HAPPEN, 
HOWEVER.  AS THE OUTSIDE WORLD IMPINGES ON TRADITIONAL 
MALAY CULTURE, MANY MALAYS SEEM TO BE REACTING BY TURNING 
BACK TO THEIR ISLAMIC ROOTS -- AT LEAST IN EXTERNAL FORMS 
OF OBSERVANCE.  FOR INSTANCE, OVER THE PAST DECADE 
NOTICEABLY MORE MALAY WOMEN NOW WEAR HEADSCARVES.  THIS 
ISLAMIC RESURGENCE, EVEN IN ITS MILD MALAYSIAN FORM, 
WORRIES MALAYSIA\'S NON-MALAY COMMUNITIES.  GIVEN 
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER 
MAHATHIR\'S SUCCESSOR (WHETHER ANWAR OR SOMEONE ELSE) WILL 
HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO MAKE SURE DIFFERENCES DO NOT 
GET OUT OF HAND.  WE EXPECT, THEREFORE, ISLAMIC ISSUES 
BECOME TO BECOME MORE PROMINENT IN COMING YEARS.

SUBJECT: MALAYSIA PROBES MISUARI TIES TO ABU SAYYAF GROUP 
 
REF: (A) KUALA LUMPUR 2446 (B) MANILA 6796 
 
CLASSIFIED BY A/DCM JAMES F. ENTWISTLE FOR REASONS 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY: CONCERNED THAT ANY CHARGES FILED 
AGAINST NUR MISUARI HERE WOULD PROVOKE A DOMESTIC 
BACKLASH, MALAYSIAN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INSIST THEY 
ARE PREPARED TO DEPORT THE MORO NATIONAL LIBERATION 
FRONT (MNLF) LEADER TO THE PHILIPPINES.  NEVERTHELESS, 
MALAYSIA\'A SECURITY APPARATUS IS INCREASINGLY 
INTERESTED IN MISUARI\'S ALLEGED CONNECTION TO THE ABU 
SAYYAF GROUP AND POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT IN THE 
KIDNAPPING OF WESTERN TOURISTS ON THE MALAYSIAN ISLAND 
OF SIPADAN IN 2000.  ACCORDING TO A FOREIGN MINISTRY 
CONTACT, MANILA IS SHARING INTELLIGENCE ON MISUARI\'S 
POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE SIPADAN KIDNAPPING, WITH THE HOPE 
THAT A RESULTING INVESTIGATION WOULD KEEP THE REBEL 
LEADER INCARCERATED IN A MALAYSIAN JAIL.  THE MFA 
MAINTAINED THAT MANILA IS TALKING OUT OF TWO SIDES OF 
ITS MOUTH, WITH PRESIDENT ARROYO\'S OFFICE INDICATING 
THAT MISUARI\'S ACTIVITIES MAY REQUIRE A PROLONGED 
MALAYSIAN INVESTIGATION, AND THE PHILIPPINE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY CLAIMING THAT MANILA IS READY TO ACCEPT 
MISUARI IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING ELECTIONS IN THE 
AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MINDANAO (ARMM).  AN MFA CONTACT 
OPINED THAT GOP FOOT-DRAGGING IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FEARS 
THAT A REBELLION TRIAL FOR MISUARI IN THE PHILIPPINES 
MAY NOT ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A CONVICTION, AND IN THE 
END HE MAY JUST \"SLIP AWAY.\" END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) THE LOCAL PRESS REPORTED NOVEMBER 28 THAT 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER ABDULLAH BADAWI SAID THE GOM IS 
READY TO IMMEDIATELY DEPORT MISUARI AT MANILA\'S 
REQUEST.  CHIEF MINISTER OF THE BORNEO STATE OF SABAH, 
CHONG KAH KIAT, SAID THAT MALAYSIA \"WOULD LOVE TO SEND 
HIM BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\"  CABINET MINISTER FOR 
YOUTH AND SPORT AND UMNO YOUTH CHIEF HISHAMMUDDIN 
HUSSEIN, WHO KNOWS MISUARI PERSONALLY AND EVEN 
DESCRIBES HIM AS A \"FRIEND,\" CALLED FOR MISUARI\'S 
IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION TO THE PHILIPPINES. 
HISHAMMUDDIN, WHO IS LIKELY NOW DEFENSIVE ABOUT HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MISUARI, TOLD THE PRESS THAT 
MISUARI\'S ACTIONS \"CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF MUSLIMS 
AND TARNISH THE SANCTITY OF ISLAM.\"  UNMO YOUTH 
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL MEMBER SHAMSUL ANWAR SULAIMAN TOLD 
US THAT THE PARTY HAD SENT A STRONG RECOMMENDATION TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER THAT MISUARI BE RETURNED TO THE 
PHILIPPINES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  SHAMSUL CONFIRMED 
THAT HE, HISHAMUDDIN, AND OTHER UMNO FIGURES HAD BEEN 
CLOSE TO MISUARI IN THE PAST. 
 
3. (C) WHILE THE GOM MAY WISH TO BE RID OF MISUARI, 
THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN HIS ALLEGED CONNECTION 
WITH THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP AND HIS POSSIBLE ROLE IN THE 
SIPADAN ISLAND KIDNAPPINGS IN 2000. FOLLOWING A 
MEETING OF THE MALAYSIA\'S NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL 
NOVEMBER 24, AN UNNAMED OFFICIAL TOLD THE LOCAL PRESS 
THAT MISUARI AND HIS CAPTURED AIDES COULD PROVIDE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF \"MILITANT GROUPS.\" 
A FOREIGN MINISTRY CONTACT IN THE SOUTHEAST ASIA 
DIVISION, ZULKEFLY MD NOOR (STRICTLY PROTECT) SAID 
THAT MANILA WAS NOW \"ALERTING\" THE MALAYSIAN 
AUTHORITIES TO MISUARI\'S CONNECTIONS TO ABU SAYYAF AND 
THE SIPADAN KIDNAPPINGS, PERHAPS AS A CONVENIENT WAY 
TO KEEP MISUARI INCARCERATED IN MALAYSIA WHILE THE 
MALAYSIAN POLICE CARRY OUT WHAT IS SURE TO BE A 
COMPLEX TERRORISM INVESTIGATION.  THE INSPECTOR 
GENERAL OF THE ROYAL MALAYSIA POLICE, NORIAN MAI, 
ACKNOWLEDGED TO THE PRESS THAT MISUARI AND HIS SIX 
CAPTURED SUPPORTERS WERE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR LINKS 
TO THE ABU SAYYAF GROUP, THOUGH NONE OF THE MEN, 
INCLUDING MISUARI, HAVE BEEN FORMALLY CHARGED. 
 
4. (C) ZULKEFLY PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO 
THE GOM\'S DEALINGS WITH MANILA, MAINTAINING THAT THE 
GOP IS TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF ITS MOUTH.  WHILE 
THE PHILIPPINE FOREIGN MINISTRY KEEPS ASSURING THE GOM 
THAT MISUARI\'S DEPORTATION WILL BE REQUESTED FOLLOWING 
THE COMPLETION OF ELECTIONS IN MINDANAO, PRESIDENT 
ARROYO\'S OFFICE HAS INDICATED THAT THE GOM \"SHOULD BE 
PREPARED FOR THE LONG-HAUL.\"  ACCORDING TO ZULKEFLY, 
THE GOP FEARS THAT PUTTING MISUARI ON TRIAL FOR 
REBELLION WILL NOT ONLY CAUSE A POPULAR BACKLASH, BUT 
MAY NOT RESULT IN A CONVICTION.  ZULKEFLY SAID THE GOP 
WAS NOT CONFIDENT IT COULD SECURE A CONVICTION, AND 
WORRIED THAT MISUARI MAY ULTIMATELY \"SLIP AWAY.\" 
ZULKEFLY AGREED WITH THE VIEW THAT PERHAPS THE GOP 
HOPES A CONVICTION IN A MALAYSIAN COURT WOULD BE A 
SAFER AND MORE EFFECTIVE METHOD OF KEEPING MISUARI 
GROUP 
 
BEHIND BARS.
