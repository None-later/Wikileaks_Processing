QUIET AS STUDENTS AND THEIR MOVEMENT RETURN TO CAMPUSES 
 
REF:  SHENYANG 01251, AND PREVIOUS 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  LIFE IN THE NORTHEAST HAS BEEN DRIFTING 
BACK TO NORMAL.  THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PUBLIC STUDENT 
DEMONSTRATION SINCE MONDAY, MAY 29, WHEN SMALL BANDS OF 
SHENYANG AND CHANGCHUN STUDENTS STAGED FUNERAL MARCHES 
(WEARING WHITE HEADBANDS AND CARRYING WREATHS).  HARD 
CORE GROUPS OF MORE COMMITTED ACTIVISTS CONTINUE THE 
STRUGGLE AT SHENYANG\'S NORTHEAST UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY 
AND CHANGCHUN\'S JILIN UNIVERSITY.  THE MAJORITY OF THE 
STUDENTS ARE TURNING THEIR ATTENTION TO CLASSES WHILE 
WAITING FOR SIGNALS FROM BEIJING STUDENTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
STUDENTS KEEP FLAMES BURNING ON CAMPUSES 
---------------------------------------- 
 
3.  STUDENTS ARE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO CLASSES IN THE 
NORTHEAST.  OTHER THAN IN A FEW ISOLATED SCHOOLS -- 
WHERE STUDENT LEADERS CONTINUE TO LEAD CLASS BOYCOTTS -- 
CLASSROOMS ARE BEGINNING TO FILL UP WITH STUDENTS BACK 
FROM BEIJING, BACK FROM LOCAL DEMONSTRATIONS, OR BACK 
FROM HOME WHERE THEY SAT OUT THE MOVEMENT. 
 
4.  ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING POCKETS OF ACTIVITY IS 
SHENYANG\'S NORTHEAST UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (NEUT) 
WHERE THE INDEPENDENT STUDENT UNION WAS MAKING DEMANDS 
AS LATE AS YESTERDAY (JUNE 1) FOR ACCESS TO THE CAMPUS 
RADIO STATION, A PROMISE OF NO RETRIBUTION AGAINST 
STUDENT LEADERS OF THE MOVEMENT, THE DISMISSAL OF THE 
HEAD OF THE STUDENT UNION WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE 
DEMONSTRATORS, AND THE REMOVAL FROM THE PARTY OF THOSE 
STUDENT PARTY MEMBERS WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT. 
THE INDEPENDENT STUDENT UNION HAS ALSO CALLED FOR A 
CONTINUED BOYCOTT OF CLASSES UNTIL JUNE 20TH. 
 
5.  EVENING GATHERINGS OF NEARLY A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT 
CHANGCHUN\'S JILIN UNIVERSITY TO HEAR THE LATEST VOA AND 
BBC BROADCASTS AS TRANSLATED BY JILIN UNIVERSITY 
STUDENTS ALSO CONTINUE.  IN SPITE OF THIS SPARK THAT 
HAS NOT GONE OUT, THE UNIVERSITY HAS SEEN MORE AND MORE 
STUDENTS RETURNING TO THEIR STUDIES. 
 
BACK TO BOOKS, WAIT AND SEE 
--------------------------- 
 
6.  SHENYANG APPEARS QUIET, OTHER THAN THE ACTIVITY 
AT NEUT.  BY MONDAY MORNING (MAY 29), LEAFLETS AND POSTERS 
WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN IN TOWN OUTSIDE OF UNIVERSITY 
WALLS.  THE LUXUN ACADEMY OF ART -- WHICH WAS A MAJOR 
POINT OF INFORMATION DISSEMINATION TO THOUSANDS DAILY 
VIA POSTERS CHANGED EVERY FEW HOURS -- HAS NOT SEEN 
ANY ACTIVITY. 
 
7.  AMERICAN TEACHERS IN DALIAN REPORTED THAT THERE 
HAS NOT BEEN A DEMONSTRATION THERE SINCE MONDAY (MAY 
29).  THE CHIEF ISSUE AT DALIAN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY 
IS WHETHER SCHOOL WILL BE EXTENDED INTO AUGUST TO MAKE 
UP FOR THE TIME LOST DUE TO THE STUDENT MARCHES.  IN 
HARBIN (HEILONGJIANG), STUDENTS ARE SLOWLY RETURNING 
TO CLASS.  ATTEMPTS BY STUDENT LEADERS THERE TO CONTINUE 
CLASS BOYCOTTS HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. 
 
8.  COMMENT:  NORTHEAST STUDENTS -- WITH THE POSSIBLE 
EXCEPTION OF NEUT -- SEEM TO BE MARKING TIME, WAITING 
FOR A CUE FROM BEIJING STUDENTS.  FAILING THAT, SOME 
LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEETING OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE 
OF THE PEOPLE\'S CONGRESS SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 20TH. 
THE LIAONING UNIVERSITY STUDENT COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, 
HAS TOLD ITS STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS IN PREPARATION 
FOR \"THE NEXT STRUGGLE\" AND FOR THE MEAN TIME TO 
ANALYZE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN\'T.  END COMMENT.
