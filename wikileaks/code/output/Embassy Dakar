1.  CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT BY: 
AMBASSADOR, AMEMBASSY DAKAR.  REASON:  1.5 (B) 
 
2.  BEGIN SUMMARY:  A PROMINENT LAWYER FAMILIAR WITH 
THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE TIDIANE ISLAMIC 
BROTHERHOOD SAYS THAT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
JANUARY ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., 
THE RIVALRY TO SUCCEED THE AGING KHALIFE GENERAL HAS 
BECOME MORE PRECARIOUS.  THE POLICE INVESTIGATION 
INTO THE AFFAIR WILL PRODUCE NOTHING LINKING HIS 
CLIENT, CHEIKH TIDIANE SY, TO THE ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT, OUR CONTACT PREDICTS.  THE OPEN RIVALRY 
BETWEEN CHEIKH TIDIANE SY AND THE OTHER MAIN 
CONTENDER, ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., WILL REMAIN A SERIOUS 
THREAT TO PEACE WITHIN THIS INFLUENTIAL RELIGIOUS 
GROUP.  PRESIDENT DIOUF IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENT CONFRONTATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  DURING AN APRIL 3 LUNCHEON MEETING WITH DCM, 
MADICKE NIANG, A PROMINENT SENEGALESE LAWYER AND A 
PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE INNER WORKINGS OF SENEGAL\'S 
RELIGIOUS BROTHERHOODS, SAID THE STRUGGLE FOR 
SUCCESSION TO HEAD THE POWERFUL TIDIANE RELIGIOUS 
BROTHERHOOD (REF A) REMAINED TENSE AND THAT THE 
JANUARY ATTEMPT IN THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR. 
(REF. B) HAD ONLY EXACERBATED THE SITUATION.  NIANG 
DISMISSED ANOTHER OF THE KHALIFE GENERAL\'S NEPHEWS, 
MANSOUR SY, AS A SERIOUS CONTENDER, SAYING THE 
PRINCIPAL RIVALS TO HEAD THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD 
AFTER THE DEATH OF THE AGING AND FRAIL KHALIFE 
GENERAL WERE ABDUL AZIZ SY, JR., THE KHALIFE 
GENERAL\'S SPOKESMAN, AND HIS BROTHER CHEIKH TIDIANE 
SY, THE SPIRITUAL GUIDE OF THE BREAKAWAY 
MOUSTARCHIDINE FACTION.  NIANG SAID HE PROVIDED THE 
LATTER WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.  (NOTE:  MINISTER OF 
STATE ABDULAYE WADE AND THE KHALIFE GENERAL OF THE 
MOURIDE BROTHERHOOD ARE ALSO NIANG\'S CLIENTS.) 
 
4.  THE RIVALRY REPRESENTED A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE 
STABILITY OF THE COUNTRY, NIANG SAID, IN THAT THE 
CONTENDERS FOR POWER COULD EASILY LOOSE CONTROL OF 
THEIR MANY DEVOTED AND SOMETIMES OVERLY ZEALOUS 
FOLLOWERS.  INDEED, THE PERPETRATOR OF THE BOMBING 
ATTEMPT ON THE LIFE OF ABDUL AZIZ, JR. WAS A 
FANATICAL FOLLOWER OF CHEIKH TIDIANE SY AND WAS 
SOLELY RRESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENT, NIANG 
ASSERTED.  WHILE THE POLICE CONTINUED THEIR 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE AFFAIR, THE INTENDED VICTIM\'S 
ACCUSATION NOT WITHSTANDING, HE PREDICTED THAT THE 
POLICE WOULD TURN UP NO EVIDENCE OF A PLOT LINKING 
CHEIKH TIDIANE SY, OR ANYONE CLOSE TO HIM, TO THE 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.  HIS CLIENT WOULD NEVER 
ATTEMPT SO FOOLHARDY AN ADVENTURE SIMPLY BECAUSE HE 
WOULD BE THE MOST OBVIOUS SUSPECT.  FURTHER, CHEIKH 
TIDIANE SY FULLY REALIZED THE POTENTIAL FOR BLOODY 
CONFRONTATION WITHIN THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD WERE 
ONE OF ITS LEADERS TO BE KILLED.  NIANG ALSO POINTED 
TO CHEIKH TIDIANE SY\'S RESTRAINT IN NOT CALLING ON 
HIS FOLLOWERS FOR SUPPORT DURING THE RECENT MOVE TO 
EVICT HIM FROM A HOME HE HAD INHABITED (SEE DAKAR 
2017). 
 
5.  AT THE SAME TIME, NIANG WAS NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT 
IN THE LONG TERM THE RIVALS TO BE THE NEXT TIDIANE 
KHALIFE GENERAL WOULD BE ABLE TO SETTLE THEIR 
DIFFERENCES PEACEFULLY.  BEFORE THE ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CHANCE FOR THE 
BROTHERS TO SIT DOWN AND TALK.  NIANG SAID THAT 
BEFORE JANUARY HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN TRYING TO BRING 
THIS ABOUT.  NOW, HOWEVER, EMOTIONS WERE TOO 
UNSETTLED.  NIANG PROFFERED THAT THE KHALIFE GENERAL 
HAD ALSO UNDERCUT HIS OWN AUTHORITY BY FAVORING IN 
TOO PUBLIC A WAY ABDUL AZIZ, JR. AS HIS LIKELY 
SUCCESSOR.  THE KHALIFE GENERAL\'S ABILITY TO STEP IN 
AND SETTLE DIFFERENCES WAS NOW MUCH DIMINISHED AS A 
RESULT.  PRESUMABLY HIS MUCH WEAKENED PHYSICAL STATE 
ALSO SERVED TO LESSEN HIS AUTHORITY. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE JANUARY ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 
WILL QUIETLY BE PUT AWAY AND THAT THE CASE WILL 
NEVER COME BEFORE THE COURTS OUT OF CONCERN THAT A 
TRIAL AND THE ACCUSATIONS THAT WOULD BE AIRED WOULD 
BE TOO SERIOUS A THREAT TO THE PEACE.  PRESIDENT 
DIOUF, A MEMBER OF THE TIDIANE BROTHERHOOD, IS ALSO 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE SUCCESSION 
STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF HAND.  HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO 
DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE PEACE.

E.O. 12958: DECL: 09/06/11 
TAGS: PREL, PHUM, SG 
SUBJECT: PRESIDENT WADE SEIZES OPPORTUNITY TO 
DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM LIBYA 
 
REF:  DAKAR 2916 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL OFFICER CHRIS ROCHESTER. 
REASONS 1.5 (B)(D) 
 
1. (U) ON AUGUST 28, SENEGALESE AUTHORITIES REFUSED 
PERMISSION TO APPROXIMATELY 100 YOUNG WOMEN TO BOARD 
A LIBYAN CHARTERED AIRCRAFT, WHICH APPARENTLY LANDED 
WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION, AND WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY 
TAKING THE WOMEN TO LIBYA TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
CULTURAL EVENT CELEBRATING THE THIRTY-SECOND 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBYAN REVOLUTION.  WHAT BEGAN AS 
A SUSPECTED TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS MATTER QUICKLY 
INTENSIFIED TO A SIGNIFICANT DIPLOMATIC INCIDENT 
BETWEEN LIBYA AND SENEGAL. 
 
2. (U) SENEGALESE AUTHORITIES STRONGLY SUSPECTED THAT 
THE CULTURAL PRETEXT WAS IN FACT A BLATANT OPERATION 
IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING.  ON AUGUST 31, THE DAKAR 
PROSECUTOR FORMALLY CHARGED AND DETAINED THREE WOMEN, 
WHO WERE SUSPECTED OF COORDINATING THE SCHEME.  THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT DENIED ANY INVOLVMENT IN 
TRAFFICKING AND CLAIMED THAT IT HAD SENT THE AIRCRAFT 
TO DAKAR SOLELY TO BRING A SENEGALESE DANCE TROUPE 
(NUMBERING APPROXIMATELY THIRTY-FIVE MEMBERS) TO 
LIBYA. THE TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ALLEGATIONS ARE 
SERIOUS, BUT THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE 
MATTER HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF 
SENEGAL. 
 
3. (C) THE GOS REACTED PUBLICLY AND VIGOROUSLY.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER GADIO DEPLORED THE INCIDENT IN A ROUND OF 
MEDIA APPEARANCES AS \"AN UNFRIENDLY ACT.\"  THE 
PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMAN ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOS WAS 
TAKING A NUMBER OF STEPS IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT: 
THE GOS WAS RECALLING AMBASSADOR MAMADOU DIOUF FROM 
TRIPOLI FOR CONSULTATIONS; A DIPLOMATIC NOTE HAD BEEN 
CONVEYED TO LIBYAN AUTHORITIES; LIBYA WAS REQUIRED TO 
REDUCE ITS DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN SENEGAL; THE NUMBER 
OF TRANSIT VISAS FOR LIBYAN NATIONALS WOULD BE 
RESTRICTED.  FINALLY, PRESIDENT WADE SPOKE OUT ABOUT 
THE MATTER PUBLICLY, SAYING THAT THE INCIDENT WAS \"AN 
UNFRIENDLY GESTURE TOWARD SENEGAL.\"  HE ADDED THAT HE 
WAS HURT (\"BLESSE\") THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED AND THAT 
HIS FIRST DUTY WAS \"TO PROTECT THE SENEGALESE 
PEOPLE.\"  HE NOTED, WITHOUT ELABORATION, THAT THE 
INCIDENT \"WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT\" AND THAT THERE HAD 
BEEN \"PRECEDENTS\" FOR THIS KIND OF THING WITH LIBYA. 
ASKED IF HE WERE CONSIDERING FURTHER DIPLOMATIC 
SANCTIONS, PRESIDENT WADE REPLIED THAT HE WOULD MAKE 
FURTHER DECISIONS AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS RECALLED 
AMBASSADOR. 
 
4. (C) THE DETAILS OF THE ALLEGED HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
INCIDENT AND THE EVENTUAL JOURNEY - LONG OR 
ABBREVIATED - OF THE CASE THROUGH THE COURTS ARE OF 
INTEREST, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANT IS THE PROBABILITY 
THAT PRESIDENT WADE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE INCIDENT TO 
SEND A VIGOROUS PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE SENEGALESE 
PEOPLE, THE REGION AND THE WEST THAT HE INTENDED TO 
KEEP HIS DISTANCE FROM LIBYA.  WHEN ADDED TO OTHER 
RECENT, LESS PUBLIC, REMARKS TO US BY PRESIDENT WADE 
(REFTEL), THE IMPRESSION IS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
DECIDED TO ABRUPTLY DECELERATE WHAT HAD BEEN AN 
ACTIVE POLICY OF HIGH-LEVEL CONTACTS WITH LIBYA. 
 
5. (C) PRESIDENT WADE VISITED TRIPOLI SEVERAL TIMES SOON 
AFTER HIS ELECTION (NOT TO MENTION CONTACTS WHILE HE 
WAS IN THE OPPOSITION).  KHADAFI MADE A NUMBER OF 
PROMISES TO WADE, BOTH FINANCIAL AND PAN-AFRICAN 
(PARTICULARLY CONCERNING THE AFRICAN UNION), THAT 
CONFORMED TO HIS USUAL PATTERN OF INGRATIATION. 
PRESIDENT WADE APPEARED TO BE PERSUADED AT THE TIME 
THAT THE LIBYAN PROMISES (INCLUDING TO SUPPLY OIL AT 
DISCOUNT PRICES, TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF AN OIL REFINERY, TO MAKE OTHER LARGE 
BUT UNSPECIFIED INVESTMENTS IN SENEGAL AND WEST 
AFRICA AND TO SUPPORT REGIONAL AND PAN-AFRICAN 
POLITICAL PROJECTS), WERE SERIOUS.  THERE IS NOW A 
REAL DEGREE OF TENSION, EVEN BITTERNESS, BETWEEN 
SENEGAL AND LIBYA, GENERATED BY AN APPARENTLY SHARP 
REVERSAL OF SENEGALESE CONFIDENCE IN TRIPOLI. 
 
6. (C) FORMER FOREIGN MINISTER DJIBO KA MAY HAVE BEEN ON 
TARGET WHEN HE SAID IN A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT THIS 
CHILL IN BILATERAL RELATIONS WAS INEVITABLE, GIVEN 
THE EXCESSIVE ENTHUSIASM, EVEN \"AMATEURISM,\" OF 
SENEGALESE RELATIONS WITH LIBYA SINCE THE 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  KA ARGUED THAT IF SENEGAL 
WISHED TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY \"THE COUNTRIES AND 
INSTITUTIONS THAT COUNT IN THE WORLD,\" IT HAD TO STAY 
THE COURSE DIPLOMATICALLY AS A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY 
GIVING PRIORITY TO OTHER DEMOCRATIC NATIONS.
