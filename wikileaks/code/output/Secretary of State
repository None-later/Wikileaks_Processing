SUBJECT:     INTERNATIONAL LINKS OF LARF 
 
REF:  1. ROME 1902, 2. STATE 31565  3. STATE 014859 
 
 
1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT. 

2.  REFTEL 1 RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND LEBANESE TERRORIST 
GROUPS AS THEY MIGHT RELATE TO INVESTIGATON  OF 
LADISPOLI SEVEN. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION MIGHT BE 
USEFUL IN DISCUSSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT WITH ITALIAN 
MAGISTRATE. 
 
3.  AN ETA-LARF LINK.  ACCORDING TO ROME 1902 THERE IS 
REASON TO SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE RECENT BOMB ATTACKS ON 
TRAINS CLAIMED BY BASQUE FATHERLAND THE FREEDOM (ETA) 
HAVE, IN FACT, BEEN CARRIED OUT BY THE LEBANESE ARMED 
REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) ON BEHALF OF ETA. 

4.  WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE EVIDENCE UPON WHICH THIS IS 
BASED.  IN LATE 1984 THERE WERE THREE INCIDENTS IN WHICH 
ETA WAS SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT BOMBINGS ON RAILWAY 
STATIONS OR NEAR RAILWAY TRACKS, BUT NOT AGAINST A 
TRAIN.  TWO OF THESE WERE LOW-LEVEL EXPLOSIONS CAUSING NO 
CASUALTIES AND LITTLE DAMAGE.  THE THIRD WAS A 
BOOBY-TRAPPED DEVICE THAT KILLED SEVERAL CIVIL GUARDS, 
BUT WAS CONSISTENT WITH PAST ETA ACTIONS. 

5.  THE REFERENCE IN ROME 1902 MAY BE TO A FEBRUARY18, 
1984 EXPLOSION AT URRUGNE NEAR THE FRENCH-SPANISH BORDER 
THAT APPARENTLY WAS DESIGNED TO CAUSE A MID-COURSE 
COLLISION BETWEEN TWO TRAINS, ONE BOUND FOR MADRID, THE 
OTHER FOR PARIS.  THE EXPLOSION CAUSED NO INJURIES OR 
COLLISION, BUT ONLY A STROKE OF LUCK PREVENTED A MAJOR 
CATASTROPHE.  CLAIM FOR THE ATTACK, HOWEVER, WAS NOT MADE 
BY ETA BUT BY IPARRETARRAK (\"MEN OF THE NORTH\"), A FRENCH 
BASQUE GROUP FIGHTING FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF THREE 
BASQUE-POPULATED FRENCH PROVINCES.  ALTHOUGH THE TWO 
GROUPS ARE SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SIMILARITY OF 
THEIR AIMS COULD CAUSE CONFUSION.  IN THE PAST ETA HAS 
GENERALLY SHUNNED RELATIONS WITH IPARRETARRAK NOT WISHING 
TO OFFEND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT. 

6.  THE FEBRUARY 18 INCIDENT WAS A POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE 
VIOLENT ATTACK THAN USUAL IPARRETARRAK ACTIONS, AND IT 
REPORTEDLY ANGERED SEVERAL JAILED IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS. 
THE BOMBING, HOWEVER, APPARENTLY WAS THE WORK OF 
IPARRETARRAK MEMBERS WHO (CLAIMED) THAT THEY HAD WARNED 
FRENCH OFFICIALS ABOUT THE BOMB TEN MINUTES BEFORE IT 
WENT OFF AND DID NOT INTEND TO CAUSE A TRAIN COLLISION. 

7.  THE RED BRIGADES-LARF LINK.  AGAIN ACCORDING TO ROME 
1902 LARF AND THE ITALIAN RED BRIGADES (RB) HAVE BEEN 
PROVEN TO HAVE CONNECTIONS.  WE SUSPECT THAT THIS 
ASSERTION IS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF LEAMON HUNT\'S 
DRIVER WHO HAS IDENTIFIED MOHAMAD FAHS -- ONE OF THE ROME 
SEVEN -- AS HUNT\'S ASSASSIN.  GIVEN THAT BOTH LARF AND 
THE RB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR HUNT\'S DEATH, SOME 
ITALIAN OFFICIALS MAY BELIEVE THAT FAHS WAS CONNECTED 
WITH LARF AND PERHAPS \"CONTRACTED\" BY THE RB TO KILL HUNT 
-- HENCE A LARF-RB LINK.  ALTHOUGH IN NO POSITION TO 
DISPROVE THIS THEORY, WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO CONFIRM THIS 
LINK BASED UPON AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. 

8.  THE LARF  ISLAMIC JIHAD LINK.  WE CANNOT YET VERIFY 
THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN LARF AND ISLAMIC 
JIHAD.  THE TWO GROUPS APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED OF MEMBERS 
FROM SEPARATE ISLAMIC SECTS.  THEY ARE ACTIVE IN 
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND USE DIFFERENT MO\'S. 

9.  \"ISLAMIC JIHAD\" IS APPARENTLY THE OPERATIONAL 
COVERNAME USED BY ONE OR MORE PROIRANIAN RADICAL 
LEBANESE SHIITE ORGANIZATIONS.  THESE GROUPS, GENERALLY 
KNOWN UNDER THE RUBRIC HIZBALLAH (PARTY OF GOD) ARE 
OFFSHOOTS OF THE MODERATE AMAL ORGANIZATION LED BY NABIH 
BERRI.  SOME HIZBALLAH MEMBERS RETAIN TIES TO AMAL AND 
MAY EVEN KEEP UP MEMBERSHIP IN IT. 

10.  HIZBALLAH HAS PROBABLY BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL 
MAJOR ANTI-WESTERN TERRORIST ACTS IN LEBANON.  THE 
EARLIEST OF THESE, BEGINNING IN 1983, INVOLVED CAR BOMBS 
LOADED WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES SUCH AS HEXOGER.  LATER 
ATTACKS IN LEBANON CLAIMED BY ISLAMIC JIHAD ALSO INCLUDED 
SHOOTINGS AND KIDNAPPINGS.  ALTHOUGH ANONYNOUS CALLERS 
ALLEGED TO BE SPOKESMEN FOR \"ISLAMIC JIHAD\" HAVE CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKS OUTSIDE LEBANON (MURDER OF 
GENERAL OVERSSI, MINING OF RED SEA AND DECEMBER L983 
KUWAIT BOMBINGS) WE CANNOT SUBSTANTIATE THIS. 

11.  LARF, ACCORDING TO MOST REPORTING, IS COMPOSED OF 
LEFTIST/MARXIST LEBANESE AND/OR PALESTINIAN CHRISTIANS 
FORMERLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF PALESTINE.  LARF SEEMS TO OPERATE ON A 
SMALLER SCALE THAN ISLAMIC JIHAD. 

12.  INFORMATION ON MOHAMED FAHS.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION 
ON MOHAMAD FAHS THAT IS NOT ALREADY KNOWN TO THE ITALIANS. 

13.  THERE FOLLOWS A LIST OF LARF ACTIONS: 

NOVEMBER 1, 1981

SUBJECT:    THE IRANIAN SUCCESSION 
 
1.  (S  ENTIRE TEXT). 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, PREPARED BY INR/NESA IN 
FEBRUARY 1985, MAY BE OF BACKGROUND INTEREST TO ADDRESSEE 
POSTS. 
 
T H E  I R A N I A N  S U C C E S S I O N  A N D  I T S 
C O N S E Q U E N C E S 
 
3.  IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT PRECISELY HOW 
EVENTS WILL UNFOLD IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS FOLLOWING 
KHOMEINI\'S DEATH.  BUT THE CLERICAL GROUP NOW IN POWER IS 
SO ENTRENCHED THAT IT COULD DOMINATE FOR SOME YEARS.  AT 
BEST, THERE COULD BE A GRADUAL SOFTENING OF THE REGIME\'S 
VIEW OF THE US.  BUT INCREASING INSTABILITY AND SOVIET 
PRESSURE ARE MORE LIKELY TO KEEP THE US IN THE POSITION 
OF THE MAJOR ENEMY OF IRAN.  OVER THE LONGER RUN, WE 
THINK A SINGLE STRONG LEADER WILL EMERGE.  IF HE COMES 
FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD MILITIA, AS NOW APPEARS THE 
BEST BET, HE WILL SHARE MUCH OF THE OUTLOOK OF THE 
PRESENT LEADERSHIP.  THAT WOULD MAKE HIM DIFFICULT FOR 
THE US TO WORK WITH, THOUGH HE MIGHT NOT HAVE KHOMEINI\'S 
DEDICATION TO PURSUING THE WAR WITH IRAQ. 
 
4.  PROBABLE SUCCESSION SCENARIO:  MOST LIKELY IS A 
RELATIVELY SMOOTH INITIAL TRANSITION TO THE IMMEDIATE 
POST-KHOMEINI ERA.  THE CLERICS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE 
QUICKLY TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY AND CONTROL.  A COMMITTEE 
OF EXPERTS TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF SUCCESSOR HAS BEEN 
ELECTED AND MEETS SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR.  IT SEEMS 
INCLINED TO SETTLE ON AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI, A CHOICE WE 
BELIEVE WILL BE ENDORSED IN KHOMEINI\'S SEALED WILL. 
MONTAZERI WOULD NOT BY ANY MEANS HAVE UNQUESTIONED 
COMMAND.  INDEED, THE INITIAL IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE 
A COLLEGIAL AFFAIR BECAUSE NO SINGLE IRANIAN LEADER WILL 
BE ABLE TO REPLACE KHOMEINI. 
 
5.  THE MAIN IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE TO THIS SUCCESSION 
SCENARIO WOULD COME FROM THE JOCKEYING FOR POWER ALREADY 
APPARENT BETWEEN FACTIONS INSIDE THE PRESENT LEADERSHIP 
CADRE.  SHOULD  SUCH RIVALS AS PRESIDENT ALI KHAMENEI AND 
MAJLES LEADER ALI AKBAR RAFSANJANI CLASH, THAT WOULD 
INEVITABLY LEAD TO SERIOUS DISORDER. 
 
6.  A MAJOR DIFFICULTY WILL BE PRESENTED BY THE 
REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, THE PARAMILITARY ORGANIZATION WHICH 
HAS FUNCTIONED AS THE REGIME\'S PRAETORIAN GUARD.  EVEN 
KHOMEINI HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIT THE GUARD SMOOTHLY INTO 
THE CURRENT SOCIAL OR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE.  AND SHOULD 
THE GUARD THROW ITS CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT BEHIND ONE 
FIGURE, HIS PRIMACY WOULD BE GIVEN A STRONG BOOST. 
 
7.  THE LONGER TERM:  WHILE NON-CLERICAL ELEMENTS WILL 
HAVE A HARD TIME COMPETING IN THIS ARENA FOR A LONG TIME 
TO COME, THE CLERICS HAVE NOT INSTITUTIONALIZED CONTROL 
IN ANY DURABLE WAY.  THE INSTABILITY PROVOKED BY 
INFIGHTING AMONG VARIOUS CLERICAL FACTIONS IS LIKELY TO 
BE INCREASED BY ECONOMIC TROUBLES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL 
WEAKNESSES (E.G., CONTINUED MIGRATION TO THE CITIES). 
 
8.  WE THUS REGARD A POSTKHOMEINI CLERICAL REGIME AS 
ESSENTIALLY TRANSITIONAL.  THE CHANCES SEEM GOOD THAT IT 
WILL GIVE WAY SOONER OR LATER TO A SINGLE STRONG LEADER. 
ASSUMING THAT THERE WILL BE NO MAJOR OUTSIDE INTERVENTION 
TO DEFLECT THIS NATURAL COURSE OF EVENTS, THE TRANSITION 
MANEUVERING COULD BE LENGTHY.  THAT WOULD OPEN 
OPPORTUNITIES TO A BROADER RANGE OF PLAYERS. 
 
9.  IN THE END, HOWEVER, WE THINK THAT THE CHANCES FAVOR 
THE EMERGENCE OF A \"MAN ON HORSEBACK.\"  WE WOULD EXPECT 
HIM TO ACT IN THE NAME OF ISLAM AND CLAIM TO DEFEND THE 
FRUITS OF THE REVOLUTION.  AT PRESENT, THE MOST LIKELY 
INSTITUTION TO PRODUCE SUCH A FIGURE IS THE REVOLUTIONARY 
GUARD.  IF THE TRANSITION IS LONG ENOUGH, HOWEVER, 
SOMEONE COULD EMERGE FROM THE REGULAR MILITARY, DESPITE 
EFFORTS TO PREVENT ANY POPULAR HERO FROM USING THE WAR 
WITH IRAQ TO CATAPULT INTO PROMINENCE.  AS YET WE ARE 
UNABLE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. 
 
10.  POSSIBLE SOVIET ROLE:  ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS HAVE 
ASSETS AND CAN BRING SOME PRESSURE TO BEAR ON THE 
SUCCESSION SITUATION, WE DO NOT BELIEV THAT THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO EXERT A DETERMINING INFLUENCE OVER THE COURSE OF 
EVENTS.  THE TUDEH PARTY HAS BEEN CRIPPLED THROUGH 
ARRESTS AND EXECUTIONS, THOUGH ITS PRINCIPAL LEADERS ARE 
STILL ALIVE IN IRANIAN JAILS.  WHILE THE SOVIETS MAY BE 
ENCOURAGING THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW PARTY ORGANIZATION, 
THE PARTY HAS NEVER ENJOYED BROAD APPEAL.  SIMILARLY, 
SOVIET ASSETS AMONG THE MINORITIES WOULD FIND IT 
DIFFICULT TO INFLUENCE THE NATIONAL SCENE IN IRAN. 
 
11.  THE USSR CAN USE ITS CONTROL OVER LAND ROUTES TO 
IRAN, ABOUT 20 PERCENT OF WHICH PASS THROUGH SOVIET 
TERRITORY, TO EXERT PRESSURE.  AND IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
MANIPULATE ARMS SALES, IF BY THAT TIME THE SOVIETS HAD 
MANAGED TO ESTABLISH A MAJOR SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP.  BUT 
PRESSING IN THIS WAY WOULD BE RISKY AND THE SOVIETS 
PROBABLY WOULD NOT MAKE AN ALL-OUT PUSH IN THIS DIRECTION. 
 
12.  WE DO NOT EXPECT A SOVIET MILITARY INVASION OF 
IRAN.  A LIMITED STRIKE INTO THE BORDER PROVINCE OF 
AZERBAIJAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF IRAN WERE IN CHAOS AND 
APPEARED TO BE FRAGMENTING.  HOWEVER, THE SOVIETS WOULD 
PROBABLY ACT ONLY IF A US MILITARY RESPONSE APPEARED 
UNLIKELY.  ALTERNATIVELY, THEY MIGHT ATTEMPT TO OCCUPY 
AZERBAIJAN IF THEY BELIEVED THE US WERE PREPARING TO 
SEIZE PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN IRAN.  THE USSR MIGHT LAUNCH A 
PREEMPTIVE INVASION IF IT SUSPECTED US PREPARATIONS 
EITHER TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF PRO-AMERICAN ELEMENTS OR 
TO SECURE IRANIAN OIL FIELDS. 
 
13.  ALL THESE CONTINGENCIES APPEAR EXTREMELY DISTANT. 
THE SOVIETS WOULD HAVE TO ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WOULD FACE 
A US MILITARY RESPONSE AS WELL AS DIFFICULT LOGISTICAL 
AND TERRAIN PROBLEMS.  MOREOVER, THE SOVIET LEADERS 
PROBABLY PROJECT THAT IRANIAN RESISTANCE WOULD BE ON THE 
ORDER OF THEIR AFGHAN EXPERIENCE AND THAT MAJOR RESOURCES 
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PACIFY A COUNTRY AS LARGE AND 
POPULOUS AS IRAN. 
 
14.  OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE US?  THE US WILL PROBABLY HAVE 
LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN 
THE IMMEDIATE POST-KHOMEINI PERIOD.  LEADING POLITICAL 
FIGURES APPARENTLY STILL BELIEVE THAT THE US HAS NOT 
ACCEPTED THE REVOLUTION AND ITS RESULTS.  AS LONG AS WE 
APPEAR TO BE TILTING TOWARD IRAQ AND ARE ISRAEL\'S CLOSEST 
SUPPORTER, THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE THAT OPINION.  IN 
ADDITION, THE REGIME SEES ITSELF LOCKED IN A STRUGGLE 
WITH THE US FOR CONTROL OF THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD.  THUS THEY IDENTIFY THE US AS THE PRIMARY 
ENEMY TO BE DEFEATED IN THE EFFORT TO LIBERATE THE 
ISLAMIC WORLD FROM THE GRIP OF WESTERN CULTURAL VALUES. 
 
15.  THESE PERCEPTIONS PUT THE US IN A PARTICULARLY 
DIFFICULT POSITION AS IRAN MOVES INTO THE POST-KHOMEINI 
ERA.  ANY SUCCESSOR REGIME SEEMS DESTINED TO MAINTAIN 
ITSELF IN POWER IN THE NAME OF ISLAM AND THE REVOLUTION. 
THUS IT WILL HAVE A BUILT-IN ANTI-AMERICAN BIAS.  IRAN 
MIGHT GROW LESS HOSTILE TO THE US OVER TIME IF WE WERE 
NOT SEEN AS WORKING AGAINST THE REGIME IN TEHRAN, E.G., 
BY ENCOURAGING THE CUT-OFF OF ARMS TO IRAN.  BUT THIS 
WOULD BE A SLOW PROCESS AT BEST, AND IT COULD BE SET BACK 
BY EVENTS OVER WHICH WE WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL. 
 
16.  THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR:  KHOMEINI\'S DEATH WOULD REMOVE 
ONE OF THE STAUNCHEST ADVOCATES IN IRAN OF WAR TO THE 
BITTER END.  YET THE CLERICS ARE BY AND LARGE UNITED ON 
THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR, UNLESS IRAN CAN EMERGE WITH 
HONOR.  THAT WOULD INCLINE MOST OF THEM TO INSIST ON THE 
OUSTER OF IRAQI PRESIDENT SADAM HUSSEIN AS A PRECONDITION 
FOR ENDING HOSTILITIES. 
 
17.  NONETHELESS, THE SUCCESSOR REGIME, ONCE IT FELT MORE 
OR LESS SOLIDLY IN CONTROL AT HOME, MIGHT BECOME MORE 
FLEXIBLE IN ITS ATTITUDES TOWARD THE WAR.  TACTICS FOR 
FIGHTING AND TOWARD NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE AMONG SEVERAL 
ISSUES THAT WILL DIVIDE THE REGIME LOYALISTS.  OPPONENTS 
OF THE WAR ARE LIKELY TO BLAME ITS ADVOCATES FOR 
WEAKENING THE REGIME\'S BASE OF SUPPORT, FOR THE LARGE 
CASUALTIES, AND FOR DIVERSION OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES.  THE 
WAR\'S PROPONENTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, WILL CHARGE THAT ITS 
OPPONENTS LACK REVOLUTIONARY ISLAMIC FERVOR AND ARE NOT 
ADHERING TO KHOMEINI\'S WISHES. 
 
18.  ON BALANCE, THEREFORE, WE BELIVE THAT THE CHANCES OF 
ENDING THE WAR WILL RISE SOMEWHAT AFTER KHOMEINI 
DEPARTS.  BUT IRAN\'S WILLINGNESS TO MAKE PEACE IS BY NO 
MEANS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.

SUBJECT:     BACKGROUND BRIEFING ON TWA HIJACKING 
             MONDAY, JUNE 17, 1985, 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF BACKGROUND BRIEFING ON TWA 
HIJACKING ON JUNE 17 GIVEN BY ROBERT OAKLEY: 

BEGIN TEXT: 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIAL:  I\'M GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
VERY, VERY BRIEF BECAUSE WE HAVE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO, 
AND I\'VE GOT SOME OTHER MEETINGS TO GO TO.  AND, 
OBVIOUSLY, OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO DO EVERYTHING WE 
CAN TO GET THESE PEOPLE LOOSE, WHICH ALSO WILL HAVE 
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT HOW MUCH I CAN RESPOND TO YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 

LET ME OPEN BY REPEATING THE STATEMENT WHICH YOU ALL HAVE 
HEARD FREQUENTLY, INCLUDING FROM LARRY SPEAKES THIS 
MORNING: 

WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO TERRORISTS.  WE DO NOT ASK 
OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DO SO -- ISRAEL, KUWAIT, WHOEVER 
THEY MAY BE.  WE ARE CONTINUING OUR INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO 

SECURE THE RELEASE OF ALL THE PASSENGERS TAKEN HOSTAGE IN 
LAST FRIDAY\'S HIJACKING.  WE\'RE GRATEFUL TO THE 
GOVERNMENT OF ALGERIA FOR THEIR EXTENSIVE EFFORTS WHICH 
HAVE RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF 87 OF THE HOSTAGES. 

DISCUSSIONS WERE HELD YESTERDAY AND RESUMED THIS MORNING 
BETWEEN THE HIJACKERS AND LEBANESE JUSTICE MINISTER NABIH 
BERRI, WHO IS ALSO THE HEAD OF THE SHI\'A AMAL GROUP. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BUD MCFARLANE HAS BEEN IN 
TELEPHONE CONTACT WITH MINISTER BERRI.  OUR AMBASSADOR TO 
BEIRUT, REG BARTHOLOMEW, HAS ALSO BEEN IN FREQUENT TOUCH 
WITH MINISTER BARRI, AND OTHER RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS OF 
THE LEBANESE GOVERNMENT AND VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS THAT 
HAVE INFLUENCE. 
 
THE PURPOSE OF THESE CONTACTS IS TO OBTAIN THE IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE OF ALL THE REMAINING PRISONERS; THOSE WHO WERE 
TAKEN OFF THE PLANE EARLIER, THOSE WHO APPEAR TO HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN OFF THE PLANE LAST NIGHT, ALL THE REMAINING 
PRISONERS WHO HAVEN\'T ALREADY BEEN RELEASED WHO WERE ON 
THAT PLANE WHEN IT WAS HIJACKED. 

WE\'VE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH A VARIETY OF OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS AND PARTIES TO ENLIST THEIR ASSISTANCE IN 
SECURING THE SAFE RELEASE OF ALL THE HOSTAGES.  WE HOPE 
THIS TRAGIC SITUATION WILL BE RESOLVED AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE BY THE RELEASE OF THE HOSTAGES.  ITS 
CONTINUATION DOES NO ONE ANY GOOD.  THE INNOCENT VICTIMS 
OF THIS ACT OF TERRORISM ARE SUFFERING NEEDLESSLY AS ARE 
THEIR FAMILIES. 

THE HIJACKERS ARE NOT GETTING SYMPATHY FOR THEIR 
DEMANDS.  INDEED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HIJACKING, AND 
THE WAY IN WHICH THEY HAVE LINKED THE RELEASE OF THE 
FORMER ANSAR PRISONERS, MAY DELAY THE PREVIOUSLY PLANNED 
RELEASE OF THESE PRISONERS, AS STATED BY ISRAEL. 

WELL, THAT\'S MY STATEMENT.  I\'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO 
ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS. 

Q.  HOW MANY HOSTAGES ARE THERE NOW, INCLUDING THE CREW, 
AND DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE DO NOT KNOW PRECISELY 
WHERE THEY ARE.  I\'LL HAVE TO GET YOU THE PRECISE FIGURE 
ON THE NUMBER OF HOSTAGES. 

Q.  YOU\'VE MENTIONED ONE THING -- THE PRISONERS THAT WERE 
TAKEN OFF THE PLANE FRIDAY, AND THOSE, YOU SAID, APPEAR 
TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF TODAY. 
DO WE NOT KNOW FOR SURE THAT THEY ARE IN NABIH BERRI\'S -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE THINK THAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN OFF THE PLANE.  WE HAVE NO INDEPE DENT 
CONFIRMATION, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE.  THERE\'S BEEN 
NO ACTIVITY ON BOARD THE PLANE, AND WE THINK THEY\'RE 
OFF.  WE CAN\'T SAY FOR SURE THAT THEY\'RE ALL OFF.  I\'LL 
JUST SAY IT\'S A QUESTION OF NOT HAVING INDEPENDENT 
CONFIRMATION.  WE BELIEVE THEY\'RE OFF. 

Q.  WHAT DOES BERRI TELL YOU ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE THEY\'RE 
SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER HIS CONTROL, ARE THEY NOT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BARRY SAYS THEY\'RE UNDER 
HIS CONTROL. 

Q.  IF THEY ARE, HOW DOES THIS COMPLICATE THINGS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  EXCUSE ME? 

Q.  IF THEY ARE OFF THE PLANE, IF ALL THE PRISONERS OR 
ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE OFF THE PLANE, FROM OUR POINT OF 
VIEW, HOW DOES THIS COMPLICATE THINGS OR DOES IT 
COMPLICATE THINGS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE QUESTION IS NOT SO 
MUCH WHERE THEY ARE.  THE QUESTION IS, ARE THEY GOING TO 
BE RELEASED?  IF BERRI HAS CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THEM, THIS IS FINE.  IT\'S NICE TO SEE SOMEONE IN A 
POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY STEP FORWARD AND ACCEPT IT. 

OUR POSITION IS, THAT BEING THE CASE THE PRISONERS -- THE 
HOSTAGES SHOULD BE RELEASED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; NOT 
BEING HELD UP FOR SOME SORT OF NEGOTIATION, CONCESSIONS, 
TRADE OR HAGGLING. 

Q.  IS IT YOUR INFORMATION THAT BERRI KNEW ABOUT THIS 
OPERATION BEFORE IT STARTED, OR WAS HE PART OF THE 
PLANNING OF IT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THOSE OF WHO HAVE BEEN 
FOLLOWING THIS THING, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE 
BEEN OUT TO BEIRUT AT ONE TIME OR OTHER, KNOW JUST HOW 
DIFFICULT IT IS TO SAY WHO KNEW WHAT, WHEN, I JUST CAN\'T 
 
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. 

Q.  DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE ONES WHO WERE TAKEN OFF THE 
PLANE IN ITS SECOND STOP IN BEIRUT AND THOSE WHO APPEAR 
TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF LAST NIGHT ARE NOW TOGETHER?  DO 
YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION FROM BERRI THAT THEY\'VE BEEN 
REUNITED? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE DON\'T KNOW EXCEPT 
BERRI\'S STATEMENT, THAT HE IS ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ALL OF THEM.  WHETHER THEY\'RE ALL PHYSICALLY TOGETHER OR 
NOT, I COULDN\'T TELL YOU. 

Q.  WHAT ABOUT THE ONES THAT WERE THERE PREVIOUSLY, THE 
NINE OR - 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THERE\'S NO REASON TO 
BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE 
WHO WERE ON THE TWA FLIGHT.  SO FAR THE - THERE HAS BEEN 
NO MENTION OF THE DAWA PRISONERS IN KUWAIT IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE TWA FLIGHT. 

Q.  WHEN THE ISRAELIS TRANSFERRED THOSE DETAINEES, THE 
LEBANESE SHI\'ITES, TO ISRAEL, WE INFORMED THEM THAT THEY 
WERE IN VIOLATION, I THINK, OF INTERNATIONAL LAW -- I 
THINK THE FOURTH GENEVA PROTOCOL.  WHAT WOULD BE SO WRONG 
WITH JUST REMINDING THEM AGAIN THAT THEY ARE HOLDING 
THOSE DETAINEES IN VIOLATION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION HAS NOT 
CHANGED.  THAT THEY WERE TRANSFERRED FROM ISRAEL TO 
LEBANON.  IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE OPPOSED AS 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION.  BUT WE 
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY REASON TO LINK THESE TWO 
QUESTIONS.  INDEED, WE OPPOSE SUCH LINKAGE.  AND, AS I\'VE 
SAID, THE PRACTICAL EFFECT IS GOING TO BE, WE THINK, TO 
DELAY THE RELEASE WHICH THE ISRAELIS HAD PREVIOUSLY 
PLANNED. 

Q.  IF WE WON\'T ASK THE ISRAELIS TO LET THEM GO, AND THE 
ISRAELIS WON\'T LET THEM GO UNTIL WE ASK THEM TO DO IT, 
DON\'T THE HOSTAGES SUFFER IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE TRY 
AND WORK OUT A FACE-SAVING COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
POSITIONS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WELL, OUR POSITION, AS I 
SAID, IS QUITE CLEAR AND WE\'RE NOT CHANGING IT. 

Q.  TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE THE PEOPLE -- 

Q.  HAD WE KNOWN BEFORE THE HIJACKING THAT THE ISRAELIS 
PLANNED TO RELEASE THESE SHI\'ITE PRISONERS? 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE ISRAELIS HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT THEY INTENDED TO RELEASE THESE 
FORMER PRISONERS OF THE ANSAR CAMP OVER TIME, AS THE 
SECURITY SITUATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON IMPROVES. 

Q.  TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE ALL THE 
REMAINING HOSTAGES AMERICAN?  AMAL WAS SAYING THERE 
WERE FOUR GREEK CITIZENS WITH THEM.  DO YOU HAVE ANY 
IDEA ON THE NATIONALITY BREAKDOWN? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I\'LL HAVE TO GET THAT 
FOR YOU.  WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SOMEWHERE AND WE 
CAN GET IT. 

Q.  IN THE COURSE OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH BERRI, 
DOES HE SAY, DOES HE REPEAT THE DEMANDS OF THE 
HIJACKERS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WE\'RE NOT NEGOTIATING 
WITH BERRI.  I BELIEVE THAT HE HAS POINTED OUT THE 
DEMANDS OF THE HIJACKERS, AT LEAST; WHETHER HE HAS 
ENDORSED THEM OR NOT, I\'M NOT QUITE SURE.  BUT OUR 
POSITION ON THAT REMAINS VERY CLEAR. 

Q.  WELL IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU\'RE SAYING THAT IF 
BERRI HAS CONTROL OF THESE PEOPLE, THEN IT WOULD BE 
WITHIN HIS POWER TO RELEASE THEM, RIGHT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI - 

Q.  SO IF HE DOES NOT RELEASE THEM, HE IS MAKING 
DEMANDS UPON THE UNITED STATES, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. 
COULD YOU CITE WHAT THOSE DEMANDS ARE? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THE ONLY DEMANDS THAT 
HAVE BEEN MADE, SO FAR AS I KNOW, ARE FOR THE RELEASE 
OF THE FORMER ANSAR PRISONERS, AND OUR ANSWER IS VERY 
CLEAR, \"WE DON\'T GIVE IN TO TERRORIST DEMANDS.\" 
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, THERE WAS A 
TIMETABLE FOR THEIR RELEASE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THESE TWO 
THINGS HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER AND THEY SHOULDN\'T BE PUT 
TOGETHER.  THE PRISONERS SHOULD BE RELEASED AT ONCE. 

Q.  TO CLARIFY THAT, ARE YOU SAYING THAT BERRI 
SPECIFICALLY HAS ASKED FOR THE RELEASE OF THE 766 
HIMSELF? 
 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT I\'LL HAVE TO 
CHECK. 

Q.  HAVE YOU ASKED BERRI -- SINCE HE ASSUMES 
RESPONSIBILITY -- HAVE YOU ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY TO 
PLEASE GET THE PRISONERS RELEASED? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT WAS THE THRUST OF 
THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN MCFARLANE AND BERRI. 

Q.  AND WHAT DID BERRI REPLY TO THAT, SINCE HE SAYS HE 
HAS RESPONSIBILITY? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I CAN\'T GET INTO THE 
DETAILS OF THE CONVERSATION, BUT THAT INDEED OBVIOUSLY 
THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED. 

Q.  IS IT CLEAR TO YOU THROUGH TALKS WITH MR. BERRI 
THAT HE IS TALKING TO YOU IN HIS CAPACITY AS A LEADER 
OF AMAL, OR IN HIS CAPACITY AS A MEMBER OF THE LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  SO FAR AS I KNOW, HE 
HASN\'T MADE THE DISTINCTION.  FORTUNATELY, IN TERMS OF 
ACCEPTING SOME RESPONSIBILITY, HE HAS BOTH POSITIONS, 
SO HE IS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS 
A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY.  AND LET ME 
REMIND YOU, THE SHI\'A 
A COMMUNITY HAS SUFFERED ENORMOUSLY OVER MANY YEARS OF 
VIOLENCE AND CONFLICT AND DEPRIVATION. 

THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED 
POLITICAL RECONCILIATION AND REFORM AMONG THE LEBANESE 
COMMUNITIES, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ALL OF THEM WITH 
EQUITABLE POLITICAL DISTRIBUTION.  SO NABIH BERRI, AS A 
RESPONSIBLE  LEADER OF THE SHI\'A COMMUNITY, HAS OUR 
APPRECIATION.  NABIH BERRI, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ACCEPTED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE PRISONERS, HAS 
DONE SOMETHING WE CONSIDER TO BE POSITIVE.  BUT NOW WE 
CALL UPON HIM, AS WE HAVE, TO BRING ABOUT THEIR RELEASE. 

Q.  THE SITUATION, IN LIGHT OF YOUR ANSWERS IN THE LAST 
FEW QUESTIONS, SEEM TO HAVE CHANGED -- IT\'S NO LONGER A 
HIJACKING; IT IS A SITUATION IN WHICH A LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL IS CLAIMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
POSSESSION OR THE CARE-TAKING OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES. 
HAS THIS CHANGED THE SITUATION IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S 
VIEW?YOU\'RE NOW DEALING WITH ANOTHER GOVERNMENT THAT 
HAS CONTROL OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES.  IS THIS IN ANY WAY 
SIMILAR TO THE GOVERNMENT-TO\"GOVERNMENT SITUATION THAT 
OCCURRED IN IRAN? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THIS GETS BACK TO THE 
PREVIOUS QUESTION, WHICH I COULDN\'T ANSWER, IS THE WAY 
IN WHICH NABIH BERRI IS SPEAKING AS A LEADER OF THE 
SHI\'A COMMUNITY OR AS A MEMBER OF THE LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENT?  AND IT\'S A VERY INTERESTING SITUATION.  I 
CAN\'T SPEAK TO WHAT DEGREE HE\'S SPEAKING AS ONE; TO 
WHAT DEGREE HE\'S SPEAKING AS ANOTHER.  BUT YOU ALL 
UNDERSTAND THE VERY LIMITED CONTROL WHICH THE LEBANESE 
GOVERNMENT, AS AN INSTITUTION, HAS OVER WEST BEIRUT. 

Q.  DO YOU KNOW WHETHER BERRI ACTUALLY DOES HAVE 
CONTROL OVER THE HOSTAGES? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO. 

Q.  IN LIGHT OF THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE PAST 24 HOURS, 
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOURSELF AS \"MORE OPTIMISTIC\" OR 
\"LESS OPTIMISTIC\" ABOUT GETTING THESE HOSTAGES SAFELY 
RELEASED? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I WOULD DESCRIBE 
MYSELF AS NEITHER.  I HAVEN\'T BEEN MORE OR LESS.  AND 
ALL WE CAN DO IS WORK AT IT WITHOUT MAKING ANY VALUE 
JUDGMENTS UNTIL THEY\'RE RELEASED.  THEN -- 

Q.  THIS CHANGE MEANS NOTHING IN TERMS OF IT BEING MORE 
LIKELY THAT THESE PEOPLE WILL BE RELEASED SAFELY? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  ONE CAN DEDUCE A WHOLE 
HOST OF ARGUMENTS POINTING BOTH WAYS, PLUSES AND 
MINUSES, IF YOU WILL.  YOU MIGHT SAY THAT THEY ARE 
SAFER AT THE MOMENT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY MEANS THAT THEIR RELEASE IS MORE LIKELY. 

Q.  WHAT\'S THE DIFFERENCE IN PRINCIPLE BETWEEN THE 
ISRAELI RELEASE OF A BUNCH OF CONVICTED TERRORISTS AND 
GANGSTERS A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND THIS OPERATION? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S SOMETHING 
YOU\'LL HAVE TO ASK THE ISRAELIS, NOT ME. 

Q.  SIR, CAN I GO BACK TO MY QUESTION ABOUT MR. BERRI\'S 
CONTROL FOR A MOMENT? 
 
Q.  SIR, COULD YOU TELL ME IF THE UNITED STATES OPPOSES 
HAVING ISRAEL RELEASE THESE PRISONERS WHILE AMERICAN 
HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION, I THINK, 
IS VERY CLEAR.  WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS TO 
TERRORISTS.  WE DO NOT ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO 
DO SO.  THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT PREVIOUSLY HAD A PLAN 
FOR THE RELEASE OF THE TERRORIST -- NOT OF THE 
TERRORISTS, BUT OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE FORMER ANSAR 
CAMP. 

Q.  DOES -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  WHAT IT DOES, WE WILL 
SEE. 

Q.  DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE UNITED STATES DOES OPPOSE 
HAVING ISRAEL RELEASE THESE PRISONERS WHILE THE 
HOSTAGES ARE -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO.  I DIDN\'T SAY 
THAT.  I JUST REPEATED OUR POSITION. 

Q.  COULD YOU SAY IF THE UNITED STATES DOES OPPOSE IT, 
SIR? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION IS VERY 
CLEAR.  WE DO NOT MAKE CONCESSIONS WITH TERRORISTS.  WE 
DON\'T ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO DO SO. 

Q.  BUT IF THE ISRAELIS WERE INDEPENDENTLY TO DECIDE 
NOW TO RELEASE THOSE HOSTAGES, WOULD YOU OPPOSE THAT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  IF THEY WERE TO 
INDEPENDENTLY DECIDE TO DO SO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR 
PLAN PREVIOUSLY, IT WOULD PRODUCE PERHAPS A DIFFERENT 
SITUATION, IF IT WERE NOT LINKED TO THE QUESTION OF THE 
TERRORISTS.  BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THE HIJACKERS SHOULD 
DROP THEIR DEMANDS FOR -- WHICH INCLUDE THE LINKAGE 
HERE. 

Q.  HAVE WE TOLD BERRI THAT THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THE 
HOSTAGE SITUATION IS TO DELAY THE RETURN OF THE 
PRISONERS IN ISRAEL?  DID WE ACTUALLY TELL HIM THAT? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  IF YOU LISTENED TO THE 
(SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL) BACKGROUNDER THIS 
MORNING, HE TALKS ABOUT THAT.  HE SAYS THAT IF THE 
HOSTAGE SITUATION WERE TO BE CLEARED UP, IT MIGHT BE 
POSSIBLE FOR THE ISRAELIS TO PROCEED ON THEIR 
PREVIOUSLY PLANNED RELEASE OF THE LEBANESE PRISONERS. 

Q.  BUT DID WE TELL BERRI THIS? 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  (SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIAL) WAS TALKING ABOUT MCFARLANE\'S CONVERSATION 
WITH BERRI. 

Q.  YOU, A FEW MINUTES AGO, TALKED ABOUT THE PLUSES AND 
MINUSES OF THE NEW SITUATION.  DOESN\'T THE FACT THAT 
THEY\'RE OFF THE PLANE AND SOME PLACE THAT WE DON\'T KNOW 
WHERE THEY ARE, MEAN THAT THEY COULD BE SUSTAINED FOR A 
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, SEPARATED PERHAPS -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MY COMMENT, I SAID IN 
SOME WAYS THEY MAY BE SAFER, IN OTHER WAYS IT DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEIR RELEASE IS MORE IMMINENT. 
BUT YOU COULD TURN IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND AND SAY THAT 
NABIH BERRI AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER OF THE SHI\'A 
COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A MINISTER HAS ACCEPTED 
RESPONSIBILITY.  THEREFORE, IF HE IS WILLING TO 
EXERCISE THAT RESPONSIBILITY, THIS COULD LEAD TO THEIR 
EARLY RELEASE RATHER THAN DEALING WITH A BUNCH OF 
HIJACKERS WHO HAVE NO SUCH PERSON IN A POSITION OF 
RESPONSIBILITY.  THAT\'S WHY I SAID YOU GOT PLUSES AND 
MINUSES. 

Q.  FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A COUNTER-TERRORIST 
OFFICIAL -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I DON\'T WANT TO GET IN 
ANY SORT OF VALUE JUDGMENTS. 

Q.  WELL, WHAT IS EFFECTIVELY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
BERRI HOLDING AMERICAN PASSENGERS AS HOSTAGES TO 
CERTAIN POLITICAL DEMANDS AND THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS 
HOLDING THE AMERICAN PASSENGERS HOSTAGE -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  OUR POSITION -- 

Q.  -- TO THE SAME DEMAND? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MARVIN, OUR POSITION 
IS EXACTLY THE SAME.  WE WANT THEM RELEASED AT ONCE, NO 
CONDITIONS ASKED. 

Q.  YOU ARE AT THE SAME TIME REFERRING TO BERRI AS A 
RESPONSIBLE SHI\'ITE LEADER. 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  YES. 

 
Q.  HOW RESPONSIBLE IS HE IF HE IS IN FACT, IN EFFECT, 
 PERFORMING THE SAME FUNCTION AS THE ORIGINAL HIJACKERS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  MARVIN, THAT\'S WHY WE 
HAVE SAID, IN OUR VIEW RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT MERELY TO 
KEEP THEM SAFE BUT TO RELEASE THEM AT ONCE. 
Q.  AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THE \"- 

Q.  THEN DOES THE PRESIDENT\'S THREAT TO FREE THE 
HOSTAGES FOR THE UNSAFETY OF THOSE HOLDING THEM STILL 
HOLD? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S A SUBJECT THAT 
I REALLY CAN\'T COMMENT ON, GIVEN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE 
SITUATION WE\'RE IN. 

Q.  HAVE YOU MADE CLEAR TO MR. BERRI THAT WE WANT ALL 
OF THE HOSTAGES RELEASED, AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WITHOUT 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN OFFICIALS, NON-OFFICIALS, MILITARY, 
NON-MILITARY, JEW, NON-JEW? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  YES. 

Q.  AND SO THAT INCLUDES THE SIX OR EIGHT THAT WERE 
TAKEN OFF THE PLANE - 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  INDEED. 

Q.  - FRIDAY NIGHT.  IT DOES NOT - 

Q.  MR. -- 

Q.  BUT JUST TO UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY, IT DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY INCLUDE THE SEVEN AMERICANS WHO ARE -- 
STILL REMAIN HOSTAGE IN SOME OTHER PART OF LEBANON? 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI HAS CLAIMED NO 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM.  WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH 
BERRI, WITH ALL OF THE RESPONSIBLE OR INFLUENTIAL, IF 
YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY, LEADERS IN LEBANON ON THE 
SUBJECT OF THE OTHER HOSTAGES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME.  BUT THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THIS, ALTHOUGH HE IS 
ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE\'VE TALKED TO ABOUT THIS ABOUT 
THE OTHER PROBLEM. 

Q.  WHAT ROLE SYRIA PLAYS SINCE THEY ARE KNOWN FOR 
THEIR GOOD RELATIONS WITH NABIH BERRI? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I DON\'T WANT TO 
COMMENT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYRIA AND NABIH 
BERRI -- 

Q.  HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO -- 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  -- EXCEPT THAT WE 
THINK, REFERRING TO PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S STATEMENT, PUBLIC 
STATEMENT OF LAST WEEK, HE HAS TALKED ABOUT HIS VIEWS 
ON THE HOSTAGES, ON THE WHOLE IDEA OF HOSTAGE-TAKING 
AND KIDNAPPING AND TERRORISM, WHERE HE SAYS HE OPPOSES 
IT. 

MR. DJEREJIAN:  WE\'RE GOING TO TAKE TWO MORE QUESTIONS. 

Q.  HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO PRECISELY DEFINE THE 
AFFILIATION OF THE HIJACKERS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  NO. 
 
Q.  JUST A MINOR CLARIFICATION:  DOES THE UNITED STATES 
HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT BERRI HAS INFLUENCE OVER 
THE SIX TO TEN PEOPLE THAT WERE INITIALLY REMOVED OFF 
THE PLANE? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  BERRI HAS CLAIMED 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF THEM.  THEREFORE, WE DO 
BELIEVE THAT BERRI HAS INFLUENCE.  CONTROL, INFLUENCE. 
THE DEGREE OF CONTROL, THE DEGREE OF INFLUENCE, IS 
SOMETHING THAT\'S VERY HARD TO SAY. 

Q.  HOW MUCH BERRI HAS INFLUENCE ON THE HIJACKERS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  EXCUSE ME? 

Q.  HOW MUCH BERRI HAS INFLUENCE ON THE HIJACKERS? 

SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  THAT\'S WHAT I SAID. 
HOW MUCH IS HARD TO TELL.

SUBJECT:     IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
 
1.  SECRET    ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING SIRO ANALYSIS OF IRANIAN SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM IS BEING SENT AS A PART OF A PACKAGE OF 
INTELLIGENCE TO REINFORCE THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S 
PRESENTATION ON TERRORISM DURING HIS TALKS WITH HOST 
COUNTRIES.  OTHER ANALYSES DEAL WITH LIBYA AND BEIRUT AND 
WILL BE TRANSMITTED SEPTEL.  ADDRESSEE MISSIONS AND SIRO 
SHOULD COORDINATE BEST MEANS TO COMMUNICATE CONTENTS OF 
THESE STUDIES TO RESPONSIBLE, INTERESTED AGENCIES OF HOST 
GOVERNMENTS AT APPROPRIATELY HIGH LEVEL.  REACTIONS 
SHOULD BE REPORTED IN TERREP EXCLUSIVE CHANNELS AS WELL 
AS OTHERS. 
 
3.  QUOTE: UPDATE ON IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM: 23 JUNE 
1985.  IRANIAN-BACKED TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE BEEN 
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST 30 ATTACKS SINCE SEPTEMBER 1984. 
IRAQ, FRANCE, AND THE UNITED STATES CONTINUE TO BE THE 
PRIMARY TARGETS.  WHILE MOST OF THE RECENT INCIDENTS 
ATTRIBUTABLE TO IRANIAN-BACKED GROUPS HAVE OCCURRED IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST, THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT 
IRANIAN OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY IS CONTINUING IN OTHER PARTS 
OF THE WORLD. 
 
.  IRAQ HAS SUFFERED SEVEN OR EIGHT TERRORIST ATTACKS AT 
THE HANDS OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED GROUPS, INCLUDING THE 
ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF FOUR IRAQI DIPLOMATS\' CARS IN ATHENS 
LAST DECEMBER.  A GREEK BOMB DISPOSAL EXPERT WAS KILLED 
IN ONE OF THESE INCIDENTS. 
 
.  THERE WERE ALSO THREE OR FOUR ATTACKS INSIDE IRAQ, 
INCLUDING TWO BOMBINGS IN PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN\'S 
HOMETOWN OF TIKRIT. 
 
.  IRAN TRAINS AND FINANCES SEVERAL IRAQI DISSIDENT 
GROUPS, SUCH AS THE ISLAMIC ACTION ORGANIZATION THAT 
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE BOMBINGS IN ATHENS, THAT ARE 
DEDICATED TO OVERTHROWING IRAQI PRESIDENT SADDAM HUSAYN. 
IF IRAN SUFFERS FURTHER SETBACKS IN ITS WAR WITH IRAQ, 
TEHRAN MAY ACCELERATE ITS EFFORT TO HIT IRAQI TARGETS 
WHEREVER THEY ARE VULNERABLE. 
 
4.  THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE HAVE BEEN THE MAIN FOCUS 
OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN LEBANON.  OVER 
THE PAST 10 MONTHS, THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT 
PRO-IRANIAN SHI\'AS IN LEBANON HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 
AT LEAST 19 INCIDENTS, INCLUDING EIGHT ATTACKS AGAINST US 
AND SIX AGAINST FRENCH TARGETS: 
 
.  THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO REMOVE ANY REASONABLE 
DOUBTS OF IRANIAN COLLUSION WITH LEBANESE SHI\'A 
TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE BOMB ATTACKS ON THE US 
MARINE BARRACKS, THE AMERICAN EMBASSY AND THE FRENCH 
MILITARY HEADQUARTERS IN BEIRUT IN L983.  THE PRINCIPAL 
POINTS OF CONTACT BETWEEN THE TERRORISTS AND IRAN ARE THE 
SHAYKH ABDALLAH BARRACKS IN THE BAQA\' VALLEY, CONTROLLED 
BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD, AND THE IRANIAN 
EMBASSY IN DAMASCUS, PARTICULARLY AMBASSADOR MUTASHAMIPUR. 
 
.  ISLAMIC JIHAD CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR KIDNAPPING 
FOUR PRIVATE US CITIZENS, AND PRO-IRANIAN SHIAS ALMOST 
CERTAINLY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABDUCTING ANOTHER AMERICAN 
ON 9 JUNE.  HIZBALLAH ELEMENTS NOW HOLD SEVEN AMERICANS 
SOMEWHERE IN LEBANON. 
 
.  RADICAL SHIA TERRORISTS PROBABLY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE MURDER OF THREE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH OBSERVER FORCE 
IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY, THE KIDNAPPING OF THREE FRENCH 
DIPLOMATS IN MARCH--TWO OF WHOM ARE STILL BEING HELD BY 
THE SO-CALLED ISLAMIC JIHAD (HIZBALLAH), TOGETHER WITH 
THE SEVEN AMERICANS--AND THE ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING OF A 
FRENCH JOURNALIST IN APRIL.  ISLAMIC JIHAD PUBLICLY 
CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THREE OF THESE INCIDENTS. 
 
.  RADICAL SHIAS MAY HAVE KIDNAPPED TWO BRITISH CITIZENS 
IN WEST BEIRUT ON 14 AND 15 MARCH.  THE TWO WERE 
SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED, PERHAPS BECAUSE THEIR CAPTORS 
REALIZED THEY WERE NOT AMERICAN.  A BRITISH PROFESSOR AT 
THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN BEIRUT WAS KIDNAPPED IN MAY, 
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS MISTAKEN FOR AN AMERICAN.  HE WAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY FOUND DEAD. 
 
.  THE RADICAL SHIA GROUPS IN LEBANON--FUNDED, SUPPLIED, 
AND TRAINED BY IRAN--ARE DEDICATED TO BRINGING ABOUT AN 
ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN LEBANON.  THEY CONSIDER THE 
ELIMINATION OF ANY WESTERN, PARTICULARLY AMERICAN, 
PRESENCE IN LEBANON (SUCH AS THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF 
BEIRUT AND CHRISTIAN RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS 
PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONARIES--AND THE CATHOLIC RELIEF 
SERVICE) TO BE BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING THEIR 
GOAL.  IN ADDITION, IRAN HAS ENCOURAGED ATTACKS AGAINST 
FRENCH TARGETS BECAUSE OF FRANCE\'S SUPPORT FOR IRAQ. 
 
PRO-IRANIAN TERRORISTS CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN WESTERN 
EUROPE, ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO ATTACKS OTHER THAN 
THE FOUR BOMBINGS IN ATHENS SINCE SEPTEMBER.  EVIDENCE 
INDICATES IRAN USES ITS NETWORK OF DIPLOMATIC AND 
CULTURAL MISSIONS TO SUPPORT THESE TERRORIST OPERATIONS. 
 
.  LAST NOVEMBER, SEVEN PRO-IRANIAN LEBANESE SHIA WERE 
ARRESTED IN LADISPOLI, ITALY FOR PLANNING A CAR BOMB 
ATTACK AGAINST THE US EMBASSY IN ROME. 
 
.  IN FEBRUARY, TWO IRANIANS WERE CONVICTED IN SPAIN FOR 
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN A PLOT TO HIJACK A SAUDI AIRLINER. 
 
.  IN MARCH, SEVERAL IRANIANS WERE EXPELLED FROM FRANCE 
FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES. 
 
.  FRAGMENTARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS IRAN CONTINUES TO TRACK 
ANTI-KHOMEINI EXILES IN EUROPE.  ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS 
COULD OCCUR AT ANY TIME. 
 
.  THE TWO HIJACKERS OF TWA FLIGHT 847 THAT LEFT ATHENS 
ON 14 JUNE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF HIZBALLAH, BUT 
THEIR COMMUNIQUES CLEARLY INDICATED THE INFLUENCE OF 
IRANIAN PROPAGANDA.  HIZBALLAH ELEMENTS IN LEBANON 
SUBSEQUENTLY TOOK CONTROL OF THE HIJACKING, HOWEVER, AND 
NOW HOLD INDEPENDENTLY OF AMAL SOME OF THE REMAINING 
AMERICAN PASSENGERS.  THE HIZBALLAH MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO 
BLOCK ANY DECISION BY AMAL TO RELEASE THE AMERICAN 
PASSENGERS UNDER THE LATTER\'S CONTROL. 
 
THE HIJACKING OF TWA 847 AND THE FATE OF ITS PASSENGERS 
HAS BECOME ENMESHED IN AN INTERNAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN 
HIZBALLAH AND AMAL FOR DOMINANT INFLUENCE AMONG THE SHIA 
COMMUNITY.  HIZBALLAH IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH TEHRAN ON 
THIS QUESTION.  THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF THIS 
STRUGGLE FOR TEHRAN, SYRIA, ISRAEL AND THE ENTIRE MIDDLE 
EAST ARE OBVIOUS, AND COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. 
 
IRAN CONTINUES TO TRAIN AND PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORT TO 
DISSIDENTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF, ASIA AND AFRICA. 
TERRORIST ATTACKS COULD BE ENCOURAGED BY IRAN AT ANY TIME. 
 
.  SHIA DISSIDENTS FROM SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, AND BAHRAIN 
ARE RECEIVING MILITARY TRAINING IN IRAN AND SOME HAVE 
RETURNED HOME TO UNDERTAKE SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY.  RECENT 
SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN BAHRAIN, TWO BOMBINGS CLAIMED BY 
ISLAMIC JIHAD IN SAUDI ARABIA IN MAY, AND THE SUICIDE CAR 
BOMB ATTACK ON THE AMIR OF KUWAIT INDICATE AN INCREASING 
THREAT FROM IRANIAN-TRAINED TERRORISTS AGAINST MODERATE 
ARAB REGIMES.  THIS THREAT COULD IMPACT DIRECTLY UPON THE 
VITAL INTERESTS OF WESTERN EUROPE, SUCH AS ACCESS TO OIL 
AND PEACE PROCESS. 
 
.  IRAN IS INVOLVED IN AGITATION AND PROPAGANDA ACTIVITY 
AMONG MUSLIM POPULATIONS IN COUNTRIES AS DIVERSE AS 
NIGERIA, PAKISTAN, INDONESIA, AND THE PHILIPPINES. 
 
MANY ELEMENTS OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING 
SEVERAL SENIOR OFFICIALS, ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  FOR EXAMPLE, DIRECT LINKS BETWEEN 
TEHRAN AND TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD ARE MAINTAINED 
THROUGH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY AND THE PASDARAN 
(REVOLUTIONARY GUARD).  SO LONG AS THE CHARACTER OF THE 
CURRENT REGIME REMAINS THE SAME, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT 
IRAN\'S POLICY OF SPONSORING TERRORISM WILL CHANGE.  WE 
ARE THEREFORE FACING A LONGTERM PROBLEM OF HOW TO 
MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF IRANIAN TERRORIST POLICIES, 
PERSUADE IRAN TO ABANDON THEM, PROTECT MODERATE ARAB 
REGIMES AND PREVENT TERRORISM FROM SPILLING OVER INTO 
WESTERN EUROPE.  THERE ARE THREE AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR 
WESTERN ACTION: 
 
.  FIND WAYS TO MAKE TEHRAN PAY A PRICE FOR ITS CONTINUED 
SUPPORT OF TERRORISM; 
 
.  STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY AND WILL OF OTHER STATES TO 
RESIST IRANIAN TERRORISM; 
 
.  TRY TO ENCOURAGE SYRIA, AFTER THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL 
FROM LEBANON, TO EXERT ITSELF MORE FORCEFULLY IN 
CURTAILING IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM BASED IN LEBANON. 
 
UNLESS RAPID DECISIVE COLLECTIVE ACTION CAN BE TAKEN SO 
AS TO STEM THE GROWING RADICAL SHIA CANCER, STRONGLY 
INFLUENCED AND DIRECTED FROM TEHRAN, IT IS LIKELY THAT 
THERE WILL BE A STILL MORE RAPID SPREAD OF RADICALISM 
INTO OTHER ARAB COUNTRIES, TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASED 
SPILLOVER INTO WESTERN EUROPE AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

SUBJECT:    STATUS OF MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND VESSELS 
 
REF:  STATE 106685 (110517Z MAY 77) 
 
1.  REFERENCE (A) SUMMARIZED U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICY AND 
PRACTICE REGARDING SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY STATUS OF VESSELS 
EMPLOYED BY THE U.S. NAVY\'S MILITARY SEALIFT COMMAND 
(MSC).  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
DEFENSE STRATEGIC SEALIFT PROGRAM NECESSITATE A 
REVISION OF THE POLICIES PROMULGATED IN REFERENCE (A), 
WHICH IS HEREBY CANCELLED. 
 
2.  THE VESSELS OPERATED BY THE MSC ARE THOSE OWNED BY 
THE USG, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE NATIONAL DEFENSE 
RESERVE FLEET; THOSE BAREBOAT CHARTERED TO THE USG; AND 
THOSE TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED TO THE USG.  SHIPS 
DESIGNATED UNITED STATES NAVAL SHIPS (USNS) ARE EITHER 
OWNED BY OR BAREBOAT CHARTERED TO THE US NAVY.  MSC 
BAREBOAT CHARTERED VESSELS ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND ARE 
MANNED EITHER BY U.S. GOVERNMENT CIVIL SERVICE CREWS OR 
BY CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES.  THE PHYSICAL APPEARANCE OF 
BAREBOAT CHARTERED SHIPS, EITHER BY PAINTING OR BY 
STACK MARKINGS, IS USUALLY THE SAME AS U.S. GOVERNMENT 
OWNED USNS.  PRIVATELY OWNED AND OPERATED VESSELS 
CHARTERED BY MSC FOR A PERIOD OF TIME OR FOR A 
SPECIFIED VOYAGE OR VOYAGES ARE USUALLY MANNED BY 
CIVILIAN PRIVATE SECTOR CREWS EMPLOYED BY A COMMERCIAL 
OPERATOR, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
USED EXCLUSIVELY TO TRANSPORT U.S. GOVERNMENT 
NON-COMMERCIAL CARGO.  THEY DO NOT, HOWEVER, BEAR 
DISTINCTIVE U.S. GOVERNMENT MARKINGS. 
 
3.  UNDER CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW, ALL VESSELS 
OWNED OR OPERATED BY A STATE AND USED ON GOVERNMENT 
NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICE ARE ENTITLED TO SOVEREIGN 
IMMUNITY.  THIS MEANS SUCH VESSELS ARE, INTER ALIA, 
IMMUNE FROM ARREST AND SEARCH, WHETHER IN FOREIGN 
INTERNAL OR TERRITORIAL WATERS OR ON THE HIGH SEAS; 
IMMUNE FROM ALL FOREIGN TAXATION; EXEMPT FROM ANY 
FOREIGN STATE REGULATION REQUIRING FLYING THE FLAG OF 
SUCH FOREIGN STATE EITHER IN ITS PORTS OR WHILE PASSING 
THROUGH ITS TERRITORIAL SEA; AND ENTITLED TO EXCLUSIVE 
CONTROL OVER PERSONS ON BOARD SUCH VESSELS WITH RESPECT 
TO ACTS PERFORMED ON BOARD .  THESE SHIPS, HOWEVER, ARE 
EXPECTED TO COMPLY VOLUNTARILY WITH THE LAWS OF THE 
HOST STATE WITH REGARD TO ORDER IN THE PORTS, CASTING 
ANCHOR, SANITATION AND QUARANTINE, ETC.  ALL VESSELS IN 
THE SERVICE OF MSC, WHETHER USG OWNED, BAREBOAT 
CHARTERED, TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED, ARE IN EXCLUSIVE 
GOVERNMENT NON-COMMERCIAL SERVICE.  EACH OF THESE 
VESSELS IS ENTITLED TO FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY. 
 
4.  IN THE PAST, FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY HAS BEEN 
CLAIMED (AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN ACCORDED) FOR USNS 
VESSELS ONLY.  AS A MATTER OF POLICY THE USG DID NOT 
CLAIM FULL SOVEREIGN IMMUNE STATUS FOR TIME AND VOYAGE 
CHARTERED VESSELS ALTHOUGH AS A JURIDICAL MATTER OUR 
POSITION HAS BEEN THAT SUCH VESSELS ARE ENTITLED TO 
FULL IMMUNITY.  THIS WAS DONE PRINCIPALLY TO AVOID 
NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE AND TO AVOID 
CONFUSION BY FOREIGN STATES WHEN THOSE VESSELS ENTERED 
THEIR PORTS.  WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, IMMUNITIES CLAIMED 
FOR SUCH VESSELS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO FREEDOM FROM 
ARREST AND IMMUNITY FROM TAXATION, AND HAVE BEEN 
ARRANGED ON A BILATERAL BASIS. 
 
5.  FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, MSC HAS BEEN BRINGING ON 
LINE THE AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE (APF), MOST OF 
WHICH IS TIME CHARTERED.  IN THE CASE OF THE APF, THE 
POLICY NOTED ABOVE IS NOT SATISFACTORY.  APF VESSELS 
ARE LOADED ENTIRELY WITH COMBAT EQUIPMENT, FUEL AND 
COMBAT SUPPORT SUPPLIES.  THE CONTENTS OF THEIR CARGO 
IS THEREFORE SENSITIVE AND CANNOT BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR 
INSPECTION BY FOREIGN AUTHORITIES.  APF SHIPS ARE 
EXPECTED TO CALL ONLY AT A LIMITED NUMBER OF PORTS AND 
NOT TO MAKE PORT CALLS AS FREQUENTLY AS, E.G., TANKERS 
OR GENERAL PURPOSE DRY CARGO CARRIERS.  IN VIEW OF THE 
UNIQUE NATURE OF THE AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE, IT IS 
THE POLICY OF THE USG THAT ALL AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING 
FORCE VESSELS, INCLUDING TIME CHARTERED VESSELS, MUST 
BE AFFORDED THE FULL SOVEREIGN PRIVILEGES AND 
IMMUNITIES CURRENTLY CLAIMED FOR AND ACCORDED USNS 
VESSELS.  WITH RESPECT TO MSC VOYAGE CHARTERED VESSELS 
AND MSC TIME CHARTERED VESSELS NOT A PART OF THE AFLOAT 
PREPOSITIONING FORCE, USG GENERAL POLICY IS TO CONTINUE 
TO CLAIM IMMUNITY ONLY FROM ARREST AND TAXATION. 
CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ARISE WHICH NECESSITATE ASSERTIONS OF 
SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY FOR TIME OR VOYAGE CHARTERED VESSELS 
IN ADDITION TO THOSE IN THE APF.  WHEN SUCH CASES HAVE 
ARISEN IN THE PAST, SPECIFIC GUIDANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED 
AT THE TIME.  THIS PROCEDURE WILL CONTINUE. 
 
6.  REQUEST ALL POSTS TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO INSURE 
HOST GOVERNMENTS ARE AWARE, WHEN APPROPRIATE, OF THE 
STATUS OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNE VESSELS AND ASSIST IN 
ASSURING RECOGNITION OF THIS STATUS.  POSTS SHOULD BE 
AWARE THAT AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE TIME CHARTERED 
MSC SHIPS WILL REQUIRE DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCE FOR PORT 
CALLS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.  THE REQUEST FOR DIPLOMATIC 
CLEARANCE WILL EXPLICITLY IDENTIFY THESE VESSELS AS 
AFLOAT PREPOSITIONING FORCE SHIPS OF MSC.  THEY MAY NOT 
BE PAINTED DISTINCTIVELY OR BEAR THE MSC LOGO.  IT IS 
ESSENTIAL FOR POSTS TO IMPRESS UPON THEIR HOST 
GOVERNMENTS THE STATUS OF SUCH SHIPS IN THE EVENT OF 
PORT CALLS OR OTHER OPERATIONS IN HOST GOVERNMENT 
TERRITORIAL SEAS AND INTERNAL WATERS.  THE LIST OF 
SHIPS CURRENTLY IN THE APF IS AVAILABLE FROM THE CHIEF 
OF NAVAL OPERATIONS (OP-42).

SUBJECT:  ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
 
1.  SECRET -ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF AN ANALYSIS OF THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THE ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
PREPARED BY THE US INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY: 
 
ABU NIDAL TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
 
BACKGROUND: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS AND 
RUTHLESS OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST ORGANIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF 
THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, CAREFULLY 
PLANNING ITS OPERATIONS AND KEEPING ITS INFORMATION 
TIGHTLY COMPARTMENTED.  FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE 
ORGANIZATION HAS CONCENTRATED ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT 
PLO TARGETS, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IT IS AGAIN 
BROADENING ITS OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE. 
 
THE ORGANIZATION HAS A NUMBER OF COVER NAMES INCLUDING 
BLACK JUNE, NO LONGER USED, AND THE FATAH REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL.  MORE RECENTLY, IT HAS BEGUN USING THE NAME ARAB 
REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES WHEN STAGING ATTACKS AGAINST GULF 
TARGETS AND EGYPT.  IT ALSO CALLS ITSELF BLACK SEPTEMBER 
IN ATTACKS AGAINST JORDANIAN AND PALESTINIAN TARGETS, AND 
THE REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MUSLIMS 
(ROSM) IN ATTACKS AGAINST BRITISH TARGETS. 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1974 FROM ELEMENTS 
WHICH BROKE AWAY FROM ARAFAT\'S FATAH ORGANIZATION AFTER 
HE ANNOUNCED A BAN ON PLO INVOLVEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. 
THE GROUP IS HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA WHO GOES BY THE 
NAME OF ABU NIDAL.  UNLIKE MANY TERRORIST GROUPS, 
HOWEVER, IT IS SO WELL ORGANIZED, THAT IT CAN FUNCTION 
WITH OR WITHOUT ITS LEADER.  INDEED, BEFORE A NOVEMBER 
19, L985 INTERVIEW FROM LIBYA, ABU NIDAL WAS WIDELY 
RUMORED TO BE DEAD.  THE ABU NIDAL GROUP ALSO APPEARS TO 
BE LESS DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE FINANCING THAN OTHER GROUPS, 
IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE INCOME ON ITS 
OWN. 
 
THE GROUP IS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF VIOLENCE TO DESTROY 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO RECONCILE ISRAEL AND THE ARAB 
STATES.  IT ALSO CALLS FOR THE OVERTHROW OF ALL 
CONSERVATIVE AND MODERATE ARAB REGIMES AS WELL AS FOR THE 
DESTRUCTION OF MODERATE ELEMENTS IN THE PLO, NOTABLY 
ARAFAT\'S FATAH ORGANIZATION.  IT CONTENDS THAT BOTH 
INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN TERRORISM ARE NEEDED TO 
CREATE AN ALL EMBRACING ARAB REVOLUTION WHICH WILL IN 
TURN LIBERATE PALESTINE.  TO FURTHER ITS REVOLUTIONARY 
AIMS, IT WILL ALSO STRIKE AT EUROPEAN AND OTHER TARGETS 
IF IT BELIEVES THAT THERE IS ANY TACTICAL ADVANTAGE IN 
DOING SO. 
 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORGANIZATION PROBABLY NUMBERS SEVERAL 
HUNDRED.  IT HAS CELLS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH 
ASIA AND EUROPE.  OPERATIONAL GROUPS ARE SMALL, NUMBERING 
ONE TO THREE, EACH WITH GOOD OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND 
GOOD COMPARTMENTALIZATION.  OPERATIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY 
CAREFULLY COLLECTED, ON-TARGET INTELLIGENCE.  THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION ALSO MAKES USE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD, SOMETIMES INVOLVING 
THEM IN OPERATIONS AFTER ONLY PERFUNCTORY TRAINING. 
 
LINKAGES TO OTHER GROUPS AND STATES: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS IN MANY WAYS A ROGUE 
ORGANIZATION.  WHILE MAINTAINING ITS RADICAL PALESTINIAN 
OUTLOOK, IT HAS LINKED UP WITH VARIOUS ARAB PATRONS, 
PRESUMABLY FOR FINANCIAL AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT AS MUCH 
AS, IF NOT MORE THAN, FOR IDEOLOGICAL AFFINITY. 
 
WHEN FIRST ORGANIZED, THE GROUP CAME UNDER THE PATRONAGE 
OF IRAQ.  WHEN SADDAM HUSAYN FINALLY EXPELLED ABU NIDAL 
AND THE REMNANTS OF HIS GROUP IN MID-1983, HE MOVED TO 
SYRIA.  SINCE THEN, THE ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTING 
OPERATIONS AGAINST JORDAN, MODERATE PALESTINIANS AND 
ARAFAT\'S MAINLINE PLO, PRESUMABLY WITH THE SUPPORT AND 
COOPERATION OF SYRIAN INTELLIGENCE. 
 
IN RECENT MONTHS, ABU NIDAL HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF BECOMING 
MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH QADHAFI. THOUGH THE GROUP STILL 
MAINTAINS A HEADQUARTERS IN DAMASCUS (AND POSSIBLY ONE IN 
THE BIQA\'\'VALLEY), ABU NIDAL HIMSELF IS APPARENTLY 
CURRENTLY RESIDING IN LIBYA.  HE HAS GRANTED SEVERAL 
INTERVIEWS FROM LIBYA AND HAS SPOKEN HIGHLY OF QADHAFI IN 
THEM. 
 
LINKAGE BETWEEN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP AND OTHER TERRORIST 
GROUPS IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN.  THE GROUP IS VERY 
TIGHTLY ORGANIZED AND CONTROLLED AND, FOR SECURITY 
REASONS, DOES NOT APPEAR TO COOPERATE CLOSELY WITH OTHER 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THIS DOES NOT RULE OUT NON-OPERATIONAL 
COOPERATION WHEN THE GROUP BELIEVES THERE IS SUFFICIENT 
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IT HAS ADMITTED IN AN 
INTERVIEW TO GROWING COOPERATION WITH EUROPEAN 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE IRA. 
 
CURRENT OPERATIONS: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED ITS 
ABILITY TO OPERATE IN ANY COUNTRY IT CHOOSES AND HAS 
SHOWN NO SIGNS OF ESCHEWING OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES 
SYMPATHETIC TO THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE, PARTICULARLY IN ITS 
ANTI-ARAFAT OPERATIONS.  THE ORGANIZATION HAS STAGED 
ATTACKS IN 18 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, AND HAS 
CONDUCTED OVER 60 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS, 30 SINCE 1984 AND 11 SINCE JULY OF THIS YEAR. 
 
IN RECENT INTERVIEWS, NOTABLY ONE IN DER SPIEGEL, LAST 
MONTH, ABU NIDAL HIMSELF HAS MADE THREATS AGAINST MANY 
COUNTRIES AND WORLD LEADERS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT MUBARAK, 
PRIME MINISTER THATCHER AND PRESIDENT REAGAN.  HIS 
TIRADES AGAINST JEWS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY VIRULENT. 
ESPECIALLY SINCE 1984, ABU NIDAL HAS CONCENTRATED ON 
JORDANIANS AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO OFFICIALS.  THESE ATTACKS 
WERE PROVOKED IN LARGE MEASURE BY THE JORDANIAN AGREEMENT 
TO HOST THE PNC MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1984 AND BY KING 
HUSSEIN\'S FEBRUARY ACCORD WITH ARAFAT TO RESTART THE 
ARAB-ISRAELI PEACE PROCESS.  THE ATTACKS ON JORDANIANS IN 
1985 HAVE INCLUDED: 
 
-- NOVEMBER 24 ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN IN AMMAN BY 
THREE ABU NIDAL AGENTS. 
 
- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN PUBLISHER IN ATHENS IN 
SEPTEMBER. 
 
-- A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
GREECE BY A PALESTINIAN ARRESTED BY GREEK POLICE IN 
AUGUST. 
 
-- AN UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT ON 
AUGUST 5, BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN INITIATED BY ABU NIDAL. 
 
- THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN TURKEY ON 
JULY 24. 
 
-- ON JULY 1, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE BRITISH AIR TICKET 
OFFICE IN MADRID ALSO DAMAGING THE TWA OFFICE UPSTAIRS. 
NEARBY, THE JORDANIAN AIRLINE OFFICE WAS HIT BY AUTOMATIC 
WEAPONS FIRE AND TWO GRENADES WHICH DID NOT EXPLODE.  IN 
ALL, ONE WAS KILLED AND 24 WERE WOUNDED. 
 
-- AMAN CLAIMING TO BE WITH BLACK SEPTEMBER FIRED A 
ROCKET AT THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN ROME IN 
APRIL. 
 
-- AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET ATTACK ON A JORDANIAN AIRLINER 
TAKING OFF FROM ATHENS IN APRIL.  THE ROCKET HIT THE 
PLANE BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. 
 
-- IN DECEMBER, THE JORDANIAN DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN 
BUCHAREST WAS KILLED GETTING INTO HIS CAR. 
 
THE GROUP HAS ALSO TARGETED BRITISH INTERESTS.  ROSM 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MARCH 1985 KIDNAPPING OF A 
BRITISH JOURNALIST IN LEBANON AND THE ASSASSINATION OF 
BRITISH DIPLOMATS IN INDIA AND GREECE IN 1984.  THE 
PURPOSE OF THESE ATTACKS IS PROBABLY TO FORCE THE UK TO 
RELEASE ABU NIDAL MEMBERS IMPRISONED FOR THE ATTEMPTED 
ASSASSINATION OF THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN LONDON IN JUNE 
1982. 
 
BASED ON THE STYLE OF ABU NIDAL ATTACKS, IT IS EVIDENT 
 
THAT THE GROUP IS WILLING TO CAUSE INDISCRIMINATE 
CASUALTIES.  APART FROM THE ASSASSINATION OF PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUALS, ABU NIDAL OPERATIONS IN 1985 RESULTED IN 
NINE DEATHS AND 201 WOUNDED AMONG INNOCENT BYSTANDERS NOT 
COUNTING THE VICTIMS IN THE EGYPT AIR TRAGEDY.  HAD THE 
JORDANIAN AIRLINER HIT BY AN ABU NIDAL ROCKET TAKING OFF 
FROM ATHENS AIRPORT CRASHED, THE NUMBER COULD HAVE BEEN 
MUCH HIGHER.  IN 1983, 111 DIED IN THE CRASH OF A GULF 
AIRLINES JET ON WHICH AN ABU NIDAL BOMB EXPLODED.  TWO 
THIRDS OF THE GROUP\'S 19 ATTACKS THIS YEAR HAVE TAKEN 
PLACE IN WESTERN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN CITIZENS HAVE 
INCREASINGLY BECOME CASUALTIES AND INTERESTS OF EUROPEAN 
COUNTRIES ARE INCREASINGLY DAMAGED BY THESE ACTIONS. 
 
THE GROUP\'S ABILITY TO MOVE AT WILL IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 
THEIR ACTIVITIES HARDER TO TRACE.  TO FACILITATE TRAVEL, 
THE ORGANIZATION HAS A RECORD OF USING MOROCCAN AND OTHER 
NORTH AFRICAN TRAVEL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THOSE PRODUCED 
BY ITS OWN FORGING OPERATION.  SOME COUNTRIES SUCH AS 
YUGOSLAVIA HAVE BEEN MORE PERMISSIVE THAN OTHERS IN 
ALLOWING ABU NIDAL MEMBERS FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, 
APPARENTLY HOPING THAT THIS WILL BUY THEM A MODICUM OF 
IMMUNITY FROM TERRORIST ACTS.  THERE IS GROWING 
RECOGNITION THAT THIS IS A DUBIOUS ASSUMPTION. 
NEVERTHELESS, TAKING LEGAL ACTION IS SOMETIMES 
DIFFICULT.  IN OCTOBER, AN ALLEGED HIGH RANKING ABU NIDAL 
FIGURE USING SPAIN AS A BASE WAS ACQUITTED BY A SPANISH 
COURT OF BEING A MEMBER OF A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
 
AMONG THE ATTACKS INVOLVING INNOCENT BYSTANDERS ARE: 
 
-- THE NOVEMBER 23 EGYPT AIR HIJACKING TO MALTA WHICH 
TOOK 60 LIVES.  THE ARAB REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES, A COVER 
NAME FOR ABU NIDAL, CLAIMED CREDIT FOR THE HIJACKING, AND 
THERE IS CORROBORATING EVIDENCE THAT IT WAS AN ABU NIDAL 
OPERATION.  THE ACT ALSO BORE THE SIGNATURE OF THE ABU 
NIDAL GROUP. 
 
-- THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT ARRESTED IN NOVEMBER A 12-MAN 
TEAM OF ABU NIDAL TERRORISTS INTENDING TO ATTACK THE 
ISRAELI CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 30, A BOMB EXPLODED NEAR THE EL AL OFFICE 
IN AMSTERDAM, CLAIMED BY ABU NIDAL (FATAH REVOLUTIONARY 
COUNCIL). 
 
-- ABU NIDAL BOMBED THE BRITISH AIR OFFICE IN ROME IN 
SEPTEMBER INJURING 15 PERSONS, MANY OF THEM PASSERSBY. 
 
-- BRITAIN ARRESTED TWO ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES IN SEPTEMBER 
WHO INTENDED TO ATTACK AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET. 
-- ABU NIDAL MEMBERS THREW GRENADES AT ROME\'S CAFE DE 
PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, INJURING 38 TOURISTS, AMONG THEM 
GERMANS, BRITONS, ITALIANS, ARGENTINIANS, BRAZILIANS AND 
AMERICANS. 
 
--  A JULY INCIDENT IN COPENHAGEN INVOLVING A SYNAGOGUE 
AND THE NORTHWEST ORIENT AIRLINES OFFICE, AND ONE IN 
AMSTERDAM ON SEPTEMBER 30 INVOLVING THE EL AL OFFICE HAVE 
NOT BEEN DIRECTLY TIED TO ANY GROUP, BUT THERE IS 
SUSPICION THAT ABU NIDAL WAS INVOLVED. 
 
-- THE GROUP BOMBED TWO HOTELS IN ATHENS, ONE IN 
SEPTEMBER WHICH INJURED 19 PERSONS, MOSTLY BRITISH, AND 
ONE IN AUGUST, WHICH INJURED 13 BRITISH. 
 
-- THE BOMBING OF TWO RESTAURANTS IN KUWAIT IN JULY, MOST 
PROBABLY BY ABU NIDAL, KILLED EIGHT PERSONS AND INJURING 
89 OTHERS. 
 
-- THE ATTACKS ON THE AIRLINE OFFICES IN MADRID KILLING 
ONE AND WOUNDING 24. 
 
-- THE ROCKET AGAINST A JORDANIAN AIRILNER IN APRIL. 
 
FUTURE TRENDS AND IMPLICATIONS: 
 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO 
CONCENTRATE ON JORDANIAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO TARGETS. 
EVEN IF THE SYRIANS FOR TACTICAL REASONS SHOULD CURTAIL 
THEIR SUPPORT OF THE ABU NIDAL GROUP\'S OPERATIONS AGAINST 
JORDAN AND PRO-ARAFAT PLO, THE ACTIVITIES ARE LIKELY TO 
CONTINUE.  ABU NIDAL HIMSELF, UNDER DEATH SENTENCE BY THE 
PLO SINCE 1974 FOR PLOTTING AGAINST THE LIFE OF ARAFAT, 
AND THOSE UNDER HIM ARE CARRYING ON WHAT AMOUNTS TO A 
PERSONAL VENDETTA.  THE ADDITION OF LIBYAN SUPPORT 
PRESENTS AN EVEN BROADER THREAT, PARTICULARLY FOR WESTERN 
STATES.  QADHAFI\'S PARANOIA AGAINST THE WEST AND ABU 
NIDAL\'S EFFICIENCY COMPRISE A DEADLY COMBINATION. 
INCREASINGLY, HIGH CASUALTY ATTACKS AGAINST WESTERN 
TARGETS ARE LIKELY. 
 
IN THE LONGER RUN, THE ABU NIDAL GROUP, DUE TO ITS 
EXCELLENT ORGANIZATION, ACCESS TO FUNDS AND SUPPORT, MOST 
RECENTLY FROM LIBYA, AND DEDICATION TO TERRORISM, 
CONSTITUTES ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  ITS WIDE-SPREAD NETWORK AND RUTHLESS 
DISREGARD FOR THE INTERESTS AND IDEOLOGICAL POSITIONS OF 
THE COUNTRIES, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IT STRIKES, MAKES 
IT A FORMIDABLE FOE.  ONLY THROUGH A COORDINATED EFFORT 
OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES FOR WHICH IT POSES A POTENTIAL 
THREAT CAN THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION BE STOPPED.

1.  HERE FOR POSTS USE WITH PRESS AND MEDIA IS AN 
UNCLASSIFIED PAPER ON THE ABU NIDAL GROUP WHICH WAS MADE 
AVAILABLE AT THE DECEMBER 31, 1985 STATE DEPARTMENT NOON 
PRESS BRIEFING. 
 
BEGIN TEXT. 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP IS AMONG THE MOST DANGEROUS OF THE 
MIDDLE EASTERN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.  IT IS PROBABLY 
THE BEST ORGANIZED AND MOST EFFECTIVE OF THE RADICAL 
PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, CAREFULLY PLANNING ITS 
OPERATIONS AND KEEPING ITS INFORMATION TIGHTLY 
COMPARTMENTED. 
 
THE GROUP HAS REPEATEDLY DEMONSTRATED ITS ABILITY TO 
OPERATE IN ANY COUNTRY IT CHOOSES.  IT HAS STAGED ATTACKS 
IN OVER 20 COUNTRIES ON THREE CONTINENTS, AND OPERATES 
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. 
 
ABU NIDAL HAS CONDUCTED OVER 60 TERRORIST ATTACKS DURING 
THE LAST EIGHT YEARS--AT LEAST 30 OF THEM SINCE THE 
BEGINNING OF 1984.  TWO-THIRDS OF THE GROUP\'S NEARLY 20 
ATTACKS THIS YEAR HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN WESTERN EUROPE, AS 
INNOCENT BYSTANDERS INCREASINGLY HAVE BECOME CASUALTIES 
OF THE GROUP\'S ASSAULTS: 
 
--THE SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS ON AIRLINE OFFICES IN ROME AND 
VIENNA ON DECEMBER 27, WHICH HAVE THE HALLMARKS OF ABU 
NIDAL, LEFT MORE THAN A DOZEN DEAD\' INCLUDING 5 AMERICANS. 
 
--THE EGYPT AIR HIJACKING IN LATE NOVEMBER ULTIMATELY 
COST THE LIVES OF 59 PASSENGERS 
 
--THE GROUP BOMBED THE BRITISH AIR OFFICE IN ROME IN 
SEPTEMBER INJURING 15 PERSONS, MANY OF THEM PASSERSBY. 
 
--ABU NIDAL MEMBERS THREW GRENADES AT ROME\'S CAFE DE 
PARIS IN SEPTEMBER, INJURING 38 TOURISTS--AMONG THEM 
AMERICANS, GERMANS, BRITONS, ITALIANS, ARGENTINES, AND 
BRAZILIANS. 
 
--THE GROUP BOMBED TWO HOTELS IN ATHENS, ONE IN SEPTEMBER 
THAT INJURED 19, MOSTLY BRITISH TOURISTS, AND ONE IN 
AUGUST THAT INJURED 13 BRITONS. 
 
--IN SPAIN, ABU NIDAL ATTACKS IN JULY AT THE BRITISH AIR 
OFFICE AND THE NEARBY ALIA TICKET OFFICE KILLED ONE AND 
WOUNDED 24 CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES. 
 
--ALSO IN JULY THE GROUP WAS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
BOMBING OF TWO RESTAURANTS IN KUWAIT, KILLING EIGHT AND 
INJURING ALMOST 90. 
 
--IN APRIL, AN ABU NIDAL TERRORIST FIRED A ROCKET AT A 
JORDANIAN AIRLINER AS IT WAS TAKING OFF FROM ATHENS 
AIRPORT.  THE ROCKET HIT THE PLANE BUT DID NOT EXPLODE. 
HUNDREDS OF CASUALTIES MIGHT HAVE RESULTED HAD THE 
OPERATION BEEN SUCCESSFUL. 
 
THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION IS \"FATAH 
- REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\", WHICH IT USUALLY EMPLOYS WHEN 
ATTACKING ISRAELI TARGETS.  BUT IT HAS EMPLOYED A NUMBER 
OF COVER NAMES FOR ITS OPERATIONS.   ORIGINALLY THE GROUP 
OPERATED UNDER THE NAME BLACK JUNE; MORE RECENTLY, THE 
GROUP HAS USED THE NAME ARAB REVOLUTIONARY BRIGADES WHEN 
IT STAGED ATTACKS AGAINST PERSIAN GULF TARGETS.  IT ALSO 
ACTS AS BLACK SEPTEMBER WHEN IT ATTACKS JORDANIAN AND 
PALESTINIAN TARGETS AND EMPLOYS THE NAME REVOLUTIONARY 
ORGANIZATION OF SOCIALIST MOSLEMS (ROSM) AS ITS SIGNATURE 
FOR ATTACKS AGAINST BRITISH TARGETS.  IT ADDED EGYPTIAN 
NOMENCLATURES WHEN IT HIJACKED THE EGYPTAIR PLANE IN 
NOVEMBER. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
THE GROUP IS HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA (WHO USES THE NOM 
DE GUERRE ABU NIDAL), GREW OUT OF ELEMENTS THAT BROKE 
AWAY A DECADE AGO FROM PLO CHAIRMAN ARAFAT\'S FATAH 
ORGANIZATION.  THE GROUP IS COMMITTED TO THE USE OF 
VIOLENCE TO DESTROY DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS DESIGNED TO 
RECONCILE ISRAEL AND THE ARAB STATES, ESPECIALLY THOSE 
MOUNTED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY KING HUSSEIN AND ARAFAT\'S 
PLO.  THE ABU NIDAL GROUP ALSO CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION 
OF RULING \"REACTIONARY\" REGIMES SUCH AS JORDAN, EGYPT, 
AND THE PERSIAN GULF STATES AND IS CRITICAL OF WHAT IT 
SEES AS ARAFAT\'S AND THE PLO\'S MODERATION AND LACK OF 
REVOLUTIONARY BASE AND ZEAL.  CONSEQUENTLY THE GROUP 
CONTENDS THAT BOTH INTER-ARAB AND INTRA-PALESTINIAN 
TERRORISM ARE NEEDED TO FORCE THE ALL-EMBRACING ARAB 
REVOLUTION WHICH IN TURN WOULD LEAD TO THE LIBERATION OF 
PALESTINE. 
 
THE GROUP WAS FORMED IN 1974 AFTER ARAFAT INSTITUTED A 
BAN ON PLO INVOLVEMENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
OUTSIDE ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  ABU NIDAL\'S 
RADICAL VIEWS FOUND FAVOR AT THE TIME WITH THE IRAQI 
REGIME, WHICH HELPED HIM CREATE THE ORGANIZATION THAT ABU 
NIDAL CALLED \"FATAH - THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL\" TO 
PROMOTE HIS CLAIM THAT HIS ORGANIZATION, RATHER THAN THE 
ONE LED BY ARAFAT, WAS THE LEGITIMATE FATAH.  HE HAS 
SIMILARLY DUPLICATED OTHER FATAH ORGANIZATIONAL TITLES TO 
SUGGEST A PARALLEL STRUCTURE WITH THE ORIGINAL. 
 
BEGINNING IN THE EARLY 1980S, BAGHDAD SUPPRESSED 
ACTIVITIES OF THE ABU NIDAL GROUP OUT OF IRAQ.  ELEMENTS 
OF THE GROUP THEN MOVED TO DAMASCUS.  SINCE EARLY 1984, 
LIBYA BEGAN TO PROVIDE INCREASED SUPPORT TO THE GROUP AND 
ABU NIDAL HIMSELF AND MANY OF THE GROUPS OPERATIONS MAY 
HAVE MOVED THERE WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS. 
 
THE GROUP PROBABLY HAS SEVERAL HUNDRED MEMBERS ALTHOUGH 
AN ACCURATE COUNT IS DIFFICULT.  WE BELIEVE THE GROUP HAS 
A NUMBER OF CELLS THROUGHOUT WESTERN EUROPE AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST, AND MAKES USE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
PALESTINIAN STUDENTS STUDYING ABROAD, SOMETIMES INVOLVING 
THEM IN OPERATIONS AFTER ONLY PERFUNCTORY TRAINING. 
THESE NEW RECRUITS FOR EXAMPLE, WERE INVOLVED IN THE FIVE 
GRENADE ATTACKS STAGED BY THE GROUP IN 1985. 
 
CURRENT OPERATIONS AND TRENDS 
 
BASED ON THE STYLE OF ABU NIDAL ATTACKS IT IS EVIDENT 
THAT THE GROUP IS WILLING TO CAUSE INDISCRIMINATE 
CASUALTIES.  APART FROM ASSASSINATIONS OF PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUALS, ABU NIDAL OPERATIONS THROUGH NOVEMBER 1985 
RESULTED IN NEARLY 70 DEATHS AND 201 WOUNDED AMONG 
INNOCENT BYSTANDERS--AND THE NUMBER COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH 
HIGHER IF THE JORDANIAN AIRLINER ATTACK IN ATHENS HAD 
BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, 111 DIED IN THE 
CRASH OF A GULF AIR JET ON WHICH AN ABU NIDAL BOMB MAY 
HAVE EXPLODED. 
 
THE ABU NIDAL GROUP HAS CONCENTRATED ON ATTACKING 
JORDANIAN INTERESTS SINCE 1984.  THESE ATTACKS WERE 
PROVOKED BY THE JORDANIAN AGREEMENT TO HOST THE PNC 
MEETING IN NOVEMBER 1984 AND KING HUSSEIN\'S FEBRUARY 
ACCORD WITH ARAFAT TO RESTART THE STALLED MIDDLE EAST 
PEACE PROCESS.  ABU NIDAL OPERATIVES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE 
ASSASSINATED FORMER WEST BANK MAYOR AND PALESTINIAN 
MODERATE FAHD QAWASMEH IN DECEMBER 1984 SHORTLY AFTER HIS 
ELECTION TO THE PLO EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.  THE 
ANTI-JORDANIAN/PLO CAMPAIGN HAS NOT ABATED.  AS LONG AS 
JORDANIAN AND PLO EFFORTS TOWARD MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE, ATTACKS AGAINST BOTH JORDANIAN AND 
PALESTINIAN TARGETS PROBABLY WILL ALSO CONTINUE. 
ASIDE FROM THE ATTACK ON ALIA OFFICES IN MADRID IN JULY 
AND THE ATTEMPT TO DOWN A JORDANIAN AIRLINER OVER ATHENS 
IN APRIL, OTHER INCIDENTS INVOLVING JORDANIAN TARGETS IN 
1985 HAVE INCLUDED: 
 
--THE NOVEMBER 24 ASSASSINATION OF A PALESTINIAN IN AMMAN. 
 
--THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN PUBLISHER IN ATHENS IN 
SEPTEMBER 
 
--A PLOT TO ASSASSINATE THE JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO 
GREECE IN AUGUST. 
 
--THE MURDER OF A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN ANKARA ON JULY 24. 
 
--A ROCKET ATTACK ON THE JORDANIAN EMBASSY IN ROME IN 
APRIL\' 
 
THE GROUP HAS ALSO TARGETED BRITISH INTERESTS.  ROSM 
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE KIDNAPPING IN MARCH 1985 
OF A BRITISH JOURNALIST IN LEBANON AND THE ASSASSINATION 
OF BRITISH DIPLOMATS IN INDIA AND GREECE IN 1984.  THE 
PURPOSE OF THE ATTACKS PROBABLY IS TO FORCE THE UK TO 
RELEASE GROUP MEMBERS IMPRISONED FOR THE ATTEMPTED 
ASSASSINATION OF THE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR IN LONDON IN JUNE 
1982. 
 
EVEN BEFORE THE RECENT ATTACKS ON VIENNA AND ROME 
AIRPORTS, ABU NIDAL HAD BEGUN TO CONCENTRATE HIS FIELD OF 
OPERATIONS IN WESTERN EUROPE\'  ALTHOUGH HIS TARGETS HAVE 
BEEN HIS USUAL ENEMIES, E\'G\' BRITISH, ISRAELI, MODERATE 
ARAB, HE HAS BECOME VERY INDISCRIMINATE ABOUT INJURING 
BYSTANDERS. THE RELATIVELY RELAXED CONTROLS IN WESTERN 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAS BEEN CONDUCIVE TO HIS OPERATIONS 
THERE.  THE PATTERN OF CONCENTRATING HIS EFFORTS IN 
EUROPE HAS COINCIDED WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF HIS LINKS 
WITH LIBYA. THE LIKELIHOOD OF LIBYAN FINANCING, 
SAFEHAVEN, AND LOGISTICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE VERY 
HELPFUL TO HIS FUTURE INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OPERATIONS.

1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING FOR POST\'S INFORMATION IS TEXT OF 
INFORMATION MEMO DATED 1/28/86 ON DEVELOPMENTS IN 
UGANDA. 
 
3.  BEGIN TEXT.  SUMMARY:  SOUTHERN GUERRILLAS HAVE WON 
THE CAPITAL AND HEARTLAND OF UGANDA AND HAVE THE 
MILITARY EDGE ON DISSIDENT NORTHERN TRIBES. THE NEW 
HEAD OF STATE IS A FERVENT NATIONALIST WHO LIKELY WILL 
COMBINE THIRD-WORLD RHETORIC WITH PRAGMATIC POLICIES. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
THE 5,000-MAN NATIONAL RESISTANCE ARMY (NRA) NOW 
CONTROLS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF UGANDA AND GAINS GROUND 
DAILY FROM FORMER GOVERNMENT TROOPS IN DISORDERLY 
RETREAT.  LONGER TERM, NRA FORCES LIKELY WILL FACE 
 
LOW-GRADE BUSH WARFARE FROM DISSIDENT NORTHERN TRIBES. 
NRA\'S SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND ORGANIZATION, AND ITS 
CONTROL OVER THE CAPITAL AND ECONOMIC HEART OF UGANDA, 
SHOULD GIVE IT A DECISIVE EDGE.  NRA ESCHEWS THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS ABUSES OF FORMER MILITARY LEADERS AND HAS BEEN 
MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN THEY IN WINNING THE POPULATION\'S 
AFFECTIONS. 
 
ALL 170 AMERICANS IN UGANDA ARE REPORTED SAFE AND 
KAMPALA IS RETURNING TO NORMAL WITH RESTORATION OF 
POWER, WATER AND TELEPHONE, AND REOPENING OF MARKETS. 
IN CONTRAST TO THE BEHAVIOR OF GOVERNMENT TROOPS AFTER 
THE JULY 85 COUP, NRA SOLDIERS ARE REPORTED TO BE 
WELLDISCIPLINED AND POPULAR WITH TOWNSPEOPLE. 
 
AMBASSADOR HOUDEK HAS MET WITH NRA COMMANDER YOWERI 
MUSEVENI AND FEELS WE CAN WORK WITH THE NEW REGIME. 
MUSEVENI MAY BE A STRIDENT INTERLOCUTOR, BUT HIS 
GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE INIMICAL TO U.S. INTERESTS. 
 
MUSEVENI\'S IDEOLOGICAL ORIENTATION IS MURKY, COMBINING 
FERVENT NATIONALISM, THIRD WORLD RHETORIC AND PRAGMATIC 
OPPORTUNISM.  HE DECLARED TO THE DIPLOMATIC COMMUNITY 
THAT HIS FOREIGN POLICY WOULD BE NON-ALIGNED AND THAT 
HE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH SOUTH AFRICA AND 
ISRAEL.  LIKE MANY UGANDAN FACTIONS, HE HAS SOUGHT 
LIBYAN ASSISTANCE, BUT WAS MOTIVATED PROBABLY MORE BY 
OPPORTUNISM THAN IDEOLOGICAL AFFILIATION.  NRA 
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE STRESSED TO US THEIR DESIRE FOR 
GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. 
 
IN HIS WRITINGS, MUSEVENI HAS FAVORED ACTIVE STATE 
GUIDANCE OVER THE ECONOMY.  BUT HE HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED 
THAT FREE ENTERPRISE BASED ON SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE 
IS THE KEY TO UGANDA\'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  MUSEVENI 
SAID HIS GOVERNMENT WILL WELCOME FOREIGN ASSISTANCE IN 
DEVELOPING PRODUCTIVE ENTERPRISES.  OUR AMBASSADOR IS 
ANXIOUS TO RESUME THE AID PROGRAM AND ENGAGE MUSEVENI 
IN DIALOGUE ON UGANDA\'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
EVOLUTION. END TEXT.

1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES VERY MUCH MFA ADDITIONAL 
SECRETARY KHAN\'S READOUT OF HIS RECENT VISIT TO TEHRAN 
(REFTEL).  WE AGREE WITH HIS GENERAL ASSESSMENT THAT 
THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT THE IRANIAN SIDE IS READY TO MOVE 
TOWARD MEDIATION/NEGOTIATIONS ON THE WAR.  WE ALSO 
BELIEVE THAT HE IS CORRECT THAT A MAJOR IRANIAN OFFENSIVE 
SHOULD BE EXPECTED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, IF IT 
CAN BE MANAGED LOGISTICALLY.  WE WERE STRUCK, HOWEVER, 
AND VERY INTERESTED, IN HIS COMMENTS REGARDING IRANIAN 
MORALE AND DECREASING SUPPORT FOR THE REVOLUTION WHICH HE 
OBSERVED, BOTH IN TEHRAN AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  HIS 
OBSERVATION ON THE MODERATE GROUP AMONG THE CLERGY WAS 
ALSO OF GREAT INTEREST TO US.  ON DOMESTIC IRANIAN ISSUES 
AS WELL AS ON MATTERS OF SHIA THEOLOGY AND THE 
INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE CLERGY AND THE GOVERNMENT, SUCH 
A GROUP HAS BEEN IDENTIFIABLE FOR SOME TIME.  WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN, HOWEVER, RECENT EVIDENCE THAT ITS DIFFERENCES WITH 
THE DOMINANT, MORE RADICAL GROUP EXTENDED TO OPPOSITION 
TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE WAR. 
 
3.  WITH THAT AS BACKGROUND, WE WOULD APPRECIATE EMBASSY 
FOLLOWING UP WITH KHAN, FOCUSSING ON THE FOLLOWING 
QUESTIONS: 
 
   -THE CHANGED ATMOSPHERE IN TEHRAN: ON WHAT DOES HE 
HINGE HIS JUDGMENT THAT THE MOOD TOWARD THE REVOLUTION OR 
THE WAR HAS CHANGED?  SPECIFICALLY, WHAT ARE HIS GROUNDS 
TO BELIEVE THAT THE FRUSTRATIONS NOTED REFTEL EXTEND TO 
LOWER CLASS SUPPORTERS OF THE REGIME AND ARE THUS NOT 
JUST A MIDDLE CLASS PHENOMENON?  DO THE PAKISTANIS 
BELIEVE THEY HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF POLITICAL TRENDS IN 
SOUTH TEHRAN, FOR EXAMPLE? (SOUTH TEHRAN IS THE LOWER 
CLASS RESIDENTIAL AREA OF THE CAPITAL, WHERE MANY OF THE 
RECENT MIGRANTS FROM THE COUNTRY LIVE). 
 
   --ON WHAT BASIS DOES HE JUDGE THAT THE MOOD \"IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE\" HAS CHANGED ALONG THE LINES OF THE MOOD IN 
TEHRAN?  HOW DOES HE MEASURE/ASSESS THAT MOOD? 
 
   --THE COMPOSITION OF THE MODERATE CLERICAL GROUP 
INTERESTS US.  WHO ARE ITS LEADERS?  PROMINENT 
SUPPORTERS?  HOW DOES KHAN KNOW THEIR VIEWS ON THE WAR 
(AS OPPOSED TO DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL QUESTIONS 
WHICH ARE SUBJECTS OF OPEN DEBATE)?  DOES HE HAVE THE 
SENSE THAT THIS GROUP IS GROWING IN IMPORTANCE?  AND, 
ABOVE ALL, DOES HE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE 
SUBJECT OF THE IRANIAN VIEW OF THE WAR IS A MATTER OF 
POTENTIAL DEBATE OR CONCEIVABLE CHANGE OF POLICY WHILE 
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI REMAINS IN ACTIVE CONTROL OF THE 
REGIME?  IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT A MIDDLE GROUND 
MIGHT DEVELOP (OR EXISTS) WHEREBY IRAN WOULD ACCEPT AN 
END TO THE WAR AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM 
POWER, BUT NOT THE ELIMINATION OF BAATH PARTY CONTROL OF 
THE STATE?

SUBJECT:      DOCUMENTS ON SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
 
1.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF A FACT PAPER ON SYRIAN 
SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND A CHRONOLOGY OF SELECTED 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS BY SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS.  EARLIER 
VERSIONS OF BOTH DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED TO THE PRESS ON 
NOVEMBER 14 AND APPEARED IN THE USIA WIRELESS FILE ON 
THAT DATE.  BOTH DOCUMENTS HAVE NOW BEEN REVISED TO 
REFLECT THE HASI CONVICTION IN WEST BERLIN ON NOVEMBER 
26.  WE ASSUME USIS MADE APPROPRIATE USE OF THE MATERIAL 
APPEARING IN THE WIRELESS FILE.  WE ARE SENDING THE 
REVISED VERSIONS SO THAT POLOFFS MAY SHARE THE 
INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THESE DOCUMENTS WITH HOST 
GOVERNMENTS. 
 
2.  (BEGIN TEXT OF FACT PAPER) 
 
DECEMBER 5, 1986 
 
SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM:  1983-1986 
 
NEW EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT FOR AND DIRECT INVOLVEMENT 
IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN 
TWO RECENT TRIALS INCLUDING THE CONVICTION IN GREAT 
BRITAIN OF NIZAR HINDAWI FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN 
EL AL CIVILIAN AIRPLANE WITH 375 PASSENGERS ABOARD. 
 
SYRIA CLEARLY HAS A LONG RECORD OF INVOLVEMENT IN 
TERRORISM.  SYRIA IS ONE OF THE \"CHARTER MEMBERS\" OF 
COUNTRIES ON THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\'S TERRORISM LIST, WHICH 
WAS FIRST COMPILED IN 1979.  (COUNTRIES CURRENTLY ON THE 
LIST ARE SYRIA, LIBYA, IRAN, SOUTH YEMEN, AND CUBA.) 
 
THE PATTERN OF SYRIAN ACTIVITY IN SUPPORT OF TERRORISM 
HAS VARIED.  FROM THE MID-1970\'S THROUGH 1983, SYRIAN 
PERSONNEL ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  THESE OPERATIONS WERE PRIMARILY 
DIRECTED AGAINST OTHER ARABS, SUCH AS SYRIAN DISSIDENTS, 
MODERATE ARAB STATES SUCH AS JORDAN, AND PRO-ARAFAT 
PALESTINIANS, AS WELL AS ISRAELI AND JEWISH TARGETS.  IN 
1982, FOR EXAMPLE, A CAR BOMB EXPLODED IN FRONT OF THE 
OFFICES OF A LEBANESE-OWNED PRO-IRAQI NEWSPAPER IN 
DOWNTOWN PARIS, KILLING ONE PERSON AND INJURING SCORES OF 
OTHERS.  FRANCE LATER EXPELLED TWO SYRIAN DIPLOMATS AND 
ORDERED ITS AMBASSADOR HOME FOR CONSULTATIONS. 
 
BY LATE 1983 DAMASCUS HAD CURTAILED USE OF ITS OWN 
PERSONNEL.  INSTEAD, IT BEGAN TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON 
TERRORIST GROUPS MADE UP OF NON-SYRIANS WHO HAVE BASES 
AND TRAINING FACILITIES IN SYRIA AND SYRIAN-OCCUPIED 
AREAS OF LEBANON.  THE MOST NOTORIOUS OF THESE IS THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION. 
 
AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT SYRIA PREFERS TO 
SUPPORT GROUPS WHOSE ACTIVITIES ARE GENERALLY IN LINE 
WITH SYRIAN OBJECTIVES, RATHER THAN TO SELECT TARGETS OR 
CONTROL OPERATIONS ITSELF.  DAMASCUS UTILIZES THESE 
GROUPS TO ATTACK OR INTIMIDATE ENEMIES AND OPPONENTS AND 
TO EXERT ITS INFLUENCE IN THE REGION.  YET AT THE SAME 
TIME IT CAN DISAVOW KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR OPERATIONS.  SUCH 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE CARRIED OUT SCORES OF 
ATTACKS AGAINST PALESTINIAN AND OTHER ARAB, TURKISH, 
ISRAELI AND WESTERN TARGETS DURING THE PAST THREE 
YEARS. 
 
THIS YEAR, INVESTIGATIONS INTO MAJOR INCIDENTS HAVE 
REVEALED ANOTHER CHANGE IN SYRIAN ACTIVITIES:  THAT SYRIA 
HAS NOT ABANDONED ITS WILLINGNESS TO BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED 
IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE BRITISH TRIAL AND 
INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTIVE EL AL BOMBING EXPOSED THE 
DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF PRESIDENT ASSAD\'S INTELLIGENCE 
SERVICES.  AND THE WEST BERLIN TRIAL INTO THE BOMBING OF 
THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN WEST BERLIN REVEAED 
THE INVOLVEMENT OF SYRIAN OFFICIALS.  TO A LARGE DEGREE, 
SYRIA HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING ITS TRACKS.  NOW, 
HOWEVER, IN BRITAIN AND BERLIN, EVIDENCE OF MORE DIRECT 
SYRIAN INVOLVEMENT HAS EMERGED. 
 
 
LONDON AND BERLIN INVESTIGATIONS 
 
IN THE BRITISH INVESTIGATION OF THE ABORTED EL AL ATTACK, 
HINDAWI TOLD BRITISH POLICE HE WAS RECRUITED BY HAITHAM 
SAID, AN AIDE TO MAJOR GENERAL AL-KHULI, CHIEF OF SYRIAN 
AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE.  ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, AL-KHULI\'S OPERATIVES: (1) 
SUPPLIED HINDAWI, A JORDANIAN, WITH A SYRIAN PASSPORT; 
(2) GAVE HIM DOLLARS 12,000 AND PROMISED HIM MORE MONEY 
WHEN HE COMPLETED HIS MISSION TO PLANT A BOMB ABOARD AN 
EL AL CIVILIAN AIRLINER; (3) PROVIDED HIM WITH THE BOMB 
WHICH WAS CARRIED INTO LONDON ABOARD THE SYRIAN ARAB 
AIRLINES, WHICH ALSO GAVE HIM SAA CREW MEMBER HOTEL 
ACCOMMODATIONS; AND (4) TRAINED HIM IN THE BOMB\'S USE. 
 
HINDAWI TRIED TO USE HIS PREGNANT GIRL FRIEND AS THE 
UNWITTING CARRIER OF THE SOPHISTICATED BOMB WHICH WAS 
BUILT INTO HER CARRY-ON BAG.  IF AN ALERT SECURITY 
OFFICIAL HAD NOT SPOTTED THE DEVICE AFTER HER BAG CLEARED 
AN EARLIER CHECK, 375 INNOCENT PERSONS, INCLUDING SOME 
230 AMERICANS, WOULD HAVE PERISHED. 
 
AFTER THE APRIL 17 PLAN FAILED, ACCORDING TO EVIDENCE 
PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL, HINDAWI FOLLOWED INSTRUCTIONS TO 
GO TO THE SYRIAN EMBASSY, WHERE HE WAS GREETED BY THE 
AMBASSADOR AND HIDDEN IN A SYRIAN SAFEHOUSE IN LONDON. 
BRITISH PRESS REPORTS OF THE INVESTIGATION SAY BRITAIN 
ALSO HAS EVIDENCE THAT THE SYRIAN AMBASSADOR IN LONDON 
WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE 
ATTEMPTED BOMBING IN RECRUITING HINDAWI FOR SYRIAN 
INTELLIGENCE. 
 
IN WEST BERLIN, HINDAWI\'S BROTHER, AHMAD HASI, AND 
ANOTHER ARAB, FAROUK SALAMEH, WERE CONVICTED FOR THE 
MARCH 29 BOMBING OF THE GERMAN-ARAB FRIENDSHIP UNION IN 
WEST BERLIN IN WHICH ELEVEN PERSONS WERE INJURED.  IN A 
SWORN STATEMENT, HASI SAID HE PICKED UP THIS BOMB AT THE 
SYRIAN EMBASSY IN EAST BERLIN FROM A SENIOR SYRIAN AIR 
FORCE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, HAITHEM SAEED, AND A SYRIAN 
EXPLOSIVES EXPERT WAS SENT FROM DAMASCUS TO REPAIR THE 
DEVICE AFTER IT TWICE FAILED TO EXPLODE. 
 
ABU NIDAL 
 
SYRIA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE MOST ACTIVE AND BRUTAL 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUP OPERATING TODAY, ABU NIDAL. 
(SEE NOTE BELOW)  ALTHOUGH ABU NIDAL NOW ALSO RECEIVES 
BACKING AND SUPPORT FROM LIBYA, AND SANCTUARY IN EASTERN 
EUROPE, DAMASCUS HAS PROVIDED ABU NIDAL WITH IMPORTANT 
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT EVER SINCE THE GROUP MOVED FROM IRAQ 
IN 1983.  SYRIA ALLOWS ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP TO MAINTAIN 
TRAINING CAMPS IN THE LEBANESE BIQA\' VALLEY, AN AREA 
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE SYRIAN ARMED FORCES.  SYRIA 
PROVIDES THE GROUP WITH TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND PERMITS ITS 
OPERATIVES TO TRANSIT FREELY THROUGH DAMASCUS WHEN 
DEPARTING ON MISSIONS.  SYRIA CONTINUES TO PERMIT 
OPERATION OF ABU NIDAL FACILITIES IN DAMASCUS.  (THE 
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT ASSERTS THAT THE SOLE FUNCTION OF THESE 
FACILITIES IS LIMITED TO CULTURAL AND POLITICAL AFFAIRS.) 
 
ALTHOUGH LAST DECEMBER\'S ROME AIRPORT ATTACK WAS 
COMMITTED UNDER LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP, THE SURVIVING MEMBER 
OF THE FOUR-MAN TERRORIST TEAM, ACCORDING TO REPORTS ON 
THE ITALIAN INVESTIGATION, TOLD INVESTIGATORS THE TEAM 
WAS TRAINED IN SYRIAN-OCCUPIED AREAS OF LEBANON BY 
SYRIANS.  THE TEAM THEN TRAVELED TO DAMASCUS, WHERE IT 
REMAINED WHILE FINAL PREPARATIONS WERE MADE FOR THE 
ATTACK IN WHICH 16 CIVILIANS AND 3 TERRORISTS WERE 
KILLED. 
 
IN ANKARA ON NOVEMBER 6, TURKISH PROSECUTERS ISSUED AN 
INDICTMENT ACCUSING SIX PALESTINIANS WORKING FOR THE ABU 
NIDAL ORGANIZATION OF KILLING A JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN 
JULY, 1985.  THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED THE MEN WITH FOUR 
OTHER ACTIONS, INCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON 
AN ISTANBUL SYNAGOGUE, KILLING 21 PERSONS AND A 1983 
ATTEMPT TO PLACE A BOMB ON AN ALITALIA FLIGHT, AND THE 
ATTEMPTED CAR BOMBING OF A U.S. OFFICERS CLUB IN IZMIR IN 
1983. 
 
(BEGIN NOTE)  THE OFFICIAL NAME OF THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION IS \"FATAH - REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL.\"  IT IS 
HEADED BY SABRI AL-BANNA, A PALESTINIAN WHO USES THE NOM 
DE GUERRE ABU NIDAL.  THE GROUP\'S ORIGINAL NAME WAS THE 
BLACK JUNE ORGANIZATION WHEN IT WAS FORMED IN 1976. 
IRONICALLY, THIS GROUP FIRST CONCENTRATED ON SYRIAN 
TARGETS, INCLUDING AN ATTACK ON SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
KHADDAM, NOW VICE PRESIDENT, IN 1977.  (END NOTE) 
 
THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION\'S MOVE TO SYRIA IN 1983 WAS 
FOLLOWED BY A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST 
ATTACKS:  MORE THAN A DOZEN ATTACKS IN 1984 AND TWICE 
THAT NUMBER IN 1985.  MORE THAN HALF OF THE 1985 ATTACKS 
OCCURRED IN WESTERN EUROPE, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON BRITISH 
TOURISTS AT HOTELS IN ATHENS.   WHEN KING HUSSEIN 
LAUNCHED HIS FEBRUARY 1985 PEACE INITIATIVE, JORDAN 
BECAME A MAJOR TARGET.  BUT WHEN JORDANIAN-SYRIAN 
RELATIONS BEGAN TO WARM IN MID-1985, ATTACKS ON 
JORDANIANS AT HOME AND ABROAD DIMINISHED. 
 
IN ITS DEALINGS WITH WESTERN COUNTRIES, SYRIA HAS 
CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO PLAY DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS 
CONNECTION WITH ABU NIDAL AND HAS DENIED PERMITTING HIS 
GROUP TO ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  HOWEVER, THERE IS 
NO EVIDENCE THAT DAMASCUS HAS ACTUALLY RESTRAINED ABU 
NIDAL\'S ACTIVITIES (ABU NIDAL TRAINING CAMPS IN THE 
SYRIAN-CONTROLLED BIQA\' VALLEY CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR 
EXAMPLE) OR CUT BACK ON OTHER FORMS OF SUPPORT.  ALTHOUGH 
IT MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT EVERY OPERATION, GIVEN THE AMOUNT 
AND NATURE OF SYRIAN SUPPORT, DAMASCUS COULD INFLUENCE 
AND CONSTRAIN THE ABU NIDAL GROUP\'S ACTIVITIES IN SYRIA 
AND SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF LEBANON IF IT CHOSE TO DO 
SO. 
 
OTHER SYRIAN-SUPPORTED PALESTINIAN GROUPS 
 
SYRIA ALSO PROVIDES VARYING AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT TO OTHER 
RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS.  THESE INCLUDE:  SAIQA, WHICH 
IS UNDER TOTAL SYRIAN CONTROL; THE ABU MUSA GROUP, NOW 
ALMOST TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DAMASCUS; THE POPULAR FRONT 
FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE--GENERAL COMMAND 
(PFLP-GC); AND THE MARXIST POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP), WHICH NOW MAINTAINS ITS 
PRINCIPAL BASE IN DAMASCUS. 
 
IN ALL, SYRIAN-SPONSORED GROUPS, INCLUDING THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION, WERE LINKED TO ABOUT 30 TERRORIST ATTACKS 
DURING 1985, A QUARTER OF THEM IN GREECE ALONE.  THE ABU 
MUSA GROUP ANNOUNCED FROM DAMASCUS ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO BOMB AN EL AL AIRLINER, IN MADRID ON 
JUNE 26 OF THIS YEAR.  THE SUSPECT IN THAT ATTEMPT HAS 
ADMITTED BEING A MEMBER OF THE GROUP.  TWO WEEKS LATER, 
OTHER GROUPS SUPPORTED BY SYRIA, THE PFLP AND THE 
LEBANESE SYRIAN SOCIAL NATIONALIST PARTY, ATTEMPTED AN 
ATTACK ON AN ISRAELI RESORT TOWN ON JULY 10, 1986. 
 
SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS 
 
IN ADDITION TO THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS, A VARIETY 
OF OTHER TERRORISTS HAVE FACILITIES AND RECEIVED 
TERRORIST TRAINING IN SYRIA OR SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF 
LEBANON:  THE JAPANESE RED ARMY, THE KURDISH LABOR PARTY, 
THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE LIBERATION OF ARMENIA 
(ASALA), AND THE PAKISTANI AL ZULFIKAR.  IN ADDITION, THE 
LEBANESE ARMED REVOLUTIONARY FACTION (LARF) IS BASED IN 
THE LEBANESE VILLAGE OF QUBAYAT, WITHIN THE AREA OF 
SYRIAN CONTROL IN LEBANON. 
 
TO THESE GROUPS MUST BE ADDED THE INDIVIDUAL 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS WHO FREQUENT DAMASCUS.   BRUNO 
BREGUET, AN ASSOCIATE OF CARLOS, THE INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST, WAS ARRESTED IN PARIS IN FEBRUARY 1982 FOR 
TRANSPORTING ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES.  LATER RELEASED, HE WAS 
RECENTLY SIGHTED ON A FLIGHT TO DAMASCUS, MET ON ARRIVAL 
BY SYRIAN AUTHORITIES, AND ESCORTED THROUGH THE AIRPORT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO PASS THROUGH THE NORMAL CONTROLS. 
EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT FREDERIC ORIACH, A MILITANT MEMBER 
OF THE  FRENCH ACTION DIRECT, SPENT JULY AND AUGUST 1986 
IN DAMASCUS PURSUING IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY STUDIES. 
 
CASUALTIES AND CONTROL 
 
ATTACKS BY SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS SINCE 1983 HAVE KILLED 
OR WOUNDED NEARLY 500 PEOPLE. 
 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS HAVE ATTACKED U.S. FACILITIES IN 
THE MIDDLE EAST OVER 10 TIMES SINCE 1983.  IN JORDAN LAST 
YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SYRIAN-SPONSORED JORDANIAN PEOPLES 
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY ATTEMPTED TWO ANTI-U.S. ATTACKS. 
BOMBS WERE FOUND AT A USAID EMPLOYEE\'S HOME AND AT THE 
AMERICAN CENTER FOR ORIENTAL STUDIES.  THESE OPERATIONS, 
AS WELL AS OTHERS AIMED AGAINST JORDANIAN TARGETS, HAVE 
HALTED SINCE THE SYRIAN-JORDANIAN RAPPROCHEMENT LATE LAST 
YEAR--UNDERSCORING SYRIA\'S ABILITY, IF IT WISHES, TO 
CONTROL ITS SURROGATES\' ACTIVITIES AND TO SEVERELY CURB 
THE CAPABILITY OF THOSE TO WHOM IT PROVIDED SAFE HAVEN 
AND SUPPORT. 
 
THIS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY A TOP SYRIAN OFFICIAL WHO 
TRIED TO DISMISS, IN A WASHINGTON POST PRESS INTERV1EW 
THIS SEPTEMBER, EVIDENCE THAT ABU NIDAL\'S GROUP WAS 
INVOLVED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS.  SYRIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
FAROUK CHARAA SAID IN DISCUSSING THE ACTIONS OF THE ABU 
NIDAL GROUP:  \"WHOEVER KNOWS MY GOVERNMENT MUST REALIZE 
THAT SUCH ATTACKS COULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT ITS 
AWARENESS.\"  (END TEXT OF FACT PAPER.) 
 
3.  (BEGIN TEXT OF CHRONOLOGY) 
 
CHRONOLOGY OF SELECTED TERRORIST INCIDENTS BY 
SYRIAN-SUPPORTED GROUPS:  1983-1986 
 
 THE FOLLOWING LIST OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS IS NOT 
INTENDED TO BE ALL-INCLUSIVE BUT IS ILLUSTRATIVE OF 
SYRIA\'S INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM AND 
TERRORIST GROUPS.  THE GROUPS CITED HERE HAVE LINKS WITH 
SYRIA. 
 
1986 
 
26 NOVEMBER WEST BERLIN.  A COURT CONVICTED TWO ARABS FOR 
        THE MARCH 29 BOMBING OF THE GERMAN-ARAB 
        FRIENDSHIP UNION WHICH INJURED 11 PERSONS.  IN 
        A SWORN STATEMENT ONE OF THE DEFENDENTS, AHMAD 
        HASI, SAID HE PICKED UP THE BOMB AT THE SYRIAN 
        EMBASSY IN EAST BERLIN FROM A SYRIAN AIR FORCE 
        INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.  HASI IS A BROTHER OF 
        NIZAR HINDAWI, WHO WAS CONVICTED IN A BRITISH 
        COURT FOR THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING OF AN EL AL 
        AIRLINER. 
 
6 NOVEMBER  TURKEY.  TURKISH PROSECUTORS ISSUED AN 
        INDICTMENT ACCUSING SIX PALESTINIANS WORKING 
        FOR THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION OF KILLING A 
        JORDANIAN DIPLOMAT IN JULY 1985.  AN ARREST 
        WARRANT ALSO WAS ISSUED FOR THE SYRIAN EMBASSY 
        SECOND SECRETARY, MOHAMMED DARWICHI, WHO WAS 
        ONE OF THE ORIGINAL DEFENDENTS AND LEFT 
        TURKEY.  THE INDICTMENT ALSO LINKED MEMBERS OF 
        THE GROUP WITH FOUR OTHER ACTIONS:  THE 
        SEPTEMBER 6, 1986 ATTACK ON AN ISTANBUL 
        SYNAGOGUE, WHICH KILLED 22 PERSONS; AN ATTEMPT 
        TO PLACE A BOMB ON AN ALITALIA FLIGHT IN 1983; 
        THE ATTEMPTED CAR BOMBING OF A U.S. OFFICERS\' 
        CLUB IN IZMIR IN 1983, AND THE KILLING OF A 
        PALESTINIAN STUDENT IN ANKARA IN 1982. 
 
26 JUNE     MADRID.  A SPANIARD ATTEMPTED TO BOARD AN EL 
       AL FLIGHT WITH A SUITCASE BOMB, APPARENTLY 
       WITHOUT KNOWING IT.  THE SUSPECT ARRESTED BY 
       SPANISH POLICE CARRIED A SYRIAN PASSPORT.  A 
       SPOKESMAN FOR THE ABU MUSA GROUP, WHICH IS 
       ALMOST TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON DAMASCUS, CLAIMED 
       RESPONSIBILITY FOR PLANTING THE BOMB, ALTHOUGH 
       THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT DENIED INVOLVEMENT. 
 
17 APRIL  LONDON.  EL AL SECURITY DISCOVERED A SYRIAN-MADE 
      BOMB IN THE LUGGAGE OF AN IRISH WOMAN AS SHE 
      ATTEMPTED TO BOARD A PLANE FOR TEL AVIV.  A 
      BRITISH COURT FOUND HER BOYFRIEND, NIZAR 
      HINDAWI, GUILTY OF THE ATTEMPTED BOMBING, AND 
      THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD 
      CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF SYRIAN OFFICIAL 
      INVOLVEMENT IN THE TERRORIST ACT. 
 
2 MARCH   WEST BANK.  TWO GUNMEN ASSASSINATED THE MAYOR OF 
      NABLUS, ZAFER AL-MASRI, A PALESTINIAN APPOINTED 
      BY ISRAEL.  BOTH THE ABU NIDAL GROUP AND THE 
      POPULAR FRONT FOR LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
      CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY. 
 
1985 
 
27 DEC.   ROME AND VIENNA.  ABU NIDAL TERRORISTS 
      SIMULTANEOUSLY ATTACKED EL AL TICKET COUNTERS IN 
      THE ROME AND VIENNA AIRPORTS, KILLING MORE THAN 
      20 PEOPLE, INCLUDING FIVE AMERICANS, AND 
      WOUNDING SOME 120 OTHERS.  (ALTHOUGH THESE 
      ATTACKS WERE COMMITTED UNDER LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP, 
      REPORTS ON THE ITALIAN INVESTIGATION INDICATE 
      THAT THE ROME TERRORIST TEAM RECEIVED TRAINING 
      IN SYRIAN-CONTROLLED AREAS OF LEBANON AND PASSED 
      THROUGH DAMASCUS.) 
 
30 SEPT.  NETHERLANDS.  A SMALL BOMB DAMAGED THE EL AL

1.  WE ARE NOW AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO RAFSANJANI 
STATEMENTS, ASSERTING LINKAGE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN 
HOSTAGES IN LEBANON AND THE DISPOSITION OF IRANIAN 
ASSETS, THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THE PRESS SINCE THE APRIL 
3 U.S. LETTER TO BOCKSTIEGEL:  THE INTERVIEW BY A 
CORRESPONDENT FROM KEVAN HAVA\'I; AND THE RAFSANJANI 
PRESS CONFERENCE REPORTED BY IRNA ON APRIL 20.  AS NEAR 
AS WE CAN TELL, THE LATTER PRESS CONFERENCE IS PROBABLY 
THE SOURCE FOR THE ARTICLES IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND 
THE HERALD-TRIBUNE.  (YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE RECEIVED 
THESE STATEMENTS BY DATAFAX.) 
 
2.  THIS PERSISTENT REPETITION BY RAFSANJANI OF THE 
HOSTAGE THEME MAKES IT NECESSARY FOR US AGAIN TO PUT ON 
RECORD WITH THE TRIBUNAL THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF SUCH 
STATEMENTS, AND THE NECESSITY FOR THE TRIBUNAL TO 
ADDRESS THE HOSTAGE ISSUE ADEQUATELY IN ITS FINAL 
ORDER.  THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING TO 
THE TRIBUNAL, IN WHATEVER WRITTEN FORM YOU JUDGE MOST 
APPROPRIATE. 
 
3.  BEGIN TEXT.  THE UNITED STATES REGRETS THAT IT IS 
AGAIN NECESSARY TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE TRIBUNAL 
TO FURTHER PUBLIC STATEMENTS ISSUED BY A HIGH-LEVEL 
OFFICIAL OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH CLEARLY 
SUGGEST THAT IRAN WILL WITHHOLD ITS ASSISTANCE IN 
SECURING THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES IN LEBANON 
UNTIL THE RELEASE TO IRAN OF ASSETS WHICH ARE THE 
SUBJECT OF VARIOUS TRIBUNAL PROCEEDINGS.  THESE 
STATEMENTS (COPIES ATTACHED) WERE MADE BY MAJLIS 
SPEAKER RAFSANJANI AND APPEARED IN THE PRESS DURING THE 
MONTH OF APRIL, MAKING A TOTAL OF AT LEAST THREE SUCH 
STATEMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE LATEST ASSURANCES OF THE 
GOVERNMENT OF IRAN THAT NO SUCH LINKAGE TO THE ILLEGAL 
DETENTION OF HOSTAGES EXISTS. 
 
THE REPEATED REITERATION OF SUCH STATEMENTS BY 
HIGH-LEVEL IRANIAN OFFICIALS POINTS EVEN MORE STRONGLY 
TO THE CLEAR NEED FOR THE GRANTING OF THE RELIEF 
REQUESTED IN THIS REGARD BY THE UNITED STATES IN ITS 
SUBMISSION OF 19 MARCH.  SUCH LINKAGE IS UNACCEPTABLE 
TO THE UNITED STATES AND, WE BELIEVE, IS AN AFFRONT TO 
THE TRIBUNAL AS WELL.  END TEXT.

SUBJECT:       U.S. PLANS ARMS SALE TO SAUDIS 
 
1.  TEXT OF MAY 16 WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE \"U.S. PLANS 
ARMS SALE TO SAUDIS, WHITE HOUSE TO NOTIFY CONGRESS OF 
$500 MILLION DEAL\" BY BARRY SCHWEID OF THE ASSOCIATED 
PRESS FOLLOWS. 
 
2.  BEGIN TEXT: 
 
3.  IN A MOVE CERTAIN TO TOUCH OFF HEATED DEBATE, THE 
WHITE HOUSE WILL NOTIFY CONGRESS NEXT WEEK THAT IT 
INTENDS TO SELL $500 MILLION WORTH OF F15 FIGHTER PLANES 
TO SAUDI ARABIA, REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESSIONAL 
SOURCES SAID YESTERDAY. 
 
CONGRESS, WHICH HAS THE AUTHORITY TO VETO THE PURCHASE, 
IS LKELY TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE PLAN IN LIGHT OF 
REPORTS THAT THE SAUDIS SECRETLY PROVIDED FINANCIAL HELP 
TO THE NICARAGUAN CONTRAS. 
 
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT SOURCES CLOSE 
TO THE SAUDIS ESTIMATE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONTRAS 
AT $23 MILLION IN 1984-85.  SOME MEMBERS OF THE 
 
CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES INVESTIGATING THE IRAN-CONTRA 
AFFAIR HAVE ESTIMATED SAUDI CONTRIBUTIONS TO HAVE BEEN AS 
HIGH AS $32.5 MILLION. 
 
ISRAEL\'S SUPPORTERS, MEANWHILE, ARE BOUND TO CHALLENGE 
THE DEAL AS POSING A POTENTIAL MILITARY DANGER. 
 
THE SOURCES, WHO DEMANDED ANONYMITY, SAID THE PLANES--12 
TO 15, DEPENDING ON ULTIMATE PRODUCTION COSTS--WOULD BE 
KEPT IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDED TO THE ARAB 
KINGDOM ONLY TO REPLACE JETS LOST IN ACCIDENTS. 
 
\"IT IS UNDER ACTIVE CONSIDERATION AS ATTRITION 
REPLACEMENTS,\" ONE OFFICIAL SAID. 
 
AFTER BITTER DEBATE IN CONGRESS, THE CARTER 
ADMINISTRATION IN 1978 WON APPROVAL FOR THE SALE OF 62 
JETS TO THE SAUDIS. 
 
FOUR OR FIVE PLANES HAVE SINCE BEEN LOST IN ACCIDENTS, 
AND THE UNITED STATES WANTS TO KEEP THE LEVEL UP TO 60, 
AN OFFICIA1 SAID. 
 
CONGRESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THIS WEEK.  BUT THE 
PLAN WAS \"SHORT-CIRCUITED\" BY THE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS 
ON THE IRAN-CONTRA AFFAIR, THE SOURCES SAID. 
 
SAUDI AID TO THE CONTRAS CAME AT A CRITICAL PERIOD WHEN 
CONGRESS HAD PROHIBITED U.S. MILITARY ASISTANCE TO THE 
REBELS. 
 
IN THE PERIOD, THE ADMINITRATION SHIPPED 400 STINGER 
ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES TO SAUDI ARABIA AND ALSO SAID IT 
WAS CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL TO SELL $12 BILLION IN 
ADDITIONAL ARMS TO THE OIL-RICH KINGDOM. 
 
WHILE CONGRESS WAS UNAWARE OF THE SECRET CONTRA AID, 
OPPONENTS THREATENED TO REJECT THE PURCHASES--AND WITH 
ENOUGH VOTES TO OVERRIDE A VETO BY PRESIDENT REAGAN. 
 
HE SCALED DOWN THE DEAL, BUT THE SAUDIS WITHDREW THE 
ENTIRE PACKAGE. 
 
THEIR NEW REQUEST INCLUDES BOTH F15C AND F15D JETS, WHICH 
ARE PRODUCED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP.  THE SAUDIS 
INITIALLY BOUGHT 47 F15CS AND 15 F15DS. 
 
MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IS DUE TO END PRODUCTION OF BOTH TYPES 
OF AIRPLANES IN MAY 1988.  IT WILL TURN OUT THE MORE 
 
POTENT F15E, WHICH AN OFFICAL DESCIBED AS A \"STRIKE 
AIRCRAFT\" THAT THE ADMINISTRAT1ON WOULD NOT SELL TO THE 
SAUDIS AND CONGRESS WOULD NOT APPROVE. 
 
THE OFFICIAL, WHO DECLINED TO BE IDENTIFIED, ESTIMATED 
THAT IT WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS TO MANUFACTURE THE FIRST 
OF THE REPLACEMENT JETS. 
 
THE FIRST GROUP OF FOUR OR FIVE-,OR MORE IF OTHER 
EXISTING PLANES ARE LOST--WOULD BE SENT TO SAUDI ARABIA 
THEN, WHILE THE OTHERS WOULD BE KEPT IN THE UNITED STATES 
TO BE SUPPLIED AS NEEDED.

SUBJECT: AIDS TESTING OF VISITING U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL 
 
1.  PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS OF HOST NATIONS HAVE RESULTED 
IN OCCASIONAL REQUESTS THAT VISITING MILITARY UNITS 
DEMONSTRATE THAT UNIT PERSONNEL ARE FREE OF AIDS VIRUS. 
THIS MESSAGE PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR RESPONDING TO 
EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN, OFFICIAL ACTION, OR OTHER EFFORTS 
BY HOST NATIONS TO CONDITION U.S. MILITARY VISITS ON AIDS 
TESTING. 
 
2.  IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS CONCERNING COMMUNICABLE 
DISEASES ON VISITING U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND U.S. MILITARY 
AIRCRAFT, A HOST GOVERNMENT CAN BE INFORMED THAT: 
 
A.  A COMMANDING OFFICER OF A U.S. NAVY SHIP OR U.S. 
MILITARY AIRCRAFT IS REQUIRED TO REPORT AT ONCE TO LOCAL 
HEALTH AUTHORITIES ANY CONDITION ABOARD HIS SHIP OR 
AIRCRAFT WHICH PRESENTS A HAZARD OF INTRODUCTION OF A 
COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OUTSIDE THE SHIP OR AIRCRAFT.  THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER, IF REQUESTED, WILL CERTIFY THAT THERE 
ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL ENTERING THE 
HOST NATION FROM HIS SHIP OR AIRCRAFT WILL PRESENT SUCH A 
HAZARD. 
 
B.  CONCEALMENT OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MIGHT 
SUBJECT A U.S. NAVY SHIP OR MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO 
QUARANTINE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED UNDER DOD REGULATIONS. 
ANY U.S. NAVAL OFFICER ENGAGING IN SUCH CONCEALMENT WOULD 
BE LIABLE TO COURT MARTIAL. 
 
3.  IF ASKED WHAT THE U.S. IS DOING TO PREVENT THE SPREAD 
OF AIDS BY U.S. SERVICE PERSONNEL, THE FOLLOWING 
STATEMENT MAY BE GIVEN TO THE HOST COUNTRY: 
 
QUOTE  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE POLICY REQUIRES 
ALL MILITARY PERSONNEL TO BE SCREENED FOR SEROLOGICAL 
EVIDENCE OF HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) 
INFECTION.  THOSE WITH POSITIVE SEROLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF 
HIV INFECTION ARE ASSIGNED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.  IN 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS POLICY, U.S. NAVY AND MARINE 
PERSONNEL DEPLOYING OVERSEAS IN U.S. NAVY SHIPS AND OTHER 
MILITARY PERSONNEL ENROUTE TO PERMANENT OVERSEAS DUTY ARE 
TESTED PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT.  UNQUOTE. 
 
4.  THE UNITED STATES VIEWS NAVY SHIPS AND MILITARY 
AIRCRAFT AS SOVEREIGN.  THEREFORE THE U.S. WILL REFUSE 
REQUESTS TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS, TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC 
INFORMATION ON INDIVIDUAL CREW MEMBERS, AND TO UNDERTAKE 
OTHER REQUESTED ACTIONS SINCE THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 
COMMANDING OFFICER IS DEFINITIVE.  FOR SECURITY AND OTHER 
REASONS, THE U.S. DOES NOT RELEASE FOR ANY REASON 
DETAILED LISTS OF PERSONNEL EMBARKED IN U.S. NAVY SHIPS 
OR MILITARY AIRCRAFT VISITING FOREIGN PORTS. 
 
5.  FYI:  IN USING THE ABOVE GUIDANCE AND ADDRESSING HOST 
NATION QUERIES, POSTS SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO AND RESIST 
MEASURES WHICH DISCRIMINATE AGAINST U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL OR UNITS.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE: 
 
A.  REQUIRING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT U.S. MILITARY 
PERSONNEL THAN VISITING MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
 
B.  TREATING U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL AS HIGHER RISK 
GROUP THAN MERCHANT SEAMEN, VISITING COMMERCIAL AIRCREWS, 
ETC.

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, 
 
I GREATLY APPRECIATE RECEIVING YOUR KIND NOTE 
CONGRATULATING ME ON THE SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT WITH SOVIET 
GENERAL SECRETARY GORBACHEV.  WE BELIEVE THOSE MEETINGS 
INDEED MARK A HISTORIC MOMENT IN ADVANCING INTERNATIONAL 
SECURITY, AS WELL AS IN ESTABLISHING A MORE STABLE AND

SIGNED WITH THE GENERAL SECRETARY IS CLEARLY A LANDMARK

NATIONS HAVE AGREED TO REDUCE OUR NUCLEAR ARSENALS, NOT 
JUST LIMIT THEIR GROWTH.  AND THERE IS THE PROMISE OF 
STILL GREATER PROGRESS IN PLACING EAST-WEST RELATIONS ON 
A SOUNDER FOOTING. 
 
MY TALKS WITH GORBACHEV WERE QUITE FRANK AND CANDID -- 
NEITHER OF US ATTEMPTED TO MASK OUR DISAGREEMENTS.  THE 
GENERAL SECRETARY UNDERSTANDS THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR 
RELATIONSHIP CAN RESULT ONLY IF WE SERIOUSLY ADDRESS THE 
ENTIRE FOUR-PART AGENDA: HUMAN RIGHTS, REGIONAL CONCERNS, 
BILATERAL MATTERS AND ARMS REDUCTIONS.  WE HAD A FRANK 
AND VERY LIVELY EXCHANGE ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES, AND 
WHILE WE DID NOT MAKE BREAKTHROUGHS IN EVERY AREA, I AM 
ENCOURAGED BY THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH GORBACHEV IS 
CONSIDERING OUR POINT OF VIEW. 
 
BEST WISHES FOR A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

SUBJECT: LIBYA: THE VIEW FROM QADHAFI\'S BACK PORCH 
 
1.  C - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF STATE 14270 TO CAIRO (DATED 
JANUARY 16, 1988) REPEATED FOR YOUR INFO.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
3.  QADHAFI IS MAKING SOLID GAINS IN THE MAGHREB.  HIS 
RAPPROCHMENT WITH ALGERIA IS BEARING FRUIT--THOUGH NOT YET 
THE FULL-BLOWN UNION HE IS SEEKING.  THE PROCESSION OF CHAD 
DEFEATS HAS ENDED; AND HE IS SLOWLY STRENGTHENING HIS LINKS 
WITH NEIGHBORING AFRICAN STATES.  AS A RESULT, HIS 
SELF-CONFIDENCE IS RISING, AND WE EXPECT HIM GRADUALLY TO 
SHIFT TO A HIGHER PROFILE STANCE IN COMING MONTHS. 
 
---------------------- 
MAGHREB THE JEWEL IN THE GROWN? 
----------------------- 
4.  (C)  QADHAFI CONTINUES TO DIGEST THE LESSONS HE LEARNED 
FROM OUR AIRSTRIKE IN 1986.  HE CANNOT COUNT ON OUTSIDE 
SUPPORT IF HE GETS IN DIFFICULTY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN TO OUT 
OF STEP WITH HIS FELLOW ARABS.  TO REMEDY THIS WEAKNESS IN 
HIS POSITION, HE HAS BEEN EAGERLY RESPONDING TO ALGERIAN 
OVERTURES FOR HALF A YEAR.  WHILE HE HAS ON OCCASION 
STARTLED THE ALGERIANS WITH TOO AVID A COURTSHIP--HE HAS 
SETTLED INTO MORE DURABLE STEPBY-STEP MILITARY, BUSINESS 
AND \"PARLIAMENTARY\" EXCHANGES.  HE HAS MET ALGERIA\'S 
INSISTENCE THAT HE RENEW RELATIONS WITH TUNISIA.  HE MAY 
EVEN HAVE ARRESTED THE EROSION OF RELATIONS WITH MOROCCO BY 
MONEY AS WELL AS WORDS CRITICAL OF THE POLISARIO. 
 
------------\"--------- 
FRIENDSHIP ON THE DOTTED LINE 
---------\"------------- 
 
5.  (C)  IF QADHAFI ACCEDES TO ALGERIA\'S SECOND 
CONDITION\"LIBYAN MEMBERSHIP IN THE TRIPARTITE ACCORD OF 
1983 WHICH ENSURED (PAPER) CORDIALITY BETWEEN ALGERIA, 
MAURITANIA, AND TUNISIA--HE WILL GET APPLAUSE FROM LIBYANS 
AND , THAT MOST ELUSIVE OF GOALS, LEGITIMACY IN THE 
REGION.  QADHAFI LOVES SIGNED STATEMENTS OF FRIENDSHIP, 
ALMOST AS MUCH AS \"UNION\" PACTS; HE WILL ACCEPT HALF A LOAF 
BY JOINING THE MAGHREB CLUB, RELISHING ITS PROPAGANDA VALUE. 
 
6.  (C) HE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY EXPLOIT HIS NEW ROLE TO TAUNT 
THE US, WHICH GIVES HIM CLOUT WITH SOME ARABS WHILE 
DISMAYING HIS OLD ENEMY, EGYPT.  HE WILL CERTAINLY USE THE 
RELAXATION OF VISA RESTRICTIONS FOR ITS INTELLIGENCE VALUE 
OF HAVING UNDERCLARED AGENTS ON THE GROUND IN TUNIS, 
NOUAKCHOTT, AND ALGIERS.  ECONOMICALLY, HE MAY SUGGEST 
\"JOINT VENTURES\" WITH HIS NEWFOUND PARTNERS, WHICH COULD 
AFFECT CURRENT US BUSINESS VENTURES WITH MAGHREB STATES, OR 
GIVE HIM ACCESS TO US TECHNOLOGY.  EVERYONE ELSE IN THE 
ACCORD IS CASH-POOR AND OPEN TO LIBYAN LARGESSE.  QADHAFI 
MAY ALSO BE LOOKING AT SECURITY IMPLICATION, I.E. TURNING 
ANY FUTURE US THREATS OF HOSTILE ACTION AGAINST HIM INTO 
\"THREATS AGAINST THE ACCORD\" 
 
-------------------------- 
QUIET ALONG THE SOUTHERN FLANK 
-------------------- 
 
7.  (C) MEANWHILE, QADHAFI\'S DIPLOMATS ARE PLAYING A 
WAITING GAME WITH THE OAU ON CHAD.  THE LONGER THE 
NEGOTIATIONS OVER WHO OWNS HOZOU ARE DRAGGED OUT, THE 
FIRMER ARE LIBYAN SOUTHERN DEFENCES AGAINST HABRE\'S 
WARRIORS.  LIBYAN ENVOYS TO NIGER HAVE PROMISED TO MAKE 
GOOD SOME 1973 URANIUM DEBTS, PROBABLY IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
FACILITATE ACCESS TO THE CHADIAN FRONT.  LIKEWISE IN SUDAN, 
QADHAFI CONTINUES TO PLY SADIQ-AL-MAHDI WITH GOODIE BAGS OF 
ARMS, MEDICINE, AND AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT--MEANWHILE 
CONTINUING TO SEND LIBYANBACKED MERCENARIES IN THE 
TRACKLESS CORNER OF SUDAN NEAR CHAD.  IN UGANDA, QADHAFI 
EXPLOITS A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MUSEVENI, KEEPING 
MILITARY HARDWARE AND TRAINING FLOWING--OR DID UNTIL LAST 
WEEK WHEN SOME UGANDANS, UPSET ABOUT TOO CLOSE AN EMBRACE, 
KILLED A LIBYAN OPERATIVE.  END TEXT.

SUBJECT:    IRAQI MISSILE ATTACKS ON TEHRAN 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  FOLLOWING IS A SPOT INTELLIGENCE REPORT ISSUED BY INR 
WITH INFORMATION AS OF 0900 EDT 1 MARCH 1988: 
 
3.  IRAQ HAS ANNOUNCED A TOTAL OF 13 MISSILE STRIKES 
AGAINST TEHRAN SINCE THE AFTERNOON OF FEBRUARY 29. 
SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE CONFIRMS AT LEAST TEN OF THE 
FIRINGS, AT LEAST THREE WERE TRACKED TO TEHRAN.  INITIAL 
PRESS REPORTS INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL CASUALTIES. 
 
4.  THESE ATTACKS WERE PROMPTED BY IRANIAN FIRING OF 
THREE SCUD MISSILES AT BAGHDAD THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 
28-29, WHICH IN TURN WAS RETALIATION FOR AN IRAQI AIR 
STRIKE ON THE REY OIL REFINERY IN TEHRAN\'S SUBURBS 
FEBRUARY 27. 
 
5.  OUR BEST GUESS, BASED ON EARLIER REPORTS OF IRAQI 
EXPERIMENTATION, IS THAT IRAQ IS FIRING REDUCED-PAYLOAD 
SCUD MISSILES.  THE ORDINARY SCUD CAN ONLY REACH HALFWAY 
TO TEHRAN, BUT THE IRAQIS WERE CLAIMING TO HAVE DOUBLED 
THE MISSILE\'S RANGE TO OVER 600 KM., WHICH WOULD JUST 
MAKE IT TO TEHRAN FROM THE KNOWN LAUNCHING AREA NEAR 
AL-AMARA.  IRAQ IS CREDITED WITH OVER 140 SOVIET-ORIGIN 
SCUD SURFACE-TO-SURFACE MISSILES. 
 
6.  BOTH SIDES APPEAR TO HAVE DECIDED THAT US EFFORTS TO 
OBTAIN A RESOLUTION TO ENFORCE UNSC RES. 598 AGAINST IRAN 
HAVE STALLED.  THUS, THE RESTRAINT SHOWN BY IRAN AND IRAQ 
UNTIL RECENTLY WILL INCREASLINGLY FRAY.  IRAN IS LIKELY 
TO RESPOND WITH FURTHER SCUD ATTACKS AGAINST BAGHDAD AND 
ARTILLERY SHELLING OF IRAQI BORDER CITIES.  THE IRANIANS 
ARE ALSO LIKELY TO LAUNCH ONE OR MORE MAJOR GROUND 
ATTACKS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  WITH THE APPROACH OF THE FORMAL CEASE-FIRE BETWEEN 
IRAN AND IRAQ ON AUGUST 20, SOME ARE SUGGESTING THAT THE 
U.S. HAS ALREADY DECIDED TO BEGIN SOON TO REDUCE ITS 
NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF.  RECENT STORIES IN THE U.S. 
PRESS HAVE FUELED THIS SPECULATION.  AS APPROPRIATE, 
POSTS SHOULD USE THE TALKING POINTS PROVIDED BELOW TO 
BRIEF THEIR HOST GOVERNMENTS (ESPECIALLY GCC STATES, 
EUROPEAN ALLIES WITH A NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF, AND 
IRAQ) ON U.S. POLICY. 
 
3.  TALKING POINTS: 
 
--WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED 
SETTLEMENT TO THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR.  WE ARE PLEASED WITH GCC 
AND ALLIED COOPERATION AND BELIEVE IT WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN 
THE POSITIVE RESULTS OF OUR MUTUAL EFFORTS--THE 
CEASE-FIRE AND PROGRESS TOWARD FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF 598. 
 
--WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT OUR FORCE 
AUGMENTATION AND THAT OF OUR ALLIES WAS DIRECTLY RELATED 
TO THE THREAT POSED TO OUR SHIPPING, AND TO THE SECURITY 
AND STABILITY OF OUR FRIENDS IN THE REGION.  WE HAVE ALSO 
CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THAT, SHOULD THE THREAT ABATE, WE 
ARE PREPARED TO REVIEW AND, AS APPROPRIATE, TO REDUCE OUR 
NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS IN THE REGION. 
 
--GIVEN THE CLOSE COOPERATIVE AND SUPPORTIVE NATURE OF 
OUR PRESENCE, THAT OF OUR ALLIES, AND OUR FRIENDS IN THE 
GULF, WE WILL ONLY DO SO AFTER CONSULTING CLOSELY WITH 
THE GCC STATES AND AFTER COORDINATING WITH OUR EUROPEAN 
ALLIES.  WE WILL NOT TAKE PREEMPTIVE OR UNILATERAL 
ACTIONS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT WITH YOU AS WE 
ASSESS THE SITUATION IN VIEW OF THE IMMINENT CEASE-FIRE. 
 
--AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE, THE U.S. HAS HAD A NAVAL 
PRESENCE IN THE PERSIAN GULF FOR OVER FORTY YEARS.  THAT 
PRESENCE CLEARLY PRE-DATES THE GULF WAR; WE INTEND TO 
MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE NAVAL PRESENCE, EVEN AFTER THE 
PROBLEMS BETWEEN IRAN AND IRAQ ARE RESOLVED. 
 
--THE U.S. INTENDS TO STAY THE COURSE IN THE GULF.  OUR 
POLICY REFLECTS OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AS WE HAVE DEFINED 
THEM OVER MORE THAN EIGHT ADMINISTRATIONS.  IT HAS STRONG 
BIPARTISAN AND PUBLIC SUPPORT. 
 
(END TALKING POINTS) 
 
4.  FYI ONLY:  THE SIZE AND STRUCTURE OF OUR AUGMENTED 
NAVAL FORCES WILL REMAIN COMMENSURATE WITH THE THREAT. 
AS THAT THREAT DIMINISHES, WE WILL REDUCE THE FORCE AS 
APPROPRIATE.  THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ADVISE WHEN 
FORCE LEVEL CHANGES ARE ANTICIPATED IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE 
EMBASSIES TO CONSULT WITH THE STATES OF THE REGION AND 
OUR ALLIES.  END FYI. YYY

LTTE APPEARS TO BE TAKING ISSUE WITH A DEFENSE DEPARTMENT

IN PARAGRAPH 5, AND LETTER\'S TEXT IS PROVIDED IN 
PARAGRAPH 6.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (LOU) NEA ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY PAUL HARE,

OF ANALYSIS FOR NEAR EAST AND SOUTH ASIA GEORGE HARRIS, 
AND FORMER S/CT HEAD L. PAUL BREMER EACH RECEIVED 
IDENTICAL LETTERS LAST WEEK ALLEGEDLY FROM THE LIBERATION

BEEN WRITTEN ON A COMPUTER WITH ONLY THE ADDRESSEES 
ALTERED ON EACH, DATED MARCH 11, AND WERE MAILED FROM 
CANADA.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUPPOSED AUTHOR 
OF THE LETTER, \"S. NATHAN\", WHO IS 
IDENTIFIED ONLY AS \"FOR POLITICAL COMMITTEE\". 
NONETHELESS, WE HAVE NO REASON TO DOUBT THE LETTERS\' 
AUTHENTICITY, WHICH WERE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH ON TAMIL AND 
ENGLISH LTTE LETTERHEAD. 
 
3.  (C) THE LETTER PROTESTS THE INCLUSION OF THE LTTE IN 
A US GOVERNMENT PUBLICATION \"TERRORIST GROUP PROFILES.\" 
PRESUMABLY, THE LTTE LETTER IS REFERRING TO THE DEFENSE 
DEPARTMENT REPORT ON GROUPS INVOLVED IN TERRORISM ISSUED 
RECENTLY, WHICH DESCRIBES THE LTTE, ALONG WITH SOME FIFTY 
OTHER GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE LETTER ALSO 
REQUESTS U.S. MEDIATION ON BEHALF OF SRI LANKA\'S TAMILS, 
AND STATES THE WILLINGNESS OF THE LTTE TO MEET WITH 
AMERICAN DIPLOMATS.  WHILE THE LTTE DENIES THAT IT IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR TERRORIST CRIMES AND ALLEGES THAT IT IS 
THE VICTIM OF SRI LANKAN AND INDIAN PROPAGANDA, THE TONE 
OF THE LETTER IS NEITHER THREATENING NOR INTIMIDATING. 
 
4.  (C) A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY OF SRI LANKA WATCHERS IN 
WASHINGTON REVEALS THAT THESE FOUR LETTERS ARE THE ONLY 
ONES RECEIVED SO FAR.  WHILE THE LTTE WAS SAVVY ENOUGH TO 
DIRECT ITS APPEAL TO THE APPROPRIATE SENIOR OFFICERS IN 
THE DEPARTMENT, TO DATE NO LETTER HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY 
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, WHICH AUTHORED THE REPORT.  MORE 
LTTE CORRESPONDENCE MAY SOON BE RECEIVED, HOWEVER, SINCE 
THE LETTERS HAVE NOT ARRIVED ALL AT ONCE. 
 
5.  (C) ACTION REQUESTED:  WE WOULD APPRECIATE WORD FROM 
ADDRESSEES REGARDING ANY CORRESPONDENCE OR COMMUNICATIONS 
FROM THE LTTE REGARDING THE REPORT.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE 
ANY INFORMATION ON ANY LTTE REQUESTS FOR AMERICAN 
MEDIATION EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE TAMILS.  WE WOULD ALSO 
WELCOME ANY INFORMATION OTTAWA MAY HAVE REGARDING THE 
EXILE ACTIVITIES OF TAMIL GROUPS, AND OF THE SIGNATORY OF 
THE LETTER. 
 
6.  (LOU) TEXT OF LETTER.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
SIR, 
 
RE: TERRORIST GROUP PROFILES 
 
WE WISH TO CONTRADICT STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ABOVE 
PUBLICATION RELATING TO OUR ORGANIZATION, \"THE LIBERATION 
TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM\". 
 
IN THE FIRST PLACE, WE ARE NOT A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
WE ARE A MOVEMENT WHICH SEEKS THE RIGHT OF 
SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE TAMILS OF SRI LANKA, THE SAME 
RIGHT WHICH PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON OF YOUR COUNTRY 
PROPOUNDED AFTER WORLD WAR I.  PLEASE THERFORE VIEW US AS 
AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO THE INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS 
AND THE ALL-INDIA MUSLIM LEAGUE AS WELL AS THE MOVEMENT 
LED BY THE FATHER OF BANGLADESH, THE LATE SHEIKH MUJIBUR 
RAHMAN. 
 
SECONDLY, WE ARE AN ORGANIZATION WHICH ENDEAVOURS TO 
PROTECT THE TAMILS FROM THE GENOCIDAL ATTACKS OF THE SRI 
LANKAN STATE ON THE ONE HAND AND THE BRUTAL 
HEAVY-HANDEDNESS OF THE INDIAN PEACE KEEPING FORCE ON THE 
OTHER.  IN FACT, INDIAN \'PEACEKEEPERS\' HAVE BEEN INDICTED 
UNDER THE INDIAN PENAL CODE FOR CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE, 
LOOTING AND KILLING OF OUR INNOCENT TAMIL CIVILIANS. 
 
THIRDLY, WE LIKE TO INVITE YOUR ATTENTION TO A STATEMENT 
MADE BY MR. ROBERT PECK (ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 
SOUTH ASIA) THAT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY THE SRI 
LANKA STATE AND TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS ARE TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT, THE SRI LANKA STATE HAS COMMITTED GREATER 
VIOLATIONS THAN ALL THE TAMIL MILITANT GROUPS PUT 
TOGETHER DID. 
 
FOURTHLY, WE HAVE ALWAYS STATED THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO 
DISCUSS OUR GRIEVANCES WHICH WERE NOT ADDRESSED BY THE 
SRI LANKA AND INDIAN GOVERNMENTS - DISCRIMINATION AGAINST 
TAMILS IN RECRUITMENT TO PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT, 
DISCRIMINATION IN ADMISSION TO UNIVERSITIES AND THE 
SYSTEMATIC COLONIZATION OF OUR TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS, 
SIMILAR, WE ASSERT, TO WHAT PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU IS DOING 
TO THE HUNGARIAN MINORITY IN TRANSYLVANIA. 
 
LASTLY, WE WISH TO CATEGORICALLY STATE THAT WE WOULD 
WELCOME THE MEDIATION OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ON 
BEHALF OF THE TAMIL PEOPLE OF SRI LANKA.  WE NEED YOUR 
ASSISTANCE AS AN IMPARTIAL INTERMEDIARY, FOR THE 
REHABILITATION OF OUR PEOPLE AND FOR PROVIDING RELIEF OF 
OUR DISTRESSED PEOPLE. 
 
FINALLY, WE CATEGORICALLY DENY WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
CRIMES LISTED IN YOUR PUBLICATION.  WE HAVE BEEN THE 
UNFORTUNATE VICTIMS OF THE STATE PROPAGANDA MACHINES OF 
THE SRI LANKAN AND INDIAN GOVERNMENTS. 
 
WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO BE INVITED FOR TALKS BY YOUR 
GOVERNMENT TOWARD THE RESOLUTION OF THIS CONFLICT. 
 
 
YOURS TRULY,

SUBJECT:  FACT SHEET ON 17 NOVEMBER 
 
1. FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF FACT SHEET ON THE REVOLUTIONARY 
ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER WHICH WAS RELEASED PUBLICLY ON 
JULY 6.  COPIES OF THE FACT SHEET BEING POUCHED TO POST 
ALSO INCLUDE TWO CHARTS DEPICTING THE NUMBERS OF 
TERRORIST ATTACKS BY YEAR FROM 1975-86, AND THE TYPES OF 
TARGETS FOR THESE ATTACKS (US MILITARY, US DIPLOMATS 
GREEK POLICE, GREEK BUSINESSMEN, ETC.) 

2. BEGIN TEXT. 

ACTIVE AND LETHAL 

GREECE\'S \"REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION 17 NOVEMBER\" IS 
PRESENTLY ONE OF THE MORE ACTIVE AND LETHAL TERRORIST 

GROUPS TARGETTING AMERICANS IN WESTERN EUROPE. AND 
FREQUENTLY ATTACKS GREEK CITIZENS AS WELL.  SUCCESSIVE 
GREEK GOVERNMENTS HAVE YET TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN 
APPREHENDING ANY MEMBER OF THE GROUP. 

SINCE ITS INITIAL APPEARANCE WITH THE DECEMBER 1975 
ASSASSINATION OF U.S. DIPLOMAT RICHARD WELCH IN ATHENS, 
THE GROUP HAS CARRIED OUT 29 ATTACKS -- ALL IN 
ATHENS.     SEVEN OF THESE ATTACKS HAVE BEEN AGAINST 
U.S. TARGETS IN WHICH 17 NOVEMBER KILLED THREE 
AMERICANS, WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR TWO ATTEMPTED 
ASSASSINATIONS, AND INJURED 26 AMERICANS IN THE BOMBINGS 
OF TWO MILITARY BUSES. 

FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES, MULTIPLE BUT RELATED 
ATTACKS -- SUCH AS THE FEBRUARY 1989 BOMBINGS OF THREE 
UNOCCUPIED RESIDENCES -- ARE COUNTED AS SEPARATE 
INCIDENTS. 

VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE GROUP\'S MEMBERSHIP, ITS 
INTERNAL DYNAMICS, OR ITS OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. 
SINCE 1975, 17 NOVEMBER HAS AVERAGED JUST OVER TWO 
ATTACKS A YEAR MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INFORMATION 
ON THE GROUP EXCEPT THROUGH ITS COMMUNIQUES AND ITS 
CHOICE OF TARGETS. 
 

NEW TACTICS AND TARGETTING 

FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY 21, 1985 ASSASSINATION OF GREEK 
PUBLISHER NIKOS MOMFERATOS, 17 NOVEMBER MOVED INTO A NEW 
OPERATIONAL PHASE.  WHILE THERE WERE ONLY FIVE ATTACKS 
IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE (THREE OF THESE 
AGAINST AMERICANS), THE SECOND AND CURRENT PHASE IS 
CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION AS 
WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER AND LETHALITY OF 
ATTACKS. 
 
IN THIS SECOND PHASE, 17 NOVEMBER HAS CARRIED OUT 24 
ATTACKS, KILLING SEVEN PEOPLE AND INJURING 43, INCLUDING 
ITS LASTEST ATTACK, THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF 
FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER GEORGE PETSOS ON MAY 8, 
1989 IN WHICH PETSOS AND TWO BODY GUARDS WERE WOUNDED. 
THIS PERIOD OF JUST OVER FOUR YEARS ACCOUNTS FOR 83 
PERCENT OF THE GROUP\'S OPERATIONS SINCE ITS FIRST 
APPEARANCE IN 1975. 

ALTHOUGH 17 NOVEMBER CARRIED OUT NO BOMBINGS DURING ITS 
FIRST PHASE, THE GROUP HAS CARRIED OUT 16 BOMBINGS AND 
TWO ATTEMPTED BOMBINGS IN ITS SECOND PHASE, INCLUDING 
FIVE REMOTE- AND ONE WIRE-DETONATED BOMB ATTACKS (FOUR 
OF THESE BEING DIRECTED AGAINST U.S. TARGETS).  THESE 
BOMBINGS RESULTED IN TWO DEATHS AND 43 INJURIES 
(INCLUDING ONE U.S. MILITARY OFFICER DEAD AND 26 OTHER 
AMERICANS INJURED). 

ALSO DURING THIS PERIOD, 17 NOVEMBER ASSASSINATED TWO 
GREEK INDUSTRIALISTS, CARRIED OUT THREE ARMED 
ASSAULTS/KNEE-CAPPINGS, AND SEIZED A SUBURBAN POLICE 
STATION, MAKING OFF WITH A SMALL ARSENAL OF WEAPONS. 
THE INCREASE IN TERRORIST ATTACKS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED IN 
PART TO THE RECRUITMENT OF NEW AND YOUNGER MEMBERS WHO 
HAVE CONVINCED THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE GROUP\'S GOALS AND 
OBJECTIVES CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BY PERIODIC 
ASSASSINATIONS ONLY. 

DESPITE THIS INCREASE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY, 17 NOVEMBER 
APPEARS TO BE LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF ATTACKS IT CAN 
CARRY OUT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.  MORE ATTACKS WOULD MEAN 
EXPANDING THE SIZE OF THE ORGANIZATION, WHICH COULD RUN 
THE RISK OF COMPROMISING ITS INTERNAL SECURITY.  SINCE 
17 NOVEMBER IS BELIEVED TO BE A SINGLE TERRORIST ENTITY 
RATHER THAN A GROUP COMPRISED OF MANY OPERATIONAL CELLS, 
IT CANNOT CARRY OUT AS MANY ATTACKS AS A LARGER GROUP. 
THIS LIMITS THE GROUP\'S POTENTIAL ACTIVITIES AS THE MORE 
ATTACKS IT CARRIES OUT, THE GREATER THE CHANCES OF IT 
BEING CAUGHT. 

 
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY 

17 NOVEMBER\'S RECENT USE OF REMOTE-CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVES 
INCREASES THE SERIOUS SECURITY CONCERN IT POSES FOR BOTH 
GREEKS AND AMERICANS.  THE NOVEMBER 26, 1985 ATTACK ON A 
GREEK POLICE BUS TRANSPORTING (MAT) RIOT POLICEMEN WAS 
THE FIRST TIME THAT THE GROUP USED SUCH A DEVICE, 
WOUNDING THIRTEEN OF THE 22 POLICEMEN ON BOARD. ONE OF 
WHOM LATER DIED OF HIS WOUNDS.  A REMOTE-DETONATED CAR 
BOMB WAS USED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF THE U.S. DEFENSE 
ATTACHE, NAVY CAPTAIN WILLIAM NORDEEN, ON JUNE 28, 
1988.  MOST RECENTLY, ANOTHER REMOTE-DETONATED CAR BOMB 
INJURED FORMER MINISTER OF PUBLIC ORDER GEORGE PETSOS 
AND TWO BODY GUARDS ON MAY 8, 1989. 

WITH THE USE OF REMOTELY-CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVES, 17 
NOVEMBER HAS BECOME A HIGHLY LETHAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION.  THESE DEVICES ARE PROVEN CAPABLE OF 
CAUSING MAJOR DESTRUCTION, EVEN AGAINST ARMORED 
VEHICLES, THUS RENDERING PROTECTIVE DEFENSES 
INADEQUATE.THE AUGUST 1988 ATTACK ON A SUBURBAN POLICE 
STATION DEMONSTRATES THAT 17 NOVEMBER IS CAPABLE OF 
MOUNTING A SOPHISTICATED TERRORIST ATTACK USING SEVERAL 
OPERATIVES AGAINST A SECURE SITE.  THE ATTACK NETTED THE 
GROUP ADDITIONAL HIGH-POWERED WEAPONRY WHICH MIGHT BE 
USED IN FUTURE LETHAL ATTACKS. 
 
 
BACKGROUND AND IDEOLOGY 

THE GROUP TAKES ITS NAME FROM THE DATE IN 1973 WHEN THE 
GREEK JUNTA SENT RIOT POLICE BACKED BY TANKS INTO THE 
ATHENS POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE TO STOP AN OCCUPATION BY 
STUDENTS DEMANDING AN END TO MILITARY RULE.  AT LEAST 20 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND 200 PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE 
INCIDENT.  THIS EVENT GALVANIZED PUBLIC DISSATISFACTION 
WITH THE MILITARY REGIME AND SERVED AS A PRELUDE FOR A 
SERIES OF EVENTS THAT EVENTUALLY LED TO ITS DOWNFALL IN 
JULY 1974. ITS COMMUNIQUES OVER THE YEARS SHOW 17 
NOVEMBER TO BE A VIOLENT MARXIST-LENINIST ORGANIZATION 
THAT IS DOCTRINALLY ANTI-CAPITALIST, ANTI-U.S. AND 
ANTI-NATO. 

THE GROUP HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE GREEK 
GOVERNMENT FOR NOT ADDRESSING A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT IT 
VIEWS AS INIMICAL TO GREEK INTERESTS, SUCH AS THE 
SITUATION IN CYPRUS, THE GREECE-TURKEY RAPPROACHMENT, 
THE PRESENCE OF U.S. BASES, AND GREEK MEMBERSHIP IN THE 
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION (NATO) AND THE 
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EC).  17 NOVEMBER ALSO 
VIEWS ITSELF AS THE \"VANGUARD OF THE WORKING CLASS.\"  IT 
IS QUICK TO REACT TO DOMESTIC ISSUES -- TAXES, LABOR, 
HIGH MEDICAL COSTS -- WHICH ARE OF IMMEDIATE CONCERN TO 
THE GREEK PEOPLE.  FOR THESE REASONS, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS 
OF ITS ATTACKS HAVE BEEN AGAINST GREEK TARGETS. 

ORGANIZATION 

17 NOVEMBER\'S ORGANIZATION MAY BE SIMILAR TO OTHER 
LEFT-WING EUROPEAN TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS WEST 
GERMANY\'S RED ARMY FACTION RAF) AND FRANCE.S ACTION 
DIRECT (AD).  IT IS A SMALL, HIGHLY-DISCIPLINED GROUP 
WHOSE \"HARD CORE\" MEMBERS PROBABLY NUMBER NO MORE THAN 
20 PEOPLE.  IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW DECISIONS ARE MADE, BUT 
JUDGING FROM SIMILAR RADICAL GROUPS IN WEST EUROPE, THEY 
ARE PROBABLY COLLECTIVE. 

THE GROUP\'S HARD CORE MEMBERS MAY HAVE BEEN UNIVERSITY 
STUDENTS DURING THE 1970.S IN GREECE, AND POSSIBLY WERE 
INVOLVED IN THE CAMPUS ACTIVITY THAT HELPED BRING ABOUT 

THE FALL OF THE MILITARY JUNTA.  TODAY, THIS HARD CORE 
WOULD HAVE REACHED THEIR LATE 30\'S AND EARLY 40\'S, SOME 
COULD EVEN BE HOLDING PROFESSIONAL JOBS SUCH AS LAWYERS, 
JOURNALISTS AND TEACHERS.  IF THESE MEMBERS ARE INDEED 
\"PART-TIME\" TERRORISTS (AS OPPOSED TO TERRORISTS WHO 
LIVE TOTALLY UNDERGROUND), IT WOULD ENHANCE THE VEIL OF 
SECRECY OVER 17 NOVEMBER\'S ORGANIZATION. 

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF TIES TO FOREIGN 
TERRORIST GROUPS, 17 NOVEMBER MAY BE AFFILIATED WITH THE 
REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE\'S STRUGGLE (ELA), BELIEVED TO BE A 
LOOSE COALITION OF VIOLENT, EXTREME LEFTIST GROUPS IN 
GREECE. 

FUTURE PROSPECTS 

IN CONTRAST TO OTHER WEST EUROPEAN TERRORIST GROUPS, 17 
NOVEMBER HAS NEVER TARGETED A CURRENT HIGH-RANKING GREEK 
GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY OFFICIAL, ALTHOUGH IT DID ATTEMPT 
TO KILL A FORMER PUBLIC ORDER MINISTER.  THE GROUP MAY 
FEEL THAT THE TIME IS NOT RIGHT FOR AN ATTACK ON A 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNING SYSTEM AND THAT IT IS 
NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND THE REPERCUSSIONS THAT 
WOULD FOLLOW.  17 NOVEMBER HAS ALSO NEVER CARRIED OUT AN 
ATTACK AGAINST NON-OFFICIAL AMERICANS OR THEIR OFFICES, 
WHETHER TOURISTS OR BUSINESSMEN, NOR HAS IT PROMINENTLY 
MENTIONED A U.S. COMPANY IN ITS COMMUNIQUES -- PERHAPS 
INDICATING THAT TARGETING U.S. FIRMS IS NOT CURRENTLY A 
HIGH PRIORITY, ALTHOUGH THIS TOO COULD CHANGE. 

THE SERIOUS THREAT BY 17 NOVEMBER TO OFFICIAL U.S. 
PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES IN GREECE, HOWEVER, CONTINUES 
UNCHECKED.  IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF ITS COMMUNIQUE 
FOLLOWING THE JUNE 1988 ASSASSINATION OF CAPTAIN 
NORDEEN, 17 NOVEMBER RATIONALIZED ITS ACTIONS SAYING 
THAT AMERICAN MILITARY FORCES IN THE COUNTRY WERE AN 
OCCUPATION FORCE, AND:  WE ARE GOING TO HIT ANYBODY WHO 
IS A MEMBER OF IT OR AN AGENT OF ITS SECRET SERVICES. 
THESE ACTIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND ARE GOING TO 
INCREASE UNTIL THE LAST TURKISH SOLDIER LEAVES CYPRUS 
AND THE LAST AMERICAN SOLDIER LEAVES OUR COUNTRY.

SUBJECT: PRESS GUIDANCES - UTA CRASH/ANGOLA/SWAPO 
 
1. THE FOLLOWING THREE GUIDANCES WERE PREPARED FOR THE NOON 
BRIEFING, SEPTEMBER 20, 1989. 
 
2.  Q.  DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE CRASH 
OF UTA FLIGHT 772? 
 
A.  WE UNDERSTAND THAT UTA FLIGHT 772 BOUND FROM NDJAMENA 
TO PARIS CRASHED 650 KMS NORTHWEST OF NDJAMENA IN CENTRAL 
NIGER.  THE CRASH SITE HAS BEEN LOCATED AND THERE DO NOT 
APPEAR TO BE ANY SURVIVORS.  THERE WERE SEVEN AMERICANS 
BELIEVED TO BE ON BOARD, INCLUDING THE WIFE OF OUR 
AMBASSADOR TO CHAD, MRS. BONNIE PUGH. 
 
Q.  WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH 
 
A.  WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON THE CASE OF THE CRASH AT THIS 
TIME. 
 
Q.  WHAT ABOUT THE CLAIMS THAT AN EXPLOSION PRECEDED THE 
CRASH? 
 
A.  WE ARE UNABLE TO VERIFY PRESS REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE 
EXPLOSION AT THIS TIME, ALTHOUGH WE ARE AWARE THE AIRLINE 
IS NOW SAYING A BOMB MOST LIKELY WAS THE CAUSE. 
 
Q.  WHAT OF THE CLAIMS THAT THIS WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK BY 
THE ISLAMIC JIHAD ORGANIZATION? 
 
A.  WE HAVE NO INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION ON THIS. 
 
SEARCH AND RESCUE EFFORT:  U.S. INVOLVEMENT: 
 
EFFORT IS BEING MOUNTED AND COORDINATED BY THE FRENCH WHO 
HAVE EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL IN THE REGION.  THEY ARE 
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNMENTS OF NIGER AND CHAD. 
 
OUR EMBASSIES ARE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE FRENCH AND THE 
GOVERNMENTS OF NIGER AND CHAD, AS WELL AS THE AIRLINE. 
 
WE HAVE DISPATCHED EMBASSY PERSONNEL TO THE CRASH SITE. 
 
WE HAVE OFFERED U.S. ASSISTANCE TO THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS 
INVOLVED; WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THEY NEED. 
 
WE HAVE OFFERED ASSISTANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGER IN 
INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH, AND A TEAM OF 
INVESTIGATORS IS STANDING BY IN WASHINGTON TO TRAVEL TO 
NIGER.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE INVESTIGATIONS CAN HELP 
WITH THE RECOVERY AND ANALYSIS OF THE PLANE\'S FLIGHT 
RECORDER. 
 
THE U.S. HAS A DEEP INTEREST IN THE FATE OF THE PASSENGERS 
AND CREW OF FLIGHT 772. 
 
THE DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE, ED PERKINS, 
HAS SENT A MESSAGE TO AMBASSADOR PUGH ON BEHALF OF ALL HIS 
COLLEAGUES.  HANK COHEN HAS SPOKEN WITH AMBASSADOR PUGH. 
OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH HIM. 
 
3. Q: DO YOU HAVE A READ OUT ON THE KINSHASA SUMMIT? 
 
A: HANK COHEN WAS IN AFRICA LAST WEEK.  HE MET WITH MOBUTU 
AND SAVIMBI SEPARATELY.  ATLHOUGH WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED 
THAT DR. SAVIMBI ATTEND THE SEPTEMBER 18 MEETING IN 
KINSHASA, SAVIMBI DID SEND A PERSONAL DELEGATION TO THE 
MEETING. 
 
WE URGE ALL PARTIES TO BEGIN A MEANINGFUL NEGOTIATION 
WITHOUT ANY POLITICAL PRE-CONDITIONS OR NON-NEGOTIABLE 
DEMANDS. 
 
THE UNITED STATES STRONGLY SUPPORTS UNITA AND ITS GOALS OF 
NATIONAL RECONCILIATION -- FOLLOWED BY FREE AND FAIR 
ELECTIONS. 
 
THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT ACCEPT THE CONCEPTS OF EXILE -- 
AMNESTY OR INTEGRATION. 
 
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN AND SUPPORT PRESIDENT 
MOBUTU. 
 
WE REGRET DR. SAVIMBI\'S DECISION NOT TO ATTEND THE KINSHASA 
SUMMIT. 
 
DUE TO HIS ABSENCE, IT APPEARS THAT THE SUMMIT WAS UNABLE 
TO MAKE ANY SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SIGNING A CEASEFIRE 
AND BEGINNING DIRECT NEGOTIATIONS FOR NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION. 
 
4. Q: CAN YOU COMMENT ON REPORTS THAT SWAPO DETAINED AND 
TORTURED ITS MEMBERS? 
 
A: THE UNITED STATES DEPLORES SWAPO\'S REPORTED USE OF 
TORTURE AGAINST ITS OWN MEMBERS. 
 
WE URGE SWAPO TO CONDUCT A PROMPT INVESTIGATION AND 
IDENTIFY ALL INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISTREATMENT. 
 
THE SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE (SR) IN 
NAMIBIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSURE THAT ALL POLITICAL 
PRISONERS AND DETAINEES HAVE BEEN RELEASED, WHETHER HELD BY 
NAMIBIAN OFFICIALS OR SWAPO. 
 
THE SYG HAS SENT A TEAM TO LOOK INTO ALLEGATIONS AT SWAPO 
CAMPS IN ZAMB1A AND ANGOLA, A MEASURE WE FULLY SUPPORT. 
 
WE CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENTS OF THOSE COUNTRIES AND UPON 
SWAPO TO COOPERATE FULLY AND RAPIDLY WITH THAT 
INVESTIGATION.

TO BE USED WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, THE PRESS, AND OTHER

CURRENT SITUATION IN CAMBODIA (SEE PARA 3) AND

3.  KEY THEMES TO BE USED WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, THE 
PRESS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN DISCUSSING 
CAMBODIA: 
 
GOALS FOR REGION 
---------------- 
THE UNITED STATES SEEKS TO ENHANCE THE POLITICAL 
STABILITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.  A 
STABLE AND DURABLE SETTLEMENT IN CAMBODIA WILL SERVE 
 
THAT GOAL BY ENDING A POTENTIAL THREAT TO THAILAND AND 
REMOVING A SOURCE OF REGIONAL TENSION. 
 
SUCH A SETTLEMENT WOULD FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF 
THE COUNTRIES OF INDOCHINA INTO THE REGION, IN THE 
PROCESS REDUCING THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE SOVIET UNION, 
AND WOULD IMPROVE THE CLIMATE OF EAST-WEST RELATIONS. 
 
AFTER A CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT, THE CONTINUED STRONG 
ECONOMIC LINKS WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND THE 
MAINTENANCE OF A STABILIZING U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE, 
WILL BE WELCOMED IN THE REGION AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A 
POSITIVE CLIMATE FOR U.S. INTERESTS. 
 
GOALS FOR A CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT 
-------------------------------- 
THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING 
ACTIVELY THE DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL EFFORTS UNDERWAY 
TO PROMOTE A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF THE CAMBODIAN 
CONFLICT. 
 
THESE EFFORTS ARE BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE DIPLOMATIC 
APPROACH WITH THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING A 
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT THAT HAS THREE ASPECTS: 
 
1) A VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS; 
2) PREVENTION OF A RETURN TO DOMINANCE OF THE KHMER 
ROUGE; 
3) GENUINE SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. 
 
PARIS CONFERENCE MOMENTUM 
------------------------- 
ALTHOUGH THE PARIS CONFERENCE DID NOT ACHIEVE ANY 
BREAKTHROUGHS, MANY SETTLEMENT DETAILS WERE RESOLVED 
AND A GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED.  THE 
CONFERENCE: 
 
A) CONFIRMED THE NECESSITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT.  A PARTIAL SOLUTION WAS SEEN AS A RECIPE 
FOR CONTINUED VIOLENCE. 
 
B) ACHIEVED A VIRTUAL CONSENSUS THAT THE UN MUST PLAY 
THE CENTRAL ROLE IN ANY SETTLEMENT PROCESS. 
 
C) ACCOMPLISHED A GOOD DEAL OF VALUABLE WORK ON THE 
SPECIFIC ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN PEACEKEEPING, GUARANTEES, 
AND REHABILITATION AND REPATRIATION. 
 
THE CONFERENCE DID NOT, HOWEVER, RESOLVE THE CENTRAL 
PHNOM PENH REGIME DID NOT ENGAGE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATION 
REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT 
UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK TO GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. 
 
ABSENT A VIABLE POLITICAL PROCESS, THE CAMBODIAN 
FACTIONS ARE LIKELY TO TURN INCREASINGLY TO MILITARY 
MEANS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONFLICT, A RESULT WHICH WILL 
BENEFIT NO ONE EXCEPT PERHAPS THE KHMER ROUGE. 
 
THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO LOSE THE VALUABLE MOMENTUM 
WHICH THE CONFERENCE HAS GENERATED.  WE MUST 
EXPEDITIOUSLY CONSIDER HOW TO OVERCOME VIETNAMESE 
INTRANSIGENCE AND SUSTAIN THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS.  THE 
CONFERENCE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A NEW INSTITUTIONAL TOOL 
WE CAN USE IN WORKING TOWARD A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. 
 
IN THEIR FINAL STATEMENT, THE CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS 
AGREED THAT THE CO-PRESIDENTS, FRANCE AND INDONESIA, 
WILL CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THE EFFORTS OF ALL PARTIES 
TO WORK TOWARD THE GOAL OF A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT.  IN ADDITION, THE CO-PRESIDENTS HAVE AGREED 
TO CONSULT WITH ALL PARTICIPANTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS 
REGARDING THE RECONVENING OF THE CONFERENCE, WHICH WAS 
ONLY SUSPENDED. 
 
UNGA RESOLUTION 
--------------- 
AT THIS UNGA, WE WILL WORK WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN 
SUPPORT OF THEIR RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA; WE BELIEVE 
THAT THIS RESOLUTION ANNUALLY HAS REFLECTED THE OPINION 
OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY REGARDING 
THE CAMBODIA SITUATION. 
 
VIETNAM\'S WITHDRAWAL 
-------------------- 
WE NOTE THAT HANOI HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO 
WITHDRAW ITS REMAINING FORCES FROM CAMBODIA LATER THIS 
MONTH.           THIS WOULD BE WELCOME SINCE VIETNAM\'S 
WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN A GOAL OF ASEAN AND THE U.S. SINCE 
THE VIETNAMESE INVASION MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO. 
HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WILL ONLY ACCEPT VIETNAM\'S CLAIM OF A TOTAL WITHDRAWAL 
IF THIS WITHDRAWAL OCCURS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A 
CREDIBLE INTERNATIONAL CONTROL MECHANISM, AND WE 
BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THIS MUST BE UNDER UNITED NATIONS 
AUSPICES--AND WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT. 
 
VIETNAM HAS ANNOUNCED A TOTAL OF SEVEN WITHDRAWALS 
DURING THE PAST DECADE, WHICH IN MANY CASES TURNED OUT 
TO BE TROOP ROTATIONS. 
 
PHNOM PENH HAS ANNOUNCED THAT 24,000 VIETNAMESE CADRES 
AND TROOPS HAVE ALREADY LEFT CAMBODIA DURING JUNE AND 
JULY 1989; THIS HAS PROVEN IMPOSSIBLE TO CONFIRM. 
 
THIS MONTH\'S WITHDRAWAL WILL APPARENTLY BE VIEWED BY 
MANY JOURNALISTS AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF 
GOVERNMENTS FRIENDLY TO VIETNAM; THERE HAVE BEEN PUBLIC 
REPORTS, AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD PRIVATELY, THAT A NUMBER 
OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS AUSTRALIA, HAVE DECLINED 
TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO CONCLUDE A 
COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT IN PARIS.  THIS HARDLY MEETS 
THE CRITERIA OF CREDIBLE INTERNATIONAL VERIFICATION OF 
THE WITHDRAWAL.  ONLY AN INTERNATIONAL CONTROL 
MECHANISM, PREFERABLY UNDER UN AUSPICES, AND WITH 
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND UNRESTRICTED ABILITY TO VISIT 
ALL AREAS OF CAMBODIA WOULD BE ABLE TO VERIFY THE 
ABSENCE OF FOREIGN FORCES. 
 
WE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM CAN ONLY OCCUR 
AFTER A COMPLETE AND VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL OF VIETNAMESE 
TROOPS FROM CAMBODIA IN THE CONTEXT RPT IN THE CONTEXT 
OF AN ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT TO THE CAMBODIAN 
CONFLICT.  THE VIETNAMESE KNOW AS WELL THAT, AS A 
PRACTICAL REALITY, THE PACE AND SCOPE OF THE 
NORMALIZATION PROCESS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THEIR 
CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH US ON THE POW/MIA ISSUE AND 
OTHER HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS. 
 
IF TROOPS ARE INDEED WITHDRAWN FROM CAMBODIA, WE HOPE 
THAT THEY WILL BE DEMOBILIZED IN VIETNAM. 
 
POSITIONING MAJOR TROOP CONCENTRATIONS ON THE 
VIETNAMESE-CAMBODIAN BORDER OR IN LAOS WILL ONLY RAISE 
FEARS OF VIETNAM\'S REINTERVENTION IN CAMBODIA--DESPITE 
SRV FOREIGN MINISTER THACH\'S CLAIMS THAT VIETNAM WOULD 
NEVER RETURN ITS TROOPS TO CAMBODIA. 
 
THACH\'S CLAIMS MAY BE CALLED INTO QUESTION BY HUN SEN\'S 
RECENT COMMENTS THAT \"IT IS THE LEGITIMATE R1GHT OF THE 
CAMBODIAN PEOPLE\" TO CALL FOR OUTSIDE HELP IF THERE IS 
OUTSIDE INTERVENTION IN CAMBODIA\'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS. 
 
POSITIONING VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN SOUTHERN LAOS WOULD 
ALSO RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT HANOI\'S RESPECT IN 
GENERAL FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF ITS NEIGHBORS. 
 
UNALTERABLE OPPOSITION TO A KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO POWER 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
THE UNITED STATES REMAINS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO A 
RETURN TO POWER OF THE MURDEROUS KHMER ROUGE. 
 
A DURABLE SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT MUST BE BASED ON A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT WHICH INCORPORATES A SERIES OF 
EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE KHMER ROUGE WILL BE 
CONTAINED. 
 
IN THIS REGARD, WE REGULARLY PRESS ALL THOSE INVOLVED 
TO CUT BACK THEIR AID TO THE KHMER ROUGE AND OTHERWISE 
HELP CONTROL THE KR IN THE CONTEXT OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
CAMBODIAN SOLUTION. 
 
OUR STRONG PREFERENCE IS THAT THE KHMER ROUGE NOT 
PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENTS; HOWEVER, 
ASEAN AND PRINCE SIHANOUK HAVE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT 
THE BEST APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THE KHMER ROUGE IS 
THAT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN A STAKE IN A POLITICAL 
PROCESS, ONE WHICH WOULD INCLUDE CONSTRAINTS AGAINST 
THEIR RETURN TO DOMINANCE.  NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE MADE 
CLEAR THAT OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT ANY CAMBODIAN 
GOVERNMENT IS DIRECTLY AND INVERSELY RELATED TO THE 
DEGREE OF KHMER ROUGE PARTICIPATION, IF ANY, IN IT. 
 
NON-ACCEPTANCE OF UNILATERAL PHNOM PENH REGIME CONTROL 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
AT THE SAME TIME, THE LEADERS OF THE PHNOM PENH REGIME 
SHARE THIS UNACCEPTABLE BACKGROUND; MANY ARE FORMER 
KHMER ROUGE OFFICIALS FROM THE EASTERN MILITARY ZONE OF 
CAMBODIA--INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER HUN SEN, COMMUNIST 
PARTY LEADER HENG SAMRIN, AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY LEADER 
CHEA SIM. 
 
HUN SEN HAS PROVED HIMSELF TO BE AN ABLE POLITICAL 
TACTICIAN AND COMPETENT MANIPULATOR OF THE NEWS MEDIA; 
HOWEVER, WE CAN ASSUME THAT AS CHIEF OF STAFF AND 
REGIMENTAL DEPUTY COMMANDER FOR HIS MILITARY REGION 
BEFORE DEFECTING FROM THE KHMER ROUGE TO VIETNAM IN 
1977, HUN SEN PARTICIPATED AT A RESPONSIBLE LEVEL IN 
THE KIND OF MURDEROUS ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE MADE THE 
KHMER ROUGE NAME A BYWORD FOR INFAMY. 
 
THESE FORMER KR OFFICIALS ALSO REPRESENT AN 
ILLEGITIMATE REGIME IMPOSED AND SUSTAINED FOR THE PAST 
DECADE BY FOREIGN FORCE OF ARMS; THE PHNOM PENH REGIME 
IS ALSO ACQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT REPUTATION FOR 
CORRUPTION. 
 
ONLY A COMPROMISE ON POWER-SHARING BASED ON NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRINCE 
SIHANOUK--THE SYMBOL OF TRUE CAMBODIAN NATIONALISM--CAN 
ESTABLISH AN AUTHORITY WITH LEGITIMACY FOR THE INTERIM 
PERIOD UNTIL ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD. 
 
U.S. SUPPORT FOR PRINCE SIHANOUK 
-------------------------------- 
THE GOAL OF THE UNITED STATES IS TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE IN 
HELPING TO ACHIEVE AN ACCEPTABLE AND LASTING SETTLEMENT. 
 
WHILE THE CORE OF OUR APPROACH IS A SUSTAINED 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORT, WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING OUR 
PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE FOR PRINCE SIHANOUK AND THE 
CAMBODIAN NON-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE (NCR) WILL ALLOW THE 
NCR TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN A SETTLEMENT WHICH SERVES THE 
BEST INTERESTS OF THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE AND PREVENTS A 
KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO POWER. 
 
WE ARE NOT ALONE IN SUPPORTING THE NCR; THE 
NON-COMMUNISTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN A 
VARIETY OF FORMS FROM A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES.  OUR 
EFFORTS ARE IN SUPPORT OF AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE 
NON-COMMUNISTS AND THESE COUNTRIES. 
 
U.S. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE NON-COMMUNIST 
RESISTANCE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE NON-LETHAL.  WE 
CANNOT OFFER SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE SUPPORT WE AND 
THE OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE PROVIDING; BECAUSE 
THIS ASSISTANCE GOES TO GUERRILLA FORCES OPERATING 
INSIDE CAMBODIA, ANY DISCUSSION OF THE DETAILS OF THESE 
PROGRAMS COULD BE OF POTENTIAL UTILITY TO THE 
ADVERSARIES OF THE NCR. 
 
MASSIVE SOVIET SUPPORT FOR PHNOM PENH REGIME 
-------------------------------------------- 
NEVERTHELESS, WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT OUR SUPPORT FOR 
THE NON-COMMUNISTS IS MINOR IN COMPARISON TO THE 
MASSIVE QUANTITY OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO 
PHNOM PENH BY THE SOVIET UNION, EITHER DIRECTLY OR VIA 
VIETNAM--AN AMOUNT ESTIMATED AT $1.1 BILLION BETWEEN 
1984 AND 1988. 
 
THERE ARE CONTINUING REPORTS THAT THIS SOVIET 
ASSISTANCE--A MASSIVE AMOUNT FOR A COUNTRY OF ONLY 
SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE--HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY THIS 
YEAR AND IS NOW ESTIMATED TO BE WELL OVER TEN TIMES THE 
QUANTITY THE CHINESE CURRENTLY PROVIDE THE KHMER ROUGE. 
 
THESE RECENTLY REPORTED INCREASED TRANSFERS OF 
EQUIPMENT TO THE PHNOM PENH REGIME SUGGEST THAT THE PRK 
IS MOVING AWAY FROM DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES TO ACHIEVE A 
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN PREPARATION FOR A RETURN TO THE 
BATTLEFIELD. 
 
NOT TIME FOR NORMALIZATION WITH VIETNAM 
--------------------------------------- 
IN LIGHT OF ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING 
VIETNAMESE INTRANSIGENCE IN PARIS, THE CURRENT 
STALEMATE REGARDING A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT, AND 
APPARENT MOVEMENT BACKWARDS TOWARD A MILITARY OPTION, 
NORMALIZATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM WOULD BE 
PREMATURE. 
 
IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER 
COUNTRIES SHOULD ALSO MINIMIZE THEIR DIPLOMATIC AND 
ECONOMIC/AID RELATIONSHIPS WITH VIETNAM. 
 
4.  NEXT STEPS FOR U.S. (THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ARE 
FROM A SPEECH BY EAP ASSISTANCE SECRETARY RICHARD 
SOLOMON IN LOS ANGELES EARLIER THIS MONTH): 
 
THREE PROPOSITIONS 
------------------ 
THREE PROPOSITIONS UNDERLIE THIS ADMINISTRATION\'S 
APPROACH TO THIS CONTINUING TRAGEDY: 
 
--  FIRST, CAMBODIA IS A CHALLENGE TO THE CONSCIENCE 
AND CONCERN OF THE ENTIRE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  THE 
CAMBODIAN PEOPLE DESERVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR NATIONAL 
SOVEREIGNTY, SELF-DETERMINATION, POLITICAL 
RECONCILIATION AND DEVELOPMENT -- AND WE WANT TO ENSURE 
THAT THERE ARE NO MORE CAMBODIAN KILLING FIELDS.  THE 
UNITED STATES WILL PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN PURSUIT OF 
THESE OBJECTIVES, BUT IT MUST BE RECOGNIZED THAT WE 
HAVE NEITHER THE POLITICAL POSITION NOR THE RESOURCES 
TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES ON OUR OWN. 
 
--  SECOND, OUR PRIMARY SECURITY OBLIGATION IN THIS 
REGION IS TO THAILAND, TO WHICH WE ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY 
THE MANILA PACT OF 1954.  AS WELL, WE HAVE A MAJOR 
INTEREST IN THE CONTINUING INTEGRITY AND VITALITY OF 
ASEAN. 
 
--  AND THIRD, WE HAVE A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE IN SEEING 
INDOCHINA FREED OF THE RIVALRIES OF THE GREAT POWERS -- 
AN OBJECTIVE MOST LIKELY REALIZED IF CAMBODIAN AND 
VIETNAM ARE AT PEACE WITHIN THEMSELVES AND WITH THEIR 
NEIGHBORS. 
 
THREE ACTIVITIES 
---------------- 
GIVEN THESE PROPOSITIONS, THE ADMINISTRATION WILL 
PURSUE THREE LEVELS OF ACTIVITY IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, 
ALL DESIGNED TO BUILD ON THE DIPLOMATIC MOMENTUM OF 
PARIS: 
 
--  WE WILL SUSTAIN ACTIVE CONTACTS WITH THE FIVE 
PERMANENT MEMBERS OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL.  FRANCE, 
CHINA, AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE THE MAJOR POWERS WITH 
THE MOST DIRECT INFLUENCE AND INTERESTS IN CAMBODIA AND 
VIETNAM. 
 
THE SOVIET UNION, AS THE PRIMARY SUPPORTER OF VIETNAM 
AND HUN SEN, MUST RESTRICT ITS INCREASING FLOW OF ARMS 
INTO CAMBODIA, AND BRING HANOI TO SEE THAT ITS OWN 
INTERESTS WILL NOT BE SERVED BY ANOTHER CYCLE OF 
WARFARE IN INDOCHINA -- WHICH CERTAINLY WILL BE THE 
CASE IF IT SEEKS FULL POWER FOR HUN SEN IN THE ABSENCE 
OF A PROCESS OF POLITICAL RECONCILIATION. 
 
IN RETURN, HANOI AND HUN SEN -- AND THE INTERNATIONAL 
COMMUNITY -- HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT CHINA TO EQUALLY 
RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OF ARMS TO THE KHMER ROUGE. 
INDEED, BEIJING HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TAKE ACTIVE 
MEASURES THAT WILL PREVENT THE KHMER ROUGE FROM AGAIN 
IMPOSING A MURDEROUS RULE ON THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. 
 
FRANCE, FOR ITS PART, IS DUE CREDIT FOR TAKING THE 
DIPLOMATIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRYING TO HELP THE 
CAMBODIAN FACTIONS BRIDGE THEIR DIFFERENCES.  WE SHOULD 
POINT OUT THAT THE PARIS CONFERENCE WAS ONLY SUSPENDED, 
NOT ADJOURNED -- SO THAT FRANCE AND CONFERENCE 
CO-CHAIRMAN INDONESIA HAVE A CONTINUING MANDATE TO WORK 
FOR A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION. 
 
--  AT A SECOND LEVEL, THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK 
CLOSELY WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR 
POLITICAL APPROACH TO THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT.  THEIR 
SECURITY INTERESTS ARE MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE 
SEARCH FOR PEACE IN INDOCHINA; AND WE WILL SUPPORT 
THEIR EFFORTS -- MOST IMMEDIATELY AT THE UPCOMING 
SESSION OF THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
 
--  AND FINALLY, WE WILL SUSTAIN OUR SUPPORT FOR THE 
NON-COMMUNIST RESISTANCE AND PRINCE SIHANOUK AS THE 
POLITICAL CENTER OF A PROCESS OF NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION. 
 
SOME NOW ARGUE THAT THE THREAT OF A KHMER ROUGE 
RESURGENCE IS SUCH THAT THE U.S. MUST RELY ON HUN SEN 
RATHER THAN PRESS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT.  THIS APPROACH IS SERIOUSLY FLAWED ON 
SEVERAL COUNTS. 
 
FIRST, A REGIME IMPOSED AND SUSTAINED BY FOREIGN FORCE 
OF ARMS LACKS LEGITIMACY.  VIOLATING THIS FUNDAMENTAL 
PRINCIPLE WOULD PUT AT RISK THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM AND BE TO OUR PERIL IN MANY OTHER 
PARTS OF THE WORLD.  SECOND, THERE IS AT PRESENT LITTLE 
BASIS FOR ASSUMING THAT HUN SEN\'S UNPROVEN FORCES, 
ABSENT THEIR VIETNAMESE PROTECTORS, CAN ELIMINATE THE 
KHMER ROUGE, A GOAL THAT ELUDED HANOI\'S VAUNTED ARMY 
FOR THE PAST DECADE.  AND LASTLY, IN THE ABSENCE OF A 
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT SUPPORTED BY PRINCE SIHANOUK, SUCH 
A MOVE WOULD PIT THE U.S. AGAINST CAMBODIAN NATIONALISM 
-- A POLICY HARDLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
 
AS DEMOCRATS (WITH A SMALL \"D\"), OUR COMMITMENT MUST BE 
TO A POLITICAL PROCESS THAT PERMITS NATIONAL 
SELF-DETERMINATION FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE.  WE SEE 
PRESS REPORTS OF HUN SEN\'S POPULARITY, OF REFORMIST 
POLICIES PROMOTED BY PHNOM PENH THAT ARE RESTORING 
BUDDHISM AND ALLOWING PRIVATE PROPERTY AND FREE MARKET 
ACTIVITY.  IF THE PHNOM PENH REGIME IS AS POPULAR AS 
ITS PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN PORTRAYS IT TO BE, IT CAN 
ONLY BENEFIT BY TAKING ITS CASE TO THE PEOPLE IN FREE 
AND FAIR ELECTIONS SUPERVISED BY THE UN. 
 
THE U.S. REMAINS PREPARED TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF SUCH 
A CREDIBLE TEST OF CAMBODIAN PUBLIC OPINION, AND TO 
WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN SUPPORTING A 
PROCESS OF POLITICAL RECONCILIATION IN CAMBODIA THAT 
CONTAINS SAFEGUARDS AGAINST A KHMER ROUGE RETURN TO 
DOMINANCE. 
 
THUS, THE ISSUE COMES BACK TO WHETHER THE CAMBODIAN 
FACTIONS, ENCOURAGED BY THEIR FOREIGN SUPPORTERS, CAN 
JOIN TOGETHER IN A POLITICAL PROCESS OF NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION.  THE U.S. WILL USE ITS INFLUENCE TO 
MOVE EVENTS IN THIS DIRECTION.  CHINA AND THE SOVIET 
UNION MUST DO THE SAME.  MOSCOW, IN PARTICULAR, MUST 
ACCEPT AND ACT ON THE REALITY THAT WITHOUT SOME 
WILLINGNESS BY VIETNAM AND HUN SEN TO COMPROMISE ON 
POWER-SHARING, THERE CAN BE NO NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT, 
NO RESPITE FROM ARMED CONFLICT. 
 
5.  FOLLOWING ARE SPECIFIC TALKING POINTS FOR SELECTED 
HOST GOVERNMENTS: 
 
AUSTRALIA 
--------- 
WE APPRECIATE THE WAY WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER ON THIS 
ISSUE, MOST RECENTLY AT THE PARIS CONFERENCE. 
 
WE BOTH AGREE THAT EFFECTIVE SAFEGUARDS AGAINST A KHMER 
ROUGE RETURN TO POWER ARE VITAL.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE 
THAT THE KEY TO CONTROLLING THE KHMER ROUGE IS A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT BUILT AROUND THE ESTABLISHMENT 
OF A COALITION GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK. 
 
THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE DIPLOMATIC AND 
ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH 
REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. 
 
WE APPRECIATED YOUR INFORMING THE VIETNAMESE AT THE END 
OF THE PARIS CONFERENCE THAT FAILURE TO REACH A 
COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WOULD MEAN THAT AUSTRALIA WILL 
CONTINUE ITS POLICY OF NOT PROVIDING OFFICIAL AID TO 
THE SRV. 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE IN ITS 
EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES OF 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE IMF. 
 
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN OPPOSING THE FORMATION 
OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A 
COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS 
TO THE FUND. 
 
BRUNEI, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE, THAILAND 
---------------------------------------- 
WE WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE 
CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE COOPERATION THAT OUR DELEGATIONS 
ENJOYED THROUGHOUT THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA. 
 
WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK 
WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD 
UPON THIS PROGRESS AND ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING 
DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE 
DELIBERATIONS. 
 
THE CONFERENCE AGAIN CONFIRMED THAT THE KEY TO ANY 
SETTLEMENT IS THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING:  HOW TO 
CONSTRUCT AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK 
WHICH WOULD GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS. 
THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO PROGRESS, OF COURSE, WAS THE 
TOTALLY INTRANSIGENT ATTITUDE WHICH HANOI AND THE PHNOM 
PENH REGIME ADOPTED ON THIS ISSUE.  THIS UNCOMPROMISING 
STANCE WAS IN MARKED CONTRAST TO THE MANNER IN WHICH 
PRINCE SIHANOUK APPROACHED THE PROBLEM. 
 
AS A POSSIBLE GUIDE TO THE SHAPE OF A POWER-SHARING 
ARRANGEMENT, WE WERE IMPRESSED BY THE SUGGESTIVE OUTLINE 
FOR AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WHICH THE ASEAN STATES 
PRODUCED AT THE VERY END OF THE CONFERENCE.  ALTHOUGH WE 
REALIZE THAT THIS PROBLEM BASICALLY MUST BE RESOLVED BY 
THE CAMBODIANS THEMSELVES, EFFORTS BY OTHERS CAN BE 
HELPFUL IN PROVIDING USEFUL NEW APPROACHES. 
 
IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI 
AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS 
ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST 
RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH 
TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  IT IS VITAL FOR ASEAN TO 
CONTINUE TO SPEAK WITH A STRONG AND UNIFIED VOICE IN 
PROMOTING A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL SOLUTION IN 
CAMBODIA.  ASEAN\'S LEADERSHIP AND THE CLOSE ASEAN-U.S. 
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN 
DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF CAMBODIA\'S UN SEAT AND DURING 
THE DELICATE RENEGOTIATION OF THIS YEAR\'S ASEAN 
RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY. 
 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS HELPFUL AS WE CAN AT THIS 
YEAR\'S UNGA TO ENSURE STRONG SUPPORT FOR YOUR CAMBODIA 
RESOLUTION. 
 
WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE TO MINIMIZE NORMAL 
DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE 
PHNOM PENH REGIME. 
 
CANADA 
------ 
WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO THANK 
YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR THE CLOSE AND PRODUCTIVE 
COOPERATION OUR TWO DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE 
PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA. 
 
WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK 
WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD 
 
UPON THIS PROGRESS AND ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING 
DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE 
DELIBERATIONS. 
 
IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI 
AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS 
ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST 
RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH 
TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS 
IMPERATIVE TO MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC 
INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME. 
 
CHINA 
----- 
WE WANT TO EXPRESS AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE CLOSE 
COOPERATION THAT EXISTED IN PARIS BETWEEN OUR TWO 
DELEGATIONS. 
 
WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK 
WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD 
UPON THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE.  THE ALTERNATIVE TO 
ACHIEVING A SETTLEMENT QUICKLY, WE FEAR, WILL BE A 
PERIOD OF CIVIL WARFARE.  SHOULD THE KHMER ROUGE BEGIN 
TO DEMONSTRATE MILITARY SUPERIORITY, THIS WILL RISK 
SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR 
SUPPORT FOR THE TWO NON-COMMUNIST FACTIONS WITH WHICH 
THE KHMER ROUGE IS AFFILIATED. 
 
YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE KHMER 
ROUGE AND THE NEED FOR CONTROLS TO ASSURE THAT THEY DO 
NOT RETURN TO POWER IN CAMBODIA.  WE WERE VERY 
INTERESTED AND APPRECIATIVE OF THE VIEW EXPRESSED BY 
YOUR DELEGATION IN PARIS THAT THE KHMER ROUGE\'S ROLE IN 
AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT COULD BE LESS THAN THE OTHER 
FACTIONS. 
 
WE ARE CONTINUING TO URGE THE SOVIETS TO PUSH THE 
VIETNAMESE AND HUN SEN TO NEGOTIATE CONSTRUCTIVELY ON 
THE TRANSITIONAL POWER-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. 
 
TO AVERT AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN CAMBODIA, WE ARE 
ASKING THE SOVIETS TO RESTRICT THE FLOW OF ARMS TO ITS 
CAMBODIAN ALLY.  SIMILARLY, WE BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD 
ALSO RESTRICT THE MOVEMENT OF ARMS TO THE KHMER ROUGE. 
 
THE CONTINUED PRESENCE IN CAMBODIA OF SENIOR KHMER 
ROUGE LEADERS LIKE POL POT, IENG SARY AND TA MOK IS 
PARTICULARLY TROUBLESOME.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO 
EFFORTS TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS CONFLICT, IF YOUR 
GOVERNMENT WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THESE UNACCEPTABLE 
KHMER ROUGE LEADERS TO RELOCATE TO CHINA. 
 
FRANCE 
------ 
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL OF THE HARD 
WORK THAT YOUR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS STAFF, 
ESPECIALLY CLAUDE MARTIN, DEVOTED TOWARD MAKING THE 
PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA A SUCCESS. 
 
ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE DID NOT PRODUCE A COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT, MUCH USEFUL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A 
GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
 
IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT, IT IS 
IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND 
ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH 
REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. 
 
IN THIS REGARD, WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL 
ASSISTANCE IN ITS EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE 
RESOURCES OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH 
AS THE IMF. 
 
WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE FORMATION OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND 
TO GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO 
HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS TO THE FUND. 
 
WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD UPON THE 
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS ACHIEVED AT THE CONFERENCE. 
 
INDONESIA 
--------- 
WE WOULD LIKE AGAIN TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES 
FOR YOUR IMPRESSIVE EFFORTS, ALONG WITH THOSE OF OUR 
FRENCH FRIENDS, TO ORGANIZE AND GUIDE THE MONTH-LONG 
PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA.  WE ADMIRE THE DEDICATION 
AND COURAGE YOUR GOVERNMENT AND THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT 
DISPLAYED IN UNDERTAKING--DESPITE DAUNTING ODDS--THIS 
IMPORTANT INITIATIVE TO EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE TRAGIC 
CAMBODIAN CONFLICT. 
 
WHILE WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT WHICH WE SOUGHT ELUDED US, MUCH USEFUL WORK 
WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TO BUILD 
UPON THE PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE AT THE CONFERENCE AND 
ADDRESS THOSE REMAINING DIFFERENCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT 
INTO SHARP FOCUS BY THE DELIBERATIONS. 
 
AS A POSSIBLE GUIDE TO THE SHAPE OF A POWER-SHARING 
ARRANGEMENT, WE WERE IMPRESSED BY THE SUGGESTIVE 
OUTLINE FOR AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT WHICH THE ASEAN 
DELEGATIONS WERE DISCUSSING AT THE VERY END OF THE 
CONFERENCE.  IT MAY CONTAIN ELEMENTS YOU WOULD FIND 
USEFUL IN ATTEMPTING, UNDER YOUR MANDATE FROM THE 
CONFERENCE, TO REVIVE DISCUSSIONS AMONG THE CAMBODIANS 
AND OTHER INVOLVED STATES ON THIS KEY ISSUE. 
 
IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS TO CONVINCE HANOI 
AND PHNOM PENH THAT THEY MUST COMPROMISE, IT IS 
ESSENTIAL THAT WE AS SUPPORTERS OF THE NON-COMMUNIST 
RESISTANCE MAINTAIN OUR UNITED AND STEADFAST APPROACH 
TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM.  OF COURSE, CONTINUED ASEAN 
LEADERSHIP IN PROMOTING A COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL 
SETTLEMENT IS VITAL.  WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE 
TO MINIMIZE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION 
WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME. 
 
JAPAN 
----- 
WE APPRECIATE THE SOLIDARITY THAT JAPAN HAS SHOWN WITH 
US ON THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE AND THE CLOSE COOPERATION 
BETWEEN OUR TWO DELEGATIONS DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE. 
 
THE CHIEF IMPASSE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE CONFERENCE WAS 
THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME ON 
THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO REAL INTEREST ON 
THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT UNDER 
PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE THE COUNTRY TO 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. 
 
THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE 
DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE 
PHNOM PENH REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON 
THEIR PART, A POSITION EACH OF US SHARES. 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD COMMUNITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
IGNORE HANOI\'S REQUESTS FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE IN ITS 
EFFORTS TO REGAIN ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES OF 
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE IMF. 
 
WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE FORMATION OF A SUPPORT GROUP AND 
TO GUARANTEES IN SUPPORT OF A COMMERCIAL BRIDGE LOAN TO 
 
HELP VIETNAM PAY ITS ARREARS TO THE FUND.  WE 
APPRECIATE YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S STEADFAST SUPPORT ON THIS 
ISSUE. 
 
WE MUST CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARD A 
COMPREHENSIVE CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT.  AT THIS UNGA, WE 
ALSO NEED TO WORK WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES IN SUPPORT 
OF THEIR RESOLUTION ON CAMBODIA. 
 
MALAYSIA 
-------- 
WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS APPRECIATION FOR THE 
COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP OUR 
DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON 
CAMBODIA.  WE ADMIRED THE ACTIVE ROLE YOUR COUNTRY 
PLAYED AT THE MEETING, PARTICULARLY IN THE TAXING JOB 
OF CO-CHAIRING THE COMMITTEE ON GUARANTEES. 
 
AS YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE 
CONFERENCE WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM 
PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO 
REAL INTEREST ON THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE 
THE COUNTRY TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. 
 
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE DIPLOMATIC 
AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH 
REGIME IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR PART. 
 
IT IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL FOR ASEAN TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK 
WITH A STRONG AND UNIFIED VOICE IN PROMOTING A 
COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL SOLUTION IN CAMBODIA.  ASEAN\'S 
LEADERSHIP AND THE CLOSE ASEAN-U.S. WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP WILL BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN DEALING 
WITH THE ISSUE OF CAMBODIA\'S UN SEAT AND DURING THE 
DELICATE RENEGOTIATION OF THIS YEAR\'S ASEAN RESOLUTION 
ON CAMBODIA AT THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY.

WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED A

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE WORK TO CONTINUE THE POSITIVE 
MOMENTUM GENERATED BY THE PARIS CONFERENCE.  WE EXPECT 
THAT IN KEEPING WITH THE CLOSING STATEMENT, CONFERENCE 
CO-PRESIDENTS, FRANCE AND INDONESIA, WILL SOON BEGIN 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE CAMBODIAN PARTIES WITH A VIEW 
TOWARD REENERGIZING NEGOTIATIONS ON THE CORE 
POWER-SHARING ISSUE. 
 
TO BE FRANK, HOWEVER, UNLESS HANOI AND PHNOM PENH 
CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE AND BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD 
FAITH, WE ARE AFRAID THAT ESCALATING VIOLENCE WILL SOON 
ADD TO THE MISFORTUNES OF THE LONG-SUFFERING CAMBODIAN 
PEOPLE. 
 
INCREASING INSTABILITY IN CAMBODIA WILL ALSO HAVE 
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.  IT WILL 
REFLECT BADLY ON OUR JOINT COMMITMENT TO RESOLVE 
REGIONAL CONFLICTS AND INEVITABLY PROMOTE STRAINS IN 
OUR BILATERAL TIES. 
 
WE PLAN TO WORK WITH OUR CAMBODIAN FRIENDS AND OTHER 
ALLIES IN THE REGION TO AVOID FURTHER BLOODSHED IN A 
COSTLY MILITARY TEST OF STRENGTH AND TO ENCOURAGE A 
QUICK RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE. 
 
WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL JOIN US IN REDOUBLED EFFORTS TO 
ACHIEVE A COMPREHENSIVE AND DURABLE POLITICAL SOLUTION 
TO THIS PROLONGED REGIONAL CONFLICT.  IT IS 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL OUTSIDE PARTIES TAKE 
CONCRETE STEPS TO CURTAIL AND EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE THE 
FLOW OF ARMS INTO CAMBODIA. 
 
TO MOVE THIS POLITICAL PROCESS FORWARD, WE WOULD EXPECT 
YOU TO USE YOUR CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE WITH BOTH HANOI 
AND PHNOM PENH TO CONVINCE THEM THAT A COMPREHENSIVE 
SETTLEMENT BASED ON AN INTERIM CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT LED 
BY PRINCE SIHANOUK AND INCLUDING EQUITABLE 
REPRESENTATION FOR THE NON-COMMUNISTS AS WELL AS THE 
HUN SEN FACTION IS ESSENTIAL.  IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO 
AVERT A DETERIORATING SITUATION IN CAMBODIA AND TO 
FORESTALL THE LOOMING SPECTER OF A KHMER ROUGE RETURN 
TO POWER. 
 
AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO A KR RETURN 
TO POWER IN CAMBODIA AND STRONGLY PREFER THAT THEY HAVE 
NO ROLE IN ANY CAMBODIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
WE WERE ENCOURAGED BY INDICATIONS THAT BEIJING DID NOT 
SUPPORT AN EQUAL ROLE FOR THE KHMER ROUGE IN AN INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT AND BELIEVE THAT THIS OPENING SHOULD BE 
EXPLOITED TO MINIMIZE ANY ROLE FOR THE KR.  WE HOPE 
THAT YOU CAN PERSUADE HANOI AND PHNOM PENH TO PURSUE 
THIS OPPORTUNITY. 
 
SWEDEN

HAVE DECLINED THE SRV AND PRK INVITATION TO MONITOR THE 
VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL, STATING THAT YOU WOULD ONLY

WERE A COMPLETE SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN ISSUE. 
 
WE APPRECIATE THE POSITION OF THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT ON 
THIS ISSUE.

WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE 
COOPERATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP OUR TWO 
DELEGATIONS MAINTAINED DURING THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON 
CAMBODIA.  ALTHOUGH THE CONFERENCE DID NOT PRODUCE THE 
COMPREHENSIVE CAMBODIAN SETTLEMENT WHICH WE BOTH 
SOUGHT, MUCH USEFUL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND A 
GENERALLY POSITIVE MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED. 
 
AS YOU KNOW, THE CHIEF IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE 
CONFERENCE WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM 
PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING; WE SAW NO 
REAL INTEREST ON THEIR PARTS IN ESTABLISHING AN INTERIM 
GOVERNMENT UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK\'S LEADERSHIP TO GUIDE 
THE COUNTRY TO FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. 
 
IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT THAT WE MINIMIZE NORMAL 
DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC INTERACTION WITH HANOI AND THE 
PHNOM PENH REGIME IN ORDER TO ECOURAGE FLEXIBILITY ON 
THEIR PARTS. 
 
6.  THE FOLLOWING EAP PRESS GUIDANCE ON THE VIETNAMESE 
WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA WAS PREPARED SEPTEMBER 21, 
1989: 
 
Q:  THE VIETNAMESE HAVE NOW WITHDRAWN THEIR TROOPS FROM 
CAMBODIA.  WHAT\'S OUR REACTION? 
 
A:  WHILE WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED AN 
INTERNATIONALLY-VERIFIED WITHDRAWAL, PREFERABLY UNDER 
THE AEGIS OF THE UN AND IN THE CONTEXT OF A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT, WE 
WELCOME HANOI\'S APPARENT PULL-OUT AS AN END TO ITS 
TEN-YEAR OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA.  WE NOTE THAT THIS HAS 
BEEN A GOAL OF ASEAN AND THE U.S. SINCE THE VIETNAMESE 
INVASION.  NEVERTHELESS, WE BELIEVE THAT VIETNAM CANNOT 
EVADE ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP ACHIEVE IN CAMBODIA A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT BASED ON NATIONAL 
RECONCILIATION. 
 
Q:  WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, WILL THE VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL 
HAVE ON OUR CAMBODIAN POLICY? 
 
A:   THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA, UNFORTUNATELY, 
DID NOT ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE OF FINALIZING A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT TO THAT TRAGIC CONFLICT.  TO A 
LARGE EXTENT, IT WAS THE INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE 
PHNOM PENH REGIME ON THE ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING WHICH 
PRECLUDED A COMPLETELY SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME AT THE 
CONFERENCE\'S INITIAL SESSION. 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAMBODIAN CONFLICT MUST BE RESOLVED 
POLITICALLY AND NOT ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  WE, THEREFORE, 
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CONFERENCE CO-PRESIDENTS 
AND PARTICIPANTS IN BUILDING UPON THE PROGRESS ALREADY 
MADE TO MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY TOWARD A RESOLUTION. 
 
Q:  NOW THAT VIETNAM HAS PULLED ITS TROOPS OUT OF 
CAMBODIA AS WE DEMANDED, ARE WE PREPARED TO ESTABLISH 
RELATIONS WITH HANOI AS WE AGREED? 
 
A.  WE AGREED TO JOIN THE PARIS CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA 
WITH THE HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD ACHIEVE A 
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE TRAGIC CAMBODIAN 
CONFLICT INCLUDING A VERIFIED TOTAL VIETNAMESE 
WITHDRAWAL, ASSURANCES AGAINST THE RETURN OF THE KHMER 
ROUGE, AND A PROCESS LEADING TO REAL SELF-DETERMINATION 
FOR THE CAMBODIAN PEOPLE. 
 
IF THE CONFERENCE HAD ACHIEVED THAT OBJECTIVE, WE WERE 
PREPARED TO MOVE TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF OUR RELATIONS 
WITH HANOI, AS WE HAVE STATED MANY TIMES.  THE 
VIETNAMESE KNOW AS WELL THAT, AS A PRACTICAL REALITY, 
THE PACE AND SCOPE OF THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS WILL BE 
AFFECTED BY THEIR CONTINUED COOPERATION WITH US ON THE 
POW/MIA ISSUE AND OTHER HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS. 
 
UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONFERENCE REACHED AN IMPASSE ON THE 
ISSUE OF POWER-SHARING -- TO A LARGE EXTENT DUE TO THE 
INTRANSIGENCE OF HANOI AND THE PHNOM PENH REGIME.  THEY 
REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE FOR A INTERIM COALITION GOVERNMENT 
UNDER PRINCE SIHANOUK, WHICH WOULD LEAD THE COUNTRY TO 
DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS.  THEY CLEARLY INTEND THAT THE PRK 
SHOULD MAINTAIN A MONOPOLY OF POWER UNTIL ELECTIONS. 
WE, AND MOST OF THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS AT THE 
CONFERENCE, ARE CONVINCED THAT FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
ARE NOT POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT. 
 
WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT SIGNS OF INCREASING 
DELIVERIES OF MILITARY SUPPLIES TO THE PHNOM PENH 
REGIME AND THE IMPLICATIONS THAT MAY HAVE FOR AN 
ESCALATION OF THE VIOLENCE. 
 
IN LIGHT OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE BELIEVE 
NORMALIZATION OF OUR RELATIONS WITH HANOI WOULD BE 
PREMATURE.  WE WOULD HOPE THAT IF THE OTHER 
PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO MINIMIZE THEIR DIPLOMATIC AND 
ECONOMIC TIES WITH VIETNAM, HANOI CAN BE CONVINCED TO 
ADOPT A MORE COOPERATIVE APPROACH TOWARD SEEKING A 
COMPREHENSIVE POLITICAL RESOLUTION OF THE CAMBODIAN 
CONFLICT.

SUBJECT:  RELEASE OF FACT SHEET ON THE TERRORIST GROUP, 
SENDERO LUMINOSO 
 
1. THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE RELEASING AT THE NOON PRESS 
BRIEFING, ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, A FACT SHEET ON 
SENDERO LUMINOSO.  THIS IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF 
FACT SHEETS ON TERRORIST GROUPS AND TERRORISM-SUPPORTING 
COUNTRIES RELEASED BY THE OFFICE OF THE COORDINATOR FOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM (S/CT).  THE FACT SHEET HAS BEEN 
CLEARED BY RELEVANT BUREAUS AT THE DEPARTMENT.  Q AND 
A\'S FOR PRESS AND FULL TEXT OF FACT SHEET FOLLOWS: 

2. S/CT PRESS ANNOUNCEMENT 
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1989 

ANNOUNCEMENT: RELEASE OF SENDERO LUMINOSO FACT SHEET 

AVAILABLE IN THE PRESS OFFICE IS A FACT SHEET ON THE 
SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) TERRORIST GROUP.  THIS 
IS ONE OF A SERIES OF REPORTS PREPARED BY THE OFFICE OF 
COUNTERTERRORISM. 

Q:  WHY ARE YOU RELEASING IT NOW? 

A:     THESE REPORTS ARE PREPARED AND DISTRIBUTED 
PERIODICALLY, PRIMARILY FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES. 
THE RELEASE OF THESE REPORTS IS NOT TIMED TO ANY 
CURRENT EVENT. 

(IF ASKED:) 

Q:  ISN\'T SENDERO A DOMESTIC INSURGENT GROUP RATHER THAN 
AN INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST GROUP? 

A:  SENDERO IS BOTH A TERRORIST AND AN INSURGENT GROUP, 
AND IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  THROUGHOUT ITS 
NINE-YEAR CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE, IT HAS ATTACKED MANY 
INTERNATIONAL TARGETS IN PERU, AND IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR KILLING U.S. CITIZENS -- IN 1988 WHEN IT 
MURDERED AN A.I.D.-CONTRACT EMPLOYEE, AND IN 1986 
WHEN IT BOMBED A TRAIN PACKED WITH TOURISTS, KILLING 
EIGHT, INCLUDING TWO AMERICANS. 

3. TEXT OF FACT SHEET.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) 

DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE 

PERU\'S SENDERO LUMINOSO (SHINING PATH) IS AN EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE TERRORIST AND INSURGENCY 
GROUP.  ITS DECLARED AIM IS TO DESTROY EXISTING PERUVIAN 
INSTITUTIONS AND REPLACE THEM WITH AN INDIAN-BASED 
PEASANT REVOLUTIONARY REGIME, INSPIRED IN PART BY MAO 
ZEDONG\'S CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN CHINA. 

SENDERO INTIMIDATES THE POPULACE BY EXECUTING -- 
FREQUENTLY IN GRUESOME WAYS -- CIVILIANS WHO HAVE 
GOVERNMENT TIES, AND OTHERS IT CONSIDERS IDEOLOGICAL 
ENEMIES.  IT AGGRESSIVELY CONDUCTS POLITICAL 
INDOCTRINATIONS IN AREAS IT CONTROLS AND, SINCE 1987. 
HAS DEVELOPED TIES TO NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS AND TO THE 
PEASANT COCA-GROWERS WHOM IT SEEKS TO PROTECT.  ALTHOUGH 
INITIALLY OPERATING AS A GUERRILLA FORCE IN THE RURAL 
AREAS, SENDERO HAS ADDED URBAN TERRORISM AS A COMPLEMENT 
TO ITS RURAL \"PEOPLE\'S WAR\" INSURGENCY. 

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE KILLED SINCE MAY 
1980 -- WHEN SENDERO BEGAN ITS VIOLENT CAMPAIGN -- REACH 
ALMOST 15,000, WITH NEARLY 2,000 KILLED LAST YEAR. 

BACKGROUND 

SENDERO BEGAN AS A MOVEMENT IN THE LATE 1960S AT THE 
NATIONAL UNIVERSITY AT SAN CRISTOBAL OF HUAMANGA IN 
AYACUCHO, A COLONIAL-ERA PROVINCIAL CAPITAL HIGH IN THE 
ANDES, 230 MILES SOUTHEAST OF LIMA.  ABIMAEL GUZMAN 
REYNOSO, ITS FOUNDER WHO IS CALLED, \"PRESIDENT GONZALO, 
END QUOTE BY HIS FOLLOWERS, WAS A PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR 
AT THE UNIVERSITY AND A LEADER OF THE PRO-CHINESE 
FACTION WITHIN PERU\'S COMMUNIST PARTY.  IN 1970, HE AND 
HIS FACTION TOOK THE NAME , \"SHINING PATH OF JOSE CARLOS 
MARIATEGUI, END QUOTE  THE FOUNDER OF THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY IN PERU IN THE 1920S.  SENDERO WENT UNDERGOUND IN 
1978 AND, TWO YEARS LATER, LAUNCHED ITS FIRST VIOLENT 
ATTACK -- ON A RURAL POLLING STATION ON MAY 17, 1980, 
BURNING ALL THE BALLOT BOXES.  SENDERO\'S ANTI-DEMOCRATIC 
NATURE WAS PARTICULARLY APPARENT IN THIS FIRST ATTACK 
SINCE THE 1980 ELECTION MARKED THE RETURN TO CIVILIAN 
RULE IN PERU AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF MILITARY DICTATORSHIP. 

ESTIMATES OF THE NUMBER OF SENDERO MILITANTS RANGE UP 
TO 5,000, WITH MANY MORE SUPPORTERS.  ALTHOUGH SENDERO 
FOCUSES ITS APPEAL ON THE DISADVANTAGED ETHNIC-INDIAN 
SEGMENT OF PERU\'S POPULATION, IT HAS SUCCESSFULLY 
RECRUITED AMONG THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF THE MIDDLE AND 
UPPER CLASSES AS WELL.  IT ALSO SEEKS TO RECRUIT 13-15 
YEAR-OLDS AS ARMED MILITANTS SINCE THEY CAN BE MORE 
EASILY PROPAGANDIZED INTO SUPPORTING WITH UNMITIGATING 
VIOLENCE SENDERO\'S CAUSE. 

IDEOLOGY 

LOOKING TO MAO ZEDONG FOR INSPIRATION, SENDERO 
CONSIDERS ITS PHILOSOPHY AS THE FULLEST DEVELOPMENT OF 
\"SCIENTIFIC COMMUNIST THOUGHT, END QUOTE AND SEEKS TO 
ESTABLISH THROUGH VIOLENT REVOLUTION A \"PEOPLE\'S 
REPUBLIC OF NEW DEMOCRACY END QUOTE IN PERU.  IT DEEPLY 
DISTRUSTS SOVIET AND CUBAN \"REVISIONISM, END QUOTE AND 
HAS DUBBED THE SOVIETS SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS.\" 

SENDERO ALSO DISTRUSTS NICARAGUA, NORTH KOREA AND 
VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER COMMUNIST REGIMES.  IT DENOUNCES 
DENG XIAOPING\'S \"REVISIONISM END QUOTE IN CHINA, VIEWING 
INSTEAD THE DEPOSED \"GANG OF FOUR\" AS HEROES OF THE 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  SENDERO LEADER GUZMAN, ACCORDING 
TO DOCUMENTS FROM THE GROUP\'S FOURTH PLENUM OF THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE, ALSO LABELLED LIBYA\'S MU\'AMMAR 
QADHAFI \"A FAKE.\" 

SENDERO\'S GOAL IS TO DESTROY NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT, 
BUT ALSO THE SOCIAL ORDER.  IT CLAIMS TO CHAMPION THE 
DISADVANTAGED INDIAN PEASANTS, BUT SHOWS NO REMORSE IN 
KILLING THOSE WHO, IN ITS VIEW, DISPLAY A \"PETIT RURAL 
BOURGEOISIE END QUOTE MENTALITY.  SENDERO ALSO 
IMPLEMENTS A STRICT MORAL CODE -- INCLUDING NO SMOKING 
OR DRINKING -- AND DESPITE AIDING NARCOTIC TRAFFICKERS 
AND COCA-GROWERS, IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE EXECUTED THOSE 
UNDER ITS CONTROL FOUND USING DRUGS THEMSELVES. 

STRATEGY AND TACTICS 

SENDERO HAS ATTEMPTED TO TERRORIZE THE POPULATION 
THROUGH VIOLENCE, AND HAS MURDERED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, 
PARLIAMENTARIANS, JUDGES, POLITICAL ACTIVISTS, 
JOURNALISTS, DEVELOPMENT WORKERS (BOTH FOREIGN AND 
NATIVE), PROFESSORS, TEACHERS, PEASANTS, AND 
OCCASIONALLY TOURISTS.  IN 1988 ALONE, IT KILLED 17 
PROVINCIAL MAYORS.  IT HAS ATTACKED GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS 
AND FOREIGN EMBASSIES.  FOLLOWING THE SHOOTING OF TWO 
PARLIAMENTARY DEPUTIES IN MAY OF THIS YEAR (ONE ATTACK 
APPARENTLY CRIMINALLY MOTIVATED), OVER 20 PARLIAMENTARY 
DEPUTIES FROM TWO DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTIES PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED DEATH THREATS OR 
ATTEMPTS ON THEIR LIVES, INDICATING THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
PUBLIC OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THREATENED BY THE TERRORIST 
VIOLENCE. 

RURAL AND URBAN 
 
SIMILAR TO MAO\'S DOCTRINE OF ENCIRCLING 
THE CITIES FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE, SENDERO SEES THE RURAL 
AREAS AS THE PRINCIPAL THEATER FOR ITS ARMED ATTACKS. 
URBAN SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM, HOWEVER, HAVE BECOME 
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO ITS STRATEGY.  IN A JULY 1988 
INTERVIEW (THE FIRST THE SECRETIVE SENDERO LEADER HAD 
GIVEN SINCE 1979), GUZMAN STATED THAT SENDERO MUST BE 
PREPARED FOR WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS THE FINAL ASSAULT 
-- THE TAKING OF THE CITIES.  OTHER DOCUMENTS FROM EARLY 
1988 ALSO INDICATE THAT SENDERO WAS STRESSING URBAN 
SUBVERSION AND TERRORISM AS A COMPLEMENT TO ITS RURAL 
WARFARE. 

THIS NEW URBAN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER, WAS DEALT A SEVERE, 
BUT NOT CRIPPLING, BLOW WHEN OSMAN MOROTE BARRIONUEVO, 
BELIEVED TO BE SENDERO\'S SECOND-IN-COMMAND, WAS ARRESTED 
IN LIMA AND CONVICTED LATER IN 1988.  OTHER RECENT 
SETBACKS WERE THE EARLY AUGUST ARRESTS IN LIMA OF 29 
SENDERO MEMBERS WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE PERUVIAN 
INTERIOR MINISTER, DISMANTLED A MAJOR SUBVERSIVE 
NETWORK, AND THE ARREST LATER IN THE MONTH OF SAMUEL 
VIDAL ESPINOZA, A SENDERO LEADER WHO WAS CHARGED WITH 
SEVERAL CRIMES INCLUDING THE MURDER OF RODRIGO FRANCO, A 
HIGH RANKING GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. 

IN ADDITION TO TERRORISM, SENDERO\'S URBAN STRATEGY 
INCLUDES SEEKING TO INFILTRATE TRADE UNIONS, STUDENT 
ORGANIZATIONS AND LEFTIST POLITICAL PARTIES.  IT HAS 
ALSO BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ARMED STRIKES IN SEVERAL RURAL 
AREAS IN 1989 AND A ONE-DAY GENERAL STRIKE IN JULY WHICH 
PARALYZED TRANSPORTATION IN MUCH OF LIMA. 

ECONOMIC SABOTAGE 
 
SENDERO ALSO PURSUES A CAMPAIGN OF ECONOMIC SABOTAGE 
AND IN 1988 ALONE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTIMATES OF 
LOSSES AS HIGH AS $2.65 BILLION.  IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
NUMEROUS BLACKOUT AND BROWNOUTS IN LIMA AND OTHER AREAS 
OF PERU THROUGH ITS SYSTEMATIC BOMBING OF ELECTRIC 
PYLONS.  THIS CAMPAIGN CULMINATED WHEN SENDERO BLACKED 
OUT LIMA AS WELL AS MANY INTERIOR DEPARTMENTS FOR A 
TOTAL OF 21 DAYS DURING THE MONTH OF AUGUST. 

SENDERO HAS ATTACKED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, 
KILLING GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS WHO WERE WORKING TO UPGRADE 
RURAL FACILITIES.  EXAMPLES INCLUDED THE DECEMBER 1987 
ATTACK ON THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT IRRIGATION 
PROJECT IN AYACUCHO, IN WHICH IT KILLED THREE ENGINEERS, 
INCLUDING THE HEAD OF THE CACHI RIVER IRRIGATION 
PROJECT.  THE PROJECT, WHICH SENDERO HAD VOWED TO BLOCK, 
WOULD IRRIGATE 34,000 ACRES OF FARMLAND AND PROVIDE 
25,000 KILOWATTS OF ELECTRICITY TO THE REGION.  IN JUNE 
1988, SENDERO EXECUTED AN AMERICAN USAID CONTRACT 
EMPLOYEE AND A PERUVIAN COLLEAGUE NEAR QUICHA BAJA WHO 
WERE WORKING ON A LOCAL AGRICULTURAL PROJECT.  IN 
DECEMBER 1988, IT KILLED TWO FRENCH AND TWO PERUVIAN 
ENGINEERS WORKING ON A RURAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT IN THE 
SOUTH CENTRAL DEPARTMENT OF APURIMAC, AND ALSO THAT 
MONTH, ATTACKED A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT RUN BY THE 
EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.  THE EEC RECALLED ITS AID 
EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF THAT ATTACK, AND IN JANUARY OF THIS 
YEAR, THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT WITHDREW ITS DEVELOPMENT 
WORKERS FROM THE COUNTRYSIDE BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF 
SENDERO ATTACKS. 

ALTHOUGH THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WOULD AID THE 
RURAL POPULATIONS WHOSE INTERESTS SENDERO CLAIMS TO 
DEFEND, SENDERO ATTACKS THEM IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE THE 
ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT AND TO PRESENT TO THE PEASANTRY 
NO HOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT UNTIL SENDERO AUTHORITY IS 
ESTABLISHED.  IN THE WORDS OF GUZMAN QUOTED AT SENDERO\'S 
FOURTH PLENUM OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, \"OUR POLICY IS 
TO RAZE TO THE GROUND, TO LEAVE NOTHING...IN A WAR, WHAT 
YOU CAN\'T USE OR CARRY OFF, YOU DESTROY, YOU BURN.\" 

ANTI-ELECTION CAMPAIGN 

SENDERO APPEARS TO HAVE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
THE UPCOMING MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER AND THE 
GENERAL ELECTIONS IN APRIL 1990.  DURING THE SUMMER 
MONTHS, SENDERO TERRORISTS SELECTIVELY ASSASSINATED OVER 
A SCORE OF POLITICAL LEADERS TO INCLUDE LOCAL MAYORS, 
PARTY REPRESENTATIVES AND CANDIDATES.  THROUGH LETHAL 
INTIMIDATION, SENDERO POSES A POTENTIAL THREAT TO PERU\'S 
DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM AS THE CONSTITUTION CALLS FOR A 
CANCELLATION OF THE VOTE COUNT IF 30 PERCENT OF THE 
ELECTORATE ARE PREVENTED FROM CASTING THEIR BALLOTS. 

THE COCA CONNECTION 

SENDERO GUERRILLAS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN 
UPPER HUALLAGA VALLEY, THE LOCALE OF MOST OF PERU\'S 
ILLEGAL COCA PRODUCTION, AND HAVE BECOME A THREAT TO THE 
PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT\'S U.S.-ASSISTED DRUG ERADICATION, 
CROP SUBSTITUTION, AND INTERDICTION EFFORTS.  ATTACKS BY 
BOTH TRAFFICKERS AND SENDERO GUERRILLAS HAVE INCREASED 
SUBSTANTIALLY IN 1989, FORCING THE SUSPENSION OF SOME OF 
THESE OPERATIONS FOR SIX MONTHS. 

SENDERO REPORTEDLY ACTS AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN THE 
PEASANT GROWERS AND THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WINNING HIGHER 
PRICES FOR THE GROWERS, TAKING A CUT OF THE PROFITS, AND 
PROVIDING PROTECTION.  IN A POLICE RAID ON A SUSPECTED 
DRUG TARGET IN THE TOWN OF UCHIZA IN FEBRUARY OF THIS 
YEAR, 45 KILOS OF COCAINE PASTE WERE SEIZED AND EIGHT 
SUSPECTS ARRESTED.  TWO WERE SENDERO MEMBERS. 

SENDERO\'S INVOLVEMENT IN DRUGS BECAME INCREASINGLY 
APPARENT SINCE 1987 WHEN, IN JUNE OF THAT YEAR, THE 
DIRECTOR OF BRAZIL\'S NARCOTICS DIVISION STATED PUBLICLY 
THAT SENDERO WAS INVOLVED WITH THE TRAFFICKERS OPERATING 
ON THE BRAZILIAN BORDER AND RECEIVED LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
MONEY FROM THEM. 

SENDERO, WHICH NOW DOMINATES DOZENS OF VILLAGES IN THE 
REGION AND IS INFLUENTIAL IN SEVERAL LARGER TOWNS, HAS 
PUBLICLY STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT\'S ANTI-NARCOTICS 
OPERATIONS ARE A COVER FOR \"IMPERIALIST EXPANSION\" -- A 
CONVENIENT IDEOLOGICAL RATIONALE FOR ATTACKING THEM. 
SENDERO IS ORGANIZING COCA GROWERS TO PROTEST THE 
ANTI-DRUG OPERATIONS, AND A PRO-SENDERO NEWSWEEKLY HAS 
CONTRIBUTED TO SENDERO\'S DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN BY 
REPORTING THAT CROP ERADICATION HERBICIDES WERE 
POISONING CHILDREN, SEVERAL OF WHOM, THE NEWSWEEKLY 
CLAIMED, HAVE ALREADY DIED.  THE POISONING CLAIMS ARE 
UNTRUE AND EXCEPT FOR A ONE-TIME APPLICATION TEST, 
HERBICIDES HAVE NOT BEEN USED IN THE CROP ERADICATION 
EFFORTS.

SUBJECT: MEETING WITH ANC LEADER THABO MBEKI 
 
REF: STATE 319466 (NOTAL) 

1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT. 

2.  SUMMARY:  ANC INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR THABO 
MBEKI MADE HIS SECOND VISIT TO WASHINGTON IN AS MANY 
MONTHS NOVEMBER 9 - 14.  MIXING CALLS IN WASHINGTON WITH 
TRAVEL ELSEWHERE (HE ARRIVED IN NEW YORK NOVEMBER 1), 
MBEKI OFFICIALLY OPENED THE ANC\'S WASHINGTON OFFICE WITH 
A RECEPTION HOSTED BY CONGRESSMAN DELLUMS ON NOV 9 AND 
HAD MEETINGS AT THE DEPARTMENT ON NOV 13.  IN A MEETING 
WITH ACTING AF ASSISTANT SECRETARY WARREN CLARK, MBEKI 
SAID THAT THE RECENT RELEASE OF POLITICAL PRISONERS HAS 
BEGUN A PROCESS THAT IS BOUND TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT 
ON SOUTH AFRICA\'S FUTURE.  HOWEVER, HE CONTINUED TO ARGUE 
THAT PRESIDENT DE KLERK DOES NOT DESERVE CREDIT FOR THESE 
AND OTHER RECENT POSITIVE MOVES.  EXPANDING ON REMARKS 
MADE IN OCTOBER TO AS COHEN (REFTEL), MBEKI ALSO 
SUGGESTED THE ANC ACCEPTS THE NEED FOR BOTH SIDES TO 
COMPROMISE ON THE ISSUE OF GROUPS.  HE INDICATED, 
HOWEVER, THAT WHILE COMPROMISE ON CULTURAL/EDUCATION 
ISSUES MAY BE POSSIBLE (THOUGH DIFFICULT), SCHEMES TO 
PROTECT WHITE POLITICAL POWER ARE UNACCEPTABLE.  END 
SUMMARY. 

------------------ 
LEGALIZING THE ANC 
------------------ 

3.  HA ASSISTANT SECRETARY SCHIFTER, NSC STAFFER DAVID 
PASSAGE, S/P STAFFER WALTER KANSTEINER, AF/S DIRECTOR 
PERITO AND AF/S OIC GALLUCCI ALSO PARTICIPATED IN CLARK\'S 
MEETING WITH MBEKI.  MBEKI TOLD THE ASSEMBLY THAT ONE 
COULD NOT DISMISS RECENT MOVES BY DE KLERK TO FREE 
POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ALLOW PEACEFUL PROTEST AS SIMPLY 
COSMETIC.  DE KLERK, HE SAID, HAS OBVIOUSLY BEGUN A 
PROCESS THAT CANNOT BE STOPPED.  IT MUST LEAD AT SOME 
POINT TO LEGALIZATION OF THE ANC.  THE RELEASED LEADERS 
ARE UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYONE TO BE LEADERS OF THE ANC.  IN 
FACT, CONTINUED MBEKI, THE ANC WILL ANNOUNCE SHORTLY THAT 
THE RELEASED SENIORS ARE PART OF THE OFFICIAL ANC 
LEADERSHIP AND WILL ACT FOR AND SPEAK FOR THE 
ORGANIZATION IN SOUTH AFRICA.  OTHER POLITICAL PRISONERS 
LESS PROMINENT BUT ALSO JAILED BECAUSE OF THEIR ANC 
ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO READY TO PLAY A ROLE.  THESE ARE THE 
INGREDIENTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL ANC MEMBERSHIP INSIDE SOUTH 
AFRICA. 

4.  MBEKI SUGGESTED THAT THIS INTERNAL ANC WILL OPERATE 
OPENLY AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL THEN HAVE TO LIFT 
RESTRICTIONS ON THE UDF AND OTHERS.  THIS WILL ALLOW THE 
OPPOSITION TO BEGIN ORGANIZING.  THE GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS 
THAT THIS PROCESS MUST LEAD SOON TO NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE 
THE ANC WILL GROW STRONGER AS IT EXPANDS OPEN 
OPERATIONS.  THE SAG ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT IT CANNOT 
RELEASE MANDELA UNTIL IT IS READY FOR NEGOTIATIONS. 
THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO MBEKI, MANDELA\'S RELEASE WILL 
SIGNAL THAT DE KLERK IS READY. 

---------------------- 
EVALUATION OF DE KLERK 
---------------------- 

5.  WHILE HE ACCEPTED THAT THIS PROCESS WILL HAVE GREAT 
IMPORTANCE FOR SOUTH AFRICA, MBEKI REFUSED TO CREDIT DE 
KLERK WITH GOOD INTENTIONS.  REFERRING TO DE KLERK\'S 
MEETING WITH \"THE PRIESTS\" (TUTU, BOESAK AND CHIKANE), 
MBEKI SAID THAT IT IS STILL AN EDUCATION PROCESS FOR 
F.W.  WHILE DE KLERK LECTURED THE PRIESTS FOR THE FIRST 
30 MINUTES OF THEIR MEETING ON HOW THEY HANDLED THE 
PRESS, THERE WAS THEN A GOOD DISCUSSION ON WHAT THE SAG 
MUST DO.  MBEKI REMARKED THAT IN THEIR REPORT ON THE 
MEETING, THE PRIESTS NOTED THAT WHILE THIS DISCUSSION DID 
NOT APPEAR TO BE NEW GROUND FOR GERRIT VILJOEN, DE KLERK 
WAS NOT AWARE OF THE ISSUES.  MBEKI REPEATED HIS ARGUMENT 
THAT DE KLERK REMAINS WEDDED TO THE GROUPS CONCEPT AND 
HAS UNDERTAKEN POSITIVE STEPS ONLY IN RESPONSE TO 
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PRESSURE.  (NOTE:  THIS WAS THE 
CLOSEST MBEKI CAME TO DIRECTLY RAISING THE SANCTIONS 
ISSUE.) 

---------- 
COMPROMISE 
---------- 

6.  IN A WIDE-RANGING DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PLACE OF 
GROUPS IN SOUTH AFRICA, MBEKI NOTED THAT THE POLITICAL 
STRUGGLE IN SOUTH AFRICA IS REALLY ONE BETWEEN THOSE 
COMMITTED TO A NON-RACIAL SOUTH AFRICA AND THOSE WHO SEEK 
THE PROTECTION OF GROUPS.  IN THE END, HE SAID, IT WILL 
COME DOWN TO THESE TWO SIDES FACING EACH OTHER AT THE 
NEGOTIATING TABLE.  BUT MBEKI SAID HE ALSO RECOGNIZED 
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPROMISE ON BOTH SIDES.  HE 
VENTURED THAT IT SEEMS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP SOME FORMULA 
TO GUARANTEE LANGUAGE RIGHTS.  BUT THIS WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT IN PRACTICE SINCE IT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO 
MANY TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM IN WHICH SEPARATE STREAMS OF 
CHILDREN GO OFF TO THEIR SEPARATE AFRIKANER AND 
ZULU-LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.  THE IDEAL SITUATION, MBEKI 
CONTINUED, WOULD BE FOR THE SOUTH AFRICAN POPULATION TO 
MIX.  BUT THE RIGHT TO PEOPLE\'S OWN CULTURE, LANGUAGE AND 
RELIGION MUST BE GRANTED.  ACCEPTING THIS REALITY IS ONLY 
THE FIRST STEP.  THE HARD PART WOULD BE \"CODIFYING\" THESE 
RIGHTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A COMMON SOUTH AFRICA AND 
WITHOUT RETREATING TO SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT. 
 
7.  MBEKI INDICATED THAT POLITICAL COMPROMISE WOULD BE 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.  HE REJECTED OUT-OF-HAND AN UPPER 
HOUSE FOR GROUP REPRESENTATION OR ANY ATTEMPT TO WRITE A 
\"GROUP REPRESENTATION\" CONSTITUTION.  VIS-A-VIS THE 
LATTER, MBEKI SPECIFICALLY REJECTED ANY GROUP-BASED 
FEDERALISM, ARGUING THAT THE ISSUE OF FEDERALISM IN 
GENERAL IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS IN THE SOUTH 
AFRICAN CONTEXT THE EMERGENCE OF RACIAL MINI-STATES.  HE 
INDICATED HOWEVER THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED PROVINCES 
MIGHT MAKE SENSE.  ON THE MATTER OF PARLIAMENTARY 
REPRESENTATION, MBEKI SAID THAT A ZIMBABWE-TYPE SOLUTION 
OF RESERVED SEATS WOULD NOT BE IDEAL.  \"OUR WHITE 
COMPATRIOTS\", HE NOTED, SEE THIS AS PUTTING THE WHITES 
\"OUT OF THE LOOP.\"  BUT IN THE END, SUGGESTED MBEKI, THAT 
MIGHT HAVE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. 

------------------------------ 
HOMELAND LEADERS AND BUTHELEZI 
------------------------------ 

8.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION FROM AMBASSADOR SHIFTER, 
MBEKI REPEATED AGAIN THE NEW ANC HARD LINE ON CHIEF 
BUTHELEZI.  HE SUGGESTED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT EASIER TO 
SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AT THE SIDE OF HOMELAND 
LEADERS SUCH AS TRANSKEI GENERAL HOLOMISA THAN WITH 
BUTHELEZI.  ACCORDING TO MBEKI, HOLOMISA SHARES THE 
NON-RACIAL COMMITMENT AND WOULD NOT SEEK TO REPRESENT THE 
TRANSKEI HOMELAND AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  (MBEKI SAID 
THAT IN ALL, SIX OF THE 10 HOMELANDS LEADERS ARE IN THE 
NON-RACIAL CAMP.  HE ADDED AT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT MEETING 
THAT THE ANC BELIEVED IT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT TO 
INCLUDE HOMELAND LEADERS HOLOMISA AND ENOS MABUZA IN THE 
CONFERENCE ON A DEMOCRATIC FUTURE THAN SMALL BLACK 
CONSCIOUSNESS AND AFRICANIST GROUPS.)  WHILE BUTHELEZI 
WOULD BE IN PRINCIPLE WELCOME IF HE MADE THE SAME 
COMMITMENT, AT PRESENT, MBEKI SAID, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT 
TO SEE HIM IN THIS LIGHT WHILE HE IS NOT COOPERATING IN 
EFFORTS TO BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE IN NATAL. 

----------- 
CEASE FIRE? 
----------- 

9.  IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION, MBEKI SAID THERE HAS BEEN 
NO ANC DECISION TO DESIST FROM VIOLENCE OR UNDERTAKE A DE 
FACTO CEASEFIRE.  RATHER, THE ANC-MK IS CONCENTRATING ON 
BUILDING A MILITARY CAPABILITY WITHIN SOUTH AFRICA.  THE 
ANC RECOGNIZES THAT ITS WAR FROM OUTSIDE SOUTH AFRICA HAS 
BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE.  SO IT HAS GONE FROM BOMBING 
AND HITTING SELECTED TARGETS TO BUILDING A MILITARY MK 
STRUCTURE INSIDE THE COUNTRY. 

------------- 
ANC/PAC TALKS 
------------- 

10.  MBEKI DENIED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ANY ANC/PAC 
TALKS.  HE SAID THAT PAC LEADER JEFF MASEMOLA WAS ADDED 
TO THE LIST OF ANC RELEASEES AT THE REQUEST OF NELSON 
MANDELA.  MANDELA THEN MET WITH MASEMOLA TO ASK HIM TO 
BEHAVE PROPERLY UPON HIS RELEASE SO AS NOT TO REFLECT 
BADLY ON POLITICAL PRISONERS.  MBEKI EXPLAINED THAT 
MASEMOLA HAD FALLEN IN WITH CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHILE 
IMPRISONED.  (MBEKI TOLD AN EARLIER MEETING THAT THE PAC 
IS \"IRRELEVANT.\") 

---------------- 
UNGA RESOLUTIONS 
---------------- 

11.  MBEKI NOTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
COOPERATION AT THE UN TO TRY TO PRODUCE CONSENSUS ON 
POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS.  HE ADDED THAT EVERYONE SHARES THE 
VIEW THAT CONSENSUS AT THE UPCOMING SPECIAL SESSION ON 
APARTHEID IS NECESSARY.  MBEKI ASKED WHAT THE U.S. FINDS 
INAPPROPRIATE IN THE OAU HARARE DECLARATION.  CLARK 
RESPONDED THAT WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE REFERENCES TO AN 
INTERIM GOVERNMENT OR LANGUAGE SUGGESTING THE ANC IS THE 
SOLE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN 
PEOPLE.  CALLS FOR SANCTIONS ARE ALSO UNACCEPTABLE. 
MBEKI SAID THAT SANCTIONS NEED NOT BE MENTIONED IN THE 
SPECIAL SESSION DECLARATION.  HE ALSO THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE 
TO DEAL WITH HOW TO REFER TO THE ARMED STRUGGLE AND TO 
ADDRESS THE INTERIM GOVERNMENT POINT WITHOUT USING THAT 
PARTICULAR PHRASE.  AT THE LEAST, MBEKI CONTINUED, WE 
COULD AGREE ON WHAT ELEMENTS ARE IN THE \"SPIRIT OF 
HARARE\" AND WHAT IS NOT.  HE NOTED THAT MANY OF THE 
ELEMENTS IN THE ANC-DRAFTED DOCUMENT WERE INTENTIONALLY 
DRAWN FROM SECRETARY SHULTZ\'S 1987 SPEECH ON SOUTH AFRICA 
AND BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER HOWE\'S 1988 EFFORT.  THE ANC 
WAS TRYING TO ADDRESS THE REQUEST TO DEFINE BETTER WHAT 
IT IS FOR.  PERITO REPLIED THAT THESE ARE THE ELEMENTS WE 
FOUND POSITIVE AND THE REASON WE SAID SO PUBLICLY.  BUT 
HE EMPHASIZED THAT WE COULD NOT ACCEPT ANYTHING SMACKING 
OF A 435-LIKE EFFORT OR FULL OF PRECONDITIONS.  MBEKI 
INVITED FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE POINTS, PERHAPS IN 
LUSAKA.

1.  (LOU)  THERE FOLLOWS AN ACCOUNTING OF BASIC 
FACTS CONCERNING THE DECEMBER 16-17 INCIDENTS IN 
PANAMA IN WHICH A U.S. MILITARY OFFICER WAS SHOT 
AND KILLED AND ANOTHER BEATEN BY THE PANAMA DEFENSE 
FORCES (PDF).  THE NORIEGA REGIME IS ALREADY 
EMBARKED ON A CAMPAIGN OF DISINFORMATION WHICH THE 
U.S. GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY COUNTER. 
ACTION REQUESTED:  DEMARCHES SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN 
BY ACTION ADDRESSEES WITH HOST GOVERNMENT, LOCAL 
MEDIA AND DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE 
WIDE DISSEMINATION OF THE FACTS.  INFO ADDRESSEES 
MAY ALSO DRAW ON AS APPROPRIATE.  (ALSO SEE PARA 4.) 
 
2.  (U)  THESE UNPROVOKED ACTIONS BY THE PDF COME IN THE 
WAKE OF NORIEGA\'S LATEST MEASURE TO CREATE A FACADE FOR 
HIS CONTINUING CAMPAIGN OF SUPPRESSION OF THE PANAMANIAN 
PEOPLE.  ON DECEMBER 15, AN UNELECTED ASSEMBLY OF 
PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS HAND-PICKED BY NORIEGA-WITHOUT ANY 
LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL OR, INDEED, POPULAR 
LEGITIMACY--DECLARED THAT PANAMA IS IN A STATE OF WAR WITH 
THE U.S. AND PROCLAIMED NORIEGA AS CHIEF OF GOVERNMENT. 
THESE ACTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE AS THE REGIME HAS BECOME 
FURTHER ISOLATED INTERNATIONALLY, UNDERSCORED IN NOVEMBER 
BY THE CONDEMNATION OF THE NORIEGA REGIME BY THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND THE 
DISINVITATION OF THE PDF FROM THE BIENNIAL CONFERENCE OF 
THE AMERICAN ARMIES. 
 
3.  (U)  BEGIN BACKGROUND: 
 
MEMBERS OF THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES OPENED FIRE ON A 
CAR CARRYING FOUR U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS IN THE EVENING OF 
DECEMBER 16, KILLING ONE AMERICAN SERVICEMAN AND INJURING 
ANOTHER.  A THIRD U.S. MILITARY OFFICER, WHO WITNESSED 
THE EVENT, WAS DETAINED AND BEATEN BY THE PDF. 
 
EARLIER IN THE EVENING, THE FOUR OFF-DUTY OFFICERS LEFT 
THE U.S. ARMY BASE AT FORT CLAYTON, UNARMED, IN CIVILIAN 
CLOTHING, AND DRIVING IN A PRIVATELY OWNED CAR, HEADING 
FOR DINNER IN A POPULAR DOWNTOWN PANAMA CITY RESTAURANT. 
ON THEIR WAY DOWNTOWN, THEY GOT LOST AND UNINTENTIONALLY 
DROVE ONTO AVENUE A. NEAR THE PANAMA DEFENSE FORCE\'S 
HEADQUARTERS INSTEAD OF FOURTH OF JULY AVENUE WHICH 
CONNECTS U.S. MILITARY BASES. 
 
AT 9:05PM  ON DECEMBER 16, PANAMA TIME, THEY CAME TO A PDF 
ROADBLOCK AND WERE STOPPED BY ABOUT FIVE UNIFORMED MEMBERS 
OF THE PDF.  A CROWD OF 30 TO 40 CIVILIANS, SPOTTING THE 
U.S. LICENSE PLATES, SWARMED TOWARD THE CAR.  THE PDF 
MEMBERS REACHED THROUGH THE OPEN CAR WINDOWS, TUGGING AT 
THE SERVICEMEN\'S CLOTHES AND SEAT BELTS, AND OPENED SOME 
OF THE CAR DOORS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PULL THE AMERICANS FROM 
THEIR CAR. 
 
THE FEW CARS AHEAD OF THE AMERICANS AT THE ROADBLOCK WERE 
WAVED ON, AND ONE OF THE U.S. OFFICERS ASKED IN SPANISH 
WHY THE AMERICANS WERE BEING SINGLED OUT.  NO ANSWER WAS 
GIVEN.  THE DRIVER OF THE CAR SAW THAT THE PDF WEAPONS -- 
AK-47\'S AND AUTOMATIC RIFLES - HAD BEEN LOADED AND AIMED 
AT THE AMERICANS.  FEARING FOR THEIR SAFETY, THEY CLOSED 
THE WINDOWS AND DROVE AWAY, PAST THE ROADBLOCK. 
 
AS THE CAR SPED AWAY, PDF SOLDIERS OPENED FIRE ON THE 
AMERICANS.  ONE OF THE U.S. OFFICERS WAS WOUNDED AND 
ANOTHER WAS GRAZED AT THE ANKLE BY A BULLET.  THEY DROVE 
TO GORGAS ARMY HOSPITAL, ABOUT FIVE BLOCKS FROM THE U.S. 
SOUTHERN COMMAND HEADQUARTERS AT QUARRY HEIGHTS, WHERE THE 
WOUNDED OFFICER DIED ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER ARRIVING. 
THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN RELEASED, 
PENDING NOTIFICATION OF THEIR NEXT OF KIN. 
 
A U.S. NAVY LIEUTENANT AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN STOPPED IN 
THEIR CAR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE FOUR OFFICERS 
ARRIVED, AT THE SAME CHECKPOINT ON AVENUE A.  THEY GOT 
LOST AFTER DINING OUT WHILE HEADING HOME TO THE U.S. NAVAL 
STATION AT RODMAN, ON THE WEST BANK OF THE PANAMA CANAL 
NEAR HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE.  PDF SOLDIERS STOPPED THEIR 
CAR, ASKED FOR THEIR IDENTIFICATION CARDS, AND TOLD THEM 
TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET UNTIL THEIR 
IDENTIFICATION WAS CHECKED. 
 
WHILE WAITING IN THE CAR, THE COUPLE SAW THE FOUR 
AMERICANS ARRIVE AND LATER WITNESSED THE PDF SOLDIERS 
RAISE THEIR WEAPONS AND AIM AT OFFICERS\' CAR AS IT STARTED 
TO SPEED AWAY.  THE COUPLE SAID THE PDF THEN BEGAN TO FIRE 
AT THE OFFICERS\' CAR. 
 
AFTER THE SHOOTING, THE PDF MEMBERS RETURNED TO THE 
WAITING NAVY OFFICER AND HIS WIFE.  THEY TOOK THE COUPLE 
TO A NEARBY PDF OFFICE, BLINDFOLDED THEM WITH MASKING 
TAPE, AND DROVE THEM IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP TRUCK TO 
ANOTHER LOCATION, WHICH THE NAVY OFFICER BELIEVED TO BE 
THE PDF HEADQUARTERS.  THE COUPLE WAS INTERROGATED FOR 
ABOUT FOUR HOURS. 
 
DURING THE QUESTIONING, THE NAVAL OFFICER WAS REPEATEDLY 
BEATEN AND KICKED IN THE GROIN AND HEAD.  HE WAS TOLD HE 
WOULD BE KILLED IF HE DID NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HIS 
DUTIES AND HIS UNIT.  HIS WIFE WAS SLAMMED AGAINST A WALL 
WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HER HEAD WAS CUT.  AFTER STANDING AT 
THE WALL FOR HALF AN HOUR, WITH HER ARMS ABOVE HER HEAD, 
SHE COLLAPSED ONTO THE FLOOR.  SHE WAS ALSO SEXUALLY 
THREATENED BY PDF SOLDIERS. 
 
FOUR HOURS AFTER THEY WERE STOPPED, THE NAVAL OFFICER AND 
HIS WIFE WERE ESCORTED BY THE PDF TO FOURTH OF JULY AVENUE 
THREE BLOCKS AWAY AND RELEASED.  THEY ARRIVED AT THE NAVAL 
SECURITY OFFICE AT RODMAN ABOUT 2:15AM, DECEMBER 17, WHERE 
THEY PROVIDED STATEMENTS. 
 
THE U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND IMPOSED PERSONNEL MOVEMENT 
LIMITATION \"D\" ABOUT 9:50PM ON DECEMBER 16, DIRECTING ALL 
MILITARY PERSONNEL AND THEIR DEPENDENTS TO STAY OUT OF 
PUBLIC AREAS IN PANAMA.  SECURITY AT ALL U.S. MILITARY 
INSTALLATIONS WAS IMMEDIATELY ENHANCED TO ENSURE THE 
PROTECTION OF U.S. PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES. 
 
SOUTHERN COMMAND AND U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS EXPRESSED 
GRAVE CONCERN OVER THE UNWARRANTED USE OF DEADLY FORCE BY 
THE PDF. 
 
THE PDF\'S PATTERN OF HARRASSMENT OF AMERICANS HAS NOW 
RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF A UNITED STATES SERVICEMAN, THE 
BEATING OF A NAVAL OFFICER, AND THE HARASSMENT OF HIS WIFE. 
 
GENERAL NORIEGA HAS NOW BRUTALIZED THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA, 
CRACKED DOWN ON HIS OWN CIVILIANS AND MILITARY ALIKE AFTER 
THE LAST COUP ATTEMPT, DESIGNATED HIMSELF THE LEADER OF 
THE COUNTRY, AND DECLARED A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED 
STATES.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE CREATED A CLIMATE OF 
AGGRESSION THAT PUTS AMERICAN LIVES AT RISK.  THIS IS 
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE UNITED STATES. 
 
END BACKGROUND. 
 
4.  FOR ACTION ADDRESSEES:  IN ORDER TO IMPRESS ON THE 
GOVERNMENTS OF ACTION ADDRESSEES THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF 
THESE ACTIONS BY THE NORIEGA REGIME, THE SECRETARY HAS 
ASKED THAT ACTION ADDRESSEES MAKE THE DEMARCHE AT THE 
HIGHEST POSSIBLE LEVEL.

THE PRESIDENT DIRECTED UNITED STATES FORCES TO

PANAMA TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES, RESTORE THE DEMOCRATIC 
PROCESS, PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL

THE SITUATION IN PANAMA UNDER NORIEGA HAS REACHED A

AMERICAN LIVES HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED.  THE INTEGRITY OF 
THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES IS AT RISK.  NORIEGA IS UNDER 
INDICTMENT FOR DRUG-RELATED CHARGES.  THE PRESIDENT HAS 
MADE EVERY EFFORT PEACEFULLY TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION 
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND LATIN AMERICAN 
LEADERS.  NORIEGA HAS REJECTED ALL THESE EFFORTS. 

LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED A STATE OF WAR WITH 
THE UNITED STATES.  THE NEXT DAY THE PDF SHOT TO DEATH 
AN UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, WOUNDED ANOTHER, SEIZED 
AND BEAT ANOTHER SERVICEMAN AND SEXUALLY THREATENED HIS 
WIFE.  UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESIDENT DECIDED 
HE MUST ACT TO PREVENT FURTHER VIOLENCE.  OUR TROOPS 
WILL USE ONLY THE FORCE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE 
OBJECTIVES AND WILL BE WITHDRAWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

AT APPROXIMATELY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT, THE 
DEMOCRATICALLY-ELECTED LEADERS OF PANAMA--PRESIDENT 
ENDARA AND VICE PRESIDENTS ARIAS CALDERON AND FORD--WERE 
SWORN IN AND ASSUMED THEIR RIGHTFUL POSITIONS.  THEY 
WELCOME AND SUPPORT OUR ACTIONS AND HAVE STATED THEIR 
INTENTION TO INSTITUTE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT 
IMMEDIATELY.  THE UNITED STATES HAS RECOGNIZED THAT 
GOVERNMENT, IS RESTORING NORMAL RELATIONS, AND WILL 
COOPERATE TO REBUILD A FREE AND PROSPEROUS PANAMA.  END 
TEXT. 

4.  (C)  YOU SHOULD ALSO MAKE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 

--  THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER 
EXHAUSTING EVERY AVAILABLE DIPLOMATIC AND MULTI-LATERAL 
MEANS TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS. 

--  IN RECENT DAYS, THE CRISIS HAS GROWN FAR MORE 
DANGEROUS.  NORIEGA HAS ACTED INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE, 
UNPREDICTABLE, AND DANGEROUS. 

--  THE U.S. HAD INCREASING FEAR OF NEW  MORE 
THREATENING ACTS OF VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST AMERICANS. 

--  THE U.S. WILL ONLY USE FORCE AS REQUIRED TO 
ARREST NORIEGA AND RESTRAIN THE PDF FROM COMING TO HIS 
RESCUE.  THE U.S. HOPES TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

--  THE U.S. CONSULTED WITH THE LEADERS OF THE 
PANAMANIAN OPPOSITION ELECTED IN THE MAY 7TH ELECTIONS 
AND THEY APPROVED OF THIS ACTION.  THEY HAVE BEEN SWORN 
IN AND HAVE ANNOUNCED THEY WILL BE FORMING A GOVERNMENT 
IMMEDIATELY.  THE U.S. HAS RECOGNIZED THIS GOVERNMENT. 

--  THESE LEADERS WERE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING OBSERVERS FROM DOZENS 
OF NATIONS, AS THE RIGHTFUL VICTORS IN THE PANAMANIAN 
ELECTIONS.  THEY WARRANT RECOGNITION BY HOST GOVERNMENT 
AND THE U.S. URGES HOST GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND SUCH 
RECOGNITION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  THIS WILL IN ITSELF 
HELP STABILIZE THE SITUATION, REDUCE THE PROSPECTS FOR 
ADDITIONAL VIOLENCE, AND PERMIT THE U.S. TO WITHDRAW ITS 
FORCES QUICKLY. 

--  THE U.S. IS FULLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE 
PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  INDEED, ONE ADDITIONAL REASON 
THE PRESIDENT HAD TO ACT WAS TO SAFEGUARD THE CANAL AND 
UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY OF THE TREATIES. 

--  THE PRESIDENT TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AS A LAST 
RESORT.  HE DID SO FOR 4 REASONS: 

I. TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES; 
II. TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY; 
III. TO ARREST AN INDICTED DRUG TRAFFICKER; AND 
IV. TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES. 

--  WE HOPE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT THIS 
ACTION.  IT IS IMPORTANT, IN PARTICULAR, THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RALLY AROUND THE NEW DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, JUST AS IT DID AROUND ENDARA, 
ARIAS CALDERON, AND FORD WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED AND 
BRUTALIZED FOLLOWING THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS. 

--  THE U.S. INTENDS TO HELP THE NEW GOVERNMENT 
RESTORE PANAMA\'S ECONOMY.  YOUR SUPPORT WOULD BE 
IMPORTANT AND WELCOME IN THIS EFFORT. 

--  U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU INFORMED AS 
EVENTS DEVELOP. 

5.  FOR NICARAGUA AND CUBA: 

THE SECURITY OF YOUR DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN PANAMA IS 
NOT THREATENED IN ANY WAY.  THE U.S. HAS NO INTENTION TO 
ENLARGE THIS ACTION BEYOND PANAMA AND WE EXPECT YOUR 
GOVERNMENT TO ACT ACCORDINGLY. 

6.  FOR NICARAGUA ONLY: 

THE U.S. REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE ESQUIPULAS, TESORO 
BEACH, AND TELA ACCORDS AND TO RESPECT THE RESULTS OF A 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTION IN NICARAGUA NO MATTER WHO WINS. 
THIS ACTION IN PANAMA SHOULD NOT DIVERT EITHER OF OUR 
NATIONS FROM PURSUING A DIPLOMATIC AND POLITICAL 
RESOLUTION TO THE CONFLICTS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. BAKER

2.  BEGIN TEXT: 

MR. CHAIRMAN: 

 I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN WITH A PROCEDURAL POINT.  THE U.S. 
IS VERY PLEASED THAT THE OUTLAW REGIME OF NORIEGA HAS 
GIVEN WAY TO A GOVERNMENT THAT REFLECTS THE WILL OF THE 
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE. 

 I THINK WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THERE IS A RAPIDLY CHANGING 
AND VERY COMPLEX SITUATION IN PANAMA.  THE ORIGIN AND 
NATURE OF THIS CRISIS NEED TO BE EXPLORED.  IN THE VIEW OF 
MY GOVERNMENT, THE LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATIVE OF PANAMA IS 
NOT PRESENT HERE IN THIS MEETING. 

 THE PRESIDENT THIS MORNING DIRECTED UNITED STATES 
MILITARY FORCES TO EXECUTE AT 1:00 AM THIS MORNING 
MISSIONS IN PANAMA DESIGNED TO PROTECT AMERICAN LIVES AND 
TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER OF THIS 
ORGANIZATION, AND OF ARTICLES 51 AND 52 OF THE CHARTER OF 
THE UNITED NATIONS, I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO BRIEF YOU ON 
THIS ACTION OF THE UNITED STATES. 

 UNITED STATES FORCES HAVE EXERCISED THEIR INHERENT RIGHT 
OF SELF-DEFENSE UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BY TAKING ACTION 
IN PANAMA IN RESPONSE TO ARMED ATTACKS BY FORCES UNDER THE 
DIRECTION OF MANUEL NORIEGA. 

 THE SITUATION IN PANAMA UNDER NORIEGA HAD BECOME 
UNSUSTAINABLE.  35,000 CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES LIVE 
IN PANAMA.  THEIR LIVES WERE SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED.  THE 
INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES WAS AT RISK AS THE 
RESULT OF THE PRESSURES, ABUSES, AND -- YES -- FORCE OF A 
MAN WHO IS UNDER INDICTMENT FOR DRUG-RELATED CHARGES.  THE 
PRESIDENT MADE EVERY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION 
PEACEFULLY THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES AND LATIN AMERICAN 
LEADERS.  MR. NORIEGA REJECTED ALL THESE EFFORTS. 

 I AM CERTAIN THAT MANY OF YOU HEARD PRESIDENT BUSH AT 
7:20 AM THIS MORNING.  I ASK YOUR INDULGENCE: 

 BEGIN QUOTE: 

 MY FELLOW CITIZENS, LAST NIGHT I ORDERED U.S. MILITARY 
FORCES TO PANAMA.  NO PRESIDENT TAKES SUCH ACTION 
LIGHTLY.  THIS MORNING, I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT I DID AND 
WHY I DID IT. 

 FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS, THE UNITED STATES, NATIONS OF LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO RESOLVE 
THE CRISIS IN PANAMA.  THE GOALS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE 
BEEN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF AMERICANS, TO DEFEND 
DEMOCRACY IN PANAMA, TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO 
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY.  MANY 
ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS THROUGH 
DIPLOMACY AND NEGOTIATIONS.  ALL WERE REJECTED BY THE 
DICTATOR OF PANAMA, GENERAL MANUEL NORIEGA, AN INDICTED 
DRUG TRAFFICKER. 

 LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED HIS MILITARY DICTATORSHIP 
TO BE IN A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES AND 
PUBLICLY THREATENED THE LIVES OF AMERICANS IN PANAMA.  THE 
VERY NEXT DAY, FORCES UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOT AND KILLED AN 
UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, WOUNDED ANOTHER, ARRESTED AND 
BRUTALLY BEAT A THIRD AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, AND THEN 
BRUTALLY INTERROGATED HIS WIFE, THREATENED HER WITH SEXUAL 
ABUSE. 

 THAT WAS ENOUGH. 

 GENERAL NORIEGA\'S RECKLESS THREATS AND ATTACKS UPON 
AMERICANS IN PANAMA CREATED AN IMMINENT DANGER TO THE 
35,000 AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA.  AS PRESIDENT, I HAVE 
NO HIGHER OBLIGATION THAN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS.  AND THAT IS WHY I DIRECTED OUR ARMED 
FORCES TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA 
AND TO BRING GENERAL NORIEGA TO JUSTICE IN THE UNITED 
STATES.  I CONTACTED THE BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP OF CONGRESS 
LAST NIGHT AND INFORMED THEM OF THIS DECISION, AND AFTER 
TAKING THIS ACTION, I ALSO TALKED WITH LEADERS IN LATIN 
AMERICA, THE CARIBBEAN, AND THOSE OF OTHER U.S. ALLIES. 

 AT THIS MOMENT, U.S. FORCES, INCLUDING FORCES DEPLOYED 
FROM THE UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT, ARE ENGAGED IN ACTION 
IN PANAMA.  THE UNITED STATES INTENDS TO WITHDRAW THE 
FORCES NEWLY DEPLOYED TO PANAMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
OUR FORCES HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES COURAGEOUSLY AND 
SELFLESSLY.  AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, I SALUTE EVERY ONE OF 
THEM AND THANK THEM ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY. 

 TRAGICALLY, SOME AMERICANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES ALREADY 
IN DEFENSE OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS, IN DEFENSE OF 
DEMOCRACY.  MY HEART GOES OUT TO THEIR FAMILIES.  WE ALSO 
REGRET AND MOURN THE LOSS OF INNOCENT PANAMANIANS. 

 THE BRAVE PANAMANIANS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE IN THE 
ELECTIONS HELD LAST MAY -- PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA AND 
VICE PRESIDENTS CALDERON AND FORD -- HAVE ASSUMED THE 
RIGHTFUL LEADERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRY.  YOU REMEMBER THOSE 
HORRIBLE PICTURES OF NEWLY-ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT FORD, 
COVERED HEAD TO TOE WITH BLOOD, BEATEN MERCILESSLY BY 
SO-CALLED \"DIGNITY BATALLIONS.\"  WELL, THE UNITED STATES 
TODAY RECOGNIZES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF 
PRESIDENT ENDARA.  I WILL SEND OUR AMBASSADOR BACK TO 
PANAMA IMMEDIATELY. 

 KEY MILITARY OBJECTIVES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.  MOST 
ORGANIZED RESISTANCE HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.  BUT THE 
OPERATION IS NOT OVER YET.  GENERAL NORIEGA IS IN HIDING. 
AND NEVERTHELESS, YESTERDAY, A DICTATOR RULED PANAMA; AND 
TODAY, CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED LEADERS GOVERN. 

 I HAVE TODAY DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY AND 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO LIFT THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS WITH 
RESPECT TO THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF 
PANAMA, AND IN COOPERATION WITH THAT GOVERNMENT, TO TAKE 
STEPS TO EFFECT AN ORDERLY UNBLOCKING OF PANAMANIAN 
GOVERNMENT ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES.  I AM FULLY 
COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE PANAMA CANAL TREATIES AND TO 
TURN OVER THE CANAL TO PANAMA IN THE YEAR 2000. 

 THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN AND THE COOPERATION OF A NEW 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN PANAMA WILL PERMIT US TO HONOR 
THESE COMMITMENTS.  AS SOON AS THE NEW GOVERNMENT 
RECOMMENDS A QUALIFIED PANAMANIAN CANDIDATE TO BE 
ADMINISTRATOR OF THE CANAL AS CALLED FOR IN THE TREATIES, 
I WILL SUBMIT THIS NOMINEE TO THE SENATE FOR EXPEDITED 
CONSIDERATION. 

 I AM COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONS OF THIS HEMISPHERE.  I WILL CONTINUE TO 
SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF THIS REGION THROUGH 
DIALOGUE AND MULTILATERAL DIPLOMACY. 

 I TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER REACHING THE CONCLUSION 
THAT EVERY OTHER AVENUE WAS CLOSED AND THE LIVES OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS WERE IN GRAVE DANGER.  I HOPE THAT THE 
PEOPLE OF PANAMA WILL PUT THIS DARK CHAPTER OF 
DICTATORSHIP BEHIND THEM AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER AS 
CITIZENS OF A DEMOCRATIC PANAMA WITH THIS GOVERNMENT THAT 
THEY, THEMSELVES, HAVE ELECTED. 

 THE UNITED STATES IS EAGER TO WORK WITH THE PANAMANIAN 
PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP TO REBUILD THEIR 
ECONOMY.  THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WANT DEMOCRACY, PEACE, AND 
THE CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN DIGNITY AND FREEDOM.  THE 
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SEEK ONLY TO SUPPORT THEM IN 
PURSUIT OF THESE NOBLE GOALS. 

 END QUOTE. 

MR. CHAIRMAN: 

 PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK THIS ACTION ONLY AFTER EXHAUSTING 
EVERY AVAILABLE DIPLOMATIC AND MULTILATERAL MEANS TO 
RESOLVE THIS CRISIS.  FROM THE MOMENT NORIEGA HAD BRUTALLY 
ANNULLED THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS, PRESIDENT BUSH SUPPORTED THE 
ARDUOUS EFFORTS OF THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES TO 
RESOLVE THE CRISIS BY FACILITATING A PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF 
POWER THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS. 

 DESPITE THE MOST DEDICATED EFFORTS OF THE TWENTY-FIRST 
MEETING OF CONSULTATION OF FOREIGN MINISTERS, NORIEGA 
STEADFASTLY DENIED THE RIGHTS OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE TO 
CHOOSE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.  INSTEAD, HE FLOUTED THE 
DECISIONS OF THE MEETING OF CONSULTATION AS WELL AS THE 
CONSTITUTION OF PANAMA, WHICH CALLED FOR A TRANSFER OF 
POWER, THROUGH DEMOCRATIC MEANS, BY SEPTEMBER 1. 

 NORIEGA\'S SYSTEMIC AND SYSTEMATIC VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA PROMPTED THE OAS GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY LAST MONTH TO TAKE THE UNUSUAL STEP OF 
SPECIFICALLY ENDORSING THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE SPECIAL 
REPORT ON PANAMA OF THE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS, A REPORT THAT CAN ONLY BE CHARACTERIZED AS 
\"DEVASTATING\" IN ITS IMPACT.  THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A 
RESOLUTION WHICH RESOLVES \"TO EXPRESS ITS DEEP CONCERN FOR 
THE SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES 
IN PANAMA, ESPECIALLY THOSE BEARING ON THE FULL OBSERVANCE 
OF CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, AS THE INTER-AMERICAN 
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS STATED IN ITS SPECIAL 
REPORT ON THAT COUNTRY.\" 

 IN RECENT DAYS, THE CRISIS HAS GROWN FAR MORE DANGEROUS. 
NORIEGA HAS ACTED IN AN INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE, 
UNPREDICTABLE, AND DANGEROUS MANNER.  FIRST HE DECLARED 
HIMSELF \"MAXIMUM LEADER\" LAST FRIDAY, THEN HE DECLARED A 
STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.  FOLLOWING THAT 
DECLARATION OF WAR, THE PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES FELT 
FREE TO FIRE AT MILITARY PERSONNEL OF THE UNITED STATES 
STATIONED IN PANAMA UNDER THE CANAL TREATIES. 

 THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS WHICH RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF AN 
UNARMED MILITARY OFFICER OF THE UNITED STATES AND PHYSICAL 
ATTACKS ON OTHER U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL PROVOKED FEARS OF 
NEW, MORE THREATENING ACTS OF VIOLENCE DIRECTED AGAINST 
OUR CITIZENS IN PANAMA. 

 NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS ACTED, UNITED STATES FORCES 
WILL TAKE ONLY THE MEASURES NECESSARY TO ASSURE THE SAFETY 
OF AMERICANS AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL 
TREATIES.  ALL FEASIBLE MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO 
MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CIVILIAN DAMAGE OR CASUALTIES.  THE 
U.S. HOPES TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

 THE UNITED STATES IS FULLY COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING THE 
PANAMA CANAL TREATIES.  INDEED, AN ADDITIONAL REASON THE 
PRESIDENT WAS FORCED TO ACT WAS TO SAFEGUARD THE CANAL AND 
UPHOLD THE LONG-TERM INTEGRITY OF THE TREATIES UNDER 
STEADY ATTACK FROM THE DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY 
NORIEGA. 

 THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED 
GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT ENDARA.  IT IS IMPORTANT, IN 
PARTICULAR, THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RALLY AROUND 
THE NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, JUST AS IT DID 
WHEN INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS SUPPORTED ENDARA, ARIAS 
CALDERON, AND FORD WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED AND BRUTALIZED 
FOLLOWING THE MAY 7 ELECTIONS. 

 WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND SUPPORT OUR ACTIONS 
AS DOES THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT OF PANAMA, 
WHICH WE CONSULTED AND WHICH SUPPORTS OUR ACTION.  WE 
PLEDGE OUR SUPPORT FOR A COMPLETE TRANSITION TO ELECTED 
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT IN PANAMA, TO THE FULL PROTECTION OF 
THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE, AND TO THE 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COUNTRY.  WE ARE 
DEALING WITH AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED AND COMPLEX 
SITUATION AND FAST BREAKING DEVELOPMENTS. 

 THE UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE COUNCIL 
INFORMED AS EVENTS DEVELOP. 

 THANK YOU.

SUBJECT: TFPM02:  SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING ON PANAMA 
 
1.  (U)  SUMMARY:  SECURITY COUNCIL MET EVENING DEC. 20 
TO CONSIDER THE SITUATION IN PANAMA.  SOVIET, CHINESE 
AND NICARAGUAN DELEGATIONS CONDEMNED U.S. INTERVENTION. 
FRANCE, UK AND CANADA FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO UPHOLD THE 
WILL OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE AND SUPPORTED U.S. 
ACTIONS.  AMB. PICKERING MADE U.S. STATEMENT WHICH 
HIGHLIGHTED RECENT ATTACKS ON AMERICANS, THE DECLARATION 
OF A STATE OF WAR BY NORIEGA, U.S. CONSULTATION WITH 
DEMOCRATIC PANAMANIAN LEADERS AND NORIEGA\'S BLATANT 
ROBBERY OF THE ELECTIONS.  COUNCIL WILL MEET AGAIN 11 AM 
DEC. 21.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C)  DURING INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS PRIOR TO THE SC 
MEETING, SC MEMBERS DISAGREED REGARDING HOW TO PROCEED. 
U.S. ARGUED THAT A FORMAL MEETING SHOULD BE PUT OFF 
UNTIL DEC 21 IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE OAS TO CONSIDER THE 
ISSUE.  NAM SC MEMBERS, THE SOVIETS AND THE CHINESE ALL 
ARGUED FOR AN IMMEDIATE FORMAL SESSION OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL.  AS A COMPROMISE, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE 
COUNCIL WOULD MEET FORMALLY AT 8 PM, BUT THAT DEBATE 
WOULD BE LIMITED TO THE COUNTRY THAT REQUESTED THE 
MEETING -- NICARAGUA -- AND SC MEMBERS. 
 
3.  (U)  AT THE FORMAL SESSION, NICARAGUA, THE USSR AND 
THE CHINESE CONDEMNED U.S. INTERVENTION AND THE USE OF 
FORCE AS CONTRARY TO THE UN CHARTER.  NICARAGUA 
CHARACTERIZED U.S. ACTIONS AS NOT ONLY A VIOLATION OF 
PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY, BUT AS A THREAT TO ALL OF 
CENTRAL AMERICA. 
 
4.  (U)  FRENCH DELEGATION SAID THEY REGRETTED THE NEED 
FOR INTERVENTION BUT THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WAS 
NORIEGA\'S REFUSAL TO ABIDE BY THE RESULTS OF FREE 
ELECTIONS IN PANAMA.  THE FRENCH SUGGESTED THAT THE SC 
PRESIDENT ISSUE A STATEMENT REAFFIRMING THE RIGHT OF THE 
PEOPLE OF PANAMA TO EXPRESS THEIR WILL.  THE CANADIANS 
SAID THAT IN THE CASE OF NORIEGA INTERVENTION WAS 
JUSTIFIED AND THAT CANADA SUPPORTED U.S. ACTIONS.  UK 
STRESSED NORIEGA\'S SUBVERSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS 
AND EXPRESSED FULL SUPPORT FOR THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE 
U.S. AND FOR THE RESTORATION OF A LEGAL AND DEMOCRATIC 
GOVERNMENT IN PANAMA. 
 
5.  (U)  AMB. PICKERING MADE THE U.S. STATEMENT, WHICH 
STRESSED THAT THE U.S. ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE IN RESPONSE 
TO ARMED ATTACKS BY NORIEGA\'S FORCES.  THE U.S. HAD MADE 
REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE CRISIS BY DIPLOMATIC 
MEANS BUT NORIEGA HAD REJECTED ALL SUCH ATTEMPTS.  THE 
USG CONSULTED WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED 
LEADERSHIP, WHO APPROVED OF OUR ACTIONS.  TEXT OF U.S. 
STATEMENT IN PARA 6. 
 
6.  (U)  TEXT OF U.S. STATEMENT: 
 
BEGIN TEXT:  MR. PRESIDENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 
51 OF THE UNITED NATIONS CHARTER UNITED STATES FORCES 
HAVE EXERCISED THEIR INHERENT RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE 
UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW BY TAKING ACTION IN PANAMA IN 
RESPONSE TO ARMED ATTACKS BY FORCES UNDER THE DIRECTION 
OF MANUEL NORIEGA.  THE ACTION IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT 
AMERICAN LIVES AS WELL AS TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF 
THE UNTIED STATES TO DEFEND THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA 
CANAL TREATIES.  WE SHARE THE SORROW OF ALL THAT THESE 
NECESSARY ACTIONS HAVE CAUSED A LOSS OF LIFE AND DAMAGE. 
 
THE SITUATION IN PANAMA HAS BEEN INTOLERABLE.  FOR 
NEARLY TWO YEARS, THE UNITED STATES, THE NATIONS OF 
LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN WORKED TOGETHER TO TRY 
TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN PANAMA.  THE GOALS OF THE 
UNITED STATES REMAINED UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD 
- TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF AMERICANS, TO DEFEND 
DEMOCRACY IN PANAMA, TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO 
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY. 
REPEATED ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SOLVE THE CRISIS THROUGH 
DIPLOMATIC MEANS AND NEGOTIATIONS.  NORIEGA TURNED THEM 
ALL DOWN. 
 
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CRISIS IN PANAMA HAS BEEN THE 
STRUGGLE BETWEEN NORIEGA AND HIS THUGS AND THE PEOPLE OF 
PANAMA.  HIS RUTHLESS CABAL REPEATEDLY OBSTRUCTED THE 
WILL OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WHICH HAD BEEN EXPRESSED 
IN FREE ELECTIONS.  AS A RESULT OF LAST NIGHT\'S ACTIONS 
THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN REVERSED.  THE FREELY ELECTED 
LEADERS OF PANAMA PRESIDENT GUILLERMO ENDARA AND VICE 
PRESIDENTS ARIAS CALDERON AND FORD HAVE ASSUMED THE 
RIGHTFUL LEADERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRY. 
 
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE UNTIED STATES GOVERNMENT 
CONSULTED WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERSHIP 
PRIOR TO LAST EVENING\'S ACTIONS AND THAT THEY APPROVED 
OF OUR STEPS. 
 
SOME MAY ASK WHY MY GOVERNMENT HAD TO TAKE MILITARY 
ACTION NOW.  PRESIDENT BUSH PROVIDED THE ANSWER THIS 
MORNING:  \"LAST FRIDAY, NORIEGA DECLARED HIS MILITARY 
DICTATORSHIP TO BE IN A STATE OF WAR WITH THE UNITED 
STATES AND PUBLICLY THREATENED THE LIVES OF AMERICANS 
LIVING IN PANAMA.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, FORCES UNDER HIS 
COMMAND SHOT AND KILLED AN UNARMED AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, 
WOUNDED ANOTHER, ARRESTED AND BRUTALLY BEAT A THIRD 
AMERICAN SERVICEMAN, AND THEN BRUTALLY INTERROGATED HIS 
WIFE, THREATENING HER WITH SEXUAL ABUSE. 
 
THAT WAS ENOUGH. 
 
GENERAL NORIEGA\'S RECKLESS THREATS AND ATTACKS UPON 
AMERICANS IN PANAMA CREATED AN IMMINENT DANGER TO THE 
35,000 AMERICAN CITIZENS IN PANAMA.  AS PRESIDENT, I 
HAVE NO HIGHER OBLIGATION THAN TO SAFEGUARD THE LIVES OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS.  AND THAT IS WHY I DIRECTED OUR ARMED 
FORCES TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS IN 
PANAMA AND TO BRING GENERAL NORIEGA TO JUSTICE IN THE 
UNITED STATES.\" 
 
I WANT FOR A FEW MINUTES TO NOTE THAT THE TURN TOWARD 
DEMOCRACY THAT CHARACTERIZES OUR ERA BEGAN IN THIS 
HEMISPHERE.  IN RECENT YEARS, NATION AFTER NATION HAS 
DECIDE TO FOLLOW THE DEMOCRATIC PATH.  TOGETHER, HERE IN 
THE AMERICAS, WE ARE BUILDING THE WORLD\'S FIRST 
DEMOCRATIC HEMISPHERE. 
 
THE PEOPLE OF PANAMA BEGAN THEIR HISTORIC JOURNEY TOWARD 
DEMOCRACY WHEN THEY SPOKE CLEARLY ON MAY 7 OF THIS 
YEAR.  THEY VOTED FOR NATIONAL DIGNITY.  THEY VOTED TO 
END A BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP.  THEY VOTED TO BE FREE.  THEY 
HAVE A RIGHT TO BE FREE. NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO DENY THAT 
FREEDOM. 
 
NEVERTHELESS, THAT VOTE FOR DEMOCRACY WAS MET WITH 
NORIEGA\'S IRON PIPES AND RIFLE BUTTS, HIRED MOBS AND 
PRISON CELLS.  THE WHOLE WORLD DENOUNCED THE VIOLATION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS WHICH WE WITNESSED IN PANAMA AS DID THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.  INDEED THE IMAGES OF 
COURAGE AND THE IMAGES OF BLOOD FROM THAT HISTORIC WEEK 
IN PANAMA WILL ALWAYS BE ETCHED IN OUR MEMORY. 
 
THE QUESTION BEFORE US HAS NEVER BEEN OUR COMMITMENT TO 
PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY NOT IS IT TODAY.  FOR THE 
SOVEREIGN WILL OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE IS WHAT WE ARE 
HERE DEFENDING.  THE QUESTION BEFORE US WAS OUR 
COMMITMENT TO UPHOLD THOSE HISTORIC TREATIES FROM THE 
DAY THEY WERE SIGNED. 
 
AND LET US BE CLEAR ABOUT ONE THING, IF NOTHING ELSE. 
NORIEGA DID NOT STEAL THE MAY 7 ELECTION BECAUSE OF 
\"SANCTIONS\" OR THE LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF TREATY 
RIGHTS.  HE STOLE THE ELECTION BECAUSE HE LOST IT, AND 
ATTEMPTS TO SHIFT THE FOCUS FROM THAT OVERWHELMING FACT 
ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN DELIBERATE OBFUSCATION. 
THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE AT STAKE IN THIS DEBATE OVER 
PANAMA -- THE DISGRACE, THE TERRIBLE EVIL OF DRUG 
TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE BEEN REMINDED AGAIN OF THE 
TERRIBLE PRICE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN -- AND WHOLE 
SOCIETIES -- PAY BECAUSE THESE MONSTERS -- THESE DRUG 
TRAFFICKERS -- CONTINUE IN OUR MIDST. 
 
THIS IS A WAR AS DEADLY AND AS DANGEROUS AS ANY FOUGHT 
WITH ARMIES MASSED ACROSS BORDERS; THE SURVIVAL OF 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONS IS AT STAKE. 
 
COUNTRIES THAT PROVIDE SAFE HAVEN AND SUPPORT FOR THE 
INTERNATIONAL DRUG TRAFFICKING CARTELS MENACE THE PEACE 
AND SECURITY JUST AS SURELY AS IF THEY WERE USING THEIR 
OWN CONVENTIONAL MILITARY FORCES TO ATTACK OUR 
SOCIETIES.  THE TRUTH IS, AND EVERY ONE OF US KNOWS IT, 
GENERAL NORIEGA TURNED PANAMA INTO A HAVEN FOR DRUG 
TRAFFICKERS AND A CENTER FOR MONEY LAUNDERING AND 
 
TRANS-SHIPMENT OF COCAINE.  GENERAL NORIEGA COULD NOT BE 
PERMITTED FALSELY TO WRAP HIMSELF IN THE FLAG OF 
PANAMANIAN SOVEREIGNTY WHILE THE DRUG CARTELS WITH WHICH 
HE IS ALLIED INTERVENE THROUGHOUT THIS HEMISPHERE. 
THAT, MR. PRESIDENT, IS AGGRESSION.  IT IS AGGRESSION 
AGAINST US ALL, AND NOW IT IS BEING BROUGHT TO AN END. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT I ALSO WISH TO POINT OUT THAT THE UNITED 
STATES HAS BOTH THE RIGHT, AND FOR THAT MATTER, THE DUTY 
TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE PANAMA CANAL UNDER ARTICLE 4 
OF THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY.  THE BASIC UNITED STATES\' 
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO OPERATED AND DEFEND THE PANAMA 
CANAL UNTIL ITS TRANSFER TO PANAMA AT THE END OF THIS 
CENTURY.  EVEN DURING THE NORIEGA REGIME\'S ILLEGAL 
SEIZURE OF POWER THE UNITED STATES HAS CONTINUED TO DO 
WHAT IT HAS DONE SINCE THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE 
TREATY A DECADE AGO - PROVIDING FOR THE SAFE AND ORDERLY 
TRANSIT OF VESSELS THROUGH THE CANAL WHILE ASSURING 
INCREASING PANAMANIAN PARTICIPATION IN ITS MANAGEMENT 
AND OPERATION. 
 
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS THE NORIEGA REGIME ENGAGED IN A 
SYSTEMATIC CAMPAIGN TO HARASS AND INTIMIDATE UNITED 
STATES AND PANAMANIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE PANAMA CANAL 
COMMISSION AND THE UNITED STATES FORCES.  IN THE LAST 
YEAR ALONE, THERE HAVE BEEN OVER 300 VIOLATIONS OF U.S. 
MILITARY BASES BY ARMED PANAMANIAN DEFENSE FORCES 
PERSONNEL; OVER 400 U.S. PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN DETAINED 
AND 140 U.S. PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN ENDANGERED.  THIS 
PROVOCATIVE AND INTOLERABLE BEHAVIOR REACHED A PEAK LAST 
FRIDAY.  IT THREATENED AMERICAN AND PANAMANIAN LIVES AS 
WELL AS CANAL OPERATIONS. 
 
AS THE COUNCIL DEBATES THIS ISSUE IT IS WORTH NOTING 
THAT CHAPTER VIII OF THE CHARTER CALLS UPON MEMBER 
STATES TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO USE REGIONAL AGENCIES TO 
SOLVE REGIONAL PROBLEMS.  THE LANGUAGE OF ARTICLE 52 IS 
STRIKING IN ITS USE OF THE WORD \"SHALL\" IN THIS 
CONTEXT.  THE USE OF \"SHALL\" LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR 
DOUBT THAT MEMBERS OF A REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT ARE OBLIGED 
TO REFER REGIONAL DISPUTES TO REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND 
THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL IS OBLIGATED TO ENCOURAGE THIS 
RECOURSE TO REGIONAL AGENCIES.  CURRENTLY THE 
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES IS ENGAGED IN THAT 
EFFORT. 
 
ASIDE FROM THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THAT FLOW FROM THE USE 
OF \"SHALL\" IN CHAPTER VIII, COMMON SENSE DICTATES THAT 
WHERE THERE IS A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION AND A REGIONAL 
PROBLEM, RECOURSE SHOULD BE TO THE REGIONAL ORGANIZATION. 
THIS NEED NOT AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE UN INVOLVEMENT. 
HOWEVER, THE RISK OF WASTEFUL DUPLICATION IS OBVIOUS. 
FAR MORE SERIOUS IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR REACHING 
INCONSISTENT CONCLUSIONS.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO RESOLVING 
PROBLEMS NOT FURTHER COMPLICATE THEM. 
 
THE PURPOSE OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS CRISIS IS CLEAR 
AND CONSISTENT.  WE RESORTED TO MILITARY ACTION UNDER 
ARTICLE 51 IN A SITUATION WHERE AMERICAN LIVES WERE 
CLEARLY IN DANGER AND WHERE OUR ABILITY TO HONOR 
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PANAMA CANAL TREATY WAS THREATENED 
BY VIOLENT ACTIONS.  WE DID SO IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO 
MINIMIZE CASUALTIES AND DAMAGE.  WE CONSULTED IN ADVANCE 
WITH THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED LEADERS OF PANAMA AND 
THEY APPROVED OF OUR ACTIONS. WE INTEND TO WITHDRAW OUR 
FORCES FROM PANAMA AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS 
PRESIDENT BUSH SAID: 
 
\"THE UNITED STATES IS EAGER TO WORK WITH THE PANAMANIAN 
PEOPLE IN PARTNERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP TO REBUILD THEIR 
ECONOMY.  THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE WANT DEMOCRACY, PEACE, 
AND THE CHANCE FOR A BETTER LIFE IN DIGNITY AND 
FREEDOM.  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SEEK ONLY TO 
SUPPORT THEM IN PURSUIT OF THESE NOBLE GOALS.\" 
 
IN SUM, MR PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE FROM A 
STATEMENT MADE THIS AFTERNOON BY SECRETARY BAKER.  OUR 
FOREIGN-POLICY GOALS IN PANAMA HAVE BEEN CLEAR, AND 
THEY\'VE BEEN CONSISTENT.  WE HAVE SOUGHT TO HELP THE 
PANAMANIAN PEOPLE BUILD AN AUTHENTIC DEMOCRACY.  WE HAVE 
BEEN COMMITTED TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND REMAIN 
COMMITTED TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PANAMA CANAL 
TREATIES. 
 
WE HAVE MADE UNPRECEDENTED EFFORTS THROUGH THE OAS AND 
IN CONSULTATIONS WITH LATIN AND CARIBBEAN LEADERS, AS 
WELL AS OTHERS, TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS IN PANAMA. 
 
WE HOPED AND BELIEVE THAT THE ELECTIONS HELD LAST MAY 
COULD BE A MEANS TO RESOLVE THE CRISIS, BUT WHEN NORIEGA 
STOLE THAT ELECTION AND VIOLENTLY SUPPRESSED THE 
OPPOSITION THE CRISIS ONLY GREW WORSE. 
 
PRESIDENT BUSH HAS CONTINUALLY SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT 
RULE OUT THE USE OF FORCE BUT HE ALSO SAID, REPEATEDLY, 
THAT FORCE WAS CLEARLY THE LAST OPTION TO BE 
CONSIDERED.  THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.  END TEXT.

AMERICAN STATE (OAS), IN A MARATHON SPECIAL SESSION, 
ADOPTED BY A VOTE OF 20 - 1 (US), WITH 6 ABSTENTIONS 
(ANTIGUA, COSTA RICA, EL SALVADOR, HONDURAS, GUATEMALA, 
AND VENEZUELA) A RESOLUTION THAT: 
 
--\"DEEPLY REGRETS\" THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA; 
--URGES IMMEDIATE \"CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND 
  BLOODSHED;\" AND 
--CALLS FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN TROOPS \"USED FOR THE 
MILITARY INTERVENTION.\" (THIS WORDING IMPLICITLY 
RECOGNIZES THE LEGITIMATE PRESENCE OF US FORCES IN PANAMA 
PURSUANT TO CANAL TREATIES BY NOT REFERRING TO ALL U.S. 
FORCES.)  THE RESOLUTION STOPS SHORT OF CONDEMNING U.S. 
ACTION, AND NICARAGUA WAS FORCED TO WITHDRAW AN EARLIER 
MORE CRITICAL RESOLUTION.  HOWEVER, A DETERMINED CENTRAL 
AMERICAN ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THE RESOLUTION BY EXPRESSLY 
DENOUNCING NORIEGA WAS DEFEATED WHEN CARIBBEAN COUNTRIES 
JOINED THE GROUP OF EIGHT IN ARGUING THAT NOTHING 
JUSTIFIES MILITARY INTERVENTION.

(SEPTEL) BLASTING NORIEGA AND TAKING THE OAS TO TASK FOR A 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY AT THIS HISTORICAL

HAVING SEEN: 
 
 THE SERIOUS EVENTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, ESPECIALLY 
THE ARMED CLASHES RESULTING FROM THE MILITARY INTERVENTION

CONSIDERING: 
 
 THE PROVISIONS OF RESOLUTION I ADOPTED BY THE 
TWENTY-FIRST MEETING OF CONSULTATION OF MINISTERS OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON MAY 17, 1989 AND THE DECLARATIONS MADE 
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE MEETING AND ADOPTED ON JUNE 6, 
JULY 20, AND AUGUST 24, 1989 ON THE PANAMANIAN CRISIS IN 
ITS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT; 
 
 THAT, AT THE NINETEENTH REGULAR SESSION, THE GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY REQUESTED THE PERMANENT COUNCIL TO KEEP THE 
SITUATION IN PANAMA UNDER PERMANENT CONSIDERATION; 
 
 THAT ANY JUST AND LASTING SOLUTION TO THE PANAMANIAN 
PROBLEM MUST BE BASED ON FULL RESPECT FOR THE RIGHT OF ITS 
PEOPLE TO SELF-DETERMINATION WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE; 
 
 THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO GUARANTEE FULL RESPECT FOR THE 
SOVEREIGNTY OF PANAMA; AND 
 
 THAT IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO REESTABLISH CONDITIONS THAT 
WILL GUARANTEE THE FULL EXERCISE OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS AND 
FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS OF THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE, AND 
 
 THAT THE PANAMANIAN PEOPLE HAVE AN INALIENABLE RIGHT TO 
SELF-DETERMINATION WITHOUT INTERNAL DICTATES OR EXTERNAL 
INTERFERENCE. 
 
RESOLVES: 
 
(1)  TO DEEPLY REGRET THE MILITARY INTERVENTION IN PANAMA. 
 
(2) TO URGE THE IMMEDIATE CESSATION OF HOSTILITITES AND 
BLOODSHED AND TO REQUEST THE LAUNCHING OF NEGOTIATIONS 
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS POLITICAL SECTORS OF THE COUNTRY THAT 
WILL LEAD TO A CONCERTED SOLUTION TO THE PANAMANIAN 
INSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. 
 
(3) TO EXPRESS ITS DEEPEST CONCERN OVER THE SERIOUS 
INCIDENTS AND THE LOSS OF LIVES TAKING PLACE IN THE 
REPUBLIC OF PANAMA.

1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  ON JANUARY 24, SECRETARY BAKER HOSTED 
PRESIDENT SALEH AND HIS DELEGATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE FOR A ONE AND A HALF HOUR EXCHANGE INCLUDING A 
WORKING LUNCHEON.  THE TWO SIDES DISCUSSED THE MIX OF U.S. 
ASSISTANCE FOR FY 90 TOTALLING 47.5 MILLION DOLLARS IN 
ECONOMIC, FOOD, AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE. THERE WAS ALSO 
DISCUSSION OF YEMENI UNITY, U.S.-PDRY RELATIONS, PDRY\'S 
SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM, AND THE PEACE PROCESS, SUBJECTS 
WHICH ARE COVERED SEPTEL. A LIST OF PARTICIPANTS IS AT 
PARA 11. 
 
U.S. ASSISTANCE TO YAR 
 
3.  ON JANUARY 24, THE SECRETARY HOSTED PRESIDENT SALEH AND 
SENIOR MEMBERS OF HIS DELEGATION. DURING THE 30-MINUTE 
MEETING WHICH PRECEDED LUNCH, DISCUSSION FOCUSED ON THE FY 
 
90 U.S. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO YEMEN.  THE U.S. CONFIRMED 
THAT TOTAL U.S. FY 90 ASSISTANCE WILL BE 47.5 MILLION 
DOLLARS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
-- 21 MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, 
-- 25 MILLION DOLLARS IN FOOD ASSISTANCE PL-480 TITLE I, 
-- 500,000 DOLLARS IN FMS, AND 
-- 1 MILLION DOLLARS IN IMET. 
 
4. THE U.S. SIDE DESCRIBED THE BREAKDOWN OF THE 25 MILLION 
DOLLARS IN PL-480 AS FOLLOWS:  AN AGREEMENT FOR 5 MILLION 
DOLLARS IN RICE UNDER TITLE I PL-480 HAS ALREADY BEEN 
SIGNED.  THIS IS THAT PORTION OF THE FY 89 PROGRAM WHICH 
MOVED TO FY 90.  THE U.S. AND YEMEN ARE PREPARED TO SIGN 
SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 25 A SECOND AGREEMENT ON 10 
MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL RICE.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT 
ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE 5 MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW FEED 
GRAIN PROGRAM.  AID ACTING ADMINISTRATOR EDELMAN ADDED 
THAT HE COULD NOW ALSO ANNOUNCE U.S. WILLINGNESS TO ADD AN 
ADDITIONAL 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN FEED GRAINS TO THE 5 
MILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED.  HE ATTRIBUTED THIS 
NEW DEVELOPMENT TO THE EFFECTIVE EFFORTS OF AMBASSADOR 
DUNBAR DURING THE DAYS PRECEDING THE VISIT.  THE YEMENI 
SIDE WAS TOLD THAT 20 MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS FOOD 
ASSISTANCE NOT INCLUDED IS THE 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN RICE 
CARRIED OVER FROM FY 89 WOULD BE PROVIDED UNDER EXTRA 
CONCESSIONAL TERMS, WHICH INCLUDES A TEN-YEAR GRACE PERIOD 
AND A 40-YEAR REPAYMENT SCHEDULE. 
 
5. PRESIDENT SALEH EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR U.S. 
ASSISTANCE TO THE YAR.  HE TOLD THE SECRETARY THAT HE 
WANTED HIS VISIT TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPRINT ON U.S.-YEMENI 
RELATIONS -- A LAUNCHING POINT FOR A STRONGER BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  THIS WAS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF 
THE RECENT DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE WORLD.  HE ASKED 
FOR FURTHER U.S. ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR YEMEN\'S 
EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ITS ECONOMY.  HE REQUESTED U.S. HELP IN 
OBTAINING LOANS FROM THE WORLD BANK IN SUPPORT OF YEMEN\'S 
FIVE-YEAR PLAN. 
 
6. THE SECRETARY CONFIRMED THAT WE DO SUPPORT YEMEN\'S 
BORROWING FROM THE IDA BUT THAT HE UNDERSTANDS YEMEN 
CURRENTLY HAS 250 MILLION DOLLARS IN UNDISBURSED LOANS. 
THE SECRETARY ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF THERE WAS SOMETHING 
MORE SPECIFIC THAT WE COULD DO TO ASSIST YEMEN.  MINISTER 
ATTAR RAISED THE 220 KILOMETER HUTH-HARAD ROAD PROJECT. 
HE SAID YEMEN HAS WORLD BANK SUPPORT FOR 10 MILLION 
DOLLARS BUT NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL  15 MILLION DOLLARS. 
FURTHER, THE YAR WISHES TO PAY 20 PERCENT OF THE LOCAL 
COSTS OF THE PROJECT FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY GENERATED BY 
PL-480 SALES.  FINALLY, THEY HOPE THE WORLD BANK WILL 
AGREE TO \"FORCED ACCOUNT,\" WHEREBY THE PROJECT IS EXECUTED 
SOLELY BY YEMENI ENTERPRISES.  THE SECRETARY REPLIED THAT 
WE WOULD GET THE DETAILS AND SEE HOW WE CAN HELP. 
 
7. THERE THEN FOLLOWED A RATHER DISJOINTED DISCUSSION OF 
MONEY WHICH THE YEMENIS BELIEVED HAD BEEN GIVEN TO THEM BY 
THE SAUDIS FOR THEIR MILITARY, BUT WHICH THEY HAVE NEVER 
RECEIVED.  PRESIDENT SALEH THOUGHT THERE REMAINED 17 
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE ORIGINAL SAUDI COMMITMENT OF 400 
MILLION DOLLARS IN 1978 TO PAY FOR U.S. PLANES AND TANKS. 
HE ARGUED THAT THE U.S. HAD THIS BALANCE IN ITS ACCOUNTS 
AND SHOULD GIVE IT TO THE YEMENIS RATHER THAN RETURNING IT 
TO THE SAUDIS.  THE U.S. SIDE ATTEMPTED TO TO EXPLAIN 
THAT, IF INDEED THE SAUDIS HAD DEPOSITED ALL OF THE 400 
MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE FMS ACCOUNT, THAT MONEY REMAINED 
LEGALLY THEIRS.  THE U.S. SIDE WAS NOT CERTAIN, IN FACT, 
THAT THERE WAS A BALANCE FROM THE ORIGINAL 1978 PROGRAM. 
THE SECRETARY ASKED FOR CLARIFICATION AS TO WHETHER 
PRESIDENT SALEH WAS ASKING US TO WEIGH IN WITH THE SAUDIS, 
INDICATING THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER IT IF THAT WERE THEIR 
REQUEST.  PRESIDENT SALEH DID NOT SPECIFICALLY RESPOND TO 
THE SECRETARY BUT PROCEEDED TO DESCRIBE THE AWKWARD 
TRILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH THE U.S., SAUDI ARABIA, AND 
YEMEN HAVE IN SUPPORT OF THE MILITARY PROGRAM IN THE YAR. 
HE SEEMED TO CONFUSE THE EARLIER ISSUE OF A 17 MILLION 
DOLLAR BALANCE IN THE ACCOUNT WITH SAUDI REFUSAL TO 
DELIVER A SIMILARLY VALUED AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION AND SPARE 
PARTS.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER INTERJECTED THAT A FEW YEARS 
AGO THE U.S. HAD OFFERED YAR 14 MILLION DOLLARS IN FMS 
CREDITS, BUT THAT THE CREDITS WERE OFFERED AT SUCH A HIGH 
INTEREST RATE THAT THEY CAN NEVER BE USED.  HE SUGGESTED 
THAT MAYBE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE TERMS. 
THE SECRETARY SAID WE WOULD LOOK INTO IT. 
 
//GSM PROGRAM// 
 
8. THE PRESIDENT AGAIN RAISED FOOD ASSISTANCE.  HE SAID 
YEMEN NEEDS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF WHEAT ANNUALLY 
AND HE NEEDS U.S. HELP IN OBTAINING THAT VOLUME OF WHEAT 
ON THE SAME CONDITIONS CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY ALGERIA AND 
EGYPT.  MINISTER ATTAR NOTED THAT YEMEN NOW GETS ONLY 
THREE YEARS FOR REPAYMENT AND WANTS EITHER FIVE OR SEVEN 
YEARS TO REPAY.  AMBASSADOR DUNBAR, NOTING THAT THE YEMENI 
SIDE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE GSM PROGRAM, EXPLAINED THAT 
YEMEN WAS IN ARREARS IN ITS PAYMENT ON PAST GSM PROGRAMS 
AND THERE WAS LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IN TALKS FOR 
BETTER TERMS WHILE THE ARREARAGES REMAIN.  PRESIDENT SALEH 
SAID THAT HE PERSONALLY WOULD SETTLE ALL ARREARAGES 
IMMEDIATELY.  ALL WOULD BE PAID. 
 
9. THE SECRETARY REFERRED TO PRESIDENT SALEH\'S EARLIER 
REMARKS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS VISIT TO WASHINGTON 
AND SAID THAT WE WILL LOOK AT THE GSM PROGRAM IN THAT 
SPIRIT IF THE PRESIDENT CAN GET THE ARREARAGE ISSUE BEHIND 
US.  ONCE THE ARREARAGES ARE PAID, WE WILL ASK THE 
AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY CAN BE MORE 
FORTHCOMING IN THE TERMS THEY OFFERED.  PRESIDENT SALEH 
SEEMED PLEASED AND SAID AGAIN THAT ALL ARREARS WILL BE 
PAID.  HE QUIPPED THAT THE SOVIETS HAD A SIMILAR BUT MUCH 
BIGGER PROBLEM WITH YEMEN.  \"WE HAVE 2 BILLION DOLLARS IN 
DEBTS TO THE SOVIETS WHICH WE RESCHEDULE EVERY YEAR.  NOW 
THAT THEY ARE CAPITALISTS, IT WILL BE MUCH TOUGHER TO 
RESCHEDULE.\"  \"YOU WILL FIND MANY OF US,\" HE SAID, 
\"WISHING THEY HAD REMAINED SOCIALISTS:\"  THE SECRETARY 
SUGGESTED SALEH TRY TO GET SOVIET AGREEMENT TO PAY OFF THE 
ENTIRE DEBT IN RUBLES BECAUSE THEN THE YAR COULD WIPE OUT 
ITS DEBT IN ONE DAY. 
 
//INVESTMENT LAW// 
 
10. THE SECRETARY ASKED ABOUT THE STATUS OF YEMEN\'S  NEW 
INVESTMENT LAW.  PRESIDENT SALEH SAID THE LAW WAS 
PRESENTLY IN DRAFT.  HE DESCRIBED IT AS ONE OF THE BEST 
INVESTMENT LAWS IN THE WORLD.  HE THANKED THE U.S. AND 
SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR THEIR GREAT ASSISTANCE.  THE 
LAW WILL SOON BE SENT TO PARLIAMENT FOR APPROVAL.  IN HIS 
WORDS, EVERYTHING IS ON TRACK.

THE NEW YORK TIMES 

IN ALMOST EVERY RESPECT, THE NELSON MANDELA WHO WALKED OUT 
OF VICTOR VERSTER PRISON FARM SUNDAY MORNING APPEARED TO 
RESEMBLE CLOSELY THE IMPRESSIVE FIGURE DESCRIBED IN RECENT 
YEARS BY THE DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO VISITED HIM IN PRISON, 
JOHN BURNS WRITES.  BECAUSE THOSE VISITORS HAD DESCRIBED 
MANDELA IN GLOWING TERMS - A MAN OF UNUSUAL MEMORY AND 
GREAT PERSONAL WARMTH, EVEN TOWARD HIS CAPTORS, REPORTERS 
WAITING TO SEE HIM ON SUNDAY WERE WATCHING FOR FEET OF 
CLAY.  BUT THERE WERE FEW WHO SAID THEY FOUND THEM. 
ADDRESSING A PRESS CONFERENCE IN ARCHBISHOP TUTU\'S CAPE 
TOWN GARDEN ON MONDAY, MANDELA APPEARED MODEST, 
SOFT-SPOKEN, ANALYTICAL YET GENEROUS IN HIS POLITICAL 
OBSERVATIONS AND FRIENDLY.  EVEN THOUGH HIS NEWSPAPERS AND 
MAGAZINES WERE HEAVILY CENSORED UNTIL THE MID-1980S, HE 
SHOWED A BROAD GRASP OF EVENTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE SOUTH 
AFRICA.  IN MONDAY\'S PRESS CONFERENCE, HE DESCRIBED SOME OF 
HIS CAPTORS AS GOOD MEN.  \"THAT HAS WIPED OUT ANY 
BITTERNESS A MAN COULD HAVE,\" HE SAID.  P. A17; 

BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS IN THE NEW YORK AREA SAID IN 
INTERVIEWS YESTERDAY THAT THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA 
IMPROVED THE PROSPECTS FOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SAG AND 
THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT, ERIC PACE REPORTS.  SOME SAID 
THAT MANDELA\'S RETURN TO THE POLITICAL SCENE WOULD INCREASE 
COHESIVENESS WITHIN THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT.  OTHERS 
INTERPRETED THE RELEASE AS ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY THE SAG OF THE 
STRENGTH AND PIVOTAL ROLE OF THE ANC.  SELOKA PHIRWA, A 
MEMBER OF THE ANC\'S OBSERVER MISSION TO THE UN AND OTHERS, 
SAID THAT WHILE RELEASE OF MANDELA WAS A \"BOLD STEP,\" OTHER 
CONDITIONS SET BY THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT FOR 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE SAG \"REMAINED UNFILLED.\"  THE LABOR 
SECRETARY OF THE PAC, LESOANA MAKHANDA, SAID MANDELA WAS 
BEING RELEAED \"MERELY INTO A LARGER JAIL, WHICH IS THE REST 
OF SOUTH AFRICA.\"  P. A17; 

WHILE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS SOUTH AFRICA CELEBRATED THE 
RELEASE OF MANDELA, THE QUESTION RAISED BY SUPPORTERS AND 
OPPONENTS ALIKE IS WHETHER PRESIDENT DE KLERK, IN FREEING 
MANDELA, HAS UNLEASED A CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT HE WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO CONTROL.  PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHETHER DE KLERK 
WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE GORBACHEV OF SOUTH AFRICA, A 
REFORMER WHO SETS OUT ON A MODEST COURSE OF CHANGE ONLY TO 
FIND THAT HE HAS UNCAGED FORCES THAT MOVE THROUGH SOCIETY 
IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS, FORCES THAT EVEN THREATEN TO 
OVERWHELM HIM.  WHILE CP LEADER ANDRIES TREURNICHT TALKED 
OF THE SAG HAVING SURRENDERED TO A MARXIST REVOLUTION, 
MODERATES AMONG WHITES AND BLACKS AGREED THAT THE SOUTH 
AFRICA OF YESTERDAY, IN WHICH WHITES DECREED FOR BLACKS, IS 
ALMOST SURELY GONE FOREVER.  THE LIBERAL \"WEEKLY MAIL\" 
SAID:  \"IF THE GOVERNMENT STILL BELIEVES IT CAN CONTROL THE 
PROCESS IT HAS STARTED, IT IS KIDDING ITSELF.\"  JOHN BURNS 
REPORTS.  P. A16; 

AN EDITORIAL, \"SUNRISE IN SOUTH AFRICA,\" STATES THAT THE 
JAIL THAT OPENED SUNDAY FOR NELSON MANDELA \"BEGAN TO FREE A 
NATION EVEN AS IT FREED A MAN.\"  MANDELA ROSE TO A 
\"REMARKABLE OCCASION:\"  HE PRAISED HIS FOLLOWERS FOR THEIR 
STEADFASTNESS, BUT REMINDED THEM THAT DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES 
HAD TO BE RESPECTED; HE PRAISED F.W. DE KLERK AS \"A MAN OF 
INTEGRITY; HE DEFENDED THE ARMED STRUGGLE, BUT ALSO SAID HE 
HOPED A NEW CLIMATE WOULD END THE NEED FOR A \"DEFENSIVE\" 
RESPONSE.  THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO SAY THAT GLOBAL 
SANCTIONS HAVE HASTENED REFORMS, INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF 
MANDELA AND THE UNBANNING OF THE ANC.  \"THESE STEPS ARE A 
VINDICATION OF SANCTIONS, NOT AN ARGUMENT FOR REPEALING 
THEM.\"  AT THE SAME TIME, THE EDITORIAL SAYS BUSH HAS TAKEN 
\"THE RIGHT FIRST STEP\" IN INVITING BOTH DE KLERK AND 
MANDELA TO WASHINGTON AND THAT \"IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO EASE 
SOME PENALTIES AS PRETORIA MOVES FORWARD, THEREBY PROVIDING 
INCENTIVES FOR FURTHER CHANGE WHILE KEEPING THE LEGISLATION 
IN FORCE.\"  WHILE CONCEDING THE SAG STILL HAS TO TAKE OTHER 
STEPS TO CREATE A CLIMATE FOR NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT IT 
WON\'T BE EASY TO MESH THE GOALS OF THE SAG AND THE 
ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT, EVEN AFTER NEGOTIATIONS HAVE 
BEGUN, THE EDITORIAL ENDS ON AN UPBEAT NOTE:  \"IN CAPE TOWN 
AS ELSEWHERE . . . THE UNTHINKABLE HAS BECOME IMAGINABLE 
AND A STRUGGLE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BEGUN BY NAMELESS ORDINARY 
PEOPLE HAS FOUND CHAMPIONS IN LEADERS LIKE MIKHAIL 
GORBACHEV, LECH WELESA, VACLEV HAVEL, F.W. DE KLERK AND, 
NOW, NELSON MANDELA.\"  P. A24; 

IN AN OP-ED PIECE, TONY LEWIS WRITES OF MANDELA\'S WALK TO 
FREEDOM:  \"NOT MANY EVENTS IN THE WORLD HAVE SUCH SYMBOLIC 
EMOTIONAL POWER.\"  MANDELA\'S SURVIVAL OF 27 YEARS IN PRISON 
IS TESTIMONY \"THAT HIS CAUSE - NON-RACIAL DEMOCRACY IN 
SOUTH AFRICA - COULD NOT BE CRUSHED.\"  THE ENTHUSIASTIC 
RESPONSE OF SOUTH AFRICANS TO A FREE MANDELA IS AN 
EXPRESSION OF A REALITY THE SAG HAS TRIED TO SUPPRESS FOR 
MANY YEARS:  \"THAT BLACKS, 75 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, 
WANT TO HAVE THEIR PART IN RUNNING THE COUNTRY.\"  LEWIS 
GOES ON TO SAY THAT DE KLERK MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE 
ENORMOUS EMOTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS WHICH WOULD BE AROUSED 
BY MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND HE MUST BE CREDITED WITH \"RARE 
COURAGE.\"  WHILE THERE ARE STILL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING 
THE RESISTANCE OF RIGHT-WING WHITES TO ANY CHANGE, THE 
REACTION OF WHITES - FROM THE GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED SABC TO 
PIK BOTHA AND WHITES IN SUNDAY\'S CROWD ON THE ROAD TO CAPE 
TOWN - HAS BEEN \"SURPRISINGLY FRIENDLY\" TO MANDELA.  LEWIS 
CONCLUDES THAT INSTEAD OF DWELLING ON APARTHEID\'S PAST 
EVILS, \"IT IS BETTER TO THINK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES 
AHEAD.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE A NEW SOUTH AFRICA COULD MAKE TO 
ITSELF AND ITS CONTINENT.\"  P. A25; 

AP REPORTS PLATINUM FUTURES PRICES JUMPED YESTERDAY AFTER 
NELSON MANDELA ENDORSED ANTI-APARTHEID VIOLENCE AND 
NATIONALIZATION OF SOUTH AFRICA\'S MINING INDUSTRY, SENDING 
FEAR ABOUT SUPPLIES THROUGH THE PRECIOUS METALS MARKETS. 
BERNARD SAVAIKO, SENIOR METALS ANALYST AT PAINE WEBBER 
INC., SAID MINE SABOTAGE POSES OBVIOUS PRODUCTION PROBLEMS, 
WHILE THE ANC\'S CALL FOR NATIONALIZATION OF THE MINES 
\"LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FLOW OF SUPPLY WILL 
DIMINISH BECAUSE OF THE INEFFICIENCIES OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
MINING OPERATIONS AS OPPOSED TO THOSE CONTROLLED BY FREE 
ENTERPRISE.\"  SOUTH AFRICA IS THE WORLD\'S LARGEST PRODUCER 
OF PLATINUM AND GOLD.  P. D17; 

REPRESENTATIVES OF THE WORLD\'S 42 POOREST NATIONS MET IN 
DHAKA, BANGLADESH OVER THE WEEKEND TO DEVISE NEW WAYS TO 
CONVINCE RICHER COUNTRIES THAT NEARLY HALF A BILLION PEOPLE 
NEED HELP DESPERATELY.  THIS FIRST MINISTERIAL MEETING OF 
LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IS EXPECTED TO RESTATE FORCEFULLY 
A PLEA THAT AID DONORS AND INTERNATIONAL LENDING 
ORGANIZATINS TREAT THE POOREST NATIONS SEPARATELY FROM THE 
REST OF THE DEVELOPING WORLD.  THE GROUP OF 42 - OF WHICH 
28 ARE IN AFRICA - WILL MEET WITH DONOR NATIONS IN GENEVA 
AT THE END OF MARCH IN PREPARATION FOR A LARGER 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN PARIS IN SEPTEMBER ON THE 
PLIGHT OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COUNTRIES.  BARBARA 
CROSSETTE REPORTS.  P. A3; 

 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 

IN A LENGTHY ANALYSIS WRITTEN FROM THE ERITREAN FRONT, 
GERALDINE BROOKS WRITES THAT THE STRUGGLE IN ERITREA, AFTER 
28 YEARS, MAY BE NEAR A CLIMAX.  OPPOSING BLACK AFRICA\'S 
BEST-EQUIPPED ARMY, THAT OF ETHIOPIA, EPLF GUERRILLAS SEEK 
INDEPENDENCE FOR AN ENGLAND-SIZE STRIP OF RED SEA COAST 
THAT IS HOME TO 3.5 MILLION PEOPLE.  ETHIOPIA ANNEXED IT IN 
1962.  THE GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR IT EVER 
SINCE.  A RAPID STRING OF GUERRILLA VICTORIES FORCED THE 
GPDRE INTO PEACE TALKS MEDIATED BY JIMMY CARTER LAST FALL. 
IN THE PAST WEEK, THE EPLF ADVANCED AGAIN IN FIERCE 
FIGHTING AROUND THE RED SEA PORT OF MASSAWA.  THEY CLAIM TO 
HAVE CAPTURED THE PORT, WHILE THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMNENT 
ONLY SAYS THAT HEAVY FIGHTING AT THE PORT CONTINUES.  AN 
ERITREAN VICTORY WOULD CULMINATE A STRUGGLE IN AFRICA\'S 
LONGEST WAR, BUT IT WOULD BE A VICTORY THAT HARDLY ANY OF 
ERITREA\'S NEIGHBORS SEEM TO DESIRE.  AFRICAN NATIONS WORRY 
THAT ONE SECESSIONIST VICTORY WOULD PUT THE WHOLE 
CONTINENT\'S MAP AT RISK.  ISRAEL PREFERS THE PREDOMINANTLY 
CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT TO THE ARAB ENCIRCLEMENT IT 
FEARS WOULD FOLLOW A WIN BY PARTLY MOSLEM ERITREA.  WAR AND 
PERIODIC FAMINE NOTWITHSTANDING, THE ERITREANS HAVE MANAGED 
TO BUILD A COMPLEX SOCIETY ON THEIR CAPTURED LAND. 
SPENDING TWO WEEKS WITH THE EPLF, BROOKS SAW AN UNDERGROUND 
MOVEMENT THAT IS LITERALLY THAT:  SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, 
FACTORIES AND \"GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS\" ARE GOUGED OUT OF 
ROCK OR BUILT IN EARTHEN TUNNELS TO HIDE FROM THE ENEMY\'S 
MIGS.  THE EPLF\'S LEADER, ISAIS AFEWERKE, CLAIMS THE 
MOVEMENT IS NOT \"MARXIST.\"  \"THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE DO 
COLLECTIVELY, NOT BECAUSE WE WANT IT TO BE THAT WAY BUT 
BECAUSE WE DON\'T HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE,\" HE SAYS.  P. A1; 

AN EDITORIAL ASSERTS THAT WITH MANDELA\'S WALK TO FREEDOM, 
\"THE LEGEND ENDS AND THE HUMAN BEING COMES OUT.\"  MANDELA\'S 
FIRST SPEECH IN CAPE TOWN, THE EDITORIAL GOES ON TO SAY, 
FAILED TO REASSURE NON-ANC MEMBERS THAT HE WANTS 
RECONCILIATION WITH ALL SOUTH AFRICANS.  HE FAILED TO 
MENTION ANY MODERATE BLACKS SUCH AS CHIEF BUTHELEZI, 
PROMISED TO CONTINUE THE \"ARMED STRUGGLE\" AND PRAISED THE 
SACP.  HE ALSO OPENED AND CLOSED HIS SPEECH IN XHOSA, THE 
LANGUAGE OF THE ANC\'S DOMINANT ETHNIC GROUP.  THE EDITORIAL 
SUGGESTS THAT MANDELA WILL NEED TIME TO EVALUATE THE 
SITUATION IN TODAY\'S SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH HAS CHANGED 
CONSIDERABLY IN THE YEARS HE WAS IN PRISON.  NOTING 
ECONOMIC PROGRESS BY BLACKS - 57 PERCENT OF ALL HOUSING 
PERMITS LAST YEAR WENT TO BLACKS, FOR EXAMPLE - THE 
EDITORIAL ASSERTS THAT THIS \"SILENT REVOLUTION HAS NOT ONLY 
BEEN EFFECTIVE IN UNDERMINING APARTHEID, BUT HAS ALSO LED 
MANY BLACKS TO REVIEW THEIR POLITICS.  \"THE ANC\'S MOST 
RADICAL ELEMENTS MAY FIND LESS SUPPORT FOR SOCIALISM IN THE 
TOWNSHIPS THAN THEY EXPECT.\"  IF MANDELA DOES NOT TAKE THIS 
INTO ACCOUNT, HE COULD FIND DIFFICULTY IN PURSUING THE 
ANC\'S AGENDA.  THE EDITORIAL CONCLUDES:  \"THE ANC HAS 
ALWAYS ACTED AS IF NEGOTIATIONS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AROUND A 
SQUARE TABLE WITH TWO CHAIRS, ONE FOR THE ANC AND ONE FOR 
THE WHITES.  THE SOONER BOTH SIDES REALIZE THAT A ROUND 
TABLE WITH CHAIRS REPRESENTING MANY INTERESTS WILL BE 
NEEDED, THE MORE SMOOTHLY A TRANSITION TO A POST-APARTHEID 
SOUTH AFRICA IS LIKELY TO GO.\"  P. A20; 

INTERNATIONAL AID DONORS PLEDGED 27 MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP 
AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR BUSINESSES OFF THE GROUND. 
THE AFRICA PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILITY SAID AFTER A 
MEETING WITH 14 WESTERN DONOR NATIONS AT THE WORLD BANK 
THAT IT AIMED TO FIND MORE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS OVER THE 
NEXT FIVE YEARS.  P. A16; 

 
WASHINGTON POST 

NELSON MANDELA TOOK A CONCILIATORY TONE TOWARD WHITE SOUTH 
AFRICANS IN A FIFTY MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE FOLLOWING HIS 
RELEASE.  HE SAID THAT HE WANTED WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS WHO 
FEAR FOR THEIR SECURITY TO FEEL SAFE ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF 
BLACK-MAJORITY RULE, AND HE PREDICTED THAT NEGOTIATIONS ON 
THE NATION\'S POLITICAL FUTURE WOULD BEGIN SOON.  HE ALSO 
SUGGESTED THAT THE ANC MIGHT STOP ITS ARMED STRUGGLE IF 
PRETORIA ENDED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND AGREED TO OTHER 
CONCESSIONS.  BUT EVEN AS HE TRIED TO CALM WHITES\' FEARS, 
HE DECLARED SUPPORT YESTERDAY FOR NATIONALIZATION OF KEY 
SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIES, SETTING OFF CONCERN IN THE 
BUSINESS WORLD.  GOLD PRICES FELL 4 PERCENT ON THE 
JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE FINANCIAL RAND 
PLUMMETED 10 PERCENT.  VIOLENCE, FOLLOWING MANDELA\'S 
RELEASE, WAS UP SHARPLY.  POLICE REPORTED 40 PEOPLE KILLED 
AND SCORES INJURED SINCE SUNDAY, INCLUDING 10 SHOT WHEN 
POLICE OPENED FIRE ON LOOTERS WHO BROKE AWAY FROM 
CELEBRATING CROWDS NEAR EAST LONDON ON SUNDAY.  IN CAPE 
TOWN, MANDELA FIELDED QUESTIONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL 
PRESS CORPS.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN \"ABSOLUTELY SURPRISED\" TO 
SEE SO MANY WHITES WELCOMING HIM SUNDAY ON THE SHORT DRIVE 
FROM THE PRISON INTO CAPE TOWN AND HE STRESSED THAT IF THE 
NATION\'S 25 MILLION BLACK MAJORITY ASSUMES POWER, SOUTH 
AFRICA\'S 5 MILLION WHITES NEED HAVE NO FEARS FOR THEIR 
FUTURE.  \"THE ANC IS VERY MUCH CONCERNED TO ADDRESS THE 
QUESTION OF THE CONCERN OF WHITES OVER THE (BLACK) DEMAND 
OF ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE,\" HE SAID.  \"THEY INSIST ON 
STRUCTURAL GUARANTEES TO ENSURE THAT THE REALIZATION OF 
THIS DEMAND DOES NOT RESULT IN THE DOMINATION OF WHITES BY 
BLACKS.  WE UNDERSTAND THOSE FEELINGS, AND THE ANC IS 
CONCERNED TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM AND TO FIND A SOLUTION 
WHICH WILL SUIT BOTH THE BLACKS AND WHITES OF THIS 
COUNTRY.\"  MANDELA HINTED THAT THE ANC IS CONSIDERING SOME 
RECIPROCAL MOVE FOLLOWING DE KLERK\'S ACTIONS, BUT HE 
INDICATED THAT THIS COULD OCCUR ONLY IF THE GOVERNMENT ENDS 
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND RELEASES ALL POLITICAL 
PRISONERS.  HE REPEATED HIS SUPPORT FOR THE ANC\'S 
COMMITMENT TO THE NATIONALIZATION OF THE MINES AND SIMILAR 
SECTORS.  WHEN PRESSED TO SAY WHETHER HE WAS A COMMUNIST, 
MANDELA REPLIED, \"LET ME MAKE IT CLEAR.  I DO NOT BELONG TO 
ANY PARTY APART FROM THE ANC.\"  DAVID OTTAWAY REPORTS.  P. 
1; NYT. P. 1; CSM P. 1;  W.T.  P. A1; 

ON MANDELA\'S RELEASE, MARY MCGRORY WRITES, \"IN A SEASON OF 
STUNNING POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS, THE RELEASE OF NELSON 
MANDELA WAS IN A CLASS BY ITSELF, PARTAKING OF THE FALL OF 
THE BERLIN WALL AND THE SOVIET CEDING OF MONOPOLY POWER. 
MOST SPECTATORS AT THE GALLOPING HISTORY WE GET THESE DAYS 
EXPECTED SOUTH AFRICA TO BE THE LAST TO CHANGE OR GIVE UP 
ITS TITLE FOR INTRACTABILITY TO ISRAEL OR NORTHERN 
IRELAND.\"  MCGRORY CREDITS GIL KULICK OF THE CARNEGIE 
FOUNDATION FOR BEING ONE OF THE FIRST TO RECOGNIZE DE 
KLERK\'S SINCERITY IN WANTING \"A NEW AFRICA.\"  P. 2; 

IN AN EDITORIAL, THE POST EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT NELSON 
MANDELA\'S TRIBUTE TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN COMMUNIST PARTY. 
THE EDITORIAL ASKS WHY COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERS STILL 
DOMINATE THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OF THE ANC AND WHY THEY 
EVIDENTLY ALSO HAVE A STRONG POSITION IN THE MASS 
DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT.  THE POST URGES THE ANC \"TO ENSURE 
THAT THE BLACK LEADERSHIP IS NOT CAPTURED OR INFLUENCED BY 
A PARTY THAT IS A RELIC OF A CONSPIRATORIAL PAST.\"  P. 20; 

PRESIDENT BUSH INDICATED YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL NOT ASK 
CONGRESS TO CONSIDER LIFTING ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST 
SOUTH AFRICA IN RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE OF NELSON MANDELA, 
BUT HE ADDED THAT SOME OF THE SANCTIONS ARE 
\"COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.\"  AT A WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE DEVOTED 
ALMOST ENTIRELY TO SOUTH AFRICA AND EAST-WEST RELATIONS, 
BUSH SAID MANDELA\'S RELEASE WAS A \"DRAMATIC SIGN\" THAT 
SOUTH AFRICA IS MOVING TOWARD A MORE RACIALLY EQUITABLE 
SOCIETY.  ON SANCTIONS, THE PRESIDENT CITED THE CAAA AND 
SAID \"I AM BOUND BY THE LAW...THE SANCTIONS REMAIN ON UNTIL 
THE SOUTH AFRICANS HAVE TAKEN CERTAIN (OTHER) STEPS\" TOWARD 
RACIAL EQUALITY.  IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW, HANK COHEN 
SAID THAT U.S. SANCTIONS PLAYED ONLY A SMALL ROLE IN 
MANDELA\'S RELEASE AND THAT SOME \"GESTURE\" SHOULD BE MADE TO 
DE KLERK.  \"WHAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT IS ENCOURAGING 
FURTHER PROGRESS....IF THAT MEANS RELAXATION OF SANCTIONS, 
FINE.\"  ANN DEVROY REPORTS.  P. 14;  BALT. SUN  P. A1; 
W.T.  P. A1; 
 
JESSE JACKSON PRAISED PRESIDENT DE KLERK, COMPARING HIS 
RELEASE OF MANDELA WITH LINCOLN\'S FREEING THE SLAVES. 
\"THIS WAS A COURAGEOUS STEP FOR PRESIDENT DE KLERK,\" HE 
TOLD THE CAPE TOWN PRESS CLUB.  THE WINDOWS OF JACKSON\'S 
MERCEDES WERE BROKEN AND THE ROOF CAVED IN AS CROWDS 
SWARMED OVER THE CAR MISTAKING HIM FOR MANDELA.  JACKSON 
WAS WAITING INSIDE CITY HALL WITH A SMALL GROUP OF SOUTH 
AFRICAN CIVIC AND CHURCH LEADERS WHEN MANDELA ARRIVED TO 
GIVE HIS FIRST SPEECH.  JACKSON, WHO\'S VISIT HAS BEEN 
LARGELY OVERSHADOWED BY MANDELA\'S RELEASE, HAS BEEN URGING 
BLACK OPPOSITION GROUPS TO STRIVE FOR UNITY AMONG 
THEMSELVES.  HE SAID THAT HE WAS CONVINCED AFTER MEETING 
WITH DE KLERK THAT THE PRESIDENT INTENDS TO \"HONOR HIS 
WORD\" AND CONTINUE HIS REFORMS.  HE ADDED THAT HE HAD A 
SENSE THAT DE KLERK WOULD LIFT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY 
SHORTLY.  DAVID OTTAWAY REPORTS.  P. 14; 

NELSON MANDELA AGREED TO SPEND LAST NIGHT AT AN UNDISCLOSED 
SITE NORTH OF JOHANNESBURG AFTER THE COMMITTEE OF BLACK 
LEADERS HANDLING HIS SCHEDULE DECIDED THAT THE HUGE CROWDS 
OF BOISTEROUS PEOPLE WAITING TO WELCOME HIM BACK TO HIS 
HOME POSED A THREAT TO HIS SAFETY.  FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT 
DAY, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE POURED INTO THE STREETS TO 
CHEER AND DANCE IN CELEBRATION, WHILE TWO STADIUMS, WHERE 
MANDELA WAS SCHEDULED TO APPEAR, WERE SWAMPED BY 
UNMANAGEABLE CROWDS.  UNNERVED BY THE VIOLENCE THAT BROKE 
OUT AT MANDELA\'S FIRST PUBLIC RALLY IN CAPE TOWN ON SUNDAY, 
THE COMMITTEE CANCELED BOTH OF MONDAY\'S SCHEDULED 
APPEARANCES AND ANNOUNCED THAT MANDELA WOULD SPEAK TUESDAY 
IN THE COUNTRY\'S LARGEST SOCCER STADIUM, JUST OUTSIDE 
SOWETO WHERE SECURITY COULD BE MORE EASILY ARRANGED.  THE 
GOVERNMENT CANNOT PROVIDE POLICE PROTECTION IN THE 
TOWNSHIPS WHERE POLICE ARE HATED, AND IT IS RELUCTANT TO 
ALLOW ARMED ANC MEMBERS TO GUARD MANDELA.  AS A RESULT, 
MANDELA HAS HARDLY ANY EFFECTIVE PROTECTION.  MEANWHILE, 
THE OVERALL LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THE COUNTRY HAS RISEN 
SHARPLY IN THE VIBRANT ATMOSPHERE FOLLOWING MANDELA\'S 
LEASE.  ALLISTER SPARKS REPORTS.  P. 14;  BALT. SUN  P. 
A1;  W.T.  P. A1;  BALT. SUN  P. 2A; 

JACK ANDERSON AND DALE VAN ATTA REPORT THAT NELSON MANDELA 
OWES HIS FREEDOM IN LARGE PART TO EGYPTIAN MINISTER OF 
STATE, BOUTROS GHALI, WHO HAS BEEN NEGOTIATING IN SECRET 
FOR TWO YEARS TO FREE HIM AND ROLL BACK APARTHEID. 
ACCORDING TO ANDERSON AND VAN ATTA, GHALI KEPT HIS MEETINGS 
WITH SOUTH AFRICAN OFFICIALS QUIET AND HELD THEM IN NEUTRAL 
GROUND IN PARIS, CAIRO AND HARARE.  FIRST HE CONCENTRATED 
ON GETTING THE PAC AND ANC TO WORK TOGETHER.  EGYPT HAS A 
HISTORY OF FUNDING BOTH GROUPS.  THEN HE DREW THE SAG INTO 
THE TALKS.  P. B8;

KIDS FROM THE BEVERLY FARMS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN POTOMAC 
ARE PICTURED WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF CONGO PRESIDENT 
DENIS SASSOU-NGUESSO AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  P. B1; 

AP REPORTS FROM JOHANNESBURG THAT WHEN MANDELA EXPRESSED 
SUPPORT YESTERDAY FOR NATIONALIZING THE MINES AND OTHER 
ASSETS, HE SHOCKED THE BUSINESS WORLD AND GOLD MINING 
STOCKS FELL 4 PERCENT ON THE JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE. 
THE FINANCIAL RAND, A SPECIAL CURRENCY USED TO ENCOURAGE 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT, PLUMMENTED 10 PERCENT ON THE BLACK 
LEADER\'S FIRST DAY OF FREEDOM.  GOLD PRICES ROSE IN THE 
U.S. AND EUROPE.  GAVIN RELLY, CHAIRMAN OF THE 
ANGLO-AMERICAN CORP. MINING CONGLOMERATE CALLED MANDELA\'S 
RELEASE \"A MAJOR STEP TOWARD NORMALIZING SOUTH AFRICA\'S 
POLITICAL LIFE.\"  COMMENTING PRIVATELY ON MANDELA\'S STANCE 
ON NATIONALIZATION, A BANK ECONOMIST SAID IT CAUSED 
\"JITTERS AND UNCERTAINTY\" AND \"WILL DEFINITELY HAVE A 
NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FOREIGN PERCEPTIONS OF INVESTMENT IN 
SOUTH AFRICA, ON LOCAL BUSINSS CONFIDENCE AND ON PRIVATE 
FIXED INVESTMENT.\"  BUSINESS LEADERS ARE HOPEFUL THAT DE 
KLERK\'S REFORMS AND CONCESSIONS WILL PERSUADE WESTERN 
COUNTRIES TO ABANDON OR EASE THE SANCTIONS IMPOSED IN 
RECENT YEARS.  WHEN DE KLERK LEGALIZED THE ANC, PM THATCHER 
CANCELED ACADEMIC AND CULTURAL EMBARGOES AND SHE NOW WANTS 
TO END A BAN ON NEW INVESTMENT.  P. A9; 

SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT DE KLERK HAS TAKEN A BOLD AND 
COURAGEOUS STEP IN RELEASING NELSON MANDELA.  CHRISTOPHER 
MATTHEWS, BUREAU CHIEF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER AND 
NATIONALLY SYNDICATED COLUMNIST, QUESTIONS WHAT WE 
AMERICANS CAN DO.  \"LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, WE\'VE BEEN 
CAUGHT FLAT-FOOTED BY MR. DE KLERK\'S BOLDNESS.  AS SO OFTEN 
IN OUR DEALINGS WITH SOUTH AFRICA, WE FIND OURSELVES 
TONGUE-TIED.\"  HIS QUESTIONS ARE DO WE APPLAUD HIM FOR WHAT 
HE\'S DONE OR DO WE CONDEMN HIM FOR WHAT HE HASN\'T DONE?  DO 
WE CHEER OR SIT ON OUR HANDS?  MATTHEWS SAYS WE HAVE 
ALIENATED WHITES WITH OUR LIMITED SANCTIONS AND UNLIMITED 
MORAL POSTURING.  WE\'VE TURNED OFF BLACKS BY \"KEEPING OUR 
IDEALS IN THE BACK OF THE BUS WHILE SITTING OUR INTERESTS 
UP FRONT.\"  MATTHEWS REFLECTS BACK TO 1965 WHEN ROBERT F. 
KENNEDY ADDRESSED STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN 
AND FOUND COMMON GROUND.  HE IDENTIFIED NOT ONLY WITH THE 
ASPIRATIONS OF THE BLACK MAJORITY BUT WITH THE HISTORY AND 
FEARS OF THE AFRIKANERS WHO SETTLED THERE 300 YEARS AGO. 
MATTHEWS CALLS FOR THE CAREFUL USE OF THE CARROTS AND THE 
STICKS.  ECONOMIC SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN A USEFUL STICK AND 
THEIR ELIMINATION CAN BE A USEFUL CARROT.  WE SHOULD OFFER 
THE CARROT GLADLY -- NOT DANGLE IT.  HE CALLS FOR THE U.S. 
TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH AFRICA AND NOT PRESCRIBE IT. 
THE U.S. NEEDS TO SHOW BOTH COMPASSION AND SMART POLITICS. 
\"FREEDOM IS TOO IMPORTANT TO PLAY HARD TO GET.\"  P. F1; 

AN EDITORIAL CARTOON SHOWS MANDELA\'S FIST WITH THE CHAIN 
AROUND HIS WRIST BROKEN.  P. F2; 

WHEN MANDELA WALKED OUT OF VICTOR VERSTER PRISON SUNDAY HE 
GRADUATED FROM ICON TO LEADER.  THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WILL 
SHOW WHETHER HE IS \"MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS OTHER 
CHARISMATIC, WORLD-HISTORICAL FIGURES WHO DEFIED 
EXTRAORDINARY ODDS AND OBSTACLES TO LEAD THEIR PEOPLE 
UPWARD.\"  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF  DISADVANTAGES FACING 
MANDELA.  UNTIL 5-6 YEARS AGO, MANDELA WAS AN OBSCURE 
OPERATIVE OF AN UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE MOVEMENT.  HIS 
CAPACITIES FOR REAL LEADERSHIP REMAIN COMPLETELY UNTESTED. 
AMONG THE FACTORS WORKING AGAINST MANDELA ARE HIS AGE, THE 
FACTIONALISM WITHIN THE ANTI-APARTHEID MOVEMENT ITSELF, AND 
MANDELA\'S ABSENCE FROM THE SOCIETY FOR 27 YEARS.  QUESTIONS 
TO BE ASKED ARE:  HOW WEDDED IS MANDELA TO THE MARXIST 
IDEOLOGY, WHAT DID HE MEAN WHEN HE CALLED FOR \"A 
FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT THE INEQUALITIES OF APARTHEID ARE 
ADDRESSED?\"  THE EDITORIAL URGES MANDELA TO TAKE A LONG 
VACATION INSIDE SOUTH AFRICA AND SEE WHAT IS REALLY 
HAPPENING IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE 
1964.  \"IF MANDELA CLINGS TO THE LEFTIST ORTHODOXY HE HELD 
27 YEARS AGO, SOUTH AFRICAN BLACKS MAY BE FORCED TO TRADE 
THE OLD SHACKLES OF APARTHEID FOR NEW SHACKLES OF SOCIALIST 
POVERTY.\"  P. F2;

AN EDITORIAL URGES THE U.S. TO DECIDE ON AN APPROPRIATE 
RESPONSE TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED MOVEMENT NOW THAT NELSON 
MANDELA HAS BEEN RELEASED AND OTHER SIGNS OF POLITICAL 
PROCESS ARE VISIBLE IN SOUTH AFRICA.  THE QUESTION 
CONFRONTING THE U.S. IS SHOULD THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION 
CONSIDER LIFTING SANCTIONS AS A SIGN OF ENCOURAGEMENT OR 
SHOULD THE U.S. WEIGH THE IDEA OF TOUGHER NEW SANCTIONS TO 
KEEP THE PRESSURE ON, AS ANTI-APARTHEID ACTIVISTS WITHIN 
SOUTH AFRICA ARE PROPOSING?  NEITHER APPROACH WOULD BE 
APPROPRIATE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME.  TOUGHER NEW SANCTIONS 
WOULD PENALIZE THE DE KLERK GOVERNMENT UNNECESSARILY AT THE 
MOMENT IT HAS EMBARKED ON HISTORIC REFORM.  BUT, THE L986 
LAW LISTS FIVE CONDITIONS THE SAG MUST MEET BEFORE THE U.S. 
CAN LIFT SANCTIONS.  THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN 
MET.  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SHOULD INSTEAD BE LOOKING FOR 
WAYS TO EXPRESS ITS APPROVAL OF THE ACTIONS THE DE KLERK 
ADMINISTRATION IS EMBARKING ON AND BOLSTER THE DE KLERK 
GOVERNMENT AGAINST A POSSIBLE RIGHT-WING WHITE BACKLASH. 
BUSH\'S SEPARATE INVITATIONS TO DE KLERK AND MANDELA ARE 
POSITIVE GESTURES.  P. 8A.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
- 
2.  SUMMARY:  A YEAR AFTER KHOMEINI\'S DEATH, IRAN\'S 
LEADERS ARE DIVIDED OVER THE COUNTRY\'S FUTURE POLITICAL 
DIRECTION.  THEIR DISAGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES 
EXPRESSED IN OBSCURE THEOLOGICAL TERMS, ARE ON DISPLAY 
IN VIGOROUS DEBATES IN THE MEDIA, PARLIAMENT, FRIDAY 
SERMONS, AND OTHER PUBLIC SPEECHES. THIS DEBATE, 
HOWEVER, IS FOR INSIDERS ONLY, AND THE OPINIONS OF 
THOSE OUTSIDE THE RULING ELITE ARE NEITHER SOUGHT NOR 
CONSIDERED.  WHILE THE POLITICIANS ARGUE, THE ECONOMY 
CONTINUES TO STAGNATE.  EFFORTS TO REVIVE DOMESTIC 
PRODUCTION, REBUILD THE OIL INDUSTRY, AND CONTROL 
RUINOUS INFLATION HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY INADEQUATE. 
HAVING MADE A REVOLUTION THAT REJECTED ECONOMICS AS A 
BASIS OF NATIONAL POLICY, THE NEW LEADERS ARE FINDING 
THAT PART OF KHOMEINI\'S LEGACY VERY DIFFICULT TO 
CHANGE, NOR IS THERE YET ANY OVERWHELMING PRESSURE ON 
THEM TO DO SO.  APATHY IS MORE PREVALENT THAN 
RESISTANCE AND THERE SEEMS NO SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZED 
OPPOSITION THAT WOULD THREATEN THE REVOLUTION ITSELF. 
END SUMMARY. 
- 
- 
-------------------------------------- 
THE FEW RULE AND ARGUE; THE MANY WATCH 
-------------------------------------- 
 
3.  THE MASS POLITICS, WHICH CHARACTERIZED THE IRANIAN 
REVOLUTION AND THE EARLY YEARS OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, 
ARE OVER.  PERHAPS THE LAST MANIFESTATION WAS 
KHOMEINI\'S FUNERAL.  GONE ARE THE MILLION-STRONG 
MARCHES AND DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH PROCLAIMED \"DEATH TO 
THIS\" OR \"LONG LIVE THAT\".  NOW, ZEALOTS COMPLAIN WHEN 
IRANIAN RADIO TV IGNORES TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE 
DEMONSTRATING AGAINST WOMEN\'S IMMORAL DRESS (REFTEL). 
AND A TEHRAN UNIVERSITY PROTEST AGAINST U.S.-IRAN TIES 
IS ALMOST IGNORED. 
 
- 
4.  IRAN\'S LEADERS ARE IN THE BUNKER WHERE THEY 
SQUABBLE LOUDLY AMONG THEMSELVES.  THE SUPERNUMERARIES 
WHO USED TO MARCH AND SHOUT, HOWEVER, NOW ONLY WATCH. 
MOST OF THEM HAVE SHIFTED FROM SUPPORTING THE REGIME TO 
ENDURING IT.  THEY GRASP AT ANY SIGN, SUCH AS ANOTHER 
INCH MORE EXPOSURE OF WOMEN\'S HAIR, OR FIVE MINUTES 
MORE MUSIC ON IRAN RADIO, THAT MIGHT INDICATE THINGS 
ARE GETTING BETTER. 
- 
5.  BASED ON OUR OBSERVATION, WE WOULD ILLUSTRATE THE 
BREAKDOWN OF IRANIAN POPULATION ROUGHLY AS FOLLOWS: 
 
(A) 0.5 PERCENT ARE IN THE REGIME. 
 
(B) 2.5 PERCENT SUPPORT IT. 
 
(C) 2.5 PERCENT OPPOSE IT. 
 
(D) THE REST (94.5 PERCENT) ENDURE IT. 
 
THOSE IN THE REGIME ARE TWO GROUPS:  AN OUTER CIRCLE OF 
THOSE WHO, THROUGH POSITIONS IN THE GUARDS, THE ISLAMIC 
COMMITTEES, ETC. HAVE ACCESS TO SCARCE GOODS AND 
SERVICES SUCH AS SUBSIDIZED CONSUMER GOODS AT 
SUBSIDIZED PRICES, REASONABLE HOUSING, AND UNIVERSITY 
PLACES.  AN INNER CIRCLE OF ABOUT 5,000 SENIOR CLERICS, 
MINISTERS, JUDGES, FRIDAY PREACHERS, PARLIAMENT 
DEPUTIES, AND PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, ACTUALLY RULE 
IRAN.  WITHIN THIS GROUP. TWENTY-TO-THIRTY VETERANS OF 
REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS MAKE THE DECISIONS.  THIS LAST 
GROUP INCLUDES SUCH SURVIVORS AS AYATOLLAHS ARDABILI, 
YAZDI, MESHKINI, JANNATI, MAHDAVI-KANI, AND REYSHAHRI. 
OTHER MEMBERS ARE PRESIDENT HASHEMI-RAFSANJANI, SUPREME 
LEADER KHAMENE\'I, MASHHAD BOSS VA\'EZ TABASI, PARLIAMENT 
SPEAKER MAHDI KARROUBI, AND FORMER INTERIOR MINISTER 
MOHTASHEMI-POUR. 
- 
6.  MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP ARE INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS OF 
A MACHINE.  LONG PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND TIES OF 
MARRIAGE AND BUSINESS GIVE THIS GROUP ITS COHESION. 
WHEN ONE MEMBER IS ELIMINATED BY DEATH, NATURAL OR 
OTHERWISE, ANOTHER REPLACES HIM AND POLICIES CONTINUE. 
DESPITE PERSONAL RIVALRIES, MEMBERS SHARE A LOVE OF 
POWER, A DETERMINATION TO HOLD IT AT ALL COSTS, AND A 
WORLD VIEW SHAPED BY KHOMEINI\'S UNCOMPROMISING AND 
IDIOSYNCRATIC VISION OF A UTOPIAN ISLAMIC STATE. 
- 
7.  WITHIN THE ELITE, THERE IS FREE-WHEELING VIGOROUS 
DEBATE WHICH OFTEN SPILLS INTO PUBLIC VIEW.  BUT THIS 
DEBATE IS BY AND FOR INSIDERS.  OUTSIDERS -- BE THEY 
CLERICS LIKE AYATOLLAH MONTAZERI OR NATIONALISTS LIKE 
MAHDI BAZARGAN -- ARE NOT WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE.  MOST 
IRANIANS ARE OF COURSE FREE TO WATCH AND LISTEN TO 
THEIR BETTERS ARGUE, BUT OUTSIDERS\' OPINIONS ARE 
NEITHER SOLICITED NOR CONSIDERED.  THE ELITE HAS SHOWN 
THAT, WHEN THREATENED OR QUESTIONED, IT CAN ACT 
DECISIVELY AND BRUTALLY. 
- 
- 
------------------- 
GUARDIANS OF PURITY 
------------------- 
 
8.  THE CURRENT LEADERS ARE DIVIDED OVER WHETHER IRAN 
MUST CHANGE ITS MILITANT, REJECTIONIST POLICIES IN 
ORDER TO ESTABLISH NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE OUTSIDE 
WORLD AND REBUILD HER ECONOMY.  ON ONE SIDE ARE THOSE 
WHO PUSH ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND ARGUE THAT UNDER 
PRESENT CONDITIONS A POLICY OF CONFRONTATION, SLOGANS 
AND HARSH SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS HAS ALIENATED BOTH 
IRANIANS AND FOREIGNERS FROM KHOMEINI\'S ISLAMIC 
UTOPIA.  THEY SAY THAT IRAN, WITH HER MATURE 
REVOLUTION, NO LONGER HAS ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM STABLE, 
PREDICTABLE RELATIONS WITH OTHER STATES AND SYSTEMS. 
SUCH RELATIONS MAY EVEN BRING IRAN ECONOMIC AND 
POLITICAL BENEFITS. 
- 
9.  ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE THOSE WHO, WHILE NOT 
EXPLICITLY OPPOSED TO RECONSTRUCTION OR IMPROVED LIVING 
CONDITIONS, RESIST THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CHANGES 
SUCH STEPS WOULD REQUIRE.  FOR THEM, GUARDING THE 
PURITY OF KHOMEINI\'S VISION COMES BEFORE ALL THINGS. 
THEIR BANNER IS THE \"IMAM\'S LINE\", A SHORTHAND FOR 
NEGATIVE AND SIMPLISTIC THINKING THAT HAS LED TO THE 
ISLAMIC REPUBLIC\'S EXCESSES AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE 
POLICIES.  IF GUARDING THAT VISION MEANS IRAN\'S 
CURRENCY IS WORTHLESS, THAT HER FACTORIES PRODUCE 
NOTHING, AND THAT HER OIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO 
DETERIORATE, THEN SO BE IT.  SUCH THINGS WERE NEVER 
IMPORTANT TO THE IMAM AND WHY SHOULD THE GUARDIANS OF 
HIS LEGACY CONSIDER SUCH THINGS? 
- 
- 
------------------------- 
NOW FOR THE VERY BAD NEWS 
------------------------- 
 
10.  THE IRANIAN ECONOMY IS A DISASTER.  EVEN THOSE WHO 
BENEFIT BY SPECULATIONS IN CURRENCIES AND SCARCE 
COMMODITIES ADMIT THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO 
RESTART ECONOMIC ENGINES THAT HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN SINCE 
1979.  THE IRANIAN RIAL IS ALMOST WORTHLESS (NOW 
TRADING AT ABOUT 1350 TO THE U.S. DOLLAR) AND THE 
RESULTING INFLATION HAS DESTROYED THE PURCHASING POWER 
OF WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS AND OF PENSIONERS.  TOP 
GOVERNMENT SALARIES ARE EQUIVALENT TO USD 150 PER 
MONTH, AND MOST EMPLOYEES MUST HAVE SECOND JOBS. 
- 
11.  IRANIAN INDUSTRY IS PRODUCING AT ABOUT THIRTY 
PERCENT OF CAPACITY.  MUCH OF IRAN\'S FOREIGN CURRENCY 
EARNINGS GO FOR IMPORTS OF FOOD AND CONSUMER GOODS - 
REFRIGERATORS, TELEVISIONS, CAR BATTERIES, TIRES, ETC. 
-- WHICH HAVE NO DIRECT AFFECT ON PRODUCTIVITY. 
OVER-REGULATION OF IMPORTS HAS LED TO CORRUPTION AND 
PROFITEERING AS SUBSIDIZED GOODS IMPORTED UNDER STATE 
LICENSES ARE DIVERTED TO THE FREE MARKET FOR LARGE 
PROFITS.  MANY ENTERPRISES ARE UNDER CONTROL OF THE 
LARGE \"FOUNDATIONS\" WHICH HAVE STRANGLED PRODUCTIVITY 
AND PROFITS IN THE NAME OF ISLAMIC SOCIAL JUSTICE. 
- 
12.  IRAN HAS AN ENORMOUS HIDDEN DEBT WHICH SOME 
ESTIMATE AT USD 200-300 BILLION.  THIS DEBT IS WHAT 
IRAN DID NOT SPEND IN THE LAST TEN YEARS ON THE OIL 
INDUSTRY, ROADS, POWER STATIONS, PORTS, SCHOOLS AND 
HOSPITALS.  IT IS ALSO WHAT SHE DID NOT EARN FROM 
NEGLECTED OR RUINED INVESTMENTS.  INSTEAD, IRAN FOR TEN 
YEARS PUMPED AND SOLD CRUDE OIL TO BUY FOOD AND 
WEAPONS, AND INVESTED ALMOST NOTHING IN HER ECONOMY. 
FROM 1978, HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS -- FROM THOSE STILL ON 
PAPER TO THOSE NEEDING ONLY THREE BOLTS TO FINISH -- 
WERE ABANDONED AND LEFT FOR RUST AND VANDALS TO DESTROY. 
- 
13.  AS A DELIBERATE POLICY, THE AUTHORITIES ENCOURAGED 
THOUSANDS OF IRANIANS, WHO COULD NOT ADJUST TO THE 
RESTRICTIONS OF LIFE IN AN ISLAMIC REPUBLIC, TO LEAVE 
THE COUNTRY.  ALTHOUGH OFFICIALS TALK ABOUT THEIR 
RETURN, THERE ARE FEW SIGNS THAT THE ORIGINAL POLICIES 
THAT DROVE THEM OUT ARE CHANGING.  MANY TRAINED AND 
WELL-EDUCATED IRANIANS WHO HAVE NOT LEFT HAVE, FOR BOTH 
ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL REASONS, GIVEN UP WORKING IN 
THEIR SPECIALTIES AND EARN A LIVING IN THE FLOURISHING 
BLACK MARKET.  OTHERS, WHO HAVE STUCK IT OUT FOR TEN 
YEARS IN THE HOPE OF BETTER TIMES, ARE GIVING UP AND 
LOOKING FOR ESCAPE ROUTES. 
- 
14.  THE ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION WERE 
FOR SHOW ONLY.  GIVEN IRAN\'S ENORMOUS ECONOMIC NEEDS, 
THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED ARE INSIGNIFICANT.  THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S MAIN PURPOSES WERE POLITICAL:  TO SHOW 
THAT IRAN HAD FRIENDS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND TO SHOW 
THE PEOPLE THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS \"DOING SOMETHING\" IN 
THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. 
- 
- 
-------------- 
POOR PROSPECTS 
-------------- 
 
15.  POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS ARE POOR. 
ALTHOUGH SOME INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP SAY 
IRAN MUST GIVE UP BANKRUPT SLOGANS AND STOP MAKING 
NEEDLESS ENEMIES, THEIR VIEWS HAVE NOT LED TO ANY 
CONSISTENT NEW POLICY.  ONE DAY LEADERS SPEAK OF 
TOLERANCE, THE NEXT DAY THEY LAUNCH A NEW CAMPAIGN 
AGAINST UNISLAMIC DRESS AND BEHAVIOR.  TALK OF CHANGE 
HAS REMAINED TALK, APPARENTLY MUCH OF IT AIMED AT 
CONVINCING FOREIGNERS TO EXTEND CREDITS AND MAKE 
INVESTMENTS.  SLOGANEERING AND IDEOLOGY MAY NO LONGER 
HAVE THE MASS APPEAL OF TEN YEARS AGO, BUT THEY ARE 
STILL POWERFUL WEAPONS IN TEHRAN\'S POWER STRUGGLES. 
MANY OF TODAY\'S LEADERS CAME TO POWER BY IMITATING 
KHOMEINI\'S OBSTINATE REFUSAL TO COMPROMISE, AND THEY 
WILL NOT EASILY ABANDON THIS FORMULA. 
 
- 
16.  IRAN\'S POPULATION GROWTH IS OUT OF CONTROL, 
GROWING AT MORE THAN THREE PERCENT PER YEAR.  THE 
COMBINATION OF POPULATION GROWTH AND NO INVESTMENT 
MEANS THAT SERVICES -- SCHOOLS, WATER, TRANSPORT, AND 
ELECTRICITY -- ARE BREAKING DOWN UNDER THE PRESSURE. 
AFTER LIVING OFF THE STORED FAT FROM THE PREVIOUS 
REGIME FOR TEN YEARS, IRAN WILL EITHER HAVE TO MAKE 
RADICAL POLITICAL CHANGES TO REBUILD OR RESIGN ITSELF 
TO PERMANENT THIRD-WORLD POVERTY. 
- 
- 
------------------------------- 
POLITICAL BACKSWING NOT EVIDENT 
------------------------------- 
 
17.  DETERIORATING LIVING STANDARDS AND THE LACK OF 
CHARISMATIC LEADERSHIP HAS, AND WILL, LEAD TO OUTBURSTS 
OF FRUSTRATION.  BUT THESE SHOW NO SIGN OF 
TRANSFORMATION INTO SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL PROBLEMS FOR 
THE REVOLUTION AS A WHOLE.  THERE IS NO ORGANIZED 
OPPOSITION WITH STRENGTH CAPABLE OF THREATENING THE 
REGIME\'S GRIP ON POWER.  THE DISPUTES MANIFEST IN THE 
SPEECHES AND THE PRESS ARE WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE 
REVOLUTION ITSELF.  THERE IS LITTLE HAPPENING IN  THE 
STREETS AND IT IS NO THREAT.  APATHY AND WAR WEARINESS 
PROVIDE A KIND OF SUPPORT THROUGH INERTIA.  MOST 
IRANIANS WE SPEAK TO PREFER THIS REGIME -- IT IS THE 
DEVIL THEY KNOW -- TO THE IDEOLOGY OF MOHAHEDIN AL 
KHALQ OR A RETURN TO A DISCREDITED MONARCHY.  AND WHILE 
TODAY\'S LEADERS FEUD OVER MANY ISSUES, THEY REMAIN 
HIGHLY AWARE OF THEIR COLLECTIVE POSITION AND POWER. 
THEY RARELY THREATEN EACH OTHER PERSONALLY.  THERE IS 
NO APPARENT LESSENING OF THEIR ABILITY TO DEAL 
RUTHLESSLY AND EFFECTIVELY WITH THEIR OPPONENTS OR 
THOSE WHO QUESTION THEIR RIGHT TO RULE.  SO FAR, 
DESPITE THEIR INEPTNESS IN MANY AREAS, THE REVOLUTION\'S 
INNER CIRCLE LOOKS CAPABLE OF SURVIVING.  WALKER

2.  SUMMARY:  THE SUMMIT, IN OUR VIEW, LEAVES ARAB 
POLITICS ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE.  ARAFAT, UNDER SEVERE 
INTERNAL PLO PRESSURE TO JUSTIFY HIS PEACE PROCESS 
APPROACH, SEEMED DRIVEN BY A SENSE OF USG BAD FAITH. 
THE SAUDIS WERE A SOLID ROCK OF GOOD SENSE AND THE 
EGYPTIANS, THOUGH THEY LOST SOME BATTLES ON 
COMMUNIQUE RHETORIC, LOST NO PRESTIGE TO SADDAM.  AS 
AN EXPONENT OF LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR ARAB FEARS 
AND ASPIRATIONS, SADDAM TOOK A STEP FORWARD.  BUT IT 
WAS THE ROILING EVENTS AROUND ARAFAT--NOT IRAQI 
BLUSTERING--THAT PUT THE HEAT ON MUBARAK TO SHOW THAT 
MODERATION CAN AND WILL WORK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. ON THIS THURSDAY HOLIDAY MORNING AFTER THE BAGHDAD 
SUMMIT, THERE ARE FEW ARAB DIPLOMATS AVAILABLE WITH 
WHOM WE CAN COMPARE NOTES.  THE FOLLOWING IS, THERE- 
FORE, CHIEFLY OUR OWN THOUGHTS AND NOTES ON THE 
EVENTS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DEBATES OF THE PAST 
THREE DAYS. 
 
A SUCCESSFUL SUMMIT? 
-------------------- 
 
4.  A SENIOR ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARIAT SOURCE RESOLUTELY 
ASSERTED PLEASURE WITH WHAT HE CALLED A \"MODERATE\" 
OUTCOME.  THE ADVISOR TO KLIBI SAID MANY 
DELEGATES HAD BEEN FEARFUL OF A BAGHDAD SUMMIT: 
\"WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT SORT OF ADVENTURE SADDAM 
HUSSEIN WOULD LEAD US INTO\"\"  IN FACT, SAID THIS 
ARAB DIPLOMAT, THE SECRETARIAT FOUND THAT SADDAM 
OFTEN ACTED AS AN ARBITER, TAKING HIS ROLE AS HOST 
AND CHAIRMAN SERIOUSLY.  AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE ALSO TOLD 
US THAT THE IRAQI BULLDOZER HAS DRIVEN CHIEFLY BY 
TARIQ AZIZ IN THE FOREIGN MINISTERS\' DRAFTING 
SESSIONS, WHERE REPORTEDLY THE EGYPTIAN FOREIGN 
MINISTER TOLD HIM AND PLO \"FONMIN\" QADDUMI MORE 
THAN ONCE THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT UP WITH THEIR 
RUDENESS. 
 
5.  WE FIND IT CURIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE 
RESULTS OF THIS SUMMIT FROM THE U.S. POINT OF 
VIEW.  POLITICALLY, IT WOULD APPEAR NONE OF THE 
PRINCIPAL ARAB PROTAGONISTS ACHIEVED ANYTHING 
LIKE THEIR MAXIMUM GOALS, YET NONE WAS EMBARRASSED 
BY INABILITY TO HOLD A MINIMUM LINE.  THE EXCEPTION 
TO THIS COULD BE KING HUSSEIN--WE SIMPLY DO NOT 
YET KNOW IF HE HAS RECEIVED FIRM PLEDGES OF FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT. 
 
6.  WHILE WE SEE UNWELCOME LANGUAGE IN THE 
COMMUNIQUE, PARTICULARLY ON THE PEACE PROCESS 
(E.G., THE PERENNIAL CALL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL 
CONFERENCE) AND ON WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, WE 
CAN SEE NOTHING WHICH HEMS IN MOVEMENT IN A 
MODERATE DIRECTION, SHOULD THE MODERATES WISH 
TO CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS.  WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT, 
AS A BRITISH JOURNALIST HAS WRITTEN, THE SUMMIT 
ITSELF WAS IN A SENSE A \"CRY OF PAIN\" FROM THE 
PALESTINIANS, THE EMOTIONAL CONTEXT OF EVENTS DID 
NOT UPSET THE PEACE PROCESS APPLE CART. 
 
NO LETTER FOR BUSH/GORBACHEV 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  THE VIRTUAL STALEMATE BETWEEN EGYPTIANS AND 
SAUDIS VERSUS THE IRAQIS AND LIBYANS HAD NO 
MORE EMBARRASSINGLY PUBLIC FAILURE THAN THE 
INABILITY TO AGREE ON THE LETTER WHICH THE 
IRAQI MEDIA IN PARTICULAR ANNOUNCED WOULD BE A 
PRIMARY AIM OF THE MEETING.  INABILITY TO AGREE ON EVEN 
A CLEAR STATEMENT OF VIEWS CONCERNING THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT MIDDLE EAST EVENT IN MANY DECADES, 
I.E., SOVIET-JEWISH EMIGRATION, WILL BE SEEN BY 
THE WEST AS A BLACK EYE FOR \"ARAB UNITY.\"  BUT 
FROM OUR VIEWPOINT IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A 
DEMONSTRATION THAT SOME ARAB LEADERS ARE AT LAST 
WILLING TO FACE FACTS, AND FAHD WAS THE BEST 
EXAMPLE OF ALL. 
 
 
FAHD THE STATESMAN 
------------------ 
 
8. AS EMBASSY RIYADH SUGGESTED, BY ALL ACCOUNTS THE 
SAUDIS HAVE BEEN TOUGH AND ACTIVE SINCE FOREIGN 
MINISTER SAUD ARRIVED HERE MAY 22.  MAINTAINING   THE 
PENINSULAR BEDOUIN GOOD TASTE OF NOT WASHING 
LAUNDRY IN PUBLIC, BOTH FAHD AND SAUD WERE CLEAR 
AND DETERMINED IN THE PRIVATE SESSIONS. 
 
SADDAM: SATISFIED 
----------------- 
 
9. SADDAM WANTED TO CHANGE ARAB STRATEGY.  UNTIL THE 
LAST HOURS OF THE SUMMIT, HE TRIED TO DO SO, IN- 
CLUDING BY USING ALL THE FORCES OF HIS MEDIA.  HE 
FAILED.  IT IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF HIS EFFORTS THAT 
WE SEE OBJECTIONABLE PHRASEOLOGY IN THE COMMUNIQUE, 
BUT THOSE WORDS DO NOT CHANGE ARAB STRATEGY.  ON 
THE OTHER HAND, WE THINK THAT HE HAS ACHIEVED ANOTHER 
AIM, FURTHER IMPROVING HIS IMAGE, AS A JOURNALIST 
HAS SAID, MOVING FROM \"WARRIOR\" TO \"WARRIOR STATES- 
MAN.\"     HE HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CREATING A 
CONSTITUENCY OF THOSE ARABS, INCLUDING PALESTINIANS, 
DEEPLY FRUSTRATED BY LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  AS LONG AS THE MODERATE  EGYPT/USG APPRAOCH 
DOES NOT WORK, THE NATURAL CONSTITUENCY FOR SADDAM\'S 
LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR POPULISM WILL GROW. 
 
ARAFAT--THE HOT SEAT 
-------------------- 
 
10.  WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THE UNANIMOUS REPORTS OF 
ARAFAT\'S DEEP CONCERN DURING THE SUMMIT ABOUT HIS OWN 
ABILITY TO HOLD HIS MAINSTREAM IN THE MODERATE 
CURRENT.  AN EMOTIONAL MAN, HE WAS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 
SHAKEN BY HIS GENEVA EXPERIENCE (THE PERCEPTION OF 
U.S. \"BETRAYAL\").  HE DID SEEM TO SPEND MORE TIME 
COORDINATING WITH SADDAM THAN WITH MUBARAK, AND HAD A 
TWO-HOUR MEETING AT THE END (REPORTEDLY ONE-ON-ONE), 
WITH KING HUSAYN).  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE CONFIRMED IT 
WAS ARAFAT WHO PUSHED (UNSUCCESSFULLY) FOR CREATION 
OF A JOINT ARAB DEFENSE FORCE, WHICH SUGGESTS A 
PERCEIVED NEED TO PLAY TO HIS RADICAL WING.  HIS 
SPEECH IN OPEN SESSION, EVEN THOUGH EMOTIONALLY 
DELIVERED, WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND ELOQUENT DESCRIPTION 
OF PALESTINIAN PAIN AND CONFUSION. 
 
QADHAFI\'S ACTIVITIES 
-------------------- 
 
11.  QADHAFI REMAINED SILENT THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC 
SESSIONS OF THE SUMMIT, POINTEDLY APPLAUDING ANY 
ANTI-AMERICAN REMARKS.  HE SPOKE ONLY ON THE FINAL 
DAY.  WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRO FORMA STATEMENT 
CONGRATULATING THE SUMMIT AND SADDAM, TURNED INTO A 
RAMBLING SPEECH.  INTER ALIA, HE CHARGED THAT THE 
U.S. F-111\'S, THE PLANES SENT TO \"KILL\" HIM AND HIS 
CHILDREN, HAD BEEN MOVED FROM TURKEY TO IRAQ\'S 
BORDERS TO FRIGHTEN IRAQ.  HE CLAIMED: \"WE WILL 
DESTROY THE JEWS;\" PUTTING JEWS IN THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES WAS \"PUTTING THEM IN A CEMETERY\" RATHER 
THAN THE PROMISED LAND.  HIS REMARKS WERE SO 
DESPICABLE THAT SADDAM OSTENTATIOUSLY DISASSOCIATED 
HIMSELF AND THE SUMMIT FROM THEM. 
 
12.  WE CAN PROVIDE TENUOUS CONFIRMATION OF THE 
RUMORS (DAMASCUS 3325) THAT QADHAFI FROM DAMASCUS 
SENT AN ENVOY TO SADDAM IN A LAST MINUTE ATTEMPT TO 
RECONCILE SADDAM AND ASAD.  ACCORDING TO A GULF 
DIPLOMAT, THE PILOT OF THE PLANE CARRYING HIS 
COUNTRY\'S DELEGATION TO BAGHDAD ON MAY 27 HEARD IRAQI 
CONTROLLERS TALKING WITH THE PILOT OF A LIBYAN PLANE 
ENROUTE FROM DAMASCUS TO BAGHDAD, TWENTY-FOUR HOURS 
BEFORE QADHAFI HIMSELF ARRIVED FOR THE SUMMIT. 
 
U.S. \"MEMORANDUM\" 
----------------- 
 
13.  THE TALKING POINTS FOR NEA AMBASSADORS HAVE 
ENTERED HISTORY AS A MEMORANDUM FROM THE USG TO THE 
AL.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AL SYG KLIBI HAS 
BEEN INSTRUCTED TO ADMONISH THE \"U.S. AMBASSADOR\" 
ABOUT THIS INTERFERENCE IN ARAB AFFAIRS. 
 
14.  WE WERE STRUCK BY THE JORDAN TIMES STORY THAT 
OUR MEMORANDUM \"DEMANDED\" THAT IRAQ SIGN ON TO A 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS BAN WITHOUT REGARD TO ISRAEL\'S 
NONADHERENCE TO THE NPT.  THAT REPORT CAME FROM A 
JOURNALIST CLOSE TO THE PLO (JN2905093290) AND MAY 
REFLECT A MORE AND MORE JAUNDICED PLO VIEW OF THE 
EQUITY OF THE USG APPROACH TO MIDDLE EAST ISSUES. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
---------- 
 
15.  FOR THE RECORD, FOLLOWING ARE THE DECISIONS THE 
SUMMIT TOOK THAT REQUIRE FOLLOW-UP ACTION: 
 
--REGULAR SUMMITS WILL OCCUR ANNUALLY, WITH THE NEXT 
IN CAIRO IN NOVEMBER 1990.  (COMMENT:  IRAQ HAS 
REPEATEDLY ADVOCATED THE NEED FOR ANNUAL AL SUMMITS. 
WITH THE RETURN OF AL HEADQUARTERS TO CAIRO, THE 
ISSUE OF WHERE THOSE MEETINGS CAN BE HELD HAS BEEN 
SOLVED.  AS WE UNDERSTAND IT FROM THE EGYPTIAN 
EMBASSY, IF NO COUNTRY VOLUNTEERS TO HOST A SUMMIT, 
THE AL WILL DO SO, WITH EGYPT FORMALLY DOING THE 
INVITING.) 
 
--FOREIGN, ECONOMIC AND FINANCE MINISTERS TO MEET 
WITHIN TWO MONTHS TO DISCUSS JEWISH EMIGRATION, THE 
ARAB STANCE TOWARD INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC BLOCS AND 
ENCOURAGING OF INVESTMENT IN ARAB COUNTRIES.  THEY 
ARE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE NEXT SUMMIT. 
 
--BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH JORDAN ON ASSISTANCE. 
 
--ATC TO FOLLOW UP IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TA\'IF 
AGREEMENT. 
 
--ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL FUND TO ASSIST 
LEBANON. 
 
--FOREIGN MINISTERS TO COMPLETE AMENDMENTS TO THE AL 
CHARTER AND SUBMIT THEM TO THE NEXT SUMMIT (MAJORITY 
RULE REVISITED?). 
 
--ACTION AGAINST ANY STATE RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM AS 
THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. 
 
--EFFORTS TO PREVENT REPEAL OF UNGA RSOLUTION 3379, 
\"ZIONISM AS RACISM.\" 
- 
NO RESOLUTIONS 
-------------- 
 
16. AT THIS SUMMIT, WE ARE TOLD, THERE WERE NO 
RESOLUTIONS, JUST THE COMMUNIQUE. 
 
IRAQI MEDIA REACTION 
-------------------- 
 
17.  IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED MEDIA DID NOT SEEM TO 
SUPPRESS ANY PUBLIC STATEMENT OR EVENT.  ALL OPEN 
SESSION SPEECHES BY SUMMIT PARTICIPANTS WERE PRINTED 
IN FULL IN THE LOCAL PRESS.  THE GOI\'S PR MACHINERY 
HAD NO COMMENT ON THE SUMMIT MAY 31 OTHER THAN TO 
HAIL IT AS A GREAT SUCCESS.  IRAQI TV PROVIDED FULL 
COVERAGE OF \"OPEN\" SESSIONS, ALBEIT WITH A TWO-HOUR 
DELAY, AND DID NOT EDIT OUT UNEXPECTED INTIMATE 
MOMENTS (E.G., MUBARAK HARANGUING SADDAM IN THE HALL; 
QADHAFI SLICKING BACK HIS HAIR PRIOR TO A GRAND 
ENTRANCE). 
 
FOR KHARTOUM AND MOGADISHU 
-------------------------- 
 
18.  WE APOLOGIZE THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SO SHORT-HANDED 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TRANSLATE SUMMIT SPEECHES OF 
YOUR PRESIDENTS, BUT WE WILL POUCH ARABIC VERSIONS 
ASAP.

SUBJECT:  REPORT THAT ABU NIDAL IS IN IRAQ 
 
1. (S) FOLLOWING FOR POSTS\' INFORMATION IS AN 
UNCONFIRMED REPORT THAT ABU NIDAL IS PRESENTLY IN 
BAGHDAD AND OTHER INFORMATION ON THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) PROVIDED BY A FRENCH 
COUNTER-TERRORISM EXPERT.  THE INFORMATION THAT ABU 
NIDAL IS CURRENTLY IN BAGHDAD IS AT SHARP VARIANCE WITH 
INFORMATION PROVIDED RECENTLY BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT 
AND AVAILABLE TO US FROM OTHER SOURCES DEEMED RELIABLE. 
THE INFORMATION TRACKS CLOSELY WITH PLO-GENERATED RUMORS 
CIRCULATING IN BAGHDAD IN LATE MAY.  THESE RUMORS 
ASSERTED THAT ABU NIDAL HAD BEEN REFUSED ENTRY INTO IRAQ. 
 
2. (S) HOWEVER, GIVEN HIGH PRIORITY USG ATTACHES TO 
PUTTING ABU NIDAL OUT OF BUSINESS AND GOOD PAST 
INFORMATION FROM THIS SOURCE, WE WANTED TO SHARE HIS 
INFORMATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THE ANO.  RECENT ATTACKS 
AGAINST ANO DISSIDENTS IN ALGERIA AND SYRIA SUGGEST THAT 
THE ANO MAY BE TRYING TO RE-ESTABLISH ITS TERRORIST 
CREDENTIALS AND PLANNING OTHER ATTACKS.  DEPARTMENT IS 
PARTICULARLY EAGER TO KEEP THE ANO ISOLATED AND OFF 
BALANCE.  DEPARTMENT WANTS TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE 
EXISTING PRESSURE ON LIBYA AND ANY OTHER POTENTIAL STATE 
SPONSORS TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES CLEARLY FROM THIS 
TERRORIST GROUP.  POSTS ARE REQUESTED TO KEEP ANO ON 
TERRORISM AGENDA WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS, STRESSING ITS 
BLOODY TERRORIST RECORD AND THE NEED FOR ALL STATES TO 
WORK TOGETHER TO PUT THE ANO OUT OF BUSINESS AND TO KEEP 
ITS MEMBERS ON THE RUN.  LONDON AND KHARTOUM SEE ACTION 
REQUEST PARA 8. 
 
3. (C) SOURCE IS A PRIVATE FRENCH COUNTER-TERRORISM 
EXPERT WHO HAS EXCELLENT CONTACTS WITH EUROPEAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND MIDDLE EASTERN GROUPS.  IN 
MARCH, EXPERT REPORTED CONTACTS BETWEEN THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) AND IRAQ TO DISCUSS BOTH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ANO OPERATIONS TO BAGHDAD AND THE 
STATUS OF ABU NIDAL\'S PROPERTY (CHICKEN FARMS) IN IRAQ. 
AT THAT TIME, HIS SOURCES SAID IRAQ HAD POLITELY REFUSED 
TO READMIT THE ANO.  SIMILAR INFORMATION WAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY REPORTED IN OTHER CHANNELS. 
 
4. (C) BEGIN CURRENT REPORT OF FRENCH TERRORISM EXPERT: 
ACCORDING TO TWO NON-PALESTINIAN SOURCES -- ONE OF WHOM 
WAS IN IRAQ WEEK OF MAY 28, ABU NIDAL HAD VERY RECENTLY 
ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD FOR QUOTE HEALTH TREATMENTS END 
QUOTE.  HE IS NOT PARTICULARLY ILL, BUT IS SPENDING TIME 
IN A HOSPITAL FOR REST GIVEN HIS GENERALLY WEAKENED 
PHYSICAL STATE.  THE MOVE IS THE RESULT OF PRESSURE ON 
LIBYA FROM ITS NORTH AFRICAN NEIGHBORS AND ABU NIDAL\'S 
DESIRE TO FIND A NEW BASE OF OPERATIONS.  THERE IS NO 
WORD AS TO HOW LONG THE HEALTH TREATMENTS WILL TAKE OR 
IF IRAQ HAS AUTHORIZED ABU NIDAL TO PLAN OR LAUNCH 
OPERATIONS WHILE IN IRAQ. 
 
5. (C) THE LATE APRIL ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF ANO 
DISSIDENT ISA IN ALGIERS GENERATED A MINI-GOVERNMENTAL 
CRISIS IN ALGIERS.  FIRST, THE ASSAILANTS SOUGHT REFUGE 
IN THE HOME OF THE FORMER CHIEF OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE 
AND HID THERE FOR TWO DAYS BEFORE BEING DISCOVERED. 
THIS SPARKED A SHARP DEBATE ABOUT HOW INVOLVED THE 
FORMER ALGERIAN OFFICIAL HAD BEEN IN THE ATTACK.  WHEN 
THE ALGERIANS DETAINED THE ASSAILANTS AND PROTESTED TO 
ANO, ABU NIDAL SENT BACK CLEAR THREATS TO TAKE COUNTER 
HOSTAGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  THE ALGERIANS THEN 
PROTESTED TO QADAFHI, ARGUING THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR LIBYA TO ALLOW SUCH OPERATIONS TO BE 
LAUNCHED AND SUCH THREATS TO BE MADE FROM ITS TERRITORY 
AGAINST LIBYA\'S NEIGHBORS, ESPECIALLY IN AN ERA OF 
REGIONAL INTEGRATION.  TUNISIA MADE SIMILAR STRONG 
DEMARCHES, GIVEN WORRIES THAT ANO WOULD LAUNCH ATTACKS 
AGAINST ANO DISSIDENTS IN TUNIS.  (EXPERT NOTED THAT ANO 
HAD LAUNCHED OPERATIONS AGAINST DISSIDENTS ELSEWHERE AS 
PART OF AN EFFORT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS STILL VITAL.) 
 
6. (C) GIVEN THIS PRESSURE, LIBYAN LEADER QADHAFI \"GAVE 
HIS PERMISSION\" FOR ABU NIDAL TO LEAVE LIBYA.  EXPERT 
SPECULATES THAT QADHAFI MAY HAVE INTERVENED WITH SADDAM 
HUSSEIN TO WIN PERMISSION FOR THE QUOTE MEDICAL END 
QUOTE VISIT BY ABU NIDAL TO BAGHDAD. 
 
7. (C) FRENCH EXPERT ADDED THAT IRAQ\'S REPORTED DECISION 
TO ACCEPT AN ABU NIDAL VISIT FITS WITH THE GENERAL 
HARDENING OF ITS STANCE ON THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
QUESTION.  HE SAID FROM SEPARATE SOURCES HE HAS BEEN 
TOLD THAT AHMED JABRIL SENT A REPRESENTATIVE TO IRAQ FOR 
TALKS ABOUT OPENING AN OFFICE.  NO DECISION HAS 
REPORTEDLY BEEN MADE, BUT JABRIL\'S MOVE HAS GENERATED A 
GOOD DEAL OF CONCERN IN DAMASCUS, EXPERT WAS TOLD. 
 
8. (C) EXPERT SAID CONTRARY TO THE POSITIVE SPIN WHICH 
PLO LEADER ABU IYAD PUTS ON HIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
ANO, THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS REGAINING STRENGTH AND 
POSES A SERIOUS THREAT.  HE SAYS ANO HAS BEEN PRESSURING 
THE NEW GOVERNMENT IN SUDAN AND THAT THE FIVE ANO 
TERRORISTS HELD THERE WILL REPORTEDLY SOON BE RELEASED. 
(SOURCE ADDED THAT CURRENT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT IN MORE 
FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO ANTI-ISRAELI GROUPS, PARTICULARLY 
THOSE WITH AN ISLAMIC ORIENTATION, THAN PREVIOUS 
REGIME.  THE PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), FOR EXAMPLE, 
REPORTEDLY HAS AN ACTIVE CELL IN THE SUDAN APPARENTLY 
WITH TACIT SUDANESE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, AND HE SAYS, AND 
PLANS TO BEGIN TRAINING THERE.)  BELGIUM IS ABOUT TO 
SUCCUMB TO ANO PRESSURES TO RELEASE SAYD NASR AND 
PERHAPS PAY A RANSOM TO GET THE REMAINING SILCO HOSTAGES 
BACK, HE SAYS.  END COMMENTS OF FRENCH TERRORISM EXPERT. 
 
9. (C) FOR KHARTOUM AND LONDON: WOULD APPRECIATE UPDATE 
ON STATUS OF THE ACROPOLE/SUDAN CLUB FIVE ANO 
PRISONERS.  YOU MAY CITE AN UNCONFIRMED REPORT OF NEW 
ANO PRESSURE ON THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT AND A POSSIBLE 
RELEASE IN MAKING THIS APPROACH.  WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE 
EMBASSY KHARTOUM\'S VIEW ON SUDANESE GOVERNMENT\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM AND ON REPORTED PRESENCE OF 
TERRORIST GROUPS, SUCH AS PIJ, IN SUDAN.

SUBJECT: IRAQ IS NOT BLINKING 
 
REF: BAGHDAD 4210 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  IT IS IRAQI \"RIGHTS,\" INCLUDING TO 
RUMAYLA OIL, WHICH PUSHES VISITING MEDIA FOR VISITING 
MUBARAK INTO SECOND PLACE IN THE JULY 24 
HEADLINES.  KUWAITI LEADERS ARE URGED TO OUST 
THEIR FOREIGN MINISTER FOR PRO-U.S. POLICIES 
AND THE UAE IS OFFICIALLY LABELED A 
\"CONSPIRATOR\" WITH THE U.S. AGAINST THE ARABS. 
IRAQ INSERTS IN GENEVA ITS VIEW THAT OIL SHOULD 
BE \"NOT LESS THAN USD 25\" AND CLAIMS THE SAG AGREES. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  THE GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED IRAQI PRESS ON 
JULY 25 GAVE EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT MUBARAK\'S 
THREE-HOUR VISIT THE PREVIOUS DAY SMALL 
HEADLINES, A FRONT PAGE PHOTO, AN UNINFORMATIVE 
REPORT ON INSIDE PAGES, AND NO EDITORIAL COMMENT. 
ARAB LEAGUE SYG KLIBI\'S PRESENCE RECEIVED 
VIRTUALLY NO PRESS ATTENTION. 
 
4.  BY CONTRAST, THE PRESS GAVE A RED BANNER TO 
FONMIN TARIQ AZIZ\' ASSERTION (IN HIS SECOND 
LETTER TO ARAB LEAGUE SYG--REFTEL) THAT THE 
RUMAYLA OIL FIELD IS IRAQI \"BY NAME AND TERRITORY.\" 
(WE PRESUME THIS WAS SADDAM\'S MESSAGE TO MUBARAK.) 
TEXT OF AZIZ\' JULY 21 LETTER (FBIS JN2407093790) 
AND THAT OF DEPUTY PRIMIN SA\'DUN HAMMADI TO KUWAITI 
RULER (FBIS JN2407102990) ARE BOTH PRINTED IN FULL IN 
ARABIC AND ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS, AND ARE SUMMARIZED 
IN REFTEL. 
 
5.  THE GOI IS CONTINUING ITS PUBLIC ATTACK ON 
KUWAIT AND ITS RULERS.  FONMIN AZIZ, IN A 
STATEMENT TO REPORTERS JULY 24, REJECTFD THE GOK\'S 
PROPOSAL THAT THE BORDER DISPUTE GO TO 
ARBITRATION AND SUGGESTED INSTEAD THAT THE PROBLEM 
BE SOLVED BILATERALLY.  FURTHER, HE CALLED ON THE 
KUWAITI LEADERSHIP TO EXPEL THE \"CIRCLES OF 
CONSPIRACY\" (I.E., THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
OVERPRODUCTION AND FOR THE PRO-U.S. POLICY), 
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE CONSPIRACY AND EXPEL 
CONSPIRATORS FROM DECISION MAKING POSITIONS (A 
TRANSPARENT CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF KUWAITI FONMIN 
SABAHAL-AHMAD). 
 
6.  EDITORIALS ALL CONCENTRATE ON ATTACKING KUWAIT 
AND ITS RULERS, REITERATING THE GOI\'S EARLIER 
CLAIMS AND ADDING A FEW NEW TWISTS.  \"ATH-THAWRA\'S\" 
PAGE ONE MAIN EDITORIAL ACCUSES THE KUWAITI RULERS 
OF BEING \"LIARS, THIEVES AND U-S. AGENTS.\"  ITS 
OTHER FRONT PAGE EDITORIAL, BY A LIBYAN, CHARGES 
THAT THE KUWAITIS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST 
PAN-ARABISM, ALIGNED WITH FOREIGNERS AND IMPORTED 
ASIAN WORKERS, THEREBY EXPELLING PALESTINIANS 
AND EGYPTIANS.  A  PAGE TWO EDITORIAL CLAIMS THAT 
THE ONLY SOLIDARITY THE KUWAITIS UNDERSTAND IS 
THAT OF AMASSING MONEY IN SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS 
THROUGH A CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE ARAB NATTON. 
 
U.S. NAVAL ACTIVITY 
------------------- 
 
7.  ALL PAPERS HIGHLIGHT OFFICIAL GOI SPOKESMAN\'S 
COMMENTS ON THE PENTAGON STATEMENT THAT THE U.S. 
AND UAE NAVIES ARE UNDERTAKING A JOINT OPERATION. 
\"THE CONSPIRATORS ARE SEARCHING FOR PRETEXTS AND 
COVERS TO MAKE THE PRESENCE OF THE U.S. FLEET ON 
ACCEPTABLE FACT IN THE REGION\" IS ONE HEADLINE. 
\"THE CONSPIRATORS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED PUBLICLY FOR 
CONSPIRING AGAINST IRAQ AND THE ARAB NATION\" RUNS 
A SUB-HEADLINE.  (COMMENT:  IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO 
THE \"SPOKESMAN\" WAS, WHETHER FROM THE MFA, 
PRESIDENCY OR MINDEF.) 
 
OIL USD 25 A BARREL 
------------------- 
 
8.  JULY 25 PRESS ALSO HEADLINES PRESS CONFERENCE 
OF IRAQI OILMIN SHALABI ON HIS DEPARTURE TO ATTEND 
THE OPEC MEETING IN GENEVA-  SHALABI REPORTEDLY SAID 
THE OPEC MEMBERS FEEL THE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY 
TAKE MEASURES TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF OIL.  THE 
MAJORITY SUPPORT IRAQ\'S POSITION.  PRICES SHOULD BE 
\"NOT LESS THAN USD 25 PER BARREL THIS YEAR,\" SHALABI 
TOLD REPORTERS, AND WHEN THEY REACH THAT LEVEL, OPEC 
SHOULD DISCUSS CEILINGS AND QUOTAS SO THAT THE PRICE 
WILL RISE TO USD 30.  THE IRAQI PRESS ALSO CLAIMS 
THAT SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA AND GABON HAVE PUBLICLY 
SUPPORTED IRAQ\'S POSITION.  U/S HAMDUN TOLD US JULY 25 
THAT THE SAUDIS WANT USD 25, ALTHOUGH IT WAS 
INR\'S UNDERSTANDING ON JULY 24 THAT SAG BELIEVES 
USD 25 IS TOO HIGH (STATE 242085). 
 
SADDAM LOBBIES THE ARAB LEAGUE 
------------------------------ 
 
9.  THE MEDIA JULY 25 ALSO HEADLINED MISSIONS BY 
IRIRAQI CABINET MINISTERS BEARING MESSAGES FROM 
SADDAM TO FELLOW ARAB LEAGUE MEMBERS.  THE 
MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR WENT TO BAHRAIN, QATAR 
AND OMAN.  (AN OMANI COLLEAGUE TELLS US THE GOI 
DID NOT/NOT BOTHER TO INFORM HIS EMBASSY THAT A 
SPECIAL EMISSARY WAS ON HIS WAY TO MUSCAT.)  THE 
MINISTER OF TRANSPORT HEADED FOR MOROCCO, 
MAURITANIA, TUNISIA (AND THE PRO).  WE PRESUME 
THE GOI DECIDED IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO SEND AN 
EMISSARY TO LIBYA BECAUSE LIBYA HAS PUBLICLY 
SUPPORTED IRAQ\'S POSITION ON OIL PRICING AND 
KUWAIT.  AN ALGERIAN EMBASSY OFFICIAL WAS NOT 
SURPRISED THE GOI DID NOT SEND ANYONE TO ALGIERS: 
THE GOA ALSO WANTS AN OIL PRICE RISE.  AND THE 
MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WAS SENT TO SUDAN, 
SOMALIA AND DJIBOUTI.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
SYRIA AND LEBANON, THE GOI HAS BEEN IN CONTACT 
WITH ALL OTHER AL MEMBERS. 
 
SOVIET VISITOR 
-------------- 
 
10. PRESS ALSO COVERS--GIVING FRONT PAGE PHOTO--TO 
CALL BY SOVIET MINISTER OF MILITARY INDUSTRIALIZATION 
ON SADDAM.  AGAIN, NO DETAILS WERE GIVEN OF THE 
DISCUSSION.  WE NOTE THAT SADDAM HAD CHANGED FROM 
HIS FRENCH-TAILORED CIVILIAN SUIT, IN WHICH HE MET 
MUBARAK, BACK INTO BA\'TH PARTY UNIFORM TO MEET THE 
RUSSIAN.  HUSAYN KAMIL, MINISTER OF INDUSTRY AND 
MILITARY INDUSTRIALIZATION, ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING. 
FONMIN AZIZ DID NOT. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.  ON THE EVE OF THE OPEC MEETING, THE GOI IS 
DEFINITELY NOT/NOT BLINKING.  RATHER, THE TONE OF 
ITS ATTACK ON KUWAIT IS EVEN SHRILLER AND MORE 
PERSONAL AGAINST THE KUWAITI RULING FAMILY THAN 
EVER BEFORE.  EDITORIALS ARE BEGINNING TO PLAY 
TO ARAFAT\'S ANGER WITH THE KUWAITIS FOR EXPELLING 
PALESTINIANS AND FONMIN AZIZ\' COMMENT ABOUT THE 
EXPELLING OF THE CONSPIRATORS IS AN OFFICIAL ATTACK 
ON THE KUWAITI ROYAL FAMILY.  THE GOI IS NOW TRYING 
TO STIR UP THE PALESTINIANS AGAINST THE KUWAITIS 
AND APPEALING TO ARAB NATIONALIST ELEMENTS AGAINST 
THEIR RULERS.

TAGS:  PREL, KU, IZ 
SUBJECT:  IRAQ BLINKS -- PROVISIONALLY 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  SADDAM HAS BLINKED:  HOSTILE 
REFERENCES TO KUWAIT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE 
MEDIA AND IRAQ WILL ATTEND A MEETING WITH 
SENIOR KUWAITI OFFICIALS IN JEDDAH.  BUT 
ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT CONTINUES STRONG HERE 
AT ALL SOCIAL LEVELS, DRIVEN BY JEALOUSY, 
BITTERNESS AND CONTEMPT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
WHAT DISPUTE? 
 
3.  AS FAR AS IRAQ\'S GOVERNMENT-DIRECTED MEDIA 
JULY 26 ARE CONCERNED, THE DISPUTE WITH KUWAIT 
IS A \"SUMMER CLOUD.\"  GONE ARE THE HEADLINES 
OUTLINING KUWAITI MISBEHAVIOUR, GONE ARE THE 
AD HOMINEM ATTACKS ON KUWAIT FONMIN SABAH, 
GONE ARE THE EDITORIALS OUTLINING IRAQ\'S CASE. 
 
4.  INSTEAD, THE MEDIA FOCUS IS BACK ON DOMESTIC 
AFFAIRS (THE DRAFT CONSTITUTION) AND THEY 
HIGHLIGHT CONTINUING DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY: 
 
- SADDAM RECEIVING A PHONE CALL FROM MUBARAK. 
(BUT MUBARAK IS NOT GIVEN CREDIT FOR MEDIATING 
AND THERE IS NO/NO MENTION OF THE UPCOMING 
KUWAIT-IRAQI MEETING IN JEDDAH). 
 
- SADDAM\'S ENVOYS DELIVERING THEIR MESSAGES IN 
THE GULF AND MAGREB. 
 
- SADDAM MEETING WITH ARAB LEAGUE SYG KLIBI TO 
DISCUSS RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE REGION AND 
ARAB ARENA.  (ALTHOUGH A PHOTOGRAPH OF KLIBI 
WITH SADDAM MADE THE FRONT PAGES, THE MEDIA 
(AND THE GOI) DOWNPLAYED HIS VISIT.  HE WAS 
SEEN OFF AT THE AIRPORT BY A MERE MFA UNDER 
SECRETARY.  KLIBI PROVES NOT TO BE A 
MAHMUD RIAD, BUT THEN TUNISIA IS NOT EGYPT). 
 
- SADDAM \"SUMMONING\" (VICE THE USUAL IRAQI 
WORD \"RECEIVING\") THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR, 
FEATURED IN ALL THE MEDIA. 
 
5.  SIGNIFICANTLY, THE IRAQI MEDIA HAVE DROPPED 
MENTION OF THE US/UAE JOINT EXERCISES.  THE 
ARMY\'S DAILY \"AL-QADISSIYAH\" GIVES FRONT PAGE 
COVERAGE TO JORDANIAN PRESS REPORTS LAUDING 
SADDAM\'S IDEA FOR ESTABLISHING AN ARAB FUND 
(WHICH IS POPULAR IN JORDAN, EGYPT AND YEMEN) 
AND CONDEMNING THE US NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE GULF. 
EDITORIALS AND COMMENTARIES RETURN TO EARLIER 
THEMES:  THE DANGER OF SOVIET JEWISH IMMIGRATION 
TO ISRAEL; THE NEED FOR ARAB UNITY; THE USG\'S 
DESIRE FOR HEGEMONY IN THE GULF. 
 
IRAQ BLINKED 
 
6.  THAT SADDAM ACCEPTED MUBARAK\'S MEDIATION 
AND AGREED TO A MEETING OF OFFICIALS IN JEDDAH 
REINFORCES OUR VIEW THAT THE CENTRAL ISSUE FOR 
IRAQ IS REVENUE, NOT THE BORDER.  EVEN BEFORE 
THE OPEC MEETING BEGAN, THE GOI\'S SABER- 
RATTLING HAD BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE SHARP 
RISE IN OIL PRICES.  THEN AT ITS JULY 25 
SESSION, OPEC REPORTEDLY CAME TOWARD THE IRAQI 
POSITION, AGREEING TO A MINIMUM PRICE OF USD 
20 PER BARREL.  WE EXPECT THE GOI TO BE 
TOUGH DURING THE OPEC MEETING TODAY (JULY 26) 
AND TO STAND OUT FOR USD 25.  BUT HAVING RAISED 
KUWAITI APPREHENSIONS SO HIGH BY CRUDE TACTICS, 
THE GOI MAY HOLD OUT FOR OTHER CONCESSIONS; 
E.G., OPENING OF THE DIRECT AIR ROUTE TO 
KUWAIT. 
 
7.  IRAQ MIGHT ALSO PRESS FOR FORGIVENESS OF 
WAR DEBTS.  THE IRAQIS HAVE TOLD US THAT THE 
GOK (BUT NOT THE SAG) CARRY THESE DEBTS ON THE 
BOOKS THEY SHOW TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
ORGANIZATIONS.  IN FACT, WE HAVE FROM A 
WESTERN EMBASSY, TWO SEPARATE SENIOR SAUDI 
SOURCES SAYING KUWAIT RECENTLY TRIED TO 
COLLECT USD TWO BILLION FROM IRAQ, EVEN 
GIVING IRAQ A JULY 31 DEADLINE.  THIS SURPRISING 
STORY, SHOULD IT PROVE TRUE, WOULD SHED 
CONSIDERABLE LIGHT ON THE IRAQI CONCLUSION 
THAT KUWAIT IS NOT AS SYMPATHETIC TO IRAQI 
FINANCIAL STRAITS AS IT SHOULD BE. 
 
KUWAIT BLINKED, TOO 
 
8.  THE IRAQIS WILL CONCLUDE THAT THE KUWAITIS 
HAVE BLINKED TOO, SINCE ACCORDING TO BBC REPORTS 
TODAY, KUWAIT HAS AGREED NOT/NOT TO ASK FOR 
HIGHER PRODUCTION QUOTAS DURING THE LAST QUARTER 
OF 1990. 
 
EGYPTIAN MEDIATION CONTINUES 
 
9.  EGYPTIAN EMBASSY CONFIDED TO US JULY 26 
THAT MUBARAK\'S ADVISOR USAMA AL-BAZ HAS 
ARRIVED IN BAGHDAD.  IRAQI MEDIA ANNOUNCED 
THAT HE MET WITH SADDAM JULY 26. 
 
DEEP ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT 
 
10.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO OVERSTATE THE DEPTH OF 
ANTI-KUWAITI SENTIMENT IN IRAQ.  THIS IS THE 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BACKDROP TO CURRENT 
TENSIONS.  THE DISLIKE IS OLD AND DEEP -- NOT 
SOMETHING TRUMPED UP BY THE MEDIA FOR THE 
OCCASION.  EVEN OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED IRAQI 
COLLEAGUES AND CONTACTS BECOME NEANDERTHAL ON 
THE ISSUE OF KUWAITIS. 
 
11.  THE KUWAITIS WHO COME TO IRAQ WITH POCKETS 
FULL OF IRAQI DINARS (PURCHASED AT THE BLACK 
MARKET RATE WHICH IS LESS THAN ONE-TENTH OF THE 
OFFICIAL RATE) AND WHICH THEY OSTENTATIOUSLY 
SPEND, ARE NOT THE EDUCATED MIDDLE CLASSES -- 
THEY GO TO EUROPE.  IRAQ GETS THE EQUIVALENT OF 
\"PO   WHITE TRASH\", THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASSES, 
WHO CAN BE SEEN IN BASRA IN THEIR SCORES ON 
A FRIDAY, AND IN THE NORTHERN SUMMER RESORTS, 
OFTEN DRUNK, SOMETIMES DISORDERLY, AND OFTEN 
GAMBLING IN THE OTHERWISE EMPTY CASINOS.  THEY 
ALSO COME TO BAGHDAD IN DROVES, PROVIDING THE 
CLIENTELE FOR CHEAP NIGHTCLUBS AND CALL GIRLS. 
 
12.  IRAQIS DEEPLY FEEL THAT THE KUWAITIS ARE 
IMMENSELY STINGY SHYLOCKS, LIVING HIGH WHILE 
IRAQ, WHICH MADE SUCH TERRIBLE SACRIFICES 
DURING THE WAR, IT STILL SUFFERING.  INDEED, 
WHEN SADDAM MADE THAT POINT TO THE AMBASSADOR 
(BAGHDAD 4237), TWO OF HIS STAFFERS (WHO BOTH, 
WE CAN SAFELY ASSUME, LOST RELATIVES IN THE 
WAR) BURST INTO TEARS.  AND AS A MEASURE OF 
JUST HOW MUCH IRAQIS DISLIKE THE KUWAITIS, 
TWO OTHER IRAQIS ON THAT DAY VOLUNTEERED TO 
US THEIR DISLIKE.  ONE COMPLAINED HIS SISTER 
COULD NOT WALK ALONE IN CENTRAL BAGHDAD 
ANY MORE BECAUSE OF HARRASSMENT FROM KUWAITIS, 
WHILE A SUCCESSFUL IRAQI TRADER COMPLAINED 
BITTERLY ABOUT THE KUWAITI OBSESSION WITH 
MONEY. 
 
13.  IRAQI ATTITUDES TO KUWAITIS CONTRAST 
SHARPLY WITH THEIR ATTITUDE TO MOST OTHER ARABS. 
NO MATTER HOW BAD RELATIONS BECOME WITH, FOR 
EXAMPLE JORDAN, THERE IS ALWAYS A FELLOW 
FEELING TOWARDS EAST JORDANIANS, A FEELING 
ABSENT TOWARD KUWAITIS. 
 
ARENS\' PROPAGANDA SUCCESSFUL 
 
14.  THE ISRAELI PRESS AND DEFMIN ARENS HAVE 
SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE IRAQIS BELIEVE THAT 
ARENS WAS SUMMONED TO WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS 
THE GULF.  CERTAINLY SADDAM EXPRESSED THIS 
VIEW IN HIS JULY 25 MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR 
AND WE INVITE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION TO ARENS\' 
TV INTERVIEW JULY 25 (FBIS TA2507201890) IN 
WHICH HE REFERS TO HIS CONVERSATION WITH 
DEFENSE SECRETARY CHENEY ON THE GULF. 
MILITARY ACTIVITY 
 
15.  JULY 26 IS THE FIRST DAY FOR A WEEK WHEN 
WE HAVE NOT/NOT SEEN RAILWAY CARS LOADED WITH 
MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN THE MARSHALLING YARDS 
IN MANSUR.  THIS COULD MEAN THAT ALL THE 
EQUIPMENT THE GOI FORCES ON THE BORDER NEED IS 
ALREADY IN PLACE, OR THAT NO NEW FORCES ARE 
BEING SENT SOUTH.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  A/S KELLY CONVOKED IRAQI AMBASSADOR 
AL-MASHAT FOR A MEETING AT 1430 EDT, 8/3/90, PRIMARILY TO 
PUT IRAQ ON NOTICE THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY OF 
AMERICANS.  KELLY ALSO CALLED AGAIN FOR IRAQI WITHDRAWAL 
AND RESTORATION OF LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT. 
AL-MASHAT DENIED THAT IRAQ WAS BUILDING UP TROOPS FOR USE 
AGAINST SAUDI ARABIA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
AMERICAN CITIZENS HELD BY IRAQ 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  KELLY SAID THE UNITED STATES REMAINS CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE SAFETY OF AMERICANS IN KUWAIT, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT 
OF REPORTS THAT TROOPS HAD TAKEN INTO CUSTODY A NUMBER OF 
AMERICAN OIL FIELD EMPLOYEES.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT WE WERE 
NOT ACCUSING IRAQI TROOPS OF WRONGDOING, BUT IRAQ MUST DO 
TWO THINGS: INFORM US OF THE WELFARE AND WHEREABOUTS OF 
ALL AMERICANS, AND RELEASE ALL DETAINED AMERICANS AT 
ONCE.  THIS IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT CONCERN TO THE PRESIDENT. 
 
4.  AL-MASHAT REPLIED THAT IRAQ WAS VERY CONCERNED FOR THE 
SAFETY OF BOTH AMERICANS AND KUWAITIS.  HE NOTED THAT 
IRAQI MFA UNDER SECRETARY HAMDUN HAD ASSURED HIM THERE WAS 
NO POLICY OF ARRESTING AMERICANS, AND THAT IRAQI FORCES 
WERE LOOKING FOR THE AMERICANS REPORTED MISSING. 
 
5.  WHILE AMERICANS HAVE NOT BEEN ARRESTED, HE SAID, 
SEVERAL HAD BEEN FOUND \"IN HOTELS AND OTHER PLACES.\"  FOUR 
ARE BEING TRANSPORTED TO BAGHDAD AT THIS TIME.  AL-MASHAT 
NOTED THAT ONE OF THE MEN ON THE LIST OF DETAINED 
AMERICANS PASSED TO THE IRAQI MFA BY CHARGE WILSON HAD 
BEEN FOUND TO BE A BRITISH CITIZEN.  HE ASKED THAT NEWS OF 
THE FOUR AMERICANS EN ROUTE TO BAGHDAD BE CONVEYED TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
 
---------------- 
IRAQI WITHDRAWAL 
---------------- 
 
6.  KELLY INFORMED AL-MASHAT THAT THE UNITED STATES 
ENTIRELY SUPPORTS THE GCC STATEMENT CALLING FOR IRAQI 
WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAIT.  FURTHERMORE, THE UNITED STATES, 
ALONG WITH THE UNSC, CALLS ON IRAQ TO WITHDRAW ITS FORCES 
FROM KUWAIT IMMEDIATELY. 
 
7.  AL-MASHAT SAID IT IS IRAQ\'S POLICY TO WITHDRAW WITHIN 
A MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS, AS STATED IN PREVIOUS IRAQI 
STATEMENTS IN WASHINGTON AND BAGHDAD.  HE NOTED THAT ARAB 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY KING HUSSEIN AND OTHERS WERE MAKING 
PROGRESS. 
 
----------------------------- 
LEGITIMATE KUWAITI GOVERNMENT 
----------------------------- 
 
8.  KELLY STRESSED THAT THE UNITED STATES WANTS 
RESTORATION OF THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF KUWAIT. 
AL-MASHAT SAID HE WOULD PASS THAT WISH TO BAGHDAD. 
 
----------------------- 
IRAQI MILITARY BUILD-UP 
----------------------- 
 
9.  KELLY INFORMED AL-MASHAT THAT WE HAVE OBSERVED A 
CONTINUING BUILD-UP OF IRAQI ARMED FORCES IN AN AREA OF 
CONCERN TO US.  AL-MASHAT REPLIED THAT HE IS UNAWARE OF 
ANY BUILD-UP, AND ASKED WHERE IT IS TAKING PLACE.  KELLY 
REPEATED THAT THE BUILD-UP IS IN AN AREA OF CONCERN TO 
US.  HE REMINDED AL-MASHAT THAT HE (AL-MASHAT) HAD BEEN 
UNAWARE OF IRAQ\'S INVASION PLANS, SO HE MIGHT BE SIMILARLY 
UNINFORMED OF THE PRESENT BUILD-UP.  AL-MASHAT 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD NOT KNOWN ABOUT \"ENTERING 
KUWAIT.\"  MR. KELLY CONCLUDED THE MEETING BY REPEATING THE 
UNITED STATES POSITION THAT IRAQI FORCES SHOULD WITHDRAW 
FROM KUWAIT AT ONCE. 
 
10.  IN THE CORRIDOR AFTER THE MEETING  AL-MASHAT RAISED 
KELLY\'S STATEMENT ABOUT AN ONGOING IRAQI MILITARY BUILD-UP 
WITH DAS MACK.  AL-MASHAT STATED THAT IF KELLY HAD MEANT A 
BUILD-UP DIRECTED AT SAUDI ARABIA, HE COULD STATE THAT 
THERE IS \"NOT ONE IOTA OF TRUTH\" IN THE REPORT.

--------------------------------------------- --------- 
LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM THREATENS THE MIDDLE EAST 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
ON MAY 30 1990, TERRORISTS FROM THE PALESTINE LIBERATION 
FRONT (PLF), A GROUP LED BY ABU ABBAS AND SUPPORTED BY 
LIBYA, UNDERTOOK A TERRORIST OPERATION IN ISRAEL.  THE 
ATTACK, HAD IT SUCCEEDED, WOULD HAVE KILLED 
CIVILIANS--PERHAPS INCLUDING AMERICANS--ON TEL AVIV\'S 
PUBLIC BEACHES.  THE CAPTURED TERRORISTS HAVE STATED 
PUBLICLY THAT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WERE AMONG THEIR 
OBJECTIVES.  THE PLF CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY SHORTLY 
AFTER THE ATTACK IN A STATEMENT TO THE PRESS IN 
BAGHDAD.  LIBYA WORKED WITH PLF LEADER ABU ABBAS--THE 
SELF PROCLAIMED \"MASTERMIND\" OF THE 1985 HIJACKING OF 
THE CRUISE SHIP ACHILLE LAURO IN WHICH AN AMERICAN WAS 
BRUTALLY KILLED--AND PROVIDED EXTENSIVE SUPPORT 
ESSENTIAL TO THE PLF OPERATION. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
LIBYA\'S SUPPORT CRUCIAL TO THE PLF OPERATION 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
LIBYA PROVIDED DIRECT SUPPORT IN ALL PHASES OF 
PREPARATION FOR THE PLF ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL FROM 
PLANNING THE ATTACK TO ACCOMPANYING THE SHIP FROM WHICH 
IT WAS LAUNCHED.  THE FULL EXTENT OF LIBYAN COMPLICITY 
BECAME CLEAR AS INFORMATION GATHERED BOTH BEFORE AND 
AFTER THE ATTACK FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WAS PIECED 
TOGETHER.  PLF MEMBERS BEGAN PREPARING FOR A SEABORNE 
OPERATION AT LEAST AS EARLY AS OCTOBER 1988.  FROM LATE 
1988 UNTIL THE OPERATION WAS LAUNCHED  TRAINING AND 
PREPARATIONS TOOK PLACE IN LIBYA AT SEVERAL 
LOCATIONS--INCLUDING A LIBYAN NAVAL BASE.  LIBYAN NAVAL 
PERSONNEL WERE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE TRAINING AND 
OVERALL SUPERVISION FOR THE OPERATION. 
 
ASSAULT BOATS PURCHASED AND MODIFIED.  LIBYA 
MANUFACTURES ASSAULT BOATS OF THE TYPE USED IN THE PLF 
ATTACK AT ITS BENGHAZI SHIPYARD.  SEVERAL OF THESE 
BOATS  WHICH ARE ABOUT 27 FEET LONG AND HAVE A TOP SPEED 
OF 35 KNOTS, WERE MODIFIED IN LIBYA TO CARRY AND FIRE A 
HEAVY MACHINE GUN AND A MULTIPLE ROCKET LAUNCHER.  THIS 
TYPE OF ASSAULT BOAT WAS AVAILABLE AT SEVERAL SITES USED 
BY THE PLF.  TWO OF THESE BOATS WERE CAPTURED DURING THE 
PLF ATTACK. 
 
TINY STAR ACQUIRED.  STAR NAVIGATION COMPANY OF PIRAEUS, 
GREECE, PURCHASED A MERCHANT SHIP WHICH IT NAMED THE 
TINY STAR IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR.  THE SHIP  EARLIER 
CALLED THE INGER M, SAILED FROM CYPRUS ON APRIL 10 
DECLARING ITS DESTINATION TO BE TRIFOLI, LIBYA.  THE 
TINY STAR WAS THE MOTHERSHIP THAT CARRIED THE ASSAULT 
BOATS AND PLF TERRORISTS TO THE LAUNCH SITE. 
 
------------------------------------- 
RETRACING THE COURSE OF THE TINY STAR 
------------------------------------- 
 
TINY STAR\'S UNUSUAL MOVEMENTS IN LIBYAN WATERS BETWEEN 
LATE APRIL AND MID-JUNE COINCIDED WITH ACTIVITIES OF THE 
PLF BOTH IN PREPARING FOR THE MAY 30 ATTACK AND IN 
DEMOBILIZING FOLLOWING THE FAILED OPERATION.  TINY STAR 
WAS FIRST NOTED IN EARLY MAY IN TRIPOLI HARBOR.  SHE 
NEXT MOVED TO A LIBYAN NAVAL BASE LOCATED EAST OF 
TRIPOLI WHERE, ON MAY 24, SHE ENGAGED IN CARGO 
OPERATIONS WHICH INCLUDED LOADING THE SIX ASSAULT BOATS 
USED IN THE RAID.  THE SHIP SAILED FROM THE LIBYAN NAVAL 
BASE TO RAS EL-HILAL TO PICK UP THE PLF MEMBERS WHO WERE 
TO MAKE THE ATTACK.  AT RAS EL-HILAL ON MAY 27, AT LEAST 
SIXTEEN TERRORISTS WERE LOADED ABOARD TINY STAR, WHICH 
THEN DEPARTED LIBYA FOR THE DROP-OFF POINT WEST OF 
ISRAEL. 
 
AFTER LAUNCHING THE ASSAULT BOATS, THE TINY STAR 
PROBABLY TRAVELLED WEST-SOUTHWEST TO BLEND IN WITH THE 
HUNDREDS OF MERCHANT SHIPS ENROUTE TO AND FROM THE SUEZ 
CANAL.  THE SHIP WAS DOCKED IN MID-JUNE AT THE LIBYAN 
PORT OF TOBRUK.  TINY STAR RETURNED TO TRIPOLI HARBOR IN 
LATE JUNE.  IN LATE JULY, THE SHIP SAILED FROM TRIPOLI 
TO PIRAEUS  GREECE. 
 
--------------------------- 
IMPACT ON THE PEACE PROCESS 
--------------------------- 
 
THE ABORTIVE MAY 30 PLF ATTACK ON ISRAEL IS EXTREMELY 
DISTURBING: 
 
--  IT LED TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE US-PLO DIALOGUE. 
ABU ABBAS, LEADER OF THE PLF, IS A MEMBER OF THE PLO 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  PLO CHAIRMAN ARAFAT DID NOT 
CONDEMN THIS ACTION

UNQUOTE.  THE TEXT OF THAT PAPER BEGINS WITH PARAGRAPH 
THREE. 

3.  TITLE:  LIBYA\'S CONTINUING RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
TERRORISM 

BEGIN TEXT.  INTRODUCTION 

THIS WHITE PAPER IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE US AND SCOTTISH INDICTMENTS OF LIBYAN 

NATIONALS FOR THE BOMBING OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 IN 
DECEMBER 1988.  TO THIS END, THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE 
ATTITUDE OF THE QADHAFI GOVERNMENT TOWARD TERRORISM AND 
OUTLINES LIBYAN OFFICIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TERRORIST 
ACTS. 

BASED ON ANALYSIS OF LIBYAN BEHAVIOR OVER MANY YEARS, ON 
THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATING THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 
SINCE 1988, AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE LIBYAN REGIME 
AND THE RELATIONS AMONG LEADING OFFICIALS IN THAT 
REGIME, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 WAS 
NOT AN ABERRATION AND WAS AN ACTION AUTHORIZED BY THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  LIBYA\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM BEGAN 
IN THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE QADHAFI REGIME.  AS EARLY AS 
1972, LIBYAN LEADER MU\'AMMAR QADHAFI PUBLICLY OFFERED TO 
HELP EXTREMIST MOVEMENTS -- INCLUDING THE PROVISIONAL 
IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY AND THE BLACK POWER MOVEMENT IN 
THE UNITED STATES -- AND TO SUPPORT ANY GROUP IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST WILLING TO ATTACK ISRAEL.  QADHAFI 
DISPATCHED TERRORISTS TO ITALY IN 1973 TO SHOOT DOWN AN 
ISRAELI AIRLINER, AND AT LEAST AS EARLY AS 1975 ORDERED 
THE MURDER OF LIBYAN DISSIDENTS LIVING ABROAD.  ALTHOUGH 
DISSIDENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE POSED LITTLE -- IF ANY -- 
THREAT TO QADHAFI\'S RULE, THE LIBYAN LEADER HAS 
CONCENTRATED ON ELIMINATING THEM.  ASSASSINATIONS TOOK 
PLACE IN THE EARLY AND MID-1980S AND INCLUDED TWO 
ATTEMPTS (ONE OF THEM SUCCESSFUL) AGAINST LIBYAN 
STUDENTS IN THE U.S. 

LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN AND SUPPORT OF TERRORISM EXPANDED 
THROUGHOUT THE EARLY 1980S.  TRIPOLI PROVIDED PASSPORTS 
TO ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION MEMBERS WHO ATTACKED THE EL AL 
TICKET COUNTER AT THE VIENNA AIRPORT IN DECEMBER, 1985. 
LIBYA ALSO SPONSORED THE BOMBING OF THE LA BELLE DISCO 
IN BERLIN IN APRIL 1986 THAT KILLED THREE PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING TWO US SERVICEMEN. 

OVER THE YEARS  EVEN AS LIBYAN AGENTS AND THEIR PROXIES 
PLANNED AND CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ATTACKS, QADHAFI 
REGULARLY SOUGHT TO CALM INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS THROUGH 
PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS OF TERRORISM.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1977 
QADHAFI PLOTTED TO ASSASSINATE A US AMBASSADOR, JUST 
AFTER ASSURING PRESIDENT CARTER THAT HE SOUGHT GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  MOVEOVER, QADHAFI 
PERIODICALLY HAS ISSUED PUBLIC DENIALS OF HIS 
INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM WHILE HIS INTELLIGENCE 
APPARATUS WAS PREPARING FOR ACTS OF TERRORISM.  LIBYAN 
ACTION HAS NOT BEEN LIMITED TO ISRAELI AND WESTERN 
TARGETS.  IN THE MID-1980\'S LIBYA BACKED PLOTS AGAINST 

PRESIDENT MUBARAK OF EGYPT, FORMER PRESIDENT NIMEIRI OF 
SUDAN, PRESIDENT MOBUTU OF ZAIRE\' FORMER TUNISIAN 
PRESIDENT BOURGUIBA, AND FORMER PRESIDENT HABRE OF 
CHAD.  IN ADDITION TO USING AND SUPPORTING TERRORISM, 
QADHAFI ALSO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF TRYING TO SUBVERT 
GOVERNMENTS IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. 

 
THE RECORD OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS 
----------------------------------- 

THE 1986 AIRSTRIKE ON LIBYA BY THE UNITED STATES, 
COMBINED WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES, DID NOT END 
TRIPOLI\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM.  FOLLOWING THE AIR 
ATTACK, QADHAFI BEGAN TO USE FRONT COMPANIES AND OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS TO HIDE LIBYA\'S HAND.  IN ADDITION, 
QADHAFI HAS PLACED A PREMIUM ON MASKING LIBYA\'S SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID JEOPARDIZING 
LIBYA\'S ECONOMIC LINKS TO HIS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS AND 
MAJOR EUROPEAN TRADING PARTNERS. 

THE LIBYANS SPONSORED A SERIES OF ANTI-US OPERATIONS 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE US AIRSTRIKES IN APRIL, 1986. 
TRIPOLI WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHOOTING OF A US EMBASSY 
COMMUNICATOR IN SUDAN ON 15 APRIL 1986 AND FOR THE 
SHOOTING OF ANOTHER EMBASSY COMMUNICATOR IN SANAA, NORTH 
YEMEN, ON 25 APRIL 1986.  IN ADDITION, TWO LIBYANS WERE 
APPREHENDED ON 18 APRIL 1986 AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO ATTACK 
THE US OFFICERS CLUB IN ANKARA WITH GRENADES OBTAINED 
FROM THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU THERE.  THE LIBYANS 
CONFESSED THAT THEY WERE ORDERED TO CAUSE THE MAXIMUM 
NUMBER OF CASUALITIES, PARTICULARLY WOMEN AND CHILDREN. 

WE BELIEVE THAT LIBYA WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
DESTRUCTION OF PAN AM FLIGHT 103 OVER LOCKERBIE. 
SCOTLAND, ON 21 DECEMBER 1988, AND THAT SENIOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN PREVIOUS TERRORIST 
ATTACKS AROUND THE WORLD ORCHESTRATED THE OPERATION. 
FORENSIC EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE BOMB\'S TIMER WAS 
UNIQUE TO LIBYAN INVENTORIES, AND AN OFFICIAL OF THE 
LIBYAN NATIONAL CARRIER, LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES, USED HIS 
CREDENTIALS TO CIRCUMVENT SECURITY PROCEDURES IN MALTA 
TO ASSIST IN THE OPERATION. 

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, LIBYA HAS PROVIDED 
ASSISTANCE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS, ENABLING THEM TO 
LAUNCH ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL AND WESTERN TARGETS: 

-- IN MAY 1990, PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT MEMBERS 
ATTEMPTED A SEABORNE RAID ON ISRAEL; THE OPERATION 
FAILED, AND FOUR TERRORISTS WERE KILLED AND 12 
CAPTURED.  LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH TRAINING, 
SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT, WEAPONRY, AND THE MOTHERSHIP 
USED IN THE OPERATION. 

-IN JULY 1988, ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) OPERATIVES 
ATTACKED THE GREEK CRUISE SHIP THE CITY OF POROS, 
KILLING NINE AND WOUNDING OVER 100 PEOPLE.  LIBYA 
PROVIDED THE WEAPONS USED IN THIS OPERATION. 

LIBYA HAS REGARDED AFRICA AS AN ATTRACTIVE ENVIRONMENT 
FOR ITS OPERATIONS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL 
ATTACKS THERE: 

--ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH JUDGE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS, CHARGING FOUR LIBYAN 
OFFICIALS WITH INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT 
772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989. 

--IN MARCH 1990, LIBYAN DIPLOMATS WERE EXPELLED FROM 
ETHIOPIA AFTER A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE HILTON HOTEL IN 
ADDIS ABABA, IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO KILL THE ISRAELI 
AMBASSADOR WHO WAS STAYING THERE. 

--IN FEBRUARY 1988, TWO KNOWN LIBYAN TERRORISTS WERE 
ARRESTED IN DAKAR, SENEGAL, IN POSSESSION OF EXPLOSIVES 
AND WEAPONS. 

--IN OCTOBER 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED IN THE OFFICE OF 
WORLD VISION, A PRIVATE RELIEF ORGANIZATION OPERATING IN 
MOUDOU, CHAD.  LIBYAN DIPLOMATS BASED IN COTONOU, BENIN, 
ASSISTED THE TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK. 

--IN MARCH 1987, A BOMB EXPLODED AT THE CAFE 
\"L\'HISTORIL\" IN DJIBOUTI, KILLING 11 AND WOUNDING 50. 
THE LIBYANS ORDERED A PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR 
STRUGGLE FRONT, TO CONDUCT THE ATTACK OR RISK LOSING 
TRIPOLI\'S FINANCIAL SUPPORT. 

THE LIBYANS HAVE SUPPORTED TERRORIST GROUPS IN EUROPE, 
PARTICULARLY THE PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY 
(PIRA), WHICH COLONEL QADHAFI HAS CALLED A \"POPULAR\" 
NATIONAL LIBERATION MOVEMENT.  THROUGHOUT THE MID-1980S 
LIBYA PROVIDED THE GROUP WITH ARMS.  LIBYA\'S HAND WAS 
OPENLY REVEALED IN OCTOBER 1987, WHEN FRENCH AUTHORITIES 
INTERCEPTED A FREIGHTER, THE EKSUND, OFF THE COAST OF 
FRANCE AND SEIZED 150 TONS OF WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES 
DESTINED FOR THE PIRA.  LIBYA HAS ALSO PROVIDED 
FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE PIRA. 

SINCE APRIL 1986, LIBYAN ASSASSINS HAVE MURDERED THREE 
ANTI-QADHAFI LIBYAN DISSIDENTS RESIDING IN GREECE, 
ITALY, AND FRANCE.  TRIPOLI HAS CONTINUED TO TARGET 
OTHER EXILES DEEMED \"OPPONENTS\" OF THE LIBYAN 
GOVERNMENT. 

 
CURRENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
----------------------------- 

DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, 
LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM TODAY REMAINS 
EXTENSIVE.  TRIPOLI IS ONE OF THE LARGEST FINANCIERS OF 
TERRORISTS WORLDWIDE, AND IT CONTINUES TO PERMIT 
TERRORIST GROUPS TO OPERATE AT CAMPS THROUGHOUT LIBYA. 

IN THE MIDDLE EAST THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A 
WIDE RANGE OF TERRORIST GROUPS: 

--THE ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) -- WHICH HAS 
CONDUCTED OVER 100 TERRORIST ATTACKS RESULTING IN THE 
DEATHS OF MORE THAN 280 PEOPLE AND THE WOUNDING OF OVER 
650 SINCE ITS FOUNDING -- CONTINUES TO RECEIVE 
SIGNIFICANT LIBYAN SUPPORT.  THE GROUP IS HEADQUARTERED 
IN TRIPOLI, AND LIBYA PROVIDES THE ANO WITH MAJOR 
TRAINING FACILITIES AND SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. 

--QADHAFI PROVIDED WELL OVER 1 MILLION DOLLARS TO AHMED 
JABRIL\'S POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF 
PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND IN 1990.  THE GROUP WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS OF TWO US MILITARY TRAINS 
IN GERMANY IN 1987 AND 1988. 

--ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT (PLF) 
REMAIN BASED IN LIBYA AND RECEIVE FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC 
SUPPORT FROM THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT.  THE GROUP HAS A 
LONG HISTORY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS, INCLUDING THE 
HIJACKING OF THE CRUISE SHIP ACHILLE LAURO IN OCTOBER 
1985, WHICH RESULTED IN THE MURDER OF A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND 
AMERICAN TOURIST ON BOARD, AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED 
ATTACK ON A TEL AVIV BEACH. 

--LIBYA ALSO FUNDS SA\'IQA AND ELEMENTS OF THE PALESTINE 
ISLAMIC JIHAD. 

LIBYAN SUPPORT FOR NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS HAS BECOME 
INCREASINGLY SELECTIVE.  THE MAIN CRITERION APPEARS TO 
BE THE DEGREE TO WHICH A GROUP DEMONSTRATES A CAPABILITY 
AND WILLINGNESS TO ATTACK LIBYA\'S ENEMIES WORLDWIDE, 
INCLUDING US AND OTHER WESTERN TARGETS. 

IN EUROPE, LIBYA MAINTAINS TIES TO THE PROVISIONAL IRISH 
REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) DESPITE QADHAFI\'S CLAIM EARLIER 
THIS YEAR TO HAVE ENDED SUPPORT FOR THE GROUP.  THE 
LIBYANS HAVE CONTACT WITH THE KURDISH SEPARATIST GROUP, 
THE PKK, WHICH HAS CONDUCTED NUMEROUS TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST TURKISH TARGETS. 

A PRINCIPAL RECIPIENT OF LIBYAN FINANCING IN ASIA IS THE 
COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE PHILIPPINES (CPP) AND ITS 
MILITARY WING, THE NEW PEOPLE\'S ARMY (NPA)  WHICH HAS 
KILLED 10 AMERICANS SINCE 1987.  THE LIBYANS HAVE 
PROVIDED AT LEAST 7 MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CPP/NPA SINCE 
1987. 

IN LATIN AMERICA, THE LIBYANS CONTINUE TO SEARCH OUT 
GROUPS WILLING TO KILL AMERICANS.  FOR EXAMPLE, LAST 
YEAR TRIPOLI PAID THE HAITIAN LIBERATION ORGANIZATION 
OVER 20,000 DOLLARS TO CARRY OUT AN ATTACK AGAINST THE 
US EMBASSY IN PORT-AU-PRINCE; THE GROUP, HOWEVER FAILED 
TO ACCOMPLISH ITS MISSION.  LIBYA HAS UNSUCCESSFULLY 
TRIED TO RECRUIT THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION 
FRONT IN EL SALVADOR TO CONDUCT ANTI-WESTERN ATTACKS IN 
RETURN FOR MONEY. 

THE LIBYANS ALSO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH OTHER TERRORIST 
GROUPS IN THE REGION, INCLUDING THE COSTA RICAN JUAN 
SANTA MARIA PATRIOTIC ORGANIZATION, TUPAC AMARU 
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT IN PERU, AND THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ 
PATRIOTIC FRONT IN CHILE. 

THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM CENTER (AIC) -- ALSO KNOWN AS 
MATHABA -- IS USED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT 
TERRORIST NETWORKS AND THUS PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN 
QADHAFI\'S TERRORISM STRATEGY.  ESTABLISHED IN 1982 TO 
SUPPORT \"LIBERATION AND REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS,\" THE AIC 
HAS SPONSORED A NUMBER OF STRIDENTLY ANTI-WESTERN 
CONFERENCES IN TRIPOLI.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE AIC\'S 
MISSION IS TO IDENTIFY AND RECRUIT REVOLUTIONARIES FOR 
IDEOLOGICAL AND MILITARY TRAINING IN LIBYA.  DURING 
THEIR TRAINING AT AIC CAMPS, INDIVIDUALS ARE SELECTED 
FOR ADVANCED TRAINING, INCLUDING WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES, 
AND INDOCTRINATION. 

THE AIC IS HEADED BY MUSA KUSA, A QADHAFI CONFIDANT WHO 
IS ALSO LIBYA\'S DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER.  WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES IN MANY LIBYAN EMBASSIES WORLDWIDE, THE 
AIC RUNS ITS OWN INDEPENDENT CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS AND 
DISBURSES PAYMENTS TO TERRORIST, INSURGENT, AND 
SUBVERSIVE GROUPS. 

 
TRAINING 
-------- 

COLONEL QADHAFI CONTINUES TO TRAIN MIDDLE EASTERN, 
AFRICAN, ASIAN, AND LATIN AMERICAN TERRORIST AND 
DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS AT CAMPS IN LIBYA, INCLUDING 
TRIPOLI.  THE LARGEST TRAINING CAMPS INCLUDE: 

--AL QALAH.  ABOUT 100 KILOMETERS SOUTHWEST OF TRIPOLI, 
IT IS THE PRINCIPAL ANO FACILITY IN LIBYA.  OVER THE 
PAST YEAR THE ANO HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE SIZE OF 
THE CAMP. 

--SEVEN APRIL TRAINING CAMP.  LOCATED ABOUT NINE 
KILOMETERS FROM TRIPOLI  THE FACILITY PROVIDES TRAINING 
IN TERRORISM AND SUBVERSION TO AFRICANS AND LATIN 
AMERICANS, AS WELL AS TO LIBYAN MILITARY PERSONNEL. 

--SIDI BILAL PORT FACILITY.  TERRORISTS WHO CARRIED OUT 
THE MAY 1990 SEABORNE ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL WERE TRAINED 
HERE. 

-BIN GHASHIR.  JUST SOUTH OF TRIPOLI, IT HAS BEEN USED 
TO TRAIN DISSIDENTS FROM AFRICA, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA 
IN TERRORIST/GUERRILLA TACTICS. 

--RAS AL HILAL.  PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS HAVE 
TRAINED AT THIS FACILITY. 

 
OUTLOOK FOR INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM 
------------------------------------- 

TERRORISM IS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT OF LIBYAN FOREIGN 
POLICY.  LIBYA WILL USE TERRORISM TO FURTHER ITS AGENDA, 
PARTICULARLY WHEN COLONEL QADHAFI BELIEVES HE CAN 
PLAUSIBLY DENY INVOLVEMENT.  QADHAFI\'S USE AND SUPPORT 
OF TERRORISM AS AN INSTRUMENT OF POLICY BELIE EFFORTS TO 
PERSUADE THE WORLD THAT HE DOES NOT SPONSOR TERRORIST 
ACTS.  LIBYAN OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF 
TERRORISM REMAIN IN SENIOR GOVERNMENT POSITIONS.  LAST 
YEAR QADHAFI APPOINTED IBRAHIM BISHARI, THE HEAD OF THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE AND A KEY PLAYER IN LIBYAN 
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE 1980S. AS LIBYA\'S FOREIGN 
MINISTER. 

 
THE CASE OF UTA 772 
------------------- 

ON 30 OCTOBER 1991, A FRENCH MAGISTRATE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL ARREST WARRANTS AGAINST FOUR LIBYAN 
OFFICIALS FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE BOMBING OF UTA FLIGHT 
772 IN SEPTEMBER 1989.  THE FLIGHT, WHICH WAS BOUND FROM 
BRAZZAVILLE, CONGO TO PARIS VIA NDJAMENA, CHAD EXPLODED 
OVER THE DESERT IN SOUTHEASTERN NIGER, KILLING ALL 171 
PASSENGERS AND CREW MEMBERS.  SEVEN AMERICANS, INCLUDING 
THE WIFE OF THE US AMBASSADOR TO CHAD, WERE AMONG THE 
PASSENGERS.  IN ADDITION TO THE WARRANTS AGAINST 
ABADALLAH SANUSSI (A RELATIVE OF QADHAFI AND 
SECOND-IN-COMMAND OF LIBYA\'S INTELLIGENCE SERVICES), 
NAYLI IBRAHIM (ONE OF SANUSSI\'S SUBORDINATES), ABD 
AL-AZRAGH, AND ABBAS MUSBAH (A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
LIBYAN SERVICES IN BRAZZAVILLE), THE JUDGE ISSUED 
INTERNATIONAL LOOKOUT NOTICES AGAINST MUSA KUSA (HEAD OF 
THE AIC AND DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER) AND ABD AL-SALAM 
ZADMA.  ACCORDING TO THE CHARGES, AL-AZRAGH, FIRST 
SECRETARY AT THE LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAU IN BRAZZAVILLE, 
CONGO, RECRUITED THREE CONGOLESE TO PLANT A SUITCASE 
BOMB ON THE FLIGHT AND PROVIDED THEM WITH THE DEVICE. 
TWO OF THE THREE ARE NOW IN JAIL, ONE IN THE CONGO AND 
ONE IN ZAIRE. 

 
THE LIBYAN USE OF TERRORIST FRONTS 
---------------------------------- 

BECAUSE OF PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF THE ROLE OF LIBYAN 
PEOPLE\'S BUREAUS (LPBS) IN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM IN 
THE EARLY 1980S, LIBYA HAS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS 
SHIFTED SOME OF ITS TERRORIST SUPPORT OPERATIONS TO 
OTHER INSTITUTIONS.  THESE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE THE 
ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY, STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS AND 
FRIENDSHIP SOCIETIES, AND LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES.  BY 
USING MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS, LIBYA IS ABLE TO CONTINUE 
ITS ACTIVITIES EVEN IF ONE GROUP IS EXPOSED. 

FRONT COMPANIES PROVIDE LIBYAN OPERATIVES WITH COVER AND 
DECEPTION CAPABILITIES.  SOME OF THESE COMPANIES 
PROBABLY WERE ESTABLISHED AS LEGITIMATE CORPORATIONS, 
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN BLACKMAILED INTO COOPERATING WITH THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICES.  THE FRONT COMPANIES 
TYPICALLY ESTABLISH A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL NATIONALS 
TO ENHANCE THEIR COVER.  THE COMPANIES\' PARTNERS RARELY 
KNOW THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE 
OFFICERS OR LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN TAKING ORDERS FROM THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT. 

LIBYAN FRONT COMPANIES KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN TERRORIST OPERATIONS OVER THE 
PAST DECADE INCLUDE EXO-COMMERCE AND SARRA OR SARRAH. 
FOR EXAMPLE, UNDER THE GUISE OF A \"LEGITIMATE\" BUSINESS, 
THE BENIN-BASED SARRAH COMPANY INFILTRATED ARMS AND 
EXPLOSIVES INTO NEIGHBORING AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR 

TERRORIST ACTS IN THE LATE 1980S.  ANOTHER FRONT 
COMPANY, THE GREEK-BASED GERMA SHIPPING AND STEVEDORING 
COMPANY, OWNED THE TINY STAR, THE MOTHERSHIP USED IN THE 
30 MAY 1990 PLF ATTACK ON ISRAEL, LAUNCHED FROM A LIBYAN 
PORT. 
 
IN ADDITION, OTHER BUSINESSES ARE SURROGATES OF THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE.  NEUTRON INTERNATIONAL IS 
RUN BY MUSBAH WARFALLI, AN ARCHITECT OF LIBYAN ATTACKS 
AGAINST LIBYAN DISSIDENTS IN THE EARLY 1980S.  THE 
LIBYAN ARAB FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY, OR LAFICO, IS 
WHOLLY OWNED BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT AND IS SOMETIMES 
USED BY THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE FOR COVER 
PURPOSES.  THE GENERAL ARAB AFRICAN COMPANY IS A MAJOR 
TRADING COMPANY SERVING AS A FRONT FOR LIBYAN 
INTELLIGENCE THROUGHOUT SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. 

EVEN LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN NOT READILY IDENTIFIED WITH THE 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OR A FRONT COMPANY HAVE BEEN 
USED IN OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN JANUARY 1991, THE 
CHADIAN GOVERNMENT ARRESTED TWO LIBYAN AGENTS POSING AS 
BUSINESSMEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE 
EXPLOSIVES INTO NDJAMENA.  WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE 
THAT MANY OTHER LIBYAN BUSINESSMEN AND BUSINESSES 
WORLDWIDE ARE LINKED TO THE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. 

LIBYAN ARAB AIRLINES (LAA) IS THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED 
NATIONAL FLAG CARRIER, PROVIDING SCHEDULED PASSENGER AND 
CARGO SERVICE TO EUROPE, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST. 
ALTHOUGH IT CONDUCTS LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES, LAA HAS BEEN 
USED TO TRANSPORT ARMS, EXPLOSIVES, AND TERRORISTS. 
AMONG THE LIBYANS IMPLICATED IN SUPPLYING ARMS TO THE 
PIRA FROM 1985 TO 1987 WAS AN LAA EMPLOYEE.  AN LAA 
FLIGHT WAS USED IN THE AUGUST 1986 ESCAPE OF SIX 
TERRORISTS BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 3 AUGUST 
ATTACK ON THE BRITISH BASE AT AKROTIRI, CYPRUS.  THE SIX 
WERE DISGUISED AS AIRLINE CREW MEMBERS, AND THE CAPTAIN 
MADE FALSE STATEMENTS TO AIRPORT AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE 
CREW\'S SIZE TO DISGUISE THEIR PRESENCE.  THE AIRLINE 
REMAINS WELL POSITIONED TO ASSIST IN AN ATTACK, 
PARTICULARLY SINCE AT LEAST 30 PERCENT OF LAA EMPLOYEES 
POSTED ABROAD ARE LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS. 

THE ISLAMIC CALL SOCIETY (ICS), CREATED BY THE LIBYANS 
TO PROPAGATE ISLAM, IS USED FOR LEGITIMATE RELIGIOUS 
PURPOSES, BUT QADHAFI ALSO EXPLOITS THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
PHILANTHROPIC REPUTATION TO ADVANCE HIS TERRORIST 
AGENDA.  THE ICS OFFICE IN CURACAO ASSISTED SEPARATISTS 
WHO BOMBED A GOVERNMENT OFFICE IN CAYENNE, FRENCH 

GUYANA, IN JANUARY, 1987.  FOR MUCH OF THE 1980S TRIPOLI 
USED ITS CALL SOCIETY OFFICE IN CONTONOU, BENIN, TO 
RECRUIT AND FUND TERRORISTS IN THE REGION. 

THE LIBYANS ALSO USE TRAVEL AGENCIES AROUND THE WORLD TO 
FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF LOCAL TERRORISTS TO LIBYA FOR 
ADVANCED TRAINING.  THE AGENCY NORMALLY BOOKS 
DISSIDENTS/TERRORISTS FOR TRAVEL THROUGH THIRD COUNTRIES 
SO THEIR ULTIMATE DESTINATION -- LIBYAN TERRORIST 
TRAINING CAMPS -- GOES UNDETECTED. 

 
COMPARING QADHAFI\'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON TERRORISM WITH 
THE FACTS 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 

THE FICTION:  LIBYA DENOUNCES THE PROVISIONAL IRISH 
REPUBLICAN ARMY (PIRA) BOMBING IN ENNISKILLEN, NORTHERN 
IRELAND, IN WHICH 11 DIED AND 65 WERE INJURED.  JANA 10 
NOVEMBER 1987. 

THE FACT:  FRENCH AUTHORITIES INTERCEPTED A SHIP 
CARRYING 150 TONS OF ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES PROVIDED BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA AND DESTINED FOR PIRA IN IRELAND, 31 
OCTOBER 1987.  FOUR EARLIER SHIPMENTS SUCCESSFULLY 
ARRIVED AT THEIR DESTINATION. 

THE FICTION:  \"THE GREAT JAMAHIRIYAH DOES NOT PRACTICE 
TERRORISM, NOR DOES IT SUPPORT IT.\"  COLONEL QADHAFI, 11 
FEBRUARY 1988. 

THE FACT:  PAN AM 103 EXPLODED OVER SCOTLAND  KILLING 
259 PERSONS ON BOARD, AND 11 CITIZENS OF LOCKERBIE ON 
THE GROUND.  LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IS CERTAIN.  21 DECEMBER 
1988. 

THE FICTION:  LIBYA \"HAS AFFIRMED AND CONTINUES TO 
AFFIRM THAT IT DENOUNCES AND OPPOSES TERRORISM.\"  JANA, 
9 APRIL 1989. 

THE FACT:  LIBYAN AGENTS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF SENIOR 
OFFICIALS IN TRIPOLI, SABOTAGED UTA FLIGHT 772 WHICH 
EXPLODED OVER NIGER, KILLING ALL 171 PEOPLE ABOARD.  19 
SEPTEMBER 1989. 

THE FICTION:  REFERRING TO THE PLF RAID ON ISRAEL, LIBYA 
SAID THAT IT \"HAS NO CONNECTION AND NO RELATION WITH 
THAT OPERATION.\"  (JANA, 6 JUNE 1990) 

THE FACT:  LIBYA MATERIALLY ASSISTED THE 30 MAY 1990 
RAID BY THE PLF ON ISRAEL, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE 
LIBYAN COAST, BY PROVIDING THE OPERATIVES WITH EXTENSIVE 
TRAINING, MILITARY HARDWARE, AND NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT. 

THE FICTION:  QADHAFI TOLD THE EGYPTIAN PRESS IN JUNE 
1991 THAT \"ABU NIDAL IS NOT OPERATING AT ALL.  THE WORLD 
HASN\'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM FOR YEARS...ABU NIDAL IS 
NOT IN LIBYA.\" 

THE FACT:  THE ANO REMAINS HEADQUARTERED IN TRIPOLI, AND 
ABU NIDAL HIMSELF IS KNOWN TO MEET WITH COLONEL 
QADHAFI.  NOVEMBER 1991. 

 
HOW LIBYA FUNDS TERRORISTS 
-------------------------- 

THE LIBYANS USE A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS TO FINANCE 
TERRORIST GROUPS: 

--  TRIPOLI FREQUENTLY PASSES MONEY TO TERRORISTS WHO 
TRAIN IN COUNTRY.  VIRTUALLY ALL TERRORIST 
OPERATIVES WHO ARE TRAINED IN LIBYA RECEIVE, AT A 
MINIMUM, TRAVEL MONEY AND A SMALL STIPEND FOR 
PERSONAL EXPENSES. 

--  LIBYAN PEOPLE\'S BUREAUS AND THE ANTI-IMPERIALISM 
CENTERS ARE USED TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO TERRORISTS. 

--  RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS OFTEN RECEIVE LIBYAN 
FUNDING THROUGH BANK ACCOUNTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST. 

--  ON RARE OCCASIONS THE LIBYANS HAVE USED COURIERS TO 
DELIVER MONEY TO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS;  THE 
TRANSFER USUALLY OCCURS IN A THIRD COUNTRY. 

 
LIBYAN TRAINING CAMPS 
---------------------- 

LIBYA HAS TRAINED PALESTINIAN AND OTHER TERRORISTS IN 
COUNTRY SINCE THE EARLY 1970S.  IN ADDITION TO THE 
PRINCIPAL FACILITIES IN AND AROUND TRIPOLI, OVER THE 
PAST TWO DECADES THE LIBYANS HAVE OPERATED SMALLER 
TRAINING CAMPS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THEIR COUNTRY.  ON 
SOME OCCASIONS, TERRORISTS ARE TRAINED AT LIBYAN 
MILITARY BASES.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1988 MEMBERS OF THE 
RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUP, THE POPULAR STRUGGLE FRONT, 
TRAINED AT AN AIR FORCE BASE IN THE AOUZOU REGION. 
MEMBERS OF THE PFLP-GC ALSO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TRAINED IN 
LIBYAN MILITARY CAMPS. 

NON-PALESTINIAN GROUPS THAT HAVE RECEIVED TRAINING IN 
LIBYA IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDE THE ECUADORIAN ALFARO 
VIVE, CARAJO ORGANIZATION, COLOMBIA\'S M-19  THE HAITIAN 
LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, THE CHILEAN MANUEL RODRIGUEZ 
PATRIOTIC FRONT, THE ARMENIAN SECRET ARMY FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF ARMENIA, AND THE JAPANESE RED ARMY. 

TRAINEES FROM ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND AFRICA OFTEN GO 
TO LIBYA LEGALLY, USUALLY PRETENDING TO BE STUDENTS. 
SOMETIMES, THIRD WORLD NATIONALS TRAVEL TO LIBYA FOR 
WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE LEGITIMATE SCHOOLING, SUCH AS 
TECHNICAL OR RELIGIOUS TRAINING.  WHEN THEY ARRIVE, 
HOWEVER, THEY FIND THEMSELVES MET AT THE AIRPORT BY 
SOLDIERS, PLACED ON A TRUCK, AND TRANSPORTED TO A 
TERRORIST/DISSIDENT TRAINING CAMP.  THOSE STUDENTS 
HOSTILE TO LIBYAN OVERTURES ARE SUMMARILY DEPORTED AND 
BRANDED AS UNWORTHY STUDENTS. 

EXTREMISTS TRAVEL TO LIBYA USING OTHER METHODS AS WELL. 
FOR EXAMPLE, RADICALS FROM MAURITIUS TRAVELED TO TRIPOLI 
IN 1987 OSTENSIBLY TO ATTEND A YOUTH CONFERENCE. 
INSTEAD, THEY WENT TO A TERRORIST TRAINING CAMP. 

 
QADHAFI AND KIDNAPPING 
----------------------- 

THE HOLLOWNESS OF QADHAFI\'S RHETORIC IS BEST ILLUSTRATED 
BY LIBYA\'S LONGSTANDING INVOLVEMENT IN KIDNAPPING, 
DESPITE HIS REGULAR DENUNCIATIONS OF SUCH ACTS.  IN 1978 
LIBYAN INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS KIDNAPPED IMAM MUSA SADR, 
THE SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE LEBANESE SHIA COMMUNITY, 
JUST AFTER HE ARRIVED IN TRIPOLI.  MUSA SADR EVENTUALLY 
DIED IN LIBYAN CAPTIVITY.  THROUGHOUT THE 1980S QADHAFI 
PUBLICLY DENOUNCED THE ILLEGAL DETENTION OF HOSTAGES BY 
EXTREMIST GROUPS IN LEBANON.  YET IN APRIL 1986, LIBYA 
BOUGHT AND ARRANGED FOR THE MURDER OF THREE WESTERN 
HOSTAGES IN LEBANON, INCLUDING AMERICAN PETER KILBURN. 
MORE RECENTLY  IN NOVEMBER, 1987 THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO) HIJACKED THE YACHT SILCO IN 
INTERNATIONAL WATERS.  THE HOSTAGES--BELGIAN AND FRENCH 
NATIONALS--WERE RELEASED IN STAGES, WITH THE LAST 
DETAINEES FREED JANUARY 1991.  THE YACHT WAS SEIZED BY 
ANO ELEMENTS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LIBYAN 
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, AND SOME OF THE HOSTAGES WERE EVEN 
HELD ON LIBYAN SOIL.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

2.  BEGIN TEXT OF Q-AND-A. 

RECOGNITION POLICY 
------------------ 

Q:    HOW DO THE SIX REPUBLICS WITH WHICH THE PRESIDENT 
    DID NOT ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TO ESTABLISH 
    DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ATTAIN SUCH RELATIONS? 

A:    WE HAVE RECOGNIZED ALL TWELVE OF THE FORMER 
    REPUBLICS AS INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN STATES. 

    THE OVERALL PLAN ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT IS THAT 
    OUR EMBASSY IN MOSCOW WILL REMAIN THERE AS OUR 
    EMBASSY TO RUSSIA, AND OUR CONSULATE GENERAL IN KIEV 
    WILL BECOME OUR EMBASSY TO UKRAINE.  WE WILL MOVE 
    QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH 
    ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BYELARUS, AND KYRGYZSTAN. 
 
,    CONCERNING THE OTHER SIX REPUBLICS: 

    -,  WE WANT TO BE ASSURED OF THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE 
        PRINCIPLES ADVANCED BY SECRETARY BAKER.  WE WILL 
        ACTIVELY BE SEEKING THAT ASSURANCE. 

    --  THE MEASURES BY WHICH WE WILL BE DECIDING FUTURE 
        DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ARE THOSE YOU ARE FAMILIAR 
        WITH:  SECRETARY BAKER\'S FIVE PRINCIPLES AND THE 
        NEW STATES\' IMPLEMENTATION OF RESPONSIBLE 
        POLICIES ON KEY MILITARY AND SECURITY ISSUES 
        AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS. 

    --  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE HAD 
        OFFICIAL CONTACTS WITH ALL OF THESE 
        GOVERNMENTS.  THESE CONTACTS WILL CONTINUE. 

    --  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE ALL OF THE REPUBLICS 
        ON ISSUES OF MUTUAL CONCERN, INCLUDING 
        DISCUSSIONS OF THEIR PROGRESS IN IMFLEMENTING 
        DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORMS. 

    --  WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT FULL 
        DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WILL ALL OF THE REPUBLICS. 

Q:    WHEN WILL YOU BE OPENING EMBASSIES IN THE NEWLY 
    RECOGNIZED COUNTRIES? 

A:    OUR EMBASSY IN MOSCOW WILL FUNCTION AS OUR EMBASSY 
    TO RUSSIA, AND OUR CONSULATE GENERAL IN KIEV WILL 
    BECOME OUR EMBASSY TO UKRAINE. 

    WE HAVE HAD PLANS FOR SOME TIME TO ESTABLISH POSTS 
    IN ALMA-ATA, YEREVAN, AND MENSK.  WE INTEND TO HAVE 
    THESE EMBASSIES FUNCTIONING BEFORE THE END OF THIS 
    FISCAL YEAR, AND WE WILL OPEN A POST IN BISHKEK AS 

    SOON AS RESOURCES PERMIT.  WE WILL BE WORKING WITH 
    CONGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PLAN. 

Q:    WHAT STAGE ARE WE AT WITH REGARDS TO NOMINATING 
    AMBASSADORS/STAFFS? 

A:    WE ARE REVIEWING STAFFING QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE 
    OPENING OF THE NEW POSTS. 

Q:    WILL AMBASSADOR STRAUSS, FOR THE TIME BEING, 
    CONTINUE AS AMBASSADOR TO ALL THE NEW COUNTRIES OR 
    JUST RUSSIA? 

A:    AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WILL SERVE AS AMBASSADOR TO 
    RUSSIA. WE ARE WORKING TO NOMINATE AMBASSADORS TO 
    THE OTHER REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE ARE ESTABLISHING 
    FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  OUR CONSUL GENERAL IN 
    KIEV WILL SERVE AS CHARGE UNTIL AN AMBASSADOR TO 
    UKRAINE IS NAMED.  FOR THE OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR THE 
    TIME BEING, WE WILL RELY ON AMBASSADOR STRAUSS AND 
    HIS STAFF TO MAINTAIN CONTACTS WITH THESE 
    GOVERNMENTS UNTIL PERMANENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE DECIDED 
    UPON. 

Q:    WILL THE REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE DID NOT ESTABLISH 
    FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BE ABLE TO SEND DIPLOMATIC 
    REPRESENTATIVES TO THE U.S.? 

A:    YES.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE HAVE RECEIVED 
    MANY VISITS FROM OFFICIALS OF THESE GOVERNMENTS AND 
    HAVE CONDUCTED SUBSTANTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. 
    THIS WILL CONTINUE DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF FULL 
    DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 

    (IF ASKED)  A PERMANENT DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN THE 
    U.S. BY THESE STATES WILL REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF 
    BOTH SIDES. 

Q:    THROUGH WHAT CHANNEL WILL YOU DO BUSINESS WITH THE 
    REPUBLICS WITH WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE FULL DIPLOMATIC 
    RELATIONS? 

A:    DURING A TRANSTION PERIOD, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN 
    CONTACT WITH THESE GOVERNMENTS THROUGH AMBASSADOR 
    STRAUSS AND HIS STAFF. 

    WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE OFFICIAL VISITORS 
    IN WASHINGTON FROM THESE STATES. 

Q:    DOES THE US RECOGNIZE RUSSIA AS THE SUCCESSOR STATE 
    TO THE USSR? 

A:    RUSSIA AS WELL AS THE OTHER REFUBLICS WILL CONTINUE 
    THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. 
    THERE ARE MANY ISSUES THAT WE WILL WANT TO CLARIFY 
    WITH RUSSIA AND THE OTHER REPUBLICS. 

    IN ANY CASE, WE ARE PREPARED TO BUILD A CONSTRUCTIVE 
    AND CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA AND THE OTHER 
    REPUBLICS IN ALL AREAS. 

Q:    ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE ASSURANCES YOU HAVE 
    RECEIVED ON SECURITY MATTERS? 

A:    AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN HIS CHRISTMAS ANNOUNCEMENT, 
    WE CONGRATULATE THE NEW STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH 
    ON THE PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC PATH THEY HAVE 
    CHOSEN, AND FOR THEIR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO NUCLEAR 
    CONTROL AND SAFETY DURING THIS TRANSITION. 

    THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE 
    DECEMBER 26 THAT HE HAS RECEIVED PROPER ASSURANCES 
    FROM YELTSIN\' GORBACHEV, AND ALL THE REPUBLIC 
    LEADERS INVOLVED  AND SEES NO REASON TO BE ANYTHING 
    BUT SATISFIED ON THIS POINT. 

Q:    WILL THE US SUPPORT CSCE MEMBERSHIP FOR THE NEW 
    STATES? 

A:    WE BELIEVE IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE CSCE 
    STANDARDS BE ADOPTED AND ADHERED TO THROUGHOUT THE 
    ENTIRE AREA OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. 

    WE WILL BE WORKING WITH OUR CSCE PARTNERS TO ENSURE 
    THAT APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEVELOPED FOR THE 
    PARTICIPATION OF THESE NEW STATES WHO ARE PREPARED 
    TO CONDUCT THEIR AFFAIRS IN FULL CONFORMANCE WITH 
    CSCE NORMS AND PRINCIPLES. 

Q:    WILL THE LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON THE SOVIET 
    UNION APPLY TO THE NEW COUNTRIES?  TO RUSSIA? 
    (FYI:  THESE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE SUCH ISSUES AS 
    EXIM CREDIT TO SOVIET UNION, ACQUISITION OF NEW 
    FACILITIES, COMPENSATION FOR EMBASSY BUGGING, USE OF 

    CONSULATE BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK, ETC.) 

A:    WE WILL NEED TO REVIEW THESE PROVISIONS ON A 
    CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, CONSULT WITH 
    CONGRESS. 

Q:    THERE WERE MANY \"SECURITY RELATED\" RESTRICTIONS 
    APPLIED TO SOVIET DIPLOMATS (TRAVEL CONTROLS, LIMITS 
    ON NUMBER OF PERSONNEL, ETC.).  WILL RUSSIA AND THE 
    OTHER REPUBLICS BE SUBJECT TO THESE RESTRICTIONS? 

A:    WE ARE EXAMINING THESE ISSUES CLOSELY AND WILL 
    ADDRESS THEM AS WE DEVELOP BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH 
    RUSSIA AND THE OTHER REPUBLICS.  FOR NOW, THEY WILL 
    REMAIN IN EFFECT. 

MIDDLE EAST PEACE TALKS 
----------------------- 

Q:    WHO IS THE CO-SPONSOR OF THE MULTILATERAL MIDDLE 
    EAST PEACE TALKS NOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION NO LONGER 
    EXISTS? 

A:    THE CO-SPONSOR OF THE PEACE TALKS IS THE RUSSIAN 
    FEDERATION. 

Q:    WILL THE MULTILATERALS STILL BE HELD IN MOSCOW? 

A:    AS THE SECRETARY SAID DECEMBER 19, WE HAVE AN 
    AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE VENUE.  WE ANTICIPATE 
    THAT THOSE TALKS WILL TAKE PLACE THE 28TH AND 29TH 
    OF JANUARY IN MOSCOW. 

RUSSIA IN THE UNITED NATIONS 
---------------------------- 

Q:    WHEN WILL THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FORMALLY ASSUME THE 
    FORMER USSR\'S SEATS IN THE UN, INCLUDING ON THE 
    SECURITY COUNCIL? 

A:    PRESIDENT YELTSIN\'S LETTER INFORMING THE UN 
    SECRETARY GENERAL THAT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE USSR IN 
    THE UN WILL BE CONTINUED BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION 
    WAS TRANSMITTED TO THE UN SECRETARIAT ON DECEMBER 
    24.  YELTSIN\'S LETTER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED TO MEMBERS 
    OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AS 
    WELL AS TO OTHER ORGANS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF THE UN 

    SYSTEM.  AS STATED BY THE PRESIDENT THE U.S. 
    SUPPORTS RUSSIA\'S CONTINUATION IN THE FORMER USSR\'S 
    UN SEATS. 

    AS RUSSIA WILL OCCUPY THE SEATS OF THE FORMER USSR 
    AS A CONTINUATION OF THE USSR, IT IS OUR VIEW THAT 
    NO FURTHER UN ACTION IS NECESSARY FOR RUSSIA TO 
    OCCUPY THOSE SEATS.  CERTAIN PRACTICAL STEPS MAY BE 
    REQUIRED TO GIVE EFFECT WITH THESE DEVELOPMENTS IN 
    THE UN SYSTEM. 

Q:    CAN A CHALLENGE BE MADE TO RUSSIA\'S ASSUMPTION OF 
    THE USSR\'S UN SEAT? 

A:    THEORETICALLY, THERE COULD BE SUCH A CHALLENGE. 
    HOWEVER, SINCE CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP BY RUSSIA OF THE 
    USSR\'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE UN IS SUPPORTED BY THE 
    STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY 
    CHALLENGE. 

    (FYI:  GENERALLY, UNDER UN PRACTICE CHALLENGES TO 
    THE CREDENTIALS OF A STATE ARE RESOLVED BY THE 
    GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  WE NOTE THAT THE FORTY-SIXTH 
    SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY ADJOURNED DECEMBER 
    20.) 

Q:    WILL THE UNITED STATES SUPPORT ALL THE FORMER SOVIET 
    REPUBLICS FOR UN MEMBERSHIP? 

A:    THE PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE UNITED STATES 
    WILL SUPPORT UN MEMBERSHIP FOR ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN 
    AND KYRGYZSTAN.  BELARUS AND UKRAINE ARE ORIGINAL 
    MEMBERS OF THE UN.  WE LOOK FORWARD TO APPLICATIONS 
    FOR UN MEMBERSHIP BY THE OTHER REPUBLICS NOT 
    CURRENTLY MEMBERS, CONSISTENT WITH U.S. SUPPORT FOR 
    THE PRINCIPLE OF UNIVERSALITY OF UN MEMBERSHIP. 

Q:    HOW DOES A STATE BECOME A MEMBER OF THE UNITED 
    NATIONS? 

A:    ANY STATE THAT WISHES TO JOIN THE UNITED NATIONS 
    MUST MAKE AN APPLICATION TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, 
    WHO PASSES THE APPLICATION ON TO THE SECURITY 
    COUNCIL.  THE SECURITY COUNCIL IN TURN MUST DECIDE 
    WHETHER TO RECOMMEND THE STATE\'S MEMBERSHIP TO THE 
    GENERAL ASSEMBLY.  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST THEN 
    ACCEPT THE STATE FOR MEMBERSHIP BY A TWO-THIRDS 
    MAJORITY. 

    WE NOTE THAT IN ORDER TO BE ADMITTED TO THE UNITED 
    NATIONS AN APPLICANT MUST BE A STATE, BE 
    PEACE-LOVING, ACCEPT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE CHARTER, 
    BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE OBLIGATIONS, AND BE 
    WILLING TO DO SO. 

Q:    HOW QUICKLY CAN THE UN ACT ON AN APPLICATION FOR 
    MEMBERSHIP? 

A:    AFTER THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS RECOMMENDED A STATE 
    FOR MEMBERSHIP  THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY MUST TAKE 
    ACTION AT ITS NEXT SESSION. 

TREATIES WITH THE FORMER USSR 
----------------------------- 

Q:    WILL THE REPUBLICS ABIDE BY THE TREATIES THAT THE 
    SOVIET UNION HAD MADE WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER 
    COUNTRIES, AND WILL WE CONTINUE TO ABIDE BY THOSE 
    TREATIES NOW THAT THE SOVIET UNION NO LONGER EXISTS? 

A:    WE EXPECT THE REPUBLICS TO FULFILL THE TREATY 
    OBLIGATIONS OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION. 

    THE ALMA ATA DECLARATION SIGNED DECEMBER 21 CONTAINS 
    A SPECIFIC STATEMENT BY THE MEMBER STATES OF THE NEW 
    COMMONWEALTH GUARANTEEING \"FULFILLMENT OF 
    INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE TREATIES 
    AND AGREEMENTS OF THE FORMER USSR.\" 

    WE TOO WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR TREATY 
    OBLIGATIONS. 

    IN SOME CASES, IT WILL NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE EACH 
    REPUBLIC ASSUME THE OBLIGATIONS OF A TREATY OR 
    AGREEMENT.  THIS WOULD BE THE CASE, FOR EXAMPLE 
    WHERE APPLICATION OF A TREATY TO A PARTICULAR 
    REPUBLIC WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE TREATY\'S 
    \"OBJECT AND PURPOSE.\"  THUS, A TREATY OR AGREEMENT 
    RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO ACTIVITY IN ONLY ONE 
    REPUBLIC WOULD NOT BE APPLICABLE TO THE OTHER 
    ELEVEN.  WE WILL NEED TO WORK OUT DETAILS SUCH AS 
    THESE WITH THE NEW REPUBLICS. 

END TEXT OF Q-AND-A. 

3.  BEGIN TEXT OF DECEMBER 25 PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT. 

GOOD EVENING AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL AMERICANS ACROSS 
OUR GREAT COUNTRY.  DURING THESE LAST FEW MONTHS, YOU AND 
I HAVE WITNESSED ONE OF THE GREATEST DRAMAS OF THE 20TH 
CENTURY--THE HISTORIC AND REVOLUTIONARY TRANSFORMATION OF 
A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP, THE SOVET UNION, AND THE 
LIBERATION OF ITS PEOPLES.  AS WE CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS 
THIS DAY OF PEACE AND HOPE, I THOUGHT WE SHOULD TAKE JUST 
A FEW MINUTES TO REFLECT ON WHAT THESE EVENTS MEAN FOR US 
AS AMERICANS. 

FOR OVER 40 YEARS, THE UNITED STATES LED THE WEST IN THE 
STRUGGLE AGAINST COMMUNISM AND THE THREAT IT POSED TO OUR 
MOST PRECIOUS VALUES.  THIS STRUGGLE SHAPED THE LIVES OF 
ALL AMERICANS.  IT FORCED ALL NATIONS TO LIVE UNDER THE 
SPECTER OF NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION.  THAT CONFRONTATION IS NOW 
OVER.  THE NUCLEAR THREAT, WHILE FAR FROM GONE, IS 
RECEDING.  EASTERN EUROPE IS FREE.  THE SOVIET UNION 
ITSELF IS NO MORE. 

THIS IS A VICTORY FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.  IT\'S A 
VICTORY FOR THE MORAL FORCE OF OUR VALUES.  EVERY AMERICAN 
CAN TAKE PRIDE IN THIS VICTORY, FROM THE MILLIONS OF MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN UNIFORM TO 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO SUFPORTED THEIR COUNTRY AND A 
STRONG DEFENSE UNDER NINE PRESIDENTS. 

NEW, INDEPENDENT NATIONS HAVE EMERGED OUT OF THE WRECKAGE 
OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE.  LAST WEEKEND, THESE FORMER 
REPUBLICS FORMED A COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES. 

THIS ACT MARKS THE END OF THE OLD SOVIET UNION, SIGNIFIED 
TODAY BY MIKHAIL GORBACHEV\'S DECISION TO RESIGN AS 
PRESIDENT. 

I\'D LIKE TO EXPRESS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MY 
GRATITUDE TO MIKHAIL GORBACHEV FOR YEARS OF SUSTAINED 
COMMITMENT TO WORLD PEACE AND FOR HIS INTELLECT, VISION 
AND COURAGE.  I SPOKE WITH MIKHAIL GORBACHEV THIS 
MORNING.  WE REVIEWED THE MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE LAST 
FEW YEARS AND SPOKE OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE.  MIKHAIL 
GORBACHEV\'S REVOLUTIONARY POLICIES TRANSFORMED THE SOVIET 
UNION. 

HIS POLICIES PERMITTED THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA AND THE OTHER 
REPUBLICS TO CAST ASIDE DECADES OF OPPRESSION AND 
ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM.  HIS LEGACY 
GUARANTEES HIM AN HONORED PLACE IN HISTORY AND PROVIDES A 

SOLID BASIS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO WORK IN EQUALLY 
CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS WITH HIS SUCCESSORS. 

THE UNITED STATES APPLAUDS AND SUPPORTS THE HISTORIC 
CHOICE FOR FREEDOM BY THE NEW STATES OF THE COMMONWEALTH. 
WE CONGRATULATE THEM ON THE PEACEFUL AND DEMOCRATIC PATH 
THEY HAVE CHOSEN, AND FOR THEIR CAREFUL ATTENTION TO 
NUCLEAR CONTROL AND SAFETY DURING THIS TRANSITION. 

DESPITE A POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY AND CHAOS, THESE 
EVENTS CLEARLY SERVE OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. 

WE STAND TONIGHT BEFORE A NEW WORLD OF HOPE AND 
POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR CHILDREN, A WORLD WE COULD NOT HAVE 
CONTEMPLATED A FEW YEARS AGO. 

THE CHALLENGE FOR US NOW IS TO ENGAGE THESE NEW STATES IN 
SUSTAINING THE PEACE AND BUILDING A MORE PROSPEROUS FUTURE. 

AND SO TODAY, BASED ON COMMITMENTS AND ASSURANCES GIVEN TO 
US BY SOME OF THESE STATES CONCERNING NUCLEAR SAFETY, 
DEMOCRACY AND FREE MARKETS, I AM ANNOUNCING SOME IMPORTANT 
STEPS DESIGNED TO BEGIN THIS PROCESS. 

FIRST  THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES AND WELCOMES THE 
EMERGENCY OF A FREE, INDEPENDENT AND DEMOCRATIC RUSSIA LED 
BY ITS COURAGEOUS PRESIDENT  BORIS YELTSIN.  OUR EMBASSY 
IN MOSCOW WILL REMAIN THERE AS OUR EMBASSY TO RUSSIA.  WE 
WILL SUPPORT RUSSIA\'S ASSUMPTION OF THE USSR\'S SEAT AS A 
PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL. 

I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH PRESIDENT YELTSIN 
IN SUPPORT OF HIS EFFORTS TO BRING DEMOCRATIC AND MARKET 
REFORM TO RUSSIA. 

SECOND, THE UNITED STATES ALSO RECOGNIZES THE INDEPENDENCE 
OF UKRAINE, ARMENIA, KAZAKHSTAN, BYELARUS AND KYRGYZSTAN, 
ALL STATES THAT HAVE MADE SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO US.  WE 
WILL MOVE QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH 
THESE STATES AND BUILD NEW TIES TO THEM.  WE WILL SPONSOR 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE UNITED NATIONS FOR THOSE NOT ALREADY 
MEMBERS. 

THIRD  THE UNITED STATES ALSO RECOGNIZES TODAY AS 
INDEPENDENT STATES THE REMAINING SIX FORMER SOVIET 
REPUBLICS--MOLDOVA, TURKMENISTAN, AZERBAIJAN, TAJIKISTAN, 
GEORGIA AND UZBEKISTAN.  WE WILL ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS WITH THEM WHEN WE ARE SATISFIED THAT THEY HAVE 

MADE COMMITMENTS TO RESPONSIBLE SECURITY POLICIES AND 
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, AS HAVE THE OTHER STATES WE 
RECOGNIZED TODAY. 

THESE DRAMATIC EVENTS COME AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS ARE 
ALSO FACING CHALLENGES HERE AT HOME.  I KNOW THAT FOR MANY 
OF YOU THESE ARE DIFFICULT TIMES, AND I WANT ALL AMERICANS 
TO KNOW THAT I AM COMMITTED TO ATTACKING OUR ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS AT HOME WITH THE SAME DETERMINATION WE BROUGHT TO 
WINNING THE COLD WAR.  I AM CONFIDENT WE WILL MEET THIS 
CHALLENGE AS WE HAVE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE, BUT WE CANNOT 
IF WE RETREAT INTO ISOLATIONISM.  WE WILL ONLY SUCCEED IN 
THIS INTERCONNECTED WORLD BY CONTINUING TO LEAD THE FIGHT 
FOR FREE PEOPLE AND FREE AND FAIR TRADE.  A FREE AND 
PROSPEROUS GLOBAL ECONOMY IS ESSENTIAL FOR AMERICA\'S 
PROSPERITY.  THAT MEANS JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH RIGHT 
HERE AT HOME. 

THIS IS A DAY OF GREAT HOPE FOR ALL AMERICANS.  OUR 
ENEMIES HAE BECOME OUR PARTNERS, COMMITTED TO BUILDING 
DEMOCRATIC AND CIVIL SOCIETIES.  THEY ASK FOR OUR SUPPORT, 
AND WE WILL GIVE IT TO THEM.  WE WILL DO IT BECAUSE AS 
AMERICANS WE CAN DO NO LESS.  FOR OUR CHILDREN. WE MUST 
OFFER THEM THE GUARANTEE OF A PEACEFUL AND PROSPEROUS 
FUTURE  A FUTURE GROUNDED IN A WORLD BUILT ON STRONG 
DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, FREE FROM THE SPECTER OF GLOBAL 
CONFLICT. 

MAY GOD BLESS THE PEOPLE OF THE NEW NATIONS IN THE 
COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT STATES.  AND, ON THIS SPECIAL 
DAY OF PEACE ON EARTH, GOODWILL TOWARD MEN, MAY GOD 
CONTINUE TO BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  GOOD 
NIGHT.

4.  BEGIN TEXT OF PRESIDENT\'S FAREWELL STATEMENT TO 
GORBACHEV. 

MIKHAIL GORBACHEV\'S RESIGNATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE SOVIET 
UNION CULMINATES A REMARKABLE ERA IN THE HISTORY OF HIS 
COUNTRY AND IN ITS LONG AND OFTEN DIFFICULT RELATIONSHIP 
WITH THE UNITED STATES.  AS HE LEAVES OFFICE, I WOULD LIKE 
TO EXPRESS PUBLICLY, AND ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 
MY GRATITUDE TO HIM FOR YEARS OF SUSTAINED COMMITMENT TO 
WORLD PEACE, AND MY PERSONAL RESPECT FOR HIS INTELLECT, 
VISION AND COURAGE. 

PRESIDENT GORBACHEV IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS CENTURY--THE REVOLUTIONARY 
TRANSFORMATION OF A TOTALITARIAN DICTATORSHIP AND THE 
LIBERATION OF HIS PEOPLE FROM ITS SMOTHERING EMBRACE.  HIS 
PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRATIC AND ECONOMIC REFORM 
THROUGH PERESTROIKA AND GLASNOST--A COMMITMENT WHICH 
DEMANDED THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF POLITICAL AND PERSONAL 
INGENUITY AND COURAGE--PERMITTED THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA AND 
OTHER REPUBLICS TO CAST ASIDE DECADES OF DARK OPPRESSION 
AND PUT IN PLACE THE FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM. 

WORKING WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN, MYSELF AND OTHER ALLIED 
LEADERS, PRESIDENT GORBACHEV ACTED BOLDLY AND DECISIVELY 
TO END THE BITTER DIVISIONS OF THE COLD WAR AND 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE REMAKING OF A EUROPE WHOLE AND FREE. 
HIS AND FOREIGN MINISTER EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\'S \"NEW 
THINKING\" IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS PERMITTED THE UNITED STATES 
AND THE SOVIET UNION TO MOVE FROM CONFRONTATION TO 
PARTNERSHIP IN THE SEARCH FOR PEACE ACROSS THE GLOBE. 
TOGETHER WE NEGOTIATED HISTORIC REDUCTIONS IN CHEMICAL, 
NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL FORCES AND REDUCED THE RISK OF A 
NUCLEAR CONFLICT. 

WORKING TOGETHER, WE HELPED THE PEOPLE OF EASTERN EUROPE 
WIN THEIR LIBERTY AND THE GERMAN PEOPLE THEIR GOAL OF 
UNITY IN PEACE AND FREEDOM.  OUR PARTNERSHIP LED TO 
UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION IN REPELLING IRAQI AGGRESSION IN 
KUWAIT, IN BRINGING PEACE TO NICARAGUA AND CAMBODIA  AND 
INDEPENDENCE TO NAMIBIA.  AND OUR WORK CONTINUES AS WE 
SEEK A LASTING AND JUST PEACE BETWEEN ISRAELIS AND ARABS 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST  AND AN END TO THE CONFLICT IN 
AFGHANISTAN. 

PRESIDENT GORBACHEV\'S PARTICIPATION IN THESE HISTORIC 
EVENTS IS HIS LEGACY TO HIS COUNTRY AND TO THE WORLD. 
THIS RECORD ASSURES HIM AN HONORED PLACE IN HISTORY AND, 
MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FUTURE, ESTABLISHES A SOLID BASIS 
FROM WHICH THE UNITED STATES AND THE WEST CAN WORK IN 
EQUALLY CONSTRUCTIVE WAYS WITH HIS SUCCESSORS. 

END TEXT OF PRESIDENT\'S FAREWELL STATEMENT TO GORBACHEV.

UNCLASSIFIED DEPARTMENT WHITE PAPERS WHICH OFFER FURTHER 
INFORMATION ON LIBYAN COMPLICITY IN 1985 ROME AND VIENNA 
AIRPORT ATTACKS AND 1986 LABELLE BOMBING. 
 
3.  ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IMPLICATING LIBYA IN THE LABELLE 
BOMBING HAS EMERGED IN THE CONTEXT OF INVESTIGATIONS 
INTO STASI FILES IN FORMER EAST GERMANY.  THE 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE BOMBING IS AN ONGOING LEGAL 
CASE.  NO SUSPECTS ARE CURRENTLY IN CUSTODY.  ONE 
INDIVIDUAL, THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF THE ROME AIRPORT 
ATTACK, IS CURRENTLY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN ITALY. 
THE TWO SURVIVORS OF THE VIENNA AIRPORT ATTACK ARE 
SERVING LIFE SENTENCES IN AUSTRIA.  INFO ADDRESSEES MAY

OFFICIALS. 
 
4.  WE AGREE WITH EMBASSY THAT IRISH TIMES STATEMENTS 
ARE DAMAGING AND SHOULD NOT BE LEFT UNCHALLENGED.  WE 
SUGGEST POST ADVISE PAPER IN WHATEVER MANNER POST DEEMS 
MOST APPROPRIATE THAT LIBYA WAS INDEED DIRECTLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 1986 LABELLE DISCO BOMBING IN 
BERLIN.  FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT HAS BECOME AVAILABLE IN 
THE FILES OF THE FORMER GDR\'S SECURITY SERVICES FULLY 
CORROBORATES THE ORIGINAL ACCUSATION.  THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION CARRIED OUT THE 1985 ROME AND VIENNA 
AIRPORT ATTACKS WITH VITAL MATERIAL ASSISTANCE FROM 
LIBYA.  IN NO WAY IS IT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT LIBYA HAS 
BEEN EXONERATED, BY GERMAN AND ITALIAN POLICE OR BY ANY 
COMPETENT AUTHORITY.   DEPARTMENT SUGGESTS POST QUERY 
THE NEWSPAPER ON SOURCES FOR THE ASSERTIONS DESCRIBED IN 
REFTEL.  BECAUSE LIBYAN COMPLICITY IN THESE ATTACKS IS 
CONSIDERED A GIVEN BY TREVI GROUP INTELLIGENCE AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS GENERALLY, INCLUDING IRISH 
MEMBERS, WE SUSPECT LIBYA WILL PROVE THE SOURCE OF THE 
DISINFORMATION.

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FROM UNCONFIRMED INTELLIGENCE 
REPORTS: 
 
-- PKK AND SYRIAN OFFICIALS MET IN LEBANON SEVERAL TIMES 
IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH. 
 
-- THE PKK ASKED SYRIAN OFFICIALS TO TRANSFER SYRIANS OF

THE SYRIANS REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD CONVEY THE REQUEST TO 
THEIR AUTHORITIES. 
 
-- SEVEN SYRIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS CONDUCTED 
STUDIES OF THE TERRORIST CAMPS IN SUDAN ATTHE END OF 
FEBRUARY. 
 
-- AFTER THIS, THE PKK\'S HEAVY ARTILLERY AND AMMUNITION 
STORED AT THE MAHSUM KORKMAZ ACADEMY WERE TRANSFERRED TO 
THE SYRIAN DIVISION IN BEIRUT/ANJAR. 
 
-- SYRIA AND THE PKK ARE TAKING CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS LATELY 
BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING VISIT TO SYRIA OF THE TURKISH 
MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR, AND STATEMENTS BY THE TURKISH 
GOVERNMENT THAT SYRIA SUPPORTS PKK TERRORISM. 
 
-- THE PKK OPENED TWO NEW CAMPS IN THE BEKAA VALLEY EAST

SUBJECT:  RUSSIAN INTEREST IN COUNTER-TERRORISM 
COOPERATION 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL -- ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: RUSSIAN EMBASSY COUNSELLOR EDWARD MALAYAN, 
ACCOMPANIED BY SECOND SECRETARY BUGAYEV, CALLED ON S/CT 
DIRECTOR FOR REGIONAL AFFAIRS JON GREENWALD MAY 6 TO 
PICK UP COPY OF THE DEPARTMENT\'S JUST ISSUED REPORT 
\"PATTERNS OF TERRORISM 1991.\"   HE CONFIRMED RUSSIAN 
INTEREST IN RESUMING THE DIALOGUE ON COUNTER-TERRORISM 
COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. THAT HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED WITH 
THE DISSOLUTION OF THE SOVIET UNION.  GREENWALD SAID THE 
U.S. WOULD WELCOME THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENT WAS READY TO PROCEED SINCE THERE WERE 
PRACTICAL ISSUES WHICH IT COULD BENEFIT BOTH SIDES TO 
DISCUSS. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  GREENWALD SAID THAT THE NEW REPORT PRESENTED A MIXED 
PICTURE.  THERE HAD BEEN POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS DURING 
THE YEAR, INCLUDING THE EXCELLENT INTERNATIONAL 
COOPERATION AGAINST IRAQI TERRORISM CAPABILITIES AT THE 
TIME OF THE GULF WAR AND THE BEGINNING OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS\' EFFORT TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE IN THE PAN AM AND UTA 
BOMBINGS AND END LIBYAN SPONSORSHIP OF TERRORISM.  IT 
WAS OBVIOUS FROM THE REPORT, HOWEVER. THAT TERRORISM 
REMAINED A SERIOUS CONCERN AND A HIGH USG PRIORITY. 
 
4.  MALAYAN ASKED ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR LIBYAN COMPLIANCE 
WITH THE SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND SAID THE 
DECISION TO REMOVE RUSSIAN MILITARY ADVISERS HAD BEEN 
PAINFUL FOR MOSCOW SINCE IT FORFEITED HARD CURRENCY. 
GREENWALD SAID SANCTIONS WERE GENERALLY BEING ADHERED TO 
VERY WELL, WITH SOME ROOM FOR QUESTION ON THE 
APPROPRIATE STANDARD FOR \"SIGNIFICANT\" REDUCTION OF 
LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE.  THE UNSC WOULD REVIEW THE 
COMPLIANCE REPORTS TO BE SUBMITTED BY MEMBER STATES BY 
MAY 15.  IT WAS TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHETHER THE SANCTIONS 
WOULD PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT ON LIBYA, HE SAID, BUT 
THE TIGHTER THEIR APPLICATION, THE BETTER THE CHANCE. 
THE U.S. KNEW HOW DIFFICULT THE MILITARY ADVISER 
DECISION HAD BEEN, HE SAID, AND DEEPLY APPRECIATED THE 
RUSSIAN POSITION. 
 
5.  IN RESPONSE TO MALAYAN\'S QUESTION, GREENWALD SAID 
THE RECENT TIME MAGAZINE COVER STORY QUESTIONING THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S VERSION OF THE PAN AM BOMBING WAS BASED ON 
OLD REPORTS THAT HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY CHECKED OUT AT THE 
TIME AND WERE CONSIDERED GROUNDLESS.  MALAYAN SAID \"WE 
LOOKED INTO THEM AND REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION.\" 
 
6.  THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS STILL IN SOME FLUX WITH 
RESPECT TO RESPONSIBILITY FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, MALAYAN 
SAID.  HE EXECTED THE LEGAL ADVISER TO RETAIN THE 
PRIMARY ROLE ON THE MFA SIDE.  IAKOVLEV, WHO HAD 
CONDUCTED THE INITIAL BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS FOR THE 
SOVIET UNION WITH AMBASSADOR BUSBY IN 1990-1991, 
HOWEVER, HAD BEEN REMOVED IN DECEMBER.  HIS \"YOUNG\" 
REPLACEMENT WAS ABOUT TO BE TRANSFERED AS AMBASSADOR TO 
THE NETHERLANDS, AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHO WOULD TAKE 
OVER.  WE WOULD FIND, HE ADDED, THAT MOST OF THE KGB 
SPECIALISTS WITH WHOM WE HAD DEALT IN THOSE SESSIONS 
CONTINUED TO OCCUPY SIMILAR POSITIONS IN THE NEW RUSSIAN 
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY. 
 
7.  THE U.S. WAS INTERESTED IN TAKING UP THIS IMPORTANT 
DIALOGUE WHEN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS READY, 
GREENWALD SAID.  A U.S. DELEGATION WAS IN MOSCOW THIS 
WEEK FOR THE EXPERT LEVEL TALKS CALLED FOR UNDER THE 
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON AIRCRAFT HIJACKING 
PROCEDURES, BUT WE WISHED TO PURSUE ALSO THE BROADER 
THEMES THAT HAD BEGUN TO BE DISCUSSED PRODUCTIVELY WITH 
THE SOVIET UNION. 
 
8.  MALAYAN SAID THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AGREED IT 
WAS IMPORTANT TO RESUME THIS DIALOGUE.  IN ADDITION TO 
ISSUES SUCH AS LIBYA, HE SAID, THE SITUATION IN PARTS OF 
THE FORMER SOVIET UNION GAVE RISE TO TERRORISM 
CONCERNS.  RUSSIA CONTINUED TO WORRY ABOUT NUCLEAR 
TERRORISM, WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY THE SOVIET 
DELEGATION IN EARLIER CONSULTATIONS AND HAD ACQUIRED 
MORE URGENCY WITH THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION. 
THERE HAD EVEN BEEN SUCH A THREAT AT ONE POINT BY 
CHECHENS IN THEIR DISPUTE WITH MOSCOW, HE NOTED.

--PERU:  FUJIMORI GAINS STRENGTH 

IN THE SIX MONTHS SINCE THE APRIL 5 CIVIL-MILITARY COUP. 
PRESIDENT ALBERTO FUJIMORI HAS OUTMANEUVERED THE 
OPPOSITION, PLACATED THE OAS. AND WON A STUNNING VICTORY 
IN THE BATTLE WITH THE SHINING PATH (SL) BY CAPTURING 
ABIMAEL GUZMAN, ITS FOUNDER AND LEADER.  ALTHOUGH PERU 
HAS ONE OF THE MOST STRINGENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS IN 
LATIN AMERICA. FUJIMORI.S POPULARITY RATING IS CLOSE TO 
75 PERCENT IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 12 CAPTURE, AND 
NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT PARTIES LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT 
APPEAR POISED TO WIN A MAJORITY IN THE NOVEMBER 22 
DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENT CONGRESS (CCD) ELECTIONS. 

THE NEW CONSTITUTION PROBABLY WILL STRENGTHEN THE POWERS 
OF THE PRESIDENCY AND UNDERCUT THE DOMINANCE OF THE 
TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES.  FUJIMORI.S AUTOCRATIC 
AND SECRETIVE MODUS OPERANDI ULTIMATELY MAY UNDERMINE 
HIS EFFORTS. HOWEVER.  (C) 

DEAD END FOR SHINING PATH?  THE PRESIDENT\'S PLEDGE TO 
WIPE OUT TERRORISM BY 1995 GAINED SUBSTANTIALLY IN 
CREDIBILITY WITH GUZMAN.S ARREST\' PARTICULARLY BECAUSE 
IT FOLLOWED THE JUNE CAPTURE OF MRTA LEADER VICTOR 
POLAY.  GUZMAN\'S DETENTION COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A 
BETTER TIME FOR FUJIMORI, IN VIEW OF THE NOVEMBER CCD 
ELECTIONS.  THE EUPHORIA IN LIMA IS PALPABLE, THOUGH 
ACCOMPANIED BY FEAR OF NEAR-TERM SL RETALIATION.  (C) 

IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER SL CAN REGROUP UNDER NEW 
LEADERSHIP.  THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO EXPECT A 
SHORT-TERM COLLAPSE, BUT SL\'S LONG-TERM PROSPECTS APPEAR 
DIMMER.  THE OUTCOME OF GUZMAN\'S MILITARY TRIAL IS NOT 
IN DOUBT, THOUGH THE SCHEDULED OCTOBER 27 ANNOUNCEMENT 
OF THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE IS LIKELY TO PROVOKE A 
VIOLENT SL RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY IF FUJIMORI FINDS A WAY 
TO JUSTIFY THE DEATH PENALTY.  (C) 

INTERESTED PARTIES.  FUJIMORI JUST1FIED HIS APRIL 5 
DISSOLUTION OF CONGRESS PARTLY ON GROUNDS THAT AN 
ANTIDEMOCRATIC \"PARTYOCRACY\" DEPRIVED THE PEOPLE OF 
\"REAL DEMOCRACY.\"  PROCEEDING ON THIS PREMISE, FUJIMORI 
HAS TRIED TO DIFFUSE THE POWER OF THE TRADITIONAL 
PARTIES. WHICH CONSTITUTE HIS MAIN OPPOSITION.  BOWING 
TO PRESSURE FROM THE OAS FUJIMORI AGREED TO A NATIONAL 
DIALOGUE AS A PRELUDE TO CCD ELECTIONS.  BUT THE 
FRACTIOUS PARTIES LARGELY BOYCOTTED THE PROCEEDINGS. 
ALLOWING THE PRESIDENT TO WRITE HIS OWN ELECTORAL 
RULES.  (C) 

BEFORE GUZMAN\'S CAPTURE, MOST PARTIES FEARED THAT 
ENTERING THE CCD CONTESTS WOULD LEGITIMIZE A FUJIMORI 
DICTATORSHIP AND HOPED THAT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE WOULD 
FORCE CONCESSIONS.  SOME OF THESE PARTIES NOW APPEAR TO 
BE LEANING TOWARD PARTICIPATION IN THE ELECTIONS.  THE 
POPULAR CHRISTIAN PARTY HAS OPTED TO ENTER.  EXILED 
FORMER PRESIDENT GARCIA.S APRA, HOWEVER, HAS DECIDED TO 
BOYCOTT. PERHAPS FEARING AN EMBARRASSINGLY POOR 
SHOWING.  FORMER PRESIDENT BELAUNDE\'S POPULAR ACTION HAS 
DECIDED TO FORGO THE CCD CONTESTS BUT TO RUN IN NEXT 
JANUARY.S MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS.  SMALLER PARTIES ARE 
GATHERING SIGNATURES OR FORMING COALITIONS TO QUALIFY 
FOR REGISTRATION BY OCTOBER 8.  (C) 

WHILE THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES BICKER INTERNALLY ABOUT 
WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS, FUJIMORI\'S 
CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY UNDER WAY.  POLLS REFLECT 
WIDESPREAD REJECTION OF THE TRADITIONAL PARTIES AND AN 
OVERWHELMING VOTER PREFERENCE FOR NOMINALLY INDEPENDENT 
CANDIDATES.  FUJIMORI IS OFFERING SUPPORTERS THREE 
BRANDS OF THE SAME BASIC PRODUCT:  HIS 1990 ELECTORAL 
VEHICLE CHANGE 90; THE RECENTLY FORMED NEW MAJORITY 
MOVEMENT, HEADED BY HIS FORMER ENERGY MINISTER AND 
CONFIDANT JAIME YOSHIYAMA; AND, ACCORDING TO A PRESS 
REPORT, AN \"INDEPENDENT\" PARTY HEADED BY FORMER FOREIGN 
MINISTER CARLOS TORRES.  (C) 

IF THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, FUJIMORI LOYALISTS 
WOULD CLEARLY WIN A MAJORITY.  ASSUMING THEY DO SO IN 
NOVEMBER, THE NEW CCD PROBABLY WILL DRAFT A 
CONSTITUTION TAILORMADE FOR FUJIMORI, POSSIBLY 
INCLUDING NEW FROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR REELECTION OF AN 
INCUMBENT PRESIDENT.  (C) 

FUJIOCRACY.  FUJIMORI SEEMS TO BE GETTING AWAY WITH HIS 
UNUSUAL CIVIL-MILITARY COUP.  HE CONTINUES TO ENJOY THE 
SUPPORT OF THE ARMED FORCES WHICH, DESPITE SOME 
RUMBLINGS IN THE RANKS, ARE PROBABLY DISINCLINED TO 
TAKE POWER THEMSELVES OR RETURN IT TO THE DISCREDITED 
PARTIES.  THE RECENT SACKING OF AIR FORCE COMMANDER 
VELARDE UNDERSCORES FUJIMORI.S SELF-CONFIDENCE 
VIS-A-VIS THE TOP BRASS.  HIS TIMETABLE AND GROUND 
RULES FOR RESTORATION OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE 
PLACATED THE OAS, AND THE PUBLIC SEEMS UNMOVED BY THE 
PARTIES\' COMPLAINTS ABOUT FUJIMORI\'S MANIPULATION OF 
THE PROCESS.  (C) 

FUJIMORI IS MORE IN TOUCH WITH HIS PREDOMINANTLY 
MESTIZO AND INDIAN COUNTRYMEN THAN THE LIMA ELITE EVER 
WAS.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE \"NEW PERU\" UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION IS THAT IT COULD BE TOO BASED ON FUJIMORI 
TO OUTLAST HIM.  THE PRESIDENT REMAINS SKEPTICAL OF 
INSTITUTIONS, DISTRUSTFUL OF ALL BUT A HANDFUL OF 
CONFIDANTS, AND DRIVEN BY A POTENTIALLY 
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE MESSIANIC ZEAL.  HE MAY WELL ATTEMPT 
TO ENGINEER HIS OWN REELECTION IN 1995, THEREBY 
FULFILLING HIS 1991 OFF-HAND REMARK THAT PERU \"NEEDS AN 
EMPEROR FOR 10 YEARS.\"  HIS DEPARTURE FROM THE SCENE. 
WILLINGLY OR OTHERWISE, COULD LEAVE A VACUUM THAT THE 
TRADITIONAL PARTIES AND ARMED FORCES WOULD VIE TO 
FILL.  (C) (DRAFTED BY JAMES ALLEN) 

--EL SALVADOR-HONDURAS:  SOLOMONIC BORDER RULING 

THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE (ICJ) ON SEFTEMBER 
11 RENDERED A LENGTHY AND COMPLICATED DECISION ON THE 
LONGSTANDING SALVADOR-HONDURAS BORDER DISPUTE, AWARDING 
ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS OF THE LAND AREAS (BOLSONES) IN 
QUESTION TO HONDURAS.  EL SALVADOR RECEIVED THE TWO 
LARGEST ISLANDS IN THE GULF OF FONSECA--MEANGUERA AND 
MEANGUERITA--WHILE EL TIGRE ISLAND WENT TO HONDURAS, 
WHICH WAS GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE PACIFIC.  THE ICJ 
ALSO GRANTED EL SALVADOR, HONDURAS, AND NICARAGUA JOINT 
SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GULF BEYOND 3 NAUTICAL MILES FROM 
THEIR RESPECTIVE SHORES.  (C) 

SALVADORANS STUNNED.  PRIOR TO THE DECISION, 
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IN BOTH COUNTRIES WAS THAT 
LAND-POOR EL SALVADOR WOULD BE AWARDED THE BOLSONES. 
THE DECISION GIVING THE MAJOR PORTION TO HONDURAS WAS A 
BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT PUBL1CLY AT LEAST MOST 
SALVADORANS TRIED TO PUT THE BEST FACE ON THE OUTCOME. 
PRIVATELY. THERE WERE MUTTERINGS THAT CRISTIANI HAD 
FAILED TO PREPARE THE POPULATION FOR AN ADVERSE 
OUTCOME  AND HIS ARENA PARTY WOULD SUFFER FOR IT.  (S) 

DEMILITARIZED ZONE?  THE FMLN, MEANWHILE, CLAIMED 
CRISTIANI WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
BOLSONES BECAUSE THEY WERE POPULATED PRIMARILY BY \"ITS\" 
PEOPLE.  ALTHOUGH THE DISPUTED AREAS ARE NOT HEAVILY 
POPULATED (ABOUT 25,000). 10,000-15,000 ARE FMLN 
SUPPORTERS OR SYMPATHIZERS WITH THEIR OWN CIVIC AND 
ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS.  HAVING OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY 
OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR YEARS, THESE CADRE DO NOT WELCOME 
A HONDURAN PRESENCE NOW.  (S) 

THE FMLN HAS PROPOSED DEMILITARIZING THE AREAS OR 
TURNING THEM INTO A FREE-TRADE ZONE AND GIVING 
RESIDENTS DUAL CITIZENSHIP.  THE FMLN ALSO WANTS 
REPRESENTATION ON THE BINATIONAL COMMISSION ESTABLISHED 
BY PRESIDENTS CRISTIANI AND CALLEJAS TO IMPLEMENT THE 
ICJ DECISION AND IS REQUESTING A UN OBSERVER MISSION TO 
PROTECT BOLSONES INHABITANTS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES\' 
MILITARIES.  (S) 

HONDURANS CAUTIOUS.  MILITARY AND CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP 
BOTH APPEARED PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THE RULING AND 
ALERT TO THE SENSITIVITY OF UPROOTING OR RELOCATING 
BOLSONES RESIDENTS.  GENERAL DISCUA AND OTHERS 
REPORTEDLY HAVE ADVISED CALLEJAS TO PROCEED WITH 
CAUTION AND WITHOUT ARROGANCE.  NEVERTHELESS HONDURAS 
IS NOT LIKELY TO ALLOW THE FMLN TO REMAIN IN CONTROL IN 
HONDURAN TERRITORY.  NEITHER IS GENERAL DISCUA LIKELY 
TO ACQUIESCE IN A DEMILITARIZED ZONE ON THE HONDURAN 
BORDER.  BOTH COUNTRIES SAY THEY WILL RELY ON THE 
BINATIONAL COMMISSION TO RESOLVE DIFFICULT HUMAN RIGHTS 
ISSUES.  (S) 

CALLEJAS WILL LEAD A LARGE DELEGATION TO SAN SALVADOR 
FOR CONSULTATIONS AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER  THUS 
BEGINNING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD OF BILATERAL 
DISCUSSIONS BEFORE DEMARCATION OF THE NEW BORDERS.  THE 
ICJ RULING APPARENTLY REQUIRES ALL THREE RIFARIAN 
COUNTRIES--HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR, AND NICARAGUA--TO 
WORK OUT ISSUES OF ACCESS AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS EXTENDING 
FROM THE GULF OF FONSECA INTO THE PACIFIC.  AT THE 
MOMENT, NO ONE APPEARS EAGER TO ENGAGE FORMALLY WITH 
NICARAGUA ON THIS ISSUE.  (C) (DRAFTED BY VIVIAN 
GILLESPIE) 

--  NICARAGUA:  POLICE AND PROPERTY REFORMS...ALMOST 

RECENT PERSONNEL CHANGES AND A NEW \"ORGANIC\" LAW APPEAR 
TO MAKE ONLY SUPERFICIAL CHANGES IN THE 
SANDINISTA-DOMINATED POLICE.  THE PROGRESS OF THE 
CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT\'S EFFORTS IN POLICE REFORM, 
INVESTIGATION OF ANTI-CONTRA VIOLENCE, AND PROPERTY 
SETTLEMENT REMAINS GLACIALLY INCREMENTAL.  (C) 

THE ORGANIC POLICE LAW PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 11 SETS 
TERMS OF OFFICE AND PERMITS DISMISSAL FOR CAUSE. BUT IT 
ALSO ENSURES CONTINUED SANDINISTA LEADERSHIP IN TOP 
JOBS BY PROMOTION FROM WITHIN.  MOREOVER, IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO GIVE THE NEW CIVILIAN VICE MINISTER OF 
GOVERNMENT. ROLAND AVILES. CONTROL OVER PERSONNEL 
ASSIGNMENTS AND, HENCE. PROMOTION.  AVILES IS DESCRIBED 
AS STRIDENTLY ANTI-SANDINISTA, BUT VERY CLOSE TO 
PRESIDENCY MINISTER LACAYO AND MORE OF AN IMPLEMENTER 
THAN AN INITIATOR.  (S) 

REACTION TO POLICE CHANGES.  REACTION AMONG 
NON-SANDINISTAS TO THE APPOINTMENT OF FERNANDO CALDERA 
TO REPLACE RENE VIVAS AS POLICE CHIEF HAS BEEN 
NEGATIVE, ACCORDING TO EMBASSY MANAGUA.  NICARAGUAN 
HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS DESCRIBE CALDERA AS 
\"DANGEROUS\" AND A \"COMMITTED SANDINISTA.\"  THE BISHOP 
OF CHONTALES, WHO CLASHED WITH CALDERA IN YEARS PAST, 
SAID HE WAS \"AMAZED\" BY THE APPOINTMENT.  THE BISHOP 
AND OTHERS CITED RAMPANT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND BAD 
PRISON CONDITIONS UNDER CALDERA.S TENURE AS A REGIONAL 
POLICE CHIEF IN THE EARLY-TO-MID 1980S.  (C) 

FORMER RESISTANCE LEADER AND NOW SOCIAL CHRISTIAN 
DEPUTY AZUCENA FERREY SAW ONE POSITIVE ASPECT:  THAT 
FORMER SANDINISTA INTERIOR MINISTER TOMAS BORGE WAS NOW 
FINISHED\" IN NICARAGUA BECAUSE THOSE DISMISSED WERE 
FROM HIS WING OF THE FSLN.  (C) 

THE GOVERNMENT INSISTS THAT CALDERA WAS THE BEST CHOICE 
OF THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR THE JOB.  CALDERA, FOR HIS FART. 
HAS PLEDGED TO IMPROVE POLICE BEHAVIOR AND INVESTIGATE 
THE ASSASSINATIONS OF FORMER CONTRA LEADER ENRIQUE 
BERMUDEZ AND OTHERS.  (C) 

ARCHBISHOP OBANDO Y BRAVO HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPAL TO 
PARTICIPATE IN A TRIPARTITE COMMISSION. TOGETHER WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF OAS/CIAV AND THE GOVERNMENT. TO LOOK 
INTO KILLINGS OF MORE THAN 100 EX-CONTRAS SINCE 1990. 
PLANS TO ESTABLISH THE COMMISSION FRAMEWORK APPEAR TO 
BE MOVING AHEAD.  (C) 

PROPERTY DECREES ANNOUNCED.  THE COMPLICATED PROCESS OF 
UNTANGLING 10 YEARS OF SANDINISTA CONFISCATIONS AND 
LAND REFORM IS INCHING FORWARD.  ON SEPTEMBER 9 A 
DECREE SIGNED BY CHAMORRO CREATED A PROPERTY ATTORNEY 
TO HEAD A THREE-PERSON NATIONAL COMMISSION TO 
INVESTIGATE AND RECOMMEND RETURN OF PROPERTY OR 
COMPENSATION.  THE REMAINDER OF THE PROPERTY 
PACKAGE--AN OFFICE IN THE FINANCE MINISTRY TO DETERMINE 
CLAIM VALUES AND TO ESTABLISH A COMPENSATION FUND AND 
AN ARBITRATION MECHANISM--SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED LATER 
THIS MONTH, ACCORDING TO EMBASSY MANAGUA.  THIS 
APPROACH LEAVES IN SANDINISTA POSSESSION PROPERTIES 
SEIZED AFTER THE ELECTION, WHILE IT OBLIGATES THE 
GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE ANY COMPENSATION DUE THE ORIGINAL 
OWNERS.  (C) 

THIS FAR AND NO FURTHER.  THE CHAMORRO GOVERNMENT 
EVIDENTLY HOPES THE CHANGES WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR 
RELEASE OF BADLY NEEDED US ASSISTANCE.  FAILURE TO 
RECEIVE THE US FUNDS PROBABLY WILL PUT NICARAGUA IN 
NONCOMPLIANCE WITH ITS IMF PROGRAM AND WOULD ENDANGER 
THE RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC PROGRAM.  INCENSED 
BY US PRESSURES, CHAMORRO NONETHELESS HAS WARNED SHE 
WILL RESIGN RATHER THAN ACCEDE TO MORE DRASTIC US 
DEMANDS, AND LACAYO SHOWS NO SIGN OF WILLINGNESS TO 
CONSIDER FURTHER CHANGES IN THE POLICE OR ARMY 
LEADERSHIP AT THIS TIME.  (C) (DRAFTED BY VIVIAN

--  MEXICO:  LABOR PROBLEMS 

ANTICIPATION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
(NAFTA) IS BRINGING A WRENCHING ADJUSTMENT TO FIRMS IN 
MEXICO.  LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ARE BEING REDEFINED 
AS FIRMS SEEK TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY 
BY INTRODUCING MORE FLEXIBLE WORK RULES AND NEW FORMS 
OF MANUFACTURING AND INVENTORY CONTROL.  THIS OFTEN 
MEANS FEWER WORKERS AND LINKING WAGE HIKES TO 
PRODUCTIVITY, THREATENING THE POWER OF TRADITIONAL 
UNION BOSSES ACCUSTOMED TO DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE 
ON COMPANY OPERATIONS.  (C) 

THE NEW MEXICO.  TO INCREASE MEXICO.S ATTRACTIVENESS TO 
FOREIGN INVESTORS, PRESIDENT SALINAS HAS TRIED STEADILY 
TO TRIM UNION POWER YET NOT BREAK FAITH WITH THE 
POWERFUL MEXICAN LABOR CONFEDERATION (CTM). A 
TRADITIONAL, ALBEIT WANING, PILLAR OF THE RULING PRI 
AND A MECHANISM FOR CONTROLLING LABOR.  SINCE TAKING 
OFFICE, SALINAS HAS ORDERED THE ARREST OF CORRUPT UNION 
OFFICIALS, PROMOTED NEW LABOR LEADERS, AND USED THE 
DECENTRALIZATION OF PARASTATALS (PEMEX. FOR EXAMPLE) 
AND SUCH GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS AS EDUCATION TO WEAKEN 
CORPORATIST UNION POWER.  BUT HE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO 
TAKE ON THE CTM AND ITS POWERFUL NONAGENARIAN LEADER. 
FIDEL VELAZQUEZ, DIRECTLY BY ATTEMFTING TO REFORM 
MEXICO.S RIGID, OUTDATED LABOR CODE.  (C) 

A TURNING POINT?  THE SALINAS ADMINISTRATION SENT A 
STRONG SIGNAL TO LABOR WHEN THE NATIONAL LABOR BOARD, 
PROBABLY AT SALINAS\'S BEHEST, RULED ON AUGUST 17 IN 
FAVOR OF VOLKSWAGEN, MEXICO\'S LARGEST CAR MAKER, IN ITS 
DISPUTE WITH DISSIDENT UNIONISTS.  IN EARLY JULY THE 
DISSIDENTS LED A STRIKE OF 14,000 MEMBERS OF THE 
INDEPENDENT AUTO WORKERS UNION AT VW.S PUEBLA PLANT, 
WHICH MAKES MEXICO\'S BEST-SELLING BEETLE, AND CARS FOR 
EXPORT.  THE STRIKERS CLAIMED THE ELECTED UNION 
PRESIDENT HAD SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT--ACCEPTING 
PROVISIONS TYING RAISES AND PROMOTIONS TO 
PRODUCTIVITY--WITHOUT VETTING IT WITH THE RANK AND 
FILE.  (S) 

VW RESPONDED BY VOIDING ITS OLD UNION CONTRACT. LOCKING 
OUT STRIKERS, AND THREATENING TO LEAVE MEXICO--A 
DEVELOPMENT THE GOVERNMENT FEARED COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE 
EFFECT ON NAFTA AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS.  THE LABOR 
BOARD\'S RULING WILL PERMIT THE COMPANY TO REHIRE MOST 
OF THE WORKERS ON TERMS THAT ENSURE GREATER MANAGEMENT 
FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE.  VW REPORTEDLY PLANS TO 
BRING IN 40 GERMAN AUTO PARTS MANUFACTURERS TO ALLOW IT 
TO MEET NAFTA CONTENT RULES.  (S) 

MEANWHILE. 20,000 TEXTILE WORKERS WENT ON A 58-DAY 
STRIKE TO DEMAND HIGHER WAGES AND TO PROTEST WORK RULES 
THAT MEANT FEWER JOBS.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL PRESS 
REPORTS  MOST OF THE TROUBLE WAS IN NONCOMFETITIVE 
FIRMS PRODUCING FOR THE DOMESTIC MARKET:  MEXICAN 
EXPORT COMPANIES ARE ALREADY MAKING THE CAPITAL 
INVESTMENTS NEEDED TO COMPETE UNDER NAFTA.  THE STRIKE. 
WHICH WAS PUBLICLY SUPPORTED BY CTM LEADER VELAZQUEZ, 
ENDED AMICABLY ON SEPTEMBER 4 WHEN GOVERNMENT. LABOR. 
AND INDUSTRY LEADERS AGREED TO A 14-PERCENT WAGE HIKE 
AND 50-PERCENT PAYMENT FOR LOST WAGES.  (C) 

SPOKESMEN FOR THE WORKERS CLAIM THE SETTLEMENT MEANS 
THE INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE CONTRACT, WHICH EXPIRED IN 
JULY, REMAINS IN FORCE.  MANY TEXTILE WORKERS HAD 
PREVIOUSLY REACHED SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR 
COMPANIES. HOWEVER; WORKERS IN MONTERREY\'S HIGHLY 
AUTOMATED PLANTS RECEIVED 30-PERCENT SALARY HIKES. 
MOREOVER. DESPITE THE PRI.S PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE 
STRIKERS. THE GOVERNMENT IN PRACTICE ALLOWED THE 
COLLECTIVE LABOR LAW TO BE IGNORED. THEREBY SETTING A 
PRECEDENT FOR RESOLVING FUTURE LABOR CONFLICTS.  THIS 
SETTLEMENT, LIKE THE ONE AT VOLKSWAGEN, REPRESENTS A 
VICTORY FOR MANAGEMENT.  (C) 

NO PAIN, NO GAIN.  EXPANDED TRADE SHOULD INCREASE REAL 
WAGES FOR MOST MEXICAN WORKERS, BUT MANY OTHERS FACE 
DISLOCATION AS COMPANIES RESTRUCTURE OR FOLD.  LABOR 
ACTIVISTS IN THREATENED AREAS SAY BUSINESSES ARE USING 
NAFTA AS A PRETEXT TO WEAKEN THE UNIONS, INCREASING THE 
POTENTIAL FOR LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONFLICT IN THE SHORT TO 
MEDIUM TERM.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE WELL AWARE THAT 
ONE DOWNSIDE OF NAFTA IS THAT AS LABOR POWER BECOMES 
LESS CENTRALIZED. IT WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL 
THE UNIONS THROUGH TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PAYOFFS, AND 
LABOR\'S LOYALTY TO THE PRI MAY BE IMPERILED.  (S) 
(DRAFTED BY ANGELO IOFREDDA) 

--  ECUADOR:  ECONOMIC REFORM ADVANCES DESPITE PROTESTS 

THE NEW PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR, FREE MARKET PROPONENT 
SIXTO DURAN, IS IMPLEMENTING A SERIES OF SPENDING CUTS 
AS THE FIRST STAGE OF A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO 
LIBERALIZE AN ECONOMY MIRED IN RECESSION.  (C) 

AUSTERITY NOW, LIBERALIZATION SOON.  AS HE PROMISED AT 
HIS INAUGURATION. DURAN THIS MONTH OUTLINED A REFORM 
PROGRAM INTENDED TO REVERSE SHARP ECONOMIC DECLINE. 
THE GOVERNMENT DEVALUED THE SUCRE BY 28 PERCENT AND 
RAISED THE SUBSIDIZED PRICES OF GASOLINE BY 125 PERCENT 
AND ELECTRICITY BY AS MUCH AS 120 PERCENT.  DURAN PLANS 
TO CUT GOVERNMENT SPENDING BY 4 PERCENT ACROSS THE 
BOARD, AND ALREADY HAS OBTAINED ASSURANCES FROM 
COMMANDERS THAT THEY WILL NOT OPPOSE SIMILAR CUTS IN 
THE MILITARY.  TO FORESTALL POPULAR UNREST, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS FROZEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT PRICES AND 
PROMISED WAGE INCREASES.  AT THE SAME TIME, ECUADOR 
WILL LOWER TRADE BARRIERS WITH COLOMBIA. BOLIVIA. AND 
VENEZUELA.  (C) 

DURAN INTENDS TO FOLLOW THIS INITIAL ROUND OF MEASURES 
BY FREEING INTEREST RATES AND SUBMITTING TO CONGRESS 
BILLS ON CAPITAL MARKET REFORM AND PRIVATIZATION.  THE 
GOVERNMENT PLANS TO BEGIN PRIVATIZING THE HUGE STATE 
SECTOR BY FIRST LEGALIZING PRIVATE COMPETITION TO 
GOVERNMENT MONOPOLIES AND THEN SELLING ITS HOLDINGS IN 
PRIVATE CORPORATIONS.  UNDER THIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH, 
THE PRIVATIZATION OF LARGE STATE COMPANIES WILL 
FOLLOW.  (C) 

ECONOMY IN DOLDRUMS.  DURAN.S IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO 
REDUCE INFLATION BY CUTTING EXPENDITURES AND INCREASING 
TAX REVENUES.  DURAN\'S TEAM OF FREE MARKETEERS IS 
HEADED BY HIS VICE PRESIDENT. PRINCETON-EDUCATED 

LIBERALIZATION LED THE OPPOSITION TO CALL HIM  AN 
\"ECONOMIC TERRORIST.\"  EIGHT OF 14 CABINET MEMBERS ARE 
BUSINESS EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING THE MINISTERS OF 
FINANCE. INDUSTRY. AND ENERGY.  (C) 

DURAN INHERITED AN ECONOMY BESET BY STAGNATION, 
50-PERCENT INFLATION, A BUDGET DEFICIT OF 7 PERCENT OF 
GDF AND OVERRELIANCE ON OIL INCOME.  OIL NOW ACCOUNTS 
FOR HALF OF GOVERNMENT INCOME AND 40 PERCENT OF 
EXPORTS. BUT RESERVES ARE EXPECTED TO BE DEPLETED 
WITHIN 12 YEARS.  NEGOTIATIONS WITH CREDITORS ON 
ECUADOR.S ALMOST US DOLS 13 BILLION FOREIGN DEBT ARE 
STALLED.  UNDEREMFLOYMENT IS ESTIMATED AT 50 PERCENT. 
DEMAND FOR LABOR IS HELD DOWN BY A LABOR CODE OF MORE 
THAN 600 ARTICLES THAT REGULATES ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF 
EMPLOYMENT  EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITING MANAGEMENT FROM 
FIRING OR LAYING OFF WORKERS.  CONGRESS REFORMED THE 
CODE SLIGHTLY LAST YEAR, BUT MANAGERS STILL REGARD 
HIRING NEW WORKERS AS A LAST RESORT.  (C) 

WEAK PROTESTS AGAINST REFORM.  THE LARGEST LABOR GROUP, 
THE UNITED WORKERS FRONT, THREATENED TO CALL FOR 
NATIONWIDE CIVIL UNREST IF THE PRESIDENT WENT AHEAD 
WITH HIS PLANS, AND THE HEAD OF THE PUBLIC EMFLOYEES 
UNION LABELED THE REFORMS \"NEFARIOUS.\"  PROPAGANDA 
SUPFORTING PERU.S SENDERO LUMINOSO TERRORISTS HAS NOW 
APPEARED IN SEVERAL CITIES   ANTICIPATING A REACTION TO 
HIS SEPTEMBER 4 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE AUSTERITY PACKAGE. 
THE PRESIDENT AUTHORIZED DEPLOYMENT OF THE ARMED 
FORCES, AND TROOPS WERE ORDERED INTO THE STREETS ON 
SEPTEMBER 7 AFTER FOUR SMALL BOMBS EXPLODED AT 
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.  (C) 

SO FAR THE PROTESTS HAVE HAD NO EFFECT.  A RESOUNDING 
REJECTION BY THE ELECTORATE OF THE FAILED STATIST 
POLICIES OF THE PAST HAS GIVEN THE DURAN ADMINISTRATION 
A CLEAR MANDATE TO IMFLEMENT ITS SWIFT AND FAR-REACHING 
ECONOMIC REFORM AGENDA.  IN THE FIRST ROUND OF 
PRESIDENTIAL BALLOTING, DURAN AND HIS LIKE-MINDED CHIEF 
OPPONENT RECEIVED 55 PERCENT OF THE VOTE  AND THE THREE 
CENTER-RIGHT PARTIES IN COALITION WITH THE NEW 
PRESIDENT HOLD 39 OF THE 77 SEATS IN THE UNICAMERAL 
LEGISLATURE.

SUMMARY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED BY ACADEMICS AT A MAY 7 
CONFERENCE SPONSORED BY INR AND, AS SUCH\' DOES NOT 
REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  YOUR 
COMMENTS ARE WELCOMED. 
 
BEGIN SUMMARY 
 
2.  AN INR CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL ISLAM IN BLACK AFRICA 
HELD ON MAY 7 CONCLUDED THAT: 
 
--POLITICAL ISLAM THROUGHOUT THE MUSLIM WORLD IS NOT A 
MONOLITHIC FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT\' BUT A VARIED 
PHENOMENON, RANGING FROM REVOLUTIONARIES SUCH AS 
LEBANON\'S HIZBALLAH TO REFORMERS IN JORDAN AND KUWAIT. 
 
--ISLAMISTS ARE ROOTED IN BOTH THE PAST AND THE 
PRESENT.  THEY HAVE MODERN EDUCATIONS (TURABI. THE 
LEADER OF THE NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT IN SUDAN, IS 
TRILINGUAL) AND EFFICIENT ORGANIZATIONS (INCLUDING FAXES 
AND CASSETTES). 
 
--MILITANT BRANDS OF POLITICAL ISLAM DO NOT FOSE AN 
IMMINENT THREAT TO BLACK AFRICA.  THE MAJORITY OF 
AFRICAN MUSLIMS BELONG TO MAINSTREAM MUSLIM 
ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZATION AS A MEANS OF 
REFORMING CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS AND STAGNANT ECONOMIES. 
IF DEMOCRATIZATION FAILS, POLITICAL ISLAM COULD POSE A 
LONGER-TERM CHALLENGE TO STATES WITH LARGE MUSLIM 
POPULATIONS SUCH AS NIGERIA. 

--THE SUDANESE REGIME HAS PLANS FOR PROPAGATING 
POLITICAL ISLAM BUT LACKS THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS. 
KHARTOUM IS NOT A THREAT TO NEIGHBORING UGANDA OR KENYA, 
WHERE MUSLIMS ARE SMALL INEFFECTIVE MINORITIES.  A 
SUDANESE INVASION OF UGANDA, OR A SUDANESE LINK-UP WITH 
AN UGANDAN MUSLIM \"FIFTH COLUMN\" TO OVERTHROW MUSEVENI. 
ARE UNLIKELY. 

--IRAN DOES NOT GIVE A HIGH PRIORITY TO BLACK AFRICA, 
AND ITS ATTEMPT TO GAIN INFLUENCE HAS HAD ONLY LIMITED 
SUCCESS.  ITS LONG RANGE OBJECTIVES ARE UNCLEAR. 
TEHRAN\'S GREATEST ATTRACTION IS ITS DEFIANCE OF THE WEST. 

--THE REAL IMPACT OF POLITICAL ISLAM ON THE INTERESTS OF 
THE U.S. AND THE WEST LIES IN THE SPREAD OF ISLAMIC 
CULTURE.  AS WESTERN CULTURAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH 

ONCE HAD A CRITICAL IMPACT ON AFRICAN YOUTH, ARE 
REDUCED, ISLAMIC STATES ARE FILLING THE GAP. 

BEGIN TEXT 

3.  INR\'S MAY 7 CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL ISLAM IN BLACK 
AFRICA BROUGHT TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING ACADEMIC 
SPECIALISTS:  JOHN ESPOSITO, COLLEGE OF THE HOLY CROSS; 
JOHN VOLL, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE; NELSON KASFIR, 
DARTMOUTH COLLEGE; PRISCILLA STARRATT, NEW ENGLAND 
COLLEGE; AND JOHN HUNWICK, NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY. 

4.  THE CHALLENGE OF POLITICAL ISLAM:  ESPOSITO 
PRESENTED A POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR CONSIDERING POLITICAL 
ISLAM IN BLACK AFRICA.  THE WEST TENDS TO \"DEMONIZE\" 
POLITICAL ISLAM, PORTRAYING IT AS A MONOLITHIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST THREAT TO WESTERN VALUES.  THE REALITY IS 
A WIDE SPECTRUM OF MOVEMENTS THAT STRETCHES FROM AFRICA 
TO SOUTHEAST ASIA AND INCLUDES BOTH REVOLUTIONARIES AND 
REFORMERS.  REFORMERS CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY AND HAVE 
PARTICIPATED IN THE POLITICAL MAINSTREAM IN SUCH STATES 
AS JORDAN AND KUWAIT. 

5.  WHAT MAKES ISLAMISTS APPEAR TO BE A THREAT IN 
WESTERN EYES IS THEIR MODERNITY.  ALTHOUGH THEY ROOT 
THEIR PRESENT AND FUTURE GOALS IN PAST VALUES, THEY HAVE 
MODERN EDUCATIONS, ARE ORGANIZED, AND OFTEN BECOME THE 
LEADING OPPOSITION MOVEMENTS IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES. 
THE MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS  RELIGIOUS OR SECULAR, WANT 
DEMOCRACY.  THEY WISH TO LEGITIMIZE DEMOCRACY BY 
REJUVENATING THE ISLAMIC CONCEPTS OF CONSULTATION AND 
CONSENSUS.  SIMILARLY, JEWS AND CHRISTIANS HAD TO 
LEGITIMIZE DEMOCRACY, WHICH WAS ANTITHETICAL TO THEIR 
TRADITIONAL BELIEFS (THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH DID NOT 
ACCEPT POLITICAL PLURALISM UNTIL VATICAN II). 

6.  ATTEMPTS TO REPRESS ISLAMIST MOVEMENTS, SUCH AS 
NASSER\'S \"DECAPITATION\" OF THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, WILL 
STRENGTHEN AND RADICALIZE THEM.  ALTERNATIVELY, IF 
POLITICAL SYSTEMS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE, SOME 
ISLAMISTS MIGHT SELF-DESTRUCT, BUT OTHERS MIGHT BECOME 
MORE PRAGMATIC AND RESPOND TO BROADER CONSTITUENCIES, 
FOCUSING ON NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 

7.  FORMER AF ASSISTANT SECRETARY HERMAN COHEN NOTED THE 
U.S. PERCEPTION THAT POLITICAL ISLAM MEANS NASTY PEOPLE 
USING ISLAM TO UNDERMINE U.S. INTERESTS.  A REFERENCE 
WAS MADE TO CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER\'S RECENT ARTICLE 
LABELING POLITICAL ISLAM THE \"NEW COMINTERN.\"  ESPOSITO 
AND OTHER ACADEMICS ARGUED THAT THE CAPABILITIES OF THE 
SUDANESE AND IRANIAN REGIMES HAVE BEEN OVERESTIMATED. 

8.  POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN:  JOHN VOLL EMPHASIZED THAT 
THE NIF REGIME IN SUDAN IS NOT AN ABERRATION--A MOVEMENT 
PUT IN POWER BY ISLAMIST CONSPIRATORS IN 1989 OR SPAWNED 
BY THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION--BUT THE LOGICAL OUTCOME OF 
LONG-TERM TRENDS.  WHAT WOULD BE UNNATURAL WOULD BE A 
SUDANESE REGIME WHICH WAS NON-RELIGIOUS OR ANTI-MUSLIM, 
AND WHICH WAS UNINVOLVED IN THE AFFAIRS OF NEIGHBORING 
STATES.  HE SUPPORTED THESE CONCLUSIONS, AS FOLLOWS. 

--SUDAN HAS HAD A SERIES OF ISLAMIST GOVERNMENTS SINCE 
THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, INCLUDING THE FAMOUS MAHDIYYA 
(1884-1898).  EVEN THE BRITISH CONDOMINIUM (1899-1956) 
IDENTIFIED ITSELF AS A FRIEND OF ISLAM.  IN THE 
POST-1956 INDEPENDENCE PERIOD, NO SUDANESE ELECTED 
GOVERNMENT HAS DISASSOCIATED THE STATE FROM ISLAMIST 
TRADITIONS.  THE NIF GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE FIRST TO TRY 
TO UNIFY THE COUNTRY ON AN ISLAMIC BASIS.  THE NIF IS 
ONLY ONE STRAND OF POLITICAL ISLAM IN SUDAN, WHICH 
INCLUDES TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES SUCH AS THE UMMA. 

--SUDAN IS PART OF \"SUDANIC AFRICA,\" A BELT OF CULTURAL 
INTERACTION EXTENDING FROM WEST AFRICA TO THE GULF OF 
ARABIA.  AFRICANS MAKING THE PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA ARE IN 
MOTION ACROSS THE BELT, AND MANY SETTLE TEMPORARILY IN 
SUDAN.  CONSEQUENTLY, SUDANESE THINK MORE IN TERMS OF AN 
EAST/WEST AXIS THAN A NORTH/SOUTH AXIS.  SUDANESE 
INTEREST IN EGYPT HAS BEEN OVERSTATED; EGYPTIAN PEASANTS 
ARE NO MORE INTERESTED IN THE NIF THAN THEY WERE IN THE 
MAHDI.  IN CONTRAST, THE POROUS SUDAN-CHAD BORDER 
FACILITATED QADHAFI\'S INTERVENTION IN CHADIAN POLITICS 
AND ENABLED DEBY TO OVERTHROW THE PREVIOUS CHADIAN 
PRESIDENT.  SUDAN\'S EQUALLY POROUS EASTERN BORDER 
FACILITATES INTERACTION WITH ERITREA. 

--IN THE DISCUSSION PERIOD, DR. ROBERT JENKINS OF THE 
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE QUOTED NIF OFFICIALS AS 
SAYING THAT \"IF NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR BROTHERS, WE 
WILL USE FORCE.\"  ACCORDING TO VOLL, THE NIF IS NOT 
SAYING THAT IT WILL DISPATCH THE SUDANESE ARMY TO 
CONQUER AFRICA, BUT IS SAYING WHAT THE MUJAHADEEN, WHO 
WENT AS INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN, SAID--THAT 
EACH MUSLIM HAS THE OBLIGATION TO HELP OPPRESSED MUSLIMS 
ELSEWHERE. 

9.  THE NIF\'S IMPACT IN EAST AFRICA:  NELSON KASFIR 
ARGUED THAT THE NIF IS NOT A THREAT TO NEIGHBORING 
UGANDA AND KENYA, BUT COULD CAUSE SOME TROUBLE IN 
TANZANIA.  THE SUDANESE REGIME IS EXTREMELY WEAK, BOTH 
POLITICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  TURABI DOES NOT HAVE THE 
SUPPORT THAT HE DID A DECADE AGO.  THE NIF STAGED ITS 
1989 COUP TO KEEP FROM BEING FROZEN OUT OF POWER.  THE 
NIF ALSO HAS ITS HANDS FULL IN THE SOUTHERN SUDAN. 
DESPITE NIF MILITARY GAINS AND SOUTHERN INSURGENT 
SPLITS, THE REGIME CANNOT BREAK THE INSURGENTS\' HOLD ON 
THE SOUTHERN COUNTRYSIDE. 

10.  THE SUDANESE REGIME WILL CONTINUE TO BOMB THE 
UGANDAN BORDER AREAS OCCASIONALLY TO COUNTER MUSEVENI\'S 
AID TO SOUTHERN INSURGENTS, BUT AN INVASION IS 
UNLIKELY.  IT IS ALSO UNLIKELY THAT THE NIF COULD LINK 
UP WITH A \"FIFTH COLUMN\" OF UGANDAN MUSLIMS.  MUSEVENI 
IS ON REASONABLY GOOD TERMS WITH MUSLIMS IN NORTHWESTERN 
UGANDA, AND MANY OF THE UGANDANS HE IS AT ODDS WITH IN 
THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST ARE CHRISTIANS.  FURTHER, 
UGANDAN MUSLIMS ARE A SMALL. DIVIDED, SCORNED MINORITY 
(ESTIMATED AT 10 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION) WITH LITTLE 
POLITICAL CLOUT.  MOST UGANDAN MUSLIMS ARE CONCERNED 
WITH THEIR LOCAL INTERESTS AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED 
BY MUSEVENI\'S DEMOCRATIZATION PLANS. 

11.  KENYAN MUSLIMS ALSO ARE A SMALL, DIVIDED MINORITY 
(ESTIMATED AT FIVE TO SIX PERCENT OF THE POPULATION), 
OVERSHADOWED BY A LARGELY CHRISTIAN POLITICAL ELITE. 
MUSLIMS WHO LIVE ON THE COAST HAVE FELT ESPECIALLY 
MARGINALIZED SINCE INDEPENDENCE.  THEY FORMED A MUSLIM 
PARTY IN 1992 TO COMPETE IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE 
ELECTIONS, WINNING TWO SEATS IN AN ALLIANCE WITH A MAJOR 
OPPOSITION PARTY.  THE MUSLIM PARTY APPEARS TO BE A 
COALITION OF PEOPLE WITH LOCAL GRIEVANCES BUT NO WEDGE 
FOR INTRODUCING RELIGION INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA. 

12.  TANZANIA, WITH A MUCH LARGER MUSLIM POPULATION 
(ESTIMATED AT 30-40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION), MAY BE 
MORE RECEPTIVE TO SUDANESE PROSELYTIZING.  IN APRIL 1993 
THREE SUDANESE TEACHERS WERE DEPORTED FOR INCITING 
MUSLIMS AGAINST NON-MUSLIMS.  ALTHOUGH AN AFRICAN CANNOT 
GET AHEAD IN UGANDA NOR KENYA BY BECOMING A MUSLIM, IT 
COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN TANZANIA. 

13.  VOLL SAID THAT AN IRANIAN-ORIENTED BRAND OF 
POLITICAL ISLAM COULD APPEAL TO SMALL  SEPARATE MUSLIM 
MINORITIES IN STATES SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA AS A MEANS OF 
TRANSCENDING THEIR DIVISIONS.  COUNTERING THE APPEAL IN 
SOUTH AFRICA IS THE DESIRE OF MUSLIMS, MALAY OR ASIAN, 
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE POST-APARTHEID DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM 
NOW BEING NEGOTIATED. 
 
14.  POLITICAL ISLAM IN WEST AFRICA:  PRISCILLA STARRATT 
DISCUSSED POLITICAL ISLAM IN WEST AFRICAN STATES WHICH 
HAVE MAJORITY MUSLIM POPULATIONS.  SHE ATTRIBUTED ITS 
GROWING APPEAL TO ECONOMIC DECLINE, INCREASING 
INEQUALITIES, AND CORRUPTION.  MANY AFRICAN MUSLIMS 
BELIEVE THAT BOTH WESTERN CAPITALISM AND MARXISM\' AS 
WELL AS THE NATION-STATE, HAVE FAILED THEM AND THEY ARE 
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THEIR OWN 
CULTURE.  ISLAMIC GOVERNMENTS ARE VIEWED AS BEING JUST. 
SOME MUSLIMS SEE CHRISTIANITY AS A COLONIAL LEGACY AND 
BELIEVE THAT THE REESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC STATE IN 
THE SUDANIC BELT, WHERE ISLAMIC EMPIRES FLOURISHED 
DURING THE 18TH AND 19TH CENTURIES, WOULD BE THE FINAL 
STAGE OF DECOLONIZATION. 

15.  OVERALL, WEST AFRICAN MUSLIMS ARE DIVIDED ABOUT THE 
MERITS OF POLITICAL ISLAM, AND THERE ARE NO ACTIVE 
ISLAMIC PARTIES IN THE REGION.  WEST AFRICANS, IN 
GENERAL, ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH CONSTRUCTING NEW 
DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEMS WHICH OFFER HOPE FOR 
REFORM.  IF DEMOCRATIZATION FAILS. POLITICAL ISLAM COULD 
BECOME MORE IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUDANIC BELT. 

16.  STARRATT, WHO HAD LIVED FOR 15 YEARS IN NORTHERN 
NIGERIA, WAS CONCERNED ABOUT GROWING MUSLIM-CHRISTIAN 
TENSIONS IN THE NORTH AND IN NIGERIA AS A WHOLE.  THESE 
TENSIONS CENTER ON SUCH ISSUES AS SHARI\'A AND NIGERIA.S 
ATTEMPT TO JOIN THE ORGANIZATION OF ISLAMIC CONFERENCE. 
SHE WARNED THAT IF NIGERIANS FAIL TO REFORM THEIR 
CORRUPT GOVERNMENT AND REVIVE THEIR STAGNANT ECONOMY, 
ISLAMISTS COULD COME TO POWER WITHIN THE NEXT FEW 
YEARS.  THIS ASSESSMENT MET WITH SKEPTICISM FROM MOST 
PARTICIPANTS. 

17.  BLACK AFRICA AND THE WIDER ISLAMIC WORLD:  JOHN 
HUNWICK NOTED THAT PAN-ISLAMIC NETWORKS AND 
ORGANIZATIONS ARE AS OLD AS ISLAM ITSELF.  THE 
PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA WAS THE PRECURSOR OF THE FAX MACHINE 
AND CASSETTE TAPE.  AFRICAN MUSLIMS TODAY PUBLISH THEIR 
BOOKS IN ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND ARABIC, STUDY IN EGYPT, 
SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, MOROCCO AND LIBYA  AND ATTEND 
INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC CONFERENCES.  HUNWICH SAID THE 
ORGANIZATION OF THE ISLAMIC CONFERENCE, WHICH INCLUDES 
18 AFRICAN MEMBERS OUT OF 46, IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF 
THE PAN-ISLAMIC NETWORKS. 

18.  COMPETITION AMONG MIDDLE EASTERN STATES IN BLACK 
AFRICA WAS EXAMINED BY HUNWICK AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: 

--LIBYA:  QADHAFI HAS USED A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS TO 
GAIN INFLUENCE.  IN STATES WITH MUSLIM MINORITIES. HE 
HAS SOUGHT TO SUPPORT THOSE MINORITIES THROUGH THE 
OPENING OF ISLAMIC CULTURAL CENTERS AND THE DISPACH OF 
MUSLIM MISSIONARIES AND ARABIC TEACHERS.  IN STATES WITH 
SOCIALIST-ORIENTED REGIMES, SUCH AS BURKINA FASO, THE 
EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON THE IDEOLOGY OF THE \"GREEN BOOK.\" 
IN THE MUSLIM MAJORITY STATES OF THE SUDANIC BELT. HE 
HAS ALTERNATIVELY SUPPORTED AND ATTACKED REGIMES, 
INCLUDING THE SUDAN. 

--IRAN:  IRANIAN OBJECTIVES IN BLACK AFRICA ARE UNCLEAR, 
BUT THE ACADEMICS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT TEHRAN ASSIGNS A 
HIGH PRIORITY TO THE REGION.  THE WEAKNESS OF THE 
IRANIAN ECONOMY CURBS TEHRAN.S FOREIGN POLICY 
AMBITIONS.  IRAN\'S PRIMARY INFLUENCE IN AFRICA IS 
INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL, DRAWING ON THE MODEL OF AN 
ISLAMIC REVOLUTION WHICH HAS STOOD UP TO THE WEST AND 
SURVIVED. 

--SAUDI ARABIA:  THE SAUDIS HAVE SUPPORTED RELIGIOUS 
PROPAGANDA AND AID PROGRAMS, IN PART TO COUNTER THE 
INFLUENCE OF IRAN AND OTHER STATES. 

19.  MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES HAVE POURED CONSIDERABLE 
RESOURCES INTO AFRICA, FOR DEVELOPMENT, CULTURE, AND 
EDUCATION.  THE ACADEMICS AGREED THAT THE SECOND 
CATEGORY WILL BEAR THE MOST FRUIT IN THE LONG RUN.  VOLL 
WARNED THAT THE REAL THREAT OF POLITICAL ISLAM TO THE 
U.S. AND THE WEST IS CULTURAL.  AS WESTERN CULTURAL AID 
PROGRAMS, WHICH ONCE HAD A CRITICAL IMPACT ON AFRICAN 
YOUTH, ARE PARED BACK, ISLAMIC STATES ARE MOVING TO FILL 
THE GAP.

1.  CONFIDENTIAL- ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN REPORTS OF PRIVATE ARMENIAN 
SUPPORT FOR THE PKK. 
 
3.  THIS IS CAUSE OF CONCERN TO THE DEPARTMENT.  AS THE 
PKK IS A KNOWN TERRORIST GROUP, ANY TYPE OF ARMENIAN 
SUPPORT FOR THE PKK WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT INTERNATIONAL 
OPINION OF ARMENIA AND ARMENIAN CAUSES.  ARMENIAN CONTACTS 
WITH THE PKK WOULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FOR GOA 
RELATIONS WITH TURKEY.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE 
TURKISH PUBLIC WILL FAIL TO MAKE ANY DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
PRIVATE ARMENIAN EFFORTS TO HELP THE PKK AND OFFICIAL GOA 
BACKING OF THE PKK. 
 
4.  DEPARTMENT WOULD APPRECIATE AN EMBASSY REPORT ON 
POSSIBLE PKK-ARMENIAN LINKS, AND ASKS EMBASSY YEREVAN TO 
CONTINUE MONITORING THE SITUATION CLOSELY AND TO KEEP US 
INFORMED.  WE WANT TO WEIGH IN FIRMLY WITH YEREVAN IF 
THERE IS ANY EVIDENCE OF TRAINING, SANCTUARY OR EVIDENCE 
OF AID FOR THE PKK MATERIALIZING IN ARMENIA.  WE WILL OF 
COURSE, HOLD OFF MENTIONING THIS TO THE TURKS UNTIL WE 
HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE ARMENIANS. 
 
5.  ON A SEPARATE TOPIC, DEPARTMENT WOULD APPRECIATE 
EMBASSY\'S INSIGHTS ON PRESIDENT TER-PETROSYAN\'S ATTENDANCE 
OF ASALA MAMBER MONTE MELKONIAN\'S FUNERAL.  WHAT ARE THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF TER-PETROSYAN\'S PRESENCE?  IS ASALA 
REGARDED AS A LEGITIMATE ENTITY IN ARMENIA?  PRESIDENT 
TER-PETROSYAN\'S PRESENCE AT THE FUNERAL OF A KNOWN ASALA 
TERRORIST IS LIKELY TO INFLAME TURKISH PUBLIC OPINION AND 
COULD SERVE AS ANOTHER EXCUSE TO POSTPONE NORMALIZATION OF 
TURKISH-ARMENIAN RELATIONS.  WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY LIGHT 
EMBASSY CAN SHED ON TER-PETROSYAN\'S MOTIVATION IN 
ATTENDING THE FUNERAL, THE GOA VIEW OF DIASPORA ARMENIANS 
WITH TERRORIST CONNECTIONS, AND GOA ACTIONS, IF ANY, TO 
REASSURE THE TURKS ON THIS MATTER.

SUBJECT:  UN SECURITY COUNCIL SANCTIONS ON LIBYA 
 
REF: A) USUN 5745 (NOTAL), B) USUN 5922 (NOTAL) 

1.  (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST:  AS POSTS ARE AWARE, 
NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA CAME INTO FORCE AT 00:01 EST 
ON 1 DECEMBER 1993.  THESE MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO BRING 
TO JUSTICE THE PERPETRATORS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST 
PAN AM 103 AND UTA 772.  UNSC RESOLUTION 883 FREEZES 
CERTAIN LIBYAN ASSETS ON A WORLD-WIDE BASIS AND BANS THE 
PROVISION OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND 
TRANSPORTING OIL.  IT TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR 
EMBARGO AND OTHER MEASURES IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC 
RESOLUTION 748.  THE USG HAS MAINTAINED A COMPREHENSIVE 
FINANCIAL AND TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA SINCE 1986 AND 
IS ALREADY IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTION 883. 
IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED THE DEPARTMENT OF 
COMMERCE ON DECEMBER 3 TO BAN THE REEXPORT FROM FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF U.S.-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY THE 
RESOLUTION.  ALL EMBASSIES ARE REQUESTED TO URGE HOST 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE UNSC-MANDATED 
SANCTIONS.  POSTS SHOULD ALSO REPORT ON HOST GOVERNMENT 
SANCTIONS IMPLEMENTATION AND ANY INFORMATION RELATING TO 
POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS OF THE SANCTIONS.  TEXT OF UNSC 
RESOLUTION 883 FOLLOWS IN PARA 6.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION 
REQUEST. 

------------ 
UN SANCTIONS 
------------ 

2.  (U) UNSC RESOLUTION 883 FREEZES ASSETS OWNED OR 
CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBYA ON A WORLD-WIDE 
BASIS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1.  THIS IS A ONE-TIME \"SNAP 
SHOT\" FREEZE.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALES OF LIBYAN 
PETROLEUM AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS EXPORTED FROM LIBYA 
AFTER DECEMBER 1 ARE EXEMPT FROM THE FREEZE, PROVIDED THEY 
ARE DEPOSITED IN SPECIAL ACCOUNTS AND SEGREGATED FROM 
ASSETS SUBJECT TO THE FREEZE.  THE USG INTENDS TO WORK 
AGGRESSIVELY TO IDENTIFY AND BLOCK NON-EXEMPT LIBYAN 
ASSETS WHEREVER THEY MAY BE FOUND. 

3.  (U) UNSC RESOLUTION 883 ALSO BANS THE PROVISION TO 
LIBYA OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND TRANSPORTING 
OIL.  IT TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR EMBARGO AND OTHER 
MEASURES IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC RESOLUTION 748.  UNSC 
RESOLUTION 883 IS THE RESULT OF CLOSE COOPERATION BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES, FRANCE AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHOSE 
CITIZENS WERE THE PRINCIPAL VICTIMS OF LIBYAN-SPONSORED 
TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST PAN AM 103 AND UTA 772, AND 
CONSULTATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND OTHER FRIENDS AND ALLIES. 

----------------------- 
US UNILATERAL SANCTIONS 
----------------------- 

4.  (U) THE US IS ALREADY IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW 
SANCTIONS CONTAINED IN UNSCR 883.  THE US HAS MAINTAINED A 
COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AND TRADE EMBARGO AGAINST LIBYA 
SINCE JANUARY 1986.  ON DECEMBER 3 PRESIDENT CLINTON 
EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR THIS COMPREHENSIVE EMBARGO. 
UNDER THE US EMBARGO, ALL LIBYAN ASSETS SUBJECT TO US 
JURISDICTION -- NEARLY USD ONE BILLION -- ARE FROZEN.  ALL 
TRADE WITH LIBYA ISANNED.  IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT 
INSTRUCTED THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE ON DECEMBER 3 TO 
PROHIBIT REEXPORTS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF 
US-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY THE NEW RESOLUTION\' 
INCLUDING PETROLEUM REFINING AND TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT. 

------------------------------- 

DEMARCHE ON ENFORCING SANCTIONS 
------------------------------- 

5.  (U) EMBASSIES SHOULD CALL UPON APPROPRIATELY SENIOR 
HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO UNDERSCORE OUR INTEREST IN 
EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND ENCOURAGE STRICT ENFORCEMENT 
OF THE UNSC SANCTIONS. 

BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 

-- WE CONTINUE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS BY THE UNITED 
NATIONS TO BRING TO JUSTICE THE PERPETRATORS OF THE 
LIBYAN-SPONSORED TERRORIST ATTACKS ON PAN AM FLIGHT 103 
AND UTA FLIGHT 772. 

-- IN UNSC RESOLUTIONS 731 AND 748\' THE UN HAS REPEATEDLY 
DEMANDED THAT LIBYA COOPERATE WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF 
THESE TERRORIST ATTACKS, ENSURE THE APPEARANCE IN COURT OF 
THE PERPETRATORS, RENOUNCE SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, AND COMPENSATE THE VICTIMS OF LIBYAN TERRORISM. 

-- ONCE AGAIN LIBYA HAS FAILED TO MEET A UN DEADLINE.  UN 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 883 SIGNALS THAT LIBYA CANNOT 
CONTINUE TO DEFY JUSTICE AND FLOUT THE DEMANDS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH IMPUNITY. 

-- THE SANCTIONS MEASURES CONTAINED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 883 
ARE DESIGNED TO PUNISH THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT, NOT THE 
LIBYAN PEOPLE.  THESE MEASURES CAME INTO EFFECT DECEMBER 
1.  THEY REQUIRE STATES TO FREEZE CERTAIN LIBYAN ASSETS 
AND BAN THE PROVISION TO LIBYA OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT FOR 
REFINING AND TRANSPORTING OIL.  UNSC RESOLUTION 883 ALSO 
TIGHTENS THE INTERNATIONAL AIR EMBARGO AND OTHER MEASURES 
IMPOSED IN 1992 UNDER UNSC RESOLUTION 748. 

-- THESE MEASURES MAY BE SUSPENDED IF LIBYA ENSURES THE 
APPEARANCE OF THOSE CHARGED WITH THE BOMBING OF PAN AM 103 
FOR TRIAL BEFORE THE APPROPRIATE UK OR US COURT AND 
SATISFIES FRENCH JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE 
BOMBING OF UTA 772. 

-- THE US HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE UN SANCTIONS MEASURES 
FOR LIBYA.  US BILATERAL SANCTIONS AGAINST LIBYA IN FORCE 
SINCE 1986 FREEZE ALL LIBYAN ASSETS SUBJECT TO US 
JURISDICTION AND BAN ALL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND 
TRADE.  IN ADDITION, THE PRESIDENT ORDERED ON DECEMBER 3 A 
N ON THE REEXPORT FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO LIBYA OF 
US-ORIGIN PRODUCTS COVERED BY UNSC RESOLUTION 883, 

INCLUDING EQUIPMENT FOR REFINING AND TRANSPORTING OIL. 

-- UNSC 883 EMBODIES THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S 
COMMITMENT TO CURB INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  WE CALL UPON 
ALL OTHER COUNTRIES TO MEET THEIR COMMITMENTS TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ACTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE 
SANCTIONS MEASURES CONTAINED IN UNSC RESOLUTION 883. 

-- THE LIBYA SANCTIONS COMMITTEE IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE 
GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF UNSC RESOLUTION 883.  THE 
USG WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM YOUR 
GOVERNMENT CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOLUTION. 
HOWEVER, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION HAS ALREADY 
BEGUN AND ACTION SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR AN ANSWER FROM THE 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE OR THE USG. 

-- UNSC RESOLUTION 883 REQUIRES MEMBER STATES TO REPORT TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL BY JANUARY 15 ON NATIONAL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RESOLUTION.  WE BELIEVE THE DEGREE 
OF EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF 
MEMBERS\' DETERMINATION TO COMBAT TERRORISM AND RESPECT UN 
OBLIGATIONS.

6.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF UNSC RESOLUTION 883: 

RESOLUTION 883 (1993) 
ADOPTED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL AT ITS 3312TH MEETING, ON 
11 NOVEMBER 1993 

THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 

REAFFIRMING ITS RESOLUTIONS 731 (1992) OF 21 JANUARY 1992 
AND 748 (1992) OF 31 MARCH 1992, 

DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT AFTER MORE THAN TWENTY MONTHS THE 
LIBYAN GOVERNMENT HAS NOT FULLY COMPLIED WITH THESE 
RESOLUTIONS, 

DETERMINED TO ELIMINATE INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 

CONVINCED THAT THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM MUST BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, 

CONVINCED THAT THE SUPPRESSION OF ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, INCLUDING THOSE IN WHICH STATES ARE DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY INVOLVED, IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF 
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY 

DETERMINING, IN TNIS CONTEXT, THAT THE CONTINUED FAILURE 
BY THE LIBYAN GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE BY CONCRETE 
ACTIONS ITS RENUNCIATION OF TERRORISM, AND IN PARTICULAR 
ITS CONTINUED FAILURE TO RESPOND FULLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO 
THE REQUESTS AND DECISIONS IN RESOLUTIONS 731 (1992) AND 
748 (1992), 
 
CONSTITUTE A THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND 
SECURITY, 

TAKING NOTE OF THE LETTERS TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL DATED 
29 SEPTEMBER AND 1 OCTOBER 1993 FROM THE SECRETARY OF THE 
GENERAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE FOR FOREIGN LIAISON AND 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION OF LIBYA (S/26523) AND HIS 
SPEECH IN THE GENERAL DEBATE AT THE FORTY-EIGHTH SESSION 
OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY (A/48/PV.20) IN WHICH LIBYA STATED 
ITS INTENTION TO ENCOURAGE THOSE CHARGED WITH THE BOMBING

WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE WITH THE COMPETENT FRENCH 
AUTHORITIES IN THE CASE OF THE BOMBING OF UTA 772,

SUBJECT:  WHITE PAPER ON LIBYA\'S CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM 
 
REF: BANGKOK 42119 

1.  (S)  PRESENTED BELOW IN PARA 2 IS AN INTERAGENCY 
COORDINATED \"WHITE PAPER\" ON LIBYA\'S CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) 
PROGRAM.  THIS PAPER IS UNCLASSIFIED AND IS TO BE PROVIDED 
TO THE ROYAL THAI GOVERNMENT FOR ITS USE.  THE PAPER CAN 
BE USED BY THE THAIS IN HELPING TO PREPARE THE CASES 
AGAINST THE THREE THAI FIRMS FOR ASSISTING THE LIBYAN CW 
PROGRAM.  NO OTHER PAPERS ARE PLANNED TO BE GIVEN TO THE 
RTG.  ALTHOUGH, IF A SPECIFIC LEGAL QUESTION ARISES AFTER 
THE THAIS DETERMINE WHICH LAWS OR REGULATIONS THEY PLAN TO 
CHARGE THE FIRMS UNDER, IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. 

2.  (U)  BEGIN TEXT OF WHITE PAPER ON LIBYA\'S CW PROGRAM 
RELEASABLE TO RTG: 

-    LIBYA IS EXPANDING ITS CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM 
 
THERE IS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT LIBYA IS ENGAGED IN 
CONSTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS PRODUCTION FACILITIES AT 
THE TARHUNAH SITE.  MOREOVER, THIS EVIDENCE IS IN THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN, HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY ACTION OF THE UN 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE, AND HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY OTHER 
COMPANIES THAT FORMERLY HAD SUPPLIED THE PROJECT.  IT IS 
NOT CREDIBLE THAT THAI FIRMS PARTICIPATING IN THIS 
CONSTRUCTION ARE  UNAWARE OF THE TRUE NATURE OF THIS 
FACILITY UNLESS THEY HAVE IMPERMISSIBLY \"BURIED THEIR 
HEADS IN THE SAND.\" 

LIBYA SHOWS TREMENDOUS RESOLVE IN MOVING ITS OVERALL 
CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) PROGRAM FORWARD.  DESPITE 
INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION AND POLITICAL PRESSURE 
TRIPOLI\'S PURSUIT OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS IS BARELY 
DISGUISED.  TRIPOLI\'S ONGOING CW ACTIVITIES AND ITS 
REFUSAL IN JANUARY 1993 TO JOIN A GLOBAL CHEMICAL WEAPONS 
CONVENTION (CWC) SIGNED BY MORE THAN 150 OTHER NATIONS 
UNDERLINE THE JUDGMENT OF MANY GOVERNMENTS THAT LIBYA HAS 
NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP ITS CHEMICAL WARFARE PROGRAM. 

LIBYA HAS CHEMICAL FACILITIES AT RABTA AND TARHUNAH 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 

LIBYA HAS PRODUCED AT LEAST 100 TONS OF CW AGENTS  MOSTLY 
THE BLISTER AGENT MUSTARD AND SMALLER AMOUNTS OF THE NERVE 
AGENT SARIN. 

-   LIBYA HAS A CW AGENT PRODUCTION FACILITY AT RABTA 
ALTHOUGH THAT FACILITY CURRENTLY IS INACTIVE.  THE MAXIMUM 
PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR RABTA IS 40 TONS OF CW AGENT 
DAILY, AND THE PLANT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE THE BLISTER 
AGENT MUSTARD AND HIGHLY LETHAL NERVE AGENTS.  FACILITIES 
AT THE RABTA COMPLEX INCLUDE A METAL FABRICATION AREA FOR 
MAKING MISSILE WARHEADS, BOMBS, AND ARTILLERY SHELLS FOR 
CHEMICAL WARFARE PURPOSES.  THE RABTA COMPLEX WAS BUILT 
WITH ASSISTANCE FROM TECHNICIANS, ENGINEERS. AND LABORERS 
FROM SEVERAL COUNTRIES. INCLUDING WEST GERMANY. JAPAN AND 
THAILAND. 

-   SINCE 1990, TRIPOLI HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO A NEW 
PROJECT--CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD\'S LARGEST KNOWN 
UNDERGROUND CW PLANT, DEEP IN AN INTERIOR MOUNTAIN NEAR 
TARHUNAH ABOUT 60 KM SOUTHEAST OF TRIPOLI.  EXCAVATION AT 
TARHUNAH, WHICH BEGAN IN 1992  IS GOING FORWARD AND 
ASSEMBLY OF THE PLANT WILL BE COMPLETE WITHIN THE DECADE. 
THE INTERIOR PLANS AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UNDERGROUND 
PLANT. PUBLISHED IN THE MAGAZINE \"THE ECONOMIST\"\'S 
\"FOREIGN REPORT\'\" INDICATE THAT THE TARHUNAH PLANT IS A 
RECONFIGURED VERSION OF THE RABTA FACILITY.  THE SAME 
LIBYAN PURCHASING OFFICERS INVOLVED WITH THE RABTA PLANT 
ARE NOW WORKING ON DUPLICATING EQUIPMENT ORDERS FROM THOSE 
DESIGNS FOR USE AT TARHUNAH. 

UNITED NATIONS SANCTIONS COMMITTEE ACKNOWLEDGE TARHUNAH\'S 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
CW LINK 
------- 

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. THROUGH UN SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTION 748. PASSED ON MARCH 31, 1992, HAS SOUGHT TO 
ISOLATE LIBYA AND CEASE ITS TERRORIST ACTIVITIES--IN PART 
THOUGH A BAN ON MILITARY SALES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO 
LIBYA.  INCLUDED IN THIS BAN IS THE TRANSFER OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS-RELATED MATERIAL AND ACTIVITIES. 

-   THE UN IN RESOLUTION 748 ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT LIBYA IS 
CONSIDERED AN OUTLAW STATE THROUGH VARIOUS OTHER DEMANDS. 
UN MEMBER STATES ARE REQUIRED TO REDUCE LIBYAN DIPLOMATIC 
MISSIONS AND TO DRAW DOWN THEIR OWN REPRESENTATION TO 
LIBYA.  THE RESOLUTION ALSO TERMINATED INTERNATIONAL AIR 
SERVICE TO AND FROM LIBYA. 

BARRING SHIPMENT TO LIBYA:  IN MARCH 1993  THE UN. 
INVOKING THESE SANCTIONS, BARRED A SHIPMENT OF CHEMICAL 
PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT--REACTOR VESSELS--DESTINED FOR 
LIBYA\'S CW PROGRAM.  LIBYA HAD CLAIMED IT WAS PURCHASING 
THE EQUIPMENT FOR STRICTLY COMMERCIAL USE--TO MAKE 
DRILLING MUD ADDITIVES FOR OIL EXPLORATION.  THE EQUIPMENT 
WAS PRODUCED BY THE MALAYSIAN SUBSIDIARY OF A BRITISH 
FIRM.  SINGAPORE HALTED TRANSSHIPMENT OF THE REACTOR 
VESSELS TO A LIBYAN FACTORY IN BENGHAZI PENDING A UN 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE DETERMINATION.  AFTER THE SANCTIONS 
COMMITTEE FOUND THAT THE SHIPMENT WAS IN VIOLATION OF 
RESOLUTION 748, SINGAPORE REFUSED TO ALLOW THEM TO BE 
SHIPPED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED THEM TO THE MALAYSIAN 
SHIPPER WHERE THEY REMAIN UNDER MALAYSIAN CUSTOMS CONTROL 
PENDING SALE TO A LEGITIMATE BUYER. 

GERMAN COMPANIES CEASED SUPPLYING TARHUNAH 
------------------------------------------ 

THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING GERMAN 
FIRMS FOR DELIVERING EQUIPMENT AND CHEMICALS FOR THE 
TARHUNAH PLAN VIA THIRD COUNTRIES TO AVOID SUSPICION. 
CHANCELLOR HELMUT KOHL\'S OFFICE CONFIRMED TO THE PRESS IN 
MID-FEBRUARY 1993 THAT HIS GOVERNMENT HAD RECEIVED 
INFORMATION THAT GERMAN FIRMS WERE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING 
MATERIAL FOR LIBYA\'S CLANDESTINE CW PROJECT.  AT LEAST TWO 
IMPLICATED FIRMS IMMEDIATELY AGREED TO BONN\'S DEMANDS TO 
STOP ANY FURTHER DELIVERIES, THE SPOKESMAN SAID. 

GERMAN PROSECUTION OF CASES AGAINST FIRMS DEALING WITH 
LIBYAN CW PROGRAMS DATES BACK TO 1990.  INITIALLY, THE 
WEST GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER SAID THAT INFORMATION ABOUT 
THE RABTA PLANT WAS TOO VAGUE FOR BONN TO PURSUE COMPANIES 
INVOLVED.  ALTHOUGH THE BONN GOVERNMENT AT FIRST STRONGLY 
DENIED ALLEGATIONS THAT GERMAN FIRMS HAD SUPPLIED AND 
BUILT A CW FACTORY IN LIBYA, AFTER EXTENSIVE 
INVESTIGATIONS IT FOUND THE CHARGES WERE TRUE.  THE GERMAN 
FIRM IMHAUSEN-CHEMIE STATED IN COURT THAT RABTA IS A 
POISON GAS PLANT, AND THE FIRM\'S OWNER WAS SUBSEQUENTLY 
SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON FOR VIOLATION OF EXPORT 
CONTROL LAWS. 

THAI NATIONALS ARE INVOLVED 
--------------------------- 

THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT CONCLUDED THAT A THAI BUSINESSMAN 
WITH AN ENGINEERING DEGREE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN BUILDING 
THE RABTA PLANT PROVIDED CRITICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE 
TARHUNAH PLANT, AS INDICATED IN A GERMAN NEWSPAPER.  THE 
THAI EXPERT COPIED THE PLANS FOR THE RABTA FACILITY, 
ALTERED THEM, AND THEN CONTACTED GERMAN COMPANIES FOR 
ASSISTANCE IN BUILDING AND EQUIPPING THE FACILITIES.  THAI 
COMPANIES HAD TAKEN OVER CW PROJECTS IN LIBYA AFTER GERMAN 
AND JAPANESE CONTRACTORS WERE FORCED TO WITHDRAW IN THE 
1980S UNDER PRESSURE FROM THEIR GOVERNMENTS, ACCORDING TO 
A PRESS REPORT IN \"THE NEW TIMES.\" 

THE THAI FIRM W AND M LIMITED PARTNERSHIP HAS ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT IT IS THE SOLE SOURCE FOR TUNNELING DESIGN AND 
EXCAVATION WORK AT THE TARHUNAH SITE.  WIROTE 
SUKUNMUTHITA, OF W AND M, TOLD THE PRESS THAT HIS COMPANY 
WAS HIRED THREE YEARS AGO TO DESIGN THE TUNNELS.  HE ALSO 
SAID THAT ABOUT 60 THAI WORKERS, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF 
ENGINEERS, WERE ASSIGNED TO THE TARHUNAH PROJECT. 

LIBYA\'S DENIALS ARE NOT CREDIBLE 
-------------------------------- 

COL. MU\'AMMAR QADHAFI CONTINUES TO DENY THAT LIBYA 
POSSESSES A CW PROGRAM AND THAT HE IS BUILDING AN 
UNDERGROUND CW PLANT AT TARHUNAH.  LIBYA STILL INSISTS 
THAT THE CW PLANT AT RABTA WAS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE ONLY 
PHARMACEUTICALS AND THAT TARHUNAH IS A CIVILIAN PROJECT. 
WHILE CONTINUING EXCAVATION, LIBYA HAS STRIVED TO PROVIDE 
A SEEMINGLY PLAUSIBLE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION FOR THE 
INTENSIVE TUNNELING ACTIVITY THAT BEGAN IN 1992. 

THE LIBYAN DENIALS ABOUT TARHUNAH, HOWEVER, ARE 
REMINISCENT OF TRIPOLI\'S PAST ATTEMPTS TO CONCEAL THE TRUE 
CW NATURE OF THE \"RABIA PHARMACEUTICAL FACTORY.   TRIPOLI 
CLAIMS TARHUNAH IS A TUNNEL EXCAVATION TRAINING SITE FOR 
LIBYAN WORKERS ON THE MUCH PUBLICIZED CIVILIAN \"GREAT 
MANMADE RIVER PROJECT,\" WHICH IS NOT IN THE IMMEDIATE 
VICINITY.  IN FEBRUARY 1993, LIBYAN TELEVISION AIRED A 
STAGED VISIT BY QADHAFI TO THE TUNNELS, AND THE LIBYAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS INVITED THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL 
MEDIA TO TOUR THE EXCAVATION.  THE LIBYANS PROBABLY 
ANTICIPATED THAT INSPECTORS WOULD BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY 
THE FACILITY AS CW-RELATED BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE EARLY 
STAGES OF CONSTRUCTION AND NO PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT IS YET 
PRESENT. 

TRIPOLI HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN MANIPULATING 
INTERNATIONAL OPINION, WHILE CONSTRUCTING AND RUNNING A CW 
FACILITY.  DURING THE 1980S, LIBYA CLANDESTINELY 
ESTABLISHED A GLOBAL PROCUREMENT NETWORK TO OBTAIN 
MATERIALS TO BUILD THE RABTA CW PLANT.  THERE WAS A 
CONNECTION BETWEEN A BELGIAN SHIPPING FIRM AND WEST GERMAN 
CHEMICAL MANUFACTURES.

SUBJECT:  PKK AND \"INSURGENCY\" 
 
REF: ANKARA 0285 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  THE PKK DOES NOT BECOME ENTITLED TO ANY OF 
THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS\' BENEFITS BY THE U.S. USE OF THE 
TERM \"INSURGENCY.\"  THE 1949 GENEVA CONVENTIONS DID 
NOT/NOT CHANGE THE CUSTOMARY AND CONVENTIONAL LAWS OF WAR 
REGARDING \"INSURGENCY,\" AND, THEREFORE, CHARACTERIZING THE 
PKK.S ACTIVITY AS A \"SEPARATIST INSURGENCY\" DOES NOT/NOT 
IMPLY THAT THE PKK ENJOYS A RECOGNIZED LEGAL STATUS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  MOST OF THE POINTS BELOW ARE DRAWN FROM A 1988 LEGAL 
MEMORANDUM SUBMITTED BY THE USG TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK IN THE CASE OF U.S. 
V. SHAKUR.  EMBASSY MAY PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN 
RESPONSE TO AMBASSADOR TURMEN.S COMMENTS (REFTEL). 
 
4.  BEGIN POINTS: 
 
-  SOME STATES RECOGNIZE A CATEGORY OF \"INSURGENCY\" BUT 
ONLY FOR DOMESTIC POLITICAL OR LEGAL REASONS, IN ORDER TO 
AVOID TREATING SOME REBELS AS MERE LAWBREAKERS.  SUCH A 
PRACTICE, HOWEVER, IS SPORADIC AND, IN ANY EVENT\' NOT A 
MATTER OF INTERNATIONAL LAW. 
 
-  THE CUSTOMARY LAW OF WAR THAT EXISTED BEFORE ADOPTION 
OF THE FOUR GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 DID NOT PURPORT TO 
REGULATE CIVIL WARS EXCEPT IN VERY NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES. 
UNDER THAT LAW, CERTAIN INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS COULD 
BECOME INTERNATIONAL ARMED CONFLICTS FOR PURPOSES OF THE 
LAWS OF WAR IF A STATE OF \"BELLIGERENCY\" WAS RECOGNIZED BY 
STATES. 
 
-  IN TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY, AN \"INSURGENCY\" WAS A REBEL 
MOVEMENT NOT ENTITLED TO PROTECTION UNDER THE LAWS OF 
WAR.  \"BELLIGERENCY\" WAS A CONDITION THAT RESEMBLED AN 
ARMED CONFLICT BETWEEN STATES, WITH EACH PARTY 
ADMINISTERING TERRITORY  ETC. (SEE BELOW).  BELLIGERENCY 
WAS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF WAR WHICH REGULATED CONFLICTS 
BETWEEN STATES. 
 
-  THE TERM \"INSURGENCY\" APFLIED TO CONFLICTS LACKING THE 
FEATURES OF INTERSTATE CONFLICT.  USE OF THE TERM HAS 
NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED AS CONFERRING STATUS ON THE 
PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE LAWS OF WAR. 
 
-  BELLIGERENCY EXISTED ONLY IF CERTAIN FACTUAL CONDITIONS 
WERE PRESENT:  \"... THE EXISTENCE OF A CIVIL WAR 
ACCOMPANIED BY A STATE OF GENERAL HOSTILITIES; OCCUPATION 
AND A MEASURE OF ORDERLY ADMINISTRATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL 
PART OF NATIONAL TERRITORY BY THE INSURGENTS; OBSERVANCE 
OF THE RULES OF WARFARE ON THE PART OF THE INSURGENT 
FORCES ACTING UNDER A RESPONSIBLE AUTHORITY; THE PRACTICAL 
NECESSITY FOR THIRD STATES TO DEFINE THEIR ATTITUDE TO THE 
CIVIL WAR.\" 
 
-  THIS TRADITIONAL TERMINOLOGY HAS FALLEN INTO DISUSE IN 
FAVOR OF THE TERMINOLOGY AND CONCEPTS USED IN THE FOUR 
GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF 1949 AND IN THEIR 1977 PROTOCOLS. 
 
-  BECAUSE OF THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF CIVIL WARS\' 
THE STATES THAT MET IN GENEVA IN 1949 DECIDED TO ADOPT 
COMMON ARTICLE 3 TO GOVERN \"ARMED CONFLICT NOT OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER.\"  ARTICLE 3 PROVIDES A GENERAL 
REQUIREMENT THAT PERSONS NOT TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN 
HOSTILITIES BE TREATED HUMANELY, AND IT SPECIFICALLY 
PROHIBITS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MURDER, TORTURE, 
HOSTAGE-TAKING AND HUMILIATING AND DEGRADING TREATMENT. 
HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT GRANT REBELS THE BENEFITS OF 
PRISONER-OF-WAR STATUS AND THUS IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION 
UNDER LOCAL LAW FOR LEGITIMATE COMBATANT ACTS.  THUS. A 
REBEL IN A CIVIL WAR MAY BE PROSECUTED FOR MURDER IF HE 
KILLS A MEMBER OF THE REGULAR FORCES OF A STATE. 
 
-  IN ANY EVENT, APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 3 DOES NOT DEPEND 
ON WHETHER OR NOT AN \"INSURGENCY\" IS INVOLVED. 
 
-  AFTER THE CONVENTIONS WERE ADOPTED, SOME ARGUED THAT 
INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS COULD BECOME \"INTERNATIONAL\" 
ARMED CONFLICT IF \"BELLIGERENCY\" WERE RECOGNIZED BY 
STATES.  IT IS CLEAR FROM THE PRACTICE OF STATES DURING 
THE PAST FOUR DECADES, HOWEVER, THAT STATES HAVE NOT 
ACCEPTED THIS THEORY UNDER THE CONVENTIONS. 
 
-  THE 1977 PROTOCOLS TO THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS CLASSIFY 
SOME INTERNAL ARMED CONFLICTS AS INTERNATIONAL AND THUS 
COVERED BY THE CONVENTIONS.  THIS WAS LARGELY MOTIVATED BY 
THE DESIRE OF THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES (ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT 
HAD FOUGHT COLONIAL WARS) TO OBTAIN PRISONER-OF-WAR RIGHTS 
FOR THOSE WHO WERE FIGHTING IN SO-CALLED WARS OF NATIONAL 
LIBERATION.  THEY SOUGHT TO CLASSIFY SUCH CONFLICTS AS 
INTERNATIONAL FOR PURPOSES OF THE LAWS OF WAR, IN LARGE 
PART BECAUSE OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE RIGID BUT 
SENSIBLE STANDARDS OF THE 1949 GENEVA PRISONERS OF WAR 
CONVENTION. 
 
-  PROTOCOL I\' AS IT FINALLY EMERGED, PROVIDES IN ARTICLE 
1 THAT SUCH CONFLICTS SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE 
INTERNATIONAL.  THIS WAS A MAJOR REASON FOR THE U.S. 
REJECTION OF THE PROTOCOL.  TURKEY ALSO HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS 
WITH ARTICLE 1 DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS OF THAT PROTOCOL. 
NEITHER THE UNITED STATES NOR TURKEY IS A PARTY TO 
PROTOCOL I. 
 
-  NONETHELESS, THE TERM \"INSURGENCY\" DOES NOT APPEAR IN 
THE 1977 PROTOCOLS.  THE FACT THAT A GROUP IS 
CHARACTERIZED AS AN INSURGENCY WOULD NOT AFFECT ITS 
MEMBERS\' STATUS UNDER THE PROTOCOLS. 
 
-  THUS. UNDER THE CUSTOMARY LAWS OF WAR, THE 1949 GENEVA 
CONVENTIONS AND THE 1977 PROTOCOLS\' USE OF THE TERM 
\"INSURGENCY\" TO DESCRIBE THE PKK.S ACTIVITY DOES NOT IMPLY 
OR CONVEY ANY RIGHTS OR BENEFITS ON THE PKK.  THEREFORE, 
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE UNITED STATES NOT TO USE THE 
TERM SINCE, ACCORDING TO THE DICTIONARY, \"INSURGENCY\" 
ACCURATELY DESCRIBES THE PKK\'S ACTIVITY. 
 
END POINTS.

2.  (C) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUESTED: USNS KANE IS 
CONDUCTING UNCLASSIFIED MILITARY SURVEY OPERATIONS, NOT 
MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR), IN THE EEZS OF VARIOUS 
BALTIC STATES INCLUDING SWEDEN.  KANE IS MEASURING 
CURRENTS AND BOTTOM PROFILES, AND COLLECTING WATER AND 
BOTTOM SAMPLES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS FOR MILITARY 
PURPOSES.  MILITARY SURVEYS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COASTAL 
STATE CONTROL.  KANE WILL RETURN TO THE SWEDISH EEZ TO 
CONTINUE ITS SURVEY ON OR ABOUT APRIL 16.  DRAWING ON THE 
TALKING POINTS IN PARAGRAPH 5, EMBASSY MAY DELIVER TO 
APPROPRIATE GOS OFFICIALS THE PAPER IN PARAGRAPH 6 WHICH 
PROVIDES A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE LEGAL DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN SURVEYS AND MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR)  AND 
WORLDWIDE USG POLICY AND PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY 
SURVEYS.  END SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. 
 
3. (C) DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES EMBASSY\'S VIGOROUS AND 
ARTICULATE REACTIONS AND THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THE 
SITUATION REPORTED REFTELS (A) AND (B) REGARDING THE 
UNEXPECTED SWEDISH REACTION TO USNS KANE\'S SURVEY 
ACTIVITIES IN ITS EEZ (REFTEL (C)).  WE HAVE PREPARED A 
DETAILED LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION WHICH IS SET OUT 
IN THE PAPER IN PARAGRAPH 6 THAT MAY BE SHARED WITH 
APPROPRIATE GOS OFFICIALS. 
 
4.  (C) USNS KANE IS SCHEDULED TO COMPLETE ITS PORT VISIT 
IN DENMARK ON 8 APRIL 1994 AND TO ENTER THE WESTERN WATERS 
OF THE SWEDISH EEZ TO CONTINUE MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES 
ON OR ABOUT 16 APRIL.  KANE WILL MEASURE CURRENTS AND 
BOTTOM PROFILES, AND WILL COLLECT WATER AND BOTTOM 
SAMPLES, INCLUDING CORES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS FOR 
MILITARY PURPOSES.  IF CHALLENGED DURING THESE ACTIVITIES, 
KANE HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO RESPOND (QUOTE) I AM CONDUCTING 
MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL 
LAW AS REFLECTED IN THE 1982 LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION. 
(UNQUOTE) 
 
5.  (C) BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU A PAPER THAT DESCRIBES THE 
U.S. POSITION ON SURVEY ACTIVITIES IN EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC 
ZONES (EEZ). 
 
-- THIS PAPER DETAILS WHY THE ACTIVITIES OF THE USNS KANE, 
A U.S. NAVAL AUXILIARY, IN YOUR EEZ OVER THE PAST WEEK ARE 
FULLY CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF SWEDISH LAW. 
 
-- WE AGREE THAT A COASTAL STATE MAY REQUIRE ANYONE 
SEEKING TO CONDUCT MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR) IN THE 
COASTAL STATE\'S EEZ OBTAIN APPROVAL IN ADVANCE.  HOWEVER, 
AS THIS PAPER MAKES CLEAR, THE KANE\'S MILITARY SURVEY 
ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MSR. 
 
-- THE MISSION OF THE USNS KANE IN THE SWEDISH EEZ IS TO 
MEASURE CURRENT AND BOTTOM PROFILES, AND TO COLLECT WATER 
AND BOTTOM SAMPLES, INCLUDING CORES, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS 
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES. 
 
-- THE PURPOSE OF THIS MILITARY SURVEY IS TO SUPPORT 
SECURITY IN THE BALTIC SEA, AN ISSUE ON WHICH THE U.S. AND 
SWEDEN SHARE A COMMON CONCERN. 
 
-- SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES AND AS 
SUCH CAN BE UNDERTAKEN IN THE EEZ OF A COASTAL NATION 
WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION OR APPROVAL BY THE NATION. 
 
-- WE WANT TO REACH A SHARED UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU ON 
THIS ISSUE.  HOWEVER, WE MUST EMPHASIZE THAT OUR MILITARY 
SURVEY OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED CONSISTENT WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARE CONDUCTED WORLDWIDE ON THAT 
BASIS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EEZ SURVEY OPERATIONS, 
INCLUDING THAT OF THE KANE, ACCORDINGLY. 
 
-- WE HOPE THAT THIS PAPER PROVIDES YOU WITH THE LEGAL 
FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCEPT OUR POSITION.  WE ARE 
AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THIS FURTHER WITH YOU IF YOU WISH. 
 
IF ASKED WHETHER THE USG IS WILLING TO SHARE THE DATA 
COLLECTED, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT THE USG DOES NOT SHARE 
DATA COLLECTED ON A MILITARY SURVEY AS A CONDITION OF 
ENTRY INTO THE EEZ.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE ESTABLISHED 
MECHANISMS FOR DATA EXCHANGES BETWEEN OUR TWO 
GOVERNMENTS.  (FYI: EMBASSY MUST AVOID IMPLYING ANY USG 
COMMITMENT TO SHARE THE DATA COLLECTED IN THIS SURVEY BY 
THE KANE.  END FYI) 
 
IF ASKED WHETHER THE KANE PLANS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN 
THE EEZ OFF SWEDEN\'S WESTERN COAST, YOU SHOULD RESPOND 
THAT THE KANE WILL CONTINUE ITS MILITARY SURVEY OPERATIONS 
WITHIN THE SWEDISH WESTERN EEZ NEXT WEEK. 
 
IF PRESSED TO SEND THE KANE BACK INTO THE EEZ TO RECOVER 
THE CURRENT METERS, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT THE KANE WILL 
RETRIEVE THEM WITHIN 30 DAYS.  YOU SHOULD STATE THESE 
CURRENT METERS ARE NOT PERMANENTLY FIXED MONITORING 
FACILITIES, AS ALLEGED BY GOS OFFICIALS, BUT ARE METERS 
THAT ARE COLLECTING DATA ON BALTIC CURRENTS AND WILL BE 
RETRIEVED TO OBTAIN THE DATA COLLECTED. 
 
IF PRESSED THAT CORING IS MSR, YOU SHOULD RESPOND THAT 
CORING ACTIVITIES FOR RESEARCH ARE MSR, BUT CORING 
ACTIVITIES FOR MILITARY PURPOSES CONSTITUTE A MILITARY 
SURVEY ACTIVITY.  YOU MAY EXPLAIN THAT, WHILE THE MEANS OF 
DATA COLLECTION USED IN MILITARY SURVEYS MAY SOMETIMES BE 
THE SAME AS THAT USED IN MSR, INFORMATION FROM SUCH 
ACTIVITIES, REGARDLESS OF SECURITY CLASSIFICATION, IS 
INTENDED NOT FOR USE BY THE GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, 
BUT BY THE MILITARY.  END TALKING POINTS.

    SURVEY ACTIVITIES IN THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THE RIGHT OF SWEDEN TO 
REQUIRE PRIOR PERMISSION FOR FOREIGN SHIPS TO CONDUCT 
MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MSR) IN ITS EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC 
ZONE (EEZ).  THE UNITED STATES IS PLEASED TO PROVIDE THE 
FOLLOWING EXPLANATION WHY HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS AND 
MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES ARE NOT MSR AND DO NOT REQUIRE 
PRIOR NOTIFICATION TO OR THE PERMISSION OF THE COASTAL 
STATE BEFORE OTHER STATES MAY CONDUCT SUCH SURVEYS IN THE 
EEZ. 
 
THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION 
------,---------------------- 
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW, AS REFLECTED IN THE 1982 UNITED NATIONS 
CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA (LOS CONVENTION), 
AUTHORIZES COASTAL STATES TO CLAIM LIMITED RIGHTS AND 
JURISDICTION IN AN EEZ.  THE JURISDICTIONAL RIGHTS RELATE 
PRIMARILY TO THE EXPLORATION, EXPLOITATION, AND 
CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES, MSR, AND THE MARINE 
ENVIRONMENT.  BEYOND THE TERRITORIAL SEA (IN WHICH THE 
COASTAL STATE ENJOYS FULL SOVEREIGNTY), ALL STATES ENJOY 
THE FREEDOMS OF NAVIGATION AND OVERFLIGHT AND OTHER 
RELATED USES OF THE SEA WITHIN THE EEZ, PROVIDED THAT THEY 
DO SO WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF THE COASTAL STATE 
AND OTHER STATES.  SEE ARTICLE 58 OF THE LOS CONVENTION. 
 
SURVEY ACTIVITIES VS. MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

THE RIGHTS ALL STATES ENJOY INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT 
SURVEY ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE EEZ.  SURVEY ACTIVITIES ARE 
NOT MSR.  THE LOS CONVENTION DISTINGUISHES CLEARLY BETWEEN 
THE CONCEPTS OF \"RESEARCH\" AND \"MSR\" ON THE ONE HAND AND 
\"HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS\" AND \"SURVEY ACTIVITIES\" ON THE 
OTHER HAND.  ARTICLE 19(2)(J) OF THE LOS CONVENTION 
INCLUDES \"RESEARCH OR SURVEY ACTIVITIES\" AS INCONSISTENT 
WITH INNOCENT PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA.  ARTICLE 
21(1)(G) AUTHORIZES THE COASTAL STATE TO ADOPT LAWS AND 
REGULATIONS, IN CONFORMITY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE 
CONVENTION AND OTHER RULES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, RELATING 
 
TO INNOCENT PASSAGE THROUGH THE TERRITORIAL SEA IN RESPECT 
OF \"MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS\". 
ARTICLE 40, ENTITLED \"RESEARCH AND SURVEY ACTIVITIES,\" 
PROVIDES THAT IN TRANSIT PASSAGE THROUGH STRAITS USED FOR 
INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION, FOREIGN SHIPS, INCLUDING \"MARINE 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY SHIPS\", MAY 
NOT CARRY OUT \"ANY RESEARCH OR SURVEY ACTIVITIES\" WITHOUT 
THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OF THE STATES BORDERING STRAITS. 
THE SAME RULE APPLIES TO SHIPS ENGAGED IN ARCHIPELAGIC SEA 
LANES PASSAGE (ARTICLE 54). 
 
ON THE OTHER HAND, PART XIII OF THE LOS CONVENTION FULLY 
REGULATES MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH; IT DOES NOT REFER TO 
SURVEY ACTIVITIES AT ALL.  ARTICLE 246 OF THE LOS 
CONVENTION PROVIDES THAT COASTAL STATES, IN THE EXERCISE 
OF THEIR JURISDICTION WITHIN THE EEZ, HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
REGULATE, AUTHORIZE AND CONDUCT MSR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION.  IT SPECIFIES THAT 
MSR IN THE EEZ SHALL BE CONDUCTED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE 
COASTAL STATE.  SWEDEN HAS SO PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 9 OF 
LAW SFS 1992:1140. 
 
AND WHILE THE CONVENTION, BY ITS TERMS, LIMITS SURVEY 
ACTIVITIES DURING PASSAGE IN THE TERRITORIAL SEA, 
INTERNATIONAL STRAITS AND ARCHIPELAGIC SEA LANES, THE 
CONVENTION DOES NOT LIMIT THE ACTIVITIES OF SURVEY SHIPS 
IN THE EEZ.  RATHER, THE CONDUCT OF SURVEYS IN THE EEZ IS 
AN EXERCISE OF THE FREEDOMS OF NAVIGATION AND OTHER 
INTERNATIONALLY LAWFUL USES OF THE SEA RELATED TO THOSE 
FREEDOMS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF 
SHIPS, WHICH ARTICLE 58 OF THE LOS CONVENTION GUARANTEES 
TO ALL STATES. 
 
INDEED, SWEDEN HAS RECOGNIZED THIS RIGHT IN PARAGRAPH 10 
OF LAW SFS 1992:1140, WHICH IN ENGLISH TRANSLATION READS 
\"THIS LAW, AS WELL AS THE PROVISIONS AND CONDITIONS WHICH 
ARE TRANSMITTED IN SUPPORT OF THE LAW. SHALL NOT CONTAIN 
ANY RESTRICTION OF THE EXISTING RIGHTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR FREEDOM OF NAVIGATION IN THE 
EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE, FOR OVERFLIGHT OF THE ZONE, OR 
FOR PLACEMENT OF CABLES AND PIPELINES IN THE ZONE, OR FOR 
ANY OTHER RIGHTS WHICH ARE COMMONLY ACCEPTED PRINCIPLES OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW.\" 
 
THIS CONCLUSION, THAT MSR IS DISTINCT FROM SURVEY 
ACTIVITIES, IS SUPPORTED BY OTHER RESPECTED PUBLICATIONS 
ON THIS SUBJECT.   FOR EXAMPLE, A 1991 PUBLICATION 
PREPARED BY THE UN OFFICE FOR OCEAN AFFAIRS AND THE LAW OF 
 
THE SEA, ENTITLED \"THE LAW OF THE SEA: MARINE SCIENTIFIC 
RESEARCH: A GUIDE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RELEVANT 
PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF 
THE SEA\" (UN PUBLICATION SALES NO. E.91.V.3), NOTES THAT 
\"\'SURVEY ACTIVITIES\' ... ARE PRIMARILY DEALT WITH IN OTHER 
PARTS ... OF THE CONVENTION RATHER THAN IN PART XIII. 
THIS COULD INDICATE THAT THESE ACTIVITIES DO NOT FALL 
UNDER THE REGIME OF PART XIII.\" (PAGE 1). 
 
PROFESSOR ALFRED H.A. SOONS, DIRECTOR OF THE NETHERLANDS 
INSTITUTE FOR THE LAW OF THE SEA, IN HIS BOOK \"MARINE 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE LAW OF THE SEA\" (1982), HAS 
WRITTEN: \"FROM ARTICLES 19, 21 AND 40, WHICH USE THE TERM 
\'HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING\' SEPARATELY FROM \'RESEARCH\', IT 
FOLLOWS THAT THE TERM \"MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\'. FOR 
THE PURPOSES OF THE DRAFT CONVENTION, DOES NOT COVER 
HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING ACTIVITIES.\" (PAGE 125)  LATER IN 
THE SAME BOOK, PROFESSOR SOONS WROTE:  \"WITH RESPECT TO 
HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYING (AN ACTIVITY WHICH IS NOT TO BE 
CONSIDERED MARINE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, ALTHOUGH IT IS 
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO IT ...), IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THIS 
ACTIVITY, WHEN IT IS CONDUCTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
ENHANCING THE SAFETY OF NAVIGATION ... , MUST BE REGARDED 
AS AN INTERNATIONALLY LAWFUL USE OF THE SEA ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE OPERATIONS OF SHIPS ... IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
ARTICLE 58, AND CAN THEREFORE BE CONDUCTED FREELY IN THE 
EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE.....\" (PAGE 157) 
 
DEFINITIONS 
----------- 
 
THE LOS CONVENTION DOES NOT DEFINE THE TERMS \"MARINE 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH\", \"SURVEY ACTIVITIES\", \"HYDROGRAPHIC 
SURVEY\", OR \"MILITARY SURVEY\".  HOWEVER, THE CONCEPTS ARE 
DISTINCT. 
 
THE UNITED STATES ACCEPTS THAT \"MARINE SCIENTIFIC 
RESEARCH\" IS THE GENERAL TERM MOST OFTEN USED TO DESCRIBE 
THOSE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN THE OCEAN AND COASTAL 
WATERS TO EXPAND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARINE 
ENVIRONMENT.  MSR INCLUDES OCEANOGRAPHY, MARINE BIOLOGY, 
FISHERIES RESEARCH, SCIENTIFIC OCEAN DRILLING AND CORING, 
GEOLOGICAL/GEOPHYSICAL SCIENTIFIC SURVEYING, AS WELL AS 
OTHER ACTIVITIES WITH A SCIENTIFIC PURPOSE. 
 
THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED MODERN INTERNATIONAL INTERPRETATION 
OF \"HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY\", WHICH IS SHARED BY THE UNITED 
STATES, IS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FOR THE MAKING OF 
 
NAVIGATIONAL CHARTS AND SAFETY OF NAVIGATION.  IT INCLUDES 
DETERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE OF SEVERAL CLASSES OF DATA IN 
COASTAL OR RELATIVELY SHALLOW AREAS--DEPTH OF WATER, 
CONFIGURATION AND NATURE OF THE NATURAL BOTTOM, DIRECTIONS 
AND FORCE OF CURRENTS, HEIGHTS AND TIMES OF TIDES AND 
WATER STAGES, AND HAZARDS FOR NAVIGATION--FOR THE 
PRODUCTION OF NAUTICAL CHARTS AND SIMILAR PRODUCTS TO 
SUPPORT SAFETY OF NAVIGATION. 
 
THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS THAT MILITARY SURVEYS REFER TO 
ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN THE OCEAN AND COASTAL WATERS 
INVOLVING MARINE DATA COLLECTION (WHETHER OR NOT 
CLASSIFIED) FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.  MILITARY SURVEYS CAN 
INCLUDE OCEANOGRAPHIC, MARINE GEOLOGICAL, GEOPHYSICAL, 
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL AND ACOUSTIC DATA.  EQUIPMENT USED 
CAN INCLUDE FATHOMETERS, SWATH BOTTOM MAPPERS, SIDE SCAN 
SONARS, BOTTOM GRAB AND CORING SYSTEMS, CURRENT METERS AND 
PROFILERS.  WHILE THE MEANS OF DATA COLLECTION USED IN 
MILITARY SURVEYS MAY SOMETIMES BE THE SAME AS THAT USED IN 
MSR, INFORMATION FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES, REGARDLESS OF 
SECURITY CLASSIFICATION, IS INTENDED NOT FOR USE BY THE 
GENERAL SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY, BUT BY THE MILITARY. 
 
MILITARY SURVEYS ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE LOS 
CONVENTION AND THERE IS NO LANGUAGE STATING OR IMPLYING 
THAT MILITARY SURVEYS MAY BE REGULATED IN ANY MANNER BY 
COASTAL STATES OUTSIDE THEIR TERRITORIAL SEA OR 
ARCHIPELAGIC WATERS.  THE UNITED STATES THEREFORE 
CONSIDERS IT TO BE FULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LOS 
CONVENTION THAT SUCH SURVEYS ARE A HIGH SEAS FREEDOM AND 
THE UNITED STATES RESERVES THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN MILITARY 
SURVEYS ANYWHERE OUTSIDE FOREIGN TERRITORIAL SEAS AND 
ARCHIPELAGIC WATERS.  TO PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE OR REQUEST 
PERMISSION WOULD CREATE AN ADVERSE PRECEDENT FOR 
RESTRICTIONS ON MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF MILITARY 
SURVEY OPERATIONS. 
 
THESE DEFINITIONS CLEARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MSR, WHICH 
THE COASTAL STATE CAN REGULATE, AND HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY 
AND MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE FREEDOMS THE 
COASTAL STATE CANNOT REGULATE OUTSIDE ITS TERRITORIAL SEA. 
 
MILITARY ACTIVITIES 
------------------- 
 
THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTION AS TO THE CONDUCT OF \"MILITARY 
ACTIVITIES\" IN THE EEZ WITHOUT COASTAL STATE CONSENT.  IN 
THE VIEW OF THE UNITED STATES, THE LOS CONVENTION 
RECOGNIZES THAT ALL STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT 
MILITARY ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE EEZ, PROVIDED THAT THEY DO 
SO WITH DUE REGARD TO THE RIGHTS OF THE COASTAL STATE AND 
OTHER STATES.  APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE LAUNCHING 
AND LANDING OF AIRCRAFT, OPERATING MILITARY DEVICES, 
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION, WEAPONS EXERCISES, AND MILITARY 
SURVEYS.  THERE IS NO GENERAL COMPETENCE OF THE COASTAL 
STATE OVER MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN THE EEZ.  IT FOLLOWS 
THAT MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED OUTSIDE FOREIGN 
TERRITORIAL SEAS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COASTAL STATE 
REGULATION.  SEE ARTICLE 56 OF THE LOS CONVENTION AND 
OXMAN, THE REGIME OF WARSHIPS UNDER THE UNITED NATIONS 
CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA, VIRGINIA JOURNAL OF 
INTERNATIONAL LAW, VOL. 24, AT PAGE 847 (1984). 
 
U.S. MILITARY SURVEY VESSELS 
---------------------------- 
 
THE USNS KANE IS ONE OF A CLASS OF U.S. NAVAL AUXILIARY 
VESSELS (T-AGS) DESIGNED FOR AND OPERATING AS MILITARY 
SURVEY VESSELS.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT EXERCISES OUR HIGH 
SEAS FREEDOMS WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY SURVEY ACTIVITY IN 
THE EEZ OF COASTAL STATES WORLDWIDE CONSISTENT WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AS REFLECTED IN THIS PAPER.

SUBJECT:  TFKN01:  DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG ABSORBS BOTH KOREAS 
 
REF:  A. SEOUL 57989  B. TOKYO 9565 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY.  THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG HAS MONOPOLIZED 
MEDIA, GOVERNMENT, AND PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS IN SOUTH KOREA 
SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON JULY 9.  ROKG POLICY PLANNERS 
CONTINUE TO DISCUSS OFFICIAL REACTIONS, INCLUDING AT A 
PRIME MINISTER-CHAIRED POLICY COORDINATION MEETING TODAY. 
FM HAN SUNG JOO TOLD US THAT THE ROKG EXPECTS PYONGYANG TO 
SEEK A SOUTH-NORTH SUMMIT AS SOON AS THE SUCCESSION IS 
SETTLED.  THE ROK WILL BE WILLING TO DISCUSS ARRANGEMENTS 
FOR A SUMMIT AFTER THAT HAPPENS.  DOMESTIC POLITICAL 
REACTION HAS SUPPORTED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DATE, WITH 
MOST POLITICIANS STATING THEIR BELIEF THAT KIM JONG IL 
WILL CONTINUE THE POLICIES OF HIS FATHER, IN ORDER TO LEND 
LEGITIMACY TO HIS RULE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAN\'S VIEWS 
---------------------------- 
 
3.  AS EXPECTED BOTH KOREAS CONTINUE TO BE FULLY ABSORBED 
BY THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG.  DURING A 
LATE AFTERNOON MEETING WITH CHARGE (SEPTEL), FM HAN SUNG 
JOO CONFIRMED ROKG RECEIPT OF DPRK WORKERS PARTY SECRETARY 
KIM YOUNG SUN\'S LETTER EXPRESSING DPRK DESIRE TO POSTPONE 
THE PLANNED JUNE 25-27 SUMMIT.  HAN TOLD CHARGE THAT THE 
ROKG IN ITS RESPONSE WILL EXPRESS ITS COMMITMENT TO THE 
\"SPIRIT AND PRINCIPLE\" OF THE SUMMIT AGREEMENT, AND THAT 
ONCE THE SITUATION STABILIZES AND THE ROKG KNOWS WHO IS IN 
CHARGE IN NORTH KOREA THE ROKG WILL BE WILLING TO DISCUSS 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A SUMMIT.  HAN PREDICTED THAT THE NORTH 
KOREANS WOULD WANT TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH A DATE FOR THE 
SUMMIT; THE ROK WOULD NOT BE IN A HURRY, HE SAID, ALTHOUGH 
SEOUL WOULD NOT REFUSE OR UNNECESSARILY DELAY SUCH A 
MEETING. 
 
4.  IN RESPONSE TO CHARGE\'S QUERY, HAN SAID THAT THE ROKG 
HAD NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE OTHER THAN KIM JONG 
IL WOULD ASSUME POWER IN NORTH KOREA.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, 
THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT KIM MIGHT ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR MEETING FOREIGNERS TO SOMEONE ELSE, GIVEN KIM\'S 
COMPLETE LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS REGARD.  IN THIS 
CONTEXT, HAN NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SPECULATION 
THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SEPARATE HEAD OF STATE VERSUS LEADER 
OF THE PARTY, THE ROKG INCLINATION WAS TO BELIEVE THAT KIM 
WOULD ASSUME BOTH POSITIONS. 
 
5.  FINALLY, HAN COMMENTED ON THE EXISTENCE OF 
AUTHORITATIVE VOICES IN THE KOREAN GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD 
PREFER A MORE MEASURED USG APPROACH TOWARD NORTH KOREA TO 
AVOID ENABLING PYONGYANG TO FEEL OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT ITS 
NEW POSITION IN THE AFTERMATH OF KIM IL SUNG\'S DEATH. 
STRESSING THE UNUSUAL PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REGIME IN 
PYONGYANG, HAN CITED THE EXAMPLE OF OUR EXTENSION OF 
CONDOLENCES TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE AS SOMETHING THE REGIME 
MIGHT MISREAD IN A WAY TO DIMINISH THE RESPECT PYONGYANG 
MIGHT HOLD FOR US IN OUR FUTURE DEALINGS.  HAN ALSO CITED 
HIS VIEW THAT IT WAS USEFUL FOR CHINA TO MAINTAIN GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH THE NEW REGIME. 
 
6.  COMMENT.  HAN IS FEELING SOME PRESSURE, PERHAPS FROM 
MND, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EXPRESSION OF CONDOLENCES.  HE 
DESCRIBED THE KOREANS AS SPLIT BETWEEN THOSE WHO REVILE 
KIM AND THOSE WHO ARE MORE FORWARD-LOOKING.  THE FORMER 
MAY BLAME HIM FOR NOT PREVENTING ANY EXPRESSION OF 
CONDOLENCE FROM THE U.S.  HAN\'S COVERSATION WITH SECRETARY 
OF STATE CHRISTOPER HELPED HIM, AND THERE MAY BE AN EFFORT 
TO HAVE PRESIDENT KIM SPEAK TO PRESIDENT CLINTON ON THE 
TELEPHONE LATER IN THE WEEK.  END COMMENT. 
 
WHAT NEXT 
--------- 
 
7.  SOUTH KOREAN MEDIA HAVE CONCENTRATED ON ALL ASPECTS OF 
THE ISSUE TO THE VIRTUAL EXCLUSION OF OTHER STORIES, WHILE 
THE NORTH IS STEEPED IN MOURNING AND, PRESUMABLY, 
BEHIND-THE-SCENES CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL POWER AROUND 
HEIR-APPARENT KIM JONG IL.  THE DPRK HAS YET TO MAKE A 
MAJOR POLICY STATEMENT SINCE THE SENIOR KIM\'S DEATH. 
ANALYSTS IN SOUTH KOREA PREDICTED SUCH A STATEMENT WILL BE 
MADE WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
 
8.  KIM IL SUNG\'S FUNERAL WILL BE HELD ON JUL 17, WITH NO 
FOREIGN DELEGATIONS EXPECTED TO BE INVITED OR ALLOWED. 
THE DPRK REFUSED AN OFFER OF A \"CONDOLENCE VISIT\" FROM 
PRESIDENT CARTER (THEN IN TOKYO) ON SATURDAY (REF B), 
ALTHOUGH YONHAP REPORTED JULY 11 THAT THE DPRK INTENDS TO 
INVITE PRESIDENT CARTER TO THE FUNERAL.)  A SENIOR ROKG 
OFFICIAL SPECULATED THAT THE DPRK MAY EXCLUDE FOREIGN 
DELEGATIONS BECAUSE IT IS AFRAID THAT IF INVITED, THEY 
WILL NOT COME, THUS EXPOSING TO THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE 
THE LIE OF KIM IL SUNG AS A WORLD-REVERED GREAT LEADER. 
 
KIM JONG IL SUCCESSION PROGRESSES 
--------------------------------- 
 
9.  KIM JONG IL HAS NOT YET APPEARED IN PUBLIC, NOR HAS 
THERE BEEN A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS SUCCESSION TO THE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE DPRK.  NEVERTHELESS, INDICATIONS 
CONTINUE TO PILE UP THAT THE TRANSFER OF POWER TO KIM IL 
SUNG\'S OLDEST SON AND HEIR APPARENT IS PROCEEDING.  DPRK 
MEDIA HAVE PRODUCED A STEADY STREAM OF LAUDATORY COMMENTS 
ON THE JUNIOR KIM, AS WELL AS PUBLIC PLEDGES OF LOYALTY BY 
VARIOUS OFFICIALS OF THE DPRK GOVERNMENT AND PARTY 
HIERARCHY. 
 
10.  ALL MEMBERS OF THE WORKERS PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE 
AND THE SUPREME PEOPLE\'S ASSEMBLY WERE TOLD TO GATHER IN 
PYONGYANG BY JULY 11 FOR CONDOLENCES.  IT WOULD BE 
REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THEY WILL ELECT KIM JONG IL TO 
THE TWO TOP POSITIONS OF PRESIDENT AND WORKERS PARTY 
SECRETARY.  (OF COURSE, HE ALREADY HOLDS THE THIRD TOP 
POSITION OF CHAIRMAN OF THE MILITARY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE OF 
THE WORKERS PARTY.) 
 
NORTH-SOUTH SUMMIT \"POSTPONED\" 
------------------------------ 
 
11.  ON THE MORNING OF JULY 11, THE DPRK SENT A VERY BRIEF 
MESSAGE TO THE ROKG STATING THAT IN LIGHT OF KIM IL SUNG\'S 
DEATH, THE SUMMIT \"COULD NOT BUT BE POSTPONED.\"  THE 
MESSAGE WAS SENT TO ROK DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER FOR 
UNIFICATION LEE HONG-KU FROM HIS COUNTERPART AT THE 
HIGH-LEVEL TALKS OF JUNE 28, DPRK WORKERS PARTY SECRETARY 
KIM YOUNG-SUN. 
 
12.  DURING A BRIEFING FOR THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS HELD ON 
MONDAY AFTERNOON, ASSISTANT MINISTER CHOI DONG JIN 
STRESSED THAT THE ROKG\'S BASIC PRINCIPLES ON PEACE, 
SECURITY AND COOPERATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA REMAIN 
THE SAME, AND THE ROK LEADERSHIP HOPES THAT BOTH SIDES CAN 
RESUME PLANNING FOR A SUMMIT \"IF OR WHEN A NEW ENVIRONMENT 
IS CREATED THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO HOLDING A SUMMIT.\" 
 
13.  ROKG PUBLIC STATEMENTS HAVE CONTINUALLY STRESSED THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S CONFIDENCE IN ITS READINESS TO RESPOND TO ALL 
EVENTUALITIES.  APPEARING BEFORE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ON 
JULY 11, DPM LEE PREDICTED A \"QUIET FRONT\" IN THE DPRK 
WHILE THE TRANSFER OF POWER IS COMPLETED AND THE NEW 
REGIME STABILIZED.  HE FORESAW NO MAJOR CHANGES IN 
NORTH-SOUTH RELATIONS. 
 
DOMESTIC POLITICAL REACTION 
--------------------------- 
14.  A STAFF ASSISTANT TO FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE 
AND OPPOSITION LEADER KIM DAE JUNG SPOKE WITH POLOFF TODAY 
AND LAID OUT KIM\'S ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION IN THE 
NORTH.  KIM BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG IL WILL STAY WITH THE 
COURSE SET BY HIS FATHER, AS THIS WILL BE THE SUREST WAY 
TO LEGITIMIZE HIS RULE.  IF HE IS INCLINED TO PURSUE HIS 
OWN POLICIES, HE WILL NOT DO SO UNTIL HE FIRMLY 
ESTABLISHES HIS RULE. 
 
15.  KIM DAE JUNG SEES TWO PRIORITIES FOR KIM JONG IL ONCE 
HE ASSUMES POWER.  HIS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WILL BE TO 
RESUME TALKS WITH THE USG, BECAUSE OF THE INSPECTION 
DEADLINE RELATING TO THE SPENT FUEL RODS.  SECONDLY, KIM 
WILL NEED TO IMPROVE HIS CREDIBILITY AS A LEADER BY 
PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE.  THE 
EASIEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WOULD BE TO IMPROVE 
ECONOMIC TIES WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.  THUS, KIM DAE JUNG 
IS OPTIMISTIC THAT KIM JONG IL WILL CONTINUE DIALOGUE WITH 
THE US., WITH THE HOPE OF OBTAINING ECONOMIC 
CONCESSIONS.  THE CHIEF OBSTACLE KIM SEES AT THE MOMENT, 
HOWEVER, IS THE ROKG.  KIM IS CONCERNED THAT THE SOUTH MAY 
SEIZE THIS PERIOD AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE DPRK, AND 
ADD MORE CONDITIONS TO THE TALKS.  IF SO, KIM BELIEVES 
THAT RATHER THAN ACQUIESCE TO FURTHER DEMANDS, THE NORTH 
WOULD RETRENCH, AND HOPES FOR A RESOLUTION OF THE NUCLEAR 
PROBLEM WOULD BE RUINED. 
 
16.  REP. PARK CHUNG SOO, A RULING DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL 
PARTY (DLP) ASSEMBLYMAN, AND MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEE, SPOKE WITH POLOFF AND ECHOED KIM DAE JUNG\'S 
ANALYSIS.  ADDITIONALLY, PARK STATED THAT THE PARTY FELT 
THAT IF AND WHEN NORTH KOREA PROPOSES ANOTHER SUMMIT, THE 
FORMAT MUST BE REEVALUATED COMPLETELY.  ALTHOUGH MEMBERS 
SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF A SUMMIT WITH KIM JONG IL, IT WOULD 
HAVE TO BE HELD IN ANOTHER LOCATION, AND WITH A DIFFERENT 
AGENDA. 

 
STATEMENT BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
--------------------------------- 
17.  THE MAIN OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PARTY (DP) PROVIDED 
THE EMBASSY WITH THE FOLLOWING ENGLISH TEXT ON THE 
AFTERNOON OF JULY 11: 
 
\"1.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE AND 
NEGOTIATION POSITIVELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BASIC 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH KOREA FOR SUMMIT TALKS. 
THOUGH THERE COULD BE SOME DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION AND 
OPINIONS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF THE NORTH KOREA\'S REGIME, IT 
IS UNDER THE CONTEXT THAT REGIME UNDER KIM JONG IL COULD 
STILL BE THE OBJECT OF NEGOTIATION AND DIALOGUE WHEN THE 
KIM JONG IL\'S REGIME WILL BE IN POWER IN THE CASE OF LATE 
KIM IL SUNG. 
 
2.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT TO REFRAIN FROM ANY PROVOCATIVE 
ACTIONS OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY AREAS AGAINST NORTH 
KOREA UNTIL NORTH KOREA RESTORES THE PEACE WITHIN THE 
REGIME. 
 
3.  WE URGE THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO SHOW ANY POSTURE WHICH 
MAY INFLUENCE ON NORTH KOREA\'S POWER FORMATION. 
 
(ISSUED BY THE FOREIGN RELATION\'S COMMITTEE OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.)\" 
 
18.  COMMENT:  THE INSISTENCE BY THE DP THAT THE SUMMIT GO 
AHEAD AS SCHEDULED RUNS AT ODDS WITH PUBLIC SENTIMENT. 
SOUTH KOREANS DO NOT HOLD A SOFT SPOT FOR THE YOUNGER KIM, 
AND A TRIP BY KIM YOUNG SAM TO PYONGYANG TO MEET WITH 
SOMEONE HIS JUNIOR IN BOTH AGE AND LEADERSHIP TENURE WOULD 
INVITE WIDESPREAD PUBLIC CRITICISM.  END COMMENT. 
 
QUOTE OF THE DAY 
---------------- 
19.  EMBOFF WAS TOLD BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT FORMER 
PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER IS NOW REFERRED TO IN ROKG CIRCLES 
AS \"THE ANGEL OF DEATH.\"

TO BECOME A CENTER OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY FOR 
PKK TERRORISM. PLEASE PROVIDE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON

CONCERNS. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) REF A TURKISH PRESS SUMMARY (BEIN6 REPEATED TO 
MOSCOW) NOTED TURKISH PRESS REPORTS THAT ON OCTOBER 29 
-KURDISH SEPARATISTS FROM TURKEY STARTED A THREE-DAY 
MEETING IN MOSCOW AIMED AT UNITING AND STRENGTHENING THE 
KURDISH MOVEMENT WITHIN THE COMMONWEALTH OF INDEPENDENT 
STATES. THE MEETING, SPONSORED BY THE PKK (KURDISTAN 
WORKERS\' PARTY), IS PART OF A CAMPAIGN IN THE FORMER 
EAST BLOC. THE CONFERENCE WAS CLOSED TO TURKISH 
JOURNALISTS.- REF B PRESS SUMMARY QUOTED TURKISH PRESS 
REPORTS THAT THE CONFERENCE ENDED OCTOBER 31 HAVING 
ELECTED ONE YURI NEBIEV LEADER OF A -KURDISH UNION.\" 
TURKEY REPORTEDLY PROTESTED THE CONFERENCE VIA 
DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS. (NB: TURKEY HAS NOT ASKED THE USG 
FOR SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE.) 
 
---------- 
THE THREAT 
---------- 
 
3. (S) DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT PRO-PKK CONFERENCES 
OF THIS NATURE HAVE BEEN HELD PREVIOUSLY, AND THAT THE 
RUSSIANS HAVE IN THE PAST ASSURED TURKEY THAT MOSCOW HAS 
NO INTENTION OF ESTABLISHING TIES WITH THE PKK (REF C). 
EXPERIENCE WITH THE PKK AND ITS FRONTS IN WESTERN EUROPE 
HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ORGANIZATION CAN POSE A DANGER 
EVEN WITHOUT THE FORMAL SUPPORT OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT. 
DEPARTMENT WOULD BE CONCERNED WERE MOSCOW TO BECOME A 
CENTER OF OPERATIONAL SUPPORT ACTIVITY FOR PKK TERRORISM 
(E.G., WEAPONS PROCUREMENT, TRAINING) -- REPORTS OF SUCH 
ACTIVITY HAVE SURFACED IN THE PAST (E.G. REFS D, E) -- 
OR WERE THE PKK TO MOBILIZE THE SERVICES OF RUSSIAN 
MAFIA GROUPS. 
 
 
--------------------- 
BACKGROUND ON THE PKK 
--------------------- 
 
4. (C) THE USG CONSIDERS THE PKK TO BE A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, NOT/NOT A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL MOVEMENT. 
OUR SUPPORT FOR TURKISH EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE PKK IS 
BASED NOT ONLY ON THE THREAT IT POSES TO TURKEY, BUT IN 
PART ON THE GROUP\'S PAST AND PRESENT ACTIONS THREATENING 
AMERICAN LIVES AND INTERESTS. SINCE THE 1984 START OF 
ITS CAMPAIGN TO CARVE A KURDISH STATE OUT OF THE TURKISH 
SOUTHEAST, THE PKK HAS REPEATEDLY TAKEN AMERICANS 
HOSTAGE AND ATTACKED US ECONOMIC TAR6ETS. THE PKK\'S 
ONGOING BOMBING CAMPAIGN AIMED AT TOURIST SITES IN 
TURKEY ENDANGERS AMERICAN AS WELL AS TURKISH AND 
PORT FORTHE PKK WAS FREQUENTLY ALLEGED. 
 
5. (S) THE PKK\'S POLITICAL WING, ERNK, MAINTAINS A 
PRESENCE IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING 
SOME WHICH BAN THE PKK. AFTER THE PKK ENGAGED IN 
TERRORISM IN WESTERN EUROPE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1993, 
FRANCE AND GERMANY BANNED THE GROUP AND DOZENS OF ITS 
FRONTS. ERNK CLAIMS ITS INTERNATIONAL OFFICES ENGAGE 
ONLY IN ORGANIZATIONAL AND INFORMATION ACTIVITY. 
HOWEVER, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IN SOME COUNTRIES ERNK 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN OPERATIONAL TERRORIST 
SUPPORT ACTIVITY. DEPARTMENT SEEKS TO DISCOURAGE 
GOVERNMENTS FROM DRAWING A FACILE DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
\"TERRORIST- PKK AND \"POLITICAL\" ERNK. 
 
 
---------------- 
ACTION REQUESTED 
---------------- 
 
6. (C) AT THIS STAGE, THE DEPARTMENT WOULD LIKE TO 
REVIEW THE LATEST READILY-AVAILABLE INFORMATION ON 
PKK-RELATED ACTIVITY IN RUSSIA, WITH AN EYE TOWARD A 
POSSIBLE DEMARCHE TO MOSCOW DETAILING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE PKK AND ITS FRONTS. PLEASE REPORT ON THE NATURE, 
SCOPE, AND PARTICIPANTS OF THE CONFERENCE CITED IN REFS 
A AND B, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ANY RUSSIAN 
GOVERNMENTAL INVOLVEMENT OR FACILITATION. (WE WOULD 
APPRECIATE ANY DETAILS THE TURKISH EMBASSY IN MOSCOW MAY 
HAVE.) MORE BROADLY, DEPARTMENT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN 
ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO EMBASSY ON ACTIVITIES AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE PKK, ERNK, OR OTHER PRO-PKK 
SUPPORT OR FRONT ORGANIZATIONS IN RUSSIA. 
 
7. (C) DEPARTMENT ALSO INVITES POST\'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON 
THE APPROPRIATENESS AND TACTICS OF A DEMARCHE TO MOSCOW 
LAYING DOWN A MARKER ON THE PKK. AT THIS STAGE EMBASSY 
SHOULD NOT/NOT APPROACH HOST GOVERNMENT FOR 
INFORMATION. SLUG REPLY FOR S/CT (KOSNETT) AND ISCA.

IDENTIFIED AS THE BRUNEI KORAN READING. 

5.  NO INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON WHETHER THE BRUNEI 
KORAN READING STILL EXISTS.  THE LOOSELY-ORGANIZED TABLIGH 
MOVEMENT--WHICH ORIGINATED IN INDIA IN THE 1950S AND 
REACHED SOUTHEAST ASIA VIA MALAYSIA IN THE 1970S--HAS 
ADHERENTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHEAST ASIA.  TABLIGH CAMPAIGNS 
ARE TYPICALLY ORGANIZED BY LOCAL MUSLIM LEADERS OR PATRONS 
AND CONSIST OF GROUPS WHICH TRAVEL TO URBAN OR RURAL AREAS 
TO PRESENT LECTURES AND ENGAGE IN OTHER MISSIONARY 
ACTIVITIES THAT EMPHASIZE INDIVIDUAL PIETY AND INNER 
SPIRITUAL STRENGTH.  THE TABLIGH CAMPAIGNS IN MALAYSIA, 
FOR EXAMPLE, DRAW ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY YOUNG MEN WHO FUND 
THEIR OWN PARTICIPATION.  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT 
VIEWED THE TABLIGH AS A \"RADICAL ISLAMIC ELEMENT,\" 
ALTHOUGH THE RADICAL ABU SAYYAF GROUP IN THE SOUTHERN 
PHILIPPINES MAY HAVE GROWN OUT OF A TABLIGH CHAPTER. 

6.  ANECDOTAL REPORTING FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES 
INDICATES THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE TRAVEL BY MUSLIM 
FIGURES BETWEEN SOUTHEAST ASIA, SOUTH ASIA, AND THE MIDDLE 
EAST.  THOUSANDS OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN MUSLIMS ATTEND 
UNIVERSITIES IN MIDDLE EASTERN NATIONS--ON OCCASION 
DEFYING GOVERNMENT BANS ON TRAVEL TO PARIAH NATIONS SUCH 
AS IRAN, IRAQ, AND SYRIA IN ORDER TO DO SO.  WE HAVE NO 
STATISTICS ON BRUNEI CITIZENS WHO MAY BE STUDYING IN 
MUSLIM COUNTRIES ABROAD.  THERE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT 
EXCHANGE AT THE NONGOVERNMENTAL LEVEL BETWEEN SOUTHEAST 
ASIAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN/SOUTH ASIAN ISLAMIC ACADEMIC, 
COMMUNITY AND OTHER OPINION LEADERS.  REPORTING ON THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IS FRAGMENTARY AND ITS 
IMPACT ON LOCAL MUSLIM GROUPS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS AT 
THIS TIME.  THE POTENTIAL EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT THIS 
CONTACT COULD BE A CHANNEL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
UNDERGROUND RADICAL ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS. 

7.  WE ARE CHECKING ON THE MEDIA CLAIMS THAT MEMBERS OF 
THE IRANIAN DELEGATION THAT VISITED SOUTHEAST ASIA IN 
OCTOBER INCLUDED TWO SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE IRANIAN 
INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS, AND WILL PASS ALONG THE RESULTS OF 
OUR RESEARCH WHEN COMPLETE.

SUBJECT:  THE PRESIDENT\'S NEW COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVE 
 
1.  SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT.  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE. 

2.  SUMMARY:  ON JANUARY 24, PRESIDENT CLINTON SIGNED AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BLOCK ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
TWELVE DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS THAT THREATEN 
TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.  THE ORDER 
ALSO PROHIBITS FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE 
GROUPS.  THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO ANNOUNCED JANUARY 24 THAT 
THE PRESIDENT WILL SOON SEND TO THE CONGRESS NEW, 
STRENGTHENED, ANTI-TERRORIST LEGISLATION.  THESE 
INITIATIVES , TOGETHER, RESPOND TO A RISING INCIDENCE OF 
TERRORISM AIMED ATTHE PEACE PROCESS, THE PROBLEM OF 
FUNDING OF TERRORIST GROUPS BY DONORS IN THE U.S., AND 
THE CONTINUING THREAT FROM INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM OF 
ALL KINDS, WORLDWIDE.  POSTS ARE ASKED TO BRIEF HOST 
GOVERNMENTS ON THESE U.S. INITIATIVES AND URGE THEM TO 
TAKE SIMILAR STEPS TO BROADEN THEIR COUNTERTERRORISM 
LAWS, INCLUDING, ESPECIALLY, MEASURES AGAINST FUND 
RAISING.  YOU MAY DRAW ON THE FOLLOWING POINTS, 
TAILORING THEM TO FIT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR HOST 
GOVERNMENT AND OUR BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP.  END SUMMARY. 

--  THE MENACE OF TERRORISM CONTINUES TO THREATEN 
THE SECURITY AND WELL-BEING OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AROUND 
THE WORLD, AND INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM IS 
RISING. 

--  TERRORISM IS A PARTICULAR THREAT TO THE MIDDLE 
EAST PEACE PROCESS, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE BOMBING 
ATTACK IN ISRAEL WHICH KILLED AT LEAST 19 ON JANUARY 22, 
AND MANY OTHER RECENT ATTACKS THERE. 

--  OTHER EXAMPLES OF TERRORISM DESIGNED TO DISRUPT 
THE PEACE PROCESS BY ATTACKING THOSE WHO SUPPORT IT, 
INCLUDE ATTACKS ON EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, 
THREATS AGAINST PALESTINIANS, THE MASSACRE AT THE MOSQUE 
IN HEBRON, AND BOMBINGS IN BUENOS AIRES AND LONDON 
AGAINST ISRAELI AND JEWISH TARGETS. 

--  SUCH ATTACKS THREATEN TO DISRUPT A PROCESS OF 
PEACE AND RECONCILIATION TO WHICH ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS 
AND SEVERAL ARAB STATES HAVE MADE AN HISTORIC AND 
COURAGEOUS COMMITMENT. 

THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING TWO IMPORTANT INITIATIVES. 
FIRST, TO STRENGTHEN UNITED STATES EFFORTS TO COUNTER 
THE DANGER OF TERRORISM TO THE PEACE PROCESS, AND 
SECOND, TO COMBAT THE GLOBAL TERRORIST THREAT. 

--------------- 
EXECUTIVE ORDER 
--------------- 

--  ON JANUARY 24, PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCED AN 
EXECUTIVE ORDER TO BLOCK ASSETS IN THE UNITED STATES OF 
TWELVE DESIGNATED MIDDLE EAST TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS. 
THE ORDER ALSO PROHIBITS TRANSFERS BY U.S. DONORS TO 
THESE ORGANIZATIONS. 

--  THE TWELVE DESIGNATED TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS ARE: 

--  ABU NIDAL ORGANIZATION (ANO) 

--  DEMOCRATIC FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (DFLP) 

--  HIZBALLAH 

--  ISLAMIC GAMA\'AT (IG) 

--  ISLAMIC RESISTANCE MOVEMENT (HAMAS) 

--  JIHAD 

--  KACH 

--  KAHANE CHAI 

--  PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD-SHIQAQI FACTION (PIJ) 

--  PALESTINE LIBERATION FRONT-ABU ABBAS FACTION (PLF-ABU ABBAS) 

--  POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP) 

--  POPULAR FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE-GENERAL COMMAND     (PFLP-GC) 

OTHER GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DESIGNATED, AS 
NEEDED, IN ADMINISTERING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. 

--  THE PURPOSE OF THIS ORDER IS TO PREVENT FUNDING 
FROM U.S. SOURCES OF TERRORIST ACTIVITIES WHICH THREATEN 
TO DISRUPT THE PEACE PROCESS. 

--  THE ORDER WILL BAR CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS IN 
CASES WHERE THE RECEIVING ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGE IN 
TERRORISM OR ACT FOR THOSE THAT DO. 

--  (AS APPROPRIATE)  WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM 
OF FOREIGN FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THESE TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT IN THE PAST. 

--  (FOR ALL)  SUPPORT BY PRIVATE FOREIGN DONORS TO 
GROUPS WHICH ENGAGE IN TERRORISM AGAINST THE PEACE 
PROCESS IS AN INTERNATIONAL PROBLEM WHICH REQUIRES ALL 
OF US TO TAKE A COMMON APPROACH. 

--  WE ASK THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT ADOPT SIMILAR LEGAL 
MEASURES TO PREVENT PRIVATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ANY OF 
THESE ORGANIZATIONS, IF YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEY 
ARE RECEIVING FUNDS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FROM DONORS 
IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

--  WE BELIEVE SUCH AN INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE 
EFFORT, ON AN URGENT BASIS, WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE 
SUPPORT THESE GROUPS RECEIVE, AND THUS WEAKEN THEIR 
ABILITY TO CARRY OUT TERRORISTS ACTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO 
IMPROVING THE PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING A JUST, LASTING, 
AND COMPREHENSIVE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, A GOAL WE 
ALL SHARE. 
 
-------------- 
NEW LEGISLATION 
--------------- 

--  THE SECOND NEW U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM INITIATIVE 
ANNOUNCED JANUARY 24 IS NEW DRAFT LEGISLATION, A 
COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TO UPGRADE THE ABILITY OF THE U.S. 
TO DETECT TERRORIST ACTS AND PUNISH THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN 
TERRORISM.  THE PRESIDENT WILL SEND THIS TO THE CONGRESS 
SOON. 

--  THIS LEGISLATION IS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE 
ABILITY OF THE UNITED STATES, APPLYING THE RULE OF LAW, 
TO PREVENT TERRORIST ACTS, IDENTIFY PERPETRATORS, AND 
BRING THEM TO JUSTICE. 

--  THESE TWO INITIATIVES SHOW THE STRONG COMMITMENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS 
AND TO THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE HOPE YOUR 
GOVERNMENT WILL CONSIDER SIMILAR INITIATIVES.

CHALLENGES FACING MBEKI 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 

2.  INR\'S FEBRUARY 28 ASSESSMENT ENTITLED SOUTH AFRICA: 
CHALLENGES FACING MBEKI\" IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION AND COMMENT, AS APPROPRIATE. 

BEGIN TEXT 

3.  SUMMARY.  PRESIDENT MANDELA\'S FEBRUARY 15 
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT SEEK A SECOND TERM IN 
OFFICE HAS MADE DEPUTY PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI THE 
PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER IN SOUTH AFRICA\'S NEXT 
NATIONAL ELECTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR 1999.  GROWING RIFTS 
WITHIN THE ANC WILL INCREASINGLY TEST MBEKI\'S LEADERSHIP. 

4.  ONE MAJOR RIFT IS BETWEEN THE CURRENTLY PREVAILING 
MODERATES, LED BY MANDELA AND MBEKI, AND PARTY 
MILITANTS.  BUT AS ANC SUPPORTERS BECOME INCREASING 
FRUSTRATED WITH THE SLOW PACE OF REFORM, THE ANC IS 
COMING UNDER GROWING PRESSURE TO RADICALIZE ITS 
POLICIES, AND THE MILITANT RHETORIC OF A GROUP OF RISING 
STARS, INCLUDING WINNIE MANDELA, IS GAINING POPULARITY. 
ANOTHER SCHISM LIES BETWEEN THE SUPPORTERS OF MBEKI AND 
THOSE OF ANC SECRETARY-GENERAL CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, WHO IS 
MBEKI\'S STRONGEST COMPETITOR FOR SOUTH AFRICA\'S TOP 
LEADERSHIP POSITION. 

5.  THE POPULIST APPEAL.  BESIDES WINNIE MANDELA, THE 
ANC\'S \"POPULIST\" GROUPING INCLUDES THREE OTHER PARTY 
LEADERS WHOSE STATURE IN THE ANC IS NOT ACCURATELY 
REFLECTED BY THEIR CURRENT TITLES.  THEY ARE PETER 
MOKABA, PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON TOURISM CHAIRPERSON; 
BANTU HOLOMISA, DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS 
AND TOURISM; AND ROCKY MALEBANE-METSING, SPECIAL ADVISER 
TO THE NORTHWEST PROVINCE.  WITH THEIR OUTSPOKEN 
MILITANCY AND ADVOCACY OF RADICAL REDISTRIBUTION, THE 
FOUR HAVE ATTRACTED A LARGE FOLLOWING AMONG THE ANC\'S 
POOREST CONSTITUENCIES--SQUATTERS, RURAL DWELLERS, THE 
URBAN UNEMPLOYED, AND MARGINALIZED YOUTH.  THEIR APPEAL 
IS BROADENING DESPITE THE EMBROILMENT OF EACH IN WIDELY 
PUBLICIZED SCANDALS. 

6.  MRS. MANDELA, THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL OF THE FOUR, 
WAS CONVICTED IN 1993 OF KIDNAPPING AND ASSAULT, AND, 
ALONG WITH MOKABA AND MALEBANE-METSING, HAS FACED 
REPEATED CHARGES OF FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT.  HOLOMISA\'S 
DICTATORIAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE FORMER TRANSKEI 
HOMELAND HAS COME UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY.  EVEN SO, AT THE 
ANC\'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE LAST DECEMBER, HOLOMISA, 
MOKABA AND MRS. MANDELA WERE NOMINATED FIRST, THIRD AND 
FIFTH RESPECTIVELY FOR POSITIONS ON THE PARTY\'S NATIONAL 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.  THE ANC\'S POPULISTS ARE BUILDING A 
POWERFUL BASE OF SUPPORT THAT COULD, ONCE MANDELA STEPS 
DOWN, PLACE THEM IN A POSITION TO WIELD SIGNIFICANT 
INFLUENCE WITHIN THE PARTY AND THE GOVERNMENT. 

7.  AN UNEASY ALLIANCE.  MANDELA AND MBEKI CAN ILL 
AFFORD TO DISMISS THE POPULISTS\' WIDE APPEAL--MRS. 
MANDELA ALONE HAS THE SUPPORT OF PERHAPS 40 PERCENT OF 
THE ANC\'S CONSTITUENTS.  FOR HIS PART, MBEKI, WHOSE LONG 
YEARS IN EXILE LEFT HIM ISOLATED AND LARGELY UNKNOWN TO 
THE BLACK POPULATION, HAS ALLIED HIMSELF TO THE 
POPULISTS, DESPITE FUNDAMENTAL IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, 
TO GAIN POPULAR SUPPORT.  HIS STRATEGY HAS LARGELY PAID 
OFF, AND HE NOW ENJOYS THE WIDE ACCEPTANCE HE NEEDS AS 
MANDELA\'S HEIR APPARENT.  IF HE IS ELECTED PRESIDENT, 
MBEKI WILL COME UNDER GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE POPULISTS, 
WHOSE RISE IN THE GOVERNMENT MBEKI HAS FACILITATED, TO 
APPOINT THEM TO SENIOR CABINET POSTS, IN WHICH THEY WILL 
BE EVEN BETTER PLACED TO RADICALIZE ANC POLICIES. 

8.  RAMAPHOSA STILL STRONG.  MBEKI\'S ALLIANCES WITH THE 
POPULISTS HAVE GIVEN HIM THE EDGE OVER RAMAPHOSA, WHO 
BOWED OUT OF THE RUNNING FOR DEPUTY PRESIDENT AT THE 
LAST MINUTE, KNOWING THAT A MAJORITY OF ANC NATIONAL 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SUPPORT MBEKI.  NONETHELESS, 
RAMAPHOSA, WHO RUNS THE PARTY ORGANIZATION AND IS A 
MAJOR PLAYER IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL ASSEMBLY, REMAINS 
HIGHLY RESPECTED AMONG THE ANC SENIOR RANKS AND IS 
LIKELY TO CHALLENGE MBEKI FOR THE ANC\'S PRESIDENTIAL 
NOMINATION IN THE NEXT ELECTION. 

9.  RAMAPHOSA WOULD BE A FORMIDABLE RIVAL:  A PROMINENT 
LABOR LEADER DURING THE APARTHEID ERA, HE TRADITIONALLY 
HAS FAR GREATER SUPPORT THAN MBEKI AMONG GRASSROOTS ANC 
SUPPORTERS.

TAGS: PINR, SY 
SUBJECT: INTSUM: SYRIA - PEACE-PROCESS STAGNATION 
 
(TEXT) THE FOLLOWING IS AN INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT THAT 
RAN IN THE SECRETARY\'S MORNING SUMMARY ON THE DATE 
INDICATED.  IN THE INTEREST OF PROMOTING WIDER 
DISSEMINATION, CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS OF INFORMATION 
CANNOT BE INCLUDED. 
 
 
1. BEGIN SUMMARY.  SYRIA HAS TOUGHENED ITS PEACE-PROCESS 
POSITION SINCE THE SIGNING OF THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN 
INTERIM AGREEMENT. ASAD IS PROBABLY NOT CAPABLE OF 
MAKING THE GESTURES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO JUMP START 
THIS TRACK DURING AN ISRAELI ELECTION YEAR. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. THE SIGNING OF THE INTERIM AGREEMENT HAS INCREASED 
SYRIA\'S ISOLATION, AND THE AMMAN ECONOMIC SUMMIT, IN 
WHICH SYRIA WILL NOT PARTICIPATE, WILL INCREASE IT 
ANOTHER STEP. ASAD BELIEVES RABIN WILL EXPLOIT THIS 
DEEPENING ISOLATION AND THE UPCOMING ISRAELI ELECTIONS TO 
TRY TO WIN CONCESSIONS FROM DAMASCUS. IN RESPONSE, ASAD 
AND THE SENIOR SYRIAN LEADERSHIP HAVE DUG IN. 
 
3. IN A LENGTHY OCTOBER 11 INTERVIEW WITH THE EGYPTIAN 
DAILY AL-AHRAM, ASAD WAS AT HIS MOST STUBBORN. \"NO 
MATTER HOW THINGS CHANGE, WE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING WE DO 
NOT BELIEVE IN.\"  ISRAEL WAS AT FAULT IN THE CONTROVERSY 
OVER THE EARLY-WARNING STATIONS. ISRAELI-MANNED EARLY- 
WARNING STATIONS ON THE GOLAN WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT ON 
SYRIAN SOVEREIGNTY.   \"MEETING FOR THE SAKE OF MEETING\" 
BENEFITED ONLY ISRAEL. TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAD NO REASON 
TO MEET UNTIL POLITICAL DECISION-MAKERS HAVE MADE A 
DECISION. 
 
 
TONE MORE NEGATIVE 
 
4. FOREIGN MINISTER SHARA HAS USED A SHARPER TONE 
RECENTLY, TO PUT PRESSURE ON OTHER ARAB STATES AND THE 
PALESTINIANS NOT TO TAKE STEPS SYRIA SAYS WOULD HARM ITS 
NEGOTIATING POSITION. HE TOLD THE EGYPTIAN WEEKLY ROSE 
AL-YUSUF ON SEPTEMBER 30 THE AMMAN SUMMIT WOULD \"GREATLY 
HARM\" THE SYRIAN AND LEBANESE TRACKS AND THAT \"ECONOMIC 
COOPERATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND ANY ARAB COUNTRY WOULD 
WEAKEN SYRIAN\'S STANCE IN THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS.\" 
ARAB STATES, HE ASSERTED, WOULD \"FACE DANGERS\" IF ISRAEL 
SUCCEEDED IN CONCLUDING REGIONAL-COOPERATION AGREEMENTS 
IN AMMAN. AT THE UN ON OCTOBER 3 SHARA SAID SYRIA WOULD 
\"NEITHER SUPPORT NOR SEEK TO HAMPER REGIONAL AGREEMENTS\" 
BUT THAT \"ANY USE OF THESE AGREEMENTS TO HARM THE 
NATIONAL AND PAN-ARAB INTEREST AND RIGHTS OF SYRIA WILL 
COMPEL US TO RECONSIDER OUR POSITION. 
 
 
WHAT SYRIA CAN AND CANNOT DO 
 
5. BEYOND SUCH RHETORIC, SYRIA CAN DO LITTLE TO IMPEDE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JORDANIAN-ISRAELI TREATY OR THE 
ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN INTERIM AGREEMENT. THE PALESTINIAN 
REJECTIONIST GROUPS RESIDING IN DAMASCUS HAVE NEVER BEEN 
EFFECTIVE PLAYERS ON THE PALESTINIAN SCENE. ASAD APPEARS 
NOT TO DELUDE HIMSELF ON THIS POINT, AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
NO SIGNS THAT SYRIA HAS STEPPED UP ITS LIMITED SUPPORT TO 
THESE GROUPS. 
 
6. BUT SYRIA CAN PREVENT MOVEMENT ON THE ISRAELI- 
LEBANESE TRACK AND SLOW NORMALIZATION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND 
THE WIDER ARAB WORLD.  OTHER ARAB STATES BELIEVE THE 
SYRIAN-ISRAELI TRACK MUST BE SOLVED BEFORE A TRULY NEW 
DYNAMIC CAN BE UNLEASHED IN THE AREA. SYRIA PLAYS ON 
WIDESPREAD ARAB FEARS OF THE \"DANGER\" TO THE REGION OF A 
STRENGTHENED ISRAEL AND ON ANTI-ISRAELI SENTIMENT 
PREVALENT AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION IN MOST ARAB 
COUNTRIES TO KEEP ARAB NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL AT BAY. 
MEANWHILE IT WILL URGE EGYPT TO SUPPORT SYRIA PUBLICLY 
AND LOBBY WASHINGTON ON ITS BEHALF. 
 
 
STEADFAST SYRIA 
 
7. ASAD\'S RIGID VIEW OF WHAT IS NEEDED (COMPLIANCE WITH 
242 AND 338, I. E., FULL ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
TERRITORY ISRAEL OCCUPIED IN 1967) PRECLUDES HIM FROM 
OFFERING THE PUBLIC DIPLOMACY GESTURES - MUCH LESS 
SUBSTANTIVE CONCESSIONS - NEEDED TO GET THE BALL ROLLING. 
ASAD BELIEVES THAT ANY GESTURE HE MIGHT OFFER, EVEN 
PROCEDURAL, IN THE ABSENCE OF CONCRETE ASSURANCES THAT 
THE GOLAN WILL BE RETURNED IN FULL WOULD BE A MAJOR AND 
UNREQUITED CONCESSION TO ISRAEL. CONSTRAINED FROM ACTION 
BY THIS VIEW, HE WAITS FOR THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE THE 
FIRST GESTURE AND BROKER THE GRAND DEAL OF FULL 
WITHDRAWAL FOR FULL PEACE. 
 
8. WITHOUT A US-BROKERED SETTLEMENT, SYRIA WILL CONTENT 
ITSELF WITH PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE TO THE PROCESS AND 
REITERATING A POSITION THAT HAS CHANGED LITTLE SINCE THE 
1991 MADRID CONFERENCE: SYRIA WANTS PEACE (ON ITS OWN 
TERMS); ISRAEL\'S \"IMPOSSIBLE DEMANDS11 ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE LACK OF PROGRESS; THE UNITED STATES MUST INTERCEDE 
WITH ISRAEL IF PEACE IS TO BE ACHIEVED; AND \"NO PEACE\" IS 
BETTER THAN \"PEACE WITHOUT HONOR.\" (DRAFTED OCTOBER 20 
BY INR/NESA: CONNY MAYER)

1.  SECRET ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING INR ASSESSMENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE 
OFFICE OF EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC AND IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION AND COMMENT. 
 
3.  (SUMMARY) PYONGYANG\'S ECONOMIC DISTRESS AND 
CONTINUING POLITICAL PARALYSIS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHETHER THE CURRENT NORTH KOREAN REGIME CAN LAST THE 
WINTER. IF PRAGMATISTS IN THE LEADERSHIP ARE UNABLE TO 
SHOW TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM THE AGREED FRAMEWORK SOON, 
CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF THE ECONOMY AND WORSENING FOOD 
SHORTAGES COULD PROMPT A TAKEOVER BY MILITARY HARDLINERS. 
 
THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY ARE NOT \"MODERNIZERS\"--THEIR 
COMING TO POWER WOULD GREATLY RAISE TENSIONS AND SHARPLY 
INCREASE THE DANGER OF WAR. THERE IS EVIDENCE OF CONCERN 
WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OVER THE MILITARY\'S INTENTIONS. 
 
4. WE DISAGREE WITH ASSESSMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM SOUTH 
KOREA, THAT PERSONNEL CHANGES IN THE NORTH IN MID-OCTOBER 
HAVE ALREADY PUT THE MILITARY IN CONTROL. THE NORTH\'S 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH KEDO AND THE CLEAR, CONSISTENT SIGNALS 
IT IS SENDING SUPPORTING THE AGREED FRAMEWORK SUGGEST 
THAT, SO FAR, THE AGREEMENT\'S FOES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
DERAIL IT OR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPEDE ITS IMPLEMENTATION. 
 
UNCOMMON FLEXIBILITY. 
 
5. THE NORTH\'S DELEGATES TO THE KEDO TALKS INSISTED 
CRITICS WERE PRESSING THEM TO SECURE AN LWR SUPPLY 
AGREEMENT, BUT USED THE POINT LESS TO PRESSURE KEDO THAN 
AS A RATIONALE FOR MODIFYING THEIR OWN NEGOTIATING 
POSITION. 
 
6. OTHER SIGNALS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THIS 
INTERPRETATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE PARTY\'S 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY FETE ON OCTOBER 10, THE MAIN SPEECH, 
DELIVERED BY THE NEW DEFENSE MINISTER, CRITICIZED NEITHER 
THE US OR THE AGREED FRAMEWORK. 
 
KEEPING A FIREBREAK. 
 
7. THOSE BACKING THE AGREEMENT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ISOLATE 
THE KEDO TALKS FROM THE HARSH RHETORICAL EXCHANGES 
BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH. THE NORTH\'S VENOMOUS 
RESPONSE TO PROVOCATIVE ROK STATEMENTS HAS NOT KEPT IT 
FROM NEGOTIATING ACROSS THE TABLE WITH ROK DELEGATES. 
SUCH COMPARTMENTALIZATION OF ISSUES IS RARE DURING A TRUE 
CRISIS OR POLICY REVERSAL. 
 
LEADERSHIP LOGJAM. 
 
8. WE BELIEVE THE DPRK LEADERSHIP IS SHARPLY DIVIDED, 
AND THAT THE FRAMEWORK IS A SYMBOL OF WHAT ITS CRITICS 
FEAR (AND ITS PROPONENTS HOPE) WILL BECOME THE NEW 
REGIME\'S DIRECTION ON A BROAD RANGE OF FOREIGN AND 
DOMESTIC ISSUES. 
 
9. PRAGMATISTS SEEM TO FEAR A LOSS OF MOMENTUM IN THE 
FRAMEWORK PROCESS, WHICH WOULD UNDERCUT THEIR ARGUMENT 
THAT THE AGREEMENT BRINGS TANGIBLE BENEFITS TO THE NORTH. 
THEY APPARENTLY SOLD THE AGREED FRAMEWORK AS A GOOD 
BARGAIN--THE START OF A PROCESS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A 
LESSENING OF MILITARY PRESSURES AND INCREASED FOREIGN 
ECONOMIC COOPERATION. NOW, THEY ARE UNDER ATTACK FOR 
HAVING COMPROMISED DPRK SECURITY AND GAINED LITTLE IN 
RETURN. 
 
10. SHOWDOWN APPROACHING? A LENGTHY ARTICLE IN THE 
PARTY NEWSPAPER EARLY THIS MONTH SUGGESTS THAT A SHOWDOWN 
IS NEARING. IN DISCUSSING THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET 
UNION, THE ARTICLE ALLUDED TO KHRUSHCHEV\'S DE 
STALINIZATION CAMPAIGN, ARGUING THAT \"ENEMIES AT HOME AND 
ABROAD, USING THE ALLEGED PERSONALITY CULT AS AN EXCUSE, 
LAUNCHED ATTACKS AND COMMITTED TRAITOROUS ACTS TO DAMAGE 
HIS (STALIN\'S) AUTHORITY; THE COUNTRY WAS RUINED WHEN HIS 
IDEAS AND ACHIEVEMENT WERE COMPLETELY REJECTED AND 
NEGATED.\"  THE ARTICLE WENT ON TO WARN AGAINST HAVING 
\"ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE ENEMY\'S CONSPIRATORIAL PEACE 
OVERTURES.\" 
 
11. THE ARTICLE APPEARS TO BE AN ESCALATION OF THE LONG- 
RUNNING DEBATE BETWEEN THE REGIME\'S PRAGMATISTS AND 
HARDLINERS. IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, REFERENCES TO A 
 \"PERSONALITY CULT\" AND DE-STALINIZATION COUPLED WITH 
WARNINGS ABOUT THE ENEMY\'S \"PEACE STRATEGY\" ARE THE 
POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF NUCLEAR WARFARE. THE ARTICLE 
NECESSARILY RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHO--ASSUMING IT IS 
NOT KIM JONG IL--IS BEING SET UP TO PLAY THE ROLE OF 
KHRUSHCHEV. 
 
12. SUCH RHETORIC SUGGESTS THAT THE SITUATION IS MOVING 
TOWARD A SHOWDOWN. KIM JONG IL, WHOM INR BELIEVES LEANS 
TOWARD HIS MORE PRAGMATIC ADVISORS, WOULD NO DOUBT LIKE 
TO RESOLVE IT WITHOUT FIREWORKS. NEVERTHELESS, EVERYONE 
IN THE LEADERSHIP (KIM MOST OF ALL) KNOWS THAT KIM IL 
SUNG HAD TO PUT DOWN SEVERAL COUP ATTEMPTS IN THE LATE 
195 OS BEFORE FIRMLY ESTABLISHING HIS POSITION. 
 
13. PRESSURE INCREASING. THE CHANCES OF A NEARTERM 
SHOWDOWN ARE INCREASED BY UNREMITTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC 
STRAINS AND POLITICAL PRESSURES GENERATED BY THE SLOW- 
MOTION SUCCESSION. A HARSH WINTER, PUSHING THE ECONOMY 
AND SOCIAL CONTROLS TO THE BREAKING POINT, WOULD PROBABLY 
BE MORE THAN THE FRAGILE POLITICAL SYSTEM COULD ENDURE. 
BY SPRING, FOOD SHORTAGES MAY BE THE WORST SINCE THE 
KOREAN WAR. 
 
14. PARTICULARLY DISTURBING IS EVIDENCE THAT THE CENTER 
IS NO LONGER ABLE TO HANDLE THE FOOD SITUATION AND IS 
TELLING LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT THEY ARE ON THEIR OWN. 
THAT MESSAGE WILL SEND SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE POLITICAL 
SYSTEM AND SORELY TEST SOCIAL CONTROL MECHANISMS. 
 
15.   WILL THE GENERALS STEP IN? SUCH A SCENARIO IS 
UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO A SOFT LANDING\"--THAT IS, PEACEFUL 
TRANSFORMATION AND EVENTUAL REUNIFICATION WITH THE SOUTH. 
RATHER, A SHARPLY DETERIORATING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL 
SITUATION IS LIKELY TO TRIGGER A TAKEOVER BY HARDLINE 
MILITARY ELEMENTS--\"TRUE BELIEVERS,\" FOR WHOM DISCIPLINE 
AND MORAL RECTITUDE CAN OVERCOME ANY ADVERSITY, AND WHO 
SEE COMPROMISE WITH \"EVIL\" AS DEFEAT. 
 
16.   FOR YEARS, THESE HARDLINERS HAVE BEEN CHAFING AT 
WHAT THEY SEE AS A DANGEROUS DRIFT TOWARD POLICIES OF 
OPENING AND REFORM.  THEY HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY ALARMED BY 
EVENTS SINCE THE DEATH OF KIM IL SUNG. NEVER HAPPY WITH 
THE SUCCESSION PLANS, THEY HAVE WATCHED WITH 
CONSTERNATION AS KIM JONG IL HAS MOVED STEP-BY-STEP 
TOWARDS AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE US AND EXPERIMENTATION 
WITH ECONOMIC REFORM. 
 
17.   UP TO NOW, KIM, LIKE HIS FATHER, HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
KEEP THE MOST CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS IN LINE. BUT 
PRAGMATISTS IN THE REGIME FEAR THAT, IF THINGS REMAIN AS 
THEY ARE, HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH LONGER. A

2.  DEPARTMENT NOTES THAT NON-SADC MEMBER ZAIRE IS 
PARTICIPATING IN THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN POWER POOL (SAPP), 
AND UNDERSTANDS THAT ZAIRE MAY HAVE EVEN APPROACHED SADC 
TO INQUIRE ABOUT MEMBERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY.  THE 
DEPARTMENT DOES NOT CARE TO COMMENT ON THE MERITS OF 
ZAIRIAN PARTICIPATION IN EITHER OF THESE VENTURES. 
HOWEVER, WE ARE CURIOUS ABOUT SADC\'S VIEWS OF ZAIRE\'S 
INTERNAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION GLEANED FROM 
THESE INTERACTIONS, AND WONDER WHETHER THESE EVOLVING 
TIES MIGHT EVENTUALLY CONSTITUTE AN AVENUE OF LEVERAGE 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZAIRE. 

3.  EMBASSY GABORONE IS REQUESTED AT AN APPROPRIATE 
OCCASION TO SOLICIT SADC\'S VIEWS ON ZAIRE, WITH 
PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO ITS INTERNAL POLITICAL AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS.  EMBASSY SHOULD CONVEY U.S. 
CONCERN THAT THE ZAIRIAN GOVERNMENT AND BOTH POLITICAL 
\"FAMILIES\" (ALLIANCES OF POLITICAL PARTIES) WORK 
SERIOUSLY TO ADVANCE THE DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, A PROCESS 
WE VIEW AS AN INDISPENSABLE COUNTERPART TO ZAIRE\'S 
ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT.  IN ITS 
CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH ZAIRE, SADC MIGHT WISH TO 
STRESS THAT SAME LINKAGE.

DEPARTMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLES ARISING 
FROM THE BEIJING CONFERENCE ON IMPROVING THE STATUS OF 
WOMEN AND SEEKS YOUR ASSISTANCE IN POSSIBLE FOLLOW-ON 
ACTIVITIES IN THE SADC REGION. THE STATUS OF WOMEN 
THROUGHOUT THE SADC REGION, IN VARIOUS RESPECTS, CAN ONLY 
BE DEEMED SECOND-CLASS. IN MANY COUNTRIES WOMEN SUFFER 
DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF BOTH LAW AND PRACTICE. EVEN IN 
STATES IN WHICH GENDER EQUALITY IS MANDATED BY THE 
CONSTITUTION OR LEGISLATION, WOMEN STRUGGLE AGAINST THE 
FORMIDABLE FORCES OF SOCIETAL CUSTOM AND TRADITION. 
POSTS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS HAVE DETAILED MANY ONGOING 
SUCH PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF INHERITANCE, 
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP, FINANCIAL/CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS, AND THE 
ABILITY TO PASS CITIZENSHIP TO CHILDREN. 
 
3. SIGNS OF PROGRESS: DESPITE THE GENERALLY DISMAL 
PICTURE, WE HAVE SEEN SOME RECENT SIGNS OF PROGRESS. WE 
NOTE WITH INTEREST REF B \"NAMIBIA: PARLIAMENT PASSES

DELEGATIONS FROM THE SADC COUNTRIES PROVIDED SURPRISINGLY 
STRONG AND DYNAMIC LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. WE HOPE TO 
BUILD ON THIS SOLID FOUNDATION AND NOT ALLOW THE MOMENTUM

4. ACTION REQUEST: WE WOULD APPRECIATE RESPONSES TO THE 
FOLLOWING QUERIES REGARDING THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN HOST 
COUNTRIES TO HELP US MORE FULLY GRASP THE CURRENT 
SITUATION AND TO GAUGE WHAT WE MIGHT PRODUCTIVELY DO IN 
THIS AREA. 
 
-- IS THERE ANY CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT DISCRIMINATES 
AGAINST WOMEN? IF SO, HOW? 
 
-- WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF \"CUSTOMARY LAW\" REGARDING 
WOMEN?  IF \"CUSTOMARY LAW\" AND MODERN STATUTE VARY, HOW 
ARE DIFFERENCES RESOLVED? 
 
-- WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF DIVERGENCE, IF 
ANY, BETWEEN LAW AND PRACTICE REGARDING THE LEGAL STATUS 
OF WOMEN? 
 
-- HAS THE HOST GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT 
THE PLAN OF ACTION FROM THE BEIJING CONFERENCE? 
 
-- IF SO, WHAT STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN? WOULD AN 
INFORMATION-GATHERNING QUERY FROM YOUR EMBASSY SPUR ACTION? 
 
-- IF NOT, WOULD IT HELP FOR YOU TO RAISE THE ISSUE WITH 
HOST-GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS? 
 
-- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL WAYS YOUR POST COULD UTILIZE 
116(E), SELF-HELP, D/G PROGRAMS, ETC TO SUPPORT PROGRESS 
IN THIS AREA? WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE? 
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE PROGRAMS BY 
PROMOTING THEM THROUGH PUBLIC DIPLOMACY, SUCH AS BY PUBLIC 
 
ANNOUNCEMENTS OR CEREMONIES TO MARK PROGRAM FUND AWARDS? 
-- FOR GABORONE:  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS SADC DOING TO 
FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE BEIJING CONFERENCE? IS POST IN 
CONTACT WITH SADC SECRETARIAT ON THIS ISSUE? WILL IT BE 
ON THE AGENDA OF THE AUGUST SADC SUMMIT IN MASERU? 
 
-- FOR GABORONE:  TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE SOUTHERN AFRICA 
REGIONAL DEMOCRATIZATION FUND PROMOTING THE STATUS OF 
WOMEN IN THE AREA? (NOTE: COULD SARDF, FOR EXAMPLE, HELP 
NETWORK NGO LEADERS IN NAMIBIA, WHO RECENTLY CARRIED THE 
DAY IN THEIR LANDMARK LEGISLATIVE EFFORT, WITH 
COUNTERPARTS ELSEWHERE IN THE REGION?) 
 
-- WHAT COULD THE DEPARTMENT, ALONE OR IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
YOUR POST (BEARING IN MIND OUR BUDGETARY SITUATION), DO TO 
IMPROVE THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN THE SADC REGION? 
 
S. WE LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR ASSESSMENTS AND 
INSIGHTS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. REGARDS.

NAIROBI FOR AMB. CARNEY 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY LEE 0. COLDREN, DIRECTOR, SA/PAB, 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE. REASON: 1.5(D). 
 
2.  (C) SUMMARY: OSAMA BIN LADEN ASKED THE NANGARHAR SHURA 
FOR PERMISSION TO REMAIN IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES OF 
AFGHANISTAN, ACCORDING TO AN EASTERN SHURA OFFICIAL 
VISITING THE U.S. AFTER DELIBERATIONS IN LATE JULY-EARLY 
AUGUST, THE SHURA DECIDED THAT BIN LADEN WOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWED TO LIVE IN OR WORK IN TERRITORY UNDER ITS CONTROL. 
BIN LADEN THEN LEFT FOR KABUL WHERE HE REPORTEDLY STILL 
REMAINS.   END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C) NANGARHAR PROVINCIAL MINISTER OF DISABLED PERSONS 
AND ORPHANS COMMANDER ABDUL SADAQAT TOLD AFGHAN DESKOFF 
CHEW ON AUGUST 26 IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT OFFICIALS IN THE 
NANGARHAR SHURA OPPOSED TERRORISM AND THE USE OF AFGHAN 
TERRITORY FOR PURPOSES OF TERRORISM.  AS AN ILLUSTRATION, 
HE SAID, AN ARAB HAD CAME TO NANGARHAR IN LATE JULY WITH 
EXPLOSIVES. HE SAID THAT THE ARAB WAS LOOKING FOR SUPPORT 
AMONG AFGHANS FOR HIS INTENDED TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. 
HOWEVER, HE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE 
ARAB WAS KILLED, APPARENTLY BY ONE OF HIS OWN BOMBS. 
 
4. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN HAD 
MOVED TO AFGHANISTAN, COMMANDER SADAQAT CONFIRMED BIN 
LADEN\'S PRESENCE. SADAQAT SAID THAT BIN LADEN HAD SENT A 
REPRESENTATIVE TO JALALABAD TO ASK THE NANGARHAR SHURA 
(COUNCIL) FOR SAFEHAVEN FOR BIN LADEN.  THE COUNCIL MET IN 
LATE JULY-EARLY AUGUST; IT DECIDED THAT BIN LADEN WOULD NOT 
BE ALLOWED TO WORK OR LIVE IN THEIR TERRITORY. SADAQAT 
SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT BIN LADEN THEN WENT TO KABUL 
WHERE HE REMAINS. (COMMENT: BIN LADEN HAS HAD A LONG 
RELATIONSHIP WITH NOW PRIME MINISTER HEKMATYAR. END 
COMMENT.) 
 
5. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT BIN LADEN\'S ARAB FOLLOWERS, SADAQAT 
SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT IN NANGARHAR, BUT IN SAROBI 
(HEKMATYAR\'S STRONGHOLD).   HE SAID NANGARHAR OFFICIALS WILL 
NOT ALLOW \"THESE PEOPLE\" TO LIVE IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES. 
SADAQAT SAID THAT AFGHANS WERE ALREADY LIVING IN AN 
\"EMERGENCY SITUATION\" AND DID NOT NEED MORE PROBLEMS.  HE 
RECOUNTED A RUMOR THAT SOME ARABS HAD MOVED TO PAGHMAN IN 
ORDER TO BE NEARER THE KABUL AUTHORITIES, HELP THEM WITH 
FOOD SUPPLIES, AND OTHERWISE EASE THEIR BURDEN. (COMMENT: 
KABUL HAS BEEN UNDER SEIGE BY THE TALL BAN SINCE LAST 
OCTOBER. JUST TWO DAYS AGO, THE ROAD TO MAIDAN SHAHR WAS 
CUT DUE TO FIGHTING BETWEEN PRO-KABUL TROOPS AND THE 
TALIBAN. THE ROAD IS A MAJOR ARTERY FOR FOODSTUFFS,  FUEL, 
LIVESTOCK AND OTHER NECESSITIES REACHING KABUL. END 
COMMENT.) 
 
6. (C)   BIO NOTE: COMMANDER SAYED HOSSEINI ABDUL SADAQAT 
IS CONFINED TO A WHEELCHAIR, PARALYZED FROM A BULLET WOUND 
DURING THE SOVIET OCCUPATION. HE IS A RESPECTED TRIBAL 
LEADER AND MEMBER OF THE 18-MAN BLACK MOUNTAIN COUNCIL. HE 
IS ALSO A MEMBER OF KHALIS\'S HEZB-I-ISLAMI FACTION. 
AVOWEDLY PRO-U.S., HE HAS MADE HIS FIRST TRIP TO THE U.S. 
TO ACCOMPANY THE AFGHAN AND PAKISTANI PARALYMPICS ATHLETES 
TO EVENTS IN ATLANTA AND SAN FRANCISCO. WE BELIEVE HIM TO 
BE A CREDIBLE SOURCE. HE DOES NOT SPEAK ENGLISH.

-- YOUR RECENT SUCCESSES IN EASTERN AFGHANISTAN MEAN THAT A 
NUMBER OF TERRORIST OR MILITANT TRAINING CAMPS RUN BY 
HEKMATYAR, SAYYAF OR ARAB GROUPS HAVE OR WILL COME UNDER 
YOUR CONTROL. 
 
-- THERE WERE REPORTS THAT TALIBAN FORCES HAD CAPTURED 
SAYYAF\'S CAMP AT SHAMSHAD, NEAR TORKHAM AT THE BORDER. 
ALSO, YOU NOW ALSO CONTROL THE DARUNTA AREA WHERE THERE IS 
A MILITANT CAMP RUN BY FOREIGNERS (ARABS). HAVE YOU TAKEN 
CONTROL OF THESE AND OTHER CAMPS IN PAKTIA AND ELSEWHERE? 
 
-- WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL ACT TO CLOSE THESE CAMPS, REQUEST 
THE DEPARTURE FROM AFGHANISTAN OF NON-AFGHAN MILITANTS AND 
COOPERATE IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS AGAINST TERRQRISM. 
 
-- RECURRENT REPORTS OF THE PRESENCE OF EX-SAUDI FINANCIER 
AND RADICAL ISLAMIST OSAMA BIN LADEN ALSO CONCERN US. HE 
IS SAID TO BE IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES, MOVING FROM CAMP TO 
CAMP.

OSAMA BIN LADEN IN AFGHANISTAN IS NOT A POSITIVE

BETTER ASSESS THEIR VIEWS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE

WHATEVER INFLUENCE THEY MAY HAVE WITH THE TALIBAN TO PRESS 
THEM TO STOP THE FIGHTING IN THE NORTH AND TO REACH A 
POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION WITH MASOOD AND DOSTAM TOWARDS 
BUILDING A GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION. 
CONTINUING THE FIGHTING IS DESTABLIZING TO THE REGION AND 
RISKS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY.   THE RUSSIANS AND 
THE CENTRAL ASIANS HAVE ALL REACTED STRONGLY TO THE 
PERCEIVED TALIBAN THREAT.   POST SHOULD INQUIRE AS TO SAUDI 
PLANS TO ENGAGE WITH THE TALIBAN AUTHORITIES IN KABUL. 
POST MAY WISH TO DRAW ON GENERAL TALKING POINTS TO BE SENT 
BY SEPTEL,  PREVIOUS GUIDANCE IN REFS A AND B AND THEN FOCUS 
ON THE SUGGESTED POINTS BELOW. 
 
5.   (C)  SUGGESTED TALKING POINTS: 
 
 
RUSSIAN AND CENTRAL ASIAN CONCERNS 
 
--   THE RUSSIANS AND THE CENTRAL ASIAN STATES HAVE ALL 
CONVEYED TO US THEIR CONCERNS OVER THE TAKEOVER OF KABUL BY 
THE TALIBAN AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF TALIBAN RULE IN 
AFGHANISTAN FOR REGIONAL STABILITY. 
 
--   THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE MOVES NORTHWARD, 
PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE TAJIK BORDER.   IN RESPONSE, 
PRESIDENT YELTSIN CALLED A SUMMIT OF THE CIS STATES THAT 
WAS HELD IN ALMATY OCTOBER 4-5. 
 
--   THE SUMMIT CALLED ON THE AFGHAN RIVAL PARTIES TO STOP 
THE FIGHTING AND TO NEGOTIATE.   THE CIS LEADERS WARNED 
THAT THEY WILL TAKE MEASURES TO REINFORCE THEIR BORDERS, 
AND THEY RESERVED THE RIGHT TO \"TAKE ADEQUATE MEASURES\" 
SHOULD AFGHANISTAN\'S HOSTILITIES SPILL OVER THE BORDER. 
 
 
URGE AN END TO THE FIGHTING 
 
--   WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH A TALIBAN REPRESENTATIVE IN 
ISLAMABAD.   WE URGED THE TALIBAN IMMEDIATELY TO REACH A 
POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION WITH BOTH DOSTAM AND MASOOD. 
 
--   WE ARGUED THAT AN EXPANSION OF THE FIGHTING INTO 
NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN WOULD COMPOUND THE ANXIETIES OF 
AFGHANISTAN\'S NORTHERN NEIGHBORS WHO ALREADY PERCEIVE THE 
TALIBAN TO BE A THREAT TO THEIR STABILITY AND WAY OF LIFE. 
 
--   WE ALSO WARNED THAT CONTINUED FIGHTING COULD 
PRECIPITATE AN UNWANTED INTERVENTION BY RUSSIA,  IRAN, OR 
SOME OF THE CENTRAL ASIAN STATES.   SUCH A DEVELOPMENT WOULD 
NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF EITHER THE TALIBAN OR 
AFGHANISTAN AS A WHOLE. 
 
--   THE TALIBAN REPRESENTATIVE\'S RESPONSE WAS THAT THE 
TALL BAN HAVE \"NO PROBLEM\" WITH EITHER DOS TAM OR THE AFGHAN 
TAJIKS.   HOWEVER, THEY DO NOT TRUST MASOOD AND INSISTED HE 
WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH.   DOSTAM WOULD NEED TO DISARM 
HIS FORCES AS PART OF A DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN.   AT THE 
PRESENT TIME, THE TALIBAN ARE NOT PLANNING TO PUT ?RESSURE 
ON THE HAZARA SHIAS. 
 
--   THIS RESPONSE IS LESS THAN REASSURING TO US AND OTHERS 
WHO FEAR THE SPREAD OF GREATER INSTABILITY IN THE REGION 
AND WHO BELIEVE THAT A MILITARY SOLUTION IS NOT A LONG TERM 
SOLUTION FOR AFGHANISTAN. 
 
--   WE ASK THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT USE WHATEVER INFLUENCE IT 
HAS WITH THE TALL BAN TO STRESS THAT CONTINUED FIGHTING 
INVITES GREATER INSTABILITY,  POSSIBLE ACTIVE INTERVENTION 
BY FOREIGN POWERS AND RISKS AN ETHNIC DIVISION OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
 
TERRORISM 
 
--   WE ALSO SEEK YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S ASSISTANCE IN 
ENCOURAGING THE TALIBAN TO CLOSE TERRORIST/MILITANT 
TRAINING CAMPS IN TERRITORY THEY CONTROL AND TO EXPEL NON- 
AFGHANS INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. 
 
--   WE HAVE HEARD CONFLICTING REPORTS ON THE WHEREABOUTS OF 
OSAMA BIN LADEN.   HE MIGHT STILL BE IN TALIBAN-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY.   WE HAVE CONVEYED TO THE TALIBAN AND OTHER 
AFGHAN LEADERS THAT THE PRESENCE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN IS NOT 
HELPFUL TO AFGHANISTAN. 
 
 
FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH 
 
--   ON ONE FINAL MATTER REGARDING FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH, 
WE WISH TO CLARIFY OUR POSITION ON HIS POSSIBLE RETURN TO 
AFGHANISTAN.   WE DO NOT OPPOSE HIS DESIRE TO RETURN TO 
AFGHANISTAN TO HELP REUNIFY THE COUNTRY. 
 
-- IN FACT, WE WOULD NOT OPPOSE THE EFFORTS OF ANY 
INDIVIDUAL WHO COULD BRING ABOUT A PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN 
UNDER A STABLE, REPRESENTATIVE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.

ENOUGH DETAIL TO MAKE CLEAR THAT U.S. CONCERNS REGARDING 
IRAN ARE WELL-FOUNDED.    THIS CABLE IS BEING SHARED WITH 
OTH~R POSTS IN THE REGION FOR GENERAL INTEREST AND 
INFORMATION.    THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS CLASSIFIED SECRET, 
RELEASABLE TO SENIOR HOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AS DEEMED 
APPROPRIATE. 
 
 
 ----------------------TEAR LINE------------------------- 
 
IRAN:   INTERNAL DEVELOPNENTS 
 
3.    (S)  ELECTIONS.  THE SECOND ROUND OF VOTING FOR THE 
FIFTH NAJLIS IN APRIL SAW THE DEFEAT OF PRESIDENT 
RAFSANJANI\'S FACTION; THE CONSERVATIVES REASSERTED SOME 
MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE NAJLIS, ALTHOUGH BY A 
NARROWER MAJORITY, WITH NATEG-NURI RE-ELECTED AS SPEAKER. 
SUBSEQUENT SPECULATION ABOUT MODIFYING THE CONSTITUTION 
TO ALLOW RAFSANJANI TO RUN A THIRD TERM WAS EFFECTIVELY 
SUPPRESSED WITH SUPREME LEADER KHAMENEI\'S PUBLIC 
PRONOUNCEMENT THAT ANOTHER SUITABLE POST WOULD BE FOUND 
FOR RAFSANJANI.   NATEQ-NURI, BENEFITTING FROM A RECENT 
RESURGENCE OF CLERICAL FORCES, HAS EMERGED AS THE 
PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER. 
 
--    THERE IS LITTLE TO SUGGEST THAT ANY MAJOR FACTION 
WITHIN THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT COULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS 
\"MODERATE\" WITH REGARD TO SUCH ISSUES AS TERRORISM, HUMAN 
RIGHTS, OPPOSITION TO THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS, OR 
PURSUIT OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
 
--    FOR THAT REASON, WE ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE UPCOMING 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,  REGARDLESS OF VICTOR, WILL RESULT 
IN IRANIAN POLICIES THAT WOULD LEAD TOWARD RESPECT OF 
OTHER NATIONS.   INDEED, UNDER NATEQ-NURI, IRAN COULD 
REGRESS IN SOME AREAS. 
 
4.    (S)  HUMAN RIGHTS.  TEHRAN\'S MANIPULATION OF THE 
ELECTION PROCESS TO ELIMINATE ROUGHLY 40 PERCENT OF 
PROSPECTIVE CANDIDATES TO THE NAJLIS SUSTAINED THE 
DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF SIGNIFICANT SEGMENTS OF THE VOTING 
POPULATION, AND MEDIA CENSORSHIP, HARASSMENT OF ACADEMIC 
FIGURES, AND PERSECUTION OF RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES-- 
PARTICULARLY BAHA\'IS--ARE MATTERS OF PUBLIC RECORD.  LESS 
WELL-KNOWN ARE IRANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES INCLUDING 
SUMMARY EXECUTIONS, TORTURE AND INHUMAN PUNISHMENTS, 
ARBITRARY ARRESTS, AND UNEXPLAINED DISAPPEARANCES.  THE 
UN SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAN HAS 
JUST ISSUED HIS REPORT; IRAN HAS ALREADY BEGUN A 
PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN TO DISCREDIT THAT REPORT AND ITS 
AUTHOR. 
 
EXTERNAL RELATIONS 
 
5.    (S)  DIPLOMACY CAMPAIGN.  TEHRAN RECENTLY HAS 
BLITZED THE ENTIRE REGION WITH WIDELY PUBLICIZED VISITS 
BY PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT,  IN PARTICULAR 
VICE PRESIDENT HABIBI, FOREIGN MINISTER VELAYATI, AND 
DEPUTY FOREIGN NINISTER VAEZI, TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE, 
CREATE OPENINGS, AND ENGENDER TIES WITH ITS NEIGHBORS BY 
PROMOTING CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND PROMISING ECONOMIC AND 
TRADE BENEFITS.   SIMILAR EFFORTS HAVE RANGED BEYOND THE 
REGION TO EUROPE, RUSSIA, AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, AND THE 
FAR EAST AS IRAN TRIES TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS AN EMERGING 
WORLD POWER. 
 
--    IN OFFICIAL FRIDAY SERMONS AND SPEECHES BY ITS 
HIGHEST LEADERS, TEHRAN CONTINUALLY STRESSES THE 
CONVICTION THAT IRAN HOLDS MORAL TITLE TO SPIRITUAL 
LEADERSHIP IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD AND MUST SPREAD ITS 
VERSION OF ISLAMIC \"REVOLUTION.\" 
 
6.    (S)  REGIONAL ENTANGLEMENTS.  TEHRAN CONTINUES TO 
INVOLVE ITSELF IN SEVERAL REGIONAL CONFLICTS.   IN 
NORTHERN IRAQ,  IRAN\'S JULY CROSS-BORDER MILITARY 
EXPEDITION AGAINST THE KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN 
(KDP-I) AND SUBSEQUENT HEAVY MILITARY SUPPORT OF ONE 
KURDISH FACTION GAVE BAGHDAD AN EXCUSE TO REENTER THE 
NORTH AND ONCE AGAIN THREATEN THE KURDS.   IN AFGHANISTAN, 
IRAN HAS PUBLICLY PROFESSED SUPPORT OF A PEACEFUL 
SOLUTION UNDER A BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT AND THE UN 
SPECIAL MISSION, BUT HAS SECRETLY PROVIDED ARMS AND 
PROMOTED AN ANTI-TALEBAN COALITION.   IN TAJIKISTAN, 
TEHRAN CLAIMS THE ROLE OF PEACE BROKER WHILE SUPPORTING 
THE OPPOSITION.   IN THE GULF, IRAN HAS HELPED FOMENT 
GREATER UNREST, RECRUITING AND TRAINING DISSIDENTS. 
 
TERRORISM 
 
7.    (S)  TOOL OF STATECRAFT.  SINCE THE CLERICS CAME TO 
POWER,  IRAN AND ITS SURROGATES HAVE CONDUCTED 
KIDNAPPINGS, ASSASSINATIONS, AND BOMBINGS;  IRAN HAS ALSO 
PROVIDED CRITICAL TRAINING, FINANCING, AND ARMS TO GROUPS 
ENGAGED IN INDISCRIMINATE VIOLENCE FOR POLITICAL GOALS. 
THESE ACTIVITIES ARE NEITHER ABERRATIONS NOR EXCEPTIONS, 
BUT ARE CONDUCTED WITH FULL APPROVAL BY THE MOST SENIOR 
LEVELS OF THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, WHO CONSIDER THEM TO BE 
LEGITIMATE TOOLS OF STATE POLICY.   THE NINISTRY OF 
INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY (NOIS) HAS PRIMARY 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR IRAN\'S TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, WHILE THE 
NINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY 
GUARDS ALSO PLAY ROLES.   TERRORIST ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED 
OR SUPPORTED BY THESE AGENCIES ARE AUTHORIZED BY IRAN\'S 
SUPREME COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY, WHOSE MEMBERSHIP 
INCLUDES PRESIDENT RAFSANJANI, SUPREME LEADER KHAMENEI, 
NINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS VELAYATI, MINISTER OF 
INTELLIGENCE ALL FALLAHIAN, AND MINISTER OF JUSTICE 
YAZDI.   UNTIL THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY EXACTS A 
SUFFICIENTLY HIGH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRICE, IRAN WILL 
HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE THIS BEHAVIOR. 
 
8.    (S)  MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.  THE MOST VIVID 
EXAMPLE OF IRANIAN-SPONSORED TERRORISM HAS BEEN AGAINST 
THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.   IRAN\'S SUPPORT OF GROUPS 
LIKE THE PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), LEBANESE 
HIZBALLAH, THE PFLP-GC, HAMAS, AND SMALLER GROUPS 
INCLUDES MONEY (EXCEEDING USDOLS 100 MILLION ANNUALLY), 
ARMS, TRAINING, AND COORDINATION.   THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT 
OF THE KILLINGS COMMITTED BY GROUPS SUPPORTED BY IRAN 
PLACES A SERIOUS BURDEN ON THE PEACE PROCESS. 
 
9.    (S)  THREATS TO STATE STABILITY.  IRAN IS A PATRON 
OF OTHER POLITICAL OPPOSITION GROUPS THAT EMPLOY 
VIOLENCE.   THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SUPPORT IS TO UNDERMINE 
SECULAR GOVERNMENTS AND ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
REGIMES THAT WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE TO IRANIAN AND 
POLITICIZED ISLAMIC INFLUENCE.   IRAN ALSO SEEKS TO GAIN A 
FOOTHOLD IN ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS ON SEVERAL CONTINENTS AND 
THEREBY FOSTER ITS IDEOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP.  MANY OF 
IRAN\'S CONTACTS WITH OPPOSITION ORGANIZATIONS TAKE PLACE 
IN THE SUDAN, SYRIA, AND LEBANON, ALTHOUGH MEMBERS OF 
THESE GROUPS ALSO TRAVEL TO IRAN. 
 
--    EGYPT:  IRAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF PROVIDING SUPPORT 
TO AL-GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYAH, OR THE ISLAMIC GROUP, AND THE 
EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD.   EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAVE 
BEEN REPORTED TO TRAVEL TO IRAN. 
 
--    ALGERIA:  IRAN HAS ALSO PROVIDED FUNDS TO THE 
ISLAMIC SALVATION FRONT (FIS) AND IS REPORTED TO HAVE 
SHIPPED ARMS TO THE FIS VIA SUDAN. 
 
--    TURKEY:  IRAN FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS A MILITANT 
ORGANIZATION SOMETIMES CALLED THE \"ISLAMIC MOVEMENT,\" 
WHICH HAS TARGETED TURKISH SECULARISTS AND WESTERNERS. 
IRAN ALSO PROVIDES SAFE HAVEN TO THE TERRORIST KURDISTAN 
WORKERS\' PARTY (PKK). 
 
--    TAJIKISTAN:  IRAN HAS PROVIDED TRAINING, FUNDING, 
AND SAFE HAVEN TO THE ISLAMIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT OF 
TAJIKISTAN (IRMT), NOW UNDER THE UNITED TAJIKISTAN 
OPPOSITION (UTO), DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND THE ONGOING 
INSURGENCY.   THE IRANIAN EMBASSY IN DUSHANBE HAS 
CONDUCTED ESPIONAGE AND RECRUITING ACTIVITIES. 
 
--    CENTRAL ASIA:  IRAN HAS SOUGHT TO EXPLOIT WEAKNESSES 
AND VULNERABILITIES IN TAJIKISTAN AND ELSEWHERE IN 
CENTRAL ASIA, SENDING RELIGIOUS PROSELYTIZERS AND FUNDING 
POLITICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS.   GETTING AT THE REGION\'S 
URANIUM RESOURCES AND EXERTING INFLUENCE OVER ITS ENERGY 
SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN KEEN OBJECTIVES. 
 
10.   (S)  THREATS TO INTERNATIONAL LAW.  TEHRAN HAS LONG 
WAGED A VIOLENT STRUGGLE WITH SEVERAL IRANIAN OPPOSITION- 
GROUPS, CHIEF AMONG THEM THE NOJAHEDIN-E KHALQ (~ZK) AND 
THE KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN (KDP-I).  THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS USED TERRORISM AGAINST THEM, AS WELL AS 
AGAINST NON-VIOLENT OPPOSITION GROUPS, AT HOME AND ABROAD 
WITHOUT REGARD FOR BORDERS OR JUDICIAL SYSTEMS. 
 
--    MOJAHEDIN-E KHALQ:  THE MEK IS A MILITARIZED 
ORGANIZATION WHOSE OPPOSITION TACTICS HAVE INCLUDED 
TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST IRAN.   IRAN HAS ASSASSINATED 
DOZENS OF NEK MEMBERS, AND BECAUSE IT IS BASED PARTLY IN 
IRAQ, MUCH IRANIAN RETALIATION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN IRAQ. 
 
--    KURDISH DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF IRAN:  THE KDP-I ENGAGES 
MOSTLY IN POLITICAL ACTIVITIES IN OPPOSITION TO THE 
TEHRAN REGIME, THOUGH IT HAS ALSO CLASHED WITH IRANIAN 
MILITARY UNITS.   IRAN HAS ASSASSINATED TWO KDP-I 
SECRETARIES-GENERAL.   IN 1994 ALONE, THREE MEMBERS OF THE 
GROUP WERE KILLED IN IRAQ, TURKEY, AND DENMARK, 
RESPECTIVELY, AND A FOURTH WAS WOUNDED IN SWEDEN BY A 
LETTER BOMB. 
 
--    IRANIAN PEOPLE\'S FEDAYEEN (IPF):  IN SEPTEMBER 1995, 
ALI TAVASSOLI, A FORMER LEADER OF THE IPF, WAS KIDNAPPED 
IN BAKU, AZERBAIJAN BY ~OIS OFFICERS. 
 
--    NON-VIOLENT OPPOSITION FIGURES:  FORMER IRANIAN 
PRIME NINISTER BAKHTIAR AND AN AIDE WERE ASSASSINATED IN 
PARIS IN 1991.   A MEMBER OF THE OPPOSITION GROUP, \"FLAG 
OF FREEDOM,\" WAS ASSASSINATED IN PARIS IN 1990.  FOUR 
DISSIDENTS WERE ASSASSINATED IN BERLIN IN 1992, AND REZA 
NAZLUMAN, AN OFFICIAL UNDER THE SHAH, WAS ASSASSINATED IN 
PARIS IN 1996.   GERMAN COURTS HAVE ISSUED AN ARREST 
WARRANT FOR NOIS CHIEF FALLAHIAN BASED ON EVIDENCE IN THE 
BERLIN TRIAL, AND GERMAN AUTHORITIES WERE SUFFICIENTLY 
CONVINCED BY FRENCH INFORMATION TO EXTRADITE AN IRANIAN 
TO PARIS TO STAND TRIAL IN THE NAZLUMAN KILLING. 
 
--    SALMAN RUSHDIE:  IRAN HAS REFUSED TO RESCIND ITS 
DEATH SENTENCE AGAINST INDIAN-BORN BRITISH AUTHOR SALMAN 
RUSHDIE.   THIS MONTH, RUSHDIE\'S SCHEDULED RECEIPT OF A 
EUROPEAN LITERARY AWARD IN COPENHAGEN CAUSED SUCH A ROW 
OVER SECURITY PRECAUTIONS THAT IT ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN THE 
DANISH GOVERNMENT. 
 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION PROGRAMS 
 
11.   (S)  IRAN IS MAKING A DETERMINED EFFORT TO DEVELOP 
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (WND) AND TO ACQUIRE 
BALLISTIC MISSILES CAPABLE OF DELIVERING WP~D TO REGIONAL 
TARGETS. 
 
12.   (S)  IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  DESPITE ITS OUTWARD 
ADHERENCE TO THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT), 
IRAN IS ATTEMPTING SECRETLY TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
CAPABILITY.   IRAN HAS DEDICATED CIVILIAN AND MILITARY 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ATTEMPTING TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP 
NUCLEAR FACILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT 
WITH A PURELY PEACEFUL NUCLEAR PROGRAM, BUT WHICH ARE 
CRITICAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FISSILE MATERIAL FOR 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.   IRAN\'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS HEAVILY 
DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, BUT, TO DATE, MOST 
SUPPLIERS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHINA AND RUSSIA, HAVE 
REFUSED TO COOPERATE. 
 
13.   (S)  PLUTONIUM.  IRAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO ACQUIRE THE 
CAPABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH PLUTONIUM AND HIGHLY ENRICHED 
URANIUM.   IN THE CASE OF PLUTONIUM, IRAN HAS BEEN TRYING 
FOR MANY YEARS TO PURCHASE NUCLEAR REACTORS THAT ARE 
OPTIMIZED FOR PRODUCING WEAPONS-GRADE PLUTONIUM AND NOT 
ELECTRICITY.   SPECIFICALLY, IT HAS TRIED--SO FAR 
UNSUCCESSFULLY--TO ACQUIRE A LARGE, HEAVY WATER- 
MODERATED, NATURAL-URANIUM-FUELED REACTOR AND ASSOCIATED 
FACILITIES.   THIS TYPE OF REACTOR HAS LITTLE USE IN 
IRATI\'S CIVILIAN PROGRAM, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN BASED ON 
LIGHT-WATER REACTORS. 
 
14.   (S) ENRICHED URANIUM.  IRAN HAS CONDUCTED RESEARCH 
ON AT LEAST THREE URANIUM ENRICHMENT TECHNOLOGIES--GAS 
CENTRIFUGE, GASEOUS DIFFUSION, AND LASER ISOTOPE 
SEPARATION.   IRANIAN PROCUREMENT EFFORTS SUGGEST IRAN IS 
GIVING THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO GAS CENTRIFUGE 
DEVELOPMENT AND IS ATTEMPTING COVERTLY TO PROCURE THE 
REQUIRED MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT. 
 
15.   (S)  INTERNATIONAL MONITORING.  IRAN HAS ATTEMPTED 
TO ALLAY INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
BY INVITING THE IAEA TO VISIT ANY IAEA-DESIGNATED 
FACILITIES IN IRAN.   THE IAEA HAS MADE SPECIAL VISITS TO 
IRAN, BUT HAS NOT DISCOVERED ANY SIGNS OF A NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS PROGRAM.   THIS IS NOT SURPRISING SINCE IRAN\'S 
PROGRAM HAS NOT PROGRESSED TO THE STAGE WHERE WEAPONS- 
RELATED FACILITIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED. 
 
--    WITH RESPECT TO THESE VISITS, THE IAEA HAS TAKEN 
CARE TO NOTE THAT IT CANNOT VOUCH FOR FACILITIES AND 
SITES NOT VISITED, NOR CAN IT PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY 
THAT THE SITES IT HAS VISITED COULD BE USED FOR OTHER 
ACTIVITIES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
16.   (S)  IRAN\'S MISSILE PROGRAM.  IRAN\'S BALLISTIC 
MISSILE PROGRAM DATES BACK TO THE EARLY 1980S AND HAS 
MADE STEADY PROGRESS.   WE BELIEVE IRANIAN LEADERS VIEW 
ITS MISSILE PROGRAM AS INDISPENSABLE IN PERMITTING IT TO 
THREATEN AND STRIKE A VARIETY OF TARGETS IN THE REGION. 
DURING THE IRAN-IRAQ WAR, TEHRAN DEMONSTRATED ITS 
WILLINGNESS TO USE BALLISTIC MISSILES AGAINST POPULATION 
CENTERS (AS DID IRAQ). 
 
--    IRAN HAS OVER 300 SCUD B AND SCUD C MISSILES, WITH 
RANGES OF 300 AND 500 KILOMETERS, RESPECTIVELY.   IRAN 
ALSO HAS ACQUIRED FROM CHINA MORE THAN 200 CSS-8 SURFACE- 
TO-SURFACE BALLISTIC MISSILES, WITH A RANGE OF 150 
KILOMETERS, WHICH ARE MORE ACCURATE THAN OTHER MISSILES 
IN IRAN\'S INVENTORY. 
 
--    IRAN IS ASSEMBLING BOTH SCUD B AND SCUD C MISSILES 
FROM NORTH KOREAN-SUPPLIED PARTS, AND IT IS LIKELY TO 
ACHIEVE A FULLY INDIGENOUS PRODUCTION CAPABILITY SOON, IF 
IT HAS NOT ALREADY DONE SO. 
 
--    IRAN AND NORTH KOREA SIGNED A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR 
CONTRACT FOR THE 1,000 KILOMETER RANGE NO DONG MISSILE IN 
1993, THOUGH THAT CONTRACT WAS LATER SUSPENDED.   WITH THE 
NO DONG,  IRAN COULD TARGET MOST OF CENTRAL ASIA AND THE 
MIDDLE EAST, AND PARTS OF SOUTH ASIA AND EUROPE. 
 
--    IRAN HAS ALSO ATTEMPTED TO ACQUIRE MEDIUM-RANGE 
MISSILE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE FORMER SOVIET UNION AND WANTS 
TO DEVELOP ITS OWN MEDIUM-RANGE SYSTEM. 
 
17.   (S)  IRANIAN CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  IRAN\'S OFFENSIVE 
CHEMICAL WARFARE (CW) PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1983 DURING THE 
IRAN-IRAQ WAR.   SINCE THE CW PROGRAM\'S INCEPTION, IRAN 
PROBABLY HAS PRODUCED AS MUCH AS 2000 METRIC TONS OF 
BLISTER, BLOOD, AND CHOKING AGENTS. 
 
--    IRAN IS CURRENTLY PROCURING ITEMS AND TECHNOLOGY 
WHICH WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY LETHAL NERVE 
AGENTS. 
 
--    IRAN COULD DISSEMINATE THESE AGENTS VIA TRADITIONAL 
TACTICAL SYSTEMS (I.E. ARTILLERY, MORTARS AND ROCKETS), 
AS WELL AS AERIAL BOMBS OR POSSIBLY MISSILES. 
 
--    IRAN IS STRIVING TO BECOME SELF-SUFFICIENT IN BOTH 
CHEMICAL AND BIO-WARFARE PRODUCTION.   GREAT EFFORTS HAVE 
BEEN MADE TO ESTABLISH THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE MANY OF THE 
KEY PRECURSORS NEEDED TO ENSURE AN UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY 
OF PRECURSORS.   NOT ONLY WOULD THIS ASSIST IRAN\'S OWN CW 
PROGRAM, BUT WOULD ALSO ALLOW THE SALE OF THESE CHEMICAL 
PRECURSORS TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE REGION FOR 
DESPERATELY NEEDED HARD CURRENCY. 
 
18.   (S)  IRANIAN BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.  IRAN\'S BIOLOGICAL 
WARFARE (BW) PROGRAM ALSO BEGAN IN 1983.   SINCE THE LATE 
1980\'S, MILITARY PROCUREMENT ENTITIES HAVE BEEN SEEKING 
DUAL-USE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS EQUIPMENT SUITABLE FOR R&D 
AND PRODUCTION OF BW AGENTS. 
 
--    WE BELIEVE IRAN IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING LAB-SCALE 
QUANTITIES OF SOME BW AGENTS. 
 
--    AN OFFICIAL IRANIAN DOCUMENT OBTAINED IN 1986 
INDICATED THAT TEHRAN HAD A LIMITED ABILITY TO EMPLOY BW. 
IN BATTLE SITUATIONS, THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE DONE WITH 
THE SAME DELIVERY METHODS USED BY THE IRANIAN CW PROGRAM.

1.   (U) CLASSIFIED BY ROBIN L. RAPHEL, ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
OF STATE FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF STATE. 
REASON 1.5(D). 
 
2.   (C) DURING THE COURSE OF A 4/29 TELCON, SAUDI POLITICAL 
COUNSELOR RAHAB MASSOUD AFFIRMED TO SA A/S RAPHEL THAT THE 
SAG\'S FIRST PRIORITY IS TO GET THE TALIBAN TO HAND OVER TO 
THEM OSAMA BIN LADEN. THEIR SECOND PRIORITY IS TO KEEP BIN 
LADEN FROM DIRECTING OPERATIONS OR HAVING ACCESS TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND TO OTHER RADICAL ISLAMISTS. THE 
SAUDIS WERE GREATLY UPSET BY THE SPATE OF MEDIA INTERVIEWS 
AND ARTICLES THAT APPEARED WHEN BIN LADEN WAS IN THE 
JALALABAD AREA.  THEY DISCUSSED BIN LADEN\'S MEDIA ACCESS 
WITH THE TALIBAN. THE SAG IS HOPEFUL THAT THE TALIBAN 
DECISION TO MOVE BIN LADEN CLOSE TO TALIBAN HEADQUARTERS IN 
KANDAHAR WILL EFFECTIVELY KEEP BIN LADEN ISOLATED, AWAY 
FROM THE MEDIA AND UNDER TALIBAN CONTROL. 
 
3.   (C) RAHAB ALSO SAID THEY ARE PRESSING THE TALIBAN ON 
VARIOUS FRONTS -- POLITICALLY, RELIGIOUSLY AND LEGALLY -- 
ON THEIR DEALINGS WITH BIN LADEN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SAUDIS 
HAVE SENT A DELEGATION OF RELIGIOUS EXPERTS TO DISCUSS 
ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE WITH THE TALIBAN AND, PRESUMABLY, TO 
OFFER THEM ISLAM-BASED JUSTIFICATIONS FOR TURNING BIN LADEN 
OVER TO THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT.

SUBJECT: MEETING WITH BIN LADEN GROUP AMERICAN BUSINESS 
AFFILIATE 
 
1.   CLASSIFIED BY NEA/ENA DIRECTOR, RICHARD L. JACKSON. 
REASONS 1.5  (B) AND (D). 
 
2.   (C) SUMMARY: TECHMASTER ENGINEERING, INC. (TEL), A US- 
AFFILIATE OF A HOLDING COMPANY OF THE BIN LADEN GROUP HAS 
BEEN ENGAGED IN ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER 
FMF-FUNDED CONTRACTS FOR THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS.   TEL CLAIMS IT WAS BANNED FROM COMPETING FOR NEW 
EGYPTIAN MILITARY CONTRACTS ACCORDING TO EGYPTIAN MILITARY 
INTELLIGENCE INSTRUCTIONS IN MARCH 1996.   THE BUSINESSMEN 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE BAN MAY BE THE OUTGROWTH OF CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE BIN LADEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS WITH TERRORIST OSAMA 
BIN LADEN.   HOWEVER, THEY WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE BAN IS 
NOT THE RESULT OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY OR OF A PRIOR TEL 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER COMPANY IN EGYPT.   THEY ASKED 
THAT WE CHECK AND,  IF POSSIBLE, LET THEM KNOW THE SOURCE OF 
THE MISUNDERSTANDING.   IF THE PROHIBITION IS INSOLUBLE, TEL 
WILL PLAN TO REFOCUS ITS COMMERCIAL EFFORTS.   END SUMMARY 
 
3.   (C) FOLLOWING THEIR ATTENDANCE AT AMBASSADOR WALKER\'S 
ADDRESS TO THE US-ARAB CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THIS MORNING, 
WASHINGTON REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE BIN LADEN GROUP  (AND 
RETIRED FSO)  PHIL GRIFFIN AND VICTOR PIETKIEWICZ, VP OF 
TECHNASTER ENGINEERING INC. (TEI), OF NEW JERSEY  (A BIN 
LADEN AFFILIATE) MET WITH DESK OFFICER KELLY, NEA/ENA 
DEPUTY PHILO DIBBLE AND JEFF DONALD,  FROM E/CBA. 
PIETKIEWICZ REQUESTED THE MEETING TO DISCUSS HIS BUSINESS 
CONCERNS IN EGYPT.   TEL, HE EXPLAINED, IS A USG(DSAA)- 
QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR WHICH HAS BEEN DOING BUSINESS WITH THE 
GOE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.   THEY ARE CURRENTLY BIDDING ON 
$60 MILLION IN PENDING GOE TENDERS AND HAVE BEEN LISTED AS 
A BIDDER FOR A WAREHOUSE DEPOT  (3 BUILDINGS) FOR THE 
EGYPTIAN MILITARY. 
 
4.   (C) RECENTLY, PIETKIEWICZ CONFIDED, HE LEARNED FROM A 
CONTRACTS FACILITATOR AT THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS THAT 
THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY IS BACKING OFF DOING BUSINESS WITH 
TECHMASTER.  PIETKIEWICZ NOTED THAT HE HAD OBTAINED A COPY 
OF AN OFFICIAL GOE MEMO DATED MARCH 1996, STATING THAT THE 
26TH MILITARY INTELLIGENCE UNIT HAD DETERMINED THAT TEI MAY 
NOT ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR ANY NEW MILITARY CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS IN EGYPT  (NFI).  WE DID NOT SEE THIS LETTER. 
 
5.   (C) AT THIS POINT, GRIFFIN ADDED THAT AT ABOUT THE SAME 
TIME, HE HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI CONCERNING THE BIN 
LADEN FAMILY AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH OSAMA BIN LADEN. 
FOLLOWING THAT DISCUSSION, HE SAID,  IN APRIL 1996, HE 
FACILITATED A MEETING BETWEEN HASSAN BIN LADEN AND THE FBI. 
 
6.   (C) PIETKIEWICZ SAID HE HAD EXCELLENT RELATIONS WITH 
THE EGYPTIAN MILITARY BOTH IN CAIRO AND IN THE EMBASSY 
(EPO)  IN WASHINGTON.  HE WAS THEREFORE PERPLEXED BY THE 
CHANGE OF HEART IN DEALING WITH HIS COMPANY.   HE HAD NO 
BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE GOE.   HE OPINED 
THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS A MISUNDERSTANDING DUE TO HIS 
COMPANY\'S EARLIER AGENCY RELATIONSHIP WITH  (RET.GEN.) 
MOHAMED EL SHERBINI, CEO OF THE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING GROUP 
IN EGYPT.   IT SEEMS THAT SHERBINI ALSO REPRESENTED SEACOR, 
A COMPANY WHICH HAS BEEN BANNED FROM DOING BUSINESS IN 
EGYPT,  HE CLAIMED, DUE TO A \"FAILED PROJECT\".  ANOTHER 
POSSIBILITY THAT CAME TO MIND WAS THAT THE GOE HAS MISTAKEN 
HIS COMPANY FOR ANOTHER COMPANY BY THE SAME NAME. 
 
7.   (C) WHILE GRIFFIN NOTED \"AT TIMES\" SOME OF THE BIN 
LADEN FAMILY ARE HARASSED UPON ENTRY IN EGYPT, HE ADMITTED 
THAT OTHER BIN LADEN AFFILIATE COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY 
OPERATING IN EGYPT, WITHOUT RESTRICTION.   WHILE TECHMASTER 
ENGINEERING IS BANNED FROM NEW CONTRACTS WITH THE EGYPTIAN 
MILITARY, THIS BAN DOES NOT TO THEIR UNDERSTANDING APPLY TO 
NON-MILITARY ENDEAVORS, NOT TO ON-GOING MILITARY CONTRACTS. 
 
8.   (C) PIETKIEWICZ EXPLAINED THAT HIS PRINCIPAL CONCERN AT 
THIS POINT IS NOT TO TURN THE TIDE, BUT TO RECONFIGURE HIS 
FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IF 
THE BAN ON TECHMASTER IS NOT REVERSIBLE. WHILE HE PREFERS 
TO DEAL WITH THE CERTAINTY OF EGYPTIAN MILITARY 
PROCUREMENT, HE NEEDS TO BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT HIS BUSINESS 
DEALINGS. 
 
9.   (C) COMMENT:  EMBASSY MAY WISH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE 
WHICH WE CAN PASS ALONG TO PIETKIEWICZ IF THIS APPEARS TO 
BE A CASE OF MISTAKEN  (CORPORATE) IDENTITY OR IF EL  - 
SHERBINI OR SEACOR HAVE IN SOME WAY TAINTED THE BUSINESS 
ENVIRONMENT FOR TEI.   IF, AS IT APPEARS TO US, THE BAN ON 
TEL HAS TO DO WITH EGYPTIAN SECURITY CONCERNS, WE WILL 
REFRAIN FROM PROVIDING A SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSE TO 
PIETKIEWICZ.

EMBASSY VATICAN 
 
THE FOLLOWING INR ASSESSMENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE OFFICE OF 
EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ANALYSIS AND IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION AND COMMENT 
 
CLASSIFIED BY ROBERT CARLIN, DIVISION CHIEF INR/EAP/NA. 
REASON: 1.5   (D) 
 
 
1.   (C) EVEN AS PYONGYANG CONTINUES TO EXCORIATE CAPITALISM 
AND INSIST THAT THE NORTH WILL \"NEVER CHANGE,\" THERE ARE   - 
SIGNS THAT SOME IN THE REGIME ARE INCREASINGLY OPEN TO 
EXPERIMENTING WITH CAPITALIST PRINCIPLES.    BUT CONSERVATIVE 
OPPOSITION AND BUREAUCRATIC INERTIA ARE STRONG, AND THE 
NORTH\'S LIMITED MEASURES THUS FAR WILL NOT BRING NEEDED 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT. 
 
2.   (U) THIS SPRING AN OFFICIAL ECONOMIC JOURNAL CARRIED 
SEVERAL ARTICLES STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH MARKET- 
RELATED ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AS COMPETITION, AUTONOMOUS 
DECISION-MAKING, AND INCENTIVES.   THE ARTICLES ARGUED THAT 
THE DPRK MUST MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE CAPITALIST MARKET 
THROUGH MARKET RESEARCH,  STUDY OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, PROPER 
PRICING, QUALITY CONTROL, AND ADVERTISING.   THEY DISCUSSED 
IN FAVORABLE TERMS JOINT-VENTURE CONTRACTS AND PROFIT- 
SHARING ARRANGEMENTS, EMPHASIZING THAT FOREIGN DIRECT 
INVESTMENT WOULD PROMOTE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DOMESTIC PRODUCTS.   INCENTIVES, THE 
JOURNAL EMPHASIZED, ARE KEY; INCREASED PAY \"INCREASES 
ZEAL,\" AND AUTONOMY SPURS INITIATIVE. 
 
-THE DEBATE JOINED 
 
3.   (C) THE DAY THE ARTICLES APPEARED, THE PARTY NEWSPAPER 
CARRIED AN AUTHORITATIVE COMMENTARY CITING THE ALBANIAN 
EXPERIENCE AS A WARNING AGAINST ABANDONING SOCIALISM. 
THOUGH PROBABLY NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY IN RESPONSE TO THE 
ARTICLES, THE COMMENTARY REFLECTED SERIOUS CONCERN AMONG 
CONSERVATIVES THAT THE IDEOLOGICAL DIKES WERE BEGINNING-TO 
LEAK. 
 
4.   (C) THERE ARE SIGNS THAT MORE THAN THEORETICAL JOUSTING 
IS GOING ON.   HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS FAVORING PRAGMATIC 
ECONOMIC MEASURES REPORTEDLY WERE DISPATCHED TO THE NORTH\'S 
NAJIN-SONBONG FREE TRADE ZONE TO INVESTIGATE THE NEED FOR 
NEW MEASURES.   IN JUNE, FOLLOWING UP THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS, 
PYONGYANG IMPLEMENTED LIMITED STEPS TO PROMOTE MARKET 
PRACTICES.   THESE INCLUDED EXPANDING THE RANGE OF ECONOMIC 
ACTIVITY AUTHORIZED IN THE ZONE AND ALLOWING NORTH KOREANS- 
NOT JUST FOREIGNERSWRO ENGAGE IN PRIVATE ENTERPRISE RANGING 
FROM SELLING SURPLUS FARM GOODS TO OPENING RESTAURANTS. 
 
5.   (C) THE PROCESS TOOK ANOTHER STEP FORWARD IN AUGUST 
WITH PUBLICATION OF A KIM JONG IL THESIS ON REUNIFICATION. 
SOUTH KOREAN FIRMS HAVE TOLD EMBASSY SEOUL THEIR DEALINGS 
IN THE DPRK HAVE BECOME-MORE BUSINESSLIKE SINCE THE KIM 
THESIS, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE GIVEN NORTHERNERS AN 
IDEOLOGICAL BASIS TO DEAL WITH THE SOUTH. 
 
COLD COMFORT 
 
6.   (C) IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE LIMITED REFORM MEASURES 
UNDERTAKEN WOULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT WITHOUT KIM JONG 
IL\'S BLESSING.   NONETHELESS, UNLESS KIM EXPLICITLY STATES 
THE NEED FOR BROAD ECONOMIC REFORMS, THE PROCESS WILL MOVE 
SLOWLY, ALWAYS UNDER COVER OF A PRUDENT-IF TATTERED 
IDEOLOGICAL VEIL.   IDEOLOGICAL COVER IS NECESSARY TO 
PROTECT THE REFORMERS, ALLOWING THEM TO ACCOMMODATE MARKET 
ACTIVITIES AND PURSUE NEW MEASURES FOR DEVELOPMENT WHILE 
PAYING PROPER OBEISANCE TO ORTHODOX BELIEFS.   THESE SUBTLE 
SHIFTS IN PYONGYANG\'S ECONOMIC LINE WILL PROVIDE COLD 
COMFORT TO POTENTIAL WESTERN INVESTORS.   BUT THEY HAVE 
ALREADY STRUCK A RESPONSIVE CHORD AMONG SOME SOUTH KOREAN 
FIRMS AND PROMISE TO ENCOURAGE NEW ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR IN THE 
NORTH.  (JBADER) (CONFIDENTIAL)

SUBJECT: APPROACH TO EU ON TALEBAN SUPPORT FOR USAMA BIN 
LADEN 
 
CLASSIFIED BY KENNETH R. MCKUNE, ACTING COORDINATOR FOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM, S/CT, DEPARTMENT OF STATE. REASON:  1.5 
(B). 
 
1.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE - SEE PARA 2. 
 
2.  (S/RELEASABLE TO THE EU) THE U.S. IS CONCERNED BY THE 
SO-CALLED FATWA RECENTLY ISSUED BY TERRORIST PATRON USAMA 
BIN LADEN THAT CALLS ON ALL MUSLIMS TO KILL AMERICANS. WE 
HAVE RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH THE TALEBAN BOTH IN KABUL AND 
IN NEW YORK.  WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT EU MEMBER STATES SHARE 
THIS CONCERN.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MERIT IN THE 
TALEBAN REALIZING THAT THIS CONCERN IS NOT LIMITED TO THE 
U.S. POSTS ARE REQUESTED TO DRAW FROM THE TALKING POINTS 
BELOW AND CONVEY THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE HOST COUNTRY 
OFFICIALS SOONEST. 
 
(BEGIN POINTS) 
 
--THE TALEBAN ASSUMED THE ROLE OF HOST TO TERRORIST PATRON 
USAMA BIN LADEN WHEN THEY CONSOLIDATED THEIR CONTROL OVER 
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN IN LATE 1996. THEY ALSO TOOK CONTROL 
OF A NUMBER OF TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS. BIN LADEN HAS 
BEEN HEADQUARTERED IN AFGHANISTAN SINCE HE LEFT SUDAN IN 
MID-1996. 
 
--INITIALLY, THE TALEBAN PLEDGED TO SHUT DOWN CAMPS AND, 
THOUGH REFUSING TO EXPEL BIN LADEN, PROMISED TO KEEP HIM 
UNDER CONTROL. THE TALEBAN HAVE RENEGED ON BOTH OF THESE 
PLEDGES. 
 
--THE TALEBAN HAVE TAKEN NO ACTION AGAINST BIN LADEN FOR 
HIS ISSUANCE THIS MONTH OF A SELF-STYLED FATWA URGING 
MUSLIMS TO ATTACK U.S. INTERESTS, INCLUDING CIVILIANS, AND 
THE INTERESTS OF COUNTRIES ALLIED WITH THE U.S. 
 
--TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN TALEBAN 
CONTROLLED AREAS. 
 
--DURING AN AUGUST 1997 TRIP TO VISIT CAMPS NEAR KHOWST IN 
EASTERN AFGHANISTAN, BIN LADEN ISSUED PUBLIC ANTI-U.S. 
STATEMENTS WARNING HE WOULD NOT STOP HIS STRUGGLE UNTIL HE 
HAD EXPELLED ALL AMERICANS FROM SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
--THE TALEBAN FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF THESE CAMPS BY 
ALLOWING FREE PASSAGE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS TO AND FROM 
THESE FACILITIES. 
 
--WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SENIOR TALEBAN LEADERS ARE IN CLOSE 
CONTACT WITH USAMA BIN LADEN. THIS RELATIONSHIP IS 
MANIFEST IN BIN LADEN\'S FINANCING LAST YEAR OF A LARGE 
RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE PROVINCIAL 
GOVERNOR\'S HOUSE IN QANDAHAR. 
 
--THE TALEBAN MUST SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR USAMA BIN 
LADEN\'S TERRORIST ACTIONS AND INFLAMMATORY STATEMENTS AS 
LONG AS HE REMAINS A GUEST IN QANDAHAR. 
 
--WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THESE POINTS TO THE TALEBAN 
SOONEST.

SUBJECT: PAKISTAN: GHAURI FLIGHT TEST 
 
CLASSIFIED BY KARL F. INDERFURTH, ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 
REASON: 1.5  (D) 
 
1.  (S) SUMMARY. A/S INDERFURTH EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT AT 
PAKISTAN\'S FLIGHT TEST OF ITS GHAURI MISSILE, AND CONCERN 
AT ITS POSSIBLE IMPACT ON RESUMPTION OF TALKS WITH INDIA. 
HE URGED PAKISTAN TO CONVEY DIRECTLY TO THE NEW INDIAN 
GOVERNMENT ITS POSITION THAT THE TEST WAS NOT A REACT TON TO 
THE NEW BJP GOVERNMENT AND ITS PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE 
\"NUCLEAR OPTION.\" HE ALSO MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE USG HAS 
BEEN EVALUATING THE POSSIBLE REQUIREMENT TO IMPOSE US 
MISSILE SANCTIONS FOR IMPORTS RELATED TO THE GHAURI. IN 
PARA 8 ARE POINTS EMBASSY ISLAMABAD SHOULD MAKE ON THE 
GHAURI MISSILE.  END SUMMARY 
 
2.  (U) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE. SEE PARA 8. 
 
3.  (C) AFTER PAKISTANI AMBASSADOR KHOKHAR ON APRIL 6 TOLD 
A/S INDERFURTH APRIL 6 OF THE RELEASE OF DEA EMPLOYEE AYYAZ 
BALUCH  (SEPTEL), HE HANDED OVER THE GOP PRESS RELEASE ON 
THE FLIGHT TEST OF THE GHAURI MISSILE EARLIER THAT DAY. 
INDERFURTH TOLD KHOKHAR THAT WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT 
PAKISTAN HAD FELT IT NECESSARY TO TAKE THIS ACTION. HE 
POINTED OUT THAT WE HAVE BEEN URGING BOTH INDIA AND 
PAKISTAN TO REFRAIN FROM ANY ACTIONS THAT COULD BE SEEN BY 
THE OTHER AS PROVOCATIVE.   HE EXPRESSED CONCERN AT HOW 
THIS WOULD AFFECT THE RESUMPTION OF THE INDO-PAKISTANI 
DIALOGUE AND THE PROGRESS THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD MAKE IN 
IMPROVING RELATIONS. 
 
4. (C) INDERFURTH SAID THAT WE WOULD URGE THE GOVERNMENT OF 
INDIA NOT TO REACT.   HE ADDED THAT WE ALSO HOPE, NOW THAT 
PAKISTAN HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS CAPABILITY, THAT IT WOULD NOW 
REFRAIN FROM ANY FURTHER SUCH TESTS. 
 
5. (C) KHOKHAR SAID,  IN REFERENCE TO INDO-PAKISTANI 
RELATIONS, THAT PM NAWAZ SHARIF\'S LETTER TO INCOMING PM 
VAJPAYEE WAS VERY UPBEAT.  HE ADDED THAT THE FLIGHT TEST 
HAD BEEN \"IN THE PIPELINE\" AND WAS NOT A REACTION TO THE 
NEW BJP GOVERNMENT IN DELHI. WHEN CHALLENGED WHETHER THE 
GOP HAD MADE THIS POINT DIRECTLY TO INDIA, KHOKHAR CLAIMED 
THAT PAKISTAN DID NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH 
INDIA.   INDERFURTH STRONGLY ENCOURAGED PAKISTAN TO SEND A 
REASSURING MESSAGE TO VAJPAYEE. 
 
6. (S) INDERFURTH NOTED THAT THE GOP PRESS RELEASE HAD 
REFERRED TO THE GHAURI AS AN INDIGENOUS PROGRAM, AND STATED 
OUR VIEW THAT IT WAS NOT ENTIRELY INDIGENOUS. HE POINTED 
OUT THAT AMBASSADOR SIMONS HAD RAISED PREVIOUSLY WITH THE 
GOP (NOTE: DECEMBER 24 WITH COAS KARAMAT, FEBRUARY 10 WITH 
FONSEC AHMED, AND FEBRUARY 24 WITH ANWAR ZAHID) OUR 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY 
RELATED TO THE GHAURI. THIS, HE SAID, RAISES THE SPECTRE 
OF SANCTIONABLE ACTIVITY.  HE SAID THAT THE USG IS AT THE 
LATE STAGE OF OUR REVIEW OF THE APPLICABILITY OF MISSILE 
SANCTIONS UNDER US LAW, AND STRESSED THAT THIS REVIEW 
PREDATES THE GHAURI FLIGHT TEST. HE ASKED KHOKHAR TO 
PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THE GOP COULD PROVIDE. 
 
7. (C) INDERFURTH TURNED TO THE PAKISTANI LETTERS TO THE 
PRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY LAST WEEK ON SOUTH ASIAN 
SECURITY. HE SAID THAT IT IS THE USG VIEW THAT THE GOL 
LANGUAGE (ON THE \"OPTION TO INDUCT NUCLEAR WEAPONS\") THAT 
PAKISTAN FOUND SO DISTURBING DID NOT SUGGEST A NEW 
THRESHOLD HAD BEEN CROSSED. HE STRESSED THAT WE HAD BEEN 
STRONGLY URGING THE GOL NOT TO PROCEED IN THIS DIRECTION. 
WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING PAKISTAN\'S RIGHT TO TAKE ACTIONS BASED 
ON THEIR OWN SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, HE EXPRESSED THE HOPE 
THAT ACTIONS BEING TAKEN IN BOTH CAPITALS DO NOT RESULT IN 
DESTABILIZING THE REGION. 
 
8. (S) ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY SHOULD FOLLOW UP THIS 
DISCUSSION ON OUR REACTION TO THE MISSILE TEST AND ON THE 
PENDING ISSUE OF US MISSILE SANCTIONS, EMBASSY SHOULD MAKE 
THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO APPROPRIATE GOP COUNTERPARTS (I.E., 
THOSE WITH WHOM THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED ON PREVIOUS 
OCCASIONS) : 
 
-- IN SECRETARY ALBRIGHT\'S LETTER OF MARCH 20 TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER, SHE MADE VERY CLEAR OUR VIEWS REGARDING A FLIGHT 
TEST IN THIS TIME FRAME. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE PARTICULARLY 
DISAPPOINTED AND REGRET THAT PAKISTAN FELT IT NECESSARY TO 
CONDUCT THE GHAURI FLIGHT TEST NOW. AS YOU KNOW, WE 
BELIEVE BOTH INDIA AND PAKISTAN SHOULD REFRAIN FROM ACTIONS 
THE OTHER COUNTRY WOULD FIND PROVOCATIVE. THIS IS 
ESSENTIAL IF THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE TO RESUME DISCUSSIONS 
AND MAKE PROGRESS IN IMPROVING RELATIONS. 
 
-- WE WELCOME THE CORDIAL TONE OF PM SHARIF\'S LETTER TO THE 
INCOMING INDIAN PM. BUT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS, 
AND THIS IS THE FIRST MAJOR PAKISTANI ACTION SINCE THE 
SWEARING-IN OF THE NEW INDIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
-- WE HAVE ADVISED THE INDIANS, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF 
THEIR OWN PREVIOUS MISSILE TESTS, NOT TO OVER-REACT TO 
PAKISTAN\'S FLIGHT TEST. 
 
-- WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTACT THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA 
DIRECTLY, AT A HIGH LEVEL, TO ALLAY ANY CONCERNS IT MAY 
HAVE ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS OF YOUR GHAURI TEST. 
 
-- SIMILARLY, NOW THAT PAKISTAN HAS DEMONSTRATED ITS 
CAPABILITY, WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL REFRAIN FROM FURTHER SUCH 
TESTS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO HEIGHTENED 
TENSIONS. 
 
-- AS AMBASSADOR SIMONS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WITH YOU, THE 
USG HAS BEEN REVIEWING FOR SOME TIME WHETHER ACTIVITIES BY 
A PAKISTANI ENTITY RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION FROM FOREIGN 
SOURCES OF MTCR CATEGORY I MISSILES AND RELATED EQUIPMENT 
AND TECHNOLOGY REQUIRE THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS UNDER US 
MISSILE SANCTIONS LAWS. WE ARE NEARING COMPLETION OF THE 
SANCTIONS REVIEW PROCESS IN THIS CASE AND EXPECT TO MAKE A 
DECISION SOON. 
 
-- I WANT TO STRESS THAT ANY SANCTIONS WOULD NOT BE 
TRIGGERED BY THE FLIGHT TEST, BUT BY THE ACQUISITION OF THE 
MISSILE AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY.

CLASSIFIED BY KENNETH R. MCKUNE, ASSOCIATE COORDINATOR FOR

1.  (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE FOR ISLAMABAD, CAIRO, 
SANAA, AND GCC STATES. PLEASE SEE PARAS 3 AND 4 BELOW. 
TASHKENT, PESHAWAR, LONDON: THIS CABLE IS FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION ONLY. 
 
2.  (U)  THE USG IS VERY CONCERNED BY STATEMENTS MADE BY 
TERRORIST OSAMA BIN LADEN AT A MAY 26 PRESS CONFERENCE IN 
KHOST, AFGHANISTAN. BIN LADEN REPORTEDLY SAID: \"ALL 
MUSLIMS MUST DECLARE JIHAD AGAINST THEM (THE U.S. TROOPS) 
AND EXPEL THEM FROM THE HOLY LAND (SAUDI ARABIA) .... THE 
JIHAD FATWA HAS INDEED BEEN ISSUED.\" BIN LADEN ALSO 
INDICATED THAT AN ATTACK COULD TAKE PLACE IN THE NEXT FEW 
WEEKS. 
 
3.  (S)  THE USG TAKES THESE STATEMENTS VERY SERIOUSLY. 
WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING TARGET 
OR TIMING, THERE ARE OTHER INDICATIONS THAT BIN LADEN MAY 
BE PLANNING AN IMMINENT ATTACK AGAINST U.S. OR SAUDI - 
INTERESTS IN THE PERSIAN GULF. DEPARTMENT THEREFORE 
REQUESTS THAT AMBASSADOR OR CHARGE APPROACH APPROPRIATE 
SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE HOST GOVERNMENT AND DELIVER THE 
POINTS IN PARA 4 BELOW. 
 
4. (S)  BEGIN POINTS. 
 
- ON MAY 26, TERRORIST FINANCIER OSAMA BIN LADEN ADDRESSED 
  A PRESS CONFERENCE IN AFGHANISTAN AT WHICH HE AGAIN 
  CALLED FOR VIOLENT ATTACKS AND A JIHAD ON U.S. FORCES IN 
  THE PERSIAN GULF. HE INDICATED THAT SUCH ATTACKS COULD 
  OCCUR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. 
 
- THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONLY THE LATEST IN A LONG STRING OF 
  BIN LADEN THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST U.S. CITIZENS 
  AROUND THE WORLD. 
 
- THE USG TAKES- THESE THREATS VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE 
  OTHER INDICATIONS THAT BIN LADEN MAY BE PLANNING AN 
  ATTACK AGAINST AMERICAN INTERESTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
 
- WE ASK YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S ASSISTANCE IN THWARTING SUCH AN 
  ATTACK. 
 
- FIRST, WE ASK THAT YOU INCREASE SECURITY AROUND U.S. 
  DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY FACILITIES. YOU MAY ALSO WISH 
  TO INCREASE SECURITY AT U.S. BUSINESSES AND OTHER 
  POTENTIAL TARGETS WHICH MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
  U.S. 
 
- SECOND,  IF YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY BIN LADEN ASSOCIATES IN 
  YOUR COUNTRY, WE ASK THAT YOU INTERROGATE THEM AND WATCH 
  THEIR ACTIONS CLOSELY TO SEE IF YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING 
  MORE OF PLANNING FOR AN ATTACK. 
 
- FINALLY, WE ASK THAT YOU SHARE WITH US ON AN URGENT 
  BASIS ANY INFORMATION YOU LEARN ON BIN LADEN OR HIS 
  ASSOCIATES. 
 
- WE APPRECIATE YOUR COOPERATION IN THIS MATTER, WHICH IS 
  OF THE UTMOST CONCERN TO THE U.S.

LETTER FROM PRIMAKOV IN WHICH PRIMAKOV ASSERTED 
CATEGORICALLY THAT IRAQ HAD ELIMINATED ALL WMD AND NO 
LONGER RETAINED THE CAPACITY TO PRODUCE THEM, THAT BUTLER 
HAD UNILATERALLY AND PREMATURELY CUT OFF TALKS WITH IRAQ, 
AND THAT THERE IS NO REASON NOT TO TRANSITION THE NUCLEAR

COMMAND COUNCIL ANNOUNCED THAT IRAQ WAS SUSPENDING 
COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND IAEA, AND DEMANDING LIFTING 
OFSANCTIONS AND A FUNDAMENTAL RESTRUCTURING OF UNSCOM. 
 
4. (C) ACTION REQUESTED: EMBASSY MOSCOW SHOULD DELIVER THE 
FOLLOWING LETTER TO FM PRIMAKOV AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NO 
ORIGINAL TO FOLLOW. 
 
5. (C) BEGIN TEXT: 
 
DEAR YEVGENIY, 
 
I AM WRITING TO EXPRESS MY SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT IRAQ\'S 
LATEST ACTIONS, AND TO RESPOND TO YOUR LETTER. 
 
I\'M CONFIDENT YOU ARE AS APPALLED AS I BY IRAQ\'S LATEST 
ATTEMPTS TO EVADE ITS OBLIGATIONS AND TO UNILATERALLY 
REWRITE THE RULES LAID DOWN BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THIS 
ASSAULT ON THE INTEGRITY AND AUTHORITY OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS CANNOT BE TOLERATED. WE MUST RESPOND WITH STRONG, 
UNIFIED ACTION WHICH MAKES CLEAR THAT NO NATION HAS THE 
RIGHT TO FLOUT ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND THE WILL 
OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL. 
 
I AM SURE THAT YOU DID NOT ANTICIPATE IRAQ\'S ACTIONS WHEN 
YOU WROTE YOUR LETTER WHICH IMPLIED THAT CHAIRMAN BUTLER 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRECIPITATING A BREAKDOWN. THE 
REVOLUTIONARY COMMAND COUNCIL\'S STATEMENT MAKES CLEAR THAT 
IRAQ HAS NO RESPECT FOR UNSCOM, THE UNITED NATIONS AND 
PARTICULARLY THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL\'S 
RESOLUTIONS, THE FEBRUARY 23 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, 
OR THE SECRETARY GENERAL WHO NEGOTIATED THAT AGREEMENT. 
 
WHEN IRAQ BEGAN THIS STANDOFF BY ISSUING UNREASONABLE 
PRECONDITIONS FOR THE CONTINUATION OF TALKS, CHAIRMAN 
BUTLER IMMEDIATELY CONSULTED WITH SECRETARY GENERAL ANNAN 
AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL, BOTH OF WHOM 
SUPPORTED THE DECISION TO DEPART IRAQ.   MR. BUTLER HAS NOT 
SUSPENDED UNSCOM\'S ACTIVITIES IN IRAQ; TARIQ AZIZ BROKE OFF 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE UNSCOM CHAIRMAN. IRAQ HAS NOW 
ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS SUSPENDING COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND 
THE IAEA. 
 
IRAQ HAS CONSISTENTLY FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL\'S REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL DISCLOSURE OF ITS WEAPONS 
OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND MISSILE PROGRAMS. IT IS THIS 
FAILURE TO COMPLY, TOGETHER WITH IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO 
COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND IAEA -- IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE 
SECRETARY GENERAL\'S MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING AND U.N. 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1154 -- WHICH CONTINUE TO DELAY 
SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION, ESPECIALLY ACTION TO TRANSITION 
THE NUCLEAR FILE. THE MAY SECURITY COUNCIL PRESIDENTIAL 
STATEMENT CLEARLY LAID OUT WHAT IS REQUIRED BEFORE THE 
SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD CONSIDER TRANSITIONING THE NUCLEAR 
FILE. AS THE RECENT IAEA REPORT TO THE COUNCIL MADE CLEAR, 
IRAQ HAS NOT RESPONDED TO ANY OF THE OUTSTANDING CONCERNS. 
EVEN THOUGH IRAQ HAS NO DIFFICULTY CONVENING ITS SO-CALLED 
PARLIAMENT TO DENOUNCE UNSCOM, IT HAS FAILED TO PASS A 
PENAL LAW WHICH TARIQ AZIZ ACKNOWLEDGED WAS AN 
\"INESCAPABLE\" PRECONDITION FOR TRANSITIONING THE FILE. 
 
YEVGENIY, THE FACTS CONTRADICT YOUR CLAIM THAT IRAQ DOES 
NOT POSSESS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION OR THE CAPACITY TO 
MANUFACTURE THEM, AND I FURTHER BELIEVE RUSSIA WOULD NOT 
FIND SUPPORT FOR THAT OPINION ELSEWHERE. DESPITE IRAQI 
CLAIMS THAT IT HAS COOPERATED FULLY WITH UNSCOM AND 
PROVIDED FULL DISCLOSURE, UNSCOM HAS REPEATEDLY UNCOVERED 
NEW EVIDENCE OF IRAQ\'S PROGRAM TO DEVELOP WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION. AS UNSCOM\'S DISCOVERY IN JUNE OF WEAPONIZED 
VX -- SOMETHING IRAQ HAD CONSISTENTLY DENIED HAVING -- 
MAKES CLEAR, THE FULL EXTENT OF IRAQ\'S WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION PROGRAM IS STILL UNKNOWN.   I FOUND YOUR 
STATEMENTS AT THAT TIME TO BE VERY HELPFUL, AND AM 
PERPLEXED AND SURPRISED THAT YOU WOULD TAKE A DIFFERENT 
POSITION NOW. FOR THE SECURITY OF THE REGION, WE MUST KNOW 
WHAT IRAQ HAS DEVELOPED AND IS CAPABLE OF DEVELOPING. 
 
IRAQ\'S REFUSAL TO COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE 
THE LEGITIMACY OF RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL IS UNACCEPTABLE. UNTIL IRAQ RESUMES COOPERATION 
WITH UNSCOM, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE COUNCIL TO HOLD 
SANCTIONS REVIEWS. THEREFORE, WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER FOR 
A COUNCIL DECISION TO SUSPEND SANCTIONS REVIEWS 
INDEFINITELY, UNTIL THEY RESUME FULL COOPERATION. THIS, 
YEVGENIY, IS A MINIMUM NECESSARY FIRST STEP. UNLESS THE 
COUNCIL ACTS RESPONSIBLY TO COUNTER IRAQ\'S OBSTRUCTIONISM, 
WE WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER OTHER AVAILABLE OPTIONS. 
 
SINCERELY, 
MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT

LIFTED BECAUSE IT HAS ALLEGEDLY FULFILLED ITS COMMITMENTS 
UNDER UNSC RESOLUTIONS AND DESTROYED PROHIBITED WEAPONS. 
TARIQ AZIZ MADE THIS ARGUMENT TO UNSCOM CHAIRMAN BUTLER ON 
AUGUST 3/4 IN BAGHDAD AND AGAIN ON AUGUST 5 IN A LETTER TO 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL ISSUED 
A PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT, DECLARING THAT IRAQ\'S ACTION TO 
SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM CONTRAVENED RELEVANT 
SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND THE FEBRUARY 23 MOU. IN 
THE BI-MONTHLY SANCTIONS REVIEW AUGUST 20, THE COUNCIL 
REITERATED THAT IRAQ\'S DECISION TO SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH 
UNSCOM AND THE IAEA WAS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE SUSPECT

AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENSURING THAT THE NAM AVOIDS ENDORSING 
IRAQ\'S CURRENT CHALLENGE TO THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL AND 
AVOIDS ANY INDICATION THAT THE NON-ALIGNED ARE ACTING IN A 
MANNER DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. 
 
BEGIN POINTS: 
 
3. (C)   IRAQ SHOULD NOT WIN AT THE NAM WHAT IT HAS BEEN 
UNABLE TO WIN AT THE UN: AN ENDORSEMENT OF ITS CLAIM THAT 
IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS.   IRAQ IS NOT IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS. THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL AND THE SECRETARY GENERAL HAVE STATED PUBLICLY THAT 
IN REFUSING TO COOPERATE FURTHER WITH UNSCOM IRAQ HAS 
VIOLATED THE TERMS OF THE MOU WITH THE SECRETARY GENERAL 
AND CONTRAVENED THE RESOLUTIONS. MOST RECENTLY, ON AUGUST 
20, THE COUNCIL MET FOR THE 39TH TIME TO REVIEW IRAQ\'S 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESOLUTIONS AND DETERMINED QUICKLY THAT 
CONDITIONS DO NOT EXIST FOR THE MODIFICATION OF THE 
(SANCTIONS) REGIME. MOREOVER, THE COUNCIL \"REITERATED THAT 
THE DECISION BY IRAQ TO SUSPEND COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND 
THE IAEA IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THEY VIEW WITH EXTREME 
CONCERN THE CONTINUING REFUSAL BY THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ TO 
RESCIND ITS DECISION (TO COOPERATE).\" 
 
4. (U)   IT IS TRUE THAT IRAQ HAS CARRIED OUT SOME 
OBLIGATIONS, AT LEAST PARTIALLY. IT NOT CARRIED OUT 
-OTHERS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SHORT GLOBAL SUMMARY: 
 
OBLIGATION (PER UNSCRS 687, 70V, 715) -- DONE? 
 
FORMAL LEGAL ACCEPTANCE OF KUWAIT -- YES 
DOMESTIC LAWS ENFORCING THESE OBLIGATIONS -- NO 
FULLY DECLARE WEAPONS PROGRAMS: 
- NUCLEAR -- NO 
- MISSILES -- NO 
- CHEMICAL -- NO 
- BIOLOGICAL -- NO 
ALLOW UNCONDITIONAL INSPECTION ACCESS -- NO 
CEASE ANY ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL/MOVE/DESTROY -- NO 
ALLOW UNSCOM AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS W/NO INTERFERENCE -- NO 
RETURN ALL KUWAITI PROPERTY SEIZED BY IRAQ -- NO 
FACILITATE ICRC SEARCH FOR UNACCOUNTED KUWAITIS -- NO 
END SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM -- NO 
 
5.  (U) THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT DIFFICULT. THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL CLEARLY ENVISIONED THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S GOVERNMENT 
COULD IMPLEMENT THEM IN JUST A FEW MONTHS.  HE STILL CAN. 
HE JUST HASN\'T DONE IT. IF THERE IS ANY SUBJECT IN ITS 
ENTIRE HISTORY THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS REVIEWED 
THOROUGHLY, REPEATEDLY, AND IN DIRECT DIALOGUE WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ,  IT IS IRAQ\'S WEAPONS OF MASS 
DESTRUCTION. THE COUNCIL HAS CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF IRAQ 
SANCTIONS EVERY 60 DAYS SINCE 1991, EXCEPT FOR A PERIOD 
WHEN IRAQ\'S CEASEFIRE BREACHES LED TO SUSPENSION. THE 
COUNCIL HAS RECEIVED DETAILED WRITTEN UNSCOM & IAEA 
PROGRESS REPORTS AND VERBAL BRIEFINGS AT LEAST EVERY 6 
MONTHS SINCE 1991.   ON FEBRUARY 23, 1998, THE SYG SIGNED 
THE ANNAN-AZIZ MOU,  IN WHICH \"THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ 
FURTHER REITERATES ITS UNDERTAKING TO COOPERATE FULLY WITH 
UNSCOM AND THE IAEA.\"  UNSCOM PRESENTED IRAQ WITH A WORK 
PLAN TO MAKE PROGRESS IN JUNE AND IN AUGUST, CHAIRMAN 
BUTLER CARRIED WITH HIM AN ACCELERATED WORKPLAN. IRAQ\'S 
RESPONSE WAS TO SUSPEND COOPERATION AND TRY TO ACHIEVE 
THROUGH DECLARATION WHAT IT HAD FAILED TO ACHIEVE IN FACT: 
COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OBLIGATIONS. 
 
6.  (U) CHEMICAL WEAPONS:    DESPITE MAJOR PROGRESS REPORTED 
BY UNSCOM IN ACCOUNTING FOR SCUD MISSILE CHEMICAL WARHEADS, 
THE IRAQIS HAVE TAKEN A GIANT STEP BACKWARD BY CONTINUING 
TO DENY THE WEAPONIZATION OF VX NERVE AGENT. UNSCOM AND 
INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS ARE UNANIMOUSLY CONFIDENT OF THE 
SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY OF LABORATORY RESULTS FINDING 
PERSISTENT VX IN FRAGMENTS OF IRAQI SCUD MISSILE WARHEADS. 
MOREOVER, ON JULY 22, 1998, UNSCOM REPORTED IN A LETTER TO 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT IRAQ HAD REFUSED 
TO ALLOW AN UNSCOM CHIEF INSPECTOR TO TAKE, OR EVEN COPY, A 
DOCUMENT FOUND IN IRAQI AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS THAT GAVE AN 
ACCOUNTING OF CHEMICAL MUNITIONS USED DURING THE IRAN-IRAQ 
WAR. THIS DOCUMENT WOULD BE OF GREAT VALUE IN HELPING 
UNSCOM ESTABLISH A TRUE MATERIAL BALANCE  (THAT IS, KNOWN 
IMPORTS/PRODUCTION MINUS KNOWN USE EQUALS WHAT UNSCOM NEEDS 
TO DESTROY) FOR IRAQI CHEMICAL MUNITIONS--A MANDATORY TASK 
FOR UNSCOM. THE IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TOLD 
AMBASSADOR BUTLER THAT \"IRAQ. WOULD NEVER GIVE IT TO THE 
COMMISION.\" 
 
7.    (U) BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS:  IN JULY 1998 UNSCOM ASSEMBLED 
YET ANOTHER GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO MEET WITH 
IRAQI COUNTERPARTS FOR REVIEW OF IRAQI DECLARATIONS ON THE 
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM. AGAIN, THE IRAQIS PRESENTED NO 
NEW MATERIAL.  THE EXPERTS THUS FOUND, AGAIN, THAT IRAQ\'S 
DECLARATIONS ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR CREDIBLE VERIFICATION. 
THIS CONCLUSION COVERED WEAPONS (SCUD MISSILE BW WARHEADS, 
R-400 BW BOMBS, DROP-TANKS TO BE FILLED WITH BW, AND SPRAY 
DEVICES FOR BW), PLUS PRODUCTION OF BW AGENTS (BOTULINUM 
TOXIN, ANTHRAX, AFLATOXIN, AND WHEAT COVER SMUT), AS WELL 
AS BW AGENT GROWTH MEDIA. 
 
8. (U) LONG RANGE MISSILES: UNSCOM EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN 
RICHARD BUTLER REPORTED TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON AUGUST 5 
THAT UNSCOM AND IRAQ HAD MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE 
ACCOUNTING OF BOTH CBW AND CONVENTIONAL SCUD MISSILE 
WARHEADS, AS WELL AS THE MATERIAL BALANCE OF MAJOR 
COMPONENTS FOR SCUD ENGINE PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, NO 
PROGRESS WAS REPORTED IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE UNIQUE SCUD 
PROPELLANT POSSESSED BY IRAQ, AND THE IRAQI DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER REFUSES TO ALLOW FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IRAQ\'S 
CONCEALMENT PROGRAM, INCLUDING THE HIDING OF SCUD WARHEADS. 
 
9.    (U) NUCLEAR: ON MAY 14, THE COUNCIL STATED IT WOULD BE 
PREPARED TO TRANSITION THE NUCLEAR FILE TO LONG TERM 
MONITORING, ONCE THE IAEA WAS SATISFIED THAT IRAQ HAD 
ANSWERED OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS APPROPRIATELY. IN THE IAEA\'S 
\"INTERIM REPORT\" TO THE UNSC ON JULY 29, THE IAEA REPORTED 
THAT IRAQ HAD PROVIDED NO NEW INFORMATION AND THAT IT HAD 
MADE NO PROGRESS.   IRAQ HAD EVEN FAILED TO TAKE SUCH EASY 
MEASURES AS PASSING LEGISLATION PROHIBITING ACTIVITY 
CONTRARY TO UNSCR 687. ON AUGUST 11,  1998,  IAEA DIRECTOR- 
GENERAL ELBARADEL WROTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY 
COUNCIL THAT IRAQ\'S AUGUST 5 DECISION TO SUSPEND ITS 
COOPERATION WITH UNSCOM AND THE IAEA \"MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE 
FOR THE ....... TO INVESTIGATE. REMAINING QUESTIONS AND 
CONCERNS...,\" AND THAT IRAQ\'S DECISION WILL ALLOW ONLY 
\"LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION\" OF MONITORING THAT WILL \"FALL FAR 
SHORT OF FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OMV PLAN AND RESULT IN 
A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED LEVEL OF ASSURANCE\" THAT IRAQ IS 
NOT RENEWING ITS PROGRAMS FOR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
UNTIL IRAQ RESUMES COOPERATION AND SATISFIES THE IAEA\'S 
REQUESTS, IT WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE TO DISCUSS TRANSITIONING 
THAT FILE. 
 
10. (U) UNSCOM: UNSCOM IS AN INDEPENDENT UN AGENCY, 
CREATED BY THE SECURITY COUNCIL.   IT REPORTS REGULARLY TO 
THE COUNCIL, AND HAS THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL. 
UNSCOM HAS HAD TWO EXECUTIVE CHAIRMEN: SWEDISH AMBASSADOR 
ROLF EKEUS AND AUSTRALIAN AMBASSADOR RICHARD BUTLER. THEY 
WERE STRONG, INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS BEFORE 
COMING TO UNSCOM, AND THEY\'VE BEEN STRONG, INDEPENDENT 
LEADERS AT UNSCOM. ON AUGUST 5,   IRAQ INFORMED UNSCOM 
CHAIRMAN BUTLER THAT IT WAS CEASING COOPERATION WITH 
UNSCOM\'S DISARMAMENT ACTIVITIES.  THE COUNCIL REACTED, 
CALLING THIS STEP TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.   ON AUGUST 12, 
UNSCOM EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN BUTLER WROTE TO THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL THAT \"IRAQ\'S ACTIONS BRING TO A HALT 
ALL OF THE DISARMAMENT ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION AND 
PLACE LIMITATIONS ON THE RIGHTS OF THE COMMISSION TO 
CONDUCT ITS MONITORING OPERATIONS.\" ON AUGUST 18, THE 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT REPLIED ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL, 
REITERATING THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE COUNCIL FOR IAEA AND 
UNSCOM TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THEIR MANDATES AND NOTING THAT 
IRAQ IS OBLIGED TO COOPERATE WITH THEM IN THEIR ACTIVITIES, 
INCLUDING INSPECTIONS. CHAIRMAN BUTLER WROTE TO IRAQI 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AUGUST 19, AGAIN EXPRESSING A 
WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE COOPERATION, BUT THAT APPROACH WAS 
DECISIVELY REBUFFED BY THE IRAQIS. THE COUNCIL WILL 
CONTINUE TO ADDRESS IRAQ\'S UNILATERAL DECISION NOT TO 
COOPERATE WITH UNSCOM AND THE IAEA. 
 
11. (U) IN SHORT, IRAQ HAS REFUSED TO COOPERATE FURTHER 
WITH THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL OR ITS INSTRUMENTS. IN THIS 
SITUATION, WE RECOMMEND THAT THE NAM AVOID ANY STEP THAT 
WOULD INDICATE DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE POSITION OF THE UN AND 
ITSELF. 
 
12. (U) ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR KUWAIT ONLY: 
 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO FIGHT THESE 
IRAQI ATTEMPTS TO CIRCUMVENT THE UNSC BOTH IN CARTAGENA AND 
IN THE LEAD-UP TO THE DURBAN NAM.  YOUR PERIODIC UPDATES TO 
OUR AMBASSADOR AND DAS NEUMANN CONCERNING THE PROGRESS OF 
YOUR EFFORTS HAVE HELPED US CONSIDERABLY IN DETERMINIG OUR 
NAM STRATEGY. 
 
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE ON THE MARGINS OF THE 
CONFERENCE ITSELF, AND WILL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM 
YOUR DELEGATION THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE DISCUSSIONS. 
 
WE WILL BE USING THE PRECEDING POINTS WITH THE EGYPTIANS, 
BAHRAINIS AND SAUDIS. YOU MAY WISH TO DRAW FROM IT IN YOUR 
DISCUSSIONS WITH NAM PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL. 
 
END POINTS

SUBJECT: EXECUTIVE ORDER AMENDMENT: USAMA BIN LADIN 
 
1.   (U) POSTS MAY DRAW FROM THE FOLLOWING POINTS IN 
BRIEFING HOST COUNTRY INTERLOCUTORS AND RESPONDING TO 
INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENT\'S DECISION TO AMEND 
EXECUTIVE ORDER 12947 TO INCLUDE USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS 
KEY ASSOCIATES. 
 
2.   (U) BEGIN POINTS: 
 
--   ON AUGUST 20,  1998, PRESIDENT CLINTON AMENDED EXECUTIVE 
ORDER NUMBER 12947 TO ADD USAMA BIN LADIN AND THE \"ISLAMIC 
ARMY\", AS WELL AS TWO KEY BIN LADIN ASSOCIATES, ABU HAFS 
AL-MASRI AND RAFA\'I AHMAD TAHA MOUSA,    TO THE LIST OF 
TERRORISTS SUBJECT TO THE PROHIBITIONS CONTAINED IN THAT 
EXECUTIVE ORDER.    THESE PROHIBITIONS INCLUDE THE BLOCKING 
OF ALL PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN THE PROPERTY OF THE 
TERRORISTS,  THE PROHIBITION OF ANY TRANSACTION OR DEALING 
BY UNITED STATES PERSONS OR WITHIN THE UNITED STATES IN 
PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN PROPERTY OF THE TERRORISTS, AND 
THE PROHIBITION OF ANY TRANSACTION BY ANY UNITED STATES 
PERSONS OR WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THAT EVADES OR AVOIDS, 
OR HAS THE PURPOSE OF EVADING OR AVOIDING, ANY OF THE 
PROHIBITIONS SET FORTH IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. 
 
--   THE PRESIDENT FIRST ISSUED THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON 
JANUARY 23,  1995, TO COUNTER THE THREAT POSED BY GRAVE ACTS 
OF VIOLENCE COMMITTED BY FOREIGN TERRORISTS SEEKING TO 
DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS.   SUCH TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES POSE AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE 
UNITED STATES. 
 
--   USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATES 
HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED UPON THEIR SUPPORTERS TO PERFORM 
ACTS OF VIOLENCE.   BIN LADIN HAS DECLARED THAT KILLING 
AMERICANS AND THEIR ALLIES \"IS AN INDIVIDUAL DUTY FOR EVERY 
MUSLIM IN ORDER TO LIBERATE THE AL-AQSA MOSQUE AND THE HOLY 
MOSQUE.\" 
 
--   WE BELIEVE IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THWART THE ABILITY OF 
USAMA BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES TO FINANCE AND CARRY OUT 
TERRORISM.     BIN LADIN DIRECTS A NETWORK THAT ORGANIZES, 
FUNDS, AND INSPIRES A WIDE RANGE OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST 
GROUPS WHICH PERPETRATE ACTS OF TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. 
THE BIN LADIN NETWORK IS MULTI-NATIONAL AND HAS ESTABLISHED 
A WORLDWIDE PRESENCE.   SENIOR FIGURES IN THE NETWORK ARE 
ALSO SENIOR LEADERS IN OTHER ISLAMIC TERRORIST NETWORKS, 
INCLUDING THOSE DESIGNATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AS 
FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS,  SUCH AS THE EGYPTIAN AL- 
GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYYA AND THE EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD. 
 
--   WE HAVE CONVINCING INTELLIGENCE THAT BIN LADIN\'S 
NETWORK, WORKING WITH OTHER TERRORIST GROUPS, WAS BEHIND 
THE HEINOUS ATTACKS OF AUGUST 7 AGAINST THE U.S. EMBASSIES 
IN NAIROBI, KENYA AND DAR ES SALAAM,  TANZANIA. ELEMENTS OF 
BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK WERE ALSO INVOLVED LAST WEEK IN A PLOT 
TO ATTACK OTHER U.S. EMBASSIES. 
 
--  THESE LATEST ATROCITIES IN AFRICA ARE NOT THE FIRST 
OCCASION IN WHICH MEMBERS OF BIN LADIN\'S NETWORK HAVE 
CARRIED OUT ACTS OF TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICA AND ITS 
FRIENDS. 
 
--   THE BIN LADIN NETWORK SUPPORTS TERRORISTS IN 
AFGHANISTAN, BOSNIA, CHECHNYA, TAJIKISTAN,  SOMALIA, YEMEN, 
AND NOW KOSOVO.   IT ALSO TRAINS MEMBERS OF TERRORIST 
NETWORKS FROM SUCH DIVERSE COUNTRIES AS THE PHILIPPINES, 
ALGERIA AND ERITREA.   ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE RELIABLE 
EVIDENCE THAT THE BIN LADIN NETWORK HAS BEEN ACTIVELY 
SEEKING TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,  INCLUDING 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS. 
 
--   WE ENCOURAGE OTHER GOVERNMENTS TO UNDERTAKE SIMILAR 
EFFORTS TO DISRUPT THE ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL DEALINGS OF 
BIN LADIN AND HIS ASSOCIATES.

TAGS: PGOV, PREL, AF,  PK 
SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN:   HAMID KARZAI ON NEXT STEPS 
 
(U)  CLASSIFIED BY MICHAEL E. MALINOWSKI, DIRECTOR, SA/PAB. 
REASON:   1.5 (B AND D). 
 
1.   (U)  SA/PAB DIRECTOR MALINOWSKI AND DESKOFFS RAPOPORT 
AND HUSHEK HAD EXTENSIVE JANUARY 6 TOUR D\'HORIZON WITH 
INTRA AFGHAN DIALOGUE FIGURE AND FORMER RESISTANCE DEPUTY 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAMID KARZAI, WHO IS SON OF AN IMPORTANT 
AFGHAN TRIBAL LEADER. 
 
CRITICAL OF MOJADDEDI/GAILANI INITIATIVE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.   (C)  KARZAI WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF THE NEW 
INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED BY TWO FORMER AFGHAN RESISTANCE 
LEADERS, EX-PRESIDENT MOJADDEDI AND PIR GAILANI, TO 
ESTABLISH A THIRD FORCE,  PARTICULARLY THE FACT THAT THEY 
WERE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING BOTH THE TALIBAN AND MASOOD 
FROM PARTICIPATING IN THEIR PROPOSED MEETING.   THIS, HE 
BELIEVED, WOULD MAKE THE FACTIONS LOOK UPON THEM AS 
ANTAGONISTS AND NEGATE THEIR PEACE EFFORT.   HE WAS ALSO 
SKEPTICAL OF THEIR CLAIMS THAT THE FORMER KING WOULD ATTEND 
THE SESSION AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR PROGRAM.    THE FACT 
THAT AFGHAN NEUTRALS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE FORMER KING, 
KARZAI NOTED,   IMPEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALTERNATIVE 
PASHTUN LEADERSHIP THAT COULD CHALLENGE THE TALIBAN. 
FOCUSING ON ALLEGED CLOSE LINKS BETWEEN MOJADDEDI AND 
GAILANI AND THE GOP, HE OPINED THAT THEY WERE BEING USED AS 
A TOOL BY PAKISTAN IN THAT THEIR RESTRICTIVE POLICY 
REGARDING THEIR NEW GROUPING WOULD ALIENATE OTHERS, NEGATE 
THE DIALOGUE EFFORT, AND LEAVE THE TALIBAN AS THE SOLE 
PASHTUN ALTERNATIVE. 
 
DISILLUSIONED WITH DIALOGUE 
--------------------------- 
 
3.   KARZAI NOTED SOME DISILLUSION ON THE PART OF INTRA- 
AFGHAN DIALOGUE ORGANIZERS AS WELL, CITING ABDUL HAQ IN 
PARTICULAR.    KARZAI CRITICIZED THE LEADERSHIP OF DIALOGUE 
CHAIRMAN SIRAT, NOTING THAT HE HAD NOT TAKEN AN AGGRESSIVE 
ROLE AND WAS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE EFFORT ONLY PART TIME, 
STILL TEACHING HIS CLASSES AT THE UNIVERSITY IN MECCA. 
 
A DIFFERENT KIND OF JIRGA 
------------------------- 
 
4.   (C)  KARZAI RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRIBAL JIRGA, 
AS DISTINCT FROM A LOYA JIRGA (GRAND ASSEMBLY) AS AN 
INTERMEDIATE STEP.    AFTER NOTING THAT A PASHTUN TRIBAL 
JIRGA COULD PRESENT PROBLEMS FOR PAKISTAN, AS PASHTUN 
TRIBES FROM WITHIN PAKISTAN WOULD HAVE TO BE INCLUDED, HE 
DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERAL REGIONAL/PROVINCIAL 
JIRGAS.    HE ASKED FOR USG SUPPORT FOR THIS ALONG THE SAME 
LINES AS WAS PROVIDED FOR THE BONN DIALOGUE, A PUBLIC 
STATEMENT ENDORSING IT AS AN EFFORT TO BRING PEACE TO 
AFGHANISTAN.    MALINOWSKI REPLIED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A 
PROBLEM.    KARZAI ADDED THAT SUCH A BODY COULD ALSO ISSUE A 
STATEMENT OPPOSING THE PRESENCE OF USAMA BIN LADEN IN 
AFGHANISTAN AND CALL FOR HIS EXPULSION.    IN THIS CONTEXT, 
KARZAI SUGGESTED THAT THE PASHTU AND DARI SERVICES, WHICH 
HAVE WIDE AUDIENCES WITHIN AFGHANISTAN,   INTERVIEW TRIBAL 
LEADERS, QUESTIONING THEM PARTICULARLY REGARDING THEIR 
VIEWS CONCERNING BIN LADEN\'S PRESENCE IN AFGHANISTAN, AND 
AIR THE DENUNCIATIONS THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT.    WE AGREED 
TO PASS THIS ON BUT ALSO ADVISED HIM TO BE IN CONTACT WITH 
USIS ISLAMABAD. 
 
VISIT OF TRIBAL FIGURES TO U.S. 
------------------------------- 
 
5.  (U)   KARZAI ALSO RAISED A PROPOSED VISIT BY TRIBAL 
LEADERS,  INCLUDING PROMINENT CLERGY, TO THE U.S.  WE SAID 
WE AWAITED HIS LIST OE NAMES AND ALSO ADVISED HIM TO 
CONTACT USIS ISLAMABAD AND CONSULATE PESHAWAR REGARDING 
THIS PROJECT.

SUBJECT: TALIBAN CLAIM BIN LADEN OUT OF THEIR TERRITORY 
 
REF:   A) ISLAMABAD 875 (NOTAL)   B) ISLAMABAD 1171 (NOTAL) 
C)   ISLAMABAD 1273 (NOTAL)  D)   ISLAMABAD 1271 (NOTAL) 
 
CLASSIFIED BY KARL F.  INDERFURTH, A/S,  SA.  REASON:  1.5 (D). 
 
1.   (S)  SUMMARY:  TALIBAN UN \"PERMREP DESIGNATE\" ABDUL 
HAKEEM MUJAHID TOLD SA A/S INDERFURTH FEBRUARY 17 THAT 
USAMA BIN LADEN  (UBL) WAS NO LONGER IN TALIBAN-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY.   HE WOULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER DETAILS BUT 
IMPLIED THAT UBL WAS ELSEWHERE IN AFGHANISTAN THOUGH EN 
ROUTE TO A FOREIGN DESTINATION.    HE SAID  THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
WOULD BE CLARIFIED IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.    A/S INDERFURTH 
EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT THAT UBL HAD NOT BEEN EXPELLED TO 
A JURISDICTION WHERE HE COULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE; THIS 
WAS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL.   HE ALSO ASKED THE TALIBAN TO EXPEL 
UBL\'S NETWORK FROM AFGHANISTAN AND CLOSE EXISTING TERRORIST 
TRAINING FACILITIES.   MUJAHID ASKED THAT USG PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS ON THIS DEVELOPMENT NOT DWELL ON EXISTING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE TALL BAN, NOTING THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN 
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE TALIBAN OPPOSED TO UBL.    A/S INDERFURTH 
REPLIED THAT WHILE WE COULD NOT WISH AWAY OTHER ISSUES, BIN 
LADEN\'S DEPARTURE FROM AFGHANISTAN WOULD REMOVES A MAJOR 
ROADBLOCK TO FUTURE PROGRESS.   END SUMMARY. 
 
2.   (U)  SA A/S KARL F. INDERFURTH CALLED IN TALIBAN NEW 
YORK \"PERMREP DESIGNATE\" ABDUL HAKEEM MUJAHID FEBRUARY 1~ 
PRIMARILY TO REVIEW RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING USAMA BIN 
LADEN  (UBL) AND AS PART OF OUR SERIES OF CONTACTS WITH THE 
AFGHAN FACTIONS.   MUJAHID WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ASSISTANT 
NOORULLAH ZADRAN.   SA/PAB DIRECTOR MALINOWSKI AND AFGHAN 
DESKOFF RAPOPORT SAT IN.   THE MEETING LASTED ALMOST 90 
MINUTES. 
 
 
WHERE IS USAMA? 
 
3.   (S)  A/S INDERFURTH REVIEWED HIS FEBRUARY 3 MEETING 
WITH TALIBAN \"DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER\" MULLAH JALIL IN 
ISLAMABAD,  RESTATING POINTS DELIVERED ON THAT OCCASION (REF 
A).  HE NOTED THE TALIBAN RESPONSE THAT THEY HAD IMPOSED 
FURTHER RESTRICTIONS UPON UBL  (REF B) BUT STATED THAT THIS 
DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.   HE CITED RECENT REPORTS OF 
ONGOING THREATENING ACTIVITIES FROM UBL AND HIS NETWORK AND 
MADE THE POINT THAT RECENT REPORTS FROM TALIBAN SOURCES 
THAT UBL HAD \"GONE MISSING\"  (REF C) CONTRADICTED TALIBAN 
CLAIMS TO HAVE HIM UNDER CONTROL. 
 
4.   (S)  MUJAHID CITED THE IMPORTANCE OF A/S INDERFURTH\'S 
MESSAGE TO JALIL AND SAID HE HAD PERSONALLY CONTACTED 
VARIOUS TALIBAN AUTHORITIES TO GET A POSITIVE RESPONSE SO 
AS TO PROMOTE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.  HE 
ASSERTED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE TALIBAN TO EXPEL UBL 
BECAUSE OF THE EFFECT UPON PUBLIC OPINION IN AFGHANISTAN 
AND THE ISLAMIC WORLD, BUT THE TALL BAN HAD IMPOSED 
RESTRICTIONS UPON HIM IN HOPES OF FORCING HIM TO LEAVE 
WILLINGLY.   MUJAHID THEN DECLARED THAT UBL WAS NO LONGER IN 
TALIBAN-CONTROLLED TERRITORY BUT WOULD NOT SAY WHERE HE WAS 
OR HOW THIS HAD COME ABOUT, ONLY THAT THE SITUATION WOULD 
BE CLARIFIED IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.   HE INTIMATED THAT UBL 
MIGHT STILL BE IN AFGHANISTAN,  PERHAPS WITH A COMMANDER NOT 
LINKED TO THE TALIBAN  (IN THIS CONTEXT HE REFERRED TO UBL\'S 
PREVIOUS TIES TO HEKMATYAR,  SAYYAF, AND MASOOD.) BUT THAT 
HIS ULTIMATE DESTINATION WAS AN UNSPECIFIED OTHER COUNTRY. 
HE STATED THAT TALIBAN LEADER MULLAH OMAR HAD ANNOUNCED 
UBL\'S DEPARTURE PUBLICLY OVER TALIBAN RADIO SHARIAT; HE 
PROCEEDED TO DO THE SAME WITH AWAITING JOURNALISTS AFTER 
THE MEETING. 
 
 
BRING UBL TO JUSTICE 
 
5.   (S) A/S INDERFURTH SAID WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE 
TALIBAN HAD NOT EXPELLED UBL TO A JURISDICTION WHERE HE 
COULD BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.   HE EXPRESSED FURTHER CONCERN 
REGARDING THE TIME NECESSARY TO DETERMINE UBL\'S 
WHEREABOUTS, NOTING THAT THE AMBIGUITY POSED CERTAIN RISKS 
FOR AFGHANISTAN AND URGED THAT THE TALIBAN PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  IF UBL STAGED A 
TERRORIST ACT DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD,  BEFORE HIS 
WHEREABOUTS COULD BE ESTABLISHED,  THE TALIBAN COULD STILL 
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. HE STATED WE WOULD CONTINUE EFFORTS TO 
LOCATE HIM, ADDING THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN AS AN ACT OF BAD 
FAITH IF UBL WERE PERMITTED TO RETURN TO TALIBAN-CONTROLLED 
TERRITORY.   MUJAHID RESPONDED THAT UBL WOULD NOT RETURN TO 
TALIBAN TERRITORY, THOUGH HE LATER CAVEATED THAT THIS WAS 
NOT IN HIS OFFICIAL INSTRUCTIONS. 
 
 
AND EXPEL HIS FOLLOWERS 
 
6.   (S) A/S INDERFURTH ADDED THAT WE WERE ALSO CONCERNED 
ABOUT UBL\'S NETWORK AND TRAINING CAMPS INSIDE AFGHANISTAN. 
HE HOPED THE TALIBAN WOULD TAKE QUICK ACTION TO REMOVE 
THESE SUPPORT STRUCTURES AND EXPEL THOSE MEMBERS OF HIS 
NETWORK LEFT BEHIND.   MUJAHID RESPONDED THAT AFGHANISTAN 
HAD NEVER BEEN A TERRORIST STATE AND THAT AFGHANS HAD NEVER 
COMMITTED ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM,  EVEN AGAINST THE 
SOVIETS.   THE TALIBAN ITSELF DID NOT SUPPORT AN AVOWEDLY 
EXPANSIONIST INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT, 
LIKE IRANIAN-SUPPORTED HEZBOLLAH OR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD, 
AND WAS NOT IN FAVOR OR THE TRAINING IN AFGHANISTAN OF 
KASHMIRIS, ARABS,  SAUDIS, SUDANESE OR OTHERS IN TECHNIQUES 
OF TERRORISM.   MUJAHID NOTED THAT BIN LADEN\'S PERSONAL VIEW 
OF INTERNATIONAL ISLAM WAS MUCH CLOSER TO THAT OF MANY OF 
THE TALIBAN\'S AFGHAN RIVALS THAN TO THAT OF THE TALIBAN 
ITSELF.   MUJAHID EQUIVOCATED ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF CAMPS 
IN TALIBAN TERRITORY BUT A/S INDERFURTH REPEATED THAT THEY 
WERE PRESENT AND THAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN TO DISMANTLE 
THEM. 
 
 
POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT REQUESTED 
 
7.   (S)  NOTING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD PUT ITSELF IN A 
DIFFICULT POSITION REGARDING UBL, MUJAHID ASKED THAT USG 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS NOT DWELL ON DIFFERENCES OVER OTHER 
ISSUES  (I.E.  DRUGS, HUMAN RIGHTS, GENDER, ETC.), STATING 
THAT THIS WOULD WEAKEN THOSE WITHIN THE TALIBAN WHO FAVORED 
BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.    HE URGED A POSITIVE 
REFERENCE TO THIS ACTION.    A/S INDERFURTH SAID THAT WE 
WOULD CONSIDER UBL\'S DEPARTURE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT, 
NOTING THAT BIN LADEN HAD BEEN A MAJOR OBSTACLE,   \"A BOULDER 
IN THE ROAD.\"    WE COULD NOT WISH OTHER ISSUES AWAY, BUT 
ONCE BIN LADEN WAS BEHIND US WE COULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, 
INCLUDING HUMAN RIGHTS, BILATERALLY AND THROUGH THE UN IN 
AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR RELATIONSHIP.    MUJAHID CITED THE 
STRONG U.S. RELATIONSHIP    WITH ISLAMIC SAUDI ARABIA AND 
SAID WE COULD HAVE EVEN BETTER RELATIONS WITH THE TALIBAN. 
 
8.   AS AN EXAMPLE OF A POSITIVE STEP, A/S INDERFURTH NOTED 
HIS SIGNATURE YESTERDAY ON A DISASTER DECLARATION THAT 
WOULD AUTHORIZE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF THE 
FEBRUARY 11 EARTHQUAKE    (REF D) AS A POSITIVE STEP AND 
EVIDENCE OF OUR DESIRE TO HELP THE AFGHAN PEOPLE. 
 
 
TALIBAN EXPANDING CONTACTS 
 
9.   (S)  A/S INDERFURTH RAISED UN SPECIAL ENVOY BRAHIMI\'S 
UPCOMING VISIT TO THE REGION, NOTING THAT IT WAS COMING AT 
A TIME WHEN THE TALIBAN WAS EXPANDING CONTACTS WITH OTHER 
AFGHAN FACTIONS AND WITH AFGHAN MODERATES.    HE STRESSED OUR 
BELIEF THAT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT 
BUT RATHER A NEED FOR A POLITICAL SETTLEMENT AND URGED THE 
TALIBAN TO WORK WITH BRAHIMI IN THIS REGARD.    MUJAHID 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONTACTS WITH MASOOD AND THE NEUTRALS, 
ADDING THAT THE TALIBAN HAD ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH 
PROFESSOR BURHANUDDIN RABBANI\'S PEOPLE IN DUBAL AS WELL. 
HE AGREED THAT A MILITARY SOLUTION WAS \"NOT DESIRABLE\" BUT 
SAID THAT DIPLOMATIC MEANS DID NOT ALWAYS WORK.  MUJAHID 
WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE AFGHAN MODERATES, WHOM HE 
DESCRIBED AS PARTISANS OF THE FORMER KING.  HE SAID THEY 
CONFINED THEIR ACTIVITIES TO \"MAKING INEFFECTIVE STATEMENTS 
ABROAD,\" BUT THEY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO RETURN TO 
AFGHANISTAN AND WORK WITH THE TALIBAN TO REBUILD THE 
COUNTRY. 
 
10.   (S)  COMMENT: MUJAHID HAS LONG INDICATED HIS OWN 
OPPOSITION TO UBL AND SUPPORT FOR BETTER RELATIONS BETWEEN 
THE U.S. AND THE TALIBAN. IT WAS CLEARLY GRATIFYING FOR 
HIM TO DELIVER THE NEWS THAT UBL HAD LEFT TALL BAN 
TERRITORY. MUJAHID WAS MORE EMOTIONAL DURING THIS SESSION 
THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER.

CLASSIFIED BY IO ASSISTANT SECRETARY DAVID WELCH.  REASON: 
1.5(B,D). 
 
1.  (U)  THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE. 
 
2.  (C)  THE LETTER WHICH QADHAFI PROVIDED TO PRESIDENT 
MANDELA 3/19 APPEARS TO REPRESENT PROGRESS TOWARD LIBYAN 
COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1192.  ACCORDINGLY, USUN SHOULD 
APPROACH THE SYG AT EARLIEST CONVENIENCE TO CONVEY THE 
MESSAGE IN PARA 3.  APPROACH TO THE SYG SHOULD BE 
COORDINATED WITH UKUN IF POSSIBLE. 
 
3.  (C)  BEGIN TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- THE MARCH 19 LETTER FROM COLONEL QADHAFI APPEARS 
POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT. 
 
-- ONCE AGAIN, WE COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS TO DATE TO OBTAIN 
LIBYAN COMPLIANCE WITH RESOLUTION 1192, AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE THE ISSUE TO A SUCCESSFUL 
CONCLUSION. 
 
-- WE WOULD APPRECIATE AN UPDATE ON STATUS OF ARRANGEMENTS 
FOR TRANSFERRING THE SUSPECTS TO DUTCH CUSTODY.  WE URGE 
YOU TO PUT THOSE ARRANGEMENTS INTO MOTION AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. 
 
-- WE BELIEVE THAT PRIORITY NOW MUST BE ON EFFECTING 
TRANSFER, RATHER THAN ON FURTHER DISCUSSION OF POST- 
TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS. 
 
-- WE RECONFIRM OUR READINESS -- AFTER THE TWO SUSPECTS 
HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED -- TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND OUR 
BRITISH COUNTERPARTS, IN A MEETING WHICH INCLUDES LIBYAN 
REPRESENTATION, TO DISCUSS FURTHER REQUIREMENTS. 
 
-- IT IS OUR VIEW THAT EXISTING SECURITY COUNCIL 
RESOLUTIONS ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CONTENTS OF THE MARCH 19 
LIBYAN LETTER. 
 
-- NOW THAT THE LIBYAN RESPONSE IS IN HAND, HOWEVER, WE 
WOULD APPRECIATE RECEIVING A COPY OF YOUR MESSAGE TO 
COLONEL QADHAFI. 
 
-- ONCE WE HAVE THE COMPLETE CORRESPONDENCE FILE, 
INCLUDING YOUR LETTER, WE CAN ASSESS WHETHER FURTHER STEPS 
ARE WARRANTED. 
 
-- AGAIN, WE WANT TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH YOU TO ENSURE 
A POSITIVE CONCLUSION TO THIS ISSUE. 
 
END TALKING POINTS. 
 
4.  (C)  FYI: ONCE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW SYG\'S LETTER

SUBJECT: DESIGNATION OF FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
 
CLASSIFIED BY JOHN LIMBERT, DEPUTY COORDINATOR FOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM,S/CT. REASON 1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) BEGIN SUMMARY: THE 8 OCTOBER 1999 ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE DESIGNATION OF \"FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS\" IS LIKELY TO ATTRACT MEDIA COVERAGE AND 
OFFICIAL INTEREST IN SOME COUNTRIES. CHIEFS OF MISSION AND 
PUBLIC DIPLOMACY SECTIONS SHOULD CONSIDER GOVERNMENT-TO- 
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AS WELL AS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ACTIONS 
APPROPRIATE TO THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. INSTRUCTIONS FOR 
SELECTED MISSIONS WILL FOLLOW BY SEPTEL. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (C) ON 1 OCTOBER 1999 THE SECRETARY OF STATE, AS REQUIRED BY 
THE ANTI-TERRORISM AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT OF 1996, 
WILL DESIGNATE \"FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.\" UNDER 
THE STATUTE, THE SECRETARY MUST MAKE THESE DESIGNATIONS AT 
 
LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS. DETAILS ON THE HISTORY, PROCESS, 
AND EFFECTS OF THE DESIGNATIONS ARE PROVIDED BELOW. 
 
3. (C) THE 1999 LIST CONTAINS 28 DESIGNATIONS; THE 1997 LIST 
DESIGNATED 30 ORGANIZATIONS. THREE WERE DROPPED, ONE WAS 
ADDED, AND 27 ARE REDESIGNATED. 
 
4. (C) THE DEMOCRATIC FRONT FOR THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE 
(DFLP) AND MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT DISSIDENTS 
(FPMR/D) WERE DROPPED DUE TO LACK OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY.

CEASED TO EXIST. 
 
6. (C) AL-QA\'IDA, THE ORGANIZATION/NETWORK BEHIND THE BOMBINGS 
OF OUR EMBASSIES IN KENYA AND TANZANIA, IS ADDED. 
 
7. (C) SINCE THE LIST CONTAINS NO MAJOR CHANGES OR SURPRISES, 
DEPARTMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE LIST WILL ATTRACT

11. (U) BACKGROUND: 
 
(U) LEGAL EFFECTS OF DESIGNATION 
 
A) UNLAWFUL FOR A PERSON IN THE U.S. OR SUBJECT TO THE 
   JURISDICTION OF U.S. TO PROVIDE FUNDS OR OTHER MATERIAL 
   SUPPORT TO AN FTO 
 
B) ALIENS CAN BE DENIED VISAS OR EXCLUDED IF THEY ARE MEMBERS 
   OR REPRESENTATIVES OF AN FTO 
 
C) U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MUST BLOCK FUNDS OF FTOS AND 
   THEIR AGENTS AND REPORT THE BLOCKAGE. 
 
12. (U) THREE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION 
 
(U) THE THREE CRITERIA ARE: 
 
A. THE ORGANIZATION MUST BE FOREIGN. 
 
B. THE ORGANIZATION MUST ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AS DEFINED 
   IN SECTION 212 (A)(3)(B) OF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY 
   ACT. 
 
C. THE ORGANIZATION\'S ACTIVITIES MUST THREATEN THE SECURITY OF 
   U.S. NATIONALS OR THE NATIONAL SECURITY (NATIONAL DEFENSE, 
   FOREIGN RELATIONS OR THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS) OF THE UNITED 
   STATES. 
 
 
13. (U) THE PROCESS 
 
(U) THE STATUTE REQUIRES THAT THE DESIGNATIONS BE SUBJECT 
TO JUDICIAL REVIEW. (FYI: THE LTTE AND THE MEK BOTH 
MOUNTED LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THEIR 1997 DESIGNATIONS AND 
LOST THEIR APPEALS.) THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHICH THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE BASED HER FINDINGS WERE MADE FOLLOWING 
AN EXHAUSTIVE INTERAGENCY EFFORT. WE HAVE KEPT AN ADMINIS- 
TRATIVE RECORD OF EACH RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE THE RECORDS 
WOULD REVEAL INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS, THEY ARE AND 
WILL REMAIN CLASSIFIED. 
 
14. (U) THE DESIGNATIONS EXPIRE IN TWO YEARS UNLESS RENEWED. 
THE LAW ALSO ALLOWS GROUPS TO BE ADDED AT ANY TIME FOLLOWING 
A DECISION BY THE SECRETARY, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY. 
DESIGNATIONS CAN ALSO BE REVOKED IF THE SECRETARY DETERMINES 
THAT THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR DOING SO AND NOTIFIES CONGRESS. 
CONGRESS CAN ALSO PASS LEGISLATION TO REVOKE DESIGNATIONS. 
 
15. (U) ORIGIN 
 
(U) THE LAW RESPONDS TO CONCERNS ABOUT FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS RAISING FUNDS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
(U) SOME TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PORTRAYED THEMSELVES AS 
RAISING MONEY FOR CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS CLINICS OR 
SCHOOLS. THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE HELPED RECRUIT SUPPORTERS AND 
ACTIVISTS AND HAVE SOMETIMES PROVIDED SUPPORT TO TERRORISTS. 
 
(U) CONGRESS WAS QUITE AWARE THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
MIGHT CLOAK THEIR ACTIVITIES WITH PROFESSIONS OF GOOD WORKS 
AND ADDRESSED THE MATTER AS FOLLOWS: \"FOREIGN ORGANIZATIONS 
THAT ENGAGE IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY ARE SO TAINTED BY THEIR 
CRIMINAL CONDUCT THAT ANY CONTRIBUTION TO SUCH AN 
ORGANIZATION FACILITATES THAT CONDUCT. (SECTION 301(A)(7)).\" 
 
(U) THEREFORE, ANY CONTRIBUTION TO A FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, REGARDLESS OF THE INTENDED PURPOSE, IS 
PROHIBITED BY THE STATUTE, UNLESS THE CONTRIBUTION IS 
LIMITED TO MEDICINE OR RELIGIOUS MATERIALS. 
 
16. (U) WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES 
 
A) ON 1 OCTOBER 99 THE SECRETARY SENDS THE DESIGNATIONS 
     TO THE CONGRESS AS A CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT. 
 
B) ON 8 OCTOBER THE DESIGNATIONS ARE PUBLISHED IN THE 
    FEDERAL REGISTER. 
 
C) ON 8 OCTOBER A SENIOR DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL (IDENTITY 
    PENDING) WILL ANNOUNCE THE DESIGNATIONS AND BRIEF AT 
    THE STATE DEPARTMENT. (NOTE: DUE TO POSSIBLE 
    SCHEDULING CONFLICTS, THE DATE FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
    AND BRIEFING MAY SLIP TO TUESDAY, 12 OCTOBER.) 
 
D) AFTER THE STATE DEPARTMENT BRIEFING A SUITABLE 
    OFFICIAL (PROBABLY COUNTERTERRORISM COORDINATOR 
    AMBASSADOR MICHAEL SHEEHAN) WILL BRIEF AT PA\'S 
    WASHINGTON FOREIGN PRESS CENTER. 
 
 
17. (C) PUBLIC AFFAIRS/PUBLIC DIPLOMACY GOALS FOR THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT: 
 
A) DISCREDIT FTOS AND WEAKEN PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT 
    SUPPORT FOR THEM. 
B) DISCOURAGE FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEM 
C)  REEMPHASIZE U.S. GOVERNMENT COUNTERTERRORISM POLICY. 
 
18. (U) MISSIONS ARE INVITED TO SUGGEST PUBLIC ACTIVITIES, 
SUCH AS BACKGROUNDERS WITH INDIVIDUAL JOURNALISTS AND THE 
LIKE. PLEASE SEND SUGGESTIONS BY EMAIL TO S/CT SENIOR 
ADVISOR FOR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY DONALD R. HAMILTON. (202) 
647-9390.

BIN LADEN: A PUBLIC DIPLOMACY FACT SHEET 
 
1. NOTE: THIS FACT SHEET MAY BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
PREVIOUS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY FACT SHEET, \"TALKING ABOUT 
TERRORISM.\" 
 
2. THE TALIBAN MOVEMENT OF AFGHANISTAN, LED BY MULLAH 
MOHAMMA OMAR, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE SAFE HAVEN TO THE 
INDICTED TERRORIST USAMA BIN LADEN. SPOKESMEN FOR THE 
TALIBAN, AND ITS MASS MEDIA, CONTINUE THEIR DISINFORMATION 
CAMPAIGN THAT NO ONE HAS PROVIDED THE TALIBAN WITH PROOF 
OF BIN LADEN\'S ALLEGED CRIMES. 
 
3. ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF LAW AS PRACTICED BY THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS, A JUDGE AND JURY 
DETERMINE PROOF OF GUILT BASED ON EVIDENCE SUBMITTED 
DURING A TRIAL. 
 
4. EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS AGAINST USAMA BIN LADEN AND 
HIS COLLABORATORS. THIS EVIDENCE IS PUBLIC INFORMATION 
AVAILABLE TO ALL AT TWO INTERNET WEB SITES, WHICH ARE 
LISTED BELOW. 
 
5. USAMA BIN LADEN, LEADER OF THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION 
AL-QAIDA, IS CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE AUGUST 7, 
1998, BOMBINGS OF THE U.S. EMBASSIES IN NAIROBI, KENYA, 
AND DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA. THESE ATTACKS RESULTED IN 
THE DEATHS OF MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE, INCLUDING 12 AMERICAN 
CITIZENS, AND INJURIES TO MORE THAN 4,000 INDIVIDUALS, 
AMONG WHOM WERE MUSLIMS. A SUMMARY OF THE FACTS OF THIS 
TERRORIST ACT CAN BE FOUND ON THE U.S. FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATION\'S INTERNET WEB SITE: 
 
WWW.FBI.GOV/MAJCASES/EASTAFRICA.SUMMARY.HTM 
 
6. AS A RESULT OF EXTENSIVE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION, AND 
WORKING CLOSELY WITH KENYA, TANZANIA, AND OTHER NATIONS, 
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS INDICTED OR FILED CRIMINAL 
COMPLAINTS AGAINST BIN LADEN AND 16 OF HIS ASSOCIATES FOR 
THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE TWO BOMBINGS AND OTHER TERRORIST 
CRIMES. THE U.S. INDICTMENT DETAILING THE CHARGES AGAINST 
BIN LADEN CAN BE FOUND ON THE INTERNET WEB SITE OF THE

SUBJECT: SUDANESE INVOLVEMENT IN TERRORISM 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: EDMUND HULL, DEPUTY COORDINATOR FOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM, S/CT. REASON: 1.5 (B) (C) (D) 
 
REF: STATE 113624 
 
1. (S) THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE. 
 
2. (S) DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS THAT THE HOST GOVERNMENTS AT 
ADDRESSEE POSTS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO ENDORSE THE USG 
POSITION AGAINST LIFTING SUDAN SANCTIONS BECAUSE THEY LACK 
EVIDENCE THAT THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT STILL SUPPORTS 
TERRORISM. THE FOLLOWING NON-PAPER, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED 
SECRET/RELEASABLE TO FRANCE, ARGENTINA, BANGLADESH, AND THE 
NETHERLANDS, CONTAINS USG INFORMATION IMPLICATING KHARTOUM 
IN CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. EMBASSIES ARE 
REQUESTED TO SHARE THIS NON-PAPER WITH HOST GOVERNMENT 
INTERLOCUTORS AT AN APPROPRIATE SENIOR LEVEL IN AN ATTEMPT 
TO PERSUADE THEM THAT UNSC SANCTIONS SHOULD NOT BE LIFTED 
AT THIS TIME. 
 
3. (S/RELEASABLE TO FRANCE, ARGENTINA, BANGLADESH, AND THE 
NETHERLANDS ONLY - ENTIRE TEXT) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: 
 
CURRENT STATUS OF SUDAN\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM 
 
WE HAVE OBSERVED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SUDAN\'S SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORISM SINCE THE DECEMBER 1999 POLITICAL SHAKEUP IN 
WHICH PRESIDENT OMAR AL-BASHIR CONSOLIDATED POWER AND 
SIDELINED NATIONAL ISLAMIC FRONT (NIF) LEADER HASSAN AL- 
TURBAI. TERRORISTS FROM A VARIETY OF ISLAMIC EXTREMIST 
GROUPS---SUCH AS USAMA BIN LADIN\'S ORGANIZATION, EGYPTIAN 
ISLAMIC JIHAD (EIJ), AND HAMAS---CONTINUE TO USE SUDAN FOR 
SAFEHAVEN, TRAINING, AND, IN SOME CASES, AS A PLATFORM TO 
PLAN OPERATIONS. 
 
USAMA BIN LADIN 
 
SUDAN\'S CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO HAVE HAD LITTLE 
EFFECT ON BIN LADIN OPERATIVES, WHO CONTINUE TO OPERATE 
FREELY FROM KHARTOUM. SEVERAL BIN LADIN BUSINESSES--- 
INCLUDING ATYAF INVESTMENTS AND THE KHARTOUM TANNERYE---ARE 
RUN BY AL-QA\'IDA LIEUTENANTS AND STILL OPERATE IN SUDAN, 
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE 
 
-- SUDAN MAINTAINS A FINANCIAL STAKE IN SOME OF THESE 
COMPANIES AND HAS TRIED TO OBSCURE BIN LADIN\'S COMMERCIAL 
TIES BY CHANGING THE NAME OF AT LEAST ONE OF HIS COMPANIES. 
 
EGYPTIAN GROUPS 
 
THE EIJ AND AL-GAMA\'AT AL-ISLAMIYYA ALSO RECEIVE SAFEHAVEN 
AND SUPPORT IN SUDAN. MORE THAN 20 EIJ AND GAMA\'AT MEMBERS 
AFFILIATED WITH BIN LADIN ARE OPERATING IN SUDAN AND MEET 
ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DISCUSS COMMON ISSUES OF CONCERN. 
 
-- SENIOR GAMA\'AT LEADER RIFA\'I TAHA MUSA---WHO IS ALLIED 
WITH BIN LADIN AND LST OCTOBER CALLED FOR AN INCREASE IN 
ANTI-US ATTACKS---TRAVELED TO SUDAN IN APRIL TO RALLY LOCAL 
GAMA\'AT SUPPORT FOR HIS PLAN TO RETURN THE GROUP TO VIOLENT 
OPERATIONS. 
 
PALESTINIAN GROUPS 
 
SEVERAL PALESTINIAN EXTREMIST GROUPS---SUCH AS HAMAS, THE 
PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ) AND THE ABU NIDAL 
ORGANIZATION (ANO)--MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN SUDAN AND 
CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING 
FUNDRAISING, RECRUITMENT, IDEOLOGICAL AND PARAMILITARY 
TRAINING, AND OTHER LOGISTICAL SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. 
 
-- HAMAS--WHICH HAS A FEW HUNDRED SUPPORTERS AMONG THE 
LOCAL PALESTINIAN POPULATION--HAS AN OFFICIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE IN KHARTOUM, OPERATES AT LEAST ONE SMALL 
FRONT COMPANY, AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL NGOS THERE. 
 
-- THE PIJ MAINTAINS A SMALLER PRESENCE THAN HAMAS IN 
SUDAN BUT HAS AN OFFICE AND PERMANENT REPRESENTATION IN 
KHARTOUM. ITS MEMBERSHIP IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF 
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, AND IT ALSO OPERATES SMALL COMMERCIAL 
VENTURES. 
 
SOME INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN WARY 
OF POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUDANESE POLICY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, 
SUGGESTING THEY HAVE MADE PREPARATIONS TO LEAVE SUDAN. 
OTHER SOURCES INDICATE, HOWEVER, THAT PIJ OPERATIVES 
MAINTAIN CLOSE TIES TO THE SUDANESE REGIME DESPITE THE 
CHANGE IN GOVERNMENT. 
 
IRAN AND NGO\'S 
 
SUDAN ALSO PROVIDES A PLATFORM FOR IRAN TO MEET WITH 
EXTREMIST GROUPS AND SUPPORTS VARIOUS NON-GOVERNMENTAL 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE TERRORIST ACTIVITY. 
 
-- IRAN COUNTS ON SUDAN\'S GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY AND BENIGN 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT TO ALLOW IRANIAN AGENTS TO MEET WITH 
AND CHANNEL FUNDS, WEAPONS, AND TRAINING TO ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISTS. 
 
-- KHARTOUM\'S WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SAFEHAVEN 
FOR VARIOUS RADICAL PALESTINIAN GROUPS FACILITATES IRAN\'S 
EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THEIR TERRORIST OPERATIONS AGAINST 
ISRAEL AND TO IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES. 
 
AFRICAN OPPOSITIONISTS 
 
BASHIR HAS TAKEN SOME INITIAL STEPS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS 
WITH ERITREA AND ETHIOPIA SINCE TAKING OFFICE, BUT A 
VARIETY OF REPORTS SUGGEST THAT SUDAN STILL AIDS OPPOSITION 
GROUPS FROM THESE COUNTRIES AND OTHERS---INCLUDING SOMALIA 
AND UGANDA. KHARTOUM PROVIDES THESE GROUPS WITH FUNDING, 
ARMS, MILITARY ASSISTANCE, AND SAFEHAVEN. 
 
LIMITED PROSPECTS FOR CHANGE 
 
BASHIR WILL MOVE AGAINST SOME EXTREMIST GROUPS ONLY IF IT 
SERVES SUDAN\'S BROADER ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INTERESTS AND 
ASSISTS HIM IN HIS ONGOING BATTLE WITH TURABI\'S NIF 
FACTION. PROGRESS WILL ONLY COME SLOWLY. WE CANNOT 
CONFIRM THAT KHARTOUM HAS DEPORTED ANY TERRORIST GROUPS OR 
INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. 
 
-- BASHIR\'S OUSTER OF THE POPULAR ARAB AND ISLAMIC 
CONFERENCE (PAIC) IS AN EARLY INDICATOR THAT HE COULD PLACE 
TRAVEL AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON SOME EXTREMISTS TO ISOLATE 
TURABI FURTHER AND TO PLACATE THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS, SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT, WHICH HAVE 
CRITICIZED SUDAN\'S SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM. 
 
-- BASHIR HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS--SUCH AS SIGNING 
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS TO COMBAT TERRORISM--IF ONLY TO 
ATTRACT MORE WESTERN EUROPEAN AND MODERATE ARAB BUSINESSMEN 
AND TO GAUGE THE RESIDUAL STRENGTH OF TURABI\'S SUPPORTERS. 
BUT HE NONETHELESS HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION CONSISTENT WITH 
THOSE CONVENTIONS.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: APER 
SUBJECT: ANNUAL GUIDE TO ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS 
 
1. SUMMARY.  WE IN HR/CDA RECOGNIZE THAT THE ASSIGNMENT 
AND TRANSFER PROCESS CAN BE A COMPLICATED UNDERTAKING.  WE 
WANT TO HELP EMPLOYEES MAKE THESE TRANSITIONS AS SMOOTHLY 
AS POSSIBLE. WE ARE AWARE THAT EMPLOYEES SOMETIMES FACE 
PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF SOME 
IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER ISSUES.  WE HAVE 
PREPARED THIS MESSAGE TO HELP EMPLOYEES AVOID THESE 
PITFALLS.  OFFICERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THEIR CDOS 
IN HR/CDA IF OTHER ISSUES NOT INCLUDED HERE SHOULD BE 
ADDED IN THE FUTURE. END SUMMARY. 
 
TOURS OF DUTY 
2.  RULES ON R&R: ALL EMPLOYEES SERVING IN POSTS WHICH 
HAVE AN R&R SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MUST SERVE AT THE 
POST FOR THE FULL TOUR OF DUTY TO QUALIFY FOR THE R&R(S). 
ANY CURTAILMENT BY ONE MONTH OR MORE RESULTS IN A 
REQUIREMENT TO EITHER REPAY THE R&R OR REQUEST A WAIVER OF 
THE REPAYMENT FROM THEIR CAREER DEVELOPMENT OFFICER (CDO) 
IN HR/CDA.  EVEN IF THE GAINING AND LOSING POST AND THE 
EMPLOYEE ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT, THE EMPLOYEE MUST REQUEST 
AN R&R REPAYMENT WAIVER IF S/HE WILL DEPART POST PRIOR TO 
THE LAST MONTH OF THE FULL TOUR OF DUTY. 
 
3.  HOME LEAVE: EMPLOYEES BECOME ELIGIBLE TO TAKE HOME 
LEAVE AFTER 18 MONTHS SERVICE OVERSEAS.  TIME IN THE 
UNITED STATES ON R&R, PERSONAL TRAVEL, OR ANNUAL LEAVE 
DOES NOT COUNT TOWARD THE 18 MONTH REQUIREMENT NOR DOES IT 
RESTART THE CLOCK (SEE 3 FAH-1 H-3434.2).  THUS, AN 
EMPLOYEE WHO IS ASSIGNED OVERSEAS FOR 18 MONTHS MAY NOT BE 
ELIGIBLE FOR HOME LEAVE ON TRANSFER IF VACATION OR R&R 
TIME WAS SPENT IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE FACT THAT AN 
EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE FOR HOME LEAVE AFTER 18 MONTHS 
OVERSEAS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN THAT HOME LEAVE WILL 
BE FOLDED INTO THE TOUR OF DUTY.  HOME LEAVE IS NORMALLY 
TAKEN UPON TRANSFER FROM POST OF ASSIGNMENT.  HOWEVER, 
HOME LEAVE IS MANDATED BY STATUTE TO BE TAKEN AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AFTER 36 MONTHS OVERSEAS. FOR THIS REASON, 
EMPLOYEES WITH HOME LEAVE/RETURN FOLDED INTO THEIR TOUR OF 
DUTY SHOULD BE SURE TO TAKE THE HOME LEAVE WHEN INDICATED. 
THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR EMPLOYEES AT R&R POSTS 
WHERE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE HOME LEAVE BE TAKEN AT THE 
MID-POINT IN THE TOUR TO PROTECT ELIGIBILITY FOR R&R. 
EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO TAKE POST TO POST OR 
ROUND TRIP HOME LEAVE TRAVEL MUST GENERALLY SPEND AT LEAST 
20 WORK DAYS IN THE UNITED STATES.  EMPLOYEES MAY REQUEST 
A WAIVER OF THIS HOME LEAVE REQUIREMENT IN ADVANCE. 
 
SEPARATION:  RESIGNATIONS AND RETIREMENTS 
4.  EMPLOYEES FACING SEPARATION, WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR 
INVOLUNTARY, SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO 
REPAY R&R, HOME LEAVE, HOME SERVICE TRANSFER ALLOWANCES, 
DOMESTIC RELOCATION EXPENSES, LONG TERM TRAINING EXPENSES 
AT NON-STATE FACILITIES, PHYSICIANS COMPARABILITY 
ALLOWANCES, OR TO SHIP THEIR OWN EFFECTS IF THEY HAVE NOT 
MET THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS.  PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CDO 
BEFORE MAKING ANY PLANS TO SEPARATE FROM THE FOREIGN 
SERVICE TO BE SURE YOU ARE NOT INCURRING AN UNEXPECTED 
EXPENSE. 
 
5.  THE SELECTION OF THE SEPARATION ADDRESS ON THE OF 126 
RESIDENCY AND DEPENDENCY FORM IS CRITICAL.  THIS ADDRESS 
ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE 
GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND TO SHIP YOUR HOUSEHOLD EFFECTS.  YOU 
MAY CHANGE THAT ADDRESS UP UNTIL YOUR LAST DAY IN ACTIVE 
DUTY STATUS.  AFTER THAT TIME, YOU HAVE A MAXIMUM OF 18 
MONTHS (YOU MUST REQUEST THIS EXTENSION) TO SHIP YOUR HHE 
TO ITS FINAL DESTINATION.  IF THAT FINAL DESTINATION IS 
DIFFERENT FROM THE SEPARATION ADDRESS ON YOUR OF 126, YOUR 
HHE WILL BE SHIPPED ON A COST-CONSTRUCTIVE BASIS TO THE 
FINAL DESTINATION. 
6.  NEW APPOINTEES SIGN AN AGREEMENT TO REMAIN IN THE 
SERVICE FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THEY ENTER ON DUTY. 
SHOULD AN EMPLOYEE RESIGN PRIOR TO THAT ONE-YEAR MARK, 
REPAYMENT OF ALL/ALL APPOINTMENT TRAVEL EXPENSES (FROM 
PLACE OF RESIDENCE AT TIME OF APOINTMENT THROUGH TRAINING 
PER DIEM TO TRAVEL AND SHIPMENT TO FIRST PERMANENT DUTY 
STATION) MUST BE MADE.  NEW APPOINTEES ARE REQUIRED TO 
COMPLETE THE ENTIRE TWO-YEAR FIRST OVERSEAS TOUR (OR ONE 
YEAR OF THE SECOND OVERSEAS TOUR) TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR 
SEPARATION TRAVEL ORDERS AND SHIPMENT OF EFFECTS BACK TO 
THE U.S. 
7.  EMPLOYEES CANNOT TAKE ANNUAL LEAVE JUST PRIOR TO 
SEPARATION FROM THE FOREIGN SERVICE.  SEE 3 FAM 3416. 
8.  EMPLOYEES SHOULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEIR 
RETIREMENT COUNSELOR IN HR/RET DURING SEPARATION 
CONSULTATIONS.  HR/RET HANDLES COLLECTION OF STATE ID 
BADGES, DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS, QUESTIONS ON ANNUITIES/TSP, 
ETC. 
 
AWAY FROM POST EDUCATION ALLOWANCE 
9.  THE STANDARDIZED REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT AN EMPLOYEE 
BE AT POST BEFORE ANY PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE FOR EDUCATION 
ALLOWANCE.  THIS MEANS THAT IF AN EFM WILL REMAIN IN THE 
SAME BOARDING SCHOOL WHILE THE EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS FROM ONE 
POST TO ANOTHER, NO FURTHER PAYMENTS CAN BE MADE UNTIL THE 
EMPLOYEE ARRIVES AT THE NEW POST, AND THE MAXIMUM RATE 
AUTHORIZED MAY CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THE MOVE TO A NEW 
POST.  THE BOARDING SCHOOL MAY REQUIRE THE PAYMENTS TO 
HOLD THE SPACE FOR THE EFM WHILE THE EMPLOYEE IS BETWEEN 
ASSIGNMENTS.  THE EMPLOYEE WILL HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS 
TO MAKE THE PAYMENT AND THEN SEEK REIMBURSEMENT UPON 
ARRIVAL AT THE NEW POST. 
 
EFMS TURNING 21 
10. ELIGIBLE FAMILY MEMBERS (EFMS) REACHING THE AGE OF 21 
ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO TRAVEL TO POST ON GOVERNMENT 
ORDERS UNLESS THE EFM QUALIFIES FOR EDUCATION TRAVEL WHILE 
AGE 21 OR 22.  IF THE EFM TURNS 21 WHILE OVERSEAS, S/HE 
MAY BE TRAVELED BACK TO THE EMPLOYEES SERVICE SEPARATION 
ADDRESS.  ONCE THE EFM REACHES AGE 23, S/HE IS NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR EDUCATION TRAVEL EITHER.  EFMS ARE NOT 
ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AFTER THE 
AGE OF 21, WHETHER ON EDUCATION TRAVEL OR NOT.  EMPLOYEES 
SHOULD MAKE SEPARATE MEDICAL INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR 
THESE FAMILY MEMBERS. 
 
ADDING EFMS/CHANGING HOME LEAVE OR SEPARATION ADDRESS 
11. IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY ANY ITEM ON YOUR RESIDENCY AND 
DEPENDENCY REPORT (HOME LEAVE ADDRESS, SEPARATION ADDRESS, 
DEPENDENTS, ETC.) PLEASE BE SURE TO FILL OUT FORM OF-126 
IN ITS ENTIRETY AS THE NEW FORM SUPERSEDES EVERYTHING ON 
THE OLD FORM.  FORMS SHOULD BE SENT TO YOUR PERSONNEL 
TECHNICIAN IN HR/CDA/ASD. 
 
MEDICAL CLEARANCES 
12. ALL PERSONS MUST HAVE A CURRENT, VALID MEDICAL 
CLEARANCE FOR POST OF ASSIGNMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 
MEDICAL PROGRAM.  EMPLOYEES TRANSFERRING FROM ONE OVERSEAS 
POST TO ANOTHER OVERSEAS POST MUST UPDATE THEIR OWN 
MEDICAL CLEARANCE AND ENSURE THAT THEIR EFMS RECEIVE AN 
UPDATED MEDICAL CLEARANCE PRIOR TO THE END OF THEIR 
CURRENT TOUR OF DUTY OR WHILE ON HOME LEAVE.  EMPLOYEES 
RETURNING TO POST AFTER HOME LEAVE MUST UPDATE THEIR 
MEDICAL CEARANCES AND THE MEDICAL CLEARANCES FOR THEIR 
EFMS PRIOR TO THE END OF HOME LEAVE.  APPOINTMENTS SHOULD 
BE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF HOME LEAVE TO ENSURE ADEQUATE 
TIME IS ALLOWED TO COMPLETE THE CLEARANCE PROCESS.  MED 
MUST APPROVE THE POST OF ASSIGNMENT FOR ALL EMPLOYEES OR 
EFMS HOLDING A LIMITED MEDICAL CLEARANCE PRIOR TO ANY 
DIRECT TRANSFER OR OTHER ASSIGNMENT ROTATION.  TO OBTAIN 
INFORMATION ON HOW TO UPDATE YOUR MEDICAL CLEARANCE, 
CONTACT THE POST MEDICAL OFFICER, REGIONAL MEDICAL OFFICER 
OR MEDICAL CLEARANCES THREE TO FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE 
END OF THE TOUR OF DUTY OR THE BEGINNING OF HOME LEAVE. 
EMPLOYEES TRANSFERRING FROM THE US TO OVERSEAS MUST 
CONCLUDE MEDICAL CLEARANCES FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR EFMS 
TO RECEIVE THEIR POST TRANSFER ORDERS. IT IS THE 
EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBILITY TO INITIATE AND CONCLUDE THE 
MEDICAL CLEARANCE PROCESS. 
 
LONG TERM TRAINING:  ASSIGNMENT VERSUS DETAIL 
13. EMPLOYEES BEING ASSIGNED TO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AND 
LESS THAN 365 DAYS OF TRAINING IN DC EN ROUTE TO ANOTHER 
OVERSEAS POST MAY CHOOSE WHETHER TO BE DETAILED OR BE 
ASSIGNED.  (TRAINING OF LESS THAN SIX MONTHS IS ALWAYS 
HANDLED AS A DETAIL AND PER DIEM PAID TO THE EMPLOYEE 
ONLY; TRAINING OF 12 MONTHS OR MORE IS ALWAYS HANDLED AS 
AN ASSIGNMENT ALLOWING SHIPMENT OF EFFECTS AND NO PER DIEM 
IS PAID.)  IF THE EMPLOYEE ELECTS TO BE DETAILED, THE 
EMPLOYEE (NOT EFMS) RECEIVES PER DIEM FOR THE LENGTH OF 
THE TRAINING.  THE TRAINING MAY NOT BE EXTENDED PAST 365 
DAYS WITH PER DIEM OR THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE TAXED BY IRS ON 
ALL PER DIEM PAID THROUGHOUT THE TRAINING.  IF THE 
EMPLOYEE ELECTS TO BE ASSIGNED, S/HE DOES NOT GET PER DIEM 
BUT HHE AND POV ARE SHIPPED AND DELIVERED AND HOME SERVICE 
TRANSFER ALLOWANCES ARE PAID. 
 
PER DIEM QUESTIONS FOR EMPOYEES RETURNING TO WASHINGTON ON 
DETAIL 
14.  WASHINGTON PER DIEM IS DIVIDED IN TWO PARTS:  LODGING 
(RECEIPTS REQUIRED) AND MEALS AND INCIDENTALS (M&IE  A 
FIXED AMOUNT).  AFTER 30 DAYS, PER DIEM IS PAYABLE TO THE 
EMPLOYEE ON A REDUCING SCALE: 
FOR THE FIRST 30 DAYS, 100 PERCENT OF APPLICABLE RATE 
FOR THE NEXT 90 DAYS, 50 PERCENT 
AFTER 120 DAYS (NOT TO EXCEED 365), 25 PERCENT. 
WHEN EFMS ARE AUTHORIZED PER DIEM (ONLY DURING 
CONSULTATIONS AND SELECTED SEMINARS), THE EFM PER DIEM 
RATE IS BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES RATE.  ANY EFM UNDER AGE 
12 GETS 50 PERCENT OF THE EMPLOYEES RATE HOWEVER, 
EMPLOYEES ARE AGAIN CAUTIONED THAT LONG-TERM TRAINING 
GENERALLY DOES NOT INCLUDE TDY AUTHORIZATION FOR FAMILY 
MEMBERS (SEE PARA 13 ABOVE). 
 
15. RATES DIFFER IN DC, ARLINGTON, DUNN LORING, AND 
WARRENTON, STATES MOST COMMON TRAINING LOCATIONS.  PLEASE 
CONTACT TRANSPORTATION OR YOUR PERSONNEL TECHNICIAN FOR 
THE MOST CURRENT RATES 
 
16. EMPLOYEES RETURNING FROM AN OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT TO AN 
ASSIGNMENT IN WASHINGTON MAY APPLY FOR THE HOME SERVICE 
TRANSFER ALLOWANCE (HSTA).  THIS IS AVAILABLE IF THE 
EMPLOYEE IS NOT PLANNING TO SEPARATE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. 
THE ALLOWANCE IS INTENDED TO COVER TEMPORARY QUARTERS 
EXPENSES UNTIL PERMANENT HOUSING IS SECURED.  SUBSISTENCE 
EXPENSES CAN BE INCURRED PRIOR TO REPORTING FOR DUTY WHILE 
IN A LEAVE STATUS, BUT ONLY AT THE NEW DUTY STATION. 
HOWEVER A CLAIM CANNOT BE MADE UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY 
REPORTS FOR DUTY.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE RATES FOR HSTA ARE 
CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE LOCALITY RATES FOR THE 
WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN AREA. 
 
PER DIEM QUESTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES LEAVING WASHINGTON 
17. EMPLOYEES ARE ENTITLED TO UP TO TEN CALENDAR DAYS OF 
SUBSISTENCE IN TEMPORARY QUARTERS UPON DEPARTURE FROM A 
U.S. ASSIGNMENT TO AN OVERSEAS ASSIGNMENT. 
 
BACKGROUND CHECKS 
18. HR/CDA OFTEN FINDS THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE NOT RETURNED DS 
BACKGROUND UPDATE QUESTIONNAIRES IN A TIMELY FASHION.  A 
NUMBER OF POSTS REQUIRE SPECIALIZED DS CLEARANCES WHICH 
CANNOT BE OBTAINED IF THE BACKGROUND CHECK IS NOT UP TO 
DATE.  LACK OF AN UP TO DATE BACKGROUND CHECK CAN MEAN A 
DELAY OF MANY MONTHS IN PANELING AND ASSIGNING AN 
EMPLOYEE. 
 
SHIPPING ISSUES 
19. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU REVIEW THE BOOKLET ITS YOUR 
MOVE WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE DEPARTMENTS INTRANET 
UNDER THE BUREAU OF ADMININSTRATION, OFFICE OF LOGISTICS 
MANAGEMENT.  CDROM VERSIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN MAILED TO ALL 
POSTS. 
 
YOUR ID AND DIP PASSPORT 
20. NOW WOULD BE A GOOD TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR STATE 
DEPARTMENT ID AND THE FAMILYS DIPLOMATIC PASSPORTS TO SEE 
IF ANY NEED RENEWAL.  CHECK WITH YOUR HUMAN RESOURCES 
OFFICE FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO APPLY FOR NEW PASSPORTS 
AND IDS. 
21.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT: UPDATE TO ICASS BASIC PACKAGE SERVICES COST 
CENTER 
 
1. SUMMARY: THE IWG AND ISC ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO 
INCORPORATE NEW POLICIES AND GUIDANCE INTO THE ICASS 
HANDBOOK.  SINCE THE LAST UPDATING OF THE HANDBOOK IN 
APRIL OF 1998 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY LESSONS LEARNED LEADING 
TO CHANGES AND ADDITIONS TO ICASS POLICIES.  THIS IS THE 
FIRST IN A SERIES OF CABLES HIGHLIGHTING UPDATES TO 6 FAH- 
5 - THE ICASS HANDBOOK. AS WE UPDATE EACH SECTION WE WILL 
BE SENDING OUT A CABLE EXPLAINING THE CHANGES, WHILE AT 
THE SAME TIME INCORPORATING THE CHANGES INTO THE FAH.  THE 
GOAL IS TO COMPLETE UPDATING THE HANDBOOK BY NEXT SPRING. 
 
2. THE \"DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING PATTERN AND POSITION 
SCHEDULES\" IS TO NO LONGER BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

POSITION SCHEDULES\" IS PRESENTLY ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE 
PERSONNEL SERVICES COST CENTER. WITH INPUT FROM THE POSTS 
THE IWG HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS ACTIVITY FITS BETTER

BENEFIT FROM THIS SERVICE BY VIRTUE OF BEING IN COUNTRY. 
 
4. PLEASE DELETE THE WORDS \"DEVELOPMENT OF STAFFING 
PATTERN AND POSITION SCHEDULES\" FROM 6-FAH-5 H-405.1-10.

TAGS: AOMS, AMGT, APER 
SUBJECT: OMS CONFERENCE MARCH 21-23, 2001 
 
FOR OFFICE MANAGEMENT SPECIALISTS AND POST MANAGEMENT FROM 
THE OMS COORDINATOR - DONNA MMOH 
 
1. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE A WORLDWIDE OMS CONFERENCE TO 
BE HELD MARCH 21-23, 2001 AT NFATC, CO-SPONSORED BY THE 
REGIONAL BUREAUS, THE BUREAU OF HUMAN RESOURCES AND NFATC. 
 
2. PAST OMS CONFERENCES HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, 
COMBINING AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES AMPLE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING, GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND SHARING 
OF IDEAS AS WELL AS FORMAL PRESENTATIONS TO HELP OMSERS 
FULFILL THEIR CHANGING ROLES AS OFFICE MANAGEMENT 
SPECIALISTS. THANKS TO THE BUREAUS\' OVERWHELMING AND 
CONTINUING SUPPORT, MORE THAN SEVENTY OMSERS HAVE BEEN 
PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THESE CONFERENCES, AND 
MUCH HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AS A RESULT OF THEIR DIRECT 
PARTICIPATION. 
 
3. THE THEME OF THIS YEAR\'S CONFERENCE WILL BE CONTINUING 
A DIALOGUE AMONG OMSERS, COLLEAGUES AND THEIR SUPERVISORS 
 
THAT WILL INCLUDE WORKSHOPS TO EXCHANGE IDEAS ON 
HARNESSING NEW AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE NEEDS 
OF A MISSION. THE CONFERENCE WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY 
FOR OFFICE MANAGEMENT SPECIALISTS TO BRING COMMON CONCERNS 
TO THE TABLE AND SHARE SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN 
THE FIELD. THEY WILL ALSO ATTEND WORKSHOPS THAT WOULD 
ENHANCE OFFICE MANAGEMENT SKILLS. WE PROPOSE TO SET UP A 
DAY OF TRAINING ON DATABASE AND SPREADSHEET MANAGEMENT AND 
DEVELOP IDEAS ON HOW THESE APPLICATIONS CAN BE APPLIED IN

1.  BID DEADLINE:  THE WINTER 2000-2001 AND SUMMER 2001 
CABLES HAVE BEEN COMBINED.  THIS CABLE PRESENTS THE OPEN 
ASSIGNMENTS VACANCY LIST FOR OFFICE MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST 
POSITIONS FROM WHICH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES SHOULD CREATE 
THEIR BID LISTS FOR THE 2001 SUMMER CYCLE.  BIDDERS WITH A 
NOVEMBER 2001 TED MAY ALSO BID ON SUMMER CYCLE POSITIONS. 
THIS LIST IS UPDATED BIWEEKLY. 
 
2.  OPAP REVIEW:  AS PART OF THE OVERSEAS PRESENCE 
ADVISORY PANEL (OPAP) RIGHT-SIZING MEASURES, ALL FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS AGENCIES LOCATED IN EMBASSIES PARIS, MEXICO CITY, 
TBLISI, NEW DELHI, BANGKOK, AND AMMAN ARE REVIEWING THEIR 
STAFFING LEVELS AND NEEDS.  FOR CURRENT INFORMATION ON 
POSITIONS AT THESE POSTS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALL 
INTERESTED BIDDERS CONTACT THE PERSONNEL OFFICERS IN THE 
APPROPRIATE BUREAU\'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR THE LATEST 
INFORMATION. 
 
3.  CORE BIDS:  UNASSIGNED OFFICE MANAGEMENT SPECIALISTS 
SHOULD SUBMIT AND MAINTAIN AT LEAST SIX CORE BIDS 
(AT-GRADE AND IN-CONE OR INTERFUNCTIONAL) ON POSITIONS IN 
THEIR RESPECTIVE CYCLE.  CORE BIDS MUST BE IN AT LEAST TWO 
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH NO MORE THAN THREE CORE BIDS IN ONE 
GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  BIDDERS MAY SUBMIT AND MAINTAIN A 
MAXIMUM OF 15 BIDS.  FAIR SHARE CANDIDATES MUST SUBMIT AT 
LEAST TWO APPROPRIATE OVERSEAS HARDSHIP BIDS TO MEET THE 
REQUIREMENT.  EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN SPECIALITIES MAY HAVE A 
MORE LIMITED POOL OF POSITIONS AVAILABLE FOR BIDDING. IF 
THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT POSITIONS AT GRADE TO SATISFY 
CORE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS, PLEASE DISCUSS WITH YOUR CDO. 
OUT-YEAR BIDS COUPLED WITH LANGUAGE TRAINING WILL COUNT 
TOWARDS THE NECESSARY CORE BIDS. ALL OFFICE MANAGEMENT 
SPECIALISTS WITH TEDS THROUGH OCTOBER, 2001 SHOULD MONITOR 
THEIR LISTS AND SUBMIT ADDITIONAL BIDS, AS NEEDED.  SLUG 
CABLES FOR THE APPROPRIATE HR/CDA OFFICE (ENTER CORRECT 
SYMBOL) PLUS THE CDO\'S NAME. FAILURE TO FOLLOW BIDDING 
PROCEDURES MAY JEOPARDIZE OR DELAY CONSIDERATION OF 
ASSIGNMENT PREFERENCES.  DETAILED INFORMATION ON CORE BID 
AND FAIR SHARE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE BIDDING 
INSTRUCTIONS BOOKLETS SENT TO EACH 2001 TRANSFEREE, ALSO 
AVAILABLE ON THE INTRANET AT HTTP://HRWEB.HR.STATE.GOV/. 
ONCE YOU HAVE FULFILLED YOUR CORE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS, 
YOU MAY BID ON OUT-OF-CONE (E.G., JO OR ADMIN SUBFUNCTION) 
POSITIONS OR ON POSITIONS NOT AT YOUR GRADE.  HOWEVER, 
PRIORITY WILL BE GIVEN TO FILLING OFFICE MANAGEMENT 
SPECIALIST VACANCIES BEFORE CONSIDERATION CAN BE GIVEN TO 
OUT-OF-FUNCTION BIDS.  SLUG CABLES FOR THE APPROPRIATE 
HR/CDA OFFICE (CDA/ML, CDA/EL) PLUS THE CDO\'S NAME. 
 
4.  URGENT VACANCY POLICY:  FOR ALL TENURED GENERALISTS 
AND SPECIALISTS WHO ARE NOT SUMMER CYCLE BIDDERS: THIS 
LIST MAY CONTAIN POSITIONS THAT MAY BE FILLED THROUGH 
PROCEDURES ANNOUNCED IN THE URGENT VACANCY CABLE (99 STATE 
162786).  BIDDERS FROM A FUTURE ASSIGNMENT CYCLE WILL NOT 
BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW CORE-BIDDING RULES.  THEY MAY SUBMIT 
BIDS ON ANY \"NOW\" VACANCY ON THE OPEN ASSIGNMENTS CABLE. 
LANGUAGE-DESIGNATED POSITIONS ADVERTISED AS NOW MAY BE BID 
AS \"URGENT VACANCIES\" IF THE START DATE OF THE LANGUAGE 
TRAINING HAS PASSED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE 
POSITION.  HOWEVER, THESE BIDDERS MUST HAVE CONCURRENCE 
FOR CURTAILMENT FROM THE LOSING POST AND BUREAU.  THIS 
PROCEDURE IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE VOLUNTEER CABLE 
PROCESS AND DIFFERS FROM THE VOLUNTEER CABLE IN THAT ALL 
PARTIES MUST AGREE TO THE REASSIGNMENT AND THAT POSITIONS 
AT NONDIFFERENTIAL POSTS AS WELL AS DOMESTIC POSITIONS MAY 
BE CONSIDERED.  BIDDERS SHOULD RESPOND IN THE PRESCRIBED 
BIDDING FORMAT SLUGGED TO THEIR CDO AND TO THE ASSIGNMENTS 
OFFICER, INDICATING EXPLICITLY THAT THEIR CURRENT POST AND 
BUREAU CONCUR WITH THE CURTAILMENT AND SPECIFYING THEIR 
AVAILABILITY DATE FOR THE POSITION(S) LISTED.  BIDS MUST 
FOLLOW THE REGULAR BID FORMAT: 
POST/ORG/POSITION/POSITION NUMBER/INCUMBENT/TED.

VACANCIES MAY THROUGH OCTOBER, 2001 AS WELL AS 2002 AND 
2003 VACANCIES REQUIRING HARD-LANGUAGE TRAINING. 
EMPLOYEES COMPETENT IN A HARD LANGUAGE WHO HAVE SUMMER 
2002 AND 2003 TEDS SHOULD INFORM THEIR CDOS NOW IF THEY 
ARE INTERESTED IN THESE POSITIONS. ALL LANGUAGE-DESIGNATED 
POSITIONS ON THIS CABLE ARE 2/2 UNLESS OTHERWISE 
INDICATED.  SEVERAL POSITIONS, MOSTLY IN THE FORMER SOVIET 
UNION, REQUIRE EITHER OF TWO LANGUAGES AND ARE SO 
INDICATED IN THE VACANCY LISTS.  THE PREFERRED LANGUAGE 
APPEARS FIRST. 
 
6. OUT-YEAR WORLD LANGUAGE PROGRAM: THIS PROGRAM - 
CONTINUED FROM LAST CYCLE\'S SUCCESSFUL PILOT -- IS 
DESIGNED TO ALLOW MID LEVEL GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS 
WITH SUMMER 2001 TEDS TO BID ON LANGUAGE DESIGNATED 
POSITIONS OPENING IN SUMMER 2002.  THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED 
TO ALLOW AMPLE TIME FOR LANGUAGE TRAINING IN FRENCH, 
SPANISH OR PORTUGUESE.  THESE POSITIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO 
SUMMER 2001 BIDDERS AND ARE LISTED THROUGHOUT THE CABLE IN 
THE APPROPRIATE SECTION BY GRADE AND CONE.  THESE 
POSITIONS ARE MARKED WITH AN \"O\".  YOU MAY INCLUDE BIDS ON 
ANY OF THESE POSITIONS ALONG WITH THE REST OF YOUR 2000 
BID LIST.  A SEPARATE ALDAC WILL EXPLAIN THE PROGRAM IN 
DETAIL. 
 
7.  STRETCH BIDS FOR MSI RECIPIENTS:  IN ORDER TO DEVELOP 
TALENT WITHIN THE FOREIGN SERVICE AND AS A RESULT OF THE 
STG MCKINSEY REPORT ON THE WAR FOR TALENT (99 STATE 
126590), A PILOT PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE SUMMER 
2000 BIDDING CYCLE AND WILL BE CONTINUED THIS YEAR.  THIS 
PROGRAM (99 STATE 193655) PERMITS ANY ELIGIBLE BIDDER WHO 
WAS AWARDED A MSI BY THE 2000 PROMOTION PANELS TO BID ON 
POSITIONS AT THE NEXT HIGHER LEVEL AS AN AT-GRADE BIDDER 
AND TO INCLUDE THESE POSITIONS AS CORE BIDS.  THIS PROGRAM 
PERMITS MSI RECIPIENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BID STRETCH JOBS 
THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COMPETE FOR. 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY BIDDER WILL RECEIVE A 
STRETCH ASSIGNMENT. 
 
8.  POST INFORMATION:  EMPLOYEES SEEKING INFORMATION ON 
SPECIFIC POSTS SHOULD REFER TO THE BIDDING TOOL PROVIDED 
TO POST ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS AND BUREAU EXECUTIVE 
OFFICES. THE BIDDING TOOL IS AVAILABLE ON THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT INTRANET AT HTTP://HRWEB.HR.STATE.GOV/. 
EMPLOYEES INTERESTED IN FAMILY MEMBER EMPLOYMENT SHOULD 
CONSULT CLO COORDINATORS AT POST FOR THE MOST RECENT 
REPORT, ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE INTRANET AT 
HTTPS://HRWEB.FLO.FAMER/HTML. 
 
9.  COMMUNICATIONS BACK UP:  POSITIONS THAT INCLUDE THE 
DUAL FUNCTION OF OFFICE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS ARE 
NOTED UNDER THE POSITION DESCRIPTION COLUMN.  WHEN THE 
DESIGNATION IS REFLECTED AS \"CP,\" THE INFORMATION 
MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS THAT OF BACKUP INFORMATION 
MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST (TWO WEEKS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT 
TRAINING YW231 AND YW232); WHERE THE OFFICE MANAGER HAS 
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AT POST, 
THE DESIGNATION IS \"CP PRIN.\"  A SPECIAL FIVE-DAY BACKUP 
FAST ALTERNATE COMMUNICATIONS TERMINAL (ACT) COURSE (YW 
231) IS REQUIRED FOR THESE POSITIONS. 
 
10. CHIEF OF MISSION OM BIDS:  TENURED OFFICE MANAGERS MAY 
BID ON OFFICE MANAGER POSITIONS FOR AMBASSADORS WITHOUT 
REGARD TO THEIR TED.  FOREIGN SERVICE EXPERIENCE AND 
LANGUAGE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS; THEREFORE, BIDS FROM 
UNTENURED OFFICE MANAGEMENT SPECIALISTS WILL NOT BE 
CONSIDERED.  OFFICE MANAGERS SELECTED FOR THESE POSITIONS 
WILL BE EXPECTED TO TRANSFER TO THE POSITION AT A TIME 
AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE OFFICE MANAGER AND AMBASSADOR. 
 
11.  TANDEM BIDS:  IF YOU ARE PART OF A TANDEM COUPLE, 
PLEASE COORDINATE YOUR CHOICES CAREFULLY WITH YOUR SPOUSE 
AND LET YOUR CDO IN HR/CDA KNOW WHICH EMPLOYEE\'S 
ASSIGNMENT WILL TAKE THE LEAD.  IF YOUR TANDEM SPOUSE IS 
AN EMPLOYEE OF ANOTHER FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENCY, YOU SHOULD 
PROVIDE THE NAME AND TELEPHONE NUMBER OF HIS/HER CAREER 
COUNSELOR.  IF YOUR SPOUSE IS A CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEE, 
PLEASE PROVIDE HIS/HER NAME, GRADE, CURRENT JOB TITLE, AND 
LET YOUR CDO KNOW IF YOUR SPOUSE IS ALSO SEEKING 
EMPLOYMENT AT POST.  ALSO, PLEASE KEEP THE TANDEM 
COORDINATOR, MEG KEETON, ADVISED.  YOU MAY REACH HER AT 
(202) 647-0586 OR BY FAX AT (202) 736-4075.  IF FOR SOME

THE FS ACT OF 1980). 
 
REF: A) 99 STATE 162786; B) 99 STATE 126590; C) 99 STATE 
193655 
 
1.  BID DEADLINE:  THE WINTER 2000-2001 AND SUMMER 2001 
CYCLE HAVE BEEN COMBINED.  THIS CABLE PRESENTS THE OPEN 
ASSIGNMENTS VACANCY LIST FOR SENIOR LEVEL POSITIONS FROM 
WHICH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES SHOULD CREATE THEIR BID LISTS FOR 
THE 2001 SUMMER CYCLE.  BIDDERS WITH A NOVEMBER 2001 TED 
MAY ALSO BID ON SUMMER CYCLE POSITIONS.  THIS LIST IS 
UPDATED BIWEEKLY. NOTE: IF THEY BECOME AVAILABLE THIS 
CABLE WILL INCLUDE FACULTY ADVISOR POSITIONS AT DEPARTMENT 
OF DEFENSE SCHOOLS AND DIPLOMAT IN RESIDENCE POSITIONS. 
 
2.  OPAP REVIEW:  AS PART OF THE OVERSEAS PRESENCE 
ADVISORY PANEL (OPAP) RIGHT-SIZING MEASURES, ALL FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS AGENCIES LOCATED IN EMBASSIES PARIS, MEXICO CITY, 
TBLISI, NEW DELHI, BANGKOK, AND AMMAN ARE REVIEWING THEIR 
STAFFING LEVELS AND NEEDS.  FOR CURRENT INFORMATION ON 
POSITIONS AT THESE POSTS, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ALL 
INTERESTED BIDDERS CONTACT THE PERSONNEL OFFICERS IN THE 
APPROPRIATE BUREAU\'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE FOR THE LATEST 
INFORMATION. 
 
3.  CORE BIDS:  UNASSIGNED SENIOR LEVEL GENERALISTS AND 
SPECIALISTS SHOULD SUBMIT AND MAINTAIN AT LEAST SIX CORE 
BIDS (AT-GRADE AND IN-CONE OR INTERFUNCTIONAL) ON 
POSITIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CYCLE. CORE BIDS MUST BE IN 
AT LEAST TWO GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITH NO MORE THAN THREE CORE 
BIDS IN ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. BIDDERS MAY SUBMIT AND 
MAINTAIN A MAXIMUM OF 15 BIDS.  FAIR SHARE CANDIDATES MUST 
SUBMIT AT LEAST TWO APPROPRIATE OVERSEAS HARDSHIP BIDS TO 
MEET THE REQUIREMENT.  EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN SPECIALITIES 
MAY HAVE A MORE LIMITED POOL OF POSITIONS AVAILABLE FOR 
BIDDING. IF THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT POSITIONS AT GRADE TO 
SATISFY CORE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS, PLEASE DISCUSS WITH 
YOUR CDO. OUT-YEAR BIDS COUPLED WITH LANGUAGE TRAINING 
WILL COUNT TOWARDS THE NECESSARY CORE BIDS. ALL SENIOR 
LEVEL GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS WITH TEDS THROUGH 
OCTOBER, 2001 SHOULD MONITOR THEIR LISTS AND SUBMIT 
ADDITIONAL BIDS, AS NEEDED.  SLUG CABLES FOR THE 
APPROPRIATE HR/CDA OFFICE (ENTER CORRECT SYMBOL) PLUS THE 
CDO\'S NAME.  FAILURE TO FOLLOW BIDDING PROCEDURES MAY 
JEOPARDIZE OR DELAY CONSIDERATION OF ASSIGNMENT 
PREFERENCES.  DETAILED INFORMATION ON CORE BID AND FAIR 
SHARE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THE BIDDING INSTRUCTIONS 
BOOKLETS SENT TO EACH 2001 TRANSFEREE, ALSO AVAILABLE ON 
THE INTRANET AT HTTP://HRWEB.HR.STATE.GOV/. 
 
4.  URGENT VACANCY POLICY:  FOR ALL TENURED GENERALISTS 
AND SPECIALISTS WHO ARE NOT SUMMER CYCLE BIDDERS: THIS 
LIST MAY CONTAIN POSITIONS THAT MAY BE FILLED THROUGH 
PROCEDURES ANNOUNCED IN THE URGENT VACANCY CABLE (99 STATE 
162786).  BIDDERS FROM A FUTURE ASSIGNMENT CYCLE WILL NOT 
BE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW CORE-BIDDING RULES.  THEY MAY SUBMIT 
BIDS ON ANY \"NOW\" VACANCY ON THE OPEN ASSIGNMENTS CABLE. 
LANGUAGE-DESIGNATED POSITIONS ADVERTISED AS NOW MAY BE BID 
AS \"URGENT VACANCIES\" IF THE START DATE OF THE LANGUAGE 
TRAINING HAS PASSED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO THE 
POSITION.  HOWEVER, THESE BIDDERS MUST HAVE CONCURRENCE 
FOR CURTAILMENT FROM THE LOSING POST AND BUREAU.  THIS 
PROCEDURE IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE VOLUNTEER CABLE 
PROCESS AND DIFFERS FROM THE VOLUNTEER CABLE IN THAT ALL 
PARTIES MUST AGREE TO THE REASSIGNMENT AND THAT POSITIONS 
AT NONDIFFERENTIAL POSTS AS WELL AS DOMESTIC POSITIONS MAY 
BE CONSIDERED.  BIDDERS SHOULD RESPOND IN THE PRESCRIBED 
BIDDING FORMAT SLUGGED TO THEIR CDO AND TO THE ASSIGNMENTS 
OFFICER, INDICATING EXPLICITLY THAT THEIR CURRENT POST AND 
BUREAU CONCUR WITH THE CURTAILMENT AND SPECIFYING THEIR 
AVAILABILITY DATE FOR THE POSITION(S) LISTED.  BIDS MUST 
FOLLOW THE REGULAR BID FORMAT: 
POST/ORG/POSITION/POSITION NUMBER/INCUMBENT/TED. 
 
5.  HARD LANGUAGE BIDS:  THIS LIST INCLUDES ALL UNASSIGNED 
VACANCIES MAY THROUGH OCTOBER, 2001 AS WELL AS 2002 AND 
2003 VACANCIES REQUIRING HARD-LANGUAGE TRAINING. 
EMPLOYEES COMPETENT IN A HARD LANGUAGE WHO HAVE SUMMER 
2002 AND 2003 TEDS SHOULD INFORM THEIR CDOS NOW IF THEY 
ARE INTERESTED IN THESE POSITIONS.  ALL 
LANGUAGE-DESIGNATED POSITIONS ON THIS CABLE ARE 3/3 UNLESS 
OTHERWISE INDICATED.  SEVERAL POSITIONS, MOSTLY IN THE 
FORMER SOVIET UNION, REQUIRE EITHER OF TWO LANGUAGES AND 
ARE SO INDICATED IN THE VACANCY LISTS.  THE PREFERRED 
LANGUAGE APPEARS FIRST. 
 
6.  STRETCH BIDS FOR MSI RECIPIENTS:  IN ORDER TO DEVELOP 
TALENT WITHIN THE FOREIGN SERVICE AND AS A RESULT OF THE 
STG MCKINSEY REPORT ON THE WAR FOR TALENT (99 STATE 
126590), A PILOT PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE SUMMER 
2000 BIDDING CYCLE AND WILL BE CONTINUED THIS YEAR.  THIS 
PROGRAM (99 STATE 193655) PERMITS ANY ELIGIBLE BIDDER WHO 
WAS AWARDED A MSI BY THE 2000 PROMOTION PANELS TO BID ON 
POSITIONS AT THE NEXT HIGHER LEVEL AS AN AT-GRADE BIDDER 
AND TO INCLUDE THESE POSITIONS AS CORE BIDS.  THIS PROGRAM 
PERMITS MSI RECIPIENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BID STRETCH JOBS 
THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO COMPETE FOR. 
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY BIDDER WILL RECEIVE A 
STRETCH ASSIGNMENT. 
 

7.  POST INFORMATION:  EMPLOYEES SEEKING INFORMATION ON 
SPECIFIC POSTS SHOULD REFER TO THE BIDDING TOOL PROVIDED 
TO POST ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS AND BUREAU EXECUTIVE 
OFFICES. THE BIDDING TOOL IS AVAILABLE ON THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT INTRANET AT HTTP://HRWEB.HR.STATE.GOV/. 
EMPLOYEES INTERESTED IN FAMILY MEMBER EMPLOYMENT SHOULD 
CONSULT CLO COORDINATORS AT POST FOR THE MOST RECENT 
REPORT, ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE INTRANET AT 
HTTP://HRWEB.FLO.FAMER/HTML. 
 
8.  DCM/SEP BIDS:  THE DCM POSITIONS AT SPECIAL EMBASSY 
PROGRAM EMBASSIES (IDENTIFIED AS DCM/SEP) OFFER 
EXTRAORDINARY MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES AND QUALIFY INCUMBENTS 
FOR THE MULTIFUNCTIONAL SKILL CODE.  OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO 
THESE POSITIONS MUST ALSO EXPECT TO PERFORM MORE BASIC 
REPORTING AND/OR ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS THAN WOULD DCMS AT 
LARGER EMBASSIES. 
 
9.  TANDEM BIDS:  IF YOU ARE PART OF A TANDEM COUPLE, 
PLEASE COORDINATE YOUR CHOICES CAREFULLY WITH YOUR SPOUSE 
AND LET YOUR CDO IN HR/CDA KNOW WHICH EMPLOYEE\'S 
ASSIGNMENT WILL TAKE THE LEAD.  IF YOUR TANDEM SPOUSE IS

COUNSELOR.  IF YOUR SPOUSE IS A CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEE, 
PLEASE PROVIDE HIS/HER NAME, GRADE, CURRENT JOB TITLE, AND 
LET YOUR CDO KNOW IF YOUR SPOUSE IS ALSO SEEKING

COORDINATOR, MEG KEETON, ADVISED.  YOU MAY REACH HER AT 
(202) 647-0586 OR BY FAX AT (202) 736-4075.  IF FOR SOME

MILITARY SHIPS/AIRCRAFT 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY PM A/S ERIC D. NEWSOM. REASON 1.5 
(B/D). THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE THAT HAS BEEN CLEARED BY 
M/P FOR SEP POSTS.  PLEASE SEE PARA FOUR BELOW. 
 
2.  (S) INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE THAT TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON U.S. INTERESTS, 
MAY INCREASE DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADAN. POSSIBLE TARGETS 
COULD INCLUDE U.S. NAVY SHIPS EITHER INPORT OR TRANSITING 
RESTRICTIVE CHOKE POINTS, AND USG AIRCRAFT. 
 
3.  (S) ALTHOUGH MILITARY COMMANDERS HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE 
HEIGHTENED THREAT CONDITIONS IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD, 
WE MUST ALSO COORDINATE WITH THE HOST NATIONS THAT OUR 
SHIPS AND PLANES VISIT OR TRANSIT TO ENSURE THEIR 
GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO AWARE OF THE HEIGHTENED THREAT 
SITUATION AND TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO INCREASE SECURITY 
TO ASSIST IN THE PROTECTION OF U.S. FORCES.  THE VAST 
MAJORITY OF THE SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY FOR VISITING SHIPS 
AND AIRCRAFT RESTS WITH HOST NATIONS. 
 
4.  (S) ACTION REQUEST: POSTS SHOULD COORDINATE WITH 
APPROPRIATE HOST NATION OFFICIALS AND EXPLAIN OUR CONCERNS 
ABOUT THE INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF TERRORIST ATTACKS 
DURING RAMADAN AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, TO REQUEST ENHANCED 
SECURITY PROTECTION AND, AT THE SAME TIME, TO UNDERSCORE 
OUR CONCERN THAT ENHANCED SECURITY MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE 
FORESEABLE FUTURE.  DEPARTMENT REQUESTS POSTS IN COUNTRIES 
WHICH EITHER ARE OR COULD BE PORTS OF CALL FOR U.S. SHIPS 
OR AIRCRAFT BOTH TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL SECURITY PROTECTION 
AND TO ASSESS AND REPORT ON THE ADDITIONAL SECURITY 
EFFORTS THAT HOST NATIONS HAVE PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE 
HEIGHTENED THREAT.

SUBJECT: OFFICE OF CITIZEN EXCHANGES GRANT TO THE AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS 
 
1.  ACTION SUMMARY:  THIS TELEGRAM HAS BEEN CLEARED WITH 
M/PP (SEP).  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE#S OFFICE OF CITIZEN 
EXCHANGES IS PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE A GRANT AWARD TO THE 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS (AAM) FOR THE INTERNATIONAL 
PARTNERSHIPS AMONG MUSEUMS (IPAM) PROGRAM.  THE GOAL OF 
THIS PROGRAM IS TO ESTABLISH MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL, 
SUSTAINABLE LINKAGES BETWEEN MUSEUMS IN THE U.S. AND 
 
ABROAD.  THIS 2001-2003 GRANT WILL PROVIDE FOR 20 LINKAGES, 
AND AAM WILL RAISE PRIVATE FUNDING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 7 
LINKAGES TO BE DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY AMONG PARTICIPATING 
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.  PUBLIC AFFAIRS SECTIONS WILL BE ASKED TO 
ASSIS IN COORDINATING THESE LINKAGES AS WELL.  IPAM 
PROVIDES A UNIQUE INTERCULTURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR MUSEUMS IN 
THE U.S. AND THEIR COUNTERPART INSTITUTIONS OVERSEAS TO 
ESTABLISH LASTING TIES BY CONDUCTING JOINT OR COMPLEMENTARY 
PROJECTS AND EXCHANGING MID-LEVEL STAFF MEMBERS FOR 
RESIDENCIES OF AT LEAST 31 DAYS AT EACH PARTNER MUSEUM. 
INTERESTED POSTS ARE ASKED TO CABLE THEIR INTENTION TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE IPAM COMPETITION BY C.O.B. JANUARY 8, 
2001.  FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING THE AAM/IPAM PROGRAM 
WILL BE SENT ONLY TO POSTS INDICATING THEIR INTENTION TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.  END OF SUMMARY. 
 
2.    IN PREVIOUS CYCLES OF THIS PROGRAM, PARTICIPATING 
INSTITUTIONS HAVE GAINED: (A) AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE 
INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHILE ENHANCING THE MUSEUM#S 
ABILITY TO ENRICH ITS OWN COMMUNITY; (B) INCREASED SHARING 
OF INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL AND FUNDING RESOURCES AMONG 
MUSEUMS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES; (C) ACCESS TO VARIED OBJECT 
COLLECTIONS, MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND CURATORIAL 
TECHNIQUES; (D) THE IMPETUS AND TIME TO INVOLVE ALL STAFF 
MEMBERS IN CREATING A PROJECT OF INTEREST TO BOTH 
INSTITUTIONS. 
 
3.    MUSEUMS OF ANY SIZE AND DISCIPLINE, IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND ABROAD, ARE ELIGIBLE TO TAKE PART IN THIS 
PROGRAM (SEE PARAGRAPH 7 BELOW).  PARTICIPATING STAFF 
MEMBERS MAY COME FROM ANY FIELD OF PROFESSIONAL 
SPECIALIZATION.  COOPERATIVE PROJECTS MAY FOCUS ON A WIDE 
RANGE OF TOPICS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COLLECTION 
STEWARDSHIP, EDUCATION/INTERPRETATION, CULTURAL TOURISM, 
MARKETING, AND EXHIBIT DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN (PLEASE SEE 
PARAGRAPH 5 FOR APPLICATION DETAILS). 
 
4.    IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE SUBSTANTIAL, DIRECT LINKAGES 
BETWEEN U.S. MUSEUMS AND THEIR OVERSEAS PARTNERS, THE 
EXCHANGE WILL REQUIRE INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT IN ADDITION 
 
TO INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT INVOLVEMENT.  U.S. AND NON-U.S. 
MUSEUMS WILL DESIGN AND AGREE UPON A JOINT OR COMPLEMENTARY 
PROJECT DURING THE APPLICATION PHASE. 
 
5.    POSTS IN COUNTRIES WTH WHICH THE USG HAS A BILATERAL 
CULTURAL PROPERTY AGREEMENT MAY FIND THAT IPAM IS AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER THOSE AGREEMENTS UNDER ARTICLE II, 
WHICH CONCERNS LONG-TERM STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING THE 
CULTURAL PATRIMONY.  MUSEUMS ARE INTEGRAL TO SUCH 
STRATEGIES, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO ADVANCING CULTURAL, 
EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGES.  CURRENTLY THERE ARE 
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH CANADA, PERU, GUATEMALA, EL 
SALVADOR, NICARAGUA, AND MALI.  ALTHOUGH CAMBODIA AND 
CYPRUS HAVE EMERGENCY CULTURAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AT THE 
MOMENT, THEY SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS PROGRAM AS 
CULTURAL PROPERTY AGREEMENTS ARE PENDING.  SUCH AGREEMENTS 
ARE ALSO PENDING WITH ITALY AND BOLIVIA.  FOR GUIDANCE ON 
THIS PLEASE CONTACT THE CULTURAL PROPERTY STAFF (ECA/P/C) 
AT 619-6612; ALSO CONSULT THE CULTURAL PROPERTY WEBSITE: 
HTTP://EXCHANGES.STATE.GOV/EDUCATION/CULPROP FOR COPIES OF 
 
AGREEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION.

AAM WEB SITE WHICH WILL CONTAIN ALL APPLICATION AND IPAM

STAFF, APPLICANTS WILL PROCEED TO PHASE TWO OF THE 
COMPETITION. 
 
6B.    AS IPAM HAS GROWN IN SIZE AND POPULARITY, AAM HAS 
BEEN CONTACTED BY INTERESTED INSTITUTIONS ABROAD AS WELL AS 
BY U.S. MUSEUMS INTERESTED IN FORMING PARTNERSHIPS WITH

WAS AWARDED A MSI BY THE 2000 PROMOTION PANELS TO BID ON 
POSITIONS AT THE NEXT HIGHER LEVEL AS AN AT-GRADE BIDDER 
AND TO INCLUDE THESE POSITIONS AS CORE BIDS. THIS PROGRAM

SUBJECT: CIPRIS PROGRAM UPDATE: INS WILL COLLECT F/M/J FEE 
BEGINNING IN 2001 
 
REF: 97 STATE 57291 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
1. IN REFTEL, THE DEPARTMENT REPORTED ON INS\' CIPRIS 
PROJECT, A CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED PROGRAM FOR 
ELECTRONICALLY MONITORING STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS 
IN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH CIPRIS HAS HAD A SLOW START SINCE 
ITS 1995 CONCEPTION, INS HAS PLANS TO LAUNCH A BETA TEST 
OF THE PROGRAM IN MID-2001 AND TO HAVE CIPRIS FULLY 
IMPLEMENTED BY 2005. LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE 
PRESIDENT IN LATE OCTOBER HAS GIVEN INS THE GREEN LIGHT TO 
COLLECT A FEE FROM NEW STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS, TO 
BEGIN AS SOON AS INS PUTS INTO PLACE ITS FEE COLLECTION 
SYSTEM AND REGULATIONS. THE MECHANICS OF COLLECTING THE 
FEE HAVE YET TO BE FINALIZED. HOWEVER, CONSULAR OFFICERS 
WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE PROCESS BY REQUIRING PROOF 
THAT STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR APPLICANTS HAVE PAID THE 
 
FEE BEFORE ISSUING A VISA. INS IS UNCERTAIN WHEN IT WILL 
BEGIN COLLECTING THE FEE, BUT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES 
POSTS WILL NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY ACTION BEFORE THE SPRING. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
WHAT IS CIPRIS? 
--------------- 
 
2. THE COORDINATED INTERAGENCY PARTNERSHIP REGULATING 
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS (CIPRIS) GREW OUT OF AN INS TASK 
FORCE ESTABLISHED IN 1995 TO REVIEW HOW TO GATHER 
INFORMATION FOR MONITORING F, M AND J VISA HOLDERS IN THE 
U.S. THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TASK FORCE TO CREATE AN 
ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEM FOR FOREIGN STUDENTS AND 
EXCHANGE VISITORS WAS FORMALIZED IN SECTION 641 OF THE 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REFORM AND IMMIGRANT RESPONSIBILITY 
ACT OF 1996 (IIRIRA). THIS SECTION REQUIRES ALL POST- 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE 
INFORMATION ON NATIONALS OF ALL COUNTRIES BY JANUARY 1, 
2003. THE TRACKING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE SELF-FUNDED 
WITH FEES COLLECTED FROM FOREIGN STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE 
VISITORS. INS LAUNCHED A CIPRIS PILOT PROJECT AT 21 
SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTHEAST U.S. IN 1997 TO TEST THE 
FEASIBILITY OF AN ELECTRONIC TRACKING SYSTEM, WITH A VIEW 
TO EXPANDING THE PROGRAM NATIONWIDE BY THE 
CONGRESSIONALLY-ESTABLISHED DEADLINE. 
 
3. WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED, CIPRIS WILL BE AN ALL- 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WHICH WILL GIVE INS AND CONSULAR 
OFFICERS IMMEDIATE INFORMATION ON AN F, M OR J HOLDER\'S 
STATUS. INITIALLY OVERSEAS POSTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE 
CIPRIS DATA BASE THROUGH INS DIRECT, ENABLING THEM TO 
VERIFY F, M OR J INFORMATION SUCH AS WHEN AN I-20 OR IAP- 
66 WAS ISSUED AND WHETHER THE STUDENT IS CURRENTLY IN 
FULL-TIME ATTENDANCE AT A SCHOOL. EVENTUALLY POSTS WILL 
HAVE DIRECT COMPUTER LINKAGE TO THE CIPRIS SYSTEM, GIVING 
CONSULAR OFFICERS IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO STUDENT AND EXCHANGE 
VISITOR DATA WHEN INTERVIEWING APPLICANTS AND ADJUDICATING 
CASES. ISSUANCE DATA WILL BE DOWNLOADED INTO THE SYSTEM 
AND MADE AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS AS WELL AS TO INS, CREATING 
A SEAMLESS FLOW OF INFORMATION WHICH SHOULD NEARLY 
ELIMINATE STUDENT VISA FRAUD AND SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE 
AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK CONSULAR OFFICERS REQUIRE TO 
ADJUDICATE A STUDENT OR EXCHANGE VISITOR VISA. 
 
THE BATTLE OVER FEES 
--------------------- 
 
4. ALTHOUGH THE IDEA OF A CIPRIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN POPULAR 
WITH CONGRESS, IT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED WELL BY MANY 
SCHOOLS AND PROGRAMS WHICH HOST INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND 
EXCHANGE VISITORS. THESE SCHOOLS HAVE BALKED AT SOME 
PROVISIONS OF SECTION 641, IN PARTICULAR THE REQUIREMENT 
IN THAT LEGISLATION THAT SCHOOLS COLLECT THE CIPRIS FEE. 
THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY\'S TOOTH-AND-NAIL OPPOSITION TO 
THIS PROVISION VIRTUALLY ENDED ALL CIPRIS-RELATED ACTIVITY 
FOR MUCH OF 2000. INS FINALLY OVERCAME THIS OPPOSITION BY 
INTRODUCING LEGISLATION WHICH TRANSFERRED THE FEE 
COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY FROM HOST SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE 
PROGRAMS TO INS. THIS LEGISLATION WAS ATTACHED TO HR 3767 
-- THE VISA WAIVER BILL -- AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE 
PRESIDENT ON OCTOBER 30, 2000. IN SPITE OF THIS FIX, 
CIPRIS STILL LIVES UNDER A SWORD OF DAMOCLES IN THE FORM 
OF A PROPOSED BILL WHICH WOULD REPEAL THE PROGRAM. THIS 
LEGISLATION, WHICH HAS THE BACKING OF MANY COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES, MAY BE INTRODUCED IN THE NEXT CONGRESS, 
ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES ITS PASSAGE IS UNLIKELY. 
 
5. INS MADE SEVERAL MAJOR CONCESSIONS ON THE FEE ISSUE, 
NOTABLY ON WHO QUALIFIES FOR REDUCED OR FEE-EXEMPT STATUS, 
TO ENSURE ITS SUCCESS. BUT THE FEE AMENDMENT HAS AT LAST 
GIVEN THE SERVICE THE FISCAL TOOL IT NEEDED TO GO FULL- 
STEAM ON CIPRIS IMPLEMENTATION. INS\' ABILITY TO COLLECT 
THE FEE IS VITAL TO THE PROGRAM\'S SUCCESS; CIPRIS IS 
EXPECTED TO BE SELF-FUNDING AND THE SERVICE NEEDS THE 
CIPRIS REVENUE TO TAKE THE PROGRAM BEYOND THE PLANNING 
STAGE. THE AMENDMENT ALLOWS INS TO COLLECT A $95 FEE FOR 
MOST STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS, AN AMOUNT INS 
CALCULATED WAS A PER-CAPITA MINIMUM TO PAY FOR THE 
PROGRAM. SOME FS, MS AND J\'S, NOTABLY THOSE ATTENDING 
SECONDARY SCHOOL, EXCHANGE VISITORS SPONSORED BY THE USG, 
AND F-2, J-2 AND M-2 APPLICANTS, WILL BE EXEMPT FROM THE 
FEE. OTHERS, SPECIFICALLY AU PAIRS, CAMP COUNSELORS AND 
SUMMER WORK/TRAVEL PARTICIPANTS, WILL PAY A REDUCED, $40 
FEE. 
 
6. BECAUSE OF THE LONG HIATUS IN CIPRIS DEVELOPMENT WHICH 
OCCURRED WHILE THE FEE COLLECTION BATTLE WAS BEING FOUGHT, 
INS WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET CONGRESS\' 
JANUARY 1, 2003 TIMETABLE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM UP AND 
RUNNING WORLDWIDE. HOWEVER, INS PLANS TO ESTABLISH A BETA 
TEST OF CIPRIS BY MID-2001, TO BE CONDUCTED IN A SELECT 
GROUP OF SCHOOLS AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS IN THE 
BOSTON AREA. FOLLOWING THIS BETA TEST, INS WILL GRADUALLY 
PHASE IN CIPRIS REGION-BY-REGION UNTIL ALL SCHOOLS AND 
 
EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS ARE COVERED, PROBABLY SOMETIME 
IN 2005. POSTS WILL BE TIED INTO THE CIPRIS SYSTEM AS OUR 
DATASHARE LINKS WITH INS ARE DEVELOPED. 
 
WHAT THE HR 3767 FEE AMENDMENT MEANS FOR POSTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
7. INS IS NOW HARD AT WORK DEVELOPING A SIMPLE, NO-FRILLS 
SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING THE F/M/J FEE, IN AN EFFORT TO GET 
CIPRIS FUNDS FLOWING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AMONG OTHER 
TASKS, INS\' CIPRIS TEAM IS DRAFTING FEDERAL REGISTER 
REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR FEE COLLECTION, AND IS 
DEVELOPING THE FORM (DESIGNATED AN \"\"-901\" BY INS) WHICH 
STUDENTS WILL SUBMIT TO THE \"LOCKBOX\" ALONG WITH THEIR FEE 
PAYMENT. INS HOPES TO HAVE BOTH OF THESE ITEMS COMPLETED 
BY EARLY 2001, AT WHICH TIME IT CAN BEGIN COLLECTING THE 
FEE FROM NEW STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS. ONCE 
IMPOSED, INS WILL COLLECT THE FEE FROM ALL NON-EXEMPT 
FIRST-TIME STUDENTS AND EXCHANGE VISITORS REGARDLESS OF 
WHETHER THEIR SCHOOL OR PROGRAM IS YET PARTICIPATING IN 
CIPRIS. 
 
8. AS INS HAS OUTLINED, STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR VISA 
APPLICANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE CIPRIS FEE AFTER 
THEY OBTAIN AN I-20 OR IAP-66, BUT BEFORE THEY APPLY FOR 
THE VISA. THE FEE IS NON-REFUNDABLE, EVEN IF THE APPLICANT 
FAILS TO OBTAIN A VISA. BANK ONE (A CHICAGO-BASED BANK) 
WILL BE THE LOCK-BOX FOR THE FEES. AFTER RECEIVING THE I- 
20 OR IAP-66, A PROSPECTIVE STUDENT OR EXCHANGE VISITOR 
WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT THE I-901 FORM AND PAYMENT TO BANK ONE 
(FORM AND PAYMENT INFORMATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ONLINE ON 
BOTH THE INS AND BANK ONE WEBSITES). THEY MAY PAY BY 
CREDIT CARD, BANK DRAFT, OR EVEN CASH. UPON RECEIPT OF 
THE I-901 AND PAYMENT, BANK ONE WILL ISSUE A RECEIPT, IN 
THE FORM OF INS\' FAMILIAR I-797 \"NOTICE OF ACTION.\" THIS 
FEE RECEIPT WILL BE MAILED TO THE APPLICANT AT THE ADDRESS 
DESIGNATED ON THE I-901. THE APPLICANT WILL PRESENT THE I- 
797 FEE RECEIPT, ALONG WITH THE I-20 OR IAP-66, AT THE 
TIME OF VISA APPLICATION. PRESUMABLY STUDENT AND EXCHANGE 
VISITOR APPLICANTS WHO DO NOT HAVE PROOF OF CIPRIS FEE 
PAYMENT IN THE FORM OF THE I-797 RECEIPT WILL BE REFUSED 
221(G). 
 
A WORK IN PROGRESS 
------------------ 
 
9. AT THIS POINT, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WITH ANY 
CERTAINTY WHEN INS WILL BEGIN COLLECTING THE CIPRIS FEE, 
ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE HOPES TO HAVE FEE COLLECTIONS UP AND 
 
RUNNING BY EARLY 2001. MANY ISSUES RELATING TO THE FEE 
PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS HAVE YET TO BE WORKED OUT. FOR 
EXAMPLE, INS AND BANK ONE ARE STILL DELIBERATING ON HOW 
BEST TO REPLACE LOST OR MISDIRECTED I-797 RECEIPTS. THE 
SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO WORK BEST FOR THOSE WITH INTERNET 
ACCESS, BUT FOR STUDENTS NOT CONNECTED TO THE WEB, PAYING 
THE FEE MAY BE MORE PROBLEMATICAL. AND EDUCATING THE 
INTERNATIONAL STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR COMMUNITY ABOUT 
THE NEW FEE WILL BE A MAJOR UNDERTAKING WHICH WILL FALL 
MOSTLY ON INS BUT WITH WHICH POSTS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS 
IN THE PROGRAM, MAY BE CALLED ON TO ASSIST. 
 
10. THE VISA OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH INS TO 
ENSURE THAT THE CIPRIS PROGRAM WILL HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT 
ON OUR POSTS ABROAD AND AT THE SAME TIME WILL SERVE OUR 
OWN LONG-TERM GOALS OF REDUCING WORKLOAD AND ELIMINATING 
FRAUD IN THE STUDENT AND EXCHANGE VISITOR PROGRAMS. WE ARE 
CONFIDENT THAT THE PROGRAM ULTIMATELY WILL ACHIEVE ALL 
THESE ENDS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH 
INS AS THE FEE COLLECTION SYSTEM, AND CIPRIS ITSELF, ARE 
CLOSER TO REALITY. WE WILL KEEP POSTS CLOSELY APPRISED OF 
ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO OUR 
ROLE IN FEE COLLECTIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS.

SUBJECT: PASSAGE OF VWP LEGISLATION: WHERE DO WE GO FROM 
HERE? 
 
REF: STATE 210639 
 
1. SUMMARY: THE PRESIDENT SIGNED LEGISLATION MAKING THE 
VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM PERMANENT. SEVERAL COUNTRIES 
HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BECOMING VWP PARTICIPANTS, AND 
SEVERAL POSTS HAVE OFFERED SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO THE 
PROGRAM. GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE PREPARATORY WORK AND 
COMPROMISE NEEDED TO OBTAIN A PERMANENT VISA WAIVER 
PROGRAM, THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT ENVISION REQUESTING ANY 
ADDITIONAL STATUTORY CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. THE DEPARTMENT INFORMED THE FIELD IN REFTEL THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD SIGNED HR 3767, THE VISA WAIVER PERMANENT 
PROGRAM ACT. THIS LEGISLATION MADE THE VISA WAIVER PILOT 
PROGRAM (VWPP) A PERMANENT PROGRAM, NOW KNOWN AS THE VISA 
WAIVER PROGRAM (VWP). THE PRESIDENT\'S SIGNATURE WAS THE 
CULMINATION OF A LONG PROCESS IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT, 
OTHER AGENCIES, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR STAFFS MADE 
 
KNOWN THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND WHAT CHANGES 
THEY WANTED IN THE STATUTE. 
 
----------------------------------- 
FURTHER CHANGES TO VWP LEGISLATION 
----------------------------------- 
 
3. AS POSTS WERE ABLE TO SURMISE BASED ON THE SEVERAL 
EXTENSIONS OF THE PAROLE PROCEDURE FOR NATIONALS OF WAIVER 
COUNTRIES AFTER VWPP AUTHORITY EXPIRED ON APRIL 30, 
PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO EXTEND OR MAKE PERMANENT THE 
VWPP WAS A CLIFFHANGER. THE FATE OF THE PROGRAM RISKED 
BEING LEFT FOR AN END-OF-SESSION OMNIBUS WHERE ANYTHING 
CAN HAPPEN. PASSAGE OF THE BILL REQUIRED A CONCERTED AND 
COORDINATED EFFORT BY SEVERAL OFFICES IN THE DEPARTMENT, 
PARTICULARLY IN THE BUREAU OF CONSULAR AFFAIRS, TO KEEP 
THE BILL MOVING, TO MINIMIZE UNWANTED AMENDMENTS, AND TO 
DEFLECT ATTEMPTS TO DERAIL OR MODIFY IT. 
 
4. AT THE OUTSET OF THE PROCESS, THE BUREAU OF CONSULAR 
AFFAIRS WORKED CLOSELY WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 
IMMIGRATION SUBCOMMITTEE, WHICH DRAFTED AND INTRODUCED THE 
BILL, TO TRY TO GET IMPORTANT PROVISIONS INTO THE VWP 
LEGISLATION, PARTICULARLY THOSE RAISED WITH US BY POSTS. 
WHILE STAFF MEMBERS WERE SYMPATHETIC TO MANY OF OUR 
REQUESTS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE WAS INUNDATED WITH SPECIAL 
INTEREST REQUESTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS. 
OUR INTERESTS, WHILE VIEWED SYMPATHETICALLY AND EVEN 
FAVORABLY, WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE CAUSES OF EVERY GROUP 
WITH ISSUES BEARING ON VWP. AS THE IMPORTANCE OF VWP 
BECAME INCREASINGLY APPARENT ON THE HILL, THE BILL TURNED 
INTO A \"CHRISTMAS TREE,\" USED TO HANG ALL KINDS OF SPECIAL 
INTEREST PROVISIONS, BOTH RELATED AND UNRELATED TO THE VWP 
ITSELF. THE ONLY WAY TO OBTAIN PASSAGE OF AN EXTENSION OF 
VWPP, LET ALONE A PERMANENT PROGRAM, WAS TO AVOID PRESSING 
FOR FURTHER VARIATIONS. VWPP WAS SUFFICIENTLY 
CONTROVERSIAL THAT ANY CHANGE OR ENHANCEMENT WAS HIGH RISK 
-- THE RISK BEING LOSS OF THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. 
 
5. POSTS MAY ALSO BE AWARE THAT GREECE\'S STATUS IN THE VWP 
WAS A SOURCE OF CONCERN FOR SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. THE 
DEPARTMENT WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO CONGRESS ALL OF THE 
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE NOMINATION OF GREECE. CONGRESS 
WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT ALL INTERESTED BUREAUS IN 
THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES HAD HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS FULLY ON THE NOMINATION OF GREECE. 
 
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WAS PROVIDED TO CONGRESS IN 
THREE SEPARATE TRANCHES. 
 
6. THE DEPARTMENT IS OVERJOYED FINALLY TO HAVE A PERMANENT 
VWP. NOW WE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE STATUTE, WHICH WILL 
CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A DELICATE BALANCING OF MANY DIFFERENT 
INTERESTS. THERE ARE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO 
CONGRESS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL REVIEW EVERY VWP COUNTRY\'S PARTICIPATION AT LEAST 
EVERY FIVE YEARS. REPORTS MUST ALSO BE MADE TO CONGRESS 
ABOUT THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR 
INCLUSION IN VWP. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ADDITIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR DATASHARE WITH THE IMMIGRATION AND 
NATURALIZATION SERVICE (INS) THROUGH THE USE OF 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. 
 
7. OUR SENSE IS THAT CONGRESS INTENDS VERY FIRMLY TO LIMIT 
THE VWP TO A SINGLE VISA CLASS WITH VERY STRICT 
REQUIREMENTS AND TO MONITOR THE PROGRAM VERY CLOSELY. 
GIVEN THIS IMPRESSION AND THE LACK OF APPARENT ENTHUSIASM 
TO REOPEN THIS ISSUE ON THE HILL BY THOSE WHO WOULD 
SUPPORT POSITIVE CHANGES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE 
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE TO SEEK FURTHER LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AT 
THIS TIME. 
 
--------------------- 
ADDING NEW COUNTRIES 
--------------------- 
 
8. SOME POSTS HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED INTEREST IN 
NOMINATING THEIR HOST COUNTRIES FOR VWP PARTICIPATION. 
WHILE THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONSIDER ANY NOMINATIONS THAT WE 
RECEIVE, WE MUST CAUTION POSTS NOT TO EXPECT A QUICK 
RESPONSE. THE DEPARTMENT MUST CONSULT WITH THE 
INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
OVERSEEING THE VWP TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW 
REQUIREMENTS OF HR 3767. WE EXPECT THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF 
THE NEW REQUIREMENTS, REVISIONS TO THE NIV SOFTWARE TO 
CAPTURE REFUSAL STATISTICS IN A DIFFERENT MANNER, REVIEW 
OF THE CONSULAR CONSOLIDATED DATABASE TO DETERMINE IF ITS 
OUTPUT MEETS OUR NEEDS, COORDINATION OF THE MANY NEW 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND CONSULTATION WITH INS ON 
DATASHARE WILL OCCUPY THE INTERAGENCY GROUP FOR SOME TIME. 
 
9. SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN 
ABOUT THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE VWP; I.E., EVEN THOUGH 
THE NATIONALITIES INVOLVED ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSE IN THEIR 
 
ETHNIC MAKEUP THAN EVER BEFORE, IT IS STILL THE CASE THAT 
22 OF THE 29 PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES ARE IN EUROPE. WE DO 
NOT FORESEE THE ADDITION OF NEW COUNTRIES TO THE VWP IN 
THE NEAR-TERM, SINCE WE DO NOT BELIEVE CONGRESS IS IN 
FAVOR OF EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM. 
 
10. POSTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO REPORT THE HOST COUNTRY 
NATIONAL (HCN) REFUSAL STATISTICS IF THEY BELIEVE THAT A 
COUNTRY IS CLOSE TO MEETING, OR MEETS, THE REFUSAL RATE 
CRITERION (NO MORE THAN A 3% REFUSAL RATE FOR HCNS 
APPLYING FOR B VISAS, EXCLUDING 221(G) REFUSALS). THIS IS 
REPORT 11E ON THE NIV SYSTEM. POSTS SHOULD SEND THE 
REPORTS EVERY QUARTER VIA A CABLE SLUGGED FOR CA/VO/F/I. 
 
11. WE GENERALLY DO NOT RELEASE EXACT REFUSAL RATES. 
SHOULD HOST GOVERNMENTS APPROACH POSTS WITH A REQUEST TO 
PROVIDE THE \"VWP REFUSAL RATE\", WE RECOMMEND AGAINST 
PROVIDING THE EXACT RATE. INSTEAD, POSTS SHOULD RESPOND 
THAT REFUSAL RATES ARE MAINTAINED FOR INTERNAL DEPARTMENT 
USE ONLY, AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL ADVISE THE HOST 
COUNTRY (VIA POST) WHEN THE REFUSAL RATE AND OTHER INITIAL 
CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR NOMINATION PURPOSES. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
INTERAGENCY NOMINATION AND APPROVAL PROCESS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
12. THE VWP NOMINATION PROCESS IS BASED ON A 1997 PROTOCOL 
ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE AND JUSTICE. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS) INITIATES THE PROCESS BY 
ADVISING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) OF ITS INTENT TO 
NOMINATE A COUNTRY FOR CONSIDERATION FOR INCLUSION IN THE 
VWP. ONCE DOS HAS ADVISED DOJ OF ITS INTENT TO NOMINATE A 
COUNTRY, AN INTERAGENCY TEAM REVIEWS THE NOMINATION, 
FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT INCLUSION OF THE COUNTRY IN VWP 
WOULD HAVE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND 
IMMIGRATION CONTROL. IF NO CLEARLY DISQUALIFYING 
OBJECTIONS ARE RAISED DURING THIS PRENOMINATION REVIEW, 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SUBMITS A FORMAL WRITTEN NOMINATION 
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
 
13. AFTER A COUNTRY IS FORMALLY NOMINATED, INS LEADS A 
SITE TEAM OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM INTERESTED AGENCIES TO 
VISIT THE NOMINATED COUNTRY TO REVIEW PASSPORT AND 
DOCUMENT SECURITY, BORDER AND IMMIGRATION CONTROLS, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS, AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT, IMMIGRATION, AND 
 
NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS. BASED ON THE PRENOMINATION 
REVIEW AND SITE VISIT, THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP 
SUBMITS A RECOMMENDATION TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN WHOM 
THE LAW VESTS ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO APPROVE VWP 
PARTICIPATION.

SUBJECT: OPEN ASSIGNMENTS - OUT-YEAR WORLD LANGUAGE 
PROGRAM FOR SUMMER 2001 BIDDERS 
 
 
FOR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS: THIS TELEGRAM SHOULD BE 
BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL FULL-TIME STATE 
EMPLOYEES. 
 
REF:  (A) STATE 153213  (B) STATE 168766  (C) STATE 189670 
 
1. THIS CABLE UPDATES THE LIST OF POSITIONS INCLUDED 
IN THE OUT YEAR WORLD LANGUAGE PILOT PROGRAM. SOME 
POSITIONS WERE DELETED DUE TO EXTENSIONS, CURTAILMENTS 
OR ASSIGNMENTS MADE. OTHER POSITIONS WERE SUBSTITUTED 
WHERE POSSIBLE. 
 
2. PLEASE REFER TO REFTEL A WHICH PROVIDES COMPLETE 
INFORMATION ON THE PROGRAM. THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE 
MID-CAREER GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS TRANSFERRING IN 
SUMMER 2001 AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN A WORLD LANGUAGE 
WITH SUFFICIENT TIME BUILT IN FOR THE LANGUAGE TRAINING. 
IF ASSIGNED TO A 2002 WORLD LANGUAGE POSITION, EMPLOYEE 
WOULD LEAVE CURRENT POST ON SCHEDULE IN 2001 AT THE END 
OF THE TOUR OF DUTY. AFTER HOME LEAVE AND A BRIDGE 
ASSIGNMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT, THE EMPLOYEE WOULD START 
LANGUAGE TRAINING IN EARLY 2002, WITH A TIMELY 
SUMMER 2002 ARRIVAL AT THE NEW POST. 
 
3. THIS CABLE INCLUDES FOUR OPERATIONS OFFICER POSITIONS 
IN THE NUCLEAR RISK REDUCTION CENTER (VC/NRRC). AN 
OFFICER SELECTED FOR THESE ONE-YEAR DOMESTIC POSITIONS CAN 
CHOOSE TO STUDY FRENCH, GERMAN, SPANISH OR ITALIAN. 
OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO THE NRRC ALSO EARN SHIFT 
DIFFERENTIAL. 
 
4. FOR 2002 TRANSFEREES: AS WITH OUT-YEAR HARD LANGUAGE 
POSITIONS, BIDS WILL BE CONSIDERED FROM CANDIDATES WITH 
A SUMMER 2002 TED WHO ALREADY HAVE THE LANGUAGE 
PROFICIENCY REQUIRED FOR THE POSITION. IF YOU ARE 
INTERESTED, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR CDO. 
 
5. EXTENSION OF INCUMBENTS: BECAUSE WE HOPE TO MAKE 
ASSIGNMENTS TO THESE 2002 POSITIONS BY EARLY 2001, 
THE USUAL MAY 15, 2001 DEADLINE FOR DECIDING WHETHER 
TO EXTEND IS TOO LATE. WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 2001 BIDDERS, CURRENT INCUMBENTS 
SHOULD NOT BE DISADVANTAGED. EMPLOYEES MUST FORMALLY 
REQUEST AN EXTENSION -- PREFERABLY IMMEDIATELY - BUT 
NOT LATER THAN NOVEMBER 1, 2000 WITH POST AND BUREAU 
CONCURRENCE. BUREAUS CAN SUBSTITUTE AN EQUIVALENT 
LANGUAGE-DESIGNATED MID-LEVEL POSITION FROM THE SAME 
POST OR ANOTHER 15% OR HIGHER DIFFERENTIAL POST IF THE 
INCUMBENT IN ANY GIVEN POSITION EXTENDS. 
 
6. INCLUDE ANY OF THESE POSITIONS AS SUPPLEMENTAL 
2001 BIDS. THESE POSITIONS ARE ALSO INCORPORATED 
INTO THE VARIOUS 2001 OPEN ASSIGNMENTS CABLES, 
IDENTIFIED WITH THE DESIGNATION \"OUT YEAR WORLD 
LANGUAGE\" FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

SUBJECT: REFUGEE PROCESSING:  EMBASSY REFERRALS 
 
REF: STATE 215078 
 
1.  THIS MESSAGE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY M/P (SEP). 
 
2.  SUMMARY. THIS CABLE REMINDS POSTS THAT THEY ARE 
AUTHORIZED TO IDENTIFY AND REFER APPLICANTS FOR POSSIBLE 
REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. IT ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE 
ON WHICH REFUGEES MIGHT BE CONSIDERED FOR REFERRAL TO THE 
ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  INDIVIDUALS OF ANY REPEAT ANY NATIONALITY MAY BE 
PROCESSED AS PRIORITY ONE EMBASSY REFERRALS, WITH FEW 
EXCEPTIONS, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO WASHINGTON. THOSE FEW 
EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE PALESTINIANS, NORTH KOREANS, AND 
LIBYANS, FOR WHOM THE BUREAU OF POPULATION, REFUGEES, AND 
MIGRATION (PRM) AND THE OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT 
INS HQ WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO AUTHORIZE PROCESSING IN 
ADVANCE. IN ADDITION, POSTS WITH IN-COUNTRY PROGRAMS 
(FORMER SOVIET UNION, VIETNAM, CUBA) MUST SEEK PRM 
GUIDANCE BEFORE REFERRING NATIONALS OF THE HOST COUNTRY. 
 
4.  PRIORITY ONE IS DEFINED AS: 
 
A)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES WHO ARE 
FACING COMPELLING SECURITY CONCERNS IN COUNTRIES OF FIRST 
ASYLUM, IN NEED OF LEGAL PROTECTION BECAUSE OF DANGERS OF 
REFOULEMENT, OR WHO ARE IN DANGER DUE TO THREATS OF ARMED 
ATTACK IN AREAS WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED, AND FORMER 
POLITICAL PRISONERS. 
 
B)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES, 
INCLUDING REFUGEE WOMEN-AT-RISK, VICTIMS OF TORTURE OR 
VIOLENCE, PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY DISABLED AND PERSONS IN 
URGENT NEED OF MEDICAL TREATMENT NOT AVAILABLE IN THE 
COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM. 
 
C)  UNHCR-REFERRED OR EMBASSY-IDENTIFIED REFUGEES, FOR 
WHOM OTHER DURABLE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT FEASIBLE AND WHOSE 
STATUS IN THE PLACE OF ASYLUM DOES NOT PRESENT A 
SATISFACTORY LONG-TERM SOLUTION. 
 
5.  A REFUGEE IS DEFINED UNDER U.S. LAW, INA SEC 
101(A)(42), AS A PERSON WHO IS OUTSIDE HIS/HER COUNTRY OF 
ORIGIN AND IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO RETURN DUE TO 
PERSECUTION OR A WELL-FOUNDED FEAR OF PERSECUTION ON 
ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A 
PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP OR POLITICAL OPINION.  IN 
ADDITION, A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN FORCED TO ABORT A 
PREGNANCY OR TO UNDERGO INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION, OR WHO 
HAS BEEN PERSECUTED FOR FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO UNDERGO SUCH 
A PROCEDURE OR FOR OTHER RESISTANCE TO A COERCIVE 
POPULATION CONTROL PROGRAM SHALL BE DEEMED TO MEET THIS 
DEFINITION.  PERSONS WHO ORDERED, INCITED, ASSISTED OR 
OTHERWISE PARTICIPATED IN THE PERSECUTION OF ANY OTHER 
PERSONS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SAME FIVE GROUNDS ARE EXCLUDED 
FROM THE DEFINITION. 
 
6.  WHILE INS HAS THE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITY TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A 
REFUGEE, EMBASSY-REFERRED CASES SHOULD BE CAREFULLY 
SCREENED TO ENSURE THAT THE PERSON HAS A PRIMA FACIE 
REFUGEE CLAIM. A P-1 REFERRAL PROVIDES A POTENTIAL REFUGEE 
APPLICANT ACCESS TO U.S. RESETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION BUT 
DOES NOT GUARANTEE HIS OR HER ACCEPTANCE. 
 
7.  THE DEPARTMENT WISHES TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE 
ACCESS TO THE U.S. REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROGRAM WORLDWIDE 
FOR DESERVING REFUGEES IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY 
RESETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF NATIONALITY OR FAMILY TIES TO 
THE UNITED STATES. WHILE WE DO NOT WANT TO OVERBURDEN 
EMBASSIES, WE HOPE EMBASSY STAFF INDIVIDUALLY RECOMMEND 
THOSE REFUGEES WHO ARE KNOWN TO THEM AND MAY BE AT RISK IN 
THE COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM OR OF BEING RETURNED TO A 
COUNTRY WHERE THEY WOULD FACE PERSECUTION. 
 
8.  IN MOST INSTANCES, PRIORITY ONE CASES WILL COME TO THE 
ATTENTION OF THE U.S. PROGRAM THROUGH REFERRALS FROM 
UNHCR. PRM HAS BEEN WORKING WITH UNHCR GENEVA AND MANY OF 
ITS FIELD OFFICES TO IMPROVE THE TRAINING UNHCR STAFF 
RECEIVE IN THE AREA OF IDENTIFYING CASES IN NEED OF THIRD 
COUNTRY RESETTLEMENT. POSTS SHOULD REFER TO CURRENT 
REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROCESSING GUIDELINES (STATE 215078) 
FOR GUIDANCE IN HANDLING UNHCR REFERRALS. 
 
9.  EMBASSIES, AS WELL AS UNHCR, ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED UNDER 
PRIORITY ONE TO REFER CASES FOR REFUGEE ADMISSIONS 
PROCESSING. SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED REGARDING WHAT 
EXACTLY IS INTENDED BY \"EMBASSY-REFERRED\" CASES. THE 
FOLLOWING IS INTENDED AS GUIDANCE TO POSTS ON THIS ISSUE. 
 
10.  CASES MOST LIKELY TO BE REFERRED FOR PROCESSING BY AN 
EMBASSY WOULD INVOLVE FORMER FSNS OR HIGH PROFILE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY, HAVE FLED THEIR 
HOME COUNTRIES, ARE UNABLE TO RETURN HOME DUE TO FEAR OF 
PERSECUTION, AND DUE TO SECURITY OR OTHER SERIOUS ISSUES 
IN THE COUNTRY OF ASYLUM MAY BE IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY 
RESETTLEMENT. AN EMBASSY MAY CHOOSE TO CONSULT WITH THE 
DEPARTMENT, OTHER INVOLVED POSTS (SUCH AS IN THE COUNTRY 
OF ORIGIN) OR UNHCR. ANY SUCH COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE 
HANDLED WITH UTMOST DISCRETION. VIOLATING THE 
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL\'S STATEMENTS AND/OR 
 
SIPDIS 
IDENTITY COULD COMPROMISE THE INDIVIDUAL\'S SAFETY AND THAT 
OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN THE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. THE CASE MAY 
ULTIMATELY BE DETERMINED BY UNHCR FOR A LOCAL SOLUTION OR 
REFERRAL TO THE U.S. OR OTHER COUNTRY FOR THIRD COUNTRY 
RESETTLEMENT. 
 
11.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT AN NGO WORKING IN THE 
REFUGEE\'S COUNTRY OF ASYLUM MAY RAISE A DESERVING CASE 
WITH AN EMBASSY. WHILE THE NORMAL PROCEDURE WOULD BE TO 
REFER THE CASE TO UNHCR OR THE HOST COUNTRY IF THE 
INDIVIDUAL REFUGEE IS NOT KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY, THERE MAY 
BE SITUATIONS WHERE A UNHCR OFFICE IS UNABLE TO ADDRESS 
ADEQUATELY AN INDIVIDUAL CASE. SHOULD THE NGO BE 
UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE NECESSARY ATTENTION FROM 
UNHCR, POSTS ARE FREE TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT TO REFER 
THE CASE AS AN EMBASSY-REFERRAL TO THE U.S. REFUGEE 
ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. ALL POSTS SHOULD DESIGNATE AN OFFICER 
OR ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR VETTING POTENTIAL 
EMBASSY REFERRALS. 
 
 
12.  WHILE THE SOLUTION FOR MOST REFUGEES IS TO REMAIN IN 
THE COUNTRY OF FIRST ASYLUM UNTIL REPATRIATION IS POSSIBLE, 
EMBASSIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONSULT WITH UNHCR SHOULD THEY 
HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF REFUGEE 
POPULATIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF U.S. REFUGEE 
ADMISSIONS PROCESSING FOR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS. IT IS NOT, 
HOWEVER, ANTICIPATED THAT POSTS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO 
UTILIZE THEIR RESOURCES TO SCREEN SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF 
PERSONS WHO WISH TO BE CONSIDERED FOR U.S. RESETTLEMENT. 
UNHCR OR PRM-FUNDED VOLUNTARY AGENCY STAFF INVOLVED IN 
REFUGEE PROCESSING ALREADY DO THIS AND ARE IN THE BEST 
POSITION TO DEAL WITH HIGH-VOLUME CASELOADS. IN MOST 
CASES, EMBASSY REFERRALS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY OR IN WHOM THE 
U.S. HAS A SPECIAL HUMANITARIAN CONCERN AND WHOM THE 
EMBASSY BELIEVES HAVE VALID REASONS TO FEAR PERSECUTION ON 
ACCOUNT OF RACE, RELIGION, NATIONALITY, MEMBERSHIP IN A 
PARTICULAR SOCIAL GROUP OR POLITICAL OPINION. 
 
13.  PROCEDURES FOR REFERRAL: TO REFER A CASE TO THE U.S. 
REFUGEE PROGRAM, AN EMBASSY SHOULD SEND A CLASSIFIED CABLE 
TO THE OVERSEAS INS OFFICE WITH JURISDICTION FOR THAT 
POST, THE REGIONAL REFUGEE COORDINATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ADMISSIONS (BANGKOK, CAIRO, MOSCOW, NAIROBI, AND 
ISLAMABAD), THE DEPARTMENT SLUGGED FOR PRM/A, INS 
HEADQUARTERS SLUGGED FOR HQIAO, AND THE U.S. EMBASSY IN 
THE REFUGEE APPLICANT\'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. (APPROPRIATE 
COUNTRY, PREF, AND CVIS TAGS SHOULD BE USED.) THE CABLE 
SHOULD INCLUDE BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
PRINCIPAL APPLICANT AND ANY DEPENDENTS (INCLUDING THEIR 
CURRENT WHEREABOUTS), A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE INDIVIDUAL\'S 
PERSECUTION STORY, AND AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THE CASE 
HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE IN NEED OF THIRD COUNTRY 
RESETTLEMENT. REFCOORD AND INS WILL THEN CONTACT THE POST 
ABOUT THE PROCESSING MODALITIES. 
 
14.  EMBASSIES SHOULD CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT PRM/A AND THE 
EMBASSY IN THE REFUGEE\'S COUNTRY OF ORIGIN (IF APPLICABLE) 
AND REFCOORDS NAIROBI AND CAIRO FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA IF 
THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER A PARTICULAR CASE 
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY ONE EMBASSY REFERRAL. 
 
15.  MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

TAGS: EPET, ENRG, PREL, IZ 
SUBJECT: TALKING POINTS ON IRAQI SUSPENSION OF OIL EXPORTS 
 
 
1.  BACKGROUND: ON DECEMBER 1, IRAQ SUSPENDED OIL EXPORTS 
WHICH FUND THE UN OPERATED OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM.  IT DID SO 
EVEN THOUGH THE SECURITY COUNCIL AGREED TO ALLOW SHIPMENTS 
TO CONTINUE UNTIL UN OFFICIALS COULD CONCLUDE A PRICING 
MECHANISM THAT REFLECTS A FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR IRAQ\'S 
DECEMBER EXPORTS.  AT PRESENT, IT APPEARS THAT THE MARKET 
HAS DISCOUNTED IRAQ\'S MOVE. THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL FOR 
JANUARY DELIVERY FELL $1.80 DECEMBER 1 AND CLOSED AT $32.02 
A BARREL. 
 
2.  OVER THE PAST YEAR, POSTS HAVE ENGAGED HOST COUNTRIES 
ON A VIGOROUS DIALOGUE CONCERNING THE OIL MARKETS. WE 
BELIEVE THAT THIS LATEST IRAQI PROVOCATION COULD IMPACT 
LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, AND EMERGING ECONOMIES IN A 
NEGATIVE MANNER IF REDUCED OIL SUPPLIES LEAD TO LARGE PRICE 
INCREASES OR SIGNIFICANT MARKET INSTABILITY. WE ARE WORKING 
WITH MAJOR OIL PRODUCERS AND WITHIN THE INTERNATIONAL 
ENERGY AGENCY TO MITIGATE THE OIL MARKET IMPACT. POSTS MAY 
DRAW ON FOLLOWING TALKERS, WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS OR IN 
PUBLIC, AS APPROPRIATE: 
 
Q: IRAQ HAS MADE GOOD ON ITS THREAT TO CUT OIL SHIPMENTS. 
IS THE U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT ON GLOBAL MARKETS? 
 
A: IRAQ\'S SUSPENSION OF OIL EXPORTS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COERCE 
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.  IRAQ SUBMITTED PROPOSED OIL 
PRICES TO THE UN FOR DECEMBER THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER 
THAN WORLD MARKET PRICES.  THE UN PANEL OF OIL EXPERTS - 
THE INTERNATIONAL OVERSEERS - RECOMMENDED AGAINST APPROVING 
THOSE PRICES.  THE UN\'S IRAQ SANCTIONS COMMITTEE 
UNANIMOUSLY AGREED.  WE CANNOT ACCEPT IRAQ\'S USE OF OIL AS 
A POLITICAL TOOL. 
 
THE UNITED STATES IS WORKING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY 
AGENCY MEMBERS AND MAJOR OIL PRODUCERS, ON AN OIL SUPPLY 
RESPONSE WHICH, IF NEEDED, WOULD COMPENSATE FOR THE OIL 
VOLUMES WHICH IRAQ IS THREATENING TO WITHDRAW FROM THE 
WORLD MARKET.  THIS RESPONSE WOULD INCLUDE DRAWDOWNS FROM 
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM STOCKS AS APPROPRIATE. 
 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE IEA ARE READY TO TAKE ACTION TO 
ADD SUPPLY VERY QUICKLY IF THE SITUATION WARRANTS. 
 
IRAQ SHOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT A CESSATION OF OIL EXPORTS 
WILL GAIN IT ANY LEVERAGE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS.  WE CALL 
ON IRAQ TO WORK WITH THE UNITED NATIONS TO QUICKLY REACH AN 
AGREEMENT ON THE OIL PRICING ISSUE. 
 
Q: WHY HASN\'T THE UN APPROVED A NEW PRICING STRUCTURE FOR 
DECEMBER?  WHAT\'S THE U.S. VIEW ON THIS? 
 
A: IRAQ SUBMITTED PROPOSED PRICES TO THE UN FOR DECEMBER 
THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WORLD MARKET PRICES.  THE 
UN PANEL OF EXPERTS - THE INTERNATIONAL OVERSEERS - 
RECOMMENDED AGAINST APPROVING THOSE PRICES.  THE UN\'S IRAQ 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AGREED.  WE SUPPORT THIS 
JUDGEMENT.  IRAQ\'S PROPOSED PRICING MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO 
MEET THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND WOULD 
CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED PAYMENTS OUTSIDE 
THE OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM. 
 
WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED CONSISTENT WITH 
THE INTENT OF UN RESOLUTIONS, WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO MEET 
THE HUMANITARIAN NEEDS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE. 
 
3. MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT: FDA PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW APPROVAL FOR USE OF 
ANTIMICROBIAL FLOUROQUINOLONE IN POULTRY 
 
1.  SUMMARY:   ON OCTOBER 26, 2000, THE FOOD AND DRUG 
ADMINISTRATION\'S CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE PROPOSED 
WITHDRAWING ITS PREVIOUS APPROVAL FOR FLUOROQUINOLONES USED 
THERAPEUTICALLY IN POULTRY.  THE FOLLOWING IS PROVIDED TO 
ASSIST POSTS IN RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES FROM LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND PRESS.  AS NEEDED, POSTS MAY DRAW 
ON TALKING POINTS PROVIDED IN PARA 12.  THIS IS NOT AN 
ACTION REQUEST.  FDA\'S PROPOSAL AND RISK ASSESSMENT ARE 
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET, AS INDICATED BELOW.  IF HOST 
GOVERNMENT CONTACTS ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION, THE FDA CONTACT PERSON IS: LINDA TOLLEFSON, 
FDA/CVM, (301) 827-6647 OR LTOLLEFS@CVM.FDA.GOV.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
2.  THE FLUORQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIAL DRUGS ARE USED IN 
FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS TO TREAT, PREVENT AND CONTROL 
DISEASE.  IN THE UNITED STATES, REGULATORY TERMINOLOGY 
NAMES THESE PRODUCTS \"NEW ANIMAL DRUGS.\"  (NOTE: WHILE USED 
DIFFERENTLY BY SCIENTISTS, ANTIBIOTIC AND ANTIMICROBIAL ARE 
USED INTERCHANGEABLY IN THIS DOCUMENT AND MEAN A PRODUCT 
THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO INHIBIT BACTERIA.)  BEFORE ANY NEW 
ANIMAL DRUG CAN BE APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 
DRUG\'S SPONSOR MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THE PRODUCT IS SAFE 
AND EFFECTIVE FOR ITS INTENDED USE.  IF THE ANTIMICROBIAL 
DRUG IS INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD PRODUCING ANIMALS, THE 
DRUG SPONSOR MUST DEMONSTRATE SAFETY FOR CONSUMERS OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        STATE   229699  041926Z 
EDIBLE ANIMAL PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SAFETY FOR USE IN THE 
ANIMAL. 
 
3.  THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) FIRST CALLED FOR 
SEVERAL RESTRICTIONS ON ANTIMICROBIAL USE IN FEED IN 1977. 
IN RECENT YEARS, CONCERNS ABOUT THE USE OF ANTIMICROBIAL 
PRODUCTS IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS HAVE FOCUSED ON HUMAN 
FOOD SAFETY, BECAUSE FOODS OF ANIMAL ORIGIN ARE IDENTIFIED 
AS VEHICLES OF FOODBORNE DISEASE IN HUMANS. 
 
4.  SINCE 1988, FDA\'S CENTER FOR VETERINARY MEDICINE (CVM) 
HAS APPROVED NEW THERAPEUTIC ANTIMICROBIALS AS 
PRESCRIPTION-ONLY PRODUCTS FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING 
ANIMALS. THIS PRESCRIPTION-ONLY POLICY IS BASED ON THE NEED 
TO ASSURE THE PROPER USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS THROUGH PRECISE 
DIAGNOSIS AND CORRECT TREATMENT OF DISEASE TO MINIMIZE 
ANIMAL SUFFERING AND TO AVOID DRUG RESIDUES IN FOOD. 
ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS FOR USE IN ANIMALS MUST MEET FDA\'S 
STANDARDS FOR SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND QUALITY TO BE APPROVED 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
5.  IN THE 1990S, SEVERAL SCIENTISTS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT 
THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS IN FOOD- 
PRODUCING ANIMALS. THE SCIENTISTS SAID THE USE COULD LEAD 
TO ENTERIC DISEASE IN HUMANS ASSOCIATED WITH 
FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT FOODBORNE PATHOGENS. ADDING TO 
THAT CONCERN WERE REPORTS OF A TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN 
THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN 
POULTRY IN EUROPE AND THE EMERGENCE OF A FLUOROQUINOLONE- 
RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER FROM HUMANS.

6.  FLUOROQUINOLONES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST 
VALUABLE ANTIMICROBIAL DRUG CLASSES AVAILABLE TO TREAT 
HUMAN INFECTIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY, 
SAFETY, AND EASE OF ADMINISTRATION.  THIS CLASS OF DRUGS IS 
EFFECTIVE AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF HUMAN DISEASES AND IS 
USED BOTH IN TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF BACTERIAL 
INFECTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN HOSPITALS. 
FLUOROQUINOLONES ARE USED ROUTINELY BY PHYSICIANS FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF FOODBORNE DISEASE.  THESE DISEASES HAVE A 
MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 
7.  TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS 
REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE USE IN 
FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS, AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE 1987 
FDA REPORT (WHICH CONCLUDED THAT THERAPEUTIC ANTIMICROBIALS 
USED FOR SHORT DURATION WERE SAFE) WAS STILL VALID, FDA 
HELD A JOINT ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING IN 1994 THAT 
INCLUDED THE CVM VETERINARY MEDICINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
(VMAC) AND THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH\'S 
ANTI-INFECTIVE DRUGS ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  THE JOINT 
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED THAT FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR POULTRY BE 
APPROVED, BUT THAT USE OF THE DRUGS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 
PRESCRIPTION ONLY, THAT NO EXTRA-LABEL USE SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED, AND THAT RESISTANCE SHOULD BE MONITORED AFTER THE 
PRODUCT WAS APPROVED.  APPROVAL OF BAYTRIL (TRADE NAME OF 
ONE PRODUCT) WAS LIMITED TO THERAPEUTIC USE, PRESCRIPTION 
ONLY, AND NO EXTRA-LABEL USE WAS ALLOWED. 
 
8.  FDA\'S CVM CREATED A FLUOROQUINOLONE WORKING GROUP TO 
ADDRESS THE POINTS RAISED BY THE JOINT COMMITTEE. THE 
WORKING GROUP OFFERED SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS, ALL OF WHICH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 05        STATE   229699  041926Z 
WERE ACCEPTED BY CVM, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE USE OF 
FLUOROQUINOLONES WAS APPROVED FOR POULTRY IN 1995 AND 1996. 
AS SUGGESTED IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS, THE SPONSORS AGREED TO 
PROVIDE BASELINE SUSCEPTIBILITY INFORMATION AND TO CONDUCT 
CONTINUING MONITORING OF TARGET ANIMAL PATHOGENS THROUGH 
THE POST-APPROVAL MONITORING PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, RESISTANCE 
DEVELOPED TO THE FLUOROQUINOLONES IN CAMPYLOBACTER, A MAJOR 
FOODBORNE PATHOGEN IN HUMANS.  IN NOVEMBER 1998, THE FDA 
ANNOUNCED DRAFT GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY ON THIS SUBJECT. 
FINALIZED IN DECEMBER 1999, THIS STATED THAT THE FDA 
BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL HUMAN 
HEALTH IMPACT, WHEN APPROVING SUCH DRUGS, OF THE MICROBIAL 
EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTINICROBIAL \"NEW ANIMAL DRUGS\" 
INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS. 
 
9.  THE CENTER\'S CONCLUSIONS ARE BASED ON DATA FROM THE 
NATIONAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE MONITORING SYSTEM (A 
NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM OPERATED BY THE CENTER IN 
COOPERATION WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND 
PREVENTION AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE), 
PUBLISHED LITERATURE, AND OTHER SOURCES.  THE DATA INDICATE 
THAT THE USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES IN POULTRY IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT 
CAMPYLOBACTER ON POULTRY CARCASSES, AND THEREFORE A 
SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT 
CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS IN HUMANS. 
 
10.  ON OCTOBER 26, 2000, THE CVM ISSUED A \"NOTICE OF 
OPPORTUNITY\" FOR A HEARING ON A PROPOSAL TO WITHDRAW THE 
APPROVAL FOR USE OF ONE FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIAL IN 
POULTRY.  THE OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL REGISTER PUBLISHED THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 06        STATE   229699  041926Z 
NOTICE ON OCTOBER 31, 2000 (FEDERAL REGISTER VOLUME 65, 
NUMBER 211, 64954).  IF A COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO KEEP ITS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET, IT CAN SEEK A 
HEARING; THE REQUEST FOR A HEARING MUST BE MADE WITHIN 30 
DAYS AFTER THE NOTICE WAS PUBLISHED. TWO COMPANIES ARE 
CURRENTLY PRODUCING FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIALS FOR 
THERAPEUTIC USE IN POULTRY (SARAFLOXACIN AND ENROFLOXACIN). 
ONE COMPANY, WHICH PRODUCES SARAFLOXACIN, HAS REQUESTED A 
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS APPROVAL AND THEREFORE WILL NOT SEEK A 
HEARING.  THE OTHER COMPANY HAD NOT YET INDICATED IF IT 
WILL REMOVE ITS PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET.  THE FDA DOCUMENT 
IS AVAILABLE THROUGH FDA\'S DOCKETS MANAGEMENT BRANCH, AT 
HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98FR/CV0076. PDF.  (NOTE: 
MORE INFORMATION ON FDA AUTHORITY TO REMOVE PRODUCTS FROM 
THE MARKET CAN BE FOUND AT: 
HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/FDAC/FEATURES/895_RECALLS. HTML). 
 
11.  CONSISTENT WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS, THE 
UNITED STATES NOTIFIED FDA\'S PROPOSAL TO THE WTO COMMITTEE 
ON SANITARY AND PHYOSANITARY MEASURES ON NOVEMBER 3. 
COMMENTS ARE DUE BY JANUARY 2, 2001. 
 
12. TALKING POINTS: 
 
--      THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) HAS 
PROPOSED WITHDRAWING APPROVAL FOR THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS 
(ANTIMICROBIALS), SPECIFICALLY FLUOROQUINOLONES, USED 
THERAPEUTICALLY IN POULTRY.  TWO COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY 
PRODUCING FLUOROQUINOLONE ANTIMICROBIALS FOR THIS USE.  ONE 
COMPANY HAS AGREED TO WITHDRAW THE PRODUCT VOLUNTARILY FROM 
THE MARKET, WHILE THE OTHER COMPANY HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE ITS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 07        STATE   229699  041926Z 
INTENTION. 
 
--      THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISK ASSOCIATED WITH 
ANTIMICROBIAL USE IN ANIMALS HAS BEEN DEBATED FOR OVER 
THIRTY YEARS. 
 
--      BASED UPON EMERGING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE THAT USES, 
INCLUDING THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF ANTIMICROBIALS IN FOOD- 
PRODUCING ANIMALS, MAY CAUSE BACTERIA TO DEVELOP RESISTANCE 
TO THE USE OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR ANTIBIOTICS IN HUMANS, 
THE FDA ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER 1998 DRAFT GUIDANCE FOR 
INDUSTRY ON THIS SUBJECT.  FINALIZED IN DECEMBER 1999, THIS 
STATED THAT FDA BELIEVES IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE 
POTENTIAL HUMAN HEALTH IMPACT,  WHEN APPROVING SUCH DRUGS, 
OF THE MICROBIAL EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIMICROBIAL \"NEW 
ANIMAL DRUGS\" INTENDED FOR USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS. 
 
--      SINCE THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC 
USE IN FOOD-PRODUCING ANIMALS IN 1995 AND 1996, 
SURVEILLANCE DATA HAVE IDENTIFIED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
THE APPROVAL OF FLUOROQUINOLONES FOR THERAPEUTIC USE IN 
POULTRY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANCE 
IN CAMPYLOBACTER IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS. 
 
--      FDA\'S RISK ASSESSMENT WAS INTENDED TO ESTIMATE THE RISK 
TO HUMAN HEALTH FROM ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT FOODBORNE 
PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMESTIC USE OF 
ANTIMICROBIALS IN FOOD PRODUCING ANIMALS.  SPECIFICALLY, A 
MATHEMATICAL MODEL WAS DERIVED TO RELATE THE PREVALENCE OF 
FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS IN 
HUMANS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF CHICKEN TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 08        STATE   229699  041926Z 
PREVALENCE OF FLUOROQUINOLONE RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER IN 
CHICKENS. 
 
--      FDA STATES IN THE NOTICE OF ITS PROPOSAL PUBLISHED 
OCTOBER 31, 2000 (FEDERAL REGISTER VOLUME 65, NUMBER 211, 
64954) THAT IT BELIEVES: 
 
1.  THE USE OF FLUOROQUINOLONES IN POULTRY CAUSES THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE- RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER, A 
PATHOGEN TO HUMANS, IN POULTRY; 
 
2.  THIS FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER IS 
TRANSFERRED TO HUMANS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER 
INFECTIONS IN HUMANS; AND 
 
3.  FLUOROQUINOLONE-RESISTANT CAMPYLOBACTER INFECTIONS ARE 
A HAZARD TO HUMAN HEALTH. 
 
--      FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON THE RISK ASSESSMENT, 
IT CAN BE FOUND ON FDA\'S WEB SITE AT: 
HTTP://WWW.FDA.GOV/CVM/FDA/MAPPGS/ANTITOC.HTM L 
 
--      THUS, FDA IS PROPOSING TO WITHDRAW THE APPROVAL FOR USE 
OF ENROFLOXACIN, ONE FLUOROQUINOLONE, IN POULTRY ON THE 
GROUNDS THAT NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS THE PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN 
SHOWN TO BE SAFE. 
 
--      THE COMPANY PRODUCING ANOTHER FLUOROQUINOLONE FOR USE 
IN POULTRY, SARAFLOXACIN, PLANS TO WITHDRAW THE PRODUCT 
FROM THE MARKET. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 09        STATE   229699  041926Z 
 
--      THE UNITED STATES NOTIFIED FDA\'S PROPOSAL TO THE WTO 
COMMITTEE ON SANITARY AND PHYOSANITARY MEASURES ON NOVEMBER 
3, AS CALLED FOR UNDER INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.  COMMENTS 
ARE DUE BY JANUARY 2, 2001. 
 
(IF ASKED) 
 
--      IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS STAGE IF THIS WILL AFFECT POULTRY 
PRODUCTS EXPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES.  THE FOOD SAFETY 
AND INSPECTION SERVICE IS EXAMINING THE FDA ACTION TO 
DETERMINE HOW POULTRY IMPORTS FROM COUNTRIES USING 
FLUOROQUINOLONES WILL BE HANDLED.

(B) AND (D) 
 
 
1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST FOR DOHA. PLEASE SEE 
    PARA 3. 
 
2. (S) THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES THAT 
DURING THE TALIBAN DELEGATION VISIT TO QATAR THE 
TALIBAN AND QATARIS MAY DISCUSS A TRIBUNAL OF MUSLIM 
SCHOLARS TO TRY USAMA BIN LADEN IN QATAR. REPORTEDLY, 
UNDER THIS FORMULA, IF THE U.S. OFFERED SUFFICIENT 
EVIDENCE AT THE TRIAL, THEN UBL COULD CONCEIVABLY FACE A 
SENTENCE BY THE ISLAMIC TRIBUNAL. IF THE TRIBUNAL DOES NOT 
FIND HIM GUILTY, THEN UBL WOULD PRESUMABLY BE CONSIDERED 
BY MANY TO BE EXONERATED. PER REFTELCON, QATARI FM HAMAD 
 
BIN JASSIM AL THANI (HBJ) TOLD NEA A/S WALKER ON APRIL 6 
THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY QATARI CONTACTS WITH THE 
TALIBAN ON THE ISSUE OF A TRIAL FOR UBL. THE ONLY 
CONTACTS OF WHICH HBJ WAS AWARE WAS THE CONTACT QATAR 
MADE, IN ITS OIC ROLE, TO URGE THE TALIBAN NOT TO DESTROY 
BUDDHIST ARTIFACTS AND STATUES. HBJ ADDED THE GOQ HAD NO 
INTENTION TO PURSUE SUCH A TRIAL. 
 
3. (S) NOTWITHSTANDING HBJ\'S DENIAL OF ANY QATAR-TALIBAN 
CONTACT ON THIS ISSUE, PUBLIC DISCUSSION OF THIS TRIBUNAL 
OR ANY OTHER OPTION FOR TRYING UBL DURING THE TALIBAN HIGH 
LEVEL VISIT WOULD ONLY SERVE TO CONFUSE THE ISSUE OF 
TALIBAN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RESOLUTIONS. THE SPECIFIC 
OPTION MENTIONED IN REF A IS ALSO UNACCEPTABLE TO THE U.S. 
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT WOULD 
ATTEMPT TO FORCE THE U.S. TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AGAINST BIN 
LADEN OUTSIDE OF U.S. JURISDICTION. IT IS ALSO UNCERTAIN 
WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MEET THE TERMS OF UN 
RESOLUTIONS 1267 AND 1333.   AMBASSADOR MCKUNE IS 
REQUESTED TO DELIVER THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO HBJ OR 
ANOTHER QATARI GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AT A SUITABLE LEVEL: 
 
4. (SECRET/REL QATAR) 
-- WE ARE HEARING RUMORS THAT THE TALIBAN MAY PROPOSE TO 
HOLD A TRIAL FOR USAMA BIN LADEN IN A THIRD COUNTRY. 
 
-- WE UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCH APPROACH TO THE 
GOVERNMENT OF QATAR, BUT WE WANT YOU TO BE AWARE OF OOUR 
VIEWS. WITHOUT STUDYING THE DETAILS OF ANY SUCH PROPOSAL, 
WE SERIOUSLY QUESTION WHETHER A THIRD COUNTRY TRIAL WOULD 
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THE SECURITY COUNCIL HAS LAID DOWN. 
 
-- AS YOU KNOW, BIN LADEN IS UNDER INDICTMENT IN THE US, 
AND OUR POSITION IS THAT WE WANT HIM FOR TRIAL IN THE US. 
IF THE TALEBAN HAVE A SERIOUS PROPOSAL, THEY SHOULD 
PRESENT IT TO THE US. 
 
-- YOU MAY TELL THE TALIBAN THAT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR 
CONVERSATIONS WILL BE SHARED WITH THE UNITED STATES.

PROSPEROUS, STABLE SOCIETIES IN CENTRAL ASIA, COMBATING 
NARCOTICS AND TERRORISM, AND DEVELOPING THE HYDROCARBON 
RESOURCES OF THE CASPIAN REGION. IT HAD BEEN OUR BELIEF 
THAT TURKMENISTAN WAS ONE OF THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS 
BEST PLACED TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND TO A 
MARKET ECONOMY, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST GUARANTOR OF 
STABILITY. YOUR COUNTRY IS BLESSED WITH BOTH ABUNDANT 
NATURAL RESOURCES, AND HARD-WORKING, WELL-EDUCATED, 
TALENTED PEOPLE. WE HAD HOPED TO HELP THAT TRANSITION AND 
TO SEE OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS BECOME EVER CLOSER. WE 
REGRET THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE. FOR OUR PART, WE 
WOULD LIKE TO TURN THIS SITUATION AROUND. 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES AND TURKMENISTAN CAN FIND 
SPECIFIC AREAS OF COOPERATION THAT CAN HELP TURKMENISTAN 
ACHIEVE ITS GOALS AND THAT WILL LEAD TO PRODUCTIVE 
RELATIONS. AS ONE EXAMPLE, WE VIEW PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE TIES 
AS A NECESSARY AND POWERFUL PRELUDE TO BROADER GOVERNMENT- 
TO-GOVERNMENT TIES. OUR CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGE 
PROGRAMS SERVE TO INCREASE THE TURKMEN PEOPLE\'S 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE\'S UNDERSTANDING OF TURKMENISTAN. WE CAN ALSO 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR ECONOMY AND YOUR 
POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS BY PROVIDING NEEDED LANGUAGE AND 
ECONOMIC SKILLS. 
 
IT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT 
PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE EXIT VISAS IN A TIMELY AND IMPARTIAL 
MANNER. MORE TO THE POINT, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE 
GOVERNMENT OF TURKMENISTAN DO AWAY WITH EXIT VISAS 
ALTOGETHER. THEY ARE A LEGACY OF THE SOVIET PAST THAT 
PRESENT AN IMPEDIMENT TO OUR TIES. THERE ARE MANY OTHER 
MEASURES BEYOND THESE IMMEDIATE ISSUES THAT WE CAN 
UNDERTAKE. I WOULD WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS. 
 
IN CLOSING, I WISH YOU EVERY SUCCESS IN YOUR NEW 
POSITION AND TO REITERATE UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR 
TURKMENISTAN\'S INDEPENDENCE AND FOR ITS FUTURE PROSPERITY. 
 
SINCERELY, 
 
COLIN L. POWELL

SUBJECT: CHINA/TIBET: HU CAN\'T GO HOME AGAIN? 
(01-17, 8/02/01) 
 
NSC FOR PATTERSON, TIGHE, NSA FOR MINER, LONDON FOR HALL 
 
THE FOLLOWING INR VIEWPOINT WAS WRITTEN BY AN ANALYST IN 
THE OFFICE OF EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC ANALYSIS AND IS 
PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND COMMENT. 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY PAULA CAUSEY, OFFICE DIRECTOR INR/EAP. 
REASON: 1.5 (D) 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY. VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO\'S JULY 17-23 
VISIT TO   TIBET WAS POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR AT LEAST 
THREE REASONS: IT CONFIRMED CURRENT POLICY; IT ASSOCIATED 
HU PERSONALLY WITH THE CURRENT RELATIVELY HARD-LINE 
APPROACH; AND IT DEMONSTRATED HIS HEALTH AND VITALITY. 
 
2. (C) VICE PRESIDENT HU JINTAO MADE A HIGHLY 
PUBLICIZED TRIP TO TIBET IN MID-JULY TO COMMEMORATE 
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TIBET\'S \"PEACEFUL LIBERATION,\" 
WHICH ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE IN MAY.   SOME FOREIGN 
TIBET WATCHERS HAVE SPECULATED THAT HIS TRIP WAS 
DELAYED WHILE RENOVATIONS AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS 
WERE BEING COMPLETED IN LHASA. WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE 
TO SUGGEST THAT SECURITY CONCERNS MIGHT HAVE DELAYED 
THE TRIP. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE MASSIVE \"NATIONAL 
UNITY TRIPOD\" WHICH HU UNVEILED MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
COMPLETED IN TIME, BUT THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION IS 
THAT HIS TRIP WAS TIMED TO REINFORCE THE MESSAGE OF 
THE FOURTH NATIONAL TIBET CONFERENCE IN JUNE. 
 
3. (C) \"PEACEFUL LIBERATION\" OR \"BLOOD AND TEARS\"? 
HU, IN A    VARIETY OF INSPECTION TOURS, MEET-AND- 
GREET OCCASIONS, AND         PHOTO OPS, REITERATED 
BEIJING\'S POLICY LINE ARTICULATED AT THE CONFERENCE, 
WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY ALL SEVEN POLITBURO STANDING 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HIS KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE LARGE- 
SCALE LHASA COMMEMORATIVE RALLY UNDERSCORED TIBET\'S 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS. 
IN THIS SPEECH AND IN AN ADDRESS TO OFFICIALS WORKING 
IN TIBET, HU ALSO CALLED FOR STRONG EFFORTS TO 
MAINTAIN STABILITY, SAYING TIBET WAS \"A GEOGRAPHIC 
BATTLEFRONT FOR FIGHTING AGAINST [ETHNIC] SEPARATISM.\" 
HE DENOUNCED EFFORTS BY THE \"DALAI CLIQUE\" AND OTHER 
\"ANTI-CHINA FORCES\" TO UNDERMINE STABILITY, A HARD 
LINE DRAWN EVEN MORE CLEARLY BY A PUBLICIZED VISIT TO 
PLA, PEOPLE\'S ARMED POLICE, AND SECURITY POLICE TROOPS 
IN TIBET. 
 
4. (C) PRC POLICY WAS GRAPHICALLY SHOWN BY THE 
PRESENTATION TO THE PLA GARRISON OF A SILK BANNER WITH 
CONGRATULATORY CHARACTERS WRITTEN BY PRESIDENT JIANG AND 
BY THE UNVEILING OF THE 3.5-TON, 15 METER-TALL \"NATIONAL 
UNITY TRIPOD,\" WHICH ALSO BEARS AN INSCRIPTION BY JIANG. 
AN EXILE SPOKESMAN DENOUNCED THE TRIPOD--WHICH MAY HAVE 
BEEN DESIGNED TO REMIND VIEWERS OF THE \"GOLDEN URN\" 
WHICH BEIJING INSISTS MUST BE USED TO SELECT HIGH- 
RANKING RELIGIOUS OFFICIALS--AS AN \"INSULT TO TIBETANS.\" 
THE SPOKESMAN DENOUNCED THE 50 YEARS OF CHINESE RULE AS 
A TIME OF \"BLOOD AND TEARS\" AND SAID THE ANNIVERSARY WAS 
NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION. 
 
5. (C) ET HU, BRUTE? HU\'S REMARKS PLACE HIM FIRMLY AND 
UNEQUIVOCALLY BEHIND THE CENTRAL POLICIES ON TIBET. SOME 
OBSERVERS HOLD OUT HOPE THAT HU MIGHT HAVE MORE LIBERAL 
LEANINGS ON TIBETAN POLICY, HOPES FUELED BOTH BY HIS 
POPULIST APPROACH AS PARTY CHIEF OF POVERTY-STRICKEN 
GUIZHOU IN THE MID-1980S AND BY IMPRESSIONS HE CREATED 
BEFORE BEING ASSIGNED AS PARTY CHIEF IN TIBET IN 1988 AT 
THE HEIGHT OF ETHNIC UNREST IN THE REGION. SOME ALSO SAW 
IN HU\'S LONG ABSENCES FROM TIBET DURING HIS TENURE AS 
PARTY CHIEF A SIGN THAT HE WAS NOT FULLY BEHIND THE HARD- 
LINE CRACKDOWN UNDERWAY AT THE TIME. HU MAY, IN FACT, 
HARBOR MORE LIBERAL LEANINGS, BUT HE GAVE NO HINT OF ANY 
DAYLIGHT BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHER CENTRAL LEADERS DURING 
THIS TRIP. TO DO SO, OF COURSE, WOULD ONLY SERVE TO 
UNDERCUT HIS CHANCES IN THE PARTY LEADERSHIP RESHUFFLE 
COMING IN THE FALL OF 2002. 
 
6. (C) I\'M FINE, REALLY... HU\'S RETURN TO TIBET FOR A 
GRUELING WEEK-LONG VISIT MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO 
SHOW THAT HIS HEALTH IS ROBUST. HIS LENGTHY ABSENCES 
FROM TIBET DURING HIS TENURE AS PARTY SECRETARY WERE 
WIDELY BLAMED ON AN INABILITY TO ACCLIMATIZE TO THE HIGH 
ALTITUDE AND RIGOROUS LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE REGION. 
BY NOT ONLY RETURNING TO LHASA, BUT TRAVELING TO 
SHIGATSE AND MAKING NUMEROUS INSPECTION VISITS, THE 59- 
YEAR-OLD HU PROBABLY HOPED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT NO 
CONCERNS ABOUT HIS HEALTH SHOULD STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS 
SUCCEEDING JIANG AS PARTY CHIEF AND/OR PRESIDENT.

SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE (CORRECTED COPY) 
 
REF: (A)STATE 175414 (NOTAL), (B)ISLAMABAD 5601 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY: CHRISTINA B. ROCCA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS; REASON: 1.5 (B AND D). 
 
(U) THIS IS A CORRECTED COPY OF CABLE PREVIOUSLY SENT WITH 
SAME SUBJECT. (MRN NOT AVAILABLE) 
 
1. (C) ACTION ADDRESSEES SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON 
THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. NOTING SPECIFICALLY 
THAT THESE ARE PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS, ACTION ADDRESSEES 
SHOULD REQUEST HOST COUNTRY INPUT. EMBASSY ISLAMABAD HAS 
MADE A SIMILAR APPROACH (REF A) TO THE GOP BUT MAY USE 
THESE EXPANDED POINTS TO AMPLIFY ITS DISCUSSION. 
 
2. (C) BACKGROUND: 
 
-- AFGHANISTAN\'S STABILITY IS PREDICATED UPON HAVING A 
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT TERRORIST TIES, FRIENDLY TO ITS 
NEIGHBORS, ABLE TO GOVERN, AND ENGAGED IN OVERALL REGIONAL 
COOPERATION AND ECONOMIC REHABILITATION. A FUTURE 
GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY EMERGE FROM THE \"SUPREME COUNCIL\" 
UNDER FORMER KING ZAHIR SHAH\'S SYMBOLIC LEADERSHIP WITH 
NORTHERN ALLIANCE, MAJOR ETHNIC, PARTICULARLY PASHTUN, AND 
SECTARIAN GROUPS. AFGHANISTAN WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE WITH A SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE 
STABILITY FOR POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL RECOVERY, 
INCLUDING HOLDING KABUL AND OTHER URBAN AREAS, AND PROTECT 
THE GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WORKERS FROM 
THOSE THAT SEEK TO CONTINUE THE CONFLICT. 
 
-- AFGHANS WILL NEED HELP TO FORM A GOVERNMENT THAT IN 
COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN CLOSE 
DOWN TERRORISTS\' OPERATIONS, ADHERES TO INTERNATIONAL 
NORMS AND PRACTICES, PARTICULARLY HUMAN RIGHTS AND ISSUES 
CONCERNING WOMEN, AND FACILITATES SAFE DELIVERY OF 
HUMANITARIAN AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. CONSULTATIONS WITH 
COALITION PARTNERS, PARTICULARLY ISLAMIC COUNTRIES AND 
REGIONAL STATES, WILL BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING AND 
IMPLEMENTING A SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD BE WELCOMED 
BY THE \"SUPREME COUNCIL\" AND A FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
3. (C) TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE BELIEVE IT IMPERATIVE TO 
DISCUSS THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. WE 
ANTICIPATE MANY FUTURE, DETAILED EXCHANGES 
OF VIEWS ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC AS EVENTS PROCEED. 
 
-- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT 
INTEND TO, NOR DO WE BELIEVE WE COULD, DETERMINE THIS 
FUTURE. 
 
-- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO COMBAT 
THE PRESENT CRISIS. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COULD WORK TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY 
IN A FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- USG WELCOMES APPOINTMENT OF AMBASSADOR LAKHDAR BRAHIMI 
AS SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND 
LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE REGARDING HIS 
ROLE. WE ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO BE IN CONTACT WITH HIM AS 
WELL. 
 
 -- WE BELIEVE YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN 
SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME INCREASED 
DIALOGUE WITH THE FORMER KING AND BROADENED CONTACTS WITH 
AFGHANS TO ENCOURAGE ANTI-TALIBAN UNITY. 
 
-- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING AT A 
HIGH LEVEL AND EXPECT TO BE ENGAGING IN SIMILAR 
DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER 
INDEPENDENT AFGHANS, PARTICULARLY PASHTUNS, INSIDE AND 
OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME THE FORMATION OF A 
SUPREME COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL UNITY OF AFGHANISTAN 
COMBINING THE ROME GROUP WITH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND 
OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS. 
 
-- WE ARE LOOKING AT PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE 
ROME GROUP TO DEFRAY IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. 
 
-- ULTIMATELY, IT IS UP TO THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN TO 
DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE. THAT SAID, WE BELIEVE THAT 
THERE ARE CERTAIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED INTERNATIONAL 
PRINCIPLES WHICH ANY GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO ADHERE TO. IT 
WILL NEED TO BE BROAD-BASED, MULTI-ETHNIC, AND GENERALLY 
REPRESENTATIVE, RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, END ALL SUPPORT FOR 
TERRORISM, AND FOLLOW ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF INTERNATIONAL 
BEHAVIOR. 
 
-- BY DEFINITION, ANY TRANSITION OR FUTURE GOVERNMENT 
COULD NOT BE COMPOSED OF JUST ONE AFGHAN FACTION. TO BE 
SPECIFIC, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE 
(COMPOSED LARGELY OF TAJIKS AND UZBEKS) ALONE COULD OR 
SHOULD RULE AFGHANISTAN GIVEN ITS LIMITED ETHNIC 
COMPOSITION. THE NA WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE A ROLE IN ANY 
FUTURE GOVERNMENT, AS SHOULD OTHER SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF 
AFGHAN SOCIETY. 
 
-- WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT AFGHANISTAN\'S NEIGHBORS HAVE 
LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN. WE 
BELIEVE THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE THOSE 
 
INTERESTS INTO ACCOUNT. PAKISTAN DOES NOT WANT TO BE FACED 
WITH A HOSTILE AFGHANISTAN WITH TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. IRAN 
WANTS THE SHI\'A PROTECTED AND NO DRUGS. PAKISTAN AND IRAN 
WANT REFUGEES TO RETURN HOME. UZBEKISTAN, TURKMENISTAN, 
AND TAJIKISTAN WANT PEACEFUL BORDERS. 
 
-- WE WOULD NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT OTHER NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES ALSO HAVE LEGITIMATE INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE 
POLITICAL SETUP IN AFGHANISTAN. WE DO NOT SEE ANY 
IRRECONCILABLE CONFLICT AMONG THESE INTERESTS AS LONG AS 
AFGHANS AND OUTSIDE INTERESTS ARE FLEXIBLE. 
 
-- WE HAVE MADE THESE POINTS TO OUR AFGHAN CONTACTS. 
 
-- YOUR COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED ON ALL 
FRONTS. WE EXPECT TO BE IN FREQUENT CONTACT WITH YOU ON 
THIS TOPIC AND WELCOME YOUR VIEWS. 
 
4. (C) BELOW ADDRESSEES SHOULD ADD THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 
 
FOR SIX PLUS TWO MEMBERS: 
 
-- YOUR COUNTRY, ALONG WITH AFGHANISTAN\'S OTHER NEIGHBORS, 
HAS LEGITIMATE NATIONAL INTERESTS RELATING TO AFGHANISTAN 
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. YOUR COOPERATION IS 
VITAL TO THE EMERGENCE OF A FUTURE PEACEFUL, STABLE 
AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- WE ARE CONSIDERING WHEN AND AT WHAT LEVEL THE SIX PLUS 
TWO MIGHT MEET TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. 
 
FOR EMBASSY NEW DELHI: 
 
-- INDIA HAS A LONG HISTORY WITH AFGHANISTAN AS WELL AS 
KEY INTERESTS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. INDIA, 
LIKE PAKISTAN, SHOULD NOT BE FACED WITH A HOSTILE 
AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- INDIA\'S COOPERATION IS VITAL AND WELCOMED. WE 
ANTICIPATE A DIALOGUE WITH INDIA ON REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
OF THIS TOPIC AS THE SITUATION DEVELOPS. 
 
FOR EMBASSY TOKYO: 
 
-- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR STRONG INTEREST IN THE 
ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, AND SOCIAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- WE VALUE OUR BILATERAL EXCHANGES ON THIS ISSUE, BOTH IN 
TOKYO AND IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS ON THE MARGINS OF 
RECENT MEETINGS IN BERLIN AND GENEVA. 
 
-- WE ALSO THINK YOUR SUPPORT FOR PAKISTAN AS IT GRAPPLES 
WITH ITS ECONOMIC NEEDS IS VERY HELPFUL, ESPECIALLY AS 
PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF HAS BEEN TAKING RISKS DOMESTICALLY BY 
JOINING OUR INTERNATIONAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM. 
 
-- WE VIEW YOU AS AN INTEGRAL PARTNER AS WE FOCUS ON AN 
ASSISTANCE AND POLITICAL/ECONOMIC RECOVERY PLAN FOR A 
FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. 
 
FOR EMBASSY PARIS: 
 
-- WE WERE DELIGHTED TO SEE THAT, IN YOUR EXCELLENT PLAN 
FOR ASSISTING AFGHANISTAN, YOU ARE CONCENTRATING ON THE 
SAME AREAS OUR OWN THINKING ENCOMPASSES. FRENCH 
LEADERSHIP ON THHIS ISSUE WILL ASSURE THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ADDRESSES THESE URGENT TASKS 
EFFICIENTLY AND WELL. WE SHOULD STAY IN CLOSE TOUCH ON 
THE WAY FORWARD. 
 
-- WE SHARE YOUR PARTICULAR CONCERNS REGARDING ERADICATION 
OF OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION. 
 
--WE BELIEVE FRANCE AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EU HAVE AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN PROVIDING A BETTER FUTURE FOR 
THE AFGHAN PEOPLE AND WELCOME THE EU\'S EXPERTISE IN 
DEVISING A RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME.

SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN\'S POLITICAL FUTURE 
 
REF: (A)STATE 175414 (NOTAL), (B)ISLAMABAD 5601 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY: CHRISTINA B. ROCCA, ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS; REASON: 1.5 (B AND D). 
 
1. (C) ACTION ADDRESSEES SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON 
THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. NOTING SPECIFICALLY 
THAT THESE ARE PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS, ACTION ADDRESSEES 
SHOULD REQUEST HOST COUNTRY INPUT. EMBASSY ISLAMABAD HAS 
MADE A SIMILAR APPROACH (REF A) TO THE GOP BUT MAY USE THESE 
EXPANDED POINTS TO AMPLIFY ITS DISCUSSION. 
 
2. (C) BACKGROUND: 
 
-- AFGHANISTAN\'S STABILITY IS PREDICATED UPON HAVING A 
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT TERRORIST TIES, FRIENDLY TO ITS 
NEIGHBORS, AND ENGAGED IN OVERLL REGIONAL COOPERATION AND 
ECONOMIC REHABILITATION. A FUTURE GOVERNMENT WILL LIKELY 
EMERGE FROM THE \"SUPREME COUNCIL\" UNDER FORMER KING ZAHIR 
SHAH\'S SYMBOLIC LEADERSHIP WITH NORTHERN ALLIANCE, MAJOR 
ETHNIC, PARTICULARLY PASHTUN, AND SECTARIAN GROUPS. 
 
AFGHANISTAN WILL NEED INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WITH A 
SECURITY ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE STABILITY FOR 
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY, INCLUDING HOLDING KABUL AND 
OTHER URBAN AREAS, AND PROTECT THE GOVERNMENT AND 
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE WORKERS FROM THOSE THAT SEEK TO 
CONTINUE THE CONFLICT. 
 
-- AFGHANS WILL NEED HELP TO FORM A GOVERNMENT THAT IN 
COOPERATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CAN CLOSE DOWN 
TERRORISTS OPERATIONS, ADHERES TO INTERNATIONAL NORMS AND 
PRACTICES, PARTICULARLY HUMAN RIGHTS, ISSUES CONCERNING 
WOMEN, AND FACILITATES SAFE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND 
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE. CONSULTATIONS WITH COALITION PARTNERS, 
PARTICULARLY ISLAMIC COUNTRIES AND REGIONAL STATES, WILL BE 
IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING AND IMPLEMENTING A SECURITY 
ARRANGMENT THAT WOULD BE WELCOMED BY THE \"SUPREME COUNCIL\" 
AND A FUTURE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
3. (C) TALKING POINTS: 
 
-- WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE BELIEVE IT IMPERATIVE TO 
DISCUSS THE POLITICAL FUTURE OF AFGHANISTAN. WE ANTICIPATE 
MANY FUTURE, DETAILED EXCHANGES OF VIEWS ON THIS IMPORTANT 
TOPIC AS EVENTS PROCEED. 
 
-- WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT 
INTEND TO, NOR DO WE BELIEVE WE COULD, DETERMINE THIS 
FUTURE. 
 
-- AS YOU KNOW WE ARE PROVIDING HUMANITARIAN AID TO COMBAT 
THE PRESENT CRISIS. WE AND OTHER COUNTRIES MADE GENEROUS 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNSYG\'S EMERGENCY APPEAL, BUT THERE IS 
STILL MORE TO BE DONE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, COULD WORK TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY 
IN A FUTURE AFGHANISTAN. 
 
-- USG WELCOMES APPOINTMENT OF AMBASSADOR LAKHDAR BRAHIMI 
AS SECRETARY GENERAL\'S SPECIAL ENVOY FOR AFGHANISTAN AND 
LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. WE EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN 
DISCUSSIONS WITH HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE REGARDING UN 
ROLE IN BRINGING PEACE AND STABILITY TO AFGHANISTAN. WE 
ENCOURAGE PAKISTANI CONTACTS WITH HIM AS WELL. 
 
-- WE BELIEVE YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN SOLVING 
THE PROBLEMS OF AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME INCREASED DIALOGUE 
WITH THE FORMER KING AND BROADENED CONTACTS WITH 
AFGHANS TO ENCOURAGE ANTI-TALEBAN UNITY. 
 
-- WE HAVE ALSO BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING AT A 
HIGH LEVEL AND EXPECT TO BE ENGAGING IN SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS 
WITH BOTH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER 
INDEPENDENTAFGHANS, PARTICULARLY PASHTUNS, INSIDE AND 
OUTSIDE AFGHANISTAN. WE WELCOME THE FORMATION OF A SUPREME 
COUNCIL FOR NATIONAL UNITY OF AFGHANISTAN COMBINING THE ROME 
GROUP WITH THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE AND OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS.

COULD OR SHOULD RULE AFGHANISTAN GIVEN ITS LIMITED ETHNIC 
COMPOSITION. THE NA WILL, OF COURSE, HAVE A ROLE IN ANY

THAT ANY FUTURE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE THOSE INTERESTS INTO

1. (U)  THIS TELEGRAM HAS BEEN CLEARED BY M/P (SEP). 
 
2.  (S) POSTS SHOULD DRAW FROM POINTS BELOW IN DISCUSSIONS 
WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS REGARDING U.S. VIEWS ON THE FUTURE 
OF AFGHANISTAN.  THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN IS FLUID. 
WITH EVENTS MOVING RAPIDLY, WE ASK POSTS TO REFRAIN FROM 
MAKING UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR POLICIES WITH 
REGARD TO AFGHANISTAN.  DEPARTMENT WILL PROVIDE ALDAC 
UPDATES AS THE SITUATION EVOLVES. PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE 
TALKING POINTS AS NON-PAPERS WITH HOST GOVERNMENTS.  POSTS 
SHOULD REFER QUESTIONS REGARDING CONTACTS WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES OF AFGHAN FACTIONS, INCLUDING THE NORTHERN 
ALLIANCE (NA-UNITED FRONT) TO SA/PAB.  DEALING WITH THESE 
GROUPS IS BEING HANDLED VERY CAREFULLY BY WASHINGTON TO 
AVOID SENDING SIGNALS WHICH MIGHT BE MISINTERPRETED OR 
CONVEYING MIXED MESSAGES.  WE WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE 
REPORTING ON SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSES FROM HOST GOVERNMENTS. 
NOTE:  THIS CABLE DOES NOT ADDRESS ON-GOING INTELLIGENCE 
OR MILITARY OPERATIONS. 
 
3.  (SBU) TALKING POINTS 
 
FIGHTING TERRORISM 
------------------ 
 
--OUR GOAL IS TO ROOT OUT AND DESTROY THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK 
AND ENSURE THAT AFGHANISTAN WILL NEVER AGAIN BE A BASE FOR 
TERRORIST OPERATIONS.  NOR DO WE WANT TO SEE AN 
AFGHANISTAN THAT PRODUCES DRUGS, CREATES MILLIONS OF 
REFUGEES, OR CONTRIBUTES TO REGIONAL INSTABILITY. 
 
--WE ARE NOT TARGETING ISLAM OR THE PEOPLE OF AFGHANISTAN, 
BUT WE ARE TARGETING THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND THE TALIBAN 
LEADERSHIP.  (NOTE: POSTS MAY ELABORATE ON THIS IMPORTANT 
POINT FROM PUBLIC DIPLOMACY TALKING POINTS.) 
 
--OUR MILITARY CAMPAIGN IS GEARED AT DESTROYING TALIBAN 
MILITARY CAPABILITY AND AL-QAIDA OPERATIONS THROUGH AN AIR 
AND TARGETED GROUND CAMPAIGN.  WE ARE COMMITTED FOR AS 
LONG AS IS NECESSARY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECTIVES. 
 
--THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST 
TERRORISM IS A SUSTAINED CAMPAIGN THAT WILL OUTLAST THE 
IMMEDIATE EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN, BUT OUR IMMEDIATE FOCUS 
IS THE AL-QAIDA NETWORK AND ITS BASE IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
--THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT OUR MILITARY CAMPAIGN 
WILL HAVE TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE MONTH OF RAMADAN IN 
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT USAMA BIN LADEN AND HIS SUPPORTERS DO 
NOT STRENGTHEN THEIR POSITIONS.  WE ASK YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
IN THIS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO 
ENSURE THAT MILITARY ACTIONS DO NOT IMPACT INNOCENT 
CIVILIANS. 
 
POST-TALIBAN AFGHANISTAN 
------------------------ 
 
--U.S. POLICY REGARDING AFGHANISTAN HAS FOUR BASIC 
ELEMENTS: ERADICATION OF TERRORISM, HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE AND RECONSTRUCTION, REGIONAL STABILITY, AND A 
PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN. 
 
--ELIMINATING BIN LADEN AND HIS ASSOCIATES FROM 
AFGHANISTAN IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP OF THE PROCESS. 
OUSTING THE TALIBAN LEADERSHIP AND HELPING A BROAD-BASED, 
REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT TO FORM IS ALSO A HIGH PRIORITY. 
NEITHER OF THESE TASKS WILL BE EASY, PARTICULARLY GIVEN 
THE ETHNIC AND REGIONAL DIVISIONS WITHIN AFGHANISTAN AND 
THE DIFFICULTIES OF COALITION-BUILDING. 
 
--WE DO NOT WANT TO CHOOSE WHO RULES AFGHANISTAN, BUT WE 
WILL ASSIST THOSE WHO SEEK A PEACEFUL AFGHANISTAN FREE OF 
TERRORISM AND ADDRESSING THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC NEEDS OF ITS 
PEOPLE. 
 
--WE BELIEVE THAT ALL LEGITIMATE AFGHAN GROUPS, INCLUDING 
THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE, ROME GROUP BASED AROUND EX-KING 
ZAHIR SHAH, AND SOUTHERN PASHTUNS, MUST PLAY A ROLE IN A 
BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT.  IN THE FUTURE AFGHANISTAN, 
TALIBAN RANK AND FILE BELOW THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL NEED TO 
INTEGRATE PEACEFULLY IN A CIVIL SOCIETY. 
 
--WE ARE IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE FORMER KING IN ROME 
AND OTHER INDEPENDENT AFGHANS AROUND THE WORLD.  WE 
WELCOME THE FORMER KINGS INITIATIVE TO UNITE THE ROME 
GROUP, OTHER AFGHAN GROUPS AND THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE UNDER 
ONE UMBRELLA -- THE SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL (SNC)  - 
COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A POLITICAL ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
TALIBAN. 
 
--THIS EFFORT IS AIMED AT LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A 
BROAD-BASED GOVERNMENT THAT REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF 
ALL ETHNIC AND REGIONAL GROUPS AND REFLECTS THE WISHES OF 
THE AFGHAN PEOPLE.  THE GOVERNMENT ENVISIONED BY THE 
SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL WILL RESPECT HUMAN RIGHTS, END 
TERRORISM, AND FOLLOW INTERNATIONALLY ACCEPTED NORMS OF 
BEHAVIOR. 
 
--WE HAVE URGED PLAYERS IN ROME AND ELSEWHERE TO 
ACCELERATE THE PLAN TO CONVENE A SUPREME NATIONAL COUNCIL, 
WHILE APPEALING TO OTHER AFGHAN PARTIES TO SUPPORT THE 
PROCESS. 
 
--WE WELCOME THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FORMER KING AND THE 
NORTHERN ALLIANCE TO WORK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
SUPREME COUNCIL. 
 
--WE ARE AWARE OF THE PAST HISTORY ABUSE IN AFGHANISTAN 
INCLUDING DURING THE EARLY 1990\'S.  WE CANNOT CONDONE A 
REPETITION OF THESE ABUSES OR ATTEMPTS TO RULE AFGHANISTAN 
THAT EXCLUDES ANY ETHNIC GROUPS.  WE WANT AN AFGHANISTAN 
THAT DOES NOT THREATEN OR IS THREATENED BY ITS NEIGHBORS. 
 
--PUTTING TOGETHER A POLITICAL EQUATION IS TIME-CONSUMING, 
BUT SPEED IS OF THE ESSENCE.  A POWER VACUUM COULD DEVELOP 
IN KABUL AND CITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AT ANY TIME. 
ALTHOUGH MILITARY ACTIVITY IS STILL UNDERWAY, PLANNING AND 
INITIAL STEPS MUST BEGIN NOW TO COMPLEMENT OUR MILITARY 
AND HUMANITARIAN OBJECTIVES.  A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE 
TALIBAN COULD HELP ENCOURAGE SUPPORTERS OF THE TALIBAN TO 
DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM THE REGIME. 
 
--SECURITY OF LIBERATED AREAS WILL BE A MAJOR CONCERN. 
WHILE IT IS DESIRABLE THAT THE AFGHANS DEVELOP THEIR OWN 
SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, ONE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE ARE 
WEIGHING IS AN INTERNATIONAL ARMED FORCE TO PROVIDE 
SECURITY, PARTICULARLY IN KABUL. 
 
--WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE UN AND OTHER INTERESTED 
NATIONS TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY 
ARRANGEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  WE WELCOME YOUR VIEWS ON THIS 
QUESTION. 
 
ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
------------------------------- 
 
--A SUSTAINED EFFORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WILL 
BE NEEDED TO ENSURE AFGHANISTANS REHABILITATION AND 
FORWARD MOMENTUM.  WE WILL WORK TO REDOUBLE THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITYS PAST EFFORTS TO STABILIZE 
AFGHANISTAN, BUT ULTIMATELY THE AFGHAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES 
MUST MAKE THE IMPORTANT DECISIONS CONCERNING THEIR FUTURE. 
 
--WE WELCOME UN SRSG LAKHDAR BRAHIMIS LEAD ROLE IN THIS 
EFFORT AND URGE ALL UN MEMBERS TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT HIS 
MISSION. 
 
HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
--WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THE AFGHAN 
PEOPLE.  DECADES OF CONFLICT, THREE YEARS OF DROUGHT, AND 
TALIBAN ABUSE AND MISMANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THEIR 
PROFITEERING FROM ILLICIT OPIUM CULTIVATION AND 
TRAFFICKING, HAVE BROUGHT AFGHANISTAN TO HUMANITARIAN 
DISASTER. 
 
--WE WILL WORK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO DEVELOP 
A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION PLAN FOR A POST- 
CONFLICT AFGHANISTAN.  WE ANTICIPATE A HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE DONORS CONFERENCE.  THE FOCUS OF THESE EFFORTS 
WILL BE QUICK-IMPACT PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE IMMEDIATE 
IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING 
RESETTLEMENT OF REFUGEES AND DISPLACED PERSONS. 
 
--OUR HIGHEST IMMEDIATE PRIORITY IS TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO 
DELIVER FOOD AND OTHER RELIEF INSIDE AFGHANISTAN, EVEN AS 
MILITARY OPERATIONS ARE TAKING PLACE. 
 
--DELIVERIES CONTINUE INTO AFGHANISTAN DESPITE THE 
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND INCREASING TALIBAN 
INTERFERENCE/LOOTING.  IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE 
ASSISTANCE REACH NEEDY AFGHANS BEFORE THE ONSET OF WINTER 
IN A FEW WEEKS. 
 
--THE U.S. HAS BEEN THE LARGEST DONOR OF HUMANITARIAN 
RELIEF FOR AFGHANISTAN, HAVING PROVIDED CLOSE TO $1 
BILLION IN ASSISTANCE OVER RECENT YEARS.  THE PRESIDENT 
RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL $320 MILLION.  AT THE 
OCTOBER 5 DONORS CONFERENCE IN GENEVA, THERE WERE PLEDGES 
MADE BY ALL COUNTRIES FOR $736 MILLION.  ADDITIONAL 
PLEDGES CONTINUE TO COME IN ON A DAILY BASIS.  UN AGENCIES 
NEED CASH NOW.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR COUNTRIES TO MAKE GOOD 
ON PLEDGES WITH QUICK DISBURSEMENTS. 
 
--DOD AIRDROPS ARE ONLY ONE PART OF OUR ASSISTANCE AND ARE 
TARGETED AT HARD-TO-REACH AREAS.  WITH WINTER APPROACHING, 
WE ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF AIRLIFTS (NOT 
AIRDROPS) TO REACH THESE AREAS. 
 
CONCLUSION 
---------- 
 
--WE WOULD WELCOME YOUR VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES, AND LOOK 
FORWARD TO A CONTINUING DIALOGUE WITH YOU.

SUBJECT: ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
(THIS CABLE HAS BEEN CLEARED BY M/P (SEP).) 
 
----------- 
1.  SUMMARY 
----------- 
 
THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO PROVIDE 
THE ANNUAL REPORT \"PATTERNS OF GLOBAL 
TERRORISM\" TO CONGRESS.  THE LAW REQUIRES THAT 
THE REPORT BE A FULL AND COMPLETE FACTUAL 
RECORD OF TERRORISM-RELATED ACTIVITY IN 
COUNTRIES THAT EXPERIENCED TERRORISM.  IT 
SHOULD NOT BE TEMPERED BY CONCERNS ABOUT HOST 
GOVERNMENT SENSITIVITIES TO THE FACTS 
PRESENTED.  THE REPORT IS DUE TO CONGRESS NEXT 
APRIL, BUT POSTS SHOULD RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE 
BY DECEMBER 14, 2001.  AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER 
DETAIL BELOW, POSTS SHOULD REPORT ON HOST 
GOVERNMENT COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS AND 
ATTITUDES. LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE 
DEPARTMENT REPORT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE 
EXTENT OF HOST GOVERNMENT COOPERATION WITH THE 
UNITED STATES ON TERRORISM CASES DURING THE 
PAST FIVE YEARS.  SEE PARAGRAPH 2 (K,L,M). 
 
THIS YEARS PATTERNS WILL TAKE A NEW 
REPORTING APPROACH IN VIEW OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 
TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES.   THIS 
YEAR\'S REPORT WILL LIKELY BE MORE WIDELY READ 
THAN ANY PRODUCED IN PREVIOUS YEARS. POSTS NEED 
TO PLACE SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON THE NATURE AND 
QUALITY OF HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT TO THE 
GLOBAL COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM.  THE REPORT 
WILL ASSESS THE SUPPORT WE HAVE RECEIVED. 
 
WE ARE ALSO PLANNING SOME NEW FEATURES FOR THIS 
REPORT, AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE POSTS\' SPECIAL 
ATTENTION IN THIS REGARD.  THE DEPARTMENT 
APPRECIATES THE EXCELLENT REPORTING POSTS HAVE 
PROVIDED ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST. 
 
S/CT WILL COMPILE THE REPORT USING EXISTING 
DATABASES THAT CONTAIN FACTUAL ACCOUNTS OF 
TERRORIST INCIDENTS RECORDED DURING THE YEAR 
2001.  POSTS NEED NOT PROVIDE SUCH DETAILS IN 
THEIR RESPONSES. 
 
POSTS SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PROVIDE 
UNCLASSIFIED RESPONSES, ALTHOUGH THE DEPARTMENT 
IS AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE A SEPARATE CLASSIFIED 
SUPPLEMENT TO ITS REPORT. 
 
PARAGRAPH 4 BELOW PROVIDES SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS 
FOR USUN. (END SUMMARY.) 
 
------------------ 
2.  POST RESPONSES 
------------------ 
 
POSTS\' REPORTS SHOULD ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING: 
 
A)  BECAUSE THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE REPORT WILL 
BE ON THE POST-SEPTEMBER 11 GLOBAL COALITION, 
POSTS SHOULD HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS 
TAKEN BY HOST GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT THAT 
COALITION, PARTICULARLY ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST 
AL-QAIDA AND THE TALIBAN.  MUCH OF THIS 
INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED IN A 
MATRIX MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT\'S TERRORISM 
TASK FORCE.  (NOTE:  WE ALSO PLAN TO INCLUDE IN 
THE REPORT A SEPARATE MATRIX SHOWING WHICH 
COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED OR RATIFIED ANY OF THE 12 
INTERNATIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM CONVENTIONS, AND 
WHICH COUNTRIES HAVE NOT DONE SO.  AS THIS 
INFORMATION IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED, POSTS 
NEED NOT REPEAT THIS IN THEIR RESPONSES TO THIS 
CABLE.) 
 
B)  AMONG THE NEW FEATURES, THE DEPARTMENT IS 
PLANNING TO FOCUS ON SEVERAL CASE STUDIES - 
VIVID EXAMPLES  OF TERRORIST INCIDENTS THAT 
WERE THWARTED, AND TERRORIST CELLS THAT WERE 
BROKEN UP, DURING 2001.  DEPARTMENT WOULD 
APPRECIATE SOME EXAMPLES FROM POSTS THAT ARE 
WELL DOCUMENTED AND UNCLASSIFIED.  DEPARTMENT 
WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE RECEIVING BY POUCH ANY 
PARTICULARLY EVOCATIVE OR DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS 
THAT WOULD HELP ILLUSTRATE THESE CASE STUDIES. 
PLEASE INCLUDE THE NAME OF THE PUBLICATION IN 
WHICH THE PHOTO ORIGINALLY APPEARED AND THE 
DATE OF APPEARANCE.  PHOTOS CAN ALSO BE SENT 
ELECTRONICALLY TO: 
 
J.REAP@STATE.GOV 
OR, AS LISTED IN STATE\'S UNCLASSIFIED GLOBAL 
ADDRESS BOOK: 
(RIA) REAP, JR., JOSEPH W 
 
THE DEPARTMENT WILL ACQUIRE REPRINT RIGHTS FOR 
ANY PICTURES SELECTED FOR PUBLICATION. 
 
THE FOLLOWING ALSO APPLY MORE BROADLY TO 
TERRORIST ACTS NOT RELATED TO SEPTEMBER 11. 
 
C) DESCRIBE THE RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 
OF EACH COUNTRY TO ACTS OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM AND/OR SIGNIFICANT ACTS OF DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM DURING 2001, INCLUDING ANY HOST 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM.

SUBJECT: CW PROLIFERATION DEMARCHE: IRANIAN ORDER FOR 
LARGE QUANTITY OF CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINA (S) 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: EAP DAS DONALD W. KEYSER. REASON: 1.5(B,C,D)X1, X5 
 
1. (S) BACKGROUND: DURING MISSILE NONPROLIFERATION TALKS ON 
MARCH 6 IN WASHINGTON, CHINA\'S MFA ARMS CONTROL AND 
DISARMAMENT DIRECTOR GENERAL LIU JIEYI TOLD NP A/S WOLF THAT 
CHINA WAS TAKING SEVERAL, SIGNIFICANT NEW STEPS TO TIGHTEN 
CHINA\'S NUCLEAR, CHEMICAL, AND BIOLOGICAL EXPORT REGULATIONS, 
INCLUDING HAVING INTERIM CONTROLS COVERING ALL ITEMS ON THE 
AUSTRALIA GROUP (AG) CONTROL LIST IN PLACE BY THE END OF 
MARCH. 
 
2. (S) THIS IS WELCOME ACTION THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE. WE 
ALSO WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF 
THESE CONTROLS, AND RAISE OUR CONCERNS ABOUT IRANIAN ENTITIES 
SEEKING DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINA. IN 
PARTICULAR, INFORMATION EXISTS THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE 
APPROACHED TWO CHINESE FIRMS -- ZIBO CHEMET EQUIPMENT PLANT, 
ALSO KNOWN AS ZIBO CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT PLANT (ZCEP), AND 
LIAOYANG PHARMACEUTICAL MACHINERY IMPORT AND EXPORT (LPMIE) 
-- FOR LARGE QUANTITIES OF DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT. WE 
WANT CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE AND TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT 
THE TRANSFER. 
 
2. (C) ACTION REQUEST: DEPARTMENT REQUESTS POST CONVEY THE 
POINTS IN PARA 3 TO THE APPROPRIATE HOST GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS. 
 
3. (S - REL CHINA) BEGIN TALKING POINTS. 
-- WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR GOVERNMENT\'S PUBLICATION AND 
ENFORCEMENT OF AN INTERIM MEASURE CONTROLLING ALL ITEMS 
LISTED IN THE AUSTRALIA GROUP LISTS. THESE MEASURES WILL 
HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THAT 
POSE A THREAT TO THE CITIZENS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES. 
 
-- WE ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND OTHER WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION BY 
STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM SUCH AS IRAN. 
 
-- IRAN HAS ACKNOWLEDGED ITS PAST DEVELOPMENT OF CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS. IRAN ALSO HAS CONTINUED ITS EFFORTS TO SEEK 
DUAL-USE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY, EXPERTISE, AND PRECURSOR 
CHEMICALS FROM CHINESE ENTITIES. THIS ASSISTANCE COULD BE 
USED TO CREATE A MORE ADVANCED AND SELF-SUFFICIENT CHEMICAL 
WARFARE INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
-- IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT IRAN IS SEEKING TO 
PROCURE LARGE QUANTITIES OF AUSTRALIA GROUP-CONTROLLED, 
DUAL-USE CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT FROM CHINESE COMPANIES. 
SPECIFICALLY, IRANIAN FIRMS HAVE APPROACHED THE CHINESE FIRM 
ZIBO CHEMET EQUIPMENT PLANT -- ALSO KNOWN AS ZIBO CHEMICAL 
EQUIPMENT PLANT (ZCEP) -- AND LIAOYANG PHARMACEUTICAL 
MACHINERY IMPORT AND EXPORT (LPMIE). WE BELIEVE THAT IRAN 
HAS ACTED THROUGH LPMIE\'S SALES REPRESENTATIVE IN IRAN, ARYA 
FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATION. 
 
-- THE FACT THAT IRAN IS SEEKING SUCH A LARGE QUANTITY OF 
GLASS-LINED CHEMICAL PROCESSING EQUIPMENT RAISES SERIOUS 
CONCERNS THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT FOR LEGITIMATE PURPOSES, 
BUT IN FACT WILL BE DIVERTED TO IRAN\'S OFFENSIVE CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS PROGRAM. 
 
-- WE URGE CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER AND TAKE ALL 
NECESSARY STEPS TO STOP THIS TRANSACTION FROM OCCURRING AND 
PREVENT CHINESE ENTITIES FROM CONTRIBUTING EVEN INADVERTENTLY 
TO IRAN\'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM. AS A STATE PARTY TO THE 
CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION, CHINA HAS AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL 
OBLIGATION NOT TO ASSIST ANYONE, IN ANY WAY, IN CHEMICAL 
WEAPONS ACTIVITIES. 
 
-- WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE RESULTS OF YOUR 
INVESTIGATION. 
END POINTS.

3. (C) SUMMARY: PRESIDENT GUSMAO INFORMED SECRETARY 
POWELL ABOUT EAST TIMOR\'S PROPOSAL FOR AN INTERNATIONAL 
TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION ON THE 1999 POST-REFERENDUM 
VIOLENCE IN EAST TIMOR. THE SECRETARY SAID HE WAS 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS THUS FAR RENDERED BY THE 
INDONESIAN AD HOC TRIBUNAL IN JAKARTA; ABASSADOR PROSPER 
DESCRIBED THE TIMORESE PROPOSAL AS \"CREATIVE.\" GUSMAO 
SAID THAT THE BAYU-UNDAN OIL AND GAS FIELD WOULD BEGIN TO 
PRODUCE REVENUE BY 2004, BUT THE MUCH LARGER SUNRISE FIELD 
WOULD NOT COME ON-LINE UNTIL 2008. THE RESULTS OF 
REVENUE-SHARING NEGOTIATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA WOULD 
DETERMINE WHETHER EAST TIMOR WOULD BECOME ANOTHER KUWAIT 
OR ANOTHER CAPE VERDE. GUSMAO OPINED THAT UNTIL THE 
PETROLEUM INCOME CAME ON-LINE, EAST TIMOR WOULD NEED 
SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE. IN THIS REGARD, HE 
THANKED THE U.S. FOR OUR AID, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRACY 
PROGRAMS, AND SAID THAT HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD MAINTAIN A 
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE FUTURE, IF ONLY A LIMITED ONE. 
GUSMAO ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP BUILD A 
BARRACKS FOR THE EAST TIMOR DEFENSE FORCE. FOLLOWING THE 
MEETING, SECRETARY POWELL AND PRESIDENT GUSMAO SIGNED A 
STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT. END SUMMARY. 
 
EAST TIMOR AFTER INDEPENDENCE 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (C) SECRETARY POWELL OPENED BY CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT 
GUSMAO ON EAST TIMOR\'S ACHIEVEMENTS OVER THE PAST YEAR, AS 
WELL AS FOR ITS ACCESSION TO THE UN LAST WEEK. PRESIDENT 
GUSMAO SAID THAT WHILE THE HANDOVER OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY 
FROM THE UN TO THE TIMORESE HAD GONE SMOOTHLY, HE FACED 
THE TWIN CHALLENGES OF BUILDING MANAGEMENT CAPACITY IN THE 
GOVERNMENT AND FULFILLING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE. 
THE PEOPLE WERE SHOWING A SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT 
WHAT INDEPENDENCE COULD AND COULD NOT DELIVER, BUT THEY 
WANTED RESULTS. 
 
INTERNATIONAL TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION 
------------------------------------------ 
 
5. (C) GUSMAO NOTED THAT EAST TIMOR\'S RELATIONS WITH 
INDONESIA WERE GOOD, AS EVIDENCED BY FOREIGN MINISTER 
RAMOS-HORTA\'S UPCOMING VISIT TO JAKARTA TO ATTEND MEETINGS 
OF THE SOUTHWEST PACIFIC FORUM AND EAST TIMOR-INDONESIA 
JOINT COMMISSION.   HOWEVER, GUSMAO SAID, THERE WERE 
RESIDUAL ISSUES THAT REMAINED -- GUSMAO HAD BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS THUS FAR AT INDONESIA\'S AD 
HOC TRIBUNAL ON THE 1999 POST-REFERENDUM VIOLENCE.    RAMOS- 
HORTA THEN OUTLINED EAST TIMOR\'S POSITION ON PROSECUTING 
THE PERPETRATORS OF THE POST-REFERENDUM VIOLENCE. THE 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT GIVEN THE TRIBUNAL\'S FAILURE, 
THE UNIVERSAL CRITICISM IT HAS RECEIVED, AND THE LACK OF 
ANY INDICATION THAT IT WOULD DELIVER IN THE FUTURE, THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FACED THREE CHOICES. THE FIRST, 
TO DO NOTHING, WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO THE VICTIMS OF THE 
VIOLENCE. THE SECOND CHOICE, THE FORMATION OF AN 
INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL, WAS PROBLEMATIC -- EVEN IF IT 
PASSED THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL IT WOULD LACK A STRONG 
MANDATE OR ADEQUATE FUNDING. FURTHERMORE, INDONESIA WOULD 
BE UNLIKELY TO COOPERATE WITH A TRIBUNAL AND SUCH A 
PROCESS COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE DILI-JAKARTA 
RELATIONSHIP. 
 
6. (C) RAMOS-HORTA SAID THAT AFTER EXTENSIVE CONSULTATIONS 
IN EAST TIMOR BOTH WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND WITH CIVIL 
SOCIETY, THE TIMORESE WERE PROPOSING A THIRD OPTION: THE 
FORMATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRUTH AND JUSTICE COMMISSION 
(ITJC). IN THIS SCENARIO, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN 
WOULD APPOINT A SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR FOR A THREE-MONTH 
PERIOD TO STUDY THE ISSUE, GIVING THE INDONESIA AD HOC 
TRIBUNAL MORE TIME TO SHOW RESULTS. IF THE AD HOC 
TRIBUNAL FAILED TO ACHIEVE CONVICTIONS, THE RAPPORTEUR 
WOULD RECOMMEND, AND THE SECRETARY-GENERAL WOULD APPROVE, 
THE FORMATION OF AN ITJC WITH THREE-TO-FIVE JUDGES. ONCE 
THE JUDGES ISSUE THEIR REPORT, THE SECURITY COUNCIL WOULD 
APPROVE IT, AND INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES COULD TAKE ACTION 
AGAINST THE ACCUSED AS THEY SEE FIT. EXAMPLES OF PUNITIVE 
ACTION RANGE FROM BILATERAL DEMANDS THAT ACCUSED OFFICERS 
BE FIRED FROM THEIR POSITIONS IN THE INDONESIAN MILITARY, 
TO A SIMPLE VISA BAN. RAMOS-HORTA SAID THAT UN HIGH 
COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS (AND FORMER UN SPECIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE IN EAST TIMOR), SERGIO DE MELLO, LIKED THE 
ITJC IDEA AND WOULD SHORTLY SEND A LETTER TO SECRETARY- 
GENERAL ANNAN SUPPORTING IT. 
 
7. (C) SECRETARY POWELL SAID THAT WE TOO HAD BEEN 
DISAPPOINTED BY THE VERDICTS AT THE AD HOC TRIBUNAL. 
AMBASSADOR PROSPER DESCRIBED THE ITJC PROPOSAL AS 
INTERESTING, AND CREATIVE IN ITS EMPHASIS ON ESTABLISHING 
A PERMANENT RECORD OF TRUTH. HE EXPRESSED OUR WILLINGNESS 
TO IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE WITH THE TIMORESE ON THEIR PROPOSAL. 
 
TIMOR GAP 
---------- 
 
8. (C) GUSMAO SAID THAT THE BAYU-UNDAN OIL AND GAS FIELD 
IN THE TIMOR GAP WOULD BEGIN TO PRODUCE REVENUE IN 2004, 
THOUGH IT WAS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS. 
ESTIMATES RANGE FROM $40 TO $200 MILLION, I.E. MORE THAN 
THE CURRENT NATIONAL BUDGET. GUSMAO SAID THAT THE MUCH 
LARGER SUNRISE FIELD WOULD NOT BE PRODUCTIVE UNTIL 2008, 
AND SINCE NEGOTIATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA FOR A REVENUE- 
SHARING AGREEMENT WERE NOT YET CONCLUDED, HE WOULD 
APPRECIATE THE SECRETARY\'S HELP WITH THE AUSTRALIANS. 
RAMOS-HORTA SAID THE TIMORESE SAW THE TIMOR GAP ISSUE AS 
BIGGER THAN OIL; FOR EXAMPLE, IF AUSTRALIA AGREED TO 
ENFORCE TIMOR\'S EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE, THE TIMORESE 
WOULD GAIN SOME $100 MILLION IN FISHERIES REVENUE 
ANNUALLY. THE SECRETARY OPINED THAT INTERNATIONAL 
ARBITRATION WAS AN OPTION TO CONSIDER, AND MENTIONED THAT 
HE WAS IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH HIS AUSTRALIAN COUNTERPART. 
 
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE 
---------------------- 
 
9. (C) GUSMAO SAID THAT UNTIL THE PETROLEUM INCOME CAME ON 
LINE, EAST TIMOR WOULD NEED SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT 
ASSISTANCE. IN THIS REGARD, HE THANKED THE U.S. FOR OUR 
AID, PARTICULARLY THE DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS, WHICH HE SAID 
WERE HELPFUL IN PROMOTING A \"DEMOCRATIC CONSCIOUSNESS.\" 
GUSMAO SINGLED OUT THE INTERNATIONAL REPUBLICAN AND 
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTES FOR PRAISE, AND NOTED THAT 
THE RECENTLY ARRIVED PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS WERE A DYNAMIC 
GROUP. HE ALSO SAID THAT THE U.S. MILITARY PRESENCE IN 
EAST TIMOR, HOWEVER SMALL, WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED, AND 
ASKED IF THE STATE OR DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS COULD ASSIST 
WITH THE BUILDING OF A MODERN BARRACKS FOR THE EAST TIMOR 
DEFENSE FORCE. 
 
10. (C) THE SECRETARY DID NOT RESPOND TO THE BARRACKS 
REQUEST.

FROM UNDER SECRETARY FOR MANAGEMENT GREEN 
 
1.  PLEASE PROVIDE WIDE DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION 
IN THIS TELEGRAM. 
 
2.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2002, (REFTEL A) I ANNOUNCED A PLAN 
FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW INTEGRATED 
MESSAGING SYSTEM BY 2004 AND INVITED YOUR COMMENTS THROUGH 
A WEBSITE ON OPENNET AND CLASSNET.  USER COMMENTS WERE 
STUDIED AND CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BY A TASK FORCE FROM IRM, 
S/ES, AND A IN DEVELOPING A RECOMMENDATION FOR MY 
CONSIDERATION. 
 
3. ON APRIL 12, 2002 (REFTEL B), WE ANNOUNCED THE 
COMPLETION OF THE WORK OF THE TASK FORCE AND COMMUNICATED 
THE WEB ADDRESS FOR YOUR EXAMINATION OF ITS VISION AND 
OPTIONS.  AGAIN YOUR COMMENTS WERE SOLICITED AND REVIEWED 
ON RECEIPT. 
 
4.  SINCE THEN I HAVE FORMED A STEERING COMMITTEE OF 
SENIOR LEVEL SUBSTANTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL 
REPRESENTATIVES UNDER THE CHAIR OF AMBASSADOR JOE LAKE. 
THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN MEETING BIWEEKLY TO OVERSEE OPTIONS 
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  FOUR WORKING GROUPS ARE REPORTING TO 
THE STEERING COMMITTEE.  ONE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
DEVELOPING A PROTOTYPE AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. THE SECOND 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES IN GOVERNMENT 
AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY.  THE THIRD IS EXAMINING SECURITY 
ISSUES.  AND THE FOURTH, RECENTLY CONVENED, HAS BEGUN TO 
CONSIDER CHANGE MANAGEMENT ISSUES INCLUDING TRAINING. 
AFSA AND AFGE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT 
WORKING GROUP. (WE ARE FORMING A FIFTH WORKING GROUP TO 
OVERSEE THE CONVERGENCE OF THE FASI PROJECT ON KNOWLEDGE 
MANAGEMENT AND INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION WITH THE 
MESSAGING SYSTEM.) 
 
5.  WE HAVE NAMED THE MESSAGING SYSTEM THE STATE MESSAGING 
AND ARCHIVE RETRIEVAL TOOLSET  TO DESCRIBE ITS BREADTH AND 
TO GIVE IT A MEMORABLE ACRONYM: SMART.  (WE RECOGNIZE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR IRONY IF USERS BELIEVE IT TO BE ANYTHING 
LESS.) 
 
6.  THE PROTOTYPE HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND IS SCHEDULED TO 
BE DEMONSTRATED TO THE STEERING COMMITTEE ON OCTOBER 9. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NO DECISIONS HAVE YET BEEN MADE. 
FOR THAT WE AGAIN NEED YOUR INPUT.  PLEASE LOOK AT THE 
DESCRIPTION OF SMART ON THE OPENNET WEBSITE AT 
MESSAGING.IRM.STATE.GOV OR THE CLASS NET WEBSITE AT 
MESSAGING.IRM.STATE.SGOV.GOV AND GIVE US YOUR REACTIONS, 
COMMENTS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS.  WE WOULD WELCOME ANY 
FEEDBACK YOU CAN PROVIDE BEFORE OCTOBER 31. IN THE 
MEANTIME,  THE PROTOTYPE WILL BE EVALUATED BY 500 SELECTED 
USERS FROM OVERSEAS AND WASHINGTON.  THE EVALUATION IS 
BEING CONDUCTED BY  THE E DIPLOMACY TASK FORCE OVERSEEING 
THE WORK OF AN INDEPENDENT FIRM,  THE GARTNER GROUP, TO 
ENSURE OBJECTIVITY. 
 
7.  IMPLEMENTING SMART BY 2004 WILL BE A CONSIDERABLE 
CHALLENGE.  AS IT WILL INCORPORATE AND CONSOLIDATE 
EXISTING MESSAGING SYSTEMS - INCLUDING CABLES, E-MAILS, 
AND MEMORANDA - IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE GET IT RIGHT SO 
THAT IT GIVES YOU BETTER TOOLS WITH WHICH TO DO YOUR WORK. 
INPUT FROM THOSE WHO DO THE WORK WILL BE A KEY FACTOR IN 
OUR DECISION-MAKING.

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  IN THIS REGARD, ALSO STRESSES THE NEED 
TO EXPLORE INNOVATIVE MECHANISMS TO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESS

TAGS: PTER, PREL, EFINM, SY, EUN 
SUBJECT: DESIGNATING HAMAS AND HEZBALLAH: APPROACHING EU 
CAPITALS 
 
REF: STATE 65911 
 
CLASSIFIED BY EUR PDAS CHARLES RIES, E.O. 12958 REASONS 
1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. FOR EU MEMBER CAPITALS: 
THE POINTS AT PARAS TWO AND THREE ARE FOR DELIVERY PRIOR 
TO THE EU FOREIGN MINISTERS\' MEETING ON 12/9 AND 12/10. 
WE UNDERSTAND THE DANISH PRESIDENCY INTENDS TO FOLLOW UP 
ON THIS WEEK\'S DISCUSSION OF FOREIGN TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS AT THE COREPER AND COTER. POSTS MAY ALSO 
WISH TO DRAW UPON THE POINTS PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED IN 
REFTELS (REF A IS AN ORAL MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY 
FOCUSED ON CUTTING OFF HAMAS AND HIZBALLAH FUNDRAISING IN 
EU STATES). FOR NORWAY: GIVEN NORWAY\'S ACTIVE 
INVOLVEMENT IN PROMOTING MIDDLE EAST PEACE, WE ALSO WANT 
TO INCLUDE NORWAY IN THIS DEMARCHE. POST IS WELCOME TO 
TAILOR POINTS AS APPROPRIATE. 
 
2. (S/REL EUMEM AND NORWAY) ACTION ADDRESSEES ARE 
INSTRUCTED TO DRAW ON THE FOLLOWING TALKING POINTS IN 
APPROACHING EU MEMBER CAPITALS AND OSLO.   THE POINTS AT 
PARA THREE MAY BE LEFT AS A NON-PAPER.   BEGIN TALKING 
POINTS: 
 
-- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LISTING OF SEVERAL TERRORIST 
GROUPS WILL BE DISCUSSED AT THE UPCOMING EU FOREIGN 
MINISTERS\' MEETING. EU ACTION ON LISTING THESE GROUPS, 
WHICH IS VITAL TO CURTAILING THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS 
IN EUROPE, WILL ADVANCE OUR MUTUAL INTEREST IN COMBATING 
TERRORISM AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE EU\'S ROLE IN PROMOTING 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE THROUGH THE QUARTET. 
 
-- SUCH ACTION WILL ALSO SERVE THE EU IN ITS BILATERAL 
CONTACTS WITH THE PALESTINIANS AND PARTICULARLY WITH 
ISRAEL, BY REINFORCING EU CREDIBILITY AND DETERMINATION ON 
THE TERRORISM ISSUE. IN 2001, THE EU ITSELF CALLED UPON 
THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY TO \"DISMANTLE THE TERRORIST 
NETWORKS OF HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD, ARREST ALL SUSPECTS, 
AND BRING THEM TO JUSTICE\" IN IT THE EU\'S LAKEN 
DECLARATION. 
 
-- THE EVIDENCE WE ARE PROVIDING SUPPORTS OUR VERY REAL 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO ORGANIZATIONS IN 
PARTICULAR: HIZBALLAH AND HAMAS. AS SECRETARY POWELL 
URGED EARLIER THIS YEAR, \"(C)ITING LEGAL REASONS IN NOT 
MOVING AGAINST (THESE) GROUPS IGNORES KEY MORAL AND 
POLITICAL ISSUES AND SENDS A DANGEROUS SIGNAL . . . . I 
ASK THAT YOU LOOK FOR WAYS TO FREEZE ASSETS AND PREVENT 
THESE GROUPS FROM RAISING FUNDS, INCLUDING THROUGH 
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.\" WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER 
THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY AS YOU EVALUATE THE LISTING OF 
THESE GROUPS AS FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS (FTOS) AND 
IN SHAPING YOUR BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES, SUCH 
AS IRAN AND SYRIA, WHICH SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES. 
 
3. (S/REL EUMEM AND GON) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: 
 
HIZBALLAH 
 
-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS HIZBALLAH A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIONS. WHILE WE 
DON\'T OPPOSE HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, 
 
IT IS NOT CREDIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A                       - 
TERRORIST/OPERATIONAL WING OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND A 
POLICY/POLITICAL WING.   TO TRY TO DO SO IS A WHOLELY 
ARTIFICIAL EXERCISE AS HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP OF BOTH IS 
ONE AND THE SAME. 
 
-- THE NOVEMBER 29, 2002 STATEMENT OF HIZBALLAH SECRETARY 
GENERAL HASSAN NASRALLAH CALLING FOR PALESTINIANS TO 
UNDERTAKE SUICIDE BOMBINGS WORLDWIDE UNDERLINES THE GLOBAL 
REACH OF THIS ORGANIZATION, THE INSEPERABLE NATURE OF ITS 
POLITICAL AND OPERATIONAL WINGS, AND THE DESTABILIZING 
IMPACT IT HAS ON THE REGION. 
 
-- WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETERMINATION AND ABILITY 
OF HIZBALLAH TO MOUNT TERRORIST OPERATIONS. THESE 
ACTIVITIES HAVE A DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST REGION AND UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO 
ESTABLISH CONDITIONS WHEREBY MEANINGFUL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
CAN RESUME. 
 
-- HIZBALLAH CONTINUES TO RECEIVE WEAPONS FROM IRAN. WE 
ARE CONCERNED THIS CONTINUED RE-SUPPLY INCREASES THE 
LIKELIHOOD THAT HIZBALLAH WILL ACQUIRE LONGER-RANGE AND 
MORE ADVANCED ROCKETS OR MISSILES. THE GROWING STOCKPILE 
MAY LIKEWISE ENHANCE HIZBALLAH\'S PERCEPTION OF ITS 
DETERRENT CAPACITY AND EMBOLDEN IT TO INCREASE BORDER 
ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL. 
 
-- THE FINANCIAL, TRAINING, AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT THAT 
HIZBALLAH AND IRAN PROVIDE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS ALSO 
GENERATES SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: 
 
- HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN REVOLUTIONARY GUARD (IRGC) 
PERSONNEL HAVE CONDUCTED WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES TRAINING 
FOR MEMBERS OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN THE BEKAA VALLEY AND 
IN IRAN BEFORE SENDING THEM BACK INTO THE PALESTINIAN 
TERRITORIES 
 
  - HIZBALLAH COORDINATED THE MARCH 12 ATTACK AT SHLOMI IN 
  NORTHERN ISRAEL, IN WHICH SIX ISRAELIS WERE KILLED, 
  INCLUDING FOUR CIVILIANS. 
 
   - HIZBALLAH IS LIKEWISE WORKING TO INFILTRATE ITS OWN 
   OPERATIVES INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO FACILITATE 
   PALESTINIAN ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS. AN OPERATIVE (A 
   SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN) ARRESTED IN HEBRON LAST SUMMER 
   BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICE WAS TRAINED IN LEBANON 
   AND SENT TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO ENHANCE 
   PALESTINIAN BOMB PRODUCTION AND HELP PLAN ATTACKS. 

   - HIZBALLAH COOPERATED WITH FATAH PALESTINIANS ON THE 
   JANUARY 2002 KARINE A SHIPMENT. THE SHIP WAS CARRYING 
   ROUGHLY 50 TONS OF MOSTLY IRANIAN-MADE WEAPONS - SUCH AS 
   BATTLEFIELD ROCKETS, NUMEROUS LIGHT AND ANTI-TANK 
   MISSILES, MORTARS, MINES, EXPLOSIVES, AND SMALL ARMS AND 
   MUNITIONS. 
 
   - IN MAY 2001, THE PFLP-GC, WITH HIZBALLAH\'S ASSISTANCE, 
   ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE 45 SEALED BARRELS OF ARMS BY SEA 
   FROM LEBANON TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. PRESS 
   REPORTS AT THE TIME OF SEIZURE STATED THAT INTERROGATION 
   OF THE CREW SHOWED THE SAME SHIP HAD MADE THREE EARLIER 
   DELIVERIES TO GAZA. 
 
-- HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP HAS CALLED ON ARAB LEADERS TO 
PROVIDE \"SERIOUS\" MONEY AND WEAPONS TO THE PALESTINIANS. 
IN AN INTERVIEW IN MARCH WITH THE LONDON SUNDAY TIMES, THE 
GENERAL SECRETARY OF HIZBALLAH, HASSAN NASRALLAH, ALSO 
ADMITTED THAT THREE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY 
THE JORDANIANS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE A NUMBER OF 
KATYUSHA ROCKETS TO PALESTINIAN FACTIONS. 
 
-- THE EFFECT SUCH SUPPORT AND COORDINATION COULD HAVE ON 
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL IS 
CLEARLY WORRISOME. INCREASED IRANIAN FUNDING AND WEAPONS, 
ALONG WITH TRAINING PROVIDED BY BOTH IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED LETHALITY OF THE CURRENT 
INTIFADA. BY NASRALLAH\'S OWN ADMISSION, BROADCAST ON 
BEIRUT TELEVISION NOVEMBER 26, HIZBALLAH IS \"STRONGER 
TODAY THAN IT WAS AT THE TIME\" OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF 
ISRAELI TROOPS FROM LEBANON IN 2000. NASRALLAH HAS 
REPEATEDLY AND PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF 
ISRAEL. 
 
 
HAMAS 
 
-- WHILE SOME NATIONS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL 
WING, INCLUDING ITS FUNDRAISING ARM AND ARRAY OF SOCIAL 
SERVICES, AND IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, ITS OPERATIONAL 
BRANCH, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS 
APPROPRIATE TO DO SO BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE 
UNITED STATES VIEWS HAMAS AS A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION WITH 
UNIFIED GOALS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE 
STATE OF ISRAEL. 
 
     - HAMAS POLITICAL LEADERS OPENLY LOBBY FOR THE 
     \"LIQUIDATION\" OF ISRAEL THROUGH VIOLENCE, AS 
     POLITICAL BUREAU CHIEF KHALID MISHA\'AL DID IN TEHRAN 
     ON APRIL 24, 2001. HAMAS SPOKESMAN MOUSA ABU MARZOUK 
     VOWED HAMAS WOULD \"STEP UP ITS GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST 
     ISRAEL\" AND THIS SUMMER ADMITTED ON THE U.S. 
     TELEVISION SHOW \"60 MINUTES\" THAT HAMAS WAS 
     DEVELOPING, IN GAZA, ADVANCED ROCKETS TO STRIKE 
     TARGETS INSIDE ISRAEL PROPER. DR. ABDEL RANTISI, 
     ANOTHER PROMINENT HAMAS POLITICAL OFFICIAL, SAID 
     SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE \"THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR 
     US.\" RANTISI PUBLICLY ADMITS THAT IZZ AL-DIN AL- 
     QASSAM INITIATES ATTACKS BASED ON CUES HEARD IN 
     PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY HAMAS POLITICAL FIGURES. 
 
     - IN A MAY 2002 STATEMENT POSTED ON A PROMINENT 
     ARABIC INTERNET SITE, HAMAS MILITARY LEADER SALAH 
     SHIHADA, SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED IN AN ISRAELI TARGETED 
     OPERATION THIS FALL, SAID THAT HAMAS\' \"POLITICAL 
     APPARATUS IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE MILITARY APPARATUS, 
     AND A DECISION OF THE POLITICAL [ECHELON] TAKES 
     PRECEDENCE OVER THE DECISION OF THE MILITARY 
     [ECHELON], WITHOUT INTERVENING IN MILITARY 
     OPERATIONS.\" 
 
     - IN AUGUST 2002, HAMAS\' GAZA-BASED SPIRITUAL LEADER 
     AHMAD YASIN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, \"WHEN WE [HAMAS] 
     MAKE DECISIONS ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND CONVEY THEM 
     TO THE MILITARY WING, IT ABIDES BY IT NORMALLY.\" 
 
-- PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) LEADERS TELL US HAMAS 
\"POLITICAL\" LEADERS ARE COMPLICATING THEIR EFFORTS TO 
LIMIT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS.   IN JANUARY 2002, A 
PROMINENT ARAB NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT PA LEADERS HAD 
ASKED SYRIA-BASED HAMAS LEADERS IMAD AL-ALAMI, MARZUK AND 
MISHA\'AL TO STOP \"POURING OIL ON THE FIRE\" BY ARMING AND 
FUNDING CELLS IN THE WEST BANK. THE SAME NEWSPAPER 
REPORTED IN JUNE 2002 THAT AL-ALAMI HAD MET WITH 
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, HIZBALLAH AND AL-QAEDA 
REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS CONDUCTING \"MAJOR MARTYRDOM 
OPERATIONS.\" 
 
-- HAMAS\' NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORTS THE 
VIOLENT POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, BOTH 
FINANCIALLY AND THROUGH EFFORTS FURTHERING INDOCTRINATION. 
 
     - HAMAS IS SUSPECTED OF DERIVING A LARGE PERCENTAGE 
     OF ITS REVENUE FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE GULF 
     REGION, THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE. THESE 
     FINANCES UNDERMINE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BY 
     PROMOTING HAMAS\' PROPAGANDA AND FACILITATING THE 
     RECRUITMENT AND INDOCTRINATION OF HAMAS ACTIVISTS. 
     SOME OF THESE FUNDS MAY ALSO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF 
     \"MARTYRS\" AND THE EXECUTION OF TERRORIST OPERATIONS. 
 
-- HAMAS CENTERS ITS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY IN THE 
IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. THERE IT 
OPENLY MAINTAINS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS 
SERVICES, RAISES MONEY, ORGANIZES ACTIVITIES, DISTRIBUTES 
PROPAGANDA AND RECRUITS MEMBERS. SOME RECRUITS ARE 
CLANDESTINELY TRAINED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS FOR SERVICE 
WITHIN IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST WING. 
HAMAS\' STRONG INFLUENCE IN MANY PALESTINIAN MOSQUES, 
SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CLUBS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
ATTEMPTS TO INDOCTRINATE THE PALESTINIAN CONSTITUENCY WITH 
ITS VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ITS YOUTH, AND PROVIDES 
RELIGIOUS SANCTION TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS. 
 
     - HAMAS \"POLITICAL\" LEADER MISHA\'AL ON NOVEMBER 16, 
     2000 WAS QUOTED IN THE ARAB DAILY AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
     AS SAYING, \"HAMAS IS A JIHAD MOVEMENT THAT SERVES THE 
     PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE CURRENT INTIFADA. 
     EVERYTHING HAMAS OWNS IS USED IN THIS BATTLE.\" 
 
-- HAMAS POSES AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE 
PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHICH THE UNITED STATES 
VIEWS AS CRITICAL TO ITS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY, 
AND/OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, THROUGH THE INCITEMENT OF 
TERRORISM AND OVERT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES: 
 
     - THE UNITED STATES HAS INFORMATION INDICATING THAT 
     HAMAS\' POLITICAL BUREAU OFTEN HAS FOREKNOWLEDGE OF, 
     IS LINKED TO, AND/OR PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR THE 
     OPERATIONS OF IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM AGAINST ISRAELI 
     TARGETS.   MOST RECENTLY, HAMAS CLAIMED 
     RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JULY 2002 BOMBING AT 
     JERUSALEM\'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY THAT KILLED FOUR 
     ISRAELIS AND FIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE MARCH 
     2002 SUICIDE BOMBINGS THAT KILLED 25 ISRAELIS ON 
     PASSOVER NIGHT IN NETANYA, ISRAEL, AND 15 ISRAELIS AT 
     A HAIFA CAFE THE SAME WEEK. SIMILARLY DEVASTATING 
     ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2001, SUCH AS THE JUNE 1 
     BOMBING OF A TEL AVIV NIGHTCLUB THAT KILLED 22 
     ISRAELI TEENAGERS, AND THE AUGUST 9 SUICIDE ATTACK ON 
     A JERUSALEM PIZZERIA IN WHICH 15 CIVILIANS DIED. 
     AMERICAN CITIZENS AND OTHER NON-ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN 
     KILLED AND INJURED IN THESE AND OTHER ATTACKS. HAMAS 
     SPOKESMEN, INCLUDING PURPORTED \"POLITICAL\" LEADERS, 
     CATEGORIZE THESE OPERATIONS AS \"SELF-DEFENSE\" - PART 
     OF ITS DECLARED POLICY TO CREATE A \"BALANCE OF 
     TERROR\" WITH ISRAEL. 
 
-- HAMAS IS ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND ITS 
AFFILIATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN 
INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND: 
 
     - HAMAS OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. FOR 
     PURPOSES OF TRAINING, FUND-RAISING AND CONSULTING 
     WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND OTHER TERRORISTS 
 
     ORGANIZATIONS, HAMAS IS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE A 
     PRESENCE IN IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, SAUDI ARABIA, 
     SUDAN, YEMEN AND SYRIA (IT MAINTAINS ITS HEADQUARTERS 
     IN DAMASCUS). FOUR OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE LISTED BY 
     THE USG AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM.   HAMAS IS 
     ALSO ACTIVE IN OTHER NATIONS.   FURTHER, HAMAS MAY 
     ASPIRE TO DESTABILIZE THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IN 
     THE EVENT OF ARAFAT\'S DEATH. 
 
     - HAMAS IS BELIEVED TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER FOREIGN 
     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OF GLOBAL REACH, INCLUDING 
     HIZBALLAH. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HAMAS AND 
     HIZBALLAH HAVE COOPERATED ON WEAPONS ENHANCEMENT AND 
     DEVELOPMENT FOR USE WITHIN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN 
     TERRITORIES. HAMAS IS ALSO KNOWN TO MAINTAIN CLOSE 
     TIES WITH IRAN. HAMAS\' AFFILIATION WITH THESE 
     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH ARE TOGETHER 
     RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN 
     CITIZENS, AND IRAN (A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM) 
     CONSTITUTES A GROWING THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN 
     INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND.

SUBJECT: A/S KELLY DISCUSSES KOREA, BILATERAL RELATIONS 
WITH PRC AMBASSADOR YANG JIECHI 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: EAP A/S JAMES A. KELLY; REASONS 1.5 B, D. 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (C) A/S KELLY BRIEFED AMBASSADOR YANG JIECHI JANUARY 9 ON 
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA, PREVIEWED 
HIS UPCOMING TRIP TO THE REGION AND DISCUSSED OVERALL 
BILATERAL RELATIONS.  ON KOREA, KELLY STRESSED U.S. TACTICAL 
FLEXIBILITY IN FOCUSING ON OUR KEY OBJECTIVE, WHICH WAS TO 
STOP THE DPRK NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  HE WELCOMED CONTINUING 
COOPERATION ON CHINA\'S PART TOWARD THAT END AND PROMISED TO 
BRIEF ON HIS SEOUL TALKS WHEN HE VISITS BEIJING NEXT WEEK. 
ON BILATERAL ISSUES, AMB. YANG PRAISED THE TEMPO OF 
U.S.-CHINA EXCHANGES IN THE COMING MONTHS WHILE REPEATING 
FAMILIAR CONCERNS ABOUT TAIWAN.  YANG RAISED CONCERN ABOUT 
FALUNGONG LEGAL ACTIONS AGAINST JIANG ZEMIN IN THE U.S. AND 
WE RESPONDED WITH OUR OWN CONCERNS ABOUT HARSH JUDICIAL 
TREATMENT OF FALUNGONG ADHERENTS IN CHINA.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) AMBASSADOR YANG INVITED A/S KELLY TO BREAKFAST TO 
DISCUSS KOREA AND BILATERAL ISSUES ON JANUARY 9. COUNSELORS 
DENG HONGBO AND XIAO QIAN FROM THE CHINESE EMBASSY 
PARTICIPATED, AS DID EAP/CM DIRECTOR YOUNG (NOTETAKER). 
 
------------------- 
DISCUSSION OF KOREA 
------------------- 
 
3.  (C) A/S KELLY BEGAN BY NOTING THE SECRETARY WAS PLEASED 
WITH HIS PHONE CALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO FM TANG JIAXUAN. 
THEY HAD A GOOD EXCHANGE ON KOREA AND BILATERAL RELATIONS. 
THE TWO HAVE BUILT A RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST AND RESPECT OVER 
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT HAS PROVEN MOST HELPFUL IN 
RECENT MONTHS.  YANG WARMLY AGREED WITH THIS ASSESSMENT.  IN 
RESPONSE TO YANG\'S QUERY, A/S KELLY MADE CLEAR WE ARE 
PREPARED TO HAVE SOME INTERACTION WITH PYONGYANG IN 
CONNECTION WITH STEPS BY THE NORTH TO END THEIR ENRICHED 
URANIUM PROGRAM AND BACK AWAY FROM REPROCESSING SPENT FUEL 
FROM THE YONGBYON REACTOR, RATHER THAN INSISTING THAT ALL 
THIS BE DONE BEFORE TALKS BEGIN.  THE KEY POINT WAS TO BRING 
THE DPRK NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM TO AN END IN ALL ITS 
ASPECTS.  NORTH KOREA WOULD WANT TO BRING OTHER ISSUES TO 
THIS DIALOGUE, YANG OBSERVED.  AS TO THE NATURE OF ANY 
POSSIBLE SECURITY ASSURANCES, A/S KELLY NOTED OUR CITATION IN 
THE TCOG JOINT STATEMENT OF THE 1991 KOREAN BASIC AGREEMENT 
AND THE DENUCLEARIZATION DECLARATION.  WE WERE PREPARED TO 
DRAW FROM THIS AND OTHER FORMULATIONS IN CONSIDERING THE 
NORTH\'S DESIRE FOR SECURITY ASSURANCES.  WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED 
BY THE IAEA\'S ROLE IN ALL THIS.  IF WE EXPERIENCE PROGRESS ON 
OUR CORE OBJECTIVES WITH THE NORTH, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO 
RUSH THE IAEA DECISON-MAKING PROCESS TO THE POINT OF THEIR 
TAKING THE ISSUE TO THE UNSC. 

4.  (C) AMB. YANG ASKED IF THE U.S. HAD RECEIVED ANY REACTION 
FROM THE NORTH TO ITS LATEST PROPOSAL ON CONTACTS.  A/S KELLY 
INDICATED THAT A CRYPTIC BUT WORTHWHILE RESPONSE FROM THE 
DPRK HAD BEEN RECEIVED.  YANG PRAISED PRESIDENT BUSH\'S 
STATEMENT CONCERNING NORTH KOREA.  PYONGYANG IS DEEPLY 
ANXIOUS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A MILITARY THREAT.  HE WAS 
NOT PASSING JUDGMENT ON THIS, MERELY OBSERVING THE FACTS. 
YANG ASKED IF THE U.S. MIGHT BE WILLING TO PROVIDE WRITTEN 
SECURITY ASSURANCES TO THE NORTH AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT 
PLEDGES TO DO WHAT WE WANT ON ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM.  A/S KELLY 
INDICATED THAT WE REMAINED FLEXIBLE IN HOW WE GOT TO OUR 
ULTIMATE GOAL OF A NONNUCLEAR KOREA.  THE SOUTH\'S PERSPECTIVE 
WAS IMPORTANT HERE.  SEOUL DOES NOT WANT TO FACE A 
NUCLEAR-ARMED NORTH, WHICH WOULD PUT IT AT A MAJOR MILITARY 
DISADVANTAGE.  JAPAN AND COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST WERE 
ALSO QUITE CONCERNED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF A NUCLEAR DPRK. 
 
5.  (C) YANG INQUIRED ABOUT ROK NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
YIM\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  A/S KELLY INDICATED THAT YIM HAD 
GOTTEN INTO MORE SPECIFICS THAN WERE COVERED BY DEPUTY FM LEE 
DURING THE TCOG TALKS.  YIM WAS REFLECTING KIM DAE-JUNG\'S 
DESIRE TO MANAGE THE REMAINING SEVEN WEEKS OF HIS 
ADMINISTRATION EFFECTIVELY AS REGARDS THIS PROBLEM.  YIM HAD 
SEEN SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RUMSFELD, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR 
RICE AND OTHERS.  YANG ASKED ABOUT THE TIMING OF MR. KELLY\'S 
TRIP TO SOUTH KOREA.  A/S KELLY CLARIFIED THAT THIS TRIP HAD 
BEEN LONG PLANNED AS A CHANCE TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEXT 
ADMINISTRATION\'S NEW TEAM, LED BY PRESIDENT-ELECT ROH 
MOO-HYUN.  NATURALLY HE WILL DISCUSS LATEST DEVELOPMENTS WITH 
OUR ALLIES IN SEOUL.  HE WOULD STAND READY TO BRIEF THE 
CHINESE ABOUT HIS TALKS IN SOUTH KOREA WHEN HE TRAVELS ON TO 
BEIJING NEXT WEDNESDAY.  MR. KELLY LOOKED FORWARD TO GOOD 
EXCHANGES ON KOREA THERE.  HE WAS TRYING TO MEET PEOPLE FROM 
THE PARTY\'S INTERNATIONAL DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FAMILIAR 
INTERLOCUTERS IN THE MFA.  IN PARTICULAR HE INTENDED TO 
STRESS THE SERIOUSNESS OF NORTH KOREA\'S THREAT TO REPROCESS 
SPENT FUEL, WHICH COULD YIELD A GREAT DEAL OF WEAPONS-GRADE 
MATERIAL IN A MATTER OF MONTHS.  AMB. YANG SAID HIS 
GOVERNMENT WELCOMED THIS OPPORTUNITY. 
 
------------------- 
BILATERAL RELATIONS 
------------------- 
 
6.  (C) YANG THEN TURNED THE DISCUSSION TO BILATERAL 
RELATIONS.  REHEARSING UPCOMING VISITS TO CHINA BY MR. KELLY, 
U/S BOLTON AND POLICY PLANNER HAASS, YANG WELCOMED THIS TREND 
TOWARD MORE EXCHANGES.  A/S KELLY RESPONDED THAT WE WERE 
DOING OUR PART.  USTR\'S ZOELLICK WOULD BE GOING OUT IN 
MID-FEBRUARY TO DISCUSS TRADE ISSUES.  THE VICE PRESIDENT\'S 
ADVANCE TEAM WAS ALSO GOING AFTER THE LUNAR NEW YEAR. 
AMBASSADOR FRANK TAYLOR, NOW ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR 
DIPLOMATIC SECURITY, WAS INTERESTED IN GOING TO BEIJING TO 
CLEAR UP REMAINING ISSUES IN OUR PROPERTY NEGOTIATION (THE 
COCA TALKS) AND MR. KELLY HOPED THE CHINESE SIDE WOULD 
WELCOME THIS VISIT.  AMB. TAYLOR\'S REPLACEMENT AS 
COUNTER-TERRORISM COORDINATOR, COFER BLACK, WAS ALSO 
INTERESTED IN VISITING TO CONTINUE TALKS ON U.S.-CHINA 
COOPERATION IN THIS AREA.  AMB. YANG PROMISED TO INFORM 
BEIJING OF THESE LAST TWO VISITORS, ADDING THAT \"WE SHOULD 
BREAK THE DEADLOCK\" ON OUR EMBASSY CONSTRUCTION NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
7.  (C) YANG INDICATED THAT BEIJING WOULD WELCOME A VISIT 
NEXT MONTH BY THE SECRETARY.  A/S KELLY REITERATED THAT THE 
SECRETARY WOULD LIKE TO COME, IF HE IS ABLE TO GET OUT OF 
WASHINGTON TO ATTEND THE SOUTH KOREAN INAUGURATION IN LATE 
FEBRUARY.  IF THE SECRETARY VISITED BEIJING, HE COULD SEE FM 
TANG, VICE PREMIER QIAN AND OTHER CHINESE LEADERS AS 
APPROPRIATE.  YANG ASSURED US THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD WORK 
HARD TO MAKE SUCH A VISIT A SUCCESS. 
 
8.  (8) TURNING TO TAIWAN, YANG REITERATED FAMILIAR CHINESE 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE U.S.-TAIWAN BUSINESS COUNCIL MEETING 
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN SAN ANTONIO IN FEBRUARY.  BEIJING 
WAS PARTICULARLY WORRIED THAT TAIWAN DEFENSE MINISTER TANG 
YAO-MING MIGHT ATTEND, AS WELL AS SENIOR USG OFFICIALS. 
CHINA WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN TAIWAN\'S HAN 
KUANG EXERCISE.  PRESIDENT BUSH WAS OBLIGED TO RESPOND TO 
CONGRESS ACCORDING TO LANGUAGE IN THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 
BILL ON THE FEASIBILITY OF VARIOUS DEFENSE PROGRAMS WITH 
CHINA.  IF THESE ISSUES COULD BE SATISFACTORILY RESOLVED, 
YANG CONCLUDED, WE COULD MOVE ON TO MORE PRODUCTIVE ISSUES. 
A/S KELLY REPEATED THAT OUR POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN HAD NOT 
CHANGED, AND THAT WE EMPHASIZED CONSISTENCY IN SUCH ISSUES. 
 
9.  (C) YANG THEN RAISED THE FALUNGONG CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT 
JIANG ZEMIN IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS DISTRICT COURT.  ACCORDING 
TO THEIR INFORMATION, THERE WOULD BE A HEARING ON JANUARY 13. 
 THE PRC WAS STILL VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF 
THIS CASE TO DAMAGE U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS, YANG INDICATED. 
WHILE BEIJING APPRECIATED THE U.S. LEGAL SUBMISSION TO THE 
COURT, IT HOPED WE COULD DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THE CASE WAS 
DISMISSED.  YOUNG USED THIS OCCASION TO RAISE PRESS REPORTS 
THAT CHINA HAD RECENTLY SENTENCED FOUR FALUNGONG ADHERENTS IN 
XINING, QINGHAI TO SENTENCES OF UP TO TWENTY YEARS FOR THEIR 
ATTEMPTS TO INTERRUPT CHINESE TELEVISION BROADCASTS WITH 
PRO-FALUNGONG TAPES.  WHILE THE U.S. ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH 
ACTIVITIES ARE ILLEGAL, THE HARSH SENTENCES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY 
TRIGGER PROTESTS HERE IN THE U.S. OVER THIS DRACONIAN 
TREATMENT OF FALUNGONG IN CHINA.  A/S KELLY SECONDED THIS 
CONCERN. 
 
10.  (C) CONCLUDING THIS REVIEW OF BILATERAL RELATIONS, A/S 
KELLY SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO A VIGOROUS SET OF EXCHANGES 
IN THE COMING MONTHS.  A/S CRANER HAD BEEN PLEASED BY HIS 
TALKS IN BEIJING AND XINJIANG.  THE GENEVA HUMAN RIGHTS 
CONFERENCE WAS COMING UP, BUT IT WAS STILL TOO EARLY TO 
PREDICT HOW THAT WOULD TURN OUT.  YANG AGREED ON THE 
IMPORTANCE OF MORE EXCHANGES, AND HOPED THAT 
MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONS WOULD REFLECT THIS SPIRIT AS 
WELL.  YOUNG INDICATED THAT OSD WAS WORKING ON THE CHINESE 
PROPOSALS LAID OUT BY GENERAL XIONG GUANGKAI DURING LAST 
MONTH\'S DEFENSE CONSULTATIVE TALKS. 
 
11.  (C) RETURNING TO KOREA, AMB. YANG EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN 
OVER ITEMS IN THE U.S. PRESS HE HAD SEEN THAT SUGGESTED CHINA 
WAS \"SITTING ON THE FENCE,\" NOT DOING ENOUGH TO COOPERATE ON 
KOREA, OR HAD EVEN IN THE PAST ASSISTED PYONGYANG\'S NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM.  HE ASSURED A/S KELLY THAT CHINA SHARED THE SAME 
GOALS AS THE U.S.  WHILE NOTING THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME 
REGRETTABLE PAST HISTORY INVOLVING CHINA, PAKISTAN AND NORTH 
KOREA, A/S KELLY SAID THAT WAS NOW BEHIND US.  HE AGREED WITH 
YANG\'S LAST COMMENT, ADDING THAT BOTH OF US WANT TO PREVENT 
THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO NORTH KOREA. 
SPEAKING FRANKLY, YANG CONCLUDED, SOME OF BEIJING\'S ACTIONS 
DO NOT SIT WELL WITH ITS \"CLOSE NEIGHBOR\" (I.E. NORTH KOREA), 
BUT THE FACT WAS THE PRC IS STILL COMMITTED TO MAKING THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA NUCLEAR FREE.

TAGS: PTER, PREL, SY 
SUBJECT: NONPAPER FOR RUSSIAN USE WITH SYRIAN VP KHADDAM: 
HAMAS AND HEZBALLAH 
 
CLASSIFIED BY NEA A/S BILL BURNS, E.O. 12958 REASONS 1.5 
(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST. SYRIAN VP KHADDAM WILL 
BE VISITING MOSCOW NEXT WEEK. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH RUSSIAN 
COUNTERPARTS IN WASHINGTON, THE USG HAS REQUESTED THAT THE 
GOR RAISE SYRIA\'S CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS HAMAS AND HIZBALLAH.   POST IS 
REQUESTED TO PROVIDE THE POINTS AT PARA TWO WITH 
APPROPRIATE GOR OFFICIALS. THE POINTS AT PARA THREE MAY 
BE LEFT AS A NONPAPER. THESE POINTS ARE NOT/NOT 
RELEASABLE TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT. 
 
2. (S/REL RUSSIA) BEGIN POINTS: 
 
-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS SYRIA A STATE SPONSOR OF 
TERRORISM, DUE PRIMARILY TO ITS HOSTING OF CERTAIN 
PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS SUCH AS HAMAS, THE 
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD (PIJ), THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
 
 LIBERATION OF PALESTINE (PFLP), AND THE POPULAR FRONT FOR 
 THE LIBERATION OF PALESTINE - GENERAL COMMAND (PFLP-GC). 
 WE ARE CONCERNED AS WELL BY DAMASCUS\' CLOSE RELATIONSHIP 
 AND SUPPORT FOR HIZBALLAH. 
 
 -- THE EVIDENCE WE ARE PROVIDING YOU TODAY SUPPORTS OUR 
VERY REAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF TWO 
 ORGANIZATIONS IN PARTICULAR: HIZBALLAH AND HAMAS.      WE 
HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION CAREFULLY AND 
 IN SHAPING YOUR BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIES, SUCH 
AS IRAN AND SYRIA, WHICH SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES AND THAT 
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS WILL DRAW ON THESE POINTS DURING THEIR 
MEETINGS NEXT WEEK WITH SYRIAN VP KHADDAM. 
 
END POINTS. 
 
3. (S/REL RUSSIA) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER: 
 
HIZBALLAH 
--------- 
 
-- THE UNITED STATES CONSIDERS HIZBALLAH A TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, ENGAGED IN TERRORIST ACTIONS. WHILE WE 
DON\'T OPPOSE HIZBALLAH\'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES, 
IT IS NOT CREDIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A 
TERRORIST/OPERATIONAL WING OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND A 
POLICY/POLITICAL WING. TO TRY TO DO SO IS A WHOLELY 
ARTIFICIAL EXERCISE AS HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP OF BOTH 
WINGS IS ONE AND THE SAME. 
 
-- WE REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE DETERMINATION AND ABILITY 
OF HIZBALLAH TO MOUNT TERRORIST OPERATIONS. THESE 
ACTIVITIES HAVE A DESTABILIZING EFFECT ON THE ENTIRE 
MIDDLE EAST REGION AND UNDERMINE INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO 
ESTABLISH CONDITIONS WHEREBY MEANINGFUL PEACE NEGOTIATIONS 
CAN RESUME. 
 
-- HIZBALLAH CONTINUES TO RECEIVE WEAPONS FROM IRAN. WE 
ARE CONCERNED THIS CONTINUED RE-SUPPLY INCREASES THE 
LIKELIHOOD THAT HIZBALLAH WILL ACQUIRE LONGER-RANGE AND 
MORE ADVANCED ROCKETS OR MISSILES. THE GROWING STOCKPILE 
MAY LIKEWISE ENHANCE HIZBALLAH\'S PERCEPTION OF ITS 
DETERRENT CAPACITY AND EMBOLDEN IT TO INCREASE BORDER 
ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL. 
 
 -- THE FINANCIAL, TRAINING, AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT THAT 
HIZBALLAH AND IRAN PROVIDE TO PALESTINIAN TERRORISTS ALSO 
GENERATES SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: 
 
   - HIZBALLAH AND IRANIAN ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 
    (IRGC) PERSONNEL HAVE CONDUCTED WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES 
   TRAINING FOR MEMBERS OF PALESTINIAN GROUPS IN THE BEKAA 
   VALLEY AND IN IRAN BEFORE SENDING THEM BACK INTO THE 
   PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES 
 
   - HIZBALLAH COORDINATED THE MARCH 12 ATTACK AT SHLOMI IN 
   NORTHERN ISRAEL, IN WHICH SIX ISRAELIS WERE KILLED, 
   INCLUDING FOUR CIVILIANS. 
 
   - HIZBALLAH IS LIKEWISE WORKING TO INFILTRATE ITS OWN 
   OPERATIVES INTO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO FACILITATE 
   PALESTINIAN ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAELIS. AN OPERATIVE (A 
   SHIA OF LEBANESE ORIGIN) ARRESTED IN HEBRON LAST SUMMER 
   BY THE ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICE WAS TRAINED IN LEBANON 
   AND SENT TO THE WEST BANK AND GAZA TO ENHANCE 
   PALESTINIAN BOMB PRODUCTION AND HELP PLAN ATTACKS. 
 
   - HIZBALLAH COOPERATED WITH FATAH PALESTINIANS ON THE 
   JANUARY 2002 KARINE A SHIPMENT. THE SHIP WAS CARRYING 
   ROUGHLY 50 TONS OF MOSTLY IRANIAN-MADE WEAPONS - SUCH AS 
   BATTLEFIELD ROCKETS, NUMEROUS LIGHT AND ANTI-TANK 
   MISSILES, MORTARS, MINES, EXPLOSIVES, AND SMALL ARMS AND 
   MUNITIONS. 
 
   - IN MAY 2001, THE PFLP-GC, WITH HIZBALLAH\'S ASSISTANCE, 
   ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE 45 SEALED BARRELS OF ARMS BY SEA 
   FROM LEBANON TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY. PRESS 
   REPORTS AT THE TIME OF SEIZURE STATED THAT INTERROGATION 
   OF THE CREW SHOWED THE SAME SHIP HAD MADE THREE EARLIER 
   DELIVERIES TO GAZA. 
 
-- HIZBALLAH\'S LEADERSHIP HAS CALLED ON ARAB LEADERS TO 
PROVIDE \"SERIOUS\" MONEY AND WEAPONS TO THE PALESTINIANS. 
IN AN INTERVIEW IN MARCH WITH THE LONDON SUNDAY TIMES, THE 
GENERAL SECRETARY OF HIZBALLAH, HASSAN NASRALLAH, ALSO 
ADMITTED THAT THREE HIZBALLAH MEMBERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY 
 
THE JORDANIANS AS THEY ATTEMPTED TO SMUGGLE A NUMBER OF 
KATYUSHA ROCKETS TO PALESTINIAN FACTIONS. 
 
-- THE EFFECT SUCH SUPPORT AND COORDINATION COULD HAVE ON 
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL IS 
CLEARLY WORRISOME. INCREASED IRANIAN FUNDING AND WEAPONS, 
ALONG WITH TRAINING PROVIDED BY BOTH IRAN AND HIZBALLAH, 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED LETHALITY OF THE CURRENT 
INTIFADA. BY NASRALLAH\'S OWN ADMISSION, BROADCAST ON 
BEIRUT TELEVISION NOVEMBER 26, HIZBALLAH IS \"STRONGER 
TODAY THAN IT WAS AT THE TIME\" OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF 
ISRAELI TROOPS FROM LEBANON IN 2000. NASRALLAH HAS 
REPEATEDLY AND PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF 
ISRAEL. 
 
HAMAS 
----- 
 
-- WHILE SOME NATIONS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HAMAS\' POLITICAL 
WING, INCLUDING ITS FUNDRAISING ARM AND ARRAY OF SOCIAL 
SERVICES, AND IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, ITS OPERATIONAL 
BRANCH, THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS 
APPROPRIATE TO DO SO BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE 
UNITED STATES VIEWS HAMAS AS A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION WITH 
UNIFIED GOALS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE 
STATE OF ISRAEL. 
 
     - HAMAS POLITICAL LEADERS OPENLY LOBBY FOR THE 
     \"LIQUIDATION\" OF ISRAEL THROUGH VIOLENCE, AS 
     POLITICAL BUREAU CHIEF KHALID MISHA\'AL DID IN TEHRAN 
     ON APRIL 24, 2001. HAMAS SPOKESMAN MOUSA ABU MARZOUK 
     VOWED HAMAS WOULD \"STEP UP ITS GUERRILLA WAR AGAINST 
     ISRAEL\" AND THIS SUMMER ADMITTED ON THE U.S. 
     TELEVISION SHOW \"60 MINUTES\" THAT HAMAS WAS 
     DEVELOPING, IN GAZA, ADVANCED ROCKETS TO STRIKE 
     TARGETS INSIDE ISRAEL PROPER. DR. ABDEL RANTISI, 
     ANOTHER PROMINENT HAMAS POLITICAL OFFICIAL, SAID 
     SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE \"THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR 
     US.\" RANTISI PUBLICLY ADMITS THAT IZZ AL-DIN AL- 
     QASSAM INITIATES ATTACKS BASED ON CUES HEARD IN 
     PUBLIC STATEMENTS MADE BY HAMAS POLITICAL FIGURES. 
 
      - IN A MAY 2002 STATEMENT POSTED ON A PROMINENT 
      ARABIC INTERNET SITE, HAMAS MILITARY LEADER SALAH 
      SHIHADA, SUBSEQUENTLY KILLED IN AN ISRAELI TARGETED 
      OPERATION THIS FALL, SAID THAT HAMAS\' \"POLITICAL 
      APPARATUS IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE MILITARY APPARATUS, 
      AND A DECISION OF THE POLITICAL ECHELON TAKES 
      PRECEDENCE OVER THE DECISION OF THE MILITARY 
       ECHELON, WITHOUT INTERVENING IN MILITARY 
      OPERATIONS.\" 
 
      - IN AUGUST 2002, HAMAS\' GAZA-BASED SPIRITUAL LEADER 
      AHMAD YASIN WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, \"WHEN WE HAMAS 
      MAKE DECISIONS ON THE POLITICAL LEVEL AND CONVEY THEM 
      TO THE MILITARY WING, IT ABIDES BY IT NORMALLY.\" 
 
-- PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) LEADERS TELL US HAMAS 
\"POLITICAL\" LEADERS ARE COMPLICATING THEIR EFFORTS TO 
LIMIT ATTACKS ON ISRAELI TARGETS. IN JANUARY 2002, A 
PROMINENT ARAB NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT PA LEADERS HAD 
ASKED SYRIA-BASED HAMAS LEADERS IMAD AL-ALAMI, MARZUK AND 
MISHA\'AL TO STOP \"POURING OIL ON THE FIRE\" BY ARMING AND 
FUNDING CELLS IN THE WEST BANK. THE SAME NEWSPAPER 
REPORTED IN JUNE 2002 THAT AL-ALAMI HAD MET WITH 
PALESTINIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, HIZBALLAH AND AL-QAEDA 
REPRESENTATIVES TO DISCUSS CONDUCTING \"MAJOR MARTYRDOM 
OPERATIONS.\" 
 
-- HAMAS\' NETWORK OF SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORTS THE 
VIOLENT POLITICAL AMBITIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION, BOTH 
FINANCIALLY AND THROUGH EFFORTS FURTHERING INDOCTRINATION. 
 
      - HAMAS IS SUSPECTED OF DERIVING A LARGE PERCENTAGE 
      OF ITS REVENUE FROM INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE GULF 
      REGION, THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST AND EUROPE. THESE 
      FINANCES UNDERMINE THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS BY 
     PROMOTING HAMAS\' PROPAGANDA AND FACILITATING THE 
     RECRUITMENT AND INDOCTRINATION OF HAMAS ACTIVISTS. 
     SOME OF THESE FUNDS MAY ALSO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF 
     \"MARTYRS\" AND THE EXECUTION OF TERRORIST OPERATIONS. 
 
-- HAMAS CENTERS ITS POLITICAL ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY IN THE 
IMPOVERISHED AREAS OF GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. THERE IT 
 
OPENLY MAINTAINS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS 
SERVICES, RAISES MONEY, ORGANIZES ACTIVITIES, DISTRIBUTES 
PROPAGANDA AND RECRUITS MEMBERS. SOME RECRUITS ARE 
CLANDESTINELY TRAINED AS SUICIDE BOMBERS FOR SERVICE 
WITHIN IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM, THE GROUP\'S TERRORIST WING. 
HAMAS\' STRONG INFLUENCE IN MANY PALESTINIAN MOSQUES, 
SCHOOLS AND SOCIAL CLUBS CONTRIBUTES TO THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
ATTEMPTS TO INDOCTRINATE THE PALESTINIAN CONSTITUENCY WITH 
ITS VIOLENT IDEOLOGY, PARTICULARLY ITS YOUTH, AND PROVIDES 
RELIGIOUS SANCTION TO VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS. 
 
      - HAMAS \"POLITICAL\" LEADER MISHA\'AL ON NOVEMBER 16, 
      2000 WAS QUOTED IN THE ARAB DAILY AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
      AS SAYING, \"HAMAS IS A JIHAD MOVEMENT THAT SERVES THE 
      PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND THE CURRENT INTIFADA. 
      EVERYTHING HAMAS OWNS IS USED IN THIS BATTLE.\" 
 
-- HAMAS POSES AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY THREAT TO THE 
PEACE PROCESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, WHICH THE UNITED STATES 
VIEWS AS CRITICAL TO ITS NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN POLICY 
AND/OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, THROUGH THE INCITEMENT OF 
TERRORISM AND OVERT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES: 
 
     - THE UNITED STATES HAS INFORMATION INDICATING THAT 
     HAMAS\' POLITICAL BUREAU OFTEN HAS FOREKNOWLEDGE OF, 
      IS LINKED TO, AND/OR PROVIDES DIRECTION FOR THE 
     OPERATIONS OF IZZ AL-DIN AL-QASSAM AGAINST ISRAELI 
     TARGETS.   MOST RECENTLY, HAMAS CLAIMED 
     RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JULY 2002 BOMBING AT 
     JERUSALEM\'S HEBREW UNIVERSITY THAT KILLED FOUR 
     ISRAELIS AND FIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND THE MARCH 
     2002 SUICIDE BOMBINGS THAT KILLED 25 ISRAELIS ON 
     PASSOVER NIGHT IN NETANYA, ISRAEL, AND 15 ISRAELIS AT 
     A HAIFA CAFE THE SAME WEEK. SIMILARLY DEVASTATING 
     ATTACKS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2001, SUCH AS THE JUNE 1 
     BOMBING OF A TEL AVIV NIGHTCLUB THAT KILLED 22 
     ISRAELI TEENAGERS, AND THE AUGUST 9 SUICIDE ATTACK ON 
     A JERUSALEM PIZZERIA IN WHICH 15 CIVILIANS DIED. 
     AMERICAN CITIZENS AND OTHER NON-ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN 
     KILLED AND INJURED IN THESE AND OTHER ATTACKS. HAMAS 
     SPOKESMEN, INCLUDING PURPORTED \"POLITICAL\" LEADERS, 
     CATEGORIZE THESE OPERATIONS AS \"SELF-DEFENSE\" - PART 
 
      OF ITS DECLARED POLICY TO CREATE A \"BALANCE OF 
      TERROR\" WITH ISRAEL. 
 
-- HAMAS IS ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND ITS 
AFFILIATION WITH OTHER INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS CONSTITUTES A THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN 
INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND: 
 
      - HAMAS OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. FOR 
      PURPOSES OF TRAINING, FUND-RAISING AND CONSULTING 
      WITH FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND OTHER TERRORISTS 
      ORGANIZATIONS, HAMAS IS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO HAVE A 
      PRESENCE IN IRAN, LEBANON, LIBYA, SAUDI ARABIA, 
      SUDAN, YEMEN AND SYRIA (IT MAINTAINS ITS HEADQUARTERS 
      IN DAMASCUS). FOUR OF THESE COUNTRIES ARE LISTED BY 
      THE USG AS STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. HAMAS IS 
      ALSO ACTIVE IN OTHER NATIONS. FURTHER, HAMAS MAY 
      ASPIRE TO DESTABILIZE THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY IN 
      THE EVENT OF ARAFAT\'S DEATH. 
 
      - HAMAS IS BELIEVED TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER FOREIGN 
      TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS OF GLOBAL REACH, INCLUDING 
      HIZBALLAH. ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, HAMAS AND 
      HIZBALLAH HAVE COOPERATED ON WEAPONS ENHANCEMENT AND 
     DEVELOPMENT FOR USE WITHIN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIAN 
      TERRITORIES. HAMAS IS ALSO KNOWN TO MAINTAIN CLOSE 
      TIES WITH IRAN. HAMAS\' AFFILIATION WITH THESE 
     TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS, WHICH ARE TOGETHER 
      RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN 
     CITIZENS, AND IRAN (A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM) 
     CONSTITUTES A GROWING THREAT TO AMERICAN AND WESTERN 
     INTERESTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND BEYOND.

SUBJECT: TERRORIST FINANCING - UPDATED NONPAPER ON AL 
HARAMAIN 
 
REF: STATE 22362 
 
(U) CLASSIFIED BY EB A/S E. ANTHONY WAYNE, REASONS 1.5 
(B,D). 
 
1. (S) THIS CABLE REPLACES THE EARLIER VERSION OF THE NON- 
PAPER SENT OUT IN REFTEL. PLEASE DISCARD EARLIER VERSION. 
CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE, IN RESPONSE TO A REQUEST 
CONVEYED BY NSC STAFF, ARE THE FOLLOWING: REFERENCE TO 
U.S. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF U.S. BRANCH HAS BEEN 
DELETED AND DELETIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO SECTION 
III(A) (1) (A). 
 
2. (S) IN MEETINGS ON JANUARY 28, S/CT COFER BLACK AND NSC 
RAND BEERS SHOULD DELIVER THE NONPAPER IN PARA 3, AS 
APPROPRIATE. 
 
3. (S - RELEASABLE TO SAUDI ARABIA) BEGIN NONPAPER: 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
ONE OF THE TOP COUNTER-TERRORISM PRIORITIES OF THE UNITED 
STATES IS TO DEEPEN THE LEVEL OF THE ONGOING DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA RELATING TO 
FINANCIAL FLOWS TO AL-QA\'IDA. RECENT INTELLIGENCE 
REPORTING INDICATES THAT AL-QA\'IDA IS HAVING TROUBLE 
RAISING MONEY AND THAT IT IS MORE RELIANT THAN EVER ON 
SAUDI FINANCIAL SOURCES, PARTICULARLY WEALTHY DONORS AND 
FUNDING DIVERTED FROM CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. ALTHOUGH 
REPORTING USUALLY DOES NOT SPECIFY THE IDENTITIES OF 
DONORS AND CORRUPT CHARITABLE OFFICIALS, WE BELIEVE EVEN 
THESE MORE GENERAL LEADS WILL ALLOW OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS TO 
IDENTIFY AND LOCATE TERRORIST SUPPORTERS. FINDING THESE 
PEOPLE AND STOPPING THE FINANCIAL FLOWS - WHETHER THROUGH 
PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ACTION - WOULD SERIOUSLY IMPEDE THE AL- 
QA\'IDA LEADERSHIP\'S ABILITY TO RECONSTITUTE THE GROUP AND 
LAUNCH DEVASTATING NEW ATTACKS IN THE UNITED STATES, SAUDI 
ARABIA, AND ELSEWHERE. 
 
MOVING EXPEDITIOUSLY TO CUT FUNDING IS CRITICAL BECAUSE 
RECENT REPORTING SUGGESTS AL-QA\'IDA IS POISED TO ATTACK 
TARGETS WITHIN THE KINGDOM USING MONEY IT HAS RAISED FROM 
SAUDI SOURCES. WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE YOU 
WITH SUCH INFORMATION LINKING SAUDI FINANCIERS TO AL- 
QA\'IDA PLOTS IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
-- FOR EXAMPLE, IN LATE DECEMBER 2002, A DETAINEE REVEALED 
THAT AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES HAD RECEIVED 25,000 SAUDI RIYALS 
FOR PLANNED ATTACKS AGAINST US TARGETS IN SAUDI ARABIA 
USING AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES AND HAND GRENADES. 
 
-- A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID HE HAD HEARD AL- 
QA\'IDA OPERATIVES DISCUSSING PLOTS AGAINST ARAMCO 
FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
SOME AL-QA\'IDA SUPPORTERS HAVE OPPOSED TO ATTACKS WITHIN 
THE KINGDOM ONLY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE SUCH ATTACKS WOULD 
JEOPARDIZE ONGOING FUNDRAISING AND LOGISTICAL ACTIVITIES. 
 
IN OCTOBER, A SAUDI-BASED FINANCIAL FACILITATOR ADVISED AN 
AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVE ALONG THESE LINES.    HIS STATEMENT 
SUGGESTS THE OPERATIVES ARE CURRENTLY RAISING FUNDS WITHIN 
THE KINGDOM. 
 
II. AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCIAL SITUATION 
 
RECENT REPORTING INDICATES THAT AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCIAL 
NETWORK HAS BEEN DISRUPTED AND THAT IT IS RECEIVING FEWER 
FUNDS. THE INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO FREEZE THE ASSETS OF 
TERRORISTS AND THEIR SUPPORTERS HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS 
SUCCESS. PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT HAVE BEEN AL-QA\'IDA\'S 
LOSS OF A SECURE BASE IN AFGHANISTAN, THE DETENTION OF 
NUMEROUS AL-QA\'IDA FINANCIAL OFFICIALS, AND DONORS\' 
RELUCTANCE TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE THEY FEAR PUNISHMENT OR 
ARE DISENCHANTED WITH THE LACK OF ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
-- AS EARLY AS MARCH, AN ASSOCIATE OF A SENIOR USAMA BIN 
LADIN LIEUTENANT COMPLAINED THAT HIS SOURCE OF FINANCIAL 
DONATIONS HAD DRIED UP AND THAT HE WAS \"FORCED TO BEG FOR 
FUNDS.\" 
 
-- IN MARCH, AN AL-QA\'IDA ASSOCIATE WHO MANAGES AN 
UNIDENTIFIED FUNDRAISING WEBSITE INDICATED THAT DONATIONS 
FOR THE JIHAD \"WOULD SOON DRY UP\" WITHOUT CURRENT 
INFORMATION FROM THE FRONT TO ATTRACT FUNDS. 
 
-- IN MARCH, A SENIOR FIGURE IN BIN LADIN\'S PROPAGANDA 
NETWORK INDICATED THAT CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATIONS, 
CONTRIBUTIONS WERE LACKING. 
 
-- A DETAINEE REVEALED THAT AS OF LATE 2002 IT HAD BECOME 
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR AL-QA\'IDA TO TRANSFER MONEY TO 
OPERATIVES. REPORTS OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS INDICATE 
THAT AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES IN IRAN, PAKISTAN, AND YEMEN ARE 
IN NEED OF MONEY. 
 
-- IN OCTOBER, ONE AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVE SPOKE OF DEVELOPING 
PROPAGANDA \"TO BOOST DONOR CONFIDENCE,\" WHILE ANOTHER AL- 
QA\'IDA MEMBER WORRIED THAT A FAILED OPERATION WOULD STOP 
DONOR CONTRIBUTIONS. 
 
-- IN OCTOBER, A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA MEMBER RECEIVED DRAFT 
PLANS FOR A TERRORIST OPERATION TO BE PRESENTED TO 
PROSPECTIVE BENEFACTORS.   THIS FOLLOWED OTHER REPORTING 
INDICATING AL-QA\'IDA WAS HAVING TROUBLE ATTRACTING MONEY 
FROM HARD-CORE SAUDI DONORS, WHO WERE \"CLAMORING TO SEE 
THE FRUITS OF THEIR DONATIONS.\" THE PLANS PRESUMABLY WERE 
INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE DONATIONS. 
 
AS FUNDS BECOME SCARCE, AL-QA\'IDA IS TRYING TO REBUILD ITS 
FINANCIAL NETWORK TO SUSTAIN ITS LEADERSHIP AND FUND NEW 
ATTACKS. REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT AL-QA\'IDA IS TURNING TO 
LONGSTANDING SOURCES OF MONEY IN SAUDI ARABIA, NOTABLY 
WEALTHY DONORS WHO PROVIDE MONEY WITTINGLY AND CHARITIES 
FROM WHICH CORRUPT OFFICIALS DIVERT MONEY. DURING 
CUSTODIAL INTERVIEWS IN MID-2002, A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA 
REPRESENTATIVE SAID THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT 
FOR AL-QA\'IDA AMONG WEALTHY SAUDIS. HE SAID THE SUPPORT 
IS LARGELY FINANCIAL BUT ADDED THAT SAUDI SUPPORTERS ALSO 
FACILITATE TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF THE KINGDOM. THE SENIOR 
AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE SUPPORT IS TYPICALLY 
\"COVERT,\" AS SUPPORTERS FEAR THEY WILL BE PUNISHED IF TIES 
TO AL-QA\'IDA BECAME KNOWN. 
 
MONEY THAT ORIGINATES IN THE KINGDOM IS DISPERSED TO AL- 
QA\'IDA MEMBERS IN AFGHANISTAN, INDONESIA, IRAN, PAKISTAN, 
THE PHILIPPINES, YEMEN, AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE KEY AL- 
QA\'IDA OPERATIVES HAVE RELOCATED OVER THE PAST YEAR 
FOLLOWING THE LOSS OF AFGHANISTAN AS A SAFEHAVEN. FOR 
EXAMPLE, AL-QA\'IDA MEMBERS IN YEMEN-A KEY PLATFORM FOR 
OPERATIONAL PLANNING IN THE GULF-ARE GETTING THE MAJORITY 
OF THEIR FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM SAUDI ARABIA. IN MAY, 
SAUDI-BASED AL-QA\'IDA FACILITATOR AND CURRENT DETAINEE ABD 
AL-RAHMAN AL-QASIMI SUGGESTED MOST TERRORIST OPERATIONS IN 
YEMEN WERE FUNDED BY INDIVIDUALS \"AT HIS LOCATION,\" I.E. 
SAUDI ARABIA. 
 
ACCORDING TO A VARIETY OF RECENT REPORTING INCLUDING 
STATEMENTS BY KEY AL-QA\'IDA OPERATIVES, WEALTHY DONORS - 
PROBABLY MAINLY BUSINESSMEN - HAVE PROVIDED THE BULK OF 
AL-QA\'IDA\'S FUNDING SINCE AT LEAST THE LATE 1990S. AS AL- 
QA\'IDA STRUGGLES TO REGROUP, IT IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED 
IN TAPPING THIS SOURCE OF FUNDS BECAUSE OF THE SPEED WITH 
WHICH SMALL GROUPS CAN PROVIDE TENS OR HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.   MOST OF THE REPORTING WE HAVE ON 
RECENT AL-QA\'IDA EFFORTS TO ACQUIRE MONEY INDICATES THE 
GROUP PREFERS TO APPROACH DONORS DIRECTLY. FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
-- A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA REPRESENTATIVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL 
SAUDIS AS PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO AL-QA\'IDA, 
INCLUDING IBADAH AL-MAKKI, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHO USED TO 
SEND TRAINEES AND MONEY, AND SAWAD AL-MADANI, A SAUDI WHO 
SUPPLIED AL-QA\'IDA WITH MEN, EXPERTISE, EQUIPMENT, AND 
MONEY. 
 
-- OTHER SAUDI DONORS IDENTIFIED BY A SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA 
REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDE ANJANSHAH, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHO 
USED TO SEND \"A LOT\" OF MONEY TO BIN LADIN LIEUTENANT ABU 
ZUBAYDAH; QUTAYBAH, A SAUDI NATIONAL WHOSE POSITION AS A 
MOSQUE IMAM ENABLED HIM TO RAISE FUNDS FROM \"ORDINARY 
PEOPLE\" AND SEND THE FUNDS FOR THE JIHAD; AND THABIT, A 
SAUDI NATIONAL WHO HAS EXTENSIVE RELATIONS WITH SHAYKHS 
FROM WHOM HE GETS \"GOOD\" DONATIONS FOR THE JIHAD. 
 
-- ANOTHER DETAINEE TOLD INTERROGATORS IN EARLY 2002 THAT 
SAUDI DONORS HAD PROVIDED $106,667 FOR OPERATIVE TRAVEL. 
IN APRIL THE DETAINEE ADMITTED THAT HE COLLECTED $100,000 
FROM MOSQUES AND WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN SAUDI ARABIA. THE 
DETAINEE ALSO TOLD INVESTIGATORS THAT AL-QA\'IDA COLLECTED 
FUNDS FROM SAUDI MERCHANTS IN THE AREAS OF AL-QASIM AND 
RIYADH. THE FUNDS WERE SENT TO AFGHANISTAN VIA RANDOMLY 
SELECTED SAUDI EXTREMISTS TRAVELING TO JOIN AL-QA\'IDA 
FORCES. 
 
CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS (NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS 
OR \"NGOS\") ARE A SECOND SOURCE OF MONEY FOR AL-QA\'IDA. 
ALTHOUGH SEVERAL NGOS THAT SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA, SUCH AS 
WAFA AND MAKTAB AL-KHIDMAT, HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN, WE ARE 
CONCERNED THAT THEIR DONORS ARE STILL AT LARGE. REPORTING 
INDICATES AL-QA\'IDA AND AFFILIATED TERRORIST GROUPS ARE 
STILL RECEIVING MONEY FROM SAUDI CHARITIES WITHIN THE 
KINGDOM, VIA CORRUPT OFFICIALS WHO DIVERT CHARITABLE 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUPPORT THE GROUP.   FOR EXAMPLE, IN A 
POSSIBLE EFFORT TO GIVE AL-HARAMAIN HEADQUARTERS AND 
FOREIGN DONORS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY TO CHARGES THAT FUNDS 
SENT TO INDONESIA WERE FUNNELED TO EXTREMISTS, IN LATE 
2001 AL-HARAMAIN ROUTED FUNDS TO THE INDONESIA MISSION 
THROUGH A THIRD PARTY INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY TO JAKARTA 
DIRECTOR AL-AMOUDI. 
 
-- AL-HARAMAIN\'S INDONESIA OFFICE HAS TIES TO SEVERAL AL- 
QA\'IDA AFFILIATED INDIVIDUALS-INCLUDING UMAR FARUQ-AS WELL 
AS JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) LEADER ABU BAKAR BASHIR (VARIANT 
BA\'ASYIR). 
 
-- HIGH-RANKING JI MEMBERS, INCLUDING IMAM HANAFEI, HAVE 
BEEN KNOWN TO CONSORT WITH THE \"COMMITTEE OF SHAYKHS,\" 
RAISING A POSSIBLE LINKAGE BETWEEN SAUDI MONEY, INDONESIAN 
MILITANT GROUPS, AND AL-QA\'IDA. 
 
III. OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER REDUCE AL-QA\'IDA\'S FUNDING 
 
AL-QA\'IDA\'S SERIOUS FINANCIAL PROBLEMS SUGGEST THAT 
EFFORTS TO FIND AND BLOCK MONEY FLOWS PRESENT AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO DISRUPT TERRORISTS\' OPERATIONS AND PREVENT 
THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP FROM REBUILDING THE ORGANIZATION BY 
FINDING AND SHUTTING OFF THE MONEY FLOW FROM MAJOR DONORS 
AND FROM CORRUPT OFFICIALS OF CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
     A. CUTTING CHARITY TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA 
 
RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT HUMANITARIAN WORK UNDERTAKEN BY 
CHARITIES, THE FACT THAT TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS DIVERT 
RESOURCES INTENDED FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES AND SOMETIMES 
CORRUPT THEIR EMPLOYEES IS PARTICULARLY APPALLING. WE 
RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE STEPS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
SAUDI ARABIA HAS ALREADY TAKEN, AS WELL AS YOUR COMMITMENT 
TO CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST ABUSE OF 
ISLAMIC CHARITIES BY TERRORISTS. IT IS EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER CORRUPTION IN CHARITIES AND TO 
PREVENT FUTURE OCCURRENCES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE US 
 
INVESTIGATION OF THE BENEVOLENCE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION, 
HAS BEEN LONG AND DIFFICULT, AND WE HAVE YET TO ACQUIRE 
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO INDICT THE FOUNDERS OF BIF FOR 
COMPLICITY IN TERRORIST SUPPORT. 
 
ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING CHARITABLE FUNDS ARE NOT DIVERTED TO 
TERRORISTS IS LIKELY TO BE A LONG PROCESS. BETTER 
OVERSIGHT OF CHARITIES\' SPENDING AND VETTING OF THEIR 
EMPLOYEES EVENTUALLY WILL MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
TERRORISTS TO DIVERT FUNDS FROM THEM. IN THE NEAR TERM, 
REMOVING OFFICIALS ENGAGED IN TERRORIST SUPPORT AND 
QUESTIONING THEM TO UNCOVER OTHER COMPLICIT OFFICIALS 
WOULD QUICKLY REDUCE DIVERSIONS OF MONEY TO AL-QA\'IDA. 
 
     1. A PRIORITY CASE: THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC 
FOUNDATION 
 
A CHARITY OF GREAT IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS AL-HARAMAIN 
ISLAMIC FOUNDATION. OF COURSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT AL- 
HARAMAIN PROVIDES LEGITIMATE HUMANITARIAN AID, BUT WE 
REMAIN VERY CONCERNED THAT PERSONNEL IN ALMOST HALF OF ITS 
50 OFFICES, INCLUDING PERSONNEL WITHIN THE KINGDOM, ARE 
AIDING AND ABETTING AL-QA\'IDA AND ITS AFFILIATED TERRORIST 
GROUPS. 
 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED YOUR 
GOVERNMENT WITH SOME INFORMATION ON AL-HARAMAIN\'S 
ILLEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER; HOWEVER, WE 
NOW HAVE A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE ON THE CHARITY\'S 
COMPLICIT EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS HOW IT SUPPORTS TERRORIST 
GROUPS. 
 
NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE COMPILED ON AL-HARAMAIN INDICATES 
THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE BOSNIA AND SOMALIA BRANCHES 
AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE TAKEN JOINT ACTION, OFFICIALS OF 
SEVERAL OTHER BRANCHES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE TIES TO AL- 
QA\'IDA AND RELATED TERRORIST GROUPS. AMONG THESE BRANCHES 
IS THE US BRANCH. IN ADDITION TO CURRENT AND FORMER AL- 
HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WITH YOU, 
RECENT REPORTING IMPLICATES THE CHARITY\'S DIRECTOR, SHAYKH 
AQIL IBN \'ABDUL-\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL. FINALLY, WE REMAIN 
CONCERNED ABOUT RECENT REPORTS INDICATING THAT AL- 
HARAMAIN\'S BRANCH OFFICES IN BOSNIA AND SOMALIA CONTINUE 
TO RECEIVE FUNDS FROM AL-HARAMAIN HEADQUARTERS DESPITE OUR 
JOINT ASSET FREEZE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE CAN LEARN MORE, 
AND STOP THE ABUSE OF AL-HARAMAIN BY TERRORISTS. 
 
     A. INFORMATION PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY ON THE AL- 
     HARAMAIN ISLAMIC FOUNDATION 
 
AS YOU KNOW, VARIOUS U.S. INTERLOCUTORS HAVE DISCUSSED 
WITH YOUR VARIOUS AGENCIES OF YOUR GOVERNMENT A RANGE OF 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC 
FOUNDATION SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. WE HAVE ALSO 
PROVIDED INFORMATION TO YOU ABOUT THE BASIS OF THESE 
CONCERNS, AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THEM. 
THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THOSE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS, THE 
INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN. 
 
-- ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, FROM AUGUST 1998 - NOVEMBER 2002, 
WE HAVE PROVIDED REPORTS TO AND/OR ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE 
FROM THE MUBAHITH RELATED TO THE ACTIVITIES OF AL- 
HARAMAIN. SEVERAL OF OUR REPORTS AND INQUIRIES RELATED TO 
THE POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS IN AL- 
QA\'IDA\'S BOMBINGS OF US EMBASSIES IN EAST AFRICA. OF 
PARTICULAR NOTE AMONG THESE IS MU\'AMMAR AL-TURKI ABD AL- 
WAHHAB AL-DAHKIL. WE ALSO HAVE PROVIDED LEADS ON SEVERAL 
OTHER AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE 
TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
INFORMATION IN LATE 1999 AND LATE 2001 NOTING HOW AL- 
HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES IN GENERAL HELPED AL-QA\'IDA WITH 
FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT 
SOME FUNDS WERE FLOWING FROM AL-HARAMAIN THROUGH THE 
REMITTANCE FIRM AL-BARAKAT TO AL-QA\'IDA\'S ALLY, AL-ITTIHAD 
AL-ISLAMI (AIAI). 
 
A LEAD TO MAHMUD BAHAZIQ, SUSPECTED FINANCIER OF PAKISTANI 
TERRORIST GROUP LASKAR-E-TAYYIBA WHO MAY HAVE TIES TO AL- 
HARAMAIN. 
 
-- ON JANUARY 16, 2002, AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY BURNS PROVIDED TO CROWN PRINCE ABDULLAH AND 
FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD A PROPOSAL FOR JOINT U.S. AND SAUDI 
ACTION TO FREEZE THE ACCOUNTS OF, AMONG OTHERS, THE AL- 
HARMAIN OFFICES IN BOSNIA AND SOMALIA. INFORMATION 
PROVIDED IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. PROPOSAL INCLUDED: 
 
AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO UBL, EIJ, AND AL-GAMA\'AT AL- 
ISLAMIYYAH: AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OFFICE OF AL-HARAMAIN 
PROVIDED LOGISTICAL SUPPORT TO THE EIJ AND UBL ASSOCIATES 
BY DIVERTING BOTH FUNDING AND SUPPLIES FROM LEGITIMATE NGO 
ACTIVITIES. AL-HARAMAIN WAS USED AS COVER FOR THE BOSNIA- 
HERZOGOVINA-BASED EGYPTIAN TERRORIST GROUP, AL-GAMA\'AT AL- 
ISLAMIYYAH. AL-HARAMAIN MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN FUNDED 
DIRECTLY BY USAMA BIN LADIN. ELEMENTS OF AL-HARAMAIN WERE 
INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING ARMS IN SUPPORT OF ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISTS IN BOSNIA-HERZOGOVINA. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SOMALIA\'S AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI (AIAI): 
AS OF APRIL 1999, AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OF AL-HARAMAIN HAD 
FINANCIAL LINKS TO KENYA-BASED AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI 
(AIAI), A MAJOR TERRORIST GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL-QA\'IDA. 
AIAI HAS TRAINED AN ARMED MILITIA WHICH HAS BEEN WAGING A 
RUTHLESS CAMPAIGN FOR CONTROL OF THE GEDO REGION IN 
SOMALIA. AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OF AL-HARAMAIN SUPPORTED 
AIAI IN AL WAQ, SOMALIA, BY SENDING RELIEF FOOD TO AIAI 
MEMBERS IN AIAI CAMPS. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SDGT WAFA HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION: 
TWO AL-HARAMAIN REPRESENTATIBVES, ABU \'ABDULLAH AND ABU 
MUHAMMAD, ACCOMPANIED ABDUL AL-SABUR (REPRESENTATIVE OF 
ABU ABDUL-AZIZ, AKA ABU \'ABDULLAY, THE HEAD OF THE WAFA 
HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION IN KANDAHAR, AFGHANISTAN), TO 
AFGHANISTAN, WHERE THEY WERE TO MEET AFGHAN OFFICIALS 
REGARDING THE OPENING OF AN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN 
AFGHANISTAN. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN TIES TO SDGT MAKHTAB AL-KHIDMAT (MK): AL- 
HARAMAIN MAINTAINED MK FUNDS, \"THE BULK OF THE REMAINDER 
OF THE ORIGINAL SUM OF MONEY (USD 2.5 MILLION),\" IN ITS 
RAWALPINDI ACCOUNTS. THE FUNDS CAME FROM DONATIONS OF MK. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN STAFFED BY UBL ASSOCIATES AND OTHERS WITH 
TERRORIST TIES: UBL ASSOCIATES HAVE OCCUPIED KEY 
 
POSITIONS IN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES OVERSEAS. IN 1997, AL- 
HARAMAIN KENYA-BRANCH EMPLOYEES WERE ARRESTED AND EXPELLED 
FOR PLANNING A TERRORIST ATTACK AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 
SOME OF THIS PLANNING OCCURRED WITHIN THE AL-HARAMAIN 
OFFICE.  AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIAL, SALAH A.Q. AL-THIBANI, RAN 
THE AL-HARAMAIN-ALBANIA OFFICE.   AL-THIBANI IS A CLOSE 
ASSOCIATE OF UBL OPERATIVE FAHID AL-SHAHRI. THIBANI WAS 
ALSO FOUNDER OF THE IIRO. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN FUNDING OF ISLAMIC JIHAD MOVEMENTS IN YEMEN: 
AS OF MARCH 1999, AN UNSPECIFIED BRANCH OFFICE OF AL- 
HARAMAIN SUPPORTED THE ISLAMIC JIHAD MOVEMENT AND ITS 
ASSOCIATED FACILITIES IN YEMEN. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN EFFORT TO REDUCE CORRUPTION OF THE NGO: AL- 
HARAMAIN SENIOR DIRECTORS HAVE SOUGHT TO INSTITUTE 
MANAGERIAL TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR PROSPECTIVE REGIONAL 
OFFICES\' CHIEFS AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE CHANGES THAT 
ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS WITH A POLITICAL OR TERRORIST AGENDA 
WILL BE ABLE TO MISUSE AL-HARAMAIN FUNDS OR OTHER 
RESOURCES. 
 
-- BASED IN LARGE PART ON THIS INFORMATION AND ADDITIONAL 
DISCUSSIONS WITH AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND TREASURY SECRETARY 
O\'NEILL IN MARCH, 2002, THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND 
THE UNITED STATES AGREED JOINTLY TO REFER THE BOSNIA AND 
SOMALIA BRANCHES OF AL-HARAMAIN TO THE UNITED NATIONS 
SANCTIONS COMMITTEE FOR ACTION UNDER UNSCR 1267. 
 
-- IN MAY, 2002, TREASURY OFAC DIRECTOR NEWCOMB LED A 
DELEGATION TO SAUDI ARABIA AND MET WITH VARIOUS OFFICIALS 
TO DISCUSS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEASURES TAKEN BY THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA TO IMPROVE OVERSIGHT OF AL- 
HARAMAIN AND OTHER CHARITIES. 
 
-- IN SEPTEMBER, 2002, U.S. EMBASSY OFFICIALS DISCUSSED 
WITH FOREIGN MINISTRY DIRECTOR FOR INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS HH DR. PRINCE TURKI BIN MOHAMMED AL-KABIR 
AL-SAUD, U.S. CONCERNS ABOUT PRESS REPORTS THAT AL- 
HARAMAIN BOSNIA HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RE-OPEN, DESPITE THE 
UN SANCTIONS. IN OCTOBER, 2002, AMBASSADOR JORDAN AND 
STATE DEPARTMENT COUNTER-TERRORISM COORDINATOR AMBASSADOR 
FRANCIS X. TAYLOR DISCUSSED THESE SAME CONCERNS WITH 
MINISTER OF INTERIOR PRINCE NAYIF. 
 
-- IN OCTOBER 2002, UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE AL LARSON 
RAISED OUR CONCERNS ABOUT AL-HARAMAIN WITH CROWN PRINCE 
ABDULLAH AND FOREIGN MINISTER SAUD AL-FAISAL. 
 
-- IN NOVEMBER, 2002, STATE DEPARTMENT ASSISTANT SECRETARY 
ANTHONY WAYNE ASKED CROWN PRINCE ADVISOR ADEL AL-JUBEIR 
WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA WAS LOOKING CLOSELY 
AT AL-HARAMAIN AND ITS OPERATIONS, GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE 
WITH THE BOSNIA AND SOMALIA BRANCHES. 
 
THE UNITED STATES APPRECIATES VERY MUCH THE EFFORTS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT OF SAUDI ARABIA TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, 
INCLUDING IN PARTICULAR THE JOINT REFERRAL TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW MECHANISMS TO OVERSEE 
THE ACTIVITIES OF CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
     B. NEW INFORMATION ON THE AL-HARAMAIN ISLAMIC 
FOUNDATION 
 
DESPITE THE JOINT EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA TO CONTROL THE MISUSE OF AL- 
HARAMAIN RESOURCES BY TERRORISTS, A GROWING BODY OF 
REPORTING INDICATES THAT PERSONS WORKING IN SEVERAL 
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, ASIA, AND EUROPE FOR AL-HARAMAIN 
ISLAMIC FOUNDATION (HIF) HAVE SUPPORTED -- AND MAY 
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- ISLAMIC TERRORIST GROUPS. 
REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT 20 AL-HARAMAIN FIELD OFFICES 
AND REPRESENTATIVES OPERATING IN 50 COUNTRIES IN AFRICA, 
ASIA, EUROPE, AND NORTH AMERICA, AS WELL AS ITS 
HEADQUARTERS IN SAUDI ARABIA, APPEAR TO BE PROVIDING 
FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO AL-QA\'IDA. 
 
-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, HIF OFFICIALS PROVIDE 
FINANCIAL AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT TO BIN LADIN ASSOCIATES AND 
OTHER RADICALS BY DIVERTING FUNDS AND SUPPLIES FROM 
LEGITIMATE ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, KENYAN AUTHORITIES 
DE-REGISTERED AL-HARAMAIN AS WELL AS THREE OTHER NGOS FOR 
\"SUBVERSIVE\" ACTIVITIES BY ITS EMPLOYEES FOLLOWING THE 
AUGUST 1998 BOMBING IN NAIROBI. 
 
-- OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS - SUCH AS AL-ITTIHAD AL- 
ISLAMIYA, HAMAS, EGYPTIAN ISLAMIC JIHAD, LASHKAR-I- 
TAYYIBA, AND FOREIGN MUJAHIDIN IN BOSNIA AND CHECHNYA - 
GET FUNDING FROM HIF OR USE AL-HARAMAIN AS A FRONT FOR 
FUNDRAISING AND OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
 
THE U.S. JUDGES THAT HIF DIRECTOR SHAYKH \'AQIL IBN \'ABDUL- 
\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL, WHO MANAGES AL-HARAMAIN\'S BUSINESS ON A 
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS, IS PROVIDING FUNDS TO OFFICES WITH 
TERRORIST TIES IN WAYS THAT WILL AVOID FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
SCRUTINY, SUCH AS USING PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNTS TO TRANSFER 
OFFICIAL HIF FUNDS. 
 
ANALYSIS OF REPORTING SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER INDICATES THAT 
HIF HEADQUARTERS HAS CHANGED THE WAY IT SENDS FUNDS TO 
OFFICES ENGAGED IN SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT THE 
MONEY FROM BEING IDENTIFIED OR SEIZED BY FOREIGN 
OFFICIALS. AL-HARAMAIN INCREASINGLY SENDS MONEY TO 
INDIVIDUALS\' ACCOUNTS IN ADDITION TO TRANSFERRING FUNDS TO 
BRANCH OFFICES. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED TRANSFERS THAT 
ORIGINATED FROM SENIOR HIF OFFICIALS\' PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, 
INCLUDING SHAYKH \'AQIL IN SAUDI ARABIA, TO PERSONAL 
ACCOUNTS OF KNOWN HIF AFFILIATES. HIF ALSO EMPLOYS 
COURIERS TO MOVE MONEY OUTSIDE ELECTRONIC BANKING SYSTEMS. 
 
-- AS OF EARLY APRIL 1999, AL-HARAMAIN USED A CENTRALIZED 
SYSTEM THAT PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS FROM ALLOCATING FUNDS 
WITHOUT THE PERSONAL APPROVAL OF THE FOUNDATION\'S 
DIRECTOR. GIVEN THIS SYSTEM, THE QUESTIONABLE TRANSFERS 
SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER 2001 SUGGEST THAT GREAT SCRUTINY SHOULD 
BE GIVEN TO SHAYKH \'AQIL. 
 
-- HIF HEADQUARTERS IS LAYERING TRANSFERS, A PRACTICE THAT 
CONCEALS THE ORIGINATOR AND DESTINATION OF THE TRANSFERS. 
HIF HAS REPEATEDLY SENT MONEY TO A BAHRAINI ACCOUNT 
BELONGING TO AN UNSPECIFIED SENIOR HIF OFFICIAL RESIDING 
IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHO SUBSEQUENTLY SENDS THE FUNDS TO HIF 
ACCOUNTS IN NIGERIA. 
 
-- REPORTING INDICATES THAT HIF SENT FUNDS FROM A HIF 
ACCOUNT IN SAUDI ARABIA TO AN AL-ANSAR WELFARE TRUST IN 
KASHMIR.  AL-ANSAR WELFARE TRUST IS A FRONT FOR LASHKAR-I- 
TAYYIBA (LT) AND TEHRIK UL-MUJAHIDIN, WHICH HAVE BEEN 
LISTED BY THE UNITED STATES AS TERRORIST GROUPS. 
 
-- IN MID-NOVEMBER 2001, UNSPECIFIED AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS 
MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF WAFA, AN NGO RUN BY AL-QA\'IDA, 
TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF WAFA OPENING AN HIF BRANCH 
IN IRAN TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO AL-QA\'IDA 
AFTER WAFA ASSETS WERE FROZEN. 
 
-- HIF EMPLOYEES\' ACCOUNTS IN ALBANIA PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED 
MONEY FROM AN HIF OFFICIAL ACCOUNT AT AL-RAJHI BANK, BUT 
IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TRANSFERS HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THE 
PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF HIF\'S EUROPEAN COMMITTEE DIRECTOR, 
HESHAM AL-MASHARI. 
 
INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN SAUDI EMBASSIES IN SEVERAL 
COUNTRIES APPEAR TO BE WITTING OF, AND SOMETIMES 
ASSISTING, HIF BRANCH OFFICES THAT SUPPORT EXTREMIST 
GROUPS. FOR EXAMPLE, REPORTING INDICATES THAT AS OF LATE 
SEPTEMBER 2001 ACCREDITED SAUDI DIPLOMATS AT THE SAUDI 
EMBASSY IN BOSNIA COORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM AL- 
HARAMAIN TO FORMER ARAB MUJAHIDIN IN BOSNIA. DIPLOMATS IN 
ANOTHER EMBASSIES HAVE OFFERED TO CONCEAL AL-HARAMAIN 
DOCUMENTS FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
 
AFRICA. REPORTING INDICATES AL-HARAMAIN MAINTAINS A 
PRESENCE IN ABOUT A DOZEN AFRICAN COUNTRIES AND SUPPORTS 
SEVERAL EXTREMIST GROUPS, PARTICULARLY SOMALIA\'S AL- 
ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMI (AIAI). AL-HARAMAIN ALSO MISUSES ITS 
STATUS AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION TO FUND ISLAMIST 
POLITICAL PARTIES AND CIVIC GROUPS IN EAST AFRICAN 
COUNTRIES - INCLUDING DJIBOUTI AND COMOROS ISLANDS. IN 
SOME INSTANCES, THE FUNDING EXTENDS TO SUPPORTING 
SECTARIAN VIOLENCE. 
 
-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES PROVIDED 
COVER AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT FOR AL-QA\'IDA CELLS, INCLUDING 
THOSE IN THE 1998 US EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND 
TANZANIA. REPORTING INDICATES MOST OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S FIELD 
OFFICE DIRECTORS IN EAST AFRICA ARE AWARE OF AND SUPPORT 
 
THE ORGANIZATION\'S AID TO MILITANT EXTREMISTS, AND AT 
LEAST SOME TOP-LEVEL OFFICIALS FROM AL-HARAMAIN\'S 
HEADQUARTERS CONDONE THE FUNDING OF MILITANT EXTREMIST 
GROUPS. 
 
REPORTING SUGGESTS AL-HARAMAIN\'S TOP PRIORITY IN AFRICA IS 
SUPPORTING AIAI. AIAI - DESIGNATED BY THE US DEPARTMENT 
OF TREASURY UNDER U.S. EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 AS A FOREIGN 
TERRORIST GROUP - SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN 
\"GREATER SOMALIA\" INCLUDING PARTS OF ETHIOPIA, DJIBOUTI, 
AND KENYA. UNSPECIFIED HIF OFFICES WORLDWIDE COLLECT 
FUNDS TO PROVIDE AIAI FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ESTABLISH 
ISLAMIC SCHOOLS, COURTS, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS IN AIAI- 
INFLUENCED TERRITORY. HIF HAS ALSO HELPED THE FACTION 
DEVELOP ITS INSURGENT AND TERRORIST CAPABILITIES. 
 
-- IN 2002, AL-HARAMAIN ARRANGED TRAVEL FOR AIAI MEMBERS 
TO SAUDI ARABIA, PROBABLY TO HELP THEM AVOID ANTICIPATED 
US MILITARY ACTION IN SOMALIA. 
 
-- IN 2001, HIF PROVIDED HUMANITARIAN COVER FOR 
UNIDENTIFIED ARABS TRAVELING TO SOMALIA TO TRAIN AIAI 
MILITARY RECRUITS. AS OF LATE 2001, AL-HARAMAIN RAN A 
MILITARY TRAINING/RECRUITMENT CENTER IN MOGADISHU WITH 
AIAI. YOUNG MEN ATTENDING THIS CENTER RECEIVED PHYSICAL 
FITNESS, MARKSMANSHIP, AND SIMILAR TRAINING. 
 
-- DURING SEPTEMBER 2002 AL-HARAMAIN ACCOUNTANTS IN 
SOMALIA EXCHANGED $2 MILLION FOR SOMALI SHILLINGS AT 
MOGADISHU\'S BAKARA MARKET, WHICH OCCURRED AFTER THE JOINT 
DESIGNATION OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S OFFICES IN SOMALIA. 
 
-- AS OF MID-MARCH 2002, AL-HARAMAIN IN MOGADISHU, SOMALIA 
WAS SCHEDULED TO HOST A CONFERENCE WITH MEMBERS OF AL- 
QA\'IDA ATTENDING. 
 
-- IN 1999, HIF MAINTAINED VILLAS IN SOMALIA USED TO STORE 
EXPLOSIVES AND TRAIN AIAI MEMBERS FOR JIHAD OPERATIONS. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN ALSO SUPPORTS AIAI FROM ITS OFFICES AND 
REFUGEE CAMPS IN KENYA. IN 2001-2002, REPORTING INDICATED 
THAT AL-HARAMAIN\'S KENYAN OFFICES ALSO PROVIDED SUPPORT 
AND COVER TO AIAI OPERATIVES AS WELL AS FUNDED AIAI 
RECRUITMENT EFFORTS IN THE COUNTRY. 
 
-- IN 2002, AL-HARAMAIN\'S DIRECTOR IN TANZANIA - RAMZI BEN 
MIZAUNI - FUNDED THE MOSQUES IN THE COUNTRY MOST ENGAGED 
IN MILITANT ACTIVITY AND ABUSED THE NGO\'S TAX-FREE STATUS 
TO IMPORT GOODS AND FUNDS IT USED TO SUPPORT MILITANT 
ACTIVITIES. 
 
-- IN 2001, A GROUP OF UP TO 20 MUSLIM MILITANTS, AT LEAST 
SOME OF WHOM WERE PROBABLY AL-QA\'IDA FIGHTERS FLEEING 
AFGHANISTAN, TRAVELED FROM AFGHANISTAN TO KENYA AND 
TANZANIA UNDER THE SPONSORSHIP OF AL-HARAMAIN. 
 
-- IN 1999, THE HEAD OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S MOSQUE DIRECTORATE, 
SHAYKH ABDALLAH GILID AL-MARZUQI, PROVIDED FUNDS TO 
PROMINENT TANZANIAN ISLAMIC MILITANTS WHO, IN 1998, HAD 
DISTRIBUTED MONEY TO ISLAMIST DEMONSTRATORS SO THAT THEY 
COULD TURN VIOLENT. 
 
-- AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY, AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIALS WERE 
IMPLICATED IN AN ABORTED PLOT TO ATTACK THE US EMBASSY IN 
NAIROBI IN 1997. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IN THE FALL OF 1997, 
THE AL-HARAMAIN PROJECT MANAGER IN NAIROBI, ABDEL MALIK, 
WAS POSSIBLY PLANNING TO ASSASSINATE US CITIZENS IN 
NAIROBI, AND INSTRUCTED THREE INDIVIDUALS TO CONTINUE 
SURVEILLANCE OF THE US EMBASSY. THESE ASSOCIATES OF AL- 
HARAMAIN IN KENYA REPORTEDLY POSTPONED AN ATTACK AGAINST 
THE US EMBASSY IN NAIROBI UNTIL AFTER THE KENYAN GENERAL 
ELECTIONS. THE DECISION TO POSTPONE THE ATTACK WAS MADE 
FOLLOWING A 5 SEPTEMBER 1997 VISIT BY THE KENYAN POLICE TO 
THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN ISIOLO, KENYA. 
 
BALKANS. DOCUMENTS SEIZED IN THE BALKANS SUGGEST THAT 
EMPLOYEES AT HIF OFFICES IN ALBANIA, BOSNIA, CROATIA, AND 
KOSOVO SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA AND AFFILIATED GROUPS. 
INDIVIDUALS IN EACH OF THESE OFFICES WERE FUNDED BY OR 
WORKED WITH BIN LADIN. 
 
-- E-MAILS FROM AL-QA\'IDA MEMBERS FOUND IN 2002 ON 
COMPUTERS CONFISCATED FROM THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN 
TRAVNIK, CROATIA CONTAINED INSTRUCTIONS TO ATTACK AN SFOR 
BASE IN TUZLA. 
 
-- FOLLOWING THE 11 SEPTEMBER TERRORIST ATTACKS, OFFICIALS 
AT THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICE IN KOSOVO DESTROYED ALL 
DOCUMENTS THAT COULD LINK THE ORGANIZATION TO MILITANT OR 
TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. IN LATE 2001, HIF OFFICIALS DECIDED 
TO TEMPORARILY MAINTAIN A LOW PROFILE BEFORE RESUMING 
ILLICIT ACTIVITIES. 
 
-- ABU MUNZER, AN AL-HARAMAIN OFFICIAL IN SAUDI ARABIA, 
URGED ANOTHER AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEE TO DIVERT THE FUNDS OF 
AN UNSPECIFIED DONATION TO THE NEW FACILITY (OSTROGATAIS) 
DESIGNED TO REPLACE AL-HARAMAIN IN BOSNIA. 
 
-- IN MAY AND JUNE 2002, A SENIOR BOSNIAN-BASED HIF 
OFFICIAL WAS IN CONTACT WITH AN AL-QA\'IDA-ASSOCIATED 
MILITANT WHO WAS PLANNING A TERRORIST ATTACK USING TOXINS 
AND POSSIBLY EXPLOSIVES. 
 
INDONESIA. RECENT REPORTING INDICATES THAT HIF OFFICES IN 
INDONESIA SUPPORT AL-QA\'IDA AND OTHER EXTREMIST GROUPS. 
AFTER LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR TIES TO LOCAL EXTREMISTS 
AND ASSURING THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT IT WOULD ENGAGE IN 
\"SOCIAL WELFARE\" PROJECTS, AL-HARAMAIN APPEARS TO HAVE 
ASSUMED A KEY ROLE IN FACILITATING FUND TRANSFERS TO 
EXTREMISTS AFFILIATED WITH LOCAL TERRORIST GROUPS AND 
SUPPORTING MILITANT EXTREMISM AMONG LOCAL MUSLIMS. 
 
REPORTS INDICATE THAT SUPPORT FOR TERRORIST GROUPS CAME 
FROM THE MOST SENIOR LEVELS OF HARAMAIN WITHIN INDONESIA. 
SAUDI NATIONAL AHMAD AL-AMOUDI, DIRECTOR OF THE AL- 
HARAMAIN BRANCHES IN INDONESIA, MET PRIVATELY IN MARCH 
2000 WITH JAFAR UMAR THALIB, LEADER OF THE INDONESIAN 
EXTREMIST GROUP LASKAR JIHAD. AL-AMOUDI NOTED THAT AL- 
HARAMAIN WAS WORKING WITH THALIB ON SEVERAL ONGING 
\"PROJECTS.\" BECAUSE AL-AMOUDI IS SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEEN 
INVOLVED IN RECRUITING MUJAHIDIN TRAINEES IN THE 1990S, WE 
BELIEVE THE \"PROJECTS\" ARE RELATED TO TERRORIST OR 
EXTREMIST ACTIVITIES. 
 
-- AL-AMOUDI, WHO WE BELIEVE IS CURRENTLY RESIDING IN 
SAUDI ARABIA, WAS ONE OF THREE PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDING 
FOR JAKARTA-BASED AL-QA\'IDA FACILITATOR \'UMAR FARUQ.   HE 
FREQUENTLY DISBURSED LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH TO FARUQ TO 
PROCURE WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, AND OTHER ITEMS. FARUQ ALSO 
ADMITTED THAT HE DELIVERED $99,000 TO AL-AMOUDI IN APRIL 
2002 AT THE REQUEST OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S DAMMAM, SAUDI ARABIA, 
OFFICE DIRECTOR, AND TOLD INTERROGATORS IN JULY THAT HE 
ALSO RECEIVED FUNDS FROM ANOTHER OPERATIVE THROUGH AL- 
HARAMAIN.   IN LATE 2001 AL-HARAMAIN ROUTED FUNDS THROUGH 
A THIRD PARTY INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY TO AL-HARAMAIN JAKARTA 
DIRECTOR AL-AMOUDI. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN WAS ACTIVE IN INDONESIA AND CULTIVATED TIES TO 
LOCAL MILITANT EXTREMIST GROUPS BEFORE OFFICIALLY OPENING 
ITS JAKARTA OFFICE IN MID-JULY 2000. AN AL-HARAMAIN 
CONTRACTOR TRAVELED TO INDONESIA IN 1998. AL-HARAMAIN\'S 
SEASONED STAFF MAY HAVE HELPED THE CHARITY GET ITS 
INDONESIA OPERATIONS ON LINE QUICKLY. 
 
AL-AMOUDI PREVIOUSLY SERVED AT AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES IN 
PAKISTAN AND AZERBAIJAN AND MAY HAVE WORKED WITH JAKARTA 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR ADAM NASIR WARSHA IN BANGLADESH. WARSHA 
ALSO CLAIMED HE RECEIVED MILITARY TRAINING FROM THE 
TALIBAN AND/OR FOUGHT IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN MAY BE CONTINUING TO USE ITS PRESENCE IN 
INDONESIA TO IDENTIFY LOCAL RECRUITS FOR JIHAD TRAINING IN 
INDONESIAN CAMPS AND ABROAD; THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS 
THAT AL-HARAMAIN EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN 
RECRUITING MUJAHIDIN TRAINEES IN THE PAST. 
 
-- FARUQ NOTED THAT AL-HARAMAIN HAD PURCHASED A POWERBOAT 
-- PROBABLY TO ASSIST JIHADISTS - IN AMBON. 
 
AL-HARAMAIN MAY ALSO SUPPORT MILITANT EXTREMISTS THROUGH 
LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS-FARUQ NOTED IN CUSTODIAL INTERVIEWS 
THAT KOMPAK, THE PARAMILITARY WING OF THE INDONESIAN 
 
RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUP DEWAN DAKWAH ISLAMIYAH INDONESIA, 
RECEIVED UNSPECIFIED ASSISTANCE FROM AL-HARAMAIN. 
 
PAKISTAN.  THE ISLAMABAD OFFICE OF HIF ALSO APPEARS TO 
HAVE SUPPORTED AL-QA\'IDA. THE DIRECTOR OF THE HIF OFFICE 
IN ISLAMABAD SOUGHT PERMISSION FROM THE RIYADH OFFICE IN 
JULY 2002 TO CEASE OPERATIONS FOR UP TO THREE MONTHS TO 
AVOID SCRUTINY FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES. 
 
UNITED STATES. THE PATTERN OF AL-HARAMAIN\'S OPERATIONS 
OBSERVED INTERNATIONALLY CAN BE OBSERVED IN THE OPERATIONS 
OF THE US-BASED OFFICES. 
 
-- THE AL-HARAMAIN OFFICES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE 
OPENED IN 1997 BY PIROUZ SEDAGHATY AND SOLIMAN ALBUT\'HE 
AKA SOLIMAN HAMAD AL BATAHI, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A 
RANKING OFFICIAL OF AL-HARAMAIN. SEDAGHATY AND ALBUT\'HE 
ARE LISTED AS OFFICIALS OF THE US AL-HARAMAIN OPERATION 
ALONG WITH AQIL AQIL AND AL-HARAMAIN\'S DIRECTOR OF AFRICAN 
OPERATIONS, MANSOUR AL-KADI. AQIL IS BELIEVED TO BE 
IDENTICAL TO SHAYKH AQIL IBN \'ABDUL-\'AZIZ AL-\'AQIL, THE 
MANAGING DIRECTOR OF AL-HARAMAIN. 
 
-- SEPARATE REPORTS LINK AL-KADI TO INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE 1998 EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN KENYA AND TANZANIA. 
RECENT REPORTING REVEALED THAT THE HIF\'S US-BASED OFFICES 
RECEIVED $500,000 FROM BIN LADIN. THESE FUNDS WERE 
REPORTEDLY USED TO PURCHASE MOSQUES THAT WOULD BE USED FOR 
RECRUITING EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY, AL-HARAMAIN HAS 
PROVIDED FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT 
HAVE REPORTEDLY BEEN INVOLVED IN JIHADIST PARAMILITARY 
TRAINING. 
 
-- SINCE 11 SEPTEMBER, SOLIMAN ALBUT\'HE, A/K/A SOLIMAN 
HAMAD AL BATAHI, WHO HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A RANKING 
OFFICIAL OF AL-HARAMAIN, HAS PROVIDED OVER $20,000 TO 
INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN THE UNITED STATES THAT REPORTEDLY 
HAVE PARTICIPATED IN JIHADIST PARAMILITARY TRAINING. 
THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH AL-HARAMAIN. 
 
     B.  CUTTING DONOR TIES 
 
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST, MOST IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON AL-QA\'IDA\'S 
ABILITY TO FINANCE ITSELF WOULD COME FROM CUTTING OFF THE 
FLOWS OF FUNDS FROM MAJOR DONORS.   REPORTING SUGGESTS THAT 
A SMALL NUMBER OF WEALTHY PEOPLE PROVIDE MUCH, PERHAPS 
MOST, OF AL-QA\'IDA\'S MONEY. REPORTING - INCLUDING 
INTERVIEWS WITH DETAINEES - INDICATES THAT SAUDI DONORS 
ARE SENDING TENS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS 
DIRECTLY TO AL-QA\'IDA FUNDRAISERS THROUGH BANKS, HAWALA 
DEALERS, AND CASH COURIERS. CUTTING OFF THIS FLOW - 
THROUGH PUBLIC OR NON-PUBLIC MEANS - WOULD SERIOUSLY 
IMPEDE THE AL-QA\'IDA LEADERSHIP\'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE 
GROUP\'S COHESION AND SPONSOR NEW ATTACKS. 
 
UNFORTUNATELY, REPORTING SELDOM PROVIDES THE TRUE NAMES OF 
DONORS OR FUNDRAISERS. IN MANY CASES, REPORTING REFERS 
ONLY TO NICKNAMES, HONORIFIC TITLES, OR COVER NAMES (\"NOMS 
DE GUERRE\"). IN ONLY A FEW CASES, SUCH AS UBAYDAH AL- 
QAHTANI, HAS THERE BEEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY THE 
PROBABLE TRUE NAME OF THE PERSON. ADDITIONAL REPORTING 
AND DETAINEE INTERVIEWS HAVE PROVIDED SOME CLUES THAT 
COULD HELP IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL DONORS; HOWEVER, SUCH 
IDENTIFICATIONS WILL REQUIRE VIGOROUS ANALYSIS AND 
QUESTIONING OF KEY SUSPECTS. 
 
-- FIRST, THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INDIVIDUAL DONORS ARE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE SHARPLY NARROWS THE POSSIBLE RANGE OF 
SUSPECTS. MOST MAJOR DONORS PROBABLY ARE WEALTHY 
BUSINESSMEN OR MEMBERS OF WEALTHY BUSINESS FAMILIES. 
 
-- SECOND, THE DONORS PROBABLY ARE IDEOLOGICALLY COMMITTED 
TO AL-QA\'IDA. OUR REPORTING INDICATES THAT THEY WANT AL- 
QA\'IDA TO LAUNCH ATTACKS. THEY ARE NOT JUST PAYING MONEY 
IN EXCHANGE FOR \"PROTECTION\" (THAT IS, AS A BRIBE TO KEEP 
AL-QA\'IDA FROM ATTACKING THEIR INTERESTS). 
 
-- FINALLY, MANY OF THE DONORS PROBABLY KNOW EACH OTHER 
AND MAY EVEN COOPERATE. ONE SENIOR AL-QA\'IDA DETAINEE, 
FOR EXAMPLE, NOTED THAT AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCE COMMITTEE HAD 
 
A BUSINESS SUBCOMMITTEE WHOSE DUTIES INCLUDED FUNDRAISING. 
SOME REPORTED DONORS AND FUNDRAISERS, SUCH AS WA\'IL 
JULAYDAN, MAINTAIN BUSINESS, CHARITABLE, AND PERSONAL 
CONNECTIONS WITH EACH OTHER, STRENGTHENING OUR SUSPICION 
THAT A LOOSE DONORS\' NETWORK EXISTS. 
 
GIVEN THESE FACTORS, WE HOPE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU BEGINNING 
IN LATE FEBRUARY OR EARLY MARCH OF THIS YEAR IN A DETAILED 
DISCUSSION OF INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION RELATED TO TWO 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LINKED TO AL-QA\'IDA - SHAYKH ADIL 
BATTERJEE AND WA\'IL JULAYDAN. THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION, WE 
HOPE TO GAIN A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THEIR TIES TO 
AL-QA\'IDA AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY OTHER FINANCIAL 
SUPPORTERS OF TERRORISTS. INDEED, JULAYDAN COULD PROVIDE 
INFORMATION ON OTHER DONORS AND FUNDRAISERS, WHICH MAY BE 
MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAKING FURTHER ACTION AGAINST 
JULAYDAN.   EVEN IF THEY DO NOT COOPERATE, PUTTING 
TOGETHER US AND SAUDI INFORMATION ON BATTERJEE\'S AND 
JULAYDAN\'S PAST AND CURRENT TIES TO AL-QA\'IDA AND OTHER 
POSSIBLE DONORS SHOULD ALLOW IMPROVED ASSESSMENTS OF THE 
GROUP\'S FINANCIAL NETWORK. 
 
CAPTURING AND QUESTIONING FUNDRAISERS, SUCH AS UBAYDAH AL- 
QAHTANI, SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE KEY LEADS TO THE NETWORK. A 
HIGH PRIORITY IS CAPTURING THE HEAD OF AL-QA\'IDA\'S FINANCE 
COMMITTEE, SHAYKH SA\'ID AL-MASRI. ALTHOUGH HE IS 
EGYPTIAN, SHAYKH SA\'ID MAY WELL HAVE DETAILED INFORMATION 
ON DONORS FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: MASS, PREL, PHUM, PINS, PINR 
SUBJECT: REVISED GUIDANCE REGARDING LEAHY AMENDMENTS AND 
U.S. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: (A) 99 STATE 103806, (B) 99 STATE 085337 
 
1.  THIS TASKER HAS BEEN CLEARED BY HR/RMA/CSEP FOR SEP 
POSTS.  THIS IS AN ACTION CABLE - SEE PARAGRAPHS 8-13 FOR 
DETAILS. 
 
        SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (A)  THIS CABLE REPRESENTS A REVISION OF PREVIOUS 
GUIDANCE (REFS A AND B) CONCERNING IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE 
AND DEFENSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS RELATED TO PROVIDING U.S. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        STATE   034981  061828Z 
FUNDS TO, AND TRAINING OF, UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES (THE \"LEAHY AMENDMENTS\"). 
 
(B)  THIS ACTION CABLE DOES NOT GRANT A \"CLEAN SLATE\" TO 
UNITS IN CASES WHERE IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONCLUDED THAT 
THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT UNITS HAVE COMMITTED GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, OR A CLEAN SLATE FOR PREVIOUS 
ACTIONS BY UNITS FOR WHICH A DETERMINATION HAS NOT YET 
BEEN MADE.  ANY UNIT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS ALREADY 
IDENTIFIED AS INELIGIBLE, SHALL REMAIN INELIGIBLE FOR 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING UNTIL 
FURTHER DECISION.  INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DEEMED 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY 
A SECURITY FORCE UNIT, REGARDLESS OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME, 
WILL BE REPORTED BY POST AND WILL BE ADDRESSED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THIS ACTION 
CABLE. 
 
(C)  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE \"STATE LEAHY 
AMENDMENT,\" SECTION 556 OF THE FY 2002 FOREIGN OPERATIONS, 
EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
(FOAA), PROVIDES THAT NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY 
THAT ACT MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT SUCH UNIT HAS COMMITTED GROSS HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN 
MET.  THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE \"DOD LEAHY 
AMENDMENT,\" SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD APPROPRIATIONS 
ACT, CONTAINS A SIMILAR PROVISION REGARDING DOD-FUNDED 
TRAINING PROGRAMS. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        STATE   034981  061828Z 
(D)  PARAGRAPHS 8-13 PROVIDE REVISED GUIDANCE ON 
IMPLEMENTING THESE TWO PROVISIONS.  IN IMPLEMENTING THE 
LAW, THIS ACTION CABLE REQUIRES POSTS TO REPORT TO THE 
DEPARTMENT OF STATE ANY INFORMATION THAT COULD REASONABLY 
BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A GROSS VIOLATION 
OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING 
OR SLATED TO RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN 
DOD-FUNDED TRAINING.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WILL NOT RESULT 
IN AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A DEPARTMENTAL REVIEW 
THAT COULD RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA- 
FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. IF THE 
DEPARTMENT DETERMINES THAT THESE REPORTS CONSTITUTE 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY A 
UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES AND THAT 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MET, DEPARTMENT WILL 
GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE HOST 
GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), IDENTIFYING 
THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF 
RESTRICTIONS ON DOD-FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE UNITS. 
 
BACKGROUND. 
 
3.  THE FIRST FORM OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPEARED 
IN THE FY 1997 FOAA.  AT THAT TIME IT APPLIED ONLY TO 
INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL (INC) FUNDING.  BEGINNING 
IN FY 1998 A SIMILAR PROVISION WAS ENACTED WHICH AFFECTED 
ALL FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER THE FOAA - NOT JUST 
COUNTERNARCOTICS FUNDS - AND SINCE THAT TIME VERSIONS OF 
THE PROVISION HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ANNUALLY. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 05        STATE   034981  061828Z 
 
4.  STATE LEAHY PROVISION:  THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE 
STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT, SECTION 556 OF THE FY 2002 FOAA, 
READS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT:  NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT 
MAY BE PROVIDED TO ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE HAS CREDIBLE 
EVIDENCE THAT SUCH UNIT HAS COMMITTED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS, UNLESS THE SECRETARY DETERMINES AND REPORTS 
TO THE COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF 
SUCH COUNTRY IS TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES UNIT TO 
JUSTICE:  PROVIDED, THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION SHALL BE 
CONSTRUED TO WITHHOLD FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT 
FROM ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY 
NOT CREDIBLY ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED IN GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS; PROVIDED FURTHER, THAT IN THE EVENT THAT 
FUNDS ARE WITHHELD FROM ANY UNIT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION, 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHALL PROMPTLY INFORM THE FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENT OF THE BASIS FOR SUCH ACTION AND SHALL, TO THE 
MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE, ASSIST THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT 
IN TAKING EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE 
MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES TO JUSTICE.  END TEXT. 
 
5.  THE FIRST FORM OF THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPEARED IN 
SECTION 8130 OF THE FY 1999 DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
WHICH PROHIBITED DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS INVOLVING A 
UNIT OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES \"IF THE 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED CREDIBLE INFORMATION 
 
SIPDIS 
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT A MEMBER OF SUCH UNIT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 06        STATE   034981  061828Z 
HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS...\" UNLESS 
CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET.  BEGINNING IN THE FY 
2000 DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACT, HOWEVER, THE CLAUSE \"A MEMBER 
OF SUCH UNIT\" WAS DELETED.  SINCE FY 2000, THE DOD LEAHY 
PROVISION, LIKE THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION, HAS REFERRED TO 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITY FORCE UNITS, RATHER 
THAN MEMBERS OF SUCH UNITS. 
 
6.  DOD LEAHY PROVISION:  THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE DOD 
LEAHY AMENDMENT, SECTION 8080 OF THE FY 2003 DOD 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, READS AS FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT:  (A) PROHIBITION - NONE OF THE FUNDS MADE 
AVAILABLE BY THIS ACT MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT ANY TRAINING 
PROGRAM INVOLVING A UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY IF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAS RECEIVED 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE THAT THE 
UNIT HAS COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, 
UNLESS ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN. 
 
(B) MONITORING - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, IN CONSULTATION 
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, SHALL ENSURE THAT PRIOR TO A 
DECISION TO CONDUCT ANY TRAINING PROGRAM REFERRED TO IN 
SUBSECTION (A), FULL CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO ALL 
CREDIBLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE 
RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES. 
 
(C) WAIVER - THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, AFTER CONSULTATION 
WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MAY WAIVE THE PROHIBITION IN 
SUBSECTION (A) IF HE DETERMINES THAT SUCH WAIVER IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 07        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REQUIRED BY EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. 
 
(D) REPORT - NOT MORE THAN 15 DAYS AFTER THE EXERCISE OF 
ANY WAIVER UNDER SUBSECTION (C), THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
SHALL SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DEFENSE 
COMMITTEES DESCRIBING THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE 
PURPOSE AND DURATION OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM, THE UNITED 
STATES FORCES AND THE FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES INVOLVED IN 
THE TRAINING PROGRAM, AND THE INFORMATION RELATING TO 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THAT NECESSITATES THE WAIVER.  END 
TEXT. 
 
7. THE STATE DEPARTMENT LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO ALL 
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE ANNUAL FOAA.  PROGRAMS 
FUNDED BY FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING (FMF) GRANTS AND 
LOANS, INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(INCLE) FUNDS, INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND 
TRAINING (IMET) FUNDS AND PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS (PKO) 
FUNDS AND CERTAIN NONPROLIFERATION, ANTI-TERRORISM, 
DEMINING AND RELATED PROGRAMS (NADR) FUNDS - E.G., ANTI- 
TERRORISM ASSISTANCE ARE OFTEN ORIENTED TO SECURITY 
FORCES.  OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FUNDED, E.G., BY 
ECONOMIC SUPPORT FUNDS (ESF), FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT (FSA) 
FUNDS, ASSISTANCE FOR EASTERN EUROPE AND THE BALTIC STATES 
(AEEB AKA SEED) FUNDS, AND DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE (DA) 
FUNDS AND CERTAIN PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE NADR ACCOUNT 
(E.G., DEMINING ASSISTANCE) TYPICALLY DO NOT INVOLVE 
SECURITY FORCES, ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COUNTRIES\' SECURITY 
FORCES MAY RECEIVE THESE TYPES OF ASSISTANCE.  ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS TAKE A WIDE ARRAY OF FORMS, INCLUDING: PROVISION 
OF COMMODITIES, EQUIPMENT, OR OTHER GOODS; TRAINING AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 08        STATE   034981  061828Z 
EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS; SUPPORT 
SERVICES, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS, MAINTENANCE 
OF EQUIPMENT, AND CONFERENCE ATTENDANCE OR SUPPORT; GRANTS 
OR LOANS TO PROCURE GOODS AND SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF 
SECURITY FORCES; AND CASH TRANSFERS OF FUNDS.  THE STATE 
LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO THESE AND ALL OTHER FORMS OF 
ASSISTANCE USING FOAA-APPROPRIATED FUNDS IN ALL COUNTRIES 
TO WHICH THE U.S. PROVIDES SUCH ASSISTANCE. (NOTE:  THE 
EXPORT-IMPORT BANK (EX-IM) HAS ADVISED THE DEPARTMENT THAT 
IT TAKES THE POSITION THAT IN THE CASE OF PURCHASES BY 
SECURITY FORCES, THE LEAHY AMENDMENT APPLIES TO ITS LOAN 
AND GUARANTEE PROGRAMS.  ACCORDINGLY, HOST COUNTRY 
PROGRAMS THAT WILL BENEFIT FROM OR RECEIVE EX-IM SUPPORT 
SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE FOAA-FUNDED 
PROGRAMS DESCRIBED IN THIS CABLE IF THEY INVOLVE PROVISION 
OF SUPPORT TO SECURITY FORCES.) 
 
8.  THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES TO USE OF FUNDS MADE 
AVAILABLE UNDER THE ANNUAL DOD APPROPRIATIONS ACTS. 
EXAMPLES OF TRAINING PROGRAMS FUNDED WITH DOD FUNDS ARE 
LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 19. 
 
9. PRIOR-YEAR ASSISTANCE:  POSTS SHOULD FOLLOW PROCEDURES 
DETAILED HEREIN WITH REGARD TO USE OF ANY PREVIOUS YEARS\' 
FOAA FUNDS OR ANY TRAINING USING PRIOR YEARS\' DOD FUNDS 
THAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO HOST NATION SECURITY FORCES. 
 
10.  THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE FOAA AND THE DEFENSE 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT VERSIONS OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENT ARE 
SIMILAR.  AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF 
STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, THIS CABLE:  (A) SETS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 09        STATE   034981  061828Z 
FORTH A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING BOTH THE STATE AND DOD 
LEAHY AMENDMENTS; AND (B) ESTABLISHES A STRONGER 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. ASSISTANCE AND OBSERVANCE BY 
RECIPIENT NATION SECURITY FORCES OF INTERNATIONALLY 
ACCEPTED HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. 
 
11.  AS POSTS REVIEW AND IMPLEMENT GUIDANCE DETAILED 
BELOW, THEY SHOULD KEEP IN MIND TWO OVERRIDING POLICY 
CONCERNS: 
 
(A)  U.S. ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE FOAA - WHETHER IN 
THE FORM OF FUNDS, OTHER ASSISTANCE, OR TRAINING - SHOULD 
NOT BE PROVIDED TO UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY FORCES THAT 
HAVE ENGAGED IN GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DOD 
FUNDING SHOULD NOT BE PROVIDED FOR TRAINING INVOLVING SUCH 
UNITS; AND 
 
(B)  THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO LEVERAGE ITS 
ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING TO ENCOURAGE HOST NATION 
GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT SUCH VIOLATIONS AND TO HOLD PERSONS 
CREDIBLY BELIEVED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH VIOLATIONS 
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS, INCLUDING BY BRINGING SUCH 
PERSONS TO JUSTICE. 
 
POSTS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT DOD DOES EXECUTE OR IS 
INVOLVED IN MANY OF THE FOAA-SPONSORED PROGRAMS TO WHICH 
THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION APPLIES (E.G., CERTAIN PROGRAMS 
FUNDED WITH FMF, IMET, INC, PKO, OR NADR FUNDS).  COUNTRY 
TEAM WILL NEED TO COORDINATE ACCORDINGLY TO ENSURE THAT 
THE CORRECT STATUTORY PROVISION (EITHER SECTION 556 OR 
SECTION 8080) IS APPLIED IN ANY RELEVANT INSTANCES IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 10        STATE   034981  061828Z 
WHICH THE DEPARTMENT HAS CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO 
NOT/NOT APPLY EITHER TO FMS SALES, OR TO ISSUANCE OF 
LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL MUNITIONS EXPORTS, WHEN THESE ARE 
NOT FUNDED BY U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE. 
 
ACTION. 
 
INCIDENT-RELATED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. 
 
12.  POSTS IN COUNTRIES THAT RECEIVE FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR IN COUNTRIES WHERE UNITS OF FOREIGN SECURITY 
FORCES ARE INVOLVED IN DOD TRAINING ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE 
PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. 
DEPARTMENT PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LEAHY 
AMENDMENTS IN 1998 AND 1999.  THE INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED 
IN THIS CABLE REPLACE THIS PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.  POSTS 
SHOULD REVIEW THEIR PROCEDURES AND ENSURE THEY ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT REQUIREMENTS, AS SET FORTH BELOW. 
 
13.  ANY TIME THROUGHOUT THE YEAR THAT A POST BECOMES 
AWARE OF ANY INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH 
REASONABLY COULD BE DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE INFORMATION OF A 
GROSS VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OF THE HOST 
NATION\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING OR PROPOSED TO RECEIVE 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, 
AND REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., 
STATE, DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, 
ETC.), POST SHOULD SO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT BY CABLE. 
POST SHOULD DRAW ON THE EXPERTISE OF DAOS/SAOS IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 11        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REPORTING SUCH INFORMATION.  POST SHOULD, TO THE EXTENT 
PRACTICABLE, IDENTIFY THE UNIT THAT HAS ALLEGEDLY 
COMMITTED THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND INCLUDE POST\'S 
VIEW AS TO WHETHER THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS RISES TO 
THE LEVEL OF BEING A GROSS VIOLATION AND WHETHER IT 
BELIEVES THE INFORMATION IS CREDIBLE.  CABLES SHOULD BE 
SLUGGED ACTION FOR THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU, WITH 
PM, DRL, H, INR, L, INL, AND OTHER STATE AND DEFENSE 
DEPARTMENT BUREAUS AND OTHER U.S. AGENCIES, AS 
APPROPRIATE, SLUGGED FOR INFO.  REPORTS OF INCIDENTS WHICH 
COULD BE DEEMED GROSS VIOLATIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN 
AUTOMATIC TERMINATION OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING, BUT WILL TRIGGER A REVIEW BY REGIONAL 
BUREAUS, PM, DRL AND OTHERS, AS APPROPRIATE, WHICH COULD 
RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO TERMINATE FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. 
 
14.  REGIONAL BUREAUS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE 
DEPARTMENT\'S RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF INCIDENTS UNDER 
PARAGRAPH 13.  IN CASES WHERE THE DEPARTMENT, AFTER 
CONSIDERING THE POSITIONS OF THE REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM 
AND OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS, DETERMINES THERE IS A NEED FOR 
FURTHER REVIEW, THE REGIONAL BUREAU WILL SO ADVISE POST 
AND WILL MOVE TO RESOLVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON A CASE- 
BY-CASE BASIS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, WITH DOD OR OTHER 
RELEVANT AGENCIES. 
 
15.  IF ANY CONCERNED BUREAU BELIEVES THERE IS IN FACT 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT A SPECIFIC UNIT OR UNITS RECEIVING 
FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING HAS 
COMMITTED A GROSS VIOLATION OR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 12        STATE   034981  061828Z 
RIGHTS, A MEMORANDUM SHALL BE PREPARED FOR DECISION BY THE 
SECRETARY.  IN ANY CASE WHERE THE SECRETARY DETERMINES 
 
SIPDIS 
THAT THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF SUCH VIOLATION OR 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS BY ANY UNIT OR UNITS OF A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA-FUNDED 
ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, THE REGIONAL BUREAU 
WILL GENERALLY ADVISE POST TO DELIVER A DEMARCHE TO THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT NOTIFYING IT OF THE INCIDENT(S), 
IDENTIFYING THE UNIT(S) INVOLVED, AND (WHERE APPLICABLE) 
ADVISING THE HOST GOVERNMENT OF ANY RESTRICTIONS ON DOD- 
FUNDED TRAINING OR FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE THAT WILL APPLY 
WITH RESPECT TO SUCH UNIT(S).  IN SUCH CASES, DEPARTMENT 
MAY TAKE SUCH ACTIONS AS: REQUIRING ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS 
IN FUTURE AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED 
(INCLUDING, E.G., REVISING LOAS TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE 
REQUIRING RECIPIENT GOVERNMENTS NOT TO TRANSFER FMF-ORIGIN 
DEFENSE ITEMS TO OFFENDING UNITS); NOTIFYING CONGRESS OF 
THE COUNTRY\'S FAILURE TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION; OR EVEN 
TERMINATING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO THE COUNTRY.  PLEASE 
NOTE THAT NOTHING IN THESE PROCEDURES OR THIS ACTION CABLE 
SUPERCEDES THE PROCESS FOR CASE-BY-CASE APPROVAL AND 
VETTING AS PERFORMED BY REGIONAL BUREAUS, DRL, PM AND 
OTHER RELEVANT BUREAUS WITH INR\'S SUPPORT WHEN DOD IS 
VETTING UNITS OR INDIVIDUALS FOR TRAINING. 
 
16.  DEPENDING ON CIRCUMSTANCES, DEPARTMENT MAY DIRECT 
POSTS TO DEMARCHE HOST GOVERNMENTS EVEN IN CASES WHERE 
EVIDENCE IS NOT DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A TERMINATION 
OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING BUT WHERE 
THE CAUSE OF HUMAN RIGHTS COULD BE ADVANCED.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
POST MIGHT BE ADVISED TO REMIND THE COUNTRY IN QUESTION OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 13        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE RELEVANT LEAHY AMENDMENT AND THE 
FACT THAT LEAHY VIOLATIONS MAY RESULT IN THE TERMINATION 
OF FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR DOD-FUNDED TRAINING. 
 
APPORTIONMENT AND FUNDING REQUEST REQUIREMENTS. 
 
17.  BUREAUS SHALL INCLUDE IN ALL REQUESTS FOR PROGRAM 
FUNDS (E.G., VIA ALLOCATION MEMORANDA OR APPORTIONMENT 
REQUESTS) WITH RESPECT TO ESF, FMF, PKO, IMET, NADR AND 
ALL OTHER FOAA-FUNDED ASSISTANCE TO BE PROVIDED TO 
SECURITY FORCES OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY, A STATEMENT 
INDICATING THAT THE APPROPRIATE REGIONAL BUREAU IS NOT 
AWARE OF CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS BY ANY SECURITY FORCE UNITS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE IN 
THE PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR COUNTRIES TO WHICH THE 
ASSISTANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED.  FOR COUNTRIES WHERE THE 
DEPARTMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIBLE EVIDENCE EXISTS 
THAT SUCH UNIT RECEIVING OR PROJECTED TO RECEIVE 
ASSISTANCE HAS COMMITTED GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, 
REGIONAL BUREAU SHALL INCLUDE IN ITS REQUEST WHAT 
EFFECTIVE MEASURES THAT COUNTRY IS TAKING TO BRING 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY FORCES UNIT TO JUSTICE 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEAHY AMENDMENT (IN CASES INVOLVING 
DOD TRAINING, WHETHER AND WHAT CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN) AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION (E.G., ASSURANCES 
THE COUNTRY MAY HAVE PROVIDED THAT U.S. ASSISTANCE WILL 
NOT BE PROVIDED TO THAT UNIT). 
 
18.  THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ESTABLISHING A \"NAME CHECK\" UNIT IN INR THAT WOULD RUN 
QUERIES AGAINST INR\'S ELECTRONIC DATABASES TO IDENTIFY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 14        STATE   034981  061828Z 
REPORTS ON SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES.  IF THE UNIT 
IS ESTABLISHED, INR WOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT MATERIALS TO 
THE BUREAUS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING A DETERMINATION OF 
ELIGIBILITY.  IF THE UNIT IS NOT ESTABLISHED, INR WILL 
HELP AS IT CAN BUT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHECK MORE THAN A 
FEW NAMES AT A TIME. 
 
DISCUSSION AND DEFINITIONS. 
 
19.  AS A MATTER OF LONGSTANDING POLICY, THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT CANDIDATES FOR ALL U.S.-SPONSORED 
TRAINING BE EVALUATED BY POSTS FOR A NUMBER OF 
DISQUALIFYING FACTORS.  TRAINING REQUESTS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE VETTED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  IF TRAINING IS 
SCHEDULED FOR UNITS, (E.G., MOBILE TRAINING TEAMS (MTTS) 
AND MOBILE EDUCATION TEAMS (METS)), POST IS NOT REQUIRED 
TO SCREEN EACH MEMBER OF THE UNIT(S) SCHEDULED FOR 
TRAINING.  INSTEAD, POST SHOULD REVIEW THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
RECORD OF THE UNIT AS A WHOLE.  IN CASES WHERE TRAINING IS 
SCHEDULED FOR AN INDIVIDUAL, IT CAN PROCEED IF THERE IS NO 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS COMMITTED GROSS 
VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  (OF COURSE, POST RETAINS THE 
AUTHORITY TO DENY APPROVAL FOR TRAINING TO A CANDIDATE WHO 
DOES NOT PASS OTHER FACTORS OF THE SCREENING PROCESS, SUCH 
AS DRUG TRAFFICKING, CORRUPTION, HEALTH, CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY, AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH U.S. 
FOREIGN POLICY GOALS.) 
 
20.  ACTIVITIES COVERED UNDER THE DOD LEAHY PROVISIONS 
INCLUDE ALL DOD-FUNDED TRAINING PROGRAMS SUCH AS JOINT 
COMBINED EXCHANGES FOR TRAINING (JCETS), COUNTERNARCOTICS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 15        STATE   034981  061828Z 
TRAINING, COMBATANT COMMANDERS INITIATIVE FUND, AND THE 
DOD REGIONAL COUNTERTERRORISM FELLOWSHIP TRAINING PROGRAM. 
 
21.  UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES:  THE PHRASE \"UNIT OF THE 
SECURITY FORCES\" IS NOT DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION, BUT 
SHOULD BE APPLIED FOR THE PURPOSES OUTLINED IN THIS CABLE 
TO INCLUDE ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS OF MILITARY, POLICE, OR 
ANY OTHER SECURITY FORCES.  THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS DO 
NOT/NOT APPLY TO THE WHOLE OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT\'S 
MILITARY, POLICE, OR OTHER SECURITY FORCES, BUT RATHER TO 
THE SPECIFIC COMPONENT UNITS RECEIVING TRAINING OR 
ASSISTANCE.  THE QUESTION OF WHAT LEVEL OR ENTITY 
CONSTITUTES A \"UNIT\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LEAHY 
AMENDMENTS WILL BE DETERMINED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
THE SENATE REPORT ACCOMPANYING THE FY 2002 FOAA PROVIDES 
THAT THE TERM \"UNIT\" IS TO BE \"CONSTRUED AS THE SMALLEST 
OPERATIONAL GROUP IN THE FIELD THAT HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN 
THE REPORTED VIOLATION.\"  AS A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB, POST 
SHOULD CONSIDER THE LOWEST ORGANIZATIONAL ELEMENT OF A 
SECURITY FORCE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING COMMAND AND 
DISCIPLINE OVER ITS MEMBERS. IN DETERMINING THE ENTITY TO 
BE VETTED WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY, POLICE, OR 
PARAMILITARY FORCES, POST SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 
PURPOSE OF THE FORCE, ITS UNIQUE COMMAND STRUCTURE AS WELL 
AS THE SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS AT ISSUE.  INABILITY TO 
IDENTIFY A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AS A PERPETRATOR WOULD 
NOT PRECLUDE A CONCLUSION THAT THE UNIT HAS COMMITTED A 
GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS IF FACTS OTHERWISE 
JUSTIFY SUCH A CONCLUSION.  POSTS SHOULD KEEP TRACK OF 
ALLEGATIONS OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS INVOLVING 
ANY UNIT OF THE SECURITY FORCES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 16        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THAT UNIT IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING TRAINING OR ASSISTANCE. 
 
22.  GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS:  ALTHOUGH THE TERM 
\"GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS\" IS NOT DEFINED IN THESE 
PROVISIONS, A SIMILAR TERM IS DEFINED IN SECTION 502B(D) 
OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT (FAA), AND POSTS SHOULD USE 
THAT DEFINITION AS A GUIDE: \"THE TERM \'GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS\' INCLUDES TORTURE 
OR CRUEL, INHUMAN, OR DEGRADING TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT, 
PROLONGED DETENTION WITHOUT CHARGES AND TRIAL, CAUSING THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF PERSONS BY THE ABDUCTION AND CLANDESTINE 
DETENTION OF THOSE PERSONS, AND OTHER FLAGRANT DENIAL OF 
THE RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, OR THE SECURITY OF PERSON.\" 
 
23.  EXISTING REPORTING PROCEDURES FOR THE ANNUAL DRL 
HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT TO CONGRESS ARE UNCHANGED BY THIS 
ACTION CABLE:  THE DEPARTMENT\'S ESTABLISHED HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORTING PROCEDURES REQUIRE POSTS TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON 
INSTANCES OF GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS KNOWN OR 
RELIABLY PRESUMED TO HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED BY OFFICIALS OR 
AGENCIES OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  DEPARTMENT GUIDANCE FOR 
THIS ANNUAL REPORT DOES NOT ASK POSTS TO REPORT ALL HUMAN 
RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY OFFICIALS OR AGENCIES OF FOREIGN 
GOVERNMENTS BUT RATHER A SAMPLING.  HOWEVER, FOR THE 
PURPOSES OF LEAHY, POSTS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ANY 
INFORMATION REGARDING INCIDENTS WHICH REASONABLY COULD BE 
DEEMED TO BE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF GROSS VIOLATIONS BY ANY 
UNIT OF THE HOST NATION\'S SECURITY FORCES RECEIVING FOAA- 
FUNDED ASSISTANCE OR INVOLVED IN DOD-FUNDED TRAINING, 
REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF SUCH INFORMATION (E.G., STATE, 
DOD, DAOS/SAOS, OTHER POSTS, NGOS, MEDIA REPORTS, ETC.). 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 17        STATE   034981  061828Z 
THE REQUIREMENT TO IMPLEMENT THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS MAKES IT 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THAT POSTS BE ALERT AND REPORT 
PROMPTLY TO DEPARTMENT WHENEVER ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION 
BECOMES KNOWN TO POST. 
 
24.  CREDIBLE EVIDENCE:  WHILE THE DEPARTMENT RETAINS 
AUTHORITY FOR ALL FINAL DECISIONS REGARDING SPECIFIC CASES 
- INCLUDING THE \"CREDIBILITY\" OF EVIDENCE OF GROSS 
VIOLATIONS - IT MUST RELY, AT LEAST IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, 
ON POST\'S JUDGMENT IN REVIEWING AND ASSESSING AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION FOR ITS RELIABILITY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS 
SOURCE.  POST NEED NOT SUBMIT REPORTS THAT IT CONFIDENTLY 
BELIEVES TO BE UNFOUNDED.  IF IN DOUBT ABOUT THE 
CREDIBILITY OF INFORMATION, POST SHOULD SUBMIT TO THE 
DEPARTMENT AND SO NOTE. 
 
25.  WITH REGARD TO THE MEANING OF \"EVIDENCE,\" REPORT 
LANGUAGE ACCOMPANYING THE FY 1999 FOAA PROVIDES:  \"THE 
CONFEREES DO NOT INTEND THAT THE EVIDENCE MUST BE 
ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW.\"  HOWEVER, NEITHER THE 
LEGISLATION NOR ACCOMPANYING REPORT LANGUAGE DEFINES 
\"CREDIBLE.\"  POST SHOULD APPLY A RULE OF REASON IN 
INTERPRETING \"CREDIBLE\" IN VIEW OF THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF 
THE PROVISIONS, BEARING IN MIND THAT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT 
IS SEEKING IS INFORMATION DESERVING OF CONFIDENCE AS A 
BASIS FOR DECISION-MAKING.  INFORMATION THAT CAN BE 
CORROBORATED THROUGH INDEPENDENT SOURCES STRENGTHENS THE 
CREDIBILITY OF SUCH REPORTS.  NGOS CAN BE A VALUABLE 
SOURCE OF INFORMATION.  WEIGHT TO BE ACCORDED PARTICULAR 
REPORTS REQUIRES CAREFUL JUDGMENT AND MAY TURN ON 
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES - E.G., THE RECORD OF THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 18        STATE   034981  061828Z 
GOVERNMENTAL OR NON-GOVERNMENTAL GROUP FOR ACCURATE AND 
IMPARTIAL REPORTING AND THE DEGREE OF DETAIL PROVIDED. 
ALL EVIDENCE - BOTH SUPPORTING AND REFUTING - SHOULD BE 
TAKEN AS A WHOLE IN ASSESSING WHETHER EVIDENCE IS 
\"CREDIBLE\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. 
 
26.  PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT LEGAL AND POLICY ISSUES MAY 
ARISE IN CASES WHERE A PERPETRATOR OF A GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATION HAS CHANGED UNITS, OR EVIDENCE IS NOT TIED 
DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC UNITS.  IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE 
LEAHY AMENDMENTS AND RELATED STATE DEPARTMENT POLICY, 
POSTS SHOULD IDENTIFY, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, ALL 
SECURITY FORCE UNITS WITH WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM 
THERE IS CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF HAVING COMMITTED SUCH 
VIOLATIONS HAS BEEN A MEMBER, FROM THE DATE OF THE ALLEGED 
OFFENSE TO THE PRESENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SECURITY FORCE 
MEMBER ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED A VIOLATION WHILE ATTACHED TO 
UNIT X, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO UNIT Y, POST 
SHOULD ADVISE OF THAT PERSON\'S RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH 
UNITS.  POST SHOULD PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE 
SECURITY FORCE ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING ITS STRUCTURE AND 
HIERARCHY, AND INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVED. 
 
27.  EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS 
TO JUSTICE:  FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATE LEAHY AMENDMENT, 
RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE HISTORY CONTAINS LANGUAGE REGARDING 
THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS TO \"FACE IMPARTIAL 
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OR APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY 
DISCIPLINARY ACTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL LAW.\" 
ORDINARILY, SOME CLEAR ACTION NEEDS TO OCCUR, E.G., 
INVESTIGATIONS, FORMAL ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGAL PROCEEDING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 19        STATE   034981  061828Z 
AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION, OR 
OTHER ACTIONS DEMONSTRATING THE HOST NATION IS PROCEEDING 
TO BRING THE RESPONSIBLE PERSONS TO JUSTICE.  THE MERE 
TRANSFER FROM A UNIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF HAVING 
COMMITTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, 
CONSTITUTE THE NECESSARY EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO BRING THE 
RESPONSIBLE MEMBER(S) OF THE UNIT TO JUSTICE.  AN 
INVESTIGATION/PROSECUTION PROCESS NEED NOT HAVE BEEN 
CONCLUDED, NOR IS IT NECESSARY THAT THE PROCESS LED TO A 
CONVICTION.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MERE OPENING OF A 
FORMAL INVESTIGATION DOES NOT, IN AND OF ITSELF, 
CONSTITUTE \"EFFECTIVE MEASURES.\" 
 
THE REALISTIC CHANCE FOR SUCCESSFUL AND IMPARTIAL 
CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION, LEADING TO IMPARTIAL 
TRIAL AND APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT IF CONVICTED, SHOULD BE 
ASSESSED.  THE INSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE HOST NATION 
MILITARY AND CIVILIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM IS RELEVANT IN MAKING 
THE NECESSARY JUDGMENTS. 
 
NOTE THAT THE DOD LEAHY PROVISION IS WORDED DIFFERENTLY 
THAN THE STATE LEAHY PROVISION ON THIS POINT, THE FORMER 
REQUIRING THAT \"ALL NECESSARY CORRECTIVE STEPS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN\" BEFORE DOD-FUNDED TRAINING INVOLVING A UNIT THAT 
HAS TRIGGERED LEAHY CAN TAKE PLACE.  THIS PHRASE IS NOT 
DEFINED IN THE LEGISLATION. 
 
28.  POST SHOULD DESIGNATE AN EMBASSY POINT OF CONTACT FOR 
THE LEAHY AMENDMENTS. AS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARE ONE 
AMONG A SERIES OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT ARE TAKEN INTO 
CONSIDERATION BEFORE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE (E.G., COUNTER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 20        STATE   034981  061828Z 
NARCOTICS, CORRUPTION), DEPARTMENT SUGGESTS THAT EMBASSY 
POC BE IN A POSITION TO COORDINATE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW 
WITH ALL RELEVANT MEMBERS OF THE COUNTRY TEAM. 
 
29.  AGENCIES OTHER THAN DOD (E.G., DEA, JUSTICE) 
RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH 
SECURITY FORCES SHOULD ENSURE SIMILAR COORDINATION AND 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTRY TEAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THIS GUIDANCE. 
 
30.  DEPARTMENT WILL WORK WITH POSTS TO ENSURE THAT NGOS 
THAT IMPLEMENT FOAA-FUNDED PROGRAMS WITH SECURITY FORCES 
ARE INSTRUCTED OF THE NEED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LEAHY 
LIMITATIONS. 
 
31.  POC AT DEPARTMENT OF STATE IS CHRISTOPHER DUVALL, 
BUREAU OF POLITICAL-MILITARY AFFAIRS, 202-736-4019,

SUBJECT: TFIZ01 REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT 
 
REF: REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT IN ADDRESS TO THE NATION 19 
MARCH 2003 
 
 
1. THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESIDENT\'S 
REMARKS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MAY BE USED AS TALKING 
POINTS WHEN DISCUSSING THE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ THAT 
BEGAN 19 MARCH 2003. 
 
2. BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: THE PRESIDENT:  MY FELLOW CITIZENS, 
AT THIS HOUR, AMERICAN AND COALITION FORCES ARE IN THE 
EARLY STAGES OF MILITARY OPERATIONS TO DISARM IRAQ, TO 
FREE ITS PEOPLE AND TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM GRAVE DANGER. 
 
ON MY ORDERS, COALITION FORCES HAVE BEGUN STRIKING 
SELECTED TARGETS OF MILITARY IMPORTANCE TO UNDERMINE 
SADDAM HUSSEIN\'S ABILITY TO WAGE WAR.  THESE ARE OPENING 
STAGES OF WHAT WILL BE A BROAD AND CONCERTED CAMPAIGN. 
MORE THAN 35 COUNTRIES ARE GIVING CRUCIAL SUPPORT  -- 
FROM THE USE OF NAVAL AND AIR BASES, TO HELP WITH 
INTELLIGENCE AND LOGISTICS, TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF COMBAT 
UNITS.  EVERY NATION IN THIS COALITION HAS CHOSEN TO BEAR 
THE DUTY AND SHARE THE HONOR OF SERVING IN OUR COMMON 
DEFENSE. 
 
TO ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 
NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE PEACE OF A TROUBLED WORLD AND 
THE HOPES OF AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE NOW DEPEND ON YOU.  THAT 
TRUST IS WELL PLACED. 
 
THE ENEMIES YOU CONFRONT WILL COME TO KNOW YOUR SKILL AND 
BRAVERY.  THE PEOPLE YOU LIBERATE WILL WITNESS THE 
HONORABLE AND DECENT SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY.  IN 
THIS CONFLICT, AMERICA FACES AN ENEMY WHO HAS NO REGARD 
FOR CONVENTIONS OF WAR OR RULES OF MORALITY.  SADDAM 
HUSSEIN HAS PLACED IRAQI TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT IN CIVILIAN 
AREAS, ATTEMPTING TO USE INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
AS SHIELDS FOR HIS OWN MILITARY  --  A FINAL ATROCITY 
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. 
 
I WANT AMERICANS AND ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT COALITION 
FORCES WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SPARE INNOCENT CIVILIANS 
FROM HARM.  A CAMPAIGN ON THE HARSH TERRAIN OF A NATION AS 
LARGE AS CALIFORNIA COULD BE LONGER AND MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN SOME PREDICT.  AND HELPING IRAQIS ACHIEVE A UNITED, 
STABLE AND FREE COUNTRY WILL REQUIRE OUR SUSTAINED 
COMMITMENT. 
 
WE COME TO IRAQ WITH RESPECT FOR ITS CITIZENS, FOR THEIR 
GREAT CIVILIZATION AND FOR THE RELIGIOUS FAITHS THEY 
PRACTICE.  WE HAVE NO AMBITION IN IRAQ, EXCEPT TO REMOVE A 
THREAT AND RESTORE CONTROL OF THAT COUNTRY TO ITS OWN 
PEOPLE. 
 
I KNOW THAT THE FAMILIES OF OUR MILITARY ARE PRAYING THAT 
ALL THOSE WHO SERVE WILL RETURN SAFELY AND SOON.  MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS ARE PRAYING WITH YOU FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR 
LOVED ONES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INNOCENT.  FOR 
YOUR SACRIFICE, YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.  AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT OUR FORCES WILL BE 
COMING HOME AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IS DONE. 
 
OUR NATION ENTERS THIS CONFLICT RELUCTANTLY  --  YET, OUR 
PURPOSE IS SURE.  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES WILL NOT LIVE AT THE MERCY OF AN OUTLAW 
REGIME THAT THREATENS THE PEACE WITH WEAPONS OF MASS 
MURDER. WE WILL MEET THAT THREAT NOW, WITH OUR ARMY, AIR 
FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD AND MARINES, SO THAT WE DO NOT 
HAVE TO MEET IT LATER WITH ARMIES OF FIRE FIGHTERS AND 
POLICE AND DOCTORS ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES. 
 
NOW THAT CONFLICT HAS COME, THE ONLY WAY TO LIMIT ITS 
DURATION IS TO APPLY DECISIVE FORCE.  AND I ASSURE YOU, 
THIS WILL NOT BE A CAMPAIGN OF HALF MEASURES, AND WE WILL 
ACCEPT NO OUTCOME BUT VICTORY. 
 
MY FELLOW CITIZENS, THE DANGERS TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE 
WORLD WILL BE OVERCOME.  WE WILL PASS THROUGH THIS TIME OF 
PERIL AND CARRY ON THE WORK OF PEACE.  WE WILL DEFEND OUR 
FREEDOM.  WE WILL BRING FREEDOM TO OTHERS AND WE WILL 
PREVAIL. 
 
MAY GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY AND ALL WHO DEFEND HER.  END 
TRANSCRIPT.

UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION ON MARCH 6 \"COURAGEOUS.\" AMBASSADOR 
TARIFA ASSURED DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE THAT ALBANIA\'S 
SUPPORT FOR AMERICA ON IRAQ WAS NOT FOR POLITICAL 
EXPEDIENCY, BUT CAME FROM THE HEART, AS A RESULT OF 
\"KNOWING WHAT LIVING UNDER A DICTATORSHIP REALLY MEANS.\" 
HE SAID THAT 75 SOLDIERS WERE BEING SENT TO KUWAIT, AND 
MORE WERE BEING TRAINED FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE 
COALITION. (NOTE: AMBASSADOR TARIFA\'S INFORMATION MAY NOT 
BE CURRENT. ALBANIA IS COORDINATING WITH CENTCOM AND THE

REMAIN TO INSTABILITY. 
 
ADRIATIC CHARTER

CARRYING OUT ITS MOST SIGNIFICANT CRACKDOWN AGAINST THE 
OPPOSITION IN YEARS; SO FAR OVER 70 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. 
POSTS ARE ASKED TO REQUEST HOST GOVERNMENTS TO JOIN US IN 
CALLING FOR THE RELEASE OF THESE PRISONERS. END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS INSTITUTED THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT CRACKDOWN AGAINST THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT IN 
YEARS, BEGINNING ON MARCH 18. BY THE MORNING OF MARCH 21, 
MORE THAN 70 OPPOSITION MEMBERS HAD BEEN ARRESTED. WE ARE 
DISTURBED AT THE GOVERNMENT\'S THREAT TO PROSECUTE THOSE 
ARRESTED UNDER \"LAW 88,\" WHICH CARRIES SENTENCES OF 7 TO 
20 YEARS FOR ANYONE RECEIVING ASSISTANCE FROM THE USG. 
THE CRACKDOWN COINCIDED WITH UNCONTROLLED VERBAL ATTACKS 
AGAINST USINT FOR SEEKING TO ENCOURAGE NORMAL DEMOCRATIC 
DEVELOPMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE ARRESTS 
STATED THAT THOSE WHO HAD MET WITH USINT OFFICERS WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO ARREST.   THAT CUBA CHOSE TO MAKE THESE ARRESTS 
THE WEEK THE UN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS OPENED IS 
ESPECIALLY APPALLING. 
 
4. (C) POSTS ARE ASKED TO SHARE THE FOLLOWING TALKING 
POINTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIALS. 
BESIDES THE TALKING POINTS, WE HAVE ALSO INCLUDED THE 
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN\'S REMARKS ON THE ISSUE, MADE ON MARCH 
19. POSTS MAY WISH TO REFER TO REFTELS FOR BACKGROUND ON 
HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN CUBA. GENEVA MAY DRAW FROM POINTS 
AS APPROPRIATE.

COPENHAGEN, VIENNA, AND BERLIN: SEPTEL WILL ASK YOU TO 
SPECIFICALLY RAISE QUESTION OF CUBAN MEMBERSHIP IN 
COTONOU. YOU MAY WISH TO MAKE THIS DEMARCHE 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
 
 
TALKING POINTS 
 
-- AT LEAST 70 CUBANS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED BY STATE SECURITY 
FROM MARCH 18-21, SIMPLY FOR SEEKING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL 
RIGHTS. THAT NUMBER COULD RISE. 
 
--THIS IS NOW THE MOST EGREGIOUS ACT OF POLITICAL 
REPRESSION IN CUBA IN YEARS. 
 
--AMONG THOSE DETAINED INCLUDE MARTHA BEATRIZ ROQUE, RENE 
GOMEZ MANZANO, AND FELIX BONNE. THESE THREE LEADERS OF 
THE CUBAN OPPOSITION WERE CONDUCTING A PEACEFUL FAST 
PROTESTING THE DETENTION OF ANOTHER DISSIDENT (DR. OSCAR 
ELIAS BISCET) WHEN THEIR EVENT WAS BROKEN UP BY STATE 
SECURITY. 
 
--AMONG THE DOZENS OF CUBANS ARRESTED INCLUDE THE 
FOLLOWING LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION: 
TODOS UNIDOS LEADERS PEDRO PABLO ALVAREZ RAMOS, OSVALDO 
ALFONSO, FELIX NAVARRO, AND VICTOR ROLANDO ARROYO; 
MEMBERS OF OSWALDO PAYA\'S CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT 
JOSE DANIEL FERRER CASTILLO AND LUIS ENRIQUE FERRER 
CASTILLO; THE LEADER OF THE INDEPENDENT LIBRARY MOVEMENT, 
JISELLE DELGADO; AND, INDEPENDENT JOURNALISTS RAUL RIVERO, 
OSCAR ESPINOSA CHEPE, RICARDO GONZALEZ ALFONSO, AND JOSE 
LUIS GARCIA PANEQUE. 
 
--WE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONNECTION MADE 
BY CUBAN STATE MEDIA BETWEEN THESE ARRESTS AND MEETINGS 
HELD BETWEEN MANY OF THOSE ARRESTED AND U.S. DIPLOMATS. 
 
--THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAS THREATENED TO PROSECUTE THOSE 
ARRESTED UNDER \"LAW 88,\" WHICH CARRIES SENTENCES OF 7 TO 
20 YEARS FOR ANYONE RECEIVING ASSISTANCE FROM THE USG. 
 
--THE ARRESTS INCLUDED EXTENSIVE SEARCHES OF OPPOSITION 
MEMBERS\' HOMES. A WIFE OF ONE LEADER TOLD OUR DIPLOMATS 
THAT STATE SECURITY HAD CARRIED OUT A FIVE-HOUR SEARCH OF 
HER SMALL HOME, DESTROYING BEDDING, REMOVING NEARLY ALL OF 
HER BOOKS AND MAGAZINES, AND EVEN SEARCHING THE STRUCTURE 
OF THE HOUSE. WHILE CARRYING OUT THE SEARCH, THEY TURNED 
ON HER TELEVISION AND INSTRUCTED HER TO WATCH THE 
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM DENOUNCING U.S. DIPLOMATS\' TIES TO 
\"COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY TRAITORS\" WHILE THEY DISASSEMBLED 
HER HOME. OTHER FAMILIES REPORTED EVEN LONGER AND MORE 
INTRUSIVE SEARCHES, SOME LASTING ALMOST TEN HOURS, WHICH 
FORCED THE OPPOSITION MEMBERS\' SPOUSES AND CHILDREN TO 
LEAVE DURING THE NIGHT. 
 
--THE UNITED STATES IS OUTRAGED AT THESE ARRESTS AND 
CONTINUED REPRESSION OF CUBANS WHO ARE SEEKING FREEDOM AND 
DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN CUBA. 
 
--WE HAVE CALLED UPON THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE 
THESE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY. 
 
--WE ASK YOUR GOVERNMENT TO JOIN US IN DEMANDING THEIR 
RELEASE. THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO TAKE 
THESE STEPS WITH IMPUNITY. 
 
(FOR COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS MEMBERS AND OBSERVERS) 
--THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TOOK THIS ACTION AS THE UN 
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS OPENED IN GENEVA IS ESPECIALLY 
EGREGIOUS. THE COMMISSION MUST RESPOND TO THIS ACTION. 
 
(FOR EU MEMBERS) 
--WE HOPE THE EU WILL TAKE THIS ACTION INTO ACCOUNT WHEN 
CONSIDERING CUBA\'S APPLICATION TO JOIN COTONOU. 
 
 
PRESS STATEMENT - MARCH 19 
-------------------------- 
 
STATEMENT BY RICHARD BOUCHER, SPOKESMAN 
 
U.S. OUTRAGED BY CUBAN CRACKDOWN ON DISSIDENTS 
 
THE UNITED STATES IS OUTRAGED BY THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT\'S 
ANNOUNCED ARREST OF DOZENS OF OPPOSITION MEMBERS YESTERDAY 
EVENING. THIS IS AN APPALLING ACT OF INTIMIDATION AGAINST 
THOSE WHO SEEK FREEDOM AND DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN CUBA. 
THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR SIMPLY SPEAKING OUT, 
ONE OF THE MOST BASIC INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN 
RIGHTS. WE CALL ON THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THEM 
IMMEDIATELY AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO JOIN US 
IN DEMANDING THEIR RELEASE. 
 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF ARRESTS FOLLOWED A GOVERNMENT RADIO 
BROADCAST ATTACKING THE HEAD OF OUR INTERESTS SECTION AND 
THE OUTREACH EFFORTS OF OUR DIPLOMATS IN CUBA. THE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT SUGGESTED THAT MANY OF THE DETAINEES WERE 
ARRESTED FOR MEETING WITH OUR DIPLOMATS. WE ALSO NOTE 
THAT THESE EVENTS COINCIDE WITH THE OPENING OF THE UN 
COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENEVA, OF WHICH CUBA IS A 
MEMBER. THE UNITED STATES CALLS ON THE COMMISSION TO 
CONDEMN THIS ACTION IN THE STRONGEST TERMS. CUBA HAS 
AGAIN DEMONSTRATED THAT IT IS NOT FIT TO SIT ON THIS 
COMMISSION. 
 
WHILE THESE ARRESTS ARE INTENDED TO DEAL A BLOW AGAINST 
THE OPPOSITION MOVEMENT, THEY WILL NOT QUELL THE CUBAN\'S 
PEOPLE\'S DESIRE FOR FREEDOM AND THEY ONLY SERVE TO EXPOSE 
THE WEAKNESS AND DESPERATION OF THE REGIME AS IT REALIZES 
THAT IT IS NEARING ITS END.

1. WASHINGTON AGENCIES APPRECIATE POSTS\' EFFORTS TO WALK 
BACK SADC\'S DECISION NOT TO ACCEPT USG FUNDS FOR PROJECTS 
THAT PRECLUDE ZIMBABWEAN PARTICIPATION. WE REGRET THAT 
SADC COULD NOT ARRIVE AT A TIMELY DECISION THAT WOULD ALLOW

OBLIGATE $22.5 MILLION IN FY03 THROUGH THE SADC 
SECRETARIAT. 
 
2. DEPARTMENT CONCURS IN EMBASSY GABORONE\'S PROPOSAL TO 
SEND THE FOLLOWING LETTER TO THE SADC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, 
SIGNED BY THE AMBASSADOR AS THE SECRETARY OF STATE\'S 
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE TO SADC. 
 
DEAR DR. RAMSAMY: 
 
AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ON MANY OCCASIONS, ONE OF THE UNIQUE 
POSITIVE ASPECTS OF THE U.S.-SADC RELATIONSHIP WAS THE 
PRACTICE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA 
(RCSA) OF OBLIGATING ITS ANNUAL PROGRAM BUDGET OF 
APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION/YEAR THROUGH THE SADC 
SECRETARIAT. 
 
THIS EXERCISE, UNPRECEDENTED IN OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER 
REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN AFRICA, HIGHLIGHTED THE SHARED 
GOALS OF SADC AND THE USG FOR THE REGION. 
 
WHILE WE HOPED VERY MUCH TO CONTINUE THIS PRACTICE, WE 
UNDERSTAND THE SECRETARIAT IS UNABLE TO CONFIRM SADC\'S 
WILLINGNESS TO DO SO. BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS RELATED 
TO THE CLOSING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR, WE ARE UNABLE TO WAIT 
ANY LONGER FOR A SADC DETERMINATION. I AM THEREFORE 
INFORMING YOU THAT RCSA WILL OBLIGATE ITS FUNDS IN A 
DIFFERENT MANNER THIS YEAR AND IN THE FUTURE. THIS 
DECISION MAY ALSO AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 
TECHNICAL AND OTHER SUPPORT TO THE SADC SECRETARIAT. 
 
WE DEEPLY REGRET THAT SADC HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND, AS WE 
HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST, A WAY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH 
THE UNITED STATES IN SPITE OF THE DIFFICULTIES POSED BY THE 
SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE. WHILE THIS HAS CONSTRAINED THE 
WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND SADC, WE HOPE TO 
CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE DIALOGUE WITH THE SADC SECRETARIAT IN 
SUPPORT OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICA\'S REGIONAL GOALS. 
 
                       SINCERELY.

SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY KELLY\'S MEETING WITH 
COORDINATING MINISTER JUSUF KALLA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: EAP A/S JAMES A. KELLY.  REASON: 1.5(B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) SUMMARY.  A/S KELLY MET JULY 21 WITH COORDINATING 
MINISTER JUSUF KALLA, WHO SAID HE LOOKED FORWARD TO VYING FOR 
GOLKAR\'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN THE 2004 ELECTIONS. 
KALLA SPOKE OF THE GOI\'S NEED TO COMBAT POVERTY AND IMPROVE 
PRIMARY EDUCATION TO REDUCE THE APPEAL OF RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM 
FANNED BY \"OUTSIDER\" CLERICS.  KALLA SAID THE GOI WAS MAKING 
PROGRESS IN ITS NATIONAL ANTI-AIDS CAMPAIGN DESPITE LOCAL 
OPPOSITION AGAINST CONDOM USE.  A/S KELLY SAID HE WAS 
ENCOURAGED BY INDONESIA\'S CONTINUOUS SUCCESS AT BREAKING UP 
TERRORIST NETWORKS AND HE URGED KALLA TO PRESS FOR CONTINUED 
TNI COOPERATION ON THE TIMIKA/TEMBAGAPURA KILLING.  A/S KELLY 
ALSO EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF FIGHTING AIDS AND THE 
SCOURGE OF TRAFFICKING-IN-PERSONS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (C) A/S KELLY MET GOI COORDINATING MINISTER FOR PEOPLE\'S 
WELFARE, JUSUF KALLA, IN A JULY 21 COURTESY CALL DURING 
KALLA\'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON.  KELLY NOTED KALLA\'S PROPITIOUS 
TIMING, GIVEN RECENT MEDIA REPORTS OF KALLA\'S INTENTION OF 
VYING FOR THE GOLKAR PARTY\'S PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION IN 2004. 
 KALLA SAID HE WAS JUST ONE OF MANY CANDIDATES, BUT LOOKED 
FORWARD TO BEING SELECTED AS ONE OF FIVE SHORT-LISTED 
CANDIDATES THIS FALL, AND HOPEFULLY BECOMING THE MAIN 
CANDIDATE CHOSEN AT THE PARTY\'S FEBRUARY 2004 CONVENTION. 
KALLA ADDED THAT, BARRING ANY MAJOR PRE-ELECTION COALITION 
BUILDING, THE ELECTION WAS LIKELY TO GO TO A SECOND ROUND 
RUNOFF. 

3. (C) A/S KELLY SAID HE WAS ENCOURAGED BY INDONESIA\'S 
CONTINUED SUCCESS AT BREAKING UP TERRORIST NETWORKS, NOTING 
THAT DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE SURVIVED TESTING TIMES AND 
WILL DO SO AGAIN DURING THE ELECTION PERIOD.  KALLA RESPONDED 
THAT INDONESIA\'S REPUTATION FOR MODERATE RELIGIOUS VIEWPOINTS 
WAS BEING UNDERMINED BY \"OUTSIDER\" CLERICS WHO FOUND WILLING 
AUDIENCES DUE TO PERSISTENT POVERTY AND POOR EDUCATIONAL 
PROSPECTS.  KALLA SAID THE 2002 PEACE ACCORDS HE HAD MEDIATED 
BETWEEN RELIGOUS GROUPS IN SULAWESI AND MALUKU WERE HOLDING 
UP WELL DESPITE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL VIOLENCE. 
 
4. (C) A/S KELLY CONGRATULATED KALLA ON HIS MEDIATION EFFORTS 
IN THESE CENTRAL PROVINCES, SAYING HE HOPED SIMILAR SUCCESSES 
WOULD FOLLOW AT THE GEOGRAPHICAL EXTREMES OF INDONESIA, PAPUA 
AND ACEH.  A/S KELLY URGED KALLA TO ENCOURAGE CONTINUED 
COOPERATION BY THE INDONESIAN ARMED FORCES (TNI) WITH THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE KILLINGS OF TWO AMERICANS IN 
TIMIKA/TEMBAGAPURA, PAPUA PROVINCE, WHICH REMAINS OF GREAT 
CONCERN TO THE USG.  A/S KELLY, NOTING KALLA\'S COVERAGE OF 
REFUGEE ISSUES IN HIS PORTFOLIO, ADDED THAT HE HOPED THE GOI 
WOULD ENSURE THE WELFARE OF CIVILIANS IN ACEH CAUGHT UP IN 
THE MILITARY CAMPAIGN TO ROOT OUT SEPARATISTS FROM THE FREE 
ACEH MOVEMENT (GAM). 
 
5. (C) KALLA REPLIED THAT THE REFUGEE FLOWS IN ACEH WERE A 
POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT PURPOSEFULLY SOUGHT BY THE GOI TO REDUCE 
THE CIVILIAN PRESENCE IN AREAS TARGETED BY THE TNI.  \"IT IS 
BETTER TO HAVE REFUGEES THAN NOT,\" HE ADDED.  KALLA SAID THE 
MINISTRIES HE COVERS PREPARED FOR OVER 100,000 REFUGEES, 
PROVIDING HUNDREDS OF DOCTORS, AMBULANCES AND WATER 
FACILITIES TO COPE WITH THE CONFLICT.  HE SAID THEY WERE NOT 
PREPARED, HOWEVER, FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF OVER \"15 PERCENT\" 
OF ACEH\'S SCHOOLS, WHICH HE BLAMED ON THE SEPARATISTS.  KALLA 
SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING THE QUALITY 
OF LIFE OF ACEHNESE, AS THE GAM MOVEMENT WOULD ONLY GAIN 
STRENGTH FROM ANY DISAFFECTION TOWARDS THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
 
6. (C) KALLA SPOKE OF THE GOI\'S CONTINUING EFFORTS TO COMBAT 
HIV/AIDS, AND SAID THE NATIONAL STRATEGY WAS PROCEEDING 
DESPITE SOME LOCAL OPPOSITION TO CONDOM USAGE OR PROMOTION. 
A/S KELLY AGREED THAT EFFORTS TO COMBAT THE DISEASE MUST TAKE 
ACCOUNT OF THE CULTURAL CONTEXT.  HE ALSO EMPHASIZED THE NEED 
TO ELIMINATE THE SCOURGE OF TRAFFICKING-IN-PERSONS, URGING 
KALLA TO PRESS FOR LEGISLATION AS WELL AS INTERNAL MEASURES 
TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTE TRAFFICKERS, EVEN 
WHEN THEY ARE OFFICIALS OR PROTECTED. 
 
7. (C) COMMENT: KALLA\'S MOOD WAS RELAXED AND CONFIDENT.  HE 
TOOK PAINS TO WELCOME USG ENGAGEMENT WITH INDONESIA, CITING 
AS AN EXAMPLE THE SUCCESS OF A COOPERATIVE PROGRAM WITH 
EMBASSIES TO PROVIDE MILK TO SCHOOLCHILDREN - \"THEY LIKE 
RECEIVING THE CARTONS WITH THE AMERICAN FLAGS.\"  KALLA 
LIGHTHEARTEDLY CONCURRED THAT TODAY\'S WALL STREET JOURNAL 
ARTICLE ON INUL DARATISTA, AND THE POPULARITY OF HER RISQUE 
DANCING, WAS \"AN EXPRESSION BY THE PROVINCES\" OF FREEDOM AND 
BROAD-MINDEDNESS.  \"YOU CAN\'T CONTROL THE TASTES OF THE 
MASSES,\" HE SAID.  \"IF YOU TRY TO SUPPRESS SOMEONE, IT WILL 
ONLY MAKE THEM MORE POPULAR.\"

SUBJECT: SMART UPDATE 
 
REF: 02 STATE 195704 
 
1.  Please provide wide dissemination of the information 
in this telegram. 
 
2.  Reftel described steps the Department is taking to 
implement a new integrated messaging system: SMART (State 
Messaging and Archive Retrieval Toolset).  We have made 
substantial progress and are looking for your input as we 
move forward. 
 
3.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) to design SMART was 
released to the vendor community in late June, and 
proposals were submitted September 2, 2003.  The 
description of SMART requirements in the RFQ is based in 
great part on the feedback received from a wide range of 
Department employees over the past year: from evaluators 
of the proof-of-concept prototype, to those who sent in 
comments to the SMART website, to participants in focus 
groups and members of working groups. 
 
4.  The technical evaluation team, consisting of 
representatives of different bureaus, offices and posts 
under the leadership of Ambassador James Holmes, IRM\'s 
Chief Knowledge Officer and DCIO, evaluated the vendor 
proposals against the established technical criteria. The 
cost evaluation team met and evaluated the vendor 
proposals against the established cost criteria. 
 
5. The recommendation arising from the evaluation process 
will now go to the Steering Committee for Messaging and 
InterAgency Collaboration, chaired by Ambassador Joe Lake. 
This committee, which includes senior level substantive, 
management and technical representatives of many bureaus, 
will recommend up to three vendors. 
 
6. The companies selected will each design and demonstrate 
a fully functioning solution, which, in turn, will be 
evaluated early in the new calendar year (2004). A vendor 
will then be selected to produce a pilot for the new 
system. The pilot will involve parts of one geographic 
(EUR) and one functional (DS) bureau, and associated 
overseas posts.  Once the pilot is evaluated, full 
implementation is expected in 2005. 
 
7.  We will continue to keep you informed as we move 
through this complex process.  Your comments, concerns and 
recommendations are welcome at every stage.  We encourage 
you to check the SMART website regularly for up to date 
information.  Website addresses are: 
http://smart.state.gov (Intranet), 
http://smart.state.sgov.gov(Classified) and 
http://smart (PDNet). 
 
8.  Minimize considered.

FOR REASONS 1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
1. (C) PALESTINIAN TERRORIST ABU ABBAS DIED MARCH 8 OF A 
HEART ATTACK WHILE IN CPA CUSTODY IN BAGHDAD. ABU ABBAS 
DIRECTED THE HIJACKING OF THE ITALIAN CRUISE SHIP ACHILLE 
LAURO IN 1985, DURING WHICH AMERICAN CITIZEN LEON 
KLINGHOFFER, 69 AND WHEELCHAIR-BOUND, WAS KILLED AND HIS 
BODY DUMPED INTO THE SEA. ON SUNDAY, ABU ABBAS COMPLAINED 
OF CHEST PAINS AND WENT OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO THE PRISON 
MEDICAL FACILITY.  WHILE THERE HE HAD A HEART ATTACK; 
EFFORTS TO RESTART HIS HEART WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  AN 
AUTOPSY IS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW.  ABU ABBAS HAD NOT BEEN 
INTERROGATED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS PREVIOUS TO HIS ATTACK. 
HE HAD BEEN IN U.S. CUSTODY SINCE HIS CAPTURE ON THE 
OUTSKIRTS OF BAGHDAD ON APRIL 14, 2003. 
 
2. (C) DOJ HAS INFORMED THE KLINGHOFFER FAMILY OF ABU 
ABBAS\' DEATH; CONGEN JERUSALEM HAS INFORMED THE 
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY; DOD HAS INFORMED THE ICRC WHICH HAS

DEAR ANA: 
 
I WAS DEEPLY SADDENED TO LEARN OF THE TRAGIC BOMBINGS IN 
MADRID THAT KILLED MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE. ON BEHALF OF 
MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, I WISH TO EXPRESS 
OUR CONDOLENCES AND HEARTFELT SYMPATHIES TO THE PEOPLE OF 
SPAIN AND ESPECIALLY TO THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO LOST LOVED 
ONES. WE SHARE YOUR GRIEF.

SUBJECT: EXCEPTION TO VANCE MEMORANDUM - APPROVAL FOR U.S. 
DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATIONS TO INSTALL MONITORING EQUIPMENT 
IN \"WALK-IN\" ROOMS. 
 
REF: APPROVED DEPUTY SECRETARY ACTION MEMO DATED 
2/13/04. 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: ASSISTANT SECRETARY FRANCIS X. TAYLOR, DS 
REASONS: 1.4 (C) AND (D) 
 
1. (S) IN VIEW OF CHANGING WORLD CONDITIONS AND THE GLOBAL 
WAR ON TERRORISM, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY HAS APPROVED A 
MODIFICATION TO THE 1977 VANCE MEMORANDUM. 
WHICH STATES, IN PART, THAT NO OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE OF THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT OR FOREIGN SERVICE SHALL DIRECT, ARRANGE FOR, 
PERMIT, OR UNDERTAKE THE MONITORING OR MECHANICAL OR 
ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF ANY CONVERSATION, INCLUDING ANY 
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, WITHOUT THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF 
ALL PERSONS INVOLVED IN THE CONVERSATION. 
ANY DEVIATION FROM THIS RULE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE OR DEPUTY SECRETARY. 
 
2. (S/NF) THE EXCEPTION APPROVED BY THE DEPUTY SECRETARY ON 
FEBRUARY 13, 2004 NOW PERMITS REGULAR MONITORING AND RECORDING 
OF INTERVIEWS WITH FOREIGN NATIONALS AT \"WALK-IN ROOMS\" 
AT OVERSEAS POSTS. THIS MODIFICATION ONLY APPLIES 
TO RECORDING OF INTERVIEWS WITH FOREIGN NATIONALS 
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISOS LISTED IN PARA 7. 
 
3. (S/NF) BACKGROUND: PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTARILY COME TO A 
U.S. EMBASSY AND OFFER INFORMATION ARE COMMONLY 
REFERRED TO UNDER THE GENERIC NAME OF WALK-INS. IN 
MOST INSTANCES, DS AGENTS ASSIGNED TO THE REGIONAL 
SECURITY OFFICE IS THE FIRST OFFICER TO CONDUCT AN INITIAL 
INTERVIEW WITH THE WALK-IN (THIS MAY VARY IN ACCORDANCE TO 
THE POST\'S WALK-IN PLAN). IT IS THE FIRST-CONTACT OFFICER\'S 
RESPONSIBILITY TO BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE SUBJECT\'S BONA 
FIDES AND REASON FOR VISITING THE POST. COORDINATION 
IS THEN EFFECTED WITH OTHER APPROPRIATE 
EMBASSY OFFICERS REGARDING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONING OR ANY 
FUTURE HANDLING OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IN SOME CASES, 
OTHER AGENCIES (E.G., DEA, FBI, RAO) MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED 
IN SUBSEQUENT STAGES. 
 
4. (S/NF) HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT WALK-INS COME IN MANY SHAPES 
AND SIZES. WHILE SOME RELAY INFORMATION THAT IS CORROBORATED 
AS VALID, MANY OTHERS HAVE PROVEN TO BE MENTALLY DISTURBED 
PERSONS, INTELLIGENCE VENDORS, FABRICATORS, AND PROVOCATEURS 
FROM HOSTILE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OR PERSONS WHO MAY HAVE 
BEEN SENT TO GATHER INFORMATION ON BEHALF OF TERRORIST OR 
NARCOTICS-TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
5. (S/NF) ALMOST ALL EMBASSIES HAVE A ROOM DESIGNATED AS AN 
INTERVIEW OR WALK-IN ROOM. THIS IS NORMALLY LOCATED BEHIND 
THE INITIAL SCREENING POINT, BUT STILL OUTSIDE OF THE 
EMBASSY HARDLINE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW EXCEPTION, 
POSTS MAY EQUIP THESE PERMANENT ROOMS WITH HIDDEN AUDIO 
AND VISUAL MONITORING DEVICES TO MONITOR CONVERSATIONS 
OCCURRING IN THE ROOM. SUCH MONITORING WILL ATTAIN TWO 
OBJECTIVES: A) ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF THE U.S. PERSONNEL 
CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW IN THE EVENT THE SUBJECT BECOMES 
VIOLENT, AND B) PERMIT AN ACCURATE CAPTURING OF INFORMATION 
CONVEYED (MOST INTERVIEWS ARE CONDUCTED IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE 
AND A TAPE CAN SUBSEQUENTLY PERMIT DETAILED REVIEW OF THE 
WORDS UTILIZED). 
 
6. (S/NF) BECAUSE THE U.S. EMBASSY PERSONNEL INITIATE AND 
AGREE TO THE MONITORING ACTIVITY, THIS AMENDED PROCEDURE 
IS CONSIDERED CONSENSUAL MONITORING. CONSENSUAL MONITORING 
IS THE RECORDING OF CONVERSATIONS WHEN ONE PARTY TO THE 
CONVERSATION CONSENTS TO THE RECORDING AND IS A STANDARD 
LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNIQUE THAT IS WIDELY USED IN FEDERAL 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A COURT ORDER AND 
IS SPECIFICALLY PERMISSIBLE UNDER 18 USC 2511 (2)(C). 
 
7. (S/NF) POSTS SHOULD CONVENE THEIR CIWGS TO DISCUSS 
SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPROVED EXCEPTION WITH 
THE FOLLOWING PROVISOS IN MIND: 
A) THE MONITORING OF THESE INTERVIEWS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE PARTY BEING INTERVIEWED MAY ONLY OCCUR WITH FOREIGN 
NATIONALS. CONVERSATIONS WITH U.S. CITIZENS AND LEGAL 
PERMANENT RESIDENTS (LPR) CONTINUE TO FALL UNDER THE VANCE 
MEMORANDUM GUIDELINES, AND IN SUCH CASES ALL 
PARTIES MUST CONSENT TO ANY RECORDING/MONITORING ACTIVITY. 
FOREIGN NATIONALS DO NOT/NOT HAVE TO BE ADVISED 
THAT THE INTERVIEW IS BEING RECORDED OR MONITORED. 
B) AS A MATTER OF ROUTINE, AN IDENTIFYING DOCUMENT 
SHOULD BE REQUESTED OF THE WALK-IN PRIOR TO THE COMMENCEMENT 
OF THE INTERVIEW. IN ADDITION TO COPYING THE 
DOCUMENT FOR PERMANENT RECORD, THIS WILL ALSO ASSIST IN 
DETERMINING IF THE PERSON IS A U.S. CITIZEN OR LPR. 
C) THE MONITORING DEVICES DO NOT/NOT HAVE TO VISIBLE. 
THEY MAY BE CONCEALED FROM THE PERSON BEING INTERVIEWED. 
D) VIDEO DEVICES MAY BE PLACED SO THAT THE U.S. PERSONNEL 
CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW ARE NOT NECESSARILY CAPTURED ON 
VIDEOTAPE. 
E) THE MONITORING DEVICES MAY NOT BE AUTOMATIC. PRIOR TO 
THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ACTUAL INTERVIEW, THE INTERVIEWING 
EMBASSY OFFICER MUST MAKE A DELIBERATE DECISION TO MONITOR/NOT 
MONITOR (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GUIDANCE IN POINT B ABOVE). 
MOST POSTS WILL OPT TO HAVE THE ACTIVATION SWITCHES LOCATED 
AT MSG POST 1 OR ANOTHER CONVENIENT LOCATION. THE POST 
WALK-IN PLAN WILL ESTABLISH A MECHANISM FOR COMMUNICATING 
THE MONITOR/DON\'T MONITOR DECISION TO MSG POST 1 OR WHEREVER 
THE ACTIVATION SWITCHES ARE LOCATED. F) RECORDINGS/TAPES OF 
THE INTERVIEWS MAY BE DISSEMINATED TO THOSE AGENCIES AT POST 
WITH INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FUNCTIONS 
CONNECTED TO THE MATTER DISCLOSED BY THE PERSON INTERVIEWED 
OR AS PER GUIDANCE ESTABLISHED BY THE CIWG. 
G) THE REGIONAL SECURITY OFFICE WILL RETAIN COPIES OF ALL 
RECORDED/TAPED INTERVIEWS FOR A MINIMUM OF NINETY (90) DAYS. 
RECORDS OF SUBSEQUENT DESTRUCTION OR TRANSFER MUST BE RETAINED 
TO INCLUDE DATE OF INTERVIEW, NAME OF SUBJECT INTERVIEWED, 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION DIVULGED IN INTERVIEW, 
SUBSEQUENT REFERRAL OF INFORMATION AND DATE TAPES/RECORDINGS 
DESTROYED. 
H) REPORTING OF THREAT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS 
MODIFICATION. THREAT INFORMATION IS TO BE REPORTED AS 
OUTLINED IN 2001 STATE 114250. IN THE EVENT AN INTERVIEW 
RESULTS IN CREDIBLE THREAT INFORMATION BEING DIVULGED, RSO 
WILL ALSO FORWARD A COPY OF THE TAPE/RECORDING VIA CLASSIFIED 
POUCH TO DS/PII. 
 
8. (U) DEPARTMENT NOTES THAT DUE TO RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS 
THESE ITEMS MUST BE EITHER POST FUNDED OR PROVIDED BY A 
PARTICIPATING AGENCY OF THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE WORKING 
GROUP (CIWG). 
 
9. (U)QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS POLICY SHOULD BE DIRECTED 
TO DIRECTOR, DS/DO/ICI, (571-345-2944, STU).

SUBJECT: PREVENTING TRAVEL TO POSSIBLE KONGRA-GEL 
CONFERENCE IN IRAQ 
 
CLASSIFIED BY EUR DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY B. LYNN 
PASCOE, REASONS 1.4 (B) (D). 
 
1. (S) THIS IS AN ACTION MESSAGE. ACTION ADDRESSEES ARE 
TO DRAW FROM THE POINTS IN PARA 2-4, AS APPROPRIATE, WITH 
HOST GOVERNMENTS AT THE HIGHEST APPROPRIATE LEVELS TO SEEK 
THEIR HELP IN PREVENTING A PARTY CONGRESS IN IRAQ BY 
KONGRA-GEL, THE TERRORIST SUCCESSOR TO THE PKK. THE U.S. 
WILL DO ALL IT CAN IN IRAQ TO PREVENT THE CONGRESS, 
REPORTEDLY PLANNED FOR APRIL 27, FROM TAKING PLACE. SOME 
OF THE DELEGATES TO THE REPORTED CONGRESS WILL COME FROM 
EUROPE AND NEIGHBORING STATES OR TRANSIT THESE NEIGHBORS. 
GIVEN THAT THE GREAT BULK OF KONGRA-GEL\'S FUNDING COMES 
FROM EUROPE, IT IS REASONABLE TO SUSPECT THAT SOME OF 
THOSE WHO TRAVEL TO THE CONGRESS FROM EUROPE MAY BRING 
FUNDS FOR THE ORGANIZATION.   WITH THE APRIL 3 DECISION BY 
THE EU COREPER TO EXTEND THE EU\'S DESIGNATION OF THE PKK 
TO KADEK AND THE CURRENT ALIAS, KONGRA-GEL, ON ITS 
TERRORIST FINANCING LIST, WE HOPE THAT THE EU WOULD FOLLOW 
THROUGH BY PREVENTING THE TRAVEL OF MEMBERS OF THIS 
TERRORIST GROUP TO THE REPORTED CONGRESS. 
 
2. (S) (FOR EU POSTS, AMMAN AND DAMASCUS) BEGIN POINTS: 
 
-- (FOR EU POSTS ONLY) WE COMMEND THE EU\'S APRIL 3 
DECISION TO EXTEND ITS TERRORIST DESIGNATION OF THE PKK TO 
KADEK AND THE PKK\'S CURRENT ALIAS, KONGRA-GEL. 
 
-- WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT THE TURKISH TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATION, KONGRA-GEL, MAY ATTEMPT TO HOLD A PARTY 
CONGRESS IN IRAQ IN LATE APRIL, PERHAPS ON APRIL 27. 
 
-- REGARDLESS OF THE EXACT DATE, KONGRA-GEL HAS SPOKEN 
PUBLICLY OF THE IDEA OF HOLDING A CONGRESS. 
 
-- THE U.S. WILL DO ALL IT CAN TO PREVENT KONGRA-GEL FROM 
HOLDING SUCH A CONGRESS IN IRAQ, AS PART OF OUR LARGER 
EFFORT TO END TERRORIST HAVEN IN IRAQ. WE WILL NOT ALLOW 
TERRORISTS TO THREATEN THE REGION FROM IRAQ. ALL PARTIES 
REPRESENTED IN THE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL CONSIDER 
KONGRA-GEL A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, AND THE SUCCESSOR TO 
THE PKK. 
 
-- IF PAST PRACTICE IS A GUIDE, SOME OF THE ORGANIZATION\'S 
DELEGATES WILL COME FROM EUROPE OR FROM NEIGHBORING 
COUNTRIES, SUCH AS SYRIA AND IRAN. OTHERS MAY TRANSIT 
THESE NEIGHBORS, AS WELL AS JORDAN. 
 
-- WE THEREFORE ASK THAT YOU NOT ALLOW MEMBERS OF KONGRA- 
GEL TO TRAVEL FROM YOUR COUNTRY/TRANSIT YOUR COUNTRY ON 
THEIR WAY TO ATTEND SUCH A CONGRESS. 
 
-- (FOR EU POSTS) GIVEN THAT THE GREAT BULK OF KONGRA- 
GEL\'S FUNDING COMES FROM EUROPE, IT IS REASONABLE TO 
SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO TRAVEL TO THE CONGRESS FROM 
EUROPE MAY TRY TO BRING FUNDS FOR THE ORGANIZATION WITH 
THEM. WE HOPE THAT PREVENTION OF THEIR TRAVEL WOULD 
COMPLEMENT YOUR PLACING OF TERRORIST FINANCING 
RESTRICTIONS ON KONGRA-GEL. 
 
END POINTS. 
 
3. (S) (FOR ANKARA ONLY) PLEASE INFORM GOT OF OUR 
DEMARCHES AND SUGGEST THAT IT MAKE SIMILAR APPROACHES AND 
CONSIDER PROVIDING THE NAMES OF SPECIFIC KONGRA-GEL 
LEADERS KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO BE RESIDING IN EACH COUNTRY. 
DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE ALREADY OBTAINED AND 
THE STATUS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THE GOT MAY ALSO 
WISH TO MAKE SURE THAT HOST NATIONS ARE AWARE OF KONGRA- 
GEL MEMBERS FOR WHOM TURKEY HAS ISSUED INTERPOL RED 
NOTICES OR WHOM THE GOT MIGHT WANT DETAINED UNDER 
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS, IF THEY ATTEMPT TO TRAVEL. 
 
4. (S) (FOR RIYADH AND KUWAIT ONLY) POSTS, AT THEIR OWN 
DISCRETION, MAY WISH TO DRAW ON THE POINTS IN PARA 2 TO 
BRIEF HOST GOVERNMENTS, WITH THE FOLLOWING INTRODUCTORY 
POINTS: 
 
-- PAST PRECEDENCE HAS NOT SHOWN THAT KONGRA-GEL MEMBERS 
TRANSIT YOUR COUNTRY INTO IRAQ. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE 
INCREASED EMPHASIS ON ELIMINATING TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
FROM IRAQ, TO INCLUDE KONGRA-GEL, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THEY 
MAY ATTEMPT TRAVEL USING NEW ROUTES. 
 
-- WE ARE THUS PASSING YOU THIS INFORMATION AS PART OF 
REGIONAL EFFORTS TO MEET OUT SHARED COMMITMENT ON THE WAR 
AGAINST TERROR.

Assistance Program 
 
1. Over the next several months, the Department will 
provide assistance to as many as 30 posts to improve their 
classified web presence. The Department will pay for a 
cleared dependent to load post\'s hard-copy content; provide 
a scanner for capturing pictures and documents; and provide 
on-site training. This pilot effort aims to make publishing 
content to the embassy\'s classified homepage quicker and 
easier. Summary End 
 
2. Any post with an active classified homepage on the 
SIPRNet can participate in this program. Detailed 
information and a very brief online questionnaire can 
be found by clicking on the Net-Centric Diplomacy logo at 
 
www.state.sgov.gov/rm/irpcip/ 
 
on ClassNet. To be considered for participation, posts 
should complete the questionnaire by Monday, May 10. 
Please ensure that only one questionnaire is submitted 
per post. 
 
Details 
 
3. As posts maintaining SIPRNet homepages already know, 
the classified web is rapidly becoming an important way to 
share foreign policy information both inside the Department 
and with other U.S. Government agencies. The material that 
posts publish on your SIPRNet homepages is broadly and 
instantly available and can be easily found using Google 
and other search engines. Some embassy classified web 
pages are already well on their way to becoming key 
resources for policy makers. 
 
4. To encourage web-based information sharing across 
systems, the Department of Defense has launched an 
initiative dubbed \"Horizontal Fusion.\" The Department of 
State has been selected to participate in this initiative 
and has been given funding to 1) increase the amount of 
data we publish on the classified web and 2) make that data 
more accessible to DOD knowledge management systems. More 
information on this program can be found on the Internet 
at: www.horizontalfusion.dod.mil. 
 
5. We are using Horizontal Fusion funding to improve web 
publishing of biographic files and reporting telegrams. 
Many posts have a large number of biographic files, but few 
find the time to publish more than a small fraction of them 
to the classified web. We are developing a utility that 
will allow a user at post to scan, tag, and publish the 
entire contents of a paper bio file to post\'s classified 
embassy homepage. Once the bio files are stored online, 
they will be easier to maintain, use, and search, and posts 
will be able to eliminate/minimize paper bio file holdings. 
 
6. Similarly, most posts have web-published only a small 
fraction of their reporting telegrams since doing so 
requires considerable clicking, cutting, and pasting. We 
are developing a way for a user at post to take a cable 
from CableXpress and publish it on the embassy\'s classified 
website with something approaching drag-and-drop ease. 
 
7. Both of these web-publishing tools will allow users to 
prepare files offline and then send them to the Washington- 
based server. We hope that this approach will speed up the 
web publishing process, particularly at posts with slow or 
unreliable connections. 
 
8. Minimize considered.

THIS PROGRAM IS PART OF THE DOD HORIZONTAL FUSION INITIATIVE, IN 
COORDINATION WITH STATE\'S PROGRAM TO PUBLISH CLASSIFIED REPORTING

2. OVER 50 POSTS HAVE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. 
COLLECTIVELY THE RESPONDING POSTS REPORTED HOLDING NEARLY 
20,000 PAPER BIOGRAPHIC FILES AND MANY THOUSANDS OF CABLESSUITABLE 
FOR WEB PUBLISHING. TO PARTICIPATE, POSTS MUST HAVE AN ACTIVE

    TO ALL POSTS INITIALLY SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE, IT APPEARS THAT 
ALL POSTS MAY NOT NEED THE SAME TOOL SET. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY POSTS 
ALREADY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF SCANNING CAPABILITY. SOME POSTS HAVE 
SAFES FULL OF PAPER BIOGRAPHIC FILES WHILE OTHERS HAVE RELATIVELY 
FEW. FOR THE LATTER, THE ABILITY TO EASILY PUBLISH CABLES TO THE 
SIPRNET MIGHT BE THE MAIN BENEFIT, AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO 
ENABLE POSTS TO SELF INSTALL THIS CAPABILITY. SIMILARLY, WE 
ARE LOOKING AT METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE A POST TO PUBLISH 
A CABLE TO ITS SIPRNET HOMEPAGE SIMPLY BY ADDING A NEW CAPTION

ACROSS THE CLASSIFIED NETWORK. BY THE END OF JUNE THE BETA TESTING 
WILL BE COMPLETED IN MEXICO CITY. DURING JULY WE PLAN TO VISIT 
SEVERAL POSTS IN EAP TO INSTALL A BETA VERSION OF THE SOLUTION 
AND HIRE CONTRACT ASSISTANCE AT POST TO SEE HOW THE SOLUTION 
FUNCTIONS IN AN OPERATIONAL SETTING. IN AUGUST WE WILL REVIEW 
THE LESSONS LEARNED AND DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES. BY SEPTEMBER,

SUBJECT: PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT - BANGLADESH 
 
This Public Announcement is being issued to alert U.S. 
citizens to the potential for escalating civil unrest in 
Bangladesh.  Those residing in or traveling to Bangladesh 
are urged to use extra care and precaution while in the 
country.  This Public Announcement expires on November 22, 
2004. 
 
U.S. and international media have recently reported unrest 
in various parts of Bangladesh following an assassination 
attempt on August 21 in downtown Dhaka, involving grenades 
and gun fire, on opposition political leader Sheikh Hasina 
and senior members of her Awami League party.  At least 19 
persons were killed in the attempt, and 200 were reported 
injured.  The assault has sparked multiple incidents of 
street violence, including vehicle burning, in Dhaka and 
several other cities.  Localized strikes have occurred or 
are occurring in Chittagong, Pabna, Jhalokhati, Faridpur, 
Shariatpur, Gopalgonj, Narayangonj, Madaripur, and Sylhet. 
On August 22, a train was firebombed in Bhairab, a 
railroad junction 100 kilometers northeast of Dhaka, after 
false rumors that one of the injured Awami League leaders 
had died.  There are no reports of injuries to American 
citizens as a result of the assassination attempt or the 
subsequent incidents. 
 
The Awami League and its political partners have called 
for nationwide strikes on August 24 and 25, 2004.  There 
is a strong potential for widespread violence during these 
strikes, when strike supporters may attempt to close 
virtually all institutions and businesses in major urban 
areas, and prevent the normal circulation of vehicular 
traffic.  The strikes are not expected, however, to affect 
normal life in Baridhara and Gulshan, the so-called 
diplomatic areas of Dhaka. 
 
The Embassy is advising all Americans in or traveling to 
Bangladesh to take extra care and precaution while going 
out in public and to be cognizant of the current 
situation. 
 
American citizens in Bangladesh should remain vigilant, 
particularly in public places where spontaneous 
demonstrations might arise.  They are further advised to 
avoid all demonstrations and large crowds and consider 
postponing travel to areas that may become potential 
\"hotspots\" for demonstrations. 
 
U.S. citizens planning to travel to Bangladesh should 
consult the Department of State\'s Consular Information 
Sheet for Bangladesh and the most recent Worldwide Caution 
Public Announcement, which are available via the Internet 
at http://travel.state.gov.  American citizens may obtain 
up-to-date information on security conditions by calling 
1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States, and (317) 
472-2328 from overseas. 
 
U.S. citizens visiting or resident in Bangladesh are 
encouraged to register with the U.S. embassy, where they 
may obtain updated information on travel and security 
within Bangladesh.  Security updates are e-mailed to all 
registered Americans with an e-mail address.  American 
citizens may complete a registration form on-line at 
http://travelregistration.state.gov.  During normal

1. (S) Summary and action request. This is an urgent 
action cable. Please pass the proposed terms of reference 
for the joint examination of the Al Rajhi Bank through the 
Joint Terrorist Financing Task Force to appropriate Saudi 
officials at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, and the

BEGIN TEXT 
 
Introduction 
 
The cooperation between the U.S. and Saudi governments 
through the Joint Terrorist Financing Task Force (JTFTF), 
along with the assessment by the Financial Action Task 
Force (FATF) of the Saudi anti-money laundering and 
countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, 
signals significant capabilities by the Saudi government 
to ensure that its financial institutions are not being 
used by extremists intent on supporting/committing acts of 
terrorism. While the Saudi government has provided 
assurances regarding measures it is putting in place to 
address terrorism, there remains a need for greater 
coordination with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) 
and use of AML/CFT authorities within the financial 
sector. For example, representatives of the U.S. and 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have discussed U.S. concerns that 
Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation (Al Rajhi 
Bank) has been used by al Qaida and like-minded terrorist 
groups. The U.S. government has provided the Saudi 
government with information documenting specific instances 
of terrorists using Al Rajhi Bank, including information 
about specific accounts and transactions of interest. The 
U.S. and Saudi governments have agreed to work together to 
meet a mutual goal of ensuring that Al Rajhi Bank is doing 
everything possible to keep the taint of terrorists and 
their supporters out of the bank. This includes ensuring 
that the Al Rajhi Bank is fully equipped to monitor and 
note suspicious patterns and trends in account activity, 
so as to create a preventative system within the 
institution. 
 
Proposed Terms of Reference 
 
The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), together 
with an inter-agency bank examination team (examination 
team), will work with SAMA through the existing JTFTF, on 
terms of reference for conducting a joint examination of 
certain accounts at Al Rajhi Bank. The joint examination 
will include a review of both customer information 
relevant to the specified accounts and transactions (wire 
transfer, check payment, cash management, etc.) processed 
through those accounts. Additionally, the examination team 
will review anti-money laundering compliance files related 
to all of the accounts. This joint examination can be 
modeled on other such examinations conducted with foreign 
authorities when there have been perceived issues of 
mutual concern regarding the activities within a 
particular financial institution. 
 
The intent of such an on-site review and related 
examination is to work collectively with the Al Rajhi 
Bank, identifying patterns and problems, to ensure that 
all corrective measures are delineated and implemented to 
ensure the institution is not operating in a way that 
provides a safe haven for the financial transactions of 
terrorists and their supporters. The information reviewed 
and developed in the course of this joint examination 
would be used to help the bank formulate solutions, guide 
SAMA in its regulatory work, and provide the JTFTF with 
potential leads for further investigation. 
 
There is agreement to ensure that as much work as possible 
is completed before the examination team arrives in Saudi 
Arabia. This work in preparation for the joint examination 
would involve an off-site review of certain Al Rajhi Bank 
records. A list of the types of documents that will be 
requested is attached as Exhibit A. Upon receipt of the 
requested documents, the examination team will review them 
before beginning the examination. It is likely that this 
review of the requested documents will take several weeks, 
including the time necessary to translate all documents 
that are not maintained in English. 
 
After the examination team has reviewed the requested 
records, Treasury will work with SAMA through the JTFTF to 
establish a schedule for the on-site examination in Saudi 
Arabia. The on-site visit will include the opportunity to 
speak with Al Rajhi Bank personnel, including, but not 
limited to, the account relationship managers for the 
specified accounts. These meetings will enable the 
examination team to better understand the nature of these 
accounts, the transactions processed through them, and the 
account holders\' backgrounds and banking activities. Once 
on-site, the examination team also will be able to request 
any additional documents, not already provided, relating 
to the specified accounts or to any relevant transactions. 
The small examination team would likely be comprised of 
approximately seven people, including representatives from 
the regulatory and law enforcement communities, and would 
be prepared to provide translators to facilitate the 
meetings as well as the additional document review. It is 
possible that the examination team will divide into subgroups, 
conducting simultaneous examinations on discrete 
issues, e.g., reviews of account information or systemic 
issues, in order to ensure greater efficiency and 
appropriate use of expertise. It is anticipated that the 
examination would take one to two weeks, but there is a 
need to be flexible in order to accommodate the amount of 
information and processes to be reviewed. It is 
understood that SAMA representatives will fully 
participate in all meetings with Al Rajhi Bank personnel 
and the review of all documents. 
 
3. (C) Exhibit A to Proposed Terms of Reference for Joint 
Examination of Al Rajhi Bank

SUBJECT: THE DEPUTY SECRETARY\'S DECEMBER 7, 2004 MEETING 
WITH EAST TIMOR PRESIDENT XANANA GUSMAO 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE FOR REASONS 
1.4 (B) AND (D). 
 
2. (U) DECEMBER 7, 2004, 4:40 P.M., IN THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY\'S OUTER OFFICE.

4. (C) SUMMARY: IN A FRIENDLY AND WARM ATMOSPHERE, DEPUTY 
SECRETARY ARMITAGE DISCUSSED A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES WITH 
VISITING EAST TIMOR PRESIDENT GUSMAO. AFTER 
CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT GUSMAO ON RECEIVING THE NATIONAL 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTE\'S HARRIMAN AWARD AND THE BIRTH OF HIS 
THIRD CHILD, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY ASKED PRESIDENT GUSMAO 
ABOUT HIS VIEWS ON THE CHALLENGES EAST TIMOR FACES, ITS 
RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA, OIL REVENUES, REFUGEES, AND WHAT 
ASSISTANCE THE U.S. COULD PROVIDE THE NEW NATION. 
PRESIDENT GUSMAO SAID RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA WERE STILL 
\"FRAGILE.\" ON ACCOUNTABILITY FOR 1999 ATROCITIES, HE SAID 
HE WOULD TRY TO CONVINCE INDONESIAN PRESIDENT YUDHOYONO AT 
A DECEMBER 14 MEETING TO ACCEPT A UN COMMISSION OF 
EXPERTS, BUT HE ALSO EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT GOI 
WILLINGNESS TO FACE THE ISSUE. PRESIDENT GUSMAO ALSO 
CANDIDLY GAVE HIS VIEWS ON THE JUDICIAL SECTOR IN HIS 
COUNTRY. END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------- 
EAST TIMOR - INDONESIA RELATIONS 
-------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) PRESIDENT GUSMAO SAID RELATIONS BETWEEN EAST TIMOR 
AND INDONESIA WERE STILL \"FRAGILE.\" HE AGREED WITH DEPUTY 
SECRETARY ARMITAGE\'S ASSESSMENT THAT SUSILO BAMBANG 
YUDHOYONO (SBY) APPEARED TO BE MORE REASONABLE THAN FORMER 
PRESIDENT MEGAWATI. HOWEVER, PRESIDENT GUSMAO CAUTIONED 
THAT THE GOET DID NOT EXPECT ANY BIG CHANGES IN INDONESIAN 
POLICY BECAUSE SBY, THOUGH A FORMER GENERAL, STILL NEEDS 
THE SUPPORT OF THE INDONESIAN MILITARY. HE HOPES SBY WILL 
BE ABLE TO FULFILL HIS PROMISES OF REFORM BUT EXPECTS THAT 
HIS TASK WILL NOT BE EASY. WHEN ASKED ABOUT BITTERNESS 
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS, PRESIDENT GUSMAO ANSWERED THAT 
THE BITTERNESS REMAINS IN THE HEARTS OF THE INDONESIAN 
GENERALS, SOME OF WHOM ADMIT WHAT THEY DID IN EAST TIMOR 
IN 1999 WAS WRONG BUT AVOID DISCUSSING THE ISSUE.    WHEN 
ASKED ABOUT EAST TIMORESE REFUGEES, PRESIDENT GUSMAO 
REPLIED THAT THERE WERE ABOUT 29,000 SCATTERED THROUGHOUT 
INDONESIA AND THAT MOST HAD SETTLED THERE PERMANENTLY. HE 
SPECULATED THAT ABOUT HALF MAY CHOOSE TO RETURN TO EAST 
TIMOR SOME DAY. 
 
-------------- 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
-------------- 
 
 6. (C) PRESIDENT GUSMAO BELIEVED THAT SBY WOULD NOT BE ANY 
MORE COOPERATIVE THAN MEGAWATI WAS WITH THE UN REGARDING 
THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE CRIMES COMMITTED IN 
EAST TIMOR IN 1999. PRESIDENT GUSMAO STATED THAT HE 
PLANNED TO MEET SBY IN BALI ON DECEMBER 14 AND USE THAT 
OCCASION TO TRY TO PERSUADE HIM TO ACCEPT THE UN\'S 
COMMISSION OF EXPERTS.  DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE ASKED 
PRESIDENT GUSMAO IF HE ENVISIONED A LIKELY SOUTH AFRICAN 
TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION MODEL. WHEN PRESIDENT GUSMAO 
INQUIRED WHETHER THE SOUTH AFRICA MODEL NAMED NAMES, THE 
DEPUTY SECRETARY ANSWERED THAT NAMES WOULD HAVE TO BE 
NAMED AND THAT THERE MUST BE TRUTH BEFORE RECONCILIATION 
CAN OCCUR. PRESIDENT GUSMAO COMMENTED THAT FOR EAST TIMOR, 
THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION WOULD BE AN ARRANGEMENT 
THAT WOULD NAME NAMES. 
 
----------------------- 
EAST TIMOR\'S CHALLENGES 
----------------------- 
 
7. (C) EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE JUSTICE SECTOR IN EAST 
TIMOR, PRESIDENT GUSMAO EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO BUILD 
CAPACITY IN THE SECTOR BY TRAINING GOOD PROSECUTORS, 
LAWYERS, AND JUDGES. HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CHANGING THEIR MENTALITY AND IMPROVING THEIR 
PROFESSIONALISM. PRESIDENT GUSMAO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE 
WERE SOME DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE GOET REGARDING THE 
APPROACH TO THIS TRAINING (NOTE: LIKELY REFERRING TO THE 
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE\'S PREFERENCE FOR TRAINING IN 
PORTUGUESE AND BY CIVIL LAW NATIONS SUCH AS PORTUGAL). 
ASSESSING TIMOR\'S GENERAL CONDITION, PRESIDENT GUSMAO 
INDICATED THE NEED FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT CAPACITY AND 
ESPECIALLY FOR FIGHTING CORRUPTION. DEPUTY SECRETARY 
ARMITAGE AGREED THAT THIS WOULD BE TOUGH BUT ESPECIALLY 
IMPORTANT ONCE THE MONEY FROM THE OIL REVENUES BEGINS TO 
COME IN. PRESIDENT GUSMAO REPLIED THAT AN OIL FUND WAS 
BEING CREATED WITH THE HELP OF THE IMF AND WORLD BANK TO 
ENSURE THAT ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSPARENT.   THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY ASKED WHETHER THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR WERE 
PATIENT ENOUGH TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THE OIL INCOME. 
PRESIDENT GUSMAO REPLIED THAT THE $100 MILLION LEVEL WOULD 
NOT BE REACHED FOR ANOTHER THREE TO FOUR YEARS DUE TO 
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES. HE ADDED THAT THE GOET\'S ENTIRE 
ANNUAL BUDGET IS ONLY $75 MILLION. 
 
8. (C) PRESIDENT GUSMAO DESCRIBED THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF 
HIS PEOPLE IN 2001, ESPECIALLY FOR JOBS. HE SAID THAT 
ALTHOUGH EXPECTATIONS HAVE LOWERED, ONE CHALLENGE IS 
CONVINCING THE UNEMPLOYED YOUTH WHO HAVE FLOODED DILI TO 
RETURN TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
AGRICULTURE SECTOR THERE. PRESIDENT GUSMAO IS TRYING TO 
WORK WITH THE WORLD BANK AND IMF TO PURSUE THIS. 
 
9. (C) REMARKING THAT THE USG WOULD \"SAVE\" ABOUT $20 
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN THE UN MISSION IN EAST TIMOR ENDED IN 
MAY, 2005, PRESIDENT GUSMAO SMILINGLY ASKED WHETHER THE 
USG COULD USE SOME OF THAT AMOUNT TO PROVIDE TIMOR WITH 
FURTHER ASSISTANCE. JOKINGLY COMMENDING GUSMAO FOR HIS 
BUSINESS ACUMEN, DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE SAID THAT THE 
USG WOULD CONTINUE ITS ASSISTANCE TO EAST TIMOR AND LOOK 
INTO OTHER WAYS THAT IT COULD HELP IN THE FUTURE, 
ESPECIALLY THROUGH MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE 
WORLD BANK. 
 
 
-------------------- 
ARMY-POLICE TENSIONS 
-------------------- 
 
10. (C) WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 
MILITARY (A GREAT NUMBER OF WHOM ARE VETERANS) AND THE 
POLICE IN TIMOR, PRESIDENT GUSMAO AGREED THAT TENSIONS 
EXISTED. HE SAID THERE WAS SOME FEELING OF FRUSTRATION 
AND RESENTMENT AMONG THE MILITARY SINCE THE POLICE 
OFFICERS, MANY OF WHOM ONCE SERVED UNDER THE INDONESIANS, 
NOW APPEARED TO HAVE THE REAL POWER. HE SAID THERE IS A 
NEED FOR THE ARMY TO FEEL USEFUL AND NOT PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
INFERIOR TO THE POLICE. DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE SAID 
THAT HE SENSED THIS TENSION AND RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO 
IMPROVE THE ARMY\'S SELF-ESTEEM. PRESIDENT GUSMAO 
EMPHASIZED THE NEED FOR WORKSHOPS AND TRAINING PROGRAMS IN 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FOR TIMORESE POLICE 
OFFICERS OUTSIDE OF TIMOR WHERE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO 
CHANGE THEIR MINDSETS. (COMMENT: PRESIDENT GUSMAO SAID HE 
DID NOT FAVOR MALAYSIA AS AN APPROPRIATE OUTSIDE VENUE BUT 
DID FAVOR THAILAND. END COMMENT.) WHEN THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY RAISED A QUESTION ABOUT CURRENT COUNTER- 
TERRORISM TRAINING, AMBASSADOR REES REPLIED THAT THERE IS 
NONE BECAUSE OF RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. DECLARING THAT \"WE 
ARE ALL FRONTLINE STATES\" AND TIMOR CANNOT ESCAPE ITS 
GEOGRAPHY, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY STATED THAT A SMALL SUCH 
PROGRAM COULD BE CONSIDERED. 
 
------------------------------------- 
BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE 
------------------------------------- 
 
11. (C) WHEN DEPUTY SECRETARY ARMITAGE ASKED ABOUT WORLD 
BANK AND IMF ASSISTANCE, PRESIDENT GUSMAO REPLIED THAT 
BOTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE PROMISED TO SUPPORT TIMOR AND THAT 
THE GOET WANTS TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT BORROWING BUT WILL 
TAKE LOANS THAT SUPPORT GOOD PROJECTS, PROVIDING A 
TRANSPARENT PROCESS IS IN PLACE.
