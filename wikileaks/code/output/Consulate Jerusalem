INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY 
------------------------ 
 
2.  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM IS POSING AN 
INCREASING CHALLENGE TO SECULAR NATIONALIST 
PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS ON THE WEST BANK. 
RECENT WEEKS HAVE SEEN DIRECT CHALLENGES BY THE 
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD-CREATED GROUP \"HAMAS\" TO THE 
PLO/UNIFIED NATIONAL LEADERSHIP OF THE UPRISING 
(UNLU) WHICH CURRENTLY LEADS THE UPRISING.  THIS 
CHALLENGE, WHICH HAS MET WITH MIXED SUCCESS, HAS 
TAKEN THE FORM OF LEAFLETS CRITICAL OF UNLU AND 
THE PLO, ATTEMPTS TO IMPOSE ALTERNATIVE STRIKE 
DAYS, AND EVEN CLASHES IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES. 
THUS FAR, HAMAS HAS DEMONSTRATED STRENGTH IN 
THOSE AREAS WHERE EXISTING ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS 
HAVE WIDESPREAD POPULAR SUPPORT:  NABLUS AND THE 
NORTHERN WEST BANK, WHERE IT SEEMS TO BE BEST 
ORGANIZED; THE RAMALLAH-EL BIREH AREA; AND 
HEBRON.  ITS ATTEMPTS TO MAKE INROADS INTO THE 
CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT 
SAHOUR HAVE BEEN RESISTED BY LOCAL RESIDENTS. 
HAMAS REMAINS WEAK IN COSMOPOLITAN EAST 
JERUSALEM.  WHATEVER THE CURRENT ACTUAL STRENGTH 
OF HAMAS--AND ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY--IT HAS 
SUCCEEDED IN BECOMING A FACTOR TO BE RECKONED 
WITH IN CONSIDERING THE FUTURE OF THE INTIFADA 
ON THE WEST BANK. 
 
3.  HAMAS IS NOT THE ONLY MUSLIM FUNDAMENTALIST 
GROUP FUNCTIONING ON THE WEST BANK.  THE FATAH- 
AFFILIATED \"ISLAMIC JIHAD\"--NOT TO BE CONFUSED 
WITH THE SHIITE GROUP OF THE SAME NAME FOUND IN 
LEBANON AND ELSEWHERE--WAS CRIPPLED BY THE 
KILLING OF THREE SENIOR LEADERS IN CYPRUS.  IT 
HAS NOT RECOVERED TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AS AN 
INDEPENDENT PLAYER IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE 
HEARTS AND MINDS OF WEST BANK PALESTINIANS. 
OTHER SMALL, SHADOWY GROUPS ALSO RISE AND FALL, 
CREATING LITTLE MORE THAN A RIPPLE. 
 
4.  THIS REPORT IS ONLY A PRELIMINARY ATTEMPT TO 
IDENTIFY QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY.  ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO 
PENETRATE; UNDERSTANDING THEIR INTERNAL 
STRUCTURES AND EXTERNAL GOALS WILL TAKE MUCH 
TIME AND PATIENCE.  THIS IS A FIRST PASS AT THE 
SUBJECT ON THE WEST BANK, BASED TO A LARGE 
EXTENT ON CONTACTS FROM JERUSALEM AND THE 
NORTHERN WEST BANK CITY OF NABLUS.  WE HAVE LESS 
COMPLETE INFORMATION ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
SOUTHERN WEST BANK.  GAZA HAS ITS OWN PATTERN OF 
ISLAMIC POLITICS.  WE WOULD WELCOME INFORMATION 
FROM CAIRO AND AMMAN ON EGYPTIAN AND JORDANIAN 
ISLAMIC POLITICAL TIES WITH THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES.  END SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION. 
 
HAMAS--BACKGROUND AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW 
----------------------------------------- 
 
5.  HAMAS IS A CREATION OF THE MUSLIM 
BROTHERHOOD (MB), WITH TIES TO THE MB THROUGHOUT 
THE ISLAMIC WORLD.  THE NAME \"HAMAS\" WAS 
APPARENTLY CHOSEN IN FEBRUARY 1988, BUT NOT USED 
EXTENSIVELY UNTIL MAY.  AN ACRONYM FOR \"ISLAMIC 
RESISTANCE MOVEMENT,\" THE WORD ITSELF IS ARABIC 
FOR \"ZEALOTS.\" 
 
6.  ALTHOUGH PALESTINIANS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF 
THE WEST BANK HAVE STRONG ISLAMIC CONVICTIONS, 
THEY TEND TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES POLITICALLY IN 
SECULAR TERMS.  ISLAM HAS, HOWEVER, PLAYED A 
ROLE IN WEST BANK POLITICS SINCE THE LATE 1940S, 
WHEN THE MB FIRST CAME TO THE WEST BANK.  THE MB 
WAS SHORTLY AFTER DISCREDITED IN THE EYES OF 
PALESTINIANS BY ITS SUPPORT FOR KING HUSSEIN IN 
HIS POWER STRUGGLE AGAINST PM NABULSI IN THE 
MID-50S.  DURING JORDANIAN RULE, IT WAS TIGHTLY 
MONITORED BY JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE AND DID NOT 
GAIN SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE UNTIL THE MID- TO 
LATE-70S, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK. 
 
7.  IN 1976, M0 SUPPORTERS ATTACKED AND BURNED A 
NABLUS THEATER SHOWING AN \"IMMODEST\" PLAY.  THIS 
IS OFTEN CONSIDERED THE BEGINNING OF THE MB\'S 
EMERGENCE AS A VIABLE POLITICAL FORCE IN THE 
NORTHERN WEST BANK.  ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS 
BUILT A POWER BASE IN AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY, WHERE 
THEY GAINED CONTROL OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL IN 
1978.  THIS SURGE IN POPULARITY WAS PROBABLY DUE 
TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS:  1) THE RISE OF 
KHOMEINISM IN IRAN, WHICH GAVE FUNDAMENTALISM A 
BOOST THROUGHOUT THE MUSLIM WORLD; 2) THE 
DISCREDITING OF TRADITIONAL ARAB LEADERS IN THE 
WAKE OF SADAT\'S TRIP TO JERUSALEM; 3) A LARGE 
INFLOW OF MONEY FROM THE MB IN JORDAN AND EGYPT; 
AND 4) THE DENIAL BY FUNDAMENTALISTS THAT THEY 
BELONGED TO THE FORMERLY DISCREDITED MB-- 
INSTEAD, THEY CALLED THEMSELVES THE \"INDEPENDENT 
ISLAMIC BLOC.\" 
 
8.  SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS AT AN-NAJAH, 
AS ELSEWHERE IN THE WEST BANK, HAS EBBED AND 
FLOWED ACCORDING TO THE PLO\'S FORTUNES AND THE 
STATUS OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE MUSLIM WORLD. 
SECULAR LEADERS IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK, AIDED 
BY PLO MONEY, WORKED TO CONTAIN THE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS AND REDUCE THEIR INFLUENCE IN 
AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY.  THE FUNDAMENTALISTS LOST 
CREDIBILITY, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE PLO BORE THE 
BRUNT OF THE FIGHTING DU8ING THE 1982 INVASION 
OF LEBANON AND DURING THE PERIOD OF ARAFAT- 
HUSSEIN RECONCILIATION.  THEY HAVE GAINED 
STRENGTH WHEN THE PLO APPEARED WEAK AND DIVIDED. 
 
9.  BY THE END OF 1987, FUNDAMENTALISTS AND 
NATIONALISTS IN THE NORTHERN WEST BANK HAD 
ACHIEVED AN UNEASY STATUS QUO MARKED BY 
OCCASIONAL VIOLENT CLASHES.  IN NABLUS THE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS TENDED TO BE RESENTED BY THE 
SECULAR COMMUNITY, BUT ALSOFEARED. 
 
10.  WHEN THE INTIFADA BEGAN, THE MB ACTED 
DECISIVELY TO SEIZE A ROLE.  SEVERAL FACTORS 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE MB DECISION TO INVOLVE ITSELF 
FOR SEVERAL REASONS.  ISLAMIC JIHAD HAD WON 
CONSIDERABLE PRESTIGE FOR ITS ROLE IN GAZA, AND 
THE MB FEARED LOSING SUPPORT AND CREDIBILITY IN 
THE FUNDAMENTALIST COMMUNITY.  INDIVIDUAL MB 
MEMBERS WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTIFADA; 
THE MB LEADERSHIP FEARED THAT IF MEMBERS COULD 
NOT USE THE MB AS A VEHICLE FOR PARTICIPATION, 
THEY WOULD TURN TO OTHER FUNDAMENTALIST OR 
NATIONALIST ORGANIZATIONS.  MB LEADERS BELIEVED, 
THEN AS NOW, THAT THE INTIFADA WILL BE CARRIED 
TO A CONCLUSION.  THEY WANTED A SAY IN THAT 
FINAL SETTLEMENT.  FINALLY, THE MB HAD A 
READY-MADE ORGANIZATION PRESENT IN THE WEST 
BANK.  ACCORDINGLY, THE MB CREATED HAMAS IN 
FEBRUARY 1988 AND BEGAN ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE 
UPRISING. 
 
HAMAS--STRUCTURE 
---------------- 
 
11.  THE MB HAS ITS HEADQUARTERS IN CAIRO, WITH 
A BRANCH IN AMMAN.  SUB-BRANCHES ARE PRESENT IN 
THE WEST BANK (NABLUS) AND GAZA.  THE HEAD OF 
THE MB IN THE WEST BANK REPORTEDLY IS NABIL 
BUSHTAWI, OF NABLUS.  OTHER KEY WEST-BANK 
FIGURES FROM NABLUS ARE SHEIKH SAID BILAL AND 
HAMID BITAWI. 
 
12.  THE RELATION BETWEEN CAIRO, AMMAN, THE WEST 
BANK, AND GAZA REMAINS UNCLEAR, AS IS THE 
RELATION BETWEEN THE NABLUS LEADERSHIP AND OTHER 
AREAS OF THE WEST BANK.  THERE ARE STRONG LINKS 
WITH CAIRO AND AMMAN, AND SOME MB LEADERS MAY 
HOLD POSITIONS IN JORDANIAN INTELLIGENCE. 
APPARENTLY, KY DECISIONS ARE MADE IN CAIRO AND 
AMMAN, BUT LOCAL UNITS RETAIN CONSIDERABLE 
INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION.  MONEY FLOWS IN FROM 
CAIRO AND AMMAN, AS WELL AS BEING RAISED LOCALLY 
THROUGH THE MOSQUES. 
 
13.  THE MB IN NABLUS REPORTEDLY CONSISTS OF 
APPROXIMATELY 150 MEMBERS HEADED BY A 4 OR 5 MAN 
COMMITTEE.  THE LEADERSHIP CONSISTS OF MUSLIM 
SHEIKHS, UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS AT AN-NAJAH AND 
BIR ZEIT UNIVERSITIES, INSTRUCTORS AT THE 
KULLIYET AL-DAWA (AN ISLAMIC COLLEGE AFFILIATED 
WITH JERUSALEM UNIVERSITY, LOCATED IN BEIT 
HANINA, NORTH JERUSALEM), EMPLOYEES OF THE 
ISLAMIC WAQF, A SHARIA JUDGE, AND VARIOUS 
MERCHANTS.  THE \"FOOT SOLDIERS\" OF HAMAS/MB IN 
NABLUS CONSIST OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTHS FROM THE 
POORER SECTIONS OF THE OLD TOWN (CASBAH).  THIS 
NETWORK SEEMS TO BE STABLE--FEW ARRESTS, FEW 
DEFECTIONS, FEW NEW CONVERTS. 
 
14.  THE LEADERSHIP MAKES USE OF THE MOSQUES TO 
PLAN, PROSELYTIZE, INSTRUCT, AND RAISE MONEY. 
THIS IS A MAJOR ADVANTAGE HAMAS POSSESSES OVER 
THE UNLU, SINCE MANY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS 
UNIVERSITIES, CHARITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL 
SOCIETIES THROUGH WHICH THE UNLU COULD OPERATE 
HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY ISRAELI AUTHORITIES. 
 
HAMAS--METHOD OF OPERATION 
-------------------------- 
 
15.  ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT BY TIGHTLY KNIT 
CELLS OF AS FEW AS FIVE MEMBERS.  OUTSIDERS 
RARELY PARTICIPATE IN HAMAS ACTIONS, A 
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE FROM INTIFADA ACTIVITIES 
IN GENERAL, WHICH DERIVE CONSIDERABLE STRENGTH 
FROM THE SPONTANEOUS PARTICIPATION OF LARGE 
NUMBERS OF PALESTINIANS.  HAMAS ALSO SEEKS 
MAXIMUM PUBLICITY FOR ITS ACTS.  BEFORE A 
STRIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, RED SPRAY-PAINTED 
INSTRUCTIONS--BOLDLY SIGNED \"HAMAS\"--ARE IN 
EVIDENCE THROUGHOUT AREAS OF HAMAS INFLUENCE. 
AS A RESULT OF ITS PENCHANT FOR TIGHT CONTROL 
AND PUBLICITY, HAMAS TENDS NOT TO COOPERATE IN 
UNLU-ORGANIZED ACTIONS.  IN NABLUS, FOR EXAMPLE, 
HAMAS HAS REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPROMPTU 
BLOOD DRIVES ORGANIZED ON SHORT NOTICE BY 
POPULAR COMMITTEES TO TREAT WOUNDED PALESTINIANS. 
 
16.  HAMAS USES DIFFERENT METHODS TO ENFORCE ITS 
STRIKE CALLS, DEPENDING ON ITS STRENGTH IN THE 
TOWN INVOLVED.  IN RAMALLAH AND THE BEIT HANINA 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF NORTH JERUSALEM, FOR EXAMPLE, 
HAMAS FOLLOWERS REPORTEDLY WERE ON THE SCENE TO 
ENFORCE THE SEPTEMBER 9 STRIKE.  ALTHOUGH NO 
CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN THESE AREAS, THERE HAVE 
BEEN CONFRONTATIONS WITH UNLU SUPPORTERS ON 
PRIOR OCCASIONS.  NO CLASHES WERE REPORTED IN 
NABLUS, APPARENTLY BECAUSE THE UNLU CHOSE NOT TO 
TEST HAMAS\' STRENGTH.  IN THE PAST, HOWEVER, 
HAMAS HAS FIREBOMBED CHRISTIAN SHOPS THAT SOLD 
LIQUOR OR OTHERWISE DEFIED ITS ORDERS.  IN 
BETHLEHEM, TIRES WERE BURNED AND THERE WERE 
CONFRONTATIONS BETWEEN HAMAS AND UNLU SUPPORTERS 
ON THE OCCASION OF THE SEPTEMBER 9 STRIKE.  SOME 
SHOPS WERE INTIMIDATED INTO CLOSING EARLY. 
HOWEVER, MOST STAYED OPEN.  IN JERUSALEM, HAMAS 
WAS NOT IN EVIDENCE, AND THE STIKE CALL WAS 
LARGELY IGNORED. 
 
HAMAS--RELATIVE REGIONAL STRENGTH 
--------------------------------- 
17.  HAMAS APPEARS TO BE STRONGEST IN GAZA.  IN 
THE WEST BANK, IT SEEMS TO BE BASED IN THE 
TOWNS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHERE THE INHABITANTS 
ARE RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS 
BENT. ITS PRIMARY WEST BANK STRONGHOLDS, IN 
DESCENDING ORDER OF INFLUENCE, APPEAR TO BE 
NABLUS, RAMALLAH, AND HEBRON.  HAMAS IS PRESENT 
IN JERUSALEM, PARTICULARLY THE BEIT HANINA 
NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTH JERUSALEM NEAR RAMALLAH. 
IN DOWNTOWN EAST JERUSALEM AND THE OLD CITY, 
HAMAS IS PRESENT BUT WEAK, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF 
THE COSMOPOLITAN CHARACTER OF THESE AREAS. 
HAMAS IS TRYING TO INCREASE ITS FOOTHOLD IN THE 
CHRISTIAN AREA OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT 
SAHOUR, THOUGH THUS FAR ITS INTIMIDATION TACTICS 
HAVE NOT PROVED SUCCESSFUL.  (IN FACT, HAMAS 
ACTIONS IN THESE CHRISTIAN AREAS HAVE LED TO THE 
REAPPEARANCE OF HAMAM, THE \"CHRISTIAN\" 
RESISTANCE MOVEMENT, WHOSE ACRONYM FORMS THE 
ARABIC WORD FOR \"DOVE.\")  WE DO NOT YET HAVE A 
GOOD FEEL FOR HAMAS IN HEBRON, THOUGH WE KNOW IT 
HAS BEEN ACTIVE.  THE AUGUST 21 AND SEPTEMBER 9 
STRIKE CALLS WERE OBSERVED THERE.  IN ADDITION, 
ITS INHABITANTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE STRONG 
RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HERE 
AS ELSEWHERE MUCH OF HAMAS\' STRENGTH DERIVES 
FROM THE POPULATION\'S TRADITIONAL SUPPORT FOR 
ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS, RATHER THAN FROM A 
CONSCIOUS DECISION TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HAMAS AND 
THE PLO. 
 
18.  HAMAS IS THOUGHT TO BE WEAK IN THE 
COUNTRYSIDE, WHERE THE MB HAS TRADITIONALLY 
LACKED INFLUENCE AND ORGANIZATION, AND IN THE 
REFUGEE CAMPS, WHERE SECULAR NATIONALIST 
MOVEMENTS (FATAH, PFLP, COMMUNISTS, ETC.) REMAIN 
FIRMLY ENTRENCHED.  AN INTERESTING EXCEPTION IS 
NEW ASKAR CAMP WHERE, BECAUSE OF THE ARREST OF 
ALMOST THE ENTIRE FATAH LEADERSHIP, HAMAS HAS 
BEEN ABLE TO MOVE IN AND ORGANIZE. 
 
19.  IT IS DIFFICULT ACCURATELY TO GAUGE HAMAS\' 
STRENGTH FROM THE SUCCESS OF ITS STRIKE CALLS. 
HAMAS HAS CHOSEN ITS DAYS WISELY--AUGUST 21 WAS 
THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ATTEMPT TO BURN THE 
AL-AQSA MOSQUE, A TRADITIONAL DAY OF PROTEST, 
AND SEPTEMBER 9 WAS BOTH A FRIDAY, WHEN MANY 
SHOPS ARE CLOSED ANYWAY, AND THE BEGINNING OF A 
NEW MONTH OF THE INTIFADA, AGAIN A TRADITIONAL 
DAY OF PROTEST.  THUS, HAMAS WAS CALLING FOR 
STRIKES ON DAYS THAT PEOPLE CUSTOMARILY MARK 
WITH STRIKES AND PROTESTS AND DID NOT ACT 
AGAINST THE FLOW OF THE INTIFADA. 
 
 
HAMAS--RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL 
------------------------------- 
20.  MANY WEST BANKERS BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL 
ACTIVELY SUPPORTS HAMAS IN AN EFFORT TO DIVIDE 
PALESTINIANS AND WEAKEN THE INTIFADA.  THEY 
POINT TO THE FACT THAT HAMAS OPERATIVES ACT 
BOLDLY IN DISTRIBUTING THEIR LEAFLETS. 
SHOPKEEPERS IN JERUSALEM AND NABLUS REPORT THAT, 
WHEREAS UNLU LEAFLETS ARE DISTRIBUTED SECRETLY 
FOR FEAR OF ISRAELI SECURITY FORCES, HAMAS 
OPERATIVES WALK INTO SHOPS AND PRESENT THEIR 
LEAFLETS DIRECTLY TO THE OWNERS.  MAYOR FREIJ OF 
BETHLEHEM CLAIMS THAT MEMBERS OF SOME WELL KNOWN 
FAMILIES WHO COLLABORATE WITH ISRAELI OFFICIALS 
HAVE BEEN SEEN AMONG HAMAS STREET GANGS IN 
BETHLEHEM.  FURTHERMORE, DESPITE MASSIVE 
ARRESTS--AND THE PUBLIC IDENTITY OF MANY MB 
LEADERS--RELATIVELY FEW HAMAS LEADERS HAVE BEEN 
DETAINED.  IN RECENT WEEKS, FUNDAMENTALIST 
LEADERS HAVE GIVEN INTERVIEWS TO ISRAELI 
PUBLICATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE LANDED SECULARIST 
LEADERS IN DETENTION.  WE BELIEVE THAT, WHILE 
ISRAELI FORCES MAY BE TURNING A BLIND EYE TO 
HAMAS ACTIVITIES, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE 
TO CONCLUDE THAT ISRAEL IS PROVIDING ACTIVE 
SUPPORT. 
 
HAMAS--RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INTIFADA LEADERSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
21.  HAMAS\' FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, AS SET OUT 
IN ITS AUGUST 18 CHARTER (REF B), PUT IT IN 
OPPOSITION TO THE SECULAR LEADERSHIP OF THE 
INTIFADA.  ACCORDING TO THE CHARTER, HAMAS 
CONSIDERS ALL OF PALESTINE AN ISLAMIC \"WAQF,\" OR 
TRUST FROM GOD.  CEDING ANY PART OF IT TO A 
JEWISH STATE WOULD VIOLATE THAT TRUST.  HAMAS 
OPPOSES THE TWO-STATE SOLUTION TOWARD WHICH THE 
PLO SEEMS TO BE INCHING.  IT OPPOSES THE 
CREATION OF A SECULAR STATE IN PALESTINE, AS 
CALLED FOR IN THE PLO COVENANT.  INSTEAD, IT 
DEMANDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ISLAMIC STATE. 
IT ALSO OPPOSES CONVENING AN INTERNATIONAL PEACE 
CONFERENCE.  AS HAMAS LEAFLET NO. 28 SUCCINCTLY 
PHRASED IT, \"NEGOTIATION WITH THE ENEMY IS 
RETREAT AND CAPITULATION.\"  INSTEAD, HAMAS CALLS 
FOR LIBERATING ALL OF PALESTINE THROUGH 
JIHAD--BOTH ARMED STRUGGLE AND PROSELYTIZING. 
 
24.  THIS HAMAS/UNLU COMPETITION HAS LED TO A 
BATTLE OF LEAFLETS AND STRIKE CALLS.  HAMAS 
LEAFLETS EXCORIATE THE PLO--PARTICULARLY FATAH-- 
AND THE UNLU FOR CAPITULATING TO THE ZIONIST 
ENEMY.  UNLU, IN RESPONSE, ACCUSES HAMAS OF 
SERVING ISRAEL BY DIVIDING THE UPRISING.  AT THE 
SAME TIME, UNLU INVITES HAMAS TO JOIN THE 
INTIFADA LEADERSHIP. 
 
25.  HAMAS, TO DATE, HAS REJECTED ALL CALLS FOR 
UNITY WITH UNLU.  ONE EXCUSE OFTEN HEARD IS THAT 
HAMAS WILL NOT SIT ON THE SAME COMMITTEE WITH 
THE COMMUNISTS.  OTHERS SAY IT WILL NOT SIT WITH 
ANY LEFTIST GROUP, SUCH AS THE PFLP.  OTHER 
SOURCES, INCLUDING SOME CLOSE TO THE HAMAS 
LEADERSHIP IN NABLUS, HAVE TOLD US HAMAS HAS 
AGREED IN PRIVATE TO A TWO-STATE SOLUTION AND 
WILL SOON JOIN NOT ONLY THE UNLU BUT THE PLO 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AS WELL.  ACCORDING TO THESE 
REPORTS, HAMAS IS MAINTAINING ITS PUBLIC STANCE 
IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNLU IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN 
ITS ORGANIZATION. 
 
24.  UNDOUBTEDLY, THERE ARE CONTACTS AND EVEN 
OCCASIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. 
HOWEVER, RECONCILIATION AND/OR UNITY BETWEEN 
THEM SEEMS UNLIKELY AT THIS TIME.  HAMAS APPEARS 
GENUINELY COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF CREATING AN 
ISLAMIC STATE IN ALL OF PALESTINE.  THIS IS A 
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE WITH THE SECULAR 
NATIONALISTS THAT CANNOT BE PAPERED OVER.  IT IS 
THEREFORE LIKELY THAT THE UNLU AND HAMAS WOULD 
FORGE A PERMANENT ALLIANCE. 
 
25.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAMAS RETAINS ITS FEAR OF 
BEING COOPTED INTO THE NATIONALIST MOVEMENT AND 
BECOMING IRRELEVANT.  THIS FEAR WAS ONE OF THE 
MAIN FACTORS SPURRING THE CREATION OF HAMAS.  IT 
IS IMPROBABLE THAT THE MB WOULD SACRIFICE ITS 
CREATION NOW, JUST WHEN IT IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE 
AS A PLAYER.  HOWEVER, SHOULD HAMAS FAIL TO 
MAINTAIN ITS FOOTHOLD AND BECOME THREATENED WITH 
EXTINCTION OR IRRELEVANCE, IT MIGHT AT THAT 
POINT CONSIDER COOPERATING WITH THE SECULARIST 
NATIONALIST LEADERSHIP OF THE UNLU FOR TACTICAL 
REASONS. 
 
HAMAS--PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE 
------------------------------- 
 
26.  GAUGING THE CURRENT STRENGTH OF HAMAS IS A 
RISKY ENDEAVOR.  IN MANY REGIONS OF THE WEST 
BANK, ISLAMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE HELD IN HIGH 
REGARD, AND SUPPORT FOR HAMAS APPEARS TO DERIVE 
MUCH OF ITS STRENGTH FROM THAT TRADITIONAL 
RESPECT RATHER THAN FROM A CONSCIOUS CHOICE 
BETWEEN FUNDAMENTALIST AND SECULAR OPTIONS. 
NEVERTHELESS, HAMAS IS BEING TAKEN INCREASINGLY 
SERIOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE WEST BANK.  WHETHER 
THAT IS BECAUSE OF ACTUAL STRENGTH AND 
INFLUENCE, OR MERELY DUE TO INSPIRED 
SELF-PROMOTION, WE CANNOT SAY.  IN ANY CASE, IT 
IS CLEAR THAT THE HAMAS PHENOMENON WILL BE A 
SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN FUTURE CALCULATIONS. 
 
27.  ALTHOUGH ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM WILL REMAIN 
A FEATURE OF THE WEST BANK LANDSCAPE, IMPORTANT 
FACTORS WORK AGAINST IT BECOMING A PERVASIVE 
INFLUENCE OR REPLACING THE SECULARIST STRAIN IN 
WEST BANK POLITICS.  WEST BANKERS AS A WHOLE ARE 
WELL EDUCATED, MUCH TRAVELED, AND CAPITALISTIC 
IN ORIENTATION.  THEY ARE UNLIKELY WILLINGLY TO 
TURN TO THE NARROW ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST WORLD 
VIEW, NO MATTER HOW DEEP THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT 
WITH THE PLO LEADERSHIP. 
 
28.  AS NOTED ABOVE, THE MB HAS HAD ONLY A BRIEF 
AND UNDISTINGUISHED HISTORY IN THE WEST BANK. 
IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT, THE INTIFADA ENJOYS 
VERY WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AMONG WEST BANKERS, WHO 
ARE GENERALLY OPPOSED TO ANY EFFORT TO DISRUPT 
THIS UNITY AND THREATEN THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 
THE UPRISING.  THUS FAR, PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN 
FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE UNLU AND HAMAS, AND 
SUPPORT FOR THE FUNDAMENTALISTS HAS BEEN 
RELATIVELY COST FREE.  IN A SHOWDOWN BETWEEN THE 
UNLU AND HAMAS, MUCH OF THAT SUPPORT COULD MELT 
AWAY. 
 
29.  IN ADDITION THE WEST BANK, UNLIKE GAZA, 
CONTAINS AN IMPORTANT CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.  AS 
NOTED ABOVE, HAMAS IS MEETING RESISTANCE IN THE 
CHRISTIAN ENCLAVE OF BETHLEHEM-BEIT JALA-BEIT 
SAHOUR, EVEN TO THE POINT OF STIMULATING THE 
REACTIVATION OF A RIVAL CHRISTIAN GROUP.  STILL, 
HAMAS HAS EXTENDED ITS INFLUENCE TO THE LARGELY 
CHRISTIAN RAMALLAH-EL BIREH AREA, PROVING THAT 
IT CAN SURVIVE IN A MIXED CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM 
ENVIRONMENT.  THE CHRISTIAN CHARACTER OF THESE 
AREAS IS ALSO SLOWLY BEING DILUTED AS CHRISTIANS 
EMIGRATE TO FRIENDLIER CLIMES. 
 
30.  NONETHELESS, DESPITE THE FACTORS WORKING 
AGAINST THE SPREAD OF FUNDAMENTALIST INFLUENCE, 
THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH FUNDAMENTALIST 
STRENGTH COULD GROW TO THE POINT THAT HAMAS 
WOULD BECOME A SPOILER IN ATTEMPTS TO BRING 
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS TOGETHER.  ALTHOUGH 
WIDESPREAD DECAPITATION THROUGH ARREST OF THE 
UNLU LEADERSHIP IS NOT LIKELY, GIVEN ITS 
OVERWHELMING POPULAR SUPPORT, ISRAELI EFFORTS TO 
DO SO TEND TO PROMOTE HAMAS IN SPECIFIC AREAS, 
SUCH AS IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE NEW ASKAR CAMP 
GIVEN ABOVE. 
 
31.  WEST BANKERS ARE BOTH RELIGIOUS AND 
NATIONALISTIC.  THUS FAR, THEIR POLITICS HAVE 
FOLLOWED THE NATIONALIST BENT OF THEIR CHARACTER 
AND CULTURE.  THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THE PLO 
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THE PLO IS THE ONLY VIABLE 
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPRESSION OF 
PALESTINIAN NATIONALISM.  THEY HAVE THEREFORE 
CONTINUED TO BACK THE PLO DESPITE MANY 
DISAPPOINTMENTS, AND THE MAJORITY ARE LIKELY TO 
CONTINUE TO DO SO.  HOWEVER, SHOULD THE PLO FAIL 
TO OVERCOME ITS IDEOLOGICAL DIVISIONS AND TAKE 
INITIATIVES THAT WILL LEAD TO A POLITICAL 
DIALOGUE WITH ISRAEL, THE UNITY OF THE INTIFADA 
COULD BEGIN TO FRAY  ONE CAN IMAGINE A SCENARIO 
IN WHICH PFLP, DFLP, AND COMMUNIST ELEMENTS IN 
THE TERRITORIES, WHO ARE NOW WORKING WITH FATAH, 
COULD REVERT TO MORE EXTREME POSITIONS IN THE 
ABSENCE OF A POLITICAL BREAKTHROUGH.  IN SUCH A 
SITUATION, THE SECULAR-NATIONALIST PRAGMATIC 
CONSENSUS THAT IS THE DOMINANT FEATURE OF THE 
INTIFADA COULD CRUMBLE, AND FUNDAMENTALISM COULD 
MAKE SIGNIFICANT NEW INROADS, ESPECIALLY AMONG 
DISPOSSESSED GROUPS.  THUS, ALTHOUGH A 
MASS-BASED FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENT IS UNLIKELY 
TO EMERGE, THE FUNDAMENTALISTS COULD TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF GROWING DESPAIR AND SECULAR- 
NATIONALIST DISUNITY TO FURTHER ITS POLICIES OF 
CONFRONTATION AND REJECTION. 
 
32.  DESPITE THE AVOWED ANTI-ISRAELI INTENTIONS 
OF HAMAS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MAIN CONTEST 
WILL, FOR THE TIME BEING, BE BETWEEN HAMAS AND 
THE UNLU.  THE MB HAS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON 
ONE MAINSTREAM OPPONENT AT A TIME--THE WAFD IN 
EGYPT, THE BAATH IN SYRIA.  ITS CURRENT OPPONENT 
IN ITS STRUGGLE FOR THE SOULS OF PALESTINIANS IS 
THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE UNLU, FATAH.  UNTIL 
THIS STRUGGLE IS DECIDED, HAMAS IS UNLIKELY TO 
DIRECT ITS EFFORTS PRIMARILY AGAINST ISRAEL. 
 
ISLAMIC JIHAD 
------------- 
 
33.  THIS REPORT HAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON 
HAMAS/MB BOTH BECAUSE HAMAS IS THE MAIN 
FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP ON THE WEST BANK, AND 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE 
OTHER ISLAMIC PARTIES.  ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE ONLY 
OTHER SUCH GROUP WITH A SIGNIFICANT WEST-BANK 
FOLLOWING, WAS ESTABLISHED BY ABU JIHAD TO 
ENHANCE FATAH\'S APPEAL WITH RELIGIOUS MUSLIMS. 
ALTHOUGH IT HAS IN THE PAST CLAIMED INDEPENDENT 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACTS SUCH AS THE OCTOBER 1986 
ATTACK AT THE DUNG GATE, IT WAS DECAPITATED WHEN 
THREE SENIOR LEADERS WERE ASSASSINATED IN 
CYPRUS.  OUR INFORMATION IS THAT ITS CURRENT 
INFLUENCE ON THE WEST BANK IS MINOR AND THAT IT 
IS INCAPABLE OF ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF THE 
MAINSTREAM FATAH ORGANIZATION ON THE WEST BANK. 
IT SEEMS TO BE DOING MOST OF ITS ORGANIZING IN 
WEST BANK PRISONS, WHERE A STRICT QUOTA SYSTEM 
AMONG GROUPS IS ENFORCED BY THE PRISONERS.  WE 
HAVE NO FIRM INFORMATION ON LINKS BETWEEN 
ISLAMIC JIHAD ON THE WEST BANK AND IN GAZA, OR 
WHETHER THE TWO ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN FACT THE 
SAME. 
 
QUESTIONS 
--------- 
 
34.  THIS BRIEF OVERVIEW OF ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY ON THE WEST BANK DOES 
NOT ADDRESS SEVERAL ISSUES OF CONTINUING 
IMPORTANCE, SUCH AS KEY FIGURES IN MB/HAMAS AND 
ISLAMIC JIHAD; COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HAMAS UNITS 
IN VARIOUS REGIONS OF THE WEST BANK, GAZA, 
CAIRO, AND AMMAN; THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
ISLAMIC JIHAD AND HAMAS IN THE WEST BANK AND 
GAZA; AND FATAH-HAMAS RELATIONS.  WE WILL BE 
EXPLORING THESE ISSUES IN FUTURE REPORTING.

SUBJECT: FATAH AND HAMAS CLAIM RECONCILIATION 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT 
 
2.  SUMMARY: FOLLOWING TWO MONTHS OF CLASHES AND 
ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS, HAMAS AND FATAH HAVE ISSUED A 
COMMUNIQUE ANNOUNCING THEIR RECONCILIATION.  THE 
LEAFLET, WHICH CLAIMS TO SPEAK ALSO FOR THE UNLU, CALLS 
FOR CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DIFFERENCES, RESPECT 
FOR MOSQUES AND IMAMS (PRESUMABLY A REFERENCE TO FATAH 
SUPPORTERS HAVING EJECTED SEVERAL IMAMS WHO HAD 
CRITICIZED SADDAM HUSSEIN), AND ALLEGES THAT STARTING 
WITH THEIR MOST RECENT LEAFLETS, UNLU AND HAMAS ARE 
COMMITTED TO \"IMPLEMENTING THE SAME ACTIVITIES.\"  THE 
LEAFLET APPEARS TO GIVE GREATER STATURE TO HAMAS AND A 
DEGREE OF PARITY WITH FATAH (WHICH IT HAS NOT HAD 
BEFORE), AND IT IS WIDELY VIEWED HERE AS REFLECTING 
GAINS MADE BY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS IN THE OCCUPIED 
TERRITORIES FOLLOWING THE BREAKDOWN OF THE PEACE PROCESS 
AND THE ERUPTION OF THE GULF CRISIS.  END SUMMARY 
 
FATAH-HAMAS DIFFERENCES 
----------------------- 
3.  A JOINT FATAH-HAMAS LEAFLET WAS ISSUED SEPTEMBER 19 
IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES ANNOUNCING RECONCILIATION 
BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS.  THE GROWING RIVALRY BETWEEN 
THE TWO GROUPS HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED OVER THE PAST TWO 
MONTHS IN A SERIES OF CLASHES AND ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS: 
 
-- IN JULY, THERE WERE CLASHES BETWEEN PLO AND HAMAS 
SUPPORTERS IN THE VILLAGE OF IDNA, NEAR NABLUS, AND IN 
NABLUS ITSELF, WHILE PLO ACTIVISTS REPORTEDLY STABBED 
TWO HAMAS-AFFILIATED VILLAGE MAYORS NEAR JENIN. 
 
-- IN AUGUST, IN RAMALLAH, HAMAS ISSUED LEAFLETS 
ATTACKING FATAH.  IN ADDITION, LOCAL IMAMS IN BETHLEHEM 
AND QALQILYA WERE REPORTEDLY EJECTED FROM THEIR MOSQUES 
BY FATAH ACTIVISTS AFTER PREACHING AGAINST IRAQ\'S 
INVASION OF KUWAIT. 
 
--  ON SEPTEMBER 9 AND 10, FOLLOWING AN EARLIER INCIDENT 
IN THE VILLAGE OF BAL\'A WHEN FATAH PREVENTED THE LOCAL 
IMAM FROM DELIVERING A SERMON, DOZENS OF MASKED FATAH 
AND HAMAS ACTIVISTS FOUGHT EACH OTHER WITH AXES AND 
SWORDS IN TULKAREM CAMP (WHICH, ACCORDING TO PALESTINIAN 
SOURCES QUOTED IN THE PRESS, HAS A LARGER PROPORTION OF 
HAMAS SUPPORTERS THAN ANY OTHER WEST BANK CAMP).  IN A 
BIZARRE FOLLOW-UP, THE IDF RAIDED THE TULKAREM 
MUNICIPALITY THE FOLLOWING DAY AND TEMPORARILY ARRESTED 
SOME 15 MEMBERS OF A FATAH-HAMAS RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE, WHICH INCLUDED THE TOWN\'S MAYOR, AND EAST 
JERUSALEMITE FEISAL HUSSEINI. 
 
-- IN GAZA\'S JABALYA CAMP, HAMAS ATTACKED SEVERAL 
ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THE PALESTINIAN COMMUNIST PARTY, AND 
ORGANIZED A MARCH IN WHICH THEY CHANTED SLOGANS AGAINST 
THE COMMUNISTS. 
 
-- LONG, MUTUALLY ACCUSATORY LEAFLETS ISSUED BY BOTH 
SIDES DURING THE ABOVE CLASHES HAVE CALLED FOR UNITY, 
ALLEGING THAT THE OTHER SIDE WAS MANUFACTURING INTERNAL 
CONFLICTS WHICH ONLY SERVED THE ENEMY.  FOR ITS PART, 
UNLU ANNOUNCED THAT ANY ATTACK AGAINST A FACTION OF THE 
PLO \"OR A NATIONALIST INDIVIDUAL\" IS AN ATTACK AGAINST 
UNLU ITSELF. 
 
-- ON SEPTEMBER 22, AFTER THE LEAFLET WAS ISSUED, A 
PROMINENT HAMAS SUPPORTER, DR. NIHAD AL-MASRI, WAS 
BEATEN IN HIS NABLUS CLINIC BY MASKED MEN.  NABLUS 
OBSERVED A GENERAL STRIKE CALLED BY HAMAS THE NEXT DAY. 
 
RECONCILIATION? 
--------------- 
 
4.  THE UNNUMBERED SEPTEMBER 19 LEAFLET, ENTITLED 
\"COMMUNIQUE OF PUBLIC OPINION FROM HAMAS AND FATAH,\" 
ALLUDES OBLIQUELY TO THESE INCIDENTS AND OUTLINES A 
PROGRAM OF \"RECONCILIATION\" WHICH STRONGLY FAVORS HAMAS 
POSITIONS AND PROGRAMS.  REFERRING TO \"SOME RECENT 
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENTS,\" THE LEAFLET SAYS THAT 
DIFFERENCES IN OPINION ARE NATURAL AND HEALTHY, AND THAT 
\"A CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND DISTRICT SUB-COMMITTEES\" WILL 
BE FORMED TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS.  ALL PENDING PROBLEMS 
\"SHOULD BE FORGOTTEN,\" AND A NEW PAGE OPENED.  MOSQUES, 
AND THEIR IMAMS AND WORSHIPPERS, SHOULD BE RESPECTED. 
MOREOVER, \"EVERY FACTION HAS THE RIGHT TO CARRY OUT ITS 
ACTIVITIES IN FULL, WITHOUT ANY OBJECTION FROM THE OTHER 
PARTY.\" 
 
5.  THE LEAFLET FURTHER STATES THAT: 
 
--  HAMAS WILL BE EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN ALL PRISON 
COMMITTEES; 
 
--  THE TWO GROUPS \"ARE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENT THE SAME 
ACTIVITIES.  EACH PARTY WILL HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE 
OTHER\'S ACTIVITIES AS IF THEY WERE ITS OWN.\" 
 
-- PERSONS EXPELLED FROM THEIR VILLAGES SHOULD BE 
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES WITHOUT HARRASSMENT. 
 
-- THE SALARIES OF THE EMPLOYEES OF GAZA\'S ISLAMIC 
UNIVERSITY WILL BE PAID IN FULL, WITHOUT 
\"DISCRIMINATION.\" 
 
6.  THE LEAFLET CONCLUDES WITH A PAEON TO \"MUJAHID\" 
UNITY AND PRIDE IN ISLAMIC UNITY.  \"ISLAM RUNS DEEP IN 
OUR VEINS; IT IS OUR CREED AND LIFE.\"  ACCORDING TO 
WEEKEND PRESS REPORTS, AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE LEAFLET 
MENTIONED PALESTINIAN CHRISTIAN AS BEING \"PARTNERS IN 
THE PROCESS OF SELF-DETERMINATION...\" 
 
7.  COMMENT: THE LEAFLET, WHICH APPEARS TO GIVE GREATER 
STATURE TO HAMAS AND A DEGREE OF PARITY WITH FATAH 
(WHICH IT HAS NOT HAD IN THE PAST), IS WIDELY VIEWED 
HERE AS A REFLECTION OF GAINS MADE BY THE ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES VIS-A-VIS 
THE PLO SECULAR NATIONALISTS FOLLOWING THE BREAKDOWN IN 
THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE ERUPTION OF THE GULF CRISIS. 
(PRISON BEATINGS OF HAMAS MEMBERS BY FATAH ADHERENTS 
WERE REPORTEDLY A CHRONIC SOURCE OF FRICTION, FOR 
EXAMPLE.)  A FATAH MEMBER ACTIVE IN THE DISCUSSIONS 
LEADING UP TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE LEAFLET TOLD A LOCAL 
PALESTINIAN JOURNALIST THAT THE DOCUMENT WAS VIRTUALLY 
DICTATED BY HAMAS. 
 
8.  COMMENT (CONT\'D): NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE HEARD FROM 
SEVERAL SOURCES THAT THIS \"RECONCILIATION\" CAN BE 
EXPECTED TO BE SHORT-LIVED.  (ALREADY, THE FATAH YOUTH 
GROUP SHABIBA HAS ISSUED A LEAFLET IN THE VILLAGE OF 
BAL\'A DISMISSING THE \"RECONCILIATION\" AND CLAIMING THAT 
HAMAS HARRASSMENT OF FATAH LOYALISTS CONTINUES.)  WITH 
FATAH (AND UNLU) WEAKENED AND DIVIDED, HAMAS IS MAKING 
THE MOST OF POPULAR RESENTMENT AGAINST THE U.S. MILITARY 
PRESENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA (AND ALLEGED \"DESECRATION OF 
MUSLIM HOLY PLACES\") AND ARAFAT\'S FAILURE TO GAIN FROM 
HIS 1988 \"CONCESSIONS\" ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  ONE 
JOURNALIST TOLD US, \"THE NEW GAME IN TOWN IS 
HAMAS-FATAH, NOT ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN.\"  WE ARE ALSO 
HEARING RUMORS THAT THE SAUDIS AND SOME OTHER GULF 
STATES ARE TAKING REVENGE ON FATAH BY INCREASING FUNDING 
TO HAMAS TO THE TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE PLO.

SUBJECT: ARAFAT ORDERS ARREST OF ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS 
 
1.  (C - ENTIRE TEXT.) 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  NABIL SHA\'ATH INFORMED CONSUL GENERAL LATE 
JANUARY 24 THAT FOUR PRINCIPAL ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS IN 
GAZA HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE PPF.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT 
ARAFAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONCRETE 
STEPS AGAINST ISLAMIC RADICALS.  ARAFAT REPORTEDLY 
UNDERSTOOD THE TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON RABIN FOLLOWING 
THE BEIT LID BOMBING.  SHA\'ATH COMMENTED THAT RABIN 
NEEDS USG SUPPORT VIS-A-VIS HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  FOLLOWING NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS BY CONSUL GENERAL 
WITH PA OFFICIALS JANUARY 24 URGING A FIRM PA RESPONSE 
TO THE BEIT LID BOMBING, NABIL SHA\'ATH CALLED CONSUL 
GENERAL TUESDAY EVENING TO INFORM HIM THAT AT ARAFAT\'S 
ORDERS, FOUR PRINCIPAL ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADERS IN GAZA HAD 
BEEN ARRESTED.  THE FOUR ARE ABDALLAH AL SHAMI, ABDALLAH 
SULIEMAN AL ZUQ, MOHAMMAD ABDALLAH SHALLAH AND OMAR 
MOHAMMAD FURAH.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT SEVERAL GUARDS OF 
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD ALSO BEEN ARRESTED.  CONSUL 
GENERAL SAID THAT THIS WAS A GOOD MOVE BUT FOLLOW 
THROUGH WAS VERY IMPORTANT.  IF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE 
HELD FOR A FEW DAYS AND RELEASED, THE ACTION WOULD BE 
MEANINGLESS.  SHA\'ATH SAID HE UNDERSTOOD.  HE SAID THAT 
ARAFAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONCRETE 
MEASURES. 
 
4.  REFERRING TO RABIN\'S ADDRESS TO THE ISRAELI NATION 
JANUARY 23, SHA\'ATH SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT RABIN HAD 
BEEN VERY STATESMANLIKE IN HIS DETERMINATION TO PROCEED 
WITH THE PEACE PROCESS.  HE SAID THAT HE, ARAFAT AND 
OTHER PALESTINIAN LEADERS UNDERSTOOD THE TREMENDOUS 
PRESSURE THAT RABIN WAS UNDER BECAUSE OF THE BEIT LID 
BOMBING.  AS FOR A STRONG STATEMENT BY ARAFAT CONDEMNING 
THE BOMBING, SHA\'ATH SAID THAT ARAFAT HAD MADE TWO 
SPEECHES IN GAZA JANUARY 24 ATTACKING THE ISLAMISTS FOR 
ACTIONS TAKEN WHICH DAMAGED PALESTINIAN INTERESTS. 
SHA\'ATH SAID THAT THIS WAS THE STRONGEST ATTACK EVER 
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC MILITANTS.  HE REPEATED THAT THERE 
WAS MUCH MORE RESOLVE ON ARAFAT\'S PART TO CONFRONT THE 
MILITANTS. 
 
5.  SHA\'ATH EXPRESSED ANXIETY ABOUT RABIN\'S DOMESTIC 
POSITION AND SAID THAT RABIN NEEDS USG SUPPORT VIS-A-VIS 
HIS DOMESTIC OPPONENTS.  HE ALSO RAISED THE CLOSURE OF 
GAZA AND JERICHO, ASKING FOR U.S. INTERCESSION WITH 
RABIN TO ADVISE HIM AGAINST AN EXTENDED CLOSURE AS 
OCCURRED AFTER THE TEL AVIV BOMBING.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT 
THE MOOD IN GAZA IS CURRENTLY VERY MUCH AGAINST ISLAMIC 
JIHAD.  HE SAID THAT EVEN HAMAS IS TRYING TO DISTANCE 
ITSELF FROM THE IJ.  HOWEVER, THE LONGER THE CLOSURES 
LAST THE MORE THE AVERAGE PALESTINIAN WILL BLAME THE PA 
FOR THEIR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES. 
 
6.  SHA\'ATH SAID THAT WHEN THE CLOSURE HAD BEEN 
INITIALLY IMPOSED, LOCAL IDF UNITS WERE PREVENTING ALL 
TRAFFIC TO AND FROM GAZA INCLUDING BANNING OF FOOD AND 
OTHER SUPPLIES FROM REACHING GAZA AND CUTTING OFF THE 
EXPORT OF FLOWERS AND STRAWBERRIES FROM GAZA.  SHA\'ATH 
SAID HE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO DANNY ROTHSCHILD IN A 
MEETING AT EREZ JANUARY 24 AND ROTHSCHILD HAD 
STRAIGHTENED OUT THE PROBLEM OF THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS TO 
AND FROM GAZA.  ROTHSCHILD ALSO TOLD SHA\'ATH THAT THE 
CLOSURE WOULD LAST NO LONGER THAN THE END OF THE WEEK. 
SHA\'ATH SAID HE HOPES THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. 
7.  NABIL ABU RUDEINA ALSO CONFIRMED TO CONSUL GENERAL 
THAT ARAFAT ORDERED THE ARREST OF THE FOUR ISLAMIC JIHAD 
LEADERS.  ABU RUDEINA SAID THAT ARAFAT PLANS TO LEAVE 
LATER TODAY FOR HIS MEETING IN AMMAN WITH KING HUSSEIN.

2.  SUMMARY.  A WANTED HAMAS IZZ ED-DIN AL-QASSAM 
CELL MEMBER, TAHIR QAFISHA, WAS AMBUSHED AND SHOT 
DEAD BY AN UNDERCOVER UNIT OF THE ISRAELI BORDER 
POLICE JUNE 29 AT THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO HEBRON. 
TWO HOMES IN WHICH QAFISHA ALLEGEDLY HID WERE 
DEMOLISHED, AS WELL AS A STABLE AND MORE THAN 100 
TREES IN THE AREA (REFTEL A).  ISRAELI MILITARY 
SOURCES SAID QAFISHA WAS THE LAST KNOWN MEMBER OF A 
HEBRON IZZ ED-DIN AL-QASSAM CELL ALLEGEDLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF AT LEAST SIX ISRAELIS 
IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS OVER THE PAST YEAR.  THE 
DEMOLITIONS HAVE ANGERED HEBRONITES, WHO REMAIN 
UNDER CURFEW AS A RESULT OF THE OPERATION.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
3.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, AN UNDERCOVER UNIT 
OF THE ISRAELI BORDER POLICE ACTING ON INTELLIGENCE 
INFORMATION SURROUNDED A HOUSE AT THE NORTHERN 
ENTRANCE OF HEBRON AT 3:30 AM JUNE 29 IN WHICH 
WANTED HAMAS ACTIVIST TAHIR QAFISHA WAS REPORTEDLY 
HIDING.  HEBRONITES SAID AN ISRAELI HELICOPTER 
HOVERED OVER THE AREA SHINING A SEARCH LIGHT AS THE 
OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED.  IDF SOURCES SAID QAFISHA 
REFUSED TO SURRENDER.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHO FIRED 
FIRST, BUT SHOOTING BROKE OUT BETWEEN THE SOLDIERS 
AND QAFISHA, WHO SERIOUSLY WOUNDED A SOLDIER IN THE 
HEAD BEFORE HE WAS SHOT DEAD AS HE TRIED TO BREAK 
THROUGH THE CORDON OF SOLDIERS SURROUNDING HIM. 
 
4.  ALTHOUGH THE OPERATION WAS OVER BY 5:30 AM, 
ACCORDING TO UNRWA SOURCES, THE SOLDIERS CONTINUED 
TO SWEEP THE AREA FOR ADDITIONAL SUSPECTS MANY 
HOURS AFTER.  PRESS FOOTAGE SHOWED SOLDIERS COMBING 
ORCHARDS AND BEATING AN UNARMED MAN AS THEY TOOK 
HIM AWAY FOR QUESTIONING.  THE TWO HOUSES IN WHICH 
QAFISHA REPORTEDLY HID--OWNED BY THE FAMILIES OF 
UTHMAN AL-FALAH AND MUHAMMAD DANHASH--WERE HIT WITH 
MISSILES AND THEN BULLDOZED.  THE FAMILY MEMBERS 
WERE REPORTEDLY EVICTED WEARING ONLY THEIR NIGHT 
CLOTHES AND WERE FORBIDDEN TO TAKE ANYTHING WITH 
THEM.  A STABLE FILLED WITH SHEEP BELONGING TO THE 
DANHASH FAMILY WAS ALSO HIT WITH MISSILES AND THEN 
BULLDOZED, AND A NEARBY GROVE OF ABOUT 100 GRAPE 
VINES WERE PLOWED UNDER. 
 
5.  ACCORDING TO PRESS, THE HEBRON AREA COMMANDER 
SAID DESTROYING THE HOMES AND TREES WAS STANDARD 
PRACTICE BECAUSE THE TROOPS SUSPECTED MORE GUNMEN 
COULD BE HIDING THERE.  THE FALAH AND DANHASH 
FAMILIES REJECTED THAT, SAYING THEIR HOMES WERE NOT 
HIT WITH MISSILES UNTIL QAFISHA WAS CONFIRMED TO BE 
DEAD AND HIS BODY WAS TAKEN AWAY.  THEY TOLD ARAB 
JOURNALISTS THAT QAFISHA WAS NEVER IN THEIR HOMES 
BUT WAS INSTEAD SLEEPING IN THE VINEYARD. 
ACCORDING TO UNRWA SOURCES JUNE 30, HEBRON IS STILL 
CLOSED AND UNDER CURFEW. 
 
6.  IDF SOURCES TOLD THE PRESS THAT QAFISHA WAS THE 
LAST KNOWN REMAINING MEMBER OF A HEBRON MAMAS CELL 
THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT 
LEAST SIX ISRAELIS IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS IN HEBRON 
OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WELL AS THE WOUNDING OF 
SEVERAL SOLDIERS IN SHOOTING ATTACKS ON VEHICLES 
AND THE ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING OF A SETTLER.  THE 
FOUR OTHER KNOWN CELL MEMBERS WERE TRACKED DOWN AND 
KILLED IN TWO SEPARATE OPERATIONS BY UNDERCOVER 
ISRAELI SECURITY UNITS OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS 
(REFTELS B, C AND D).  ACCORDING TO PRESS, MILITARY 
SOURCES ESTIMATE TWO OTHER MAMAS CELLS WITH A TOTAL 
OF FIVE MEMBERS ARE STILL AT LARGE IN HEBRON. 
 
7.  COMMENT.  THE IDF OPERATION, ESPECIALLY THE 
DEMOLITION OF TWO HOMES, HAS CREATED ANGER IN 
HEBRON WHERE THE POPULATION IS ALREADY CRITICAL OF 
THE PEACE PROCESS AND SEES LITTLE CHANCE FOR ANY 
IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR SITUATION IN THE NEAR TERM. 
ALTHOUGH UNDERCOVER KILLINGS OF THE OTHER MEMBERS 
OF THIS CELL DID NOT PROVOKE A RETALIATORY ATTACK 
BY MAMAS MEMBERS--PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF HEAVY 
PRESSURE FROM THE PA TO STOP ATTACKS AND PUBLIC 
AVERSION TO SUCH ATTACKS--ONE CAN NOT RULE OUT A 
RETALIATORY ATTACK AGAINST ISRAELIS AT THIS 
CRITICAL TIME, ON THE EVE OF WHAT MANY PALESTINIANS 
CONSIDER TO BE A DEADLINE, NOT A TARGET DATE, FOR A 
REDEPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. 
 
8.  COMMENT CONTINUED.  ALTHOUGH THE IDF CLAIMED 
THAT QAFISHA REFUSED TO SURRENDER--AND HE HAS 
CLEARLY ARMED AND APPARENTLY SHOT A 
SOLDIER--ISRAELI UNDERCOVER UNITS ON OPERATIONS TO 
FIND WANTED MEN HAVE GENERALLY MADE LITTLE ATTEMPT 
TO ARREST OR BRING TO TRIAL THEIR TARGETS.  THE 
FOUR OTHER ALLEGED MEMBERS OF THIS MAMAS CELL, FOR 
EXAMPLE, WERE ALL KILLED ON SITE EVEN THOUGH SOME 
WERE UNARMED.

2.  SUMMARY.  PALESTINIANS HAVE REACTED WITH SHOCK TO 
THE NOVEMBER 4 ASSASSINATION OF ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER 
YITZHAK RABIN, FOLLOWED BY ANXIETY ABOUT WHAT HIS DEATH 
MEANS TO THE PEACE PROCESS AND THEIR FUTURE.  WEST BANK 
AND GAZA ARE UNDER CLOSURE FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD, AND 
TOWNS WERE QUIET.  YASIR ARAFAT AND OTHER PA OFFICIALS 
HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SHOCK AND SADNESS REGARDING RABIN\'S 
DEATH, AND VOW THAT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL NOT BE 
DISRUPTED AS A RESULT.  MAMAS AND PIJ \"CELEBRATIONS\" 
HAVE BEEN FIRMLY PROHIBITED; PALESTINIAN SECURITY CHIEFS 
DO NOT EXPECT THAT ISLAMISTS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
CRISIS TO CARRY OUT OPERATIONS.  PPF DEPLOYMENT INTO 
JENIN HAS BEEN DELAYED, PROBABLY ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
 
WEST BANK/GAZA QUIET AS PALESTINIANS ABSORB THE NEWS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
3.  THE WEST BANK AND GAZA WAS ABNORMALLY QUIET THE DAY 
AFTER RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION, WITH MOST PALESTINIANS 
APPEARING TO BE IN SHOCK ABOUT THE NEWS OF HIS MURDER 
AND ANXIOUS ABOUT THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE PEACE 
PROCESS AND THEIR FUTURE.  THE GOI IMPOSED A COMPLETE 
CLOSURE ON THE TERRITORIES--FOR AN INDEFINITE 
PERIOD--THAT ENSURED THAT MANY PALESTINIANS REMAINED IN 
THEIR HOMES, GLUED TO THEIR TELEVISIONS AND RADIOS 
LISTENING TO NEWS REPORTS.  MANY WERE UP LATE THE NIGHT 
OF THE KILLING, UNABLE TO SLEEP, AND THOSE AT BUSINESSES 
AND COFFEE SHOPS NOVEMBER 5 SPENT THE DAY DISCUSSING THE 
EVENT AND ITS EXPECTED IMPACT. 
 
4.  GAZA CIVIL POLICE CHIEF GHAZI JABALI SAID PA POLICE 
WERE NOT ALLOWING PALESTINIANS TO EXPRESS JOY AT THE 
KILLING OF RABIN, BUT ADDED THAT SO FAR NO CELEBRATIONS 
BROKE OUT, AND ONE THAT THREATENED TO OCCUR AT KHAN 
YUNIS WAS SQUASHED BY PA POLICE.  ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM 
ARAFAT, JERICHO PREVENTIVE SECURITY CHIEF JIBRIL RAJOUB 
MET WITH WEST BANK MAMAS LEADERS IN THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS OF NOVEMBER 5 TO CONVEY ARAFAT\'S WARNING THAT 
THERE WERE TO BE NO DISRESPECTFUL DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE 
STREETS.  RAJOUB SAID THAT MAMAS WAS TO CONVEY THE SAME 
MESSAGE TO THE PIJ.  BOTH RAJOUB AND WEST BANK PPF 
COMMANDER HAJ ISMAIL JABBER BELIEVED THE WEST BANK WOULD 
REMAIN QUIET, BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR INSTABILITY DEPENDED 
ON DEVELOPMENTS IN ISRAEL IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. 
 
5.  BETHLEHEM MAYOR ILYAS FREIJ WAS \"TERRIBLY UPSET,\" 
SAYING HE KNEW RABIN AS A FRIEND.  HE COMMENTED ON WHAT 
COULD BE A \"DISTURBING PHENOMENA IF EVERY LEADER WHO 
TRIES TO MAKE PEACE IN THE REGION IS THREATENED WITH 
GUNS.\"  JENIN MAYOR WALID ABU MUWAYZ SAID JENIN 
RESIDENTS ARE SADDENED BY THE KILLING AND HOPE IT WILL 
NOT AFFECT THE SCHEDULE FOR REDEPLOYMENT IN THEIR TOWN. 
NABLUS MAYOR GHASSAN SHAKA SAID IT WAS A SAD DAY FOR 
NABLUS, AND HE HOPES RABIN\'S DEATH WILL NOT HAVE A 
CATASTROPHIC EFFECT ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  FATAH 
SUPPORTER AZZAM AL-ARAJ IN TULKAREM SAID THE PEOPLE 
THERE ARE SHOCKED AND SADDENED, EVEN THE YOUNG ACTIVISTS 
AT AN-NAJAH UNIVERSITY WHERE HE TEACHES. 
 
 
ARAFAT, PA OFFICIALS SHAKEN, SADDENED BY THE NEWS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
6.  PA OFFICIALS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED THEIR SADNESS AND 
SHOCK TOWARDS THE ATTACK AND SENT CONDOLENCES TO THE 
ISRAELI PEOPLE, AND FLAGS AT PA BUILDINGS WERE AT HALF 
MAST.  YASIR ARAFAT, LOOKING VISIBLY SHAKEN AND SPEAKING 
HALTINGLY AND QUIETLY, SAID PUBLICLY NOVEMBER 4 THAT HE 
WAS \"VERY SAD AND VERY SHOCKED BY THIS TERRIBLE CRIME, 
AGAINST A GREAT ISRAELI LEADER AND AN ARCHITECT OF 
PEACE.  IN THE NAME OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE, I SEND MY 
CONDOLENCES TO MRS. RABIN, HER FAMILY, THE ISRAELI 
GOVERNMENT AND THE ENTIRE ISRAELI PEOPLE.  I HOPE WE 
WILL SUCCEED IN OVERCOMING THIS TRAGEDY, WHICH IS A BLOW 
TO THE PEACE PROCESS.\"  ARAFAT\'S JERICHO OFFICE DIRECTOR 
SAMI MUSALLAM SAID ARAFAT WAS VERY UPSET BY THE 
ASSASSINATION, AND HAD NOT SEEN HIM IN SUCH A STATE 
SINCE THE ASSASSINATIONS OF ABU JIHAD AND ABU IYAD. 
OTHER PA OFFICIALS, INCLUDING MILITARY LEADERS, WERE 
ALSO UPSET, SAYING THE REGION HAD LOST A GREAT MAN OF 
PEACE AND CALLING THE KILLING A DISASTER AND A 
CATASTROPHE.  MANY OF THE PALESTINIAN POLITICAL, 
SECURITY, AND ECONOMIC FIGURES VOICED A SENSE OF RELIEF 
THAT THE ASSASSIN WAS NOT PALESTINIAN. 
 
 
WORRIES ABOUT THE FUTURE, IMPACT ON THE PEACE PROCESS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
7.  ALL PALESTINIANS EXPRESSED ANXIETY ABOUT THE EFFECT 
OF THE KILLING ON THE PEACE PROCESS.  PA MINISTER OF 
LOCAL AFFAIRS SA\'EB ERAKAT SAID \"WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT, 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS COULD AFFECT IMPLEMENTATION.\"  HE 
EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE PHENOMENON OF THE ISRAELI 
RIGHT WING\'S VIOLENCE IN OPPOSING THE PEACE PROCESS AND 
WONDERED HOW THAT WILL EFFECT CO-EXISTENCE BETWEEN THE 
TWO PEOPLES AND WHAT SUCH EXTREMISTS HAVE IN STORE FOR 
PALESTINIANS DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERIM 
AGREEMENT AND ELECTIONS.  HE SAID PALESTINIANS CONTINUE 
TO MOVE FORWARD ON PREPARATIONS FOR PALESTINIAN 
ELECTIONS.  (NOTE:  THE PA CABINET YESTERDAY CONFIRMED 
THE JANUARY 20 ELECTION DATE.) 
 
8.  HEBRON UNIVERSITY PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR NABIL 
ABU ZNEID EXPRESSED THE CONCERN OF MANY PALESTINIANS 
WHEN HE SAID THE VOID LEFT BY RABIN MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO 
FILL.  HE FELT THE CURRENT PEACE PROCESS WAS LESS A 
PEACE BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS BUT MORE A PEACE 
BETWEEN ARAFAT AND RABIN.  OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO HAD GRADUALLY GROWN 
STRONGER AND MORE TRUSTING, AND THE TWO HAVE MADE BRAVE 
DECISIONS FOR PEACE.  HE SAID \"WE\'VE LOST A GREAT MAN,\" 
AND LAMENTED THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ISRAELI LEADER AT 
THIS TIME WITH RABIN\'S PRO-PEACE ATTITUDE COUPLED WITH 
MILITARY EXPERTISE AND KNOW-HOW. 
 
9.  WEST BANK FATAH AND BUSINESS LEADERS WERE ALSO 
SHOCKED AND PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE WITHOUT RABIN. 
HIGHER COUNCIL MEMBER AHMAD AD-DEEK AND RAMALLAH LEADER 
HUSSEIN ASH-SHEIKH ARE AFRAID HIS DEATH MARKS THE END OF 
THE PEACE PROCESS.  THEY FEAR THE PROCESS WILL BE 
SUSPENDED UNTIL THE NEXT ISRAELI ELECTION.  PADICO 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AMIN HADDAD SAID \"WE ALL BELIEVE THIS 
IS A HUGE LOSS TO THE PEACE PROCESS; NO PALESTINIAN WHO 
IS THOUGHTFUL IS REJOICING.\"  CAIRO AMMAN BANK REGIONAL 
MANAGER YUSUF BAZIAN SAID \"ISRAELIS MAY HESITATE EVEN 
MORE ABOUT TAKING DIFFICULT STEPS THAT THEY MUST TAKE; 
MOREOVER, THEY MAY WONDER IF PEACE IS WORTH THE PRICE.\" 
 
10.  MANY PALESTINIANS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE INTERNAL 
SITUATION INSIDE ISRAEL, AND WERE INCREDULOUS THAT THE 
KILLING HAS PERPETRATED BY AN ISRAELI.  HADDAD SAID THE 
ASSASSINATION INDICATES THAT \"ISRAEL HAS TRULY JOINED 
THE MIDDLE EAST.\"  ANIS AL-QAQ, DEPUTY MINISTER IN THE 
MINISTRY OF PLANNING, WONDERED IF ISRAEL WOULD COME 
TOGETHER OR FRACTURE FURTHER OVER THE LOSS OF RABIN. 
\"MANY OF US WHO KNOW ISRAEL BELIEVE THE PRIDE OF ISRAELI 
DEMOCRACY AND SENSE OF MORAL CERTAINTY WAS ALSO SHOT 
YESTERDAY.\" 
 
11.  MANY FEAR PERES IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD ISRAEL 
OR THE PEACE PROCESS TOGETHER.  SAMI MUSALLAM, DIRECTOR 
OF ARAFAT\'S OFFICE IN JERICHO, SAID THAT ALTHOUGH PERES 
ENJOYS SUPPORT AMONG YOUNGER IDF OFFICERS, HE DOES NOT 
HAVE CLOSE RELATIONS WITH ANY OF THE CURRENT CLASS OF 
REGIONAL AND FORCE COMMANDERS.  THE PALESTINIANS ARE 
EXTREMELY WORRIED THAT PERES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRING 
THE MILITARY TO HEEL DURING REDEPLOYMENT, IN THE WAY 
RABIN HAD DONE.  THEY ARE WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE WHO 
WILL BE NAMED MINISTER OF DEFENSE IN ROBIN\'S STEAD. 
MUSALLAM SAID THAT AMNON SHAHAK WOULD BE FAR PREFERABLE 
TO EHUD BARAK, IN TERMS OF EACH MAN\'S SUPPORT FOR THE 
PEACE PROCESS.  PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR HASSAN ASFOUR, 
HOWEVER, SAID THAT DURING THE NOVEMBER 4 PA CABINET 
MEETING, THE CABINET WISHED FOR AN ISRAELI LEADERSHIP 
\"DREAM TEAM\" MADE UP OF PERES AS PRIME MINISTER, EHUD 
BARAK AS DEFENSE MINISTER, AND HAIM RAMON AS FOREIGN 
MINISTER.  MANY PALESTINIANS FEAR THAT NETANYAHU WILL 
HAVE AN EASY TIME DEFEATING PERES IN FUTURE ELECTIONS. 
 
 
PALESTINIANS HOPE GOI WILL COCK DOWN ON ITS EXTREMISTS 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
12.  A COMMON REACTION AMONG PALESTINIANS WAS THAT 
RABIN\'S MURDER WOULD HURT THE FAR-RIGHT OPPONENTS OF 
PEACE.  PALESTINE BUSINESSMEN\'S ASSOCIATION LEADER HANI 
ABU DAYYEH SAID THE KILLING WOULD DISCREDIT THE 
FAR-RIGHT AND GIVE THE GOI THE CHANCE TO ACT AGAINST 
ISRAELI EXTREMISTS THAT \"HAS MISSED AFTER THE HEBRON 
MASSACRE.\"   AL-QAQ COMMENTED THAT \"ISRAEL HAS 
OVERLOOKED A TREND TOWARD VIOLENT FORCES ALLOWED TO 
OPERATE WITHIN ITS SOCIETY--THIS CAN NO LONGER BE 
IGNORED.  THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL PRICE ISRAEL CAN PAY 
FOR ALLOWING PARTS OF THE SOCIETY TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE 
ABOVE THE LAW.\" 
 
13.  PPF POLICE CHIEF NASIR YUSIF SAID THE ASSASSINATION 
HAS A \"CATASTROPHE\" THAT WILL \"NO DOUBT IMPOSE ON ALL 
THE NEED TO CONFRONT WITH ALL FIRMNESS EXTREMISM IN THE 
REGION.\"  GAZA PREVENTIVE SECURITY CHIEF MUHAMMAD DAHLAN 
SAID IT \"SHOULD BE A LESSON FOR THE ISRAELIS TO SEE THE 
DANGER IN THEIR OWN EXTREMISTS.\"  FORMER PEACE TERMER 
NABIL KASSIS SAID IN ORDER TO LESSEN THE INFLUENCE OF 
THE EXTREMISTS, THE GOI IN GENERAL MUST WORK HARDER TO 
EDUCATE ITS PEOPLE ABOUT PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE WITH 
PALESTINIANS OTHER THAN VIEWING THEM ONLY AS A SECURITY 
THREAT.  WHILE BETHLEHEM MAYOR FREIJ HOPES THE 
ASSASSINATION WILL UNDERCUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
ISRAELI EXTREMISTS, HE WORRIES THAT IT MAY INSTEAD MAKE 
THEM MORE AGGRESSIVE. 
 

MAMAS, PIJ RELATIVELY QUIET, FOR NOW 
------------------------------------ 
 
14.  MAMAS AND PIJ SUPPORTERS WERE GENERALLY QUIET, WITH 
PA SECURITY OFFICERS AND FATAH MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE 
WEST BANK AND GAZA ENSURING THAT CELEBRATIONS WOULD NOT 
OCCUR.  TEL AVIV POLOFF SAW NO INDICATION OF EXTREMIST 
CELEBRATIONS IN GAZA.  SALAH SAKKA, A GAZA CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBER, SAID THAT THE MOOD LAST NIGHT IN KHAN YUNIS 
AMONG ISLAMISTS HAS HAPPY, BUT THERE WERE NO PUBLIC 
RALLIES, JUST BULLETS SHOT INTO THE AIR.  PA POLICE 
PRESENCE IN KHAN YUNIS HAS VERY HIGH.  PLO CHAIRMAN 
ARAFAT TOLD THE CG THAT STRICT ORDERS HAD GONE OUT TO 
PREVENT CELEBRATIONS, INCLUDING FIRING IN THE AIR. 
 
15.  IN HEBRON, SOME ISLAMIC SUPPORTERS FELT RABIN\'S 
KILLING HAS AN EVENT WORTH CELEBRATING--SEEING IT AS AN 
END TO THE PEACE PROCESS--BUT DID NOT YET ACT ON THAT 
IMPULSE.  HEBRON LEADERS SAID THE CITY WAS COWLING WITH 
IDF SOLDIERS.  PALESTINIAN EXTREMISTS WERE ALSO HOPING 
RABIN\'S MURDER WILL LEAD TO MORE DIVISIONS IN ISRAELI 
SOCIETY.  HAMAS FOLLOWERS IN TULKAREM REPORTEDLY 
CONSIDERED THE ASSASSINATION THE \"ACT OF A COWARD.\" 
KHALIL SHIQAQI, RESEARCH DIRECTOR AT THE CENTER FOR 
PALESTINE RESEARCH AND STUDIES IN NABLUS AND BROTHER OF 
RECENTLY ASSASSINATED PALESTINE ISLAMIC JIHAD LEADER 
FATHI SHIQAQI, SAID THAT SOME OF THE RADICAL PALESTINIAN 
FACTIONS ARE SAYING THAT RABIN\'S ASSASSINATION WAS \"AN 
ACT OF GOD,\" IMPLYING THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO AVENGE 
SHIQAQI\'S DEATH. 
 
 
DELAYS EXPECTED, BUT PEACE PROCESS MUST CONTINUE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
16.  MANY PALESTINIANS UNDERSTAND SOME DELAYS ARE TO BE 
EXPECTED IN THE PEACE PROCESS AS A RESULT OF ROBIN\'S 
DEATH, BUT HOPE PRESIDENT CLINTON AND OTHER LEADERS WILL 
STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAVELY GOING FORWARD AT 
RABIN\'S FUNERAL.  CAB REGIONAL MANAGER BAZIAN SAID 
PALESTINIANS MUST BE SMART AND \"UNDERSTAND THE THE 
ISRAELIS WILL NEED TIME TO SORT THIS OUT.  WE SHOULD 
GIVE THEM THIS TIME, BUT INSIST ON OUR RIGHTS UNDER THE 
AGREEMENT.\"  WEST BANK PPF COMMANDER HAJJ ISMAIL 
REPORTED THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH IDF CENTRAL COMMAND MG 
ILAN BIRAN EARLIER IN THE DAY NOVEMBER 5 TO CONVEY HIS 
CONDOLENCES AND DISCUSS THE EFFECT OF THE ASSASSINATION 
ON PLANS FOR REDEPLOYMENT.  ANOTHER PPF CONTINGENT HAD 
BEEN SCHEDULED TO DEPART JERICHO FOR JENIN NOVEMBER 5; 
HAJ ISMAIL AGREED TO BIRAN\'S REQUEST THAT ANY MOVEMENT 
ON REDEPLOYMENT BE POSTPONED FOR \"A FEW DAYS.\"  HAJ 
ISMAIL DID NOT EXPECT THAT THE REDEPLOYMENT/DEPLOYMENT 
SCHEDULE WOULD BE UNDULY DELAYED BUT ECHOES MUSALLEM\'S 
CONCERN THAT PERES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THE IDF KEEP 
ITS REDEPLOYMENT COMMITTMENTS.

1.5 (B) AND (D). 
 
2.  (C) BIR ZEIT UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR HISHAM 
AHMAD TOLD POLOFF THAT HAMAS IS LAYING LOW FOLLOWING CRACKDOWNS BY 
THE PA AND ISRAELI SECURITY AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS EARLIER THIS 
YEAR.  IN HIS VIEW, HAMAS IS CURRENTLY BIDING ITS TIME AND WAITING 
FOR THE STREET TO BECOME FRUSTATED ENOUGH WITH THE CLOSURE AND LACK 
OF PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS TO, IF NOT WELCOME A RESUMPTION OF 
TERRORIST ATTACKS, AT LEAST \"SYMPATHIZE\" WITH THEM.  AHMAD BELIEVES 
A \"HARDCORE\" OF HAMAS OPERATIVES AND PLANNERS REMAIN TO GUIDE 
TERRORIST ATTACKS.  THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO RECRUIT MEMBERS, 
DESPITE DAMAGE DONE TO ITS INFRASTRUCTURE DURING EARLIER 
CRACKDOWNS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
---------------------------- 
HAMAS LAYING LOW FOR NOW.... 
---------------------------- 
3.  (C) POLOFF MET WITH DR. HISHAM AHMAD, AN AMCIT BIR ZEIT 
POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR, TO DISCUSS WEST BANK POLITICAL 
OPPOSITION GROUPS.  (NOTE: AHMAD IS THE AUTHOR OF THE 1994 PASSIA 
STUDY ON HAMAS ENTITLED \"HAMAS: FROM RELIGIOUS SALVATION TO 
POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION: THE RISE OF HAMAS IN PALESTINIAN 
SOCIETY\").  AHMAD TOLD POLOFF THAT HAMAS\' LACK OF ACTIVISM DURING 
THE LATE SEPTEMBER ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CLASHES INDICATED ITS 
CURRENT STRATEGY OF LAYING LOW AND WAITING FOR POPULAR FRUSTRATION 
TO BUILD AS A NATURAL OUTGROWTH OF EVENTS ON THE GROUND.  HE SAID 
THAT HAMAS IS CONDUCTING ITS ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS RECRUITING AND 
MOBILIZING MEMBERS AND RUNNING ITS SOCIAL-WELFARE ORGANIZATIONS IN 
THE WEST BANK, IN A MORE LOW-KEY FASHION.  THIS IS A RESULT OF THE 
PA AND ISRAELI CRACKDOWNS ON ITS ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING SUICIDE 
BOMB ATTACKS EARLIER THIS YEAR AS WELL AS TO AVOID HARASSMENT FROM 
THE PA.  AHMAD OPINED THAT HAMAS CURRENTLY SEES NO NEED TO WHIP UP 
THE STREET BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY FRUSTRATED AND ON EDGE.  (COMMENT: 
THIS IS A TIME-HONORED TACTIC THAT HAMAS USES - TO LET THE PLO OR 
ISRAEL MAKE MISSTEPS OR CREATE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND THAT 
FACILITATE HAMAS\'S GOAL OF DISCREDITING THE PA AND THE PEACE 
PROCESS.  END COMMENT). 
 
------------------------------------------- 
...BUT STILL A LURKING THREAT OF TERRORISM 
------------------------------------------- 
4.  (C) AHMAD SAID THAT HE IS CONCERNED THAT HAMAS\'S RELATIVE QUIET 
IS ONLY TEMPORARY AND THAT IT WILL RESUME ATTACKS AS POPULAR 
FRUSTRATION OVER LACK OF MOVEMENT IN THE PEACE PROCESS AND THE 
NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT\'S POLICIES CONTINUE TO BUILD.  HE SAID THAT 
HAMAS TERRORIST OPERATIVES LEARNED THEIR LESSON FROM THE 
PALESTINIAN PUBLIC\'S CONDEMNATION OF ITS TERRORIST ATTACKS IN 1995 
AND EARLY 1996 AND THE RESULTING HARDSHIP VISITED UPON THE 
PALESTINIANS THROUGH TIGHTENED ECONOMIC CLOSURES; THEIR OBJECTIVE 
NOW IS TO RESUME TERRORIST ATTACKS WHEN POPULAR FRUSTRATION BECOMES 
GREAT ENOUGH SO THAT THE PUBLIC WILL NOT CONDEMN SUCH A RESUMPTION. 
HE SAID THERE IS A \"HARDCORE\" OF HAMAS TERRORIST PLANNERS AND 
OPERATIVES IN PLACE.  (NOTE: LIKE OTHER CONGEN CONTACTS, AHMAD 
COULD NOT QUANTIFY OR SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY THIS \"CRITICAL MASS\" OF 
PUBLIC DISCONTENT). 
 
------------------------------------------ 
EFFECTS OF CLOSURE AND CRACKDOWNS ON HAMAS 
------------------------------------------ 
5.  (C) IN RESPONSE TO POLOFF\'S QUESTIONS, AHMAD SAID THAT HAMAS IS 
CONTINUING TO RECRUIT MEMBERS, ALTHOUGH THE CRACKDOWNS IN MARCH 
WEAKENED ITS INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOME HAMAS MEMBERS CRITICIZED THE 
ORGANIZATION\'S RELATIVELY LACKLUSTER PERFORMANCE DURING THE 
SEPTEMBER CLASHES.  IN RESPONSE TO POLOFF\'S QUESTION, AHMAD SAID 
THAT THE CLOSURE IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD FOR HAMAS: IT MAKES IT 
MORE DIFFICULT FOR HAMAS OPERATIVES TO PLAN AND EXECUTE TERRORIST 
ATTACKS, BUT THE CLOSURE AND ATTENDANT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP ARE 
DECREASING PATIENCE ON THE STREET AND INCREASING FRUSTRATION. 
 
6.  (C) AHMAD PREDICTED THAT ALLEVIATING THE SOURCES OF PALESTINIAN 
FRUSTRATION WOULD \"PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER HAMAS\".  IF HAMAS 
WERE TO STAGE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN AN IMPROVED ECONOMIC AND 
POLITICAL CLIMATE, AHMAD PREDICTED THAT PUBLIC OPINION WOULD NOT 
SUPPORT HAMAS-INSPIRED VIOLENCE. 
 
7.  (C) COMMENT:  WHILE IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN WHAT 
HAMAS\'S SHADOWEY OPERATIONAL ELEMENTS ARE UP TO AND TO PREDICT 
THEIR FUTURE PLANS, AHMAD\'S ANALYSIS SEEMS REASONABLE FROM OUR 
POINT OF VIEW.  A PRODUCT OF THE POLITICALLY ACTIVE DHEISHEH 
REFUGEE CAMP NEAR BETHLEHEM, AHMAD IS A CREDIBLE COMMENTATOR ON 
HAMAS THROUGH HIS ACADEMIC BACKGROUND AND HIS CONTACTS IN THE LOCAL 
COMMUNITY.  AS FRUSTRATED AS THE PALESTINIAN STREET IS, IT IS 
INTERESTING THAT AHMAD DID NOT FORESEE THAT HAMAS WOULD ENJOY A 
LARGE BOOST IN POPULARITY IF IT WERE TO RESUME TERRORIST ATTACKS.

KADAMANI DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS ON WHAT ACTIVITIES AL-AQSA IS 
UNDERTAKING FOR BIN LADEN, IF ANY. 
 
4.  (S) COMMENT.  KADAMANI IS A LONG-TIME CONSULATE CONTACT AND IS 
WELL PLUGGED-IN TO PALESTINIAN FINANCIAL CIRCLES.  HE HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN VERY OPEN, AND IS SOMETHING OF A GOSSIP-MONGER.  WE DON\'T TAKE 
KADAMANI\'S REMARKS AS PROOF OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIN LADEN AND 
AL-AQSA, BUT BELIEVE THEY ARE WORTH NOTING.  END COMMENT

REF: A) JERUSALEM 1927 
 
1.  (U) CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL GENERAL JOHN E. HERBST, 
REASON 1.5(B). 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  PALESTINIANS INCREASINGLY COMPLAIN THAT 
ARAFAT\'S COTERIE OF \"GATEKEEPERS\" ARE EXERCISING A 
DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF POWER AND PREVENTING PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WITH ARAFAT FROM GETTING 
AN AUDIENCE.  MANY PALESTINIANS BELIEVE THIS GROUP IS 
PREVENTING ARAFAT FROM HEARING FROM KEY CONSTITUENTS 
WHO COULD GIVE HIM A SENSE OF THE DEEP LEVEL OF 
MISTRUST AND ALIENATION THAT MANY PALESTINIANS FEEL 
TOWARD THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA).  ONE GATEKEEPER 
-- \"ABU SAOOD\" -- PULLS A PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE 
REACTION.  HE IS A THIRD GRADE DROP OUT WHO STARTED AS 
A COFFEE BOY WITH FATAH IN AMMAN THIRTY YEARS AGO AND 
HAS NOW RISEN TO A POSITION OF CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE. 
ABU SAOOD\'S RECENT CONFRONTATION WITH FATAH WEST BANK 
HIGHER COMMITTEE HEAD MARWAN BARGHOUTI AND THE 
POLITICAL BATTLE IT HAS HELPED KICKED OFF IS ONLY THE 
LATEST EXAMPLE OF THIS GROUP\'S INFLUENCE.  THE 
FOLLOWING PIECE PROFILES ABU SAOOD.  IT IS GLEANED FROM 
THE COMMENTS AND INFORMATION GATHERED BY CONGEN FSN. 
 
----------------- 
WHO IS ABU SAOOD? 
----------------- 
 
3.  (C)  SA\'ED ZAHRAN ALLAAN, KNOWN COMMONLY BY HIS NOM 
DE GUERRE \"ABU SAOOD,\" WAS BORN AROUND 1949 INTO A 
FAMILY OF NINE IN THE WEST BANK VILLAGE OF DEIR ABU 
MASH\'AL, LOCATED NORTHWEST OF RAMALLAH NEAR THE GREEN 
LINE.  HIS FATHER, A PEASANT, WANTED HIM TO GET A GOOD 
EDUCATION AND SENT HIM TO SCHOOL IN THE NEIGHBORING 
VILLAGE OF ABOUD.  AFTER FAILING TWICE TO PASS THE 
THIRD GRADE, HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND JOINED HIS 
FATHER IN WORKING THE LAND. 
 
4.  (C) WHEN HE WAS ABOUT 20, ABU SAOOD MOVED TO AMMAN 
ON THE ADVICE OF A RELATIVE WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD 
FIND HIM A JOB IN SAUDI ARABIA OR KUWAIT.  THE PROMISED 
JOB NEVER MATERIALIZED AND THE DESTITUTE ABU SAOOD WAS 
FORCED TO WORK AT DAILY LABOR JOBS IN AMMAN\'S VEGETABLE 
MARKET TO SUPPORT HIMSELF.  THROUGH A RELATIVE, HE 
MANAGED TO LAND A JOB WITH FATAH IN THE LATE 60\'S AS 
THE COFFEE SERVER IN THE OFFICE OF THE LATE FATAH 
LEADER SALAH KHALAF (ABU IYAD).  (NOTE: COFFEE AND TEA 
SERVERS ARE FOUND IN VIRTUALLY ALL PALESTINIANS OFFICES 
IN DEFERENCE TO THE ARAB CUSTOM OF SERVING VISITORS 
REFRESHMENT.  COFFEE SERVERS CAN BE AGING MEMBERS OF 
THE OFFICE WHO STILL NEED A STIPEND OR AMBITIOUS YOUNG 
OPERATORS SEEKING UPWARD MOBILITY THROUGH DAILY CONTACT 
WITH THEIR BOSSES.  END NOTE.) 
 
----------------- 
ABU SAOOD\'S CLIMB 
----------------- 
 
5.  (C) FOLLOWING THE PLO\'S EXPULSION FROM JORDAN IN 
1970, ABU IYAD AND ABU SAOOD RELOCATED TO BEIRUT.  HE 
WAS PROMOTED TO MESSENGER BOY, WHICH REQUIRED HIM TO 
DELIVER MESSAGES AND LETTERS FROM ABU IYAD TO THE 
DIFFERENT PLO OFFICES, INCLUDING ARAFAT\'S.  FATAH 
CONTACTS AND MEMBERS OF ARAFAT\'S OFFICE SAY THAT 
WHENEVER THE OUT-GOING ABU SAOOD WENT TO ARAFAT\'S 
OFFICE HE SPENT EXTRA TIME BUILDING FRIENDSHIPS WITH 
THE CHAIRMAN\'S STAFF AND BODY GUARDS.  HE ALSO REPORTED 
THE GOINGS-ON AT THE ARAFAT OFFICE TO ABU IYAD.  IT IS 
SAID THAT DR. RAMZI KHOURY, A KEY FIGURE AT THE 
CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE AND LONG-TIME CONFIDANT ARAFAT, 
BECAME AWARE OF ABU SAOOD\'S REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES. 
KHOURY DECLINED TO TURN ABU SAOOD IN TO ARAFAT, AND 
INSTEAD OFFERED HIM A GOOD JOB IN ARAFAT\'S OFFICE IN 
THE FUTURE IF HE BEGAN REPORTING ON ABU IYAD\'S OFFICE. 
ABU SAOOD ACCEPTED AND BEGAN INFORMING ON ABU IYAD TO 
KHOURY. 
 
6.  (C)  IN THE LATE 1970\'S, ABU SAOOD MOVED TO 
ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, AS KHOURY HAD PROMISED.  DURING HIS 
INITIAL STINT, HE ANSWERED TELEPHONE CALLS, RECEIVED 
GUESTS AND SHOWED THEM TO THE CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE.  HE 
WAS NOT GIVEN ANY OFFICIAL TITLE.  ACCORDING TO 
MOHAMMED ADWAN, THE HEAD OF FOREIGN MEDIA RELATIONS FOR 
ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, ABU SAOOD PROVED HIMSELF USEFUL TO 
ARAFAT THROUGH HIS ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS BETWEEN 
PLO FIGHTERS AND MEMBERS OF THE CHRISTIAN PHALANGIST 
MILITIA, MANY OF WHOM HE HUNG OUT WITH IN BEIRUT\'S BARS 
AND BROTHELS. 
 
7.  (C)  THE MOST FAMOUS (AND COLORFUL) STORY ABOUT 
THIS PERIOD IN ABU SAOOD\'S LIFE ALSO LED TO HIS NEXT 
\"PROMOTION.\"  ACCORDING TO THE STORY/LEGEND, DURING THE 
PLO\'S BEIRUT DAYS ARAFAT BECAME VERY AGITATED WITH 
SA\'AD SALAAM, THE EDITOR OF A MAJOR CHRISTIAN NEWSPAPER 
WHO CONSTANTLY WROTE DISPARAGING STORIES ABOUT HIM. 
DURING A DINNER WITH HIS AIDES, THE CHAIRMAN COMPLAINED 
ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN EDITOR AND ASKED WHAT SHOULD BE 
DONE WITH HIM.  WHILE SOME OF THE CHAIRMAN\'S AIDES 
HELPFULLY VOLUNTEERED TO ASSASSINATE THE EDITOR, ABU 
SAOOD SOUGHT THE CHAIRMAN OUT WITH ANOTHER IDEA IN 
MIND.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD HEARD OF ARAFAT\'S DISPUTE 
WITH QLAAM QOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  HE TOLD A 
DISBELIEVING ARAFAT THAT HE WOULD BRING THE EDITOR, IN 
PERSON, TO THE HIS OFFICE AND HAVE HIM APOLOGIZE TO HIM 
AND PROMISE NEVER TO WRITE ANYTHING INSULTING AGAINST 
THE CHAIRMAN AGAIN.  THE CHAIRMAN IS SAID TO HAVE 
LAUGHED AT ABU SAOOD. 
 
8.  (C) THE NEXT DAY, HOWEVER, ABU SAOOD SHOWED UP AT 
THE CHAIRMAN\'S OFFICE ACCOMPANIED BY THE EDITOR.  TRUE 
TO ABU SAOOD\'S PLEDGE, THE EDITOR APOLOGIZED TO ARAFAT 
AND PROMISED NOT TO WRITE ANYTHING INSULTING ABOUT HIM 
AGAIN.  AFTER THE EDITOR LEFT ARAFAT\'S OFFICE, THE 
CHAIRMAN DEMANDED THAT ABU SAOOD REVEAL HOW HE MANAGED 
TO INDUCE THE EDITOR TO APOLOGIZE.  ABU SAOOD REPORTEDLY 
REVEALED THAT HE HAD BLACKMAILED THE EDITOR OVER A 
SEXUAL INDISCRETION. 
 
9.  (C) ABU SAOOD OBTAINED HIS CURRENT TITLE AND A NEW 
LEVEL OF INFLUENCE IN 1992 IN AN EQUALLY DRAMATIC 
FASHION -- HE LITERALLY PUT HIS LIFE ON THE LINE FOR 
THE CHAIRMAN.  ABU SAOOD WAS TRAVELING WITH ARAFAT WHEN 
HIS PLANE CRASHED IN THE LIBYAN DESERT.  REALIZING THAT 
A CRASH WAS IMMINENT, ABU SAOOD REPORTEDLY RUSHED THE 
CHAIRMAN TO THE TAIL SECTION OF THE AIRPLANE AND 
MOBILIZED ARAFAT\'S BODYGUARDS TO SURROUND THE CHAIRMAN, 
ACTING ESSENTIALLY AS \"HUMAN PILLOWS.\"  ABU SAOOD 
HIMSELF EMBRACED ARAFAT TO HELP ABSORB THE SHOCK OF 
IMPACT.  ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS ARAFAT DID AFTER HIS 
RECOVERY WAS AWARD ABU SAOOD THE OFFICIAL TITLE OF 
\"HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS AND PROTOCOL\" AT HIS OFFICE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
REACHING THE PINNACLE, OR THIS IS NOT A MERITOCRACY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
10. (C)  ABU SAOOD, A SHORT, PORTLY MAN WITH A GRUFF 
DEMEANOR, IS NOW WELL-KNOWN TO ANYONE WHO VISITS 
ARAFAT\'S OFFICE.  HE DETERMINES -- FOR MOST VISITORS -- 
WHETHER THEY GET AN AUDIENCE WITH THE CHAIRMAN.  AS HIS 
POWER HAS GROWN, HE HAS ALSO BEGUN TO BE DISPATCHED TO 
EVENTS TO \"REPRESENT\" ARAFAT\'S OFFICE.  WHEN HE ATTENDS 
AN EVENT IT IS UNIVERSALLY INTERPRETED AS A NOT-SO- 
SUBTLE MEANS OF INTIMIDATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, HE APPEARED 
AT THE PALESTINIAN COUNCIL SESSIONS LAST SUMMER WHEN 
THE COUNCIL WAS BALKING AT APPROVING ARAFAT\'S NEW 
CABINET.  WHEN HEATED DEBATES ERUPTED, ABU SAOOD WOULD 
SHOW UP TO \"LOBBY\" QUARRELING COUNCIL MEMBERS.  COUNCIL 
MEMBERS UNANIMOUSLY SAW ABU SAOOD\'S PRESENCE AS BOTH A 
SIGN OF HOW SERIOUSLY ARAFAT WAS ABOUT SECURING 
APPROVAL FOR HIS CABINET AND A CLEAR INDICATION THAT 
VOTING THE WRONG WAY WOULD CARRY A HIGH POLITICAL 
PRICE. 
 
11.  (C)  MORE RECENTLY, ABU SAOOD WAS INVOLVED IN A 
CONFRONTATION WITH FATAH WEST BANK HIGHER COMMITTEE 
HEAD MARWAN BARGHOUTI (REF).  THE EVENT HELPED UNLEASH 
THE CURRENT ROUND OF INTENSE POLITICAL WRANGLING THAT 
IS SEEING ELEMENTS IN ARAFAT\'S OLD GUARD TRY TO 
MANEUVER GRASSROOTS FATAH ACTIVISTS OUT OF POSITIONS OF 
POWER.  IN A SIGN OF THE DISTRUST WITH WHICH ABU SAOOD 
IS VIEWED, MANY PALESTINIANS SEE HIM AS ACTING 
INDEPENDENTLY AGAINST BARGHOUTI IN HIS CAPACITY AS THE 
SELF-APPOINTED OVERSEER OF THE PALESTINIAN DOMESTIC 
POLITICAL SCENE. 
 
12.  (C)  THE FACT THAT ABU SAOOD EITHER WIELDS THIS 
KIND OF POWER, OR IS ONLY PERCEIVED TO, PROVOKES A 
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FEAR AND LOATHING AMONG MANY 
POLITICALLY ACTIVE PALESTINIANS.  A NUMBER OF 
PALESTINIANS HAVE RECENTLY INSISTED THAT EVEN MOHAMMED 
RASHID, ARAFAT\'S POWERFUL ECONOMIC ADVISOR, HAS HAD 
TROUBLE GETTING PAST ABU SAOOD.  WHILE THIS IS HARD FOR 
US TO BELIEVE, IT DOES UNDERSCORE THE EPIC NATURE OF 
ABU SAOOD\'S REPUTATION AMONG PALESTINIANS. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
13.  (C) ABU SAOOD\'S RISE FROM UNEDUCATED MANUAL 
LABORER AND COFFEE BOY TO ONE OF ARAFAT\'S MOST TRUSTED 
AIDES OFFERS A SNAPSHOT OF THE HIGHLY PERSONALIZED WAY 
THAT ARAFAT DOES BUSINESS AND THE DIVIDENDS THAT 
LOYALTY CAN PAY.  ABU SAOOD IS A FREQUENT 
TARGET OF CRITICISM FROM PALESTINIANS WHO BELIEVE THIS 
IS A POOR WAY TO CONDUCT AFFAIRS.  THE CRITICISM ALSO 
STEMS FROM PALESTINIANS\' PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH HIM 
AS A NASTY INDIVIDUAL WHO IS MOST COMMONLY DESCRIBED BY 
CONSULATE CONTACTS AS A \"THUG.\"  (BIONOTE: ABU SAOOD IS 
MARRIED AND HAS ONE OR TWO DAUGHTERS.  HE DOES NOT 
SPEAK ENGLISH.)

CLASSIFIED BY CONSUL-GENERAL RONALD SCHLICHER PER 1.5 (D). 
 
1.  (C) SUMMARY:  PECDAR DIRECTOR MOHAMMAD SHTAYYEH 
REPORTS THAT HE HAS ARAFAT\'S BLESSING TO ESTABLISH PECDAR 
RELIEF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD FILL THE ASSISTANCE GAP 
RESULTING FROM THE PA\'S CLOSURE OF HAMAS-AFFILIATED 
CHARITIES.  SHTAYYEH WELCOMED U.S. EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE 
GULF COUNTRIES TO STEER CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AWAY 
FROM HAMAS, AND WAS HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE USG HAS 
IDENTIFIED PECDAR HAS A CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE.  HE WAS 
CONFIDENT THAT PECDAR WAS UP TO THE TASK, CITING ITS 235- 
PERSON STAFF AND A SOLID REPUTATION FOR TRANSPARENCY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS.  SHTAYYEH IS PLANNING TO ESTABLISH A NEW 
DEPARTMENT OF POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RELIEF WITHIN 
PECDAR THAT WOULD FOCUS ON WELFARE ASSISTANCE (PROVIDING 
FOOD, CASH, AND HOUSING), JOB CREATION VIA MICRO- 
GRANTS/LENDING AND A JOB PLACEMENT/SUBSIDY PROGRAM. 
SHTAYYEH ARGUED STRONGLY THAT THE BEST WAY TO PUT HAMAS 
OUT OF THE WELFARE BUSINESS IS TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES 
THROUGH OTHER CHANNELS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
POSITIONING PECDAR TO FILL THE HAMAS GAP 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2.  (C) IN A JANUARY 16 CONVERSATION WITH ECON CHIEF, 
MOHAMMED SHTAYYEH -- DIRECTOR OF THE PALESTINIAN ECONOMIC 
COUNCIL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION (PECDAR) -- 
REPORTED THAT HE MET WITH ARAFAT SOON AFTER THE PA\'S 
DECISION TO CLOSE THE HAMAS CHARITIES.  DURING THAT 
MEETING, SHTAYYEH NOTED THAT THE PA\'S DECISION TO CLOSE 
HAMAS-AFFILIATED CHARITIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS 
THREATENS TO CREATE A SO-CALLED \"HAMAS GAP,\" AS EMERGENCY 
RELIEF AND OTHER ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THESE 
INSTITUTIONS ENDS.  SHTAYYEH SAID HE HAD ADVOCATED WITH 
ARAFAT THAT THE PA COULD NOT CLOSE THE CHARITIES WITHOUT 
ENSURING THAT BENEFICIARIES CONTINUED TO RECEIVE 
ASSISTANCE.  ARAFAT HAD AGREED AND ASKED FOR A PROPOSAL, 
WHICH SHTAYYEH HAD PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF A BRIEF PAPER. 
ARAFAT HAD APPROVED THE PAPER AND INSTRUCTED THAT IT 
SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
SA\'EB EREKAT AND MINISTER FOR NGO AFFAIRS HASSAN ASFOUR. 
 
3.  (C) SHTAYYEH REPORTED THAT ASFOUR HAD SUBSEQUENTLY 
APPROACHED HIM TO SAY THAT HE WAS \"PLEASED\" WITH THE 
INITIATIVE, BUT ALSO HAD SOME IDEAS OF HIS OWN.  IN 
PARTICULAR, ASFOUR HAD STRESSED THE NEED TO WORK WITH 
NGOS IN PROVIDING RELIEF.  MINISTER OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS 
INTISSAR AL-WAZIR (UMM JIHAD) HAD ALSO CALLED HIM AND HAD 
EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT SHTAYYEH WOULD BE IMPINGING ON THE 
MINISTRY\'S OWN RELIEF EFFORTS.  SHTAYYEH HAD ASSURED HER 
THAT HE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE MINISTRY.  SHTAYYEH 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WOULD LIKELY BE ONGOING TURF 
ISSUES NOT ONLY WITH THESE PA MINISTRIES BUT ALSO WITH 
EXISTING (NON-HAMAS) NGOS.  HE HOPED PECDAR COULD OPERATE 
AS A KIND OF BROKER BETWEEN DONORS, THE MINISTRY OF 
SOCIAL AFFAIRS (WHO WOULD PROVIDE LISTS OF WELFARE CASES) 
AND NGOS AND MUNICIPALITIES WHO WOULD BE INVOLVED IN 
IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS.  HE ALSO HOPED THAT OVER TIME 
PECDAR COULD BECOME A CENTRALIZED VEHICLE FOR CHANNELING 
ASSISTANCE FROM ZAKAT COMMITTEES (RESPONSIBLE FOR 
COLLECTING AND DISBURSING ISLAMIC ALMS). 
 
4.  (C) DESPITE THE FACT THAT PECDAR HAS BUILT ITS 
REPUTATION ON IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, 
NOT SOCIAL WELFARE AND EMERGENCY RELIEF, SHTAYYEH ARGUED 
THAT PECDAR WAS WELL POSITIONED TO FILL THE HAMAS GAP. 
IT HAD A 235-PERSON STAFF, HE SAID, AND SINCE 1995 HAD 
DISBURSED OVER $110 MILLION IN EMPLOYMENT GENERATION 
PROJECTS FOR A VARIETY OF DONORS INCLUDING THE WORLD 
BANK, GERMANY, AND SWEDEN.  IT WAS ALSO IMPLEMENTING A 
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH THE WORLD BANK AND 
MUCH OF ITS CONSTRUCTION WORK HAD FOCUSED ON SMALL-SCALE 
PROJECTS RELATING TO SCHOOLS AND CLINICS. 
 
WHAT IF A MILLION DOLLARS ARRIVED TOMORROW? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C) ECON CHIEF INFORMED SHTAYYEH THAT THE USG HAS 
URGED GULF COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER PECDAR AS A POLITICALLY 
CONSTRUCTIVE CHANNEL FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO THE 
PALESTINIANS.  SHTAYYEH WAS APPRECIATIVE, AND WAS 
CONFIDENT THAT IF NEW FUNDS FROM THE GULF ARRIVED HE 
WOULD BE POSITIONED TO CHANNEL THE ASSISTANCE TOWARD 
RELIEF ACTIVITIES.  ASKED WHAT HE WOULD DO IF A MILLION 
DOLLARS ARRIVED TOMORROW, HE SAID HE WOULD FOCUS ON 
EMERGENCY HOUSING AND FOOD AND CASH ASSISTANCE IN 
SOUTHERN GAZA.  AS A FIRST STEP, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE 
DIMENSIONS OF THE CHALLENGE, SHTAYYEH HAD ALREADY ASKED 
OFFICIALS IN THE SECURITY SERVICES TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A 
LIST OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE HAMAS CHARITABLE 
INSTITUTIONS THAT HAD BEEN SHUT DOWN. 
 
 
A THREE PRONGED STRATEGY FOR PECDAR 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) LOOKING TO THE MEDIUM AND LONGER-TERM, SHTAYYEH 
SAID HE HAD BEGUN DESIGNING A NEW PECDAR DEPARTMENT THAT 
WILL FOCUS ON POVERTY ALLEVIATION AND RELIEF.  THE 
DEPARTMENT WOULD FOCUS ON THREE AREAS, WITH AN INITIAL 
EMPHASIS ON EMERGENCY RELIEF.  MOST OF HAMAS\' EFFORTS 
OVER THE LAST 15 MONTHS HAVE BEEN IN THIS AREA, HE SAID, 
INCLUDING THE PROVISION OF FOOD PACKAGES AND CASH TO THE 
NEEDY.  FOR STARTERS, SHTAYYEH HOPED TO ASSIST FAMILIES 
IN RAFAH WHOSE HOMES WERE DESTROYED LAST WEEK BY THE IDF. 
THE ARAB LIBERATION FRONT (A MINOR PALESTINIAN POLITICAL 
PARTY) HAD ALREADY BEEN IN RAFAH OVER THE LAST WEEK 
DISTRIBUTING IRAQI MONEY TO AFFECTED FAMILIES, HE SAID. 
ONE AREA WHERE HAMAS HAD BEEN QUITE EFFECTIVE FOR OVER A 
DECADE WAS IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY HOUSING TO FAMILIES 
WHOSE HOMES HAD BEEN DESTROYED, SHTAYYEH ADDED, AND HE 
HOPED THAT PECDAR WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPLANT SUCH 
ASSISTANCE.  THERE WERE FAMILIES IN SOUTHERN GAZA WHO HAD 
BEEN LIVING IN TENTS FOR FIVE OR SIX MONTHS, HE NOTED, 
AND GIVEN FUNDING PECDAR COULD RENT APARTMENTS FOR THEM. 
 
7.  (C) SECONDLY, THE NEW PECDAR DEPARTMENT WOULD FOCUS 
ON JOB CREATION VIA MICRO-PROJECTS.  THIS WOULD ENTAIL 
OFFERING SMALL GRANTS OF UP TO $2000 TO NEEDY FAMILIES TO 
HELP THEM, FOR EXAMPLE, TO BUY SEWING MACHINES OR FARM 
ANIMALS TO INCREASE THEIR INCOMES.  OTHERS WOULD BE 
PROVIDED TRAINING TO ENABLE THEM TO QUALIFY FOR SLIGHTLY 
LARGER AMOUNTS VIA MICRO-LENDING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY 
USAID AND THE PALESTINIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND.   THIRDLY, 
PECDAR WOULD INITIATE A JOB PLACEMENT-SUBSIDY PROGRAM, 
WHEREBY EMPLOYERS WOULD BE OFFERED A ONE-YEAR, 50 PERCENT 
SUBSIDY ON THE SALARIES OF NEW EMPLOYEES. 
 
 
HOW TO PUT HAMAS OUT OF THE CHARITY BUSINESS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C) SHTAYYEH ARGUED THAT, OVER THE LONG RUN, THE BEST 
WAY TO BEAT HAMAS WAS NOT TO SHUT DOWN THEIR CHARITIES 
BUT TO OUT-COMPETE THEM BY PROVIDING BETTER, ALTERNATIVE 
SERVICES.  MOST PALESTINIANS ONLY TURNED TO HAMAS 
SERVICES IF THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE, HE SAID, OBSERVING 
THAT HAMAS WAS OPERATING KINDERGARTENS IN REMOTE AREAS 
FOR PRECISELY THIS REASON.  AT THE SAME TIME, ANY DONOR- 
FUNDED EFFORT TO SUPPLANT HAMAS SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY 
DESCRIBED AS SUCH.  HAMAS CHARITIES SHOULD BE MADE 
IRRELEVANT VIA A QUIET, APOLITICAL, LONG-TERM, SYSTEMATIC 
PUBLIC WELFARE AND RELIEF EFFORT.  WHEN ECON CHIEF 
SUGGESTED THAT HE CONSIDER A FUND-RAISING TOUR IN THE 
GULF, SHTAYYEH AGREED, BUT STRESSED THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE 
PUBLICLY BILLED AS AN ANTI-HAMAS EFFORT.  FOR ONE THING, 
A FUND-RAISING EFFORT PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED WITH SUCH A 
POLITICAL OBJECTIVE WOULD LIKELY INSPIRE LESS GENEROSITY 
IN THE GULF THAN ONE THAT FOCUSED SIMPLY ON THE NEEDS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
9.  (C) ECON CHIEF SPOKE SEPARATELY WITH NORWEGIAN 
REPRESENTATIVE GEIR PEDERSEN WHO INDICATED NORWAY\'S 
WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PECDAR TO 
HELP IT RETOOL FOR ITS NEW ROLE.  PEDERSEN SPOKE 
SUBSEQUENTLY WITH SHTAYYEH, WHO WELCOMED THE OFFER. 
PEDERSEN ENVISAGES THAT THE HAMAS GAP WILL BE A CENTRAL, 
IF IMPLICIT, ISSUE AT THE AD HOC LIAISON COMMITTEE (AHLC) 
MEETING PLANNED FOR EARLY MARCH, AND HE HAS URGED 
SHTAYYEH TO PREPARE A PRESENTATION FOR THAT MEETING. 
 
10.  (C) DESPITE THE POTENTIAL TURF ISSUES OF WHICH 
SHTAYYEH IS FULLY AWARE, WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY SHTAYYEH\'S 
EFFORTS SO FAR AND REMAIN CONVINCED THAT PECDAR IS INDEED 
THE BEST OPTION FOR REDIRECTING ARAB ASSISTANCE AWAY FROM 
HAMAS CHARITIES.  PECDAR HAS A STRONG REPUTATION FOR 
FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND HAS 
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS PROJECTS FOR THE WORLD 
BANK AND EUROPEAN DONORS.  IT IS NOT AN OFFICIAL PA 
ENTITY, WHICH WILL LIKELY BE ADVANTAGE IN ATTRACTING 
ASSISTANCE FROM GULF DONORS.  AT THE SAME TIME, SHTAYYEH 
OPERATES IN THE PA ORBIT AND WILL IMPLEMENT THE PA LINE 
AS HE DOES HIS BEST TO DRY UP THE MARKET FOR HAMAS 
CHARITY.  HOWEVER, SHTAYYEH IS ALSO FAMED AS AN \"EMPIRE 
BUILDER\" AND THE NORWEGIANS AND WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH 
HIM TO DESIGN A PROGRAM THAT WORKS EFFECTIVELY AND 
COLLEGIALLY WITH LEGITIMATE PALESTINIAN NGOS.  WE ALSO 
TAKE SHTAYYEH\'S POINT THAT WE WILL PROBABLY MAKE HIS 
FUNDRAISING AND IMPLEMENTATION JOB THAT MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT IF WE PAINT IT PUBLICLY AS A POLITICAL, ANTI- 
HAMAS INITIATIVE -- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE IT CLEAR 
TO SHTAYYEH THAT OUR POLICY IS THAT THE HAMAS 
INSTITUTIONS MUST BE, AND REMAIN, CLOSED, NOT SLOWLY MADE 
IRRELEVANT BY PECDAR\'S AND OTHER EFFORTS.

1. (C) SUMMARY: A SENIOR FATAH OFFICIAL AND PLC MEMBER 
CRITICIZED HAMAS FOR CONDUCTING OPERATIONS IN JERUSALEM, 
SAYING THIS WAS PART OF A WIDER COMPETITION BETWEEN FATAH AND 
HAMAS OVER WHICH DIRECTION TO TAKE THE RESISTANCE.  THE 
DISCOVERY OF A HAMAS CELL IN EAST JERUSALEM WILL COMPLICATE

2. (C) HATEM ABDEL QADER, A MEMBER OF THE PALESTINIAN

FOR THE WEST BANK, TOLD POLCHIEF 8/22 THAT HAMAS OPERATIONS 
INSIDE JERUSALEM VIOLATED AN UNDERSTANDING WITH FATAH NOT TO 
CONDUCT SUCH ACTIVITIES IN JERUSALEM.  RECENT REVELATIONS OF 
A HAMAS CELL IN EAST JERUSALEM COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE 
PLIGHT OF THE 220,000 PALESTINIANS LIVING IN EAST JERUSALEM, 
AND WOULD CERTAINLY COMPLICATE THE BROADER, ONGOING 
CEASE-FIRE TALKS BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS, HE SAID.  FATAH\'S 
POLICY ON JERUSALEM, ACCORDING TO ABDEL QADER, HAS BEEN TO 
EMPLOY NON-VIOLENT MEANS TO PRESS THE GOI ON 
JERSULEM-SPECIFIC ISSUES (I.E., HOME DEMOLITIONS, LAND AND ID 
CONFISCATIONS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE). 
 
3. (C) ABDEL QADER SAID THAT THE PRESENCE OF A HAMAS CELL IN 
JERUSALEM WAS A MANIFESTATION OF A LARGER ONGOING COMPETITION 
BETWEEN FATAH AND HAMAS OVER RESISTANCE TACTICS.  HAMAS WAS 
IDEOLOGICAL AND MAXIMALIST, WHILE FATAH WAS PRAGMATIC AND 
FOCUSED; THAT\'S WHY FATAH WAS NOW PURSUING A CEASE-FIRE 
(COMMENT: ALBEIT ONE LIMITED GEOGRAPHICALLY TO INSIDE GREEN 
LINE ISRAEL -- SEE REFTELS).  ON ARAFAT\'S ORDERS, FATAH HAD 
HAD TO THREATEN TO EXPEL PARTY MEMBERS FOR TAKING WEAPONS AND 
MONEY FROM HAMAS AND PIJ -- RESOURCES THAT ORIGINATED FROM 
TEHRAN, HE SAID.  IN ADDITION, ABDEL QADER SAID HE WAS 
PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN WHAT HE TERMED \"THE BATTLE FOR THE 
CHILDREN\" -- A FATAH EFFORT TO COUNTER UNDUE HAMAS INFLUENCE 
IN THE SCHOOLS THAT WAS RADICALIZING PALESTINIAN YOUTH BY 
EXPOSING THEM TO DAILY PROPAGANDA ABOUT ALLEGED ISRAELI 
ATROCITIES.  \"THE LAST THING WE WANT IS A RADICAL ISLAMIC 
STATE LIKE IRAN,\" HE SAID. 
 
4. (C) ABDEL QADER EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT FATAH WOULD 
PREVAIL.  FIRST, THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP ITSELF WAS NOW DIVIDED 
OVER RESISTANCE TACTICS, A RIFT THAT FATAH WOULD ATTEMPT TO 
EXPLOIT, HE SAID.  SECOND, MOST PALESTINIANS WERE NOT 
COMFORTABLE WITH HAMAS\' SOCIO-POLITICAL PLATFORM (EVEN IF 
MANY ADMIRED THE PARTY\'S \"STEADFASTNESS\").  \"LET US HAVE 
ELECTIONS AND LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES -- YOU 
WILL SEE, WE WILL WIN.\" 
 
5. (C) COMMENT: EAST JERUSALEM\'S PALESTINIANS HAVE 
TRADITIONALLY BEEN HARDER TO RECRUIT FOR TERRORIST OPERATIONS 
BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIVILEGED POSITION VIS-A-VIS WEST BANK 
PALESTINIANS.  NOT SUBJECT TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, THEY ARE 
ECONOMICALLY BETTER OFF, AND ARE ENTITLED TO ISRAELI SOCIAL 
SERVICES THAT, WHILE SHORT OF WHAT ISRAELI CITIZENS ENJOY, 
ARE SUPERIOR TO THOSE THE PA PROVIDES TO PALESTINIANS IN THE 
WEST BANK AND GAZA.  THAT SAID, THE DISCOVERY OF A HAMAS CELL 
IN JERUSALEM IS A REMINDER THAT VIOLENT RESISTANCE STILL 
RESONATES AMONG SOME HERE, AND A SIGN OF THE CONTINUING 
DISUNITY AMONG PALESTINIAN POLITICAL FACTIONS ON ACCEPTABLE 
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.

Classified By: Acting Principal Officer Jeffrey Feltman, per 1.5 (b) an 
d (d). 
 
(U)  This cable has been cleared with Embassy Tel Aviv. 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C)  Following up on his conversation with Embassy PolOff 
last week (reftel), PA Minister of Culture Ziad Abu-Amr, in a 
meeting with A/PO in Ramallah on 8/4, said that Hamas leaders 
would tell PA Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas in Gaza this week 
that they are prepared to extend the cease-fire for an 
additional three months.  During that time, Abu-Amr insisted, 
the PA must move decisively toward municipal elections as a 
way to channel Hamas\' \"energy\" into a permanent buy-in to the 
PA\'s political program, including negotiations for a 
two-state solution.  Hamas is ready, Abu-Amr argued, and may 
even be ready to participate in PA elections (which would 
symbolize belated acceptance of the Oslo political 
landscape).  Bringing Hamas on board without a major 
confrontation is not appeasement but realism, Abu-Amr 
insisted:  the PA might very well lose an outright fight and, 
even if the PA largely prevailed, the result of a 
confrontation might be splinter cells that are impossible to 
root out.  It is far better to capitalize upon what he 
described as the extreme internal discipline of Hamas (which 
he compared favorably with the unruly nature of Fatah) to end 
the violence once and for all through an internal political 
process that includes Hamas.  If the cease-fire unravels, he 
predicted, it will be due to a process started by Al-Aqsa 
and/or Israeli actions, not something Hamas starts.  End 
summary. 
 
HAMAS TO TELL ABU MAZEN 
\"YES\" ON EXTENDING CEASE-FIRE 
----------------------------- 
 
2.  (C)  In his high-rise Ramallah office overlooking the 
ruins of the Muqatta\'a, Abu-Amr continued his conversation 
begun the previous week with Embassy PolOff on the PA-Hamas 
dialogue (reftel).  Hamas leaders, he predicted, will tell 
Abbas in Gaza this week that they are prepared to extend the 
cease-fire (\"hudna\" was the word Abu-Amr used throughout the 
conversation) for an additional three months.  Hamas leaders, 
keenly monitoring popular reactions, sense that the 
Palestinian population at this point largely supports the 
cease-fire;  moreover, the Hamas external leadership is still 
feeling the pressure of U.S. demands on Syria.  Thus it has 
not been all that difficult, Abu-Amr claimed, to persuade 
them to extend the cease-fire. 
 
DANGER TO CEASE-FIRE NOT 
(IN FIRST INSTANCE) FROM HAMAS 
------------------------------ 
 
3.  (C)  As he had last week, Abu-Amr dismissed concerns that 
Hamas or rogue elements thereof might unilaterally start 
actions that break the cease-fire.  Citing the \"extreme 
discipline\" of Hamas, Abu-Amr expressed far more worry about 
unilateral Israeli moves or Al-Aqsa Martryrs Brigade attacks 
that could invite Israeli retaliation that would cause the 
cease-fire to unravel.  Abu-Amr referred with worry to the 
Al-Aqsa-claimed firing that wounded four people near Gilo the 
previous night.  While Palestinian disappointment over what 
they perceive as the inadequate Israeli positive response to 
the drop in violence and threats \"seriously weakens\" the 
commitment to the cease-fire, Hamas, he insisted, will not be 
the ones to endanger the cease-fire. 
 
HAMAS LEADERS MORE MODERATE 
THAN THE STREET 
--------------------------- 
 
4.  (C)  At the same time, Hamas will not be able to extend 
the cease-fire indefinitely without something to show for it. 
 The considerable \"energy\" that has been focused over the 
past few years in \"waging the Intifada\" must be channeled 
elsewhere.  Hamas leaders in Gaza are \"more moderate\" than 
their young followers, Abu-Amr insisted, and are ready to 
turn the movement toward what the PA would consider more 
constructive and more acceptable activities.  (Abu-Amr 
claimed that the fiery Abdulaziz Rantissi was the exception 
to his claim that the Gaza leadership was more moderate. 
Rantissi\'s \"problem,\" he said, is personal, in that he bears 
severe grudges against the \"humiliations\" he suffered at the 
hands of Mohammed Dahlan\'s forces in 1996, when Dahlan had 
Rantissi shaved and jailed.)  In this, the \"more moderate\" 
Hamas leaders are assisted by the Hamas prisoners in Israel, 
whose prison experience has generally given them a \"more 
sophisticated,less radical\" understanding of their political 
horizons.  (Abu-Amr digressed at this point to a \"law of 
diminishing returns\" regarding the prisoners -- that, having 
gone through a period of moderation, they risked becoming 
radicalized if Israel continued to stall on prisoner 
releases, doing only small numbers begrudgingly.) 
 
CHANNELING HAMAS 
ENERGY TO ELECTIONS 
------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  Abu-Amr speculated that, before the expiry of the 
second three-month cease-fire, the PA must be in the midst of 
serious preparations for \"rolling\" municipal elections. 
Elections, rather than the conflict with Israel, would then 
become the focus for Hamas and other groups.  Everyone\'s 
attention, he predicted, would be on the local races, rather 
than on Israeli action.  A/PO asked what sort of standard the 
PA would insist upon as the price for Hamas\' admisssion to 
the elections, commenting that the PA should not entertain 
the thought of allowing participation in elections by any 
group that maintained illegal military wing and considered 
violence an acceptable political tool. 
 
HAMAS MUST BUY ON TO PROGRAM 
---------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  Abu-Amr agreed that Hamas must subscribe to the 
basic parameters of the PA and PLO program, which he 
articulated as renunciation of violence, acceptance of a 
two-state solution and Israel\'s right to exist in peace and 
security, and resolution of the conflict through 
negotiations.  Abu-Amr claimed that the Hamas leaders are 
already \"more or less\" committed to these ideas but need to 
have a political excuse, cover and incentive -- which 
elections would provide -- to be more explicit on these 
points.  It is good, Abu-Amr said, that Islam as an ideology 
is flexible -- one can find justification for fighting, and 
one can find justification for ending the physical fight in 
favor of political fights.  \"The doctrine is hospital to 
change.\"  A/PO asked whether the PA would insist on written 
commitments to this effect by any candidates or groups that 
would choose to participate in the elections, but Abu-Amr, 
avoiding a direct answer, responded that all would be decided 
as preparations for local elections geared up.  A/PO 
reiterated the point that Hamas would never be accepted by 
the U.S. and Israel as a legitimate political faction as long 
as it maintained its military wing and left open the 
possibility of returning to violence. 
 
HAMAS READY FOR PA ELECTIONS, TOO? 
---------------------------------- 
 
7.  (C)  Musing about how he has witnessed the evolution in 
thinking by the local Hamas leaders, Abu-Amr speculated that, 
once conditions are right for PA legislative and presidential 
elections, Hamas would also want to field candidates in those 
races.  This is a revolution in Hamas thinking, he argued. 
Before, Hamas leaders always left open the idea of 
participating for local or \"national\" (PLO-wide) office, but 
they clearly rejected any PLC elections that might bless what 
Hamas viewed as an illegitimate Oslo-based institution.  By 
hinting that they would field Hamas candidates in PLC races, 
Hamas leaders are again underscoring their acceptance of the 
Olso political landscape including a negotiated settlement 
with Israel.  Abu-Amr also noted, however, the 
\"impossibility\" of legislative elections in the current 
period.  He cited two roadblocks:  the Israeli occupation of 
most West Bank cities, and the U.S. hostility to PA 
presidential elections (as long as Arafat would emerge as a 
viable candidate) which the Palestinians would insist 
accompany any legislative elections. 
 
TRYING TO CAPITALIZE 
ON HAMAS DISCIPLINE 
-------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  When A/PO cautioned Abu-Amr that the PA must be very 
careful not to encourage a process that would in effect 
extend a lifeline to terrorist groups that must be fought, 
Abu-Amr responsed that co-opting the majority of Hamas 
members through elections was \"not appeasement.\"  If the PA 
launched a frontal battle against Hamas now, he said, \"we 
would lose.\"  Even if, with time, the PA would prevail in an 
outright military confrontation, \"we would create a thousand 
splinter groups,\" individual cells that would step up attacks 
on the PA and -- especially -- on Israel, since Israel would, 
\"based on its behavior over the past three years,\" pound the 
PA in retaliation to what Hamas was doing.  The plethora of 
\"splinter groups\" would be impossible to root out.  Abu-Amr 
described this scenario as a \"lose-lose\" proposition. 
 
9.  (C)  What he is proposing, Abu-Amr said, is a \"pragmatic, 
realistic\" approach:  use the best quality of Hamas, its 
internal discpline, to end the violence definitively in favor 
of a political approach.  If elections can induce the Hamas 
leadership to echo Abu Mazen\'s message that the armed 
Intifada is over, then the majority of the Hamas cadres would 
be on board.  It would be relatively easy for the PA to crush 
those elements that do not go along with the Hamas 
leadership, since the numbers would be relatively few, he 
predicted, and because they would be defying the wishes of 
the collective Palestinian leadership. 
 
CRITICAL ELEMENTS OF THIS SCENARIO: 
ISRAELI ACTION AND MOVEMENT ON REFORM 
------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C)  Abu-Amr closed by saying that his relatively rosy 
scenario assumed two things:  that Israel would take steps 
forward, even if more slowly than the Palestinians would 
like, that strengthened the PA, and that the PA itself 
proceeds as quickly as possible with its domestic reform 
program.  Both of those elements would bring credibility to 
the Abu Mazen government, he said, and would illustrate to 
the population the benefits of Abu Mazen\'s policies.  If 
Israeli steps or Palestinian reform stall completely -- and 
he criticized both for not moving quickly enough -- then he 
was worried that his scenario for co-opting Hamas through 
elections might not work as well as he had just outlined. 
For that reason, he said, he has become a \"real nag\" in PA 
cabinet meetings about the need to move forward on reforms 
other than in the financial area, \"the only sector where our 
record is excellent.\"

and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary: Fatah Central Committee member and frequent 
Arafat ally Sakher Habash, in a conversation with Pol/C in 
Ramallah 9/3, said he saw only two ways out of the ongoing 
political crisis in the Palestinian Authority:  either PM 
Abbas makes amends with Arafat and the Fatah leadership, or 
he resigns and Arafat appoints another Central Committee 
member as PM in his place.  Habash said he thought Abbas had 
little to gain from seeking support from the Legislative 
Council; the PLC may not vote down his government, but it is 
also unlikely to give him a new mandate.  Habash guessed that 
Abbas knows this and wants to use his PLC appearance on 9/4 
to presage his resignation from the government.  End summary. 
 
\"Peackocks Fighting Over a Garbage Dump\" 
---------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) Abu Mazen and Abu Ammar (Arafat) are \"two peacocks 
fighting over a garbage dump,\" scoffed Sakher Habash, an 
influential member of Fatah\'s Central Committee who has been 
closely involved in the recent shuttle diplomacy between the 
PA Prime Minister and the PLO Chairman.  Instead of fighting, 
they should be working closely together because they need one 
another to carry out the difficult steps on reform and 
security called for in the roadmap.  He laid primary blame 
for the failed relationship with Abu Mazen, who in his view 
has failed to consult the Chairman sufficiently. 
 
3. (C) Habash also faulted the PM for resigning from Fatah\'s 
governing body, the Central Committee (Note: Abbas resigned 
from the Central Committee on July 7 after he was accused by 
its members of failing to achieve sufficient results in 
roadmap talks with the GOI.  The Central Committee has 
refused to accept his resignation.  End note).  \"Without the 
backing of Fatah and Arafat, who will support him?  How can 
he be expected to confront Hamas?\" he asked, pointing to the 
PM\'s poor faring in recent public opinion polls 
(three-percent popularity in a July poll).  Abbas added to 
his difficulties by delegating Interior Minister authorities 
to Mohammed Dahlan, Habash said, thus \"circumventing\" the 
Fatah Central Committee\'s decree that the Interior Minister 
must be one of their own. 
 
4. (C) Finally, Habash concluded, neither Israel nor the U.S. 
gave the PM sufficient support.  Habash said he did not doubt 
that the U.S. wanted Abbas to succeed, as the means of making 
the roadmap succeed.  But he said that he had serious doubts 
that Israel had accepted the roadmap in good faith -- 
\"Otherwise, they would have done much more to strengthen Abu 
Mazen.\" 
 
Cooperate or Resign 
------------------- 
 
5. (C) So what\'s the way forward, Pol/C asked?  Habash 
responded that there are only two options.  Under the first, 
Abbas makes amends with Arafat, re-joins the Central 
Committee, and comes to a mutually acceptable resolution of 
who controls the security services (Note:  As reported 
previously, the plan currently under discussion involves the 
PM appointing a Central Committee member such as Nasser Yusif 
as Interior Minister with authority over all the security 
forces, and agreeing to cooperate with an Arafat-chaired 
\"national security council\" that would provide policy 
guidance on security matters.  End note). 
 
6. (C) Under the second, PM Abbas resigns and Arafat appoints 
a new PM.  Habash was quick to emphasize that any new PM 
would also need to come from the Central Committee; he 
refused to discuss likely names, only noting that \"there are 
eleven of us here\" and ruling out himself.  Asked for his 
reaction to Salam Fayyad and Munib al-Masri as possible PM 
candidates -- Fayyad is a political independent and Masri, 
while a Fatah member, has mainly concentrated on his business 
activities -- he laughed and offered more colorful metaphors. 
 While praising the Finance Minister\'s performance and 
personal integrity, he said, \"Fayyad is a dentist.  Why 
appoint a dentist when what we need is a cardiologist?\"  As 
for the businessman Masri, he said, \"He is made of wax; he 
will melt in the job.\" 
 
7. (C) As for Abbas\'s gambit to elicit a new mandate from the 
PLC on 9/4, he said he doubted it would help him, as the PLC 
would likely neither vote him down nor give him his desired 
mandate.  \"He is probably using the PLC to prepare for his 
resignation,\" Habash mused. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) Throughout the meeting, Habash returned to the theme 
that no prime minister can succeed without the support of 
Arafat and Fatah\'s leadership.  Although there is no 
precedent to Abu Mazen\'s premiership, one could argue that 
recent history indicates that he has a point.  Beginning with 
his quarrels with Arafat over the formation of his government 
in April, Abbas became increasingly exasperated with Arafat 
and his allies in Fatah, consulted them less frequently, and 
finally resigned from the Central Committee in early July 
after its members leveled harsh criticism at him for his 
handling of roadmap negotiations with Israel.  The conflict 
with Arafat and the Fatah elders flared up again in August 
over who should control the security services.  Given the 
stakes involved in the security services issue, it was not 
surprising therefore that Arafat and his allies fought back 
more fiercely, launching a series of demonstrations this week 
against Abbas and his government (singling out Fayyad and 
Dahlan in particular), raiding Fayyad\'s offices in Gaza, and 
encouraging an Arafat appointee who was dismissed by Abbas to 
remain on the job with the assistance of armed gunmen. 
Lacking public support, Abbas has turned to the PLC for a 
mandate, which he is unlikely to get.  Of course, there is 
another way that we choose to read this tale:  that Abu Mazen 
was never really given a fair chance, with or without the 
Fatah Central Committee, because Arafat was never going to 
allow him to exercise real authority.

1. (C) Summary:  Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, disappointed 
and embittered after losing a power struggle with Arafat that 
left him publicly branded as a traitor, sent his letter of 
resignation to the PA President on September 6, then vented 
his frustrations to the Legislative Council in a closed 
session the same day.  Abbas criticized Arafat for impeding 
his ability to govern, Israel for continuing its policy of 
targeted killings, and the U.S for failing to press Israel to 
implement its roadmap commitments.  Upon receiving Abbas\'s 
resignation letter, Arafat discussed his PM\'s fate among the 
Fatah,  PLO and PLC leadership, and -- with most in favor of 
Abbas\'s departure -- scribbled on the letter, \"Accepted, with 
God\'s blessing.\"  On September 7, Arafat, after further 
consultations with the Fatah leadership, announced his 
decision to tap PLC Speaker, Ahmed Qure\'i (Abu Ala\'a), to 
form a new government.  Assuming Qure\'i accepts the 
appointment, he will have five weeks to form a government. 
Even as the next phase of political machinations began, 
several Fatah and PLC members in this weekend\'s drama looked 
back with wonder and not a little remorse.  End summary. 
 
The PM Says Goodbye 
------------------- 
 
2. (C) According to several ConGen sources in Ramallah, Abbas 
had already sent his resignation letter -- via Cabinet 
Affairs Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and Cabinet Secretary (and 
FCC member) Hakim Balawi -- to the Muqatta\'a hours before he 
addressed the PLC in closed session at noon on September 6. 
(Abed-Rabbo told A/PO that he had expected Arafat to refuse 
to accept the letter except from Abbas himself.  To 
Abed-Rabbo\'s surprise, Arafat appeared \"eager,\" nearly 
grabbing the letter from Abed-Rabbo\'s hands.)  The PM was 
reportedly deeply disturbed by Fatah-organized demonstrations 
against him in Ramallah and Gaza the previous week (ref A), 
and graffiti on buildings in both cities branding him and his 
Security Affairs Minister Mohammed Dahlan collaborators with 
Israel and the U.S.  One story has it that he was 
particularly upset after hearing that his grandson\'s 
classmates taunted him by shouting that his grandfather was a 
traitor.  To avoid the crowd that was assembling outside the 
PLC building, Abbas entered through the rear door and, 
without revealing that he had already submitted his 
resignation, proceeded to enumerate his grievances. 
 
3. (C) Israel and the U.S., Abbas lamented, had \"misled\" him 
with their professions of support for his government and the 
roadmap.  Most seriously, Israel, by killing several Hamas 
and PIJ activists in Nablus and Hebron in early August, had 
effectively torpedoed the hudna, ignited a new cycle of 
violence, and halted or revoked implementation of Israel\'s 
other roadmap commitments.  He faulted the U.S. for not 
taking action to restrain Israel. 
 
4. (C) But Abbas directed most of his ire at Arafat.  Arafat, 
he told the legislators, had interfered with his power of 
appointment as guaranteed in the amended Basic Law, 
describing incidents in which Arafat improperly re-instated 
the head of the dismissed Personnel Bureau head in Gaza and 
revoked the appointment of Abdel Fattah Hemayel as Minister 
of Sports and Youth.  Similarly, Abbas complained about 
Arafat\'s interference in Abbas\'s decision to designate his 
Foreign Minister, Nabeel Sha\'ath, as the PA\'s delegate at 
Arab League and UN meetings.  Abbas said he had obtained 
Arafat\'s acquiescence, but then the Chairman reversed his 
position, embarrassing the PM and throwing PA diplomatic 
representation into confusion. 
 
5. (C) Finally, with regard to the central issue of 
consolidating the security forces under the Prime Minister, 
Abbas argued that he had not been trying to challenge 
Arafat\'s constitutional role as supreme commander of the 
armed forces, but rather to bring the PA into compliance with 
the roadmap.  Nevertheless, he said, Arafat fought the move, 
even though it was clearly against an agreed PLO/PA policy to 
implement the roadmap fully.  Abbas ended his speech by 
observing that his political position had deteriorated so 
badly, he had been labeled a \"Karzai\" by the public.  PLC 
Speaker Abu Ala\'a then announced that Abbas had submitted his 
resignation earlier in the morning. 
 
Arafat Says OK 
-------------- 
 
6. (C)  Following the PLC session, Arafat convened the Fatah 
Central Council (FCC) to discuss how to react to Abbas\'s 
resignation.  In the FCC, Nabeel Sha\'ath and Tayib Abdel 
Rahim reportedly argued against accepting Abbas\'s resignation 
or, alternatively, accepting it and then re-appointing him. 
But they were in the minority, and the FCC eventually agreed 
by consensus that Abbas should go.  This view was reinforced 
by reports that Abbas had informed the press that his 
decision was final.  Arafat then reportedly made the decision 
to accept Abbas\'s resignation, writing on the PM\'s letter, 
\"Accepted, with God\'s grace.\" 
 
7. (C) That evening, Arafat next summoned PLO leaders and 
about 50 PLC members to the Muqatta\'a to discuss the matter 
further, even though he had already reached his decision. 
Some argued for giving Abbas another chance -- PLC member 
Mohammed Hourani, in particular, argued that Abbas had been 
treated unfairly and complained that he had been compared to 
\"Karzai.\"  \"Don\'t ever utter Abbas\'s name and Karzai\'s in the 
same sentence again,\" warned Arafat, as he announced his 
decision to the group and declared the matter at an end. 
(Abu Mazen later mused to A/PO that he didn\'t understand the 
complaints -- \"would they rather have the warlords or Taliban 
leading Afghanistan?  It should be a compliment to be called 
\'Karzai\'!\") 
 
Abu Ala\'a Is Tapped 
------------------- 
 
8. (C) The next day, September 7, Arafat turned his attention 
to choosing Abbas\'s successor.  Once again, he convened the 
FCC, whose members (including four who reside abroad who 
participated by phone) unanimously supported their FCC 
colleague, Abu Ala\'a.    The FCC members also reportedly 
discussed a security strategy to satisfy U.S. demands that 
the PA unify its security services under the PM and take 
action on the ground. 
 
The Weekend\'s Players Look Back with Remorse 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (C) A tone of remorse prevailed as several Fatah and PLC 
members today looked back over the weekend\'s events in 
conversations with Poloff.  A tired Mufid abd Rabbo, a 
Tulkarm PLC and Fatah Higher Committee member, stayed in 
Ramallah all weekend for what he described as a \"series of 
meetings filled with tension, anger, and blood-loss.\"  Still, 
he argued, \"you can\'t steal authorities (from Arafat) in our 
government, and that is what Abu Mazen was trying to do.\" 
Amin Maqbul, acting head of the Fatah Higher Committee, 
struck a defensive note in recounting the weekend\'s events to 
Poloff.  \"We met over and over again and didn\'t reach an 
understanding (with Abu Mazen),\" he said.  But, he insisted, 
\"we didn\'t push him to leave.\"  Jamal ash-Shobaki, now 
Minister of Local Government in a caretaker cabinet, was 
inconsolable.  \"Abu Mazen sincerely wanted to reform this 
government,\" he lamented.  \"He had some successes, but 
outside problems kept strengthening the people who were being 
hurt by the changes.  So they had an excuse to start calling 
him a traitor.  Israel caused the collapse of Abu Mazen by 
never complying with the roadmap.\"  Nablus PLC member Dalal 
Salameh summed up the weekend without Shobaki\'s rancor 
(probably because she is not in danger of losing a 
ministership) but with possibly greater poignancy.  Her 
comment was an epitaph: \"You lost a moderate current in 
Palestine,\" she said, \"and we lost an important leader.\" 
 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10. (C) The alacrity with which Abbas resigned and Arafat 
accepted his resignation and tapped PLC Speaker Abu Ala\'a for 
the job surprised many observers here, but Arafat and the 14 
members of Fatah\'s Central Committee were unlikely among them 
(ref B).  Irked by Abbas\'s penchant for acting alone and 
failing to consult traditional Palestinian leadership bodies 
(i.e., foremost among them the FCC, of course), Arafat and a 
determined group within the FCC, reportedly led by Hani 
al-Hassan and Abbas Zaki, have worked steadily, mostly behind 
the scenes, to undermine Abbas since the day he returned from 
the summits at Aqaba and Sharm al-Sheikh last June.  Abbas\'s 
efforts to wrest control of the security forces after the 
August 19 bus bombing went a step too far for Arafat.  The 
questions now are whether and to what extent Arafat and the 
FCC will back Abbas\'s successor.  These issues are now under 
negotiation, as Abu Ala\'a works out his terms with the PA 
President for accepting the appointment.

SUBJECT: ISLAMIC RADICALS ATTACK EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
AT AL-AQSA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: CONSUL GENERAL DAVID D. PEARCE PER 1.5(D). 
 
1. (U) EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER AHMAD MAHER CAME UNDER 
ATTACK BY ISLAMIC ACTIVISTS WHILE VISITING AND PRAYING AT THE 
HARAM ASH-SHARIF ON THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 22.  A VIDEO 
SHOWS MAHER BEING MOBBED BY ANGRY WORSHIPPERS AND APPARENTLY 
CHOKED BRIEFLY BY A CLOTH AROUND HIS NECK.  WORSHIPPERS 
REPORTEDLY THREW SHOES AT HIM, AN ARAB SIGN OF DISRESPECT, AS 
HIS ENTOURAGE RUSHED HIM OUT OF THE MOSQUE.  HE IS REPORTED 
TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER SUFFERING SHORTNESS OF BREATH. 
SALAH ZUHEIKEH, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY (PA) WAQF DEPUTY 
MINISTER, TOLD POLOFF THAT THE ISLAMIC HIZB AT-TAHRIR 
(LIBERATION PARTY) WAS BEHIND THE ASSAULT.  THE PARTY 
OBJECTED TO MAHER\'S PRESENCE BECAUSE OF THE ALLEGEDLY 
\"UN-ISLAMIC\" NATURE OF THE EGYPTIAN REGIME AND THE EGYPTIAN 
GOVERNMENT\'S DECISION TO NEGOTIATE PEACE WITH ISRAEL.  PA 
PRIME MINISTER ABU ALA\'A AND NEGOTIATIONS AFFAIRS MINISTER 
SA\'EB EREKAT CONDEMNED THE ATTACK, AND THE WAQF COUNCIL IS 
PREPARING A SIMILAR CONDEMNATION. 
 
2. (C) ZUKEIKEH TOLD POLOFF THAT THIS ATTACK WAS NOT THE 
FIRST TIME THAT HIZB AT-TAHRIR FANATICS HAVE CAUSED A 
DISTURBANCE ON THE HARAM ASH-SHARIF.  WHEN JORDAN FINANCED 
THE RENOVATION OF THE DOME OF THE ROCK TEN YEARS AGO, WAQF 
WORKERS ATTEMPTING TO PUT UP A SIGN IN HONOR OF KING HUSSEIN 
CAME UNDER ATTACK FROM HIZB AT-TAHRIR MEMBERS.  AS IN THIS 
INCIDENT, THE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK WERE ONLY LIGHTLY 
INJURED. 
 
3. (U) COMMENT: HIZB AT-TAHRIR ESPOUSES A RADICAL PHILOSOPHY 
WHILE PROMOTING SURPRISINGLY MODERATE MEANS.  THE PARTY CALLS 
FOR THE RETURN OF THE MUSLIM CALIPHATE, THE ABOLITION OF ALL 
CURRENT \"INFIDEL\" ARAB REGIMES, AND THE DESTRUCTION OF 
ISRAEL.  NEVERTHELESS, THE PARTY REJECTS THE USE OF VIOLENCE 
IN THE PURSUIT OF THESE GOALS.  THE PARTY CLAIMS THAT THE 
PROPHET MUHAMMAD DID NOT RESORT TO JIHAD AND VIOLENCE IN THE 
EARLY DAYS OF ISLAM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED THE NUCLEUS OF AN 
ISLAMIC NATION.  ONLY THEN DID HE BEGIN THE JIHAD AND 
CONQUESTS THAT SPREAD ISLAM ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN 
KEEPING WITH THAT TRADITION, THE PARTY ESCHEWS VIOLENCE UNTIL 
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PROPER ISLAMIC STATE.  ZUHEIKEH TOLD 
POLOFF THAT, IN RECENT YEARS, RIVAL FACTIONS OF THE PARTY 
HAVE EMERGED PUSHING A HARDER LINE THAT CALLS FOR A MORE 
FORCEFUL APPROACH TO SPREADING THE PARTY\'S MESSAGE.  WHILE 
THESE MEMBERS STOP SHORT OF TERRORISM, THEY DO BELIEVE IN 
USING FORCE OCCASIONALLY LIKE THE GROUP\'S FOLLOWERS DISPLAYED 
ON THE HARAM ASH-SHARIF TODAY.

SUBJECT: HOW HAMAS IS WORKING TO REPLACE THE PA AND THE PLO 
 
Classified By: Consul General David D. Pearce. Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
This cable has been cleared by Embassy Tel Aviv. 
 
1. (C) Summary:  A range of Palestinian thinkers and 
activists are reporting  that Hamas is moving with 
unprecedented boldness to establish itself as an alternative 
leadership to the Palestinian Authority (PA) and PLO.  Hamas 
leaders are publicly arguing that stalled roadmap 
implementation, the weakening of the PA, and the building of 
the separation barrier all vindicate the movement\'s long-held 
position that a negotiated two-state solution to the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not possible.  PA ministers 
have told us in January and December that Hamas effectively 
controls several strongholds in the Gaza Strip.  Hamas 
representatives at cease-fire talks in December refused to 
recognize the PLO and PA as institutions representative of 
the Palestinian people.  They called for an entirely new 
political leadership.  Meanwhile, Hamas has won significant 
victories in student council and syndicate elections across 
the West Bank over the past several months.  Hamas leaders 
also appear to be emphasizing an ability to conduct 
Palestinian foreign policy on their own.  Hamas leaders in 
Gaza have made a point of receiving Egyptian envoys in 
meetings that paralleled those the Egyptians are holding with 
the PA.  The Hamas foreign policy -- based on a rejection of 
any final peace agreement with Israel -- is aimed at 
escalating the Intifada, burying the roadmap, and undermining 
the PA.  End summary. 
 
Hamas Throws Down the Gauntlet in Cairo 
--------------------------------------- 
 
2. (C) A range of Palestinian thinkers and activists are 
reporting to us that Hamas is moving with unprecedented 
boldness to establish itself as an alternative leadership to 
the Palestinian Authority and PLO.  Fatah contacts raised the 
first alarm bells on this subject in December when they 
returned, shocked, from failed cease-fire talks in Cairo. 
Fatah negotiator Ahmad Ghnaym told us he was unnerved that 
the Hamas delegation had not only rejected the PA\'s 
cease-fire plan, but also announced that it did not consider 
either the PA or the PLO to be institutions representative of 
the Palestinian people.  For years, Hamas had said it would 
compete with secular, nationalist parties like Fatah if it 
were allowed to stand on equal footing within the confines of 
existing institutions.  Hamas leaders said they wanted to 
join the PLO, but they insisted upon 40 percent control of 
the PLO National Council as their price.  This time, Hamas 
delegates in Cairo refused to approve a statement that would 
have confirmed the authority of the PA and the legitimacy of 
the PLO.  When one left-wing activist suggested adjusting PLO 
decision-making to give Hamas a greater voice, Hamas 
delegates countered that the Palestinian people needed a new 
leadership body altogether, with a new charter and political 
program. 
 
Hamas Establishes 
Bases of Control in Gaza 
------------------------ 
 
3. (C) PA ministers have told us that Hamas effectively 
controls several strongholds in the Gaza Strip.  PA Minister 
of Local Government Jamal al-Shobaki recently exclaimed in a 
conversation with Poloff, \"I just visited Gaza.  Hamas is in 
control there.  There is no Authority in Gaza.\"  Prime 
Minister Abu Ala\'a mentioned to visiting Senator Bill Nelson 
on January 7 that his aides had advised him against even 
attempting to visit Rafah.  In an audacious challenge to the 
PA, masked and armed Hamas militants on December 29 waylaid 
PA Housing Minister Abd al-Rahman Hamad and Arafat office 
director Ramzi Khuri as they rode in a convoy toward the 
Rafah crossing in southern Gaza.  The militants held Hamad 
and Khuri for about four hours and took them on a forced tour 
of IDF damage inflicted on the Rafah area, demanding to know 
why the PA had failed to defend and provide aid to its 
constituents. 
 
Establishing Itself As 
The Mainstream Palestinian Representative 
----------------------------------------- 
 
4. (C) Throughout December and January, Hamas has worked to 
assert itself as a representative of the entire Palestinian 
people, not just one Islamist faction. 
 
-- Leading the Resistance:  Hamas delegates in Cairo 
deliberately staked out a position for the movement as the 
leader of Palestinian resistance.  Hamas delegates rejected 
the PA and Fatah\'s cease-fire plan in Cairo, and then, when 
the talks foundered, returned home implying that they held a 
deeper commitment to the Intifada than other factions. 
 
-- Making Independent Foreign Policy:  Hamas leaders in 
recent weeks appear to be emphasizing an ability to conduct 
Palestinian foreign policy on their own.  Hamas leaders in 
Gaza made a point in December of receiving Egyptian envoys in 
meetings that paralleled those the Egyptians are holding with 
the PA.   An Egyptian embassy official told DPO on January 15 
that Hamas envoys in Egypt are attempting to discuss 
cease-fire issues independently of the PA.  Hamas political 
leader Abd al-Aziz al-Rantisi claimed January 15 to have 
rejected what he said were secret U.S. contacts calling for a 
cease-fire.  Hamas political leader Musa Abu Marzuq similarly 
recently claimed that the movement had secret contacts with 
the U.S. in the past. 
 
-- Broadening Its Ideology:  Hamas Spiritual Leader Shaykh 
Ahmad Yasin January 13 publicly revived a long-dormant 
proposal to offer Israel an extended truce in exchange for a 
withdrawal to the June 1967 lines.  The statement appeared to 
be an effort to broaden the appeal of Hamas to Palestinians 
who are reluctant to support the movement because of a 
doctrine that promises seemingly never-ending war. 
 
A Sharpened Propaganda Campaign 
Against the Palestinian Authority 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (C) Hamas is complementing these efforts to assert itself 
with a sharpening of its long-running public campaign to 
undermine faith in the PA.  Al-Risalah, a weekly Gaza 
newspaper linked to Hamas, ran an \"exclusive\" story on 
January 8 that offers a telling example of anti-PA 
propaganda.  The article editorialized that the PA \"is absent 
from the political and the social arena.\"  The article quotes 
an unnamed Legislative Council official as saying, \"There is 
no such thing as a government... Since the government\'s 
formation it has not made a single political or domestic 
decision.\"  The article cites the opinions of \"young men\" who 
allegedly believe that \"charity organizations offer aid and 
assistance to the population long before the PA does.\"  The 
article concludes by quoting a PLC member who says that the 
current crisis necessitates more than a new cabinet, but a 
\"review of the Palestinian situation as a whole, especially 
the political system.\" 
 
Building Influence in 
Quasi-Governmental Bodies 
------------------------- 
 
6. (C) Hamas activists also dealt a blow to Fatah, and with 
it the PA, in a series of strong showings in student council 
and syndicate elections in December.   Hamas deepened its 
control of the Bir Zeit University student council, a Fatah 
stronghold before the Intifada.  Hamas candidates won control 
of the Ramallah Mens Training Center and of the Engineers 
Syndicate Elections in Gaza.  Hamas rivaled Fatah without 
completely prevailing in several other elections where its 
influence was previously negligible.  At Bethlehem University 
-- a largely Christian institution -- Hamas rose from 
negligible support to take seven seats to Fatah\'s 13.  In the 
West Bank Engineers Syndicate elections, Fatah headed off a 
Hamas victory by agreeing to share power in the steering 
committee. 
 
Comment:  A Vulture Circles the PA 
---------------------------------- 
 
7. (C) Hamas\'s effort to sideline the PA and PLO and dominate 
Palestinian politics is an evolutionary effort, not a 
revolutionary one.  \"They want power, but they don\'t want a 
civil war,\" Jerusalem\'s Arab Thought Forum Director Abd 
al-Rahman Abu Arafah emphasized to Poloff in a meeting on 
January 15.  Hamas is aiming to perpetuate violence and 
instability and claim power as the central authority of the 
PA recedes.  This tactic has already helped Hamas build 
strongholds in Gaza.  Victories in syndicate and student 
council elections have also won it a significant foothold in 
the West Bank.  With reportedly undisputed control over most 
mosques in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Hamas is positioned 
to spread its message even as it remains outside of 
Palestinian political institutions. 
 
8. (C) Many analysts of Palestinian politics have devoted 
excessive attention to polls in assessing the power balance 
in the West Bank and Gaza.  By the polls, Hamas and Fatah are 
rivals with about 20 percent support each (but with Fatah 
almost always slightly higher).  (The vast majority of 
Palestinians register their dissatisfaction with either 
group.)  But in a Palestinian political environment that is 
increasingly anarchic, a well-organized minority like Hamas 
can exert influence far beyond its numbers.  More 
importantly, the separation barrier is proving to be an 
unexpected but crucial boon to the organization.  As the 
route of the barrier leads Palestinians to conclude that a 
two-state solution is impossible, Hamas leaders are claiming 
that their long-time opposition to accommodation with Israel 
is being vindicated.  More importantly, as the barrier and 
checkpoints isolate and divide the West Bank and Gaza, the 
PA\'s central institutions are losing their reach and local 
organizations are rising in importance.  Hamas has long 
devoted its efforts to building a wide network of local 
welfare services, precisely the type of institutions 
Palestinians are coming to rely upon as IDF-imposed internal 
closures deny them freedom of movement.  Meanwhile, the PLO, 
which put most of its efforts into building a centralized, 
authoritarian PA, laments it is boxed in and unable to act 
effectively. 
 
9. (C) When Abu Ala\'a gave up on the Cairo cease-fire talks 
in December following Hamas\'s rebuff, a new political dynamic 
was born.  Hamas, long a critical outsider, had demonstrated 
an ability to veto a central plank of a PA government.  Now 
the movement is attempting to pocket that veto, press its 
advantage, and begin to actually direct Palestinian policy.

CONDITION WORSENS 
 
Classified By: Consul General David D. Pearce.  Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
1. (C) Summary:  Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasir 
Arafat\'s health deteriorated suddenly the evening of November 
3, according to ConGen sources in Ramallah, who said his 
doctors in Paris had moved him to an intensive care unit 
after he began vomiting and experiencing fatigue and fever. 
Negotiations Affairs Minister Sa\'eb Erekat told DPO November 
4 that his condition had stabilized overnight, and that his 
medical team would make an announcement regarding his health 
later in the day.  Prime Minister Abu Ala\'a\'s chief of staff, 
Hasan Abu Libdah, told the Consul General that Arafat\'s 
condition was serious and that information regarding his 
health was being closely held.  The leadership of the PLO and 
Fatah are planning to meet November 4 to discuss the 
situation.  End summary. 
 
Sudden Setback 
-------------- 
 
2. (C) Arafat\'s health deteriorated suddenly November 3. 
According to a source in the Muqatta\'a who had been in 
contact with Arafat\'s entourage in Paris, Arafat suddenly 
began vomiting and developed a fever and increased fatigue, 
alarming his doctors, who moved him to an intensive care unit 
(ICU).  National Security Adviser Jibril Rajub told DPO 
November 3 that he had spoken to Arafat\'s wife, Suha, and PLO 
UN rep Nasser al-Kidwah, who told him Arafat\'s condition was 
stable.  Local Palestinian media reported November 4 that PLO 
rep to Paris Leyla Shahid confirmed that Arafat\'s condition 
had worsened and that he had been placed in the ICU.  She 
said his medical team would make an announcement regarding 
the Chairman\'s health November 4 in the afternoon (Note: 
There was to have been an announcement November 3, but it 
never took place.  Note.) 
 
Alarm Bells Go Off 
------------------ 
 
3. (C) Arafat\'s worsening condition fueled speculation among 
some PA officials that he was about to die, perhaps of 
poisoning.  Sa\'eb Erekat, repeating information he had 
already passed directly in Washington, told DPO at around 1 
am November 4 that the PLO\'s representative to the UN, Nasser 
al-Kidwah, had phoned him urgently from Paris saying that 
Arafat had been poisoned by the GOI and insisting that Erekat 
enlist Washington\'s support for obtaining the antidote from 
the GOI (Comment:  Al-Kidwah evidently phoned Erekat with 
this alarming report before Arafat\'s condition improved.  End 
comment).  Rajub called DPO at 2:30 am to report that 
Arafat\'s condition was stable and that press reports of a 
deterioration in Arafat\'s health had been sourced back to a 
Fatah Central Committee member who had leaked the earlier, 
dire reports to Reuters. 
 
4. (C) In a subsequent conversation with DPO on November 4, 
Erekat said that he had spoken to Arafat\'s doctors, who 
informed him that the Chairman\'s condition had stabilized and 
he had stopped vomiting, that he remained in the ICU, and 
that his vomiting attack was similar to those he had suffered 
in Ramallah.  Erekat assessed Arafat\'s health at \"50 - 50.\" 
Prime Minister Abu Ala\'a\'s chief of staff, Hasan Abu Libdah, 
told the Consul General November 4 that Arafat\'s condition 
was serious, and that there was \"some panic\" among the 
leadership.  He said that information regarding Arafat\'s 
health was being closely held, and that Abu Ala\'a was very 
worried and would be participating in meetings of the 
leadership later in the day to discuss the situation. 
 
5. (C) A source in ex-PM Abu Mazen\'s office said Abu Mazen 
would chair a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee and the 
Fatah Central Committee November 4.  (Note:  As secretary 
general of the PLO, Abu Mazen is next in line after Arafat; 
he is also the ranking member of Fatah, in the absence of 
Tunis-based Faruq al-Qaddumi.  Abu Mazen reportedly canceled 
plans to fly from the UAE, where he attended Shaykh Zayyid\'s 
funeral, to Paris, after receiving news that Arafat\'s 
condition had stabilized.  End note.) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
6. (C) The sudden deterioration in Arafat\'s health November 3 
has alarmed Palestinian officialdom in Ramallah, some of whom 
had been optimistically predicting his recovery and eventual 
return in time for the end-of-Ramadan feast in mid-November. 
In his conversation with the CG this morning, PM Abu Ala\'a\'s 
chief of staff Abu Libdah, who is not prone to exaggeration 
or melodrama, sounded very concerned about Arafat\'s 
prognosis, implying that the leadership in meetings today 
might be planning for his succession.  The continuing lack of 
information about the cause of Arafat\'s illness, coupled with 
reports of his continuing vomiting and fever attacks, has 
fueled wild speculation that he may have been poisoned by 
Israel, raising tensions among his staff in the Muqatta\'a, 
who would naturally fall under suspicion.

SUBJECT: ABD RABBO:  LIFE AND DEATH WITH SUHA -- STRANGER 
THAN FICTION 
 
Classified By: Consul General David D. Pearce. 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
1.  (C) Summary:  PLO ExCom member Yasir Abd Rabbo told DPO 
November 9 that Suha Arafat\'s undignified rant on al-Jazeera 
in which she accused the Palestinian leadership of conspiring 
against her husband had found no resonance among Palestinians 
in the West Bank and Gaza.  Instead, her behavior had made 
her even more unpopular than before.  He supported the 
decision by Abu Mazen and Abu Ala\'a to go to Paris to see for 
themselves Arafat\'s condition even if it meant that they 
would then probably be faced with a very difficult decision. 
Observing that Fatah Central Committee (FCC) member (and heir 
to Arafat\'s chairmanship of the Central Committee) Faruq 
al-Qaddumi was showing signs of senility, Abd Rabbo dismissed 
Qaddumi\'s reported plan to engineer for himself the 
chairmanship of the PLO executive committee and to move the 
PLO back to Tunis so that he could lead from exile.  Any 
suggestion of support for Qaddumi among FCC members, he 
claimed, was intended to make Abu Mazen pay a higher price 
for Fatah unanimity.  End Summary 
 
 
SUHA\'S RANT FINDS NO RESONANCE 
 
2.  (C) During a November 9 meeting, Geneva Initiative 
sponsor and PLO executive committee member Yasir Abd Rabbo 
told DPO that most Palestinians were aghast at Suha Arafat\'s 
outburst on al-Jazeera satellite television the previous day 
and that the episode has only added to her unpopularity in 
the West Bank and Gaza.  Suha, he said, had always been 
excitable but her behavior in recent days had become \"crazy.\" 
 Aside from the absurdity of her closing her al-Jazeera rant 
with cries of \"Allahu Akbar!\" her accusations against the 
Palestinian leadership were irresponsible and probably 
prompted by a coterie of advisors that includes her Lebanese 
paramour Pierre Rizk and several French lawyers.  Her 
conspiracy accusations had found no resonance among 
Palestinians in the West Bank/Gaza, Abd Rabbo said; and her 
undignified behavior has reached a point where it is 
beginning to tarnish Arafat\'s own legacy.  He fully supported 
the decision by Abu Mazen, Abu Ala\'a, and others to go to 
Paris to demand a full report of Arafat\'s condition.  Noting 
that they may also have to participate in making a difficult 
decision, Abd Rabbo said it still had to be done. 
 
 
SUHA TAKES A STAB AT KING-MAKING 
 
3.  (C)  Appearing to fully appreciate the outlandishness of 
events in Paris, Abd Rabbo said that Suha had gradually and 
methodically eliminated access to Arafat by all those who had 
gone to Paris to wait by his bedside.  Arafat\'s closest male 
relative (except for his brother Fathi, also rumored to be on 
his deathbed) Nasir Al-Kidwa, had not seen Arafat for four or 
five days, Abd Rabbo said.  Suha\'s stranglehold on 
information had proven to be too much for the leaders in 
Ramallah who are trying to ensure a smooth transition; Abd 
Rabbo predicted that the French would no longer \"play Suha\'s 
game\" and would allow Abu Mazen and Abu Ala\'a access even 
over Suha\'s objections (Note:  Abd Rabbo was proved right. 
End Note)  In addition to isolating Arafat, Suha had also, 
rather maladroitly, attempted to intervene in the 
Palestinians\' succession arrangements by anointing Faruq 
al-Qaddumi in a rather bizarre turn of events.  According to 
Abd Rabbo, Qaddumi had arrived in Paris only to be kept out 
of Arafat\'s room like everyone else.  He became angry and 
left for the airport only to receive en route a call from 
Suha in which she reportedly told him that Arafat had spoken 
and said, \"He says you are his caliph (successor).\"  This was 
enough to make Qaddumi turn around, return to the hospital 
and read out to the media a statement written by Suha which 
was so implausibly optimistic about Arafat\'s prospects for 
recovery that it was immediately deemed incredible. 
 
 
QADDUMI LOOKING TO TAKE THE PLO BACK TO TUNIS 
 
4.  (C) If that foolishness were not enough, Abd Rabbo went 
on to relate Qaddumi\'s ambitions to eventually supplant Abu 
Mazen as PLO executive committee (ExCom) chairman after he 
assumes the role on Arafat\'s passing.  Qaddumi\'s plan is to 
use his accessing to the Fatah Central Committee (FCC) 
chairmanship to load the ExCom in his favor.  He would then 
move the PLO back to Tunis to lead from exile, leaving the 
Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern in the West Bank and 
Gaza.  (Comment:  Not clear if anybody has asked the 
Tunisians for their views.  End Comment) Abd Rabbo noted in 
relating this plan that he has also heard that Qaddumi is 
showing signs of senility.  Certain FCC members, however, are 
supporting or pretending to support Qaddumi\'s pretensions; 
among them are Saqer Habash, Hani al-Hasan, and Abbas Zaki. 
Asked if they could seriously be supporting Qaddumi, Abd 
Rabbo opined that they in fact want to make Abu Mazen pay a 
higher price for their support and FCC unanimity in the 
transition period. 
 
 
THE POISON THEORY:  ARAFAT\'S PENCHANT FOR SELF-MEDICATION TO 
BLAME? 
 
5. (C) Asked how credible he found the theory of poison being 
the cause of Arafat\'s illness, Abd Rabbo indicated that it is 
the prevailing explanation in Palestinian leadership circles. 
 He noted, however, that the delivery mechanism is still 
unexplained but he offered two theories:  1)  Arafat had 
always considered himself to be an expert on everything, 
including medicine, and had taken prescription drugs 
virtually indiscriminately; in fact, he had a suitcase full 
of drugs and popped pills constantly; or 2) Arafat\'s symptoms 
seem to resemble the condition that affected PFLP terrorist 
Wadi\' Haddad who was reportedly poisoned by the Iraqis with a 
glass of tea.  All speculation aside, Abd Rabbo hoped that 
the French would ultimately provide a credible cause of 
Arafat\'s illness.  He also commented that he thought the 
French had learned a lesson after they allowed George Habash 
to seek medical treatment in France.  \"Now,\" he said, \"they 
won\'t let a Palestinian at the airport ask for an aspirin 
without immediately deporting him!\" 
 
6.  (C)  Comment:  Abd Rabbo always enjoys relating the 
inside story and Suha\'s doings provided him with material of 
an unusually rare quality, even given the Palestinians\' 
generally high standard of eccentric behavior.  But, he was 
also clearly relieved that Suha seemed to be on the way to 
being declawed and that Abu Mazen and Abu Ala\'a were finally 
taking charge of Arafat\'s medical condition.  Although Abd 
Rabbo is among the most liberal of Palestinians, even he was 
shocked by Suha\'s behavior both in Paris and during her brief 
stay in Ramallah when she arrived only to take Arafat back 
with her to France.  Noting that Suha has been on the outs 
with her famous mother Raymonda Tawil for two years, Abd 
Rabbo related that when Raymonda came to the Muqatta\'a to 
greet Suha that day, Suha failed to stand to greet her own 
mother.  Abd Rabbo\'s shock, he said, was shared by the rest 
of the Palestinian leadership present to witness the event. 
Suha, called by some a \"rapacious harpy,\" has certainly set 
the seal on her deep unpopularity in the last week.
