SUBJECT:  ETHIOPIA:  1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A) STATE 42318  B) STATE 54781 
 
1.  SINCE THE DAYS OF EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE, 
ETHIOPIA HAS TAKEN A STRONG ANTI-TERRORIST 
STANCE, LARGELY BECAUSE IT BELIEVES ANY SHOW 
OR WEAKNESS TO TERRORISTS WOULD SERVE AS A STIMULUS 
TO THE VARIOUS ARMED INSURGENT GROUPS WITHIN 
ETHIOPIA.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, ETHIOPIA HAS BEEN 
FREE OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST OPERATIONS SINCE 
THE DAYS OF HAILE SELASSIE WHEN SEVERAL HIJACKINGS 
WERE FORCEFULLY REPRESSED. 
 
2.  LIBYA HAS FOUR OFFICERS ACCREDITED 
AT ITS PEOPLE\'S BUREAU IN ADDIS ABABA AND 
ITS HEAD IS THE VICE DEAN OF THE DIPLOMATIC 
CORPS.  LIBYA HAS A JOINT AGRICULTURAL 
PROJECT WITH ETHIOPIA, BUT THE NUMBER OF 
LIBYANS INVOLVED IS UNKNOWN.  ETHIO-LIBYAN 
RELATIONS HAVE BEEN AT A LOW POINT FOR THE 
PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND THE LIBYA-ETHIOPIA-PDRY 
TRIPARTITE PACT HAS BEEN  MORIBUND FOR SOME TIME. 
 
3.  THE PLO OPENED ITS ONE-PERSON OFFICE IN 
ETHIOPIA IN 1978  BASED ON ITS OBSERVER 
STATUS AT THE OAU.  THE PLO IS NOT INCLUDED 
IN THE DIPLOMATIC LIST AND DOES NOT ENJOY 
OTHER DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES. 
 
4.  WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE PLO LOST THE HOUSE 
AND CAR PROVIDED BY THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT 
AFTER THE PLO OFFICE IN PYONGYANG DISTRIBUTED 
A MAP OF ETHIOPIA WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE ERITREA 
AS A PROVINCE.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO 
CONFIRM THAT REPORT. 
 
5.  THE BUREAU OF THE POPULAR FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF PALESTINE HAS ALSO MAINTAINED A 
ONE-PERSON OFFICE HERE SINCE 1978.  IT HAS NO 
DIPLOMATIC STATUS, BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE 
REPRESENTATIVE IS PROVIDED WITH A HOUSE BY THE 
ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT.

SUBJ: ETHIOPIA: 1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 355397 
 
1.  C-ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RESPONSE TO PARA 5 OF REFTEL: 
 
A)  POST HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION REGARDING 
GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS OF TERRORISTS.  IN MARCH, 
1990, A BOMB BLAST AT THE HILTON HOTEL RESULTED IN 
THE EXPULSION OF TWO LIBYAN DIPLOMATS.  THE 
EXPULSION OCCURRED WITHIN 48 HOURS OF THE BLAST, AND 
THE MISSION HAS NO INFORMATION REGARDING THE 
INVESTIGATION LEADING TO THE GPDRE ACTION. 
 
B)  POST HAS NO RECORD OF THE GPDRE REQUESTING 
EXTRADITION FOR SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
C)  IN TERMS OF PROSECUTION, POST CANNOT IMAGINE THE 
GPDRE EXPERIENCING ANY IMPEDIMENTS;  IT WOULD LIKELY 
BE SWIFT AND BRUTAL.  IN TERMS OF EXTRADITION, IT 
WOULD LIKELY BE DEPENDENT UPON WHETHER THE GPDRE HAS 
AN EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE REQUESTING COUNTRY. 
THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXTRADITION TREATY WITH THE 
U.S. 
 
D)  THE GPDRE HAS PROFESSED A DESIRE TO ASSIST IN 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL MATTERS-I.E., NARCOTICS 
TRAFFICKING - BUT HAS PROVIDED NO SPECIFICS ON 
TERRORIST MATTERS.  THIS MAY BE A DELICATE SUBJECT 
FOR THEM, AS THE PLO IS RECOGNIZED AND REPRESENTED 
IN THIS COUNTRY. 
 
E)  POST IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MAJOR COUNTERTERRORIST 
EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY THE GPDRE.  THEY HAVE MADE A 
MAJOR EFFORT TO COUNTERACT EPLF AND TPLF ACTIVITY IN 
ADDIS (AND THAT COUNTRYSIDE STILL UNDER GOVERNMENT 
CONTROL), WHOM THEY REGARD AS TERRORISTS.  THE EPLF 
AND TPLF ARE FAR TOO LARGE, STRONG, AND OCCUPY TOO 
MUCH ETHIOPIAN TERRITORY TO BE CONSIDERED TERRORISTS. 
 
F)  POST HAS NOT DISCOVERED ANY ETHIOPIAN SUPPORT 
FOR TERRORIST GROUPS OR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, 
ASIDE FROM ETHIOPIAN RECOGNITION OF THE PLO.  THE 
CURRENT GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS AT RAPPROCHEMENT WITH 
THE WEST HAS MEANT INCREASED SECURITY SURVEILLANCE 
OF THE PLO, LIBYANS, AND IRAQIS. 
 
G)  POST HAS HEARD NOTHING FROM THE GPDRE THAT COULD 
BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTING TERRORISM, OF AN ACTION 
FROM THE \"TERRORISM LIST\" OF COUNTRIES.  IN FACT, 
ETHIOPIA HAS COME OUT STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THE 
U.N. POSITION CONDEMNING IRAQ FOR ITS INVASION OF 
KUWAIT. 
 
H)  THE GPDRE HAS GIVEN THE APPEARANCE OF BEING 
SUPPORTIVE OF COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS, THOUGH 
EMBASSY EFFORTS TO SECURE A TERRORISM LIAISON FOR 
THE RSO HAVE NOT YET BEEN FRUITFUL (THEY HAVE BEEN 
ONGOING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS).  THIS INCREASED 
COOPERATIVE SPIRIT IS A TREND SEEN OVER THE LAST 18 
MONTHS, AS THE GPDRE TURNS AWAY FROM COMMUNISM AND 
BEGINS A TURN TOWARDS THE WEST. 
 
2.  IF S/CT REQUIRES ANY MORE DETAILED INFORMATION, 
PLEASE DON\'T HESITATE TO ASK.  REGARDS.

          ETHIOPIA\'S SOMALI REGION 
 
REF:  ADDIS ABABA 01479 
 
1.  (U)  CLASSIFIED BY POLOFF JEFFREY JACOBS, 1.5 (D). 
 
2.  (C)  SUMMARY.  RETIRED SOMALI GENERAL JAMA ISSA 
MOHAMUD (AKA JAMA \"GREEN\") DISCUSSED RISING ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALIST ACTIVITY IN ETHIOPIA\'S SOMALI REGIONAL 
STATE AND OFFERED POSSIBLE METHODS TO COUNTER THE THREAT 
TO REGIONAL STABILITY.  THE GENERAL WARNED THAT ETHIOPIAN 
MILITARY AUTHORITIES ARE WRONG TO ASSUME THAT THEY HAVE 
THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.  HE SUGGESTED THAT ONLY A 
REGIONAL EFFORT, COORDINATED BEHIND THE SCENES BY THE 
UNITED STATES, CAN DEFEAT THE WELL-FINANCED, HIGHLY 
DISCIPLINED GUERRILLAS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  (C)  ON 29 FEBRUARY POLOFF AND DEFENSE ATTACHE MET 
WITH RETIRED SOMALI GENERAL JAMA \"GREEN\".  THE MEETING 
WAS ARRANGED BY FREQUENT EMBASSY CONTACTS DR. FARAH 
HUSSEIN MOHAMED AND MOHAMMED MURSAL SHIL.  SOMALILAND 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE MUSSA (FNU) WAS PRESENT FOR THE 
FIRST FEW MINUTES, BUT THEN SLIPPED OUT OF THE MEETING 
SAYING HE WOULD \"TALK WITH POLOFF LATER.\" 
 
------------------------------------ 
JAMA WELL-ACQUAINTED WITH AL\'ITTIHAD 
------------------------------------ 
 
4.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA COMMANDED SOMALI FORCES WHICH HE 
CLAIMED HAD DEFEATED THE AL\'ITTIHAD ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISTS IN JANUARY 1993.  THE GENERAL SAID THAT 
AL\'ITTIHAD AT THAT TIME WAS 10,000 STRONG AND BASED 
PRIMARILY IN \"SOMALILAND.\"  THE GENERAL SAID THAT HIS 
FORCES CUT OFF MORE THAN 3,000 GUERRILLAS FROM THEIR 
SOURCES OF SUPPLY IN A POCKET NEAR THE TOWN OF ERIGAVO 
//GEOCOORDS:  1037N/4722E//.  JAMA SAID HIS UNITS KILLED 
MANY OF THE AL\'ITTIHAD FIGHTERS BEFORE THE REMAINDER 
SURRENDERED.  JAMA SAID HIS TROOPS ROUNDED THEM UP, 
TRUCKED THEM INTO THE WESTERN DESERT, AND TOLD THEM TO GO 
BACK TO THEIR CLANS.  THE GENERAL ESTIMATED THAT SOME 
2,000 AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS FLED INTO ETHIOPIA, WITH MANY 
SETTLING IN WARDER //GEOCOORDS: 0658N/4520E//, GODE 
//GEOCOORDS: 0606N/4301E//, AND KEBRI DEHAR //GEOCOORDS: 
0644N/4417E//. 
 
----------------------------------- 
AL\'ITTIHAD IS RISING FROM THE ASHES 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA SAID AL\'ITTIHAD IS NOW REGROUPING 
IN THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE AND THAT THE EXTREMISTS ARE 
BEING TRAINED IN THE REGION BY INSTRUCTORS FROM YEMEN, 
AFGHANISTAN, AND IRAQ (NFI).  OTHER AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS 
ARE RECEIVING TRAINING IN LIBYA, SUDAN, IRAN.  A FEW ARE 
IN MOMBASA, KENYA.  THE GENERAL SAID HE HAS HEARD, BUT 
CANNOT CONFIRM, THAT SOME ARE IN IRAQ. 
 
----------------------------- 
AL\'ITTIHAD THREATENS THE HORN 
----------------------------- 
 
6.  (C)  THE GENERAL DESCRIBED AL\'ITTIHAD AS THE MOST 
DANGEROUS THREAT TO STABILITY IN THE HORN OF AFRICA.  HE 
DESCRIBED AL\'ITTIHAD AS HAVING ITS ROOTS OUTSIDE SOMALIA 
AND SAID THAT THE CHAOS FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SIAD BARRE 
GAVE THE POLITICAL ISLAMISTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PENETRATE THE REGION. 
 
7.  (C)  JAMA SAID THE FUNDAMENTALIST GOAL IS TO 
ESTABLISH AN ISLAMIC STATE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA.  HE 
CLAIMED THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS COMPRISED OF DISCIPLINED 
FANATICS WHO HATE INTELLECTUALS, CHRISTIANITY, WHITE 
PEOPLE, AND LOCAL RELIGIOUS LEADERS.  HE SAID THEY 
EXPLOIT THE IGNORANCE OF THE PEOPLE ABOUT RELIGION TO 
SPREAD THEIR FALSE MILITANT VERSION OF THE KORAN. 
(SOURCE COMMENT:  HENCE THEIR HATRED OF RELIGIOUS 
LEADERS.  END COMMENT.) 
 
---------------------------------- 
EXTERNAL SUPPORT TO THE EXTREMISTS 
---------------------------------- 
 
8.  (C)  JAMA DESCRIBED SUDANESE LEADER AL TURABI AS THE 
SPIRITUAL LEADER OF THE EFFORT TO CREATE AN ISLAMIC 
STATE, AND SAID AL\'ITTIHAD RECEIVES ASSISTANCE FROM 
SUDAN, IRAN, IRAQ, AND LIBYA.  HE SAID THEIR CURRENT 
METHOD OF OPERATION IS TO FUNNEL AID THROUGH SOMALI 
STRONGMAN MOHAMMED FARAH AIDEED, WHOM JAMA DESCRIBED AS 
\"A POWER-HUNGRY ANIMAL WHO CARES LITTLE ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
OF SOMALIA.\"  JAMA ADDED THAT THE EMIR OF SHARIQAH (AS 
HEARD) IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES ALSO SUPPORTS 
AL\'ITTIHAD. 
                                                     - 
9.  (C)  JAMA SAID AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO 
TRACE THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO 
AL\'ITTIHAD.  THE GENERAL SAID LITTLE MONEY IS SENT 
DIRECTLY TO SOMALIA; MOST IS ROUTED THROUGH EUROPEAN 
SOURCES (NFI), ADDING THAT \"A LOT OF WESTERN MONEY IS 
GOING TO AIDEED.\"  JAMA SAID THE INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC 
RELIEF ORGANIZATION (IRO) IS PARTICULARLY SUSPECT, AND HE 
CLAIMED THAT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE FLOWING, YET THE 
\"IRO REJECTED A LEGITIMATE PROPOSAL FOR A LIVESTOCK 
PROJECT.\" 
 
10.  (C)  POLOFF ASKED THE GENERAL ABOUT THE CARGO 
CARRIED BY SUPPLY FLIGHTS TO AL\'ITTIHAD REPORTED BY DR. 
FARAH.  JAMA CONFIRMED THAT TWO WEEKLY FLIGHTS DEPART 
MOGADISHU FOR A DESERT AIRSTRIP ALONG THE ETHIOPIAN- 
SOMALILAND BORDER (REFTEL).  THE GENERAL SAID RECENT 
CARGOS INCLUDED NEW CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORMS AND SMALL ARMS 
AMMUNITION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT UNDERESTIMATES THE THREAT 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
11.  (C)  THE DEFENSE ATTACHE ASKED JAMA WHY THE 
ETHIOPIAN MINISTRY OF DEFENSE HAS CLAIMED THAT IT 
CONTROLS THE REGION.  JAMA REPLIED THAT THE ETHIOPIAN 
GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY ARE POORLY INFORMED ABOUT THE 
TRUE SITUATION IN THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE.  HE SAID THE 
LARGELY TIGRAYAN MILITARY, IN PARTICULAR, HAS SURROUNDED 
ITSELF WITH TRUSTED ETHNIC SOMALI ADVISORS WHO ARE NOT IN 
TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE REGION.  AS A RESULT, JAMA 
SAID THE MILITARY IN THE REGION OFTEN ARREST ALLEGED 
AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS AND SEIZE THEIR PROPERTY ON THE 
FLIMSIEST OF EVIDENCE.  JAMA SAID THAT WHILE THE PEOPLE 
DO NOT LIKE AL\'ITTIHAD, HEAVY-HANDED EFFORTS BY THE 
GOVERNMENT ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
JAMA EXPLAINS HOW TO DEFEAT AL\'ITTIHAD 
-------------------------------------- 
 
12.  (C)  GENERAL JAMA SAID AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT TO 
DEFEAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS ESSENTIAL, AND HE ADDED THAT ONLY 
THE UNITED STATES CAN COORDINATE THE ENDEAVOR.  THE MOST 
CRITICAL STEP, HE ARGUED, IS TO CLOSELY WATCH EXTREMIST 
SUPPLY ROUTES THROUGH BERBERA AND DJIBOUTI.  JAMA ALSO 
SUGGESTED MONITORING ARABIC LANGUAGE RADIO TRAFFIC, 
COMMENTING THAT \"THE BIG SHOTS LIKE TO TALK AT NIGHT.\" 
HE SUGGESTED WATCHING HOTELS IN DJIBOUTI, SAYING THE 
FUNDAMENTALISTS TEND TO CONGREGATE THERE.  HE ADDED THAT 
AL\'ITTIHAD MEMBERS OFTEN CHEW CHAT AND TEND TO TALK 
OPENLY OF THEIR ACTIVITIES WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE. 
FINALLY, JAMA SAID THE ETHIOPIA GOVERNMENT MUST OFFER 
DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO COUNTERBALANCE THE MESSAGE 
OF THE EXTREMISTS, AND THE LARGELY TIGRAYAN LEADERS IN 
ADDIS ABABA MUST EDUCATE THEMSELVES ABOUT THE SOMALI 
NATIONAL STATE. 
 
-------- 
BIO DATA 
-------- 
 
13.  (C)  RETIRED GENERAL JAMA, 51, IS AN ETHNIC SOMALI 
FROM THE DAROOD CLAN.  JAMA SAID HE SERVED AS A 
BATTALION, BRIGADE, AND DIVISION COMMANDER DURING HIS 29- 
YEAR CAREER IN THE SOMALI ARMY.  THE GENERAL PROMISED TO 
PROVIDE HIS CURRICULUM VITAE TO POLOFF SOON (SEPTEL). 
POL/ECON OAU OFFICER MET GENERAL JAMA DURING GENERAL 
SCHWARZKOPF\'S VISIT TO MOGADISHU IN 1989.  HE REMEMBERS 
HIM AS HAVING A RELATIVELY GOOD PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION, 
BUT BEING OVERSHADOWED BY MORE FLAMBOYANT AND RUTHLESS 
COLLEAGUES SUCH AS \"MORGAN.\" 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
14. (C)  OUR SOMALI CONTACTS WERE QUITE NERVOUS AND 
AFRAID THAT AL\'ITTIHAD AGENTS MIGHT BE FOLLOWING THE 
GENERAL.  THE MEETING WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED AS A LUNCH 
HOSTED BY THE DATT BUT, ALTHOUGH THE RESTAURANT WAS 
EMPTY, THE SOMALIS REFUSED TO DISCUSS BUSINESS THERE AND 
INSISTED THAT WE ADJOURN TO A PRIVATE HOME.  THEY ALSO 
INSISTED THAT THE AMERICANS DEPART FIRST TO THE FOLLOW-ON 
MEETING.  WE LEFT THE RESTAURANT AND RECONVENED LATER IN 
DR. FARAH\'S HOME.  ONCE THERE, THEY SAID THEY HAD TO BE 
VERY CAREFUL \"BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS WATCHING.\" 
 
15.  (C)  CLEARLY NONE OF THE SOMALIS FEARED BEING SEEN 
BY ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES.  ALL OF THEM SAID THAT THE 
FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA OFFERS THE BEST 
HOPE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOMALI REGION.  THEY 
COMMENTED THAT THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DARED TO MEET OPENLY 
WITH AMERICANS DURING THE DERG OR EVEN UNDER EMPEROR 
HAILE SELASSIE\'S REGIME. 
 
16.  (C)  POLOFF AND DATT DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE GENERAL 
TO THINK THE U.S. WOULD COORDINATE THE EFFORT TO DEFEAT 
AL\'ITTIHAD.  WE TOLD HIM ONLY THAT WE WOULD REPORT HIS 
REQUEST TO WASHINGTON.  THE GENERAL SEEMED SATISFIED AND 
DID NOT PRESS THE ISSUE. 
 
17. (U)  ASMARA MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

SUBJECT:  ETHIOPIA:  1996 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  96 STATE 223177 
 
1. POST RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS, REFTEL, PARA 3 A-K: 
 
A. HOST GOVERNMENT PROSECUTIONS FOR 1996:  1996 WAS A 
YEAR OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT DOMESTIC TERRORIST INCIDENTS 
IN ETHIOPIA TO INCLUDE 3 HOTEL BOMBINGS, AN ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT ON A CABINET MINISTER, THE FATAL SHOOTINGS OF TWO 
FOREIGN TOURISTS, AND AN AIRCRAFT HIJACKING AND 
SUBSEQUENT CRASH.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED ARRESTS 
FOR SUSPECTS IN ALL CASES EXCEPT THE HIJACKING.  THE 
HIJACKERS WERE BELIEVED KILLED IN THE CRASH.  THE 
GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA 
(GFDRE) IS STILL PREPARING CASES AGAINST THE DETAINEES IN 
EACH OF THESE INSTANCES.  POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER 
PROSECUTIONS FOR TERRORISM DURING 1996. 
 
B. HOST GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS FOR 1996:  POST IS 
UNAWARE OF ANY SUCCESSFUL GOVERNMENT EXTRADITIONS FOR 
TERRORIST ACTS IN 1996.  THE GFDRE HAS FEW FORMAL 
EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTS.  THE HIGHEST 
PROFILE EXTRADITION EFFORT IN RECENT YEARS IS THE ONGOING 
CASE FOR THE MUBARAK ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECTS. 
EXTRADITION HAS BEEN SOUGHT FOR THE SUSPECTS FROM SUDAN 
AND THAT COUNTRY\'S NEGATIVE RESPONSE CONTRIBUTED TO A 
SEVERE DOWNTURN IN RELATIONS BETWEEN ETHIOPIA AND SUDAN. 
IN LATE 1995 INTO 1996, THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO EXTRADITE 
FROM UGANDA A SUSPECT IN THE ATTEMPTED SHOOTING OF A 
USAID EMPLOYEE IN 1994.  UGANDAN AND ETHIOPIAN 
AUTHORITIES, COMMUNICATING THROUGH THEIR INTERPOL 
OFFICES, ATTEMPTED TO WORK OUT AN INFORMAL EXTRADITION. 
BECAUSE OF SEVERAL DELAYS ON BOTH SIDES IN EXCHANGING 
INFORMATION, THE SUSPECT WAS CHARGED WITH LOCAL CRIMES IN 
UGANDA, PAID A FINE AND WAS RELEASED.  THE GFDRE 
INITIATED EXTRADITION DIALOGUE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
COMOROS ISLANDS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ETHIOPIAN 
AIRLINES FLT 961 INCIDENT.  HOWEVER, THE IDENTIFICATION 
OF THE DEAD HIJACKERS NEGATED THE NEED TO CONTINUE. 
 
C. IMPEDIMENTS TO PROSECUTIONS/EXTRADITIONS:  CURRENT 
ETHIOPIAN LAWS DO NOT ADDRESS TERRORIST ACTS 
SPECIFICALLY.  THE LACK OF EXTRADITION TREATIES WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., IS THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO PURSUIT OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORIST ISSUES. 
 
D. OTHER HOST GOVERNMENT RESPONSES:  THE ETHIOPIAN 
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN QUICK TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS, BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL. 
 
E. MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS FOR 1996:  GFDRE 
AUTHORITIES HAVE CONDUCTED SEVERAL RAIDS ON SUSPECTED 
TERRORIST LOCATIONS IN ADDIS ABABA AND OTHER AREAS.  IN 
NOVEMBER 1996, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY FORCES CROSSED INTO 
SOMALIA NEAR DOLO TO NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT FROM WHAT THE 
GFDRE DESCRIBED AS A SUSPECTED TERRORIST TRAINING SITE 
INSIDE SOMALIA FOR THE ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP AL- 
ITIHAAD.  THE GDFRE FORCES THEN RETURNED TO THE BORDER TO 
PROTECT THE BORDER CROSSING.  IN EARLY DECEMBER, 
ETHIOPIAN SECURITY FORCES RAIDED SEVERAL LOCATIONS IN 
DIRE DAWA, NAZARETH AND ADDIS ABABA, MAKING NUMEROUS 
ARRESTS AND SEIZING AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY OF WEAPONS AND 
EXPLOSIVES.  GFDRE AUTHORITIES IDENTIFIED THE LOCATIONS 
AS CELLS FOR THE AL-ITIHAAD GROUP AND CLAIM THAT THE 
CELLS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BOMBINGS AND ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPTS IN ETHIOPIA DURING 1996.  THE ETHIOPIAN 
AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO SOUGHT TRAINING AND EXPERTISE FROM 
SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING THE U.S., TO HELP WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR TERRORISM DETECTION, RESPONSE, AND 
INVESTIGATIVE CAPABILITY. 
 
F. SIGNIFICANT HOST GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM: 
SINCE THE DOWNFALL OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT IN 1991, 
THE TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA AND THE CURRENT 
GFDRE HAVE BEEN STAUNCH OPPONENTS OF ALL FORMS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
G. HOST GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM: 
THE GFDRE HAS MADE NO STATEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
H. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ATTITUDE 1995 TO 1996:  THE 
GFDRE PREVIOUSLY MAINTAINED THE POSTURE THAT TERRORIST 
INCIDENTS WERE NOT AN ISSUE IN ETHIOPIA.  THE MUBARAK 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN 1995 AND INCIDENTS WHICH 
OCCURRED IN 1996, TO INCLUDE THE MAJOR ONES MENTIONED IN 
THIS REPORT, HAVE FOCUSSED GFDRE ATTENTION ON THE 
PROBLEM.  THERE HAS BEEN A RECOGNITION THAT TERROR 
INCIDENTS CAN BE DIRECTED AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT 
THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP A CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND 
COMBAT THE PROBLEM. 
 
I. U.S. COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS/INITIATIVES:  THE USG 
HAS NOT HAD A NEED TO REQUEST SPECIFIC ACTION BY THE 
ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  THE USG 
PROVIDED COUNTERTERRORISM TRAINING TO ETHIOPIAN 
AUTHORITIES IN 1995 AND 1996 ON A LIMITED BASIS.  THE 
RISE IN SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS IN 1996 PROMPTED THE 
EMBASSY TO SEEK ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO ADDRESS THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE GFDRE ABILITY TO DETECT, DETER, AND 
RESPOND. 
 
J. U.S. GOVERNMENT REQUESTS FOR COOPERATION, LAST 5 
YEARS:  THE USG HAS NOT HAD THE NEED TO FORMALLY SEEK 
COOPERATION. 
 
   I) COOPERATION IN LEGAL PURSUIT OF SUSPECTS: 
COOPERATION HERE HAS BEEN GOOD ON BOTH THE DIPLOMATIC AND 
OPERATIONAL LEVEL.  HOWEVER, THE LACK OF LAWS AND 
TREATIES HAS HAMPERED THE COOPERATIVE PROCESS.  THE 
ACTUAL NUMBER OF REQUESTS HAS BEEN LOW. 
 
  II) COOPERATION IN PREVENTING FUTURE ATTACKS:  THE 
GFDRE HAS SHOWN A WILLINGNESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO 
PROVIDE COOPERATION, WITHIN THEIR CAPABILITIES, FOR 
POSSIBLE FUTURE ATTACKS AGAINST US PERSONNEL WITHIN 
ETHIOPIA. 
 
K. EXTENT OF COOPERATION FOR PREVENTION OF ATTACKS, LAST 
5 YEARS:  THE USG HAS NOT HAD THE NEED TO REQUEST 
COOPERATION FROM ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES IN THE PREVENTION 
OF A SPECIFIC ACT OF TERRORISM DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS.

SUMMARY 
------- 
 
2.  (C)  FEW ISSUES ARE OF GREATER LONG-TERM CONCERN TO 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
ETHIOPIA (GFDRE) THAN THE THREAT OF MILITANT POLITICAL 
ISLAM.  AT PRESENT THE GFDRE FACES LITTLE INTERNAL THREAT 
FROM ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUPS, BUT SPORADIC VIOLENCE 
BETWEEN GOVERNMENT FORCES AND ISLAMIC MILITANTS HAS TAKEN 
PLACE ALONG THE BORDER WITH SOMALIA, AND ISLAMIC 
EXTREMISTS ARE BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR A SERIES OF 
RECENT HOTEL BOMBINGS AND AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON AN 
ETHNIC SOMALI MINISTER.  ALTHOUGH THE 1994 CONSTITUTION 
GUARANTEES FREEDOM OF RELIGION, AND THIS IS RESPECTED IN 
PRACTICE, PAST REGIMES SUBSIDIZED THE CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN 
ORTHODOX CHURCH WHILE MUSLIM INSTITUTIONS ATROPHIED.  THE 
GFDRE IS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH 
MUSLIMS AND TO ASSIST THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL (SIC), 
THE ONLY GRASSROOTS ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION WITH NATIONAL 
SCOPE.  MUSLIMS ARE PLEASED WITH THE RELIGIOUS POLICIES 
OF THE GFDRE, BUT ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY IS IN 
DISARRAY AND STRUGGLING TO REORGANIZE.  HAVING SAID THIS, 
THE NUMBER OF ADHERENTS TO ISLAM IS GROWING FAST AND 
MUSLIMS MAY SOON OUTNUMBER THE SLOW GROWING AND 
CONSERVATIVE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  THIS CABLE 
FULFILLS A REQUIREMENT OF THE POST REPORTING PLAN. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
REVAMPED ISLAMIC COUNCIL OCCUPIES NEW OFFICES 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (C) POLOFF AND POL/ECON FSN MET WITH SENIOR OFFICERS 
OF THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL (SIC) IN THEIR NEW OFFICE 
ON 20 MARCH.  THE SIC MOVED IN LATE 1996 FROM CRAMPED 
OFFICES NEAR THE GRAND MOSQUE IN THE DENSELY POPULATED 
MARKET DISTRICT TO MORE SPACIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS SEVERAL 
KILOMETERS AWAY.  THE COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1974 BY 
THE FORMER DERG REGIME, FOLLOWING LARGE ISLAMIC 
DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST THE HAILE SELASSIE GOVERNMENT. 
MUSLIM LEADERS SEE THEIR ROLE AS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE 
GFDRE AND ETHIOPIA\'S LARGE MUSLIM COMMUNITY.  MUSLIMS 
CONSTITUTE MORE THAN 40 PERCENT OF ETHIOPIA\'S POPULATION 
OF AT LEAST 56 MILLION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
FORMER SIC LEADERSHIP DISMISSED FOR CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
4.  (C)  ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL IS THE ONLY GRASSROOTS 
ISLAMIC ORGANIZATION WITH NATIONAL SCOPE, COUNCIL LEADERS 
ARE STRUGGLING TO REORGANIZE AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT AND 
CORRUPTION.  THE SIC WAS RESTRUCTURED IN 1992 AND WAS 
REVAMPED AGAIN IN OCTOBER, 1996, FOLLOWING THE ARREST AND 
IMPRISONMENT OF NEARLY ALL TOP SIC OFFICIALS FOR 
CORRUPTION.  OF THE SIC LEADERS KNOWN TO THE EMBASSY IN 
1994 (REF A), ONLY GENERAL SECRETARY ABDURAZAK MOHAMMED 
REMAINS WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. 
 
5.  (C)  THE NEW COUNCIL IS MORE STREAMLINED AND PROVIDES 
FOR EQUAL REPRESENTATION FOR ALL OF ETHIOPIA\'S FEDERAL 
STATES.  THE COUNCIL CONSISTS OF 121 MEMBERS.  EACH STATE 
HAS 11 MEMBERS WHILE THE MORE POPULOUS OROMIYA REGIONAL 
STATE HAS 12.  THE GROUP\'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS 
THIRTEEN MEMBERS.  THE FORMER CHAIRMAN, HAJI MOHAMMED 
AHMED AMAN, DIED IN LATE 1996 AND WILL NOT BE REPLACED 
UNTIL THE PLANNED JUNE 1997 SIC CONFERENCE.  THE COUNCIL 
HAS ALSO ELIMINATED THE POSITION OF SECOND VICE-CHAIRMAN 
AND DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MOST AFFILIATED ISLAMIC ORGANIZATIONS IN LIMBO 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
6.  (C)  PREVIOUSLY THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL WAS AN 
UMBRELLA ORGANIZATION WITH SEVERAL AFFILIATED ISLAMIC 
GROUPS (REF A), BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS ACCUSED THE FORMER 
LEADERSHIP OF USING THE VARIOUS GROUPS TO MISAPPROPRIATE 
FUNDS AND THE AFFILIATED GROUPS HAVE FALLEN INTO 
DISARRAY.  THE ETHIOPIAN KORANIC ORGANIZATION STILL 
EXISTS ON PAPER, BUT IS INACTIVE.  THE ETHIOPIAN ULEMA 
(MUSLIM CLERICS) ARE EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS WITH FORMAL 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.  THE ULEMA DEAL WITH ALL RELIGIOUS 
ISSUES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL.  THE COUNCIL IS IN 
THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING THE ULEMA SYSTEM WITH THE 
GOAL OF PUTTING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN POSITIONS 
NATIONWIDE TO TEACH THE TRUE FAITH TO BELIEVERS.  THE SIC 
HOPES TO HOLD ELECTIONS TO SELECT ULEMAS PRIOR TO THE 
GROUP\'S JUNE CONFERENCE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
DISPUTES AMONG MUSLIM FACTIONS SAID TO BE RESOLVED 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
7.  (C)  MUSLIM LEADERS INSISTED THAT TENSIONS BETWEEN 
ETHIOPIA\'S SHAFI AND WAHABBI MUSLIMS HAVE SUBSIDED.  THE 
EMBASSY REPORTED IN 1994 THAT THE TWO GROUPS CLASHED 
VIOLENTLY ON MUSLIM HOLIDAYS IN THREE CITIES NATIONWIDE. 
COUNCIL LEADERS REPLIED THAT ALL ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS ARE 
SUNNIS AND THAT INTERNAL DIFFERENCES ARE MINOR.  SIC 
LEADERS EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT THE EMBASSY HAD EVEN 
HEARD OF THE EARLIER DISPUTE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SOME OVERLAP BETWEEN THE SIC AND SHARIA COURTS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
8.  (C)  THE COUNCIL AND THE SHARIA COURTS ARE TWO 
SEPARATE INSTITUTIONS, ALTHOUGH THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES 
OCCASIONALLY OVERLAP.  THE SHARIA COURTS WERE ORIGINALLY 
ESTABLISHED UNDER HAILE SELASSIE AND WERE EMPOWERED TO 
OVERSEE ISLAMIC ISSUES CONCERNING MARRIAGE, DIVORCE, 
WILLS AND TESTAMENTS, AND THE CARE AND GUARDIANSHIP OF 
MINOR CHILDREN.  THE 1994 CONSTITUTION REAFFIRMS THESE 
RIGHTS.  BECAUSE THE COUNCIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS 
ISSUES, THE LEADERS TOLD POLOFF THEIR ROLE IS TO ENSURE 
THAT ONLY QUALIFIED MEMBERS SERVE ON THE COURTS. 
 
9.  (C)  ISLAMIC LEADERS HOPE TO REBUILD THE SHARIA COURT 
SYSTEM.  THEY ALLEGE THAT UNDER THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL 
LEADERSHIP SHARIA COURT JUDGES, WHO HOLD OFFICE FOR LIFE, 
WERE SELECTED BASED ON NEPOTISM AND BRIBERY, RATHER THAN 
FOR THEIR RELIGIOUS EXPERTISE.  AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER 
OF SHARIA COURTS DWINDLED AND THEIR ROLE IN ETHIOPIAN 
MUSLIM SOCIETY DIMINISHED ACCORDINGLY.  COUNCIL LEADERS 
HOPE TO CREATE A FUNCTIONING SHARIA COURT IN EVERY 
DISTRICT IN ETHIOPIA (COMMENT.  THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX 
HUNDRED DISTRICTS NATIONWIDE.  END COMMENT.) 
 
------------------------------ 
GFDRE IS FUNDING SHARIA COURTS 
------------------------------ 
 
10.  (C)  USING THE AMHARA REGIONAL STATE AS AN EXAMPLE, 
THE MUSLIM LEADERS SAID THEY HAVE PETITIONED THE REGIONAL 
GOVERNMENT THERE FOR MONEY TO HIRE 118 SHARIA COURT 
JUDGES.  SELECTION IS BASED ON A RIGOROUS WRITTEN 
NATIONAL EXAMINATION.  FIFTY HAVE ASSUMED OFFICE AND THE 
COUNCIL EXPECTS THE REMAINDER TO BE HIRED AFTER THE 
BEGINNING OF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR IN JULY.  ASKED WHY A 
SECULAR GOVERNMENT IS PAYING FOR RELIGIOUS JUDGES, THE 
LEADERS REPLIED THAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION SHARIA COURTS 
PROVIDE A JUDICIAL SERVICE AND ARE DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE 
TO THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE.  (COMMENT:  SHARIA COURTS 
HAVE JURISDICTION ONLY IN SPECIFIED FAMILY DISPUTES 
BETWEEN MUSLIMS, AND CAN ONLY BE EMPLOYED WITH THE 
CONSENT OF BOTH PARTIES.  END COMMENT.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
MUSLIM LEADERS BELIEVE PROPERTY WILL BE RETURNED 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
11.  (C)  THE SUPREME ISLAMIC COUNCIL IS WORKING CLOSELY 
WITH ETHIOPIAN FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO RECOVER PROPERTY 
SEIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN DECADES PAST.  ALTHOUGH 
OFFICIALS OF THE DERG REGIME PERMITTED THE SIC TO FILE TO 
RECOVER LAND AND PROPERTY TAKEN AROUND ADDIS ABABA\'S 
GRAND MOSQUE, THE APPLICATIONS SAT FOR TEN YEARS WITHOUT 
RESULT.  THE KEY PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO COUNCIL LEADERS, 
WAS A TOTAL LACK OF RECORDS.  OVER THE PAST YEAR, 
HOWEVER, THE GROUP HAS WORKED WITH THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
OFFICE AND THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, TO INTERVIEW 
LOCAL RESIDENTS TO ESTABLISH PROPERTY RIGHTS.  A JOINT 
COMMITTEE REPORT IS IMMINENT AND THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY 
EXPECTS TO RECOVER SOME OF ITS FORMER PROPERTY SOON. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
ONLY LIMITED CONTACT WITH INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM COMMUNITY 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
12.  (C)  POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE SUPREME COUNCIL\'S 
CONTACTS WITH VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM GROUPS.  THE 
MUSLIM LEADERS SAID THEY HAVE HAD LIMITED CONTACT WITH 
THE MUSLIM WORLD LEAGUE.  THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK 
RECENTLY OFFERED TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS OF 
ENGINEERING, MEDICINE, AND AGRICULTURE.  NEVERTHELESS, 
THE MUSLIM LEADERS INSISTED THAT THEIR FIRST PRIORITY HAS 
BEEN TO CREATE INTERNAL LINKS TO ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS. 
EXPANDING CONTACTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY IS A SECONDARY GOAL. 
 
13.  (C)  SOME MONEY IS ARRIVING FROM ABROAD.  THE NUMBER 
OF MOSQUES IN ETHIOPIA DOUBLED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, 
FUNDED IN LARGE PART BY PRIVATE MONEY FROM SAUDI ARABIA 
(REF E).  PRIVATE SAUDI BUSINESSMAN MOHAMMED AL-AMOUDI 
HAS BUILT SEVERAL MOSQUES AND KORANIC SCHOOLS, INCLUDING 
A NEW COMPLEX IN THE AFAR REGIONAL STATE.  WHEN 
AMBASSADOR ASKED LOCAL RESIDENTS IN HOSAINA, A ZONAL 
CAPITAL IN THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE\'S REGION, WHO WAS 
FINANCING CONSTRUCTION OF A HUGE, NEW MOSQUE, THE LOCALS 
PROFESSED NOT TO KNOW.  THE EMBASSY HAS NO REPORTS OF 
LIBYAN INVOLVEMENT IN ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM AFFAIRS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
MUSLIM RELATIONS WITH CHRISTIANS ARE GENERALLY HARMONIOUS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
14.  (C)  ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM COMMUNITY HAS HISTORICALLY 
FELT MARGINALIZED AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY RULING 
CHRISTIAN GOVERNMENTS.  PREVIOUS ETHIOPIAN REGIMES 
SUBSIDIZED THE CHRISTIAN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH, WHICH 
CLAIMS MEMBERSHIP OF ROUGHLY HALF OF ETHIOPIA\'S 
POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH TENSIONS OCCASIONALLY FLARE UP 
BETWEEN CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS, THE COUNCIL ASSURED 
EMBASSY OFFICERS THAT THE TWO COMMUNITIES LIVE IN 
PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE.  THE PATRIARCH OF THE ORTHODOX 
CHURCH HAS AGREED WITH THAT ASSESSMENT, WITH THE SOLE 
EXCEPTION OF ADDIS ABABA, WHERE THE CRUSH OF URBAN LIFE 
SOMETIMES BRINGS THE TWO GROUPS INTO CONFLICT (REF C). 
CHRISTIAN ELDERS IN THE AMHARA REGIONAL STATE ECHOED THE 
COMMENTS OF THE COUNCIL LEADERS.  THEY TOLD THE 
AMBASSADOR IN FEBRUARY THAT MEMBERS OF BOTH RELIGIONS 
HAVE LIVED PEACEFULLY FOR CENTURIES AND HAVE EVOLVED 
MECHANISMS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.  INTERMARRIAGE IS NOT 
UNCOMMON AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND FAMILIES WITH 
PRACTICING CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS UNDER THE SAME ROOF. 
NEVERTHELESS, ORTHODOX CHRISTIAN ELDERS REPORTED MINOR 
QUARRELS, BUT NO SERIOUS VIOLENCE, OVER THE AGGRESSIVE 
EVANGELICAL TACTICS OF TWO NEW ARRIVALS:  JEHOVAH\'S 
WITNESSES AND PENTACOSTALS (REF D).  DURING THE 
AMBASSADOR\'S EXTENSIVE TRAVELS IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS, 
HE USUALLY ASKS CHRISTIANS AND MUSLIMS ALIKE ABOUT 
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.  THE VERDICT IS 
UNANIMOUS; THEY GET ALONG TOGETHER FINE AND THE CURRENT 
GOVERNMENT IS TOLERANT OF BOTH GROUPS. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
SIC:  NO PLACE FOR AL-ITTIHAD IN ETHIOPIA 
----------------------------------------- 
 
15.  (C)  COUNCIL MEMBERS DENOUNCED THE MILITANT 
FUNDAMENTALIST GROUP, AL-ITTIHAD, AND PREDICTED THE GROUP 
WOULD WIN FEW SUPPORTERS AMONG ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM 
POPULATION.  THE LEADERS REMINDED US THAT THEY WENT ON 
TELEVISION IN JANUARY AND CONDEMNED ALL TERRORIST ACTS. 
COUNCIL LEADERS CONTENDED THAT SINCE THE MAJORITY OF 
ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS BELIEVE THAT THEIR RELIGIOUS RIGHTS ARE 
PROTECTED UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION, THE EXTREMIST 
MESSAGE HAS LITTLE APPEAL.  THE LEADERS ALSO ACCUSED AL- 
ITTIHAD OF MISINTERPRETING THE KORAN AND PREYING ON 
IGNORANT MUSLIMS WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR RELIGION. 
THE GROWING PRESENCE OF TRAINED ULEMAS WILL UNDERMINE AL- 
ITTIHAD\'S EXTREMIST MESSAGE, THEY BELIEVE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
PM MELES SAYS AL-ITTIHAD A TROJAN HORSE FOR TERRORISTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
16.  (C)  PRIME MINISTER MELES ZENAWI HAS A LESS SANGUINE 
VIEW OF THE MILITANT FUNDAMENTALISTS.  HE HAS FREQUENTLY 
STATED THAT A STATELESS SOMALIA POSES THE GREATEST LONG- 
TERM SECURITY THREAT TO ETHIOPIA AND TO THE STABILITY OF 
THE REGION.  MELES FEARS THAT SOMALIA MAY BECOME A BASE 
AND SAFE HAVEN FOR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS, CRIMINALS, 
AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS, ESPECIALLY AS THE WELCOME MAT FOR 
SUCH GROUPS IS WITHDRAWN FROM MORE TRADITIONAL LOCATIONS. 
THE PRIME MINISTER HAS WARNED THAT AL-ITTIHAD HAS BECOME 
\"A TROJAN HORSE FOR ALL TYPES OF TERRORIST GROUPS\" AND 
THAT \"SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE UNDERESTIMATING AL-ITTIHAD 
BECAUSE THEY VIEW IT AS A PURELY SOMALI ENDEAVOR.\" 
 
17.  (C)  THE PRIME MINISTER BELIEVES THAT AL-ITTIHAD 
DRAWS SUPPORT FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT IS THE 
ONLY ORGANIZED GROUP IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE NEEDED 
GOODS AND SERVICES IN REMOTE DESTITUTE AREAS.  THE 
EXTREMISTS RECEIVE FINANCIAL AND OTHER SUPPORT FROM IRAN, 
IRAQ, SUDAN, LIBYA, AND PRIVATE DONORS IN SEVERAL GULF 
STATES.  TO COUNTER THE EXTREMISTS, MELES WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE THE CREATION OF A FIREWALL ALONG THE ETHIO-SOMALI 
BORDER THROUGH THE PROVISION OF CROSS-BORDER HUMANITARIAN 
ASSISTANCE TO TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC GROUPS INSIDE SOMALIA. 
THE ETHIOPIAN MILITARY CONDUCTS AGGRESSIVE PATROLLING TO 
COUNTER AL-ITTIHAD\'S LIMITED MILITARY ACTIVITIES 
THROUGHOUT THE SOMALI REGIONAL STATE. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
GFDRE FOCUSED ON STABILITY IN SOMALIA AND SOMALI REGION 
OF ETHIOPIA 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
18.  (C)  VIRTUALLY ALL SOMALIS ARE MUSLIM.  THE GFDRE 
HAS DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT SCARCE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS 
SOMALI ISSUES.  THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MOVED QUICKLY TO 
MOBILIZE DONORS TO ASSESS THE SOMALI REGION\'S 
HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN RESPONSE TO REPORTS OF DROUGHT 
AND FAMINE THERE.  IN RESPONSE TO THE ONGOING INSTABILITY 
IN SOMALIA, ETHIOPIA HOSTED THE SODERE PEACE AND 
DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE THAT ATTRACTED 26 SOMALI POLITICAL 
FACTIONS, AND THE GFDRE HAS EMBARKED ON A MAJOR 
DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO OBTAIN DONOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO 
SUSTAIN THE SODERE PROCESS.  SINCE EARLY 1995 THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED PEACE AND RECONCILIATION TALKS 
BETWEEN FEUDING ETHIO-SOMALI CLANS.  TO REINFORCE ITS 
NEUTRALITY, THE EPRDF HAS PUT OFF AN APPLICATION FOR 
MEMBERSHIP BY THE ETHIOPIAN SOMALI DEMOCRATIC LEAGUE 
WHICH NOW RUNS THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
OTHER MILITANT ISLAMIC GROUPS INACTIVE 
-------------------------------------- 
 
19.  (C)  OTHER DOMESTIC RADICAL ISLAMIC GROUPS HAVE 
SLIPPED INTO OBSCURITY.  THE ISLAMIC FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF OROMIYA, IN THE EARLY 1990\'S THE MOST 
ACTIVE ETHIOPIAN ISLAMIC RADICAL GROUP, HAS FADED FROM 
THE SCENE.  THE MILITANT WING OF THE OGADEN NATIONAL 
LIBERATION FRONT HAS CONFINED ITS ACTIVITIES TO 
PERIODICALLY APPEALING FOR FUNDS FROM SAFE POSITIONS IN 
EXILE AND FORWARDING PROTEST LETTERS TO WESTERN EMBASSIES 
IN THE REGION. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MUSLIM \"MAN-ON-THE-STREET\" GENERALLY SATISFIED 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
20.  (C)  DESPITE OCCASIONAL CRITICISM OF SELECT 
INDIVIDUALS IN GOVERNMENT, THE EMBASSY\'S MUSLIM CONTACTS 
ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY INSIST THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN 
THE GFDRE AND REPORT THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATION ARE 
OPEN.  EVEN IN THE UNDERDEVELOPED SOMALI STATE, WHERE 
CITIZENS ARE FRUSTRATED WITH AN INEFFECTIVE AND PROBABLY 
CORRUPT REGIONAL ADMINISTRATION, MOST CITIZENS BLAME THE 
REGIONAL PRESIDENT - NOT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES - FOR THE 
LACK OF DEVELOPMENT.  MOST EXPECT FEDERAL AUTHORITIES TO 
INTERVENE TO ASSIST THE REGION AND MANY PRAISE THE GFDRE 
FOR SENDING TRAINING TEAMS TO THE REGION AND FOR INVITING 
THE REGION\'S ADMINISTRATORS TO VISIT OTHER REGIONAL 
STATES TO OBSERVE AND LEARN. 
 
21.  (C)  THE ATTITUDE OF MUSLIMS IN THE AFAR REGION IS 
POSITIVE.  MUSLIM ELDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
IN THE AFAR REGIONAL STATE RECENTLY EXPRESSED THEIR 
SATISFACTION TO US WITH THE GFDRE POLICIES OF 
DECENTRALIZATION AND REGIONALIZATION.  WITH THE CREATION 
OF THE AFAR STATE IN 1995, MUSLIM AFARS FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN ETHIOPIAN HISTORY FEEL THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR OWN 
DESTINY WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM CHRISTIAN HIGHLANDERS. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
ISLAM GROWNG FASTER THAN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOXY? 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
22. (C)  WE ARE HEARING ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THAT THE 
GROWTH OF ISLAM IN ETHIOPIA MAY BE OUTPACING THAT OF 
NEW ADHERENTS TO THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH.  IN 
FACT, MOST MUSLIMS TODAY DISPUTE THE CONVENTIONAL 
WISDOM THAT 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS MOSLEM AND 
50 PERCENT ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX WITH THE REMAINING 10 
PERCENT PROTESTANT, CATHOLIC AND ANIMIST.  THE PAPAL 
NUNCIO HAS TAKEN A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE ETHIOPIAN 
ORTHODOX CHURCH AND HAS HAD A NUMBER OF FRANK 
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CHURCH HIERARCHY.  ETHIOPIAN 
ORTHODOXY IS WELL KNOWN FOR ITS CONSERVATISM AND LACK 
OF PROGRESSIVE IDEAS.  MOST OF THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP 
ALSO FALLS INTO THIS CATEGORY.  THOSE FEW WHO WOULD 
LIKE TO MODERNIZE THE CHURCH HAVE CONFIDED TO THE PAPAL 
NUNCIO THAT THE CHURCH IS HAVING GREAT DIFFICULTY 
OBTAINING THE ALLEGIANCE OF YOUNG ETHIOPIANS.  AT THE 
SAME TIME, THERE IS STRONG RESISTANCE WITHIN THE CHURCH 
TO MODERNIZE.  THE MORE ENLIGHTENED LEADERS FEAR THIS 
IS GOING TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY THE STATISTICAL 
BREAKDOWN BETWEEN ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX AND MUSLIMS IN THE 
COMING YEARS. 
 
23. (C)  WHILE THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH MAY WELL 
BE FACING VERY SLOW GROWTH, WE SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT IS 
THE CASE FOR THE MUSLIM POPULATION.  ALTHOUGH 
STATISTICS ARE LACKING, THE NUMBER OF NEW MOSQUES UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION AND INFORMATION BASED ON OUR TRAVEL AROUND 
THE COUNTRY SUGGEST THAT ISLAM IS ADDING TO ITS NUMBERS 
WITH EASE.  WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT PROTESTANT GROUPS, 
PARTICULARLY THE MODERATE EVANGELICAL MEKANE YESUS AND 
PENTECOSTALS ARE ALSO GROWING RAPIDLY.  BUT THEIR 
GROWTH COMES FROM A MUCH SMALLER BASE, PARTICULARLY THE 
PENTECOSTALS.  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SITUATION FOR 
THE FUTURE IS CLEAR.  SHOULD MUSLIMS BECOME IN THE NOT 
DISTANT FUTURE A MAJORITY, WHICH IS A REAL POSSIBILITY, 
IT WILL EVENTUALLY CHANGE THE POLITICAL DYNAMIC OF 
ETHIOPIA.  BECAUSE THE MUSLIMS ARE POLITICALLY DIVIDED 
AND TEND TO RESIDE IN THE PERIPHERY AS OPPOSED TO THE 
HIGHLANDS OF ETHIOPIA, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ISLAMIC 
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP ANYTIME SOON.  BUT WE DO NEED TO 
BE ALERT TO THE CHANGING DYNAMIC HERE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
24.  (C)  ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIMS NOW ENJOY BETTER TREATMENT 
THAN AT ANY TIME IN THEIR LENGTHY HISTORY, THIS DESPITE 
THE GFDRE\'S DEEP CONCERN OVER THE SPREAD OF MUSLIM 
EXTREMISM WHICH, IT BELIEVES, IS SUPPORTED BY RADICAL 
ELEMENTS IN KHARTOUM AND BY WEALTHY PRIVATE INTERESTS IN 
THE GULF STATES. 
 
25.  (C)  THE GFDRE APPEARS DETERMINED TO UNDERMINE THE 
THREAT OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISM BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
MAINSTREAM MUSLIMS AND BY CLOSELY MONITORING RADICAL 
GROUPS IN NEIGHBORING SOMALIA AND SUDAN.  NO MILITANT 
GROUP POSES A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE GFDRE AT THIS 
TIME, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL ARE CAPABLE OF ISOLATED TERRORIST 
ATTACKS.  NEVERTHELESS, AS LONG AS AL-ITTIHAD RECEIVES 
OUTSIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND ENJOYS SAFE HAVENS IN 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, THE ETHIOPIAN MILITARY CANNOT 
COMPLETELY DEFEAT THE EXTREMISTS.  SIMILARLY, UNTIL 
FUNDAMENTAL POWER-SHARING ISSUES ARE RESOLVED AMONG 
COMPETING ETHIO-SOMALI CLANS, THE EXTREMISTS WILL BE ABLE 
TO CAPITALIZE ON ANY RESULTING DISSATISFACTION. 
 
26.  (C)  THE RADICAL ISLAMIC MESSAGE HAS LITTLE APPEAL 
FOR MOST ETHIOPIAN MUSLIMS.  ONLY IN PERIPHERAL AREAS 
WHERE THE FLEDGING REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE YET TO MAKE 
AN IMPACT ON THE OFTEN DESPERATE POPULATION ARE THE 
EXTREMISTS MAKING LIMITED HEADWAY.  HUNGRY AND THIRSTY 
PEOPLE ACT TO SURVIVE, RARELY OUT OF TRUE DEDICATION TO 
THE MILITANT CAUSE.  NEITHER AL-ITTIHAD NOR OTHER 
MILITANT GROUPS SUCH AS THE ISLAMIC FRONT FOR THE 
LIBERATION OF OROMIA HAVE ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT POPULAR 
SUPPORT. 
 
27.  (C)  THE NEW SIC IS BUSILY TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR 
YEARS OF NEGLECT AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO THE 
ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THEY ARE PLEASED WITH 
RELATIONS WITH THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT AND ARE ENJOYING 
THEIR NEW-FOUND FREEDOM TO PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION 
WITHOUT INTERFERENCE, BUT ARE HAMPERED BY A LACK OF MONEY 
AND A SERIOUSLY DETERIORATED MUSLIM INFRASTRUCTURE. 
 
28.  (C)  AFTER HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF LIVING TOGETHER IN 
RELATIVE ISOLATION, THERE ARE FEW BURNING ISSUES THAT 
DIVIDE ETHIOPIA\'S MUSLIM AND CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AND 
FEWER STILL THAT ARE LIKELY TO PROVOKE VIOLENT CLASHES 
BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS.

CLASSIFIED BY DCM MARTIN G. BRENNAN.  REASONS: 1.5(B), 
(C) AND (D) 
 
1. (S)  EMBASSY APPRECIATES THE DEPARTMENT\'S RESPONSE 
(REF B) TO OUR QUERY AS TO WHY AL\'ITTIHAD AL ISLAMIA 
WAS NOT DESIGNATED A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. 
THE DEPARTMENT NOTED THE THREE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION 
OF A TERRORIST GROUP: A FOREIGN ORGANIZATION THAT 
ENGAGES IN TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND THREATENS THE 
SECURITY OF UNITED STATES NATIONALS OR THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES. 
 
2.  (S)  WE BELIEVE THAT AL\'ITTIHAD MEETS THESE 
CRITERIA AND SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED FOR 
DESIGNATION AS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.  AL\'ITTIHAD 
HAS ESTABLISHED AN EXTENSIVE RECORD OF TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES IN ETHIOPIA.  ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES HAVE 
CREDIBLY IMPLICATED AL\'ITTIHAD IN THE JANUARY 1996 
BOMBING OF THE GHION HOTEL, THE JULY 1996 ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT AGAINST MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND 
COMMUNICATIONS ABDUL-MEJID AND THE AUGUST 1996 BOMBING 
OF THE WABE SHEBELLE HOTEL IN ADDIS ABABA.  THESE 
INCIDENTS RESULTED IN INDIVIDUALS KILLED AND WOUNDED 
INCLUDING FOREIGNERS.  INDEED, FOREIGNERS FREQUENT 
THOSE AREAS OF THE GHION AND WABE SHEBELLE HOTELS WHERE 
THE BOMBS WENT OFF.  THE EMBASSY HAD REASON TO SUSPECT 
THAT THE THREAT AGAINST THE LIFE OF AMBASSADOR SHINN ON 
JULY 14, 1996 (REF E) COULD HAVE BEEN LINKED TO 
AL\'ITTIHAD.  WE ALSO CALL THE DEPARTMENT\'S ATTENTION TO 
RECENT ROAL REPORTS (TD314/18683-97 AND TD314/09508-97) 
WHICH INDICATE THAT AL\'ITTIHAD WAS INVOLVED IN THE 
TRAINING/LOGISTICS OF HIT SQUADS THAT WERE TO 
INFILTRATE URBAN CENTERS OF ETHIOPIA TO ATTACK 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND FOREIGNERS. 
 
3. (S)  REPORTING FROM EMBASSY NAIROBI AS WELL AS THIS 
EMBASSY INDICATES THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS MAKING EVERY 
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE ATTEMPTS AT ACHIEVING PEACE AND A 
SEMBLANCE OF GOVERNANCE IN SOMALIA.  THERE ARE ALSO 
CREDIBLE REPORTS THAT AL\'ITTIHAD IS INVOLVED IN DRUG 
SMUGGLING TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES.  DOCUMENTS SEIZED 
BY ETHIOPIAN FORCES DURING AN AUGUST 1996 ATTACK ON  AN 
AL\'ITTIHAD BASE AT LUUQ IN SOMALIA CLEARLY INDICATE 
THAT AL\'ITTIHAD RECRUITS WERE RECEIVING TRAINING FROM 
AFGHAN ARABS AMONG OTHERS WITH LINKS TO IRAN AND SUDAN. 
AL\'ITTIHAD IS CLEARLY ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH ELEMENTS 
LINKED TO SAUDI TERRORIST USMANA BIN LADEN. 
 
4. (S)  BASED ON INDICATIONS RECEIVED TO DATE, 
AL\'ITTIHAD IS DEDICATED TO DESTABILIZING EASTERN 
ETHIOPIA AND UNDERMINING THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA AS 
WELL.  IF AL\'ITTIHAD WERE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION 
IN SOMALIA, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT IT 
WOULD EXPORT ITS BRAND OF TERRORISM AND POLITICAL ISLAM 
TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN REGION.  THIS REPRESENTS A THREAT 
TO U.S. INTERESTS IN THE REGION AND A DIRECT THREAT TO 
AMERICANS.

SUBJECT:  MELES ON NEXT STEPS:  LET THINGS EVOLVE NATURALLY 
 
CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON OFFICER JULIE B. WINN, REASON 
1.5(B,D) 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (C) PRIME MINISTER MELES TOLD CHARGE AUGUST 8 THAT 
THE U.S. STATEMENT AGAINST EXPULSIONS OF ERITREANS, 
COMBINED WITH REPORTS THAT THE U.S. TOLD ISAIAS THAT 
ETHIOPIA IS TOO FRAGILE TO COMPROMISE, REFLECT ANTI- 
ETHIOPIA BIAS WITHIN INFLUENTIAL USG CIRCLES. 
ACCORDINGLY, WE SHOULD PERHAPS BACK OFF EFFORTS TO 
PREVENT WAR, SINCE THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY DEMANDING 
THAT ISAIAS WITHDRAW FROM BADME, AND THE U.S. DOESN\'T 
HAVE THE WILL OR CAPACITY TO MAKE THAT DEMAND.  INSTEAD, 
WE SHOULD ALLOW THINGS TO EVOLVE NATURALLY AND ASSESS 
WHAT WE MIGHT DO TO PICK UP THE PIECES AFTER A WAR.  WE 
THINK MELES\' STARK APPRAISAL WAS IN PART FOR EFFECT AMID 
LINGERING CONCERNS ABOUT THE U.S. STATEMENT ON 
DEPORTATION.  WHEN PRESSED, HE MADE IF CLEAR THAT HE 
WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH ISAIAS IF THE LATTER 
DEMONSTRATED \"HE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON.\"  WHILE MELES 
WAS NOT A PARAGON OF FLEXIBILITY, WE STILL NEED TO PRESS 
AHEAD WITH PEACE INITIATIVES.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (C) CHARGE AND POLOFF CALLEO ON PRIME MINISTER MELES 
AUGUST 8, AT EMBASSY REQUEST, PRIMARILY TO DISCUSS EVENTS 
IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.  AFTER THAT 
OISCUSSION (SEPTEL), THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO THE 
ONGOING BORDER CONFLICT BETWEEN ETHIOPIA ANO ERITREA. 
 
---------------------- 
WHERE TO GO FROM HERE? 
---------------------- 
 
3.  (C) CHARGE COMMENTEO THAT MELES AND ISAIAS, WHO USED 
TO BE SOURCES OF HELPFUL EXPERTISE AND ANALYSIS IN 
REGIONAL ISSUES, ARE DISTRACTED BY THEIR OWN CONFLICT, 
AND THEIR LEADERSHIP IS SORELY MISSED.  CHARGE ASKED WHAT 
MELES MIGHT ACCEPT AS A SIGN FROM ISAIAS TO ALLOW A 
SETTLEMENT ON TECHNICAL MODALITIES TO BE FINALIZEO. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
ISAIAS IS A SADDAM WHO DOESN\'T UNDERSTAND GAME RULES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
4.  (C) RETURNING TO AN OFT-REPEATED THEME, MELES 
RESPONDED THAT THE ROOT ISSUE IS THAT ISAIAS DOES NOT 
EVEN UNDERSTANO THE \"RULES OF THE GAME\" AND IS NOT A 
RATIONAL DECISION-MAKER.  LIKE SADDAM HUSSEIN AND THE 
INVASION OF KUWAIT, ISAIAS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BACK DOWN 
NOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AT VARIANCE WITH HIS 
UNOERSTANDING OF THE REALITIES.  MELES PLACES THE 
ERITREAN INVASION IN THE CONTEST OF CONFLICTING ECONOMIC 
VISIONS.  ERITREA WAS CLEAR FROM 1991 ON THAT IT WANTED 
TO BE SINGAPORE AND WOULO NEEO THE SUPPORT OF THE 
\"HINTERLANDS\".  ETHIOPIA, NO HINTERLAND, UNDERTOOK A 
ROUTE TO ITS OWN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT STYMIED 
ERITREA\'S, AND ECONOMIC DISAGREEMENTS SIMMERED FOR SOME 
TIME.  MELES HYPOTHESIZES NOW THAT ISAIAS INVADED BADME, 
THE TRIGGER FOR THE CURRENT CONFLICT, IN PART TO WARN 
ETHIOPIA OF ERITREAN CAPABILITIES SHOULD THE GFDRE 
CONTINUE TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE ERITREAN ECONOMIC 
VISION. 
 
5.  (C) ISAIAS ASSUMED, MELES BELIEVES, THAT ETHIOPIA WAS 
MORE MILITARILY UNPREPARED THAN ERITREA ANO THAT IT WOULD 
AVOID OPEN WAR BECAUSE IT HAS BENEFITED SO MUCH FROM 
PEACE.  THIS WAS A MISCALCULATION.  WHILE ETHIOPIA WAS 
MORE UNPREPARED, IT HAD THE CORE OF ITS ARMEO FORCES IN 
PLACE AND WAS ABLE TO CALL UP OEMOBILIZED FIGHTERS AND TO 
TRAIN OTHERS.  MOREOVER, WITH THE INVASION OF BAOME AND 
THE ATTEMPT TO CHANGE FACTS ON THE GROUNO BY FORCE, 
ERITREA CROSSED AN ETHIOPIAN RED LINE.  ON OTHER ISSUES, 
ETHIOPIA MIGHT HAVE AGREED TO TURN ITS CHEEK, BUT THIS 
AFFRONT WAS SO GREAT THAT TO LET IT PASS IN SILENCE WOULD 
HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY TO RELINQUISH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY. 
THUS, THE DEMAND THAT ISAIAS WITHDRAW AND THAT BADME BE 
RETURNEO TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE IS EVERYTHING.  IF HE 
DOES, THEN PERHAPS HE WILL HAVE LEARNEO HIS LESSON.  IF 
HE OOES NOT, THEN HE MUST BE TAUGHT. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
U.S. UNFAIR AND SHOWS LACK OF CONSENSUS 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6.  (C) MELES WAS DISMISSIVE OF SUGGESTIONS FROM 
WASHINGTON THAT A RENEWED ENGAGEMENT BY THE U.S. WOULD 
BEAR FRUIT.  FIRST, HE EXPRESSED AGAIN HIS ANNOYANCE OVER 
THE USG STATEMENT OF AUGUST 6 WITH REGARD TO THE 
EXPULSIONS OF ERITREANS.  THIS, HE REPEATED, WAS UNFAIR 
AND UNBALANCED.  THE U.S. SAIO NOTHING ABOUT THE CHILDREN 
KILLEO IN MEKELLE, NOTHING ABOUT 170,000 DISPLACED AND 
VOICELESS PEASANTS IN TIGRAY AND NOTHING ABOUT THE 
DESTRUCTION OF ZAL ANBESSA, BUT IT ATTACKS ETHIOPIA FOR 
POLITELY ASKING SOME POSSIBLE SECURITY THREATS TO LEAVE 
THE COUNTRY.  THIS IS MORE THAN A SENTIMENTAL ISSUE, HE 
ARGUED; SUBSTANTIVELY, THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH A STATEMENT 
SUPPORTS THE ETHIOPIAN BELIEF, LONG HELD BUT IN ABEYANCE 
IN RECENT MONTHS, THAT THE U.S. APPLIES A DOUBLE STANOARD 
IN ITS TREATMENT OF ERITREA AND ETHIOPIA.  THIS WAS 
ALWAYS CLEAR IN ANNUAL HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS.  HE WAS 
FOREWARNED THAT A STATEMENT WAS IN THE WORKS, AND ASSUMES 
THE EVENTUAL FINAL VERSION WAS \"SANITIZED\" FROM EARLIER 
DRAFTS. 
 
7.  (C) IT IS CLEAR THEN, MELES ACCUSED, THAT THERE ARE 
PEOPLE OF INFLUENCE IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHO ARE 
CAPABLE OF WORSE LANGUAGE ABOUT ETHIOPIA AND THAT THERE 
IS NO CONSENSUS ON THE ISSUE.  HE HAD JUST READ A 
MAGAZINE INTERVIEW WITH ISAIAS, IN WHICH THE ERITREAN 
INDICATED THAT U.S. OFFICIALS HAD TOLD HIM HE MUST BE 
MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE ETHIOPIA IS TOO FRAGILE TO PERMIT 
MELES TO BEND.  WHILE HE KNOWS ISAIAS PLAYS FAST AND 
LOOSE WITH THE TRUTH, MELES SAID, SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID.  AFTER ALL, HE HAS HEARD THAT AT 
LEAST ONE OF THE FACILITATORS HAS SAID HE REGRETS HAVING 
DRAFTED THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS.  BY TELLING THIS TO 
ISAIAS, THE U.S. MERELY REINFORCES ISAIAS\' MISPERCEPTIONS 
OF THE SITUATION.  IF THE U.S. BELIEVES ETHIOPIA WILL 
CRACK UNDER PRESSURE, ITS PREMISES ARE DIAMETRICALLY 
OPPOSED TO THOSE ON WHICH MELES IS OPERATING. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
SO WHY DON\'T YOU JUST LAY OFF, LET THINGS EVOLVE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
8.  (C) WITH ALL THIS IN MIND, MELES FINDS THE CONTINUING 
U.S. WISH TO CONCENTRATE ON PREVENTION OF ARMED CONFLICT 
OFF THE MARK.  TO PREVENT WAR WILL TAKE A VERY STRONG 
MESSAGE TO ISAIAS.  ASKED BY THE CHARGE TO ELABORATE, 
MELES PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE:  \"ISAIAS, THIS IS 
YOUR MESS.  YOU MAY PAY SOME POLITICAL COSTS BY 
WITHDRAWING FROM BADME, BUT IF YOU DO NOT, YOU ARE ON 
YOUR OWN, WITHOUT OUR SUPPORT AND WITHOUT OUR PRESSURE ON 
ETHIOPIA TO AVOID WAR.\"  THIS MESSAGE, MELES STATED 
CATEGORICALLY, IS ONE THAT THE U.S., WHICH ISSUED THE 
AUGUST 6 STATEMENT AND WHICH MIGHT HAVE CALLED ETHIOPIA 
FRAGILE, CANNOT AND WILL NOT SEND.  THUS IT IS BETTER, 
MELES SUGGESTED, IF THE U.S. LETS THINGS TAKE THEIR 
COURSE AND EVOLVE NATURALLY.  JUST BE AWARE, HE ADDED, 
THAT NOTHING WILL PREVENT ETHIOPIA\'S ATTEMPT TO DISLODGE 
ISAIAS FROM BADME IF HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW VOLUNTARILY. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
WHY NOT PREPARE FOR THE EVENTUAL AFTERMATH? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9.  (C) A BETTER USE OF OUR ANALYTIC CAPACITY, MELES 
PROPOSED, IS TO ASSESS THE END GAME AND WHAT THE U.S. 
MIGHT DO TO PICK UP THE PIECES LATER, AFTER THE WORST 
HAPPENS AND THE TWO COUNTRIES FIGHT IT OUT.  A FRIEND 
WITH RESOURCES AND A PLAN FOR THE AFTERMATH WOULD BE MOST 
WELCOME.  WHY NOT PREPARE FOR THE THREE EVENTUALITIES: 
ETHIOPIA CRACKS, ERITREA CRACKS, THERE IS A DRAW. 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
MELES CAN WORK WITH ISAIAS, IF HE BACKS DOWN 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  (C) CHARGE DEMURRED AT MELES\' CATEGORIZATION OF OUR 
DEPORTATIONS STATEMENT, OBSERVING IT WAS ISSUED TO 
ADDRESS A SYMPTOM OF THE LARGER CONFLICT.  HE URGED MELES 
TO DIVORCE THE EXPULSIONS AND OUR STATEMENT FROM 
EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT.  MOREOVER, TO THE EXTENT 
THE EMBASSY OBTAINS CREDIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT ERITREAN 
ABUSES OF ETHIOPIANS, WE WILL RESPOND PUBLICLY WITH 
DISAPPROVAL THERE, TOO.  (CHARGE ADDED THAT AN EMBASSY 
TEAM IS VISITING REPUTED ETHIOPIAN DEPORTEES IN DESSE 
THIS WEEK.)  AS TO ISAIAS\' REPORTED STATEMENT ABOUT U.S. 
OFFICIALS CALLING ETHIOPIA TOO FRAGILE TO BEND, THE 
CHARGE ASSURED THE PRIME MINISTER THIS IS NOT U.S. POLICY 
AND THAT HE COULD NOT IMAGINE SUCH A THING BEING 
PRESENTED TO ISAIAS.  FINALLY, HE EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN 
OVER MELES\' DRAWING A COMPARISON BETWEEN ISAIAS AND 
SADDAM HUSSEIN, COMMENTING THAT THIS IMPLIED MELES WOULD 
NOT BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ISAIAS IN ANY EVENT. 
 
11.  (C) MELES ANSWERED THAT HE SEES THE STATEMENT AS A 
REFLECTION OF A NEGATIVE STATE OF MIND AND THAT, WHILE 
ISAIAS MIGHT HAVE LIED, HE IS STILL CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT 
HE SAID.  AS TO THE SADDAM ANALOGY, MELES ASSURED CHARGE 
HE CAN WORK WITH ISAIAS IF THIS CONFLICT IS SETTLED 
PEACEFULLY, ALTHOUGH HE CAN \"NEVER LOVE HIM OR TRUST HIM 
AGAIN.\"  ASKED AGAIN WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE, A COMMITMENT 
BY ISAIAS TO WITHDRAW FROM BADME FIRST MIGHT SUFFICE TO 
RESTART PEACE NEGOTIATIONS, MELES STRESSED THAT WHAT IS 
IMPORTANT IS THAT THE INVADER WITHDRAW BEFORE THE 
INVADED.  ERITREA HAS TO DO THIS UNILATERALLY, NOT AS ITS 
SIDE OF A JOINT WITHDRAWAL FOR DEMILITARIZATION.  THAT 
WILL MAKE THE POINT TO ALL ERITREANS THAT THERE CAN BE NO 
CHANGE BY FORCE, AND THEY WILL ACT AS A BRAKE ON ISAIAS 
SHOULD HE WISH TO GO ADVENTURING AGAIN.  THAT WILL BE 
ETHIOPIA\'S GUARANTEE OF SECURITY IN FUTURE. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12.  (C) MOST OF THE PRIVATE PRESS IS EXPRESSING OUTRAGE 
OVER THE U.S. STATEMENT AND ONE ARTICLE CALLED IT THE 
FOURTH U.S. BETRAYAL OF ETHIOPIA (OUR REFUSAL TO STAND 
AGAINST ITALY\'S INVASION, OUR FAILURE TO ASSIST WHEN SIAD 
BARRE INVADED, AND OUR ACQUIESCENCE IN TPLF\'S ALLOWING 
ERITREA ITS INDEPENDENCE BEING THE FIRST THREE).  MELES\' 
PORTRAYAL OF THE BETRAYED ETHIOPIAN APPEARED HEARTFELT. 
HIS ANALYSIS OF U.S. INCAPACITY TO ACT AS HONEST BROKER 
NOW, WHILE ILLOGICAL FROM AN OBJECTIVE POINT OF VIEW, 
CLEARLY REFLECTS A LOSS OF CONFIDENCE, ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT 
EXCLUDE THE REAL POSSIBILITY THAT HE ALSO SEEKS TO 
BOLSTER U.S. RESOLVE.  MELES\' SUGGESTION THE U.S. BEGIN 
ASSESSING WHAT IT MIGHT DO IN THE AFTERMATH OF WAR 
APPEARS TO BE HIS WAY OF SAYING \"IF YOU CAN\'T TAKE THE 
HEAT, GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN.\"  WE THINK WE SHOULD STAY 
IN THE KITCHEN AND BE PREPARED TO TAKE MUCH MORE HEAT 
FROM BOTH MELES AND ISAIAS AS WE TRY TO PUSH THE PEACE 
PROCESS FORWARD.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE TIME TO PICK UP 
THE PIECES IF WE DO NOT SUCCEED. 
 
13.  (U) ASMARA, DAR ES SALAAM, KAMPALA AND NAIROBI 
MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.

REF: STATE 204472 
 
1.  FORMAT FOR THIS MESSAGE WAS DERIVED FROM REFTEL. 
 
A.  THE ETHIOPIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE TO RESPOND TO ANY 
ACTS OF TERRORISM DURING 1999, INCLUDING HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTIONS RELATING TO TERRORISM. 
 
B.  ETHIOPIA DID NOT EXTRADITE OR REQUEST THE EXTRADITION OF 
SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION DURING 1999.  IF REQUESTED TO 
DO SO, THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD EXTRADITE SUSPECTED 
TERRORISTS TO THE UNITED STATES. 
 
C.  THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOST GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTION AND/OR EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS. 
 
D.  THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT HAS IN THE PAST PUBLICLY CONDEMNED 
TERRORISM AND WOULD COOPERATE FULLY WITH ANY INVESTIGATION INTO 
TERRORIST ACTS OR INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST INVESTIGATIONS. 
 
E.  ETHIOPIA ACTIVELY PROSECUTES SUSPECTED TERRORISTS AGAINST 
SOMALIA.  HOWEVER, THE ETHIOPIA GOVERNMENT\'S FOCUS IN 1999 HAS 
BEEN ON THE BORDER DISPUTE WITH ERITREA. 
 
F.  ETHIOPIA DOES NOT SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, TERRORISTS, 
OR TERRORIST GROUPS, NOR DO THEY OFFER ANY SUPPORT OR EXTEND ANY 
PRIVILEGES OR TRAINING. 
 
G.  THE ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT HAS MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
SUPPORTING A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORIST ISSUE. 
 
H.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SINCE 1998 IN ETHIOPIA\'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARDS DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  ETHIOPIA IS 
VERY AGGRESSIVE IN ANTI-TERRORISM EFFORTS. 
 
I.  WE HAVE EXTENSIVE COOPERATION ON COUNTER-TERRORISM INITIATIVES 
IN TERMS OF TRAINING.  THE ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES COOPERATE FULLY 
WHEN SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED. 
 
J.  WE HAVE EXTENSIVE COOPERATION.  ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS BEEN 
CONVICTED, THEY HAVE COOPERATED FULLY.  THE ETHIOPIANS ARE 
EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING PEOPLE FROM ENTERING THROUGH PORTS OF ENTRY. 
 
K.  THE EMBASSY HAS NOT SOUGHT COOPERATION DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS 
IN THE PREVENTION OF AN ACT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM AGAINST 
U.S. CITIZENS OR INTERESTS.  HOWEVER, IF REQUESTED, IT IS BELIEVED 
ETHIOPIA WOULD COOPERATE FULLY.

1. (C)  SUMMARY:  ETHIOPIA IS A CONFIRMED AND COMMITTED 
PARTNER IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM (GWOT) AT ALL LEVELS. 
ALTHOUGH OFTEN LACKING IN CAPACITY, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA (GFDRE) HAS RESPONDED 
PRO-ACTIVELY TO THE GLOBAL THREAT.  EMBASSY KNOWS OF NO 
FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION (FTO) ACTIVITY IN ETHIOPIA, 
AND NO SUCH TOLERANCE BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THE GWOT FITS 
NEATLY INTO THE RULING COALITION\'S POLITICAL AGENDA, WHICH 
EQUATES ARMED OPPOSITION WITH INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
ETHIOPIA\'S CURRENT GOVERNMENT WILL REMAIN WITH US AS A 
STEADFAST PARTNER AGAINST TERRORISM. END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
ANNUAL RESPONSE 
--------------- 
 
2. (U)  THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES FOR 2002 ARE KEYED TO 
INSTRUCTIONS IN REFTEL A, PARA. 2: 
 
A. (U)  THE GFDRE STANDS FIRMLY AGAINST ALL FORMS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM, AND HAS CONSISTENTLY OFFERED 
COOPERATION TO SUPPORT THE GWOT. 
 
B. (U)  THE JUDICIARY HAS NOT HAD TO RESPOND TO ANY ACTS OF 
INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. 
 
C. (U)  ETHIOPIA HAS NOT EXTRADITED NOR REQUESTED 
EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS FOR PROSECUTION.  IF 
REQUESTED, THE GFDRE WOULD EXTRADITE SUSPECTED TERRORISTS TO 
THE U.S. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO EXTRADITION TREATY. 
 
D. (U)  THE GFDRE\'S ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO 
TERRORISM IS HAMPERED BY INSUFFICIENT FUNDING AND INADEQUATE 
TRAINING OF ITS SECURITY FORCES AND JUDICIARY.  CRIMINAL 
CASES OFTEN LANGUISH IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND SUSPECTS CAN 
SPEND YEARS AWAITING TRIAL. 
 
E. (U)  GFDRE RESPONSES TO TERRORISM: THE GFDRE HAS 
CONSISTENTLY CONDEMNED TERRORISM, INCLUDING THE 1998 NAIROBI 
AND DAR ES SALAAM BOMBINGS AND THE 9/11 ATTACKS.  PRIME 
MINISTER MELES ZENAWI REGULARLY CONDEMNS ALL FORMS OF 
TERRORISM.  THE GFDRE HAS TAKEN ACTIONS TO CONTROL ITS BORDER 
WITH SOMALIA TO PREVENT SMUGGLING AND TERRORIST MOVEMENT. THE 
GFDRE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF DJIBOUTI ARE DISCUSSING WAYS TO 
REDUCE TERRORISTS, ABILITY TO MOVE ACROSS THEIR BORDER EN 
ROUTE TO AND FROM YEMEN. 
 
F. (U) SIGNIFICANT GFDRE COUNTERTERRORISM (CT) ACTIVITIES 
INCLUDE POLITICAL, FINANCIAL, MEDIA, MILITARY AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ACTION.   ETHIOPIA SIGNED THE OAU DRAFT 
CONVENTION ON TERRORISM PRIOR TO ATTENDING THE SEPTEMBER 
11-14 AFRICAN UNION TERRORISM CONFERENCE IN ALGIERS (ALTHOUGH 
THEY FAVORED THE \"FREEDOM FIGHTER\" CLAUSE DESPITE EMBASSY,S 
REFTEL B REQUEST).  IN A STATEMENT AFTER A SEPTEMBER BOMBING 
OF AN ADDIS ABABA HOTEL, THE GFDRE SAID ETHIOPIA HAD BEEN 
PLAGUED BY TERRORISM LONG BEFORE THE GWOT.  IN OCTOBER, 
FOREIGN MINISTER SEYOUM MESFIN TOLD UNGA THAT ALL WHO 
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGE TERRORISM SHOULD 
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE ETHIOPIAN CENTRAL BANK HAS BEEN 
PROMPT IN COMPLYING WITH OUR REQUESTS FOR NAME CHECKS AND 
ASSET FREEZES.  TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO FTOS HAVE ASSETS IN 
ETHIOPIA.  TO COUNTER THE THREAT OF AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISLAMIYA 
(AIAI), THE GFDRE HAS UNDERTAKEN INCREASED MILITARY EFFORTS 
TO CONTROL ITS LONG BORDER WITH SOMALIA. MEDIA REPORTS 
INDICATE THAT FOUR PAKISTANIS WERE ARRESTED IN DIRE DAWA \"ON 
SUSPICION OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORIST ACTIVITY.\" POLICE 
ARRESTED FOUR YEMENIS AND THREE PAKISTANIS ENTERING FROM 
SUDAN.  WHILE IN TRANSIT TO ADDIS ABABA, THE SUSPECTS KILLED 
A GUARD AND ALL SEVEN MANAGED TO ESCAPE. 
 
G. (U)  THE GFDRE DOES NOT LEND SUPPORT TO INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM, AND OFFERS NO SUPPORT, PRIVILEGES OR TRAINING TO 
TERRORISTS. 
 
H. (U)  THE GFDRE HAS NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 
SUPPORT OF ANY TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRIES ON ISSUES 
RELATED TO TERRORISM. 
 
I. (U)  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN THE GFDRE\'S STRONG 
SUPPORT FOR THE COALITION AGAINST TERRORISM IN 2002. 
 
J. (U)  THE GFDRE HAS CONSISTENTLY OFFERED FULL COOPERATION 
IN THE GWOT, AND BURNISHES ITS ROLE AS A U.S. PARTNER.  THE 
EMBASSY WORKS CLOSELY WITH MANY GFDRE COMPONENTS IN ALL 
FACETS OF CT.  SEYOUM RECENTLY TOLD THE AMBASSADOR, \"UNLESS 
OUR CAPACITY LIMITS US, WE WILL NOT FAIL YOU.\" 
 
K. (U)  THE EMBASSY HAS RECEIVED CONTINUING COOPERATION FROM 
THE GFDRE IN THE INVESTIGATION FOLLOWING THE 9/11 ATTACKS. 
 
L. (U)  THE GFDRE IS FULLY RESPONSIVE TO REQUESTS TO PROTECT 
U.S. CITIZENS AND FACILITIES. 

------------------------- 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
------------------------- 
 
3. (C)  CONFIRMING REF. C, WE KNOW OF NO FTOS ON ETHIOPIAN 
SOIL ACTIVE OR WORTH WATCHING. 
 
4. (S)  MELES MAY BE GOING TOO FAR:  THE PM MAY HAVE SOME 
DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHING THE GWOT FROM SECTARIAN RIVALRY. 
AS REPORTED IN REF. D, MELES TOLD CODEL IN AUGUST THAT 
ETHIOPIA IS IN THE GWOT FOR ITS OWN NATIONAL SECURITY.  HIS 
PRIVATE COMMENTS INDICATE THAT HE MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY 
DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN ISLAM, ISLAMISM, AND TERRORISM.  HE 
EQUATES ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM WITH TERRORISM, SAYING 
WAHHABISM IS \"INFILTRATING AND DOMINATING THE REGION.\"  HE 
DESCRIBES ETHIOPIA AS BEING \"AT THE EPICENTER\" OF TERRORISM 
SINCE THE SEVENTH CENTURY (REF. E).  FORTUNATELY, MELES HAS 
NOT MADE ANY PUBLIC STATEMENTS BETRAYING SUCH A 
\"LUMP-THEM-ALL-TOGETHER\" OUTLOOK.  THE OPPOSITION IS ALSO 
WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF EXTREMISM, AND, NOT 
PRIVY TO THE GOVERNMENT\'S ACTIONS, FEARS THE GFDRE IS NOT 
DOING ENOUGH.  ACCORDING TO A PROMINENT OPPOSITION 
POLITICIAN, OVERT SAUDI AND COVERT IRANIAN INFLUENCE ARE 
SPREADING EXTREMISM WHILE THE RULING COALITION IS TOLERATING 
AN INCREASE IN SECTARIANISM. 
 
5. (S)  A SOURCE WITH UNESTABLISHED RELIABILITY HAS REPORTED 
THAT THE ERITREAN \"GREATER ALLIANCE,\" AN UMBRELLA GROUP 
CONSISTING OF TEN ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE ERITREAN 
ISLAMIC JIHAD, HAS MOVED ITS HEADQUARTERS TO ETHIOPIA.  WE 
HAVE SEEN THE REF. F REPORT THAT THE JIHAD IS BELIEVED TO 
RECEIVE POLITICAL BACKING FROM THE GFDRE, BUT CANNOT CONFIRM 
SUCH. 
 
6. (C) THE GFDRE CONSIDERS ITS DOMESTIC ARMED OPPOSITION AS 
TERRORISTS, DRAWING LITTLE JURIDICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN SUCH 
DIPARATE GROUPS AS AL-QAEDA AND THE HOME-GROWN OROMO 
LIBERATION FRONT (OLF).  MELES TOLD PARLIAMENT IN SEPTEMBER 
THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST THE OLF SHOULD NOT BE SEEN IN 
ISOLATION FROM THE GWOT. THE GFDRE WILL LIKELY CONTINUE 
SEEKING USG SUPPORT AGAINST THE OLF, INCLUDING ITS ADDITION 
TO EXECUTIVE ORDERS AS AN FTO.  THE OLF IS WIDELY BELIEVED TO 
HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR A JUNE ATTACK ON A RAILWAY STATION 
IN DIRE DAWA AND A SEPTEMBER BOMBING OF AN ADDIS ABABA HOTEL. 
 THE TEN HOTEL BOMBING SUSPECTS APPEARED IN COURT THIS WEEK 
AND PLED NOT GUILTY. THE OLF HAS DENIED THE GFDRE\'S PUBLIC 
ALLEGATIONS. 
 
7. (C)  COMMENT:  MELES FINDS THE GWOT POLITICALLY 
ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BOTH ETHIOPIA AND HIS RULING COALITION, AND 
EVEN CALLED IT A \"GODSEND\" BECAUSE OF ETHIOPIA\'S UNFORTUNATE 
EXPERIENCE WITH INTERNAL VIOLENCE AND INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM 
(AS THEY DEFINE IT).  SHORTLY AFTER 9/11, ETHIOPIAN MILITARY 
LEADERS SOUGHT U.S. ENGAGEMENT IN A PROPOSAL FOR A SERIES OF 
LARGE-SCALE STRIKES ON NEIGHBORING SOMALIA, A BREEDING GROUND 
AND SAFEHAVEN FOR TERRORISTS, AND A PERENNIAL THORN IN THE 
SIDE OF EVERY ETHIOPIAN GOVERNMENT.  FOR THIS GOVERNMENT, THE 
GWOT IS A TWO-FER: THEY USE IT TO DRAW CLOSER TO THE U.S. 
AND/AND GAIN RESOURCES FOR THEIR OWN CT EFFORTS. END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, PREL, PINS, ET 
SUBJECT: ETHIOPIA: 2003 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 301352 
 
1.  This is post\'s submission for the 2003 Annual Terrorism 
Report.  Answers are keyed to questions in reftel. 
 
2.  Post Responses 
 
A) Significant actions taken by host government to support 
the Global Coalition Against Terrorism: The Government of the 
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) is a firm and 
committed partner in the Global Coalition Against Terrorism 
and has not shied away from making public statements 
condemning terrorism to include providing full support to the 
U.S. policy on Iraq.  The GFDRE has cooperated in USG efforts 
to block any terrorist assets that might be in Ethiopia.  In 
fall 2003, the GFDRE created a committee to draft new 
counterterrorism legislation and expects to enact this new 
counterterrorism law by early 2004. 
 
B) Response of Judicial System: The GFDRE did not prosecute 
any incidents related to terrorism in 2003.  There were no 
acts of terrorism against U.S. citizens or facilities in 
Ethiopia in 2003. 
 
C) Extraditions:  The GFDRE did not extradite or request the 
extradition of suspected terrorists in 2003.  There were no 
USG requests to the GFDRE for extradition of suspected 
terrorists in 2003.  We believe Ethiopia would extradite 
suspected terrorists to the U.S. if requested, although we 
have no extradition treaty. 
 
D) Impediments to prosecution: There were no significant 
impediments to prosecution and/or extradition of suspected 
terrorists in Ethiopia in 2003.  However, the GFDRE\'s ability 
to respond effectively to terrorism is hampered by 
insufficient funding and inadequate training of its security 
forces and judiciary.  Criminal cases languish in the 
judicial system and suspects can spend years awaiting trial. 
 
E) Responses other than prosecution: The GFDRE has 
consistently condemned terrorism, including the 1998 Nairobi 
and Dar es Salaam bombings and the 9/11 attacks.  Prime 
Minister Meles Zenawi regularly condemns all forms of 
terrorism.  The GFDRE has taken actions to controls its 
border with Somalia to prevent smuggling and terrorist 
movement.  The GFDRE and the Government of Djibouti are 
discussing ways to reduce terrorists\' ability to move across 
their border en route to and from Yemen and Somalia.  The 
GFDRE is cooperating with the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn 
of Africa (CJTF-HOA) in training to fight terrorism. 
Infantry forces from the U.S. Army\'s 10th Mountain Division,
