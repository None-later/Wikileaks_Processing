SUBJECT: AMERASIANS SHOW SIGNS OF ASSIMILATION INTO VIETNAMESE SOCIETY 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE VIETNAM WAR, 
VIETNAMESE SOCIETY SHUNNED AMERASIANS AND CONSIGNED MANY 
OF THEM TO LIVE ON THE STREETS IN ABJECT POVERTY. OVER THE 
PAST TWENTY-FIVE YEARS, HOWEVER, THEIR SITUATION SEEMS TO 
HAVE IMPROVED. RECENT INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT MOST 
VIETNAMESE NOW TREAT AMERASIANS NO DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  01 OF 03  170856Z 
VIETNAMESE. END SUMMARY. 
 
\"CON LAI MY\" 
------------ 
 
2.  AMERASIANS IN VIETNAM ARE KNOWN AS \"CON LAI MY,\" WHICH 
ROUGHLY TRANSLATES TO \"MIXED-BLOOD AMERICAN.\"  IN THE WAKE 
OF THE AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL FROM VIETNAM, AMERASIANS AND 
THEIR MOTHERS BECAME THE TARGET OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, 
AND SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION.  MANY VIETNAMESE OSTRACIZED 
THEM FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.  IN ADDITION, 
THE GOVERNMENT FORCIBLY RELOCATED MANY OF THEM, ALONG WITH 
THEIR MOTHERS, TO \"NEW ECONOMIC ZONES\" WHERE THEY LIVED 
UNDER CONDITIONS OF SEVERE HARDSHIP.  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO 
DENIED MANY AMERASIANS ACCESS TO IDENTITY PAPERS AND OTHER 
DOCUMENTS CRITICAL FOR INTEGRATION INTO CIVIL SOCIETY. 
 
3.  THE U.S. CONGRESS RECOGNIZED THE DIRE PLIGHT OF 
AMERASIANS WHEN IT PASSED THE AMERASIAN HOMECOMING ACT IN 
1987.  AS REPORTED IN THE ACT\'S LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, MANY 
\"AMERASIAN CHILDREN ARE REPORTEDLY INELIGIBLE FOR RATION 
CARDS AND OFTEN BEG IN THE STREETS, PEDDLE BLACK MARKET 
WARES, OR PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES.\"  THE HISTORY ALSO NOTES 
THAT \"THE MOTHERS OF AMERASIAN CHILDREN IN VIETNAM ARE NOT 
ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT JOBS OR EMPLOYMENT IN GOVERNMENT 
ENTERPRISES AND MANY ARE ESTRANGED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND 
ARE DESTITUTE.\"  THE ACT ALLOWS AMERASIANS (DEFINED AS \"AN 
ALIEN WHO WAS BORN IN VIETNAM AFTER JANUARY 1, 1962 AND 
BEFORE JANUARY 1, 1976 AND WHO WAS FATHERED BY A CITIZEN 
OF THE UNITED STATES\") AND THEIR CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS TO 
ENTER THE UNITED STATES AS IMMIGRANTS AND RECEIVE REFUGEE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  01 OF 03  170856Z 
BENEFITS. 
 
4.  TODAY, AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF AMERASIANS STILL LIVE IN 
VIETNAM.  APPROXIMATELY TWENTY AMERASIANS EACH WEEK APPLY 
TO THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SECTION FOR ADMISSION TO THE 
UNITED STATES THROUGH THE AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND THE LIVES OF AMERASIANS TODAY, POST\'S DEPUTY 
RESETTLEMENT SECTION CHIEF (REFOFF) EXAMINED THE 
APPLICATION FORMS OF RECENTLY-APPROVED AMERASIANS, 
SOLICITED INFORMATION THROUGH SURVEYS, AND INTERVIEWED 
PENDING AND PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS. 
 
AMERASIANS APPROVED BETWEEN JANUARY AND MARCH 2000 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
5.  THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS APPROVED 
FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES FROM JANUARY THROUGH 
MARCH 2000 WAS TWENTY-NINE.  FORTY-ONE WERE MARRIED, ONE 
WAS DIVORCED, ONE WAS SEPARATED AND THE REMAINING EIGHTEEN 
WERE SINGLE.  THIRTY-FOUR OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS HAD 
AT LEAST ONE CHILD.  NEARLY ALL APPLIED AS MEMBERS OF 
FAMILY GROUPS.  INDEED, ONLY FOUR INTENDED TO GO TO THE 
UNITED STATES ALONE. 
 
6. THE INTERVIEWED AMERASIANS REPORTED A NINETY-SEVEN 
PERCENT EMPLOYMENT RATE.  THEY ARE EMPLOYED AS FOLLOWS: 
 
                    LABORER             13

ONLY TWO AMERASIANS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE UNEMPLOYED. 
 
MOST AMERASIANS REPORT EQUAL TREATMENT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
7.  THIRTY-SIX OF THE SIXTY-ONE AMERASIANS SURVEYED 
REPORTED THAT, IN THE PAST TEN YEARS, THEY HAD BEEN 
TREATED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHER VIETNAMESE. PHUONG THAO, 
FOR EXAMPLE, IS AN AMERASIAN WHO LIVES IN HO CHI MINH CITY 
WITH HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER.  SHE HAS NOT YET APPLIED 
FOR THE AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  ALTHOUGH HER MOTHER URGED HER 
TO APPLY FOR AN AMERASIAN VISA IN THE EARLY 1990S, PHUONG 
THAO CHOSE TO STAY IN VIETNAM BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT TO 
LEAVE HER EXTENDED FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  SHE NOW MAKES A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z 
LIVING AS A SINGER. 
 
8.  IN AN EXTENDED INTERVIEW WITH REFOFF, PHUONG THAO 
RECALLED THAT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, OTHER CHILDREN TAUNTED 
HER BECAUSE HER FATHER WAS AMERICAN.  FURTHER, THE 
COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION, DOAN THANH VIEN, DID NOT 
ALLOW PHUONG THAO TO JOIN.  PHUONG THAO BELIEVES THAT THIS 
EXCLUSION DISADVANTAGED HER WHEN APPLYING FOR SCHOOLS AND 
EMPLOYMENT. 
 
9. FOR PHUONG THAO, THE NAME-CALLING AND DISCRIMINATION 
ARE ONLY BAD MEMORIES FROM THE PAST.  NOW, SHE SAYS, THE 
ETHNIC VIETNAMESE TREAT HER JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. NOT 
EVEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS OFF LIMITS TO HER.  IF SHE 
WANTED TO JOIN, SHE SAID, SHE COULD.  SOCIALLY, SHE IS 
TREATED AS IF SHE WERE FULLY VIETNAMESE.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
WHEN PHUONG THAO MARRIED IN 1993, HER HUSBAND\'S ETHNIC 
VIETNAMESE PARENTS EASILY ACCEPTED HER INTO THE FAMILY. 
 
10.  PHUONG THAO AND HER HUSBAND ARE NOW CONSIDERING 
APPLYING FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH THE 
AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  THEIR INTENTION IS TO STUDY AND 
PERFORM MUSIC IN THE UNITED STATES FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR AND 
THEN RETURN TO VIETNAM.  SHE AND HER COMPOSER HUSBAND WANT 
TO SHOW THROUGH THEIR SONGS THAT THERE EXIST AMERASIANS 
\"WITH AMBITION AND GOOD JOBS, THAT WE\'RE THE SAME AS 
OTHERS.\" 
 
11.  HONG, ANOTHER AMERASIAN, SHARED MANY OF PHUONG THAO\'S 
EXPERIENCES.  REFOFF VISITED HONG AT HER HOME NEAR QUI 
NHON CITY. BY THE TIME REFOFF FOUND HONG\'S HOUSE LOCATED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z 
AT THE EDGE OF A COMMUNITY ON THE FAR SIDE OF QUI NHON 
BAY, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY-FIVE PERSONS HAD 
FORMED AROUND HONG\'S SMALL CEMENT DWELLING.  VILLAGERS 
CROWDED THE DOOR AND PRESSED AGAINST THE WINDOW\'S IRON 
GRILLWORK TO LISTEN AS REFOFF INTERVIEWED HONG IN THE 
FRONT ROOM OF THE HOUSE.  HONG EXPLAINED THAT HER AMERICAN 
FATHER ABANDONED HER MOTHER WHO THEN ABANDONED HONG TO A 
FOSTER FAMILY IN QUI NHON.  SHE HAS NEVER MET OR HEARD 
FROM HER FATHER.  SHE MET HER MOTHER ONCE IN 1986 WHEN SHE 
RESURFACED TO CONVINCE HONG TO TAKE HER TO THE UNITED 
STATES.  HONG REFUSED TO GO, CHOOSING INSTEAD TO REMAIN 
WITH HER FOSTER FAMILY. 
 
12. IN 1995, HONG FINALLY DECIDED TO APPLY FOR THE 
AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, THE ORDERLY DEPARTURE PROGRAM 
(ODP) REJECTED HER APPLICATION.  ACCORDING TO THE CASE 
FILE, THE ODP OFFICER DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HONG HAD A 
CREDIBLE AMERASIAN APPEARANCE.  [COMMENT:  REFOFF IS 
CONVINCED THAT HONG IS AMERASIAN.  NOT ONLY DOES HER 
ENTIRE COMMUNITY CONSIDER HER TO BE AMERASIAN, BUT BOTH 
SHE AND HER SON HAVE DISTINCTLY CAUCASIAN FACIAL FEATURES. 
ACCORDINGLY, REFOFF ENCOURAGED HONG TO REAPPLY FOR THE 
AMERASIAN PROGRAM.  END COMMENT.] 
 
13.  HONG SAID THAT HER LIFE HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT SHE 
DOES NOT NECESSARILY ATTRIBUTE HER DIFFICULTIES TO HER 
AMERASIAN HERITAGE.  AS A CHILD, SHE WAS CALLED NAMES SUCH 
AS \"CON LAI.\"  SHE SAID THAT IT SOMETIMES MADE HER SAD TO 
BE REMINDED OF HER LOST PARENTS.  CURRENTLY, HONG INSISTS 
THAT SHE IS TREATED FAIRLY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO BEING 
AMERASIAN.  SHE OWNS A SMALL BOAT AND FERRIES PEOPLE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00838  02 OF 03  170857Z 
ACROSS QUI NHON BAY.  HER HUSBAND IS A FISHERMAN.  SHE 
SAID THAT HER LIFE IS HARD, BUT NO HARDER THAN ANYONE 
ELSE\'S. 
 
14.  TOWARD THE END OF THE INTERVIEW, LIGHT FLOODED THE 
SMALL ROOM AS THE VILLAGERS SUDDENLY PULLED AWAY FROM THE 
WINDOWS AND DISPERSED. A POLICE OFFICER AND A PLAIN- 
CLOTHED GENTLEMAN -- LATER IDENTIFIED AS THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY BLOCK WARDEN -- MARCHED INTO THE SMALL ROOM.  THE 
MEN DEMANDED THAT REFOFF IDENTIFY HIMSELF AND PRODUCE A 
LETTER OF INVITATION.  HAVING NO LETTER, REFOFF EXPLAINED 
THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT AND INVITED THE TWO OFFICIALS TO 
JOIN IN THE DISCUSSION.  THOUGH AT FIRST RETICENT, BOTH 
THE OFFICER AND THE WARDEN ECHOED WHAT HONG HAD ALREADY 
TOLD REFOFF.  THEY CONFIRMED THAT HONG, THE ONLY AMERASIAN 
IN THE TOWN, IS TREATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND HER 
NEIGHBORS JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. 
 
SOME CONTINUING INSTANCES OF MISTREATMENT 
----------------------------------------- 
 
15.  OF THOSE AMERASIANS WHO REPORTED DIFFERING TREATMENT, 
THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINT WAS NAME-CALLING.  FOURTEEN OF 
THE AMERASIANS REPORTED BEING CALLED \"CON LAI\" OR \"MY 
LAI,\" VIETNAMESE FOR MIXED AMERICAN, OR \"MY DEN,\" 
VIETNAMESE FOR BLACK AMERICAN.  THE AMERASIANS REACTED 
DIFFERENTLY TO THE NAME-CALLING.  SOME, LIKE HONG, 
REPORTED FEELINGS OF SHAME OR EMBARRASMENT. OTHERS 
PERCEIVED \"CON LAI\" AS A TERM OF ENDEARMENT. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00838  03 OF 03  170857Z 
16.  THE NEXT MOST COMMON CONCERN OF THE AMERASIANS WAS 
JOB DISCRIMINATION, WHICH WAS REPORTED BY TEN SURVEY 
RESPONDENTS.  OF THESE, A FEW SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT 
HIRED FOR AT LEAST ONE JOB BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR 
SKIN.  SOME REASONED THAT THEY HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK 
BECAUSE THEY HAD LIMITED EDUCATIONS.  ONE, A THIRTY-TWO- 
YEAR-OLD LABORER FROM BIEN HOA, SAID THAT EMPLOYERS IN HIS 
AREA KNOW AND ACCEPT HIM, BUT WILL NOT HIRE HIM 
PERMANENTLY BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT ONE DAY HE WILL 
DECIDE TO LEAVE FOR THE UNITED STATES. 
 
17.  A FEW SURVEY RESONDENTS REPORTED PROBLEMS.  THREE 
COMPLAINED OF \"LACK OF RESPECT,\" TWO CITED CONTINUING 
EFFECTS OF POOR EDUCATION, ONE CLAIMED TO BE THE VICTIM OF 
ARBITRARY ARREST AND ONE SAID SHE COULD NOT JOIN SOCIAL 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
18.  THE INFORMATION REPORTED ABOVE, THOUGH BASED ON A 
LIMITED SAMPLE OF AMERASIANS, SUGGESTS THAT THE FORTUNES 
OF AMERASIANS MAY BE CHANGING FOR THE BETTER.  WHEN THE 
AMERASIAN HOMECOMING ACT WAS PASSED THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, 
AMERASIANS WERE THE VICTIMS OF OFFICIAL DISCRIMINATION AND 
WERE COMPELLED TO \"BEG IN THE STREETS, PEDDLE BLACK MARKET 
WARES, OR PROSTITUTE THEMSELVES.\" BASED ON INFORMATION 
COLLECTED BY REFOFF, THIS PORTRAYAL MAY NOW BE FAR FROM 
THE TRUTH. 
 
19.  IN FACT, REFOFF DID NOT FIND A SINGLE AMERASIAN THAT 
WAS BEGGING IN THE STREETS, PEDDLING BLACK MARKET WARES, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00838  03 OF 03  170857Z 
OR PROSTITUTING HIM OR HERSELF.  NEARLY ALL THE AMERASIANS 
IN THE SUBJECT GROUP WERE MEMBERS OF LONG-STANDING FAMILY 
UNITS AND EMPLOYED IN LEGITIMATE JOBS OR PROFESSIONS. 
 
20.  AT THE TIME THE ACT WAS PASSED, AMERASIANS ALSO 
REPORTEDLY SUFFERED DISCRIMINATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
RATION CARDS AND IN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT.  THESE ISSUES 
ARE NO LONGER RELEVANT.  THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT NO 
LONGER DISTRIBUTES RATION CARDS, AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT 
IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO MAKE A LIVING IN VIETNAM. 
FURTHER, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE VIETNAMESE 
GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY ENGAGES IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION 
AGAINST AMERASIANS. 
 
21.  THE INFORMATION REPORTED ABOVE SUGGESTS THAT 
AMERASIANS, NOW ALL ADULTS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 24 AND 38, 
HAVE GENERALLY ENJOYED A POSITIVE SHIFT IN SOCIAL STATUS 
SINCE THE END OF THE VIETNAM WAR. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT 
SOME AMERASIANS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MISTREATMENT.  SOME 
MISTREATMENT IS, NO DOUBT, DUE IN PART TO A CULTURAL 
AVERSION TO MIXED-BLOOD CHILDREN, COMMON IN MANY PARTS OF 
ASIA.  IT IS ALSO LIKELY THAT MANY AMERASIANS EXPERIENCE 
EMPLOYMENT DIFFICULTIES BECAUSE THEY LACKED EDUCATIONAL 
OPPORTUNITIES AS CHILDREN.  MOST AMERASIANS IN REFOFF\'S 
SAMPLE, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO LEAD LIVES INDISTINGUISHABLE 
FROM OTHER VIETNAMESE.

1. CONGEN DPO AND POLOFF CANCELLED A VISIT TO DAC LAC AND 
BINH PHUOC PROVINCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS IN EARLY 
JUNE AFTER PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES REFUSED TO MEET WITH 
THEM.  ORIGINALLY, THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE 
CHAIRMAN OF BINH PHUOC PROVINCE AGREED TO MEET PROVIDED 
THE DISCUSSIONS DID NOT INCLUDE THE ISSUES OF ETHNIC 
MINORITIES OR RELIGION.  LATER, THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE 
CANCELLED THE MEETING ALTOGETHER. 
 
2. NOT ONLY DID THE TWO PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES REFUSE TO

NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR PROVINCES TO 
CANCEL ALREADY CONFIRMED MEETINGS AS WELL (THIS IS 
ACCORDING TO TWO SEPARATE RELIABLE SOURCES IN THOSE

AND LAND DISTIRBUTION.

ADVANCE NOTICE OF OUR TRAVEL PLANS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO 
DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT MFA INTERVENED TO ABORT THE TRIP, WE 
SUSPECT THAT MAY BE THE CASE GIVEN THE MORE BELLIGERENT

RICE RESEARCHERS HELP SKEPTICAL FARMERS, BENEFIT EXPORTERS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
2. CONGEN STAFF MET WITH DR. BUI CHI BUU OF THE CUU LONG 
RICE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CLRRI), STARTED IN 1977 WITH 
BILATERAL AID FROM INDIA.  37 OUT OF 110 STAFF SCIENTISTS 
HAVE ADVANCED DEGREES; CURRENTLY, THREE POSTDOCTORAL 
STUDENTS ARE AT PURDUE, TEXAS TECH, AND TEXAS A&M.  CLRRI 
MISSION OBJECTIVES ARE: 1) TO STUDY RICE AND RICE-BASED 
AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE DELTA, WHICH PRODUCES 60 
PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S RICE AND 80 PERCENT OF ITS RICE 
EXPORTS; 2) TO TRAIN EXTENSION WORKERS AND OTHER SKILLED 
WORKERS FOR THE DELTA; AND 3) TO FOSTER INTERNATIONAL 
COLLABORATION.  ADMINISTRATIVELY, CLRRI IS UNDER THE 
MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT (MARD). 
CLRRI\'S ANNUAL BUDGET IS APPROXIMATELY USD 500,000, 
SUPPLEMENTED BY CONTRACT RESEARCH.  ACCORDING TO THE 
MEDIA, PROFITS MADE PRODUCING RICE SEEDLINGS ON CLRRI LAND 
ARE USED TO AUGMENT STAFF SALARIES. 
 
3. IN 1999 THE MEKONG DELTA PRODUCED 16.5 MILLION METRIC 
TONS OF RICE AND HAD AN AVERAGE YIELD OF 4.8 TONS PER 
HECTACRE.  RICE IS GROWN ON 1.7 MILLION HECTARES OF DELTA 
LAND, SOMEWHAT LESS THAN 15 YEARS AGO.  HOWEVER, 
PRODUCTION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE THE LATE 1970\'S DUE 
TO IMPROVED MULTIPLE CROPPING AND MORE SUITABLE RICE 
VARIETIES, WITH CLRRI PLAYING A KEY ROLE CREATING NEW 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  01 OF 07  110409Z 
VARIETIES AND TESTING OTHERS.  MOST FARMERS IN THE DELTA 
GROW TWO RICE CROPS, THE MAIN SUMMER-AUTUMN CROP (JUNE TO 
SEPTEMBER) AND THE WINTER-SPRING CROP (NOVEMBER TO 
FEBRUARY).  SOME GROW A THIRD, SPRING-SUMMER CROP (MARCH 
TO JUNE), IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT IRRIGATION.  IN FACT, 
GROWING SEASONS ARE ACUTALLY MORE COMPLICATED, ACCORDING 
TO BUI, AND IT IS SOMETIMES POSSIBLE TO SEE PADDY IN ALL 
GROWTH STAGES AT THE SAME TIME IN THE SAME AREA.  THE 
INPUT COST PER KILOGRAM OF PADDY FOR THE WINTER/SPRING AND 
SPRING/SUMMER CROPS IS VND 800-1,000 (USD 0.06-0.07). 
INPUT COSTS FOR THE SUMMER/AUTUMN CROP OF VND 1,600-1,700 
(USD 0.11-0.12) ARE MUCH HIGHER, BUT SO ARE THE YIELDS. 
BUI SAID CLRRI IN FACT RECOMMENDS PLANTING SOYBEANS 
INSTEAD OF A THIRD RICE CROP TO MAINTAIN SOIL QUALITY, BUT 
FARMERS DON\'T FOLLOW ITS ADVICE BECAUSE RICE PRICES ARE 
NORMALLY MUCH HIGHER. 
 
4. CLRRI HAS SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED HIGH-YIELD VARIETIES. 
HOWEVER, FARMERS TYPICALLY USE SEED FROM THE PREVIOUS CROP 
FOR THE NEXT ONE, AT NO COST, WHICH RESULTS IN SEED 
DEGENERATION.  CLRRI HAS ALSO FOCUSED ON LOWERING INPUT 
COSTS, WHICH IN NOMINAL DONG TERMS HAVE DOUBLED OVER THE 
LAST TEN YEARS.  IN 1999, IT ADAPTED LEAF CHARTS TO REDUCE 
THE USE OF NITROGENOUS FERTILIZERS AND DEVELOPED A RICE 
SEEDER TO CUT SEED COSTS IN HALF OVER THE TRADITIONAL 
BROADCASTING METHOD.  DESPITE CLRRI\'S SUCCESSES, BUI SAID 
DELTA RICE FARMERS TREAT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS SKEPTICALLY, 
AND IT WOULD TAKE TWO YEARS FOR THE LEAF CHARTS AND 
SEEDERS TO CATCH ON.  BUI ALSO HOPED FOR THE SUCCESS OF A 
DANISH-FUNDED PROJECT WHICH HAS HELPED INSTALL OVER 5,000 
SMALL RICE DRYERS IN CAN THO AND SOC TRANG PROVINCES. 
ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF DELTA RICE FARMERS USE RICE DRIERS, 
SINCE THE COSTS OF DRYERS ARE NOT SEEN TO BE WORTH THE 
REDUCTION IN SPOILAGE AND INCREASED PRICE FOR HIGHER 
QUALITY.   DELTA RICE FARMERS ONLY EARNED AN AVERAGE OF 
USD 700 PER HOUSEHOLD IN 1999.  THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF 
CLRRI\'S WORK, SAID BUI, HAVE BEEN RICE EXPORTERS, WHO \"DO 
NOT INVEST IN ANYTHING.\"

ELECTRICITY RE-SELLERS CHARGE ABOVE THE LEGAL LIMIT 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
5. THE GVN HAS SET RURAL HOUSEHOLD ELECTRICITY PRICES 
CHARGED BY ELECTRICITY OF VIETNAM (EVN) AT VND 500 (3.6 
CENTS) PER KILOWATT-HOUR (KWH) FOR THE FIRST 100 KWH PER 
MONTH, RISING TO VND 1,397 (10.0 CENTS) FOR CONSUMPTION 
OVER 300 KWH.  IN SEPTEMBER 1999 ONLY 77 PERCENT OF 
VIETNAM\'S RURAL DISTRICTS HAD ELECTRICITY.  ALTHOUGH EACH 
OF CAN THO PROVINCE\'S SIX DISTRICTS AND CAN THO CITY HAVE 
ELECTRICITY, AT THE END OF 1999 ONLY 68 PERCENT OF 
HOUSEHOLDS WERE HOOKED UP.  CONGEN STAFF MET WITH DO HUU 
TRONG, DIRECTOR OF THE TAN PHU COMMUNE EVN STATION IN 
RURAL CHAU THANH DISTRICT.  EVN\'S GRID EXTENDS TO THE MAIN 
VILLAGE IN ALL CHAU THANH\'S 13 COMMUNES, BUT NOT TO THE 
NUMEROUS HAMLETS.  IN TAN PHU, CHAU THANH\'S MOST WELL-OFF 
COMMUNE, THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE INVESTED IN TRANSFORMERS 
AND DISTRIBUTION LINES, AND RE-SELLS ELECTRICITY BOUGHT 
FROM EVN TO 3,000 HOUSEHOLDS AT AN AVERAGE OF VND 1,000 
(7.1 CENTS) PER KWH.  AN AUSTRALIAN INVESTOR HAS DONE A 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TO SUPPLY FIVE TO SEVEN THOUSAND 
HOUSEHOLDS IN ANOTHER COMMUNE IN CHAU THANH AT VND 1,100- 
1,400 (7.9 CENTS TO 10 CENTS) PER KWH. 
 
6. RURAL EVN CUSTOMERS PAY A HOOK-UP CHARGE FROM VND 
800,000 TO 1,200,000 (USD 57 TO USD 86) AND AN AVERAGE 
RATE OF VND 360 (2.6 CENTS) PER KWH.  THE GVN HAS SET A 
CEILING PRICE OF VND 700 (5.0 CENTS) PER KWH FOR RE- 
SELLERS, WHOSE CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY A HOOK-UP CHARGE.  IN 
PRACTICE, HOWEVER, PRIVATE RE-SELLERS STRIKE AGREEMENTS 
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SELL AT HIGHER THAN THE LEGAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  02 OF 07  110410Z 
RATE, AND SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEMSELVES, SUCH AS IN 
TAN PHU, ALSO SELL AT A HIGHER RATE.  A GVN SURVEY IN 1998 
SHOWED 39 PERCENT OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS PAID MORE THAN THE 
LEGAL RATE, WITH PRICES IN SOME LOCALITIES AS HIGH AS 15 
CENTS PER KWH.  TRONG ATTRIBUTED ALLOWING A HIGHER PRICE 
TO \"BAD MANAGEMENT.\"   IN FACT, EVN WAS TRYING TO GET TAN 
PHU TO CUT ITS PRICE, HE SAID, BUT THE RISK WAS THAT THE 
CABLES WOULD BE CUT INSTEAD.  TRONG ALSO SAID THE 
AUSTRALIAN INVESTOR HAD THE SUPPORT OF THE CAN THO 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  AS ONE ARTICLE ON ELECTRICITY 
DISTRIBUTION IN VIETNAM HAS PUT IT, \"THE GOVERNMENT IS 
CAUGHT IN THE USUAL SPOT BETWEEN THE ROCK OF NEEDING TO 
IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HARD PLACE OF HAVING NO 
MONEY TO DO THE JOB.\" 
 
7. CONGEN STAFF SPOKE TO A TAN PHU CUSTOMER, WHO SAID 
AFTER SHE STARTED RECEIVING ELECTRICITY IN 1990, BUSINESS 
GOT BETTER AND LIFE BECAME MORE COMFORTABLE.  NOW, SHE CAN 
PRODUCE TWO SETS OF CLOTHES PER DAY IN HER TAILOR SHOP, 
OPENED A KARAOKE ROOM FOR CUSTOMERS, AND HAS ELECTRICAL 
APPLIANCES SUCH AS A WASHING MACHINE, TELEVISION, 
REFRIGERATOR, AND A RICE COOKER.  SHE SAID IN FACT, SHE 
PAID THE RESELLER VND 800 (5.7 CENTS) PER KHW FOR 
ELECTRICITY AND ANOTHER VND 600 (4.3 CENTS) PER KHW FOR 
\"MAINTENANCE.\"  SHE SAID SHE CAREFULLY MONITORED HER 
ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; IF THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY WENT 
UP, SHE\'D USE LESS, AND IF IT WENT DOWN, SHE\'D USE MORE. 
 
8. IN ANOTHER MODEL FOR RURAL ELECTRIFICATION BEYOND EVN\'S 
GRID, 135 HOUSEHOLDS IN TAN PHU ORGANIZED AN ELECTRICITY 
BUYING COOPERATIVE.  THEY BOUGHT THEIR OWN TRANSFORMER AND 
EACH PAID VARYING AMOUNTS TO HOOK-UP DEPENDING ON THEIR 
LOCATION.  INDIVIDUALS PAY AN AVERAGE OF VND 580 (4.1 
CENTS) PER KILOWATT HOUR.  THEIR ACTUAL BILL IS BASED ON 
DISTANCE FROM THE GRID, NOT CONSUMPTION, SINCE THE 
COOPERATIVE\'S CONSUMPTION IS METERED AS A GROUP.  IN A 
VARIATION ON THIS MODEL, THE GROUP LEADER INVESTS TO HOOK 
UP PRIVATE CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE COOPERATIVE.  THE 
COOPERATIVE LEADER IN TAN PHU BELIEVED THAT PEOPLE IN CHAU 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  03 OF 07  110730Z 
THANH DISTRICT WHO DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY YET WOULD BE 
WILLING TO PAY EVEN TWICE WHAT HIS MEMBERS PAY FOR 
ELECTRICITY OR EVEN HIGHER, \"UP TO A CERTAIN PRICE.\" 
 
PRIVATE WATER SUPPLIER BUMPS UP AGAINST OWN SUCCESS 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
9. EVEN FEWER RURAL VIETNAMESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO 
\"CLEAN\" WATER -- JUST 32 PERCENT ACCORDING TO MARD -- THAN 
TO ELECTRICITY.  AS WITH ELECTRICITY, A LACK OF CAPITAL 
HAS FORCED THE GVN TO ENCOURAGE COOPERATIVES AND PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT.  PRIVATE COMPANIES SUPPLIED WATER TO 4,000 
HOUSEHOLDS IN BEN TRE PROVINCE IN 1999 AND HAD INVESTED 
USD 1.4 MILLION, MORE THAN STATE INVESTMENT IN WATER 
SUPPLY.  VO VAN THUY\'S TAN AN PRIVATE COMPANY HAS FOUR 
WATER FILTERING PLANTS IN RURAL BEN TRE AND NEIGHBORING 
VINH LONG PROVINCE.  THUY, WHO HAD MONEY TO INVEST EARNED 
FROM BUYING AND TRANSPORTING LOGS IN CENTRAL VIETNAM, 
FIRST SAW DEMAND FOR WATER AS A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN 
HIS NATIVE VINH LONG IN 1996.  FRIENDS FROM VINH LONG\'S 
WATER SUPPLY COMPANY HELPED WITH THE DESIGN. 
 
10. TAN AN\'S CUSTOMERS IN TINH THANH COMMUNE OF CHO LACH 
DISTRICT PAY VND 2,500 (18 CENTS) PER CUBIC METER OF WATER 
IF THEY PAY FOR THE CONNECTING PIPELINES TO THEIR HOMES, 
OF VND 3,500 (25 CENTS) PER CUBIC METER IF TAN AN PAYS FOR 
HOOK-UP.  THE BEN TRE WATER SUPPLY COMPANIES CHARGES 
INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS VND 2,200 (16 CENTS), BUT CHARGES 
OTHER CUSTOMERS TWO HIGHER PRICES.  TAN AN\'S PRICE AND ANY 
CHANGES ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF BEN TRE\'S 
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.  THE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO TAN AN\'S 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  03 OF 07  110730Z 
HIGHER PRICE FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OVER THE PROTESTS OF 
THE TINH THANH PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE BECAUSE TAN AN HAS TO 
COVER A CORPORATE PROFIT TAX OF 32 PERCENT. 
 
11. THUY SAID HE IS NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE BEN TRE 
GOVERNMENT TAKING OVER HIS CUSTOMERS AS PUBLIC WATER 
SUPPLY EVENTUALLY EXPANDS, BECAUSE IT IS INEFFICIENT.  THE 
TWO 100 CUBIC METER-PER-DAY WATER PLANTS IN CHO LACH 
DISTRICT BUILT BY THE BEN TRE GOVERNMENT COST BETWEEN USD 
14,300 AND USD 17,900 TO BUILD AND WOULD ONLY HAVE COST 
THUY USD 10,700.  (IN FEBRUARY 2000 THE BEN TRE PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE SUSPENDED THE BEN TRE WATER SUPPPLY COMPANY\'S 
DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ACCOUNTANT FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, 
\"ILLEGAL COLLECTION AND SPENDING OF USD 100,000.)  THUY\'S 
PLANTS, WHICH ONLY REQUIRE ONE WORKER FOUR HOURS PER DAY 
TO OPERATE, BREAK EVEN AFTER 4-5 YEARS AND WILL LAST 30 
YEARS. 
 
12. THUY WANTS TO (###) 
PLANTS.  HE MADE PROPOSALS TO VINH LONG AND TRA VINH 
PROVINCES, BUT BOTH PREFERRED TO WAIT FOR FOREIGN DONORS 
TO FUND MORE EXPENSIVE WATER PLANTS.  (COMMENT:  FOR 
EXAMPLE, A DUTCH-FUNDED WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM 
IN DONG THAP PROVINCE SUPPLYING 10,200 CUBIC METERS OF 
WATER PER DAY COST USD 5.5 MILLION.  END COMMENT.)  THUY 
DOES NOT WANT TO BUILD MORE COMMUNE-LEVEL WATER PLANTS IN 
BEN TRE PROVINCE BECAUSE HE IS ALREADY SERVING THE THREE 
COMMUNES WITH THE STRONGEST DEMAND, AND HE IS CONCERNED 
THAT HIS KNOWN SUCCESS WOULD RESULT IN UNACCEPTABLY HIGH 
LAND LEASE COSTS. 
NOTE:  (##)OMISSION IN PARA 12.  CORRECTION WILL FOLLOW. 
 
 
COCONUT AND DURIAN DREAMS 
------------------------- 
 
13. RIVERINE BEN TRE PROVINCE IS VIETNAM\'S COCONUT 
CAPITAL, WITH 30,000 HECTARES AND ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF 200- 
220 MILLION COCONUTS.  TRADERS FROM HCMC AND HANOI 
CONVERGED ON BEN TRE IN 1995 TO BUY UP HAND-MADE COCONUT 
CANDY FOR EXPORT TO CHINA, STIMULATING THE CREATION OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  04 OF 07  110410Z 
MORE THAN 100 SMALL COMPANIES.  PRODUCTION ROSE TO 7 TONS 
PER DAY, THOUSANDS OF WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED, AND THE 
PROVINCE EARNED USD 10 MILLION.  BY 1997, CHINESE 
BUSINESSES IN HAINAN HAD HIRED AWAY SKILLED WORKERS FROM 
BEN TRE AND STARTED MAKING THEIR OWN COCONUT CANDY.  BEN 
TRE\'S CANDY EXPORT REVENUES FELL TO USD 300,000.  IN 1999, 
DEMAND FROM CHINA (MOSTLY FOR COCONUT JUICE BUT ALSO FOR 
CANDY) AND THAILAND RAISED THE PRICE OF COCONUTS IN BEN 
TRE TO VND 29,000 (USD 2.07) PER DOZEN.  ALTHOUGH THIS WAS 
GOOD FOR EXPORTERS OF UNPROCESSED AND SEMI-PROCESSED 
COCONUT PRODUCTS -- COCONUT EXPORTS WERE OVER USD 10 
MILLION IN 1999 -- IT FURTHER HARMED THE COCONUT CANDY AND 
OTHER COCONUT PROCESSING INDUSTRIES.  THESE INCLUDE 
COCONUT OIL, CHARCOAL, JUICE, HANDICRAFTS, AND 
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.  BY LATE 1999, ONLY 27 CANDY 
MAKERS, 6 OF 33 OIL PRODUCERS, AND 30 OF 55 CHARCOAL 
PRODUCERS WERE STILL OPERATING. 
 
14. CONGEN STAFF CALLED ON MS. PHAM THI TO, WHOSE 
BESPECTACLED IMAGE ADORNS HER BRANDED \"BEN TRE COCONUT 
CANDY,\" FOR WHICH SHE REGISTERED HER TRADEMARK IN 1988. 
ABANDONED BY HER HUSBAND AND LEFT WITH EIGHT YOUNG 
CHILDREN, MS. TO\'S FORTUNES BEGAN TO CHANGE IN 1976 WHEN 
SHE LEARNED HOW TO MAKE COCONUT CANDY, IMPROVED THE 
RECIPE, AND MUCH LATER MECHANIZED PRODUCTION.  SINCE THE 
GOVERNMENT STRICTLY CONTROLLED RICE, SUGAR, AND COCONUTS, 
HER MAIN INGREDIENTS, SHE CONDUCTED BUSINESS UNDERGROUND 
AND INTERMITTENTLY FOR 12 YEARS.  BY 1988, WHEN THE GVN 
BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THE DOI MOI POLICY, MS. TO RECEIVED A 
LOAN FROM THE LOCAL WOMEN\'S UNION AND EXPANDED HER 
BUSINESS.  (SHE HAS MOSTLY SELF-FINANCED AND HAS NEVER HAD 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  04 OF 07  110410Z 
A BANK LOAN.)  OTHER FACTORIES IN BEN TRE AND HAININ ARE 
HER IMITATORS. 
 
15. IT WAS ONE OF MS. TO\'S AGENTS WHO INTRODUCED HER CANDY 
TO THE CHINESE MARKET.  WHEN HER SALES TO CHINA DROPPED 
OFF FROM A PEAK OF 400 TONS PER MONTH, MS. TO TRAVELLED TO 
CHINA IN 1998 AND A DISCOVERED ONE HAINAN COMPANY 
IMITATING HER TRADEMARK AND PACKAGING.  (THE CHINESE 
COMPANY DIRECTOR WAS MARRIED TO A VIETNAMESE WOMAN FROM 
BEN TRE, AND THEY HAD HIRED AWAY A TECHNICIAN FROM MS. 
TO.)  TRAVELLING TO CHINA AGAIN, SHE FILED PETITIONS TO 
REGISTER HER TRADEMARK THERE AND TO PROHIBIT ITS MISUSE BY 
HER CHINESE COMPETITOR, CULMINATING IN A SUCCESSFUL 
ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE INFRINGER IN 1999. 
ALTHOUGH HER SALES WERE STILL DOWN 80 TONS PER MONTH AND 
HER WORKFORCE DOWN TO 400 FROM A HIGH OF 1,000 WORKERS, 
MS. TO WAS OPTIMISTIC SHE THEY WOULD SOON BE BACK AT THEIR 
1995-1997 LEVELS. 
 
16. MOST COCONUT FARMERS PRODUCE A LOW-YIELD VARIETY 
DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF HIGH-YIELD HYBRIDS.  MOST 
SURVIVE ON INCOMES OF LITTLE MORE THAN VND 1.0 MILLION 
(USD 71) PER YEAR, EXTREME POVERTY EVEN BY VIETNAMESE 
STANDARDS.  CONGEN STAFF VISITED MR. DO THANH THUONG, 
DUBBED VIETNAM\'S COCONUT KING AFTER WINNING A PRIZE FROM 
THE ASIA PACIFIC COCONUT COUNCIL (APCC) FOR HIS TECHNIQUES 
FOR TRANSPLANTING HYBRID COCONUT TREES DEVELOPED BY THE 
GVN\'S VEGETABLE OIL RESEARCH INSTITUTE.  THE PB-121 HYBRID 
HAS HIGHER YIELDS, GREATER FAT CONTENT, AND BEARS FRUIT 
EARLIER.  THUONG DARED TO REPLACE HIS TREES WITH THE 
HYBRID IN 1995 ON HIS 2.5 HECTARES OF LAND AT A TIME WHEN 
HIS NEIGHBORS WERE CUTTING DOWN THEIR TREES BECAUSE OF LOW 
PROFITS.  A 63-YEAR-OLD GRADUATE IN PHYSICS, THUONG 
COMPLAINED THAT ALTHOUGH HE WAS INVITED TO TRAVEL ABROAD 
TO ACCEPT APCC PRIZE, A STATE COMPANY OFFICIAL WAS SENT TO 
COLLECT IT FOR HIM.  COCONUT PRICES HAD DROPPED WAY DOWN 
AGAIN IN 2000 FROM THEIR 1999 PEAK AND WERE NOW VND 13,000 
(93 CENTS) PER DOZEN. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  05 OF 07  110411Z 
17. EVEN AT THE PEAK, THUONG SAID, COCONUT FARMERS COULD 
NOT EARN AS MUCH AS FROM PLANTING FRUIT TREES, ALTHOUGH 
THE LATTER REQUIRED MORE INVESTMENT AND WAS HARDER WORK. 
COCONUT FARMERS WERE AT THE MERCY OF TRADERS, WHO DIVIDED 
UP THE MARKET AND COLLUDED WITH EACH OTHER, AND WOULD BE 
BETTER OFF IF THEY COULD MARKET THEIR OWN OUTPUT OR SELL 
DIRECTLY TO PROCESSING FACTORIES, HE THOUGHT.  THEIR 
BIGGEST PROBLEM WAS NEVER KNOWING THE CURRENT MARKET 
PRICE.  THE GOVERNMENT HAD NOT BEEN OF ANY USE IN 
PROVIDING PRICE INFORMATION, AND EVEN ITS AGRICULTURAL 
EXTENSION WORKERS LEARNED MORE FROM THE FARMERS THAN 
HELPED THE FARMERS.  THE DONG GO COCONUT RESEARCH CENTER 
IN BEN TRE DID NOT SEEM TO BE DOING MUCH, AND THUONG AND 
HIS NEIGHBORS CONDUCTED THEIR OWN SOIL ANALYSIS FOR 
DIVERSIFICATION INTO OTHER FRUIT CROPS.  (COMMENT:  THE 
DONG GO CENTER IS GROWING 47 STRAINS OF COCONUT WITH 
FUNDING FROM FAO AND UNDP.  END COMMENT.) 
 
18. IN ADDITION TO THE COCONUT KING, BEN TRE IS ALSO HOME 
TO VIETNAM\'S DURIAN KING, NGUYEN KHOA CHIEN (NICKNAMED 
CHIN HOA, BEING THE NINTH SON OF HIS PARENTS).  IN 1978, A 
SINGLE DURIAN TREE OF A NEARLY EXTINCT VARIETY REMAINED 
AMONG THE OTHER DURIAN TREES ON THE FAMILY PROPERTY. 
CHIEN SUCCEEDED IN GRAFTING SPRIGS FROM THIS RARE STRAIN 
ONTO OTHER TREES, CREATING THE LOCALLY CHERISHED \"FLAT 
SEED DURIAN\" OR \"CHIN HOA DURIAN,\" WHICH IS SWEET 
SMELLING, HAS THICK PULP, AND VERY SMALL SEEDS.  HE THEN 
WENT TO WORK ON PLANTING TREES GROWN FROM THIS HYBRID AND 
SELLING SEEDLINGS PRODUCED FROM THE TREES, KEEPING UP TO 
DATE ON CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING AFTER-SALES 
TECHNICAL ADVICE, AND OBTAINING GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  05 OF 07  110411Z 
HIS VARIETY.  HIS DURIANS ARE SO POPULAR THAT HE RATIONS 
SALES OF HIS OUTPUT TO FAVORED CUSTOMERS AND COULD GET 
AWAY WITH CHARGING MUCH MORE IF CHOSE. 
 
19. CHIEN\'S AFTER-TAX ANNUAL INCOME FROM THE SALES OF 57 
TONS OF DURIAN AND THOUSANDS OF SEEDLINGS IS OVER VND 1.0 
BILLION (USD 714,000), MAKING HIM ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN 
IN THE MEKONG DELTA (CERTAINLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER 
WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT).  HIS HOUSE IN CHO LACH 
DISTRICT, HOWEVER, IS ON A NARROW, MUD TRAIL A KILOMETER 
OFF THE MAIN ROAD AND STILL HAS A THATCHED ROOF AND HARD 
MUD FLOOR.  ACCORDING TO CHIEN, VIETNAM\'S DURIANS, LIKE 
THAILAND\'S, CAN BE EXPORTED, SINCE THEY RIPEN FOR FOUR 
DAYS AFTER HARVESTING AND REMAIN EDIBLE FOR A WEEK AFTER, 
LONGER IF REFRIGERATED AND LONGER STILL IF FROZEN. 
ALTHOUGH MORE FARMERS ARE PLANTING DURIAN CURRENTLY, 
VOLUMES ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A STEADY SUPPLY FOR 
EXPORT.  DURIAN PRODUCTION IS EXPANDING IN BINH DUONG AND 
BINH PHUOC PROVINCES, WHERE THE LAND IS BETTER AND THE 
SOIL MORE SUITABLE FOR DURIANS.  A COMPANY IN BUON ME 
THUOT IN DAK LAK PROVINCE HAS PLANTED 4,000 TREES USING 
CHIEN\'S SEEDS AND PLANS TO EXPORT. 
 
NICEST PLACE IN BEN TRE TOWN IS THE ORPHANAGE 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
20. BEN TRE TOWN, THE CENTER OF BEN TRE PROVINCE, HAS NO 
HOTELS OR RESTAURANTS AT A STANDARD WHICH WOULD APPEAL TO 
FOREIGN VISITORS.  THE PROVINCE, TRULY ONE OF VIETNAM\'S 
BACKWATERS, HAS RECEIVED SPECIAL ATTENTION FROM UNDP FOR 
POVERTY ALLEVIATION (REF A).  SO IT SEEMS A BIT ODD THAT 
THE EEM GROUP OF FRANCE, OWNER OF THE SUCCESSFUL VICTORIA 
CHAIN OF HOTELS IN SAPA, CAN THO, CHAU DOC, AND PHAN THIET 
AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN HOI AN, HAS BEGUN CONSTRUCTION 
OF A HOTEL IN TOWN.  (THIS IS ONE OF ONLY TWO FOREIGN 
INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF BEN TRE, AND THE OTHER ONE IS NOT 
OPERATING YET, EITHER.  EEM HAS WITHDRAWN FROM PLANS TO 
ALSO BUILD AN ECO-TOURISM ISLAND RESORT IN A MEKONG RIVER 
ESTUARY IN CHAU THANH DISTRICT IN BEN TRE.)  VO VINH BINH, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01121  06 OF 07  110733Z 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EEM\'S JOINT VENTURE, EXPLAINED THAT A 
PORTION OF THE HUNDREDS OF FOREIGN TOURISTS WHO TAKE DAY 
TRIPS FROM HCMC TO MY THO IN TIEN GIANG PROVINCE AND CROSS 
INTO BEN TRE PROVINCE WOULD WANT TO STAY OVERNIGHT, SINCE 
THIS IS A TIRING ONE-DAY TRIP.  AS WITH OTHER VICTORIA 
HOTELS, THE LOCAL JOINT VENTURE PARTNER WILL HAVE ITS OWN 
BLOC OF ROOMS IT WILL SELL AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. 
 
21. IN 10 DIFFERENT CITIES IN VIETNAM, ONE NOTICES GATED 
SPACIOUS COMPOUNDS WITH MODERN BUILDINGS AND SPACIOUS, 
GREEN GROUNDS THAT LOOK DISTINCTLY UN-VIETNAMESE.  THESE 
ARE SOS VILLAGES FOR ABANDONED, ORPHANED AND DESTITUTE 
CHILDREN, FUNDED BY THE AUSTRIAN-BASED, INTERNATIONAL NGO 
SOS-KINDERDORF INTERNATIONAL (S-K).  IN BEN TRE, THE SOS 
VILLAGE, JUST OPENED IN 1999, STANDS OUT EVEN MORE THAN 
USUAL.  ACCORDING TO ITS DIRECTOR, HUYNH CONG BINH, BEN 
TRE WAS IDENTIFIED IN 1995 AS A LOCATION FOR AN SOS 
VILLAGE BY THE S-K REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN HANOI AND THE 
GVN BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF ORPHANED, DISABLED, OR 
ABANDONED CHILDREN IN THE PROVINCE, PUT AT 7-8 PERCENT. 
THE VILLAGE CAN ACCOMMODATE 12 \"FAMILIES\" OF 9-10 CHILDREN 
EACH OF DIFFERENT AGES AND GENDER LIVING IN IMMACULATE 
HOUSES NAMED AFTER FLOWERS.  AFTER THAY ARE FOURTEEN, 
CHILDREN ARE HOUSED SEPARATELY BY GENDER BUT ARE STILL 
PART OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES.  EACH FAMILY IS HEADED 
BY A SINGLE WOMAN WHO MAKES A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.  AT 
THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 2000, THE BEN TRE SOS VILLAGE 
HAD SET UP 9 FAMILIES AND HAD A TOTAL OF 70 CHILDREN. 
 
22. BEN TRE PROVINCE PROVIDED THE LARGE, WELL-LOCATED 45 
HECTARE PLOT OF LAND FOR THE VILLAGE AND FREE MEDICAL CARE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01121  06 OF 07  110733Z 
AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION FOR THE VILLAGE\'S 
CHILDREN.  S-K PROVIDED THE DESIGN FOR THE VILLAGE, FUNDED 
ITS CONSTRUCTION, AND WILL PAY FOR HIGH SCHOOL AND 
UNIVERSITY FEES AND BOOKS, AND FOR JOB SEARCHES UPON 
GRADUATION.  IT WILL ALSO FUND CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR VILLAGE AND LOCAL CHILDREN. TOTAL 
CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE NEARLY USD 1.5 MILLION.  OPERATING 
COSTS COME OUT TO JUST OVER USD 20 PER CHILD PER MONTH, 
INCLUDING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND ARE FUNDED BY 
INTERNATIONAL DONORS.  TYPICALLY, HOUSE MOTHERS HAVE TO 
SCRIMP TO MAKE THEIR FOOD BUDGETS STRETCH AND GROW THEIR 
OWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES.  AT FIRST, LOCAL RESIDENTS 
BELIEVED THE VILLAGE\'S CHILDREN WERE BEING GIVEN MORE 
ADVANTAGES THAN THEIR OWN, BUT THE VILLAGE CONDUCTED 
PUBLIC RELATIONS AND RESIDENTS SAW THAT THE LIVING 
STANDARD INSIDE THE VILLAGE WAS NOT HIGHER THAN (#####) 
CHILDREN\'S BACKGROUNDS. 
 
23. THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN THE PROVINCE UNDER 
NINE-YEARS-OLD WHO WERE NOT DISABLED OR SICK, WHO WERE 
EITHER ORPHANS, HAD ONE PARENT BUT WERE ABANDONED, OR WHO 
WERE ABUSED, WERE CONSIDERED FOR PLACEMENT IN THE VILLAGE. 
A SURVEY SHOWED 190 CHILDREN MET THESE CONDITIONS, AND 
THOSE WITH THE LEAST ALTERNATIVE SUPPORT WERE SELECTED. 
THE PLACEMENT PROCESS IS ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW AND 
 
NOTE:  (##)OMISSION IN PARA 22.  CORRECTION WILL FOLLOW. 
 
 
REGULATION AND IS SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW IF BLOOD 
RELATIONS DISPUTE THE DECISION.  BINH SAID THE SOS VILLAGE 
WELCOMES VISITS AND DONATIONS, WHICH GO TO THE OPERATING 
BUDGET, FROM ALL GROUPS, AS THE CHILDREN NEED ATTENTION SO 
THEY DO NOT FEEL ABANDONED BY SOCIETY.  CONGEN STAFF FOUND 
THE CHILDREN EXTREMELY POLITE, LOQUACIOUS, AND EAGER TO 
SHOW OFF THEIR NEATLY PUT AWAY TOYS AND ARTWORK AFTER 
BEING INVITED TO DO SO.

REF:  HCMC 1135 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  VIETNAM\'S FIRST OFFICIAL STOCK MARKET, THE HO CHI MINH 
CITY SECURITIES TRADING CENTER (STC), OPENED JULY 20 WITH 
GREAT FANFARE.  ALTHOUGH THE OPENING OF A SECURITIES MARKET, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT CAME ON THE HEELS OF SIGNING THE 
BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, IS SIGNIFICANT AS A SYMBOL OF 
CONTINUED ECONOMIC REFORM, ITS PRACTICAL IMPACT LIKELY WILL 
BE NEGLIGIBLE IN THE SHORT-TERM.  ONLY FOUR COMPANIES WILL 
BE LISTED INITIALLY, FOREIGN PARTICIPATION IS LIMITED, 
FLUCTUATION MARGINS ARE TIGHTLY CONTROLLED, AND BALANCE 
SHEETS OF LISTED COMPANIES WILL REMAIN OPAQUE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
STOCK MARKET OPENS 
------------------ 
2.  THE HO CHI MINH CITY SECURITIES TRADING CENTER (STC) 
OPENED JULY 20 IN AN AS-YET UNREFURBISHED 85-YEAR-OLD 
BUILDING LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE CITY.  ACTING CONSUL 
GENERAL JOHN ATTENDED THE OPENING, WHICH FEATURED A RIBBON- 
CUTTING LED BY FORMER PRIME MINISTER AND PARTY ADVISOR VO 
VAN KIET, AND AN OPENING SPEECH BY FIRST DEPUTY PRIME 
MINISTER NGUYEN TAN DUNG. THE EVENT, WHICH ATTRACTED A LARGE 
AUDIENCE OF LOCAL AND FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN, THE CONSULAR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01176  01 OF 02  212139Z 
CORPS, AND INTERNATIONAL PRESS, TOOK PLACE AMIDST UNUSUALLY 
TIGHT SECURITY, WITH SURROUNDING STREETS BLOCKED TO NORMAL 
TRAFFIC. 
 
3.  DPM DUNG TOLD THE AUDIENCE THAT THE OPENING OF THE STC 
DEMONSTRATED THE GVN\'S \"FIRM DETERMINATION TO BUILD EVER 
UNIFORM MARKET COMPONENTS OF THE ECONOMY.\"  THIS SENTIMENT 
WAS ECHOED IN THE INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS BY NGUYEN DUC QUANG, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION, WHO NOTED THAT 
THE CREATION OF THE STC WAS THE NATURAL NEXT STEP IN 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR VIETNAM.  QUANG CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, 
THAT THE TWO YEARS PREPARATORY PERIOD FOR THE OPENING WAS 
INADEQUATE FOR SUCH A LARGE TASK, BUT THAT THE LIMITED 
OPENING WAS \"AN IMPORTANT REHEARSAL FOR A MODERN AND 
DEVELOPED STOCK MARKET IN THE FUTURE.\" 
 
NUMEROUS CONSTRAINTS 
-------------------- 
4.  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, THE MARKET WILL OPERATE UNDER 
NUMEROUS TRADING CONSTRAINTS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT 
ONLY FOUR COMPANIES WILL BE LISTED INITIALLY.  PRICES WILL 
NOT BE PERMITTED TO FLUCTUATE MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT DAILY, 
AND STRINGENT CAPS WILL BE SET ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. 
MOREOVER, THESE CAPS DICTATE THAT IT WILL BE VIRTUALLY 
IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE MANDATED SINGLE PRICE ON SHARES, 
SINCE THEY CREATE A VIRTUAL SECOND MARKET FOR FOREIGN 
INVESTORS. 
 
OPINIONS OF FOREIGN BANKERS MIXED 
----------------------------------- 
5.  A SEASONED AMERICAN BANKER TOLD ACG ON THE EVE OF THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01176  01 OF 02  212139Z 
OPENING THAT THE STOCK MARKET \"WAS A JOKE.\"  THIS OBSERVER 
FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THE PROBLEMS CITED ABOVE, BUT ALSO ON 
THE OPAQUE NATURE OF VIETNAMESE BOOKKEEPING STANDARDS. 
UNTIL TRANSPARENCY IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, FOREIGN INVESTORS 
WOULD LIKELY IGNORE THE STC.  HOWEVER, ANOTHER AMERICAN 
MERCHANT BANKER (WHO WAS DISTRIBUTING FLYERS FOR HIS 
MERCHANT BANK AT THE OPENING CEREMONY) TOLD ACG THAT THE 
POTENTIAL FOR THE MARKET 24 MONTHS OUT WAS SIGNIFICANT.  HE 
PREDICTED THAT THERE WOULD BE 150 TO 200 COMPANIES LISTED BY 
THAT TIME, AND THAT INDUSTRY AND SECTORAL FUNDS, SUCH AS 
HIS, WOULD BE REWARDING FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS. 
 
COMMENT: A POSITIVE START; SUBSTANCE TO FOLLOW? 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
6.  COMING ON THE HEELS OF THE SIGNING OF THE BTA, THE 
OPENING OF THE STOCK MARKET ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT 
INTERNATIONAL PRESS ATTENTION THAT CENTERED ON VIETNAM\'S 
TRANSFORMING ECONOMY.  ALTHOUGH THE OPENING OF THE MARKET IS 
SYMBOLICALLY SIGNIFICANT, REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND 
CORPORATE PRACTICES INDICATE THAT THE MARKET WILL HAVE 
MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE VIETNAMESE ECONOMY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
VIETNAM WILL HAVE TO WORK HARD ON SUPERVISING THE NEW 
MARKET.  IF THE NEW MARKET CAN CAPTURE SOME OF THE INFORMAL 
TRADING ACTIVITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKING PLACE, ALL THE 
BETTER.  THAT HO CHI MINH CITY IS THE VENUE FOR VIETNAM\'S 
FIRST STOCK MARKET IS ALSO GOOD.  DESPITE THE PERSISTENT 
BACKWARDNESS OF ECONOMIC THEORY IN THE NORTH, HO CHI MINH 
CITY\'S ECONOMY IS `DE FACTO\' TAKING ON MANY OF THE 
CHARACTERISTICS OF MARKET ORIENTATION.

SUBJECT: PROVINCIAL ADVENTURES 
 
 
1. (U): POLOFF RECENTLY TRAVELED TO LONG AN PROVINCE JUST 
SOUTH OF HO CHI MINH CITY ON THE LAST LEG OF A TRIP 
THROUGH THE MEKONG DELTA.  HE CHECKED INTO A NEW PRIVATELY 
OWNED HOTEL RATHER THAN THE GOVERNMENT-OWNED GUESTHOUSE. 
AFTER DINNER WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROVINCIAL 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (WHICH POLOFF PAID FOR), HE RETURNED TO 
THE HOTEL TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT.  WITH PROFUSE 
APOLOGIES, THE HOTEL PROPRIETOR INFORMED HIM THAT HE COULD 
NOT STAY AT THE HOTEL.  THE LOCAL POLICE HAD TOLD HER THAT 
AS POLOFF WAS THE GUEST OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, HE HAD 
TO STAY AT THE GOVERNMENT GUESTHOUSE UNLESS HE HAD 
SPECIFIC PERMISSION FROM THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO STAY 
ELSEWHERE.  THIS, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, WAS FOR THE 
PROTECTION OF THE DIPLOMAT. 
 
3. (U) POLOFF REFUSED TO CALL THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO 
ASK PERMISSION TO STAY AT A PRIVATE HOTEL AND REMOVED HIS 
LUGGAGE FROM THE ROOM HE HAD ALREADY CHECKED INTO.  BUT HE 
ALSO REFUSED TO CHECK INTO THE GOVERNMENT GUESTHOUSE. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00183  230859Z 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS ALREADY AFTER 10:00 P.M., HE CONSIDERED 
GOING ON TO HO CHI MINH CITY (ABOUT AN HOUR\'S DRIVE AWAY). 
IN THE END, HOWEVER, HE FOUND A SMALL PRIVATELY OWNED 
GUESTHOUSE IN BEN LUC VILLAGE STILL IN LONG AN PROVINCE 
WHERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT.  THE GUESTHOUSE WAS SINGULARLY 
LACKING IN AMENITIES, BUT IT WAS WORTH STAYING THERE JUST 
TO PROVE A POINT. 
 
4. (U) NEXT MORNING, POLOFF WENT TO SEE A SCHOOL BUILDING 
NEARBY THAT HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE U.S. ARMY 46TH 
ENGINEERING BATTALION IN 1968.  WHILE POLOFF WAS TAKING 
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE BUILDING, A LONG AN POLICEMAN ARRIVED 
AND INFORMED HIM THAT TAKING PICTURES OF \"SENSITIVE 
INSTALLATIONS\" WAS PROHIBITED.  POLOFF RETORTED THAT THIS 
WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD AN OLD SCHOOLHOUSE 
REFERRED TO AS A SENSITIVE INSTALLATION, BUT SINCE HE HAD 
ALREADY TAKEN ALL THE PHOTOS HE NEEDED HE PUT THE CAMERA 
AWAY.  ON THE WAY TO THE MAIN ROAD, HOWEVER, POLOFF 
STOPPED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ANOTHER, NEWER SCHOOL AND 
SNAPPED A FEW MORE PICTURES, AGAIN JUST TO PROVE A POINT. 
BECAUSE OF THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW IN LONG AN IT WILL BE A 
LONG TIME BEFORE THE PROVINCE SEES ANOTHER CONGEN VISITOR. 
 
AND AN UNSCHEDULED MEETING IN VINH LONG PROVINCE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (U) POLOFF HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS IN VINH LONG PROVINCE DURING HIS VISIT TO THE 
MEKONG DELTA.  WHILE IN THE PROVINCE, POLOFF NOTICED IN A 
TOURIST BOOK THAT THE MAIN PAGODA OF VIETNAM\'S MENDICANT 
BUDDHIST SECT (THE MONKS WHO GO AROUND BEGGING FOR ALMS) 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00183  230859Z 
WAS LOCATED IN VINH LONG TOWN.  WHEN POLOFF MENTIONED TO 
HIS PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HOSTS THAT HE WOULD LIKE 
TO STOP BY THE PAGODA DURING A BREAK IN THE SCHEDULE, THEY 
SAID THE HEAD MONK WAS BUSY AND WOULDN\'T BE ABLE TO MEET. 
WHEN POLOFF SUGGESTED HE JUST WANTED TO GO AS A TOURIST, 
HIS HOSTS PROTESTED, \"BUT THIS WAS NOT ON YOUR PROPOSED 
ITINERARY.\"  NEXT DAY, AFTER THE OFFICIAL MEETINGS HAD 
CONCLUDED, POLOFF WENT TO THE PAGODA ANYWAY.  THE HEAD 
MONK THERE WAS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MEET WITH HIM.

SUBJECT: IMI: HOTEL OCCUPANCY REBOUNDS, TOURISM CAMPAIGN LIMPS 
 
1. HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) RECEIVED 1.1 MILLION 
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS IN 2000, OF WHICH 793,000 WERE 
TOURISTS.  307,000 OF THE 1.1 MILLION TOURISTS WERE PEOPLE 
OF VIETNAMESE ORIGIN RESIDING OUTSIDE OF VIETNAM.  HOTEL 
ROOM OCCUPANCY RATES IN HCMC AVERAGED 42 PERCENT, UP TWO 
PERCENT OVER 1999, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ROOM CHARGES. 
HOTELS UNDER STATE-OWNED SAIGONTOURIST CORPORATION HAD 
OCCUPANCY RATES REACH 68 PERCENT, UP 11 PERCENT, AND SOME 
OF THE TOP FOREIGN-INVESTED HOTELS HAVE EVEN REACHED 100 
PERCENT OCCUPANCY SOME NIGHTS IN FEBRUARY AND ARE FULLY 
BOOKED FOR SOME NIGHTS IN MARCH. 
 
2. ACCORDING TO THE MARRIOTT-OWNED NEW WORLD HOTEL, 
LEISURE TRAVEL HAS PICKED UP FROM JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES, 
AND CHINA FROM INCREASED EXPOSURE IN PRINT ARTICLES AND 
TELEVISION SEGMENTS (FREE ADVERTISING).  THE LIMITED 
NUMBER OF FLIGHTS INTO VIETNAM FROM THE MAIN FEEDER CITIES 
OF BANGKOK, SINGAPORE, AND HONG KONG, HOWEVER, IS MAKING 
IT OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR TOUR OPERATORS TO SECURE FLIGHTS 
FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.  THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INCREASE IN

PAGE 03        HO CHI  00197  280506Z 
BUSINESS TRAVELERS FROM THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES 
EXPECTING A PICK-UP IN TRADE ONCE THE U.S.-VIETNAM 
BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT IS RATIFIED.  ALTHOUGH NOT 100 
PERCENT FINALIZED, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE LONG-MOTHBALLED, 
JAPANESE-INVESTED MARRIOTT HOTEL IN HCMC WILL OPEN IN 
SEPTEMBER THIS YEAR.  NO OTHER MAJOR HOTELS ARE EXPECTED 
TO OPEN IN HCMC THIS YEAR BESIDES THE MARRIOTT. 
 
3. ADVISED BY A LOCAL PUBLIC RELATIONS FIRM THAT VIETNAM 
SHOULD USE PUBLIC RELATIONS SERVICES TO MOUNT A FOREIGN- 
AIMED CAMPAIGN, A VIETNAM ADMINISTRATION OF TOURISM (VNAT) 
OFFICIAL COUNTERED THAT VIETNAM\'S DESTINATION FOR A NEW 
MILLENNIUM CAMPAIGN BEGUN IN 2000 WAS ALREADY QUITE 
SUCCESSFUL.  MANAGERS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY ARE 
UNANIMOUS, HOWEVER, IN NOTING THAT THE CAMPAIGN LACKS A 
HEALTHY BUDGET AND MARKETING SAVVY, EXPENDITURES ARE 
SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY APPROVAL PROCESS BY THE MINISTRY OF 
FINANCE, AND EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE TAKEN PLACE ALMOST 
ENTIRELY IN VIETNAM.  A HONG KONG MARKETING FIRM ESTIMATES 
VIETNAM SHOULD SPEND BETWEEN USD 8 MILLION AND USD 28 
MILLION TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN.  VNAT, 
HOWEVER, ONLY MANAGED TO SPEND HALF OF THE USD 1.3 MILLION 
EARMARKED FOR IT IN 1999 AND 2000 FOR MARKETING BECAUSE OF 
THE COMPLICATED PROCEDURES FOR DISBURSEMENT.  FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE HEAD OF A FOREIGN HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY RELATED TO 
CONGEN THAT VNAT TOOK NEARLY A YEAR TO SETTLE BILLS 
TOTALING LESS THAN USD 20,000 FOR A DELEGATION WHICH WENT 
TO A COUNTRY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND STAGED EVENTS 
AT HOTELS MANAGED BY THE FOREIGN COMPANY IN 2000.  IN THE 
FUTURE, HE SAID, HIS COMPANY WOULD REQUIRE PAYMENT UP 
FRONT.

SUBJECT: NOTES ON FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY FROM OFFICIAL VIETNAMESE MEDIA SOURCES 
 
1. SUMMARY: FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY SUBMITTED WRITTEN 
TESTIMONY HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT TO 
THE COMMISSION FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, WHICH 
HELD HEARINGS IN WASHINGTON ON FEBRUARY 13.  FATHER LY HAS 
SINCE BEEN PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST AND HAS BEEN THE 
TARGET OF EXTREMELY CHARGED ARTICLES IN THE VIETNAMESE 
MEDIA.  TWO ARTICLES, ONE IN NHAN DAN AND THE OTHER IN 
TUOI TRE, BOTH DATED MARCH 8, INCLUDE BIOGRAPHICAL 
INFORMATION AND OTHER INFORMATION ON HIS RECENT PROBLEMS 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT, SOME OF WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN 
TO POST.  FOLLOWING ARE NOTES EXTRACTED FROM THESE 
ARTICLES THAT MAY BE USEFUL BACKGROUND FOR THOSE READERS 
FOLLOWING THIS ISSUE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. NGUYEN VAN LY WAS BORN IN 1946 IN QUANG TRI PROVINCE. 
HE GRADUATED FROM HUE GRAND SEMINARY IN 1974, AND LATER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00260  120151Z 
THAT YEAR BECAME A SECRETARY OF THE HUE ARCHBISHOP\'S 
OFFICE.  IN SEPTEMBER 1977, HE WAS ARRESTED FOR 
DISSEMINATING DOCUMENTS WITH ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY CONTENT. 
HE WAS NOT PROSECUTED AT THAT TIME, HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH HE 
WAS DISMISSED FROM THE ARCHBISHOP\'S OFFICE AND TRANSFERRED 
TO DOC SO PARISH IN HUE CITY.  FATHER LY WAS ARRESTED 
AGAIN AND SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IMPRISONMENT ON DECEMBER 
9, 1983.  (NOTE: THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES SAY HE WAS 
DISMISSED FROM DOC SO PARISH IN 1981 - THIS MAY BE THE 
YEAR HE WAS ARRESTED.) 
 
3. HAVING SERVED HIS TERM IN PRISON, FATHER LY RETURNED TO 
THE HUE ARCHBISHOP\'S OFFICE.  ON NOVEMBER 24, 1994, HE 
DISTRIBUTED A DOCUMENT CLAIMING GOVERNMENT REPRESSION OF 
RELIGION.  THE ARTICLES THEN SAY \"THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE 
OF THAU THIEN-HUE PROVINCE DECIDED TO FORCE HIM TO RESIDE 
IN... PHUONG DUC PARISH, HUE CITY.\" 
 
4. ON NOVEMBER 10, 2000, FATHER LY WAS AT THE CENTER OF A 
CONFRONTATION REGARDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN IRRIGATION 
WORK NEAR THE CHURCH.  THE ARTICLES SAY, \"WHEN THE LOCAL 
ADMINISTRATION INVITED HIM TO ITS OFFICE TO RESOLVE THE 
PROBLEM RELATING TO THE LOCAL SECURITY AND ORDER, HE TORE 
UP THE INVITATION PAPER IN THE FACE OF THE LOCAL CADRE.\" 
 
5. FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, FATHER LY WAS TRANSFERRED TO 
AN TRUYEN PARISH IN PHU VANG DISTRICT, A COASTAL DISTRICT 
OF THUA THIEN-HUE PROVINCE, JUST EAST OF HUE CITY.  INSIDE 
THE CHURCH COMPOUND, FATHER LY HUNG BANNERS WITH SLOGANS 
SAYING \"WE DEMAND FREEDOM\" AND \"FREEDOM OF RELIGION OR 
DEATH.\" 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00260  120151Z 
 
6. THE ARTICLES THEN GO ON TO REPORT INTERVIEWS OF PEOPLE 
FROM THE DISTRICT WHO ARE QUOTED DENOUNCING FATHER LY AND 
HIS ANTI-GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
7. THE ABOVE PROVIDES SOME BACKGROUND INTO FATHER LY\'S 
ENCOUNTERS WITH THE GOVERNMENT WHICH HAVE LED UP TO HIS 
RECENT HOUSE ARREST.  THE ATTENTION BEING GIVEN TO THE 
PRIEST AND THE VICIOUSNESS OF THE JOURNALISTIC ATTACKS ON 
HIM DEMONSTRATE THE GVN\'S HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITIES IN THE 
DAYS LEADING UP TO THE PARTY CONGRESS AND THE DAYS 
FOLLOWING THE TURBULENCE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.

SUBJECT: COMMUNIST PARTY LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES (PART 2) 
 
REF:  A. 00 HCMC 0231  B. 00 HCMC 0230 
 
1. SUMMARY: AS THE DE FACTO POLICY-SETTERS IN THE PROVINCES, 
PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE LEADERS DETERMINE TO A 
LARGE DEGREE WHETHER THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCES ARE 
PROGRESSIVE OR BACKWARD LOOKING.  COMMUNIST PARTY CONGRESSES 
HELD IN THE 29 SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES AND CITIES 
(HCMC AND DANANG) IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY WERE THE FIRST 
PARTY CONGRESSES TO TAKE PLACE SINCE CONGEN OPENED, 
PROVIDING POST\'S FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE NEW PROVINCIAL 
PARTY LEADERSHIP TEAMS.  WOMEN AND MINORITIES REMAIN 
SUBSTANTIALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED AT THESE HIGHEST POLICY- 
SETTING POSITIONS.  INDIVIDUALS HOLDING TOP POSITIONS AMONG 
PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEES, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES, AND 
PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL DEMONSTRATE THE INTERLOCKING RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN THESE AGENCIES (DISCUSSED IN PARA THREE).  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. SEPTEL LISTS THE NEW PROVINCIAL PARTY LEADERS PROVINCE BY 
PROVINCE.  THIS REPORT EXAMINES THE CHANGES IN PROVINCIAL 
PARTY LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND 
CAREER PROGRESSION FOR INDIVIDUALS.  POST PROVIDED A SIMILAR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

SUMMARY OF PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP CHANGES 
AND ANALYSIS IN JANUARY 2000 (REFTELS). 
 
PARTY, PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE, AND PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL NEXUS 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
3. AT THE PROVINCIAL LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE, THE PARTY 
COMMITTEE IS THE POLICY SETTING ORGAN, THE PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGAN, AND THE PEOPLE\'S 
COUNCIL IS THE LEGISLATIVE ORGAN.  (NOTE: PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS 
USUALLY MEET ONLY TWICE A YEAR, AND THEIR SESSIONS GENERALLY 
LAST ONLY A FEW DAYS.)  POST HAD NOTICED ON PROVINCIAL TRIPS 
THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL WOULD OFTEN HOLD TWO POSITIONS AMONG 
THESE THREE ORGANS.  EXAMINATION OF THE DATA IN SEPTEL 
CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THIS NEXUS: THE SECRETARY OF THE 
PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING OF THE 
THREE, AND USUALLY HOLDS NO CONCURRENT POSITIONS.  THE 
STANDING (I.E., SENIOR MOST) DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE 
PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS USUALLY THE CONCURRENT 
CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL.  THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF THE PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE IS USUALLY THE 
 
SIPDIS 
CONCURRENT CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE. 
ALTHOUGH, THE STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY OUTRANKS THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF THE PARTY COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF THE PARTY\'S 
 
SIPDIS 
HIERARCHY, THE DEPUTY SECRETARY BY MEANS OF HIS CONCURRENT 
POSITION AS PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN, MAY ACTUALLY BE 
MORE INFLUENTIAL.  MORE DEPUTY SECRETARIES THAN STANDING 
DEPUTY SECRETARIES ARE PROMOTED TO THE POSITION OF SECRETARY 
OF PROVINCIAL COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEES.  THE CONCURRENT 
POSITIONING OF THE SECOND- AND THIRD-RANKING PARTY OFFICIALS 
TO HEAD THE PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL (LEGISLATIVE ORGAN) AND THE 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (EXECUTIVE ORGAN) RESPECTIVELY, APPEARS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00460  01 OF 03  230459Z 
TO BE A MECHANISM TO ENSURE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AS WELL 
AS PARTY SUPREMACY. 
 
PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES 
---------------------------- 
 
4. IN THE 29 PROVINCES AND TWO CITIES IN VIETNAM\'S SOUTH AND 
CENTER, 11 PARTY COMMITTEE SECRETARIES ARE INCUMBENT IN 
THEIR POSITION, AND 18 ARE NEWLY SELECTED (TWO PROVINCES DID 
NOT PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION).  ALL 31 SECRETARIES ARE MEN 
AND THE AVERAGE AGE IS 54 YEARS OLD, WITH THE OLDEST 60 AND 
THE YOUNGEST 47 YEARS OLD.  THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCE IN AGE BETWEEN INCUMBENTS AND NEW SECRETARIES. 
THREE ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS.  ONE HOLDS A 
PH.D.  NINE HAVE B.A. DEGREES (TWO HAVE TWO B.A.S). 
INFORMATION ON EDUCATIONAL LEVELS WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR THE 
OTHER 21 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES.  (NOTE: FROM 
UNOFFICIAL SOURCES, POST HEARD THAT ONE OF THE SECRETARIES 
HAS ONLY AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION.  IT WOULD BE NO 
SURPRISE TO LEARN THAT MOST PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES 
HAVE LOW FORMAL EDUCATION LEVELS, SINCE MOST MEMBERS OF 
THEIR GENERATION SPENT THEIR YOUTH IN THE MILITARY RATHER 
THAN IN SCHOOL.  PROVINCIAL LEADERS ALSO OFTEN ATTEND 
POLITICAL INSTITUTES PART-TIME FROM WHICH THEY ARE AWARDED 
\"DEGREES.\"  THIS ANALYSIS DID NOT INCLUDE THESE ACADEMIC 
CREDENTIALS.   END NOTE.) 
 
5. ONLY SEVEN OF 26 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES WHO 
PROVIDED THE INFORMATION HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS SECOND 
RANKING STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES.  TWELVE HAD SERVED 
PREVIOUSLY AS THIRD RANKING DEPUTY SECRETARIES AND/OR 
PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN.  FOUR HAD SERVED 
PREVIOUSLY IN CENTRAL PARTY POSITIONS IN HANOI AND WERE 
APPOINTED PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARY BY THE POLITBURO. 
THREE SERVED IN OTHER POSITIONS BEFORE BECOMING PARTY 
SECRETARY.  FIFTEEN OF 28 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES WHO 
 
SIPDIS 
PROVIDED THE INFORMATION DO NOT HOLD ANY CONCURRENT 
POSITION.  THIRTEEN CONCURRENTLY HOLD THE POSITION OF 
CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL, BUT EIGHT OF 
THESE PLAN TO RELINQUISH THAT POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO 
THE STANDING DEPUTY PARTY SECRETARY.  (POST BELIEVES THE 
REMAINING FIVE WILL ALSO LIKELY RELINQUISH THE CONCURRENT 
POSITION.) 
 
6. SINCE 18 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES ARE NEW TO THE JOB, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00460  02 OF 03  230500Z 
POST ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PREVIOUS SECRETARIES.  ONLY 
TWO PROVINCES RESPONDED TO THAT QUESTION, AND SAID ONLY THAT 
THE PREVIOUS SECRETARY HAD RETIRED.  POST BELIEVES THAT 
OUTSIDE OF MAJOR CITIES AND PROVINCES, SERVING AS PROVINCIAL 
PARTY SECRETARY IS THE END OF THE CAREER LINE FOR MOST. 
 
STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES 
--------------------------- 
 
7. OF 18 STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE 
INFORMATION, SIX HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS HEAD OF THE 
PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMISSION FOR PROPAGANDA AND EDUCATION. 
FIVE HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS THE HEAD OF THE PROVINCIAL 
PARTY COMMISSION ON PERSONNEL AND ORGANIZATION.  THREE HAD 
SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS CITY OR TOWN PARTY COMMITTEE 
SECRETARIES, AND TWO HAD SERVED IN OTHER PARTY POSITIONS. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
8. OF 22 STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE 
INFORMATION, THREE ARE CONCURRENTLY CHAIRMEN OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES AND EIGHT ARE 
CONCURRENTLY CHAIRMEN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL 
PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS.  ELEVEN HELD NO CONCURRENT POSITIONS, BUT 
EIGHT OF THESE EXPECT TO ASSUME THE POSITION OF CHAIRMAN OF 
PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  SIXTEEN OF 
22 EITHER SERVING OR EXPECTING TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AS 
CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL CONFIRMS THAT IT 
IS GENERAL PRACTICE FOR THE STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE 
PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE TO SERVE CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMAN 
OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00460  02 OF 03  230500Z 
------------------ 
 
9. OF 14 DEPUTY SECRETARIES WHO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION, 
NINE HAD SERVED PREVIOUSLY AS VICE-CHAIRMEN OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES.  THE OTHER FIVE 
HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY IN A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT AND/OR 
PARTY POSITIONS.  OF 25 WHO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION, 21 
DEPUTY SECRETARIES ARE SERVING CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMEN OF 
THEIR RESPECTIVE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (A 22ND 
EXPECT TO ASSUME THAT POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE).  TWO ARE 
SERVING CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMEN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 
PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COUNCILS, AND ONE IS THE HEAD OF THE 
MANAGEMENT BOARD OF A PROVINCIAL OPEN ECONOMIC ZONE.  THIS 
CONFIRMS THAT IT IS GENERAL PRACTICE FOR THE DEPUTY 
SECRETARY OF THE PROVINCIAL PARTY COMMITTEE TO SERVE 
 
SIPDIS 
CONCURRENTLY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE. 
 
DEPUTY AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARY DEMOGRAPHICS 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
10. SINCE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THE 
DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN DEPUTY AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES, 
THIS ANALYSIS LUMPS THEM TOGETHER.  OF 43 WHO PROVIDED THE 
INFORMATION, ONLY 11 ARE INCUMBENTS, WHILE 32 ARE NEW TO THE 
JOB.  THE AVERAGE AGE IS 52 YEARS OLD, WITH THE OLDEST 59 
AND THE YOUNGEST 46 YEARS OLD.  OF THE TOTAL OF 55, 52 ARE 
MEN AND ONLY 3 ARE WOMEN.  ONLY TWO ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC 
MINORITY GROUPS.  TWO HOLD M.A. DEGREES.  FIFTEEN HOLD 
B.A./B.S. DEGREES (SEVEN OF THESE HOLD MORE THAN ONE 
DEGREE).  ONE SAID HE WAS A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE.  MORE MAY 
HAVE UNIVERSITY DEGREES, BUT DIDN\'T PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. 
AS IS THE CASE WITH THE PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES, FOR 
HISTORICAL REASONS IT IS LIKELY THAT MOST OF THE DEPUTY AND 
STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES HAVE LOW FORMAL EDUCATION 
LEVELS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. IT IS CLEAR FROM THE ABOVE, THAT WOMEN AND MINORITIES 
REMAIN UNDER-REPRESENTED AT THE HIGHEST PROVINCIAL POLICY- 
SETTING LEVELS.  OF 85 PROVINCIAL PARTY SECRETARIES, DEPUTY 
AND STANDING DEPUTY SECRETARIES, ONLY THREE ARE WOMEN AND 
FIVE ARE MEMBERS OF ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS (ONE WOMAN IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00460  03 OF 03  230500Z 
ALSO AN ETHNIC MINORITY).  NOT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OF 54 WHO 
PROVIDED AGE INFORMATION WAS LESS THAN 46 YEARS OLD.  IT 
APPEARS THAT AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PROVINCIAL GOVERNANCE, 
MIDDLE-AGE MALE TRADITIONALISTS STILL CALL THE SHOTS.

SUBJECT: A BIT OF CAO DAI HISTORY 
 
1. POLOFF RECENTLY MET WITH A CAO DAI RELIGIOUS ELDER WHO 
RELATED AN ANECDOTE REGARDING THE INDOCHINA TALKS HELD IN 
GENEVA IN 1954.  THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION (WHICH INCLUDED 
ONE CAO DAI REPRESENTATIVE) ATTEMPTED TO MEET PRIVATELY 
WITH THE VIET MINH DELEGATION HEADED BY PHAM VAN DONG AND 
PHAN ANH.  BUT DONG CALLED THE SOUTHERN DELEGATES PUPPETS 
OF THE FRENCH, AND THE PROPOSAL NEVER BORE FRUIT.  IN AN 
ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE INITIATIVE, PHAM CONG TAC, CAO DAI 
POPE AT THE TIME, INVITED DONG AND THE THREE OTHER VIET 
MINH DELEGATES TO DINNER.  THEY REFUSED, BUT OFFERED TO 
HOST THEIR OWN DINNER FOR PHAM CONG TAC.  THE CAO DAI POPE 
ALSO REFUSED THE DINNER INVITATION, BUT THE CAO DAI AND 
THE VIET MINH EVENTUALLY DID AGREE AT LEAST TO MEET. 
 
2. THE CAO DAI AND VIET MINH HAD BEEN BITTER ENEMIES. 
VIET MINH FORCES ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE KILLED THOUSANDS OF 
CAO DAI FOLLOWERS AND DIGNITARIES FROM 1946-48.  AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THEIR MEETING, PHAM CONG TAC REPORTEDLY TOLD 
PHAM VAN DONG THAT VIETNAM SHOULD FIND ITS OWN IDEOLOGY 
AND NOT FOLLOW THAT OF CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION. 
INDEPENDENCE FROM COLONIALISM WHILE FOLLOWING COMMUNISM, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00488  260658Z 
PHAM CONG TAC REPORTEDLY SAID, WOULD BE LIKE A PRISONER 
BREAKING HIS HANDCUFFS FROM THE WALL ONLY TO ROAM WITHIN 
HIS PRISON CELL. 
 
3. DESPITE THIS ROCKY START, THE ATMOSPHERE DURING THE 
MEETING IMPROVED.  AFTERWARDS THE CAO DAI AND VIET MINH 
SHARED A VEGETARIAN MEAL TOGETHER.  PHAM VAN DONG PROMISED 
TO MAKE A VISIT TO THE CAO DAI TEMPLE IN TAY NINH. 
(REMINDED OF THIS PROMISE IN 1991, DONG REPORTEDLY SAID 
THAT FOR POLITICAL REASONS, THE TIME WAS NOT YET RIGHT. 
HE NEVER MADE THE TRIP.) 
 
4. AT THE NEXT FORMAL SESSION IN GENEVA, WHEN THE VIET 
MINH DELEGATION WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THE CAO DAI 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION (WHO HAD BEEN 
AT THE PHAM CONG TAC/PHAM VAN DONG MEETING) STOOD UP AND 
BOWED TO PHAM VAN DONG.  DONG IN TURN BOWED TO THE CAO DAI 
REPRESENTATIVE.  THE SOUTHERN DELEGATION TOOK THIS AS A 
BOW TO THEM ALL COLLECTIVELY, AND THEY IN TURN STOOD UP 
AND BOWED TO THE VIET MINH DELEGATION, WHO IN TURN THEN 
RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE CAO DAI 
RELIGIOUS ELDER WHO RELATED THE STORY, THE FRENCH 
DELEGATION LOOKED ON IN AMAZEMENT AT THIS BOWING BETWEEN 
THE TWO SIDES WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO TALK TO EACH 
OTHER AT THE FORMAL ROUNDS.  THE GENEVA TALKS ENDED WITH 
\"ACCORDS\" THAT PARTITIONED THE COUNTRY, AND CALLED FOR A 
CEASE-FIRE AND ELECTIONS.  THE REST, AS WE KNOW, IS 
HISTORY.

1. SUMMARY: REFTEL REPORTED THAT ON MARCH 11, 2000, POLICE 
ARRESTED THIRTEEN HOA HAO BELIEVERS IN THOAI SON DISTRICT, 
AN GIANG PROVINCE.  EIGHT WERE RELEASED AFTER QUESTIONING; 
THE OTHER FIVE EVENTUALLY RECEIVED PRISON SENTENCES 
RANGING FROM 12 MONTHS TO 30 MONTHS.  THE NAMES OF THE 
FIVE IMPRISONED HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN MISSION\'S HUMAN 
ANNUAL RIGHTS REPORT AND ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNATIONAL 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  HOWEVER, IT NOW APPEARS THE CASE MAY 
NOT BE SO CLEAR CUT.  SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH 
PERSONS FAMILIAR WITH THE INCIDENT HAVE LED MISSION TO 
BELIEVE THE ARRESTS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A FIGHT WITH 
POLICE FOLLOWING A RIVER TRAFFIC VIOLATION.  THE SENTENCES 
HANDED DOWN IN THE CASE, THOUGH STIFF, ARE WITHIN THE 
ALLOWABLE RANGE UNDER VIETNAMESE LAW FOR A FIGHT WITH 
POLICE.  BECAUSE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ALTERCATION ARE 
AMBIGUOUS, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF FURTHER INFORMATION, WE 
BELIEVE THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A HUMAN RIGHTS OR 
FREEDOM OF RELIGION CASE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. REFTEL REPORTED THAT 13 PERSONS WERE ARRESTED ON MARCH 
11, 2000 IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTROVERSIAL DEATH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HOA HAO FOUNDER HUYNH PHU SO.  EIGHT OF THE

3. ON FEBRUARY 13, POLOFF MET WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED HOA HAO ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE IN 
AN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE THOAI SON INCIDENT WAS ONLY ONE OF 
A NUMBER OF TOPICS COVERED DURING THE MEETING, BUT WAS THE 
SUBJECT OF GREATEST ENTHUSIASM AMONG THE COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS.  THEY SAID THERE WAS INDEED A DEATH ANNIVERSARY 
INVOLVED, BUT IT WAS THAT OF A FAMILY MEMBER, NOT OF THE 
HOA HAO FOUNDER.  MANY PERSONS HAD COME TO THE HOME TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE DEATH ANNIVERSARY COMMEMORATION. 
AFTERWARDS, MANY OF THE ATTENDEES DEPARTED BY BOAT.  RIVER 
TRAFFIC POLICE ATTEMPTED TO STOP THE BOAT, WHICH WAS 
OVERLOADED WITH PEOPLE.  THE PERSONS DRIVING THE BOAT 
REFUSED TO STOP AND QUARRELED WITH THE POLICE.  THEY 
OVERTURNED THE POLICE BOAT AND THEN CONTINUED ON THEIR WAY 
WITHOUT TRYING TO ASSIST THE POLICEMEN WHO HAD FALLEN INTO 
THE RIVER.  LATER, THE POLICE WENT TO THE HOME TO ARREST 
THE PERSONS RESPONSIBLE.  A QUARREL AND FIGHTING ENSUED AT 
THE HOME, AND POLICE ENDED UP ARRESTING THIRTEEN PERSONS, 
RELEASING EIGHT AFTER QUESTIONING, AND DETAINING THE OTHER 
FIVE.  THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAID THE ENTIRE STORY CAME 
OUT DURING THE TRIAL, AND THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADMITTED TO 
OVERCROWDING THE BOAT. 
 
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED - HOA HAO DISSIDENT 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. LE QUANG LIEM, A DISSIDENT HOA HAO ELDER GAVE POLOFF 
HIS VERSION OF THE THOAI SON INCIDENT ON MARCH 14.  LIEM 
SAID THE INCIDENT SHOULD BE TAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF 
ONGOING POLICE INTIMIDATION OF HOA HAO FOLLOWERS FOR THE 
PAST 25 YEARS.  POLICE TREAT HOA HAO BELIEVERS CRUELLY, 
ACCORDING TO LIEM, AND THE HOA HAO IN TURN HATE THE 
POLICE.  BECAUSE POLICE PREVENT HOA HAO FOLLOWERS FROM 
GATHERING IN LARGE NUMBERS, FAMILY DEATH ANNIVERSARIES 
(WHERE IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED PERSONS 
TO GATHER) ARE OFTEN A FOCAL POINT FOR CONFRONTATION WITH 
POLICE.  THAT SAID, LIEM ADMITTED THAT IN FACT, THE BOAT 
WAS OVERCROWDED WITH 50 TO 70 PEOPLE ON BOARD.  THE HOA 
HAO BOAT TRIED TO STOP WHEN ORDERED, SAID LIEM, \"BUT A 
BOAT DOES NOT HAVE BRAKES.\"  THE POLICE RIVER PATROL BOAT, 
A MUCH SMALLER VEHICLE, CUT IN FRONT OF THE LARGER BOAT 
WHICH THEN RAMMED IT AND OVERTURNED IT.  ACCORDING TO 
LIEM, THE HOA HAO BOAT DID NOT STOP BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ON 
BOARD WERE AFRAID.

5. EVEN GIVEN POSSIBLE POLICE INTIMIDATION, IT APPEARS TO 
MISSION THAT THE FACTS OF THE THOAI SON INCIDENT SUGGEST 
THIS CASE WAS MORE ABOUT AN ALTERCATION BETWEEN POLICE AND 
AN OVERCROWDED BOAT THAN A VERIFIABLE CASE OF VIOLATION OF 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  THE SENTENCES HANDED DOWN FOR 
SKIRMISHING WITH POLICE ARE WITHIN THE RANGE OF PUNISHMENT 
IN VIETNAM LAW.  GIVEN THE AMBIGUITIES, WE BELIEVE WE 
WOULD NEED TO OBTAIN FURTHER CONFIRMATION BEFORE 
CONSIDERING THIS A CASE OF A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS OR 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO OBTAIN 
FURTHER INFORMATION.  IN THE MEANTIME, PLACING EMPHASIS ON 
A CASE THAT ON ITS FACE APPEARS TO BE MORE ABOUT A TRAFFIC 
VIOLATION RISKS DILUTING OUR CREDIBILITY ON MORE CLEAR-CUT 
CASES OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.  END COMMENT.

RUNNERS TO REPLACE VO VIET THANH FOR THE JOB OF CHAIRMAN 
OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  ON MAY 18, IN AN IRREGULAR 
SESSION OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL, HAI WAS SELECTED THE 
NEW CHAIRMAN.  THE MAY 19 EDITION OF THE DAILY \"TUOI TRE\" 
(\"YOUTH\") REPORTED THAT HAI GAINED 91 PERCENT OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S COUNCIL VOTES AND THAT NO OTHER CANDIDATE WAS 
NOMINATED.  HE WILL SERVE OUT THE REMAINING REGULAR TERM 
OF THE CHAIRMANSHIP, WHICH BEGAN IN 1999 AND WILL END IN

ECONOMICS AND A B.A. IN LITERATURE.  HE IS MARRIED AND HAS 
TWO CHILDREN.  HE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESSIVE

YEARS OLD, HOLDS B.A.S IN LAW, POLITICS AND ECONOMICS, AND 
IS CURRENTLY DIRECTOR OF HCMC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND 
PRICING.  NGUYEN THANH TAI IS 49 YEARS OLD, HOLDS B.A.S IN

AT THE OFFICE OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  MAI QUOC 
BINH IS 50 YEARS OLD, HOLDS A PH.D. IN BUSINESS 
ADMINISTRATION, AND IS A MEMBER OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE.  HE PARTICIPATED IN AN INTERNATIONAL VISITORS 
PROGRAM ON ETHICS IN BUSINESS IN 1999.  HIS MAIN DUTY THE

GOVERNMENT POSITION.  THE DEPARTING PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE 
VICE-CHAIRMEN ARE 49-YEAR-OLD MS. PHAM PHUONG THAO, WHO

5. AS MENTIONED, THE SELECTION OF HAI AS HCMC PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CAME AS NO SURPRISE.  THE THREE NEW 
VICE-CHAIRMEN ARE NOT VERY WELL KNOWN TO POST, BUT DO NOT 
APPEAR TO PORTEND ANY GREAT CHANGE.  THERE WAS ONLY A 
BRIEF MENTION OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHANGES IN 
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PRESS, AND \"TUOI TRE\" WAS THE ONLY 
VIETNAMESE VERNACULAR DAILY TO CARRY THE CHANGES AS ITS 
LEAD STORY.  POST EXPECTS NO REAL DEPARTURE FROM THE 
PREVIOUS CITY ADMINISTRATION\'S COURSE; APPARENTLY, THE 
VIETNAMESE MEDIA THOUGHT THERE WAS LITTLE NEWS IN THE 
CHANGES EITHER.

OF VIETNAM 
MR. TRAN DUC LUONG, PRESIDENT OF THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF 
VIETNAM 
MR. PHAN VAN KHAI, PRIME MINISTER OF THE SOCIALIST 
REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM 
MR. NONG DUC MANH, CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF 
THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIETNAM 
 
DEAR SIRS: 
 
FOR GENERATIONS, THE CONCEPT OF FILIAL PIETY - CHILDREN\'S 
AFFECTION, LOVE, RESPECT, AND CARE FOR THEIR PARENTS - HAS 
BEEN THE WAY OF LIFE OF OUR SOCIETY.  EVEN AFTER REACHING 
ADULTHOOD, VIETNAMESE PEOPLE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SERVE AND TAKE 
CARE OF THEIR ELDER PARENTS. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00631  01 OF 02  250206Z 
I DARE SAY THAT EVEN YOU WOULD NOT ABANDON THIS 
TRADITIONAL PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR ELDER PARENTS 
WERE IN A POOR STATE OF HEALTH. 
 
MY PURPOSE HERE IS NOT TO PRY INTO YOUR PERSONAL FAMILY 
AFFAIRS, BUT TO DEMONSTRATE IN A PERSONAL MANNER THE 
GRIEVOUS ANXIETY THAT TENS OF MILLIONS OF BUDDHIST 
BELIEVERS FEEL ABOUT THEIR SPIRITUAL LEADER, THE MOST 
VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG, THE PATRIARCH OF THE UNIFIED 
BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV). 
 
THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG, BIRTH NAME LE DINH 
NHAN, 83, WAS ARRESTED AND PUT UNDER DETENTION BY THE HO 
CHI MINH CITY POLICE IN 1982 IN AN ABANDONED PAGODA IN 
NGHIA HANH DISTRICT, QUANG NGAI PROVINCE.  HE HAS BEEN 
DETAINED THERE FOR 19 YEARS, BUT HAS NEVER BEEN CHARGED 
WITH A CRIME.  BESIDES OLD AGE AND WEAKNESS, THE MOST 
VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG SUFFERS MANY SERIOUS 
ILLNESSES.  ONE PERSON COMES TO COOK FOR HIM IN THE 
MORNING, BUT LEAVES IN THE AFTERNOON.  IN THE EVENING, NO 
ONE IS THERE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.  OVER THE PAST 19 YEARS, 
THE POLICE HAVE HARASSED HIM HUNDREDS OF TIMES.  THIS HAS 
MADE HIM EXCLAIM, \"I HAVE NO HOME TO LIVE IN, NO GRAVE TO 
DIE IN, NO ROAD TO WALK UPON, AND NO CRIME TO JUSTIFY THIS 
INTERMINABLE IMPRISONMENT.\" 
 
ON NOVEMBER 28, 1997, THE POLICE OF QUANG NGAI PROVINCE 
CAME TO HIM AND READ OUT A STATE DECISION DECLARING THAT 
HIS TERM OF DETENTION WAS OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED.  THEY READ 
IT TO HIM, BUT WOULD NOT HAND THE DOCUMENT OVER TO HIM AS 
REQUIRED BY LAW.  IN DECEMBER OF THAT YEAR, THE POLICE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00631  01 OF 02  250206Z 
CAME BACK TO FORCE HIM TO REGISTER AND HAVE HIS 
IDENTIFICATION CARD SHOW HIS OFFICIAL RESIDENCE AS CHO 
CHUA COMMUNE, NGHIA HANH DISTRICT, QUANG NGAI PROVINCE. 
BUT HE REFUSED TO SIGN THE DOCUMENTS.  HE STATED THAT 
BECAUSE HE WAS ARRESTED IN SAIGON, WHEN HIS TERM OF 
DETENTION IS CONCLUDED, HE SHOULD BE PROVIDED AN OFFICIAL 
RELEASE ORDER TO ALLOW HIM TO RETURN TO HIS PREVIOUS 
RESIDENCE AT AN QUANG PAGODA.  THE POLICE OFFICER LEFT 
WITHOUT RESPONDING TO THIS STATEMENT, AND THE AUTHORITIES 
OF QUANG NGAI HAVE YET TO FREE THE PATRIARCH. 
 
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT DECREE ON HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION AND 
MANAGEMENT NUMBERED 51/CP, DATED MAY 10, 1997, HO CHI MINH 
CITY RESIDENTS WHO ARE SENT TO PRISON OR WHO SUBMIT TO 
ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENTS AT REEDUCATION CAMPS OR MEDICAL 
TREATMENT CENTERS ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN TO AND RESIDE IN 
HO CHI MINH CITY ONCE THEIR TERM OF DETENTION HAS 
CONCLUDED.  WE ASK WHY THE POLICE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF 
QUANG NGAI HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THIS DECREE, WHICH IS CLEAR 
AND SPECIFIC. 
 
CURRENTLY, THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S HEALTH 
IS DETERIORATING.  OUR ENTIRE CHURCH AND ITS BUDDHIST 
BELIEVERS ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED.  THIS IS WHY I AM 
WRITING TO REQUEST YOUR URGENT ACTION.  I RESPECTFULLY 
REQUEST YOU TO ISSUE A LETTER TO THE PROVINCE OF QUANG 
NGAI SO THAT THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG MAY BE 
FREED TO RETURN TO HIS PERMANENT RESIDENCE IN HO CHI MINH 
CITY AS REGULATED BY DECREE 51/CP. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00631  02 OF 02  250206Z 
 
IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE A REPLY OR IF YOU DO NOT ISSUE ANY 
LETTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE REQUEST OF OUR CHURCH BY EARLY 
JUNE, I WILL HEAD A DELEGATION OF MONKS, NUNS AND 
BELIEVERS TO QUANG NGAI TO ESCORT THE MOST VENERABLE THICH 
HUYEN QUANG BACK TO SAIGON.  HIS HEALTH CONDITION NOW IS 
SUCH THAT HE NEEDS REGULAR CARE AND TREATMENT BY NURSES 
AND ATTENDANTS ON A DAILY BASIS. 
 
THE EXILE TO A REMOTE, MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF AN ORDINARY, 
GOOD MAN SPARKS ANGER IN HUMANITY.  THE EXILE OF THE 
PATRIARCH WHO REPRESENTS MILLIONS OF BUDDHIST BELIEVERS IS 
EVEN MORE OF AN AFFRONT TO MANKIND. 
 
IF THE MOST VENERABLE THICH HUYEN QUANG PASSES AWAY, I 
SINCERELY WOULD NOT WANT THE PARTY AND THE STATE TO BE 
RESPONSIBLE TO HISTORY AND TO THE CONSCIENCES OF TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF VIETNAMESE BUDDHIST BELIEVERS. 
 
THAT IS THE REASON I WRITE THIS URGENT, HUMANE REQUEST.

1. (U) SUMMARY: ON MAY 21, THICH QUANG DO SENT A LETTER TO 
GOVERNMENT LEADERS IN HANOI URGING THEM TO ISSUE A 
DOCUMENT ALLOWING UBCV PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG TO 
RETURN TO HCMC.  IN THE LETTER, DO SAID THAT IF THE 
DOCUMENT WAS NOT ISSUED BY JUNE 7, HE WOULD GO TO QUANG 
NGAI PROVINCE (WHERE QUANG IS BEING HELD UNDER CONDITIONS 
RESEMBLING HOUSE ARREST) AT THE HEAD OF AN UNAUTHORIZED 
UBCV DELEGATION TO BRING QUANG BACK TO HCMC.  ALSO ON MAY 
21, DO REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH A SUMMONS TO APPEAR BEFORE A 
DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE HAD RESPONDED TO AN 
EARLIER SUMMONS ON MAY 18.  AT THAT MEETING, THE PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE HAD WARNED HIM STRONGLY NOT TO CARRY THROUGH 
WITH HIS PLANS TO GO TO QUANG NGAI (REF A.)  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) THICH QUANG DO SENT A LETTER TO GOVERNMENT LEADERS 
ON MARCH 29, URGING THAT THEY ISSUE AN OFFICIAL DOCUMENT 
THAT WOULD ALLOW THICH HUYEN QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC. 
(QUANG HAS RESIDED AT A PAGODA IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE 
SINCE 1982 AND IS RESTRICTED FROM TRAVELING ELSEWHERE.) 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00632  01 OF 02  250207Z 
IN HIS LETTER, DO NOTED THAT QUANG, WHO IS 83 YEARS OLD, 
IS IN DETERIORATING HEALTH.  HE ALSO NOTED THAT IN 1997, 
POLICE IN QUANG NGAI READ TO QUANG A DECISION THAT HIS 
OFFICIAL TERM OF ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION HAD CONCLUDED. 
(NOTE: THE POLICE WOULD NOT, HOWEVER, GIVE HIM A COPY OF 
THAT DOCUMENT, AND SEVERAL DAYS LATER THEY RETURNED WITH 
FORMS FOR HIM TO REGISTER HIS RESIDENCE IN QUANG NGAI AS 
HIS OFFICIAL PERMANENT RESIDENCE.  QUANG REFUSED TO SIGN 
THOSE FORMS.  END NOTE.)  BECAUSE OF THAT, ACCORDING TO 
DO, THERE IS NO LEGAL BASIS FOR QUANG\'S CONTINUED 
DETENTION IN QUANG NGAI.  DO SAID THAT IF HE RECEIVED NO 
REPLY TO HIS LETTER BY JUNE, HE WOULD GO HIMSELF TO QUANG 
NGAI TO BRING QUANG BACK TO HO CHI MINH CITY. 
 
3. (SBU) ON MAY 15, ANOTHER UBCV CONTACT TOLD POLOFF THAT 
QUANG\'S HEALTH WAS INDEED DETERIORATING.  HE SAID THAT 
PERSONS IN GOVERNMENT BOTH IN HANOI AND HCMC ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT POSSIBLE REPERCUSSIONS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
VIETNAM SHOULD QUANG PASS AWAY WHILE IN DETENTION IN QUANG 
NGAI.  ACCORDING TO THIS CONTACT, SOME GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS WOULD BE HAPPY TO SEE QUANG RETURNED TO HCMC AS 
LONG AS HE RETURNED \"QUIETLY.\"  THIS CONTACT SAID THE 
PROBLEM WAS THAT QUANG REFUSED TO GO TO HCMC WITHOUT AN 
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT ALLOWING HIM TO GO.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
IS HARD-PRESSED TO ISSUE AN OFFICIAL RELEASE DOCUMENT 
SINCE HE WAS NEVER OFFICIALLY CHARGED WITH OR TRIED FOR 
ANY CRIME. 
 
4. (U) A MAY 16 PRESS RELEASE BY THE PARIS-BASED UBCV 
INFORMATION SERVICE REPORTED THAT SECURITY POLICE IN QUANG 
NGAI ENTERED QUANG\'S PAGODA IN APRIL AND TOLD HIM THAT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00632  01 OF 02  250207Z 
\"THE CIA IS GOING TO ASSASSINATE YOU.\"  A FEW DAYS LATER 
ON APRIL 15, THE POLICE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE WISHED TO BE 
RELEASED TO GO BACK TO HCMC, HE MUST FILE AN APPLICATION 
TO THE HCMC POLICE WHO ARRESTED HIM IN 1982.  ACCORDING TO 
THE LETTER, QUANG RESPONDED IN A LETTER SAYING, \"I REFUSE 
TO FILE A REQUEST TO THE SAIGON POLICE, FOR I HAVE 
COMMITTED NO CRIME AND WILL ASK NO FAVORS.\"  (THICH QUANG 
DO TOLD POLOFF IN A PHONE CONVERSATION MAY 18 THAT QUANG\'S 
REFUSAL TO APPLY FOR OFFICIAL PERMISSION TO GO TO HCMC 
DOES NOT MEAN HE WOULD REFUSE TO RETURN TO HCMC WITHOUT 
PERMISSION.) 
 
5. (SBU) AS REPORTED IN REF A, THE DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE WHERE THICH QUANG DO RESIDES IN HCMC CALLED HIM 
IN ON MAY 18 AND ISSUED A STERN WARNING FOR HIM NOT TO GO 
TO QUANG NGAI.  AFTER TWO HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS, THEY 
ALLOWED HIM TO RETURN TO HIS PAGODA, BUT TOLD HIM THEY 
WOULD SUMMON HIM AGAIN TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS.  ON 
MAY 21, DO IGNORED A SUMMONS TO RETURN TO THE DISTRICT 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE THEN ISSUED ANOTHER LETTER 
PUBLICLY SETTING A DEADLINE, JUNE 7, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO 
OFFICIALLY ALLOW QUANG\'S RETURN TO HCMC. 
 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
6. (SBU) BASED ON THE UBCV CONTACT\'S STATEMENTS IN 
PARAGRAPH 3 AND ON THE QUANG NGAI POLICE\'S OWN STATEMENTS 
ON APRIL 15, IT APPEARS THAT THERE MIGHT BE THE SMALLEST 
GLIMMER OF AN OPPORTUNITY FOR QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC 
\"QUIETLY.\"  OTHER INDICATIONS, SUCH AS THE WARNING FROM 
THE DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE WHERE DO RESIDES, THE 
OUTRAGEOUS ASSERTION OF A CIA ASSASSINATION THREAT, AND 
PARTICULARLY DO\'S PUBLICLY SETTING A DATE FOR A SHOWDOWN, 
MAKE CERTAIN THAT OPPORTUNITY IS TENUOUS AT BEST.

SUBJECT: DOMESTIC NGOS IN HCMC 
 
 
1. SUMMARY:  AFTER 1975, VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT 
CLOSED OR TOOK OVER THE ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS, 
ORPHANAGES, HEALTH FACILITIES, AND OTHER CHARITABLE AND 
SOCIAL FACILITIES IN SAIGON THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN 
MANAGED BY RELIGIOUS OR OTHER PRIVATE ENTITIES.  IN THE 
PAST FEW YEARS IN HCMC, AND IN SOME OTHER PARTS OF 
VIETNAM, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOWED A QUIET BUT REAL 
RESURGENCE IN BOTH THE NUMBER AND THE ACTIVITIES OF 
DOMESTIC, USUALLY RELIGIOUS, NGOS.  ALTHOUGH THESE 
ORGANIZATIONS ACT OUTSIDE OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT CONTROL, 
SOME ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A GOVERNMENT OR PARTY AGENCY. 
THE EMERGENCE OF SUCH GROUPS PROBABLY REPRESENTS A GROWING 
TOLERANCE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS A 
GROWING RECOGNITION OF GOVERNMENT INABILITY TO MEET THE 
CHARITABLE AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE CITY.  THIS REPORT 
PROFILES SOME OF THE NGO\'S ENGAGED IN CHARITABLE AND 
SOCIAL WORK IN HCMC.  GROUPS SUCH AS THESE, ESTABLISHED BY 
AND EMPLOYING PERSONS WITH A GENUINE ENTHUSIASM FOR WHAT 
THEY ARE DOING, MAY EVENTUALLY HELP VIETNAM CREATE A MORE 
CIVIL SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
CHARITABLE NEEDS AND SOCIAL CAUSES WITHOUT FEAR OF 
GOVERNMENT IMPEDIMENTS OR PUNISHMENT.  END SUMMARY.

FRIEND TO FRIEND CLUB 
--------------------- 
 
2. A FEW YEARS AGO, A HCMC HEROIN ADDICT (WHO PREFERRED 
NOT TO GIVE HIS NAME TO POLOFF) DISCOVERED HE WAS HIV- 
POSITIVE.  RATHER THAN SUCCUMB TO FEELINGS OF DESPAIR, HE 
GAVE UP HIS HABIT COLD TURKEY, FOUND A FRIEND WHO SHARED 
THE SAME FATE, AND THE TWO OF THEM BEGAN TALKING WITH 
OTHER HEROIN ADDICTS THEY KNEW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NEEDLE- 
SHARING.  BEING FORMER ADDICTS, THEY WERE ABLE TO STRIKE 
CHORDS IN THEIR LISTENERS THAT GOVERNMENT OUTREACH 
PROGRAMS SIMPLY COULD NOT DO.  THEY ENCOURAGED THEIR 
LISTENERS TO GIVE UP THEIR ADDICTIONS IF THEY COULD, BUT 
THEIR MAIN MESSAGE WAS TO STOP THE PRACTICE OF SHARING 
NEEDLES.  SOON THEY BEGAN HOLDING MEETINGS AT A ROW HOUSE 
ON A SIDE STREET IN PHU NHUAN DISTRICT, CLANDESTINE 
MEETINGS, SINCE A GROUP OF HEROIN ADDICTS MEETING TOGETHER 
AND DISTRIBUTING CLEAN NEEDLES WOULD INVITE ARREST BY 
LOCAL POLICE.  OTHER ADDICTS AND FORMER ADDICTS 
VOLUNTEERED TO HELP.  THEY CREATED A GROUP CALLED \"FRIEND 
TO FRIEND CLUB.\" 
 
3. TODAY FRIEND TO FRIEND IS FORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
HCMC AIDS COMMITTEE FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES FUNDING.  IT 
HAS A STAFF OF 15 WHO RECEIVE A LIMITED SALARY AND A 
VOLUNTEER FORCE OF 100.  MOST OF THE VOLUNTEERS ARE HIV- 
POSITIVE AND THREE QUARTERS OF THEM ARE LESS THAN 25 YEARS 
OLD.  THE VOLUNTEERS GO HOUSE-TO-HOUSE, TO HOSPITALS, AND 
BY INVITATION, TO SCHOOLS, TO GIVE SUPPORT TO PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE HIV/AIDS, THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, AND/OR CAREGIVERS AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00648  01 OF 03  300321Z 
TO GIVE ADVICE TO THOSE WHO ARE AT RISK OF ACQUIRING THE 
DISEASE.  THEY CONTINUE TO HOLD MONTHLY MEETINGS AND TO BE 
A SUPPORT GROUP FOR HEROIN ADDICTS.  THEIR ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE AIDS COMMITTEE HAS GIVEN THEM THE CAPABILITY TO 
OPERATE MORE OPENLY AND WITHOUT FEAR OF POLICE 
INTERVENTION. 
 
THANH XUAN SHELTER FOR GIRLS 
---------------------------- 
 
4. TWO CATHOLIC NUNS ESTABLISHED A SHELTER IN 1996 IN 
HCMC\'S BINH THANH DISTRICT FOR YOUNG GIRLS WHO HAVE 
EXPERIENCED LABOR EXPLOITATION OR SEXUAL ABUSE.  TODAY, 
THE SHELTER IS OPERATED BY SEVERAL CATHOLIC NUNS AND LAY 
PERSONS AND IS HOME TO 22 GIRLS FROM THE AGES OF SIX TO 
FOURTEEN.  THE GIRLS ARE EITHER ORPHANS OR COME FROM POOR 
FAMILIES WITH NEGLECTFUL, ABUSIVE OR EXPLOITATIVE PARENTS. 
(SOME OF THE PARENTS HAVE FORCED OR SOLD THEIR CHILDREN 
INTO PROSTITUTION.)  AT THE SHELTER, THE GIRLS ARE 
PROVIDED FOOD, CLOTHING, AN EDUCATION AND A PLACE TO LIVE. 
RECOGNIZING THAT THE CHILDREN OFTEN COME FROM BACKGROUNDS 
WHERE THE NOTION OF \"TRUST\" HAS BEEN SHATTERED, THE NUNS 
AND LAYPERSONS AT THE SHELTER STRESS INTERDEPENDENCE BY 
HAVING THE CHILDREN SHARE RESPONSIBILITIES IN HOUSEHOLD 
WORK, HELPING EACH OTHER TO LEARN IN THE CLASSROOM, AND 
PLAYING TOGETHER.  THE SHELTER HAS AN INFORMAL ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY YOUTH UNION, WHICH PROVIDES 
COUNSELING TO THE GIRLS TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THEIR RIGHTS 
IN SEXUALLY EXPLOITATIVE SITUATIONS.  IT ALSO IS 
ASSOCIATED INFORMALLY WITH THE HCMC WORK INSTITUTE, WHICH 
PROVIDES THE GIRLS WITH SOME TRAINING IN COMPUTER 
LITERACY, EMBROIDERY/SEWING, AND HAIR STYLING. 
 
5. THE GOAL OF THE THANH XUAN SHELTER IS TO REUNITE THE 
CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES UNDER THE CONDITION THAT BOTH 
PARTIES ARE WILLING AND ACCEPTING OF ONE ANOTHER. 
ALTHOUGH 12 OF THE GIRLS ARE ORPHANS OR OTHERWISE CANNOT 
BE REUNITED WITH THEIR FAMILIES, OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, 
24 GIRLS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN REUNITED WITH FAMILY AND 
LOVED ONES.  FUNDING FOR THE SHELTER COMES COMPLETELY FROM 
PRIVATE DONATIONS, USUALLY FROM INDIVIDUALS. 
 
FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN ASSOCIATION 
--------------------------------------- 
 
6. IN 1993, A CATHOLIC WOMAN TOOK THREE HOMELESS CHILDREN 
INTO HER HOME IN THU DUC DISTRICT.  BY THE END OF 1995, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00648  02 OF 03  300321Z 
SHE HAD TAKEN IN FOUR OTHER HOMELESS CHILDREN AND BEGAN 
TEACHING READING AND WRITING CLASSES TO THEM AND 13 OTHER 
CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT WHOSE FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO 
AFFORD SCHOOL FEES AND BOOKS.  IN 1997, THE WOMAN AND HER 
SCHOOL BECAME A PART OF \"FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN,\" A 
CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION ESTABLISHED IN 1993 THAT RAN THREE 
OTHER SIMILAR SCHOOLS, THE OLDEST OF WHICH DATED BACK TO 
1984.  TODAY, FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN MANAGES AND 
OPERATES SEVEN DEVELOPMENT CENTERS, WHICH ARE, IN FACT, 
SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN FROM FAMILIES TOO POOR TO AFFORD 
MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS.  IT HAS A STAFF OF ABOUT 50 SOCIAL 
WORKERS, EDUCATORS AND NUNS, MOST OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS. 
 
7. IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ATTENDING 
FRIENDS\' DEVELOPMENT CENTERS INCREASED FROM 520 TO 812. 
ABOUT 160 OF THE CHILDREN LIVE ON THE GROUNDS OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT CENTERS AND WOULD OTHERWISE SLEEP ON THE 
STREETS.  THE OTHER CHILDREN LIVE AT HOME, BUT ATTEND 
CLASSES (AND ARE PROVIDED A MEAL) AT THE CENTERS.  THE 
CENTER IN THU DUC DISTRICT IS NOW HOME TO 29 CHILDREN 
WHILE 76 OTHERS ATTEND CLASSES THERE.  THE STAFF OF TWELVE 
TEACHERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS INCLUDES THREE DOMINICAN NUNS. 
IT IS THE GOAL OF FRIENDS FOR STREET CHILDREN TO PREVENT 
THEIR VULNERABLE STUDENTS FROM BECOMING STREET CHILDREN BY 
PROVIDING A BASIC EDUCATION AS WELL AS VOCATIONAL TRAINING 
IN EMBROIDERY, TAILORING, HANDICRAFTS, CARPENTRY AND 
COMPUTER CLASSES.  FUNDING IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON LOCAL 
INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS, BUT FRIENDS DOES GET SUPPORT FROM 
SOME INTERNATIONAL DONORS IN FRANCE AND JAPAN.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00648  02 OF 03  300321Z 
------------- 
 
9. THE HOUSE OF LOVE IS AN ORPHANAGE MANAGED AND OPERATED 
BY ONE BUDDHIST MONK AND ELEVEN BUDDHIST NUNS WHO RESIDE 
AT THE DIEU GIAC PAGODA IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT TWO.  IN 
ADDITION, THERE ARE SEVEN PAID STAFF (TEACHERS AND SOCIAL 
WORKERS) AND TWELVE LAY VOLUNTEERS.  THE ORPHANAGE WAS 
ESTABLISHED IN 1989 FOR NEWBORN BABIES WHO WERE ABANDONED 
AT THE PAGODA (WHICH IS LOCATED IN ONE OF THE CITY\'S 
POOREST AREAS).  OF THE 101 CHILDREN CURRENTLY RESIDING AT 
THE ORPHANAGE, 30 ARE THREE YEARS OLD OR LESS AND 71 ARE 
FROM 4 TO 11 YEARS OLD.  SEVENTY-NINE WERE ABANDONED AT 
THE ORPHANAGE, TEN ARE ORPHANED, AND THE REMAINING TWELVE 
GIVEN OVER TO THE ORPHANAGE FOR VARIOUS REASONS.  ABOUT 
HALF ARE GIRLS AND HALF ARE BOYS.  THE ORPHANAGE SENDS 
SOME OF ITS RESIDENTS TO MAINSTREAM SCHOOLS, BUT ALSO 
PROVIDES PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSES ON ITS PREMISES.  FUNDING 
FOR THE OPERATION OF THIS ORPHANAGE COMES ENTIRELY FROM 
INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE DONATIONS. 
 
OTHER CHARITIES 
--------------- 
 
10. A CATHOLIC NUN IN BINH THANH DISTRICT RUNS AN 
ORPHANAGE FOR AUTISTIC AND MENTALLY DISTURBED CHILDREN. 
ANOTHER CATHOLIC NUN MANAGES AN ORPHANAGE AND SCHOOL FOR 
POOR CHILDREN FROM ONE TO EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD IN THONG NHAT 
DISTRICT IN DONG NAI PROVINCE.  A GROUP OF DOCTORS AND 
NURSES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE BEN SAN LEPROSY TREATMENT 
CENTER IN BINH DUONG PROVINCE.  A PRIVATE GROUP OF 
INDIVIDUALS OPERATES A HOME/SCHOOL FOR 44 BLIND PEOPLE 
(AGED 5 TO 29 YEARS) IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT TEN.  TWO WOMEN, 
ONE VIETNAMESE AND ONE WESTERN, RUN A SHELTER FOR HOMELESS 
GIRLS IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT FOUR.  A PRIVATE GROUP OF 
INDIVIDUALS CALLING THEMSELVES \"CARE FOR CHILDREN IN 
ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES\" MANAGE A SHELTER FOR 
SEXUALLY ABUSED GIRLS AGED 12 TO 16 AND AN ORPHANAGE AND 
SCHOOL FOR 100 CHILDREN AGED 6 TO 16 IN DISTRICT FOUR. 
THE CATHOLIC DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY OPERATE SEVERAL 
KINDERGARTENS IN HCMC, AND PRIESTS ASSOCIATED WITH NOTRE 
DAME CATHEDRAL IN HCMC HAVE ESTABLISHED A SCHOOL FOR THE 
DEAF AND DUMB IN THE MEKONG DELTA. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11. THERE ARE LIKELY MANY MORE PRIVATE CHARITABLE AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00648  03 OF 03  300321Z 
SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS CARRYING OUT SIMILAR ACTIVITIES OF 
WHICH POST IS UNAWARE.  THE ABOVE SHOULD SUFFICE, HOWEVER, 
TO POINT OUT THAT THE NUMBER OF NGO\'S IN HCMC AND THE GOOD 
WORKS THEY ARE ACCOMPLISHING ARE ON THE RISE.  POST 
APPLAUDS THE LENIENT MANNER IN WHICH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
HAS PERMITTED THESE NGO\'S TO OPERATE AND LOOKS FORWARD TO 
THE DAY WHEN A CIVIL SOCIETY COMPRISED OF MANY DIFFERENT 
NON-GOVERNMENT ACTORS, PRIVATE CITIZENS AND PRIVATE 
GROUPS, BECOMES A REALITY IN VIETNAM.

DETERIORATION IN THE PATRIARCH\'S HEALTH OVER THE PAST 
TWELVE MONTHS.  THEY ARE CONCERNED OVER THE LACK OF 
MEDICAL FACILITIES IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, AND NOTING THAT 
HIS TERM OF DETENTION WAS OFFICIALLY CONCLUDED IN 1997, 
HAVE URGED OFFICIALS TO ALLOW QUANG TO RETURN TO HCMC. 
(NOTE: IN DECEMBER 1999, OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY OFFERED TO 
ALLOW HUYEN QUANG TO BE RELOCATED TO HANOI WHERE QUALITY 
MEDICAL FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE.  QUANG REPORTEDLY TOLD 
THEM HE WOULD NEVER GO TO HANOI.  END NOTE.) 
 
3. (SBU) IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED 
DELEGATION OF UBCV MONKS TO TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, 
POLICE ENTERED THICH QUANG DO\'S THANH MINH ZEN PAGODA IN 
HCMC ON JUNE 1 AND READ A GOVERNMENT DECISION TO PLACE HIM 
UNDER A TWO-YEAR ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION (HOUSE ARREST) 
ORDER.  POLICE ALSO CUT THE PHONE LINES TO THE PAGODA. 
POLOFF SPOKE WITH PENELOPE FAULKNER, OF THE UBCV\'S 
INFORMATION OFFICE IN PARIS ON JUNE 3.  SHE SAID THAT HER 
CONTACTS IN HCMC REPORT THAT QUANG DO IS CONFINED TO HIS 
LIVING QUARTERS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE PAGODA.  NO ONE 
EXCEPT POLICE OFFICERS HAS HAD DIRECT ACCESS TO HIM SINCE 
JUNE 1.  SEVERAL NON-UNIFORMED POLICE MAINTAIN A PRESENCE 
OUTSIDE HIS ROOM IN THE PAGODA.  WHENEVER POLICE ENTER HIS 
ROOM, ACCORDING TO FAULKNER\'S CONTACTS, THEY DO SO TWO AT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00684  01 OF 03  070943Z 
A TIME IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT NEITHER OF THEM COOPERATES 
WITH HIM TO SMUGGLE OUT MESSAGES. 
 
4. (SBU) THE SCHEDULED TIME FOR DEPARTURE OF THE 
DELEGATION TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE WAS 10:00 A.M. ON JUNE 
7.  POLOFF DROVE DIRECTLY BY THE PAGODA AT 9:55 A.M.  AT 
THAT TIME, THE GATES TO THE PAGODA WERE OPEN, BUT THE AREA 
BEHIND THE GATES LEADING TO THE ENTRANCEWAY TO THE PAGODA 
AND THE LIVING QUARTERS WAS EMPTY.  TWO PERSONS WHO MAY 
HAVE BEEN PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN SAT AT A COFFEE SHOP 
ACROSS THE STREET.  THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY. 
 
EUROPEAN MP ARRESTED AND DEPORTED 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) OLIVIER DUPUIS, A BELGIAN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN 
PARLIAMENT, ENTERED THE PAGODA ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 7. 
HE REPORTEDLY PLANNED TO STAGE A SIT-IN DEMONSTRATION IN 
SYMPATHY WITH QUANG DO.  PLAINCLOTHES POLICE ALLOWED HIM 
TO STAY IN THE PAGODA FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, BUT THEN TOOK 
HIM BACK TO HIS HOTEL IN A \"MILITARY VAN,\" ACCORDING TO 
ONE WITNESS. 
 
 
6. (SBU) BUT DUPUIS, WHO IS ALSO SECRETARY OF THE ITALIAN- 
BASED TRANSNATIONAL RADICAL PARTY, WAS NOT DISSUADED.  HE 
REPORTEDLY RETURNED TO THE PAGODA IN THE LATE AFTERNOON 
WITH AN ASSISTANT, MARTIN SCHULTES, AND UNFURLED A BANNER 
THAT SAID \"RELIGIOUS FREEDOM FOR VIETNAM\" IN BOTH ENGLISH 
AND VIETNAMESE.  POLICE THEN DETAINED BOTH DUPUIS AND 
SCHULTES AND EXPELLED THEM FROM THE COUNTRY.  THE BELGIAN 
EMBASSY WAS NOT ABLE TO SAY IF EITHER DUPUIS OR SCHULTES 
WERE EVER OFFICIALLY \"ARRESTED\" OR \"DEPORTED,\" BUT AN 
OFFICER AT THE EMBASSY DID CONFIRM TO POLOFF THAT 
IMMIGRATION POLICE ESCORTED DUPUIS FROM HIS HOTEL TO 
HCMC\'S TAN SON NHUT AIRPORT, AND HE LEFT THE COUNTRY AT 
ABOUT 9:00 P.M. ON JUNE 7. 
 
ANXIETY AT HCMC PAGODAS 
----------------------- 
 
7. (SBU) IN THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 7, CONGEN CALLED THE AN 
QUANG PAGODA IN HCMC, THE HOME PAGODA OF THICH HUYEN 
QUANG, AND ASKED FOR THICH TAM AN, A MONK WHO REPORTEDLY 
HAD BEEN DETAINED BY POLICE THE DAY BEFORE.  THE PERSON 
WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE SAID THAT IF WE WISHED TO TALK WITH 
TAM AN, WE SHOULD GO THERE IN PERSON AND THEN ABRUPTLY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00684  02 OF 03  070944Z 
HUNG UP THE PHONE.  WE THEN CALLED THE RESIDENTIAL NUMBER 
OF THICH TRI QUANG, WHO ALSO LIVES AT AN QUANG PAGODA AND 
IS ONE OF THE THREE RANKING MONKS OF THE OFFICIAL BUDDHIST 
ASSOCIATION IN HCMC.  TRI QUANG SAID HE WAS NOT AWARE OF 
ANY ATTEMPTS BY MONKS TO GO TO QUANG NGAI PROVINCE THAT 
MORNING.  HE SAID THAT THICH TAM AN WAS PRESENT AT THE 
PAGODA BUT, AS OF JUNE 4, HE WAS UNAVAILABLE TO COME TO 
THE PHONE AT THE MOMENT (REF A).  CONGEN ALSO CALLED THICH 
HIEN PHAP, ANOTHER OF THE THREE RANKING MONKS OF THE 
OFFICIAL BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION WITH WHOM WE HAVE MET 
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE.  PHAP, WHO HAS IN THE PAST BEEN 
WILLING TO TALK ABOUT THE UBCV, SEEMED ANNOYED BY OUR 
INQUIRIES AND SAID HE KNEW NOTHING MORE ABOUT THICH QUANG 
DO AND THE UBCV PROBLEMS THAN WHAT WAS REPORTED ON 
TELEVISION. 
 
8. (SBU) CONGEN CALLED THE XA LOI PAGODA IN HCMC.  AT ONE 
NUMBER, THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE SUGGESTED WE 
CALL BACK LATER.  WHEN WE CALLED AN HOUR LATER, NO ONE 
ANSWERED THE PHONE.  AT ANOTHER NUMBER, THE PERSON WHO 
ANSWERED THE PHONE BECAME ANGRY AT OUR INQUIRIES.  HE SAID 
NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS HAPPENING AT THE PAGODA AND SUGGESTED 
WE SHOULD PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE MATTER. 
 
9. (SBU) CONGEN ALSO CALLED CAO DAI AND CATHOLIC CONTACTS 
WHO LIKELY WOULD BE AWARE OF THE UBCV SITUATION.  THESE 
CONTACTS, WHO HAVE NEVER HESITATED TO TALK OVER THE 
TELEPHONE BEFORE, SAID THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO MEET 
POLOFF, BUT DID NOT WANT TO SPEAK OVER THE PHONE. 
LIKEWISE, POLOFF WAS ABLE TO REACH THE HCMC-BASED UBCV 
MONK WHO DEPARTED HCMC ON JUNE 1 FOR QUANG NGAI.  HE IS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00684  02 OF 03  070944Z 
BACK IN HCMC, BUT SAID IT WAS \"TOO DANGEROUS\" TO SPEAK 
OVER THE TELEPHONE.  (NOTE: POLOFF PLANS TO MEET WITH THIS 
CONTACT AS SOON AS TIME PERMITS.  HE RESIDES IN ONE OF THE 
RURAL DISTRICTS, LOCATED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CITY. 
END NOTE.) 
 
TENSIONS IN HUE 
--------------- 
 
10. (SBU) CONGEN WAS UNABLE TO REACH THICH THAI HOA AT THE 
TU HIEU PAGODA IN HUE CITY.  ALL PHONE LINES TO THE PAGODA 
HAVE NOW BEEN CUT. (REF A REPORTED THAT THAI HOA\'S 
RESIDENTIAL NUMBER WAS OUT OF SERVICE, BUT THE TWO LINES 
TO THE MAIN PAGODA WERE STILL WORKING.)  THE LINES TO 
PHUOC THANH PAGODA AND THIEN LAM PAGODA ARE SIMILARLY OUT 
OF SERVICE.  THE LINE TO BAO QUOC PAGODA WAS OUT OF 
SERVICE, BUT CONGEN WAS ABLE TO GET THROUGH ON ANOTHER 
NUMBER.  POLOFF ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THICH THIEN HANH, WHO 
REPORTEDLY HAD BEEN CALLED IN FOR QUESTIONING BY POLICE A 
FEW DAYS EARLIER.  THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE ASKED 
US TO CALL BACK AGAIN IN TEN MINUTES.  WE CALLED 
REPEATEDLY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY, BUT NO ONE PICKED UP 
THE RECEIVER AT THE OTHER END. 
 
11. (SBU) CONGEN ALSO CALLED THE CHAU LAM PAGODA IN HUE, 
THE RESIDENCE OF THICH PHUOC VIEN, ONE OF THOSE WHO 
REPORTEDLY PLANNED TO TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI.  WHEN WE ASKED 
TO SPEAK WITH PHUOC VIEN, THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED THE 
PHONE ENGAGED IN A LONG CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
PRESENT AT THE PAGODA BEFORE ANSWERING.  HE THEN TOLD US 
TO CALL BACK IN TEN MINUTES.  TEN MINUTES LATER, AND 
SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THAT, THE PHONE WENT UNANSWERED.  WHEN 
SOMEONE FINALLY ANSWERED THE PHONE, WE WERE TOLD THAT 
THICH PHUOC VIEN WAS BUSY AND UNABLE TO TALK WITH US. 
 
12. (SBU) AT LONG QUAN PAGODA IN HUE, THE PERSON WHO 
ANSWERED THE TELEPHONE ENGAGED IN A CURIOUS CONVERSATION. 
WHEN WE ASKED A QUESTION, HE HESITATED FOR A LONG TIME, 
THEN ASKED WHY WE WERE ASKING ABOUT THE UBCV, THEN 
HESITATED SOME MORE.  AFTER HE TALKED WITH SOMEONE ELSE 
WHO APPARENTLY WAS PRESENT IN THE ROOM WITH HIM, HE 
SHOUTED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE AND THEN HUNG UP THE 
PHONE. 
 
13. (SBU) A MONK AT PHUOC DUYEN PAGODA IN HUE SAID POLICE 
HAD BEEN PRESENT ON THE PAGODA\'S GROUNDS UNTIL 11:30 P.M. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00684  03 OF 03  070944Z 
THE NIGHT BEFORE.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN CALLED IN FOR 
QUESTIONING AT THE POLICE STATION IN THE MORNING.  HE SAID 
THAT POLICE HAD ALSO CALLED IN THICH CHI THANH (FROM THE 
PHUOC THANH PAGODA), THICH THIEN HANH (FROM THE BAO QUOC 
PAGODA), AND THICH CHI MAU.  THE MONK AT PHUOC DUYEN 
PAGODA SAID HE AND 30 TO 40 OTHER MONKS FROM HUE STILL 
PLANNED TO GO TO QUANG NGAI, BUT THAT CAR AND TAXI OWNERS 
WERE TOO AFRAID TO PROVIDE VEHICLES FOR THEM.  SEVERAL 
TIMES DURING THE CONVERSATION, HE SAID THE SITUATION IN 
HUE WAS \"EXTREMELY TENSE\" AND THE MONKS WERE \"ANGRY.\" 
 
14. (U) MEANWHILE, A UBCV PRESS RELEASE FROM PARIS SAID 
THAT POLICE HAVE SURROUNDED THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S RESIDENCE 
IN QUANG NGAI PROVINCE, AND \"UBCV MEMBERS TRYING TO VISIT 
HIM HAVE BEEN TURNED AWAY.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15. (SBU) CLOSE POLICE SURVEILLANCE OF UBCV MONKS LIKELY 
WILL PREVENT ANY OF THEM FROM MEETING WITH THICH HUYEN 
QUANG FOR THE TIME BEING.  THEIR SUCCESS IN SEALING OFF 
HUYEN QUANG, HOWEVER, MAY ONLY ADD TO THE FRUSTRATION AND 
RESENTMENT OF HIS SUPPORTERS (WHO ARE SIZABLE IN NUMBER). 
FURTHERMORE, VIETNAM IS STILL LEFT WITH THE PROBLEM OF AN 
AGING UBCV PATRIARCH IN AN ISOLATED PAGODA IN QUANG NGAI 
PROVINCE.  SHOULD HIS HEALTH EVENTUALLY FAIL HIM WHILE 
STILL IN DETENTION IN THIS REMOTE PROVINCE, THE TENSIONS 
OF RECENT DAYS MAY SEEM MILD IN COMPARISON.

     C. HANOI 1208              D. HCMC 0273 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: A RELIABLE CATHOLIC SOURCE IN HCMC SAID 
THAT FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE WHEN HE 
WAS ARRESTED ON MAY 17.  ON MAY 29 OR MAY 30, POLICE 
TRANSFERRED HIM FROM JAIL TO A MILITARY HOSPITAL IN HUE. 
FATHER LY REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT INTRAVENOUS 
SOLUTIONS, BUT EVENTUALLY CONSENTED TO TAKING WATER MIXED 
WITH SUGAR AND SALT.  FATHER LY REPORTEDLY THUS FAR IS NOT 
EXPERIENCING ANY SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS AS A RESULT OF 
HIS HUNGER STRIKE.  PHONE LINES TO TWO CATHOLIC PRIESTS IN 
HUE HAVE BEEN CUT OFF SINCE JUNE 5, BUT THE CATHOLIC 
SOURCE BELIEVED THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS 
INFORMATION RELATED TO THE RECENT BUDDHIST PROBLEMS (REF 
A), AND NOT TO CUT OFF INFORMATION ABOUT FATHER LY.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) REFS B AND C DESCRIBE THE CONFLICTING REPORTS OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ARREST OF FATHER LY.  BETTER 
INFORMATION IS NOW AVAILABLE.  AT 5:00 A.M. ON MAY 17, 
SEVERAL POLICEMEN ENTERED THE CHURCH WHERE FATHER LY WAS 
PREPARING TO SAY MASS.  THEY LED HIM AWAY IN FRONT OF THE 
FEW WORSHIPPERS PRESENT.  LATER IN THE MORNING, AS WORD OF 
THE ARREST SPREAD, WITNESSES SAY THAT 300 TO 500 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00688  01 OF 02  080735Z 
PARISHIONERS BEGAN CONGREGATING AT THE CHURCH AND 
DEMONSTRATING IN SUPPORT OF FATHER LY.  AUTHORITIES SENT 
IN ABOUT 300 SECURITY POLICE TO MAINTAIN ORDER.  A FIGHT 
ENSUED; POLICE USED BATONS AND ELECTRIC PRODS TO MAINTAIN 
ORDER.  WITNESSES SAY THAT POLICE DETAINED APPROXIMATELY 
10 PEOPLE FOR FIGHTING WITH THE SECURITY FORCES, BUT IT IS 
UNKNOWN WHETHER ANY OR ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN RELEASED. 
 
3. (SBU) ON JUNE 8, POLOFF MET WITH A RELIABLE CATHOLIC 
SOURCE IN HCMC.  THE SOURCE SAID THAT ON MAY 17, POLICE 
TOOK FATHER LY TO PHU THUA PRISON IN HUE WHERE HE 
IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A HUNGER STRIKE.  AFTER 10 DAYS, HE HAD 
BECOME VERY WEAK.  POLICE TRANSFERRED HIM TO MANH CA 
MILITARY HOSPITAL IN HUE ON MAY 29 OR 30.  HE REPORTEDLY 
REFUSED INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, BUT EVENTUALLY CONSENTED TO 
TAKING WATER MIXED WITH A LITTLE SUGAR AND SALT.  AS OF 
JUNE 5, HE WAS STILL AT THE HOSPITAL.  THE SOURCE SAID HE 
DID NOT BELIEVE FATHER LY WAS YET IN ANY DANGER OF SERIOUS 
HEALTH PROBLEMS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS HUNGER STRIKE. 
 
4. (SBU) THE SOURCE NOTED THAT WHILE FATHER LY WAS UNDER 
HOUSE ARREST, AUTHORITIES TOLD HIGH SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY 
STUDENT PARISHIONERS THAT IF THEY ATTENDED FATHER LY\'S 
MASSES, THEY WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND SCHOOL.  THE 
SOURCE ALSO SAID THAT AS OF JUNE 5, PHONE LINES TO TWO 
SUPPORTERS OF FATHER LY IN HUE, FATHER NGUYEN HUU GIAI AND 
FATHER PHAN VAN LOI, HAVE BEEN CUT.  HE BELIEVED THIS WAS 
AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT BUDDHIST 
PROBLEMS IN THE CITY RATHER THAN AN ATTEMPT TO CUT OFF 
INFORMATION ABOUT FATHER LY. 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00688  01 OF 02  080735Z 
5. (SBU) THE SOURCE SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DEGREE OF 
COOPERATION AND SUPPORT BETWEEN CATHOLIC AND BUDDHIST 
\"DISSIDENT\" CLERGY IN HUE.  HE SHOWED POLOFF A PHOTOGRAPH 
TAKEN FROM THE INTERNET SHOWING FATHER LY, HOA HAO ELDER 
LE QUANG LIEM, AND HUE-BASED UBCV BUDDHIST MONKS THICH 
TRAN CHI AND THICH THIEN THANH WHEN THEY MET TOGETHER IN 
HUE IN FEBRUARY TO ESTABLISH AN INTER-RELIGIOUS BODY 
OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.  BUT HE ALSO NOTED THAT 
CATHOLIC BELIEVERS WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THE UBCV BUDDHIST 
CAUSE, AND THAT BUDDHIST BELIEVERS WOULD NEVER SUPPORT THE 
CATHOLIC CAUSE, SO THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE THE TWO GROUPS 
WOULD EVER COME TOGETHER TO PROTEST GOVERNMENT REPRESSION. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
6. (SBU) POST AGREES THAT FOR HISTORICAL AND OTHER 
REASONS, THE BUDDHIST AND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES ARE 
UNLIKELY TO EVER STAND UNITED.  IN FACT, IT IS UNLIKELY 
THAT EVEN MANY CATHOLICS OUTSIDE OF HUE WOULD PUBLICLY 
SUPPORT FATHER LY\'S CAUSE.  CERTAINLY MANY VIETNAMESE 
CATHOLICS PRIVATELY EMPATHIZE WITH FATHER LY\'S CRITICAL 
VIEWS ON GVN RELIGIOUS POLICY, BUT THEY ALSO RECOGNIZE 
THAT THERE HAS NONETHELESS BEEN PROGRESS ON FREEDOM OF 
WORHSHIP OVER THE PAST 8-10 YEARS.  POST BELIEVES 
VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS BY AND LARGE PREFER A CAUTIOUS 
DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO SOLVING THEIR PROBLEMS RATHER THAN 
RISKING ALL IN A MARTYR\'S CAUSE.

2. (SBU) ON JUNE 8, POLOFF MET WITH A UBCV MONK IN HCMC 
WHO HAD TRAVELED TO QUANG NGAI ON JUNE 2 AHEAD OF THE 
PLANNED JUNE 7 CONGREGATION.  HE AND UBCV MONKS IN HUE 
WHOM POLOFF SPOKE TO BY TELEPHONE SAID THAT AT ABOUT 1:00 
A.M. ON JUNE 7 POLICE IN HUE SUMMONED THICH TRAN CHI (WHO 
WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE PLANNED HUE DELEGATION TO 
QUANG NGAI).  WHILE HE WAS STILL AT THE POLICE STATION, 
MONKS BEGAN ARRIVING AT HIS PAGODA, THE TU PHONG PAGODA, 
AT ABOUT 4:00 A.M.  BY 6:00 A.M. TRAN CHI HAD NOT YET 
RETURNED, SO THE 60 OR SO MONKS, NUNS, AND LAYPERSONS WHO 
HAD GATHERED SET OFF WITHOUT HIM.  THEY DEPARTED BY 
MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE PERSONS WHO HAD PROMISED TO SUPPLY CARS 
AND TAXIS REFUSED, EXPLAINING THAT POLICE HAD WARNED THEM 
THEIR VEHICLES WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND THEY WOULD BE 
SUBJECT TO ARREST.  SECURITY FORCES WERE PRESENT ON THE 
STREETS IN HUE, AND 10 POLICE CARS AND SEVERAL POLICE ON 
MOTORCYCLES FOLLOWED THE GROUP.  WHEN THE CONVOY REACHED 
THE LA NGA PASS IN THE MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO HOURS OUTSIDE 
OF HUE CITY, THEY MET A ROADBLOCK CONSISTING OF A LARGE 
POLICE VAN AND ABOUT THIRTY SECURITY FORCES.  POLICE TOLD 
THEM THAT THOSE WHO HAD PROPER REGISTRATION FOR THEIR 
MOTORCYCLES AND A DRIVER\'S LICENSE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO 
PROCEED.  THOSE WHO DID NOT WOULD HAVE TO RETURN HOME OR 
BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY FOR BREAKING THE LAW.  VERY FEW OF 
THE MONKS HAD THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION.  AFTER A LONG 
DISCUSSION, THEY DECIDED TO RETURN HOME.  THE POLICE CARS 
AND MOTORCYCLES ESCORTED THEM ALL THE WAY BACK TO THEIR 
SEVERAL PAGODAS. 
 
3. (SBU) ANOTHER GROUP OF ABOUT 20 UBCV BUDDHISTS DEPARTED 
HUE IN TWO VANS.  THEY REACHED QUANG NGAI IN THE AFTERNOON 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00699  01 OF 03  110320Z 
OF JUNE 7, BUT STOPPED AT A POLICE ROADBLOCK ABOUT TWO 
KILOMETERS FROM THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S PAGODA.  POLICE 
REPORTEDLY DETAINED THIS GROUP AND THEY REMAINED IN 
DETENTION ON JUNE 8.  (POST WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE NAMES 
OF ANY OF THE DETAINED BUDDHISTS OR ANY FURTHER DETAILS OF 
THEIR REPORTED DETENTION.) 
 
4. (SBU) AT LEAST ANOTHER 25 OTHER UBCV MONKS, NUNS AND 
SUPPORTERS FROM HUE TRAVELED TO QUANG NGAI AND WERE TURNED 
AWAY AT THE ROADBLOCK TO THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S PAGODA.  THEY 
CURRENTLY REMAIN IN QUANG NGAI TOWN AND ARE IN CONTACT 
WITH SUPPORTERS IN HCMC AND HUE BY MOBILE PHONE.  THEY 
REPORTED THAT A TWELVE-YEAR-OLD MALE BUDDHIST NOVICE WAS 
TAKEN INTO POLICE CUSTODY IN QUANG NGAI TOWN ON THE 
MORNING OF JUNE 7.  POLICE FOUND HIM PASSING OUT LEAFLETS 
CRITICIZING THE GOVERNMENT FOR INTERFERING IN RELIGIOUS 
AFFAIRS.  THE BOY IS A RESIDENT OF QUANG NGAI. 
 
5. (SBU) UBCV BUDDHISTS IN HUE AND IN QUANG NGAI SAY THAT 
TENSIONS ARE VERY HIGH IN BOTH PLACES, AND THAT SECURITY 
PRESENCE IS HEAVY IN THE TOWNS AND AROUND ALL THE PAGODAS. 
THEY SAY POLICE ARE ASKING FOR IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS 
FROM ANY MONK OR NUN THEY SEE ON THE STREET.  THE UBCV 
BUDDHISTS ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO 
NEXT AND REPORTEDLY HAVE NOT RULED OUT THE IDEA OF PUBLIC 
DEMONSTRATIONS.

HCMC AT 6:00 P.M. ON JUNE 1, DROVE THROUGH THE NIGHT, AND 
REACHED QUANG NGAI LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 2.  THE 
MONK HAD VISITED THICH HUYEN QUANG ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN 
THE PAST FEW YEARS WITHOUT INCIDENT AND IS KNOWN BY THE 
LOCAL POLICE.  THIS TIME HE AND HIS DRIVER WERE STOPPED AT 
A ROADBLOCK ABOUT ONE KILOMETER FROM HUYEN QUANG\'S PAGODA. 
HE SAID THERE WERE ABOUT 40 POLICEMEN AND TEN SOLDIERS 
MANNING THE ROADBLOCK.  HE COULD SEE ANOTHER 40 OR 50 
SECURITY FORCES IN SMALL GROUPS FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD. 
 
7. (SBU) HE CAME OUT OF HIS VEHICLE AND SAT WITH THE 
POLICEMAN IN CHARGE IN A TENT SET UP NEARBY.  THE 
POLICEMAN READ A WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM THE PROVINCIAL 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE THAT STATED THE AREA WAS UNDER A PUBLIC 
HEALTH QUARANTINE BECAUSE OF AN OUTBREAK OF VIRAL DISEASE, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00699  02 OF 03  110320Z 
AND NO ONE WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER.  AFTER THIS FORMALITY, 
THE POLICE QUESTIONED HIM FOR TWO HOURS.  THEY ASKED HIM 
ABOUT HIS RECENT VISITS TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO 
THAILAND.  (HE HAD VISITED THE U.S., THAILAND AND CHINA 
EARLIER THIS YEAR.)  THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE 
BUDDHISTS IN THESE COUNTRIES WERE SAYING ABOUT THE 
SITUATION REGARDING THICH HUYEN QUANG AND IF THEY WERE 
INVOLVED IN PLANNING PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS AGAINST THE 
GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM.  THEY ALSO ASKED HIM ABOUT RECENT 
PROGRAMMING ON RADIO FREE ASIA.  THEY TOLD HIM THAT THICH 
QUANG DO WAS CAUSING SOCIAL INSTABILITY, AND THAT THEY 
WERE SIMPLY DOING THEIR JOBS IN MAINTAINING SOCIAL ORDER. 
THEN THEY LET HIM GO.  WHEN HE LEFT, IT WAS AFTER DARK. 
HE NOTICED THAT THE ELECTRICAL POWER IN THE AREA (THE ROAD 
TO THE PAGODA GOES THROUGH A SMALL VILLAGE) WAS CUT, BUT 
THE POLICE HAD A GENERATOR. 
 
8. (SBU) HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN QUANG NGAI TOWN WHERE 
HE HAD PLANNED TO SPEND THE NIGHT, BUT DECIDED INSTEAD TO 
RETURN IMMEDIATELY TO HCMC.  THE NEXT DAY, HE HEARD THAT 
POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR HIM AT THE HOUSE AND AT SEVERAL 
PAGODAS IN THE AREA. 
 
CONFLICTING REPORTS OF RESTRICTIONS IN HCMC 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) THE HCMC-BASED UBCV MONK SAID THAT OVER A FIVE- 
DAY PERIOD BEGINNING JUNE 1, POLICE IN HCMC SEARCHED ALL 
OR NEARLY ALL THE PAGODAS IN HCMC.  POLICE SUMMONED MANY 
PERSONS FOR QUESTIONING, AND FINED SOME OF THEM CERTAIN 
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR VARIOUS OFFENSES.  AT HIS PAGODA, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00699  02 OF 03  110320Z 
FIVE NUNS AND LAY PERSONS WERE QUESTIONED.  HE KNEW 
PERSONALLY OF PEOPLE AT SEVERAL OTHER PAGODAS IN THE CITY 
WHO HAD SIMILAR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE POLICE. 
 
10. (SBU) HE ALSO SAID THAT ON JUNE 1, THE HCMC DEPARTMENT 
OF PUBLIC SECURITY, THE COMMITTEE FOR RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS, 
AND THE OFFICIAL BUDDHIST ASSOCIATION HELD A MEETING AT 
THE AN QUANG PAGODA IN HCMC.  OFFICIAL BUDDHIST 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE CITY\'S DISTRICTS ATTENDED 
THE MEETING.  THEY LATER PASSED WORD VERBALLY TO THE 
CITY\'S PAGODAS OF TWO DECISIONS MADE AT THE MEETING: 1) 
THAT NO LAY PERSONS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY OVERNIGHT AT 
ANY PAGODAS IN THE CITY FOR THREE MONTHS, AND 2) THAT FOR 
THREE MONTHS, ANY BUDDHIST MONK OR NUN GOING OUTSIDE A 
PAGODA SHOULD TRAVEL BY CAR OR TAXI, AND WOULD NOT BE 
ALLOWED TO TRAVEL BY MOTORCYCLE, BICYCLE, OR BY FOOT.  THE 
UBCV MONK SURMISED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS RATHER ODD 
DECISION WAS TO DISCOURAGE BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS FROM 
TRAVELING AND ALSO TO KEEP THEM FROM BEING SEEN IN PUBLIC, 
DURING THIS SENSITIVE TIME. 
 
11. (SBU) CONGEN CALLED THE OFFICIAL HCMC BUDDHIST 
ASSOCIATION ON JUNE 8 TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE DECISIONS MADE 
AT THE JUNE 1ST MEETING.  THICH HIEN PHAP, THE SECRETARY 
GENERAL OF THE ASSOCIATION, SAID THERE HAD BEEN A MEETING, 
BUT ONLY AMONG BUDDHISTS.  HE SAID THE MEETING HAD BEEN TO 
ENCOURAGE MONKS AND NUNS TO OBSERVE MORE CLOSELY THIS YEAR 
THE TRADITIONAL BUDDHIST \"PERIOD OF MEDITATION,\" WHICH 
OCCURS IN THE SUMMER.  FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, THE 
ASSOCIATION IS ENCOURAGING MONKS AND NUNS TO REMAIN IN 
THEIR PAGODAS TO MEDITATE.  HE SAID THAT IF A MONK OR NUN 
FOUND IT NECESSARY TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR PAGODAS, THEY COULD 
GO BY ANY MEANS OF TRANSPORT THEY CHOSE. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
12. (SBU) POST WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AND 
REPORT ON SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AS THEY UNFOLD.  POST 
BELIEVES THAT THE WELL-COORDINATED PUBLIC SECURITY 
RESPONSE TO THE PLANNED UBCV PROVOCATION (INTIMIDATING 
INDIVIDUALS BY SEARCHING PAGODAS, QUESTIONING THEM AT 
POLICE STATIONS, CUTTING PHONE LINES, ROADBLOCKS, 
ENCOURAGING OBSERVANCE OF THE \"PERIOD OF MEDITATION,\" 
PLACING THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S PAGODA UNDER \"QUARANTINE\") AND 
THE INTEREST POLICE SHOWED IN ASKING ABOUT OVERSEAS

SUPPORT OF THE UBCV ALL UNDERSCORE THE INSECURITY OF THE 
AUTHORITIES IN THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE UBCV BUDDHISTS. 
EVENTS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND THE GOVERNMENT\'S 
RESPONSE PROVE THAT THE ORGANIZATION IT OUTLAWED 20 YEARS 
AGO, REMAINS A RELIGIOUS (AS WELL AS A POLITICAL) FORCE TO 
BE RECKONED WITH.

INTERROGATIONS BUT NO ARRESTS IN HUE 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (SBU) REF A REPORTED THAT POLICE IN QUANG NGAI 
PROVINCE HAD DETAINED ABOUT 20 UBCV MONKS, NUNS AND 
SUPPORTERS AFTER STOPPING THEIR TWO VANS AT A ROADBLOCK 
ABOUT TWO KILOMETERS FROM PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG\'S 
PAGODA.  IN PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH SEVERAL BUDDHIST 
SOURCES IN HUE ON JUNE 14, POLOFF LEARNED TODAY THERE 
WERE 18 BUDDHIST MONKS AND NUNS IN THIS GROUP, AND THAT 
THEY WERE DETAINED ONLY 2-3 HOURS.  REF A ALSO REPORTED 
THAT ANOTHER GROUP OF ABOUT 25 UBCV BUDDHISTS WHOM 
POLICE HAD PREVENTED FROM ENTERING THE PATRIARCH\'S 
PAGODA REMAINED IN QUANG NGAI AND WERE CONSIDERING 
STAGING PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS.  INFORMATION OBTAINED ON 
JUNE 14 INDICATES THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE 
BUDDHISTS WHO HAD TRAVELED FROM HUE TO QUANG NGAI HAVE 
RETURNED TO HUE AND ARE NOT PLANNING ANY FURTHER 
PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS. 
 
3. (SBU) THICH THAI HOA AND THICH THIEN HANH EACH LED A 
GROUP OF BUDDHISTS FROM HUE TO QUANG NGAI.  (NOTE: 
THICH THAI HOA AT THE TU HIEU PAGODA IN HUE WAS ONE OF 
THE MOST CAREFULLY WATCHED UBCV MONKS.  THAT HE WAS 
ABLE TO ACTUALLY GET OUT AND LEAD A GROUP ALL THE WAY 
TO QUANG NGAI WAS QUITE A FEAT.  END NOTE.)  THICH CHI 
THANH AND THICH CHAN TRI (REF A MISSPELLED HIS NAME AS 
THICH TRAN CHI) ALSO ORGANIZED GROUPS, BUT DID NOT 
ACTUALLY TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI THEMSELVES.  POLICE IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00734  01 OF 02  150909Z 
HUE REPEATEDLY HAVE CALLED IN ALL FOUR OF THESE MONKS 
FOR INTERROGATION SESSIONS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, BUT 
HAVE NOT PLACED ANY OF THEM UNDER ARREST. 
 
4. (SBU) POLOFF CALLED THE TU HIEU PAGODA JUNE 14, AND 
ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THICH THAI HOA.  THE PERSON WHO 
ANSWERED THE PHONE SAID THAT THAI HOA WAS AT THE POLICE 
STATION, AND THAT HE HAS BEEN HELD THERE FOR 
QUESTIONING ALL DAY FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS, BUT ALLOWED 
TO RETURN TO THE PAGODA AT NIGHT. 
 
5. (SBU) POLOFF WAS ABLE TO REACH THICH CHAN TRI AT THE 
THIEN LAM PAGODA.  REF A REPORTED THAT POLICE HAD 
CALLED HIM IN AT 1:00 A.M. ON JUNE 7, JUST A FEW HOURS 
BEFORE 60 MONKS, NUNS AND SUPPORTERS ASSEMBLED AT HIS 
PAGODA TO TRAVEL TO QUANG NGAI.  ON THE TELEPHONE, CHAN 
TRI SEEMED NERVOUS AND HESITATED SEVERAL TIMES DURING 
THE CONVERSATION.  HE SAID THAT \"SOMEONE\" HAD COME TO 
HIS PAGODA AT 1:00 A.M. ON JUNE 7 TO TELL HIM HIS 
MOTHER WAS SICK, HE HAD GONE TO HER HOME - NOT TO THE 
POLICE STATION - AND THAT WAS WHY HE DID NOT JOIN THE 
DELEGATION TO QUANG NGAI.  HE ALSO SAID THE ATMOSPHERE 
IN HUE WAS MUCH CALMER TODAY THAN IT HAD BEEN A FEW 
DAYS BEFORE. 
 
6. (SBU) POLOFF ALSO REACHED THICH CHI THANG AT THE 
PHUOC THANH PAGODA.  HE BEGAN TO RELATE THAT 
AUTHORITIES AT THE PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND HAMLET 
LEVEL WERE CONSTANTLY SUMMONING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING 
WHEN LOUD STATIC CAME ON THE LINE.  CHI THANG SAID THE 
STATIC WAS DUE TO POLICE INTERFERENCE ON THE PHONE 
LINE.  WE WERE UNABLE TO CARRY ON THE CONVERSATION. 
(NOTE: REF B REPORTED THAT THE PHONE LINES AT ALL THREE 
OF THE ABOVE PAGODAS HAD BEEN CUT.  THAT THE LINES ARE 
NOW WORKING AGAIN IS AN IMPROVEMENT, BUT IT IS OBVIOUS 
THAT POLICE ARE STILL LISTENING.  END NOTE.) 
 
7. (U) ALSO ON JUNE 14, POLOFF SPOKE WITH PENELOPE 
FAULKNER OF THE UBCV INFORMATION BUREAU IN PARIS.  SHE 
SAID THAT IN ADDITION TO THE GROUPS OF BUDDHISTS LISTED 
ABOVE AND IN REFTELS WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO TRAVEL FROM 
HUE TO QUANG NGAI, ANOTHER GROUP OF 17 UBCV MONKS 
ATTEMPTED TO DEPART HUE ON JUNE 7 BY MOTORCYCLE. 
BEFORE THEY LEFT THE CITY LIMITS, HOWEVER, A GROUP OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00734  02 OF 02  150909Z 
ABOUT 20 YOUNG MEN, ALSO ON MOTORCYCLE, ACCOSTED THEM, 
THREATENED THEM, AND EVENTUALLY CHASED THEM BACK TO 
THEIR PAGODAS. 
 
QUANG NGAI READY TO MOVE PATRIARCH, BUT NOT TO HCMC 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
8. (U) FAULKNER ALSO TOLD POLOFF THAT FOR THE PAST TWO 
WEEKS, AUTHORITIES IN QUANG NGAI HAVE BEEN PRESSURING 
THICH HUYEN QUANG TO SIGN A REQUEST TO MOVE TO A 
MONASTERY IN NEIGHBORING BINH DINH PROVINCE.  (THE 
PATRIARCH HAD BEEN THE HEAD OF THE MONASTERY AT SOME 
TIME IN THE PAST.)  BINH DINH IS JUST SOUTH OF QUANG 
NGAI, STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES FROM HCMC.  IT IS 
HARDLY LESS ISOLATED THAN QUANG NGAI.  THE PATRIARCH 
REPORTEDLY REFUSED TO SIGN THE REQUEST. 
 
9. (SBU) IN HCMC, THICH QUANG DO REMAINS UNDER HOUSE 
ARREST.  HIS PHONES ARE CUT OFF, AND POLICE HAVE 
ALLOWED HIM NO VISITORS SINCE THE HOUSE ARREST ORDER 
WAS PUT INTO EFFECT ON JUNE 1.  ONE UBCV MONK ATTEMPTED 
TO VISIT QUANG DO ON JUNE 10.  HE ENTERED THE PAGODA, 
BUT THE PLAINCLOTHES POLICE WHO GUARD THE STAIRS TO THE 
RESIDENCE POLITELY TOLD HIM HE COULD NOT GO UPSTAIRS. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) POLICE SUCCESSFULLY PREVENTED THE UBCV 
BUDDHISTS FROM TAKING PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG TO 
HCMC WITHOUT PERMISSION.  UBCV MONKS IN HUE CONTINUE TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00734  02 OF 02  150909Z 
SOUND FRUSTRATED AND RESENTFUL, BUT THEY DO NOT PLAN 
ANY FURTHER PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS AT THIS TIME.  ALTHOUGH 
IT APPEARS SECURITY FORCES HAVE THE SITUATION WELL 
UNDER CONTROL, CONCERNS FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PATRIARCH 
IS AN ISSUE THAT WON\'T JUST GO AWAY.  THE GVN COULD 
SAVE ITSELF A LOT OF TROUBLE BY SIMPLY MOVING THE 83- 
YEAR-OLD MONK TO HCMC, WHERE GOOD MEDICAL TREATMENT IS 
AVAILABLE, BEFORE HIS HEALTH STARTS TO FAIL.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S FAREWELL CALLS IN HCMC 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: AMBASSADOR PETERSON PAID FAREWELL CALLS IN 
HCMC ON JUNE 11 AT THE CITY\'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS 
OFFICE, AT THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS, AND 
AT THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  THE AMBASSADOR 
REVIEWED THE PROGRESS MADE IN THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, NOTING THAT 
RATIFICATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), 
WHICH IS NOW BEFORE THE U.S. CONGRESS, WOULD MARK THE 
FINAL STEP IN THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS.  REMARKING ON 
THE RISE IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN HCMC OVER THE 
PAST FEW YEARS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID HE BELIEVED 
IMPROVED BILATERAL RELATIONS HAVE HAD A SOCIAL AS WELL 
AS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE.  HE 
SAID THE USG WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A COOPERATIVE RATHER 
THAN CONFRONTATIONAL APPROACH TO THE OBJECTIVE OF 
IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.  HE STATED USG 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  01 OF 03  150909Z 
OBJECTIONS TO THE RECENT ARRESTS OF RELIGIOUS FIGURES 
IN VIETNAM.  WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ALLOWING GREATER 
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOMS CARRIES THE RISK OF LESS 
STABILITY, HE STATED EMPHATICALLY THAT THE RISKS ARE 
FAR OUTWEIGHED BY THE UNLEASHING OF SOCIAL CREATIVITY 
AND PRODUCTIVITY.  ALTHOUGH HIS VIETNAMESE 
INTERLOCUTORS DEFENDED THEIR HANDLING OF \"SUBVERSIVES\" 
AND EXPLAINED THEIR OUTLOOK REGARDING A FREE SOCIETY 
VERSUS A STABLE SOCIETY, THEY APPEARED TO BE SINCERE IN 
THEIR COMMENTS.  THEY THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HIS 
EFFORTS IN NORMALIZING RELATIONS, EXPRESSED HOPE FOR 
EARLY RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, AND SAID THEY LOOKED 
FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE FOUNDATION OF 
TRUST AND FRIENDSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE TWO 
COUNTRIES THUS FAR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CALL AT EXTERNAL RELATION OFFICE 
-------------------------------- 
 
2. AT THE HCMC EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE (THE HCMC 
BRANCH OF THE FOREIGN MINISTRY), AMBASSADOR PETERSON 
PAID A FAREWELL CALL ON DIRECTOR LE QUOC HUNG.  HUNG 
WAS NAMED DIRECTOR IN APRIL.  PREVIOUSLY, HE WAS ONE OF 
THREE DEPUTY DIRECTORS AND WAS THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF 
COORDINATING THE HCMC PORTION OF PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S 
VISIT TO HCMC IN NOVEMBER.  AMBASSADOR THANKED HUNG FOR 
THE SUPPORT OF HIS OFFICE OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, 
PARTICULARLY FOR ASSISTANCE ON VIP VISITS, AND 
ESPECIALLY THAT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON. 
 
3. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00735  01 OF 03  150909Z 
HAS MATURED, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, AND HAS BECOME MORE 
COMPLEX.  THE TWO COUNTRIES WILL NOT ALWAYS AGREE ON 
EVERY ISSUE, SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON 
THE LEVEL OF TRUST THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED THUS FAR.  WE 
HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE WE CAN DISAGREE ON SOME 
THINGS WHILE CONTINUING TO MOVE AHEAD ON OTHERS. 
 
4. THE AMBASSADOR STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALLOWING 
U.S. DIPLOMATS TO TRAVEL AND MEET PEOPLE FREELY.  U.S. 
MISSION OFFICERS CAN BE COUNTED ON TO REPORT 
OBJECTIVELY, AND IN THIS WAY CAN BE ALLIES IN 
DISPELLING EXAGGERATIONS AND RUMORS.  WE WILL REPORT ON 
THINGS WE DO NOT AGREE ON, SUCH AS THE DETENTION OF 
INDIVIDUALS FOR PEACEFULLY EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS, 
BUT WE WILL ALSO REPORT ON THE POSITIVE THINGS VIETNAM 
IS DOING. 
 
5. DIRECTOR HUNG AGREED THAT THE TWO COUNTRIES HAVE 
BUILT A FOUNDATION OF TRUST IN THE FEW YEARS SINCE 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED.  HE ADDED, 
HOWEVER, THAT IN SOME PLACES AT CERTAIN LEVELS OF 
GOVERNMENT, DISTRUST REMAINS - THE LINGERING RESULTS OF 
A LONG AND PAINFUL WAR.  IT WILL TAKE TIME, HE SAID, 
AND EFFORT TO KEEP THE RELATIONSHIP MOVING FORWARD. 
BECAUSE THE BTA WOULD BE A MAJOR STEP FORWARD, HE HOPED 
THE U.S. CONGRESS WOULD RATIFY THE BTA QUICKLY. 
 
6. IN REPLY TO AMBASSADOR PETERSON\'S REMARK THAT 
AMERICAN PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS DUE TO 
THEIR HISTORY AS A NATION FOUNDED BY REFUGEES WHO HAD 
FLED INTOLERANCE, HUNG SAID HE UNDERSTOOD THE AMERICAN 
PERSPECTIVE.  BUT HE SAID THE VIETNAMESE HISTORY OF 
4000 YEARS OF FIGHTING OFF EXTERNAL INVADERS HAS MADE 
ITS MARK ON THE VIETNAMESE PSYCHE.  VIETNAMESE PEOPLE 
VALUE INDEPENDENCE AND FREEDOM FROM OUTSIDE 
INTERFERENCE ABOVE ALL ELSE.  INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ARE 
ALSO HIGHLY VALUED, BUT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO BALANCE 
THE EQUALLY VALUED CONCEPTS OF STABILITY AND SECURITY. 
HE NOTED THAT AT PRESENT, VIETNAM IS THE MOST 
POLITICALLY STABLE NATION IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  AND ITS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  02 OF 03  150909Z 
STABILITY IS ALLOWING VIETNAM TO DEVELOP ITS ECONOMY 
AND IMPROVE THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR ITS PEOPLE. 
 
7. AMBASSADOR PETERSON AGREED THAT FREEDOM SHOULD BE 
LIMITED TO ACTIVITY WITHIN THE RULE OF LAW, BUT HE 
QUESTIONED HOW ALLOWING ONE INDIVIDUAL, SUCH AS 
BUDDHIST THICH HUYEN QUANG, TO FREELY CHOOSE HIS PLACE 
OF RESIDENCE COULD HAVE ANY EFFECT ON VIETNAM\'S 
SECURITY.  ALLOWING GREATER FREEDOM TO EXPRESS OPINIONS 
DOES CARRY SOME RISKS, THE AMBASSADOR SAID, BUT THOSE 
ARE OUTWEIGHED BY FAR BY THE UNLEASHING OF SOCIETY\'S 
POTENTIAL FOR CREATIVITY AND PRODUCTIVITY. 
 
CALL AT HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
8. AMBASSADOR PETERSON ALSO MET WITH NGUYEN MINH TRIET, 
SECRETARY OF THE HCMC PARTY COMMITTEE AND FOURTH- 
 
SIPDIS 
RANKING MEMBERS OF VIETNAM\'S POLITBURO.  (TRIET IS 
RUMORED TO BE THE FRONT-RUNNER TO SUCCEED PHAN VAN KHAI 
AS PRIME MINISTER WHENEVER KHAI STEPS DOWN.)  THE 
AMBASSADOR THANKED TRIET FOR VIETNAM\'S COOPERATION 
DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF NORMALIZATION.  HE DREW 
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO VIETNAM\'S COOPERATION IN 
LOCATING AMERICAN MIA\'S, WHICH WAS THE KEY TO 
ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.  HE EXPRESSED THE 
USG DESIRE TO ASSIST VIETNAM IN LOCATING ITS OWN MIAS. 
 
9. THE AMBASSADOR TOLD TRIET THAT IT IS NORMAL FOR TWO 
COUNTRIES TO HAVE DIFFERENCES - IT IS THE MARK OF A

MISSION HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF VIETNAM, PERHAPS 
BETTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN THE PAST.  THIS WAS DUE TO 
MISSION STAFF BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL AND MEET PEOPLE 
FREELY.  HE NOTED THAT RECENT RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO 
THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HINDERED THE MISSION\'S ABILITY TO 
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PICTURE OF WHAT IS GOING ON THERE. 
HE WISHED TO SEE THOSE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS LIFTED 
QUICKLY.  HE ALSO SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM OUGHT 
TO ALLOW UBCV BUDDHIST PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG TO 
RETURN TO HIS FORMER RESIDENCE IN HCMC, AND SUGGESTED 
THE GVN MIGHT FIND IT EASIER TO DO THIS ON ITS OWN 
INITIATIVE RATHER THAN WAITING FOR INTERNATIONAL 
PRESSURE ON THE ISSUE TO BUILD. 
 
10. TRIET SAID THAT HE WANTED THE U.S. MISSION AND 
OTHER OBSERVERS TO VISIT THE HIGHLANDS TO BE ABLE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE.  HE SAID 
GENERALLY VIETNAM PLACES NO RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL 
WITHIN THE COUNTRY, BUT BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS, 
THERE ARE TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL TO SOME 
PLACES IN THE HIGHLANDS.  TRIET ALSO SAID VIETNAM 
RESPECTS RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES, BUT RELIGIOUS PERSONS, 
LIKE OTHER CITIZENS, MUST ABIDE BY THE LAWS OF THE 
COUNTRY. HE SAID SOME INDIVIDUALS, BOTH WITHIN AND 
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY, HAVE USED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS A 
PRETEXT FOR COMMITTING SUBVERSIVE ACTS.  TRIET SAID HE 
REMEMBERED THAT IN HIS YOUTH (UNDER THE SOUTH 
VIETNAMESE REGIME), HE AND OTHER STUDENTS WERE NOT 
ALLOWED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, SO HE UNDERSTOOD THE 
IMPORTANCE OF AN OPEN, DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY. 
 
11. THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT SEEN OVER THE LONG TERM, 
VIETNAM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HUMAN 
RIGHTS.  THE CHURCHES ARE FULL; THERE IS MORE OPENNESS 
AND MORE TOLERANCE OF CRITICISM.  BUT RASH RESPONSES TO 
INDIVIDUALS WHO CHALLENGE THE GOVERNMENT ARE WHAT GRAB 
THE HEADLINES.  THE USG WOULD LIKE TO COOPERATE WITH 
VIETNAM IN CREATING CONDITIONS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS 
IN HUMAN RIGHTS, AS WE HAVE IN OTHER AREAS.  THE BTA, 
FOR EXAMPLE, WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR TWO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00735  03 OF 03  150910Z 
COUNTRIES FOR GENERATIONS.  THE USG HAS ALSO 
ESTABLISHED A NEW SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FOR VIETNAM THAT 
COULD HELP PROVIDE HIGHER EDUCATION TO UP TO 200 
STUDENTS IN THE NEXT YEAR. 
 
12. TRIET AGREED WITH THE AMBASSADOR THAT THE TWO 
COUNTRIES HAVE BUILT UP A FOUNDATION OF FRIENDSHIP AND 
TRUST IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF NORMALIZATION. 
ALTHOUGH SADDENED AT AMBASSADOR PETERSON\'S DEPARTURE, 
HE LOOKED FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE NEXT AMBASSADOR 
TO DEVELOP AN EVEN GREATER DEGREE OF UNDERSTANDING 
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. 
 
MEETING WITH NEW PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
13. AMBASSADOR PETERSON CONGRATULATED LE THANH HAI ON 
HIS RECENT PROMOTION FROM FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN TO 
CHAIRMAN OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  HE SAID HE 
WAS PROUD OF THE WAY THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS 
PROGRESSED, AND TOLD HAI THAT THE BTA WAS NOW IN THE 
HANDS OF THE U.S. CONGRESS.  HE EXPECTED THE CONGRESS 
TO RATIFY THE BTA, BUT NOTED THAT IT MAY TAKE UP TO TWO 
MONTHS FOR IT TO DO SO.  HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE 
AGREEMENT TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY 
AND ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF HCMC. 
 
14. CHAIRMAN HAI SAID THAT DIFFICULTIES ARE ALWAYS 
ENCOUNTERED AT THE BEGINNING OF NEW ENDEAVORS, BUT HE 
BELIEVED THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE NEW U.S.-VIETNAM 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP HAS YIELDED REMARKABLY GOOD 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00735  03 OF 03  150910Z 
RESULTS.  HE HOPED THE U.S. CONGRESS WOULD RATIFY THE 
BTA QUICKLY AND WAS CONFIDENT THE GVN WOULD DO THE 
SAME.  HE SAID THE GOVERNMENT OF HCMC HAD JUST SENT A 
PROPOSAL TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OUTLINING SEVERAL 
SPECIAL MECHANISMS FOR THE CITY TO ACT MORE ON ITS OWN 
WITH REGARD TO ITS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  WITH A MORE 
STREAMLINED BUREAUCRACY, HE EXPECTED THE CITY TO 
ACCELERATE ITS ALREADY HIGH ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE. 
THAT, AND RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, SHOULD ATTRACT MORE 
AMERICAN AND OTHER FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO THE CITY. 
 
15. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THAT A CORNERSTONE OF THE 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WAS THE SUPPORT THE GVN HAD 
PROVIDED ON THE MIA ISSUE.  HE SAID THE COOPERATION 
BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS ON THIS ISSUE HAD DEVELOPED 
INTO A PARTNERSHIP.  HE EXPECTED THE UNITED STATES AND 
VIETNAM TO DEVELOP AN ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP JUST AS 
VITAL AND HOPED FOR GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND 
COOPERATION IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP 
MATURED.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S CATHOLIC CO-REDEMPTRIX ORDER 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: ON MAY 23, POLOFF VISITED WITH 
PRIESTS OF THE VIETNAMESE CATHOLIC ORDER OF CO- 
REDEMPTION IN HCMC.  ALTHOUGH ONLY TWO OF ITS MEMBERS 
ARE CURRENTLY IN PRISON, THE ORDER HAS BEEN AMONG THE 
MOST PERSECUTED OF VIETNAM\'S RELIGIOUS GROUPS SINCE 
1975.  IT STILL OPERATES AN \"UNDERGROUND SEMINARY\" IN 
HCMC.  UNTIL NOW, INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO POST ABOUT 
THE ORDER HAD ALL BEEN SECOND-HAND.  THE VISIT PROVIDED 
USEFUL FIRST-HAND BACKGROUND ON THIS RELIGIOUS ORDER\'S 
HISTORY OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ORIGINS OF THE CO-REDEMPTRIX ORDER 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) POLOFF AND CONGEN INTERPRETER VISITED THE 
CATHOLIC ORDER OF CO-REDEMPTION ON MAY 23 IN HCMC\'S THU 
DUC DISTRICT.  AFTER BEING LED TO AN INNER CHAMBER TO 
AVOID BEING OVERHEARD BY A PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN WHO 
ENTERED THE COMPOUND WITHIN A MINUTE OF THEIR ARRIVAL, 
THEY MET WITH AN ELDERLY PRIEST WHO WOULD IDENTIFY 
HIMSELF ONLY AS \"FATHER JOHN.\"  FATHER JOHN, LIKE THE 
OTHER CO-REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS, WAS BORN IN BUI CHU 
DIOCESE SOUTHEAST OF HANOI.  HE WAS AMONG THE 40 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00754  01 OF 02  200231Z 
PERSONS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY DURING A POLICE RAID ON THE 
ORDER IN 1987.  HE, ALONG WITH FATHER TRAN DINH THU 
(FOUNDER OF THE ORDER), RECEIVED A 19-YEAR PRISON 
SENTENCE, BUT LIKE FATHER THU, HE WAS RELEASED IN 1993 
AFTER SERVING SIX AND ONE HALF YEARS. 
 
3. (U) FATHER TRAN DINH THU, BORN IN NORTHERN VIETNAM 
IN 1906, FOUNDED THE ORDER OF CO-REDEMPTION IN 1953 IN 
BUI CHU DIOCESE.  FATHER JOHN SAID THAT IN THE EARLY 
1950\'S \"A STATE OF WAR\" EXISTED BETWEEN THE COMMUNISTS 
AND THE CATHOLIC DIOCESES OF BUI CHU AND NEIGHBORING 
PHAT DIEM.  FATHER THU ESTABLISHED THE ORDER NOT TO 
ENGAGE IN THE ARMED FIGHTING, ACCORDING TO FATHER JOHN, 
BUT ONLY TO EVANGELIZE AMONG THE NON-CHRISTIANS IN THE 
NORTH. 
 
4. (SBU) FATHER THU, FATHER JOHN AND THE OTHER CO- 
REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS WERE AMONG THE MORE THAN 600 
CATHOLIC PRIESTS WHO JOINED THE EXODUS OF NEARLY ONE 
MILLION PEOPLE (MOSTLY CATHOLICS) WHO ESCAPED TO THE 
SOUTH IN 1954 AHEAD OF PARTITION.  THEY ESTABLISHED A 
15-ACRE HEADQUARTERS AND SEMINARY IN THE THU DUC 
DISTRICT OF PRESENT-DAY HCMC, AND GRADUALLY EXPANDED 
THEIR MISSION TO THE MEKONG DELTA AND SOUTH CENTRAL 
VIETNAM.  FATHER JOHN SAID THAT EVEN NOW, ALL OF THE CO- 
REDEMPTRIX PRIESTS ORIGINALLY ARE FROM THE BUI CHU 
DIOCESE; POLOFF NOTICED THAT EVERYONE HE HEARD ON THE 
GROUNDS ON MAY 23 SPOKE WITH A NORTH VIETNAMESE ACCENT.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00754  01 OF 02  200231Z 
 
5. (SBU) AFTER APRIL 30, 1975, SOME 60 MEMBERS OF THE 
ORDER WERE ARRESTED, INCLUDING THE FOUNDER, FATHER THU. 
MOST OF THOSE ARRESTED, INCLUDING FATHER THU, WERE 
RELEASED IN 1977.  BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE GOVERNMENT 
CONFISCATED THE ORDER\'S PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTH OF 
VIETNAM - SCHOOLS, ORPHANAGES, RELIGIOUS TRAINING 
CENTERS - EXCEPT FOR THE 15-ACRE SITE AT THU DUC. 
 
6. (SBU) ON MAY 15, 1987, VIETNAMESE SECURITY FORCES 
SURROUNDED THE ORDER\'S 15-ACRE COMPLEX AND ARRESTED 40 
PRIESTS AND LAYPERSONS, INCLUDING FATHER THU AND FATHER 
JOHN.  THEY CLOSED THE MONASTERY AT THE SITE AND 
CONFISCATED THE PROPERTY.  FATHER THU AND FATHER JOHN 
RECEIVED 19-YEAR PRISON SENTENCES, BUT WERE RELEASED IN 
1993 AFTER SERVING SIX AND ONE HALF YEARS.  ALL BUT TWO 
OF THE OTHERS ARRESTED IN 1987 ALSO HAVE SINCE BEEN 
RELEASED.  THE TWO WHO REMAIN IN PRISON ARE FATHER PHAM 
MINH TRI AND LAYPERSON NGUYEN THIEN PHUNG INCARCERATED 
AT Z30A PRISON AT XUAN LOC IN DONG NAI PROVINCE. 
FATHER JOHN SAID SIXTY-YEAR OLD FATHER TRI HAS BEEN 
SUFFERING NERVOUS/MENTAL PROBLEMS FOR THE PAST FIVE 
YEARS AS A RESULT OF HIS IMPRISONMENT. 
 
 
7. (SBU) THE ORDER\'S SCHOOL BUILDINGS AT THE 15-ACRE 
SITE HAVE NOW BEEN TURNED INTO A GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. 
SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS ON THE SITE HAVE BEEN 
TURNED INTO A TEXTILE FACTORY.  THIRTEEN PRIESTS AND 30 
LAYPERSONS NOW LIVE AT THE SITE NEAR THE OLD 
HEADQUARTERS ON PROPERTY DONATED TO THEM BY A CATHOLIC 
LAYMAN.  FATHER JOHN SAID THERE WERE 300 TO 400 OTHER 
\"UNOFFICIAL RESIDENTS\" AT THIS SITE.  THEN HE WHISPERED 
IN ENGLISH THAT THE ORDER STILL OPERATES AN 
\"UNDERGROUND SEMINARY\" THERE. 
 
8. (SBU) FATHER JOHN SAID POLICE USED TO COME INTO THE 
COMPOUND THREE OR FOUR TIMES A MONTH TO \"HARASS THE 
RESIDENTS.\" BUT BEGINNING ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, AFTER 
THE INVESTITURE OF FATHER PHAM MINH MAN AS ARCHBISHOP 
OF HCMC ARCHDIOCESE, THEY HAVE EASED UP AND NOW ENTER 
ONLY OCCASIONALLY.  FATHER JOHN NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT 
THE DISTRICT POLICE STATION IS \"CONVENIENTLY LOCATED\" 
JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE COMPOUND.

PAGE 03        HO CHI  00754  02 OF 02  200231Z 
 
9. (SBU) POLOFF HAD REQUESTED TO MEET WITH THE ORDER\'S 
95-YEAR-OLD FOUNDER, FATHER TRAN DINH THU, BUT WAS TOLD 
ON ARRIVAL THAT FATHER THU WAS \"TOO TIRED\" TO MEET.  ON 
DEPARTURE, HOWEVER, FATHER JOHN BROUGHT POLOFF INTO 
ANOTHER ROOM WHERE FATHER THU WAS TALKING WITH SEVERAL 
PRIESTS AND NUNS.  ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED EXTREMELY 
FRAIL, FATHER THU DID NOT SEEM ALL THAT TIRED.  IN 
THEIR TWO-MINUTE CONVERSATION, FATHER THU NOTED THAT 
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO WELCOME A WESTERN VISITOR TO HIS CHAMBERS. 
 
10. (SBU) BUT THE CO-REDEMPTRIX ORDER DOES HAVE WESTERN 
CONNECTIONS.  FATHER JOHN STATED THAT THE ORDER HAD 
ESTABLISHED A RELATIONSHIP WITH A CATHOLIC PARISH IN 
CARTHAGE, MISSOURI.  DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST 
EVERY YEAR, THE CHURCH IN CARTHAGE WELCOMES THOUSANDS 
OF VIETNAMESE-AMERICAN CATHOLICS WHO COME THERE TO PRAY 
IN FRONT OF A STATUE OF MARY THAT WAS FASHIONED IN AND 
IMPORTED FROM FATIMA IN PORTUGAL.  (NOTE: VIETNAMESE 
CATHOLICS IN VIETNAM MAKE A SIMILAR PILGRIMAGE IN THE 
FIRST WEEK OF AUGUST TO A CHURCH IN LA VANG IN CENTRAL 
VIETNAM AT THE SITE WHERE MARY IS SAID TO HAVE APPEARED 
200 YEARS AGO.  END NOTE.) 
 
COMMENT

11. (U) WITH ONLY A FOUR-YEAR DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN 
HCMC AFTER A MORE THAN 20-YEAR ABSENCE, CONGEN 
PERSONNEL STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT VIETNAM\'S

POSTWAR YEARS.  POST CONTINUES TO SEEK OUT AND MEET 
HISTORICAL FIGURES SINCE THE PAST IN VIETNAM CONTINUES 
TO HAUNT EVERY ASPECT OF THE PRESENT, AND THE 
HISTORICAL LEGACIES OFTEN HOLD KEYS TO BETTER 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE MORE CURRENT ISSUES.

THE PEOPLE OF CAN THO TO FOREIGN CULTURES IN ORDER TO 
IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING, AND TO ATTRACT FOREIGN NGOS TO 
THE PROVINCE TO DO WORK IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH,

WHICH TOLD OF A NEW KOREAN FAST FOOD RESTAURANT IN CAN 
THO PROVINCE, RAN A PHOTO OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, 
COMPLETE WITH A \"MCDONALD\'S\" SIGN AND THE FAMOUS GOLDEN

AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN HO CHI MINH CITY, TO BE 
PASSED TO THE LAW FIRM THAT ACTS AS LOCAL 
REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE MCDONALD\'S CORPORATION.   AMCHAM 
WAS UNAWARE OF THIS TRADEMARK VIOLATION. 
 
7. CONOFF VISITED THE RESTAURANT FORMERLY KNOWN AND 
ADVERTISED AS MCDONALD\'S IN THE HEART OF CAN THO.  THE 
SIGNS NO LONGER READ MCDONALD\'S, THOUGH A LARGE PICTURE 
OF A BURGER AND FRIES IS STILL OUTSIDE WITH THE GOLD 
\"M\" EMBLEMS ERASED OFF THE PACKAGING.  AMERICAN TALK 
RADIO WAS BLASTING IN THE ENTRY, AND INSIDE A LARGE 
GROUP OF CUSTOMERS WERE WATCHING AN AMERICAN WESTERN 
DUBBED INTO VIETNAMESE AND SUBTITLED IN CHINESE.  UPON 
ENTERING THE RESTAURANT, A VIETNAMESE MAN SPEAKING

OUT OF HIS CHAIR TO SEE WHAT CONOFF WANTED.  HE QUICKLY 
INFORMED US THAT THE RESTAURANT WAS UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP 
AS OF 9 DAYS PRIOR, THE FORMER KOREAN OWNERS HAD LEFT, 
AND THE NAME HAD CHANGED.  IT SEEMS THAT THE PREVIOUS 
OWNERS HAD SOME FEARS OF LITIGATION FROM THE MCDONALD\'S 
CORPORATION, AS THEY HAD NEVER GOTTEN PERMISSION TO USE 
THE TRADEMARK NAME.

SUBJECT: ACTING CONSUL GENERAL\'S MEETING WITH NEW HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRWOMAN 
 
1. SUMMARY: DEPUTY PRINCIPAL OFFICER AND ACTING CONSUL 
GENERAL SHARON WHITE MET AUGUST 27 WITH HCMC PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRWOMAN HUYNH THI NHAN.  MS. NHAN IS 
ONE OF THREE NEW VICE-CHAIRPERSONS APPOINTED TO THE 
HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN MAY.  (THERE ARE A TOTAL OF 
FIVE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE VICE-CHAIRPERSONS.)  IN 
HER FIRST OFFICIAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE CONSULATE 
GENERAL, MS. NHAN APPEARED KNOWLEDGEABLE AND AT EASE 
WITH THE VARIETY OF ISSUES HCMC (THE CITY) FACES IN ITS 
CURRENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
URBAN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 
---------------------------- 
 
2. ACG WHITE NOTED THAT MANY PEOPLE VIEW HCMC AS A 
MODEL OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE REST OF VIETNAM.  ACG ALSO 
INQUIRED ABOUT THE SRV CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GRANTING HCMC 
LATITUDE TO EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01042  01 OF 02  060053Z 
ADDRESSING DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS.  MS. NHAN SAID THAT 
HANOI AND HCMC ARE REFERRED TO AS CITIES WITH A SPECIAL 
ADMINISTRATIVE STATUS, BUT IN FACT, THEY OPERATE AS 
PROVINCES.  THE SRV CENTRAL GOVERNMENT, IN FACT, HAS 
RECENTLY GRANTED HCMC MORE DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY IN 
MATTERS DEALING WITH ITS OWN ECONOMY.  THE HCMC 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DRAFT 
DECREE THAT WOULD GIVE THE CITY MORE INDEPENDENCE IN 
PREPARING ITS OWN BUDGET. 
 
3. MS. NHAN SAID THE CITY\'S GREATEST CHALLENGE IS TO 
IMPROVE ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF 
ITS BURGEONING POPULATION.  AS A MANUFACTURING AND 
COMMERCIAL CENTER, THE CITY DRAWS ECONOMIC MIGRANTS 
FROM THE RURAL COUNTRYSIDE.  NEWCOMERS TO THE CITY 
NOTICE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AS ONE OBVIOUS RESULT OF 
OVERCROWDING.  THE LARGE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS, HOWEVER, 
ALSO CREATES A DEMAND FOR EMPLOYMENT, HOUSING, POWER, 
WATER SUPPLY, EDUCATION, AND HEALTHCARE THAT THE CITY 
IS STRUGGLING TO MEET. 
 
4. MS. NHAN POINTED OUT THAT HCMC\'S SUCCESSFUL CANAL 
CLEAN-UP PROJECT ADDRESSED BOTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND 
HOUSING PROBLEMS.  OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, HCMC HAS 
DREDGED, CLEANED, AND BEAUTIFIED THE THI NGHE-NHIEU LOC 
CANAL AND RELOCATED 6,000 HOUSEHOLDS FROM \"SHABBY 
HOUSES AND SLUMS\" BUILT OUT OVER THE CANAL TO MORE 
SUITABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT SITES.  OVER THE NEXT 5 TO 
10 YEARS, THE CITY PLANS TO CLEAN UP ITS OTHER CANALS 
AND RELOCATE 10,000 MORE HOUSEHOLDS FROM CANAL SLUMS TO 
BETTER HOUSING.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  01042  01 OF 02  060053Z 
 
5. ACG WHITE NOTED THE VISITS TO HCMC IN THE PREVIOUS 
THREE WEEKS OF AMERICAN DELEGATIONS INTERESTED IN MASS 
TRANSIT, AGRICULTURE, AND AIR QUALITY.  SHE SUGGESTED 
THAT THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD HELP ARRANGE FOR 
EXPERTS OR STUDY GROUPS ON ONE OR MORE TOPICS RELATED 
TO URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT 
THE USG WAS PREPARED TO HELP WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 
IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT. 
 
6. MS. NHAN WELCOMED US DELEGATIONS THAT COULD BRING 
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ON ADDRESSING URBAN DEVELOPMENT 
ISSUES.  SHE SAID THE CITY ALSO WELCOMED TRADE MISSIONS 
AND BUSINESS DELEGATIONS.  ACG ADDED THAT THE 
INCREASING NUMBER OF VISITING US DELEGATIONS, WHETHER 
GOVERNMENT OR PRIVATE, WOULD CONSTITUTE A POOL OF US 
INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS WHO SUPPORT HCMC\'S, AND 
VIETNAM\'S, EFFORTS TO DEVELOP. 
 
BIO-INFORMATION

REF: HANOI 2307 
 
1. A SMALL GROUP OF PEACEFUL STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS 
(APPROXIMATELY 35 TO 50 PERSONS) ARRIVED IN FRONT OF 
CONGEN AT 7:40 A.M. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, TO PROTEST 
RECENT CONGRESSIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION TARGETED 
AT VIETNAM.  THE GROUP CARRIED SEVERAL BANNERS WITH 
SLOGANS SUCH AS \"LONG LIVE THE VIETNAM COMMUNIST PARTY\" 
AND \"US GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE 
IN VIETNAM.\"  RSO WAS ALREADY PRESENT AT CONGEN, AND 
LOCAL UNDERCOVER POLICE WERE NEARBY.  THE DEMONSTRATORS 
DISBURSED AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES.  THEY DID NOT ATTEMPT 
TO SPEAK WITH ANYONE OR PASS ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTS TO 
CONGEN. 
 
2. THE PROTEST OCCURRED JUST PRIOR TO A MEETING OF 
SEVERAL HUNDRED YOUNG PEOPLE CALLED TOGETHER BY THE 
HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY YOUTH UNION, THE HCMC COMMUNIST 
YOUTH BRIGADE, AND THE HCMC STUDENTS\' ASSOCIATION TO 
DENOUNCE THE PASSAGE BY THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES ON SEPTEMBER 6 OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACT.  THE DEMONSTRATORS WERE LIKELY ON THEIR WAY

SEVERAL DAYS TO DENOUNCE THE ACT. 
 
3. VIETNAMESE VERNACULAR MEDIA IN THE CITY ALSO HAS 
BEEN CARRYING DAILY EDITORIALS CONDEMNING THE ACT AND 
DENOUNCING AMERICAN INTERFERENCE IN VIETNAM\'S INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS.  THE CAMPAIGN APPARENTLY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL 
IN STIRRING UP SOME ANTI-AMERICAN FEELING.  THE 
DEUTSCHE PRESSE-AGENTUR ON SEPTEMBER 13 PUBLISHED AN 
ARTICLE STATING THAT MANY VIETNAMESE WERE PLEASED WITH 
THE RECENT TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE U.S. QUOTING ONE 
STUDENT AS SAYING THE ATTACKS SHOULD OPEN THE U.S.\'S 
EYES TO THE RESULTS OF \"INTERVENING IN THE INTERNAL 
AFFAIRS OF OTHER NATIONS.\"  WHILE POST HAS NOT HEARD 
SUCH SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED, THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC 
EXPRESSIONS OF SYMPATHY AND CONDOLENCES FROM THE 
VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY IN HCMC HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT LIMITED.

UNANNOUNCED CALL AT THE RESIDENCE OF MR. TRAN VAN KHUE, 
THE CO-DRAFTER OF A REQUEST TO THE VIETNAMESE 
GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A \"PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION\" TO 
HELP FIGHT CORRUPTION.  KHUE AND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS 
IN HANOI INVOLVED WITH THIS REQUEST WERE RECENTLY 
SUBJECT TO QUESTIONING AND HARASSMENT BY THE POLICE 
(REFTEL).  KHUE HAS NOT BEEN ARRESTED, BUT HAS BEEN 
SUBJECT TO TWICE-DAILY INTERROGATION SESSIONS BY LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES SINCE HIS EXPULSION FROM HANOI ON 5 
SEPTEMBER.  KHUE\'S PHONE LINE HAS BEEN CUT AND HIS 
COMPUTER CONFISCATED.  HE STATED THAT THE POLICE MAY 
CHARGE HIM WITH ATTEMPTING TO CREATE AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
ASSOCIATION.  THE CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE WITHOUT 
INTERFERENCE OR PARTICIPATION BY POLICE, AND ENDED 
AFTER ONE HOUR WHEN KHUE WAS SUMMONED FOR HIS AFTERNOON 
QUESTIONING SESSION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) KHUE TOLD CONGENOFF HE HAD TRAVELED TO HANOI 
FROM HIS HOME IN HCMC ON 22 JULY TO MEET WITH SEVERAL 
OTHER ACTIVISTS WHO REPORTEDLY WERE QUESTIONED BY 
POLICE IN HANOI ON SEPTEMBER 5 IN RELATION TO THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01083  01 OF 02  200353Z 
REQUEST TO FORM A \"PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION.\"  (PRESS 
ACCOUNTS REPORTED THAT POLICE BROUGHT IN AS MANY AS 15 
PERSONS FOR QUESTIONING REGARDING KHUE\'S LETTER).  KHUE 
IS THE ONLY SOUTHERNER AMONG THEM, ALTHOUGH HE CLAIMS 
THAT \"MANY PEOPLE\" AT THE SOCIAL SCIENCE INSTITUTE IN 
HCMC WHERE HE FORMERLY WORKED SUPPORT THEIR CAUSE. 
WHEN ASKED ABOUT HOW HE HAD COME TO KNOW THE 
INDIVIDUALS IN HANOI, KHUE WAS VAGUE.  HE STATED THAT 
THEY HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME: \"THEY VISIT 
ME, I VISIT THEM.\"  HE WOULD NOT ELABORATE ON THE 
NUMBER OF PERSONS HE HAD MET WITH IN HANOI GROUP OR 
NAME ANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE SOUTH ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE REQUEST. 
 
3. (SBU)  AS REPORTED IN REFTEL, WHILE IN HANOI, KHUE 
AND PHAM QUE DUONG WROTE A REQUEST DATED SEPTEMBER 2 TO 
THE PRIME MINISTER, PARTY SECRETARY, AND PRESIDENT FOR 
PERMISSION TO ESTABLISH A \"PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION\" 
AGAINST CORRUPTION.  KHUE ALSO WROTE A FLIER FOR PUBLIC 
DISTRIBUTION DESCRIBING THE PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION AND 
RECRUITING MEMBERS.  THE FLIER WAS DISTRIBUTED ON 
NATIONAL DAY, 2 SEPTEMBER, IN HANOI AND THE NORTHERN 
PROVINCES, HE SAID, SPECIFICALLY MENTIONING THAI BINH 
AND HAI DUONG PROVINCES.  (NOTE: THAI BINH PROVINCE WAS 
THE SITE OF SIGNIFICANT DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION IN 1997, AND REMAINS A TINDERBOX 
OF SORTS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.  END NOTE.)  IT IS 
NOT CLEAR HOW MANY OF THE FLIERS WERE DISTRIBUTED OR 
THE EXTENT OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION.  ACCORDING TO KHUE, 
DUONG ALSO POSTED THE REQUEST LETTER ON THE INTERNET AT 
WWW.THONGLUAN.COM.  (CONGENOFFS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01083  01 OF 02  200353Z 
ACCESS THIS SITE.  APPARENTLY THE GOVERNMENT HAS 
ALREADY BLOCKED IT WITH A FIREWALL.)  KHUE SAID THAT ON 
5 SEPTEMBER, THREE POLICE OFFICERS ESCORTED HIM TO THE 
AIRPORT IN HANOI AND PUT HIM ON A PLANE BACK TO HCMC. 
 
4. (SBU)  ACCORDING TO KHUE, WHEN HE ARRIVED BACK IN 
HCMC, THE LOCAL POLICE SEARCHED HIS HOME AND 
CONFISCATED HIS COMPUTER AND THE FLIERS HE HAD BROUGHT 
BACK WITH HIM.  EVERY DAY SINCE 6 SEPTEMBER, THE POLICE 
HAVE COLLECTED HIM AT 8 A.M. AND QUESTIONED HIM UNTIL 
11 A.M., AND AGAIN FROM 3-5 P.M.  THE QUESTIONS FOCUS 
ON HIS PERSONAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THE PURPOSE OF THE 
PEOPLE\'S ASSOCIATION HE IS ADVOCATING.  KHUE HAS NOT 
HEARD DIRECTLY FROM HIS COMPATRIOTS IN THE NORTH AS HIS 
PHONE LINE HAS BEEN CUT, AND DOES NOT KNOW THEIR 
WHEREABOUTS, OR THOSE OF THE UNNAMED INDIVIDUALS WHO 
DISTRIBUTED THE FLIERS IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES.  KHUE 
MENTIONED HEARING AN RFI RADIO BROADCAST ON 10 
SEPTEMBER WHICH REPORTED ON THE INVESTIGATIONS OF HIS 
COMPATRIOTS AND INCLUDED AN INTERVIEW WITH ONE OF \"THE 
FOUNDERS\" OF THE ASSOCIATION, NGUYEN THANH GIANG.  HE 
ADDED THAT HE HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM \"PROVINCES, 
CITIES AND OVERSEAS\" IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSOCIATION. 
 
 
5. (SBU) CONGENOFF ASKED KHUE WHY THE GOVERNMENT WAS SO 
SUSPICIOUS OF HIM AND HIS PROPOSED ASSOCIATION.  KHUE 
RESPONDED IRONICALLY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WANTS \"TO KEEP 
A MONOPOLY ON FIGHTING CORRUPTION.\"  AND ACCORDING TO 
KHUE, WHILE THE VIETNAMESE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT ANY 
INDIVIDUAL MAY CREATE A REGISTERED ASSOCIATION, THE 
REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT.  KHUE AND DUONG ALSO 
ADVOCATED FOR AN INDEPENDENT \"ANTI-CORRUPTION 
NEWSPAPER\" IN THEIR REQUEST. 
 
6. (SBU) KHUE MAINTAINS THAT HE HAS BEEN WRONGLY 
ACCUSED AND THAT HIS EXPULSION FROM HANOI AND 
INVESTIGATION BY THE POLICE \"VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION.\" 
HE CLAIMS THAT THE POLICE ARE SEEKING TO CHARGE HIM 
WITH WHAT AMOUNTS TO TREASON: THE FOUNDING OF AN ANTI- 
GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION.  HE STATES FURTHER THAT IF HE 
AND THE OTHERS ARE BROUGHT TO TRIAL, THEY WILL \"SUE THE 
MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY.\"   BUT KHUE ADDED THAT HE 
BELIEVES THAT IN THE END AUTHORITIES WILL NOT BRING HIM 
AND THE OTHERS TO TRIAL BECAUSE, HE SAID, \"WE WILL MAKE 
OUR CASE BEFORE THE PEOPLE.\" 
 
7. (SBU) THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN THE BACK OF AN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

ADVERTISING AGENCY RUN BY HIS NEPHEW ON A BUSY 
COMMERCIAL STREET IN HCMC\'S DISTRICT FIVE.  DURING THE 
MEETING HIS SON CAME INTO THE BACK ROOM AND ASKED HIS 
FATHER IF IT WAS SAFE FOR HIM TO BE TALKING TO US. 
KHUE ASSURED HIM IT WAS.  THE MEETING ENDED AFTER ONE 
HOUR WITH THE ARRIVAL OF A LOCAL UNIFORMED POLICE 
OFFICER WHO SMILED AND SHOOK KHUE\'S HAND.  BEHIND THE 
OFFICER WERE TWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES.  KHUE INFORMED 
CONGENOFF THAT HE WOULD NOW BE RETURNING TO THE POLICE 
STATION FOR QUESTIONING. 
 
BIONOTE

8. (SBU) KHUE WAS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN TO CONGEN.  HE 
WORKED AT THE SOCIAL SCIENCES INSTITUTE IN HCMC AS A 
RESEARCHER UNTIL HE RETIRED IN 1996.  DURING THE

SUBJECT: CG\'S INITIAL MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN OF HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY.  ON OCTOBER 15, CG EMI YAMAUCHI MET WITH 
LE THANH HAI, CHAIRMAN OF THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE (PC) 
OF HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC), ACCOMPANIED BY POLOFF AND 
CONOFF.  HAI EXTENDED A WARM WELCOME TO THE CG AND 
EXPRESSED HIS HOPE THAT SHE WOULD BE BOTH COMFORTABLE 
AND BUSY IN HCMC.  HE SAID THE BTA WILL RESULT IN 
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES PREPARING THEIR GOODS FOR EXPORT, 
AND INTEGRATING WITH U.S. AND GLOBAL MARKETS.  HE SAID 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z 
HE WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
(FDI) IN VIETNAM, AND HOPED THAT THE OVERSEAS PRIVATE 
INVESTMENT CORPORATION (OPIC) WILL HELP TO ATTRACT 
POTENTIAL INVESTORS TO HCMC.  HE WAS HOPEFUL THAT THE 
USG AND OTHER COUNTRIES COULD ARRIVE AT A PEACEFUL 
SETTLEMENT IN AFGHANISTAN.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
------- 
\"I HOPE YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY BUSY DURING YOUR TENURE, 
BECAUSE THAT WILL BE A GOOD SIGN.\" 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
------- 
 
2. HAI WELCOMED CG TO HCMC, AND STATED OVER THE NEXT 
THREE YEARS HE HOPED TO CONTINUE TO BROADEN THE GOOD 
WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED WITH CG\'S 
PREDECESSOR.  CG EXPRESSED HER DESIRE TO CONTINUE AND 
STRENGTHEN THEIR RELATIONSHIP ON ALL FRONTS, NOT ONLY 
THOSE RELATED TO TRADE.  SHE OFFERED TO ASSIST HAI WITH 
EMERGING PROGRAMS OR INITIATIVES, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN 
THE AREAS OF CULTURE AND EDUCATION.  HE AGREED THESE 
WERE IMPORTANT AREAS TO SEEK COOPERATION, AS WELL AS 
THE FIELD OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
\"WE WANT TO INTEGRATE INTO THE U.S. AND GLOBAL MARKETS 
 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\" 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
3.  LE STATED THE APPROVAL OF THE U.S.-VIETNAM 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z 
BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT BY THE U.S. SENATE 
DEMONSTRATES GREAT GROWTH AND POTENTIAL FOR THE U.S.- 
VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  HE NOW SEES CHALLENGES FOR 
VIETNAMESE ENTREPRENEURS, WHO NEED TO PREPARE THEIR 
PRODUCTS FOR EXPORT, AND FOREIGN ENTREPRENEURS, WHO 
NEED TO TRUST IN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM. 
 
4.  PRIOR TO RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
ORGANIZED A DIALOGUE AMONG VIETNAMESE COMPANIES TO 
EXCHANGE IDEAS ABOUT INTEGRATING INTO U.S. MARKETS. 
ACCORDING TO HAI, ONE ISSUE THAT SURFACED IS THAT MANY 
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES MUST IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THEIR 
PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL 
EXPORT MARKETS.  HAI SAID THE HCMC TARGET FOR EXPORT 
GROWTH FOR 2001 WAS 20 PERCENT; ALTHOUGH IN THE FIRST 
SIX MONTHS IT REACHED 14 PERCENT, HAI SAID IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN THE BALANCE OF 6 PERCENT IN THE 
CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. 
 
5.  HAI SAID THE PC INTENDS TO INCREASE ITS SUPPORT FOR 
AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN VIETNAM EFFORTS TO 
EDUCATE U.S. COMPANIES ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADE 
WITH VIETNAM.  HE SAID AMERICAN INVESTMENT WOULD SPUR 
GROWTH IN HCMC, AND HE SAID HE PLANNED TO MAKE HCMC A 
MORE ATTRACTIVE DESTINATION FOR FDI.  HE WOULD LIKE 
OPIC TO PLAY A GREATER ROLE IN FACILITATING INVESTMENT 
IN VIETNAM.  DURING THE FIRST 9 MONTHS OF 2001, HCMC 
ATTRACTED A TOTAL OF USD$700 MILLION IN FDI.  THIS WAS 
THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN INVESTMENT OVER THE SAME PERIOD 
LAST YEAR, BUT STILL FALLS SHORT OF TARGETS.  HAI SAID 
HE PARTICULARLY WOULD LIKE TO DEVELOP FDI IN THE FIELD 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01181  01 OF 02  170608Z 
OF HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES IN HCMC, WHICH HAS THE LARGEST 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKET IN VIETNAM. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
\"HO CHI MINH CITY IS VIETNAM\'S GATEWAY TO THE WORLD. 
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD ECONOMY WILL AFFECT VIETNAM, 
BUT IT WILL AFFECT US FIRST.\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
6.  CG TOLD HAI THAT WHILE THE PC HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS 
FOR GROWTH IN HCMC FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF THE BTA, SHE 
WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TEMPER ENTHUSIASM WITH 
REALISM.  LE RESPONDED THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 
ALSO ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HCMC\'S GROWTH RATE, 
BECAUSE A ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN GDP IN HCMC 
TRANSLATES TO GROWTH OF 0.3 PERCENT IN GDP FOR THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY.  HCMC PROVIDES THE GREATEST SHARE OF 
THE GDP IN VIETNAM, AND WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED 
BY THE ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS FROM 1997-1999.  ALTHOUGH 
THE CITY\'S ECONOMY PICKED UP AGAIN IN 2000, HAI SAID HE 
ANTICIPATES A SLOWDOWN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001 
DUE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE. 
 
7.  HAI SAID THAT HCMC\'S SERVICES SECTOR OCCUPIES THE 
LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL HCMC ECONOMY AND IS 
VULNERABLE.  WHILE THE PC\'S AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT 
INCLUDES IMPROVEMENTS IN TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE, 
INCLUDING SEA AND AIRPORTS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, 
BANKING, AND FINANCE, HAI SAID HE ALSO WILL PAY MORE 
ATTENTION TO THE SERVICES SECTOR AND PREPARE SERVICE- 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01181  02 OF 02  170609Z 
ORIENTED COMPANIES FOR EXPORT. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
\"I BELIEVE THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE SETTLED IN PEACE AND 
COOPERATION, IN LINE WITH THE UN CHARTER, AND THINGS 
WILL SOON BE BACK TO NORMAL.\" 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
8.  CG ASKED HAI IF HE THOUGHT THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS 
ON THE U.S. HAD AFFECTED THE SERVICES SECTOR IN 
VIETNAM, AS IT HAD IN THE U.S.  LE WOULD NOT ATTRIBUTE 
THE CURRENT SLOWDOWN TO EXTERNAL EVENTS OTHER THAN THE 
GENERAL GLOBAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE OF LATE. 
 
9.  HAI ALSO EXPRESSED HIS PERSONAL CONCERN OVER THE 
USG\'S RESORTING TO MILITARY ACTION TO RESOLVE ITS 
CURRENT ISSUES WITH THE TALIBAN.  HE HOPED THAT SOMEHOW 
A PEACEFUL RESOLUTION COULD BE FOUND, AND NOTED THAT 
THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE \"HAVE RECENTLY KNOWN THE MISERY 
OF WAR TOO WELL.\"  CG REMINDED HIM OF THE USG POSITION 
TO COMBAT ALL TERRORISTS, AND THAT LARGE NATIONS GRIEVE 
FOR THEIR LOSSES AS WELL.  AT THIS HAI EMPHATICALLY 
AGREED.  CG INFORMED HIM OF A PRESS REPORT CONCERNING 
THE RECENT ARREST IN THE U.S. OF VO VAN DUC FOR HIS 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOMBING OF THE VIETNAMESE EMBASSY IN 
BANGKOK IN JUNE.  HAI SAID THAT HE SHARES THE USG\'S 
COMMITMENT TO STOP TERRORISM IN ANY FORM. 
 
10.  HAI CLOSED THE 45-MINUTE MEETING BY TELLING CG 
THAT THE CONSULATE STAFF WAS LIVING IN THE BEST CITY IN 
VIETNAM AND THAT THEIR SECURITY WAS ASSURED.  HE NOTED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01181  02 OF 02  170609Z 
THAT WHATEVER VIETNAM MAY LACK IN GOOD GOVERNANCE AND 
SOPHISTICATION, IT MAKES UP IN SECURITY. 
 
10.  COMMENT.  HAI ASSUMED THE POST OF PC CHAIRMAN ONLY 
THIS PAST MAY.  ALTHOUGH THAT MAKES HIM \"MAYOR\" OF 
HCMC, HIS POSITION IS MORE AKIN TO THAT OF GOVERNOR OF 
AN IMPORTANT PROVINCE, BECAUSE THE HCMC PC REPORTS 
DIRECTLY TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT.  HIS POSITION 
WIELDS EVEN GREATER INFLUENCE NOW THAT THE HCMC PC HAS 
BEEN GIVEN MORE AUTONOMY TO GENERATE ITS OWN BUDGET. 
CG LOOKS FORWARD TO FUTURE MEETINGS WITH HAI AS HE 
PRESIDES OVER HCMC - VIETNAM\'S ENGINE OF GROWTH.  END 
COMMENT.

1. SUMMARY: IN A MEETING WITH EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR JUDITH 
STROTZ, FORMER SAIGON COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY TRAN 
BACH DANG EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM.  HE ALSO EXPRESSED HIS EXTREME DISAPPROVAL 
OF THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT (PENDING BEFORE THE 
SENATE) BECAUSE, HE SAID, IT SINGLES OUT VIETNAM 
UNFAIRLY FROM AMONG OTHER COUNTRIES.  THE CONVERSATION 
WITH DANG, A SENIOR VIETNAMESE STATESMAN, REFLECTED THE 
COMPLEXITIES AND LINGERING AMBIVALENCE IN THE U.S.- 
VIETNAM RELATIONSHIP.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ADVICE FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE SAIGON TET OFFENSIVE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. MEETING WITH EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ ON OCTOBER 8 
AT HIS RESIDENCE, DANG SAID HE WAS \"SHOCKED\" AT THE 
ATTACK ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.  HE SAID THE KILLING 
OF CIVILIANS WAS SIMPLY \"UNACCEPTABLE.\"  THE 75-YEAR- 
OLD DANG, WHO WAS COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY FROM 1965- 
73, TOLD STROTZ THAT IN 1968, HE WAS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF 
OF THE TET OFFENSIVE IN SAIGON AND CHOLON. \"WE ATTACKED 
THE U.S. EMBASSY IN SAIGON, BUT WE NEVER CONSIDERED 
THAT TO BE A TERRORIST ACT.\"  DANG SAID HE SUPPORTED 
THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM AND ALSO WOULD SUPPORT 
THE OVERTHROW OF THE TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN. 
 
3. DANG RECALLED THAT WHEN THE VIET MINH WAS 
CONSOLIDATING ITS POWER IN THE 1950\'S, IT FOUGHT 
SEVERAL BATTLES AGAINST THE HOA HAO BUDDHIST MILITIA IN 
SOUTHERN VIETNAM.  \"WE HAD GUNS,\" HE SAID.  \"THE HOA 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01183  01 OF 02  170847Z 
HAO HAD ONLY KNIVES AND STICKS.\"  AFTER KILLING THE 
FIRST WAVES OF HOA HAO FORCES, HE SAID, THE VIET MINH 
REGROUPED, NOT BECAUSE OF LOSSES, BUT BECAUSE \"WE FELT 
WE COULDN\'T KILL PEOPLE THAT WAY.\"  DANG SUGGESTED THAT 
IF U.S. GROUND FORCES LANDED IN AFGHANISTAN, THEY COULD 
FACE A SIMILAR COMPLEX SITUATION.  HE SAID THE U.S. 
SHOULD RELY ON THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE OR ANOTHER AFGHAN 
GROUP TO OVERTHROW THE TALIBAN.  IN A STATEMENT THAT 
SEEMED IRONIC COMING FROM THE VIET CONG VETERAN, DANG 
ECHOED VIETNAM, THE OLD COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF SAID THAT 
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE AFGHAN PEOPLE, IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR THE U.S. TO PREVAIL. 
 
4. NOTING THAT HE WAS MADE AN HONORARY CITIZEN OF 
LUBBOCK, TEXAS AND AN HONORARY MEMBER OF THE U.S. 
ROTARY CLUB DURING HIS FIRST VISIT TO THE U.S. IN 1999, 
DANGHE SAID HE HAS MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS.  HE SAID HE 
REGRETTED THE POSSIBLE LOSS OF U.S. LIVES AND ADVISED 
THAT MILITARY ACTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN BE SWIFT BECAUSE 
U.S. SOLDIERS WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME IN THE AFGHAN 
WINTER.  DANG SAID HE OPPOSES TERRORISM IN ANY FORM, 
INCLUDING ACTS OF TERRORISM BY PALESTINIAN GROUPS OR 
PERSONS.  HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT HE BELIEVED U.S. 
POLICIES TOWARD ISRAEL VIS--VIS THE PALESTINIANS WERE 
\"DANGEROUS.\"  HE SAID HE THOUGHT THE U.S. SHOULD USE 
ITS POWER TO \"RESTRAIN ISRAEL.\" 
 
5. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ THANKED DANG FOR HIS 
INSIGHTS AND SUPPORT.  SHE ADDED THAT THE U.S. DOES NOT 
WISH TO SEE AFGHAN CIVILIANS KILLED OR INJURED AND THAT 
THE U.S. HAS LAUNCHED A LARGE HUMANITARIAN EFFORT TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01183  01 OF 02  170847Z 
ASSIST THE AFGHAN PEOPLE.  SHE SAID THE U.S. WAS 
LEADING DIPLOMATIC AND FINANCIAL EFFORTS, NOT JUST 
MILITARY EFFORTS, TO FIGHT TERRORISM. 
 
\"SHUT THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT UP IN A DRAWER\" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
6. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ ASKED DANG TO EXPLAIN THE 
STRONG REACTION IN VIETNAM AGAINST THE VIETNAM HUMAN 
RIGHTS ACT (VNHRA) CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE. 
IN AN OFTEN EMOTIONAL VOICE,  THAT AT TIMES SHOWED 
EMOTION, DANG SAID THE ACT WENT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL 
NORMS AND BEHAVIOR.  \"BY ITS VERY NAME, IT SINGLES OUT 
VIETNAM,\" HE SAID.  HE ADMITTED VIETNAM WAS \"NOT 
PERFECT\" IN TERMS OF HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT NOTED THAT ITS 
HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD WAS NOT POOR IN COMPARISON TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES SUCH AS AFGHANISTAN. 
 
7. ACCORDING TO DANG, VIETNAM FOUGHT UNTIL 1975 TO 
OBTAIN THE MOST BASIC OF HUMAN RIGHTS - INDEPENDENCE. 
HE SAID ANOTHER BASIC HUMAN RIGHT WAS HAVING ENOUGH TO 
EAT.  IN 1944-45, TWO MILLION VIETNAMESE DIED OF 
STARVATION UNDER JAPANESE OCCUPATION.  IN COMPARISON, 
HE SAID, TODAY\'S HUMAN RIGHTS PROBLEMS ARE LAUGHABLE. 
VIETNAM\'S LEADERS ARE ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE ITS 
CITIZENS\' HUMAN RIGHTS, DANG SAID, BUT IMPROVEMENTS 
CANNOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. 
 
8. EAP/BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ DETAILED SOME OF THE 
BACKGROUND OF THE VNHRA.  SHE EXPLAINED THAT SOME 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WANTED TO BALANCE THEIR PASSAGE OF 
THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF 
THEIR CONCERN ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS IN VIETNAM.  SHE ALSO 
NOTED THAT THE ACT CONTAINED A PRESIDENTIAL WAIVER TO 
SOME OF ITS MAIN PROVISIONS. 
 
9. DANG WAS NOT IMPRESSED.  HE SAID VIETNAM\'S IS \"NOT A 
BARBARIC GOVERNMENT,\" AGAIN POINTING TO THE TALEBAN, 
BUT THE VNHRA ESTABLISHES THE UNITED STATES AS 
VIETNAM\'S JUDGE IN ITS OWN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.  HE NOTED 
THAT IN THE PAST, POL POT CAUSED \"TERRIBLE 
DESTRUCTION,\" BUT THE U.S. PROTESTED KHMER ROUGE 
ACTIVITIES BELATEDLY.  \"BUT WE SHOULD PUT THE PAST 
BEHIND US,\" HE SAID.  \"I SUGGEST THE VNHRA BE SHUT UP 
IN A DRAWER.  INSTEAD, WE SHOULD GIVE EACH OTHER ADVICE 
AS FRIENDS.\"  HE ADDED THAT VIETNAM WAS WILLING TO 
CONTINUE ITS DISCUSSION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AS PART OF THE 
NORMAL DIPLOMATIC PROCESS.

10. AS A FORMER COMMUNIST PARTY LEADER AND CURRENT 
ADVISOR TO THE GOVERNMENT, DANG\'S OPINIONS - GENUINE 
SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. FIGHT AGAINST 
TERRORISM CHECKED BY INDIGNATION TOWARDS THE VNHRA - 
LIKELY REFLECT THOSE OF MANY OTHER OLDER GENERATION 
VIETNAMESE LEADERS. 
 
11.  BCLTV DIRECTOR STROTZ DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

1. LOCAL MEDIA REPORTED THAT FATHER NGUYEN VAN LY, 
CATHOLIC PRIEST ARRESTED MAY 17, STOOD TRIAL ON OCTOBER 
19 IN THUA THIEN HUE PROVINCE.  THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S 
COURT HANDED DOWN A SENTENCE OF 15 YEARS IMPRISONMENT 
TO FATHER LY - TWO YEARS FOR DISOBEYING THE 
\"ADMINISTRATIVE PROBATION\" (HOUSE ARREST) ORDERS HE WAS 
PLACED UNDER IN FEBRUARY, AND 13 YEARS FOR DAMAGING THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S \"UNITY POLICY.\"  IN ADDITION, THE COURT 
ORDERED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBATION, WHICH WILL CONFINE LY 
TO HIS PLACE OF RESIDENCE FOR 5 YEARS AFTER HE IS 
RELEASED FROM PRISON.  BOTH PROVINCIAL AND NATIONAL 
TELEVISION (VTV1) BROADCAST THE SENTENCING ON THE 
EVENING NEWS. 
 
2. FATHER LY HAS ALREADY SPENT 10 YEARS IN PRISON (FROM 
1981 TO 1991) FOR ANTI-REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES.  IN 
NOVEMBER 2000, HE CIRCULATED A LETTER CHARGING THE 
GOVERNMENT WITH ABUSE OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  IN 
FEBRUARY 2001, HE MET WITH DISSIDENT HOA HAO AND 
BUDDHIST LEADERS IN HUE TO ORGANIZE A \"COUNCIL FOR 
INTER-RELIGIOUS UNITY\" OUTSIDE OF GVN AUTHORITY.  ONE 
WEEK LATER, HE SUBMITTED WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT WAS 
HIGHLY CRITICAL OF THE GVN TO THE U.S. COMMISSION ON 
INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.  ON FEBRUARY 14, THE 
PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OF THUA THIEN HUE 
PROVINCE PUT HIM UNDER A HOUSE ARREST ORDER.  FATHER

SEVERAL WITNESSES, APPROXIMATELY 300 POLICEMEN CAME TO 
THE CHURCH COMPOUND TO FORCIBLY DISBURSE A CROWD OF 300

4. ON OCTOBER 22, IN A MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
OF THE AMERICAS DEPARTMENT OF THE MFA ON ANOTHER 
SUBJECT, EMBASSY POL/C RAISED FATHER LY\'S SENTENCE, 
NOTED THE ADDITIONAL CONCERN THIS WOULD CREATE IN 
WASHINGTON, AND OBSERVED THAT THE VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS 
ACT WAS STILL PENDING BEFORE THE SENATE.  THE DEPUTY 
DIRECTOR MERELY REPEATED THE USUAL LINE THAT THE CASE 
WAS ABOUT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND NOT ABOUT RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM.  CONGEN POLOFF WAS UNABLE TO REACH EITHER THE 
ARCHBISHOP OF HUE OR THE ARCHBISHOP OF HCMC FOR 
COMMENT.  (THE ARCHBISHOP OF HCMC IS CURRENTLY 
TRAVELING IN ROME.)  A CATHOLIC PRIEST IN HUE AND TWO

                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z 
1.  IN AN OCTOBER 26 MEETING, VIETRADE HCMC DIRECTOR 
CITES DAMAGE FROM THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 TO 
VIETNAM\'S EXPORTS, NOTING THAT EXPORT GROWTH IS 
ESTIMATED AT 7% THIS YEAR, A DRAMATIC FALL FROM LAST 
YEAR\'S 30% INCREASE.  ALTHOUGH LAUDING PASSAGE OF THE 
BTA, HE STATED THAT VIETNAMESE COMPANIES NEED MUCH MORE 
INFORMATION IF THEY WERE TO EXPAND INTO THE U.S. 
MARKET.  END SUMMARY 
 
EXPORTS HURT BY OSAMA BIN LADEN 
------------------------------- 
2.  IN A MEETING WITH DPO AND ECONOFF, MR. VO TA LUONG, 
THE DIRECTOR OF THE VIETNAM TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY FOR 
SOUTHERN VIETNAM, STATED THAT THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 
11 HAD AN INDIRECT BUT DAMAGING IMPACT ON VIETNAM\'S 
EXPORTS.  HE STATED THAT ALTHOUGH VIETNAM EXPORTED 
RELATIVELY LITTLE TO THE U.S., SHIPMENTS TO OTHER MAJOR 
MARKETS HAD BEEN AFFECTED.  HE NOTED THAT NATIONAL 
EXPORT GROWTH, WHICH HAD BEEN TARGETED AT 16% FOR THE 
YEAR, HAD, UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, BEEN ESTIMATED AT 
10%.  NOW IT IS EXPECTED TO BE A MERE 7%.  THIS 
COMPARES TO LAST YEAR\'S GROWTH RATE OF 30%.  ALTHOUGH 
SOME OF THIS DROP CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL 
SLOWDOWN IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, HE STATED THAT THE 
EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, AND INCREASED SECURITY WORRIES 
WORLDWIDE, HAD CLEARLY MADE LIFE MORE DIFFICULT FOR 
VIETNAMESE EXPORTERS IN THE SOUTH. 
 
3.  MR. LUONG\'S VIEW CORRESPONDS TO COMMENTS FROM OTHER 
OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE IN HCMC WHO NOTE THAT THE 
NUMBER OF TRAVELERS, TRADE MISSIONS, AND NEW BUSINESS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z 
INITIATIVES IN THE HCMC AREA HAVE FALLEN NOTICEABLY 
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS.  ALTHOUGH VIETNAM IS CURRENTLY 
TRUMPETING ITS RATING FROM THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC 
RISK CONSULTANCY AS THE SAFEST PLACE TO DO BUSINESS IN 
ASIA (BASED ON A SURVEY CONDUCTED IN THE WAKE OF THE 
TERRORIST ACTS), THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 HAVE 
CLEARLY HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT HERE, AND LOCAL OFFICIALS 
AND BUSINESS PEOPLE KNOW IT. 
 
VIETRADE PROMOTES EXPORT AND INVESTMENT 
--------------------------------------- 
4.   THE VIETNAM TRADE PROMOTION AGENCY (VIETRADE) IS 
ONLY ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OLD. THE HO CHI MINH CITY 
OFFICE HAS A STAFF OF 10 PEOPLE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
MOST OF THE SOUTHERN REGION OF VIETNAM.  PART OF THE 
MINISTRY OF TRADE, IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STATE 
MANAGEMENT, COORDINATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE 
AND TRADE-RELATED INVESTMENT PROMOTION ACTIVITIES IN 
VIETNAM.  VIETRADE ORGANIZES SEMINARS, TRADE MISSIONS, 
AND ALL ASPECTS OF TRADE PROMOTION.  UNLIKE BUSINESS 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT FINANCE THROUGH FEE-BASED SERVICES 
OR MEMBERSHIP DUES, VIETRADE IS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL 
BUDGET AND CAN DRAW UPON ITS BUDGET TO COVER THE COSTS 
OF SOME OF ITS EVENTS OR SUBSIDIZE PARTICIPATION OF 
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES. 
 
5. ITS WORK IS SIMILAR TO THE MYRIAD OF OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SET UP IN VIETNAM TO PROMOTE 
TRADE AND INVESTMENT FOR A PARTICULAR PROVINCE, CITY, 
INDUSTRIAL OR EXPORT ZONE, OR AMONG MEMBER COMPANIES. 
IT ALSO SERVES AS A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT CHANNEL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01221  01 OF 02  290950Z 
FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS OR INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
TO WORK WITH THE GVN ON TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. 
FOR EXAMPLE, VIETRADE IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE 
UNDP AND AN AGENCY OF THE SWISS GOVERNMENT ON A THREE- 
YEAR PROJECT ON DEVELOPING EXPORT MARKETS FOR SEAFOOD 
AND FOOTWEAR.  IT HAS ALSO WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE 
ASEAN-JAPAN CENTER, WHICH IS A JAPAN-FUNDED 
ORGANIZATION TO ASSIST ASEAN NATIONS IN ENTERING THE 
JAPAN MARKET. 
 
6.  VIETRADE ALSO SERVES AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE 
WHICH GATHERS TRADE INFORMATION FROM A VARIETY OF 
SOURCES OVERSEAS AND IN VIETNAM.  LUONG NOTED TO 
CONOFFS THAT HE WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP DIRECTLY 
WITH ANY VIETNAMESE COMPANIES THAT CONOFFS ENCOUNTER 
WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT EXPORTING. 
 
HOW DO WE EXPORT TO THE U.S.? 
----------------------------- 
7.  LUONG STATED THAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE BTA THE 
VIETNAMESE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS VERY INTERESTED IN 
INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO ENTER THE U.S. 
MARKET.  HE NOTES THAT, IN PARTICULAR, SMALL COMPANIES 
DO NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE OR RESOURCES TO PARTICIPATE 
IN WHAT HE CHARACTERIZED AS \"DISTANT U.S. MARKETS.\" 
CAN THE USG HELP? 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01221  02 OF 02  290950Z 
----------------- 
8.  HE ASKED IF THE USG WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE 
ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAMESE COMPANIES SEEKING TO ENTER THE 
U.S. MARKET.  DPO ADVISED THAT WHILE THE USG IS 
PLANNING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR VIETNAM AND 
DIRECTLY ASSISTS U.S. EXPORTERS SEEKING TO DO BUSINESS 
WITH VIETNAM, THE GVN WOULD GENERALLY HAVE THE LEAD 
ROLE IN ASSISTING VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES HOPING TO 
EXPORT TO THE U.S.  AT THE SAME TIME, WE RECOGNIZE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM THE BTA 
AND A CLOSER U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE RELATIONSHIP.  IN THAT 
SPIRIT WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO SHARE 
INFORMATION, CONTACTS AND EXPERIENCE.  DPO POINTED TO 
THE PAST EXAMPLE OF CONGEN AND VIETRADE ORGANIZING A 
U.S. CUSTOMS SEMINAR WHICH INCLUDED PARTICIPATION OF 
VIETNAMESE COMPANIES. 
 
BIO NOTE 
-------- 
9.  MR. LUONG HAS WORKED FOR THE MINISTRY OF TRADE 
SINCE GRADUATING FROM UNIVERSITY IN MOSCOW IN 1980 WITH 
A DEGREE IN ENGLISH AND ECONOMICS.  HE HAS SERVED IN 
HCMC SINCE 1992 AND HAS HELD A LEADERSHIP POSITION FOR 
THE PAST THREE YEARS.  HE HAS HEADED UP THE HO CHI MINH 
CITY OFFICE OF VIETRADE SINCE IT WAS ESTABLISHED A YEAR 
AND A HALF AGO.  HE CONCURRENTLY HOLDS THE TITLE OF 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE HCMC OFFICE OF THE 
MINISTRY OF TRADE.  MR. LUONG SPEAKS CONVERSATIONAL 
ENGLISH, AND EXCELLENT RUSSIAN.  HE HAS NEVER TRAVELED 
TO THE U.S.

COMMENT 
------- 
10.  ALTHOUGH VIETRADE SEEMS FOCUSED ON MAJOR PROJECTS 
PARTNERING WITH FOREIGN FUNDERS, CONGEN WILL TRY TO 
FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO 
ENCOURAGE VIETNAMESE BUSINESS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
BTA. HIS CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT VIETNAMESE 
COMPANIES ARE READY TO COMPETE IN THE U.S. MARKET IS AN 
OFT HEARD REFRAIN HERE.

PAGE 02        HO CHI  01255  080205Z 
 
1.  SUMMARY:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES A BOOST 
IN ORDERS FROM OVERSEAS BUYERS RELUCTANT TO DO BUSINESS IN 
COUNTRIES SUCH AS PAKISTAN AND INDONESIA, IN LIGHT OF THE 
CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION.  THIS IS ACCORDING TO BUSINESS 
PEOPLE IN HO CHI MINH CITY, THE CENTER OF VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE 
INDUSTRY.  ALTHOUGH NO JUMP IN ORDERS HAS YET OCCURRED, 
INDUSTRY EXPERTS STATE THAT IF SECURITY CONCERNS REMAIN 
HEIGHTENED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, BUYERS COULD SWITCH THEIR 
ORDERS TO VIETNAM (AND OTHER COUNTRIES PERCEIVED AS STABLE 
AND SAFE).  MOST AGREE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BILATERAL TRADE 
AGREEMENT (BTA) AND THE WORLD ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, WHICH 
STARTED WELL IN ADVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11, WILL HAVE A MUCH 
STRONGER EFFECT ON THE FUTURE OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY HERE. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
THE SHIFT TO VIETNAM MAY BE COMING - OR NOT 
------------------------------------------- 
2. ALTHOUGH BUSINESS IS SLUMPING IN RESPONSE TO THE ECONOMIC 
SLOWDOWN, A NUMBER OF BUSINESS PEOPLE IN VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE 
INDUSTRY INDICATE THAT THEY ALREADY SEE ADDED INTEREST IN 
VIETNAM AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PRODUCTION FOR TEXTILES 
AND GARMENTS IN LIEU OF INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, OR OTHER MOSLEM 
COUNTRIES. ONE FACTORY OWNER HERE NOTED HE HAD BEEN 
CONTACTED BY A BUYER WHO WANTED TO DIVERSIFY PRODUCTION AWAY 
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, FEARING A LABEL FROM THAT REGION WOULD 
HURT U.S. SALES.  OTHERS HAVE TOLD US THEY HAVE RECEIVED 
INITIAL INQUIRIES, BUT NO SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS YET. 
 
3.  THE INDUSTRY REPS AND EXPERTS WE TALKED TO AGREE THAT IT 
IS TOO EARLY FOR A MAJOR SHIFT IN ORDER PATTERNS.  MORE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01255  080205Z 
NOTICEABLE IS THE OVERALL DROP IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST FEW 
MONTHS.   MANY BLAME THIS DROP - WHICH BEGAN A DOWNHILL 
SLIDE WELL IN ADVANCE OF SEPTEMBER 11 -- ON WORLDWIDE 
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  AUTUMN SHOULD BE OUR PEAK PRODUCTION 
SEASON, ONE GARMENT MAKER STATED, BUT FEW PLANTS ARE WORKING 
AT FULL CAPACITY. 
 
4.  ALL STATED, HOWEVER, THAT A SUSTAINED ARMED CONFLICT IN 
AFGHANISTAN (OR ELSEWHERE, FOR THAT MATTER) WILL CAUSE 
BUYERS TO SHIFT THEIR GARMENT ORDERS FROM COUNTRIES WHERE 
THEY FEAR TO TRAVEL OR WHERE THEY BELIEVE THERE IS NO 
GUARANTEE ORDERS WILL BE FILLED, BECAUSE OF INSTABILITY. 
FOR EXAMPLE, LE QUOC AN, THE CHAIRMAN OF VINATEX, A STATE 
OWNED TEXTILE CONGLOMERATE, STATED AT A LOCAL SEMINAR ON THE 
TEXTILE INDUSTRY THAT VIETNAM COULD AND SHOULD SELL ITS 
STABILITY AND SECURITY. 
 
5.  OF COURSE THE BIGGER IMPACT ON VIETNAM IS THE 
RATIFICATION OF THE BTA, WHICH ALLOWS TEXTILE AND GARMENT 
MAKERS TO EXPORT TO THE U.S. WITH LOWER TARIFFS AND --UNTIL 
A TEXTILE AGREEMENT IS IN FORCE --  WITHOUT QUOTAS.  VIETNAM 
CURRENTLY HAS LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF U.S. TEXTILE AND 
GARMENT IMPORT MARKET, AND LOCAL FIRMS HAVE BEEN GEARING UP 
TO CAPITALIZE ON THIS NEW OPPORTUNITY.  STATE-OWNED VINATEX, 
A CONGLOMERATE OF GARMENT FACTORIES WHICH CONTROLS ABOUT 28% 
OF VIETNAM\'S CURRENT TEXTILE EXPORTS, HAS ALREADY OPENED 
OFFICES IN NEW YORK AND HONG KONG TO INTRODUCE ITSELF TO THE 
U.S. MARKET. 
 
6.  ONE BUSINESSMAN NOTED THAT A SHIFT AWAY FROM INDONESIA 
OR PAKISTAN DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY MEAN VIETNAM WILL GET THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01255  080205Z 
BUSINESS.  THERE ARE OTHER MORE ESTABLISHED PRODUCERS WHO 
ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO MAKE GAINS. THIS BUSINESSMAN CLAIMED 
ONE CITY IN CHINA\'S GUANGDONG PROVINCE EXPORTS MORE TEXTILES 
THAN ALL OF VIETNAM.  IT MAY BE EASIER FOR BUYERS TO SHIFT 
THEIR ORDERS TO FACTORIES WHERE THEY ALREADY HAVE 
ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS ON THE GROUND.  ALL THEY WOULD 
HAVE TO DO IS INCREASE CAPACITY. 
 
7.  COMMENT:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE COMPANIES ARE SALIVATING AT 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE U.S. MARKET NOW 
THAT THE BTA IS ABOUT TO GO INTO EFFECT.  SOME HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN EXPORTING TO THE U.S. AND OTHERS ARE GEARING UP FOR THE 
NEW POSSIBILITIES.  IF THEY CAN SELL VIETNAM AS A STABLE, 
SECURE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS, IT SHOULD HELP THEM GET INTO 
THE MARKET.  THEIR STAYING POWER, HOWEVER, WILL BE 
DETERMINED BY WHETHER THEY CAN OFFER COMPETITIVE PRICING AND 
QUALITY - AN OPEN QUESTION.

SUBJECT: HCMC PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE FAVORS FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
 
1.(U) SUMMARY:  CONSUL GENERAL PAID A COURTESY CALL 
NOVEMBER 6 ON MS. PHAM PHUONG THAO, HEAD OF THE HO CHI 
MINH CITY PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE.  IN 
A CORDIAL MEETING, PHAM EXPLAINED SHE DEALS WITH A VERY 
BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES, INCLUDING URBAN PLANNING.  SHE 
SPOKE AT LENGTH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRACTING FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT TO HCMC AND ON THE PROBLEMS FLOWING FROM 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z 
INTERNAL MIGRATION.  SHE ALSO EXPLAINED HOW THE 
COMMISSION CHECKS THE MEDIA TO ENSURE ITS CONTENT FITS 
PARTY POLICIES, ALTHOUGH SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM IS 
PERMITTED.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.(U) FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  PHAM EMPHASIZED HCMC\'S 
IMPORTANT ECONOMIC ROLE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF 
VIETNAM.  SHE SAID FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS ALREADY HAD A 
POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE CITY AND SURROUNDING PROVINCES, 
INCREASING BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND AVAILABLE SERVICES. 
SHE BELIEVES LOCAL AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN 
TRANSPORTATION, EDUCATION, MEDICINE, MEDIA AND CULTURE 
IS CRUCIAL TO BOTH THE CITY\'S DEVELOPMENT AND ITS 
EFFORTS TO COMBAT SOCIAL PROBLEMS. 
 
3.(U) PHAM WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE MANY NEW BUSINESSES 
THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN HCMC AND WANTS MORE.  SHE 
NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH 5,000 BUSINESSES HAD BEEN 
ESTABLISHED IN THE PAST YEAR IN HCMC, SOME 3,000 
BUSINESSES HAVE CLOSED.  INJECTING A BIT OF HUMOR INTO 
THE PROCEEDINGS, PHAM SAID SHE WAS COMMITTED TO THE 
MARKET SYSTEM OF ECONOMICS, BUT IT WOULD BE NICER TO 
SEE A \"BETTER RATIO OF BUSINESS START-UPS TO BUSINESS 
FAILURES.\" 
 
4.(U) INTERNAL MIGRATION:  PHAM HIGHLIGHTED INTERNAL 
MIGRATION AS A MAJOR FACTOR IN HCMC\'S RAPID GROWTH. 
RURAL MIGRANTS TO HCMC PRIMARILY COME IN SEARCH OF 
BETTER PAYING JOBS, WITH SALARIES FOR THE MENIAL JOBS 
THEY FIND GENERALLY RANGING BETWEEN 40 TO 60 USD PER 
MONTH.  BUT HCMC IS SEEING SOME CITY RESIDENTS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z 
MIGRATING TO NEIGHBORING PROVINCES.  THIS OUT-MIGRATION 
IS DRIVEN BY THE DESIRE FOR HIGHER PAYING FACTORY JOBS, 
WITH SALARIES AVERAGING 100 USD PER MONTH.  PHAM SAW 
THIS OUTFLOW OF WELL-EDUCATED PEOPLE AS A PROBLEM, AND 
SAID FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO BUILD ADDITIONAL FACTORIES 
IN HCMC WOULD HELP COMBAT THIS. 
 
5.(U) MIGRATION ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS 
SUCH AS PROSTITUTION AND BEGGING.  PHAM STATED THAT 
FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN HCMC BUSINESSES IS KEY TO HELPING 
ALLEVIATE THESE SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  SHE BELIEVES FOREIGN 
INVESTMENT WILL HELP PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE OTHERWISE RELYING ON THESE 
ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR INCOME. 
 
6.(U) MASS TRANSIT:  PHAM STATED THAT THE CITY 
DESPERATELY NEEDS A MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM, EMPHASIZING 
THE ROLE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COULD PLAY IN ITS CREATION. 
SHE URGED U.S. BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN MASS TRANSIT FOR 
HCMC.  AT A MINIMUM, PHAM BELIEVES HCMC NEEDS TWO MASS 
TRANSIT CORRIDORS (NORTH-SOUTH AND EAST-WEST). IN 
ADDITION TO MASS TRANSIT, ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING 
TRAFFIC LAWS IS KEY TO MANAGING HCMC\'S TRANSPORTATION 
PROBLEMS.  PHAM HIGHLIGHTED THE CURRENT EFFORT TO TEACH 
DRIVERS IN HCMC TO FOLLOW BASIC TRAFFIC RULES, CALLING 
IT AN \"IMMENSE TASK\".  SHE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS 
PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORT -- ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO LAST 
ONE YEAR -- MIGHT HAVE TO BE EXTENDED IN ORDER TO 
PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS. 
 
7.(U) MEDIA CONTROLS:  ANOTHER ASPECT OF HCMC\'S ROLE IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01265  01 OF 02  102301Z 
THE SOUTHERN PART OF VIETNAM IS ITS FUNCTION AS A 
CENTER FOR INFORMATION AND THE MEDIA.  PHAM SAID PEOPLE 
IN HCMC ARE \"THIRSTY\" FOR NEWS - DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL.  IN HER POSITION AS HEAD OF THE HCMC 
PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND CULTURE, PHAM IS 
INSTRUMENTAL IN SETTING THE POLICY AND REGULATIONS THAT 
GOVERN THE MEDIA HERE.  SHE SAID THE DEPARTMENT OF 
CULTURE AND INFORMATION IS TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING 
THIS POLICY.  PRINT MEDIA IN HCMC SUBMIT A COPY OF 
THEIR PUBLICATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND 
INFORMATION, WHERE IT IS EVALUATED IN LIGHT OF THE 
POLICY AND REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE PARTY 
COMMISSION.  IF THE MATERIAL FAILS THE EVALUATION, IT 
CANNOT BE PUBLISHED.  (COMMENT:  ALTHOUGH CERTAIN TYPES 
OF CRITICISM ARE ACCEPTED BY THE GVN, THE PRINT MEDIA 
PRACTICES SELF-CENSORSHIP TO AVOID PROBLEMS WITH EITHER 
THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION OR THE PARTY 
COMMISSION.) 
 
8.(U) CG ASKED PHAM ABOUT THE MEDIA\'S FREEDOM OF 
EXPRESSION, ESPECIALLY RELATING TO EDITORIALS.  CG ALSO 
INQUIRED HOW FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS COULD BEST ASK FOR 
CORRECTIONS IN ARTICLES OR COMMENTARY THAT DO NOT 
ACCURATELY REFLECT THE FACTS OR THEIR VIEWS.  PHAM 
REPLIED THAT THE HCMC MEDIA SOMETIMES PROVIDE 
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM THAT STRENGTHENS THE VIETNAMESE 
GOVERNMENT.  SUCH CRITICISM HAS SOMETIMES LED TO THE 
GVN IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT PROPOSALS.  HOWEVER, SHE 
ALSO NOTED THAT SOMETIMES THE MEDIA DO NOT HAVE ALL THE 
FACTS ABOUT A CASE.  IN THOSE INSTANCES, THE LOCAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01265  02 OF 02  102301Z 
GOVERNMENT INVOLVED COMMUNICATES WITH THE MEDIA IN HCMC 
AND INFORMS THEM OF THEIR MISTAKES.  THE MEDIA THEN 
AMEND THEIR STATEMENTS AND PUBLISH THE CORRECT 
INFORMATION.  LIKEWISE, SOMETIMES THE MEDIA DO NOT HAVE 
ALL THE FACTS ABOUT EVENTS OR POLICIES IN FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES.  THE LOCAL MEDIA ARE AWARE OF THIS, AND THE 
COMMISSION URGES THEM TO BE OPEN TO MORE SOURCES OF 
INFORMATION.  CG STATED SHE WOULD TAKE UP THAT OFFER 
AND WOULD PROVIDE REPORTERS WITH ACCURATE INFORMATION 
ABOUT U.S. EVENTS/POLICIES.  THE MEETING CONCLUDED WITH 
BOTH PHAM AND THE CG EXPRESSING THEIR COMMITMENT TO 
CONTINUED OPENNESS AND ACCESSIBILITY. 
 
9.(U) COMMENT:  PHAM WAS NOTABLE FOR HER IMPRESSIVE 
COMMAND OF THE FACTS UNDERLYING HER BROAD AREAS OF 
RESPONSIBILITY.  SHE SPOKE VERY SOFTLY, BUT WITH A 
RAPID-FIRE DELIVERY, LISTING STATISTICS FROM MEMORY TO 
SUPPORT HER STATEMENTS IN ALL SUBJECT AREAS.  HER 
MANNER REMAINED FRIENDLY THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING WHEN 
MORE SENSITIVE AREAS WERE BROACHED.  THE IMPRESSION SHE 
LEFT IS THAT THE PARTY COMMISSION ON IDEOLOGY AND 
CULTURE REACHES BEYOND ITS NAME, TOUCHING MANY ASPECTS 
OF LIFE IN HCMC -- INCLUDING THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF 
URBAN PLANNING.  END COMMENT.   YAMAUCHI

REF: A) HCMC 874, B) HANOI 1250, C) HCMC 658 
 
1.(SBU) SUMMARY:  ON A TRIP TO LAM DONG PROVINCE, DPO AND 
CONOFF VISITED A MAHAYANA BUDDHIST CONVENT, A ZEN BUDDHIST 
MONASTERY AND THE DALAT CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL TO INVESTIGATE 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ISSUES IN THIS ETHNICALLY AND RELIGIOUSLY 
DIVERSE CENTRAL HIGHLAND PROVINCE.  VIETNAMESE INDIVIDUALS 
ARE FREE TO WORSHIP AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION OPENLY IN 
LAM DONG PROVINCE, ACCORDING TO ALL THREE GROUPS.  HOWEVER, 
GOVERNMENT CONTROLS REMAIN ON RELIGIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND 
ORGANIZATION.  MANY BUDDHISTS IN LAM DONG APPEAR TO BE 
AVOIDING POLITICS ALTOGETHER, AND MAKE A CLEAR DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN RELIGION AND POLITICAL ACTIVITY.  CATHOLICS IN LAM 
DONG APPEAR TO BELIEVE THE CHURCH HAS AN APPROPRIATE ROLE TO 
PLAY IN INFLUENCING POLITICS, BUT THAT ROLE SHOULD BE 
DISCREET AND NON-CONFRONTATIONAL.  PLEASE PROTECT ALL 
SOURCES ON SENSITIVE COMMENTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BUDDHIST NUNS FOCUS ON PRAYER NOT POLITICS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
2.(SBU) THE \"SU NU BUDDHIST CONVENT\" IN DALAT IS THE PRIMARY 
BUDDHIST CONVENT IN LAM DONG PROVINCE.  OF THE ROUGHLY 300 
BUDDHIST NUNS IN DALAT, 40 RESIDE AT SU NU CONVENT.  THE 
CONVENT IS OPEN TO BUDDHIST WOMEN OF ALL AGES AND ETHNIC 
BACKGROUNDS, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO ETHNIC MINORITY 
NUNS AT THE CONVENT AND ONLY A FEW IN DALAT AS A WHOLE. 
(NOTE:  NUNS THERE INDICATED ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE 
PROVINCE, AS ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM, ARE OFTEN EITHER CATHOLIC 
OR PROTESTANT).  UPON ENTRY INTO THE CONVENT, BUDDHIST NUNS 
UNDERGO RIGOROUS TRAINING IN BUDDHIST TEACHINGS AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01272  01 OF 03  130924Z 
SCRIPTURE.  TYPICALLY, A BUDDHIST NUN REACHES SENIOR RANKS 
WITHIN THE CHURCH AFTER 8-10 YEARS OF STUDY AND TRAINING. 
THE CONVENT PAYS ONLY A PORTION OF TOTAL TRAINING COSTS AND 
RECEIVES NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING OR SUPPORT. 
 
3.(SBU) WHEN ASKED BY CONOFFS ABOUT THE OFFICIAL DISTINCTION 
BETWEEN THE UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM (UBCV) AND 
THE VIETNAM BUDDHIST CHURCH (VBC), BUDDHIST NUNS AT THE 
CONVENT SAID THAT, IN THEIR OPINION, VIETNAMESE BUDDHISTS 
ARE ALL \"BUDDHIST BROTHERS AND SISTERS\" AND THAT THEY SEE NO 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOLLOWERS OF THE UBCV AND THE VBC.  THEY 
ADDED THAT THE GVN RECOGNIZES OFFICIALLY ONLY THE VBC, 
NOTING THAT LEADERS OF THE UBCV DO NOT RECOGNIZE GVN CONTROL 
OVER THE CHURCH\'S ACTIVITIES.  THE NUNS OFFERED NO 
PARTICULAR OPINIONS ABOUT GVN POLICY TOWARDS THE UBCV BUT 
SAID THAT SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS, ESPECIALLY PROTESTANTS, 
HAVE \"PROBLEMS\" WITH THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY BECOME \"TOO 
POLITICALLY INVOLVED.\"  THE NUNS SAID LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
ROUTINELY REVIEW THEIR PUBLIC ACTIVITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, 
REQUIRING PRIOR PERMISSION FOR MEETINGS OUTSIDE THE CONVENT. 
HOWEVER, THEY SAID THERE HAVE NOT BEEN RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
DAY-TO-DAY WORSHIP OF THEIR FAITH WITHIN THE CONVENT, WHICH 
IS MORE IMPORTANT TO THEM THAN POLITICAL ACTIVISM. 
 
GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS SERVE TO CONTROL CHURCH GROWTH 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
4.(SBU) CATHOLICS IN LAM DONG PROVINCE ARE FREE TO WORSHIP 
AND PRACTICE THEIR RELIGION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE.  FATHER VO 
DUC MINH, RECTOR OF DALAT CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL AND CHIEF 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DALAT DIOCESE, TOLD CONOFFS THAT A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01272  01 OF 03  130924Z 
TOTAL OF ABOUT 500 VIETNAMESE CATHOLICS ATTEND THE TWO 
MASSES HELD AT THE CATHEDRAL DAILY, WHILE A TOTAL OF ABOUT 
5000 ATTEND THE FIVE MASSES HELD EVERY SUNDAY. HE CLAIMED 
THERE ARE ROUGHLY 250,000 CATHOLICS IN THE PROVINCE, ABOUT 
25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF ABOUT 1.2 MILLION.  HE 
SAID MOST ETHNIC MINORITIES IN LAM DONG PROVINCE (OUT OF A 
TOTAL MINORITY POPULATION ESTIMATED AT 125,000) ARE 
CATHOLIC. 
 
5.(SBU) FATHER MINH SAID CATHOLIC CHILDREN, BOTH VIETNAMESE 
AND ETHNIC MINORITY, CAN LEARN THE CATHOLIC FAITH AND ARE 
FREE TO STUDY THE BIBLE.  HE EXPLAINED THERE IS VERY LITTLE, 
IF ANY, GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN THE DAY-TO-DAY WORSHIP OR 
RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES OF ORDINARY CATHOLIC CITIZENS.  HE ALSO 
SAID THERE IS LITTLE DISCRIMINATION IN DAILY LIFE FOR 
ORDINARY BELIEVERS, ALTHOUGH CATHOLICS DO NOT USUALLY REACH 
THE VERY TOP LEVELS, WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMMUNIST 
PARTY.  MINH SAID THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH AND THE GVN ARE ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANIZATIONAL IN 
NATURE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN DALAT (AS 
ELSEWHERE IN VIETNAM) CONTROLS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
SEMINARIANS AND THE NUMBER OF NEW PRIESTS THAT CAN BE 
ORDAINED.  ALSO, THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
MOVEMENT OF CLERGY, APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS AND OTHER 
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE CHURCH.  ACCORDING TO FATHER 
MINH, THESE ARE SMALL \"ANNOYANCES\" BUT THEY ADD UP OVER TIME 
LIKE \"DROPS OF WATER\" AND SERVE TO RESTRAIN THE CHURCH\'S 
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. 
 
LAM DONG CATHOLIC CHURCH \"DISCREET\" IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
6.(SBU) LAM DONG PROVINCE AVOIDED THE ETHNIC MINORITY 
DISTURBANCES THAT TOOK PLACE EARLIER THIS YEAR IN DAKLAK AND 
GIA LAI PROVINCES (REFTEL A), ALSO IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. 
FATHER MINH SAID THIS WAS, IN PART, DUE TO THE MORE ACTIVE 
EFFORTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN LAM DONG TO ASSIST ETHNIC 
MINORITIES.  HE SAID CATHOLIC CLERGY IN LAM DONG VISIT 
ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES REGULARLY BUT \"DISCREETLY\" TO 
PREACH THEIR FAITH AND PERFORM CATHOLIC SERVICES.  HE ALSO 
SAID THAT THE LAM DONG CATHOLIC CHURCH IS MORE COOPERATIVE 
AND LESS \"ANTAGONISTIC\" IN ITS DEALINGS WITH LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES THAN THE CHURCH IN OTHER PROVINCES, ALTHOUGH HE 
STRESSED HE DID NOT WANT TO CRITICIZE THE ACTIVITIES OF 
VIETNAMESE CHURCH LEADERS ELSEWHERE.  HE SAID THE CATHOLIC 
CHURCH ADVOCATES REFORMS IN LAM DONG, BUT DOES SO IN A NON- 
CONFRONTATIONAL MANNER, AND THERE HAS BEEN GRADUAL PROGRESS 
WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES (SUCH AS 
THE APPOINTMENT OF BISHOPS). 
 
7.(SBU) FATHER MINH CONTRASTED THIS A BIT WITH THE 
PROTESTANT COMMUNITY, WHICH HE FINDS MORE CONFRONTATIONAL. 
HE MENTIONED THAT MANY PROTESTANT PASTORS AND LAY PEOPLE 
LEFT VIETNAM AFTER 1975, WHILE MOST CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND 
CLERGY IN LAM DONG REMAINED TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. 
THIS LEFT MANY PROTESTANT BELIEVERS \"LIKE LOST SHEEP WITHOUT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01272  02 OF 03  130925Z 
A SHEPHERD,\" HE CLAIMED, AND THEY HAVE OVER TIME TAKEN A 
MORE ACTIVIST APPROACH TOWARDS DIFFERENCES WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT.  MINH, SPEAKING PERSONALLY, SAID HE FINDS THIS 
STYLE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT IT IS 
VERY HARD NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN VIEW 
OF THE SERIOUS SUFFERING UNDERGONE BY MANY CATHOLICS AND 
PROTESTANTS IN THE PERIOD AFTER 1975, NOTING THE SITUATION 
HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE EARLY 1990\'S. 
 
8.(SBU) NOTE:  WHILE FATHER MINH AND, IN A SEPARATE 
CONVERSATION, THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT BOTH TAKE CREDIT FOR 
THE LACK OF ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTS IN LAM DONG EARLIER 
THIS YEAR, THE COMPLEX SITUATION FACING ETHNIC MINORITIES IN 
THE PROVINCE DEFIES SIMPLE POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS 
EXPLANATIONS.  AS NOTED IN REF A, THE ISSUES SURROUNDING 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS\' UNREST INCLUDE A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS, 
INTER ALIA, MIGRATION, LAND DISPUTES, DISCRIMINATION, 
ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES, EDUCATION 
ISSUES AND OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.  FATHER MINH EMPHASIZES THE 
CHURCH\'S EFFORTS AT QUIET DIPLOMACY.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES 
STRESS THEIR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO EDUCATIONAL AND OTHER 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES.  BOTH ARE 
PROBABLY PART OF THE PUZZLE, BUT EVEN TAKEN TOGETHER THEY DO 
NOT SEEM ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN WHY LAM DONG HAS BEEN DIFFERENT 
FROM OTHER CENTRAL HIGHLAND PROVINCES.  END NOTE. 
 
WEALTHY ZEN MONASTERY WITH VISIBLE \"VIET-KIEU\" CONNECTIONS 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
9.(SBU) THE DALAT \"TRUC LAM ZEN INSTITUTION\" WAS ESTABLISHED 
IN 1994 ABOUT 6 KM FROM DALAT CITY AND NOW REPRESENTS THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01272  02 OF 03  130925Z 
LARGEST ZEN COMMUNITY IN VIETNAM (A MINORITY OF BUDDHISTS IN 
VIETNAM PRACTICE ZEN ALTHOUGH CONOFFS COULD NOT OBTAIN 
SPECIFIC FIGURES).  MASTER THICH THANH TU, CHIEF OF THE ZEN 
INSTITUTE, HAS ESTABLISHED NINE OTHER ZEN MEDITATION CENTERS 
THROUGHOUT VIETNAM.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ZEN BUDDHISTS, OF 
WHICH EIGHTY ARE MEN, RESIDE AND PRACTICE AT THE INSTITUTE 
NEAR DALAT.  THE INSTITUTE ALSO TEACHES FOLLOWERS AND 
STUDENTS ZEN MEDITATION AND PHILOSOPHY.  VISITORS, INCLUDING 
FOREIGNERS, ARE ALLOWED TO STUDY AT THE INSTITUTE, BUT THE 
LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROHIBITS FOREIGNERS FROM SPENDING THE 
NIGHT ON INSTITUTE GROUNDS.  FOREIGNERS MUST RETURN TO DALAT 
AFTER BUSINESS HOURS ALTHOUGH THEY CAN VISIT THE INSTITUTE 
AS OFTEN AS THEY LIKE. 
 
10.(SBU) THE INSTITUTE RECEIVES NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND 
ALL FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH PRIVATE DONATIONS BOTH 
DOMESTICALLY AND ABROAD.  THE NAMES OF PRIVATE DONORS THAT 
CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE INSTITUTE ARE PAINTED ON 
CONCRETE BENCHES, WHICH DOT THE INSTITUTE\'S MANICURED 
GROUNDS.  CONOFFS NOTICED THAT MOST OF THESE BENCHES BEAR 
THE NAMES OF AMERICAN \"VIET-KIEU\" (OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE) 
DONORS.  CONOFFS WERE TOLD MASTER THICH THANH TU WAS 
VISITING THE INSTITUTE\'S SAN DIEGO BRANCH (DAI DAC 
MONASTERY).  ASKED ABOUT GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS, ONE OF THE 
MONKS INDICATED ZEN BUDDHISTS ARE FREE TO WORSHIP THEIR 
RELIGION AND ARE NOT RESTRICTED BY THE GOVERNMENT, UNLESS 
THEY ARE \"INVOLVED IN POLITICS.\"  HE IMPLIED SUCH ACTIVISM 
WAS NOT THE ROLE OF THE BUDDHIST CHURCH IN LAM DONG. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
11.(SBU) IT IS DIFFICULT TO GENERALIZE FROM THE HANDFUL OF 
RELIGIOUS LEADERS WE MET IN DALAT.  THE BUDDHISTS WE 
CONTACTED IN LAM DONG APPEAR TO BE TAKING A HANDS-OFF 
APPROACH TO POLITICS BY FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON PRACTICING 
THEIR FAITH AND AVOIDING DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN POLITICAL 
ACTIVITIES.  FATHER MINH SEES A CLEAR ROLE FOR THE CHURCH IN 
INFLUENCING GRADUAL REFORM THROUGH DISCREET AND NON- 
CONFRONTATIONAL EFFORTS.  A COMMON THEME HERE -- WE HAVE 
ALSO HEARD ELSEWHERE -- IS ONE OF RELATIVE FREEDOM FOR 
RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.  RESTRICTIONS 
OCCUR AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND INCREASE AS THE GVN 
COMES TO VIEW RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AS MORE ORGANIZED, MORE 
PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY MORE POLITICAL.

SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  THE DIRECTOR OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC) TRADE 
DEPT. TOLD CG YAMAUCHI IN A NOVEMBER 13 COURTESY CALL 
THAT HCMC HAS HIGH HOPES FOR THE BILATERAL TRADE 
AGREEMENT (BTA), BUT IS LOOKING FOR A WAY TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND THE TREATY AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT.  SHE

PAGE 02        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z 
SAID SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH THE CONSULATE AND AMCHAM 
TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BTA WITH LOCAL BUSINESS, 
SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BTA. 
EVEN THOUGH HER DEPARTMENT CONTROLS A NUMBER OF STATE- 
OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES), THE DIRECTOR CLAIMED THAT THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR WAS VITAL TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND WOULD 
GENERATE MUCH OF THE EXPORT GROWTH TO BE REALIZED 
THROUGH THE BTA.  EQUITIZATION OF SOES WOULD CONTINUE, 
BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BTA A HIT IN HCMC, BUT DO WE UNDERSTAND IT? 
----------------------------------------- 
2.   CG YAMAUCHI, ACCOMPANIED BY ECONOFF, PAID A 
NOVEMBER 13 COURTESY CALL ON MS. PHAM THI KIM HONG, 
DIRECTOR OF THE HO CHI MINH CITY DEPARTMENT OF TRADE. 
IN THIS MEETING MS. HONG ADDED HER VOICE TO THE CHORUS 
OF LOCAL BUSINESSPEOPLE AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO 
SEE THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT AS A NEW STARTING 
POINT FOR VIETNAM - U.S. RELATIONS AND AN EXTRAORDINARY 
OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL BUSINESS. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY 
IMPORTANT, SHE SAID, TO HCMC, WHICH GENERATES ROUGHLY 
40% OF VIETNAM\'S EXPORT TURNOVER.  LIKE MANY, HOWEVER, 
SHE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE TREATY WAS COMPLEX AND 
ITS DETAILS LARGELY UNKNOWN TO THE GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
HERE - BOTH IN GOVERNMENT AND IN BUSINESS - WHO MUST 
IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR ITS PROVISIONS.  SHE URGED THE CG 
TO ESTABLISH STRONG LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND 
COOPERATION WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS 
TO SEE THAT BTA IMPLEMENTATION IS A SUCCESS. 
 
3.  THE DIRECTOR STRESSED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z 
WAS WORKING HARD TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE 
TO BUSINESSES IN HCMC REGARDING BOTH DOMESTIC AND 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE.  THE BTA WAS A PARTICULAR 
CHALLENGE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DIGESTIBLE, PRACTICAL 
INFORMATION, BUT IT HAS GENERATED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
INTEREST.  THE TRADE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY HELD A SEMINAR 
ON THE BTA THAT WAS VASTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED BY 
BUSINESSPEOPLE EAGER TO UNDERSTAND ITS PROVISIONS.  NOT 
ONLY WAS THE BTA DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, DIRECTOR HONG 
SAID, BUT SINCE MOST VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES DO NOT YET 
HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET, THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
RELY ON MIDDLEMEN TO GET THEIR PRODUCT TO EXPORT. 
BUSINESSES WANTED TO FIND WAYS TO WORK MORE DIRECTLY 
WITH U.S. CUSTOMERS. 
 
4.  MS. HONG SUGGESTED THAT HER DEPARTMENT WORK CLOSELY 
WITH THE CONSULATE AND AMCHAM TO PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE BTA AND HOW TO TRANSLATE IT INTO 
ACTION.  SHE WANTED TO DISTILL THE TREATY INTO SIMPLER 
LANGUAGE THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS PEOPLE COULD 
UNDERSTAND.  SHE POINTED TO AN UPCOMING SEAFOOD SEMINAR 
THAT AMCHAM IS HOSTING LATER THIS MONTH AS AN IDEAL 
EXAMPLE OF WHAT VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING FOR. 
(NOTE:  THE CONGEN WILL BE DELIVERING OPENING REMARKS 
AT THIS SEMINAR.) 
 
5.  CG ASKED IF A SMALL WORKING GROUP COMPOSED OF THE 
CONSULATE, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, AND PERHAPS AMCHAM 
WOULD BE HELPFUL IN DISCUSSING BTA ISSUES AT THE LOCAL 
LEVEL, SHARING INFORMATION AND NEEDS.  THE DIRECTOR 
AGREED, AND SAID SHE WOULD DISCUSS THIS IDEA WITH HER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01302  01 OF 02  160948Z 
STAFF. 
 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR\'S VITAL ROLE 
------------------------------- 
6.  THE DIRECTOR STRESSED THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE 
MANY POWERFUL STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES IN HCMC, SOME OF 
WHICH WERE UNDER THE DIRECT CONTROL OF HER DEPARTMENT, 
THE DEPARTMENT DID NOT DISCRIMINATE IN FAVOR OF THESE 
SOES.  IN MS. HONG\'S VIEW, THE PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD 
GENERATE MUCH OF THE GROWTH AS A RESULT OF BTA 
IMPLEMENTATION.  WHEN ECONOFF ASKED IF IT WERE CORRECT 
THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF EXPORTS FROM HCMC WERE IN 
FACT FROM SOES, MS. HONG NOTED THAT ACCORDING TO 
OFFICIAL STATISTICS THAT WAS INDEED CORRECT.  HOWEVER, 
SHE DOUBTED THEIR ACCURACY.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO 
MEASURE THE TRUE VALUE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PRODUCTION AND 
EXPORTS, SHE STATED.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT MANY SMALL 
PRIVATE SECTOR BUSINESSES EXPORT VIA SOES WHICH MAY 
DISTORT THE STATISTICS. 
 
7.  CURRENTLY THE U.S. MARKET ONLY TAKES ABOUT 17% OF 
HCMC\'S EXPORT TURNOVER.  MS. HONG ANTICIPATES THAT WITH 
THE BTA THIS SHARE WILL GROW DRAMATICALLY, MOSTLY WITH 
EXPORTS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  SHE HIGHLIGHTED 
FOOTWARE, GARMENTS, AND SEAFOOD AS PARTICULARLY 
IMPORTANT EXPORT PRODUCTS FOR THE REGION.  SHE FURTHER 
STATED THAT SINCE MANY MAJOR U.S. COMPANIES HAVE A 
PRESENCE IN HCMC, IMPORTS FROM THE U.S. SHOULD ALSO 
INCREASE DRAMATICALLY. 
 
EQUTIZING SOES TAKES TIME

PAGE 02        HO CHI  01302  02 OF 02  160949Z 
8.  CG INQUIRED ABOUT THE HCMC GOVERNMENT\'S PLANS TO 
EQUITIZE MOST OF THE COMPANIES COMPRISING SAIGON 
TRADING CORPORATION, OR SATRA, WHICH IS AN SOE MANAGED 
BY THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF TRADE.  SATRA CONSISTS OF 23 
AFFILIATES, 3 JOINT STOCK COMPANIES, AND 3 JOINT 
VENTURES, AND EMPLOYS ABOUT 19,000 PEOPLE.  ACCORDING 
TO RECENT PRESS REPORTS, THE CITY WILL EQUITIZE 17 
AFFILIATES OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  DIRECTOR HONG 
INDICATED, HOWEVER, THAT ALTHOUGH EQUITIZATION WAS A 
GOAL AND INCORPORATED INTO AN OVERALL PLAN, IN REALITY 
IT WOULD NOT OCCUR QUICKLY.  THIS WAS DUE TO SOME OF 
THE AFFILIATES AND PROBLEMS WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS 
WORKING TO BLOCK THIS INITIATIVE.  SHE DID POINT OUT IT 
WAS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT, AND THAT IN THE PAST 
IT HAD MANAGED 50-60 SOES, MANY OF WHICH HAD ALREADY 
BEEN SPUN OFF.  ALTHOUGH THE CITY WOULD STILL WANT TO 
RETAIN CONTROL OF KEY SECTORS SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, IT 
WAS COMMITTED TO EQUITIZING OTHER SOES UNDER ITS 
CONTROL. 
 
9.  EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTMENT STILL CONTROLS A NUMBER 
OF SOES, DIRECTOR HONG STRESSED THAT THE TRADE 
DEPARTMENT WAS WORKING TO ENCOURAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
TO PARTICIPATE IN ITS TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES.  SHE 
NOTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN LAST MONTH\'S 
HCMC EXPO WERE PRIVATE COMPANIES.  IN ORDER FOR THE 
CITY TO DEVELOP, THE PRIVATE SECTOR MUST PLAY A VITAL 
ROLE, SHE SAID.

10.  AT THE CLOSE OF THE MEETING, THE DIRECTOR STATED 
THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF THE PLANE CRASH IN NEW YORK THAT 
HAD HAPPENED THE DAY BEFORE.  SHE EXTENDED HER 
CONDOLENCES TO THE U.S. AND TO THE FAMILIES OF THE 
VICTIMS.  CG THANKED HER AND STATED THAT EVEN IN THIS 
DIFFICULT PERIOD, THE U.S. WAS A RESILIENT NATION AND 
THAT WE STILL WANTED TO WORK HARD WITH VIETNAM ON 
BUILDING A STRONG RELATIONSHIP. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11.  MS. HONG IS A DYNAMIC INTERLOCUTOR AND THERE WAS 
NO MISTAKING HER PLEAS FOR ASSISTANCE.  SHE REALIZES 
THAT THE BTA IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR HCMC, BUT SHE 
ALSO KNOWS THAT UNLESS LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS 
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE TREATY\'S PROVISIONS 
AND ACT UPON THEM, THIS OPPORTUNITY WILL PASS THEM BY. 
 
12.  MS. HONG IS COMPLETING HER FOURTH YEAR AS THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, AND CLEARLY 
DOES NOT WANT HCMC TO BE OUTSHONE AS VIETNAM\'S PRE- 
EMINENT COMMERCIAL ENGINE.  SHE WANTS THE CONGEN AS AN 
ALLY.  OF THE SEVERAL COURTESY CALLS THE CG HAS MADE ON 
LOCAL OFFICIALS, MS. HONG IS THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS 
SO EXPLICITLY STATED HER CONCERNS ABOUT HCMC\'S ABILITY 
TO MEET PEOPLE\'S EXPECTATIONS OF THE BTA.  POST WILL BE 
LOOKING TO REGULARIZE COMMUNICATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT 
OF TRADE ON BTA ISSUES AND ENSURE THEY ARE INCLUDED IN 
ALL RELEVANT TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SEMINARS.

SUBJECT: CG\'S INITIAL MEETING WITH HCMC PLANNING AND INVESTMENT DEPARTMENT 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: CG YAMAUCHI, ACCOMPANIED BY DPO AND POLOFF, PAID A 
NOVEMBER 20 COURTESY CALL ON MR. TIN HUU NGUYEN, ACTING DIRECTOR 
OF THE HCMC DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT (DPI). TIN 
STATED THAT THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA) WOULD INCREASE 
ECONOMIC GROWTH IN HCMC.  TIN VOWED DPI WOULD STRIVE TO ENSURE 
VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE IN U.S. MARKETS. 
HE IS EQUALLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE AMERICAN INVESTORS AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  01314  01 OF 02  230447Z 
BUSINESSES IN VIETNAM FACE LESS BUREAUCRACY AND MORE OPENNESS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
2. AFTER WELCOMING CG TO VIETNAM, TIN PROVIDED A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF 
BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN HCMC.  CITING HMCO\'S PROMISING DOUBLE-DIGIT 
ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE IN THE EARLY 1990S, TIN ADMITTED THAT THE 
REGIONAL ECONOMIC CRISIS HAD TAKEN ITS TOLL -- THE CITY\'S ECONOMIC 
GROWTH RATE IS NOW BELOW 10%.  TIN, HOWEVER, PAINTED AN OPTIMISTIC 
PICTURE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE CITY: HCMC HAS INVESTORS FROM 42 
NATIONS; U.S. INVESTORS ARE AMONG THE TOP FOREIGN INVESTORS; AND 
FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI) CONTINUES TO CONTRIBUTE 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO ECONOMIC GROWTH.  TIN ADDED THAT DPI WILL 
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE POLICIES TO ENSURE AN EVEN ECONOMIC PLAYING 
FIELD EXISTS BETWEEN STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOWS), THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR, AND FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES, BUT DID NOT ELABORATE 
UPON THE MECHANISMS DPI WOULD EMPLOY. 
 
3. TIN WELCOMED RATIFICATION OF THE BTA.  AS BUSINESS COOPERATION 
PROGRESSED, HE SAID, BOTH THE U.S. AND VIETNAM WOULD BENEFIT. 
CITING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT TO CREATE FAVORABLE 
CONDITIONS, TIN STATED THAT DPI WAS CONCERNED WITH HOW BEST TO 
HELP VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES PENETRATE THE AMERICAN MARKET, 
SPECIFICALLY CITING A NEED FOR VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND U.S. BUSINESS LAWS. 
 
4. PURSUING TIN\'S STATEMENT THAT VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES REQUIRED 
MORE EDUCATION, THE CG INQUIRED WHETHER VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENTAL 
AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES POSSESSED SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE 
SUBSTANTIVE DETAILS OF THE BTA.  TIN RESPONDED THAT DPI IS NOT 
RESPONSIBLE FOR EDUCATING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ABOUT THE BTA\'S 
DETAILS--THAT RESPONSIBILITY RESTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01314  01 OF 02  230447Z 
AND INVESTMENT AND THE NEWLY-RENAMED INVESTMENT AND TRADE 
PROMOTION CENTER (ITPC). WHEN CG ASKED WHETHER POST COULD PROVIDE 
INFORMATION TO HELP DPI ASSIST BOTH U.S. AND VIETNAMESE 
BUSINESSES, TIN STATED THAT HE LOOKED FORWARD TO A COOPERATIVE 
RELATIONSHIP AND STATED THAT DPI WAS WORKING ON A LIST OF PROJECTS 
THAT WOULD EDUCATE VIETNAMESE BUSINESSES AND ENCOURAGE FOREIGN 
INVESTORS.  HE LOOKED FORWARD TO CG\'S COOPERATION IN THE FUTURE 
AND SAID HE WOULD PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ON AREAS FOR 
COOPERATION AT A LATER DATE. 
 
5. SHIFTING GEARS, CG ASKED HOW IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECTIVE 28 -- 
A RECENTLY PASSED ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM -- WAS PROGRESSING.  TIN 
STATED THAT ALL VIETNAMESE AGENCIES WELCOMED DIRECTIVE 28, BECAUSE 
IT AIMS TO REDUCE THE BUREAUCRACY FACED BY FOREIGN INVESTORS. 
ACCORDING TO TIN, THE DIRECTIVE REQUIRES DPI TO PROVIDE FOREIGN 
INVESTORS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT LAND AVAILABLE FOR RENT IN HCMC, 
AND TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR FOREIGNERS TO 
RECEIVE PERMITS TO SET UP BUSINESSES.  WHEN QUESTIONED, TIN 
ACKNOWLEDGED THE DPI WOULD NOT RECEIVE ADDITIONAL STAFF/RESOURCES 
TO ACCOMPLISH ITS NEW ACCELERATED ROLE AS A SERVICE PROVIDER.  HE 
SAID DPI - AND OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS -- WOULD INSTEAD RESTRUCTURE 
THEMSELVES AND OFFER A WEBSITE TO HELP DISSEMINATE INFORMATION. 
TIN PROMISED THAT DPI WOULD CONTINUE TO CREATE MORE OPEN 
CONDITIONS IN HCMC TO ATTRACT AMERICAN INVESTMENT. 
 
6. ASKED IF DIRECTIVE 28 WOULD REQUIRE DPI TO WORK MORE CLOSELY 
WITH OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, TIN RESPONDED THAT THE HCMC 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE REQUIRED ALL AGENCIES, IN LIGHT OF DIP\'S NEW 
MISSION, TO RESTRUCTURE THEMSELVES AND COOPERATE WITH DPI.  TIN 
STATED THAT REPRESENTATIVES FROM DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES 
MEET WEEKLY TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS, AND THAT ANY CONFLICTS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01314  01 OF 02  230447Z 
THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED ARE THEN REFERRED TO THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE FOR RESOLUTION.  TIN DECLINED TO CITE ANY SPECIFIC 
DISAGREEMENTS AMONG GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, BUT SUGGESTED THEY 
RELATED TO HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC PROJECTS.  HE 
ADDED THAT THERE WERE ALWAYS SUCH CONFLICTS, BUT THEIR NUMBER AND 
SERIOUSNESS HAD DECLINED SINCE GENERAL AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED 
ON THE NEED TO CREATE BETTER CONDITIONS FOR FOREIGN BUSINESS. 
DPI\'S CLEARER COORDINATING ROLE HAS ALSO HELPED. 
 
7. TIN CLOSED THE 45-MINUTE MEETING BY HANDING OUT DPI\'S SLICK NEW 
ENGLISH-LANGUAGE BROCHURE -- COMPLETE WITH A CD ENTITLED \"A CITY 
OF OPPORTUNITY & PROSPERITY: TEN REASONS WHY HO CHI MINH CITY 
SHOULD BE YOUR INVESTMENT DESTINATION.\" 
 
8. NOTE ON DPI: TIN WAS JUST NAMED ACTING DIRECTOR OF DPI AT THE 
BEGINNING OF OCTOBER, HAVING SERVED AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR.  DPI 
TRADITIONALLY IS A VERY POWERFUL BODY.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN DECEMBER 
1999, NEW PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OFFICERS WERE SELECTED IN ALL OF 
VIETNAM\'S PROVINCES.  OF THE NEWLY-SELECTED PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN, MORE HAD SERVED AS DIRECTOR OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE DPIS JUST PRIOR TO THEIR PROMOTION THAN ANY OTHER 
DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY.  END NOTE. 
 
 
9. COMMENT:  THIS MEETING WAS ONE OF SEVERAL POST HAS HAD RECENTLY 
TO ASSESS THE LIKELY IMPACT OF DIRECTIVE 28.  THE \"STREAMLINED\" 
PROCEDURES ARE A POSITIVE STEP, BUT TIN\'S COMMENTS SUGGEST DPI IS 
STILL FEELING ITS WAY.  PERHAPS CAUTIOUS BECAUSE OF HIS VERY 
RECENT APPOINTMENT, TIN SEEMED MORE RIGID, STRAIGHT BY-THE-BOOK, 
\"NOT IN MY JOB DESCRIPTION\" THAN OTHER HCMC OFFICIALS WE HAVE MET. 
DESPITE A SLICK OPENING PRESENTATION, WE EXPECT CONTINUED

HISTORICALLY BEEN A \"LAB\" FOR EXPERIMENTATION ON POLICY 
FORMATION.  HE CITED THREE EXAMPLES ON THE SOCIAL 
FRONT: POVERTY REDUCTION AND HUNGER ELIMINATION, 
\"HOUSES OF COMPASSION\" AND \"HOUSES OF GRATITUDE.\" 
(NOTE: THE LATTER TWO ARE SOCIAL PROGRAMS PROVIDING 
HOUSING TO POOR FAMILIES AND TO FAMILIES WHO LOST 
MEMBERS DURING THE WAR.)  HE ADDED THAT THE HCMC CPC IS 
CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON A NUMBER OF OTHER SOCIAL AND 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, NOTING HE IS IN CHARGE 
OF MONITORING AND IMPLEMENTING ALL PROGRAMS DEVELOPED 
BY THE CPC.  HE CITED PROGRAMS ON STREET CRIME,

IMPLEMENTATION.  HE ADDED THAT HE HOPES CONGEN HCMC 
WILL PLAY A LEADING ROLE IN LINKING U.S. AND VIETNAMESE 
BUSINESSES AND LOOKS FORWARD TO A CLOSER WORKING 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USG AND GVN. 
 
5. TURNING TO THE DELICATE ISSUE OF PRESS COVERAGE, DPO 
ASKED HOW THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD BEST WORK TO 
ADDRESS A LACK OF BALANCE IN VIETNAMESE PRESS REPORTING 
ON THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM IN AFGHANISTAN.  CUONG 
REPLIED THAT, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE DETAILS 
ABOUT HOW REPORTING IS DEVELOPED, NEWSPAPERS IN VIETNAM 
REPORT NEWS ONLY \"TO THE LEVEL OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE.\"  IN 
ADDITION TO INCOMPLETE INFORMATION, CUONG SAID ANOTHER 
PROBLEM THE PRESS FACES IS THE GROWING 
COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE PAPERS AND A RESULTING 
SENSATIONALISM OF THE NEWS AS THE MEDIA COMPETES TO 
\"MAKE A BUCK.\"  HE SAID THERE HAVE BEEN CASES WHERE THE 
PARTY ITSELF HAS BEEN DISPLEASED WITH PRESS REPORTING. 
AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION HE SAID HE \"TOOK NOTE\" OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

LEEWAY IN THE WAY EDITORS CAN PRESENT THE NEWS, WE HAVE 
BEEN TOLD THEY MUST CLEAR THEIR MATERIAL BEFORE IT IS 
PUBLISHED TO ENSURE IT IS IN LINE WITH PARTY VIEWS -- 
WHICH ON IMPORTANT ISSUES ARE DETERMINED IN HANOI.) 
 
6. COMMENT:  THIS MEETING FOUND CUONG MORE WILLING TO 
ENGAGE THAN IN THE PAST, WHILE STILL FOCUSED ON SET 
RESPONSES TO SENSITIVE TOPICS.  ON ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT, IN PARTICULAR, IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT THIS 
CPC OFFICIAL EXPRESSED HIGH HOPES FOR THE BTA AND 
AGREED PROPER IMPLEMENTATION IS IMPORTANT AND WILL 
REQUIRE SOME CHANGES.  HE ALSO CONFIRMED HCMC\'S ROLE AS 
AN INCUBATOR FOR NEW IDEAS -- AND WAS EVEN QUICK TO 
PICK UP ON THE NEED FOR MORE OPENNESS TO ATTRACT 
FOREIGN BUSINESS.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP 
PROGRAMS EARLY ON, WHICH WILL HELP HCMC CAPITALIZE ON 
THE BTA AND BECOME A MODEL FOR MODERN BUSINESS 
PRACTICES COUNTRYWIDE.   YAMAUCHI

HOSTED A DINNER TO INTRODUCE THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, 
WHICH HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE U.S. MARKET.  AN 
ALSO HEADS VINATEX, A STATE-OWNED CORPORATION 
CONTROLLING 60 TEXTILE AND GARMENT COMPANIES IN WHICH 
THE GVN HOLDS A MAJORITY STAKE. 
 
3.  AN WILL TRAVEL TO THE U.S. AS PART OF THE OFFICIAL 
BUSINESS DELEGATION ACCOMPANYING DEPUTY PM DZUNG IN 
DECEMBER, FOR THE EXCHANGE OF LETTERS IMPLEMENTING THE 
BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA).  AN WANTS THE VISIT TO 
BE MUCH MORE THAN SYMBOLIC.  WHILE IN THE U.S., HE WILL 
OFFICIALLY OPEN A VINATEX REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE 
(ALREADY UP AND RUNNING) IN NEW YORK CITY\'S GARMENT 
DISTRICT.  IN LOS ANGELES, HE WILL SCOUT LOCATIONS TO 
ESTABLISH A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE FOR VITAS.  AN WILL 
ALSO MEET WITH U.S. CLOTHING RETAILERS -- INCLUDING THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01345  291026Z 
GAP, THE LIMITED, AND SEARS. THOUGH HE CHARACTERIZED 
THE CALLS AS INTRODUCTORY, HE HOPES VINATEX CAN WALK 
AWAY WITH CONTRACTS FROM THIS TRIP. 
AN SAID VINATEX EVENTUALLY WANTS TO COMPETE IN THE 
AMERICAN MARKET WITH HIGH-END PRODUCTS, FOR NOW THEY 
WILL FOCUS ON MID-RANGE, READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL. 
 
4.  VINATEX AND THE GVN EXPECT THE GARMENT INDUSTRY TO 
BENEFIT QUICKLY FROM THE BTA, WITH TARIFFS FALLING TO 
AS LOW AS 5 TO 6 PERCENT FROM THE CURRENT 45 TO 50 
PERCENT.  LOCAL NEWS REPORTS STATE THAT THE GVN EXPECTS 
GARMENT EXPORTS TO THE U.S. TO REACH US$200 MILLION IN 
2002.  THIS YEAR THEY SHOULD REACH US$50 MILLION, WITH 
US$17 MILLION COMING FROM VINATEX ALONE. 
 
5.  ALSO AT THE DINNER WAS POPULAR FASHION DESIGNER MS. 
MINH HANH, WHO STARTED WITH VINATEX, BUT NOW OPERATES 
HER OWN BOUTIQUE AND WORKSHOP. SHE JOKINGLY - BUT 
POINTEDLY - REMARKED THAT STATE ENTERPRISES DO \"NOT PAY 
LIVING WAGES,\" WHICH WAS WHY SHE BRANCHED OUT INTO 
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  PLUS, SHE WANTED MORE QUALITY 
CONTROL OVER HER DESIGNS.  SHE STILL DOES SOME WORK FOR 
VINATEX, BUT KEEPS THE MORE SOPHISTICATED FASHIONS FOR 
HER OTHER CLIENTS.  MS. SAO KIM, DEPUTY EDITOR FOR 
\"MOT\" FASHION MAGAZINE, AGREED WITH MINH HANH\'S 
CRITICISMS OF QUALITY CONTROL AND LOW SALARIES. 
 
6.  COMMENT:  VIETNAM\'S TEXTILE INDUSTRY -- 
CONCENTRATED PRIMARILY IN THE SOUTH -- HAS MOVED 
AGGRESSIVELY TO PREPARE FOR BTA IMPLEMENTATION. VINATEX 
AND OTHER LOCAL COMPANIES ARE LOOKING FOR NEW BUSINESS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01345  291026Z 
- AND FAST.  AN REPEATEDLY STRESSED THAT AS PART OF THE 
VIETNAMESE DELEGATION, HE WOULD \"REPRESENT ALL 
GARMENT/TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS, NOT JUST THE STATE-OWNED 
ENTERPRISES.\"  IF - AND IT IS A BIG IF - THE VIETNAMESE 
GARMENT INDUSTRY CAN MEET THE QUALITY EXPECTATIONS OF 
AMERICAN BUYERS, THEN IT DOES APPEAR READY TO TAKE OFF 
UNDER THE BTA.  END COMMENT.   YAMAUCHI

1. SUMMARY: AS THE FOURTH-RANKING MEMBER IN VIETNAM\'S 
POLITBURO, HO CHI MINH CITY\'S COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY 
NGUYEN MINH TRIET IS A MAJOR POLITICAL FORCE.  IN A 
MEETING WITH CONSUL GENERAL, TRIET EMPHATICALLY 
DEFENDED VIETNAM\'S RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM.  BUT HE INVITED CG TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON 
THESE AND OTHER ISSUES \"WHERE GAPS REMAIN\", IN AN 
EFFORT TO IMPROVE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TRIET: \"WE SHOULD NOT AVOID RAISING SENSITIVE ISSUES\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
2. CONSUL GENERAL PAID AN INITIAL COURTESY CALL ON MR. 
NGUYEN MINH TRIET ON DECEMBER 10, AT HCMC COMMUNIST 
PARTY HEADQUARTERS.  TRIET OPENED THE MEETING, NOTING 
THAT HE BELIEVED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILATERAL 
TRADE AGREEMENT WILL OPEN A \"NEW ERA\" OF IMPROVED 
BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN VIETNAM AND THE U.S. 
IMPLEMENTATION WILL PREPARE VIETNAM FOR ACCESSION TO 
THE WTO - \"THE NEXT STEP\" -- HE SAID, AND HE LOOKED 
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH CONGEN DURING THAT PROCESS. 
 
3. LIKENING THE U.S. AND VIETNAM TO FAMILY MEMBERS, 
TRIET SAID IT IS NORMAL FOR TWO COUNTRIES TO HAVE 
DIFFERENCES ON CERTAIN ISSUES.  HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT 
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT AVOID CONFRONTING ISSUES WHERE 
THERE ARE \"GAPS IN UNDERSTANDING,\" ESPECIALLY WHEN SUCH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01381  01 OF 02  120135Z 
DISCUSSIONS COULD MOVE THE TWO SIDES CLOSER TOGETHER. 
HE SAID NEITHER SIDE SHOULD HESITATE TO RAISE SENSITIVE 
MATTERS. 
 
4. CG THEN ASKED TRIET WHAT HE THOUGHT WERE THE MOST 
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN THE U.S.-VIETNAM BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  TRIET DID NOT TAKE THE BAIT.  HE 
RESPONDED ONLY THAT WE SHOULD FIND SOLUTIONS TO 
PROBLEMS THROUGH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING; WE SHOULD NOT 
MAKE MOUNTAINS OUT OF MOLEHILLS; AND WE SHOULD NOT 
ALLOW DIFFERENCES TO TURN US INTO OPPONENTS. 
 
CG: \"THEN LET\'S TALK ABOUT THICH QUANG DO... 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
5. CG SAID SHE WOULD TAKE UP TRIET\'S INVITATION TO 
RAISE A COUPLE OF SENSITIVE ISSUES.  SHE NOTED THAT 
THICH QUANG DO, THE SECOND-RANKING MONK OF THE BANNED 
UNIFIED BUDDHIST CHURCH OF VIETNAM, HAS BEEN UNDER 
HOUSE ARREST AND HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED TO RECEIVE 
VISITORS SINCE JUNE.  REMINDING TRIET THAT THE GERMAN 
EMBASSY HAD BEEN REFUSED A VISIT, SHE THEN ASKED TRIET 
IF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO VISIT DO. 
 
6. TRIET SAID HE WAS PROUD OF VIETNAM\'S RECORD ON HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION.  VIETNAM STRUGGLED FOR 
CENTURIES FOR INDEPENDENCE, AND NOW THAT INDEPENDENCE 
HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, HE SAID, PEOPLE KNOW TRUE FREEDOM. 
ONE HALF MILLION CATHOLICS, MANY MORE BUDDHISTS, AND 
MEMBERS OF SEVERAL OTHER RELIGIOUS GROUPS IN HCMC HAVE 
THE FREEDOM TO WORSHIP, DECLARED TRIET.  BUT, HE ADDED, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01381  01 OF 02  120135Z 
THERE ARE A VERY FEW PERSONS WHO ABUSE THESE FREEDOMS. 
IN DOING SO THEY BREAK THE LAW.  THESE ARE CIVIL CASES, 
HE SAID, NOT CASES OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND ARE DEALT 
WITH ACCORDING TO VIETNAMESE LAW. 
 
7. CG REPLIED THAT NO MATTER HOW VIETNAM MIGHT 
CHARACTERIZE THICH QUANG DO, HE IS AN INTERNATIONAL 
FIGURE AND MANY PEOPLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT HIS HEALTH AND WELL BEING. 
 
8. TRIET DECLARED THAT DO WAS IN GOOD HEALTH, AND THAT 
THE GVN IS TAKING GOOD CARE OF HIM, SENDING A PHYSICIAN 
REGULARLY TO MONITOR HIS HEALTH.  HE WAS FULLY AWARE 
THAT SHOULD ANYTHING GO WRONG WITH DO\'S HEALTH, \"THERE 
ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT 
SITUATION\" TO MAKE VIETNAM LOOK BAD. 
 
9. CG SAID SHE WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE TRIET AT HIS WORD 
THAT DO\'S HEALTH WAS BEING LOOKED AFTER AND WOULD 
REPORT THIS TO THE EMBASSY AND WASHINGTON.  THIS DID 
NOT MEAN, HOWEVER, THAT SHE WOULD NOT SEEK TO VISIT DO 
IN THE FUTURE.  TRIET LET THAT PASS. 
 
...AND ACCESS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS\" 
--------------------------------------- 
 
10. CG TOLD TRIET THAT SHE HAD PLANNED TO VISIT THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS THIS WEEK, BUT DAK LAK AND KON TUM 
PROVINCES HAD, LATE LAST FRIDAY, NOTIFIED THE CONGEN 
THAT THE PROVINCIAL PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEES WERE TOO BUSY 
TO RECEIVE HER.  SHE NOTED HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR 
DIPLOMATS TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL, MEET PEOPLE, AND REPORT 
ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY ON WHAT THEY SEE AND HEAR. SHE 
ASKED TRIET\'S ADVICE ON HOW TO BEST PROCEED. 
 
11. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT, EARLIER IN THE YEAR, 
TRAVEL TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WAS RESTRICTED BECAUSE 
OF SECURITY PROBLEMS.  HE STATED, HOWEVER, THAT IT WAS 
CURRENT STATE POLICY \"NOT TO PROHIBIT ANYONE\" FROM 
VISITING THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. HE PROMISED TO VOICE 
HIS SUPPORT OF CONGEN TRAVEL TO THE AREA. 
 
12. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS LAGGED BEHIND MOST 
OF VIETNAM\'S OTHER PROVINCES.  HE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT WITHIN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, ETHNIC MINORITY 
GROUPS LAGGED BEHIND ETHNIC VIETNAMESE KINH, BOTH 
ECONOMICALLY AND EDUCATIONALLY.  HE EMPHASIZED THAT THE 
GVN HAD DEVISED POLICIES FOR IMPROVING THE LIVING 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01381  02 OF 02  120135Z 
STANDARDS FOR THE CENTRAL HIGHLAND MINORITY GROUPS AND 
THAT, COMPARED TO 25 YEARS AGO, THEIR SITUATION HAD 
IMPROVED GREATLY. 
 
13. THE UNREST IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OCCURRED, 
ACCORDING TO TRIET, BECAUSE OUTSIDERS ENCOURAGED SOME 
DISSATISFIED PERSONS TO AGITATE FOR AN AUTONOMOUS 
STATE.  TRIET SAID VIETNAM WOULD BE FIRM AGAINST ANY 
NOTION OF AUTONOMY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WOULD CONTINUE 
TO WORK TOWARD IMPROVING THE LIVES OF ITS ETHNIC 
MINORITIES.  VIETNAM IS A UNIFIED COUNTRY, HE 
EMPHASIZED, AND WILL REMAIN SO. 
 
BIONOTE

14. TRIET WAS BORN IN BINH DUONG (FORMERLY SONG BE) 
PROVINCE, JUST NORTH OF SAIGON, AND GREW UP IN SAIGON. 
DURING THE WAR YEARS, HE WORKED FOR THE CENTRAL 
COMMUNIST PARTY MASS MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE, SOUTHERN 
BUREAU.  DURING 1976-1987, HE WORKED FOR THE CENTRAL HO 
CHI MINH YOUTH UNION.  IN 1991, HE BECAME SECRETARY OF 
THE SONG BE PROVINCE COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE, AND 
FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 1997, HE WAS VICE-CHAIRMAN OF 
THE HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY COMMITTEE (WHILE CONCURRENTLY 
VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE).  FROM 
HCMC, HE WENT TO HANOI TO HEAD THE POWERFUL MASS 
MOBILIZATION COMMITTEE OF THE CENTRAL COMMUNIST PARTY. 
IN JANUARY 2000, HE RETURNED TO HCMC AS THE CITY\'S 
COMMUNIST PARTY CHIEF.  IN APRIL 2001, HE MOVED UP TO 
NUMBER FOUR IN THE POLITBURO, OUTRANKED ONLY BY THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

PRESIDENT, PRIME MINISTER AND COMMUNIST PARTY GENERAL 
SECRETARY.  SOME OBSERVERS BELIEVE TRIET WILL BECOME 
 
SIPDIS 
VIETNAM\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER. HE IS 59-YEARS OLD. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15. TRIET PROVED TRUE TO HIS REPUTATION OF BEING 
ENGAGING AND PERSONABLE, IF SOMEWHAT DOCTRINAIRE.  HE 
DID NOT BAT AN EYELASH WHEN THE CG SAID WE WOULD HOLD 
HIM TO HIS WORD ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THICH QUANG DO. 
CONGEN WILL STILL SEEK TO VISIT DO.  CG IS MOVING AHEAD 
WITH HER TRIP TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  RESPONDING TO 
TRIET\'S NUMEROUS OFFERS TO DISCUSS SENSITIVE BILATERAL 
ISSUES \"OR ANY OTHER PROBLEMS\", CG SAID PERHAPS IN A 
MORE INFORMAL SETTING, OVER LUNCH OR DINNER.  TRIET 
SORT OF SAID \"UUHMM\".  CONGEN WILL  SEEK AN APPROPRIATE 
TIME TO MEET WITH TRIET TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE WITH 
HIM.  YAMAUCHI

9, TO WARN THEM NOT TO USE CHRISTMAS AS AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO \"CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR THE GOVERNMENT.\"  THE PROTESTANT 
LEADERS SAID THEY INTERPRETED THIS WARNING NOT AS A 
PROHIBITION ON RELIGIOUS CHRISTMAS GATHERINGS, BUT 
RATHER AS A CAUTION NOT TO CRITICIZE THE GOVERNMENT AT 
ANY LARGE PUBLIC GATHERINGS AT CHRISTMAS TIME.  THEY 
EXPECT TO GO AHEAD WITH A PLANNED GATHERING OF UP TO

PRIESTS HAVE AGREED TO LET THEM \"BORROW\" THE CHURCH FOR

2. (SBU) THE PROTESTANT LEADERS WERE AWARE THAT ON 
DECEMBER 11, SEVERAL PROTESTANT PASTORS FROM VIETNAM\'S 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WERE SUMMONED TO HANOI TO HEAR A 
SIMILAR WARNING.  THE VIETNAM NEWS AGENCY REPORTED THAT 
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER NGUYEN VAN AN HAD ASKED THE 
PASTORS TO \"CONVEY HIS MERRY CHRISTMAS WISHES TO THE 
PROTESTANT COMMUNITY IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS,\" BUT 
ALSO WARNED THEM TO \"STAY VIGILANT AND FIGHT BAD

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: ACCORDING TO TWO ETHNIC MINORITY 
LEADERS, ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS ENCOUNTERED A MIXTURE OF TOLERANCE AND 
REPRESSION BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AT CHRISTMASTIME. 
THERE WERE ALLEGED INCIDENTS OF SEVERE POLICE ABUSE IN 
SOME VILLAGES, BUT IN OTHER VILLAGES, AUTHORITIES 
SEEMED TO ALLOW GROUPS AS LARGE AS SEVERAL HUNDRED 
PEOPLE TO ATTEND CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICES.  IN A 
SEPARATE INCIDENT, VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS WERE ALLEGED TO 
HAVE KILLED AS MANY AS EIGHT PERSONS WHEN UP TO 230 
PERSONS WERE PREVENTED FROM CROSSING THE BORDER INTO 
CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  SEPTEL REPORTS FURTHER ON 
PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
CHRISTMAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
---------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) ON JANUARY 15, TWO ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT 
LEADERS, ONE FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE AND ONE FROM GIA LAI 
PROVINCE, CAME DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS TO MEET 
WITH CG AND POLOFF FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS.  THEY SAID 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS HAD BEEN 
WORRIED THAT THE SAME GROUPS WHO HAD ORGANIZED ANTI- 
GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN FEBRUARY/MARCH 2001 WOULD 
USE CHRISTMAS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAGE MORE 
DEMONSTRATIONS.  OFFICIALS IN THE VARIOUS LOCALITIES 
TOOK DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN TRYING TO PREVENT 
CHRISTMAS GATHERINGS FROM GETTING OUT OF HAND.  IN SOME 
LOCATIONS, OFFICIALS ALLOWED GATHERINGS OF SEVERAL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00039  01 OF 03  151450Z 
HUNDRED PEOPLE; IN OTHER PLACES, THEY ALLOWED PEOPLE TO 
PRAY TOGETHER ONLY IN SMALL GROUPS IN THEIR HOMES.  YET 
IN OTHERS, PROTESTANT CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS WERE 
FORBIDDEN OUTRIGHT. SOME LOCAL AUTHORITIES PUSHED 
CHRISTMAS SERVICES AHEAD TO THE SUNDAY BEFORE 
CHRISTMAS. 
 
3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE, 
400-500 ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS GATHERED IN BUON 
CUOR KNIA VILLAGE FOR AN OUTDOOR CHRISTMAS EVE VIGIL 
THAT AUTHORITIES ALLOWED TO GO ON ALL NIGHT.  (POST 
NOTE: THIS VILLAGE WAS VISITED BY CONGENOFFS DURING A 
PRE-CHRISTMAS TRIP TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.)  ON 
CHRISTMAS DAY, HOWEVER, THE TWO ETHNIC MINORITY 
MINISTERS WHO LED THE SERVICES WERE DETAINED AND HELD 
FOR FIVE DAYS.  THEIR DETENTION WAS NOT IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE CHRISTMAS SERVICE, ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCE. 
POLICE DETAINED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SUSPECTED OF 
BEING INVOLVED WITH TWELVE VILLAGERS WHO HAD ATTEMPTED 
TO CROSS THE BORDER TO CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY (SEE 
NEXT SECTION). 
 
4. (SBU) THE LEADER SAID THAT IN KRONG PA DISTRICT, DAK 
LAK PROVINCE, ABOUT 600 ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS 
GATHERED FOR AN OUTDOOR CHRISTMAS VIGIL.  ON CHRISTMAS 
DAY, HOWEVER, POLICE SUMMONED THE FEMALE MINISTER OF 
THE CONGREGATION TO THE POLICE STATION FOR SEVERAL DAYS 
OF QUESTIONING.  OUR SOURCE SPECULATED THE POLICE WERE 
DISMAYED AT THE LARGE TURNOUT AT HER CHURCH. 
 
5. (SBU) THE LEADER SAID THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY LED A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  01 OF 03  151450Z 
PRAYER CEREMONY OF ABOUT 250 PERSONS OUTSIDE HIS HOME. 
HE SAID HE WAS AWARE OF AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX OTHER 
PLACES IN DAK LAK PROVINCE WHERE PEACEFUL PRAYER 
GATHERINGS OF MORE THAN 100 PERSONS TOOK PLACE.  HE 
SAID THAT IN NUMEROUS VILLAGES IN THE PROVINCE, POLICE 
ALLOWED GROUPS OF 50 PEOPLE OR FEWER TO GATHER IN HOMES 
TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS. 
 
6. (SBU) THIS SOURCE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT IN OTHER 
VILLAGES IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, AUTHORITIES PASSED THE 
WORD THAT NO ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT CHRISTMAS 
SERVICES WOULD BE ALLOWED.  AS A RESULT, OUR SOURCE 
CLAIMED MOST ETHNIC MINORITY CHRISTIANS EITHER DID NOT 
CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS OR PRAYED QUIETLY IN THEIR HOMES. 
 
7. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID 
CHRISTMAS THERE WAS SIMILAR.  IN PLEI BRENG VILLAGE, 
NEAR THE PROVINCIAL SEAT OF PLEIKU, SOLDIERS ASSISTED 
IN ORGANIZING THE CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICES.  THIS 
SOURCE SPECULATED IT WAS LESS A MATTER OF HOLIDAY 
SPIRIT THAN A MEANS FOR MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER 
EVENTS.  HE SAID THAT IN GIA LAI\'S CHU PRONG AND CHU SE 
DISTRICTS, NO CHRISTMAS CELEBRATIONS WERE ALLOWED.

PERSONS GATHERED ON DECEMBER 24, AND WERE PREPARING TO

SUBJECT: CHRISTMAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS: TOLERANCE 
AND REPRESSION FOR ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS 
 
STAGE AN ANTI-GOVERNMENT DEMONSTRATION.  AFTER A FEW 
HOURS, POLICE AND ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT LEADERS 
PERSUADED THE PEOPLE TO RETURN TO THEIR HOMES 
PEACEFULLY.  OUR SOURCE SAID HE WITNESSED EVENTS IN DAK 
DOA PERSONALLY. 
 
9. (SBU) HE SAID THAT POLICE DETAINED AND TORTURED TWO 
PASTORS FROM CHU SE DISTRICT BY PUTTING STICKS BETWEEN 
THEIR FINGERS AND THEN SLAMMING THEIR HANDS WITH A 
BOOK.  ONE OF THE TWO, 32-YEAR-OLD R\'MAH NHUI (ALSO 
KNOWN AS AMA SOREN) FROM IA LE VILLAGE IN CHU SE 
DISTRICT, CAME TO THE LEADER\'S HOME AND SHOWED HIM HIS 
BROKEN FINGERS.  HE ASSERTED THE POLICE DID THIS 
BECAUSE THEY HEARD HE WAS PLANNING TO ORGANIZE A 
CHRISTMAS PRAYER SERVICE. 
 
10. (SBU) SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF 
TORTURE BY ELECTRIC SHOCK, THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI 
PROVINCE SAID HE WAS UNAWARE OF POLICE USING THESE 
TACTICS.  THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE, HOWEVER, 
SAID BUON CUOR KNIA POLICE BEAT UP AND SHOCKED WITH 
ELECTRIC WIRES 12 PEOPLE WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO CROSS 
INTO CAMBODIA.  BOTH LEADERS SAID POLICE -- ETHNIC 
MINORITY AS WELL AS ETHNIC VIETNAMESE KINH -- ROUTINELY 
ROUGHED UP SUSPECTS DURING DETENTION.  NEITHER SOURCE 
WAS AWARE OF ANYONE DETAINED IN CONNECTION WITH 
CHRISTMAS SERVICES WHO WAS STILL BEING HELD.

ALLEGATIONS OF KILLINGS ON THE CAMBODIAN BORDER 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
11. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS RELATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 230 
ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS ATTEMPTED TO CROSS INTO 
CAMBODIA ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  THEY CAME IN TWO GROUPS - 
ONE GROUP OF ABOUT 30 PERSONS FROM KON TUM PROVINCE; 
ANOTHER GROUP OF ABOUT 200 PERSONS FROM DAK LAK 
PROVINCE.  A GUIDE LED THEM TO A PLACE ON THE CAMBODIAN 
BORDER NEAR GIAO VILLAGE IN DAK MIL DISTRICT, DAK LAK 
PROVINCE. 
 
12. (SBU) ACCORDING TO OUR SOURCES, THE GUIDE TOLD THE 
GROUP HE WOULD LEAVE THEM AND RETURN AFTER PURCHASING A 
MOBILE PHONE IN DAK MIL TOWN.  TWO HOURS LATER, 
VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS SURROUNDED THE GROUP.  THE LEADERS, 
WHO WERE RELATING SECOND-HAND REPORTS, INSISTED THAT 
ONE GROUP OF VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS APPROACHED FROM THE 
EAST AND ANOTHER FROM THE WEST, I.E. VIETNAMESE FROM 
THE CAMBODIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER.  OUR DAK LAK SOURCE 
SAID THIS WAS CLEARLY A \"SET-UP\". 
 
13. (SBU) THIS LEADER FROM DAK LAK SAID A SECURITY 
OFFICIAL TOLD HIM THAT 186 PERSONS WERE DETAINED, BUT 
MOST WERE RETURNED TO THEIR HOME VILLAGES BY MILITARY 
VEHICLE AND RELEASED THE SAME DAY.  HE STRESSED THAT 
NONE OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE GROUP WAS 
MISTREATED, BUT ASSERTED THAT A DOZEN MEN WERE BEATEN 
AND TORTURED WITH ELECTRIC SHOCK UPON THEIR RETURN TO 
BUON CUOR KNIA. 
 
14. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID THAT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  02 OF 03  151451Z 
ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS WHO LIVE IN THE AREA TOLD HIM 
THAT NEAR TO WHERE KON TUM, GIA LAI AND THE CAMBODIAN 
PROVINCES OF RATANAKIRI AND MONDULKIRI MEET, SEVERAL 
PERSONS FROM THE GROUP BEING RETURNED TO KON TUM TRIED 
TO ESCAPE.  SOLDIERS OPENED FIRE AND KILLED FOUR 
PERSONS, ACCORDING TO THESE VILLAGERS.  IN A SEPARATE 
INCIDENT, ACCORDING TO THIS SAME LEADER, SOLDIERS SHOT 
AND MAY HAVE KILLED FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AS THEY TRIED TO 
ESCAPE BY SWIMMING ACROSS THE SRE PAK RIVER IN DAK LAK 
PROVINCE. (THE LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE DID NOT 
MENTION THESE INCIDENTS BEFORE DEPARTING.)  WHEN ASKED 
SPECIFICALLY IF HE BELIEVED IT WAS GVN POLICY TO KILL 
VILLAGERS ATTEMPTING TO CROSS INTO CAMBODIA, OUR GIA 
LAI SOURCE SAID \"NO\", BUT HE BELIEVES SOLDIERS ARE TOLD 
TO \"STOP PEOPLE FROM CROSSING,\" AND SOMETIMES \"MISTAKES 
ARE MADE.\" 
 
15. (SBU) THE LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE SAID THAT 
TWO OF THE 30 PEOPLE FROM KON TUM PROVINCE ARE STILL 
UNDER DETENTION IN A PRISON IN PLEIKU.  THEIR NAMES ARE 
HOANH AND AMA XUAN.  THREE PERSONS FROM DAK LAK ARE 
STILL BEING DETAINED, BUT HE KNEW THE NAME OF ONLY ONE 
OF THEM - RAHLAM LUA (ALSO KNOWN AS AMA DUY). 
 
\"DEGA PROTESTANTS\" VS. MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS 
--------------------------------------------- 
 

16. (SBU) BOTH LEADERS SPOKE OPENLY ABOUT THE SPLIT 
BETWEEN MAINSTREAM ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANTS IN THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND THE \"DEGA PROTESTANTS\" WHO 
ACTIVELY SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT ETHNIC MINORITY 
(\"DEGA\") STATE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  ALL OF THE 
PERSONS WHO ATTEMPTED TO CROSS THE BORDER INTO CAMBODIA 
WERE \"DEGA PROTESTANTS,\" ACCORDING TO THE LEADERS.  THE 
LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE CHARACTERIZED THE \"DEGA 
PROTESTANTS\" AS \"FALSE CHRISTIANS,\" WHO IGNORE THE 
ADVICE OF \"TRUE\" PROTESTANT PASTORS TELLING THEM NOT TO 
GO TO CAMBODIA. 
 
17. (SBU) WHEN ASKED DIRECTLY ABOUT THE REASONS FOR 
ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS TO CROSS INTO CAMBODIA, THE 
LEADER FROM GIA LAI PROVINCE DIVIDED THE GROUPS INTO 
TWO.  HE SAID HE BELIEVED THE PEOPLE WHO FLED TO 
CAMBODIA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE FEBRUARY/MARCH 2001 
UNREST WANTED TO ESCAPE GVN PERSECUTION.  BUT, HE 
BELIEVES THOSE WHO HAVE GONE TO CAMBODIA SINCE THE 
SUMMER (INCLUDING THE GROUP WHO ATTEMPTED TO CROSS ON 
CHRISTMAS DAY) WERE MOTIVATED BY PROMISES OF MONEY AND 
THE HOPE OF RESETTLEMENT IN THE U.S. HE ASSERTED THEY 
HAD \"HEARD BY TELEPHONE\" THAT SUCH OPPORTUNITIES WERE 
AVAILABLE. (NOTE: THIS ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER\'S COMMENT 
IS SIMILAR TO WHAT GVN OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TELLING US. 
END NOTE.) 
 
18. (SBU) SINCE THIS GIA LAI SOURCE WAS FAMILIAR WITH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00039  03 OF 03  151451Z 
THE MONTAGNARD FOUNDATION, WE ASKED HOW HE WOULD 
CHARACTERIZE IT.  HE RESPONDED THAT WHILE IT ADVOCATED 
HUMAN RIGHTS, THESE DAYS ITS POLITICAL AGENDA (AN 
INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE) HAD THE UPPER HAND.  WHEN ASKED 
HOW MUCH SUPPORT THERE WAS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS FOR 
AN INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE, THIS SOURCE SAID THAT WHILE 
100 PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE SUPPORTED HUMAN RIGHTS, NOT 
MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF ETHNIC MINORITIES SUPPORTED A 
SEPARATE STATE.  THIS LEADER DESCRIBED THE DEGA 
PROTESTANTS AS USING RELIGION TO FURTHER THEIR 
POLITICAL AGENDA.  WHILE EVERYONE SUPPORTS FREEDOM OF 
RELIGION AND HUMAN RIGHTS, HE SAID, MOST OF THE PEOPLE 
DO NOT SUPPORT USING THESE IDEAS TO WAGE A WAR AGAINST 
THE GOVERNMENT. 
 
DOES ANYONE HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE TRUTH? 
----------------------------------------- 
19. (SBU) WE BELIEVE OUR TWO SOURCES ARE RELIABLE AND 
PRESENTED INFORMATION THEY THOUGHT ACCURATE.  HOWEVER, 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CORROBORATE THE SECOND-HAND 
REPORTS OF KILLINGS AT THE BORDER.  WHEN ASKED IF THEY 
WOULD CHARACTERIZE WHAT HAPPENED WITH PROVINCIAL 
CHRISTMAS SERVICES AS \"NORMAL\" OR \"EXCEPTIONAL\" 
REPRESSION, THEY SAID THE WIDE RANGE OF OFFICIAL 
ACTIONS WAS \"NORMAL.\"  WHILE NEITHER LEADER SYMPATHIZED 
WITH \"DEGA\" POLITICAL AIMS, THEY WERE CLEARLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.  THEY AGREED THAT PROVINCIAL 
AUTHORITIES WANTED TO PREVENT RELIGIOUS SERVICES FROM 
TAKING A POLITICAL TURN.  BUT AS THEIR ACCOUNTS 
INDICATE, THE CHRISTMAS SITUATION VARIED FROM VILLAGE 
TO VILLAGE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS REGION.  THESE TWO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00039  03 OF 03  151451Z

THEY ACKNOWLEDGED IT IS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE OF ONE 
VILLAGE TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ANOTHER 
VILLAGE JUST ONE KILOMETER DOWN THE SAME ROAD.

1.  SUMMARY: IN A DECEMBER MEETING, THE DIRECTOR OF THE 
GIA LAI PROVINCIAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CALLED LEPROSY 
HIS MAIN PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN.  HE ALSO DISCUSSED 
OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING HIV/AIDS, AND 
AMBITIOUS PLANS TO IMPROVE THE STAFFING/FACILITIES OF 
THE PROVINCE\'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.  THIS CABLE WAS 
CLEARED WITH OUR CDC REP IN HANOI.  END SUMMARY. 
 
LEPROSY: PROGRESS, BUT ERADICATION STILL OUT OF REACH 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
2.  VIETNAM HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN BATTLING 
LEPROSY (HANSEN\'S DISEASE), REDUCING THE ANNUAL RATE OF 
NEW CASES FROM 0.64 PER 10,000 PERSONS IN 1996 TO 0.23 
NEW CASES PER 10,000 PERSONS IN 2000.  THROUGHOUT THE 
LATE 1990S, THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF KON TUM, 
GIA LAI AND DAK LAK STILL PURSUED THEIR GOAL OF 
ERADICATING LEPROSY BY THE YEAR 2000 (SEE REFTEL). 
THAT GOAL WAS NOT ACHIEVED, BUT PROVINCIAL LEADERS\' 
ADVOCACY HELPED LAUNCH A CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CAMPAIGN TO 
ERADICATE LEPROSY NATIONWIDE BY THE YEAR 2010. 
 
3.  THE INCIDENCE OF LEPROSY IS HIGHEST IN THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS AND THE REMOTE NORTHERN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS, 
WHERE IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFLICTS VIETNAM\'S ETHNIC 
MINORITY GROUPS.  ABOUT 1000 OF VIETNAM\'S 13,000 
PATIENTS WITH ACTIVE LEPROSY RESIDE IN GIA LAI 
PROVINCE.  IN A MEETING ON DECEMBER 13, DR. MANG DUNG, 
THE DIRECTOR OF THE GIA LAI PROVINCIAL DEPARTMENT OF 
HEALTH, TOLD CONGENOFFS THAT THE PROVINCE HAD REPORTED 
50 NEW CASES OF THE DISEASE IN 2000, COMPARED WITH 471 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00055  01 OF 02  220631Z 
NEW CASES IN 1994.  DR. DUNG ATTRIBUTED THE REDUCTION 
IN LEPROSY TO CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS TO 
EDUCATE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN PROPER HYGIENE AND 
CARE OF LEPROSY PATIENTS.  THE PROVINCE HAS ALSO 
REDOUBLED ITS EFFORTS TO DIAGNOSE THE DISEASE IN ITS 
EARLY STAGES AND FOLLOW UP WITH AGGRESSIVE MULTI-DRUG 
TREATMENT. 
 
4.  DR. DUNG LISTED TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA AND GOITER AS 
THE NEXT MOST SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS IN GIA LAI 
PROVINCE.  HE SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE NUMBER OF MALARIA 
CASES HAD INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR DUE TO THE 
WEATHER, THE PROVINCE HAD SEEN A 60 PERCENT REDUCTION 
IN MALARIA MORTALITY AS A RESULT OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND 
TREATMENT.  TUBERCULOSIS REMAINS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, 
WITH THE DISEASE AFFECTING THREE PERCENT OF THE 
PROVINCE\'S POPULATION.  THE GOVERNMENT REDUCED THE 
INCIDENCE OF GOITER BY FIVE PERCENT IN THE PAST YEAR, 
ACCORDING TO DR. DUNG, BY PROVIDING IODIZED SALT TO THE 
REMOTE AREAS WHERE THE DISEASE IS MOST PREVALENT.  DR. 
DUNG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE PROVINCE, 
MALNUTRITION AND INADEQUATE MATERNAL AND CHILD 
HEALTHCARE WERE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. 
 
HIGH HIV RATE, QUESTIONABLE BLOOD SUPPLY 
---------------------------------------- 
5.  SURPRISED THAT DR. DUNG HAD NOT LISTED IT AS AN 
AREA OF CONCERN, POLOFF ASKED ABOUT THE INCIDENCE OF 
HIV/AIDS IN THE PROVINCE.  DR. DUNG SAID THAT 3300 
PERSONS HAD BEEN TESTED FOR HIV IN THE PAST YEAR.  OF 
THOSE, 45 HAD TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE HIV VIRUS.  CG 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00055  01 OF 02  220631Z 
ASKED IF THE 3300 PERSONS TESTED WERE FROM HIGH-RISK 
GROUPS.  DR. DUNG REPLIED THAT THE SAMPLE POPULATION 
HAD NOT COME FROM VULNERABLE OR HIGH-RISK GROUPS; THEY 
WERE ALL PEOPLE WHO HAD UNDERGONE VARIOUS TYPES OF 
SURGERY AT PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT HOSPITALS.  AS SUCH, 
DR. DUNG SUGGESTED, THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED RANDOM 
SAMPLES.  WHEN CG ASKED HOW SAFE THE PROVINCIAL BLOOD 
SUPPLY WAS, DR. DUNG SAID HE BELIEVED IT WAS SAFE. 
WHEN PRESSED, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PROVINCE \"DOES 
NOT HAVE STATE-OF-THE-ART TESTING CAPABILITY.\" 
 
6.  COMMENT: WE WONDER IF THIS POVERTY-STRICKEN 
PROVINCE HAS THE RESOURCES TO TEST ITS BLOOD SUPPLY AT 
ALL.  WE WERE ALSO STRUCK BY DR. DUNG\'S APPARENT 
NONCHALANCE IN RELATING THE HIV STATISTICS - CDC STAFF 
FAMILIAR WITH THE TESTING PROGRAM NOTE THAT IT WAS NOT 
A RANDOM SAMPLE, AS ONLY SELECT SURGICAL PATIENTS ARE 
SCREENED (THOSE THE SURGEONS CONSIDER HIGH RISK). BUT 
EVEN WITH THIS SAMPLING BIAS, THE NUMBERS SUGGEST A 
MAJOR PROBLEM IN THE MAKING. 
 
UNFULFILLED NEEDS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
7.  DR. DUNG SAID THE PROVINCE PLANS TO CONSTRUCT A NEW 
500-BED HOSPITAL IN PLEIKU AT A COST OF VND 32 BILLION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z 
(USD 2.2 MILLION).  SPAIN HAS PLEDGED USD 3 MILLION IN 
ODA ASSISTANCE FOR EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES.  THE 
PROVINCE PLANS TO SPEND AN ADDITIONAL VND 10 BILLION 
(USD 0.7 MILLION) ON ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT.  (NOTE: THIS 
IS A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FOR THIS EXTREMELY POOR 
PROVINCE.  REFTEL REPORTED THAT FROM 1975-97, GIA LAI 
HAD BUDGETED ZERO/ZERO FUNDS FOR THE PURCHASE OF ANY 
NEW HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT.  END NOTE.) 
 
8.  DR. DUNG SAID THAT EACH OF THE PROVINCE\'S 12 
DISTRICTS BOASTS A 50- TO 100-BED HOSPITAL.  NINE OF 
THESE HOSPITALS HAVE SURGICAL CAPABILITIES.  GIA LAI 
HOPES TO BUILD SURGICAL WARDS IN THE REMAINING THREE 
DISTRICT HOSPITALS AS WELL.  IN ADDITION TO THE 
DISTRICT HOSPITALS, DR. DUNG SAID, EACH COMMUNE WITHIN 
A DISTRICT IS SERVED BY A CLINIC, AND SMALLER HEALTH 
STATIONS ARE SET UP AT THE HAMLET LEVEL. 
 
9.  DR. DUNG ADMITTED THAT RECRUITING AND RETAINING 
TRAINED STAFF AT THE COMMUNE CLINICS AND HAMLET HEALTH 
STATIONS IS PROBLEMATIC.  ONLY 17 OF THE 175 COMMUNE 
CLINICS HAVE A PHYSICIAN ON HAND.  THE PROVINCIAL 
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WANTS TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER TO 
THE 50 PERCENT LEVEL, BUT SEEMED TO LACK A SPECIFIC 
PLAN ON HOW TO ATTAIN ITS OBJECTIVE.  DR. DUNG SAID HE 
WANTED TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SCHOLARSHIPS TO STUDENTS IN 
RETURN FOR A COMMITMENT TO WORK AT THE ISOLATED RURAL 
CLINICS.  \"WE ARE LOOKING FOR INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
FOR THIS,\" HE STATED.  (NOTE: VIETNAM GRADUATES A 
SURPLUS OF PHYSICIANS.  IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, ONLY 
ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF GRADUATES END UP IN MEDICAL ROLES. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z 
MANY PURSUE CAREERS IN OTHER FIELDS, AS THEY PREFER TO 
STAY IN THE BIG CITIES RATHER THAN WORK IN REMOTE 
AREAS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE TWO EMBASSY FSN STAFF WITH 
MEDICAL DEGREES WORKING IN NON-HEALTH RELATED JOBS. 
POST ALSO KNOWS AN ETHNIC GIA RAI PHYSICIAN FROM GIA 
LAI PROVINCE WHO WORKS AS A BUSINESS CONSULTANT IN HO 
CHI MINH CITY.  HE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO HIS HOME 
VILLAGE, BUT HE WOULD NEVER COME CLOSE TO THE INCOME HE 
EARNS IN THE CITY.  END NOTE.) 
 
10.  IN RESPONSE TO CG\'S QUESTIONS, DR. DUNG NOTED THAT 
CLEAN DRINKING WATER WAS CENTRAL TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH 
OF A COMMUNITY, BUT THAT WATER SANITATION WAS THE 
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PROVINCIAL AND DISTRICT PEOPLE\'S 
COMMITTEES.  SIMILARLY, HE SAID PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION 
SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROVINCIAL SCHOOL 
CURRICULUM, BUT HIS OFFICE HAD NO INPUT INTO OR 
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION IN THE 
PROVINCE, AS THAT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11.  WHILE DR. DUNG IS VERY CONCERNED AND IS ACTUALLY 
BETTER INFORMED THAN SOME OF HIS COUNTERPARTS IN OTHER 
PROVINCES, THERE WAS NO PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH 
PROBLEMS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT.  FROM 
A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT, ADDRESSING THE CAUSES OF 
MATERNAL, INFANT AND CHILD MORTALITY RATES (IN ALL 
THREE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES) SHOULD BE A HIGHER 
PRIORITY THAN LEPROSY.  ALSO, WHILE GIA LAI PROVINCE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00055  02 OF 02  220631Z 
NEEDS A NEW HOSPITAL IN THE PROVINCIAL SEAT, THERE 
SEEMS TO BE LITTLE INVESTMENT IN PERSONNEL AND 
FACILITIES IN THE MORE REMOTE AREAS WHERE LEPROSY, 
TUBERCULOSIS AND MALARIA CONTINUE TO TAKE THEIR TOLL. 
 
12.  THE DISCUSSION WITH DR. DUNG ALSO RAISES CONCERN 
ABOUT HIV/AIDS IN GIA LAI, AND BY EXTENSION, IN THE 
REST OF THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  IN A VERY POOR PROVINCE 
WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED RESOURCES WHERE HEALTHCARE 
PROVIDERS STILL CALL THE AGE-OLD DISEASE OF LEPROSY 
THEIR MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGE, HOW CAN THEY POSSIBLY 
BATTLE A DISEASE THAT WILL REQUIRE MODERN AND EXPENSIVE 
TECHNOLOGY TO DETECT AND TREAT?    YAMAUCHI

1.  SUMMARY:  IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A TEST CASE FOR 
VIETNAM\'S MAJOR CITIES, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS 
DEVOLVED SOME SIGNIFICANT POWERS TO HO CHI MINH CITY 
WITH THE ISSUANCE OF \"DECREE 93\" BY THE OFFICE OF THE

INVESTMENT PROJECTS, HANDLE LAND ISSUES, HIRE AND FIRE 
KEY PERSONNEL, AND EVEN PRIVATIZE SOME PUBLIC SERVICES 
- ALL WITH MUCH LESS INTERFERENCE FROM HANOI.  HCMC 
AUTHORITIES SAY THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT SO MUCH 
AUTONOMY HAS BEEN GRANTED AND ARE STILL ASSESSING 
EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANS.  THEY ASSERT, HOWEVER, IT WILL 
BRING MORE EFFICIENT, TRANSPARENT, AND RESPONSIVE 
GOVERNMENT.

2. HO CHI MINH CITY AUTHORITIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY 
NEEDED APPROVALS FROM HANOI TO MAKE ALMOST ANY MAJOR 
DECISION.  THIS BEGAN TO CHANGE WHEN LAST DECEMBER THE 
OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER ISSUED \"DECREE 93.\" THE 
DECREE GRANTS SIGNIFICANT AUTONOMY TO HO CHI MINH CITY 
IN SOME AREAS.  CITY OFFICIALS HAD BEEN PUSHING FOR 
MORE LOCAL CONTROL FOR SOME TIME, BUT TO THEIR 
SURPRISE, ACCORDING TO ONE LOCAL OFFICIAL, \"WE GOT 
ABOUT 95% OF WHAT WE WERE ASKING FOR.\"  ALTHOUGH THE 
DECREE WENT INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER 27, THE CITY IS 
STILL ASSESSING HOW IT WILL IMPLEMENT ITS NEW POWERS. 
RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS WILL BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH FOR NEW 
IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS.  JUST THE SAME, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS ALREADY SEE THIS AS A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN 
THE AREA OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM.

3.  UNDER THE DECREE, THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE OF HCMC 
NOW HAS THE AUTHORITY TO HIRE AND FIRE KEY PERSONNEL, 
SUCH AS CITY DEPARTMENT HEADS.  BEFORE, SUCH DECISIONS 
HAD TO BE APPROVED BY HANOI.  NOW HCMC CAN INSTALL ITS 
OWN PEOPLE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY -- AND 
FIRE THEM IF THEY DO NOT PERFORM.  THE CITY ALSO HAS 
NEW AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL \"INCENTIVES\" TO 
RECRUIT AND RETAIN SPECIALIZED OR TECHNICAL STAFF. 
FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN NHAN HAS TOLD THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
HE WILL USE THESE INCENTIVES TO PROVIDE HIGHER SALARIES 
FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS (SEE REFTEL). 
 
4.  WHAT MAY HAVE EVEN A LARGER IMPACT, LOCAL OFFICIALS 
NOW WILL HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH, RESTRUCTURE 
OR DISSOLVE AGENCIES, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, AND 
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES (SOES) UNDER THEIR CONTROL. 
THE CITY CAN ALSO EXERCISE THE OPTION OF PRIVATIZING 
SOME OF ITS PUBLIC SERVICES. 
 
IT\'S TIME FOR YOU TO MANAGE YOUR OWN BANK ACCOUNT 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
5.  PRIOR TO DECREE 93, HANOI DETERMINED HCMC\'S BUDGET 
LINE ITEM BY LINE ITEM.  HCMC WAS UNABLE TO REDEPLOY 
THAT MONEY REGARDLESS OF HOW THE CITY PERCEIVED 
CHANGING LOCAL NEEDS.  NOW HCMC HAS GAINED VIRTUALLY 
FULL CONTROL OVER ITS ENTIRE BUDGET PROCESS. IN THE 
PAST, HANOI DETERMINED ANNUALLY THE CONTRIBUTION THAT 
HCMC MADE TO THE NATIONAL BUDGET, AND EVERY YEAR SAW AN 
INCREASE.  UNDER DECREE 93, THE AMOUNT GOING TO CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT COFFERS WILL BE SET AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL 
INCOME TAX REVENUES ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS, MAKING IT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00117  01 OF 02  050818Z 
POSSIBLE FOR HCMC TO MORE ACCURATELY FORECAST ITS 
FUTURE REVENUES.  FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS HCMC WILL BE 
ABLE TO RETAIN 24% OF ALL CORPORATE AND PERSONAL INCOME 
TAXES RAISED IN THE CITY.  HCMC WILL ALSO BE ALLOWED TO 
SEEK OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING -- SUCH AS ISSUING BONDS 
AND ASSESSING FEES FOR LOCAL SERVICES. 
 
I WANT TO BUILD SOMETHING REALLY BIG 
------------------------------------ 
6.  CITY PLANNING IS NOW, UNDER DECREE 93, ACTUALLY A 
CITY GOVERNMENT FUNCTION.  THE DECREE EXPLICITLY NOTES 
THAT LAND USE ISSUES ARE TO BE HANDLED AT THE CITY 
LEVEL.  THIS MEANS CITY AUTHORITIES CAN NOW LEASE LAND 
PLOTS OF ANY SIZE AND PAY LOCALLY-DETERMINED PRICES FOR 
LAND FOR URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT PROJECTS. 
PREVIOUSLY, ALL LAND DEALS OVER ONE HECTARE REQUIRED 
APPROVAL FROM THE PRIME MINISTER.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL 
OFFICIALS, THIS CHANGE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY SPEED UP 
THE APPROVAL PROCESS. 
 
7.  STILL, THE DECREE STATES THAT HCMC AUTHORITIES 
SHOULD SHARE PROPOSALS WITH RELEVANT CENTRAL GOVERNMENT 
MINISTRIES ON MAJOR CITY PLANNING INITIATIVES.  IF HCMC 
DOES NOT RECEIVE A REPLY WITHIN 30 DAYS, THE INITIATIVE 
IS CONSIDERED APPROVED. THIS IS A MARKED DEPARTURE FROM 
THE TRADITIONAL \"UNLESS IT IS EXPLICITLY PERMITTED, IT 
IS NOT ALLOWED\" APPROACH UTILIZED BY THE GVN. 
 
I\'LL TAKE YOUR 10 MILLION 
------------------------- 
8.  THE PROCESS OF APPROVING LARGE DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS 
ALSO HAS BEEN STREAMLINED, AND SHOULD ALLOW PROJECTS TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z 
MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY.  WITH DECREE 93, DOMESTIC 
INVESTMENT PROJECTS OVER US$10 MILLION WILL BE REVIEWED 
AT THE \"FEASIBILITY STUDY\" PHASE BY THE OFFICE OF THE 
PRIME MINISTER.  THIS ALLOWS FOR THE APPROVAL OF 
PROJECTS \"IN PRINCIPLE\" AT AN EARLY STAGE, RATHER THAN 
SUBJECTING EVERY ASPECT OF A FULLY DEVELOPED PROPOSAL 
TO CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SCRUTINY.  THE DECREE DOES NOT 
COVER FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. 
 
ANYTHING ELSE? 
-------------- 
9.  THE MOVE TO GRANT MORE AUTONOMY TO HO CHI MINH CITY 
IS A SUCCESS FOR CITY OFFICIALS WHO HAVE LONG LOBBIED 
FOR THESE CHANGES.  THEY HAVE ASSERTED THAT HCMC - 
BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND 
RATE OF GROWTH - HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE CHALLENGES. 
SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY, HANOI AGREED TO ALMOST ALL OF HO 
CHI MINH CITY OFFICIALS\' PROPOSALS.  ONLY A FEW ITEMS 
FROM THEIR INITIAL PROPOSAL WERE REJECTED: ELIMINATION 
OF ONE LAYER OF CITY GOVERNMENT; CREATION OF A SPECIAL 
HCMC TOURIST POLICE FORCE; AND THE FREEDOM TO ESTABLISH 
HCMC-SPECIFIC INVESTMENT AND FINANCE CORPORATIONS. 
(NOTE:  SEVERAL CONSULATES GENERAL IN HCMC--BRITISH, 
GERMAN, SINGAPOREAN, JAPANESE, AND U.S., AMONG OTHERS-- 
HAD URGED THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH A 
SEPARATE TOURIST POLICE, GIVEN RECENT INCREASES IN 
STREET CRIME AND THE DEATH OF A BRITISH TOURIST DURING 
A PURSE-SNATCHING ATTEMPT.  ALTHOUGH DISAPPOINTED THAT 
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT GRANT HCMC THE FUNDING 
FOR THIS ENDEAVOR, THIS WAS THE FIRST WE HAD HEARD THAT 
HCMC OFFICIALS HAD BEEN PRESSING HANOI TO INCLUDE A 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z 
SEPARATE POLICE FORCE AS PART OF THE OVERALL REFORM 
PACKAGE.) 
 
10. LOCAL OFFICIALS STATE THAT HCMC WILL CONTINUE 
PUSHING FOR THOSE CHANGES AS A PART OF FUTURE REFORMS. 
OVERALL, HOWEVER, HO CHI MINH CITY OFFICIALS WERE 
PLEASED WITH THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION SHOWN BY HANOI. 
THEY VIEW THESE NEW MANAGEMENT POWERS AS REAL, ABSOLUTE 
AND EFFECTUAL.  HO CHI MINH CITY\'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED 
USING THESE NEW MANDATES WILL BE A HARBINGER OF 
INITIATIVES TO COME THROUGHOUT THE REST OF VIETNAM. 
DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER NGUYEN CONG TAN WAS QUOTED IN THE 
LOCAL PRESS AS STATING, \"IF HCMC FULFILLS THE 
DECENTRALIZED TASKS, THE MODEL WILL BE APPLIED NATION- 
WIDE WHEN ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE 
FUTURE.\" 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11.  THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A STRONG STEP IN 
ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM BY GRANTING HO CHI MINH CITY 
POWERS THAT WOULD PROBABLY APPEAR TO MOST OF US AS 
TYPICAL CITY GOVERNMENT FUNCTIONS, BUT NOT IN VIETNAM. 
WHAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN, HOWEVER, IS HOW BOTH HANOI AND 
HCMC DEFINE, IN PRACTICE, THIS NEW RELATIONSHIP.  ONE 
CITY OFFICIAL NOTED THAT EVEN WITH ITS NEW POWERS \"IN 
REALITY, WE WILL STILL ASK FOR ADVICE FROM HANOI ON 
MAJOR PROJECTS.\"  HCMC WILL RECEIVE A GREAT DEAL OF 
SCRUTINY IN THIS PILOT PHASE OF DEVOLUTION, BOTH FROM 
HANOI AS WELL AS FROM OTHER LARGE CITIES SUCH AS DANANG 
AND CAN THO WHICH WILL SEEK SIMILAR INDEPENDENCE.  WILL 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00117  02 OF 02  050818Z 
THESE NEW POWERS MAKE THE CITY MORE RESPONSIVE, 
EFFICIENT, AND ACCOUNTABLE?  THE SIGNS ARE POSITIVE. 
DECREE 93 FOLLOWS A SERIES OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE 
REFORMS THAT HAVE STREAMLINED INVESTMENT AND OTHER 
LICENSING PROCEDURES HERE IN HCMC -- AND ARE ONE REASON 
HCMC GENERATES SO MUCH OF VIETNAM\'S INVESTMENT AND 
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: AN ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM GIA 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00131  01 OF 02  080617Z 
LAI PROVINCE RECENTLY DESCRIBED TO POLOFF A COMPLEX WEB 
OF SHIFTING LOCAL ALLIANCES AMONG THE ETHNIC GROUPS IN 
VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  MIXING RELIGION WITH 
POLITICS, IT INCLUDES STRONG CONNECTIONS TO ETHNIC 
MINORITY EXILES IN THE U.S.  ANOTHER ETHNIC MINORITY 
LEADER FROM DAK LAK PROVINCE SAID THAT DIFFERENCES OF 
OPINION CONCERNING MINORITY PERSONS FROM THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS SEEKING REFUGE IN CAMBODIA HAS MADE THE SPLIT 
BETWEEN THE \"DEGA PROTESTANTS\" AND MAINSTREAM 
PROTESTANTS IN THE AREA MORE RANCOROUS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM GIA LAI 
PROVINCE ESTIMATED 30 PERCENT OF ETHNIC MINORITY PEOPLE 
(\"MONTAGNARDS\") IN GIA LAI PROVINCE SUPPORT THE NOTION 
OF AN AUTONOMOUS \"DEGA (ETHNIC MINORITY) STATE\" IN THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  AMONG THIS 30 PERCENT, HOWEVER, 
THERE ARE SERIOUS DIVISIONS. 
 
3. (SBU) WHAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER TERMED \"THE 
POLITICAL GROUP\" IS LARGELY SUPPORTIVE OF KOK K\'SOR, 
CURRENTLY RESIDING IN SOUTH CAROLINA.  KOK K\'SOR 
PROCLAIMED HIMSELF PRESIDENT-IN-EXILE OF AN INDEPENDENT 
DEGA STATE IN SEPTEMBER 2000.  WHAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY 
LEADER TERMED \"THE RELIGIOUS GROUP\" SUPPORTS K\'SOR, 
INSOFAR AS HE PROMOTES PROTESTANTISM AS THE DEGA STATE 
RELIGION.  A THIRD GROUP, WHICH HE SAID IS NEITHER 
POLITICAL NOR RELIGIOUS, IS COMPOSED OF \"OPPORTUNISTS\" 
WHO USE PROMISES OF DEGA AUTONOMY OR INDEPENDENCE TO 
BUILD THEIR PERSONAL FIEFDOMS.  THIS THIRD GROUP WOULD 
BE UNIMPORTANT, ACCORDING TO THE ETHNIC MINORITY 
LEADER, EXCEPT THAT THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

PERSUADING PEOPLE TO DEPART VIETNAM FOR UNHCR CAMPS IN 
CAMBODIA -- OFTEN PROMISING RESETTLEMENT TO THE U.S. 
 
4. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER CONFIRMED THAT THE 
TOP ORGANIZER OF THE \"POLITICAL GROUP\" WAS A PERSON 
NAMED JANA YBONR (ALSO KNOWN AS BOME) WHO WAS CONVICTED 
OF DESTABILIZING PUBLIC SECURITY AND SENTENCED TO 12 
YEARS\' IMPRISONMENT IN SEPTEMBER (SEE REFTELS).  HE 
SAID SEVEN PERSONS STILL FORM THE CORE LEADERSHIP OF 
THE POLITICAL GROUP, AND THAT ALL SEVEN  STILL RESIDE 
IN VIETNAM.  THE CURRENT HEAD OF THE GROUP IS A WOMAN 
NAMED H\'JIP (ALSO KNOWN AS AMI SARA).  HE SAID SHE 
RESIDES IN PHU NHUON DISTRICT OF GIA LAI PROVINCE, BUT 
RECENTLY WENT INTO HIDING IN DAK LAK PROVINCE AND IS A 
FUGITIVE FROM VIETNAMESE POLICE.  (NOTE: THE ETHNIC 
MINORITY LEADER EXPLAINED THAT AMONG THE EDE AND GIA 
RAI MINORITY GROUPS, ADULTS USUALLY CARRY AT LEAST TWO 
NAMES - THEIR BIRTH-NAME AND THE NAME THEY ACQUIRE UPON 
THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST CHILD.  FOR EXAMPLE, AMI SARA 
MEANS \"MOTHER OF SARA,\" AND AMA CHAM MEANS \"FATHER OF 
CHAM.\"  END NOTE.) 
 
5. (SBU) THE HEAD OF THE \"RELIGIOUS GROUP,\" ACCORDING 
TO THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER, IS AMA CHAM, WHO 
CURRENTLY RESIDES AT ONE OF THE UNHCR CAMPS IN 
CAMBODIA.  THE MINORITY LEADER SAID THAT MOST OF THE 
ORGANIZERS OF THE RELIGIOUS GROUP HAVE GONE TO 
CAMBODIA.  HE SAID THIS GROUP OF \"DEGA PROTESTANTS\" 
SPLIT FROM THE MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS (WHO MOSTLY FOLLOW MISSIONARIES AND PASTORS 
OF THE CHRISTIAN AND MISSIONARY ALLIANCE OR CMA) TO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00131  01 OF 02  080617Z 
SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE LED BY KOK K\'SOR. 
RECENTLY, HOWEVER, THE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS 
\"ARGUE AND FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES.\"  THE DEGA 
PROTESTANTS INSIST THAT PROTESTANTISM MUST BE THE STATE 
RELIGION, AND ALL CITIZENS OF A DEGA STATE MUST BE 
PROTESTANT, ACCORDING TO THIS ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER. 
MEANWHILE, THE POLITICAL GROUP WANTS AND NEEDS A 
BROADER BASE OF SUPPORT. 
 
6. (SBU) THE ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER SAID THAT SIMILAR 
DIVISIONS EXIST WITHIN THE MONTAGNARD COMMUNITY IN THE 
UNITED STATES.  THERE ARE THOSE WHO SUPPORT AN 
INDEPENDENT DEGA STATE, AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO DESIRE 
ONLY TO ADVOCATE FOR BETTER TREATMENT OF ETHNIC 
MINORITIES IN VIETNAM.  AMONG THOSE WHO SUPPORT AN 
INDEPENDENT STATE ARE BOTH THOSE WHO ACCEPT KOK K\'SOR 
AS HEAD OF A GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE AND THOSE WHO REJECT 
HIM.  AMONG K\'SOR SUPPORTERS ARE THOSE WHO SEEK BROAD- 
BASED SUPPORT AND THOSE WHO SEEK PARTICIPATION LIMITED 
ONLY TO BAPTIZED PROTESTANTS.  (NOTE: THE LEADER SAID 
HE IS AWARE OF THESE DIVISIONS WITHIN THE U.S.-BASED 
COMMUNITY THROUGH FREQUENT PHONE CONVERSATIONS WITH 
RELATIVES IN THE U.S.  END NOTE.) 
 
7. (SBU) ANOTHER ETHNIC MINORITY LEADER FROM DAK LAK 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00131  02 OF 02  080617Z 
PROVINCE TOLD POLOFF THAT SINCE THE GVN RECOGNIZED THE 
SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM IN APRIL 2001, 
PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAVE SOUGHT OUT MAINSTREAM 
PROTESTANT PASTORS TO HELP MAINTAIN ORDER WITHIN THE 
ETHNIC MINORITY COMMUNITIES.  THIS ETHNIC MINORITY 
LEADER, WHO IS HIMSELF AN ORDAINED PROTESTANT PASTOR, 
SAID THAT MAINSTREAM PASTORS ARE WILLING TO COOPERATE 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THEY TELL THEIR CONGREGATIONS NOT 
TO RUN TO CAMBODIA.  IN CONTRAST, DEGA PASTORS EXHORT 
THEIR FOLLOWERS TO CROSS THE BORDER TO UNHCR CAMPS. 
THE SPLIT BETWEEN DEGA PROTESTANTS AND MAINSTREAM 
PROTESTANTS HAS BECOME MORE ACRIMONIOUS OVER THIS 
ISSUE, HE ASSERTED. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT: ANY MOVES TOWARD AN INDEPENDENT DEGA 
STATE IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS WOULD BE STRONGLY 
RESISTED BY THE GVN.  IN NUMEROUS PUBLIC STATEMENTS AND 
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS, VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS STRESS THE 
IMPORTANCE OF STABILITY AND UNITY.  THE SEVERAL 
MINORITY LEADERS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL WANT BETTER 
TREATMENT FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES IN VIETNAM.  BUT WHEN 
RELIGION MIXES WITH \"SEPARATIST\" POLITICAL GOALS, THE 
GVN SEES ONLY THE PROBLEM OF ENSURING STABILITY AND 
POLITICAL UNITY -- NOT A QUESTION OF RELIGIOUS BELIEF.

SUBJECT:  STATE ENTERPRISES GROW, FDI FLOPS IN CAN THO 
 
 
1.  SUMMARY: CAN THO, THE MEKONG DELTA\'S ECONOMIC AND 
COMMERCIAL HUB, IS HUNGRY FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT, SAY LOCAL 
OFFICIALS, BUT THE CITY\'S POOR TRANSPORTATION LINKS AND 
STRING OF FAILED FOREIGN PROJECTS SUGGEST REAL DIFFICULTIES 
IN DEVELOPING AN ECONOMY BASED ON FDI.  THE PROVINCE SEEMS 
TO HAVE FOUND EASIER SUCCESS WITH STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES 
(SOES) IN GENERATING EXPORT AND OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH. 
WHETHER RELIANCE ON SOES WILL RESULT IN SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 
IS OPEN TO QUESTION. 
 
STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH 
---------------------- 
2.  CAN THO PROVINCE, WITH A THRIVING SEAFOOD INDUSTRY AND A 
STRONG AGRICULTURAL BASE, IS THE ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL 
CENTER OF THE MEKONG DELTA. OFFICIAL GVN STATISTICS, WHICH 
ARE PROBABLY INFLATED, POINT TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AVERAGING 8% 
OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS, REACHING AN IMPRESSIVE 9.65% IN 2001. 
EVEN IF THESE NUMBERS ARE OPTIMISTIC, CAN THO IS 
EXPERIENCING STRONG, STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH.  BASED ON A 
VISIT BY CONGENOFFS TO THE PROVINCE LATE LAST YEAR AND IN 
SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND BUSINESS 
PEOPLE, IT APPEARS THAT CAN THO IS COUNTING ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES 
(SOES) TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GROWING. 
 
BUT ALMOST NO FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
-------------------------------- 
3.  THIS GROWTH HAS NOT BEEN DUE TO FOREIGN DIRECT 
INVESTMENT (FDI), WHICH HAS BEEN DISMAL.  TOTAL IMPLEMENTED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00154  01 OF 02  210957Z 
FOREIGN CAPITAL AMOUNTS TO ONLY ABOUT $55 MILLION FOR THE 
ENTIRE PROVINCE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.  THIS COMPARES TO 
MORE THAN $4.8 BILLION FOR HO CHI MINH CITY DURING THE SAME 
PERIOD. 
 
4.  TOURING THE SLEEPY TRA NOC INDUSTRIAL ZONE JUST OUTSIDE 
CAN THO CITY, CONGENOFFS SAW VEGETABLES GROWING ON LAND 
WHERE IT WAS HOPED THAT FOREIGN COMPANIES WOULD BUILD 
PRODUCTION FACILITIES. TO BE FAIR, LOCAL OFFICIALS CLAIM 
THAT THE THREE INDUSTRIAL PARKS IN THE PROVINCE EMPLOY ABOUT 
10,000 PEOPLE, AND A THAI-OWNED SEAFOOD PROCESSING PLANT AND 
A TAIWAN-INVESTED NAIL FACTORY WERE LOCATED IN THE IZ.  MORE 
NOTEWORTHY, HOWEVER, WERE THE WIDE-OPEN SPACES. 
 
5.  WHEN CONGENOFFS POINTED OUT ONE GLEAMING BUILDING IN THE 
PARK AND ASKED WHAT IT WAS, THE DIRECTOR OF THE AUTHORITY 
GRIMLY REPORTED THAT IT WAS A CUBAN-INVESTED RAT POISON 
FACTORY THAT HAD NOT PAID ITS RENT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND 
A HALF.  HE WENT ON TO STATE THAT DUE TO CUTS IN THE COST OF 
LAND RENTS AT THE IZ, THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR MANAGING THE SITE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO EFFECTIVELY 
ADVERTISE AND MARKET TO PROSPECTIVE TENANTS. 
 
POOR TRANSPORT MAY IMPROVE A BIT 
-------------------------------- 
6.  ONE PROBLEM IN ATTRACTING FDI HAS PROBABLY BEEN CAN 
THO\'S POOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE PROVINCE HAS 
NO AIR OR RAIL SERVICE.  TRAVELING BY ROAD FROM HCMC TAKES 
3.5 TO 4 HOURS AND REQUIRES A FERRY CROSSING.  THE ROAD IS 
FILLED WITH EVERY KIND OF CONVEYANCE IMAGINABLE, AND BRIDGES 
POP UP EVERY MILE OR SO, AND THEIR ABRUPT SLOPES UP AND DOWN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00154  01 OF 02  210957Z 
MAKE FOR A BOUNCY - OR BONE JARRING - RIDE DEPENDING ON YOUR 
POINT OF VIEW.  PORT FACILITIES ARE ALSO LACKING.  THE RIVER 
CHANNELS AND LOCAL PORTS CAN ONLY ACCOMMODATE SHIPS OF UP TO 
10,000 TONS, WHICH LIMITS WHAT CAN BE CHEAPLY SHIPPED IN AND 
OUT OF THE CITY.  MOST OF THE SEAFOOD AND AGRICULTURAL 
PRODUCTS ARE NOW TRUCKED UP OR FLOATED UP ON SMALLER BARGES 
TO HCMC WHERE THEY ARE THEN TRANSFERRED TO OCEAN-GOING 
VESSELS. 
 
7.  PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, POINT OUT THAT WITH 
SEVERAL PROJECTS UNDERWAY, TRANSPORT LINKS ARE IMPROVING. 
JAPAN IS FINANCING A $400 MILLION BRIDGE TO SPAN THE HAU 
RIVER, WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A FERRY CROSSING ON 
THE ROAD TO HCMC.  THE BRIDGE SHOULD BE COMPLETED IN 2006. 
LOCAL OFFICIALS STATE THAT CIVIL AIR SERVICE WILL START UP 
AGAIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THIS YEAR, BUT ONLY WITH 
FLIGHTS TO/FROM HANOI.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE WORLD BANK IS 
FINANCING MOST OF AN $80 MILLION PROJECT TO EXPAND PORT 
FACILITIES AND WIDEN THE RIVER CHANNEL TO ALLOW LARGER BOATS 
TO REACH CAN THO. 
 
WHERE ARE ALL THE FOREIGN INVESTORS? 
------------------------------------ 
8.  TRANSPORTATION IS NOT CAN THO\'S ONLY PROBLEM.  THE 
PROVINCE HAS FACED A RUN OF BAD LUCK - WHICH SOME WOULD SAY 
IS SELF-INFLICTED - WHEN IT COMES TO ATTRACTING FDI.  OF 
COURSE, CAN THO HAS HAD SOME SUCCESSES WITH FOREIGN 
INVESTORS, INCLUDING AMERICAN ONES.  AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL 
GROUP OPENED AN OFFICE THERE LAST YEAR, AND THEY CLAIM IT 
HAS BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL.  CARGILL ALSO HAS A SMALL FEED 
MILL HERE.  BUT SOME OF THE PROVINCE\'S FAILURES HAVE BEEN 
SPECTACULAR.  ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS IS THE NOW DEFUNCT 
AMERICAN RICE, WHICH PRODUCED INSTANT RICE FOR EXPORT. 
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BATTLING WITH ITS LOCAL PARTNER, THE 
FIRM FOLDED IN 1998. THE COMPANY\'S EXPERIENCE IN CAN THO HAS 
BEEN WRITTEN UP IN A CASE STUDY THAT IS USED IN BUSINESS 
SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  CAN THO MADE THE NEWS 
AGAIN IN 1999 WHEN PEPSI SIGNED A LEASE TO BUILD A NEW 
BOTTLING PLANT AT THAT SAME SLEEPY INDUSTRIAL ZONE OUTSIDE 
THE CITY.  AFTER PEPSI BEGAN PURCHASING EQUIPMENT AND MAKING 
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE LAND, ITS BUSINESS LICENSE WAS 
SUSPENDED, APPARENTLY TO BENEFIT A WELL-CONNECTED LOCAL 
BOTTLING CONCERN.  PEPSI NEVER BUILT THE PLANT. 
 
9.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT FDI IN MEETINGS WITH CONGENOFFS, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SEEMED TO DWELL ON THE PROVERBIAL \"ONE THAT GOT 
AWAY\" (WHICH VARIED FROM INTERLOCUTOR TO INTERLOCUTOR): 
 
--THE AMERICAN COMPANY THAT PROMISED TO TURN LANDFILL 
GARBAGE INTO FERTILIZER - AND DID NOTHING, 
 
-- A PROPOSED BELGIAN PRESSED WOOD PLANT THAT NEVER GOT OFF 
THE GROUND, 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00154  02 OF 02  210957Z 
 
--A FRENCH FOOD PROCESSING COMPANY THAT NEVER ACTUALLY 
FOLLOWED THROUGH ON PLANS TO START A PROJECT HERE, AND ETC. 
 
THE OFFICIALS APPEARED CONFUSED ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THIS FROM 
HAPPENING AGAIN. 
 
SOES TO THE RESCUE! 
------------------- 
10.  OFFICIALS SEEMED MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT 
SEVERAL PROJECTS WITH SOE\'S TO STIMULATE EXPORT GROWTH. 
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND INVESTMENT, THE 
PROVINCE IS TRYING TO LURE VINATEX, THE COUNTRY\'S STATE- 
OWNED TEXTILE CONGLOMERATE, TO OPEN TEXTILE PRODUCTION IN 
THE PROVINCE AS WELL AS WORK WITH LOCAL FARMERS TO RAISE 
COTTON IN LIEU OF \"LESS EFFICIENT CROPS.\"  VINAMILK, ANOTHER 
SOE, IS ALSO WORKING WITH FARMERS TO RAISE DAIRY COWS TO 
SUPPLY A LOCAL MILK FACTORY.  SONG HAU FARM, THE HIGHEST 
GROSSING AND MOST PRODUCTIVE STATE-OWNED FARM IN THE 
COUNTRY, EMPLOYS MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE AND PRODUCES A 
VARIETY OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS FOR EXPORT AND LOCAL 
MARKETS. 
 
11.  ONE OF CAN THO\'S MOST NOTABLE SUCCESS STORIES IS THE 
SEAFOOD PROCESSOR CAFATEX, WHICH IS AN SOE OWNED BY CAN THO 
PROVINCE.  THIS YEAR THE COMPANY PLANS TO PRODUCE 10,000 
TONS OF SHRIMP AND 3,000 TONS OF FISH FOR PRIMARY MARKETS 
INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN.  THE COMPANY 
CURRENTLY EMPLOYS OVER 5,000 PEOPLE AND IS EXPANDING.

------- 
12.  ALTHOUGH CAN THO HAS BEEN ABLE TO TURN IN A ROBUST 
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, IT IS UNLIKELY 
TO CONTINUE THIS LEVEL OF GROWTH WITHOUT INCREASING FDI. 
PLANNED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS MAY OFFER ADDITIONAL 
INCENTIVES, BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THEY WILL BE 
SUFFICIENT TO DRAW INVESTMENT TO CAN THO.  THERE ARE SOME 
KNOWLEDGEABLE, CAN-DO OFFICIALS, BUT THEY ARE SCATTERED 
THROUGHOUT SLOW-MOVING DEPARTMENTS WITH FEW RESOURCES AT 
THEIR DISPOSAL.  AT LEAST FOR NOW, THE OVERALL LOCAL 
LEADERSHIP SEEMS TO BE WAITING FOR FDI TO COME COURTING CAN 
THO, RATHER THAN REALIZING THAT THERE IS LOTS OF COMPETITION 
THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST ASIA REGION FOR THE FDI DOLLAR.  AS 
A RESULT, THE MEKONG DELTA\'S POTENTIAL TO ATTRACT FOREIGN 
INVESTORS GOES LARGELY UNNOTICED AND UNTAPPED.

1. (U) SUMMARY:  DURING A MARCH 1-3 TRIP TO THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS, CONGENOFFS MET WITH VILLAGERS IN TWO DAK LAK 
COMMUNITIES AND VISITED A PROTESTANT WORSHIP HOUSE IN ONE 
OF THE COMMUNITIES.  SEVERAL OF THE VILLAGERS WERE ETHNIC 
MINORITY VIETNAMESE RETURNEES FROM CAMBODIA -- TWO OF WHOM 
HAD RETURNED ON THEIR OWN, PRIOR TO UNHCR REPATRIATION. 
ONE FAMILY HAD BEEN TURNED BACK TO VIETNAM AT THE BORDER. 
NONE CLAIMED ANY MISTREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF VIETNAMESE 
AUTHORITIES UPON THEIR RETURN, THOUGH ONE SAID OTHER 
VILLAGERS HAD TAUNTED HER.  THERE WAS ONE DETAILED 
COMPLAINT ABOUT A LAND DISPUTE.  BECAUSE THE VILLAGERS DID 
NOT SPEAK MUCH VIETNAMESE, CONGENOFFS HAD TO RELY ON THE 
VILLAGE CHIEF AND A VILLAGE INTERPRETER TO HELP WITH 
TRANSLATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE RETURNEE WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD 
 
2.  (U) IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, CG EMI LYNN YAMAUCHI AND FSN 
POL/ECON ASSISTANT MET WITH Y THAT, AN ETHNIC MNONG BHER 
MALE.  HE HAD RETURNED TO YUN YUH VILLAGE ON FEBRUARY 16, 
2001, WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM UNHCR (WHOSE FIRST GROUP OF 
REPATRIATES TO VIETNAM RETURNED ON FEBRUARY 19).  THE 
VILLAGE CHIEF AND ANOTHER VILLAGER WHOSE RELATIVES WERE 
STILL IN CAMBODIA ALSO ATTENDED THIS MEETING. 
 
3. (SBU) ACCORDING TO Y THAT, HE WAS \"LURED AWAY BY BAD 
PEOPLE\" AND CROSSED THE BORDER TO CAMBODIA, 15 KM AWAY. 
THE \"BAD PERSON\'S\" NAME WAS MA CHEL.  HE HAD LEFT HIS 
COFFEE FIELDS, WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN BEHIND. Y THAT STAYED 
IN THE MONDOLKIRI CAMP, BUT AS FAR AS HE KNEW, HIS CAMP HAD 
RECEIVED NO VISITORS FROM VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, OR THE U.S. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00203  01 OF 03  041656Z 
NOW THAT HE WAS BACK IN YUN YUH, HE WAS HAPPY.  HIS FRIENDS 
CAME TO VISIT HIM AND HE WAS TREATED WELL UPON HIS RETURN. 
Y THAT SPORTED A CRISPLY-IRONED, PINK SHORT-SLEEVED SHIRT, 
KHAKI SHORTS, AND NUMEROUS TATTOOS ON HIS FOREARMS.  HE 
OFFERED TO SHOW CONGENOFFS HIS HOME, WHICH WAS MODEST, BUT 
FULL OF \"FRIENDS\".  THE COFFEE TABLE FEATURED FAMILY PHOTOS 
UNDER THE GLASS TOP. 
 
4. (U) Y SER, THE VILLAGE CHIEF SINCE 1987, RESPONDED TO 
QUESTIONS FROM THE CG.  HE STATED THAT ECONOMIC AND LIVING 
STANDARDS HAD BEEN IMPROVING IN YUN YUH UNTIL AROUND 1999. 
THE VILLAGE MAINLY CULTIVATES COFFEE AND HAS NOT STARTED TO 
DIVERSIFY ITS CROPS.  IT HAS A POPULATION OF 811, OF WHOM 
\"750 ARE BELIEVERS WHO HAVE THEIR OWN WORSHIP HOUSE\". 
THERE IS NO RESIDENT PASTOR, WHICH IS WHY THEIR WORSHIP 
HOUSE CANNOT BE CALLED A CHURCH.  THE VILLAGE HAD HAD A 
PEACEFUL, \"NORMAL\" CHRISTMAS, WITH LARGE ATTENDANCE AT THE 
WORSHIP HOUSE SERVICES. 
 
5. (U) ACCORDING TO VILLAGE CHIEF Y SER, 64 VILLAGERS - 
INCLUDING ENTIRE FAMILIES - HAD LEFT YUN YUH LAST SPRING. 
HE DISCOVERED THIS WHEN PEOPLE DID NOT SHOW UP FOR WORSHIP 
SERVICES AND FROM \"CAMBODIAN TRADERS WHO HAD TOLD (HIM) 
THEY HAD SEEN SOME OF (HIS) PEOPLE OVER IN CAMBODIA.\"  Y 
SER SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO HINT OF PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THEIR 
DEPARTURE.  WHILE HE HAD HEARD THAT OTHER VILLAGES \"HAD 
LOST\" PEOPLE, HE BELIEVED HIS VILLAGE HAD LOST THE MOST. 
YUN YUH VILLAGE HAS ELECTRICITY AND IRRIGATION.  THERE IS 
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WITH INSTRUCTION IN VIETNAMESE BY 
VIETNAMESE KINH TEACHERS.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00203  01 OF 03  041656Z 
6. (U) CONOFFS HAD SPLIT OFF FROM THE CG AND DPO, AND WERE 
FOLLOWED BY FOUR \"VILLAGERS\" WHO REMAINED WITH THEM FOR THE 
TWO-HOUR VISIT.  ALTHOUGH THE FOUR MEN APPEARED TO BE 
VILLAGERS, IT SEEMED THEY MIGHT ALSO VILLAGE SECURITY 
OFFICERS.  IN RESPONSE TO CONOFFS\' QUESTIONS ABOUT 
RELIGIOUS PRACTICE, THESE VILLAGERS SAID THEY WERE 
PROTESTANTS.  BASED ON SUBSEQUENT INTERACTION, CONOFFS SAW 
NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT.  WHEN CONOFFS ASKED TO SEE THEIR 
PLACE OF WORSHIP, THEY WERE LED TO A BARN-LIKE STRUCTURE 
CONTAINING 24 BENCHES, AN ALTAR WITH A SIMPLE CROSS, BIBLES 
IN THE LOCAL DIALECT, AND CHRISTIAN SONGBOOKS.  THE 
VILLAGERS EXPLAINED THAT 120 HOUSEHOLDS WERE PROTESTANT. 
SEVEN HUNDRED WORSHIPPERS ATTENDED SERVICES EVERY SUNDAY; 
14 HOUSEHOLDS WERE CATHOLIC AND TRAVELED TO A NEARBY TOWN 
TO ATTEND SERVICES.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT CHRISTMAS 2001, THE 
VILLAGERS SAID THERE WERE \"NO PROBLEMS.\" 
 
\"I\'M PRETTY SURE I MADE IT TO CAMBODIA\" 
 
7. (U) ALSO IN DAK LAK PROVINCE, CONGENOFFS VISITED BUON 
SUT M\'GRU VILLAGE, COMPRISED OF ETHNIC EDE AND VIETNAMESE 
KINH.  ACCORDING TO THE VILLAGE CHIEF OF 27 YEARS, MA HONG, 
NINE PEOPLE WERE TURNED BACK AT THE CAMBODIAN BORDER BY 
VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS.  ONE GROUP WAS A DIVORCED WOMAN AND 
HER CHILD; THE OTHER GROUP WAS A WIFE (WHOSE HUSBAND HAD 
ALREADY GONE TO CAMBODIA) AND HER FIVE CHILDREN.  THE SUT 
M\'GRU VILLAGE CHIEF SAID THERE HAD BEEN NO BEATINGS, NO 
VIOLENCE AT THE BORDER.  HE SAID HE FELT SORRY FOR THE 
RETURNEES, WHO HAD \"BEEN LURED AWAY BY BAD PEOPLE.\"  DURING 
HIS TENURE AS VILLAGE CHIEF, THE POPULATION HAD INCREASED 
FROM 300 TO THE CURRENT 1001.  SUT M\'GRU HAS BEEN 
ELECTRIFIED SINCE 1994.  IT HAS AN ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR 
HIGH SCHOOL WITH VIETNAMESE KINH AND EDE TEACHERS.  MA HONG 
EXPECTS THE ETHNIC MINORITY LANGUAGE BILINGUAL PROGRAM TO 
BEGIN NEXT YEAR.  MOST VILLAGERS FOLLOW TRADITIONAL TRIBAL 
PRACTICES OF WORSHIPPING THE GODS OF WATER, GOOD HARVESTS, 
ETC.  MA HONG NOTED THAT WHILE THERE WERE \"JUST A FEW 
PROTESTANT HOUSEHOLDS,\" THEY WORSHIPPED AT HOME. 
 
8. (SBU) DPO SPOKE THROUGH A VILLAGE INTERPRETER WITH AN 
EDE WOMAN WHO SAID SHE HAD TRIED TO GET TO THE CAMPS IN 
CAMBODIA, BUT HAD GOTTEN LOST ON THE WAY.  THE CONVERSATION 
- TRANSLATED FROM EDE TO VIETNAMESE AND THEN ENGLISH - TOOK 
PLACE IN A COMFORTABLE, LARGE WOODEN HOUSE WHERE THE WOMAN, 
WHO IS ONE OF TWELVE CHILDREN, WAS SURROUNDED BY FAMILY 
MEMBERS.  THE WOMAN\'S NAME WAS A MI THOI.  SHE SAID SHE 
WENT TO CAMBODIA BECAUSE A \"BAD PERSON\" HAD TOLD HER THAT 
IF SHE COULD JUST GET ACROSS THE BORDER, SHE WOULD BE GIVEN 
MONEY AND THE CHANCE TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE IN A NEW 
COUNTRY.  SHE SAID SHE CROSSED INTO CAMBODIA BUT COULD NOT 
FIND THE CAMPS.  AFTER SPENDING TWO WEEKS IN THE WOODS, SHE 
RETURNED TO SUT M\'GRU.  A MI THOI SAID SHE WAS ON HER OWN 
THE WHOLE TIME, EXCEPT FOR HER 6-YEAR OLD SON, WHOM SHE HAD 
TAKEN WITH HER.  SHE SAID SHE WAS DIVORCED AND A 
PROTESTANT, BUT DID NOT INDICATE THIS WAS A FACTOR IN HER 
DECISION TO LEAVE THE VILLAGE FOR CAMBODIA.  DPO LATER 
LEARNED A MI THOI HAD NO EDUCATION, SINCE HER FAMILY HAD 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00203  02 OF 03  041657Z 
BEEN TOO POOR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. 
 
9. (SBU) A MI THOI REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT HER FAMILY 
HAD WELCOMED HER BACK AND THAT SHE WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE 
WITH THEM AGAIN.  STILL, SHE APPEARED QUITE SAD.  SHE SAID 
HER FAMILY AND THE WHOLE VILLAGE HAD HELPED HER SINCE HER 
RETURN.  ASKED FOR SPECIFICS, SHE SAID HER FAMILY HAD GIVEN 
HER A HOUSE OF HER OWN.  THE ONLY PROBLEM SHE MENTIONED WAS 
RELATED TO A FEW \"BAD VILLAGE OFFICIALS\" WHO THOUGHT SHE 
WAS RICH BECAUSE OF HER NEW HOUSE AND WERE CAUSING HER 
DIFFICULTIES.  A MI THOI DID NOT SEEM AFRAID TO SPEAK UP 
AND ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS AT LENGTH AND WITH EMOTION. 
DPO BELIEVES THE VILLAGE INTERPRETER PROBABLY SUMMARIZED 
ANSWERS RATHER THAN TRANSLATING ALL THE DETAILS, BUT 
GENERALLY PROVIDED AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF A YOUNG WOMAN 
LEADING A VERY DIFFICULT LIFE WHO DECIDED TO TRY FOR 
SOMETHING BETTER AND FAILED. 
 
UNSCRUPULOUS LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND LAND CONFISCATION? 
 
10. (U) CG (ACCOMPANIED BY FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT AND 
VILLAGE CHIEF MA HONG) VISITED THE WIFE (WHOSE HUSBAND HAD 
ALREADY GONE TO CAMBODIA) AND HER FIVE CHILDREN.  THE 
HUSBAND\'S NAME IS Y-DHEC EBAN.  THE WIFE\'S NAME IS H\'DRO 
ADUONG.  ACCORDING TO THE WIFE, HER HUSBAND LEFT FOR 
CAMBODIA LAST AUTUMN.  THE TIMELINE IS UNCLEAR, BUT SOME 
TIME LATER, THE FAMILY CAME HOME ONE NIGHT TO FIND THE 
ELECTRICITY CUT OFF.  UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT, THEY 
DECIDED TO TRY TO FOLLOW THEIR FATHER TO CAMBODIA, BUT WERE 
TURNED BACK AT THE BORDER.  H\'DRO ADUONG GREW MORE RETICENT 
AT THIS POINT, EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARED THE VILLAGE CHIEF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00203  02 OF 03  041657Z 
WAS REASSURING HER IN THEIR NATIVE EDE LANGUAGE. 
 
11. (SBU) THE FAMILY\'S ELDEST DAUGHTER HOWEVER, WHO 
APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 20-YEARS OLD, WAS FIDGETING AND 
CLEARLY ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING.  SHE HAD ENGAGED IN A 
RUNNING DISCUSSION WITH HER MOTHER IN ETHNIC EDE SINCE THE 
CG\'S ARRIVAL.  SHE SAID HER NAME WAS A ME PHIAN.  IN 
RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, SHE CLAIMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN LAND 
PROBLEMS WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OVER THE LAST 20 
MONTHS.  AFTER RUMMAGING IN A CUPBOARD, SHE PRODUCED COPIES 
OF LEGAL DOCUMENTS SEEKING RETURN OF LAND THAT HER FATHER 
(Y-DHEC EBAN) CLAIMED THE VILLAGE CHIEF AND CU SUE COMMUNE 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HAD UNLAWFULLY CONFISCATED AND SOLD FOR 
THEIR OWN PROFIT.  A SEPARATE DOCUMENT WAS A LETTER OF 
COMPLAINT TO THE VILLAGE POLICE, ALLEGING THAT BECAUSE OF 
THE LAND DISPUTE, SIX OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS HAD 
COME TO BEAT Y-DHEK EBAN\'S WIFE.  THEY INJURED HER SO BADLY 
THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL HOSPITAL FOR 
EMERGENCY TREATMENT.  BOTH DOCUMENTS INDICATE THE 
PETITIONER (Y-DHEK EBAN) HAD PRESENTED HIS CASE SEVERAL 
TIMES TO THE COMMUNE COMMITTEE. 
 
12. (SBU) WHEN CG LATER ASKED A PROVINCIAL OFFICIAL WHETHER 
SHE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE CASE, THE OFFICIAL RESPONDED YES. 
ACCORDING TO THIS OFFICIAL, THE FAMILY IS RIGHT ON CERTAIN 
POINTS, BUT WRONG ON OTHERS.  THEN THE OFFICIAL VOLUNTEERED 
RETURNED ON THEIR OWN AND SOME WHO NEVER MADE IT ACROSS 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00203  03 OF 03  041657Z 
THAT THE ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND 
LAWS AND REGULATIONS - \"EVEN THOSE THAT GIVE THEM GREATER 
PRIVILEGES AND BENEFITS THAT THE REST OF US (VIETNAMESE 
KINH) DO NOT HAVE.\" 
 
13. (SBU) RETURNING TO THE ELDEST DAUGHTER A ME PHIAN, SHE 
SAID THE FAMILY HAD DEPARTED ON DECEMBER 24 FOR THE 
CAMBODIAN BORDER.  SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN WHEN THEY HAD 
RETURNED, BUT THE VILLAGE CHIEF RECKONED IT WAS 8-9 DAYS 
AFTER THAT.  CG ASKED HOW THE FAMILY HAD BEEN TREATED SINCE 
THEIR RETURN.  A ME PHIAN RESPONDED WITH A NEUTRAL SHRUG, 
BUT COMPLAINED THAT SOME DRUNKEN VILLAGERS HAD TAUNTED AND 
SCARED THE FAMILY LATE ONE NIGHT.  THE VILLAGE CHIEF THEN 
INTERRUPTED TO SAY THAT THE POLICE RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY 
AND TOOK THE ROWDIES TO THE COMMUNE STATION AND TOLD THEM 
NOT TO DO IT AGAIN.  A ME PHIAN DID NOT CONTRADICT THIS. 
ASKED IF THE BROKEN CLOCK WITH A THREE-DIMENSIONAL PICTURE 
OF THE LAST SUPPER MEANT THE FAMILY WAS PROTESTANT OR 
CATHOLIC, SHE REPLIED THEY WERE PROTESTANT.  SHE GAVE NO 
INDICATION THAT SHE THOUGHT THIS HAD PLAYED A ROLE IN 
EITHER THE LAND OR BORDER-CROSSING ISSUES. 
 
14. (SBU) COMMENT: A ME PHIAN\'S FEARLESSNESS IN PRESENTING 
US THE LAND DOCUMENTS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE VILLAGE CHIEF 
(WHO MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE \"CORRUPT LOCAL 
OFFICIALS\" REFERRED TO IN THE WRITTEN ALLEGATIONS) WAS 
IMPRESSIVE.  SHE HAD RECEIVED NO SCHOOOLING, AND IN FACT, 
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION AMONG THE RETURNEES WE MET 
WAS FOURTH GRADE.  EVEN THE VILLAGE CHIEF TOLD US THAT HIS 
IDEA OF \"FAR AWAY\" WAS ANYTHING BEYOND 60 METERS.  DAK LAK 
MARKED THE FIRST TIME WE HAD HEARD A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  SIX WEEKS AFTER THEIR UNHCR REPATRIATION 
AND THE ONSET OF REALITY, ETHNIC MINORITY RETURNEES HAVE 
OPENLY ARTICULATED THEIR REASONS FOR LEAVING VIETNAM FOR 
CAMBODIA - LACK OF FARMLAND, AND TO A SOMEWHAT LESSER 
EXTENT, RELIGION.  ALL SIX OF THE UNHCR RETURNEES WE SPOKE 
TO ON A RECENT TRIP TO KON TUM PROVINCE ASKED FOR UNHCR TO 
BEGIN ITS FOLLOW-UP MONITORING OF THEIR SITUATIONS AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE.  TWO SAID THEY LIVED IN FEAR.  THE ONE 
\"SPONTANEOUS, VOLUNTARY RETURNEE\" WE SPOKE TO CLEARLY 
REGRETTED HIS DECISION TO RETURN TO GIA LAI PROVINCE. 
ANOTHER VILLAGER WHO \"HAD THOUGHT ABOUT\" LEAVING FOR 
CAMBODIA CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS 
ARRESTED FOR TRYING TO CROSS THE BORDER AND BEATEN.  YET 
ANOTHER VILLAGER SAID SHE HOPED HER HUSBAND, A HOUSE CHURCH 
PREACHER, WOULD NOT RETURN BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS. 
WHILE SOME PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS SEEMED SENSITIVE TO LAND 
ISSUES AND TENSIONS BETWEEN ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE 
VIETNAMESE KINH MAJORITY, THE LACK OF RESOURCES, AN 
UNIMAGINATIVE BUREAUCRACY, AND WEAK POLITICAL DIRECTION HAVE 
HAMPERED EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THIS MESSAGE 
PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE SAME TRIP DISCUSSED 
BY AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT IN REFTEL A.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS VISITED THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF KON TUM AND GIA LAI, MARCH 30 THROUGH 
APRIL 1.  PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES CONCEDED VIRTUALLY 
UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THE UNHCR RETURNEES IN KON TUM.  IN RAC 
VILLAGE, THE AMBASSADOR MET WITH SIX OF THE 15 UNHCR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00336  01 OF 02  060300Z 
RETURNEES - TWO OF WHOM HAD MET WITH CONGENOFFS BACK ON 
MARCH 1.  THIS TIME THEIR STORY WAS DIFFERENT.  ACCORDING TO 
THESE VILLAGERS, THEY FACED DISCRIMINATION AND INTIMIDATION 
AFTER THEIR RETURN.  LAND PROBLEMS WERE NOW SEEMINGLY 
INTRACTABLE -- UNFERTILE LAND IN ROCKY SOIL ON STEEP HILLS 
AT BEST; LAND THE VILLAGERS HAD HAD TAKEN AWAY BY VILLAGE 
AUTHORITIES TO ESTABLISH NEW ECONOMIC ZONES OR GIVEN TO 
RECENT VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS AT WORST.  KON TUM OFFICIALS 
ACKNOWLEDGED THEY WERE TWO YEARS BEHIND IN PROVIDING LAND 
COMPENSATION FOR SOME VILLAGES, BUT SAID THEY HAD ALREADY 
RESETTLED SEVERAL VILLAGES IN NEW LOCATIONS, BUILT STURDY 
HOUSES AND ALLOCATED VIABLE FARMLAND. 
 
3. (SBU) SPEAKING OPENLY IN FRONT OF DISTRICT/VILLAGE 
LEADERS, LOCAL MEDIA, AND OTHER VILLAGERS, ONE 24-YEAR OLD 
UNHCR RETURNEE STATED THAT LAND PROBLEMS WERE AT THE HEART 
OF HIS DISCONTENT.  EVEN WITH SOME FELLOW VILLAGERS 
EXPRESSING DISAGREEMENT AND TRYING TO SHUSH HIM UP, THIS 
RETURNEE WAS DEFIANT: \"I WANT MY FRIENDS TO COME UP HERE AND 
LISTEN BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH.  THEY 
CAN ALSO SHARE THEIR OPINIONS.  I DO NOT WANT THEM TO 
COMPLAIN LATER THAT I HAVE SAID TOO MUCH. . . . .MY LAND WAS 
NOT FERTILE AND MY LIVELIHOOD WAS TOO UNSTABLE.\"  HE SAID 
SINCE HIS FEBRUARY 19 RETURN AFTER FIVE MONTHS IN A CAMP, HE 
HAS NOT HAD ANY LAND TO FARM. 
 
4. (SBU) TWO OTHER UNHCR RETURNEES (ONE WHO HAD BEEN SICK 
WHEN CONGENOFFS VISITED ON MARCH 1, AND THE SECOND VERY 
UNCOMMUNICATIVE THE FIRST TIME AROUND) NODDED IN AGREEMENT. 
ALL THREE ARE PROTESTANTS.  ONE MENTIONED RELIGION AS A 
PROBLEM, BUT IN A RATHER CONVOLUTED WAY:  \"MY LAND WAS NOT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00336  01 OF 02  060300Z 
PRODUCING MUCH, OTHER THINGS WERE GOING WRONG IN MY LIFE 
WITH MONEY AND MY COW AND CHICKENS DIED, SO I PRAYED TO THE 
TRADITIONAL DEITIES.\" 
 
5.  (SBU) A LATECOMER TO THE GROUP, HOWEVER, EXPLICITLY 
STATED THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE FLED TO CAMBODIA IF HE HAD NOT 
FEARED BEING ARRESTED BECAUSE HE WAS A RECENT CONVERT TO 
PROTESTANTISM. 
 
6. (SBU) NONE OF THESE UNHCR RETURNEES EXPECTED ANY MORE OF 
THE 39 VILLAGERS WHO HAD LEFT FOR CAMBODIA TO RETURN - NOR 
WOULD THEY ENCOURAGE THEM TO, INCLUDING ONE RETURNEE WHOSE 
SON IS STILL IN MONDOLKIRI CAMP.  TWO RETURNEES WHO HAD 
COMPLETED SOME SCHOOLING SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD THEIR THREE 
OPTIONS ON REPATRIATION AND MADE A CHOICE TO RETURN TO 
VIETNAM.  TWO YOUNGER RETURNEES WITH NO/NO SCHOOLING - WHILE 
ACKNOWLEDGING THEY WANTED TO RETURN TO VIETNAM - SAID THEY 
DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE THREE OPTIONS, NOR THE PAPER THEY 
WERE ASKED TO SIGN IN THE CAMP. 
 
7. (SBU) TWO RETURNEES GAVE LETTERS TO THE AMBASSADOR FOR 
TRANSMITTAL TO UNHCR, IN WHICH THEY CLAIMED DISCRIMINATION 
AND INTIMIDATION.  THEY PLEADED WITH UNHCR TO START THEIR 
FOLLOW-UP MONITORING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  \"YES, YOU MUST 
COME VISIT OUR VILLAGE AGAIN,\" ALL SIX RETURNEES URGED 
CONGENOFFS.\" 
 
8. (SBU) VISITING PUIH VILLAGE IN GIA LAI PROVINCE, THE 
AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS MET WITH A VARIETY OF VILLAGERS. 
THE \"SPONTANEOUS\" VOLUNTARY RETURNEE WAS QUIET AND NOT READY 
TO ANSWER TOO MANY QUESTIONS.  HE HAD RETURNED WITH 29 
OTHERS JUST ONE WEEK AGO.  HE SAID HE HAD PARTICIPATED IN 
THE FEBRUARY 2001 DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST AUTHORITIES WHO HAD 
TAKEN HIS LAND.  ACCORDING TO HIM, VILLAGE OFFICIALS 
DEMANDED 200-300 SQUARE METERS FROM CERTAIN VILLAGERS (\"NOT 
EVERYBODY, JUST SOME\") FOR A PURPORTED COFFEE PLANTATION 
THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE EMPLOYMENT FOR THE ETHNIC 
MINORITIES.  IN FACT, THE LAND WENT TO \"OTHER (VIETNAMESE 
KINH) INDIVIDUALS.\"  ANOTHER VILLAGER SAID HE HAD THOUGHT 
ABOUT GOING TO CAMBODIA HIMSELF, BUT CHANGED HIS MIND AFTER 
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS ARRESTED LEAVING THE VILLAGE FOR THE 
BORDER AND WAS BEATEN.  YET A THIRD VILLAGER DESCRIBED HOW 
HER HUSBAND, A HOUSE CHURCH PREACHER, HAD BEEN DETAINED AND 
BEATEN FOR A WEEK.  AFTER HIS RELEASE, HE DECIDED TO GO TO 
CAMBODIA.  THE WIFE DOES NOT EXPECT HIM TO RETURN, NOR DOES 
SHE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE SAFE IN ANY CASE. 
 
9. (SBU) CONVERSATIONS AT BOTH VILLAGES WERE MARKED BY SOME 
UNEASE, BUT ALSO FRANKNESS AND COURAGE.  SOCIAL TENSIONS 
BETWEEN THE ETHNIC MINORITIES AND THE VIETNAMESE KINH, THE 
INFLUX OF VIETNAMESE KINH MIGRANTS FROM THE NORTH, 
SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE AND PRACTICING PLANTATION 
AGRICULTURE ON OVERWORKED AND SHRINKING PARCELS OF LAND HAVE 
MADE THE ALREADY HAND-TO-MOUTH EXISTENCE OF THE VILLAGERS 
EVEN MORE UNBEARABLE.  COMPARED TO BARELY A MONTH AGO,

SUBJECT: CROSSES, CADRES, AND CONVERSATIONS IN THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  PLAIN WHITE CROSSES DREW THE 
ATTENTION OF CONGEN OFFICERS AS WE DROVE THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLAND PROVINCE OF DAK LAK. A COFFEE BREAK IN 
NHAN CO COMMUNE IN DAK LAP DISTRICT ALLOWED FOR CASUAL 
CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL OF THE VILLAGERS.  LOCAL 
SECURITY OFFICERS KEPT INSERTING THEMSELVES INTO OUR 
CONVERSATIONS, BUT THE VILLAGERS PAID THEM NO MIND. 
BACK ON THE ROAD, OUR \"ESCORTS\" KEPT PACE ALMOST UNTIL 
THE PROVINCIAL BORDER. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) CG, CONOFF AND FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT DROVE BACK 
TO HO CHI MINH CITY FROM DAK LAK\'S CAPITAL CITY, BUON 
ME THUOT, ON THE NEW HIGHWAY 14.  LARGE, PLAIN WHITE 
CROSSES OVER THE DOORWAYS OF SEVERAL HOUSES ON THE NEW 
HIGHWAY DREW OUR ATTENTION. 
3. (SBU) CONGENOFFS STOPPED AT A COFFEE STALL NEXT TO A 
HOUSE WITH A WHITE CROSS OVER THE ENTRY, IN WHICH 
CATHOLIC RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE 
THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND DOORWAY.  THE OWNER OF THE 
COFFEE STALL GREETED US IN RUSTY ENGLISH, SAYING HE HAD 
LEARNED THE LANGUAGE FROM HIS \"MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS IN 
THE PAST.\"  HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALSO THE OWNER OF 
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR. (NOTE: IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00390  01 OF 02  160854Z 
IN VIETNAMESE, THE MAN\'S ACCENT SUGGESTED HE ORIGINALLY 
CAME FROM NORTHERN VIETNAM, AND MOVED SOUTH DURING THE 
1954 MASS INTERNAL MIGRATION. HIS REMARKS INDICATED 
THAT HE MIGHT HAVE WORKED FOR THE U.S. MILITARY OR AN 
AMERICAN BUSINESS BEFORE 1975.) 
 
4. (U) CONVERSATION WAS INTERRUPTED WHEN THREE MEN 
ARRIVED BY MOTORBIKE AND SAT DOWN AT THE CAFE\'S OTHER 
TABLE.  THE CAFE OWNER IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WAIT ON THE 
NEWCOMERS, ASKING IF THEY \"HAD COME ON BUSINESS.\"  THE 
MEN REPLIED THEY WERE JUST STOPPING FOR COFFEE, BUT IT 
WAS CLEAR THEY WERE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY OFFICIALS 
MONITORING THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGNERS IN THEIR COMMUNE. 
THE CAFE OWNER JOINED THE MEN AT THEIR TABLE, BUT DID 
NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PRESENCE.  HE DIRECTED 
OCCASIONAL COMMENTS TOWARD CG FROM THE OTHER TABLE.  HE 
WAS DELIGHTED WHEN CONOFF ASKED TO TAKE PHOTOS OF HIS 
HOUSE AND THE CROSS. 
 
5. (SBU) CONGEN GROUP PROCEEDED FURTHER UP THE ROAD AND 
WAS INVITED INTO AN EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLE REPAIR SHOP 
WITH A CROSS OVER ITS DOORWAY. THE OWNERS WERE A MIDDLE- 
AGED COUPLE WITH 10 GROWN CHILDREN. THEY OPENLY 
DISPLAYED LARGE POSTERS OF POPE JOHN PAUL II, AN ALTAR 
WITH THE VIRGIN MARY, AND STATUES OF SEVERAL SAINTS 
SURROUNDED BY CANDLES.  THE WIFE SAID THE FAMILY WAS 
CATHOLIC AND ATTENDED A CHURCH 80 KILOMETERS AWAY.  THE 
COUPLE SAID THAT THERE WAS A PROTESTANT CHURCH ABOUT 
NINE KILOMETERS AWAY, LOCATED OFF THE MAIN HIGHWAY. 
THE FAMILY MOVED TO NHAN CO COMMUNE SEVEN YEARS EARLIER 
WHEN THE AREA WAS MUCH MORE SPARSELY SETTLED.  FROM 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00390  01 OF 02  160854Z 
BUON ME THUOT SEVEN YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF TOUGH ECONOMIC 
CONDITIONS???, BUT THE WIFE NOTED LIFE IN NHAN CO 
COMMUNE WAS WORSE.  SHE CITING DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES, 
THE WIFE MADE AN OPEN PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE TO THE 
COMMUNE - CLOTHING, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, ETC.  ABOUT TEN 
MINUTES INTO THAT CONVERSATION, A MAN ENTERED THE SHOP- 
CUM-HOUSE AND SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITHOUT SAYING A 
WORD.  THE COUPLE DID NOT INTRODUCE THE NEWCOMER, NOR 
DID THE MAN GREET CONGENOFFS.  HE APPEARED TO BE 
ANOTHER NON-UNIFORMED SECURITY OFFICER, CHECKING UP ON 
OUR ACTIVITIES IN THE VILLAGE. 
 
6. (U) CONGENOFFS RETURNED TO THEIR VEHICLES AND 
CONTINUED DOWN HIGHWAY 14, FOLLOWED BY A CAR THAT HAD 
BEEN PARKED IN THE VILLAGE. ABOUT 40 MINUTES LATER, 
WHEN CONGENOFFS STOPPED FOR LUNCH, THE THREE MEN IN THE 
CAR FOLLOWED US INTO THE RESTAURANT AND MAINTAINED 
THEIR WATCH THROUGHOUT THE MEAL.  IT WAS OBVIOUS THEY 
WERE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY OFFICERS WHEN THEY HEADED 
FOR THEIR CAR AFTER WATCHING US PAY THE BILL.  WHAT 
THEY DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT WE PLANNED TO EAT A 
WATERMELON WE HAD PURCHASED EARLIER FOR DESSERT.  WHEN 
THE SECURITY OFFICERS NOTICED WE HAD NOT LEFT THE 
RESTAURANT RIGHT AFTER THEM, THEY HAD TO SEND ONE MAN 
BACK ON THE PRETEXT OF NOT HAVING FINISHED DRINKING ALL 
HIS SODA.  BUT AFTER CONFIRMING CONGENOFFS HAD FINISHED 
DESSERT, GOTTEN INTO THEIR VAN, AND WERE DRIVING TOWARD 
THE BORDER (ONLY TWO MILES AWAY), THE OFFICIALS DID NOT 
FOLLOW. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT: A NOT-VERY-SUBTLE, BUT NOT-TOO- 
INTRUSIVE PRESENCE OF PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY IS A 
REGULAR PART OF CONGEN VISITS TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. 
BY STOPPING ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT IN NHAN CO 
COMMUNE, CONGENOFFS WERE STRUCK BY THE OPENNESS OF 
CATHOLICISM (WHICH IS A RECOGNIZED RELIGION IN VIETNAM) 
AND THE VILLAGERS\' NONCHALANCE TOWARD THE LOCAL 
SECURITY PRESENCE. 
 
8. (SBU) AT THE SAME TIME, WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE 
DEPTH OF SECURITY RESOURCES -- EVEN IN REMOTE NHAN CO 
COMMUNE.  THREE DIFFERENT THREE DIFFERENT VEHICLES 
FOLLOWED US AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE THREE-HOUR 
DRIVE THROUGH DAK LAK PROVINCE.  SEVEN DIFFERENT 
PLAINCLOTHES OFFICERS (NOT COUNTING THE SOLDIERS WHO 
CRUISED UP AND DOWN HIGHWAY 14, DOING U-TURNS TO 
ALTERNATELY FOLLOW US OR PASS US GOING THE OPPOSITE

PAGE 03        HO CHI  00390  02 OF 02  160854Z 
WAY) MADE THEIR APPEARANCES AT THE COFFEE STALL, REPAIR 
SHOP, AND LUNCH RESTAURANT.  THE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY 
DID NOT OVERTLY INTERFERE IN ANY WAY.  IN FACT A COUPLE 
OF THEM SEEMED DOWNRIGHT SHEEPISH AS THEY EAVESDROPPED 
ON SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH VILLAGERS.  WHAT IS 
CLEAR, HOWEVER, IS THAT SOMEBODY - EITHER THE GVN OR 
THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES - WILL SPARE NO EXPENSE OR 
MANPOWER IN KEEPING TABS ON CONGEN MOVEMENTS IN THE 
CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.   YAMAUCHI

SUBJECT: EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE IN THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS OF VIETNAM 
 
REF: HCMC 0032 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY: AN EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE PACKED THE 
COMPOUND OF A 90-YEAR-OLD WOODEN CHURCH WITH THOUSANDS 
OF ETHNIC MINORITY CATHOLIC WORSHIPPERS FROM VILLAGES 
IN KON TUM PROVINCE IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS. 
THE TWO-HOUR SERVICE, CONDUCTED ENTIRELY IN ETHNIC 
LANGUAGES, INCORPORATED TRIBAL MUSIC AND DANCE. 
AFTERWARDS, DURING A CONVERSATION WITH THE AMBASSADOR 
IN THE PRESENCE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE PLAINCLOTHES 
SECURITY OFFICERS, THE CHURCH\'S PRIEST WAS RELUCTANT TO 
ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF WORSHIPPERS IN ATTENDANCE.  POST 
ESTIMATES THAT UPWARDS OF 10,000 PERSONS WERE PRESENT 
TO FREELY EXERCISE THEIR FAITH.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) AMBASSADOR, CG, CONOFF, FSN POL/ECON ASSISTANT 
AND THE AMBASSADOR\'S INTERPRETER ATTENDED THE EASTER 
SUNRISE SERVICE AT KON TUM\'S \"NHA THO GO\" OR \"WOODEN 
CHURCH\".  CONGEN HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT THE SERVICE 
WOULD LIKELY BE WELL-ATTENDED.  SHOULD THE NUMBER OF 
WORSHIPPERS OVERFLOW THE SANCTUARY, PEOPLE WOULD BE 
ACCOMMODATED IN AREAS IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE CHURCH 
BUILDING.  ARRIVING AT THE CHURCH, CONGENOFFS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00394  01 OF 02  171252Z 
DISCOVERED THAT THE \"OVERFLOW\" AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN 
10,000 WORSHIPPERS.  THE CHURCH COMPOUND WAS NOT 
CAPABLE OF HOLDING ALL ATTENDEES AND THE SPILLOVER 
CROWD BLOCKED THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH, CAUSING 
DIFFICULTY FOR PASSING VEHICLES. (COMMENT: POST\'S 
ESTIMATE OF 10,000-PLUS PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH COMPOUND 
IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ROWS IN A SECTION MULTIPLIED 
BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN EACH ROW.) 
 
3. (U) FATHER LIEN THANH NGUYEN, AN ETHNIC VIETNAMESE 
KINH ORIGINALLY FROM NORTHERN VIETNAM, LED THE WORSHIP 
PRIMARILY IN THE BA NA LANGUAGE, WITH PORTIONS IN THE 
SEDANG LANGUAGE.  FOLLOWING THE ORDER OF SERVICE, 
WORSHIPPERS DECKED IN TRADITIONAL, COLORFUL DRESS 
ALTERNATED STANDING AND SITTING ON THE GROUND OR ON 
STRAW MATS.  THE MUSICAL INTERLUDES WERE PROVIDED BY 
ETHNIC MINORITY MUSICIANS USING TRADITIONAL INSTRUMENTS 
(WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ORGAN).  GIRLS IN BRIGHTLY- 
WOVEN NATIVE DRESS PERFORMED DANCES, ACCOMPANIED BY 
HIGHLAND GONGS.  MIDWAY THROUGH THE SERVICE, THE BISHOP 
OF KON TUM ARRIVED TO CELEBRATE THE EUCHARIST. 
 
4. (U) COMMUNION WAS SERVED TO THE ENTIRE CROWD BY AN 
ESTIMATED 30 WHITE-ROBED PRIESTS FROM LOCAL CHURCHES. 
THROUGHOUT THE CROWD, ORDERLY LINES CIRCLED AROUND 
THOSE SERVING THE COMMUNION WAFER.  COMMUNION ITSELF 
LASTED 25 MINUTES. 
 
5. (SBU) SOME ATTENDEES CARRIED SMALL BOOKS IN THEIR 
ETHNIC LANGUAGE, APPARENTLY EITHER PRAYER OR SONG 
BOOKS.  FEW CELEBRANTS SPOKE VIETNAMESE.  WORSHIPPERS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00394  01 OF 02  171252Z 
SMILED AND WERE SHYLY CURIOUS ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF 
FOREIGNERS/AMERICANS AT THE SERVICE.  LOCAL VIETNAMESE 
MEDIA CARRYING STILL AND VIDEO CAMERAS DOCUMENTED THE 
SERVICE.  PLAINCLOTHES POLICE WERE ALSO IN ATTENDANCE 
AND MONITORED THE CROWD FROM THE BACK, BUT AT NO TIME 
INTERFERED WITH THE SERVICE.  (NOTE: POST BELIEVES SOME 
OF THE LOCAL MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES WERE ACTUALLY 
SECURITY AGENTS AS WELL.  WHEN CONOFF TRIED TO TAKE 
PHOTOS TO DOCUMENT THE \"MEDIA\'S\" PRESENCE, THEY AVERTED 
THEIR FACES.) 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  AFTER THE SERVICE, FATHER LIEN 
INDICATED THAT CROWDS OF THIS SIZE - OR LARGER - ARE 
ROUTINE ON IMPORTANT DAYS IN THE CATHOLIC CALENDAR. 
ONE OF THE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY AGENTS FOLLOWED THE 
AMBASSADOR AND CONGENOFFS INTO THE RECTORY, STAYED A 
DISCREET DISTANCE AWAY, AND DID NOT OVERTLY INTERFERE 
WITH CONVERSATION.  FATHER LIEN, HOWEVER, SEEMED TO 
DOWNPLAY THE NUMBERS SEEN THAT EASTER SUNDAY.  STILL, 
CONGENOFFS WERE IMPRESSED BY THE NATURALNESS OF BOTH 
THE SETTING AND THE CONGREGATION DURING THE SUNRISE 
SERVICE.  NOBODY LOOKED FEARFUL OR FURTIVE.  IT WAS A 
STRIKING EXAMPLE OF HOW \"FREE\" RELIGION CAN BE IN 
VIETNAM - AS LONG AS IT IS A LEGALLY RECOGNIZED 
RELIGION.  THE LARGE, PEACEFUL CROWD - WHILE MONITORED 
BY PLAINCLOTHES POLICE - WAS LEFT TO PRACTICE THEIR 
FAITH OPENLY.  THE SHEER NUMBERS, THE RESPECT FOR 
ETHNIC MINORITY CULTURE, AND THE QUIET INTENT OF EACH 
BELIEVER AS HE/SHE LISTENED TO A MASS CELEBRATED IN TWO 
ETHNIC LANGUAGES WAS MOVING.    YAMAUCHI

FULL GOSPEL ASSEMBLIES OF GOD (AOG) IN VIETNAM SAID HE WOULD 
WELCOME GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION OF THE GROUP, BUT EXPECTED IT 
TO REMAIN AN \"UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION\" FOR YEARS TO COME. 
THE GOVERNMENT STILL \"REPRESSES\" THE AOG, HE CLAIMED, BUT NO 
LONGER IMPRISONS AOG BELIEVERS OR PASTORS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
\"SOPHISTICATED REPRESSION\" IN THE NORTH 
--------------------------------------- 
2. (SBU) REVEREND DUONG THANH LAM, GENERAL SUPERINTENDENT 
FOR THE FULL GOSPEL ASSEMBLIES OF GOD (AOG) IN VIETNAM MET 
WITH POLOFF ON APRIL 15, THE FIRST CONTACT MISSION HAS HAD 
WITH THE AOG LEADER.  [NOTE: MISSION\'S ONLY PREVIOUS CONTACT 
WITH THE AOG OCCURRED WHEN POLICE DETAINED REVEREND TRAN 
DINH \"PAUL\" AI IN MID-1999 FOR TAKING PART IN A BIBLE 
MEETING IN HANOI.  MISSION LATER ASSISTED AI IN OBTAINING A 
RELIGIOUS WORKER (R) VISA, WHICH HE AND HIS FAMILY USED TO 
TRAVEL TO THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 1999 (SEE REFTELS).] 
 
3. (SBU) LAM SAID HE HAS SERVED AS AOG GENERAL 
SUPERINTENDENT SINCE 1997.  HE STATED THAT HE HAS ONLY 30 
PASTORS (10 OF WHOM ARE ORDAINED, THE OTHER 20 FULLY TRAINED 
BUT NOT YET ORDAINED) TO MINISTER TO 22,000 AOG FOLLOWERS IN 
VIETNAM.  HE SAID THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF AOG 
FOLLOWERS (COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 800,000 PROTESTANT 
BELIEVERS NATIONWIDE) WAS DUE TO SEVERE REPRESSION OF THE 
AOG AFTER 1975.  HE SAID THE CHURCH REORGANIZED ITSELF IN 
1989, AND HAS SINCE BEEN GROWING RAPIDLY.  MOST OF THE 
GROUP\'S 225 HOUSE CHURCHES ARE IN HCMC.  THE NEXT LARGEST 
CONCENTRATION OF AOG WORSHIPPERS IS AMONG THE K\'HO AND EDE 
ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS IN LAM DONG AND DAK LAK PROVINCES IN 
THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF THAI, H\'MONG 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00400  01 OF 02  190630Z 
AND OTHER ETHNIC MINORITY PERSONS PARTICIPATE IN AOG HOUSE 
CHURCH SERVICES IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES BORDERING CHINA. 
 
4. (SBU) LAM SAID HIS GROUP FACES ITS SEVEREST PERSECUTION 
IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES.  HE SINGLED OUT LAI CHAU AND LANG 
SON PROVINCES AS THE MOST REPRESSIVE.  IN SOME VILLAGES IN 
LAI CHAU, LAM ASSERTED, NON-UNIFORMED SECURITY PERSONNEL 
STAY IN CHRISTIAN HOMES TO PREVENT THEM FROM CARRYING OUT 
WORSHIP SERVICES.  POLICE SUMMON FOR QUESTIONING PERSONS 
SUSPECTED OF ORGANIZING HOUSE CHURCH SERVICES ON AN ALMOST 
DAILY BASIS.  DISTRICT OFFICIALS ALLEGEDLY ORGANIZE MEETINGS 
WHERE AOG FOLLOWERS ARE COERCED INTO SIGNING DOCUMENTS 
PLEDGING TO ABANDON CHRISTIANITY.  LAM MENTIONED THAT THOSE 
WHO RENOUNCE THEIR FAITH SOMETIMES DRINK ANIMAL BLOOD, BUT 
NOTED THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE AMONG CERTAIN ETHNIC GROUPS. 
THE ACT IN THIS CONTEXT DEMONSTRATES A RETURN TO TRADITIONAL 
BELIEFS AND PRACTICES. 
 
5. (SBU) LAM GAVE POLOFF A COPY OF A DOCUMENT PURPORTEDLY 
USED FOR RENUNCIATION IN DIEN BIEN PHU IN LAI CHAU PROVINCE. 
THE SIGNATORY AGREES TO FIVE CONDITIONS, THE THIRD OF WHICH 
TRANSLATES AS FOLLOWS: \"WE WILL NOT FOLLOW ANY RELIGION, WE 
WILL NOT READ THE BIBLE, WE WILL NOT SING RELIGIOUS SONGS, 
AND WE WILL NOT GATHER IN A GROUP TO PRAY WITHOUT THE 
PERMISSION OF COMPETENT AUTHORITIES.\"  ACCORDING TO LAM, 
SINCE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES NEVER GIVE PERMISSION, 
SIGNING THE DOCUMENT AMOUNTS TO A RENUNCIATION OF FAITH. 
 
6. (SBU) LAM SAID THAT UNTIL TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, POLICE 
IN THE NORTHERN PROVINCES OFTEN BEAT OR IMPRISONED AOG 
PASTORS AND BELIEVERS, BUT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO AOG 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00400  01 OF 02  190630Z 
PASTORS OR BELIEVERS IMPRISONED.  OFFICIALS USE \"OTHER MEANS 
OF INTIMIDATION.\"  HOUSEHOLDERS WHO REFUSE TO RECANT THEIR 
FAITH MAY LOSE THEIR JOBS, OR THEIR CHILDREN MAY BE 
FORBIDDEN TO ATTEND SCHOOL.  THEY MAY HAVE THEIR PROPERTY 
CONFISCATED, OR BE OSTRACIZED IN THEIR OWN VILLAGE.  LAM 
WORRIED THAT THIS \"SOPHISTICATED REPRESSION\" WAS MORE 
EFFECTIVE THAN PHYSICAL ABUSE OR IMPRISONMENT. 
 
MORE TOLERANCE IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
--------------------------------------- 
7. (SBU) LAM SAID CONDITIONS FOR ETHNIC MINORITY AOG 
BELIEVERS HAVE IMPROVED IN THE LAM DONG AND DAK LAK 
PROVINCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, SINCE THE ETHNIC UNREST 
LAST FEBRUARY.  MANY H\'MONG FAMILIES FROM LANG SON PROVINCE 
IN THE NORTH HAVE MIGRATED TO DAK LAK.  LAM ADMITTED 
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WAS A STRONG MAGNET FOR MIGRATION, BUT 
INSISTED GREATER RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT 
REASON FOR MOVING TO THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS.  OTHER 
PROTESTANT CONTACTS HAVE NOTED THAT H\'MONG AND OTHER 
NORTHERN ETHNIC MINORITIES, WHO HAVE MIGRATED TO DAK LAK, 
LAM DONG AND BINH PHUOC PROVINCES, SAY THEY FACE LESS 
RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THAN THEY DID IN THE NORTH. 
 
8. (SBU) BUT THE AOG ALSO FACES PROBLEMS IN THE FAR SOUTH. 
LAM CLAIMED THAT DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL, TIEN GIANG 
PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA BROADCAST A TELEVISION SPOT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00400  02 OF 02  190631Z 
THAT CALLED THE AOG A \"COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY RELIGION OF THE 
UNITED STATES,\" AND CALLED ON PEOPLE TO REPORT AOG MEMBERS 
OR ACTIVITIES TO THE AUTHORITIES. 
 
NO LEGAL STATUS ANYTIME SOON 
---------------------------- 
9. (SBU) LAM ASSERTED THAT THE AOG WOULD NEVER REGISTER WITH 
THE NEWLY RECOGNIZED SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM 
BECAUSE OF DOCTRINAL DIFFERENCES.  HE WOULD WELCOME SEPARATE 
LEGAL RECOGNITION, BUT ONLY IF THE GVN ALLOWED THE AOG TO 
FUNCTION FREE OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL AND CENSORSHIP.  SINCE 
THIS IS NOT LIKELY, HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE AOG TO REMAIN AN 
\"UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION\" FOR YEARS TO COME. 
 
10. (SBU) ALONG WITH OTHER \"CHARISMATIC\" DENOMINATIONS, THE 
AOG ACTIVELY EVANGELIZES IN VIETNAM.  THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL 
NUMBERS DO NOT REFLECT THE VIGOR WITH WHICH THEY SEEK NEW 
CONVERTS, ESPECIALLY AMONG ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS.  THEY ARE 
THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT WITHIN VIETNAM\'S PROTESTANT 
COMMUNITY, WHICH MAY ALSO EXPLAIN WHY AUTHORITIES IN VIETNAM 
-- WHERE PROSELYTIZING IS ILLEGAL -- ARE WARY AND MONITOR 
THEM CLOSELY.

1. SUMMARY: IN A CORDIAL FIRST MEETING, AMBASSADOR 
BURGHARDT AND HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY NGUYEN 
MINH TRIET DISCUSSED THE ROLE OF THE VIETNAMESE 
COMMUNIST PARTY, CORRUPTION, INVESTMENT AND THE BTA, 
AND THE DIRECTION OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. TRIET 
STRESSED THE GRASSROOTS NATURE OF VIETNAMESE COMMUNISM. 
BESIDES SERVING AS THE HCMC PARTY CHIEF, TRIET IS THE

PARTY POLITBURO. END SUMMARY. 
 
GRASSROOTS DECISION MAKING 
-------------------------- 
 
2. HCMC COMMUNIST PARTY SECRETARY NGUYEN MINH TRIET 
WELCOMED AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT (ACCOMPANIED BY CG, DPO, 
AND CONOFFS/NOTETAKERS) TO HCMC PARTY HEADQUARTERS, 
LOCATED IN THE FORMER U.S. DCM\'S RESIDENCE. OPENING THE 
DISCUSSION, THE AMBASSADOR NOTED THAT HE KNOWS TRIET 
LIKES TO SPEAK FRANKLY ON BIG ISSUES, AND ASKED TRIET 
TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST PARTY 
(CPV) VIS-A-VIS THAT OF THE GOVERNMENT. TRIET STATED 
THREE IMPORTANT ROLES FOR THE CENTRAL PARTY COMMITTEE: 
TO PLAN PROVINCIAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, MONITOR THE 
VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT\'S POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, AND 
ENSURE THE CPV FUNCTIONS ACCORDING TO ITS OWN RULES. HE 
NOTED SIMILARITIES WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY 
STRUCTURE, BUT EMPHASIZED THE ROLE OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP 
AS A KEY PART OF CPV DECISION MAKING IN VIETNAM. THE 
PARTY COMMITTEE PLANS OVERALL POLICIES FOR THE 
PROVINCES AND LOCALITIES, BUT LOCAL DECISIONS ARE BASED 
ON GRASSROOTS OPINION. THE PARTY COMMITTEE RESPONDS TO 
LOCAL CONCERNS AND WILL INSPECT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
STRUCTURE IF PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY WITH ITS DECISIONS. 
THE PARTY COMMITTEE MONITORS MEMBERS\' ACTIVITIES TO 
ENSURE ADHERENCE TO CPV TENETS, AND THE CPV PUNISHES 
CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY IN THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT. 
 
3. THE AMBASSADOR ASKED TRIET ABOUT CORRUPTION IN 
VIETNAM.  HE SUGGESTED THAT ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00471  01 OF 02  061031Z 
THAT THE WAY TO BEGIN TO COMBAT CORRUPTION IS BY PAYING 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DECENT SALARIES AND ENSURING CLEAR 
PUNISHMENT FOR VIOLATIONS.  THE HARD PART IS EXPOSING 
CORRUPTION.  IN THE U.S., A FREE PRESS AND INDEPENDENT 
ORGANIZATIONS ACT AS WATCHDOGS, BUT IN A HIGHLY 
REGULATED SOCIETY, THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
CORRUPTION. 
 
4. TRIET ACKNOWLEDGED CORRUPTION IN VIETNAM AND CITED 
LOW SALARIES AS ONE REASON. STILL THERE WAS A LIMIT AS 
TO HOW FAR THE GOVERNMENT COULD GO IN RAISING 
GOVERNMENT SALARIES, AS THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT FOR 
INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT AND STIMULATING THE ECONOMY. 
HE DESCRIBED THE GRASSROOTS ROLE OF THE CPV, AS WELL AS 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FATHERLAND FRONT, IN PROTECTING 
CITIZENS\' RIGHTS AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION. THE CPV SENDS 
OUT \"EVALUATION FORMS\" FOR NEIGHBORHOODS TO COMMENT ON 
THEIR LOCAL PARTY LEADERS - EVEN A PARTY LEADER\'S 
SPOUSE AND CHILDREN ARE FAIR GAME.  ORGANIZATIONS LIKE 
THE FATHERLAND FRONT MEET WITH NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS 
ON THE UPCOMING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS TO LISTEN 
TO THEIR CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS.  IN HIS ONLY 
HISTORICAL ASIDE, TRIET NOTED THAT VIETNAM LACKS 
EXPERIENCE IN GOOD GOVERNANCE \"DUE TO THE LONG WAR,\" 
BUT ADDED THE COUNTRY WANTS TO LEARN GOOD GOVERNANCE 
TACTICS FROM THE WEST. 
 
BTA - A STRONG ECONOMIC CONNECTION WILL HELP THE 
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00471  01 OF 02  061031Z 
5. TURNING TO THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), THE 
AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED BTA IMPLEMENTATION AS ONE OF HIS 
PRIORITIES.  HE NOTED THAT AMERICAN COMPANIES IN CHINA 
PLAYED AN ADVOCACY ROLE FOR CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION 
TO BENEFIT THEIR BUSINESSES. BY COMPARISON, THERE ARE 
FEW U.S. COMPANIES IN VIETNAM WHO WOULD TRY TO 
INFLUENCE CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION REGARDING VIETNAM. 
 
6.  TRIET NOTED THAT CHINA HAD BEEN INDEPENDENT LONGER, 
SO ITS ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. WAS 
NATURALLY MORE MATURE.  HE SAID A STRONG ECONOMIC 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S., LED BY THE BTA, WILL PAVE 
THE WAY FOR VIETNAM\'S ENTRY INTO THE WORLD TRADE 
ORGANIZATION.  HOWEVER, WITH THE \"NEGATIVE REACTION\" OF 
SOME OVERSEAS VIETNAMESE TO THE BTA, THE U.S. HAS A 
\"RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY\" TO EXPLAIN THE NEW BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP TO THEM, AND TO CURB THEIR \"COUNTER- 
REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES\".  THE AMBASSADOR EMPHASIZED 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE DOMESTIC PRIVATE SECTOR AS THE BEST 
WAY TO ATTRACT FDI.  TRIET ADDED THAT THE PARTY CENTRAL 
COMMITTEE HAD PLANNED FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR AND HAD CONFIRMED THE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OF 
HCMC\'S RAPID PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT. 
 
ROOM FOR GROWTH IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
7. THE AMBASSADOR MENTIONED THAT MUCH WORK REMAINED TO 
BE DONE IN THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WAS STILL 
NOT TOTALLY NORMALIZED IN MANY RESPECTS.  DISTRUST 
STILL EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES, HAMPERING COORDINATION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00471  02 OF 02  061031Z 
BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE 
MILITARY-TO-MILITARY RELATIONSHIP. TRIET AGREED THAT 
THERE WERE MANY POSITIVE ASPECTS TO THE RELATIONSHIP, 
BUT THE HISTORICAL LEGACY REMAINED AN OBSTACLE. 
 
8. THE AMBASSADOR AND TRIET AGREED TO MEET AGAIN FOR A 
FRANK AND CANDID DISCUSSION, WITH TRIET CALLING THE 
AMBASSADOR A \"BRIDGE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.\" 
 
9. COMMENT:  TRIET IS A MODERN POLITBURO MEMBER WHO 
BELIEVES IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE 
IMPORTANCE OF VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC INTEGRATION INTO THE 
WORLD MARKET.  WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE A FRONTRUNNER FOR 
VIETNAM\'S NEXT PRIME MINISTER, HIS EMPHASIS ON THE 
GRASSROOTS NATURE OF THE CPV\'S DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
APPEARED TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO CAST THE CPV AS A 
DEMOCRATIC BODY RATHER THAN AS THE UNYIELDING, OPAQUE 
STRUCTURE THAT IT IS.  END COMMENT.  YAMAUCHI

PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z 
MEETING IN HANOI, MEMBERS OF THE US DELEGATION SPENT A DAY 
IN HCMC FOCUSING ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) IN 
THE COUNTRY\'S ECONOMIC HUB.  LOCAL OFFICIALS INDICATED THEY 
ARE AWARE OF IPR PROBLEMS AND ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO 
ADDRESS THEM.  VIETNAMESE BUSINESSPEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT 
RAMPANT IPR VIOLATIONS ARE HURTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. 
HOWEVER, PIRATED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY OPTICAL DISCS 
PRODUCED IN CHINA, ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT HCMC. 
ENFORCEMENT, SPLIT AMONG SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGENCIES, IS 
UNCOORDINATED AND INEFFECTUAL.  THE DELEGATION STRESSED TO 
LOCAL OFFICIALS THAT IPR ENFORCEMENT WAS A KEY COMMITMENT IN 
THE BTA, AND IMPORTANT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, A SENTIMENT 
WITH WHICH HCMC OFFICIALS EXPRESSED AGREEMENT.  THE DAY 
ENDED WITH A VISIT TO HCMC\'S \"HARD ROCK CAF\" WHICH US 
RIGHTS-HOLDERS HAVE BEEN TRYING - UNSUCCESSFULLY - TO CLOSE 
DOWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DELEGATION STRESSES NEED TO PROTECT IPR 
--------------------------------------- 
2.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST MEETING OF THE JOINT 
COMMITTEE OF THE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT (BTA), MEMBERS OF 
THE US DELEGATION FROM USTR, STATE, COMMERCE, AND THE 
COPYRIGHT OFFICE JOINED CONGEN ECONOFFS IN HO CHI MINH CITY 
TO REVIEW THE IPR SITUATION IN THE CITY.  THE DELEGATION 
REINFORCED THE MESSAGE DELIVERED IN HANOI: IMPROVING IPR 
PROTECTION WAS A KEY BTA COMMITMENT, INTEGRAL TO THE WTO 
ACCESSION PROCESS, AND VITAL TO VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS - AT 
THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE, THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD, AND 
THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
(DOSTE - WHICH REGULATES PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS) AGREED. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z 
ALL SAID THEY WERE DOING THEIR BEST TO STOP INFRINGEMENTS, 
BUT THE PROCESS WAS COMPLICATED BY THE LARGE NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT AGENCIES CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING 
IPR LAWS.  THEY ALSO OPERATE WITH INADEQUATE RESOURCES AND 
UNDER CONSTRAINTS TO THEIR LEGAL AUTHORITY.  FINES ARE 
NOMINAL AND LIMITS ON THEIR AUTHORITY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO 
CATCH OFFENDERS AND ENFORCE THE LAW, THEY CLAIMED. 
 
IPR IS IMPORTANT - IN THEORY 
------------------------- 
3.  AT DOSTE, THE CHIEF OF THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY 
MANAGEMENT SECTION, MS. TRUONG THUY TRANG, EXPLAINED THAT 
FIVE AGENCIES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR IPR ENFORCEMENT.  HER 
OFFICE HANDLES THE REGULATION OF TRADEMARK AND PATENTS.  A 
SEPARATE DOSTE INSPECTORATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCURATE 
PRODUCT LABELING.  SHE ALSO CITED THE MARKET MANAGEMENT 
BOARD, THE ECONOMIC POLICE, CUSTOMS, AND THE CIVIL COURTS. 
SHE LEFT OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURE AND INFORMATION, 
WHICH REVIEWS AND CENSORS \"SENSITIVE\" MATERIAL, BUT IS ALSO 
RESPONSIBLE FOR COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. 
 
4.  MS. TRANG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS 
WERE MORE THEORY THAN REALITY, BUT CLAIMED HCMC HAD THE BEST 
IPR ENFORCEMENT IN THE COUNTRY.  ALTHOUGH HER AGENCY HAD NO 
DIRECT ENFORCEMENT ROLE, IT OFTEN TRIED TO MEDIATE BETWEEN 
RIGHTS-HOLDERS AND INFRINGERS.  DOSTE COULD ALSO ADVISE 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OF IPR VIOLATIONS, SHE SAID, BUT COULD 
NOT COMPEL THEM TO ACT.  SHE STATED THAT WHILE THE MARKET 
MANAGEMENT BOARD \"HAD ALL OF THE POWER,\" THEY WERE OFTEN 
LESS EFFECTIVE THAN DOSTE\'S MEDIATION EFFORTS.  SHE OFFERED 
TO LOOK INTO ANY SPECIFIC CASES OF CONCERN. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00538  01 OF 03  211143Z 
 
5.  THE DELEGATION TOOK THE BAIT AND ASKED ABOUT THE CASE OF 
HCMC\'S \"HARD ROCK CAF,\" RUN BY SOMEONE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO THE TRADEMARK.  THE US RIGHTS-HOLDER HAD FILED A 
COMPLAINT LAST YEAR TO TRY TO SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.  MS. 
TRANG STATED THAT SHE WAS AWARE OF THE CASE AND HAD MET WITH 
THE OWNER IN A MEDIATION EFFORT.  HE HAD PROMISED IN WRITING 
TO REMOVE THE OUTDOOR SIGNATURE \"HARD ROCK CAF\" SIGN FROM 
HIS ESTABLISHMENT.  WHEN THE DELEGATION REMARKED IT WOULD BE 
VISITING THE SITE LATER THAT AFTERNOON, SHE BACKTRACKED AND 
STATED THAT THE LAW FIRM REPRESENTING THE RIGHTS-HOLDER HAD 
NOT ADVISED HER AS TO WHETHER THE SIGN HAD ACTUALLY BEEN 
REMOVED.  SHE ALSO NOTED THAT DOSTE DID NOT HAVE AUTHORITY 
TO ENTER THE RESTAURANT TO SEE IF THE TRADEMARK WAS BEING 
USED IMPROPERLY INSIDE. 
 
6.  AT THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
ENFORCING ALL LAWS RELATING TO DOMESTIC TRADE IN THE CITY, 
DIRECTOR HUYNH TAN PHONG POINTED OUT THAT HIS OFFICE HAD 
WORKED WELL WITH A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COMPANIES WHO HAD IPR 
PROBLEMS, NAMING PHILIPS, PROCTER & GAMBLE, AND RICOH.  (THE 
ATTORNEY WHO HAD REPRESENTED RICOH - WHICH WAS TRYING TO 
STOP THE SALE OF COUNTERFEIT TONER CARTRIDGES - HAD EARLIER 
TOLD THE DELEGATION THAT THE MMB WERE SO UNDER-RESOURCED 
THAT THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF VISITED A SHOP PRETENDING TO BE A 
BUYER, IN ORDER TO ID THE COUNTERFEITS.)  MR. PHONG 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HCMC AND THE COUNTRY STILL FACED HUGE IPR 
PROBLEMS, BUT PLEDGED TO ASSIST WITH ANY IPR-RELATED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z 
REQUEST.  WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE \"HARD ROCK CAF\" CASE, HE 
SAID THE FILE WAS STILL WITH DOSTE, SO HIS AGENCY DID NOT 
YET HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION. 
 
7.  OFFICIALS AT THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF TRADE ALSO 
REITERATED THE IMPORTANCE OF IPR ISSUES FOR HO CHI MINH 
CITY.  DIRECTOR PHAM THI KIM HONG NOTED THAT ONE OF THE 
CITY\'S MAJOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOALS WAS TO ESTABLISH A 
LOCAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY.  THIS COULD ONLY 
HAPPEN IF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS WERE TRULY PROTECTED. 
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, SHE DISAVOWED ANY ENFORCEMENT 
ROLE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE.  WHEN THE DELEGATION 
POINTED OUT THAT THE MARKET MANAGEMENT BOARD FELL UNDER HER 
DEPARTMENT\'S JURISDICTION, SHE STATED IT WAS ONLY NOMINALLY 
SO, AND THAT THE MMB OPERATED AUTONOMOUSLY.  DEPUTY DIRECTOR 
NGUYEN DINH MAI, WHO ALSO ATTENDED THE MEETING, STATED 
INFORMALLY TO ONE DELEGATION MEMBER THAT IPR CONCERNS NEEDED 
TO BE RAISED WITH THE HCMC PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO 
MAKE PROGRESS. 
 
IPR VIOLATIONS HURT LOCAL BUSINESS 
---------------------------------- 
8.  LOCAL VIETNAMESE BUSINESSPEOPLE WHO MET THE DELEGATION 
STRESSED THAT IPR INFRINGERS HAD AFFECTED THEIR BUSINESSES. 
MR. LE HONG THANH, DIRECTOR OF SAIGON AUDIO, A LOCAL 
RECORDING COMPANY, STATED THAT BECAUSE ALL OF HIS PRODUCTS 
WERE COPIED, IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GENERATE PROFITS 
ON NEW MUSIC.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SELL LEGITIMATE COPIES 
AND RECOUP COSTS, LET ALONE GENERATE PROFITS IN A MARKET 
WHERE PIRATED COPIES OUTNUMBERED LEGITIMATES BY ABOUT 20/30 
TO ONE.  TO GENERATE REVENUE, SAIGON AUDIO HAD TAKEN TO RE- 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z 
RELEASING \"OLDIES,\" WHICH COULD BE SOLD MORE CHEAPLY.  THEY 
ALSO REDUCED THE NUMBER OF NEW RECORDINGS BY VIETNAMESE 
ARTISTS FROM 100 TO 40 PER YEAR.  HIS COMPANY, ALONG WITH 
OTHERS IN THE LOCAL AUDIO AND VIDEO INDUSTRY, HAD SUBMITTED 
A PETITION TO THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ASKING FOR MORE 
COPYRIGHT PROTECTION.  HE BELIEVES SOME PIRATED PRODUCTION 
IS OCCURRING IN VIETNAM, PARTICULARLY FOR LOCAL FILMS AND 
TAPES.  THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO PIRATED COPIES OF AMERICAN 
AND OTHER FOREIGN FILMS/RECORDINGS, MOST OF WHICH ARE 
BELIEVED TO COME FROM CHINA. 
 
9.  MR. NGUYEN VINH LOC, THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTOR OF BOSE 
SPEAKERS, ALSO COMPLAINED THAT HIS COMPANIES HAVE TO COMPETE 
WITH FAKES.  HE SAID SHODDY COPIES ARE IMPORTED FROM CHINA 
AND BETTER QUALITY COUNTERFEITS COME OUT OF TAIWAN.  FALSE 
BOSE LABELS ARE ATTACHED ONCE THE PRODUCT ENTERS THE 
COUNTRY.   MR. LOC STATED THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, BOSE 
HAD TRIED WORK WITH LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND AN 
ATTORNEY TO STOP THE SALE OF THE FAKES.  HE CLAIMED THIS WAS 
COMPLETELY INEFFECTUAL.  HE SUGGESTED THAT FOR IPR 
ENFORCEMENT TO WORK THERE MUST BE POLITICAL WILL AT A 
RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL.  HE FELT \"THE VIETNAMESE WAY\" WOULD 
BE TO GO THROUGH THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE AND URGE THEM TO 
SEND THE ORDER DOWN TO THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  ONLY 
WORKING WITH THE AGENCIES DID NOT BRING RESULTS. 
 
CDS, DVDS, AND EXPENSIVE T-SHIRTS 
--------------------------------- 
10.  AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE DELEGATION VISITED A 
DOWNTOWN STREET LINED WITH SMALL SHOPS SELLING CDS AND DVDS, 
NONE OF WHICH APPEARED TO BE LICENSED COPIES.  DVDS SELL FOR 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00538  02 OF 03  211143Z 
ABOUT 20,000 VND (ABOUTUSD1.20).  MOSTLY LOCAL PRODUCT WAS 
DISPLAYED IN THE SHOPS, BUT FOREIGN FILMS AND AUDIO 
RECORDINGS WERE ALSO AVAILABLE.  THE GROUP ALSO STROLLED 
OVER TO THE \"HARD ROCK CAF\" A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, WHERE THE 
SIGN WAS STILL OVER THE FRONT ENTRANCE.  INSIDE, THE WALLS 
AND CEILING DRIPPED WITH ROCK N\' ROLL EPHEMERA AND, 
STRANGELY, AUTO AND MOTORCYCLE PARTS.  THE INTERIOR MIGHT 
NOT BE CONFUSED WITH ITS LICENSED COUNTERPARTS ELSEWHERE IN 
THE WORLD, BUT THIS PLACE DID HAVE A BOOTH BY THE DOOR 
SELLING EXPENSIVE \"HARD ROCK CAF SAIGON\" T-SHIRTS AND 
TRINKETS.  EVEN WITH ALL OF THE EFFORTS BY A LOCAL LAW FIRM 
AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, IT APPEARS THIS PLACE IS DOING 
BUSINESS AS USUAL. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
11.  ALL OF THE LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO MET THE DELEGATION SPOKE 
STRONGLY ABOUT THE NEED TO ATTACK VIETNAM\'S IPR PROBLEMS AND 
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WEAK IPR ENFORCEMENT WOULD ACT AS A BRAKE 
ON HCMC\'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.  THIS OFFERS SOME HOPE THAT, 
EVEN IN THIS DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT, LOCAL OFFICIALS AND 
BUSINESS REALIZE THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS TO IPR PROTECTION. 
AT THE SAME TIME, IN THE SAMPLE CASE WE RAISED AT EVERY 
MEETING - THAT OF THE \"HARD ROCK CAF\" - OFFICIALS SEEMED 
READY TO PASS THE BUCK - TO OTHER AGENCIES OR EVEN TO THE 
LAW FIRM REPRESENTING THE RIGHTS-HOLDER.  AND WHILE 
SPIDERMAN IS UNLIKELY TO DESCEND AND ROUND UP ALL OF THE 
SPECIAL INTERESTS PROFITING ON THE PIRATED GOODS AVAILABLE

PAGE 02        HO CHI  00538  03 OF 03  211143Z 
IN THE LOCAL MARKET, GOOD QUALITY COPIES OF SPIDERMAN ARE 
ALREADY AVAILABLE HERE ON DVD. 
 
12.  THE DELEGATION DID NOT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR 
THIS CABLE.

1. ALTHOUGH HCMC VIDEO STALLS ARE STILL FILLED WITH CHEAP 
VERSIONS OF HOLLYWOOD FAVORITES, LOCAL IPR AUTHORITIES ARE 
FINALLY FORCING ONE TRADEMARK-STEALING ESTABLISHMENT, \"THE 
HARD ROCK CAFE,\" TO CHANGE ITS NAME - MAYBE.  THIS COMES 
AFTER THE RIGHT-HOLDER HAD BEEN WORKING WITH A LOCAL LAW 
FIRM FOR MORE THAN A YEAR TO GET THE PLACED CLOSED DOWN. 
THE ATTORNEY INVOLVED IN THE CASE BELIEVED THAT POST QUERIES 
ABOUT THE CASE AND THE RECENT VISIT BY USG REPS (REFTEL) 
FOCUSING ON IPR ISSUES SPURRED LOCAL AUTHORITIES INTO 
ACTION. 
 
2. LAST WEEK SAIGON\'S LOCAL VERSION OF \"THE HARD ROCK CAFE\" 
WAS VISITED BY THE INSPECTORATE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT (DOSTE), ONE OF THE 
MYRIAD AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR IPR ENFORCEMENT IN HCMC. 
THE AUTHORITIES REMOVED AND DESTROYED THE ESTABLISHMENT\'S 
\"HARD ROCK CAFE\" OUTDOOR SIGNAGE - ONE NEON SIGN WAS 
DESTROYED UNDER THE BOOT OF THE COMPLAINING LAWYER INVITED

3.  THE PROBLEM APPEARS FAR FROM SETTLED, HOWEVER.  THE 
COMPLAINING ATTORNEYS SENT A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR TO THE 
SCENE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THE SIGNS STILL GONE, BUT THAT 
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS BUSINESS AS USUAL.  THE LOGO 
MERCHANDISE, T-SHIRTS, KEY RINGS, ETC. WHICH HAD 
MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED BEFORE THE RAID, WERE BACK ON SALE. 
THE STAFF STILL ANSWERS THE PHONE \"HARD ROCK CAF.\" THE 
INTERIOR DECOR HAS NOT CHANGED, AND HARD ROCK CAFE-LABELED 
MENUS ARE STILL IN USE.

1. SUMMARY:  FOLLOWERS OF VIETNAM\'S HOA HAO RELIGION 
HAVE ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE FREEDOM TO WORSHIP SINCE THE 
GVN GRANTED OFFICIAL RECOGNITION IN 1999 TO THIS 
PREVIOUSLY OUTLAWED BUDDHIST SECT.  DURING A JUNE 23-25 
VISIT TO AN GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA, POLOFF 
VISITED A SPARKLING NEW HOA HAO BUDDHIST PAGODA AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 02        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z 
SPOKE WITH SEVERAL OPTIMISTIC FOLLOWERS OF THE RELIGION 
AT PHU MY (HOA HAO) VILLAGE.  ON JUNE 28, MORE THAN 
200,000 HOA HAO DEVOTEES JOURNEYED TO PHU MY TO ATTEND 
AN ANNUAL RELIGIOUS FESTIVAL.  STILL, SOME BELIEVERS 
REMAIN DISSATISFIED WITH THE GVN\'S HANDLING OF HOA HAO 
AFFAIRS, AND THE GVN REMAINS WARY OF HOA HAO MONKS IT 
CONSIDERS \"DISSIDENT.\"  SEPTEL WILL REPORT ON A HOA HAO 
MONK RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON AND ON POLICE 
PREVENTING POLOFF FROM MEETING WITH ANOTHER DISSIDENT 
MONK.  END SUMMARY. 
 
FREEDOM TO WORSHIP 
------------------ 
 
2. THE HOA HAO WERE AMONG THE LAST RESISTANCE TO 
COMMUNIST FORCES IN THE MEKONG DELTA IN 1975.  THEIR 
ANTI-COMMUNIST HISTORY STEMS FROM THE VIET MINH\'S 
EXECUTION OF THEIR FOUNDER, HUYNH PHU SO, IN 1947.  IN 
SUMMER 1975, THE GOVERNMENT DISBANDED THE HOA HAO, 
CONFISCATED THEIR PROPERTIES, AND OUTLAWED THEIR 
PRACTICES.  BECAUSE ITS BASIC TENETS EMPHASIZE 
INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PRAYER AT HOME RATHER THAN PUBLIC 
WORSHIP AT PAGODAS, THE RELIGION SURVIVED. 
 
3. IN 1999, THE GVN ORGANIZED A HOA HAO CONGRESS THAT 
SELECTED OFFICERS FOR A NEW GOVERNMENT-SANCTIONED HOA 
HAO REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE. THIS LED TO OFFICIAL GVN 
RECOGNITION LATER IN THE YEAR.  MANY HOA HAO FOLLOWERS 
ALLEGE THAT THE REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE IS ANYTHING 
BUT REPRESENTATIVE -- THE 11 OFFICERS ELECTED AT THE 
CONGRESS WERE THE SAME 11 PERSONS THE GVN HAD SELECTED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z 
TO ORGANIZE THE CONGRESS. 
 
4. SINCE RECOGNITION IN 1999, THE GVN HAS RELAXED 
SIGNIFICANTLY ITS EARLIER RESTRICTIONS ON HOA HAO 
PRACTICE.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOA HAO BELIEVERS MAY NOW 
WORSHIP FREELY IN THEIR HOMES AND PUBLICLY AT 
RECOGNIZED PAGODAS.  THE GVN NO LONGER FORBIDS DISPLAY 
OF THE FOUNDER\'S PHOTOGRAPH, ALTHOUGH IT STILL 
PROHIBITS DISPLAY OF THE HOA HAO FLAG.  THE OFFICIAL 
REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE HAS PUBLISHED SOME, BUT NOT 
ALL, OF THE HOA HAO SACRED LITERATURE.  PROVINCIAL 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE RETURNED A FEW PREVIOUSLY CONFISCATED 
PAGODAS, BUT CONTINUE TO HOLD AND USE FOR OTHER 
PURPOSES MOST HOA HAO PROPERTIES THAT HAD BEEN 
CONFISCATED AFTER 1975. 
 
NEW HOA HAO PAGODA 
------------------ 
 
5. ON JUNE 24, POLOFF MADE AN UNSCHEDULED STOP AT 
SPARKLING NEW PHU THO ONG BA HOA HAO PAGODA IN CHO MOI 
DISTRICT IN AN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE PAGODA MANAGER, MR. 
NGUYEN VAN THOI, SAID FLOODING TWO YEARS EARLIER HAD 
SEVERELY DAMAGED AN OLDER PAGODA BY THE SAME NAME, 
LOCATED NEARBY.  HE AND OTHER HOA HAO FOLLOWERS 
REQUESTED AND RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE LOCAL 
GOVERNMENT AND THE OFFICIAL HOA HAO REPRESENTATIVE 
COMMITTEE TO BUILD A NEW PAGODA.  MR. THOI CONFIRMED 
THAT PHU THO ONG BA WAS THE FIRST NEW HOA HAO PAGODA TO 
BE BUILT SINCE BEFORE 1975; CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED 
IN MAY 2002.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00695  01 OF 02  150601Z 
 
6. MR. THOI, HIS DEPUTY, THE SENIOR MONK, THREE OTHER 
MONKS, AND APPROXIMATELY 30 ORDINARY HOA HAO BELIEVERS 
WERE PRESENT AT THE PAGODA WHEN POLOFF VISITED. 
ALTHOUGH THE MONKS AND BELIEVERS APPEARED PLEASED BY 
POLOFF\'S UNANNOUNCED VISIT, MR. THOI SEEMED A BIT 
DISCONCERTED.  STILL HE INVITED POLOFF TO STAY FOR 
LUNCH.  DURING THE MEAL, MR. THOI, HIS DEPUTY, AND A 
FEMALE FOLLOWER WHO MAY HAVE BEEN A HOA HAO NUN SAID 
THAT RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO IN 1999 HAD MADE LIFE 
EASIER.  THEY WOULD NOT BE DRAWN OUT ON SPECIFIC ISSUES 
WHERE THEY HAD SEEN IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER. 
 
7. MR. THOI SAID THAT SINCE 1999, HOA HAO COMMITTEES 
HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AT PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT, AND 
COMMUNE LEVELS IN AREAS WHERE HOA HAO BELIEVERS ARE 
POPULOUS.  HE AVOIDED POLOFF\'S QUESTIONS ON WHETHER 
THESE COMMITTEES WERE ELECTED OR APPOINTED. 
 
8. THE SENIOR MONK TOOK POLOFF ON A TOUR OF THE PAGODA, 
WHICH CONTAINED SEVERAL BUDDHIST SHRINES SET UP IN TWO 
SPACIOUS ROOMS.  WORSHIPPERS PRAYED AND BURNED INCENSE 
AT THE SHRINES, WHICH DISPLAYED EITHER RED WOODEN

VISIT TO PHU MY (HOA HAO) VILLAGE 
--------------------------------- 
 
9. ALSO ON JUNE 24, POLOFF VISITED AN HOA (THE MAIN HOA 
HAO PAGODA) AND TO DINH (THE HOA HAO FOUNDER\'S 
ANCESTRAL HOME), BOTH PILGRIMAGE SITES IN PHU MY (HOA 
HAO) VILLAGE.  THE OFFICIAL HOA HAO REPRESENTATIVE 
COMMITTEE, WHOSE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT AN HOA PAGODA, 
PREVIOUSLY HAD DECLINED TO MEET WITH POLOFF.  THEY 
EXPLAINED THEY WERE TOO BUSY WITH PREPARATIONS FOR THE 
ANNUAL FOUNDING DAY FESTIVAL - FALLING ON JUNE 28. 
 
10. PREPARATIONS FOR THE FESTIVAL INDEED WERE IN FULL 
SWING.  POLOFF SAW SCORES OF PEOPLE BUSY PACKAGING 
FOODS AND CONSTRUCTING SHELTERS FOR THE TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF HOA HAO FOLLOWERS EXPECTED TO DESCEND ON 
THE VILLAGE FOUR DAYS LATER.  HUNDREDS OF HOA HAO 
FOLLOWERS ALREADY WERE VISITING AND WORSHIPPING AT THE 
TWO PILGRIMAGE SITES.  (NOTE: ON A REGULAR DAY, BETWEEN 
100 AND 200 FOLLOWERS VISIT AN HOA PAGODA.) 
 
11. POLOFF SPOKE TO SEVERAL OF THE ORDINARY HOA HAO 
FOLLOWERS HE ENCOUNTERED.  THEY ALL EXPRESSED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z 
APPRECIATION THAT THEY NOW COULD COME TO THE PAGODA TO 
WORSHIP FREELY AND PUBLICLY.  ONE FOLLOWER NOTED THAT 
NEIGHBORING PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS HAD DISTRIBUTED A 
CIRCULAR INFORMING HOA HAO BELIEVERS THAT THIS YEAR 
THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HOLD PUBLIC CEREMONIES TO 
COMMEMORATE FOUNDING DAY IN THEIR OWN LOCALITIES. 
(NOTE: THE GVN HAD PROHIBITED PUBLIC COMMEMORATION OF 
FOUNDING DAY BEFORE 1999, AND FROM 1999 UNTIL THIS YEAR 
HAD RESTRICTED IT TO PHU MY VILLAGE.) 
 
12. AFTER FOUNDING DAY, POLOFF SPOKE TO SEVERAL HOA HAO 
CONTACTS WHO TOLD HIM THAT BETWEEN 200,000 AND 250,000 
PERSONS HAD MADE THE PILGRIMAGE TO PHU MY.  THEY PRAYED 
AT THE PAGODA, BURNED INCENSE AT THE ANCESTRAL HOME, 
LISTENED TO SPEECHES, AND PICNICKED IN A FESTIVE 
ATMOSPHERE, ACCORDING TO THESE CONTACTS.  MOST OF THE 
ATTENDEES WERE FROM THE MEKONG DELTA -- ABLE TO MAKE 
THE JOURNEY AND RETURN HOME THE SAME DAY.  MANY PEOPLE, 
HOWEVER, STAYED OVERNIGHT OR FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS WITH 
FRIENDS, RELATIVES, OR AT HOTELS.  POLOFF, WHO HAD 
ATTENDED THE 1999 FOUNDING DAY FESTIVAL AND HAS VISITED 
PHU MY VILLAGE THREE TIMES SINCE, NOTICED SEVERAL 
HOTELS, SHOPS, AND OTHER SIGNS OF A TOURIST INDUSTRY 
THAT WERE NOT APPARENT THREE YEARS EARLIER. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
13. RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO IN 1999 HAS LED TO 
SIGNIFICANT FREEDOM OF WORSHIP FOR ORDINARY HOA HAO 
FOLLOWERS.  SOME BELIEVERS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO 
CRITICIZE THE NON-DEMOCRATIC MANNER IN WHICH THE GVN 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00695  02 OF 02  150602Z 
ESTABLISHED THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE. 
LEADERS OF THE PRE-1975 HOA HAO CHURCH ARE STILL ANGRY 
AT BEING EXCLUDED FROM PARTICIPATING IN ADMINISTERING 
HOA HAO AFFAIRS.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES, MOREOVER, CONTINUE 
TO CLOSELY MONITOR AND SOMETIMES HARASS MONKS OR OTHER 
BELIEVERS WHO ORGANIZE WORSHIP ACTIVITIES INDEPENDENT 
OF THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE.

POLOFF FROM MEETING WITH A DISSIDENT HOA HAO MONK IN AN 
GIANG PROVINCE IN THE MEKONG DELTA.  POLICE SAT IN ON 
POLOFF\'S MEETING WITH ANOTHER DISSIDENT MONK IN THE

THE MAN WHO CLIMBED THE TREE 
---------------------------- 
 
2. ON JUNE 24, POLOFF ATTEMPTED TO VISIT HOA HAO MONK 
NAM LIEM (VO THANH LIEM) AT HIS RESIDENCE IN CHO MOI 
DISTRICT, AN GIANG PROVINCE.  NAM LIEM HAD GAINED LOCAL 
CELEBRITY IN 1994, WHEN HE CLIMBED A TALL PINE TREE IN 
HIS BACKYARD TO ESCAPE POLICE WHO HAD COME TO ARREST 
HIM.  AFTER FOUR DAYS, HE CAME DOWN FROM THE TREE, WAS 
ARRESTED, AND SPENT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IN PRISON. 
POLOFF HAD VISITED HIM AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON IN 
1999 (REF D). 
 
3. IN NOVEMBER 2001, LOCAL POLICE CAME TO TEAR DOWN HOA 
HAO FLAGS THAT LIEM HAD DISPLAYED INSIDE HIS PRIVATE 
PAGODA.  WHILE POLICE WERE INSIDE, LIEM LOCKED THE DOOR 
FROM THE OUTSIDE.  MORE POLICE CAME TO ASSIST, AND LIEM 
WENT UP THE TREE AGAIN.  UPON HIS DESCENT THIS TIME, 
ACCORDING TO HOA HAO SOURCES, THE POLICE GAVE HIM A 
STERN LECTURE, BUT DID NOT ARREST HIM.  DOZENS OF 
LIEM\'S PERSONAL FOLLOWERS CONTINUE TO VISIT HIS PRIVATE 
PAGODA EACH DAY (REFS B AND C).

PAGE 03        HO CHI  00719  01 OF 02  190741Z 
4. WHEN POLOFF ARRIVED AT THE BRICK ENTRYWAY LEADING TO 
NAM LIEM\'S PAGODA ON JUNE 24, THREE YOUNG MEN BLOCKED 
THE WAY.  SEVERAL OTHER MEN WHO APPEARED TO BE WITH 
THEM STOOD ON THE LAWN OF A NEIGHBORING TEA SHOP.  ONE 
OF THE YOUNG MEN WAS HIGHLY AGITATED AND WARNED POLOFF 
TO GO AWAY.  HE SAID THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA DID NOT 
WELCOME AMERICANS AND \"DID NOT WANT ANY AMERICANS TO 
DISTURB THE MONK AT THE PAGODA.\"  POLOFF SAID HE HAD 
VISITED AND HAD BEEN WELCOMED THERE THREE YEARS AGO, 
AND FOUND THE PEOPLE OF THE AREA TO BE FRIENDLY. 
POLOFF INDICATED HE WOULD TURN BACK, HOWEVER, IF 
AUTHORITIES OFFICIALLY HAD PLACED THE LIEM UNDER HOUSE 
ARREST OR OFFICIALLY RESTRICTED VISITORS TO THE PAGODA. 
THE YOUNG MAN, NOW ANGRY AND USING VULGAR LANGUAGE, 
DENIED HE WAS A POLICE OFFICER AND SAID THE MONK WAS 
NOT UNDER ANY RESTRICTIONS.  HE REPRESENTED THE 
COMMUNITY, HE SHOUTED, AND THE COMMUNITY DID NOT WANT 
ANY AMERICANS IN THE VICINITY. 
 
5. POLOFF NOTICED MORE PEOPLE APPROACHING AS THE 
EXCHANGE CONTINUED.  SEVERAL HOA HAO FOLLOWERS 
(DISTINCTIVE BY THEIR HAIR BEING TIED BACK IN A BUN AND 
THEIR WEARING OF PLAIN BLACK OR GRAY TUNICS) LISTENED 
INTENTLY, THEN SOME OF THEM BEGAN ARGUING WITH THE 
YOUNG MEN WHO HAD BLOCKED THE ROAD.  BECAUSE A PHYSICAL 
ALTERCATION APPEARED TO BE IN THE WORKS, POLOFF DECIDED 
TO RETURN TO HIS VEHICLE AND DRIVE AWAY.  POLOFF DROVE 
BY SIX HOURS LATER AND SAW THE SAME GROUP OF YOUNG MEN 
LYING IN WAIT. 
 
6. ONE WEEK LATER, A HOA HAO ELDER IN HO CHI MINH CITY 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00719  01 OF 02  190741Z 
WENT TO VISIT NAM LIEM.  HE LATER TOLD POLOFF THAT LIEM 
WAS MORTIFIED AT THE LOCAL POLICE TREATMENT OF POLOFF 
AND ASSURED HIM HE WOULD WELCOME VISITS BY POLOFF OR 
ANY OTHER AMERICAN DIPLOMAT.  THE HOA HAO ELDER ALSO 
SAID THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY WAS INFURIATED WHEN THEY 
DISCOVERED THE PLAINCLOTHES POLICE HAD SAID AMERICANS 
WERE UNWELCOME THERE.  RELATIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND 
THE COMMUNITY WERE NOW VERY TENSE. 
 
COURAGEOUS EX-PRISONER 
---------------------- 
 
7. AFTER BEING TURNED BACK AT THE HOME OF NAM LIEM, 
POLOFF WENT TO TRY TO VISIT ANOTHER DISSIDENT HOA HAO 
MONK, TU TRIET (LE MINH TRIET).  IN OCTOBER 1993, 
AUTHORITIES IN AN GIANG PROVINCE\'S CHO MOI DISTRICT HAD 
ORDERED TU TRIET TO DEMOLISH HIS HOME BECAUSE HE HAD 
BUILT IT IN A PAGODA STYLE WITHOUT GOVERNMENT 
PERMISSION.  HE REFUSED, BUT THEY DEMOLISHED THE HOUSE 
AND CAME TO ARREST HIM.  AS A FUGITIVE, HE WROTE TO THE 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA AND TO THE OVERSEAS HOA HAO 
COMMUNITY SEEKING ASSISTANCE.  FINALLY ARRESTED IN 
MARCH 1994, HE WAS CHARGED AND FOUND GUILTY OF 
\"CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW\" AND OF \"COOPERATING WITH FOREIGN

8. POLOFF HAD DIRECTIONS TO TU TRIET\'S BROTHER\'S HOME 
WHERE TRIET CURRENTLY RESIDES, BUT HAD TO ASK FOR 
SPECIFICS AFTER ARRIVING IN THE GENERAL VICINITY. 
RECEIVING CONTRADICTORY DIRECTIONS FROM DIFFERENT 
PERSONS IS NOT UNUSUAL IN RURAL VIETNAM.  HOWEVER, WITH 
FOUR PLAINCLOTHES POLICE FOLLOWING CLOSELY ON 
MOTORCYCLES, POLOFF WAS CONVINCED THAT NEIGHBORS HAD 
BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GIVE THE WRONG DIRECTIONS.  POLOFF 
HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP WHEN HE NOTICED ONE POLICEMAN WHO 
HAD BEEN FOLLOWING HIM SITTING ON A PORCH NEXT TO A MAN 
CLAD IN WHITE.  THE MAN IN WHITE WAS TRIET. 
 
9. TU TRIET SMILED BROADLY AS POLOFF SAT DOWN.  THREE 
PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMEN SAT DOWN WITH THEM.  THEY 
LISTENED, BUT DID NOT INTERFERE IN THE CONVERSATION. 
TRIET RECOUNTED THE STORY OF HOW AND WHY HE HAD BEEN 
ARRESTED.  HE SAID HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED VISITORS WHILE 
IN PRISON AND HAD BEEN TREATED NO WORSE THAN THE OTHER 
PRISONERS.  HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER A TWO-YEAR 
ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION AND IS NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE 
THE VILLAGE WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE LOCAL POLICE. 
 
10. TU TRIET SAID THAT AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF PRISON, THE 
THING THAT MOST SURPRISED HIM WAS THE DEGREE OF FREEDOM 
OF WORSHIP ENJOYED BY HOA HAO BELIEVERS. (REF A 
DESCRIBES IMPROVEMENTS FOR HOA HAO FREEDOM OF WORSHIP 
SINCE THE GVN RECOGNIZED THE SECT IN 1999.)  TRIET SAID 
HE HOPED TO SEE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS, BUT GLANCING AT 
THE POLICEMAN WHO SAT AT ARM\'S LENGTH AWAY, HE SAID HE 
WAS NOT OPTIMISTIC.

11. TRIET SAID HE OPPOSED THE GVN-SANCTIONED HOA HAO 
REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE BECAUSE HE BELIEVED ITS 
OFFICERS WERE SELECTED IN A SHAM ELECTION AT A HOA HAO 
CONGRESS THAT WAS DOMINATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  NOTING 
HIS OWN PAGODA HAD BEEN DESTROYED IN 1994, HE DOUBTED 
HE WOULD RECEIVE PERMISSION TO REBUILD.  POLOFF HAD 
JUST VISITED A NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED HOA HAO PAGODA (REF A) 
AND SUGGESTED TRIET MIGHT TRY MEETING WITH THE 
REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE, EXPLAIN HIS CASE, AND SEE IF 
THEY WOULD SUPPORT HIS BUILDING A NEW PAGODA.  TRIET 
LAUGHED AT FIRST, THEN SEEMED INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA. 
 
12. ASKED IF THERE WAS A MESSAGE TO CONVEY TO THE USG, 
TRIET REPLIED THAT HE GREATLY APPRECIATED U.S. EFFORTS 
ON HIS BEHALF AND \"FOR ALL PERSONS WHO HAVE SUFFERED 
ILL-TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE GVN.\"  HE SAID THE 
U.S. WAS A MODEL OF FREEDOM AND THAT THE VIETNAMESE 
WOULD DO WELL TO LOOK AT AMERICA AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE 
POTENTIAL OF A FREE SOCIETY.  (COMMENT: POLOFF FELT 
THAT TU TRIET\'S REMARKS -- IN FRONT OF THREE SULLEN 
POLICEMEN -- WERE THEMSELVES A MODEL OF BRAVERY IN THE 
FACE OF REPRESSION.) 
 
MESSAGE TO THE POLICE 
--------------------- 
 
13. POLOFF ALSO HAD A MESSAGE TO DELIVER, REPEATED 
TWICE DURING THE CONVERSATION.  POLOFF TOLD TRIET HE 
WAS GLAD \"OTHERS\" PRESENT WERE LISTENING.  NOW THEY 
WOULD KNOW THIS WAS NOT A DANGEROUS/SUBVERSIVE

CONVERSATION.  POLOFF WOULD REPORT ON HIS MEETING WITH 
TRIET AND ON THE IMPROVEMENTS SEEN OVER THE YEARS IN 
THE HOA HAO SITUATION.  HE WOULD ALSO REPORT THAT 
POLICE HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM MEETING WITH DISSIDENT 
HOA HAO MONK NAM LIEM.  THERE WAS NOTHING LIEM COULD 
HAVE SAID THAT WOULD MAKE THE GVN LOOK WORSE THAN THE 
POLICE THUGS PHYSICALLY BLOCKING THE ROAD TO HIS HOUSE. 
POLOFF SAID HE WAS WORRIED THAT ANY INCREMENTAL 
IMPROVEMENTS THE GVN WAS MAKING IN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
WOULD BE OVERSHADOWED BY ITS CONTINUED HARASSMENT OF 
PERSONS WITH DIFFERING VIEWS.   YAMAUCHI

1. (SBU) SUMMARY: AN ETHNIC MINORITY PROTESTANT PASTOR 
AND ONE OF HIS CONGREGATION MEMBERS TRAVELED TO HO CHI 
MINH CITY TO TELL CONGENOFFS OF AN ASSAULT BY 20-PLUS 
VILLAGERS IN THAT CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCE OF KON TUM 
THIS PAST APRIL.  THE PASTOR SAID THE VILLAGERS WHO 
ATTACKED THEM HAD ACTED ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM LOCAL 
POLICE.  THE PASTOR NOTED HE WAS AWARE OF THE 
SEPARATIST \"DEGA PROTESTANTS\" IN THE OTHER CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS PROVINCES OF DAK LAK AND GIA LAI, BUT 
MAINTAINED THAT ONLY MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS RESIDE IN 
KON TUM.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) ON JULY 24, AN ETHNIC CO TU (KATU) PROTESTANT 
PASTOR AND AN ETHNIC RO NGAO (RENGAO) CONGREGATION 
MEMBER FROM KON TUM PROVINCE - THE MOST REMOTE OF 
VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS PROVINCES - TRAVELED DOWN 
TO HCMC TO TELL CG AND POLOFF OF THE DIFFICULTIES THEY 
ARE EXPERIENCING THERE.  AN HCMC RELIGIOUS CONTACT HAD 
RECOMMENDED THAT THEY TRY TO SEE US.  (NOTE: POST IS 
REFRAINING FROM NAMING SOURCES IN THIS SBU REPORT.) 
 
3. (SBU) THE PASTOR, WHO LIVES IN KON TUM CITY, SAID HE 
HAS BEEN PREACHING TO SEVERAL FAMILIES IN A 
PREDOMINANTLY CATHOLIC ETHNIC RO NGAO VILLAGE NAMED DAK 
CHACH IN KON TUM PROVINCE\'S DAK HA DISTRICT FOR SEVERAL 
YEARS.  THE CONGREGATION MEMBER, A RESIDENT OF THIS 
VILLAGE, SAID DISTRICT AND VILLAGE POLICE HAD GATHERED 
THE VILLAGERS TOGETHER ON MARCH 20, TO TELL THEM TO 
GIVE UP PROTESTANTISM AND TO BEAT THE PASTOR AND 
DESTROY HIS VEHICLE NEXT TIME HE CAME TO THE VILLAGE. 
ON MARCH 30, DISTRICT AND VILLAGE POLICE TOLD THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00759  01 OF 02  290756Z 
RESIDENTS THAT THEY EXPECTED THE PASTOR THE FOLLOWING 
DAY AND REITERATED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO \"GIVE HIM A 
BEATING.\" 
 
4. (SBU) THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION MEMBER DESCRIBED 
THAT WHEN THE PASTOR CAME TO DAK CHACH VILLAGE ON APRIL 
1, ABOUT 20 ETHNIC RO NGAO CATHOLIC RESIDENTS CORNERED 
HIM AND BEAT HIM SEVERELY FOR THREE HOURS.  (POST NOTE: 
POST HAS SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PASTOR, ALLEGEDLY 
TAKEN AFTER HE RETURNED TO KON TUM CITY.  HE IS CLEARLY 
HEAVILY BRUISED AND SWOLLEN, WITH WELTS ON HIS BACK, 
SIDES, AND BLACK EYES.)  THE CONGREGATION MEMBER CALLED 
THE PASTOR\'S WIFE (WHO WAS 25 KILOMETERS AWAY) TO 
NOTIFY HER.  THE PASTOR\'S WIFE CALLED PROVINCIAL AND 
DISTRICT SECURITY OFFICES AND THE POLICE 113 EMERGENCY 
NUMBER, BUT THEY TOLD HER IT WAS JUST A MINOR CLASH 
BETWEEN CATHOLICS AND PROTESTANTS.  THE CONGREGATION 
MEMBER SAID THAT WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE TRIED TO ASSIST 
THE PASTOR, THEY WERE ALSO BEATEN BY THE VILLAGERS. 
THE PASTOR RELATED THAT SOME VILLAGERS HAD APOLOGIZED 
TO HIM AFTERWARDS, SAYING THEY HAD BEEN ORDERED TO DO 
WHAT THEY DID. 
 
5. (SBU) THE PASTOR SAID THAT AFTER HE RETURNED TO KON 
TUM CITY, DAK HA DISTRICT POLICE INFORMED HIM THAT HE 
WOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO PREACH IN THE DISTRICT -- 
AND IF HE DID, THE LAW WOULD NOT PROTECT HIM.  HE HAS 
NOT BEEN BACK TO PREACH. 
 
6. (SBU) THE CONGREGATION MEMBER SAID THAT ON APRIL 2, 
DISTRICT AND VILLAGE POLICE EXPELLED HIM, HIS WIFE, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00759  01 OF 02  290756Z 
THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN FROM THE VILLAGE.  WHEN THEY 
REFUSED TO LEAVE, AUTHORITIES DEMOLISHED THEIR HOME 
WITH A BULLDOZER.  HE PROVIDED PHOTOGRAPHS OF SOME 
WRECKAGE THAT HE SAID WAS HIS FORMER HOUSE.  BULLDOZER 
TRACKS COULD BE CLEARLY SEEN.  HE SAID THE POLICE ALSO 
CONFISCATED THE \"RED BOOK,\" WHICH PROVES HIS OWNERSHIP 
OF THE PROPERTY WHERE HIS HOUSE STOOD.  HE HAS BEEN 
UNEMPLOYED SINCE APRIL, AND HAS BEEN LIVING WITH 
FRIENDS OR RELATIVES FOR A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS, BEFORE 
MOVING ON SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
 
7. (SBU) IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS, THE PASTOR WAS 
EMPHATIC IN ASSERTING THAT THE SIZABLE PROTESTANT 
POPULATION OF KON TUM PROVINCE ARE MAINSTREAM BELIEVERS 
WHO ONLY PRACTICE PRAYING TO GOD.  THERE ARE NO \"DEGA 
PROTESTANTS\" - PROTESTANTS WITH A POLITICAL AGENDA - 
ACCORDING TO THE PASTOR.  HE BELIEVES PROVINCIAL 
AUTHORITIES IN KON TUM REFUSE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 
\"DEGA\" AND MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN AN EFFORT TO 
JUSTIFY \"ELIMINATING\" PROTESTANTISM IN THE PROVINCE. 
 
8. (SBU)  PREVIOUSLY, THIS PASTOR HAD SENT WORD THROUGH 
OUR MUTUAL HCMC CONTACT THAT HE WOULD WELCOME A VISIT

WHETHER SUCH A VISIT WOULD BE HELPFUL OR HURTFUL TO HIM 
AND HIS CONGREGATION, HE HESITATED.  HE THEN RESPONDED 
THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT HOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
WILL REACT TO \"INFORMAL\" VISITS.  HE SAID HE WOULD LET 
US KNOW AFTER HIS RETURN TO KON TUM. 
 
9. (SBU) COMMENT: POST CANNOT GENERALIZE ABOUT SYSTEMIC 
VIOLENT HARASSMENT OF MAINSTREAM PROTESTANTS IN KON TUM 
PROVINCE BASED ON THIS SINGLE FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT.  BUT 
WE BELIEVE IN THIS PASTOR\'S BONAFIDES.  ELEMENTS 
DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT - BEATINGS OF PROTESTANT 
PASTORS AND FOLLOWERS, POLICE HIRING OR ORDERING LOCAL 
RESIDENTS AND/OR THUGS TO DO THE DIRTY WORK, AND 
PROTESTANT RESIDENTS BEING EXPELLED FROM THEIR VILLAGES 
- ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE WE HAVE HEARD IN NUMEROUS SECOND 
AND THIRD-HAND REPORTS FROM THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS AND 
OTHER PROVINCES.  THIS HAS BEEN THE FIRST FIRSTHAND 
REPORT ABOUT AN ASSAULT ON A PROTESTANT PASTOR IN KON 
TUM PROVINCE WITH CREDIBLE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE.

OF THE MISERY IN VIETNAM\'S MEKONG DELTA 
 
REF: A) HANOI 1024 
 
1. (U) SUMMARY: AN OFDA-FUNDED DISASTER RELIEF PROJECT 
HAS BROUGHT A SMALL MEASURE OF RELIEF TO POVERTY- 
STRICKEN MEKONG DELTA FAMILIES, HARD HIT BY DROUGHT AND 
FOREST FIRES IN KIEN GIANG PROVINCE, VIETNAM.  THESE 
COMMUNITIES EKE OUT A MARGINAL EXISTENCE AROUND THE U 
MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK, WHICH IS ITSELF THREATENED 
BY POACHING AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE POLICY DECISIONS. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
USAID DISASTER ASSISTANCE 
---------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ON JULY 17, AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT AND AN 
EMBASSY/CONSULATE GENERAL TEAM (DPO, ECONOFF, FSN 
POL/ECON ASSISTANT, OFDA OFFICER/MANILA, AND A PRIVATE 
WATER MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT) OBSERVED THE STARK 
AFTERMATH OF DROUGHT AND FIRE IN THE U MINH THUONG 
NATIONAL PARK IN KIEN GIANG PROVINCE.  THE AMBASSADOR 
HAD DECLARED THIS AREA ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER RELIEF 
AFTER FIRES LAST MARCH BURNED DOWN MORE THAN 2300 
HECTARES, REDUCING THE COMPLEX FOREST ECOSYSTEM TO 
BURNT PEAT AND CHARRED LOGS. 
 
3. (U) AT THE AMBASSADOR\'S REQUEST, USAID/OFDA PROVIDED 
USD 50,000 FOR DISASTER RELIEF.  THE OFDA FUNDS 
PROVIDED FRESH DRINKING WATER, ESTABLISHED INCOME- 
GENERATING PROJECTS IN AQUACULTURE, BEE KEEPING, AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00779  01 OF 02  300824Z 
BROOM-MAKING, AND DEVELOPED A WATER 
SANITATION/ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.  IN 
ADDITION TO THE OFDA DISASTER RELIEF PROJECT, CARE 
INTERNATIONAL ALSO MANAGES A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM NEAR THE 
U MINH THUONG PARK TO PROVIDE MICRO-LOANS AND CREDIT, 
IMPROVE VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE, CONDUCT AGRICULTURAL 
RESEARCH, AND REFOREST PARK AREAS. 
 
THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK 
------------------------------- 
 
4. (U) THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK (UMT) COVERS 
8000 HECTARES OF MARSHLANDS AND \"MELALEUCA\" FOREST TO 
THE CAMBODIAN BORDER.  \"MELALEUCA\" IS AN INDIGENOUS 
TREE IN KIEN GIANG AND GROWS IN THE HIGHLY ACIDIC PEAT 
SOIL HERE.  IN 1993, THE GVN DESIGNATED UMT AS A NATURE 
RESERVE TO PRESERVE ITS THREATENED PLANT AND ANIMAL 
SPECIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE TO THIS 
AREA.  IN ADDITION TO HOSTING RARE TREES AND FERNS, UMT 
IS THE ONLY REMAINING PEAT SWAMP FOREST ECOSYSTEM IN 
VIETNAM.  THE AREA IS ALSO ONE OF THE LAST TWO 
REMAINING HABITATS IN THE WORLD FOR THE ENDANGERED 
HAIRY-NOSED OTTER, AND CONTAINS THE LARGEST WATER BIRD 
COLONY IN VIETNAM. 
 
QUESTIONABLE LOGIC: RESETTLING A LANDLESS POPULATION 
AROUND A NATURE RESERVE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
5. (U) SHORTLY AFTER THE UMT RESERVE WAS CREATED IN 
1993, THE GVN MOVED 3160 PREVIOUSLY LANDLESS HOUSEHOLDS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00779  01 OF 02  300824Z 
(APPROXIMATELY 17,000 PEOPLE) INTO A 13,000-HECTARE 
BUFFER ZONE.  THE GVN GAVE EACH FAMILY FOUR HECTARES OF 
LAND FOR RICE PRODUCTION AND SMALL-SCALE AQUACULTURE. 
IN RETURN FOR THE LAND, EACH HOUSEHOLD MUST REPAY THE 
GVN USD 2,000 IN SEVEN YEARS (ALTHOUGH THE PAYMENT 
SCHEDULE IS FLEXIBLE), AND GROW ONE HECTARE OF 
\"MELALEUCA\" TREES, THUS REDUCING THEIR AVAILABLE LAND 
TO THREE HECTARES.  IN ADDITION, THE FAMILIES MUST ALSO 
PROTECT THE CORE ZONE FROM BEING ILLEGALLY HARVESTED. 
 
6. (U) THE ALLOCATION OF FOUR HECTARES OF FERTILE 
FARMLAND TO PREVIOUSLY LANDLESS FARMERS GENERATED HIGH 
EXPECTATIONS, BUT IT APPEARS MOST DREAMS HAVE YET TO BE 
FULFILLED.  THE WOODEN OR BAMBOO HOUSES, MANY WITH 
THATCHED ROOFS AND WALLS OF PLASTIC SACKING, CONTAIN 
THE BAREST ESSENTIALS AND WERE LITTLE MORE THAN SEMI- 
ENCLOSED RAIN SHELTERS.  KITCHEN, BATHING AND RESTROOM 
FACILITIES CONSIST OF PLATFORMS OVER THE CANALS THAT 
CRISSCROSS THE BUFFER ZONE.  RESIDENTS LOOKED GAUNT AND 
TIRED.  A FORMER TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO UMT PARK SAID 
THAT BUFFER ZONE RESIDENTS OFTEN FAIL AT FARMING AND 
LEASE THEIR PROPERTY TO OTHERS, BECOMING SQUATTERS ON 
THEIR OWN LAND.

OF THE MISERY IN VIETNAM\'S MEKONG DELTA 
 
BUT THERE ARE PLANS FOR A WAR MEMORIAL IN UMT PARK 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7. (SBU) THE GVN RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO DEVELOP A 
SECTION OF THE CORE ZONE AS A WAR MEMORIAL AND TOURISM 
SITE.  CARE INTERNATIONAL STAFF FEAR THAT THE ROAD 
CONSTRUCTION WILL DAMAGE U MINH THUONG\'S ECOSYSTEM AND 
FACILITATE POACHING.  THEY HAVE URGED THE KIEN GIANG 
PROVINCE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE TO COMPLETE AN 
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR THE ROAD, AS REQUIRED 
UNDER VIETNAM\'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.  TO DATE, THE 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE HAS NOT ISSUED AN ASSESSMENT, WHICH 
SOME CARE STAFF MEMBERS S ATTRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL- 
LEVEL POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE MEMORIAL. 
 
8. (U) COMMENT: ALTHOUGH THE MEKONG DELTA PROVIDES 
APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF VIETNAM\'S RICE HARVEST, 
CERTAIN AREAS, INCLUDING THE U MINH THUONG NATIONAL 
PARK, REMAIN EXTREMELY POOR.  WHILE THE OFDA-FUNDED 
PROJECT ALLEVIATED SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE MISERY 
FOLLOWING THE FIRE, SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESOURCES ARE 
NECESSARY TO MEET BASIC HUMAN NEEDS.   AT THE SAME 
TIME, THE GVN\'S DECISION TO RESETTLE PEOPLE IN THE U 
MINH THUONG NATIONAL PARK\'S BUFFER ZONE RAISES 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THE PARK\'S 
CONSERVATION MANDATE.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: THE FREE MARKET PHENOMENON OF ONE VIETNAMESE 
TRA AND BASA (\"CATFISH\") FARMER 
 
 
1.   (U) SUMMARY:  FOR ONE VIETNAMESE FARMER IN THE 
MEKONG DELTA, PRODUCTION OF \"TRA\" AND \"BASA\" -- THE 
FISH FORMERLY KNOWN AS \"CATFISH\" -- IS A STUNNING 
EXAMPLE OF THE SUCCESS OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE 
UNFETTERED APPLICATION OF FREE MARKET PRINCIPLES. 
FIERCE COMPETITION AND SELF-TAUGHT MARKET SAVVY SEEM TO 
BE CREATING A NEW BREED OF FARMER.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NGUYEN VAN THO, \"THE CATFISH KING\" 
-------------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) ON JULY 18, AMBASSADOR BURGHARDT AND AN 
EMBASSY/CONSULATE GENERAL TEAM (DPO, ECONOFF, FSN 
POL/ECON ASSISTANT, AND INTERPRETER) VISITED A 
FINGERLING FARM AND FLOATING CAGE OWNED BY NGUYEN VAN 
THO, KNOWN LOCALLY AS THE \"KING OF CATFISH.\",  HE IS 
THE BIGGEST PRIVATE \"TRA\" AND \"BASA\" PRODUCER IN AN 
GIANG PROVINCE.  TRAINED BY HIS FATHER AND A VIETNAMESE 
PH.D. FISHERIES ADVISOR, THO WAS A POOR FARMER WITH NO 
FORMAL EDUCATION WHO TOOK A CHANCE ON THE GROWING TRA 
AND BASA MARKET. 
 
3. (U) THO LITERALLY BUILT HIS BUSINESS FROM THE GROUND 
UP.  IN 1995, THO BEGAN BUYING LAND FROM NEIGHBORS, 
PAYING APPROXIMATELY VND 200 MILLION (USD 1300) PER 
HECTARE.  TO FINANCE THESE PURCHASES, THO OBTAINED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00785  01 OF 02  010759Z 
LOANS FROM FRIENDS AND VIETNAMESE PRIVATE BANKS.  HE 
SAID STATE-OWNED BANKS WERE RELUCTANT TO LEND MONEY TO 
PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN, AND THE GOVERNMENT GAVE HIM NO 
LOANS OR SUBSIDIES.  WHEN HE HAD ACQUIRED 14 HECTARES, 
THO INVESTED VND 400 MILLION (USD 2670) TO DEVELOP 80 
PONDS ON THE LAND.  THO PLANS TO DEVELOP ANOTHER 20 
HECTARES IF AMERICAN CONSUMERS CONTINUE TO SNAP UP HIS 
FISH.  IN ADDITION, THO ANCHORS 40 FLOATING CAGES IN 
THE RIVER, EACH WEIGHING 25 TO 50 METRIC TONS. 
 
A FORTUNE IN FISH 
----------------- 
 
4. (U) THO\'S HOMEGROWN FISH BUSINESS TURNS OVER 
APPROXIMATELY VND 24 BILLION (USD 1,600,000), WITH A 
NET PROFIT OF VND 4 BILLION (USD 267,000) ANNUALLY.  HE 
OPERATES FAIRLY CLOSE TO HIS BOTTOM LINE, HOWEVER.  IF 
THE PRICE REMAINS AT VND 12,000 (USD 0.80) PER 
KILOGRAM, THO MAKES A PROFIT.  BUT HE LOSES MONEY IF 
THE PRICE DECLINES BY AS LITTLE AS USD 0.05, TO VND 
9,000 (USD 0.75) PER KILOGRAM.  THO SELLS HIS FISH TO 
THE HIGHEST BIDDER, USUALLY FISH PROCESSING FACTORIES 
LINING THE RIVER WHO RECEIVE THE LIVE FISH DIRECTLY 
FROM A TRANSPORT SHIP.  AFTER THE FISH IS PROCESSED AND 
FROZEN, IT IS EXPORTED TO THE UNITED STATES\' EAST 
COAST, WHERE THO\'S TRA FILLET SELLS FOR USD 1.71- 
1.75/POUND (USD 3.76-3.85/KILOGRAM).  BASA SELLS FOR 
USD 2.00-2.03/POUND (USD 4.40-4.47/KILOGRAM). 
 
5. (U) IN ADDITION TO HIS \"WHOLE FISH\" OPERATION 
DESCRIBED ABOVE, THO PRODUCES 10 MILLION FISH 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00785  01 OF 02  010759Z 
\"FINGERLINGS\" ANNUALLY, WHICH HE SELLS TO OTHER MEKONG 
DELTA FARMERS FOR VND 10 BILLION (USD 670,000), FOR A 
NET PROFIT OF VND 2 BILLION (USD 133,000).  THE 
FINGERLINGS SELL FROM VND 300-1200 (USD 0.02-0.08) EACH 
AT 30-85 DAYS OLD.  THUS ALTOGETHER, THO\'S FISH 
BUSINESS NETS A PROFIT OF USD 400,000 PER YEAR.  THO 
HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT, IN ADDITION TO HIS 
IMMEDIATE FAMILY, THE BUSINESS NOW SUPPORTS THE 
FAMILIES OF 16 RELATIVES.  THO HIMSELF HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
SEND ALL FOUR OF HIS CHILDREN TO STUDY ABROAD. 
 
LOW TECH BUT HIGH PRODUCTION 
---------------------------- 
 
6. (U) THO AND HIS DAUGHTER, WHO STUDIED ENGLISH FOR 
SIX MONTHS IN AUSTRALIA, ESCORTED THE AMBASSADOR AND 
CONGEN TEAM THROUGH THE 14-HECTARE FINGERLING FARM, A 
SERIES OF EARTHEN PONDS LINKED BY WOODEN GANGPLANKS, 
WITH A LONG, OPEN SHED HOUSING THE RUDIMENTARY BREEDING 
EQUIPMENT.  ALTHOUGH THE FACILITIES ARE BASIC, THE 
PONDS ARE DRAINED AND CLEANED EVERY 15 DAYS AND PH 
TESTS ARE USED TO ENSURE WATER QUALITY.  THO EITHER 
SELLS THE FINGERLINGS OR TRANSFERS THEM TO HIS OWN 
CAGES.  THE FISH SPEND SEVEN TO TWELVE MONTHS IN A CAGE

(REACHING A WEIGHT OF 1-2 KILOGRAMS) BEFORE THEY ARE 
SOLD TO PROCESSORS. 
 
7. (SBU) FURTHER DOWN THE RIVER, THE AMBASSADOR BOARDED 
THO\'S HOME, A HOUSEBOAT WITH A GIANT FISH CAGE 
UNDERNEATH.  VARIOUS FLOATING FISH PENS WERE ATTACHED 
TO THE SIDES, AND THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE WAS TIED 
TOGETHER BY ROPES AND ANCHORED TO THE RIVER BOTTOM. 
FEEDING THE FISH WAS SIMPLE.  WORKERS OPENED A TRAP 
DOOR IN THE CENTER OF THE HOUSE AND DUMPED A SACK OF 
FISHFOOD INTO THE WATER BELOW.  THE SUBSEQUENT FEEDING 
FRENZY SHOWED LARGE FISH ROILING IN THE MURKY WATER. 
THO SAID HE ONCE USED AMERICAN CARGILL FISHFOOD FOR 
FISH WEIGHING OVER 600 GRAMS, AS WELL AS PROCONCO AND 
UNI-PRESIDENT FEED.  BUT HE HAD STOPPED BUYING FROM 
CARGILL BECAUSE OF WHAT HE TERMED \"QUALITY\" CONCERNS 
AND A LACK OF RESPONSIVENESS TO HIS SUGGESTIONS. 
(NOTE:  POST WILL FOLLOW UP ON THIS WITH CARGILL, WHEN 
THEIR LOCAL EXECUTIVES RETURN FROM VACATION.) 
 
ROARING CAPITALISM IN THE PLACID DELTA 
-------------------------------------- 
 
8. (U) THO OWES HIS SUCCESS TO HIS INGENUITY, SMART 
INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND SHEER CHUTZPAH.  HE ALSO 
BENEFITS FROM VIETNAM\'S CHEAP LABOR, HUGE AMOUNTS OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

FREE, RELATIVELY CLEAN WATER, AND CREATIVE CONCEPTS, 
SUCH AS GIANT PORTABLE CAGES.  WHILE THE OTHER 5000 
FISH FARMERS IN AN GIANG PROVINCE ARE NOT AS SUCCESSFUL 
AS THO, TOGETHER THEY PRODUCE HALF OF VIETNAM\'S ENTIRE 
TRA AND BASA HARVEST, ESTIMATED AT 120,000 METRIC TONS. 
FURTHERMORE, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FISH FARMS ARE 
PRIVATELY-OWNED BUSINESSES WITH FAMILY SAVINGS (OR 
DEBT) INVESTED.  ONLY ONE FULLY-OWNED STATE-OWNED 
ENTERPRISE (SOE) CONTINUES TO PRODUCE TRA AND BASA IN 
AN GIANG (IT ONLY HAS 40 CAGES), ALTHOUGH THO SAID THE 
STATE OWNS A SHARE OF ONE LARGE PRIVATIZED PRODUCER AND 
THE PROCESSING INDUSTRY ITSELF IS A MIX OF SOES AND 
PRIVATE BUSINESSES. 
 
9. (U) COMMENT: NGUYEN VAN THO CREATED A MILLION- 
DOLLAR BUSINESS, USING ONLY PRIVATE FUNDS AND ELBOW 
GREASE.  HIS FUTURE SUCCESS AND THAT OF OTHER PRIVATE 
ENTREPRENEURS WILL DEPEND ON THE GVN\'S WILLINGNESS TO 
LET THEM OUTPERFORM THE SOES AND BECOME MAJOR MARKET 
FORCES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  THESE NEW ENTREPRENEURS 
WILL BE THE ONES WHO DEAL WITH THE FIERCE COMPETITION 
IN WORLD MARKETS.  ALTHOUGH THE ANTI-DUMPING CASE WAS 
ONLY DISCUSSED BRIEFLY, THO (AND OTHER SCRAPPY 
ENTREPRENEURS) MAY LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT BEING TOO 
SUCCESSFUL CAN TRIGGER UNEXPECTED REACTIONS -- AND 
LEAVE HIM WONDERING HOW HIS COMPETITIVE EDGE WORKED 
AGAINST HIM.

TAGS: VM, ETRD, KIPR, KTEX, IPROP 
SUBJECT: VIETNAMESE IPR ENFORCEMENT:  HOW NIKE GOT ITS SWOOSH BACK 
 
(1)  (U)  SUMMARY:  NIKE WENT ON THE OFFENSIVE RECENTLY IN 
SOUTHERN VIETNAM, WORKING WITH LOCAL POLICE ON A RAID THAT NETTED 
23 TRUCKLOADS OF COUNTERFEIT NIKE AND ADIDAS SHOES AND MATERIALS. 
NIKE\'S AGGRESSIVE STRATEGY, AND NEWFOUND FRIENDSHIP WITH THE 
VIETNAMESE POLICE, IS BREATHING LIFE INTO LARGE-SCALE TRADEMARK 
ENFORCEMENT.  END SUMMARY. 
 
(2)  (SBU)  IN LATE JULY, LOCAL AND SPECIAL \"ECONOMIC POLICE\" IN 
HO CHI MINH CITY SEIZED 23 TRUCKLOADS OF MATERIAL USED TO MAKE 
COUNTERFEIT NIKE AND ADIDAS SHOES.  IN GATHERING THE EVIDENCE FOR 
THE RAID, THE POLICE WORKED CLOSELY WITH NIKE\'S NEW IN-HOUSE 
INVESTIGATOR, WHO SPENT ONE YEAR GATHERING EVIDENCE FROM 
INFORMANTS AND OLD-FASHIONED DETECTIVE WORK.  IRONICALLY, NIKE 
INITIATED THE INVESTIGATION AFTER RECEIVING A TIP-OFF FROM A 
COMPETING COUNTERFEIT PRODUCER. 
 
(3)  (SBU)  THE MATERIALS SEIZED IN THE RAID WERE EITHER 
COUNTERFEIT PARTS, MOSTLY MANUFACTURED IN VIETNAM, OR DEFECTIVE 
NIKE AND ADIDAS SHOE PARTS SLATED FOR RECYCLING.  COUNTERFEITERS 
BOUGHT THE DEFECTIVE PARTS FROM RECYCLERS, SCAVENGERS OR FROM NIKE 
WORKERS WHO SMUGGLE SHOE PARTS OUT OF THE FACTORY IN THEIR CLOTHES 
OR LITERALLY FLING THEM OVER THE BACK FENCES.  THE NIKE COUNTRY 
MANAGER ESTIMATES THAT THE OPERATION HAD MADE 5000 PAIRS OF SHOES 
SINCE JANUARY 2001, WHICH WERE SOLD ALL OVER VIETNAM FOR A PROFIT 
OF VND 800 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY USD 52,000).  THE RAW MATERIALS 
ALONE WERE WORTH OVER VND 300,000,000 (USD 20,000) AND COULD BE 
MANUFACTURED INTO 15,000 SHOES.  SOLD AT AN AVERAGE USD 7.25 PER 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  00934  161034Z 
PAIR, THE COUNTERFEITERS COULD HAVE MADE AN ADDITIONAL USD 
112,300.  THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA INCOME IN VIETNAM IS ABOUT USD 
450. 
 
(4)  (SBU)  NIKE PRAISED THE COOPERATION IT RECEIVED FROM THE 
LOCAL POLICE, EVEN THOUGH NIKE PAID FOR THE POLICE OVERTIME AND 
MATERIALS (E.G., FUEL) TO MOUNT THE RAID, TRUCKS TO HAUL AWAY THE 
MATERIAL, AND THE STORAGE COSTS AT A WAREHOUSE PENDING ACTUAL 
DESTRUCTION OF THE MATERIALS.  THE POLICE RESPONDED QUICKLY (ONE 
WEEK) TO NIKE\'S REQUEST FOR AN INVESTIGATION, AND WORKED 
EXPEDITIOUSLY (SIX MONTHS) TO COMPLETE THE INVESTIGATION. 
IRONICALLY, NIKE SUSPECTS THAT THE RAID WAS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AN 
INFORMANT INSIDE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD TIPPED OFF THE 
COUNTERFEITER SO FREQUENTLY, THAT THE COUNTERFEITER ASSUMED THE 
RAID TIP OFF WAS A FALSE ALARM AND FAILED TO VACATE THE PREMISES. 
 
(5)  (SBU)  ALTHOUGH POLICE HELD APPROXIMATELY TWO DOZEN 
COUNTERFEITERS FOR SEVERAL HOURS, NO ARRESTS WERE MADE SINCE THE 
CASE IS NOT YET CONSIDERED CRIMINAL.  NO FINES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED 
EITHER, ALTHOUGH THE ECONOMIC POLICE SHOULD DETERMINE THE FINE 
SHORTLY.  AUTHORITIES ARE STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER TO FILE 
CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST THE COUNTERFEITERS.  (NOTE:  ONE OF THE 
COUNTERFEITERS IS THE NEPHEW OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY CHAIRMAN OF A 
POWERFUL NEIGHBORING PROVINCE.  END NOTE.)  CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE 
POSSIBLE WHEN THE COUNTERFEIT MATERIAL IS WORTH OVER VND 30 
MILLION (USD 2000).  NIKE CONSIDERS THE SEIZURE OF THE MATERIALS 
AND POSSIBLE PAYMENT OF BACK TAXES TO BE A VICTORY IN ITSELF. 
 
(6)  (SBU)  COMMENT:  NIKE\'S NEW PROACTIVE STANCE -- HIRING AN 
INVESTIGATOR AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE POLICE -- MAY SIGNAL A 
NEW PHASE OF TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT IN VIETNAM.  NIKE\'S STATUS AS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  00934  161034Z 
AN INDIRECT EMPLOYER OF ALMOST 60,000 WORKERS IN VIETNAM MAY HAVE 
MOTIVATED THE ENTHUSIASTIC GVN RESPONSE TO NIKE\'S CONCERNS. 
CRITICAL NOW IS THE PENALTY PHASE, AND WHETHER THE COUNTERFEITERS 
RECEIVE A SLAP ON THE HAND OR A REAL CRIMINAL SENTENCE.  WHATEVER 
THE OUTCOME, NIKE\'S PUBLIC PRAISE OF THE POLICE AND ITS PROMISE TO 
INITIATE MORE RAIDS MAY MAKE FOR MORE INTERESTING ACTION IN THE 
MONTHS TO COME.  END SUMMARY.

AND CELL PHONE.)  EARLY SEPTEMBER 21, HAVING MANAGED TO 
REESTABLISH CONTACT AND GAIN A CLEARER PICTURE OF THE 
SITUATION, THE BROTHER CONVEYED QUE\'S INVITATION TO THE 
CONSULATE GENERAL TO VISIT HIM AT HOME TO DISCUSS THE 
SITUATION. 
 
3.  (SBU) CONGEN POLOFF VISITED DR. QUE ON THE AFTERNOON OF 
SEPTEMBER 21.  HE SEEMED UNFAZED BY THIS LATEST BRUSH WITH 
THE STATE SECURITY APPARATUS AND APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD 
HEALTH.  HE SPOKE OPENLY AND ANIMATEDLY.  WHILE THERE WERE 
NO UNIFORMED POLICE NEAR THE RESIDENCE, THE EXISTENCE OF 
CONSTRUCTION CREWS WORKING NEXT DOOR MADE IT DIFFICULT TO 
TELL IF THE PROPERTY WAS UNDER SURVEILLANCE.  POLOFF

ENCOUNTERED NO OBSTACLES TO HIS ONE-BLOCK WALK DOWN THE 
SIDESTREET ON WHICH DR. QUE LIVES. 
 
4.  (SBU) DESCRIBING EVENTS WITH HIS USUAL BRAVADO, DR. QUE 
SAID THAT 20-30 POLICE AND SECURITY OFFICERS CAME TO HIS 
HOME ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 20 AT 0800 AND STAYED UNTIL NOON. 
SEVERAL OFFICERS WORE LOCAL POLICE UNIFORMS, BUT MANY MORE 
WERE DRESSED IN STREET CLOTHES.  TWO MARKED POLICE CARS 
BLOCKED THE ALLEYWAY ON BOTH SIDES OF QUE\'S DOORWAY.  A MAN 
WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS NGUYEN VAN DUNG, DEPUTY CHIEF OF 
POLITICAL SECURITY, LED THE OPERATION AND DID MOST OF THE 
TALKING FOR THE NEXT FOUR HOURS.  UPON ARRIVAL, DUNG 
FLASHED AN OFFICIAL LOOKING DOCUMENT AND DEMANDED THAT QUE 
ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE POLICE STATION.  CITING ILL HEALTH AND 
THE LACK OF A VALID LEGAL DOCUMENT ALLEGING SPECIFIC 
VIOLATIONS OF VIETNAMESE LAW, QUE REFUSED. 
 
5.  (SBU) DEPUTY CHIEF DUNG ACCUSED DR. QUE OF AUTHORING 
PRINT AND INTERNET ARTICLES CRITICAL OF GVN POLICIES. 
ACCORDING TO QUE, DUNG THREATENED TO USE \"STRONG MEASURES,\" 
TO INDUCE QUE TO SUBMIT TO QUESTIONING.  QUE FREELY 
ADMITTED THE TEXTS WERE HIS (SOME WERE SEVERAL YEARS OLD) 
AND INVITED POLICE TO CONDUCT A SEARCH.  HE NOTED THAT HIS 
OPINIONS WERE ALREADY A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD AND HE HAD 
NOTHING TO HIDE.  HE INSISTED THAT HE WOULD GO TO THE 
POLICE STATION ONLY IF FORCED TO DO SO.  AFTER ATTEMPTING 
TO PRESSURE QUE\'S WIFE AND TWO ADULT SONS TO CONVINCE HIM 
TO GIVE IN, DEPUTY CHIEF DUNG AND COMPANY FINALLY DEPARTED, 
LEAVING SEVERAL OFFICERS BEHIND.  AS HE LEFT, DUNG PROMISED 
TO RETURN SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE WITH HIS BOSS, CHIEF THAI 
VAN TAM, AND A COURT ORDER.

PAGE 04        HO CHI  00966  01 OF 02  240817Z 
 
6.  (SBU) DR. QUE REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED THAT HE HAD NO IDEA 
WHAT MIGHT HAVE TRIGGERED THIS SUDDEN BURST OF INTEREST 
FROM THE AUTHORITIES.  ONE POSSIBILITY HE MENTIONED, 
HOWEVER, WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTING A VISIT 
FROM PHIL FISHMAN AND TIM RYAN OF THE AFL-CIO.  BUT THEY 
HAD NOT ACTUALLY MADE CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE 
QUE\'S PHONE SERVICE HAD BEEN INTERMITTENTLY CUT OFF.  AS 
POLOFF WAS LEAVING, QUE SAID THAT HE HAD RECENTLY RECEIVED 
A LAPTOP COMPUTER FROM THE U.S. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF 
SCIENCES AND ASKED IF THE CONSULATE GENERAL COULD ASSIST 
HIM IN CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET.  HE SAID THAT THE 
AUTHORITIES WERE AWARE THAT HE HAD THE COMPUTER, BUT WOULD 
NOT PERMIT HIM TO REGISTER FOR AN INTERNET ACCOUNT. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN AT LEAST A 
YEAR THAT DR. QUE (OR A RELATIVE) HAS SPECIFICALLY ASKED 
FOR CONGEN ASSISTANCE.  OUR SURPRISE WAS MATCHED BY THAT OF 
THE EXTERNAL RELATIONS OFFICE (LOCAL BRANCH OF THE FOREIGN 
MINISTRY IN HCMC), WHO HAD HEARD OF NO NEW REASON FOR QUE 
TO ATTRACT SUCH POLICE ATTENTION.  QUE HAS RECEIVED 
CONGENOFFS AND OTHER AMERICAN VISITORS FAIRLY REGULARLY. 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PHONE SERVICE CUTOFFS, HE HAS NOT 
COMPLAINED TO US OF SPECIFIC POLICE HARASSMENT.

PAGE 02        HO CHI  01123  01 OF 02  060451Z 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IPR) ENFORCEMENT 
AUTHORITIES IN HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM RAIDED LOCAL COMPUTER 
SHOPS ON OCTOBER 17, SEIZING APPROXIMATELY 7000 PIRATED DISKS. 
THIS ACTION MARKS THE FIRST ILLEGAL SOFTWARE RAID IN VIETNAM. 
ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT CLAIMED VICTORY, THE RAID IN FACT HAD LIMITED 
SUCCESS DUE TO INADEQUATE TRAINING AND MICROSOFT\'S OWN INTERNAL 
DILEMMA - WHETHER TO PUSH FOR STRONG IPR ENFORCEMENT OR GOOD 
RELATIONS WITH RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) MICROSOFT ESTABLISHED A REPRESENTATIVE OFFICE IN HANOI IN 
1996 AND A BRANCH IN HCMC TWO MONTHS AGO.  IT IS THE FIRST 
SOFTWARE COMPANY TO TRY TO ENFORCE THE 1997 U.S-VIETNAM COPYRIGHT 
AGREEMENT.  WHEN MICROSOFT\'S CHIEF REPRESENTATIVE IN VIETNAM, MR. 
NGO P 
HUC CUONG, OPENED THE HCMC OFFICE, HE TOLD CONSUL GENERAL AND 
ECONOFF THAT MICROSOFT PLANNED TO RAID ILLEGAL SOFTWARE SHOPS AND 
CRACK DOWN ON VIETNAM\'S RAMPANT PIRACY RATE.  MR. CUONG ESTIMATED 
THIS RATE AT 94 PERCENT, DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR\'S 97 PERCENT. 
 
3. (SBU) PLANNING FOR THE ACTUAL RAID REACHED HIGH LEVELS OF 
INTRIGUE, AND ILLUSTRATES WHY IPR ENFORCEMENT IS SO DIFFICULT IN 
VIETNAM.  MICROSOFT CHOSE TO USE ITS SINGAPORE LEGAL OFFICE AS THE 
\"BAD COP\" IN ORDER TO KEEP MR. CUONG OUT OF THE LIMELIGHT AND 
PRESERVE HIS \"GOOD COP\" ROLE WITH LOCAL COMPANIES.  THE SINGAPORE 
REPRESENTATIVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH AN EXPATRIATE LAW FIRM IN HCMC, 
AS WELL AS MR. HUYNH TAN PHONG, THE HEAD OF THE MARKET MANAGEMENT 
BOARD (MMB).  (NOTE:  SOURCES SAY THAT MICROSOFT\'S DECISION TO USE 
ITS SINGAPORE OFFICE MAY HAVE BACKFIRED.  THE SINGAPORE OFFICE, 
FAMILIAR WITH THAILAND AND INDIA, FAILED TO APPRECIATE THE 
DIFFICULTY OF WORKING IN A COMMUNIST COUNTRY WHERE IPR ENFORCEMENT 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01123  01 OF 02  060451Z 
IS A BRAND-NEW AND SUSPECT CONCEPT.  MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MUTUAL 
FRUSTRATION WERE FREQUENT.  CONGEN NOMINATED MR. PHONG FOR AN IPR 
INTERNATIONAL VISITORS GRANT LAST SUMMER AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
FOCUS ON BUILDING IPR ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AS PART OF THE 
MISSIONWIDE STRATEGY.  END NOTE.) 
 
4.  (SBU) THE MMB IS THE RELEVANT IPR INSPECTION AUTHORITY ON 
SOFTWARE PIRACY.   MICROSOFT HELD A ONE-DAY TRAINING FOR 40 MMB 
INSPECTORS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY COUNTERFEIT DISKS, WHICH ARE EASILY 
DISTINGUISHABLE FROM GENUINE PRODUCTS.  HOWEVER, MR. PHONG WAS 
RELUCTANT TO PROCEED WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORITY FROM THE HCMC 
PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  MICROSOFT ACCORDINGLY SOUGHT AND OBTAINED 
STRONG ENDORSEMENT FOR THE RAID FROM DR. NGUYEN THIEN NHAN, THE 
COMMITTEE\'S FIRST VICE CHAIRMAN AND AN ACTIVE IT SUPPORTER.  BUT 
AT THE LAST MINUTE, MR. PHONG POSTPONED THE RAID - WITHOUT 
EXPLANATION - POSSIBLY TO ASSERT HIS INDEPENDENCE. 
 
5. (U) ON THE APPOINTED DAY, MMB INSPECTION TEAMS, WITH 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM MICROSOFT AND THE EXPAT LAW FIRM IN TOW, 
SIMULTANEOUSLY RAIDED SEVEN RETAIL OUTLETS AND SEIZED 
APPROXIMATELY 7000 DISKS.  THE STORES RANGED FROM SMALL \"MOM AND 
POP\" SHOPS TO LARGE SOPHISTICATED OPERATIONS.  ONE STORE WAS EVEN 
SELLING PIRATED SOFTWARE ON ITS WEBSITE, WWW.PCLEHOAN.COM.  MMB 
TEAMS CONFISCATED THE DISKS AND WILL EVENTUALLY DESTROY THEM. 
SOME OF THE SHOP OWNERS COMPLAINED, \"HOW CAN YOU DO THIS WHEN THE 
GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS USING OUR (COUNTERFEIT) STUFF?\"  THE MMB, 
ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING THE FINES, HAS NOT YET ANNOUNCED THE 
CHARGES OR THE AMOUNTS.  FINES COULD REACH VND 20-40 MILLION 
(USD1300-2600) FOR THE FIRST VIOLATION AND VND 50-70 MILLION 
(USD3300-4600) FOR EACH ADDITIONAL VIOLATION.  EACH PIRATED DISK 
COULD BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE VIOLATION. 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01123  01 OF 02  060451Z 
 
6. (SBU) THE EXPATRIATE LAWYER WORKING WITH MICROSOFT CALLED THE 
RAID A SUCCESS, BUT POINTED OUT VARIOUS WEAKNESSES IN THE 
ENFORCEMENT CHAIN.  FIRST, THE MMB TEAMS FOCUSED ONLY ON THE 
MICROSOFT TRADEMARK VIOLATION.  TEAMS SEIZED MICROSOFT SOFTWARE 
AND LEFT BEHIND BLANK DISKS OR BLATANTLY PIRATED SOFTWARE OF NON- 
MICROSOFT ORIGIN.  SECOND, EACH MMB TEAM HAD A DIFFERENT APPROACH. 
SOME TEAMS LEFT BEHIND DISKS LABELED ONLY AS \"MS WORD,\" WHILE 
OTHERS SEIZED ANY MICROSOFT PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF LABELING. 
THIRD, THE TEAMS SEIZED ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF DISKS, ALTHOUGH 
MICROSOFT\'S PRE-RAID SURVEY SHOWED THAT EACH STORE STOCKED 5000- 
10,000 PIRATED DISKS.  THE LAW FIRM REPRESENTATIVE WHO ACCOMPANIED 
MMB ON THE RAID URGED MICROSOFT TO INSTRUCT MMB TO SEIZE GREATER 
QUANTITIES OF PIRATED MATERIAL, BUT THE MICROSOFT REPRESENTATIVE 
BACKED DOWN IN THE FACE OF ANGRY PROTESTS FROM SHOP OWNERS. 
FINALLY, THE TEAMS SEIZED A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF DISKS FROM 
SMALL OPERATORS, WHOSE SALES HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE MARKET. 
THE MMB SEIZED ONLY APPROXIMATELY 500 DISKS FROM EACH OF THE BIG 
OPERATORS, AND LESS THAN 100 FROM THE STORE SELLING PIRATED 
SOFTWARE ON THE INTERNET (AFTER SHOP MANAGERS AGAIN DISPUTED 
MICROSOFT\'S RIGHT TO SEIZE NON-MICROSOFT PRODUCT).  THE TEAM 
SEIZED ONLY 40 DISKS FROM THE BIGGEST KNOWN COMMERCIAL DEALER. 
 
7. (SBU) MICROSOFT ANNOUNCED ITS SATISFACTION WITH THE RAID AND 
PLANS TO CONDUCT MORE IN COMING MONTHS.  MR. CUONG WANTS FUTURE 
RAIDS TO FOCUS ON THE REAL PROBLEMS IN VIETNAM: COMPUTER STORES 
LOADING SOFTWARE DIRECTLY ONTO HARD DRIVES AND MULTIPLE COPIES 
DISTRIBUTED THROUGH AN ORGANIZATION WITH ONLY ONE LICENSED DISK.

THE LAW FIRM, HOWEVER, BELIEVES MMB FEELS IT HAS DONE ENOUGH FOR 
MICROSOFT THIS YEAR AND WILL BE RELUCTANT TO EMBARK UPON ANOTHER 
RAID SOON. 
 
8. (SBU) COMMENT: MICROSOFT\'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORT DEMONSTRATES SOME 
OF THE COMPLEXITY IN TRYING TO DEFEND IPR RIGHTS IN VIETNAM\'S 
OVERWHELMINGLY COUNTERFEIT SOFTWARE MARKET. POST HAS LEARNED THAT 
AS MANY AS HALF OF THE SEIZED DISKS WILL BE RETURNED TO THE SHOPS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE BLANK OR CONTAIN NON-MICROSOFT SOFTWARE.  WITHOUT 
ADEQUATE TRAINING AND CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF TRADEMARK AND 
COPYRIGHT LAW, THESE RAIDS CAN ONLY BE HALF-MEASURES.  MICROSOFT 
REPRESENTATIVES EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION THAT OTHER SOFTWARE 
COMPANIES ARE NOT ACTIVELY ENFORCING THEIR IPR RIGHTS IN VIETNAM. 
THESE OTHER COMPANIES ARE CONTENT TO LET MICROSOFT CARRY THE WATER 
-- AND ALSO INCUR THE WRATH OF POTENTIAL RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. 
WHILE THE CONFLICT BETWEEN STRONG IPR ENFORCEMENT AND GOOD RETAIL 
RELATIONS REFLECTS THE ALMOST TOTAL LACK OF PURE, LEGITIMATE 
DISTRIBUTORS IN VIETNAM, MICROSOFT AND OTHER COMPANIES WILL HAVE 
TO ADDRESS THESE COMPETING GOALS MORE EFFECTIVELY BEFORE THEY CAN 
EXPECT STRONG ENFORCEMENT OR SALES.  MEANWHILE, IPR ISSUES WILL 
CONTINUE TO UNDERMINE VIETNAM\'S OWN AMBITIONS TO BECOME AN IT 
CENTER.     YAMAUCHI

LIEM (VO THANH LIEM) CLIMBED A TREE INSIDE THE COMPOUND OF 
HIS PRIVATE PAGODA FOR THE THIRD TIME IN EIGHT YEARS (SEE 
REFTEL), AFTER LOCAL AUTHORITIES GAVE HIM THREE DAYS TO 
TEAR DOWN A GATE ON HIS PROPERTY.  HE HAS THREATENED TO 
THROW HIMSELF FROM THE TREE, IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAKES 
ANY ACTION AGAINST HIS PROPERTY.  ACCORDING TO CONTACTS, 
POLICE HAVE SURROUNDED AND BARRICADED HIS PAGODA.  HOA HAO 
BELIEVERS, A SIZABLE NUMBER OF WHOM WORSHIP AT LIEM\'S 
PRIVATE PAGODA ON A REGULAR BASIS, HAVE GATHERED OUTSIDE TO 
MONITOR THE SITUATION. 
 
2.  (SBU) ON NOVEMBER 6, A HOA HAO ORGANIZATION IN THE U.S. 
NOTIFIED POST THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAD ORDERED NAM 
LIEM TO REMOVE THE GATE TO HIS PROPERTY IN AN GIANG 
PROVINCE\'S CHO MOI DISTRICT.  HOA HAO BELIEVERS HEAVILY 
POPULATE THIS DISTRICT.  TWO RESPECTED HOA HAO ELDERS IN HO 
CHI MINH CITY VERIFIED THE U.S.-ORIGINATED INFORMATION BY 
COMMUNICATING WITH SOURCES ON THE GROUND NEAR NAM LIEM\'S 
HOME.  SURPRISINGLY, NEITHER OF THE HCMC ELDERS HAD HEARD 
ABOUT THE INCIDENT UNTIL POST CONTACTED THEM.  ONE OF THE 
ELDERS REPORTED THAT LOCAL POLICE HAD VISITED HIM ON 
NOVEMBER 6 - A MOVE HE NOW INTERPRETED AS INTENDED TO 
INTIMIDATE HIM FROM TRAVELING TO AN GIANG.  THIS ELDER 
STATED THAT HE WOULD CONSIDER TAKING ACTION IF OFFICIALS 
DID ANYTHING TO HARM NAM LIEM OR REMOVE THE GATE.  HE ADDED 
THAT HOA HAO BELIEVERS IN AN GIANG WERE PREPARED TO DO THE 
SAME. 
 
3.  (SBU) NAM LIEM FIRST CLIMBED UP A TREE AND STAYED THERE 
FOR FOUR DAYS IN 1994, AFTER POLICE CAME TO ARREST HIM FOR 
CONSTRUCTING PARTS OF HIS PRIVATE PAGODA, INCLUDING THE 
                       UNCLASSIFIED

GATE, WITHOUT A BUILDING LICENSE.  HE SERVED A FOUR-YEAR 
PRISON SENTENCE FOLLOWING THAT INCIDENT, BUT NEVER REMOVED 
THE GATE.  UPON HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON, HE WELCOMED THE 
GOVERNMENT\'S RECOGNITION OF THE HOA HAO, ALTHOUGH HE LATER 
BECAME DISILLUSIONED WITH THE GVN-SANCTIONED HOA HAO 
ORGANIZATION.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, NAM LIEM WENT UP THE SAME 
TREE WITH GASOLINE AND A KNIFE IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT 
ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE HOA HAO FLAGS AND OTHER INSIGNIA FROM 
HIS GATE.  HE WAS NOT ARRESTED THE SECOND TIME, BUT 
MUTILATED HIS OWN LEG, BEFORE EVENTUALLY COMING DOWN FROM 
THE TREE VOLUNTARILY. 
 
4.  (SBU) THIS TIME, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT PROMPTED THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES TO ACT -- NAM LIEM\'S DISPLAY OF CONTROVERSIAL 
HOA HAO INSIGNIA ON HIS GATE, OR PREVIOUS CONCERNS OVER THE 
UNLICENSED CONSTRUCTION, THOUGH THE ONE CERTAINLY 
EXACERBATES THE OTHER.  (POST NOTE: PER REFTEL, PREVIOUS 
POLOFF WAS PREVENTED FROM VISITING NAM LIEM IN JUNE 2002, 
BY A GANG OF YOUNG MEN BLOCKING THE PATH TO HIS PAGODA IN A 
THREATENING MANNER.)  ALTHOUGH THE HOA HAO ELDERS IN HCMC 
ARE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION, THEY HAVE NOT 
ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE OR INQUIRIES ON OUR PART.  POST WILL 
DO ITS BEST TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION

1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  DURING A RECENT TRIP TO DAK LAK AND GIA 
LAI PROVINCES IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS, THE CONSUL GENERAL 
MET WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS 
(CRA).  IN THESE MEETINGS, CRA OFFICIALS DESCRIBED THE 
ACTIVITIES OF THE SOUTHERN EVANGELICAL CHURCH OF VIETNAM 
(SECV) IN FORWARDING APPLICATIONS FOR PROTESTANT CHURCH 
RECOGNITION; DISCUSSED CRA PLANS FOR THE UPCOMING CHRISTMAS 
SEASON; OUTLINED \"UNETHICAL\" PRACTICES ON THE PART OF SOME 
HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS; AND GAVE UPDATES ON RELIGIOUS 
ACTIVITIES IN THEIR PROVINCES.  THE CG INQUIRED ABOUT 
REPORTS OF HOUSE CHURCH CLOSINGS AND ARRESTS.  THE CRAS 
EITHER CLAIMED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEMS, OR SAID IF THE 
PROBLEM INVOLVED \"UNREGISTERED CONGREGATIONS\", IT FELL UNDER 
THE PURVIEW OF \"OTHER AGENCIES.\"  END SUMMARY. 
 
DAK LAK PROVINCE 
---------------- 
2.  (U)  EMBOFF AND CONGENOFFS MET WITH MR. VO VAN TAI, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE DAK LAK COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS (CRA) 
ON NOVEMBER 25.  PROTESTANTS IN DAK LAK BELONG EITHER TO THE 
GVN-RECOGNIZED SECV, OR THE UNREGISTERED CHRISTIAN 
FELLOWSHIP, SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS, CHRISTIAN EVANGELICAL, 
OR PENTECOSTAL SECTS.  MR. TAI DESCRIBED PROTESTANTISM IN 
DAK LAK AS HISTORICALLY TAINTED BY A \"DEGA\" POLITICAL AGENDA 
FOR AN AUTONOMOUS STATE.  HE NOTED THAT THE \"ECONOMIC 
ADVERSITY\" CAUSED BY THE PROLONGED DROP IN COFFEE PRICES 
CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS.  HE CALLED THE \"BREAKDOWN OF 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        HO CHI  01270  01 OF 03  110458Z 
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GVN, CAMBODIA, AND THE UNHCR 
UNFORTUNATE.\" 
 
3. (U)  DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI TOLD EMB/CONGENOFFS THAT AN 
SECV REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE (RC) HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED IN 
THE PROVINCE.  ITS CHARTER SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF 
FOLLOWERS, PASTOR/MISSIONARY CREDENTIALS, ETC. THAT ARE 
NEEDED IN ORDER TO REQUEST REGISTRATION AS AN SECV CHURCH. 
ACCORDING TO MR. TAI, APPLICATIONS FROM TWO CONGREGATIONS 
(ONE ETHNIC MINORITY, ONE VIETNAMESE KINH) ARE UNDER 
CONSIDERATION NOW.  THE SECV RC HAS PASSED ITS 
RECOMMENDATION TO THE CRA, WHICH WILL DO FIELD INSPECTIONS 
OF THE CONGREGATIONS AND THEN PASS ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
THE PEOPLE\'S COMMITTEE.  SINCE THESE ARE THE FIRST TWO 
APPLICATIONS THE DAK LAK CRA HAS RECEIVED, TAI SAID HE IS 
NOT CERTAIN HOW LONG THE PROCESS WILL TAKE.  HE APPEARED 
CONFIDENT, HOWEVER, THAT BY THE TIME OF A RETURN CONGENOFF 
VISIT (ANYWHERE FROM 2-6 MONTHS), THERE WOULD BE TWO NEW 
REGISTERED CHURCH CONGREGATIONS IN DAK LAK. 
 
4.  (U) FOR CHRISTMAS 2002, THE DAK LAK CRA PLANS TO MEET 
WITH THE BISHOP, PRIESTS, PASTORS AND SECV BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS (IN HCMC) TO REVIEW THE YEAR\'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN 
SOCIO-ECONOMIC POLICIES, ORDAINING NEW PRIESTS, BUILDING NEW 
FACILITIES, ETC.  ACCORDING TO CRA DIRECTOR TAI, HE 
\"COMMUNICATES CANDIDLY WITH THE RELIGIOUS DIGNITARIES\" AS TO 
WHAT GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND ALSO THE \"NOT SO GOOD.\" 
HE SAID THE DAK LAK PROVINCIAL CRA INSTRUCTS DISTRICT 
AUTHORITIES TO DO THEIR BEST TO MEET RELIGIOUS BELIEVERS\' 
EXPECTATIONS FOR HELP IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AS A MEANS 
OF CREATING \"SOME EMPATHY BETWEEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        HO CHI  01270  01 OF 03  110458Z 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS.\"  MR. TAI SAID THAT HE AND HIS COMMITTEE 
VISIT THE REGISTERED (CATHOLIC) CHURCHES WITH GIFTS DURING 
THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. 
 
5.  (U) DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI NOTED THAT SOME PROTESTANT 
HOUSE CHURCH LEADERS HAD ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN UNETHICAL 
PRACTICES.  ACCORDING TO MR. TAI, BELIEVERS HAD CALLED THE 
CRA\'S ATTENTION TO SOME PASTORS WHO HAD COLLECTED DONATIONS 
AND SPENT THEM ON THEMSELVES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR 
CONGREGATIONS.  HE ALSO STATED THAT SOME GVN-PROVIDED RELIEF 
SUPPLIES HAD BEEN DIVERTED BY A FEW PASTORS FOR THEIR 
PERSONAL USE.  HE SAID THERE WERE REPORTS THAT \"DEGA\" 
PROTESTANTS IN PARTICULAR USED DONATIONS TO PURCHASE MOBILE 
PHONES AND MOTOR VEHICLES. 
 
6.  (U) QUERIED ABOUT EVENTS IN EAKAR DISTRICT, MR. TAI SAID 
HE WAS AWARE OF TWO BUDDHIST PAGODAS THERE, BUT NO 
(RECOGNIZED) CHURCHES.  THERE IS A TEMPORARY SITE FOR 
(RECOGNIZED) CATHOLIC WORSHIP, BUT THERE IS NO SECV- 
RECOGNIZED PASTOR.  WHEN PRESSED, HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT EAKAR 
AUTHORITIES HAD CRITICIZED SOME PROTESTANT FOLLOWERS \"FOR 
BAD PRACTICES\", BUT WOULD NOT ELABORATE.  DAK LAK CRA 
CHAIRMAN TAI ACCEPTED AN UNDATED \"NON-PAPER\" LIST OF CASES 
(REF B) ALLEGEDLY INVOLVING DOZENS OF DETENTIONS, \"CHURCH 
CLOSINGS\", ETC., BUT DID NOT MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FOLLOW UP 
ON EVERY CASE.  HE DID OFFER TO BRING THE CG TO EAKAR 
DISTRICT ON HER NEXT TRIP TO DAK LAK.  (NOTE: POST WILL

MATTERS WHEN WRONGDOINGS ARE CALLED TO OUR ATTENTION.\"

GIA LAI PROVINCE 
---------------- 
9.  (U) MOVING TO GIA LAI, CG MET WITH THE DEPUTY CHAIRMAN 
OF THE COMMITTEE ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS (CRA), MR. MAI KIM 
DONG, ON NOVEMBER 26.  HE RELATED THAT AN SECV 
REPRESENTATIVE COMMITTEE (RC) HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED THERE, 
CONSISTING OF TWO ETHNIC MINORITY PASTORS AND ONE VIETNAMESE 
KINH PASTOR.  THE GIA LAI SECV RC\'S CHARTER STRESSES

\"SERVING CHRIST, THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION.\"  GIA LAI 
PROVINCE HAS THREE REGISTERED SECV \"ASSOCIATIONS\" 
(CHURCHES), WITH TWO MORE APPLICATIONS PENDING.  IN ORDER TO 
APPLY FOR RECOGNITION, A CONGREGATION MUST HAVE 100 OR MORE 
MEMBERS, BUT MR. DONG SAID HE BELIEVED THE SECV RC CHARTER 
LEFT OPEN THE POSSIBILITY FOR \"SUB-ASSOCIATIONS\" TO COMBINE 
AND APPLY.  HE ESTIMATED THAT THERE WERE 312 SUB- 
ASSOCIATIONS IN THE PROVINCES, AND SAID THEY WERE ALL 
\"OPERATING NORMALLY.\"  ACCORDING TO HIM, THERE ARE ABOUT 
94,000 PROTESTANTS IN GIA LAI. 
 
10.  (U) DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG POINTED OUT THAT WHILE \"DEGA\" 
BELIEVERS WORSHIP JESUS, THEY HAVE BROKEN WITH THE SECV RC 
AND ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZED BY THE SECV.  ACCORDING TO HIM, 
THE SECV BELIEVES HAVING \"DEGA\" MEMBERS WILL NEGATIVELY 
AFFECT THEIR OPERATIONS. 
 
11.  (U) REGARDING OTHER RECOGNIZED RELIGIOUS FOLLOWERS IN 
GIA LAI, MR. DONG COUNTED NEARLY 76,000 CATHOLICS WHO 
WORSHIP IN 40 CHURCHES.  HE TOLD EMB/CONGENOFFS THERE WERE 
TWO PRIESTS STUDYING IN THE U.S. RIGHT NOW. (NOTE: WHILE 
PRIESTS/MONKS/NUNS FROM REGISTERED RELIGIONS ARE ALLOWED TO 
TRAVEL OVERSEAS, POST KNOWS FOR A FACT THAT AT LEAST IN 
HCMC, MANY \"UNREGISTERED\" HOUSE CHURCH PASTORS REGULARLY 
TRAVEL ABROAD. END NOTE.)  BUDDHISTS IN GIA LAI NUMBER 
NEARLY 66,000.  SIXTEEN NEW PAGODAS WERE OPENED IN 2002, FOR 
TOTAL OF 70.  ACCORDING TO MR. DONG, THERE ARE 10 MONKS 
STUDYING IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA RIGHT NOW, AND 300 OTHER 
MONKS AND NUNS WHO ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF TRAINING IN GIA 
LAI PROVINCE.  HE CHARACTERIZED THE BUDDHISTS AS \"POOR

NUDGING MR. DONG TO WRAP IT UP, DONG PROCEEDED TO SAY THERE 
WERE ABOUT 1000 SEVENTH DAY ADVENTISTS AND CHRISTIAN 
EVANGELICAL BELIEVERS IN GIA LAI - SEPARATE FROM THE SECV - 
AS WELL AS ABOUT 3000 CAO DAI BELIEVERS. 
 
12.  (U) WHEN ASKED TO IDENTIFY GIA LAI\'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
FOR 2003 AND THE LONG-TERM, CRA DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG 
SIDESTEPPED THE QUESTION BY SAYING HIS COMMITTEE \"ONLY 
APPROVES PROPOSALS FROM THE SECV RC.\"  ACCORDING TO HIM, THE 
CRA ONLY DEALS WITH \"REGISTERED CHURCH PROBLEMS.  OTHER 
AGENCIES DEAL WITH UNREGISTERED CONGREGATIONS.\" 
 
13.  (U) BOTH DAK LAK CRA CHAIRMAN TAI AND GIA LAI CRA 
DEPUTY CHAIRMAN DONG APPEARED PROUD OF THE NATIONAL CRA 
PUBLISHING HOUSE, ESTABLISHED IN 1999.  MR. TAI PRODUCED A 
BROCHURE DETAILING THE DOZENS OF MATERIALS IN STOCK. 
ACCORDING TO MR. DONG, THE SECV \"HAS APPLIED\" TO HAVE THE 
NATIONAL CRA PUBLISHING HOUSE PRINT THE OLD AND NEW 
TESTAMENTS IN THE JARAI AND BAHNAR ETHNIC MINORITY 
LANGUAGES.  PROTESTANT MATERIALS AND WRITINGS BY CATHOLIC 
BISHOPS WHO PREACH IN ETHNIC MINORITY LANGUAGES ARE ALSO

------- 
14.  (SBU) BOTH MR. TAI AND MR. DONG CITED ECONOMIC 
PROBLEMS, LARGELY DUE TO THE DROP IN INTERNATIONAL COFFEE 
PRICES, AS THE CAUSE FOR ETHNIC MINORITY VILLAGERS\' POOR 
LIVING CONDITIONS.  ENSUING PROTESTS AND FLIGHTS TO CAMBODIA 
WERE INCITED BY \"HOSTILE FORCES\" IN THE U.S. (REF A). 
HOWEVER, COMPARED TO PREVIOUS VISITS, THE TONE WAS NOT AS 
STRIDENT OR HOSTILE.  ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT CHURCH 
CLOSINGS AND DETENTIONS WERE CAREFULLY WORDED TO INDICATE 
THAT THE COMMITTEES ON RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS WERE ONLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE \"RECOGNIZED\" SECV. 
 
15.  (SBU) GVN RECOGNITION OF THE SECV IN APRIL 2001 
PERMITS THE REGISTRATION OF SECV CHURCHES.  THERE HAS BEEN 
NO RUSH OF CENTRAL HIGHLANDS CONGREGATIONS TO REGISTER.  NO 
DOUBT THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS, AS DAK LAK AND GIA 
LAI PROVINCES PROCESS THEIR FIRST REGISTRANTS.  PROVINCIAL 
AUTHORITIES AND THE PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCHES ARE WARY OF 
EACH OTHER - HOW MUCH CONTROL/OVERSIGHT WILL BE EXERCISED; 
CAN THEY TRAIN ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF PASTORS; WILL THEY BE 
ALLOWED TO FOLLOW THEIR RELIGIOUS CONSCIENCES (DAK LAK\'S MR. 
TAI WAS ADAMANT THAT WHILE PRAYER IS FINE, HUNGER STRIKES 
ARE NOT).  EVEN IF THE PROVINCIAL SECV RCS HAVE DIVORCED 
THEMSELVES FROM \"DEGA\" ELEMENTS (ESPECIALLY IN GIA LAI), 
THIS DOES NOT ERASE YEARS OF ENMITY.  THE 100-MEMBER MINIMUM 
IS HARD TO ACHIEVE IN THE SPARSELY POPULATED PARTS OF THIS 
REGION, THOUGH IT APPEARS INDIVIDUAL CONGREGATIONS CAN 
COMBINE FOR LARGER NUMBERS FOR REGISTRATION PURPOSES.

WANT TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FIRST REGISTRANTS. 
THIS WILL SET UP A PROTRACTED PERIOD OF CONTENTION AND/OR

BETWEEN THE LEGAL RIGHT OF VIETNAMESE CITIZENS TO WORSHIP IN

SUBJECT:  RELIGIOUS FREEDOM: THE VIEW THROUGH THE VISA 
WINDOW 
 
1.  (SBU)  Consular associate recently interviewed a Korean 
missionary affiliated with the Global Mission Society of the 
Presbyterian Church in Korea for a nonimmigrant visa (NIV). 
The applicant, who described himself as a missionary pastor 
with an \"underground\" Protestant church, said he conducted 
services wherever he could within his geographic area of 
responsibility, which included the Central Highlands and the 
southern part of Vietnam.  While the applicant cited 
continued problems in dealing with government authorities -- 
he described Dak Lak province as a particularly difficult 
place to hold services and practice his faith -- he felt it 
was easier to conduct his work now than in the past. 
 
2.  (SBU)  NIV applicant went on to say that he had been an 
active missionary in Vietnam for about 10 years.  He lived 
here with his Korean wife and children, who attended a 
\"missionary school.\"  (Note:  His passport contained a 
number of renewed Vietnamese tourist visas, the more recent 
of which were multiple entry.)  The most difficult years 
were 1993-1995, when he and his family were under such tight 
surveillance that they considered themselves under de facto 
house arrest.  In contrast, the ever-growing number of 
worshippers throughout the communities he served today made 
him feel more comfortable in carrying out his activities. 
 
3.  (SBU)  NIV applicant came to Conoff\'s attention when he 
applied for a tourist visa to attend the 2003 Centennial 
World Mission Conference of Korean Christian immigration in 
Honolulu.  (Note:  2003 marks the 100th Anniversary of 
Korean immigration to the United States.  NIV applicant was 
trained in Korea but has connections with congregations in 
the U.S.)  While it is not uncommon for members of the 
Protestant faith to apply for NIV\'s, anecdotal evidence 
suggests that most are Baptist.  Throughout the interview, 
NIV applicant insisted on speaking English.  He eventually 
became so agitated over the presence of a Vietnamese FSN 
assisting with interpretation that the interview was moved 
to a private room. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment:  Consular associate was able to take 
advantage of a nonimmigrant visa interview to gain some 
insight into the life of a foreign Protestant missionary 
resident in HCMC.  This cable does not mean to imply that 
one pastor\'s circumstances have a broad significance for the 
religious freedom situation in Vietnam writ large.  It does 
provide some interesting perspectives on the mixture of 
restrictions, harsh pressures and considerable ability to 
worship that often seem to characterize the experience of 
clergy from unregistered or suspect religious groups.  In 
this case the pastor was clearly extremely wary of GVN 
authorities based on his own experience of hardship.  At the 
same time, despite his religious activities, he appears to 
have been able to stay in Vietnam for a long time with 
relative ease, travel widely including in sensitive areas, 
and see the numbers of his worshippers increase.

SUBJECT:  HCMC PASTORS: CHRISTMAS CELEBRATED WITHOUT 
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  Despite a stream of reports from U.S. 
sources proclaiming a new \"crackdown\" on Protestant 
worshippers in the Central Highlands and elsewhere in 
Vietnam over the Christmas holidays, conversations with well- 
connected pastors in HCMC over the past weeks revealed 
surprisingly few allegations of even harassment by the 
government.  Instead, the pastors talked of growing numbers 
of worshippers, new churches, and expansion of religious 
training programs both here and abroad.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  During a dinner with several local religious 
leaders from various Protestant denominations, none of these 
pastors polled by Poloff was aware of any specific instances 
of arrests, beatings, or interference with worship services 
over the holidays.  All said they were able to celebrate the 
holidays with their own congregations without incident, and 
believed that others outside of HCMC had done so as well. 
They spoke of hundreds of religious leaders currently 
undergoing training here and overseas. 
 
3.  (SBU)  One ethnic minority congregation leader did 
complain of police searching his home and questioning him 
just that morning.  However, he believed the incident to be 
connected with a November trip to Tien Giang province, when 
he was intercepted outside a \"church\" and detained briefly, 
before being told to return to HCMC.  The authorities then 
disbanded the assembled worshippers and confiscated a 
variety of religious and secular items. 
 
4.  (SBU)  In a separate, unrelated meeting, three Mennonite 
pastors responded that they had not heard of any specific 
examples of interference with Christmas services, but said 
they might still receive additional information from the 
provinces.  The pastors promised to arrange for direct 
meetings with sources from the Central Highlands in the 
future, rather than act as middlemen.  The pastors said the 
Mennonites had recently sent religious workers to Gia Lai 
and Dak Lak provinces to try to \"rally\" hundreds of house 
churches that had \"become scattered\" over the past five 
months.  Ethnic minority religious leaders, however, \"seemed 
scared.\"  Because this five-month time period would coincide 
with reports of arrests in the Central Highlands during 
August-September 2002, Poloff pressed for details. The 
pastors, however, described the general climate of 
harassment faced by all unregistered house churches. 
 
5.  (SBU)  The Mennonite pastors did provide Post with news 
of the December 27 arrest of a missionary near HCMC, but no 
details on why he was arrested.  Photographs show dozens of 
people gathered around a police vehicle as uniformed 
officers take the missionary into custody.  Later 
photographs purport to show the missionary after he was 
returned from custody beaten and unconscious.  The photos 
depict him lying on the floor, with one of the pastors 
standing over him with a clearly marked first aid kit.  The 
missionary has since recovered, according to the pastor. 
(Post note: To the untrained eye at least, the police in the 
photos do not appear to be using excessive force.  Poloff 
will try to follow up with the missionary directly.) 
 
6.  (SBU)  One of the pastors also provided photographic 
evidence of a police search of his home in December.  These 
photographs show uniformed police officers asking questions 
and taking notes.  The pastor believes this incident might 
have been related to his failed attempt to register as the 
legal representative for three relatives of Father Ly, who 
were detained in June 2001.  (Post note: Father Ly, who was 
sentenced to a total of 15 years imprisonment for \"damaging 
national unity\" in October 2001, remains a controversial 
figure even within the Catholic Church here.)  The same 
pastor also mentioned that he was working toward opening a 
training center on law and human rights. 
 
7.  (SBU)  According to the three Mennonite pastors, the GVN 
continues to \"watch and prohibit.\"  They claimed that two 
other pastors who had returned from training in Thailand 
late last year were apprehended by police and injected with 
poison.  The two had subsequently \"lost their memories\" and 
are currently under the care of their followers, being no 
longer able to fulfill their pastoral duties.  (Post note: 
Post will attempt to verify this story, as the pastors 
acknowledged they were giving Poloff a second/third-hand 
account.)  In an aside, the pastors said that \"local 
governments\" in the Central Highlands had \"opposed and 
threatened\" Deputy Prime Minister Dung during a recent visit 
there. 
 
8.  (SBU)  The pastors had no statistics for what they 
proudly described as a steadily growing number of 
worshippers, but said there are 1500 Mennonite house 
churches throughout the country.  The pastors are also 
attempting to revive a Christian Boy Scout program in 
Vietnam.  This program would be independent of any umbrella 
organization, and, presumably, unrecognized here.  The 
pastors are close to naming 12 troop leaders, including five 
who had served in that capacity before the organization was 
disbanded in 1975.  They cited great interest among members 
of the Christian community. 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  Post accepts that much of this 
information is anecdotal.  The fact that some have been able 
to worship peacefully does not mean all enjoy the same 
opportunity, which is why we do not generalize about 
religious practice in the Central Highlands.  Still, it is 
noteworthy that none of these religious leaders (who have 
been consistent sources of information critical of GVN human 
rights violations in the past) complained of government 
repression over the holidays.  This does not preclude the 
possibility that additional information may surface later, 
but offers a counterpoint to some of the more inflammatory 
charges generated by other sources.

SUBJECT: FATHERLAND FRONT HOLDS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST 
IRAQ WAR 
 
1.  Summary.  On February 19 the Fatherland Front of Vietnam (FFV)- 
-the umbrella organization for Communist Party mass organizations 
in Vietnam--coordinated a peaceful and orderly demonstration 
inside the Friendship Association House across the street from 
ConGen to show opposition to a war with Iraq.  The meeting lasted 
exactly two hours, was attended by mostly middle-aged party 
members, and was orderly and quiet.  The event, which was reported 
in the press, was a carefully controlled expression designed to 
show public support for the current position of the Communist 
Party of Vietnam.  End summary. 
 
2. Approximately 500 Vietnamese were assembled in GVN official 
vehicles and brought to the Friendship Association House on Le 
Duan street, across from ConGen, at 7:00 am.  Both uniformed and 
plain clothes police were present.  The rally began with a series 
of brief speeches and concluded with the last speaker leading the 
audience in repeating the phrases: \"Oppose the war in Iraq,\" 
\"Support a stable peace in the Middle East,\" and \"Solidarity and 
friendship between the Vietnamese and Iraqi people.\"  The room 
contained several banners with the same messages, as well as \"The 
U.S.-British coalition should not cause war against the Iraqi 
people.\" 
 
3.  The rally was organized under the FFV by the Youth 
Association, but participants came from across the spectrum of 
mass organizations in Ho Chi Minh City, including labor and 
religious organizations.  The Youth Association reportedly held 
its own rally in HCMC the evening of February 18, where they 
collected over 1000 signatures on a banner they plan to send to 
the U.S. Ambassador in Hanoi.  The February 19 event was filmed by 
the national television station and reported in the press.  There 
were also press reports about the February 18 Youth Association 
rally. 
 
4.  Poloff and RSO spoke with some of the protesters after the 
meeting had adjourned promptly at 9:00 am.  All said that they had 
been invited by the FFV on February 18.  The presidents of two of 
the mosques in Ho Chi Minh City added that they had no ill 
feelings towards American citizens, the USG, or the ConGen, but 
that they had sympathy with the Iraqi people as victims of a war 
led by the USG, and that they believed the USG and the U.K. should 
use their power to create peace, not war.  The Buddhist monk 
speaking at the rally also said that the USG should not act on its 
own but work with the Security Council to ensure that Iraq 
satisfies the conditions in UNSC Resolution 1441.  (Note:  None of 
them raised economic concerns, although under the oil for food 
program  Iraq was the biggest importer of Vietnamese rice in 2002, 
buying 871,800 metric tons, or about 27 percent of Vietnam\'s total 
rice exports.  End Note.) 
 
5.  Comment.  The Fatherland Front periodically orchestrates 
meetings of this kind to publicly reflect the views of the 
Communist Party. It is therefore interesting to note that the 
whole event was done on a small scale and in a quiet and orderly 
fashion.  There was also a relatively large representation from Ho 
Chi Minh City\'s normally apolitical Muslim community: there are 
only 5,000 Muslims in Ho Chi Minh City\'s population of roughly 7 
million, the 25 Muslims in attendance represented 5 percent of the 
crowd at the rally.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: A LONG TIME COMING: PROTESTANT SEMINARY OPENS IN HCMC 
 
 
1.  (U)  In keeping with longstanding GVN promises to allow the 
opening of a new Protestant seminary, the leaders of the Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) recently inaugurated their 
new Institute of Bible and Theology before a crowd numbering close 
to 1000 at their main HCMC church.  (Classes will be held there 
temporarily until they receive approval for a separate campus.) 
The four-hour opening ceremony followed the basic outlines of a 
religious service, complete with hymns, prayers and sermons.  The 
only government official to speak was a representative of the 
Religious Affairs Committee, who read the decision authorizing the 
seminary.  Significantly, there was no other mention of the 
government during the remainder of the ceremony.  None of the 
speakers even acknowledged the government officials who attended 
the ceremony during their remarks, normally common practice in 
Vietnam. 
 
2.  (U)  The gathering was presided over by Acting SECV President 
Duong Thanh, a former Vice President who assumed office after the 
death of Reverend Pham Xuan Thieu in June 2002.  Among the many 
other speakers was an elderly, frail, and nearly blind former Vice 
Director of the pre-1975 Protestant seminary in Nha Trang, who 
delivered a fiery 20-minute sermon in a booming voice.  Those in 
attendance included a sprinkling of GVN and local officials, the 
SECV hierarchy, administrators from the seminary, and the first 50 
seminarians, many of whom had yet to be formally accepted by the 
GVN for admission.  Pastors, religious workers, and lay believers 
(some from distant provinces) made up the remainder of the crowd, 
which flowed out the main doors and down the stairs to the street. 
A handful of American religious workers outfitted with headphones 
for simultaneous interpretation were seated in the first few rows, 
next to a congratulatory flower wreath from the Fatherland Front. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Poloff recognized a number of non-SECV-affiliated 
pastors in the crowd, including some who have been generally 
critical of the recognized church for \"selling out\" to the 
government.  Most openly greeted Poloff in the aisles before and 
after the ceremony.  They said they regarded the seminary opening 
as a positive step, and one that should be publicly endorsed. 
Most had faith in the strength of the academic program as a 
grooming ground for future religious leaders, but doubted the 
program could be kept free of GVN control.  (Post note:  Classes 
began on February 17.  As of March 10, 38 of the promised 50 
students were enrolled, with only ten having received the required 
permission from their local authorities.  End note.)  While Pastor 
Thanh drew some praise for maintaining his patience and integrity 
in a difficult job, the SECV itself seemed to be viewed in a much 
more critical light by the unaffiliated house pastors. 
 
4.  (SBU)  During the lunch for 300-plus pastors/religious workers 
after the ceremony, several pastors with whom ConGenoffs spoke -- 
including those from the Central Highlands and adjacent coastal 
provinces -- seemed unconvinced this was a milestone in the 
overall context of religious freedom in Vietnam.  They described 
the general situation as somewhat improved over past years, but 
still highly problematic in certain locations.  Yet none could 
offer any firsthand accounts of harassment or oppression over the 
recent Christmas season.  They acknowledged they had been able to 
celebrate the holidays with their own congregations without 
government interference, even if they had heard second or 
thirdhand of problems in some of the more sensitive areas.  Some 
pastors said they had been required to obtain permission from 
their local authorities to attend this opening ceremony.  Others 
said they had decided to come even though they had never received 
permission.  (Post note: This inconsistency tracks with our 
general experience that enforcement of many -- if not most -- 
government regulations varies from province to province, even 
district to district, in the South.  End note.) 
 
5.  (U)  In the course catalogue for the new seminary, the English 
translation notes that the old Nha Trang Bible and Theological 
Institute was closed in December 1976 for political reasons.  The 
original Vietnamese says that classes were simply interrupted, 
without giving a reason why.  There is also a requirement that all 
seminarians study \"Citizen Education.\"  The course description in 
English notes that \"understanding of religious policy will help 
students know how to lead local congregations well.\" 
 
6.  (SBU)  Comment:  The long-awaited opening of a recognized 
Protestant seminary is a significant step in the development of 
the Protestant church in southern Vietnam.  That the inaugural 
ceremony was carried out in such a public manner, with widespread 
press coverage, is not surprising -- the GVN was happy to take 
credit for a good news story on religious freedom.  (GVN officials 
sat through this four-hour ceremony, even though they were openly 
stiffed.)  The fact that \"illegal\" house pastors made their 
presence unabashedly known, were genuinely complimentary about the 
seminary, and warmly greeted ConGenoffs, is indicative of the 
complexities and inconsistencies surrounding their criticism of 
GVN religious policies.  These house pastors agree that the 
opening of a Protestant seminary is a small but positive step down 
the long road toward SECV legitimacy in the eyes of \"all 
believers.\"

SUBJECT: MENNONITES TURN UP THE VOLUME ON COMPLAINTS OF 
PERSECUTION 
 
REF:  HCMC 0111 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  In a flurry of conversations with ConGenoffs over the 
past week, a Mennonite church leader and several of his colleagues 
have lodged serious complaints of stepped-up religious repression 
by government officials.  The allegations include arrests, 
beatings, destruction of property, and six cases of poisoning. 
The pastors also asked for assistance in following up on three 
possible POW/MIA cases.  Post is endeavoring to verify the more 
specific allegations, but finds some of them initially more 
credible than others.  However, this pastor has accurately 
reported on specific incidents of GVN harassment in the past.  The 
Mennonites currently claim ten pastors serving 10,000 believers 
nationwide. 
 
------------------------------ 
Increased Surveillance in HCMC 
------------------------------ 
 
2.  (SBU)  Last week, Post\'s primary contact on Mennonite issues 
initiated a rather hurried conversation with an FSN he had met in 
the past.  When they met in a coffee shop the next day, he 
explained that his activities were being closely monitored and he 
didn\'t feel comfortable mentioning any foreign names.  In addition 
to the claims of around-the-clock surveillance, he believed that 
local gangs were cooperating with the police to intimidate him. 
As proof, he pointed to four vehicular accidents in the past two 
weeks, including one incident where the other driver had yelled: 
\"Go to hell.  You\'re dead.\"  Two local police had recently visited 
him at home to tell him that he was being closely watched.  The 
officers left with sinister threats to return in force, once their 
superiors had given them the green light. 
 
-------------------------- 
Border Guard Turned Pastor 
-------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU)  A day after this secretive meeting with FSN, the same 
pastor and a colleague apparently felt comfortable enough to meet 
with Poloff at the Consulate General.  He had visited the ConGen 
just a few weeks earlier with several other pastors as well 
(reftel).  This time, he brought along a Mennonite leader from the 
Central Highlands.  This other pastor had been a member of the 
border police until losing his job for sympathizing with 
Christians in 1989.  (His former boss, a Colonel, lost his job in 
1990 for the same reason.)  Since 2000, he had been working 
closely within the Mennonite movement in Dak Lak, Kon Tum, and Gia 
Lai.  He claimed that the provincial authorities had encouraged 
him to register his churches, only to reject the applications 
without explanation. 
 
4.  (SBU)  The Central Highlands pastor had been detained and 
beaten several times over the last 13 years for his religious 
activities.  (He casually remarked that police had beaten him 
about the face two days earlier, although ConGenoffs did not 
observe any marks or bruises, or difficulty in speaking.) 
Moreover, the government had repeatedly refused his applications 
for a residency permit and ID.  (Both pastors asked the ConGen to 
confront provincial authorities on this issue.)  Pressure on his 
Mennonite congregations had forced them to disperse, something he 
was trying to reverse.  In February of this year, police had 
disrupted a service at his home and confiscated religious articles 
and several motorcycles.  (He intimated that the motorcycles may 
have been improperly registered.)  The worshippers were able to 
convince the police not to arrest him, but he was forced to move. 
The house where he now lived with his relatives was under 
extremely close surveillance.  Local officials had threatened to 
prevent the children of those relatives from sitting for the 
national university entrance examination as long as he remained in 
their home. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Repression in the Central Highlands 
----------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  The two pastors elaborated on a host of charges over 
the past week, including claims that government officials 
continued to beat and threaten Protestant Banar, Ede, and Gia Rai 
ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands in an effort to 
suppress their religious beliefs.  They accused the GVN of sending 
in military forces to reinforce local police units in enforcing 
restrictions, and pointed to an organized campaign to promote the 
restoration of traditional, ritualistic (i.e., not Christian) 
practices.  While they were short on specifics, and many of the 
abuses cited occurred as long as two years ago, they did offer to 
provide proof.  Unfortunately, their offers to provide evidence in 
the past have sometimes failed to materialize. 
 
6.  (SBU)  In one particular case, the pastors asked ConGen to 
intercede on behalf of over 450 Hmong ethnic minority families who 
had moved from Son La in the North to Dak Lak over the past year 
to escape arrest and persecution for their religious beliefs.  The 
new migrants had reportedly asked the pastors if they should 
resort to using violent means, behavior that the pastors claimed 
to have discouraged as unchristian.  The pastors were proud to say 
that, while the GVN was convinced of their involvement in some of 
the ethnic violence that has plagued the Central Highlands over 
the past two years, they had never pursued such methods.  When 
asked if the congregations were apolitical or non-FULRO, however, 
they were quick to add that while they had never sought out former 
FULRO members for their church, they had never discriminated 
against them either.  In fact, they proudly claimed to have 
trained \"both former FULRO members and CPV cadres to become 
leaders of Mennonite congregations.\" 
 
---------------------------- 
A New Province is Heard From 
---------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  The pastors made quite specific claims of GVN 
mistreatment of 700 Xtieng ethnic minority households in Binh 
Phuoc Province, located along the Cambodian border.  According to 
the pastors, nearly 3000 Xtieng in Loc Ninh District had been 
encouraged by the GVN to register their seven Mennonite \"sub- 
associations\" (house churches).  Instead of legal recognition, 
however, they had incurred greater repression in the form of 
arrests and beatings.  Recently, police and military units had 
bulldozed over 100 hectares of rice fields, leaving the villagers 
to live on just four meals per week.  The pastors promised to 
provide photographs. 
 
8.  (SBU)  In between the two meetings at the ConGen, the pastors 
somehow managed to attend a conference in Loc Ninh that had been 
in the planning stages for some time.  While 150 village leaders 
were able to gather, police prevented another 150 from reaching 
the site.  (In an interesting footnote, the pastors noted that 
police who had ringed the area throughout the meeting were invited 
to join the villagers for lunch while the pastors slipped away.) 
They acknowledged that some of the villagers were \"former FULRO 
members,\" and that the Mennonites had used the village in the past 
as a training site. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Troubling Allegations of Poisonings 
----------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU)  The pastors cited six cases of poisonings by government 
agents.  Three of the six were pastors who had been imprisoned in 
Buon Me Thuot in late 2002 and were now dead.  Three other ethnic 
minority religious workers from Kon Tum had lost their memories 
and ability to function after government agents posing as visitors 
from their home villages had poisoned them in Cambodia.  They were 
now living with their families in Pleiku, where the pastors 
claimed to visit them regularly.  (Their local interpreter, also 
an ethnic minority pastor, is a former FULRO member.)  The pastors 
asked for ConGen assistance in arranging blood tests, because they 
were certain they could arrange for ConGenoffs to meet with the 
victims in either HCMC or Pleiku.  Both pastors pointed out that 
such acts of poisoning were common in the Quang Ngai area, the 
home province of several government officials in the Central 
Highlands. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Testing the Waters on POW/MIA Issues 
------------------------------------ 
 
10.  (SBU)  The pastors shared information and photographs they 
had received from various sources purporting to show the remains 
of two American servicemen in the Dalat area.  They had also been 
in contact with someone who claimed to know of an American 
serviceman living with his Vietnamese wife and children in the 
area between Lam Dong and Binh Thuan provinces.  (ConGen is 
already aware of a similar-sounding case that the Joint Task Force- 
Full Accounting investigated last year.)  The pastors expressed 
deep concern that possession of this information might cause 
serious problems for them and their sources.  Poloff promised to 
put the sources in direct contact with someone from JTF-FA at 
Embassy Hanoi. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
11.  (SBU)  Much of the information provided by these two contacts 
contains sufficient detail to be verifiable, but gaining access to 
some of the sites and individuals described will be easier said 
than done.  While some of the information on poisonings appears to 
be new and troubling, most responsible observers have already 
debunked a similar story about three fatal poisonings in Dak Lak. 
The fact that they didn\'t know the names of the three surviving 
victims was inconsistent with their claims to have visited the men 
regularly now, and been their spiritual guides in the past.  Also 
startling was the emphasis on efforts to legalize the status of 
Mennonite sub-associations, a 180-degree reversal of their policy 
to oppose any accommodation with the GVN.  More troubling was the 
open flaunting of FULRO connections (as \"former\" as they may be), 
i.e., the frequent references to FULRO members and violence. 
 
12.  (SBU)  While we have enjoyed a generally good relationship 
with Mennonite leaders in the past, the sudden spike in the level 
of histrionics over the past few weeks, coupled with the apparent 
policy reversal on seeking legal recognition and sudden interest 
in POW/MIA cases, leaves Post to wrestle with interesting 
questions of veracity and motive.  Certainly, for the level of 
surveillance they claim to be under, these individuals seem very 
comfortable with coming to the ConGen and traveling widely 
throughout some of the more sensitive regions in the South.  The 
Mennonites have asked the USG to go to bat for them on all of 
these issues and promised to provide evidence.  For now, Post will 
attempt to verify as much of the information as possible and raise 
appropriate points with the relevant local authorities.

SUBJECT: COMMUNIST YOUTH ORGANIZATION HOLDS PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION 
AGAINST IRAQ WAR 
 
 
1.  Summary:  The HCMC Youth Union organized a boisterous, but 
peaceful demonstration by more than 5000 high school and college 
students at the District One Youth Center on March 17.  The rally 
featured speakers and musical performances to appeal to the kind 
of young audience which frequents the Youth Center for cultural 
events.  Part of an ongoing peaceful campaign of mass organization 
demonstrations against going to war in Iraq, the two-hour 
gathering was well planned and organized, and received extensive 
national press coverage.  End summary. 
 
2.  The Youth Center, located just two blocks from the U.S. 
Consulate, was packed with young people carrying banners made of 
red bunting lettered with anti-war slogans, as well as cut-out 
letters spelling N-O-W-A-R, and hand-drawn posters with images and 
slogans in English like, \"Peace For Iraq\", \"No War\", and \"Stop 
Bombing.\"  The mood was boisterous, as protestors jumped up and 
down and swayed their signs to the beat of the music, but under 
control.  The rally started at 6:00 pm and ended promptly at 8:00 
pm, with participants collecting piles of white birds folded from 
paper, symbolizing peace. 
 
3.  As with other demonstrations we have seen (reftel) -- 
demonstrations in Vietnam are almost always organized by Communist 
Party mass organizations, like the Youth Union -- the speeches 
outlined Vietnam\'s oft-repeated anti-war policy.  The event was 
filmed by the national television station and carried by the three 
newspapers with the largest readership in Vietnam (Saigon Giai 
Phong, Thanh Nien and Tuoi Tre). 
 
4.  On March 18, ConGen received a fax from the Fatherland Front 
Committee of the province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau addressed to the 
governments of the U.S. and the U.K.  The letter said that the 
people of Ba Ria-Vung Tau had suffered during the Vietnam War and 
empathized with the people of Iraq.  The Committee had organized a 
meeting the day before and decided to send this letter advocating 
the same points raised in reftel, as well as asking for an end to 
the economic embargo against Iraq and more time for the UN weapons 
inspections team to ensure that Iraq complies with UNSCR 1441. 
 
5.  Comment:  This is not the first example of the Communist Party 
of Vietnam organizing a demonstration to show public support for 
its policy positions, but it seemed to be one of the more genuine 
outpourings of peaceful concern.  Nearly 70 percent of the 
population of Ho Chi Minh City is under 30 years-old, and most 
students can easily be mobilized to attend these events through 
school networks and busing.  In this case, many of the banners 
were in English, though next day press reports noted only two 
Westerners in attendance.  In a country where opportunities for 
public expression are extremely limited and orchestrated, this may 
have been one occasion where GVN official policy actually 
reflected sentiments close to the students\' own.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM IPR ENFORCEMENT SUCCESS STORY:  NIKE 
COUNTERFEITER LOSES BIG 
 
REF:  02 HCMC 934 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  In an IPR enforcement success story, the Ho Chi Minh City 
Economic Police have wrapped up a case against a major 
counterfeiter of Nike footwear.  Although fines relating to IPR 
violations were nominal, local authorities assessed substantial 
fines for tax evasion and confiscated supplies and production 
equipment.  These fines and forfeitures amount to more than 
US$160,000.  Nike had high praise for the Economic Police, but 
faulted the People\'s Procurator in Ho Chi Minh City for dragging 
its feet. 
 
Nike Counterfeiter Raided in Summer 2002 
---------------------------------------- 
2.  In July 2002 the Ho Chi Minh City Economic Police raided a 
workshop producing high quality counterfeit Nike shoes and other 
famous brands. The raid, as reported in reftel, resulted in the 
seizure of 23 truckloads of fake components, supplies, and 
production equipment.  The case had been initiated at the request 
of Nike, which had been compiling information on this enterprise 
for about a year.  This producer had been targeted by Nike because 
the operation appeared to be large and was producing high quality 
fakes.  Interestingly, the case came to the attention of Nike 
through a tip from another (rival) counterfeiter. 
 
Follow up reveals national network with large turnover 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
3.  Following up on the raid, the police found a national 
distribution network with retail outlets in Hanoi, Haiphong, and 
Danang.  The police traced bank transfers of funds indicating that 
the business generated revenues equivalent to at least US$100,000 
for the 18 months leading up to the raids.  Even with all of this 
evidence, however, authorities decided that they could not 
prosecute this case as a criminal case.  The raid netted 23 
truckloads of production equipment and supplies, but only 47 pairs 
of counterfeit Nike shoes.  Because the value of actual 
counterfeit products was so low, the police, along with the 
People\'s Procurator\'s Office, determined that the case had to be 
handled as an administrative matter.  In an administrative case, 
local authorities only have the power to assess limited fines and 
confiscate equipment, product and supplies.  In a criminal case, 
the case would be heard in court and fines could be higher and 
jail terms could be handed down. 
 
Let the Punishment Fit the Crime 
-------------------------------- 
4.  This did not stop local authorities from taking full advantage 
of their authority to assess administrative penalties in this 
case.  These fines and forfeitures were spelled out in a decision 
from the local District People\'s Committee dated February 25, 
2003.  The actual fine based on IPR was very low- only VND 500,000 
(about US$325).  The real penalties were assessed in other areas. 
The local Taxation Department imposed a penalty of VND 132,319,000 
(about US$8600) for back taxes and tax evasion. 
 
5.  The District People\'s Committee also authorized the permanent 
confiscation of the production equipment seized in the raid.  This 
included: 
-    US$26,000 worth of production equipment 
-    US$$19,500 worth of synthetic leather (2078 kilograms) 
-    US$1200 worth of cement (ten tanks) 
 According to Nike, this equipment and the supplies will be sold 
and revenue turned over to the state budget. 
 
6.  The police were also granted authority to destroy components 
seized in the raid.  These included: 
-    $117,000 worth of fake Nike shoe components (completed uppers 
and unit soles) which could be used to make 15,000 pairs of fake 
Nike shoes. 
-    Additional components that could be used to manufacture 
counterfeits of other name-brand sport shoes. 
 
7.  These penalties are impressively large.  They are even more 
impressive when considering that the individual who owned this 
operation is a relative of a powerful People\'s Committee chairman 
in a neighboring district.  This appears not to have influenced 
the progress of the case.  Nike reports, however, that the 
counterfeiter may be trying to set up another operation to produce 
counterfeit goods in another district in the city.  Nike plans to 
monitor developments closely and work with local police to follow 
up. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8.  While one such event does not indicate a sea change in the 
difficult IPR environment here, this case - in which a politically 
connected individual was made to pay dearly for flagrant 
production of counterfeit goods - is good news indeed.  Nike 
praised the work of the Economic Police, although Nike\'s expert on 
counterfeiting stated that he felt the People\'s Procurator were 
slow to respond to the case.  Nike has no illusions about the IPR 
climate in Vietnam, but hopes to build on this case for further 
cooperation with local authorities.  Post will follow up with 
local authorities to compliment the Economic Police on their 
handling of this case.

SUBJECT: DR. QUE UNDER DETENTION 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Poloff visited the home of democracy activist Dr. 
Nguyen Dan Que on March 18 to confirm reports of his arrest 
received earlier that day.  Based on the information originally 
provided by his brother in the U.S., and now confirmed by his 
wife, it appears that a large number of security officers hustled 
Dr. Que off to the local District 5 police station at 8:00 p.m. on 
March 17.  He was arrested in front of his home, without being 
given an opportunity to go inside and retrieve additional clothing 
or medications.  The arresting officers on the scene accused him 
of being on his way to an Internet cafe to publish criticisms of 
the GVN.  Police returned to Que\'s home in force just before 
midnight the same day to search through his possessions.  They 
removed his computer and cell phone, as well as assorted documents 
and written materials.  Several officers took still photographs 
and video footage during the search. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The long, unlit alley leading to Dr. Que\'s home 
appeared largely deserted when Poloff arrived at 7:30 p.m. on 
March 18.  Dr. Que\'s wife opened the door only long enough to 
quickly usher Poloff inside.  She appeared quite nervous and 
agitated throughout the conversation.  At one point, she sent a 
relative out to photocopy the investigation report signed by the 
police and family members upon completion of the search.  Post now 
has a copy of that report.  Dr. Que\'s stepson had been brought to 
the police station at 1:30 a.m. that morning to sign the report 
and to obtain a legal record of what had been taken from his home. 
Dr. Que\'s brother surmised that Dr. Que must have 
characteristically insisted on the police producing a legal 
document to entitle them to search.  Fortunately, the stepson was 
able to see Dr. Que at the time he signed the document.  Police 
later informed Dr. Que\'s wife that her husband had been moved to 
the municipal jail in District 1, and allowed her to send clothing 
and medicine.  Dr. Que\'s wife did not know why the authorities had 
decided to detain her husband at this time.  She speculated that 
it must have had something to do with one of his interviews with 
the foreign news media, including Radio Free Asia.  His brother 
thought it might have something to do with Dr. Que\'s recent 
criticism of GVN claims of a free press in Vietnam. 
 
3.  (SBU)  During the conversation, Dr. Que\'s wife made clear that 
she and her husband would appreciate any representations by the 
Consulate General, in the hopes of gaining his release or 
improving his treatment.  She expressed concern that he had not 
been feeling very well before this latest incident.  (Post note: 
Dr. Que is an endocrinologist and has been self-medicating an 
ulcer and kidney ailments for a long time.  His brother sends him 
medication from the U.S. from time to time.  End note.)  Post will 
follow up with the relevant local authorities. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Comment:  Dr. Que and his family have occasionally 
raised exaggerated alarm bells in the past, but this incident 
would seem to be the real thing.  Just why the GVN would choose to 
raise the stakes with a well-known figure like Dr. Que at this 
time is not clear, given that he has been consistently outspoken 
in his views over a period of time.  It may be as simple (naive?) 
as his brother\'s assumption that hardliners in the GVN hope the 
USG would be otherwise distracted by events in Iraq.

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PRESS GUIDANCE ON DR. QUE\'S DETENTION 
 
REF:  HCMC 259 
 
1.  (SBU)  Post has notified the HCMC External Relations Office 
(ERO), the local branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of its 
interest in the case of Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, who was detained in 
HCMC on March 17 (reftel).  We have also requested MFA assistance 
in obtaining additional information on the circumstances of his 
detention and general medical condition.  As of COB March 19, the 
ERO was able to confirm only the basic facts as reported reftel. 
They were unable to provide any further clarification on the 
current status of his case, but have promised to continue to seek 
answers on our behalf in the morning.  Post will continue to press 
for additional details. 
 
2.  (SBU)  In a telephone conversation with Dr. Que\'s wife the 
afternoon of March 19, she said that she had gone to the Municipal 
Jail today with food, clothing, and medication.  While she had 
been allowed to leave the articles there for Dr. Que, she had not 
been permitted to meet with him.  When she requested an 
opportunity to meet with the Director of the facility, she was 
told that he was in meetings all day.  She plans to return on 
March 20.  In an interesting footnote, an official at the ERO 
mentioned twice today that Post probably had better first-hand 
information on what had happened than the MFA, a likely reference 
to Poloff\'s visit to Dr. Que\'s home the previous evening. 
 
3.  (U)  Should the need arise, Post recommends the following 
press guidance, on an \"if asked\" basis: 
 
4.  (U)  Begin Press Guidance:  The local office of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs in Ho Chi Minh City has confirmed that Dr. 
Nguyen Dan Que is currently under detention in Ho Chi Minh City. 
The Consulate General has advised the Ministry of its strong 
interest in the case and asked for additional information on the 
specific circumstances of this prominent democracy activist\'s 
detention.  The Consulate General is unable to speculate on the 
reasons for his detention at this time. 
 
5.  (U)  Begin background:  Dr. Que, an endocrinologist, is HCMC\'s 
best-known political dissident.  He was taken to the local police 
station from his home at 8:00 p.m. Tuesday evening, March 18, and 
transferred to the Municipal Jail the following day.  While in 
detention, his home was searched and a number of his possessions 
seized.  His current legal status is not clear. 
 
6.  (U)  Background continued:  Dr. Que is 60 years old.  He was 
imprisoned from 1978 to 1988, but was never charged or tried for 
any crime.  In 1990, he was again imprisoned, this time after 
being convicted of attempting to overthrow the government (for 
writing and disseminating pro-democracy materials).  He was 
sentenced to 20 years imprisonment to be followed by 5 years house 
arrest.  He was released in a September 1998 amnesty (the first 
prisoner amnesty that saw the release of significant numbers of 
political prisoners). 
 
7.  (U)  Background continued:  Since his release, Dr. Que has 
faced varying degrees of harassment, including steady surveillance 
and monitoring of his activities and communications.  His Internet 
and telephone access is regularly restricted.  Dr. Que suffers 
from a bleeding ulcer and an unspecified kidney ailment, both of 
which require medication.

SUBJECT: HCMC BUSINESSES SEE LIMITED ECONOMIC IMPACT FROM WAR IN 
IRAQ 
 
REF:  A) STATE 72824   B) HCMC 00196 C) HCMC 257 
 
Summary 
------- 
 
1.  As U.S. forces launched the first strikes against Iraq, 
government and business leaders in HCMC were still largely 
uncertain what effect the war would have on the local economy. 
Initial reports from some sectors, such as hotels, energy, and 
banking, appeared to indicate only short-term jitters, rather than 
long-term fears.  Companies that rely on trade with the Gulf 
States, on the other hand, had the most to lose, and were most 
concerned with the duration and severity of the conflict. 
 
2.  Government officials in HCMC hesitated to comment on possible 
effects of the war in Iraq, deferring questions to the central 
government in Hanoi.  However, representatives from two large 
state-owned companies said they thought the conflict wouldn\'t last 
long enough for them to worry about any prolonged impact.  That 
sentiment seemed to be echoed throughout much of the rest of the 
business community as well.  One prominent American businessman 
described the region as \"well-insulated\" from the conflict.  He 
hadn\'t heard of many people changing their business plans or 
operations, and hadn\'t changed his own plans to travel to Europe 
with a delegation of Vietnamese officials in April. 
 
OCCUPANCY DROPPING AS PEOPLE FEAR DROPLETS, NOT WAR 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
3.  While the recent outbreak of Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
(SARS) in the region (ref A) was something of a concern for 
business and leisure travelers to HCMC, few were concerned that 
the war in Iraq would unsettle this otherwise stable tourist 
destination (ref B).  The hotel industry in HCMC has seen a 
decline in reservations and an increase in cancellations over the 
past two weeks.  However, the management at two of the city\'s 
leading hotels stated that a number of cancellations were due to 
fear of  contracting SARS, even though there have been very few 
suspected cases of the illness in HCMC.  Cancellations were having 
the most serious impact on hotels that catered to business 
travelers and conferences.  Occupancy at the New World Hotel this 
week fell from 98 to 60 percent, while rates at the Caravelle fell 
from 90 to 70 percent.  The impact on others was less significant. 
Occupancy at the Omni Saigon fell from 92 to 85 percent. 
 
HUMANITARIAN RICE EXPORTS HALTED 
-------------------------------- 
 
4.  Vietnam was expected to export up to one million tons of rice, 
valued at US$400 million, to Iraq this year under the UN\'s oil-for- 
food programs.  With annual rice export turnover of three million 
tons, this figure would have represented a full third of all rice 
exports from Vietnam.  The oil-for-food program has been suspended 
during the current military action.  According to Mrs. Cao Thi 
Ngoc Hoa, Deputy General Director of Vietnam Southern Food 
Corporation, her corporation was notified to suspend all rice 
shipments until further notice two days ago.  Ms. Hoa anticipated 
that if the program did not resume, her company would have to 
lower its sale price to sell the rice to another market. 
 
MILK EXPORTS TO IRAQ 
-------------------- 
 
5.  Vinamilk, the major state-owned producer of milk in Vietnam, 
normally exports 10 percent of its products to Iraq as powdered 
milk under the oil-for-food program, generating annual income of 
approximately US$60 million.  While these shipments have also 
stopped, officials at Vinamilk believe the conflict will be short- 
lived.  In the meantime, they felt there were several other 
foreign markets that would buy powdered Vinamilk products. 
 
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PRICES RISING 
-------------------------------- 
 
6.  In reaction to the increase in the global price of crude oil 
in 2003 (from US$26.70 to US$37.66 a barrel by the end of 
February, an increase of US$10.96 a barrel, or 41 percent), the 
GVN reduced the automobile gas import tax from 10 percent to 0. 
Nevertheless, leaded and unleaded gas prices have still risen by 6- 
7 percent, affecting all industries that rely on fossil fuels for 
transportation.   According to Ms. Hai Ly, a reporter for the 
Saigon Times Group, the cost of shipping one ton of commodities 
from Vietnam to the Middle East and Africa has increased from 
US$56 to US$100.  Vietnam Airlines has increased its projected 
spending on gasoline from VND1,800 billion (approximately US$117 
million) to VND2,000 billion (US$130 million).  Vietnam Airlines 
has also had to reroute its regularly scheduled transit flights 
through Dubai on their way to Europe for the duration of the 
conflict, adding to flight times and fuel consumption. 
PROFITS, PAY AND POLYESTER RUNNING LOW 
-------------------------------------- 
7.  Along with an increase in the global price of crude oil, the 
costs of PP and PE, petroleum by-products used in the production 
of plastics and synthetic materials, have increased from US$1.60 
to US$1.90, an increase of 19 percent.  According to Mr. Le Quang 
Ngoc, Senior Officer of the Commercial Department of PetroVietnam, 
this rise should not affect total revenues for PetroVietnam 
because the profits from selling Vietnamese crude could be used to 
cover any losses from importing PP and PE.  Mr. Pham Gia Hung, an 
officer at Vinatex textile manufacturing company, noted that while 
the overall volume of textile exports to the Middle East was 
relatively small (approximately US$4.6 million, only 0.17 percent 
of the total market), the rise in shipping costs and synthetic 
fibers combined with other factors related to market instability 
could affect the industry overall. 
 
LENDERS WORRY 
------------- 
 
8.  Several banks that lend to companies that export to the Middle 
East were worried that the companies would not be able to make 
their payments, according to Ms. Ly and Mr. Nguyen Tran Khanh, 
General Director of InvestConsult.  A decline or interruption in 
trade as a result of the conflict could affect exports estimated 
at US$300-$400 million in footwear, garments, ceramic products, 
pottery, cooking oil, detergents, shampoo, soap, and agricultural 
products.  Banks and investors were also concerned about the 
effect of any potential fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. 
 
NO DEMONSTRATIONS TO TIE UP HCMC 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  With the start of military action, the level of protest 
activity in HCMC dropped precipitously, just two days after a 
peaceful demonstration in the main tourist square downtown drew an 
estimated crowd of 10,000.  Confirming Post\'s belief that the 
earlier demonstrations were orchestrated to reflect support for 
official GVN positions, we received reliable reports that high 
school and university students in at least two different locations 
were given the choice of joining organized demonstrations or 
failing their courses (Ref C). 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10.  Most ConGen contacts in the business community did not appear 
to have given much thought to the long-term impact the war could 
have on their businesses -- a possible indication that they were 
not overly concerned over any effects that might be felt here. 
Even among those who had considered the business consequences, 
most assumed the action would be over too quickly to make much of 
a dent in the local economy.  A prolonged war, however, does have 
the potential to reduce somewhat southern Vietnam\'s high 
expectations for continued double digit economic growth rates.

REF:  A)  02 HANOI 199,   B)  02 HANOI 208 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (U)  On a recent one-day trip to meet with provincial and Cao 
Dai Church leaders in Tay Ninh Province, the Ambassador came away 
with a mostly positive impression of the current state of health 
of both the province and the religion which predominates there. 
Tay Ninh, while still on the fringes of the relative prosperity 
enjoyed by HCMC and some of its other surrounding provinces, has a 
leadership clearly committed to economic growth and development. 
And as the largest single \"constituency\" within the province, the 
Cao Dai appear to be benefiting from that commitment -- despite a 
continued inability to fill their own senior ranks.  Our 
impression was that the Cao Dai faithful are freely practicing 
their syncretic religion, with even some expansion in their 
numbers, but as is the case with all religions in Vietnam, the 
state and party maintain tight control over the religion\'s 
organization and personnel.  End Summary. 
 
Cao Dai Worship Little Changed in 30 Years 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  (U)  The Ambassador recently returned to Tay Ninh Province, on 
the western border of HCMC, for the first time since his 1970-1973 
tour of duty as a junior officer in Vietnam.  During that 
assignment, he was responsible for covering the Cao Dai -- 
Vietnam\'s homegrown syncretic religion -- out of Embassy Saigon\'s 
political section.  Upon entering the Cao Dai Holy See for the 
noon service, he remarked that very little seemed to have changed 
in either the physical or spiritual setting.  Men and woman seated 
in neat rows on opposite sides of the long rectangular floor of 
the hall bowed their heads in prayer to a steady beat of gongs and 
chanting as incense filled the air. 
 
3.  (U)  Immediately noticeable, however, were the empty chairs 
closest to the altar reserved for the top church hierarchy -- the 
Pope and Cardinals.  Empty too were the spots on the floor where 
the archbishops would normally kneel in prayer.  (The floor of the 
temple rises progressively through nine levels as it approaches 
the sacred altar.  Clergy sit in prayer on the level corresponding 
to their rank.)  Otherwise, the service appeared to be well 
attended.  While a fair number of young people were spotted among 
the worshippers, most of the clergy were well into their 60s.  The 
stunningly decorated temple, painted every year, looked very well 
maintained. 
 
Lonely at the Top, but Not Really Alone 
--------------------------------------- 
4.  (SBU)  After the service, the Ambassador took a guided tour of 
the temple with the head of the Cao Dai Management Council, 
Archbishop Thuong Tam Thanh.  While Thanh had been reluctant to 
meet with ConGenoffs last year without prior approval from the 
provincial People\'s Committee (ref A), he seemed happy to meet 
with the Ambassador on this officially sanctioned trip.  The 
Archbishop was animated and upbeat, although he became rather 
wistful when describing the significance of the vacant chairs and 
unoccupied spaces on the floor.  He noted that he was one of only 
a handful of clergy at his rank who was still alive.  There were 
supposed to be 33 archbishops at any given time, in keeping with a 
religious doctrine heavily influenced by numerology. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Continuing the discussion in his nearby office suite, 
the Archbishop adopted the disconcerting habit of writing down 
everything the Ambassador said, despite the presence of others in 
the large, open-air meeting room serving as note takers.  At least 
a few individuals in the room gave both Ambassador and Poloff the 
impression that they represented the interests of the GVN more 
than those of the Cao Dai.  The more restrained and formulaic 
nature of the Archbishop\'s answers in the office tended to 
buttress that conclusion.  Still, he did openly thank the 
Ambassador for the invitation to last year\'s Consulate General 
July 4th celebration. 
 
Church Flourishes While Leadership Withers 
------------------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU)  Early in the conversation, the Archbishop gestured off 
in the distance at the many structures that had been built during 
the intervening years since the Ambassador\'s first tour.  \"All of 
this did not happen in one or two years,\" he said.  He claimed a 
current total of 5 million Cao Dai adherents in Vietnam -- 
significantly higher than the GVN figure of 1-2 million, or even 
NGO estimates of 2-3 million -- with the numbers constantly on the 
rise.  Four hundred thousand Cao Dai make Tay Ninh home, but many 
others come to worship regularly, including hundreds of thousands 
who returned on January 9 and August 15 of each lunar year for the 
two main Cao Dai festivals. 
 
7.  (SBU)  The Archbishop was less optimistic about the prospects 
for filling the senior ranks of the clergy  because of the 
unfortunate confluence of old age and limited opportunities for 
promotion.  As one of the conditions for GVN recognition in 1997, 
exclusive power to make promotion decisions was vested in the 
newly created Management Council.  The Management Council meets 
only once every five years.  While seances had sometimes been used 
in the past to determine promotions -- a practice outlawed by the 
GVN as \"superstitious\" -- selection by high-ranking clergy had 
always existed as an alternative.  Promotion decisions at present 
are based solely on experience and seniority; no one is allowed to 
skip a rank.  Given the advanced age of most of the higher-ranking 
clergy and the fact that they can only be promoted one rank every 
five years, this protracted rate of advancement virtually 
guarantees that the highest positions will probably remain vacant 
for some time to come. 
 
8.  (SBU)  According to the Archbishop, amalgamating the three 
bodies of Cao Dai clergy -- red, blue, and yellow (legislative, 
executive, and charitable works) -- into a single Management 
Council was a by-product of the same limitations.  Traditionally, 
each of the three branches was supposed to have 12 archbishops and 
one cardinal.  However, with only two congresses since 1975 and no 
way to skip ranks, it was clear that there just would not be 
sufficient numbers of senior clergy to meet this requirement.  In 
their absence, the Management Council had been created to provide 
the necessary structure for managing the activities of the church. 
The 72 members, all high-ranking clergy, were elected every five 
years at the same congresses which decided promotions.  (Over 3000 
Cao Dai leaders and government officials from 34 provinces and 
HCMC attended the October 2002 \"Human Life Congress,\" promoting 
924 clergy, including the Archbishop.) 
 
9.  (SBU)  The Archbishop did not attempt to justify the new 
system or compare it to the old model.  Mostly, he just seemed 
resigned to it.  While he recognized that some Cao Dai, including 
a number in the U.S., did not appreciate the need for a Management 
Council or were unhappy over their exclusion, he noted that all 
religion requires discipline and law.  (The Archbishop later asked 
about the possibility of applying for a visa to meet with Cao Dai 
officials in the U.S. in the future.)  The Archbishop also 
acknowledged that while the structure was meant to unify all 13 
branches of the Cao Dai, some of the smaller sects had always 
remained separate from the main Tay Ninh branch.  Groups which 
existed outside the Council were not official in GVN eyes, but 
generally continued to pursue their activities without 
interference.  He resisted criticizing retired pre-1975 Cao Dai 
leaders Archbishop Thai The Thanh and Archbishop Thuong Nha Thanh 
(ref B), but clearly disagreed with their decisions to \"abandon 
service\" to the Cao Dai faithful. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Minimizing the intrusiveness of government regulation, 
the Archbishop dismissed concerns of GVN control over ordination 
of new clergy -- a common complaint of other religions in Vietnam. 
After all, the Cao Dai themselves, not the GVN, required 
verification of \"good citizenship\" from the relevant local 
authorities before candidates were considered for the priesthood. 
He was unable to explain why the Cao Dai had not expressed more 
interest in political activities, especially in the province where 
they were most numerous.  While he himself had once been a 
National Assembly member, the Archbishop could think of no other 
Cao Dai active in national or local politics. 
 
Confiscation by Another Name 
---------------------------- 
11.  (SBU)  Downplaying another common grievance of other 
religions in Vietnam -- post-war confiscations of property -- the 
Archbishop tried to rationalize the \"borrowing of unused\" Cao Dai 
properties by the Fatherland Front in 1975.  He said whenever the 
Cao Dai needed a property back, they merely had to provide a 
justification and it was returned.  There are currently 600 Cao 
Dai temples nationwide, by his count.  His resolve wavered just a 
bit when the Ambassador reminisced about the highly regarded 
educational institutions once operated by the Cao Dai, including 
the former university which had been converted to a cadre training 
school.  However, the Archbishop quickly pointed out that unlike 
the Protestant and Catholic religions, the Cao Dai church had 
never relied on seminaries to train its clergy.  Those who showed 
promising academic qualifications and wished to devote their lives 
to the Cao Dai faith were brought to the temple for bible study. 
Success was then based on their actual work record, rather than 
any sort of book learning.  Education was never a determining 
factor in promotions. 
 
People\'s Committee Upbeat on Economic Fundamentals 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
12.  (SBU) In a separate meeting (in the same compound used by the 
provincial government before 1975), People\'s Committee Chairman 
Nguyen Tan Lam urged the Ambassador to encourage American business 
investment in Tay Ninh, a province of approximately one million. 
While the province had yet to feel much impact from the BTA, he 
boasted of an 11.7 percent overall increase in GDP, with 10 
percent across the board growth in industrial production, 
agriculture, and services.  Industrial output accounted for 34 
percent of GDP, but tourism was also a major source of revenue. 
One hundred percent of the province was already electrified, with 
80 percent hooked up to the national power grid.  The roads to all 
villages in the province were paved, although some hamlets were 
still connected by dirt roads.  Clinics manned by physicians 
served every district.  To staff new businesses, Tay Ninh produced 
3000 high school graduates last year, with 1550 passing the 
national university entrance exam.  Overall, one third of all 
school-age children attend school. 
 
13.  (SBU)  According to the Chairman, the province had attracted 
a total of 50 FDI projects, valued at US$240 million.  Twenty- 
seven projects, worth US$40 million, were invested at the 700- 
hectare Trang Bang Industrial Park, near the border with HCMC. 
With Trang Bang nearly 70 percent full, the province was directing 
new investment to the much larger Moc Bai Economic Zone.  Moc Bai, 
located near the Cambodian border, is the eventual crossing point 
for the Trans-Asia Highway, connecting HCMC with Cambodia and 
points west.  Vietnam\'s portion of the highway was expected to be 
finished this March, but investors recently extended the deadline 
to July.  The Chairman predicted that progress on the Cambodian 
side of the border would be much slower.  Tay Ninh shares a 240- 
kilometer border with Cambodia. 
 
Church and State in Harmony 
--------------------------- 
14.  (SBU)  Asked to comment by Chairman Lam on the changes he had 
observed on this first trip back in 30 years, the Ambassador cited 
the empty ranks at the top of the Cao Dai hierarchy and the new 
organizational structure.  The role of the Fatherland Front in 
coordinating how the Cao Dai organized their affairs was another 
notable development.  He also regretted GVN restrictions on Cao 
Dai charitable activities, such as schools and orphanages, and 
wondered why there were no Cao Dai in positions of authority in 
the local government when they made up some 40 percent of the 
population.  On the bright side, he praised the familiar images of 
ordinary people continuing to practice their faith. 
 
15.  (SBU)  The Chairman was prepared with a number of statistics 
to show that the Cao Dai faith had actually grown under the GVN. 
The number of Cao Dai had increased from 35 to 40 percent of the 
provincial population since 1975, even as the total number of 
temples had grown from 25-95.  The number of high-ranking clergy 
increased from 1905 to 2144 during the same period, while the 
number of student priests rose from 1522 to 3480.  He was less 
convincing when he asserted that the issue of replacing the 
elderly clergy was entirely in the hands of the Cao Dai 
themselves. 
 
16.  (SBU)  While the Cao Dai had not generally participated in 
local political activities after 1975, Chairman Lam assured the 
Ambassador that the laws of Vietnam give everyone equal access to 
leadership positions.  Some Cao Dai had been active in local 
People\'s Councils since 1986, and he thought it entirely possible 
that a Cao Dai could one day serve as a district Chairman. 
Despite the current lack of Cao Dai adherents in important 
positions, he pointed to Tay Ninh as a place where there was great 
unity between the religious and the secular.  The Chairman also 
praised the Cao Dai for their assistance to flood victims and 
orphans in the recent past. 
 
Comment 
------- 
17.  (SBU)  Amidst Tay Ninh\'s relative political stability, 
there\'s little doubt that the province is well positioned to 
benefit economically from its proximity to HCMC.  Decent roads, or 
at least roads that appeared to be under active construction, led 
to and from HCMC.  Immediate economic returns from improved 
overland access to the rest of mainland Southeast Asia are less of 
a sure thing.  Tourism, while it will continue to be a big draw, 
needs to avoid the temptation of appealing to the lowest common 
denominator.  A steady stream of Western and Asian tourists visit 
the temple each day during the noon service, a staple for 
inexpensive tours from HCMC.  Paving over the greenery and 
blasting loud music from cheaply constructed souvenir and food 
stalls, however, is not going to attract a sustained influx of big- 
spending Western tourists. 
 
18.  (SBU)  The Archbishop was careful not to express openly any 
disagreement with the Management Committee structure, but the 
empty ranks at the top of his religion\'s hierarchy is obviously a 
source of frustration and concern.  For his part, the Chairman of 
the People\'s Committee seems to realize the importance of 
cultivating relations with the Cao Dai, a job made easier by the 
fact that the church leadership has completely lost its pre-1975 
role as a political entity.  Our impression during this short 
visit to Tay Ninh was that the Cao Dai religion is now treated 
much the same as Buddhism and Catholicism: worship is fully 
tolerated, the numbers of the faithful even allowed to expand 
somewhat, but the party and state maintain tight control over the 
religion\'s organizational structure.

SUBJECT: HARASSED UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE:  DON DUONG AND FAMILY 
DEPART 
 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED - PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Actor Bui Don Duong, his wife, and their two 
sons departed Ho Chi Minh City today on the first leg of their 
journey to the U.S. as intending immigrants.  Up to the last 
minute, GVN security forces delayed and humiliated the family at 
Tan Son Nhut Airport, almost causing them to miss their flight. 
ConGenoffs were also hassled and prevented from observing portions 
of the departure process.  In a deviation from past practice on 
diplomatic airport access, ConGenoffs were variously told: 1) they 
could only see off a national of their own country; 2) the Customs 
area was now off limits (it wasn\'t last Friday); and 3) the 
Immigration area was now off limits (again, it wasn\'t last 
Friday).  Suggested press guidance para 10.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Ending a protracted ordeal that included police 
questioning, emotional media attacks, telephone harassment, 
passport confiscation, being blackballed for employment, having 
his children bullied at school, and vandalism against his sister\'s 
restaurant in HCMC, Don Duong and family departed HCMC on EVA Air 
392 to Taipei on April 9.  From there, they will connect to the 
West Coast of the U.S., where they will be reunited with the 
actor\'s sister and immigrant visa sponsor, Susie Bui. 
 
3.  (SBU) After an initial wave of critical media coverage 
(\"besmirched his country\'s honor\", \"traitor to Vietnamese ideals,\" 
etc.) and police summons for questioning in September-October 
2002, harassment and pressure \"to apologize\" had become somewhat 
sporadic during November 2002-February 2003.  During that time, 
however, Don Duong\'s children were subjected to schoolyard 
taunting and accusations.  He was unable to get any work as an 
actor.  Contracts he had were broken.  Permission to travel 
overseas to represent Vietnam at film festivals was denied, and 
his passport was confiscated. 
 
4.  (SBU) On his fourth try to apply for a new passport, Don Duong 
was successful - but only after he signed a written pledge 
promising not to knowingly violate any published Vietnamese laws 
and regulations.  This new passport was issued on March 17. 
Having already \"pre-processed\" the family as much as possible, 
remaining visa interviews and formalities were completed on March 
19.  At that time Don Duong\'s intention was to immigrate - as a 
normal immigrant - to the U.S. at the end of his sons\' Vietnamese 
school year in May. 
 
5.  (SBU) The next week, renewed harassment began.  Media stories 
began appearing about Don Duong\'s \"selling out to Hollywood and 
American dollars.\"  The equivalent of agent provocateurs came to 
his sister\'s restaurant, slashing pictures, refusing to pay, 
talking loudly about Don Duong\'s betrayal of his country, and 
picking fights with wait staff.  If Don Duong happened to be 
visiting his sister or eating at the restaurant, these \"customers\" 
would invite him for a drink - criticizing him for being \"uppity 
and arrogant\" if he declined, but trying to provoke him into 
saying something negative about the GVN if he sat down to chat. 
 
6.  (SBU) Two weeks ago a friend with contacts in the military 
told Don Duong that the Army had opened a \"new file\" on him, and 
was looking for something to catch him on.  It was then that Don 
Duong decided to move up his departure date.  The news about the 
\"new file\" was followed by more staged incidents at the sister\'s 
restaurant, one of which resulted in Don Duong being summoned to 
his local ward police station on April 7.  Claiming that he was 
busy preparing for his trip to the U.S., he asked the police for a 
later appointment, and was simply told to come whenever he 
finished packing (he never went). 
 
7.  (SBU) On April 9, ConGenoffs were allowed the usual access to 
Tan Son Nhut Airport at the first checkpoint.  However, a 
cameraman allegedly from Vietnam TV, was filming Don Duong\'s 
arrival, and followed the family through each departure 
checkpoint.  At the Customs checkpoint, ConGenoffs were refused 
access with the various excuses: a) you are not seeing off a 
national of your own country; b) the Customs area is now off 
limits; and c) the Immigration area is now off limits too.  When 
it was pointed out to them that just last Friday a ConGenoff had 
had unimpeded access to those areas, in accordance with past 
practice, the Customs Police simply shrugged their shoulders and 
said the policy had changed.  Two supervisors were summoned, but 
it turned out that one of them was the officer who would direct a 
slow and ever so comprehensive baggage search. 
An Australian ConGen colleague who joined ConGenoffs was also 
denied permission to enter the customs area. 
 
8.  (SBU) Although unable to enter the Customs area, ConGenoffs 
were able to see Don Duoung and his family escorted into a small 
room where at least eight customs officers opened up their six 
large suitcases and three large boxes.  The officers examined 
every article inside the luggage.  They took several photos of the 
contents, holding up underwear to the light.  After an hour of 
searching, the Customs officers allowed the family and other 
airport staff to repack the bags and boxes, put them through the X- 
ray machines once more, and onto the luggage trolley.  Don Duong 
was taken to a separate counter, where he was apparently required 
to sign more papers (promising what we do not know). 
 
9.  (SBU) EVA Airlines held the flight for 15 minutes to enable 
Don Duong and his family to board.  The family was never paged for 
the last call, as is common practice at Tan Son Nhut.  Through a 
glass window on the International Arrivals side of the airport, 
ConGenoff was able to observe the family going down the Departure 
Lobby corridor, directly to the gate and jetway.  The \"cameraman\" 
continued filming until the last moment, while a large contingent 
of security officials blanketed the boarding lobby.  EVA Air #392 
departed at 13:15, with Don Duong and family on board. 
 
10.  (U) Suggested press guidance on an if asked basis: 
 
Q:  Is it true that the movie actor Don Duong was able to depart 
Vietnam today?  What is his status? 
 
A:  Yes, Don Duong and his family departed Vietnam on April 9 
local time.  They are beneficiaries of an immigrant visa petition. 
 
Q:  How was he treated at the airport?  Do you know? 
 
A:  Officers from our Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City 
observed harassment.  We find this harassment to be regrettable. 
We will continue to urge the Vietnamese Government - in public and 
private -- to respect human rights, including freedom of artistic 
expression, which is an essential component for a strong, 
prosperous democratic society. 
 
It would be extremely regrettable if the Government of Vietnam 
misdirected any of its displeasure toward any members of Don 
Duong\'s or his wife\'s families who remain in Vietnam. 
 
11.  (SBU) Press Guidance Background:  Don Duong is a Vietnamese 
actor who had roles in two American films - \"We Were Soldiers 
Once\" about the Vietnam War and \"Green Dragon\" about Vietnamese 
refugees in the U.S.  Vietnamese state media, the military, and 
other GVN officials have criticized him for besmirching the 
country\'s honor by his portrayals of a Vietnamese army colonel in 
\"We Were Soldiers Once\" and as a sympathetic refugee coordinator 
in \"Green Dragon.\"  Actors Mel Gibson and Forrest Whittaker, and 
film director Randall Wallace - among others - have inquired about 
Don Duong\'s situation in Vietnam.  For nearly eight months he was 
blackballed for employment, harassed by the police, and victimized 
by officially-directed media attacks.  He was virtually driven out 
of his homeland.

SUBJECT: SHOTGUN WEDDING:  UBCV AND VBS TOGETHER AT LAST? 
 
REF:  A)  2002 HCMC 914   B)  HANOI 807  C)  HANOI 842 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  In a meeting with the Consul General on May 
9, Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) Patriarch Thich Huyen 
Quang spoke hopefully of a new openness on the part of the GVN 
toward efforts to unite the UBCV with the officially recognized 
Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS).  The Patriarch, who was allowed to 
travel to HCMC after more than 20 years of \"pagoda detention\" in 
rural Quang Ngai Province, was also realistic about the roadblocks 
ahead.  Repeatedly denying any interest in \"political activities,\" 
he said his overwhelming goal now was to unify the two Buddhist 
churches.  Crediting the USG and other members of the 
international community for past and present efforts on behalf of 
his cause, he stressed the UBCV was not quite ready to make it on 
its own.  Still, Thich Huyen Quang claimed the majority of 
Vietnamese Buddhists were really still \"his\", even if the UBCV 
organization itself had grown weak.  He concluded by saying he was 
still \"measuring the situation,\" but realized \"things outside are 
very complicated.\"  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Consul General and ConGenoffs met with Thich Huyen 
Quang at An Quang Pagoda, the former principal pagoda of the UBCV 
and current home of the HCMC Buddhist Sangha, the southern branch 
of the VBS.  The meeting was arranged by UBCV General Secretary 
Thich Tue Sy, who also attended.  (Note:  Unlike previous calls on 
members of the official VBS hierarchy at An Quang, this visit did 
not require a diplomatic note or notification to the local MFA 
branch.  While it is clear GVN officials would have had to approve 
today\'s meeting, it is remarkable that we were allowed to work the 
appointment entirely through the offices of the \"outlawed\" UBCV.) 
In addition to the two UBCV leaders, three high-ranking VBS monks, 
with whom ConGenoffs have met in the past, also attended. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang appeared in fairly good health, but 
harder of hearing and less focused than during an October 2002 
meeting at his pagoda in Quang Ngai Province (ref A).  He said he 
was satisfied with the medical attention he had received in Hanoi 
and was confident that his needs would be met in the future (ref 
B).  The atmosphere during the meeting was much more low-key than 
during the visit to Quang Ngai.  Despite the presence of high- 
ranking VBS monks in the room, he spoke openly and comfortably. 
For their part, the VBS monks refrained from the frequent 
interruptions and prompting that had marked the behavior of the 
Quang Ngai authorities. (Thich Huyen Quang twice referred to the 
heavy-handed tactics of his handlers during the October meeting in 
Quang Ngai, apologizing for their rudeness.) 
 
4.  (SBU)  Recapping his April meeting with Prime Minister Phan 
Van Khai in Hanoi (ref C), Thich Huyen Quang was clearly pleased 
that the PM had publicly acknowledged the contributions of the 
UBCV \"to the resistance\".  He also appreciated the PM\'s sending 
someone to check on his health in Quang Ngai.  He had pressed PM 
Khai for the release of detained UBCV leaders, including himself 
and Thich Quang Do.  He had also asked for written documentation 
of the reasons for the continued detentions, and an official 
statement on the legal status of the UBCV.  While PM Khai did not 
answer those questions, he promised to act with \"Buddhist mercy 
and compassion\" in his future dealings with the UBCV.  In return, 
Thich Huyen Quang promised to respond with \"Buddhist tolerance.\" 
 
5.  (SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang had spent 20 days in his hometown of 
Quy Nhon, reconnecting with the UBCV faithful before traveling to 
HCMC.  UBCV followers noted a real improvement in the way they had 
been treated by local authorities since his meeting with PM Khai. 
Thich Huyen Quang had then asked to visit HCMC in order to meet 
with UBCV leaders and attempt to reestablish some viable form of 
organization.  While he did not go into detail on the logistics of 
his trip, he did not seem to have encountered any government 
resistance to his plan.  Thich Huyen Quang had hoped to stay in a 
UBCV pagoda upon his arrival, but seemed genuinely pleased with 
GVN arrangements to provide him space at his former pagoda, which 
had been UBCV headquarters before 1975.  Since arriving in HCMC, 
he had met with many followers and was \"happy to see that UBCV 
believers are still here.\" 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Patriarch requested, and was able to meet, with 
HCMC People\'s Committee Chairman Le Thanh Hai on May 8.  During 
their discussions, Chairman Hai tacitly opened the way for 
discussions on \"legalizing\" the UBCV through integration with the 
VBS.  When the Patriarch asked Chairman Hai if the two churches 
could be merged, Hai responded that was an internal matter to be 
resolved by the two churches -- but he believed one day there 
would be a single, unified church.  Thich Tri Quang, head of the 
HCMC Buddhist Sangha, also attended that meeting and supported the 
concept of unification.  Based on Chairman Hai and Thich Tri 
Quang\'s responses, the Patriarch said he believed the GVN really 
wanted to heal the schism within the Buddhist community.  Showing 
off HCMC as the nation\'s economic engine, the People\'s Committee 
took Thich Huyen Quang to the new Saigon South urban development 
area - where upscale villas cost USD 800,000. 
 
7.  (SBU)  After some prodding, Thich Huyen Quang briefly 
summarized his May 5 meeting with number two-ranking UBCV leader 
Thich Quang Do, who has been under administrative detention in 
HCMC since June 2001.  During the meeting, Thich Quang Do had 
emphasized the need to get the UBCV\'s own house in order before 
opening negotiations with the VBS.  Long years of operating as an 
underground church had taken their toll and left the UBCV 
splintered and disorganized.  Thich Huyen Quang deflected several 
attempts by ConGenoffs to elicit predictions on whether Thich 
Quang Do\'s administrative detention would be lifted on schedule 
this June.  He did note that the meeting had ended with Thich 
Quang Do saying he looked forward to visiting Thich Huyen Quang 
and continuing the discussion in Quy Nhon.  (Thich Huyen Quang 
told ConGenoffs he would be returning to Quy Nhon rather than 
Quang Ngai after leaving HCMC.  He plans to use An Quang Pagoda as 
his base of operations for meetings in HCMC from time to time.) 
 
8.  (SBU)  Assessing the likelihood of merging the UBCV with the 
VBS, the Patriarch noted, \"agreeing is easy, but the process is 
difficult.\"  He placed great stock in UBCV \"(human) assets and 
property\" as leverage, claiming that many VBS monks and nuns are 
actually UBCV followers.  While the UBCV still holds a number of 
properties that had escaped (or been spared) confiscation, he 
hoped the GVN would consider returning other former assets.  He 
said he expected to meet with the VBS to discuss a merger in the 
near future.  He hopes the two churches will be allowed to sit 
down and discuss - free of GVN interference - their merger, and 
that local authorities would allow the UBCV to reconstruct its 
organizational framework.  Thich Huyen Quang described a future 
unified church which would steer clear of politics, focusing its 
efforts on spiritual matters and charitable works.  While he 
acknowledged that some Buddhists had participated in political 
activities in the past, he stressed the need to concentrate on 
religious affairs during this time of peace. 
 
9.  (SBU)  A recurring theme in the 75 minute-long meeting was 
appreciation for the efforts of the world community and 
international media in supporting the UBCV cause.  The Patriarch 
expressed thanks to the many countries that had allowed UBCV 
Buddhists to maintain the 2000-year-old tradition of Vietnamese 
Buddhism overseas.  Asked what the USG and others could do to 
support the peaceful integration of the two Buddhist churches, he 
noted the importance of continuing international support for and 
media attention to efforts to train new monks and nuns, organize 
UBCV activities at the local level, communicate with believers 
overseas, and build a UBCV public information apparatus.  He also 
cited pressing needs for renovation of many UBCV properties. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Another recurring feature was Thich Tue Sy\'s strident 
voice interrupting the Patriarch to drive home his own call for 
continued international support for the absolute separation of 
church and state in Vietnam.  Citing the Universal Declaration on 
Human Rights, he insisted no true religion could ever submit to a 
secular authority (\"there are no worldly ends for us\").  While 
Thich Tue Sy said he would work within the framework of the 
Vietnamese Constitution, his determination to pursue \"pure 
spiritualism\" outside the supervision of the Fatherland Front and 
Communist Party seemed at odds with Thich Huyen Quang\'s resigned 
pragmatism.  The difference in viewpoint was clear in their 
responses to a question on whether the GVN would allow interviews 
with foreign journalists.  While the English-speaking Thich Tue Sy 
immediately responded \"no problem,\" the Patriarch\'s more reserved 
answer after hearing the Vietnamese translation was, \"depends on 
the Government.\" 
 
11.  (SBU)  Comment:  ConGenoffs have previously met with VBS and 
UBCV monks separately.  But together in the same room, we found 
less tension between the formal VBS-UBCV adversaries than between 
the two UBCV leaders themselves.  The VBS monks sat silently by 
while the elderly, revered Patriarch of its UBCV rival listened 
patiently to the strident demands of a monk whom he himself has 
anointed \"executive director\" of the UBCV once it \"gets its house 
in order.\" 
 
12.  (SBU)  Comment (cont.):  It is too early to tell whether the 
GVN, VBS, and UBCV are really ready to mend fences.  The actions 
of \"hard-line\" elements who might push the envelope right off the 
table should also be taken into account.  While Thich Huyen 
Quang\'s recent travels, meetings, and pronouncements are something 
we could not have imagined last October, no one at today\'s meeting 
made any concrete predictions for the future.  Thich Huyen Quang 
closed the discussion by saying he was still \"measuring the 
situation,\" and acknowledged \"things outside are very 
complicated.\"  The next signal to watch for may be whether the GVN 
renews Thich Quang Do\'s administrative detention when it expires 
next month.

1.  Summary: At our second annual Earth Day roundtable, 
the ConGen\'s economic and public affairs sections 
joined efforts to invite two U.S. company country 
directors to discuss environmental protection, 
corporate responsibility and national development.  Two 
Vietnamese economics publications ran articles based on 
the discussion, in which 10 prominent environmental 
scholars, writers and business leaders participated. 
End summary. 
 
2.  At the roundtable, representatives from CDM and 
SELCO (Solar Energy Light Company) discussed how their 
companies are improving wastewater processing (CDM) and 
rural electrification (SELCO).  The CDM manager also 
discussed international efforts to develop Vietnam\'s 
infrastructure, and how pursuing environmentally sound 
policies now will have significant benefits in the long 
run.  The CDM representative noted that a recent World 
Bank grant has drawn the attention of policymakers and 
the educated public to the problems of open sewage and 
contamination of the waterways. 
 
3.  The director of SELCO, whose company was recognized 
in 2001 by Secretary Powell with the State Department\'s 
Award for Corporate Excellence, discussed his firm\'s 
efforts to electrify rural areas through solar power. 
He emphasized the importance of using renewable energy 
sources and skyrocketing energy demands in Vietnam. 
 
4.  The director of Saigon Hi-tech Park talked about 
the organization\'s recycling of natural resources and 
its energy-efficient power generating facility.  Other 
scholars and business people focused on raising public 
awareness, and on avoiding the problems of other 
developing countries by implementing an eco-friendly 
energy policy now, rather than later. 
 
5.  The Vietnam Economic Times (VET) and Agriculture 
(\"Nong Nghiep\") ran articles on the roundtable.  Both 
pieces covered the discussion themes, and VET had a 
sidebar interview with the director of CDM.  \"Nong 
Nghiep\'s\" article focused on SELCO\'s projects and the 
role of Vietnam\'s agricultural and rural development 
bank in providing financing for families in isolated 
areas who are installing SELCO\'s solar electric 
systems.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S VISIT TO VINH LONG 
 
 
1. SUMMARY: On May 5, 2003, Ambassador Burghardt, DPO, and Conoff 
traveled to Vinh Long province in the Mekong Delta with Catholic 
Relief Services (CRS) Country Representative Chris Gilson.  The 
Ambassador met with representatives of the provincial People\'s 
Committee and Union of Friendship Organizations (UFO) before 
visiting two villages where CRS is building new homes for flood 
victims.  Religious leaders have been allowed to play a small role 
in the project, which is an encouraging signal about the 
government\'s attitude.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. Arriving in Vinh Long, the Ambassador noted that it had not 
changed much since his last visit to the province 30 years ago. 
Although Vinh Long is the second largest exporter of rice in 
Vietnam (with the U.S. and Iraq as major clients), it remains one 
of the poorest provinces in the country and has an annual GDP per 
capita of $330 USD.  The majority of people live in rural areas 
and rely on agriculture as their main source of income.  The 
province illustrates the relatively slow rate of development and 
lack of infrastructure in the delta region, which suffers 
regularly from flooding during the annual rainy season. 
 
3. The Ambassador visited two villages where CRS is building 
elevated houses for flood victims.  The average income falls below 
$175 USD in these villages, which are inhabited by people of Khmer 
origin.  Villagers gave the Ambassador a warm welcome and appeared 
quite happy with their new homes.  Gilson expressed satisfaction 
with the success of the project and said that by the end of 2003, 
CRS will have built over 1,100 houses in Vinh Long.  CRS began 
working in the province after the flooding in 2000 and has used 
this project to build a better relationship with the Vietnamese 
government in the south where its activities are more restricted 
than in the northern region of the country.  CRS hopes it has 
established valuable contacts that will lead to future cooperation 
on more extensive projects. 
 
4. Phan Van Dau, First Vice Chairman of the Vinh Long People\'s 
Committee, emphasized the poverty in the province and expressed 
gratitude for the CRS projects.  He said he wanted to expand 
cooperation with CRS and other American NGOs.  Noting that there 
had been bitter fighting in the area during the war, Dau said the 
province understood it was time to look to the future and develop 
good relations with the U.S.  A businessman who previously worked 
for a State Owned Enterprise in the rice trade, Dau said the 
province was interested in working with the Consulate to attract 
American companies.  The Ambassador encouraged him to reach out to 
overseas Vietnamese as an investment source.  Dau noted that Vinh 
Long is located on the regular tourist track of the Mekong Delta 
but that the number of tourists in the province has decreased 20 
to 30 percent as a result of the SARS epidemic. 
 
5. During the trip, the Ambassador had an interesting discussion 
with Tran Van Khai, Vice Chairman of the Vinh Long Union of 
Friendship Organizations, about Decree No. 7 issued at the Ninth 
Party Congress on the relationship between the government and 
religious groups and minorities.  Khai was preparing to take part 
in meetings that are being held throughout Vietnam to educate 
cadre about the decree so they can make sure it is implemented in 
their localities.  Khai claimed that this decree was a 
confirmation of the GVN\'s liberalization toward religious groups. 
He emphasized that the Communist party needed to utilize the 
strengths of religious organizations and encourage their 
participation in government.  The CPV needs new membership and 
cannot afford to exclude religious groups, he added. 
 
6. Gilson said he has noticed the government\'s changing attitude 
toward religious groups through his work in Vinh Long.  Each 
village holds popular assemblies to select the families who will 
receive CRS houses.  Religious leaders, including Catholic clergy, 
take part in these meetings and their advice about their parish 
members is often followed.  According to both Gilson and Khai, 
neither the government nor the party has a role in the decision- 
making process.  Gilson also said this is the first time CRS has 
had the church as a partner on a project in Vietnam and that local 
government officials have been comfortable with this relationship 
thus far. 
 
7. COMMENT: Despite Khai\'s claim, it is still unclear how the GOV 
intends to implement Decree No. 7 on religion and minorities, 
which has both positive and potentially restrictive elements. 
Vinh Long leadership, at least, appears to be taking some steps in 
the right direction by allowing CRS to partner with a Catholic 
church.  Although Vinh Long officials appear eager for additional 
humanitarian assistance from the U.S., some of the other delta 
provincial leaders are reportedly less forthcoming in their 
dealings with both religious groups and NGOs.  END COMMENT.

Summary 
------- 
1.  (SBU)  Returning to Kon Tum for the first time in a year, the 
Consul General found little changed in the poorest and least 
developed of the four Central Highlands provinces.  While poverty 
continues to be the biggest story in Kon Tum, local officials 
seemed hopeful that construction of new highways linking the 
province to the outside world would somehow bring an economic 
windfall.  In ConGenoffs\' first meeting with the provincial 
Committee on Religious Affairs, the deputy director did not seem 
to realize that Protestantism is now a recognized religion in the 
rest of Vietnam -- and has been for the last two years.  The 
ConGen group was not allowed to visit the 15 villagers who had 
returned from Cambodia under UNHCR auspices in February 2002. 
 
No Longer the Second Poorest Province - We\'ve Moved up to Twelfth 
--------------------------------------------- -------------------- 
2.  (SBU)  According to People\'s Committee First Vice Chairman 
Huynh Hao, Kon Tum had gone from being the second poorest province 
in the country to twelfth poorest.  Per capita income is just over 
USD$200 for the province\'s 350,000 inhabitants.  Mr. Hao was 
realistic in describing current 12-15 percent growth rates, 
acknowledging the fact that they were starting from such a low 
level.  Agriculture accounts for 44 percent of the provincial 
economy, down from 70 percent in 1991, but coffee and rubber 
production is still on the rise.  While the ongoing drought 
plaguing the Central Highlands had affected the coffee crop, Kon 
Tum is faring better than its neighbors.  The service and 
industrial sectors account for 37 and 19 percent of the provincial 
economy, respectively. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Director Tran Binh Trong of the Department of Labor, 
Invalids and Social Affairs (DOLISA) described several programs 
aimed at reducing poverty in the province.  Some programs, such as 
providing technical advisers to the communes, tried to improve 
agricultural methods and encourage cultivation of viable 
alternatives to rice, such as \"industrial\" trees (coffee, pepper, 
rubber).  Other programs, such as DOLISA-subsidized loans at 0.15 
percent interest rates, were intended to spur investment in small 
businesses (especially for ethnic minority graduates of certain 
training programs).  While Kon Tum\'s 3.2 percent jobless rate is 
lower than the national average, the real problem is 
underemployment due to lack of skills.  Plans are underway to 
establish a labor export program once the SARS scare has passed. 
Mr. Trong blamed higher fertility rates among ethnic minorities 
for their (relatively)greater poverty. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Despite improvements, most Kon Tum residents remain 
poor.  The 1-2 month seasonal famine between crop harvests has 
become less severe, affecting  22 percent of the population, 
mostly ethnic minorities in remote areas.  Fifty-nine of 82 
villages and communes are linked to reliable power from the 
province\'s own hydropower plant and the national grid.  Whereas 
only 30 percent of children in Kon Tum were enrolled in school 10 
years ago, the province has now met GVN standards for universal 
primary school education and basic literacy.  Unfortunately, weak 
educational infrastructure meant they can only provide secondary 
education to 65 villages and communes.  There is now at least one 
dispensary per village to provide routine health care, but most 
lack their own doctors.  Still, this expanded access -- including 
free care to the indigent and payments equivalent to 35 cents per 
day for custodial family members -- has translated into fewer 
problems with goiter, malaria, and dysentery.  First Vice Chairman 
Hao said the province had received adequate guidance to deal with 
SARS. 
 
Where the Road to Nowhere Meets the Ho Chi Minh Trail 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
5.  (SBU)  According to Department of Planning and Investment 
(DPI) Director Le Quang Chuong, Kon Tum\'s economic development 
prospects are closely linked to two highways currently under 
construction: the north-south Ho Chi Minh Highway (following 
roughly the path of the old wartime Ho Chi Minh Trail) and the 
East-West Highway (linking some of the poorest parts of Vietnam, 
Laos, Thailand, and Burma.)  Acknowledging the obvious attractions 
of the richer provinces to the south, he saw the new highways as 
Kon Tum\'s chance for gaining a competitive edge.  However, 
additional ODA funding is still needed for both roads.  Kon Tum is 
upgrading its own 1400 kilometers of road to improve 
transportation  over some very rough terrain.  First Vice Chairman 
Hao was enthusiastic about opening an international frontier 
crossing into Laos and Cambodia, hoping for an annual turnover of 
USD$1.3 million through trade.  He was also excited about the 
possibility of using Ubon Rachathani in northeastern Thailand as a 
conduit for increased trade.  According to Mr. Hao, a conference 
is planned in Thailand to discuss trade and tourism. 
 
6.  (SBU)  While DPI Director Chuong deferred to the central 
government\'s  overall economic strategy, he said Kon Tum was 
working directly with neighboring provinces to evaluate 
opportunities.  Streamlined investment procedures and planned 
industrial zones are expected to attract foreign and domestic 
investment, but there is a crying need for vocational training for 
the future work force.  Mr. Chuong seemed genuinely interested in 
hosting HCMC American Chamber of Commerce visits to the province 
and meeting with the American business community in HCMC.  He 
acknowledged that most investors \"see only problems when they 
think about Kon Tum.  We have to market ourselves more as \'virgin 
territory\' to make ourselves attractive.\"  There are no industrial 
parks in the province, and the Bilateral Trade Agreement has had 
no impact.  One setback this year is that the once promising 
USD$350 million Dak Tho paper pulp processing plant is currently 
on hold for an environmental impact study.  The original 
projections for processing 130,000 tons of pulp the first year, 
and 260,000 the second, had not taken into account the effect on 
limited forest resources, nor an increased interest in ecotourism 
as a promising route for growth.  Straying from his brief at the 
end of the meeting, DPI Director Chuong admitted that \"ethnic 
tensions have had a negative effect\", but the differences in the 
standards of living between ethnic minorities and ethnic 
Vietnamese Kinh are longstanding. 
 
\"Kon Tum is not perfect (but others are worse).\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
7.  (SBU)  First Vice Chairman Hao downplayed the ethnic minority 
\"problem\" in Kon Tum, saying that Vietnam cared about its ethnic 
minorities but needed time to recover from the effects of war. 
Reading from notes, he asked the CG to convey to the U.S. Congress 
his unhappiness over the reintroduction of the Vietnam Human 
Rights Act.  He spoke matter-of-factly about how close cooperation 
with individual border provinces in Laos and Cambodia will prevent 
\"bad people\" from luring Kon Tum\'s ethnic minorities across the 
border and will help \"break up any rebellious plots.\"  A border 
agreement signed between Kon Tum and Ratanakiri provides for the 
return of illegal immigrants.  Mr. Hao described the ethnic 
minorities who fled the unrest/crackdown in 2001 --and 
subsequently returned under UNHCR auspices -- as economic 
migrants.  He said Kon Tum was working on programs to distribute 
land for coffee and rubber production, and provide industrial jobs 
to those in need.  He noted that his province had \"greater 
political stability\" than Dak Lak or Gia Lai provinces.  Mr. Hao 
acknowledged that Kon Tum \"is not perfect, but other provinces are 
worse.  I have travelled to the North and I have seen them.\" 
 
8.  (SBU)  According to Kon Tum authorities, ethnic minorities had 
also benefited from the GVN\'s Decision 168, which raised living 
standards in the Central Highlands by providing clothing, iodized 
salt, medical care, and electricity subsidies.  Provincial 
government efforts to encourage the ethnic minorities to resettle 
near transportation links had left only 12 percent still living in 
remote areas.  Kon Tum\'s goal is land for everyone by 2004 and 
improved housing by 2005.  Facing a shortage of trained ethnic 
minority teachers, the province relies on a corps of ethnic 
Vietnamese Kinh trained in local languages.  The ethnic minority 
boarding school, presumably the source of future teachers, was 
described as still relatively undeveloped.  Schools and school 
materials are free for ethnic minorities (and the poorest of the 
poor).  Ethnic minority students take the national university 
entrance exam for free and compete on a separate point scale. 
According to First Vice Chairman Hao, 70-80 percent of Kon Tum\'s 
USD$32.5 million budget is devoted to 24 different programs aimed 
at improving the living standards of the ethnic minorities. 
 
9.  (SBU)  First Vice Chairman Hao turned down the CG\'s request to 
visit 15 villagers (the original February 2002 UNHCR returnees) 
with whom Ambassador Burghardt and/or ConGenoffs had met on two 
previous occasions.  He said that \"so many groups have been 
publicizing and reporting on the villagers that various 
misinterpretations have arisen.  This has upset the villagers\' 
lives and the People\'s Committee as well.  Also, since it is 
planting season, the returnees would lose work hours if they are 
called in from the fields to meet with outsiders.\"  Mr. Hao 
assured ConGenoffs that Ia Sia village was stable, and the 
returnees had been well cared for.  They now realized they had 
been \"lured\" to Cambodia and promised never to flee again.  At a 
later dinner, provincial External Relations Office escorts 
explicitly stated that other villagers were jealous of all the 
attention the returnees were getting. 
 
Protestant Catch-22 
------------------------ 
10.  (SBU)  Despite frequent references to Vietnam\'s 
constitutional provisions on freedom of religion, Deputy Director 
Pham Van Long of the Committee on Ethnic Minority and Religious 
Affairs was clearly not up to speed.  Pointing to the number of 
Catholic churches and Buddhist pagodas as proof that religion was 
thriving in Kon Tum, he put on the brakes when it came to 
Protestants.  Mr. Long was unfamiliar with the Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV), the umbrella organization 
for registered Protestant churches which was legally established 
two years ago.  He persisted in calling Protestantism \"illegal\" 
and none of the three other Committee members disputed this. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Describing the \"different characteristics\" of Kon Tum, 
Mr. Long noted that Protestant believers are free to worship in 
their homes.  They are not, however, allowed to gather in worship 
until they registered as legal churches -- which they are only 
allowed to do if they can prove that they regularly gather 
together to worship.  Believers are also required to show that 
they have a physical church and a legal pastor -- despite the fact 
that they could not legally have either until they were 
registered.  Mr. Long then pointed out the government\'s conversion 
of most pre-1975 Protestant churches to other uses, such as health 
clinics.  While he claimed to have staff available to respond to 
requests for registration, it is difficult to see how any 
congregation can meet these Catch-22 requirements.  Deputy 
Director Long seemed to have missed completely the GVN\'s 
recognition of the SECV and the subsequent implementation of a 
system for registering Protestant \"associations\" and \"sub- 
associations.\"  (Post Note: In contrast, both Gia Lai and Dak Lak 
provinces have been visited by SECV representatives and their 
respective Committees on Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs 
have started processing Protestant registration requests.) 
 
No Social Evils, But Plenty of Dioxin 
------------------------------------- 
12.  (SBU)  DOLISA Director Tran Binh Trong noted that Kon Tum had 
fewer problems than other provinces with prostitution, drugs, and 
HIV/AIDS.  With such small numbers of prostitutes (50-60) and drug 
users (21), it was more economical to send them to a 
rehabilitation center in neighboring Gia Lai province, than build 
one in Kon Tum.  Most current HIV/AIDS cases are attributed to 
migrants from the north.  Regarding trafficking in persons, Mr. 
Trong nodded and said preventive measures are being considered to 
coincide with the opening of the international frontier pass and 
the two highways. 
 
13.  (SBU)  At the meeting\'s end,  Director Trong made an almost 
apologetic plea for assistance with the nearly 2400 children 
believed to have been affected by chemical agents during the war. 
Saying he \"didn\'t care about the politics, he just wanted to help 
the children,\" he lamented the central government\'s lack of funds 
to assist Kon Tum in caring for its disabled.  He seemed sincerely 
embarrassed to be asking a foreign government for support. 
(Post Note: Two NGOs, including U.S.-based Vietnam Assistance for 
the Handicapped - VNAH, carry out a few scattered programs 
centered mostly on education and the disabled.) 
 
14.  (SBU)  Comment:  After a year\'s hiatus, it was a new set of 
interlocutors in Kon Tum.  Vice Chairman Ha Ban, whose portfolio 
includes socio-cultural and educational affairs, and with whom 
ConGenoffs have met on three previous occasions, was on official 
business in Hanoi.  First Vice Chairman Hao, while more senior, 
was not quite in command of his brief.  Still, his matter-of-fact 
acknowledgement that local Lao, Cambodian, and Vietnamese 
authorities were cooperating to prevent \"illegal\" immigrants from 
crossing the border and to \"break up rebellious plots\" was new to 
us.  Likewise, Kon Tum\'s apparent decision to cast its economic 
lot not with the burgeoning economies of Ho Chi Minh City and 
Hanoi, but with other poor provinces in Laos, Burma and Cambodia - 
- where they might be the first among equals.  The Committee on 
Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs\' ignorance of or deliberate 
denial of the SECV\'s existence was troubling.  While on previous 
trips, ConGenoffs had found Vice Chairman Ban willing to engage on 
sensitive issues, on this trip the only bright lights were DPI\'s 
Director Chuong and DOLISA\'s Director Trong.

1. (SBU) Summary:  Despite a flurry of economic reforms and 
trade liberalization heralded by the signing of the 
Bilateral Trade Agreement over a year ago, Ho Chi Minh 
City\'s press reporting and cultural programs remain mired 
in self-censorship, media \"guidelines\" and an arbitrary 
permit process that strongly limit the freedom of 
expression for thoughtful writers, journalists, moviemakers 
and theater directors.  During the past 15 months, as Post 
has sponsored its first live cultural performances and 
broadened its contacts within media organizations and the 
artistic community, we too have experienced the gauntlet of 
obstacles created by groups of small-minded ideologues. 
End summary. 
 
NEWS MEDIA: WE KNOW THE TRUTH, WE JUST CAN\'T TELL IT 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
2.  (U) Ho Chi Minh City TV (HTV) is government-owned and 
the only local TV station in HCMC.  Domestic news programs 
follow a time-honored tradition of airing mostly positive 
stories about courtesy calls, government-organized seminars 
and conferences, and visiting dignitaries.  World news 
visual coverage has generally been fairly open, drawing on 
BBC, CNN and other news services.  However, there is no 
guarantee that the Vietnamese voiceover will bear any 
relationship to what the viewer sees on the TV screen. 
Coverage of the war in Iraq was one-sided.  There was no 
reporting about Iraqis celebrating Saddam\'s fall or 
toppling statues of him, let alone welcoming the coalition 
forces.  Entertainment programs are of fair quality for a 
developing country, but lack anything approaching 
contemporary political satire or serious talk shows about 
sensitive issues. 
 
3.  (U) Like the rest of Vietnam, the press in HCMC has 
ownership roots in the local government or Communist Party. 
A handful of the city\'s numerous newspapers and magazines 
are considered serious news sources.  They must adhere to 
unwritten guidelines, avoiding criticism of the government 
and the Party except in particular cases, such as certain 
corruption trials. 
 
4.  (SBU) A vivid example is the recent dismissal of the 
editor-in-chief of the \"Tuoi Tre\" newspaper, Mr. Le Van 
Nui.  \"Tuoi Tre\" is owned by the Youth Union of HCMC, a 
government-sanctioned mass organization.  Mr. Nui had been 
under a cloud of suspicion ever since his paper published a 
poll during President Clinton\'s visit in 2000.  This poll 
asked readers to rate the leaders they most admired.  The 
results showed that Mr. Clinton was more popular than Ho 
Chi Minh.  Authorities stripped Mr. Nui of his press 
association membership about a year ago, although he kept 
his top position at the paper until this month.  Then \"Tuoi 
Tre\'s\" focus on top GVN leaders implicated in a well- 
publicized criminal trial (the \"Nam Cam\" case, which opened 
this April) seemed to renew official interest in Mr. Nui\'s 
departure.  He has been replaced by a local book publisher, 
Mr. Le Hoang, who is respected for his business skills but 
who has no journalism experience.  Mr. Nui, in the 
meantime, has been sidelined into the directorship of Tuoi 
Tre News Group\'s real estate and land management firm. 
 
5.  (SBU) Coverage/commentary on the Iraq war in HCMC was 
negative, with the daily press running graphic photos of 
civilian casualties and editorial content focusing on the 
\"unwelcome American aggression.\"  Sources have told Post 
that media editors received written guidelines on Iraq war 
coverage.  Reporters and editors have said they know the 
real story of the coalition\'s victory, but were forbidden 
to report it. 
 
FILM: TREAD LIGHTLY 
------------------- 
6.  (SBU) The best-known recent case is the expulsion of 
film star Don Duong from the actors\' union.  Technically, 
he had violated a government rule for appearing in foreign 
films: submitting the script in advance for approval.  Don 
Duong and his family were subjected to police questioning 
and harassment for his \"betrayal of the homeland\" in movies 
such as \"Green Dragon\" (life in a Vietnamese refugee 
resettlement camp in the U.S.) and \"We Were Soldiers Once\" 
(a balanced portrayal of soldiers\' lives on both sides 
during the early days of the Vietnam War).  Blackballed by 
the film association, his children taunted and intimidated 
at school, menacing phone calls, \"invitations\" to the local 
police station, and vandalism at his sister\'s restaurant 
finally drove Don Duong and his family to emigrate to the 
U.S. (ref A).  The orchestrated media attacks and forced 
unemployment were pointed reminders to his fellow actors: 
stick to pure entertainment or politically correct drama. 
 
7.  (U) Two recent screen releases have mildly criticized 
the socio-cultural realities of contemporary Saigon.  \"Gai 
Nhay\" (\"Sensitive Girl\"), a film about the exploitation of 
bar girls, implicitly criticizes the poverty that drives 
them to that lifestyle and the callousness of a system that 
would create such an underclass.  Sex for drug money, heavy 
drinking, and slimy nouveau riche Vietnamese are also 
featured.  \"Luoi Troi\" (\"Tangled in the Sky\'s Web\") took 
the Golden Kite prize at Vietnam\'s Film Festival this year. 
It deals with the corruption of individual Party members 
and hints at institutional flaws, but stops short of 
explicitly criticizing the government.  It may have been a 
critical success at the Film Festival, but its commercial 
run has been much shorter than \"Gai Nhay\". 
 
8.  (SBU) The GVN recently moved to allow the establishment 
of private film companies.  To say there has not been a mad 
rush to take advantage of this \"opening\" would be an 
understatement.  The start-up process for the first 
company(ies) would likely be unpredictable and time- 
consuming.  Post believes that any company brave enough to 
wade through the application forms and obtain a license, 
would certainly not risk losing its investment in order to 
focus on social or political issues. 
 
9.  (U) In the words of one contact, media organizations 
and the film industry may criticize \"below the waist\" 
(lower-ranking members of the Party or government), but not 
take aim at the head (national leaders, ideology etc.) 
 
STAGE: AS IN \"ALL THE WORLD IS (NOT)\" 
------------------------------------- 
10. (SBU) Serious theater in HCMC is virtually non- 
existent.  The British Council sponsored a contemporary 
version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" last year.  Street people 
depicted actual characters, but the setting was blandly 
anyplace.  (Post Note: Homelessness and abandonment are 
increasing social problems in HCMC\'s growing metropolis of 
8 million, but absent any specific country references, few 
Vietnamese in the audience recognized the subtle message 
here.  End note.)  Playwrights, theater directors and 
actors practice self-censorship, since all performances 
must be reviewed by a board of censors prior to the formal 
opening.  Contacts tell us that if they wish to perform a 
small play or dance performance that may have daring or 
sensitive content, they simply call the performance \"a 
party\" and the audience is by invitation only. 
 
11.  (SBU) One prominent artist was visited by the police 
after leading a group of cultural performers to the U.S. 
Another colleague on the trip had made disparaging remarks 
about the Vietnamese Government, and so the nominal 
\"leader\" was called to account.  Understandably rattled 
that the GVN would hold an individual responsible for the 
conduct of an entire group, this artist was about to give 
up on ever traveling overseas again.  As months have 
passed, it now looks as though this contact will be able to 
resume international travel.  However, the avant-garde 
performances this individual is noted for Q with no 
political content Q are still under increased scrutiny. 
 
12.  (U) On the more humorous side, one traveling 
Vietnamese artist has been quoted in the Western media as 
saying that since his works are so sophisticated, they are 
\"beyond the comprehension\" of the cultural censors, so they 
don\'t come and interfere. 
 
MUSIC: VIETNAM\'S \"BOB DYLAN\" SILENCED 
------------------------------------- 
13.  (SBU) Pop singers tend not to have problems if they 
pay the proper licensing fees (indexed very high for profit 
events) and submit recordings of their music for review. 
One prominent singer, however, faces frequent harassment 
for his sexual orientation and for a well-known (by word of 
mouth) denunciation of the GVN, which he made from a stage 
in Hue several years ago. 
 
14.  (SBU) There are virtually no songs on HCMC Radio 
(government controlled) with political overtones.  HCMC 
Radio now bans a collection of songs by Trinh Cong Son, a 
popular anti-war/anti-U.S. activist during the 1960s and 
1970s, because listeners have been loosely interpreting his 
lyrics to include repression under the current government. 
 
15.  (U) Classical music concerts by the Ho Chi Minh City 
Symphony take place on the 9th of every month.  Post has 
noted that performing excerpts from classical standards Q 
including some excerpts from Bach/Mozart/Brahms requiems 
and masses Q draws no particular attention. 
 
EXHIBITIONS:  DON\'T SHOW US WHAT WE DON\'T WANT TO SEE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
16.  (U) Photo and art exhibits with non-revolutionary or 
non-liberation themes are rare.  In the spring 2002, a 
British- sponsored photojournalism workshop had its exhibit 
closed by the censors during the opening ceremony.  Several 
photos which portrayed the nitty-gritty realism of street 
life in HCMC were unacceptable to the culture censors. 
 
17.  (SBU) Post has been able to sponsor two exhibits 
related to the September 11 terrorist attacks (\"Headlines 
of History\" poster show in September 2002 and \"9/11: View 
from Ground Zero\" in February 2003).  These required an 
exhaustive searches for willing venues and a painstaking 
effort to detail to the censors the contents of the 
exhibits (photos, translations of each newspaper headline 
and caption etc.).  Even then, whether or not our co- 
sponsors would be issued the appropriate permits was in 
doubt to the last minute.  So while we have nudged open the 
door, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to arrange 
exhibits relating to American democracy and civil rights. 
 
WHO ARE THE CULTURAL BRAINS AND BRAWN? 
-------------------------------------- 
18.  (SBU) PA25, which is the cultural censorship branch of 
the Ministry of Public Affairs (\"the culture police\"), is 
often called into action.  In film actor Don Duong\'s case, 
PA25 officers were the ones who brought him in for 
questioning.  They tried to intimidate an apology and 
confession out of him.  On a recent trip to the central 
coast, when the People\'s Committee of Khanh Hoa Province 
did not want the Consul General to meet with professors and 
students at the local university, teachers\' training 
college, and school of music and art, PA25 was dispatched 
to tell at least one rector and his senior staff that they 
\"should find it inconvenient\" to be available for the CG\'s 
appointment.  Other confirmed interlocutors were suddenly 
summoned by PA25 to a meeting at the People\'s Committee 
just before the CG\'s scheduled arrival at their 
institution.  On another occasion in Binh Thuan Province, 
public security police and the People\'s Committee external 
relations officer jointly tried to prevent the DPO from 
visiting an ethnic Cham princess and her husband who run a 
small tourist museum, claiming the DPO needed prior 
\"permission.\" 
 
19.  (SBU) The gatekeepers for HCMC\'s flow of information 
and the performing and visual arts remain formidable.  The 
local Department of Culture and Information, the Party 
Commission on Ideology and Culture, the Peoples Aid 
Committee and the Ministry of Public Security continue to 
be narrow-minded, arbitrary and obstructionist when 
deciding which artistic work should be disseminated through 
the media, exhibitions, or live performances.  Post\'s own 
Vietnamese co-sponsors for cultural performances have had 
to submit the music and lyrics to the Department of Culture 
and Information in order to get a permit for each event. 
Post can only wonder.  Did these minders actually think we 
would try to sneak in a non-revolutionary piano note? 
 
20.  (SBU) COMMENT: Post believes there is no big cultural 
opening around the corner in southern Vietnam. Journalists 
and editors Q perhaps because they have relatively better 
access to sources and information Q are becoming more 
inquisitive.  And there are certainly individuals in both 
the media and the arts who follow their professional ethics 
and conscience.  However, if they fall into the bad graces 
of the powers-that-be (as in the case of film actor Don 
Duong and newspaper editor Le Van Nui), they cannot count 
on the support of colleagues who themselves can\'t afford to 
be blacklisted or stripped of their accreditation.  Post 
continues to build relations with journalists, artist, and 
the cultural gatekeepers, looking for appropriate 
candidates for the International Visitors program and other 
exchange opportunities.  As we keep pushing at the door of 
free expression, these programs will help carry them across 
the threshold with us.  YAMAUCHI

1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Ambassador met with Father Tran 
Thanh Phong, director of the Nha Trang Sea Star Seminary 
during a visit to Khanh Hoa province, May 15-17.  During 
the discussion, which took place in a large, well- 
maintained reception hall, Father Phong was careful not to 
explicitly criticize the GVN, but he did comment that it 
might be difficult for Western logic to comprehend \"the 
convolutedness\" of the Seminary/Catholic Church\'s 
relationship with the Vietnamese Government.  Father Phong 
painted a picture of a Catholic diocese that has made its 
peace with the GVN, reconciled to enjoying some freedoms 
while operating within certain restrictions.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (U) Ambassador Raymond F. Burghardt and the Consul 
General met for over an hour with Father Tran Thanh Phong. 
Father Phong described the Sea Star Seminary as responsible 
for training priests for three dioceses: Nha Trang (Khanh 
Hoa province and Phan Rang in Ninh Thuan province); Buon Me 
Thuot (Dak Lak province and part of Binh Phuoc province); 
and Quy Nhon (Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Quang Ngai 
provinces).  Six seminaries Q in Nha Trang, Hue, Hanoi, 
Thanh Hoa, Ho Chi Minh City, and Can Tho Q are officially 
recognized by the GVN.  Nha Trang was recognized ten years 
ago.  (Prior to 1975, the Sea Star Seminary was a minor 
one.  The major seminaries were those in Dalat and Saigon.) 
 
3.  (SBU) According to Father Phong, Sea Star Seminary 
currently has 84 seminarians who follow a six-year course 
of study.  Every two years, each diocese is permitted to 
select 10 candidates who have graduated from university. 
The \"ideal\" candidate is about 25 years-old, has a 
bachelor\'s degree, and gets the stamp of approval from the 
local People\'s Committee and Ministry of Public Security 
(MPS) for having a \"sound mind\" (here the priest smilingly 
tapped his head). 
 
4.  (SBU) The six-year training program includes two years 
of philosophy and four years of theology, as well as 
courses on politics and economics Q taught by professors 
assigned by the local authorities.  There is about a ten 
percent drop out rate, but usually not due to a diagnosis 
of wrong-headedness by the MPS.  The Ministry of Public 
Security and the local government make their appearance 
again at graduation, when they \"check\" the seminarians to 
ensure they are still of \"sound mind.\" 
 
5.  (U) After graduation, the seminarians are usually 
assigned as assistants for a two-year internship to 
ordained priests.  After a successful internship (and by 
that time, over the age of 30, the minimum age to become a 
priest in Vietnam), they are ordained.  The diocese then 
decides which parish to send the newly-ordained priest to - 
as a junior priest, who will eventually take over as the 
full parish priest.  There are currently 120 priests in the 
Nha Trang diocese, according to Father Phong, many of whom 
are old and infirm.  \"We need a younger generation,\" he 
emphasized.  Since the Sea Star Seminary is limited in its 
intake of seminarians, Father Phong was asked whether any 
devout Catholics go overseas to pursue their theological 
studies.  He noted that they could go overseas as regular 
students, but not as seminarians.  Only priests who are 
trained and ordained in Vietnam can serve here. 
 
6.  (SBU) Father Phong said that he and the Seminary get 
along with the provincial government, but are required to 
get permission from the authorities whenever they wanted to 
travel or meet with outsiders Q including priests and 
believers from other towns and diocese.  Local authorities 
must approve the Seminary\'s training curriculum, the 
professors/priests who will teach the classes, and their 
lesson plans.  There have been no foreign priests as 
teachers; the Seminary has never asked for permission 
because it \"knows the request will not be approved.\" (Post 
Note: Demonstrating that situations are relative and vary 
from province to province, it would appear Khanh Hoa 
province exercises stricter control over the Catholic 
Church than Ho Chi Minh City does.  The Catholic hierarchy 
in HCMC generally travels unimpeded and simply notifies 
local authorities of their plans Q sometimes after the 
fact.  They also meet with ConGenoffs and other \"outsiders\" 
without asking permission.  End note.) 
 
7.  (U) However, Sea Star Seminary has been able to send 
some faculty members to study in Rome, Paris, and the U.S. 
Right now, bioethics is a sensitive issue, and regional 
priests attended classes led by the Bishop of Can Tho 
earlier this month.  In response to a question from the 
Ambassador, Father Phong indicated that the Seminar 
receives some financial assistance from Rome and its own 
parishioners.  Individual overseas Vietnamese also donate, 
but on a case-by-case basis. 
 
8.  (SBU) During a brief tour of the Seminary, the 
Ambassador stopped by a darkened room with several 
computers.  Father Phong explained that while seminarians 
have access to the Internet, they are forbidden by the 
provincial government to download any files.  (Post Note: 
While we do not know specifically about the Catholic 
seminary in HCMC, in cities like HCMC and Danang, the 
internet cafes and universities can download from any 
website that is not firewalled by the government.  End 
note.)  The Sea Star Seminary itself is built on land 
granted to it in compensation for the old building (now a 
teachers\' college) in a different location.  Father Phong 
ruefully chuckled when he related that the local government 
said it was giving the Church a \"good deal.\" 
 
9.  (SBU) Comment:  Father Phong was an informative 
interlocutor who became more animated as the discussion 
progressed.  He acknowledged that Catholic life had been 
difficult after the war, but said things had improved over 
the past 10 years.  His statement that contemporary 
Vietnamese society is deteriorating because people say the 
right things, but do not act on principle or with virtue 
could be interpreted as an oblique criticism of Vietnam\'s 
current political system.  Although a priest, Father Phong 
seemed to place some faith in the \"yin\" and \"yang\" of life, 
and accept that in return for certain freedoms, there would 
be certain restrictions on the Catholic Church in Khanh Hoa 
province.   YAMAUCHI

1.  (U) The Most Venerable Thich Quang Do remains 
under  \"administrative surveillance,\" based on a 
decree, which although dated June 1, 2001, in fact has 
an effective time period of September 3, 1998 until 
September 3, 2003.  Post has seen at least one press 
release denouncing Thich Quang Do\'s continued \"pagoda 
arrest\" past June 1, but wishes to clarify that 
according to the refs and recent confirmation from 
Thich Tue Sy, September 3, 2003 has always been the 
correct expiration date. 
 
2.  (SBU) A junior monk whose duties have included 
looking after Thich Quang Do, related to Thich Tue Sy 
that Thich Quang Do is in good health and looks 
forward to being freed from administrative 
surveillance on September 3.  Thich Tue Sy attributed 
any confusion over the expiration date to overlapping 
decisions that were issued upon Thich Quang Do\'s 
release from prison in September 1998 under a special 
amnesty, and subsequently on May 31 and June 1, 2001. 
 
3.  (U) Thich Quang Do was originally sentenced to 
five years\' imprisonment and five years\' 
administrative surveillance in 1995.  Upon his release 
in September 1998, he was still subject to the five- 
year administrative surveillance requirement until 
September 3, 2003. 
 
4.  (U) After Thich Quang Do\'s failed attempt to 
\"rescue\" The Most Venerable Thich Huyen Quang from his 
pagoda in Quy Nhon and return with him to HCMC in May 
2001, two other decisions were issued on May 31 and 
June 1, 2001.  These decisions reaffirmed that the 
original five-year administrative surveillance period 
was still in effect until September 3, 2003. 
 
5.  (U) Post will continue to keep in contact with 
those close to Thich Quang Do and monitor the 
situation.

SUBJECT: INVITATIONS TO \"DISCUSS\" RELIGION IN DAK LAK PROVINCE 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  On May 29, ConGen Poloff and Pol/Econ assistant met 
with a reliable contact regarding the situation of unregistered 
religious minority groups in Dak Lak province.  The contact 
gave ConGenoff a collection of written materials -- some 
official-looking original documents and several photocopied 
\"invitations\" from district and commune police offices in Dak 
Lak.  There were also photocopies of \"invitations\" from a local 
Fatherland Front Committee.  The invitations ask the 
individuals to meet with officials to discuss GVN policy on 
religious affairs.  According to our contact, however, during 
these meetings each individual was asked to sign a document 
saying s/he would disband the unrecognized church council to 
which they belonged.  The documents originate in either Krong 
No District or Truong Xuan Commune (Dak Song District).  Poloff 
was unable to verify the authenticity of these documents but 
has no reason to doubt the source\'s sincerity. 
 
2. (SBU) Post\'s contact indicated that the invitations were 
given to individuals he personally knew in Dak Lak province. 
He received the documents from the pastors to whose 
congregations these individuals belong -- with the agreement to 
protect the information and bring it to the USG and other 
groups concerned about the treatment of unrecognized religious 
minorities in the Central Highlands. 
 
3.  (SBU) The invitations are dated between January 18 and May 
2 and were addressed to the following people: 
 
Y\'Chroih 
Y Chroih Bap Rok 
Y Chroih Ma Roc (a.k.a. Y Chroih Ma Roh) 
Y Tai \"Ma Jay\" (a.k.a. Y Tai Ma Jani) 
Y Son 
H\'Pleh (Ami Vol) 
Y\'Hoan B\'Krong 
Y Duc K Man 
 
4.  (SBU) The invitations originating with the police in Krong 
No District requested the individuals to meet with officers at 
the police station to \"work\".  This verb is commonly taken to 
mean that the invited person will have to discuss certain 
subjects with the police. 
 
5.  (SBU) The invitations originating with the Chairman or 
Vice-Chairman of the Fatherland Front Committee of Truong Xuan 
Commune, Dak Song District, state the purpose of the meeting is 
\"to review Decision No. 26/ND-CP regarding religious affairs, 
as per step 2 of the plan to disband the Protestant Church 
Council\", or \"to discuss the religious situation\". 
 
6.  (SBU) According to Post\'s contact, the pastors of these 
individuals reported that each time the individual arrived at 
the required time and place, s/he would be lectured by the 
official on the law relating to the recognition of churches in 
Vietnam.  Then the individual would be asked to sign a paper 
agreeing to disband the lay church council of the unrecognized 
Protestant church to which s/he belonged.  If the individual 
did not agree to sign, s/he had to stay in the office until 
close of business.  Post\'s contact said that sometimes this 
daily summons and \"office detention\" would continue for up to 
two weeks. 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment: This is the first time Post has seen what 
appears to be an  official paper request to disband a house 
church council.  As far as we know, the GVN\'s official 
recognition of the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV) did not stipulate a limit on the number of churches that 
could be recognized within each district within a province.  In 
previous discussions with the Ethnic Minority and Religious 
Affairs Committees of Dak Lak and Gia Lai Provinces, committee 
members never mentioned a limit on the number of churches, but 
did say each \"sub-association\" seeking recognition as a church 
should have a minimum of about 100 members.  However, Post\'s 
contact has indicated that when his pastor friends discussed 
applying for official GVN recognition through the SECV, they 
were told by district officials there could only be one 
recognized Protestant church -- of any denomination --  per 
district.  Post\'s contact said that believers of all sects have 
been told they must consolidate with the the single recognized 
Protestant church in their district in order to be considered 
legal.  (All house churches and their church councils remain 
technically illegal.)  ConGenoffs will pursue this issue with 
provincial officials and reliable contacts.  End comment.

SUBJECT: NAM CAM TRIAL IN FINAL STAGES 
 
REF:  HCMC 00189 
 
1.  (U) Convening after a 10-day recess that capped a trial which 
ran from February 25 - May 24, the People\'s Court of Ho Chi Minh 
City gathered June 4 to read the results of the case 
investigations and the verdicts for the 155 defendants in the 
trial of the underworld kingpin Truong Van Cam (a.k.a. Nam Cam). 
As expected, all 155 defendants were found guilty.  Their 
sentences will be delivered June 5 at 2:00 pm. 
 
2.  (U) Post\'s repeated requests to gain access to the courtroom 
or the press gallery to listen to the verdicts were denied, with 
the External Relations Office (local branch of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs) citing space limitations.  ConGenoffs were 
permitted to enter a large courtyard outside the courthouse, 
where hundreds of family members and onlookers gathered to listen 
to the proceedings, broadcast by speaker from the courtroom. 
People spoke in hushed tones, becoming still at the crucial 
moment when the verdict for their family member was read or when 
unexpected information was introduced from the case 
investigations. 
 
3.  (U) At precisely 4:00 pm on June 4, a bell rang inside the 
courtroom concluding the day\'s events.  After several people 
filed out of the building, a crowd of around 30 police gathered 
at the top of the steps to the courthouse, while about 30 more 
flanked the perimeter fences keeping the crowds back and the 
parking area clear.  A parade of trucks and armored vehicles, 
escorted by roughly 40 traffic police and numerous riot police, 
arrived to take the defendants back to prison.  The 155 prisoners 
emerged, dressed in white and green striped uniforms, each with 
an attendant police officer, and descended the courthouse steps 
to the vehicles.  Members of the crowd called out to their 
parents, siblings and children.  Nam Cam emerged, gaunt, gray- 
haired, but smiling, to shouts and applause from the crowd, which 
accorded him celebrity status.  Slowly the trucks started up, 
turned on their sirens, and carried their cargo away. 
 
4.  (SBU) Circulating among the members of the crowd and 
listening to the proceedings, ConGenoffs perceived mixed feelings 
about the trial and its outcome.  On the one hand, the trial 
received broad local and some international media coverage, and 
the proceedings were broadcast to the public in the courtyard and 
will be televised during the reading of the sentences tomorrow. 
One young lawyer said that the case gave him new hope for the 
future of law and litigation in Vietnam.  For the first time, he 
explained, the defense attorneys for the defendants in this case 
were allowed to meet their clients prior to the trial, had access 
to the statements that were collected during the case 
investigations, and were able to present arguments in court that 
were critical of the government\'s handling of the case and its 
interpretation of the law. 
 
5.  (SBU) On the other hand, during a case investigation that was 
read today, the court said it had to consider the patriotic 
revolutionary past of the defendant\'s father as bearing weight in 
determining the defendant\'s sentence.  Local newspapers also ran 
several articles criticizing the defense attorneys for saying the 
government had used illegal methods to conduct their 
investigations. (Note: The Hanoi Bar Association reportedly spoke 
out to defend these attorneys. End note.)  Finally, the verdicts 
read by the court cited only the information revealed in the 
investigation prior to the trial, not the arguments or facts put 
forward during the trial by the defense attorneys. 
 
6.  (SBU) There is general agreement that the trial is important, 
but mixed feelings about its wider implications for fighting 
corruption.  One spectator, who lives in Nam Cam\'s neighborhood, 
said he had considered him a \"humanitarian,\" helping poor people 
by providing coffins for their deceased relatives.  But he also 
said that when he learned of the horrible things that Nam Cam had 
done, he wanted to see justice served.  Another spectator said he 
came to the courthouse to hear the verdict and sentence because 
he didn\'t trust what might be printed in the newspapers.  Several 
members of the crowd echoed this sentiment, adding they wanted to 
be there at this moment in history, when justice was served in 
Vietnam and even policemen and government officials were called 
to account.  ConGenoffs will report on the trial in greater 
detail after its conclusion.

RECEIVE 4-10 YEARS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 00189    B) HCMC 00492 
 
The high-profile trial of 155 individuals involved in 
organized crime associated with Truong Van Cam (a.k.a. Nam 
Cam) drew to a close on June 5 with a three-hour recitation of 
their sentences.  As rumored, the underworld kingpin Nam Cam 
received two death sentences (by firing squad) for murder and 
bribery, as well as a total of 42 years in jail for five other 
crimes.  The three high-ranking GVN officials who were 
convicted all received prison sentences: 
 
a) Pham Sy Chien, former deputy head of the Supreme People\'s 
Prosecution Panel in Hanoi (6 years); 
 
b) Bui Quoc Huy, Deputy Minister of Public Security in Hanoi 
during July-August 2002 and former Director of Ho Chi Minh 
City Police during 1996-2001 (4 years); 
 
c) Tran Mai Hanh, former Director of the Voice of Vietnam 
State Radio and General Secretary of the Vietnamese Journalist 
Association (10 years). 
 
These three former GVN officials are still at large and have 
three months to appeal their sentences to the Supreme People\'s 
Court in Hanoi before being arrested.  Thirteen of the 
defendants in jail were released for time served, and the 
remainder of those currently in jail still have the right to 
appeal.  A total of six death sentences and five life 
sentences were handed down.  Two journalists were found guilty 
of receiving bribes and were sentenced to 10-12 years.  There 
was a noticeable increased plainclothes security presence in 
the HCMC People\'s Court courtyard, where a crowd of onlookers 
had gathered to hear the sentencing.  Contacts from yesterday 
were more inhibited today about offering their opinions.  Post 
will report septel in greater detail.

SUBJECT: NAM CAM TRIAL: A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR 
JUDICIAL REFORM IN VIETNAM? 
 
1.  Summary.  One day after the conclusion of the biggest trial 
related to corruption and organized crime in the history of 
Vietnam, the Vietnamese press is claiming that the judicial 
system has fundamentally changed.  The conviction of 18 GVN 
officials on charges of corruption and 136 private citizens for 
crimes ranging from murder to usury, while perhaps only the tip 
of the iceberg, seemed to bring some satisfaction to a public 
seeking justice.  There remains considerable skepticism, 
however, that this will reverse the tide of widespread 
corruption in Vietnam.   There was greater optimism about reform 
of the trial process, since in this trial the court gave defense 
attorneys greater access to the criminal investigations against 
their clients, greater access to their clients, and greater 
freedom of speech.  While the sentences may not have been 
uniformly applied between private citizens and government 
officials, and there is ongoing debate about specific 
individuals and/or charges, there was a sense that the 
convictions and sentences were basically fair.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Was Nam Cam Really the Biggest Fish? 
------------------------------------ 
 
2.  The headliner in the case was the organized crime kingpin 
Truong Van Cam (a.k.a. Nam Cam), whose penetration of HCMC 
police was allegedly so pervasive that a special police task 
force from other provinces had to be brought in to arrest him. 
In jail since December 2001, on June 5, 2003 he received two 
death sentences -- for the murder of Dung Ha and for bribery -- 
and a total of 42 years in prison for the additional crimes of 
causing intentional harm, organized gambling, concealing 
criminals and trying to flee the country.  During the pre-trial 
investigation and in trial testimony Nam Cam denied the charge 
of ordering the death of Dung Ha, a rival gangster.  Press 
reports said he plans to appeal the verdicts and sentences in 
his case.  But even if the sentence for murder is overturned, 
Nam Cam is unlikely to escape death by firing squad for the 
bribery conviction.  Both he and his lawyer told the 
international press they believed the trial was fair. 
 
3.  A total of 19 government officials were charged with crimes 
related to the Nam Cam syndicate.  Eighteen of them -- including 
Tran Mai Hanh(former head of Voice of Vietnam state radio) and 
Pham Sy Chien (former deputy chief of the Supreme People\'s 
Prosecutor\'s Office), both expelled from the Communist Party 
(CP) Central Committee (reftel) -- were sentenced to jail terms. 
The defense attorney for one official -- HCMC police detective 
Lam Xuan Phat -- succeeded in having the charges against his 
client dropped, because the statute of limitations had expired 
for any investigation into a crime he was accused of committing 
in 1988.  The three highest-ranking former GVN officials have 
not yet been taken into custody.  They will appeal their 
sentences to the Supreme Court in Hanoi.  While all but one of 
the government officials accused has been sentenced to jail, 
another 72 government officials from 37 different 
departments/organizations have been disciplined.  This includes 
52 policemen who have been suspended or removed from duty.  Many 
of the GVN officials were also expelled from party 
organizations, as an administrative punishment.  The HCMC 
People\'s Court also delivered 24 suspended sentences and 
released 10 individuals for time served or pending further 
investigation into their cases. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
Justice Better Served?  What Was Different This Time Around 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
4.  Several high-ranking GVN officials announced to the 
international media early on during the Nam Cam investigation 
that this would be a model case for reform within the justice 
system.  According to local Vietnamese lawyers and legal 
analysts who have been following the trial, this has been true 
in limited measure.  The Vietnamese legal system is loosely 
based on the French civil law system.  When an individual is 
arrested for breaking the law, the person is put into detention 
for up to four months while the criminal investigators prepare 
the case for prosecution.  Prior to the Nam Cam case, although 
exceptions have been known to occur, the individual was 
generally not allowed to meet with a defense attorney during 
this \"investigation\" period.  However, over the past year, a 
number of attorneys defending clients in the Nam Cam case have 
been able to meet with their clients -- whether in prison or at 
large -- to discuss defense strategy. 
 
5.  In the Vietnamese system, after the investigation phase is 
over, the investigator gives the results to the prosecutor\'s 
office.  The prosecutor\'s office then submits an analysis of the 
portions of the legal code the accused has allegedly violated. 
It also proposes a range of sentences based on these violations 
to the panel of judges who will hear the case in trial.  One 
legal analyst close to the Nam Cam case told us the Politburo 
had a great deal of input into what the eventual charges and 
sentences would be.  On the other hand, this analyst added, 
usually the results of an investigation are not available to the 
defense attorney until the first day of the trial, making it 
very difficult to mount a defense.  During the Nam Cam case, 
however, a number of defense attorneys were able to obtain the 
results of the investigations into their clients\' alleged crimes 
prior to the trial. 
 
6.  At trial, the panel of judges listens to arguments from the 
prosecution and defense, and decides on the sentence, usually 
within the range proposed by the prosecutor.  Prior to the Nam 
Cam case, if the defense attorney attempted to present a line of 
reasoning that did not directly flow from the investigation, or 
criticized the facts presented by the prosecution as revealed in 
the investigation, the panel of judges would often silence the 
attorney, claiming that the argument was beyond the scope of the 
trial or simply \"inappropriate\".  However, one observer who 
attended part of the trial said that during the Nam Cam case, 
several defense attorneys pursued lines of questioning that did 
not reflect the \"facts\" of the investigation as presented by the 
prosecution, and the panel of judges did not overrule these 
attorneys.  In what several lawyers described to ConGenoff as a 
highly unusual occurrence, the prosecution was almost uniformly 
quiet, while the judges pursued more lines of questioning with 
the defense attorneys. 
 
7.  The same observer criticized the court for some of its 
actions.  He noted that the court did not pursue several senior 
government officials who had been subpoenaed but failed to 
appear.  The HCMC People\'s Court excused their absences for 
health reasons or with no explanation. 
 
8.  The actual decision on sentencing may also have been 
inappropriately influenced.  After the conclusion of the trial 
period on May 22, the court adjourned for 10 days, during which 
the panel of judges was to deliberate over the sentences. 
During this period, the Chief Judge traveled to Hanoi, a move 
that one Vietnamese lawyer contact interpreted to mean he had 
gone to receive instructions from the Politburo or Central 
Committee.  There was widespread discussion in the local 
newspapers as to which GVN or CP organ would ultimately 
determine the fate of the accused, and the international media 
called Nam Cam\'s death sentence a \"foregone conclusion.\"  Legal 
analysts considered ten days a relatively short timeframe in 
which to decide the fate of 155 individuals accused of multiple 
crimes. 
 
9.  In the end, the various sentences handed down were not 
perceived as excessive or unfair either in the media or among 
the Vietnamese we talked with.  Rumors that some GVN officials 
would be given disproportionately light sentences had been 
sparked after June 4, when a judge prefaced the reading of their 
verdicts with the caveat that the \"revolutionary sacrifices\" of 
those officials and/or their family members would be taken into 
consideration during sentencing.  There appeared to be some 
relief that the key government officials had received jail 
sentences.  Since there is no public court record to disclose 
the details of the investigation and the arguments made at 
trial, the appropriateness of the sentencing will remain a 
source of legal debate. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Media Access:  Organized but not Controlled 
------------------------------------------- 
 
10.  During the course of the trial, local Vietnamese reporters 
said they were granted reasonable access.  Daily coverage of the 
trial appeared in all five of Ho Chi Minh City\'s daily 
newspapers.  HCMC\'s two evening television news shows only 
reported on the trial\'s major developments: the testimony of 
government officials, the opening and closing statements, and 
the sentencing phase of the trial.  Only the Ho Chi Minh City 
state-run television station, HTV, was allowed to have 
television cameras in the courtroom.  Cameras were present for 
the duration of the trial, although only opening statements and 
the sentencing  were broadcast live on television.  Members of 
the international press were only permitted to cover the trial\'s 
opening statements and the sentencing phase. 
 
11.  Media coverage was organized, as each Vietnamese newspaper 
had to register with the Court for access to the proceedings.  A 
maximum of two reporters and one photographer from each 
newspaper were permitted to cover the entire trial.  Only 
reporters who had registered and received a press badge could 
enter the courthouse.  Due to space limitations, journalists 
were funneled into a small room where they could watch the trial 
via closed-circuit TV.  At the start of each day, photographers 
were allowed into the courtroom for ten minutes to photograph 
the defendants. 
 
12.  According to a reporter who works for Tuoi Tre and HCMC 
Radio, Vietnamese reporters were only censored in their coverage 
of the trial by their editors when the subject matter encroached 
on \"national security\" (loosely defined).  This reporter did not 
specify what comments were cut, but said journalists were able 
to include quotes from the prosecution, defense attorneys and 
defendants obtained inside or outside the courtroom. 
 
13.   Comment:  Mr. Bui Hoang Danh, one of the judges in the 
trial, tried to make the point repeatedly to the media that this 
case was not about widespread corruption, but about the crimes 
of private citizens and public officials alike.  This became a 
point of distinction between the local media, which portrayed 
the case as \"the case of Nam Cam and his associates,\" and the 
international media, who described it as a major corruption 
scandal.  A few local legal analysts view this case as 
significant because the disparities in sentencing between 
average (if scumbag) Joes and mighty government officials was 
not extreme.  Despite the \"revolutionary\" sacrifices by some of 
the officials being tried, all but one received prison 
sentences, including up to 12 years.  This is a message that has 
met with widespread approval.  Still, a lot can happen between 
now and the appeal.  Once the dust settles on this large-scale 
organized crime and corruption trial, we will see whether the 
GVN will gear itself up for a sustained crackdown on official 
corruption.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM ISSUES TEXTILE QUOTA ALLOCATION GUIDELINES 
 
REF:  HCMC 297 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The GVN has announced quota allocation 
criteria for textile and garment exports to the U.S.  Sixty- 
five to seventy percent of quota will be allocated based on 
past performance over the period of calendar year 2002 and the 
first quarter of 2003.  The remainder will be issued to new 
companies and firms meeting a range of other criteria.  AMCHAM 
and others had lobbied strongly for quota to go first to past 
performance.  The allocation of the performance-based quota 
should be a relatively transparent process, but criteria for 
the remainder has yet to be clarified.  Many buyers and 
producers worry that this could allow quota to be steered to 
politically connected firms.  The biggest problem, however, is 
that contrary to the circular itself, which calls for 80% of 
performance quota to be allocated by the end of May, no such 
allocation has yet occurred. Producers and buyers are becoming 
increasingly nervous that as all companies, whether eligible 
for performance-based quota or not, continue to ship, available 
quota shrinks every day.  Producers still argue, however, that 
quota is still a competitive advantage over China.  End 
Summary. 
 
Quota Criteria allocates 65-70% to Past Performance 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (U) In a joint circular issued by the Ministries of Trade, 
Planning and Investment, and Industry, the GVN spelled out 
guidance for quota allocation for export of textile and apparel 
to the U.S. market.  The circular, dated May 27 and released a 
few days later, covers quota allocation for the period from May 
1 to December 31, 2003. 
 
3.  (U) Depending on quota category, 65-70% of available quota 
will be allocated based on past performance, with past 
performance defined as shipments to the U.S. market during 
calendar year 2002 and the first quarter of 2003.  Most of the 
remaining quota (from 23-28%, again depending on category) will 
be allocated according to a variety of criteria: 
 
--To enterprises with high production and export capacity, but 
which just began to export in late 2002 or early this year. 
 
--To enterprises which have no \"past performance\" record of 
export, but which now have export contracts which can be filled 
with current capacity.  \"Priority [will be] given to 
enterprises that have invested in modern equipment and 
technology to produce textile and apparel products of high 
quality for export.\" 
 
--Three percent in this category will be reserved for companies 
that have signed contracts directly with U.S. importers and 
distributors. 
 
Ministry of Trade officials explained that they decided to 
establish a range on quota distribution to allow them the 
flexibility to fine tune the system as they are implementing 
it. 
 
4.  (U) The remaining 7 percent of quota will be reserved for 
enterprises using \"significant\" amounts of materials and 
fabrics made in Vietnam or for enterprises located in 
\"economically difficult areas\" which have production capacity 
and export contracts. 
 
 
Schedule is Already Slipping 
---------------------------- 
 
5.  (U) The circular directs that the quota be allocated 
according to a schedule that has already slipped.  Eighty 
percent of performance-based quota for companies that had 
already properly documented past performance was to have been 
issued by the end of May.  This has yet to occur.  Eighty 
percent of performance-based quota for other companies and 
quota based on the other criteria is to be issued by the end of 
June.  According to Ministry of Trade officials, they plan to 
allocate the remaining 20% of the quota once the Visa 
Certification system is in place. 
6.  (SBU) The circular prohibits quota from being transferred 
or sold between companies and notes that companies that do not 
utilize all their quota must surrender the excess quota in 
writing by October 1 to qualify for the same quota level next 
year.  Visas will be required for shipments after July 1. NOTE: 
Privately, MOT officials has expressed their concern about the 
task of administering the quota system, especially in light of 
the minimal prep time they have had to get it up and running. 
We\'re not surprised that they are running behind schedule but 
believe that they are making a sincere effort in the face of 
intense pressure and outside scrutiny. 
 
The Devil is in the Details 
--------------------------- 
7.  (SBU) Several foreign buyers and producers have told 
econoff that they believe the performance-based quota will be 
allocated in a relatively fair and transparent manner, but they 
are much more pessimistic about the allocation of the quota 
based on the other criteria.  Rumors have already started to 
circulate that one Jaguar-driving son of the key MOT official 
responsible for quota is an avenue for obtaining quota. 
Although the circular states that allocation shall be \"carried 
out in a transparent, reasonable manner\" the devil is in the 
details and evidently buyers and producers here believe in the 
devil.  For all of the efforts at transparency - the circular 
as well as export data for the month of May appears on the 
Ministry of Trade website, and the ministries involved 
solicited comments from buyers and producers - it is far from 
clear how the non-performance quota will be allocated. Although 
Ministry of Trade officials verbally explained to us their 
intended process and assured us of their intent to be as 
transparent and as fair as possible, the published criteria are 
vague and could create a situation where decisions are made on 
a case-by-case basis, allowing for outside pressure to be 
brought to bear on MOT.  And even though quota is not to be 
sold or transferred, some producers have told econoff that they 
are already looking for quota from companies that might have a 
surplus. 
 
8.  (SBU) For example, 7% of the quota is reserved for 
companies using local materials or located in \"economically 
difficult areas,\" but the circular did not define \"economically 
difficult areas,\" nor did it specify local content criteria. 
(Note:  We assume that MOT will use the GVN\'s list of 
economically depressed or underdeveloped regions as established 
by the Ministry of Planning and Investment under its poverty 
alleviation program.)    MOT has assured us they are working on 
the criteria and procedures to evaluate the applications of new 
enterprises seeking quota or those that just began shipping at 
the end of last year, but was unable to provide details or a 
firm implementation date.    One sweater manufacturer which has 
invested $5 million in a plant in Ho Chi Minh City told econoff 
that although his company had been registered here for about 
two years, exports to the U.S. have so far been relatively 
small, because of the time it took to get the factory up and 
running and to hire and train his staff.  The criteria as 
issued do not give him any hint of whether or how he will get 
quota. 
 
Picking Favorites 
----------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Buyers, producers and even Vietnamese officials point 
out that this lack of clarity will help connected firms get the 
quota they need to export.  Some of the criteria seem designed 
to benefit state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - such as the 
criteria which base some allocation on \"capacity of production 
and export\".  The guidance measures capacity in part as number 
of workers, machinery, etc, which SOEs have in abundance. 
AMCHAM, by contrast, had suggested that any additional quota be 
based on paid-in capital, which would have favored foreign- 
invested firms (Reftel).  SOEs are also more likely to locate 
in those economically difficult areas which will receive 
additional quota. 
 
10.  (SBU) All business sector interlocutors stressed, however, 
that the lack of clarity in assigning the non-performance quota 
would not simply benefit SOEs, but would benefit firms with 
strong political connections or those seeking to make them. 
Many producers stressed that some large private Vietnamese 
firms were very well connected and would have little problem 
obtaining the quota that they needed.  One Vietnamese private 
sector factory owner close to high-level officials told econoff 
weeks before this guidance was released he had absolutely no 
concerns about obtaining the quota that he needed. 
 
11.  (U) Small private firms were likely to do less well 
however.  Many of these firms have limited \"past performance\" 
and even fewer political connections.  One Hong Kong producer 
noted that many of these private firms worked as subcontractors 
for larger firms when producing for the U.S. market.  In such 
cases performance quota would accrue to the consignor, not to 
the subcontractor. 
 
12.  (SBU) According to one Vietnamese official, Korean firms 
also influenced the design of the allocation process.  A large 
group of foreign buyers and producers had been recommending 
through a joint AMCHAM committee that companies with past 
performance receive quota which at least matched past 
performance.  Koreans, many of whom recently opened factories 
and had little or no past performance argued for limiting quota 
based on past performance to allow for quota allocations to new 
firms.  According to this official, representations were made 
by the Korean Ambassador to Trade Minister Tuyen, and the Prime 
Minister of Korea made the same appeal in writing to the 
highest levels of the GVN.  Evidently, it worked.  However, we 
should note that several U.S. firms expressed exactly the same 
concern to us and are very pleased that MOT included provisions 
for new firms. 
 
Quota Disappearing by the Day 
----------------------------- 
 
13.  (U) A larger worry among foreign buyers and producers is 
the timing of the actual quota allocations, which have yet to 
occur.  MOT officials told us in late May that they intended to 
allocate quota by the end of May for those firms that had met 
the May 15 deadline for applications.  The circular in fact 
states that 80% of the performance quota will be allocated \"by 
the end of May.\"  As of June 5, this had yet to occur, although 
firm hear that the allocation is coming \"any day.\"  Quota 
covers the eight-month period from May 1 to the end of the 
year.  Without quota allocations, product continues to be 
shipped madly to the U.S.  Producers are worried that when 
quota is finally allocated, much of it will have already been 
used up - and with good reason.  According to the Ministry of 
Trade website (www.mot.gov.vn), as of June 3, nine of the 22 
categories have already shipped over 25% of the available quota 
for the rest of the year. (Note:  because the textile agreement 
took effect on May 1 this year, only two-thirds of the total 
annual quota is available in each category for the period May 1 
- December 31, 2003.)    In the two largest categories 338/339 
22% of the available quota has already been shipped and 
category 347/348 has already shipped 30% of the available 
quota. 
 
14.  (SBU) Comment:  Even though the MOT circular instructions 
lacked adequate detail (not uncommon), and despite the delay in 
quota allocation, buyers and producers are still bullish on 
Vietnam.  They are pleased the circular calls for a sizable 
portion of quota to be allocated based on past performance. 
Vietnam\'s competitive advantage is still quota, one producer 
told econoff.  He estimated that production costs are still 15% 
higher than China and operating costs are 20% higher, but quota 
is still cheaper than in China.  With most of it free here for 
past producers, he would somehow acquire the rest of what he 
needed from the allocation process or, although technically 
illegal, by buying surplus from other producers.  The biggest 
problem now is getting quota allocations issued before even 
more available quota is used up.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANTS IN QUIET STAND OFF WITH POLICE OVER NEW HOUSE 
CHURCH 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  A group of 50-100 Protestant believers has been working 
around the clock for two days to construct a new (unrecognized) 
branch church in HCMC, in defiance of local police and government 
officials.  The situation has remained peaceful thus far, but at 
least one pastor on the scene has encouraged his followers to 
physically resist any attempts to stop construction or disperse 
the believers.  Protestants working at the site say anywhere from 
50 to 200 police and other local government officials have been 
present at various times during the construction.  They accuse the 
government of employing undercover policemen and hired thugs in an 
attempt to provoke a confrontation.  Police  allegedly interfered 
with the shipment of construction materials -- taking custody of 
at least one vehicle, though after the supplies had been removed 
by the Protestant believers.  Police have also allegdly warned 
local merchants not to sell to the group.  In spite of this, 
construction of the prefabricated structure, which began at 5:00 
am on June 9, is slated to be completed early on June 11 local 
time.  Some pastors at the scene took the initiative, contacted a 
Time correspondent in Hanoi, and were interviewed by telephone 
today. 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to regular ConGen contacts in the Protestant 
community, the new church is being constructed on a parcel of land 
in District 2 owned by a GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical 
Church of Vietnam (SECV) pastor from District 9.  The government 
ordered an earlier church on the same site demolished some years 
ago, after which the congregation continued to worship outdoors 
for several more months before the government finally clamped down 
completely.  Local authorities have allegedly denied numerous 
written applications over the intervening years to build a new 
structure on this site.  The reason given is that while the 
District 9 church has been recognized, a church on this District 2 
parcel of land has neither been approved for construction nor as a 
\"branch\" of the older church.  Post\'s contacts admit that 
officials at the ward level have apparently issued an order 
explicitly denying permission to build and authorizing local 
officials to remove any illegal construction.  But they also claim 
that the HCMC People\'s Committee and Committee on Religious 
Affairs have recently given them some form of unwritten, informal 
consent to proceed. 
 
3.  (SBU)  A Protestant pastor not directly associated with the 
new church told Poloff this evening that the law actually allows 
construction to begin if the government fails to respond to an 
application for a building permit within three weeks.  ConGen is 
unable to verify this assertion at this time, but this could be 
the passive, informal \"permission\" on which these believers base 
their case.  In the meantime, this same pastor believes the police 
are unlikely to crack down on such a large group out in the open.

SUBJECT: POLICE QUESTION BUILDER AS CHURCH CONSTRUCTION CONTINUES 
 
REF:  HCMC 0520 
 
1.  (SBU)  Mr. Le Van Dung, unofficial contractor for a Protestant 
house church currently under construction in HCMC\'s District 2 
(reftel), met with police this morning in response to a third 
invitation to discuss his activities at the site.  The first 
invitation, delivered June 9, summoned him to discuss the \"illegal 
construction of a house church.\"  The other two invitations 
dropped the reference to any particular activities, so Mr. Dung 
decided \"to accept\". 
 
2.  (SBU)  A long-time ConGen Protestant contact, claiming to be 
the legal representative of the new church, accompanied Mr. Dung 
to the nearby offices of the local police investigative unit at 
8:30 a.m. local time on June 17.  While police prevented him from 
sitting with his \"client\" during the 90-minute interview, the 
contact was able to overhear the questioning from a vantage point 
less than five yards away.  He said the police concentrated almost 
entirely on Mr. Dung\'s background -- family, education, and prior 
work experience -- rather than on current efforts to build the 
house church.  Mr. Dung signed a report of the meeting before 
returning to his home.  As he departed, police said they would 
soon tear down the house church. 
 
3.  (SBU)  While construction continues unabated, efforts are 
hampered by an inadequate supply of construction materials and a 
lack of experienced workers.  A handful of undercover police 
officers maintain their watch over the project, but have not 
interfered with the workers or the structure.  During a recent 
meeting to be reported septel, HCMC People\'s Committee Vice 
Chairman Nguyen Van Dua told Consul General there is no regulation 
allowing construction to proceed if local authorities fail to 
respond to a building permit application within a specified 
timeframe.  In other words, there is no such thing as \"tacit 
approval.\"  He did, however, acknowledge real problems in 
enforcing regulations to prevent illegal construction in HCMC. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment: This pastors vs. the police standoff has been 
going on for over a week now.  If the pastors are hoping to make a 
point about religious freedom by engaging in construction without 
a building permit, their assumption that they have some form of 
\"tacit approval\" (reftel) may not, in fact, help their case.  Post 
will continue to monitor the situation.

Summary 
----------- 
1.  (SBU) The textile quota allocation process, which began on 
June 11, has drawn widespread complaints from buyers and producers 
and has already gone through at least one revision.  In Phase I of 
the allocation process - in which companies receive a share of 
quota based on past performance - many companies received much 
less quota than they expected, when compared with their 
calculations based on their interpretation of the criteria earlier 
publicized by the GVN.  In a meeting with a group of foreign 
industry representatives, officials from VITAS, the Vietnam 
Textile Apparel and Textile Association, acknowledged that the 
Ministry of Trade (MOT) had been holding back or under-allocating 
quota based on past performance.  At the meeting, industry reps 
stated they were prepared to bring their concerns to the U.S. 
Ambassador and to the Minister of Trade.  According to the foreign 
industry reps, MOT officials then agreed to once again update 
performance-based quota, this time using the criteria as 
originally stipulated in the government circular.  (Post Note: MOT 
has told Embassy Hanoi that they already apply these criteria). 
Transparency is - apparently - a work in progress.  Post will 
continue to monitor the business pulse in HCMC.  End Summary. 
 
Better Late and Incomplete -- Than Never 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
2.  (SBU) On June 11, the GVN issued the first textile quota 
allocations in \"Phase I\" of the quota allocation process. 
According to foreign buyers and producers, as well as the Vietnam 
Textile and Apparel Association (VITAS), the lists were late and 
incomplete.  MOT released an updated list over the weekend, but 
companies still complained to Congen Econoff that the quota 
allocations were incomplete.  In this Phase I allocation, which 
was to distribute 80 percent of the performance-based quota to 
companies who had submitted timely documentation, several 
companies told ConGen Econoff that they had received far less than 
their preliminary calculations would have indicated.  Some 
companies, many of whom documented substantial past performance in 
the qualifying period, did not even appear on the list or were 
missing quota allocations in key categories.  Companies have once 
again begun making the pilgrimage to the Ministry of Trade in 
Hanoi to plead their cases.  Many of these firms say they have 
been assured by MOT officials that their quotas will be adjusted 
or that, because \"the list is not finished,\" their firms will be 
added to the list.  Once again, textile firms are on pins and 
needles (sorry) as they try to sort out exactly what is going on 
and how to get a piece of the action. 
 
Apparently Transparent -- at First 
---------------------------------------- 
3.  (U) In the past few months, GVN officials have stressed 
repeatedly the goal of making the quota allocation process as fair 
and as transparent as possible.  Various ministries accepted input 
from buyers and producers as they developed the quota allocation 
system.  The Ministries of Trade, Industry, and Planning and 
Investment jointly issued a circular, which formally laid out the 
criteria for allocation (ref A).  MOT posted this decree along 
with other relevant regulations on the MOT website.  Export 
figures by category were also posted and updated every few days so 
that companies could see how much quota remained in each category. 
 
4.  (SBU) All of this transparency quickly became obscured, 
however, when the first quota allocations were announced on June 
11.  This was several days after the \"end of May\" deadline 
specified in the aforementioned circular.  Many companies who had 
complied with documentation requirements for quota allocation did 
not receive any quota at all.  Some companies received 
substantially less than the amounts they had anticipated.  In one 
case, for example, an American firm received 93 percent of what it 
expected in one category, but only about 40 percent in another. 
The general manager of one Hong Kong firm complained to ConGen 
Econoff that he had not slept for days because his firm was not 
even on the list.  His firm later appeared on the updated list, 
but received far less quota than anticipated and no quota at all 
in several key categories.  The export figures by category have 
not been updated since June 6 on the MOT website, adding to 
business anxiety in HCMC. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Producers and buyers are reluctant to ascribe any of 
this confusion to an attempt by GVN officials to unfairly allocate 
quota to preferred firms.  Producers note that no group in 
particular appears to have benefited from this initial allocation, 
although unless one knows the past performance of each individual 
company, one cannot be absolutely certain.  GVN officials have 
told Embassy Hanoi officers that they have been overwhelmed by 
this entire exercise and at the same time are trying to comply 
with requests to provide detailed export data to U.S. Customs (ref 
B). 
 
We feel your pain... 
------------------------ 
6.  (U) Interest in the U.S. textile and garment market is 
enormous in Ho Chi Minh City, which is the center of the country\'s 
textile and apparel industry.  With less than one week\'s notice, 
an American Chamber of Commerce seminar on U.S. Customs 
documentation requirements for textile imports drew more than 250 
participants.  At the meeting, the Secretary General of VITAS Mr. 
Tran Duc Thinh acknowledged the frustrations of the entire 
industry as the quota allocation process had begun.  He urged 
companies to register their complaints and promised that VITAS 
would call a meeting in a few days to review the situation with 
its members.  He stated that the MOT was working hard to get 
things right, but this was the first time MOT had to allocate 
textile quota for the U.S. market. (Note: For several years the 
GVN has been allocating a much smaller textile quota for the EU 
market.) 
 
You bet you will! 
--------------------- 
7.  (SBU) According to one major American buyer in Ho Chi Minh 
City, however, the ground may be shifting.  On June 16, this 
buyer, along with representatives of several foreign business 
groups in Ho Chi Minh City, met with Mr. Le Quoc An, the Chairman 
of Vinatex and of VITAS, and Mr. Le Van Dao, the incoming 
Secretary General of VITAS and former Deputy Director of the MOT 
 
SIPDIS 
Import-Export Department.  Foreign business groups have been 
lobbying the GVN collectively on textile and quota allocation 
issues. These businesses produce or purchase hundreds of millions 
of dollars of garments here every year.  According to the American 
buyer, An and Dao told her that the MOT had been using a 
\"different formula\", not one based closely on the criteria in the 
GVN circular outlining the process.   According to An and Dao, 
using the current \"formula\" resulted in smaller quotas, by about 
10% - 30%.  This allowed the MOT to withhold more quota for later 
allocation. 
 
8.  (SBU) These foreign business representatives were highly 
critical of this reported approach and informed An and Dao that 
they were meeting separately later this week with U.S. Ambassador 
Burghardt and with the Minister of Trade.  They wanted to give 
them a good report, they said, but as the situation stood now, 
this would not be possible.  According to the leader of this 
textile group, An and Dao reacted by telephoning the new Deputy 
Director of Import-Export at MOT (the key person in charge of 
handling quota allocation for the U.S. market.)  According to the 
business reps, An and Dao urged him in the strongest terms (\"fix 
this or your job in jeopardy\") to release new quota figures based 
on the \"correct formula.\"   According to ConGen contact, An and 
Dao told the foreign reps that yet another \"revised\" quota 
allocation list should be released in a couple of days, this time 
using the criteria \"as set out\" in the GVN circular. 
 
Comment 
------------ 
9.  (SBU)   ConGen contact has been a good source of inside 
information in the past.  However, neither An or Dao directly work 
or speak for MOT, and every source in this cable has a horse in 
this race.   Embassy contacted MOT officials who were in charge of 
drafting the circular, creating and applying the criteria, and 
allocating quota.  They stated they were unaware of any 
conversation as reported by the American industry rep, and noted 
that there is no specific formula advocated in the circular. 
Rather, these officials said they set up a formula based on their 
own criteria and, as previously reported, scheduled the allocation 
in two phases.  The first phase was smaller than originally 
announced and this has led to problems and unease among industry 
reps. The second phase, which will now be larger than planned, 
will happen later this month.  Depending which side of the fence 
one sits on, this may also be the \"revised\" allocation that 
industry reps are waiting for. 
 
10. (SBU)  That said, there is clearly unhappiness among the 
foreign business community regarding the allocation of quota.  For 
them, these recent quota allocations appear to concentrate power 
for quota decisions in just a few hands.  Without any MOT 
explanatory formula or calculations for allocating past 
performance quota, the foreign business community has serious 
concerns about the apparent disconnect between their expected 
quota allocations (based on their own calculations) and what in 
fact MOT has allocated to them.  If MOT can improve its 
performance by responding to industry\'s concerns - ensuring that 
the second phase more closely follows industry\'s recommendations 
regarding the application of criteria and \"formula\" - it would be 
excellent news for Vietnam.  Garment and textile producers would 
get the performance-based quota they were promised, thus 
strengthening the competitiveness of the industry here.  And, it 
would be another step on the road to transparency.  Because the 
GVN had issued a circular outlining quota criteria, buyers and 
producers were able to lobby the MOT directly for its proper 
implementation.  Of course, whether or not MOT will tweak its 
method of allocation in Phase II, as well as increase 
transparency, remains to be seen.

SUBJECT: NEWEST HCMC VICE CHAIRMAN: BAD HABITS TO BLAME FOR 
TRAFFIC, SEWAGE, LAND USE PROBLEMS 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU)  HCMC People\'s Committee\'s newest Vice Chairman, Nguyen 
Van Dua, discussed urban planning and quality of life issues with 
Consul General in an initial courtesy call on June 11.  Vice 
Chairman Dua focused on HCMC\'s serious waste management, land use 
and trafffic issues, and its efforts to attract investment for 
municipal projects.  He also discussed ideas for vocational 
training and policies regarding construction and urban 
development. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
NO ONE WANTS TO TOUCH IT: SEWAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
2.  (SBU)  The Consul General paid a courtesy call on Mr. Nguyen 
Van Dua, the newest of the HCMC People\'s Committee\'s five vice- 
chairmen, on June 11.  The 45-minute discussion focused on urban 
planning and quality of life in HCMC, as well as waste management, 
vocational training, and investment efforts.  According to the Mr. 
Dua (hard D), the municipal authorities are deeply concerned about 
current inadequate methods for dealing with the large amounts of 
waste produced daily.  Waste management problems are exacerbated 
by leaks in antiquated water and sewage pipes.  While local and 
Dutch scientists were working to address the waste issue, they had 
yet to find solutions.  HCMC needed a more comprehensive approach, 
to include use of new technologies for landfill, composting, and 
waste-to-energy conversion. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Asked why he thought foreign investors had yet to 
express real interest in waste management projects, Vice Chairman 
Dua blamed delays in land planning for disposal sites and poor 
management practices.  In the past, civil servants had focused on 
questionable sites, failing to take into consideration the impact 
of drive time, environmental hazards, and other factors.  The HCMC 
government was making adjustments, but the impact had yet to be 
felt.  While one investor group had developed a plan to process 
waste into energy, the costs were too high.  HCMC still needs 
modern waste disposal technology -- but at an affordable cost. 
 
4.  (SBU)  According to Mr. Dua, HCMC is studying new ideas for 
managing waste, including the use of city waterways, rather than 
roads, for transportation.  At the same time, the government is 
working to raise awareness and encourage sorting and 
classification of trash at the household level. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
BETTER MANAGEMENT THROUGH VOCATIONAL TRAINING 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua noted the importance of improved and 
expanded vocational training to raise the quality of the 
workforce.  Only 30 percent of the labor pool has professional 
skills at present, but HCMC hopes to raise that figure to 40 
percent in the near future.  The Vice Chairman expressed interest 
in working with San Francisco, within the framework of the Sister 
City relationship, to meet training needs.  In particular, he 
emphasized the importance of training line supervisors to organize 
and manage their workers. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Asked to choose between joint-venture, general use 
vocational schools throughout the city, or more specialized 
vocational schools to supply existing industrial parks, Vice 
Chairman Dua saw value in both -- one for improving the labor pool 
at large, the other for meeting specific labor needs.  He looked 
forward to discussing appropriate sectors with any interested 
investor with sufficient capital.  He also cited HCMC\'s need for a 
detailed analysis of labor supply and demand. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
HCMC\'S FAMOUS TRAFFIC CHAOS ON THE DECLINE? 
------------------------------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU)  Despite signs of improvement in dealing with HCMC\'s 
\"famous\" traffic problem, Vice Chairman Dua was not satisfied that 
sufficient progress had been made.  Traffic deaths and injuries 
are reportedly down 30 percent compared to last year, but the city 
government wants to reduce accidents to the lowest level possible. 
The Vice Chairman stressed that easing traffic flow and making 
travel within the city safer and more convenient was essential to 
improving quality of life for visitors and residents alike. 
Public transport is a top priority, and the city is looking at 
ways to convince people to take advantage of existing options. 
Buses are currently the primary means of transport, but city 
planners are examining other options.  Vice Chairman Dua asked the 
CG to encourage American companies to participate in 
transportation projects and expressed his eagerness to accept 
recommendations for technical assistance and investment from the 
U.S. 
 
------------------------- 
URBAN PLANNING NIGHTMARES 
------------------------- 
 
8.  (SBU)  Turning to other large infrastructure and construction 
projects, Vice Chairman Dua noted his disappointment with the 
Saigon South development, citing the modest number of projects 
underway in the relatively large (2600 hectare) area.  He had high 
praise, however, for the Thu Thiem New Urban Area Project (which 
he managed just prior to his promotion in February of this year). 
HCMC is soliciting anonymous design proposals and bringing in a 
jury of international architects to help select the optimal 
design.  (Note: Results for the Thu Thiem development project 
should be announced o/a July 10, 2003.)  Mr. Dua said he expected 
bidding packages to go out in October, and encouraged American 
participation at every stage.  Construction on a new East-West 
highway is expected to begin in November, and general upgrades are 
planned for the downtown business district. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Calling the Vietnamese mindset a \"disaster\" for urban 
planning, the Vice Chairman blamed many of the city\'s housing 
problems on the poor quality of existing residential options. 
Given the choice, most people preferred to live in their own 
houses rather than apartments, leading to a constant effort to out- 
build one another.  From Mr. Dua\'s point of view, the new 
construction is not only of dubious quality, but the architectural 
designs are \"ugly.\"  While better apartment quality would 
certainly help, any real improvement would require a fundamental 
change in attitude.  There is district-level authority to approve 
most residential construction, but illegal buying and selling of 
land is difficult to control, as is building without a permit. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua stressed the need to change the 
mindset and behavior of HCMC\'s population in order to deal more 
responsibly with both urban planning and waste management issues. 
He said 2003 had been declared the \"Year of Restoring Order in 
Public Life,\" during which time efforts would be made to change 
attitudes on littering, driving, construction, and other urban 
issues.  He remarked that the SEAGAMES (Southeast Asia 
Games)competition to be hosted by Vietnam in December 2003 might 
provide an opportunity for the HCMC government to launch public 
sanitation and anti-litter campaigns. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Asked to estimate the actual population of HCMC (some 
official publications still list the figure as 6 million), Vice 
Chairman Dua pointed to the large number of temporary residents 
and the huge migratory influx of job-seekers from the provinces as 
complicating an accurate count.  Describing the need to better 
manage the division of labor between HCMC and neighboring 
provinces, he hoped HCMC could move toward attracting a more 
highly skilled, white-collar workforce to stabilize the 
population.  When pressed, he did not contradict a population 
estimate of \"more than 8 million.\" 
 
12.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua asked the CG for her \"frank 
observations\" on the current state of the relationship between 
city government and the population it served.  Noting that ConGen 
staff were generally quite pleased to call HCMC home, she cited 
police responsiveness as one specific area for improvement. 
 
---------------------------- 
STRENGTHENING THE SISTERHOOD 
---------------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua asked the CG to recommend specific 
areas for cooperation with HCMC\'s Sister City in the U.S.  Noting 
San Francisco\'s  reputation as being progressive and open-minded, 
she recommended pursuing cultural and educational exchanges, mass 
transit projects, fire prevention and safety training, vocational 
training, and environmental improvement programs.  She also 
mentioned that Chief Mario Trevino of the San Francisco Fire 
Department hoped to visit Hanoi and HCMC in August to participate 
in a jointly-organized Fire Prevention and Safety Conference. 
 
-------------------- 
LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD 
-------------------- 
 
14.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Dua assumed his new position as one of 
HCMC\'s five Vice Chairmen in February 2003.  His portfolio 
includes transportation, public works, land administration, 
construction, and urban management.  He served previously on the 
Project Management Board for the Thu Thiem New Urban Area for one 
year, and as Secretary of the HCMC District 3 Party Committee for 
five years before that.  He was Secretary of the HCMC Youth Union, 
a traditional stepping-stone to prominence in city and national 
politics, during 1992-1996.  Vice Chairman Dua holds an advanced 
degree in politics, and bachelor\'s degrees in economics and law. 
He understands/speaks some English. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
15.  (SBU)  ConGen first requested this initial courtesy call more 
than two months ago, after Vice Chairman Dua indicated his 
interest in meeting after a serendipitous encounter with the CG at 
a representational event.  However, when we requested an 
appointment, we were told that the new Vice Chairman was \"not 
ready\", as he was still getting acquainted with his portfolio. 
Having now seen Mr. Dua in action, it is clear he is comfortable 
with his new responsibilities and willing to speak openly with USG 
officials.  Our External Relations Office contacts say he has 
already earned a reputation as a hard worker (in the office by 
7:00 a.m., does not leave until after 9:00 p.m.), and is more 
\"openly emotional.\" 
 
16.  (SBU) Vice hairman Dua was confident and engaged throughout 
the meeting, asking as many questions as he answered.  His 
requests for feedback and criticism from the CG were bold and 
unusual in a first meeting in the Vietnamese context.  This may 
indicate that the powers-that-be continue to recognize the 
importance of assigning outward-looking non-ideologues to 
administer Vietnam\'s dynamic economic engine.  That said, HCMC 
covers a huge metropolitan area, with many of the same pluses and 
minuses of developing world cities anywhere.  Given budget 
realities and varying levels of central government control, it 
would be unrealistic to expect that even the most enlightened city 
officials could solve such massive infrastructure and public 
service problems anytime soon.

1.  Summary.  A spurt of promotions will see the Party Secretaries 
from both Danang City and Lam Dong Province move to high-ranking 
positions in the Communist Party in Hanoi.  The Danang City Deputy 
Party Secretary will then become the Party Secretary there, while 
a Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development from Hanoi 
will become Party Secretary for Lam Dong Province.  End Summary. 
 
----------- 
DANANG CITY 
----------- 
 
2.  In the Party Congress in Danang City on June 23, 2003, Mr. 
Nguyen Ba Thanh, Deputy Party Secretary and Chairman of Danang 
City People\'s Committee, was unanimously elected to be Party 
Secretary of the Danang Party Committee.  He will continue to hold 
 
SIPDIS 
his current position until the next meeting of the Danang City 
People\'s Council, probably at the end of July.  At that meeting he 
will present his resignation as head of the People\'s Committee and 
the Council will vote on his successor.  Mr. Thanh moves up to 
succeed Mr. Nguyen Duc Hat, who will go to Hanoi to take the post 
of Deputy Head of the Central Commission on Organizational Affairs 
for the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV).  Both appointments have 
been arranged by the CPV but will not be final until confirmed by 
the Politburo, which will issue a formal decision. 
 
----------------- 
LAM DONG PROVINCE 
----------------- 
 
3.  The CPV also announced in \"Saigon Giai Phong\" newspaper on 
June 25, that Mr. Nguyen Van Dang, the First Deputy Minister of 
Agriculture and Rural Development and a member of the Executive 
Party Committee in Hanoi, will assume the position of the Party 
Secretary of Lam Dong Province.  Mr. Dang will replace Mr. Nguyen 
 
SIPDIS 
Hoai Bao, who is leaving his positions as Party Secretary of Lam 
Dong Province and Chairman of the Lam Dong Province People\'s 
Council to go to Hanoi and take the post of Deputy Head of the 
Central Commission on Mass Mobilization in charge of the South. 
The Politburo has not yet issued formal decisions on these 
appointments either, but they are considered pro forma. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
4.  The CPV regularly rotates its high-level officials among the 
different regions of Vietnam, and the promotion of Mr. Hat and Mr. 
Bao to high-level CPV positions speaks well of their performance 
in Danang and Lam Dong.  Danang City ranks fourth after Ho Chi 
Minh City, Hanoi and Hai Phong for per capita income in Vietnam. 
It is the commercial hub for the provinces in the middle region of 
Vietnam, and has been modernizing and growing rapidly over the 
past three years.  Mr. Thanh\'s promotion to Party Secretary sends 
a positive message for growth in the city.  In his current deputy 
role, he has worked with the people of Danang to successfully 
carry out controversial the land reclamation and resettlement 
projects that were the necessary precursors to modernizing the 
city\'s infrastructure.  When the central government balked at the 
idea of funding a new bridge in Danang, he raised most of the 
funds by mobilizing local resources -- and the GVN later offered 
to fund the rest.  Mr. Thanh has organized press conferences to 
discuss problems in the city.  In response to public concerns, he 
set up a civil security corps to regulate traffic flows and crack 
down on street crime. 
 
5.  The southernmost of the \"Central Highland\" provinces, Lam Dong 
is famous for its agriculture, but has suffered from the drop in 
coffee and other commodity prices.  The appointment of Mr. Dang to 
the position of Party Secretary -- with his experience as the 
First Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development -- may 
mean the CPV wants to focus on those areas.  As Provincial Party 
Secretary, Mr. Dang will have to balance the picturesque tourist 
 
SIPDIS 
center of Dalat against the periphery of Lam Dong\'s rural poor, in 
order to bring greater development to the province as a whole.  He 
will also have to address the same volatile mix of ethnic 
minorities, land disputes and outlawed religious groups that exist 
in the three neighboring Central Highlands provinces of Dak Lak, 
Gia Lai, and Kon Tum.  Lam Dong Province also gets more than its 
share of attention when it comes to tourism development, because 
its capital city, Dalat, is a very popular destination for both 
Vietnamese and foreigners.  However, Lam Dong provincial 
authorities do not enjoy a good reputation when it comes to 
creating a hospitable climate for foreign investment.  A 
Singaporean firm recently pulled out of a joint venture, and an 
American corporate businessman has also experienced problems 
there.

SUBJECT: THICH QUANG DO -- HOW FREE AT LAST? 
 
REF: A) HCMC 0475    B) HCMC 0412 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  During a June 30 meeting with Consul 
General, recently \"released\" United Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam (UBCV) deputy Thich Quang Do launched into a two- 
hour plus discourse on religion, democracy, freedom, and 
capitalism.  Confirming press reports, he said he would soon 
attempt to test the limits of his \"unconditional release\" 
with a visit to UBCV patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in Quy Nhon 
on July 10.  Until then, Thich Quang Do said he would 
continue to receive visitors and monitor his health at the 
same pagoda where he has been detained incommunicado for the 
past two years under \"administrative surveillance.\"  He 
asked ConGenOffs to convey his appreciation for the support 
of the USG, U.S. Congress, the EU, and various international 
human rights organizations over the years and encouraged 
continued outside pressure to bring about democratic change 
in Vietnam.  He predicted the GVN would one day lose control 
over a population that had grown accustomed to the benefits 
of economic reforms.  Citing upcoming medical appointments, 
he expressed regret that he would be unable to attend 
ConGen\'s July 4 reception.  Despite his chronic medical 
problems, Thich Quang Do appeared hale, hearty, and in full 
possession of his faculties.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Consul General and Poloff called on 75-year old 
Thich Quang Do on June 30, at the neat and well kept Thanh 
Minh Zen pagoda in HCMC.  The second highest ranking monk in 
the hierarchy of the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam (UBCV), Thich Quang Do had been isolated and 
detained at the pagoda under \"administrative surveillance\" 
for nearly two years after his June 2001 attempt to \"rescue\" 
UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang from conditions resembling 
house arrest at a remote pagoda in Quang Ngai province and 
bring him to HCMC.  The two years of administrative 
surveillance were originally part of a sentence imposed in 
1995 on charges related to organizing unauthorized 
assistance for flood victims in the Mekong Delta.  The 
administrative surveillance portion of the 1995 sentence, 
reinstated in 2001 despite his inclusion in a 1998 general 
amnesty, was lifted ahead of schedule and without advance 
notice on June 26. 
 
3.  (SBU)  During the private meeting with ConGenOffs, Thich 
Quang Do was lucid and feisty for a man of his age.  He was 
in excellent spirits, considering his recent detention 
(something he attributed to Buddhist control of mind over 
body).  He was extremely animated, although not always 
responsive to the questions asked, and made frequent use of 
proverbs and Buddhist metaphor.  Describing himself as 
\"having ears like a rabbit,\" Thich Quang Do said he needed 
to remain alert to stay one step ahead of the GVN.  He said 
he was surprised when the detention order was lifted ahead 
of schedule, but noted he never understood the government\'s 
reasoning as to why he was supposed to be released from his 
two-year detention in September, rather than June, in the 
first place (ref A).  He compared the GVN\'s actions in 
reinstating the administrative surveillance to those of a 
debt collector who continues to collect long after the debt 
has been paid.  He claimed to have no idea why he was 
released ahead of schedule, but felt it must surely be part 
of some GVN \"scheme.\" 
 
4.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do also dismissed outright the 
grounds for his original imprisonment in 1995, for \"damaging 
national solidarity\" by organizing relief to flood victims 
outside the GVN-approved Fatherland Front sponsorship via a 
Communist Party mass organization (such as the Women\'s 
Union, or Youth Union).  Noting that various Buddhist groups 
had been encouraged to carry out such charitable activities 
by the former southern regime prior to 1975, he accused the 
Fatherland Front (the umbrella group for mass organizations) 
of having divided people and prolonged the suffering of the 
masses. 
 
5.  (SBU)  According to Thich Quang Do, the authorities who 
appeared unannounced at the pagoda on June 26 to deliver the 
oral release order were minor district-level officials.  He 
said the GVN was always careful to let local officials 
pretend to take the leading role, in order to protect the 
real decision makers at the central level.  In his view, the 
GVN had sent low-ranking functionaries because they were 
afraid to face responsibility for his unjust imprisonment 
and answer his questions directly.  Because he still noticed 
policemen watching the pagoda, Thich Quang Do was not sure 
what the release order meant. 
 
6.  (SBU)  For now, Thich Quang Do plans to reside at his 
former \"prison pagoda.\"  He bases his claim to administer 
the pagoda on the sequence of events following the communist 
takeover of the South.  In 1978, after his release from a 
two-year stay in prison for opposing the communist regime, 
the communist authorities had appointed him to run Thanh 
Minh Zen Pagoda in HCMC.  Because his 1982 transfer from 
HCMC to the North for his opposition to the formation of the 
Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS) was accomplished without any 
formal, written order, Thich Quang Do considers the original 
Thanh Minh Zen assignment still valid.  So he therefore 
refuses to file any application for residency, even though 
local officials have already asked him to do so.  (\"Why 
should I ask for something back that I never lost to begin 
with?\")  The officials with whom he spoke on June 26 said 
they had no authority to decide this matter, but promised to 
convey his points to those who could.  Thich Quang Do also 
plans to apply for a telephone, though he is not optimistic 
about his chances for success.  He noted that during his 
detention, he could not use the single telephone at the 
monastery for fear the police would cut the line and 
inconvenience the Abbot. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Despite his \"release,\" Thich Quang Do is certain 
he will still be \"guarded\" by security agents at the pagoda 
and followed whenever he ventured outside.  He believes the 
Vietnamese authorities had not interfered with ConGenOffs 
\"out of respect\" for the ConGen, but would be more 
restrictive with lay believers and other visitors.  Despite 
the continued security presence, some believers had visited 
him over the past few days, including a group of overseas 
Vietnamese (Viet Khieu) living in Australia.  Several 
visitors had been followed home by police and questioned. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do plans to continue receiving 
visitors until July 10, when he hopes to travel to Quy Nhon 
(without GVN \"assistance\") to confer with UBCV Patriarch 
Thich Huyen Quang on \"Buddhist matters.\"  He noted that 
unlike his religious superior, he now had a written order 
releasing him from detention.  Absent such an order -- 
something the GVN could never issue because it had never 
issued an order to detain him in the first place, and thus 
would then have to admit he had been detained for 21 years 
without legal documentation -- Thich Huyen Quang\'s current 
situation was different.  The GVN could move him around from 
pagoda to pagoda, something Thich Quang Do described as 
\"mobile detention.\" 
 
9.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do said he was suffering from several 
chronic health conditions, including diabetes, high blood 
pressure, and unspecified kidney, heart and eye ailments. 
He was currently on several medications and was scheduled 
for three separate examinations on July 4 -- appointments 
that would unfortunately prevent him from attending ConGen\'s 
Independence Day reception.  According to Thich Quang Do, he 
was able to visit the doctor on a monthly basis during his 
detention by informing local authorities and waiting 
approximately one week for permission, but he refused to 
comply with demands to submit a written request for each 
visit.  He regularly told his \"captors\" that it would be 
their fault if he died.  A handful of plainclothes security 
officers usually accompanied him to his appointments, 
waiting just outside the doctor\'s office and retrieving 
copies of his medical records for their own files. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Other than his forays out for medical treatment, 
Thich Quang Do said local authorities had basically turned 
his room at the pagoda \"into a prison\" for the past two 
years.  He was completely isolated from the outside world 
and unaware of the many visitors who had attempted to meet 
with him.  He praised Thanh Minh Zen\'s  Abbot, however, for 
standing up to the authorities and denying them permission 
to place guards outside his actual room in the pagoda. The 
authorities had been forced to back down when the Abbot told 
them the pagoda was not under detention, and if they wanted 
a guard inside, they had better transfer Thich Quang Do to a 
prison.  The security forces then resigned themselves to 
sitting in the outer courtyard of the compound.  Thich Quang 
Do believes that undercover operatives continue to monitor 
the comings and goings of believers, and claimed to have 
noticed a decline in the number of worshippers at the 
pagoda. 
 
11.  (SBU)  Several times during the conversation, Thich 
Quang Do reiterated his Buddhist obligation to \"be honest 
and speak the truth.\"  Disavowing any prejudice against the 
current government (even though he said four family members 
had been \"killed by the communists\"), he claimed to express 
the feelings of ordinary Vietnamese, who confided in monks 
and priests, but were otherwise afraid to speak out. 
Offering his views on the current government, he observed 
that all power still resides with the Communist Party of 
Vietnam (CPV) at the central level.  Any pretense of 
authority outside Hanoi was intended only to insulate the 
GVN and give it plausible deniability.  While they had no 
real authority, corrupt local officials abused their power 
for economic gain, and citizens were powerless to complain. 
If the CPV truly intended to fight official corruption, 
there would be nobody left to fill the government ranks. 
 
12.  (SBU)  Drawing on discussions with Thich Huyen Quang 
after the patriarch\'s meetings in Hanoi (ref B), Thich Quang 
Do noted that Prime Minister Phan Van Khai had accused local 
officials of \"mistakenly\" reinstating his original 1995 
detention order.  This was just another example of Hanoi\'s 
\"good cop/bad cop\" routine -- let the local authorities take 
the rap for implementing a central GVN decision, but then 
have the central GVN come in after the fact and \"correct\" 
the local authorities\' mistakes. 
 
13.  (SBU)  Echoing what we have heard from other ranking 
UBCV monks, Thich Quang Do claimed that all Vietnam Buddhist 
Sangha (VBS) monks were merely UBCV monks who had succumbed 
to GVN pressure.  He dated CPV attempts to discredit the 
UBCV back to the formation of the first \"Patriotic Buddhist 
Association\" in 1975. (\"The title itself means there must be 
traitors somewhere.\")  Under the circumstances, he found it 
ironic that he and his colleagues in the UBCV were accused 
of destroying national solidarity, noting that even in 1975, 
\"CPV strategy had been to divide and conquer.\"  Labeling all 
of Vietnam\'s rulers since the time of Emperor Bao Dai as 
dictators, Thich Quang Do described the CPV as the most 
sophisticated in the way it has sown fear and distrust among 
families and communities, and thus effected control.  In 
that same manner, the CPV had tried to use Buddhist monks to 
destroy Buddhism, but Buddhism could not be separated from 
the Vietnamese nation and people.  Although Thich Quang Do 
criticized the new generation of monks as \"working for the 
government,\" he predicted that Vietnam\'s Buddhists would 
soon overcome their \"spiritual restrictions,\" and that 
Buddhism would flourish again through the support of its 
believers, including those from overseas. 
 
14.  (SBU)  Toward the end of the meeting, Thich Quang Do 
offered his personal goals for the future.  An oft-repeated 
theme throughout the two-and-a-half hour conversation was 
that freedom and democracy were the most important elements 
for national development.  Freedom was what made the U.S. a 
superpower.  Along with promoting freedom and democracy, 
Thich Quang Do said he wished to re-establish \"normal 
activities\" for the UBCV.  He also expressed concern that 
Vietnamese students had been sent to Russia and China to 
study science and technical subjects, but the humanities and 
philosophy were ignored.  While he termed the establishment 
of a multiparty system \"a must\", he said \"nobody dares to 
raise this subject.\" 
 
15.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do was aware of the recent arrest or 
Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, and the trials of Pham Hong Son and Tran 
Khue.  He said they showed the GVN\'s continuing fear of 
independent thought.  He pointed out the contradiction 
between the relatively light sentences accorded GVN and CPV 
officials implicated on corruption charges in the recent Nam 
Cam case, and the much stiffer sentence imposed on Pham Hong 
Son for receiving US$150 for translating a document on the 
Internet.  Without democracy, there was no chance for 
improved human rights in Vietnam.  A free press was the best 
way to keep citizens informed of deficiencies in their 
government, and draw attention to the large gap between the 
written laws of Vietnam and the reality of their 
enforcement. 
 
16.  (SBU)  More generally, now that the Vietnamese people 
had tasted relative prosperity and reform, things could not 
go back to the way they were before.  According to Thich 
Quang Do, \"Once a person knows how it feels to ride a 
motorcycle, they will not go back to a bicycle.\"  While the 
GVN would prefer to open up the system only to the level at 
which it could still maintain power, someday it would lose 
control.  Thich Quang Do believes that many top leaders have 
already lost faith in Marxism-Leninism themselves, and that 
nearly everyone was now a capitalist at heart.  This would 
be the driving force for the eventual collapse of the CPV 
and GVN.  But if Vietnam were a democracy now, it would not 
be communist ruled. 
 
17.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do ended the meeting by asking the 
Consul General to again convey thanks to his many supporters 
in the U.S. Congress (including Representative Loretta 
Sanchez, whom he met twice), EU nations, and international 
human rights organizations (especially Human Rights Watch). 
While he specifically said he was not calling for direct 
intervention from outside, he asked that international aid 
donors and foreign investors \"develop human rights and 
freedom too, not just the economy.\"  He urged that 
development aid be somehow linked to progress in human 
rights.  To simply pour money into various aid projects 
would only give the GVN greater financial means for control 
and further enrich corrupt officials. 
 
18.  (SBU)  Comment:  Thich Quang Do seems to have emerged 
from his two years of isolation as outspoken and feisty as 
ever.  Ready to challenge the GVN at every turn and unlikely 
to back down, he presents an interesting counterweight to 
Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang\'s more measured, modest 
approach.  Thich Quang Do\'s health remains a concern, 
however, and may mean that for all of his big picture 
criticism of the GVN and discussion of democracy, he may 
have to limit himself to a more immediate concern: finding 
some way to legalize the UBCV\'s status.  Whether the UBCV 
leadership is able to take advantage of this small window of 
opportunity to revitalize their church will depend a great 
deal on how provocative the GVN finds their actions in the 
coming weeks and months.  Thich Huyen Quang has maintained a 
low profile in Quy Nhon, but Thich Quang Do has generally 
been more of a firebrand.  Notably, Thich Quang Do skirted 
around any questions about reconciliation or merging with 
the VBS.  It is clear that the UBCV leadership believes it 
has benefited greatly from international pressure and hopes 
to continue to receive more targeted, focused support in the 
future.  The question is, will it use this pressure and 
support to push too far too quickly, or will it proceed step- 
by-step?

1.  (SBU)  Summary.  During a recent trip to the Mekong 
Delta region, DCM met with the Vice-Rector of Can Tho 
University and the Rector of An Giang University.  Both 
expressed disappointment at the slow start to the Vietnam 
Education Foundation (VEF) scholarship program and expressed 
hope that its web site would be updated soon.  They noted 
that more and more students were expressing interest in 
studying English and IT, and indicated they would like to 
see more students studying agricultural development.  They 
also said they would welcome volunteers with professional 
experience from the U.S. to help modernize teaching methods 
and curriculum, and improve English skills.  Mission 
believes this may be a good opening for bringing Peace Corps 
to Vietnam.  End summary. 
 
Can Tho University 
------------------ 
 
2.  (U) During a recent visit, DCM, Embassy Poloff, ConGen 
EconOff, and ConGen Pol/Econ assistant met with Dr. Nguyen 
Anh Tuan, Vice Rector in Charge of International Relations, 
and Dr. Ha Thanh Toan, Director of the Biotechnology 
Research and Development Institute at Can Tho University 
(CTU).  Dr. Tuan, who completed graduate studies at Auburn 
University (Alabama), described CTU as a public university. 
The administration is elected by the faculty and then 
formally appointed by the Ministry of Education and Training 
(MOET), in consultation with the People\'s Committee of Can 
Tho Province.  The curriculum is set by the professors and 
approved by MOET.  Tuition to attend CTU is $100 a year, and 
the VND 100 billion annual budget (approximately USD 6.5 
million) is funded by a combination of tuition, central 
government funding, international aid, and research 
sponsorships.  Approximately five percent of the students 
are eligible to receive merit-based scholarships.  Students 
in CTU\'s Education College -- like all students who study 
the profession of teaching in Vietnam -- do not pay tuition, 
provided they work as teachers after graduation. 
 
3.  (U)  According to Dr. Tuan, CTU has roughly 34,000 
students enrolled at its main campus and satellite colleges 
throughout the Mekong Delta, making it one of the five 
largest universities in Vietnam.  Its staff numbers about 
1600, of whom six are currently studying in the U.S.  About 
22 percent of Vietnam\'s population lives in the Delta 
provinces.  Until An Giang University (AGU) was established 
in December 1999, CTU was the only university in the Mekong 
Delta region.  While 17,000 students attend classes at the 
main CTU campus, only 6000 students live there.  CTU has 
some private, commercially-funded research programs as well 
as regular course study.  Competition for fellowships to 
conduct graduate and undergraduate research is fierce: CTU 
admitted only 4400 (six percent) of 74,000 applicants to do 
research in 2003. 
 
4.  (U)  Dr. Tuan inquired about the progress of the VEF, as 
its website had not posted any new information recently. 
DCM informed him that the VEF recently selected 22 
Vietnamese students already enrolled in advanced degree 
programs in the U.S., mostly in hard sciences and 
information technology (IT), for the first round of 
scholarships.  Dr. Tuan and Dr. Toan (who completed his PhD 
in food science at the University of Illinois at Champaign- 
Urbana) agreed that CTU should put forward agriculture 
students as candidates for VEF scholarships in the future. 
Both academics noted that it was unfortunate that more 
bright students were not studying agriculture, as Vietnam is 
an agricultural economy and needs good leaders, in order to 
become more productive and efficient in that sector.  They 
described the Faculty of Agriculture as the strongest school 
at CTU. 
 
5.  (U)  Dr. Tuan added that increasing numbers of students 
had changed their major field of study to English.  Many of 
them were now shifting to IT.  He noted that there are 
currently volunteers at CTU from Australia, Canada, Japan 
and the U.K. teaching courses ranging from IT to medicine to 
English.  He said the highest priority of employers in 
Vietnam today is to hire graduates who can speak English. 
Technical skills and high marks are a distant second and 
third. 
 
6.  (U)  Regarding special treatment for ethnic minority 
students, Dr. Tuan said that while each Mekong Delta 
province has built a dormitory at CTU for its students, the 
GVN built one to house minorities, mostly Khmer and Cham. 
The GVN dormitory holds 400 beds, and occupancy has 
generally run at 70-80 percent, with a small number of 
minority students living off-campus.  Ethnic minority 
students also take part in the numerous student groups on 
campus. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Dr. Tuan also discussed the status of a number of 
universities which have recently opened or will be opening 
in the Delta, and their varying degrees of freedom to 
determine their own curriculum and sources of funding.  They 
are: 
 
-- An Giang University. (see para. 8) Opened end of 1999. 
 
-- University of Medicine and Dentistry in Can Tho.  Opened 
in April 2003, funded by the Ministry of Health (MOH), 
curriculum approved by both MOH and MOET.  Founded upon the 
School of Medicine that was formerly part of CTU. 
 
-- University of Education and Pedagogy in Dong Thap. 
Opened April 2003, centrally funded.  Established to train 
teachers, curriculum must be approved by MOET. 
 
-- Fisheries University of Kien Giang.  Unsure when it will 
open, but will be central government funded.  May have been 
created for political reasons, since Mr. Nguyen Tan Dung, 
the First Deputy Prime Minister, is from Kien Giang.  The 
GVN has requested that the satellite branch of Nha Trang 
University of Fisheries located in Saigon move to Rach Gia 
to support the creation of this new university. 
 
-- Mekong University in Vinh Long.  Opened in 2000, private, 
curriculum established by professors but must be approved by 
MOET.  Some retired government officials own shares in this 
university. 
 
An Giang University 
------------------- 
 
8.  (U)  DCM and party met separately with the Harvard- 
educated Dr. Vo Tong Xuan, Rector of AGU.  AGU was formally 
opened by decree in December 1999, and receives funding from 
the GVN and An Giang province.  MOET approves the 
curriculum.  Dr. Xuan took over as Rector of the University 
in February 2000, and during these first few years he said 
his top priority has been trying to attract and retain new 
faculty.  His second priority has been to upgrade the skills 
of the existing faculty. 
 
9.  (U)  Regarding recruitment, Dr. Xuan said he has been 
seeking out and hiring the rare Vietnamese professors who 
understand the \"Western\" way of teaching, where students are 
expected to come to class having already read the material, 
prepared to participate in a class discussion.  He said 
around 50 percent of the teaching faculty are new, 
relatively young, and try to use the \"Western\" model.  The 
exchange program which An Giang University has developed 
with Bluffton College in Ohio has also helped faculty learn 
new pedagogical styles from visiting American professors, he 
remarked. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Regarding development of the current faculty, 
Dr. Xuan said he has had some difficulty getting the older 
faculty from the former An Giang Teachers\' Training College 
-- many of whom have been teaching for decades and are 
\"really set in their ways\" -- to adapt and develop new 
methods of teaching.  Before the next school year starts, 
Dr. Xuan plans to host a seminar to train faculty to use the 
computer program \"WebCities\" to make their syllabi and 
electronic reading material available to students on-line. 
 
11.  (U)  AGU boasts the largest computer library in 
Vietnam, with 100 computers donated from the Ford 
Foundation, but Dr. Xuan said the number of visitors to the 
library fell from 800 to 40 per week, as students tried to 
get course materials on-line and found the materials had not 
been uploaded by all of the professors.  He expressed 
optimism that AGU students will soon be able to access the 
Bluffton College \"Ohio Link\" electronic library, but 
lamented that because of slow on-line data transmission 
rates in Vietnam, students may not gain as much benefit as 
he hoped.  High-speed Internet connection via satellite link 
has recently been approved for use in two software parks in 
Vietnam.  When ConGen EconOff raised this with Dr. Xuan, he 
said AGU might need a connection like this to remain 
effective. 
 
12.  (U) Dr. Xuan said he would like see a migration of 
redundant labor in the agricultural sector to the industrial 
or service sectors, and has set up a curriculum to support 
this.  In 2000-2001, AGU admitted students for programs 
focusing on math, literature, English, business finance, and 
business accounting.  Starting in 2002, students were also 
admitted to programs focusing on agricultural products 
processing and preservation, rural development, agricultural 
engineering, information technology, and environmental 
management.  Dr. Xuan also suggested that Vietnamese rice 
farmers need to consoidate and rights in order to bring 
rice production to its most efficient level, but there is a 
lack of direction at the highest levels of government that 
could bring about this change.  Only if leadership 
establishes firm policies and offers incentives for farmers 
to be more efficient in the agricultural sector will the 
economy of Vietnam fundamentally change, he said. 
 
13.  (U) Note:  Dr. Xuan\'s strong background in agricultural 
development and wet rice cultivation is attracting students 
to AGU.  He is widely credited with being the man who saved 
Vietnam from famine in the early 1980s by improving methods 
of rice cultivation, and bears the nickname \"Dr. Rice\".  He 
is a member of the board of the Rockefeller Foundation. 
 
14.  (U)  Comment:  Both Dr. Tuan and Dr. Xuan expressed 
concern that Vietnam\'s agricultural economy is inefficient, 
and that there is a lack of leadership in the GVN in rural 
and agricultural development.  This lack of leadership has 
contributed to students choosing other areas of study, and 
to farmers using unproductive or counterproductive farming 
methods.  They were both disappointed by the relatively slow 
start to the VEF program and under-representation of the 
agricultural field.  They will seek to identify good 
candidates, and hope the VEF Board of Directors will address 
the need for agricultural development in Vietnam when 
considering applications next year. 
 
15.  (SBU)  Comment continued:  Both Dr. Tuan and Dr. Xuan 
said the professional experience and functional abilities of 
visiting faculty from the U.S. and other countries were 
sought-after commodities in Vietnam.  Dr. Tuan asked 
outright if the USG would be willing to start up an official 
\"volunteers\" program to send professors to CTU to teach. 
Many universities have approached ConGen seeking additional 
resources to improve teaching methodology and curriculum, as 
well as English language training.  Mission believes this 
may be the right time to begin negotiations on an MOU to 
bring Peace Corps Volunteers to Vietnam to address this 
need.  End comment.

SUBJECT: QUANG NAM GARMENT FACTORY:  TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE 
 
Summary 
------------ 
1.  Quang Nam Province is the home of the Quang Nam Garment 
Company, a small state-owned enterprise with about 800 employees 
and revenues of VND 20 billion per year (about US$1.3 million). 
On a brief visit to the company by DPO and Econoff, they saw a 
clean, well-lit, well-ventilated factory producing its last U.S. 
order for the year.  The visit provides a glimpse of how a small 
factory far from Vietnam\'s commercial and industrial centers is 
dealing with U.S. quotas, competing with larger firms in Hanoi and 
Ho Chi Minh City areas, and handling social accountability issues 
and economic reforms. Interestingly, the company director was 
enthusiastic about the possibility of equitization, or partial 
privatization in this case. 
 
Quang Nam - One of the Poorest Provinces 
---------------------------------------- 
2.  Located south of Danang along the central coast of Vietnam, 
Quang Nam is one of the poorest provinces in the South, with an 
average per capita income of US$230 per year.  The province does 
draw relatively large numbers of foreign tourists to its two 
UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the picturesque town of Hoi 
An and the ancient Cham ruins at My Son.  It is also the province 
with the highest number of \"Mothers of Revolutionary Heroes,\" 
that is, mothers who lost children fighting in the war - against 
us.  Outside of Hoi An, the province is relatively poor and has 
little industry.  Quang Nam is working actively to change this, 
with the development of the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone at the 
southern edge of the province (more to come Septel). 
 
Company Does Assembly Only and is on Its Last U.S. Order 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
3.  Unlike most textile/garment firms in the Ho Chi Minh City 
area, the Quang Nam Garment Company is a state-owned enterprise 
(SOE).  It is one of three subsidiaries of the Hoa Tho Textile 
Company based in Danang and is part of Vinatex, the huge textile 
conglomerate controlled by the Ministry of Industry.  Quang Nam 
Garment Company Director, Mr. Do Ngoc Phuong, showed us around the 
facility.  He noted that the factory simply filled orders provided 
by the mother company in Danang and did not have a separate sales 
or marketing function.  Its traditional markets were Japan, Korea, 
and Taiwan.  Marubeni, a well-known Japanese trading firm, is a 
particularly large customer.  The company cuts and assembles 
garments using fabric and other accessories coming directly from 
the buyer.  The only components sometimes sourced locally are 
thread and packaging materials.  Quang Nam Garment Company has 
about 800 employees and generates revenues of about 20 billion VND 
(about US$1.3 million), which amounts to only about US$1600 per 
worker per year. 
 
4.  Director Phuong stated that after the BTA went into force the 
company began to receive U.S. orders and had gradually shipped 
more and more to the American market.  So far this year the 
company had shipped 250,000 pieces to the U.S., he said.  But due 
to U.S. quotas, the factory was finishing up what he expected 
would be his last U.S. order for some time - a shipment of Dickies- 
brand trousers.  Mr. Phuong stated that the parent company had 
told him not to expect any additional quota or U.S. orders this 
year.  (Note: It is not clear whether the parent company does not 
expect to be allocated additional quota or if it just plans to 
allocate what it receives to other subsidiaries.  End note.)  Mr. 
Phuong said his company would once again focus on its traditional 
export markets, even though these orders were less profitable. 
 
Low Pay, Reasonable Conditions Equals Good Jobs 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
5.  Quang Nam Garment Company is located right up against busy 
National Highway 1A.  Our meeting with the director was in a 
shabby, drab administration building.  The factory itself, 
however, was surprisingly clean, well lit, well ventilated, and 
relatively cool on an extremely hot afternoon.  Some parts of the 
factory were air-conditioned.  For the first time Econoff saw 
Vietnamese men working at the sewing machines.  Typically in 
factories near Ho Chi Minh only women fill these jobs.  Salaries 
in Quang Nam are low, however.  Director Phuong reported that 
workers earn VND600,000 per month (less than US$40), which he 
believes is about 70% of the going rate in Ho Chi Minh City.  Mr. 
Phuong noted, however, there was low turnover rate, because in 
Quang Nam, these were considered good jobs with competitive 
salaries.  Many of the factory workers in the Ho Chi Minh City 
area come from places like Quang Nam.  But according to Mr. 
Phuong, these workers -- even with lower pay -- would much rather 
stay close to home where the cost of living is cheaper and 
surroundings more familiar. 
 
6.  When asked about social accountability issues, Director Phuong 
said the parent company handled any necessary certifications, 
although he only knew of the firm obtaining an ISO certification, 
not about meeting any social accountability standards.  He went on 
to say, however, that the company had made a number of changes to 
improve worker conditions for the U.S. market.  He particularly 
noted improved lighting, ventilation, air-conditioning and 
\"modernization of some of the production.\" 
 
7.  Quang Nam Garment Company\'s low wages and stable workforce 
give it a small competitive edge over firms in more expensive Ho 
Chi Minh City.  But Mr. Phuong also noted his central Vietnam 
location makes it more difficult for him to reach customers and 
that shipping is slower and more expensive from there, than from 
HCMC.  As other firms have also told us in central Vietnam, it is 
easier and faster for a company to truck its goods down to Saigon 
Port, rather than use port facilities in Danang, where ships call 
much less frequently. 
 
Plans to Equitize 
----------------- 
8.  When asked about development or expansion plans, Director 
Phuong stated the company was planning to be equitized by 2005, a 
move he strongly supported.  He said he believed it would make 
management and workers feel more personally responsible for the 
company and its success, and would improve its financial position. 
Equitization would only go so far, however.  When asked if he was 
worried about his company going it alone when it had yet to build 
up the most basic sales and marketing functions, he stated that 
even after equitization the parent company would retain a 50% 
interest in the company and would continue to perform those 
functions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
9.  In a poor, relatively remote provincial location, a steady job 
paying less than US$40 per month is considered good. 
Unfortunately, that appears to be this company\'s only competitive 
edge.  Quang Nam Garment Company, even with its successes, 
exemplifies the problem of many of Vietnam\'s garment firms.  They 
are basically assembly operations capturing only a small portion 
of the value of the final garment.   Although Director Phuong 
realizes he could increase his revenues dramatically if his 
company could do more than just assembly, he does not appear to 
have any plan or means to do so.  Nonetheless, this little textile 
firm in the center of Vietnam is able to compete in the global 
market successfully and be an important employer in an 
economically depressed area of the country.  And while the quota 
on U.S. goods is limiting his ability to get higher profit orders, 
Mr. Phuong seems confident that he can find buyers in his 
traditional Asian markets.

SUBJECT: HO CHI MINH CITY: COMPUTER RETAILING GETS MODERN - WITH 
SAME OLD IPR PROBLEMS 
 
1.  Summary.  On a visit to Ho Chi Minh City\'s newest Computer and 
IT superstore, ConGen EconOff, accompanied by a Vietnamese 
assistant, saw a local attempt at modern American-style computer 
retailing, but with the same old Vietnamese IPR problems.  The 
computers assembled by the company and sold under the company\'s 
trademark (which it is trying to promote and protect) use 
unlicensed software.  Some licensed software -- along with the 
usual assortment of pirated software -- is being offered for sale, 
however.  End Summary. 
 
2.  EconOff and Vietnamese assistant visited the recently opened 
Ho Chi Minh City branch of Nguyen Hoang Informatics on July 8. 
The company, which was founded in 1999 and is Vietnamese-owned and 
operated, also has branches in Danang, Vung Tau, Dong Nai and Buon 
Ma Thuot.  The store, whose opening was covered by the local 
press, bills itself as a computer superstore and is homegrown 
effort at modern computer retailing.  Unlike many of the mom and 
pop stores that crowd electronics districts in Ho Chi Minh City, 
Nguyen Hoang has wide aisles, a full line of products on display, 
catalogues prominently displaying prices and specs, and full 
warranty service.  Most notably, the store even has a Brand 
Manager who is trying to build the company trademark. 
 
3.  Nguyen Hoang Informatics sells pre-assembled computer units 
under the Nguyen Hoang trademark ranging in price from about $335- 
600.  The store also sells units from Acer, Hewlett-Packard, and 
SingPC and laptops from Acer, Compaq, Toshiba, IBM, NEC and 
MacIntosh.  Its catalog advertises other hardware accessories such 
as printers, scanners, speakers, and fax machines.  The shop also 
carries a full range of computer peripherals.  It is a licensed 
distributor for Intel.  Both the store-branded products and the 
name-brand machines carry warranties. 
 
4.  If the shop is an example of modern retailing, it is 
definitely modernization Vietnamese style.  This was revealed 
immediately when EconOff asked the company\'s brand manager, who 
was working the floor that morning, what software came loaded onto 
the pre-assembled units for sale.  His reponse: \"Whatever you 
want, we\'ll load it.  No problem. You want Windows 2000?  Windows 
ME?  We\'ve got it, I\'ve got a disk in the back, I\'ll set it up for 
you.\"  When asked whether those copies were licensed, he became 
very quiet, looked down at the floor, looked back up and said 
\"Sure.\"  Not surprisingly, however, the Microsoft country director 
later advised that while he was familiar with the store, to his 
knowledge none of the software loaded onto Nguyen Hoang\'s own 
brand computers is licensed. 
 
5.  EconOff observed several glass cases full of software in the 
store.  Based on price and packaging, some of the software 
appeared to be licensed.  The top of the line by far was a full- 
case display of AutoCad and AutoDesk promotional material, with 
each product priced at US $3300.  When asked why these products 
were so expensive, a store clerk smiled and replied \"Because they 
are licensed.  We have a license to sell this software.\"  The 
clerk noted that she had not received any orders for it yet, and 
said that if they ever did receive an order they would request a 
copy from their distributor and it would take some time for the 
product to arrive.  Elsewhere in the display case, however, 
Vietnamese licensed software, most of which was for English 
language study, was selling for between VND 50,000-120,000 
(approximately US $3.20-7.74). 
 
6.  The real bargains, however, were in another glass cabinet, 
where several pirated games, music CDs and software programs were 
displayed in cellophane packets.  Among them were Microsoft 2000 
operating system, Microsoft Millenium Edition operating system, 
and Microsoft Professional XP Suite -- all selling for VND 7500 
(approximately fifty US cents). 
 
7.  Comment:  It may be a positive sign that Ho Chi Minh City\'s 
first computer superstore has recognized the importance of 
developing and protecting trademarks -- specifically its own -- 
and offers at least some licensed software for sale.  But what is 
worrisome is that \"modern\" computer retailing in HCMC still 
includes nurturing a generation of consumers who believe 
developing countries have a right to cheap prices.  In a country 
where consumers are generally unwilling to pay for licensed 
copies, it is not surprising that what Nguyen Hoang Informatics 
has loaded onto its computers and most of what it has in stock is 
pirated.  This is standard Vietnamese observance of software IPR. 
In a separate conversation, Microsoft\'s company director noted 
that at HCMC\'s 8th \"ComputerWorld Expo\", virtually all of the 
computers on display were running on unlicensed software.  Modern 
retailing or not, IPR protection has a long way to go in the IT 
industry here.  End Comment.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S CATFISH FARMERS PETITION CONSULATE GENERAL, 
DEPT OF COMMERCE AND ITC FOR RELIEF 
 
 
Introduction and Summary 
------------------------ 
1.  On July 9, three fish farmers representing the Fisheries 
Association of An Giang, the province in the Mekong Delta where 
most of Vietnam\'s tra and basa fish are raised and processed, met 
with CG and Econoff at the Consulate General.  Indicating they 
represent about 40,000 farmers and family members involved in fish 
farming, they delivered a petition signed by more than 200 fish 
farmers protesting the anti-dumping margins set by the U.S. 
Department of Commerce on frozen basa and tra fillets and asked 
that the margins be reconsidered or delayed.  The petition itself 
was addressed to the Chairman of the ITC, the Secretary of 
Commerce, and the U.S. Consul General.  Hard copies of the 
petition and signatures will be forwarded to the ITC and the 
Department of Commerce. 
 
2.  The petitioners were represented by three fish farmers, all of 
relatively modest means.  Although large fish raising operations 
do exist in the Delta, most fish farmers work on houseboats that 
sit atop large fish cages floating in the Mekong River.  Farmers 
typically live in these boats with their families.  Two of the 
farmers who presented the petition owned one cage each, and one 
farmer, who spoke a bit of English, owned four cages.  All of the 
men were extremely polite, and made their points energetically, 
but with courtesy. 
 
June 17 Final Determination Brings Hard Times 
--------------------------------------------- 
3.  The fish farmers stated they were representing about 40,000 
farmers and family members who have been affected by the anti- 
dumping margins.  They stated that although they believed 
Vietnamese fish processors would still continue to make money, the 
brunt of the anti-dumping measures had fallen squarely on the 
shoulders of the fish farmers.  They pointed out that since the 
June 17 final determination had been issued, fish prices had 
fallen from about 10,000 -12,000 VND (65 -77 US cents) per kilo to 
about 8,500 VND (55 cents) per kilo currently.  They had been 
higher earlier in the year.  To break even, the farmers estimated 
they had to clear about 10,000 VND per kilo.  The men were very 
concerned that they would be unable to sell their current fish 
stocks without incurring substantial losses.  Even as prices 
remained low, they noted, they still had to feed the fish.  They 
were also worried the fish were growing larger than the size 
preferred by the processors, which would further depress the 
price. 
 
4.  When asked if they would be able to convert to raising other 
varieties of fish, they said that they would try to start raising 
roughy or tilapia, but they still had to unload their current 
stocks of tra and basa fish, which would push them into (further) 
debt.. 
 
We Can\'t Afford to Be \"Dumping\" 
------------------------------- 
5.  The fish farmers also argued that they had not been \"dumping\" 
their product on the U.S. market.  Although prices had fluctuated 
even before the anti-dumping case, the farmers could not afford to 
go without profits.  They pointed out that many fish farmers had 
to borrow against the value of their boats to secure funding and 
that they did not have enough capital to sustain losses.  Thus 
their current problem of disposing of their current stocks of tra 
and basa was extremely troubling.  They also pointed out that they 
buy their fish food and sell their fish at market prices - not at 
prices set or guided by any government authority.  Prices were low 
relative to the U.S., they noted, because of An Giang\'s natural 
environment, which is conducive to raising fish, low labor costs, 
and the fact that much of the labor was from family hands. 
 
6.  The three fish farmers asked the CG to pass along their views 
and for the USG to lower the margin rates or at least delay their 
imposition until current stocks could be sold. 
 
\"You Mean We Came All This Way for Nothing?\" 
-------------------------------------------- 
7.  CG Yamauchi thanked the farmers for their visit and assured 
them that she would pass along their views.  CG and Econoff then 
briefly outlined the process of an anti-dumping investigation and 
determinations.  The CG noted the process was quasi-judicial and 
allowed for public comment.  Anti-dumping cases are allowed under 
the Bilateral Trade Agreement and the U.S. mechanism is in line 
with WTO guidelines.  During the anti-dumping case, both the GVN 
and the Vietnamese industry had availed themselves of the 
opportunity to supply additional information and comment.   If 
Vietnam were a WTO member, she noted, Vietnam would have the right 
to take the decision to the WTO. She also noted that by law the 
U.S. Consulate had no role in the investigation or in the 
determination.  Econoff also clarified that at this point in the 
process, the margins had been already set and that the ITC 
decision, coming at the end of this month, is based on a 
determination of whether the U.S. catfish industry is actually 
suffering or facing the threat of material injury.  The ITC could 
not revise the margin rate, nor do they have the authority to 
delay imposition of the margins.  The farmers seemed surprised to 
learn this, and one of the farmers stated: \"So you mean that after 
coming here we have to go back to An Giang with nothing?\" 
 
8.  Comment:  It is difficult not to feel sympathetic toward these 
fish farmers, who went to considerable effort to travel the 6 
hours by car from An Giang Province to Ho Chi Minh City to state 
their case.  Each has been farming for at least 10 years, one for 
more than 20 years.  Their dark tans and calloused hands testify 
to their hard work.  They have earned a reasonable living, and by 
rural Vietnamese standards are relatively well-off.  Just the 
same, however, most of their assets are tied up in the boats they 
live on and the fish inside the floating cages underneath.  In at 
least the short term they will face substantial losses.   In time, 
according to these farmers, it is likely many farmers will be able 
to switch to other varieties of fish.  If enough do so, and demand 
for tra and basa continue to expand in non-US markets, prices will 
once again rise.  The farmers\' biggest worry now is whether or not 
they can sell their stocks without losing so much money that they 
go out of business before they even get a second chance at raising 
different fish.

Summary 
------- 
1. (SBU)  An influential leader of the Hue branch of the 
outlawed UBCV discussed his views with DPO and A/PAO on the 
current state of the Buddhist Church, the status of Thich 
Huyen Quang, and the need for continued U.S. pressure on the 
GVN to allow greater religious freedom.  The meeting was 
marred briefly by GVN attempts to first block the call on 
the monks at their pagoda, then surveil the visit. 
 
All Buddhists Are One, but U.S. Assistance Helps 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2.  (SBU)  Summary: On June 17, 2003 Deputy Principal 
Officer, U.S. Consulate General of Ho Chi Minh City, met 
with DPO and A/PAO called on Thich Thien Hanh, leader of the 
Hue Branch of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam 
(UBCV), and his assistant Thich Phu Viet at the Bao Quoc 
Pagoda in Hue last month.  During their two-hour meeting, 
the religious leader reiterated his organization\'s now 
standard \"line\" that to discuss the UBCV\'s current status in 
Vietnam, as well as the health and well being of Thich Huyen 
Quang, leader of the UBCV currently under house arrest. End 
Summary.most monks in Vietnam actually belong to the UBCV. 
In his view, the UBCV and the officially recognized Vietnam 
Buddhist Sangha (VBS) were divided artificially but were 
still one.  He also said more than 60 percent of the 
population in Hue followed the UBCV, as opposed to roughly 
40-50 percent of the population nationwide.  This high 
concentration of UBCV followers in Hue had always given the 
local monks great influence within the organization.  His 
own Bao Quoc Pagoda had 26 monks, while the largest in the 
area had 80.  He also referred to 500 pagodas in Thua Thien- 
Hue province and 200 in the city of Hue alone, although it 
was unclear whether or not these were all UBCV.  The last 
new pagoda was built in 1981, the same year the UBCV was 
outlawed. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Thich Thien Hanh said he had seen conflicting 
signs of change in the GVN\'s attitude towards religious 
freedom.  There were no restrictions on individuals 
practicing their religion or discussions within the UBCV 
pagodas.  There were currently no UBCV monks or believers in 
the Hue area facing detention and no domestic travel 
restrictions.  He noted, however, that international travel 
remained difficult, citing a member of the UBCV who was 
denied permission to travel to China in 2001 as the most 
recent specific case.  There were also restrictions on 
building new pagodas.  His main concern remains legalizing 
the status of the UBCV. 
 
4.  (SBU)  According to Thich Thien Hanh, the GVN was 
worried that a \"legalized\" UBCV might develop into a 
political party challenging the authority of the Communist 
Party (CPV).  Asked directly about the possibility of 
working within the current legal framework of the GVN, Thich 
Thien Hanh felt it would be difficult, but might be 
possible.  His assistant seemed even more skeptical.  Even 
so, Thich Thien Hanh called on the USG to aid in the UBCV\'s 
quest for legal recognition within Vietnam.  He repeated 
this several times and stated explicitly that it was his 
only request, although he also hoped the U.S., as a 
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 
would continue working to persuade the GVN to respect human 
rights in accordance with its UN obligations. 
 
Thich Huyen Quang 
----------------- 
5.  (SBU)  Based on reports from a Hue monk who had just 
returned from Quy Nhon, UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang 
(ref A) was in good health.  Monks were allowed to visit him 
freely and speak with him privately and UBCV and VBS had 
gone jointly to see him.  While he remained unrestricted in 
his ability to travel, he was required to have a GVN escort 
at all times.  Thich Thien Hanh briefly recounted the 
Patriarch\'s visit to Hue in April 2003, noting that 3,000 to 
4,000 people had turned out to greet him upon his arrival. 
As the visit had been approved by the GVN in advance, there 
had been no negative reaction from the local authorities. 
 
External Relations Still Sensitive 
---------------------------------- 
6.  (SBU)  Shortly before the meeting was scheduled to 
begin, an FSN from the HCMC Public Affairs staff was called 
in to speak with the Director of the Hue Office of External 
Relations (ERO), Mr. Chau Binh Nguyen.  Mr. Nguyen advised 
PAS FSN that he was aware of a meeting \"at a pagoda\" and 
that ConGen officers should not hold the meeting because it 
had not sent a diplomatic note requesting permission.  DPO 
explained that the agreement between the USG and GVN -- the 
same agreement that theoretically binds their officers in 
San Francisco to notify us of their travel outside of that 
city -- required prior notification (not permission) for 
official meetings with government officials.  After checking 
with Thich Thien Hanh -- who seemed genuinely surprised that 
the ERO knew we were coming but clearly wanted the meeting 
to proceed regardless -- DPO decided to hold the meeting as 
planned. 
 
7.  (SBU)  ConGen drivers indicated there were police 
present when the DPO and APAO arrived at the pagoda, 
although they were not clearly visible and made no attempt 
to stop the meeting.  When ConGen officers left, however, 
they observed a handful of individuals who appeared to be 
plainclothes police within the compound, and several police 
cars with uniformed police standing just outside the gate. 
ConGenoffs did not observe any police following them from 
the pagoda.  In a follow-up call the next day, the monks at 
the pagoda reported no problems after the meeting.  Mr. 
Nguyen continued to express his concern that the meeting had 
taken place without a dip note which he could share with the 
local Committee on Religious Affairs. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8.  (SBU)  Despite the free and open exchange with Thich 
Thien Hanh, including his own generally positive 
pronouncements on the continuing ability of the UBCV to 
practice their religion and attract followers, the actions 
of the provincial leadership illustrate the ongoing official 
paranoia over unrecognized religious groups.  There is also 
a more general pattern of provincial authorities seeking to 
\"approve\" all ConGen meetings in their localities.  The Hue 
ERO\'s argument that we needed a diplomatic note due to Thich 
Thien Hanh\'s status as a religious leader was disingenuous 
at best, given that the Vietnamese government does not 
recognize the UBCV as a religion.  On the bright side, even 
though Mr. Nguyen remained adamant about the need for a dip 
note, he stressed that the ConGen could hold its meeting 
without a GVN presence.

SUBJECT: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT AS A GATEWAY TO THE U.S.? 
 
1.  Summary:  Recent advertisements carried in local Ho Chi Minh 
City newspapers for a real estate investment opportunity in 
Houston, Texas, attracted significant interest among local 
investors and the local press.  Post interest was aroused by 
implications in the advertisements that this investment would 
allow investors\' children to attend public schools in the U.S., 
and that the Consulate had agreed in advance to notarize all 
documents related to the real estate sales.  Post issued a press 
release widely reported in the local press disavowing any USG 
endorsement or approval of the project and warning potential 
buyers that Vietnamese citizens need student visas to study in the 
U.S.  Post CONS and ECON chiefs sat down with the company\'s 
directors to discuss the misleading nature of the advertisements, 
and to clarify what the ConGen could and could not do in 
connection with visas and notarial services for Vietnamese 
investors.  The company has since printed a retraction of its 
earlier claims and has promised to clarify these issues with all 
potential buyers.  We expect that this is the first of many such 
investments that will be marketed to Vietnam\'s new monied class. 
End Summary. 
 
Buying a Piece of America 
-------------------------------- 
2.  In late June, a series of advertisements in local newspapers 
claimed that, for the first time, Vietnamese citizens would be 
allowed to invest in property in the United States.  SEI (Southern 
Investment and Informatics Corporation) Corp. of Ho Chi Minh City 
was offering 86 lots at a cost of USD 35,000 each, in a property 
development near Houston, Texas, under the name Diamond Star. 
Post\'s Public Affairs and ACS units received numerous inquiries 
about the advertisements, drawing our attention to implications 
within the ads that purchase of land in Houston would permit 
owners\' children to attend public school, and that the Consulate 
General had agreed in advance to notarize all the real estate 
contracts.  Aside from the obviously misleading information 
regarding student visas, the implications contained in the ads 
that a special agreement had been reached between the GVN and the 
USG on this project raised concerns that the public might believe 
the USG had in some way endorsed or approved the investment 
project. 
 
Is This for Real? 
------------------ 
3.  In an effort to obtain details on the real estate investment 
deal, and to correct the misleading information in contained in 
the ads, Post\'s Fraud Prevention Manager contacted an SEI 
official, who responded that all of the information in the 
advertisement was technically correct, if examined from a certain 
point of view, and that SEI had in no way promised buyers that 
they would obtain student visas for their children.  This lack of 
responsiveness on the part of SEI raised further concerns that the 
Diamond Star Project might, in fact, be a scam.  Post\'s FCS office 
contacted the Department of Commerce office in Houston, Texas to 
determine if Diamond Star was a real project with actual real 
property for sale in Houston.  FCS confirmed that Diamond Star was 
a project registered by U.S. Southern Corporation, a wholiy-owned 
subsidiary of SEI. 
 
Post Clarifies Matters and SEI Comes Forward 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
4.  Post issued a press release to local newspapers in response to 
the advertisements and public and press inquiries regarding 
Diamond Star.  In the statement, the Consulate General disavowed 
any USG involvement in real estate deals and unequivocally stated 
that student visas are adjudicated and notarial services are 
provided solely on a case-by-case basis.  The subsequent media 
interest in the case grew as did questions about the bona fides of 
the project, and the directors of SEI Corporation found themselves 
trying to fend off new rumors that they may in fact not be a 
legitimate investment. 
 
5.  Upon further investigation of SEI, it became clear that one of 
the main investors of the company was a contact well and favorably 
known to the Econ section.  Mr. Dang Thanh Tam, who owns 25% of 
the company, is also director of a number of successful industrial 
parks in Vietnam.  At our request, he and a director of the 
company, Ms. Chau Ngoc Thi Nguyen met with ECON and CONS chiefs on 
June 30 to clarify their position. 
 
6.  ConGenoffs detailed Post\'s concerns regarding the misleading 
nature of SEI\'s advertisements, as well as our concerns over the 
response of SEI when contacted by our FPM.  CONS chief clarified 
the legal requirements for obtaining a student visa and the 
general circumstances governing notarial services at a U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate.  ECON reiterated that the advertisements 
troubled many of Post\'s staff, particularly the CG, as they led 
readers to believe that the USG somehow endorsed or approved this 
investment opportunity.  He stated that while Post is pleased to 
see increased interest in trade and investment between the U.S. 
and Vietnam, we are not in a position to support any particular 
project. 
 
7.  Ms. Nguyen provided details on the structure of SEI and U.S. 
Southern Corporation, described the real estate investment 
development project in Houston as well as planned future 
developments in Texas and Florida, and apologized for any 
confusion and concern the advertisements caused.  Both SEI 
officials promised to clarify the statements made in the 
advertisement, and promised that advertisements for future 
projects would not make such claims.  Mr. Tam also apologized for 
the advertising and market campaign that he characterized as 
sloppy and misleading.  He stated that this was only one of many 
projects that he was involved in, and as a minority shareholder 
(his sister holds majority share) he had not followed it very 
closely.  He assured us, however, that he would fix whatever 
needed fixing and that he did not want this \"small project\" to 
damage his reputation. 
 
8. On July 1, SEI forwarded a draft press statement to Post for 
our clearance, correcting the misinformation contained in their 
earlier advertisements and apologizing for any confusion such 
statements may have caused to potential investors.  A few days 
later the Justice Newspaper, widely read in Ho Chi Minh City, ran 
an article based on information from SEI in which SEI apologized 
for its earlier misleading advertisements and made clear that the 
visa issue is separate from any property transaction.  The Saigon 
Times Weekly also ran a letter to the editor from SEI in which it 
also reviewed the same issues.  No further advertisements for 
Diamond Star have appeared in the local press; however, Post 
continues to receive inquiries from member of the local media. 
 
Economics of the Deal 
-------------------------- 
9.  Initially press reports indicated that all 86 lots sold out 
within 36 hours of going on sale. As of July 15, however, most of 
those who \"registered\" to buy a lot have already cancelled.  Five 
buyers in Vietnam have put down 10% deposits, and another ten lots 
have been sold to buyers in the U.S.  It is not clear if potential 
buyers abandoned the project because of the bad publicity,  after 
they became aware that they were only buying land and not the 
right for their children to study in the U.S., or if difficulties 
in actually making the investment interfered with the transaction. 
Mr. Tam correctly noted to Econoff that Vietnam has not yet 
permitted capital to be remitted overseas for property 
investments, but his company is seeking permission.  All of the 
five current potential buyers in Vietnam have family or business 
interests in the United States so they do not face the same 
restrictions.  If this permission to remit funds overseas is not 
granted, it would make the sale of the remainder of the lots much 
more difficult. 
 
10.  Comment:  Although it is likely that the implication of easy 
student visas and USG backing was responsible for much of the 
strong initial interest in the Diamond Star lots, it is also 
indicative of a growing moneyed class in Vietnam that would like 
to invest abroad.  Land ownership is a popular investment choice 
among the Vietnamese, and Houston, with its large Vietnamese- 
American community, is a natural site for such development 
projects.  According to SEI, most of their buyers were people with 
relatives already in Houston, people planning to immigrate to the 
area in the near future, and companies whose owners are interested 
in having their children attend school in the U.S.  This case 
clearly illustrates the need for further public outreach regarding 
visa processing as well as general information on the role of the 
USG in daily life.  The case also shows that there is a growing 
class of people here with significant private resources despite 
the poverty reflected in the overall economic statistics for 
Vietnam.   Mr. Tam stated that this is the first of several 
property development projects overseas that SEI plans to market 
primarily to buyers in Vietnam.  End Comment.

Thich Huyen Quang at the Nguyen Thieu Monastery in Quy Nhon July 
15-20.  This was Thich Quang Do\'s first trip outside of HCMC since 
being placed under \"probationary detention\" for two years in June 
2001.  He traveled by train accompanied by a delegation of UBCV 
monks.  He did not inform the GVN of his travel, had no trouble 
during the trip, and there were no GVN officials at his meetings. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Several other delegations of senior monks from UBCV 
chapters in Hue, HCMC and the Central Provinces joined the group 
in Quy Nhon for a meeting to discuss the future of the UBCV.  They 
reportedly reviewed UBCV personnel throughout Vietnam from Quang 
Tri province southward.  Among the monks who participated were 
Thien Hanh, Thai Hoa, Phuoc Vien, and Nhu Dat from Hue, and Hai

returned to the Thanh Minh Zen Monastery in HCMC.  Thich Tue Sy 
said he did not think Thich Quang Do has had any problems with the

appreciation for the \"external intervention\" that had convinced 
the GVN to allow the monks to travel so freely. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do has, however, developed some health 
problems with his heart.  He had a physical examination prior to 
his trip to Quy Nhon and got permission from his doctors to travel 
while waiting for the results.  He will find out soon whether he 
will need surgery.  He has no future plans to travel due to his 
health and had postponed his visit to Thich Huyen Quang from July 
10 because of his health problems.  According to Thich Tue Sy, 
Thich Huyen Quang is in better health at 86 years of age than 
Thich Quang Do is at 74.

REF:  HCMC 1270 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  While the official rhetoric seemed to focus 
on respect for religion and the importance of meeting the 
\"spiritual needs\" of the people during the Ambassador\'s recent 
visit to Dak Lak and Lam Dong provinces, local Protestant church 
leaders told a story of continuing limits on organized religious 
worship amidst a flourishing underground church.  Unlike the 
province\'s Catholics, who suffer most from official control over 
numbers of seminarians and priests, Protestants seem to face 
almost impossible conditions on sanctioned worship and the 
registration of new churches.  Most startling was the perhaps 
unintended disclosure by local Protestant representatives that the 
vast majority of unofficial house churches have already applied 
for official recognition, despite government claims that only a 
handful have tried to legalize their status.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  The Ambassador, Emboffs, and ConGenoffs visited Dak Lak 
and Lam Dong provinces July 23-26, making calls on the People\'s 
Committees, religious leaders, and the provincial government 
offices responsible for religious and ethnic minority affairs. 
They also visited government offices responsible for economic 
planning and investment, private businesses, local universities, 
and a local village (septels). 
 
3.  (SBU)  Lam Dong People\'s Committee Chairman Phan Thien 
described human rights and religious freedom as a process -- one 
in which Vietnam wanted to obtain the highest level. 
Acknowledging the importance of religion to fulfill the spiritual 
needs of the people, Chairman Thien said that local authorities 
should develop a better understanding of the regulations governing 
religion to better deal with religious believers.  At the same 
time, he held the Protestants responsible for a historical 
association with separatists that made it difficult to distinguish 
between authentic believers and Dega.  While comparing the 
screening of applications for new Protestant churches to the 
scrutiny accorded Muslims in the U.S. in the aftermath of 9/11, he 
assured the Ambassador that he had instructed the relevant 
authorities to speed up the recognition process. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Dak Lak People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang 
characterized his guiding principle in dealing with religion as 
respect for individual freedom to worship.  He reminded the 
Ambassador that 22 pastors from Dak Lak had traveled to attend the 
organizing conference for the government recognized Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) in April 2001.  Currently, he 
said, there were two legal Protestant churches in the province. 
Two more were under consideration by provincial officials.  Asked 
directly about reports of church closures, Chairman Lang responded 
that no \"churches\" could have been closed since there were only 
the two legal churches.  (Comment:  Betraying what may come closer 
to his real feelings on the subject, he pointed out that the 
ethnic minorities were never religious until they were converted 
by foreigners. End comment)  He noted a steady decrease in the 
number of migrants to Dak Lak --both Kinh Vietnamese and ethnic 
minorities -- even as the economy continued to grow. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Vo Van Tai, Chairman of the Dak Lak provincial 
Committee on Religious and Ethnic Minority Affairs, provided a 
somewhat longer recitation on the current state of religion in Dak 
Lak.  He said there were presently 100,000 Buddhists (up from 
40,000 in 1975), 5,000 Cao Dai, and 213,00 Catholics (up from 
60,000 over the same period) in Dak Lak.  The Catholic Church had 
gone from one bishop and 34 priests to 2 bishops and 78 priests 
during that time, and currently had three seminarians from the 
province studying at the Sea Star Seminary in Nha Trang.  He said 
there were 130,000 Protestants in Dak Lak, including 40,000 who 
had been \"officially baptized,\" but became quite angry at the 
Ambassador\'s reference to the \"Dega\" as Protestants.  To 
demonstrate the province\'s other achievements, he noted that a Dak 
Lak pastor currently served on the SECV Executive Board in HCMC, 
while two ethnic minority students studied at the SECV seminary 
there.  As an aside, he remarked that eight others had \"failed\" to 
meet the entrance requirements for the seminary, but did not 
elaborate on whether those were the requirements of the SECV or 
the government. 
 
6.  (SBU)  According to Chairman Tai, the two legal Protestant 
churches, recognized in late 2001, served approximately 1,000 
believers in Buon Me Thuot and Phuoc An (30 kilometers form the 
provincial capital).  Giving slightly different numbers than 
Chairman Lang, he said that four more churches had applied for 
recognition and were currently under consideration.  The two 
applications he had discussed with the Consul General on her last 
visit (ref A) had merely been verbal at the time, but had now been 
submitted officially in writing.  Describing the registration 
process, he said the SECV required that each church 
(\"association\") have 200 members before it could apply for 
recognition.  Once approved, they could then apply for permission 
to build an actual church structure and assign a permanent pastor. 
While all were free to practice at home alone, problems sometimes 
arose when groups tried to practice their faith in an organized 
manner.  He added that churches could not be issued permits to 
build until they were recognized.  However, they could only be 
recognized after they had gathered informally for a time and then 
asked for permission.  Unrecognized churches needed to be 
disbanded because they were built without permits and were 
inherently dangerous. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Emphasizing that all legal church and social activities 
were allowed so long as they did not harm society, Chairman Tai 
gave his personal assurance that no provincial official had ever 
tried to disband an existing church, or attempt to force the 
renunciation of anyone\'s religious faith.  Referring to the list 
of specific cases provided by the Consul General on her last 
visit, he assured the Ambassador that none of the 43 individuals 
named could have been arrested for religious reasons because none 
were on the provincial list of religious believers.  The 
Ambassador suggested Chairman Tai send the list to MPS to see if 
any of the 43 was on the list of people who had actually been 
arrested. 
 
8.  (SBU)  The provincial SECV Representative Board provided a 
surprisingly frank assessment of the situation faced by 
Protestants in Dak Lak.  The local Board consists of ethnic 
minority Ede pastors Y Ta and Y Ke Eban, as well as Truong Xuan 
Dieu, a former chaplain in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and 
the current legal pastor of the recognized church in Phuoc An. 
They received the Ambassador in the home (and house church) of an 
unrecognized Kinh pastor who serves as secretary to the Board. 
Pastor Dieu was unable to attend.  Speaking generally about 
conditions for worship in Dak Lak, the pastors noted that the two 
legal churches (Pastor Dieu\'s mixed Kinh and Ede congregation and 
Pastor Mai Hai\'s predominantly Ede congregation in town) were able 
to operate regular Sunday schools.  Most of the remainder of the 
province\'s Protestants practiced their faith at home, but some 
still gathered together unofficially.  While there were not enough 
bibles to go around, the Board had requested more from provincial 
authorities and the SECV offices in HCMC. 
 
9.  (SBU)  The three pastors affirmed that there were currently 
four applications for recognition pending government approval -- 
three belonging to them and a fourth for an ethnic minority M\'nong 
pastor in Dak Min District.  The four congregations had close to 
5,000 members between them (the Kinh was the smallest, with only 
500), and the government had promised they would be approved this 
year.  They understood that the government needed to look at the 
background of the pastors and the \"conditions of worship\" among 
the believers, but assured the Ambassador that they were all 
\"authentic\" Protestants. 
\"Troublemakers\" sometimes came to local house churches talking of 
separatism, but there was no contact with foreigners.  The pastors 
then confided that they had actually forwarded 70 applications for 
recognition in late 2002.  Provincial authorities had then picked 
out just the four for possible approval. 
 
10.  (SBU)  Comment:  While the meetings with provincial officials 
covered little or no new ground, the rather startling revelation 
by the SECV Board regarding the large number of applications 
submitted for official recognition provides the first real 
evidence that the GVN has been going slow on new church approvals. 
Prior to departing for the trip, ConGenoffs heard a similar 
allegation from a Lam Dong pastor with whom they met in HCMC. 
According to that source, all of the house churches in Lam Dong 
had already applied for recognition through the appropriate SECV 
channels.  There, too, the provincial authorities seemed to be 
picking and choosing a few churches for possible recognition, 
while the others were afraid to press for attention.  At the very 
least, this points to something less than honesty and fair dealing 
from the provincial administrations (and possibly the central 
government).  At the same time, this new information may present a 
unique opportunity to challenge the government on the slow rate of 
approvals and bring light to what has thus far been a very  opaque 
process.  The bottom line, though, is that despite GVN heavy- 
handedness and not atypical slow operating procedures, religious 
life for Christians continues, albeit mostly in non-recognized, 
unofficial church gatherings.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANT CHURCH CAN STAY -- FOR NOW 
 
REF:  (A) HCMC 520  (B)  HCMC 551 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  The HCMC People\'s Committee has decided that 
an illegally constructed Protestant church in the Thu Thiem area 
of District 2 can remain open as a house of worship, pending 
approval of the required permits.  While city officials made clear 
that they hold both church leaders and local authorities 
responsible for the current impasse, they have nonetheless 
promised to speed necessary approvals to allow the church to build 
a new, legal structure.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Acting Consul General raised the issue of a Protestant 
house church recently constructed without permission in HCMC\'s 
District 2 (reftels) during a meeting with Mr. Nguyen Thanh Tai, 
Vice Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee.  Vice Chairman Tai\'s 
portfolio includes religious affairs.  Noting that the new 
church\'s difficulties in obtaining the required permits had been 
publicized in a press release by Compass Direct, A/CG offered the 
Vice Chairman an opportunity to provide his views on the 
situation. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Vice Chairman Tai seemed immediately aware of the 
controversy surrounding the new structure and took advantage of 
the opportunity to present the \"official\" version of events to 
avoid \"misinformation.\"  Recounting the recent history of the 
disputed property, he said that people from the local house church 
congregation had originally bought the land under their own names, 
then later claimed they wanted to use it for their \"house of 
worship\" (this term was used repeatedly, rather than the more 
common Vietnamese word for \"church\").  That change from a private 
to a public purpose led to the current dispute over land-use 
rights and created delays in the issuance of permits. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Permission to build was also held up pending official 
recognition for the \"new\" congregation.  (Note:  Pastor Truong Van 
Nganh, leader of the District 2 congregation, is a legally 
recognized pastor with the official Southern Evangelical Church of 
Vietnam (SECV).  It is not clear, however, whether that status 
entitles him automatically to open a legal church in another 
location.  End note.)  A lack of clear communication between the 
parties only exacerbated the problem.  Meanwhile, some members of 
the congregation \"took advantage\" of the situation to commence the 
unauthorized construction. 
 
5.  (SBU) Upon learning of the problem, Vice Chairman Tai 
immediately convened a meeting with SECV representatives and local 
authorities from District 2.  (Note:  This would appear to be the 
meeting that was described in the Compass Direct report as an 
appointment with the Committee for Religious Affairs.  End note.) 
He reprimanded Pastor Nganh for setting a bad example and 
chastised him for failing to observe safe building practices at a 
site that was deemed to be \"sacred\" (the Vice Chairman\'s word) and 
would house many worshippers. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Stating up front that the Pastor had broken the law and 
would need to eventually tear down the structure, the Vice 
Chairman laid out additional steps the church could take to build 
a legal structure on the site.  Based on what he called the 
\"spiritual need\" for a church in the area, however, he gave the 
congregation permission to use the illegal building until they 
received their permit for a new building.  At the same time, he 
blamed the local authorities for delaying the permits and required 
them to sign a document admitting their mistakes.  He then 
directed the relevant authorities to make sure the land was 
properly demarcated and the permits issued. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Pastor Nganh reported to ConGenoffs earlier that he had 
submitted an application for an address for the new church on July 
21.  The local authorities had denied his request on the grounds 
that the construction was illegal.  On July 25, the People\'s 
Committee of District 2 had levied a fine for the illegal 
construction and ordered him to remove the offending structure. 
He was also instructed to withdraw an earlier complaint regarding 
the initial denial of his permit and write a letter seeking 
reexamination of the issues related to his violation.  While 
Pastor Nganh felt compelled to comply with these requirements 
during the meeting, he had subsequently complained to the HCMC 
Committee for Religious Affairs.  He was still awaiting their 
response.  A number of house church pastors associated with the 
project but unaffiliated with the SECV criticized Pastor Nganh for 
his compromise and pledged to hold the line against removing the 
current structure. 
 
8.  (SBU) Comment:  At this point, the ball seems to rest firmly 
in the hands of Pastor Nganh and his followers.  Are they willing 
and financially able to remove the old church and build a new one? 
If so, can they overcome \"hard-line\" elements in the church that 
consider the victory already won and don\'t want to back down? 
While there would still seem to be many questions regarding the 
legal status of the congregation in District 2, the highest levels 
of the city administration have clearly given them the go-ahead to 
carry on religious activities at the site now and in the future if 
they accept the compromise that has been offered.

SUBJECT: Vietnam:  Pirates in the Gulf of Thailand 
 
1.  (SBU)  During a courtesy call on the Kien Giang 
provincial People\'s Committee, Ambassador Burghardt asked 
Chairman Bui Ngoc Suong and Vice Chairman Van Ha Phong for 
their views on reports of increasing maritime piracy in the 
Gulf of Thailand and the impact on Vietnamese fishermen. 
Noting that the majority of cases involved Cambodian 
criminal elements, Chairman Suong indicated that pirates 
from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand have also been 
implicated in attacks on Vietnamese fishermen. 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to the Chairman, there are no measures 
currently in place to effectively control piracy on the Gulf 
of Thailand.  One important contributing factor has to do 
with the lack of a definitive maritime border between 
Vietnam and Cambodia.  As a result, Vietnamese fishermen 
often stray into what Cambodian considers its waters in 
search of more profitable catches.  These fishermen view the 
threat of piracy as a small price to pay, especially since 
most acts of piracy consist of holding fishing boats and 
their crews hostage while ransom demands are worked out with 
the families.  While ransom demands might start as high as 
15 million VND (USD$1000), they can often be negotiated down 
to a more manageable 5 million VND (USD$330).  According to 
the Chairman, chances for greater enforcement from the 
Cambodian side seemed unlikely, as many of the pirates from 
across the border appear to be law enforcement officers from 
the coast guard, border guard, or fisheries management 
agency.  Last year, Vietnamese forces arrested one Cambodian 
lieutenant and shot another (affiliations unknown) for acts 
of piracy. 
 
3.  (U)  Kien Giang province, located in southwestern 
Vietnam, shares a 56-kilometer land border with Cambodia and 
a long history of maritime disputes in the Gulf of Thailand. 
Problems have likely been exacerbated recently due to 
increased fishing as the province seeks to actively develop 
its seafood production capabilities. Income generated from 
fishing accounts for 30 percent of Kien Giang\'s seafood 
products industry - an industry which generated over 2.5 
billion VND ($163 million USD) in revenue last year and 
represented 50 percent of all exports from the province. 
With Kien Giang alone accounting for 11 percent of Vietnam\'s 
total output in this sector, an increase in the incidents of 
maritime piracy may have the potential to threaten more than 
just the livelihoods of a few fishermen, but for now 
provincial officials seem resigned to accept the status quo.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM:  US MILITARY DONATION WELCOMED IN MEKONG DELTA 
 
1.  Summary.  In a goodwill event that generated enthusiastic 
local and national press coverage, Acting Consul General, Defense 
Attache Col. Stephen Ball, U.S. Army Pacific John Almarez, and 
Congen Econoff, participated in a handover ceremony at Can Tho 
General Hospital to commemorate the donation of surplus US Army 
medical equipment valued at over USD300,000.  The hospital 
director noted in his remarks that the heart defibrillator donated 
had already saved 15 lives.  Dramatic interest in Col. Ball\'s 
presence as well as the willingness to work closely with and 
recognize the role of the U.S. military are positive signs that 
the US - Vietnam defense relationship is moving forward.  After 
Department of Health officials expressed a further need for help 
for the not yet opened Can Tho Delta Regional Hospital, DOD is now 
in the process of identifying hospital beds from surplus stock 
that it may be able to donate. End summary 
 
Ceremony Generates Significant Press 
------------------------------------- 
2.  The handover ceremony was held at the Can Tho General 
Hospital, a six hundred bed public hospital that serves Can Tho 
and surrounding provinces.  About 100 people - doctors, nurses, 
provincial officials, and a large number of reporters - crowded 
into the meeting room which, in addition to a large bust of Ho Chi 
Minh, had on display some of the items that had been donated in 
the shipment.  The event generated significant press interest, 
airing on local and national TV newscasts and instigating several 
print articles. 
 
3.  Taking pride of place at the front of the room was a 
centrifuge along with other electronic equipment.  During the 
ceremony, local officials, including Can Tho Hospital Director Dr. 
Tran Sophia, thanked the U.S. Consulate General and the U.S. Army 
for the gift and noted that much of the equipment was already in 
\"efficient use.\"  Most dramatically, Dr. Sophia noted that the 
defibrillator included in the donation had already \"saved the 
lives of 15 patients.\"  This comment was welcomed with thunderous 
applause. 
 
4.  The donation, which included everything from bandages and 
surgical tables to high tech electronic equipment, is valued at 
well over three hundred thousand US dollars.  It came from the 
Department of Defense Humanitarian Assistance Program - Excess 
Property from two sites in Japan.  The donated surplus medical 
supplies arrived in Vietnam in two shipments - one in October last 
year and another this January.  John Almarez, International 
Logistics Plans Officer with U.S. Army Pacific, who handled much 
of the logistical issues for the U.S. military, traveled from 
Hawaii to attend the ceremony. 
 
5.  In her remarks the acting CG noted that this gift was part of 
an overall assistance effort undertaken by the USG in Vietnam, and 
that a number of projects have had a direct impact on Can Tho and 
the rest of the Mekong Delta.  As Vietnam\'s largest bilateral 
donor in the area of HIV/AIDS programs, for example, the USG funds 
a program in Can Tho run by Family Health International.  The U.S. 
also funds cultural and university programs at Can Tho University 
and provides disaster assistance to families hit by flooding in 
the Delta.  The Mekong Delta also benefits from programs at the 
national level focused on BTA implementation, such as the STAR 
project. 
 
Eyes and Cameras Turn to the Man in Uniform 
------------------------------------------- 
6.  In his remarks, Col. Ball noted that while economic activities 
attracted the most attention in the growing and deepening U.S. - 
Vietnam relationship, our defense relationship was also growing. 
He stated that the officer exchanges, conferences, and regional 
meetings in which both the U.S. and Vietnamese militaries 
participated were important.  He called this gift to the Can Tho 
General Hospital a small display of the U.S. commitment to 
building a positive relationship with Vietnam. 
 
7.  The presence of Col. Ball generated a great deal of interest. 
He is probably the first US military officer in uniform that many 
of these people had seen in some time.  When he rose to speak he 
was literally showered with flashbulbs as photographers rushed to 
capture the moment.  At the conclusion of the ceremony reporters 
and others eager to meet him and express their thanks again 
surrounded Col. Ball. 
 
Additional Donations Possible 
----------------------------- 
8.  The Health Department of Can Tho is currently constructing a 
new hospital that should open sometime at the beginning of next 
year.  The current facility is a group of buildings, some clearly 
dating from the French Colonial period, which are showing their 
age.  Hospital officials made a point to show that much of the 
equipment was already being used, and after the ceremony the 
delegation was given a quick tour where they could see some of the 
equipment in use.  The hospital director also pointed out some of 
the larger pieces of equipment such as a couple of dental chairs 
and related equipment that were still in crates and would be used 
in the new hospital facility.  Col. Ball and Mr. Almarez were 
impressed with the efforts of the hospital staff to make good use 
of the equipment.  Mr. Almarez is already in the process of trying 
to locate surplus hospital beds that could perhaps be donated 
under the humanitarian assistance program to the new facility. 
 
Comment - A Reason to Feel Good 
------------------------------- 
9.  Comment:  This handover ceremony was truly a \"feel good\" 
event.  Department of Health authorities, which had peppered 
Congen with phone calls in the days leading up to the event to get 
it \"just right,\" were clearly interested in expressing their 
appreciation and demonstrating that the equipment was being put to 
good use.  At a time when irritants in our trading relationship - 
such as the catfish anti-dumping case which will have a direct 
impact on Can Tho\'s seafood processing industry - often take 
center stage, this event suggests that a reserve of goodwill 
exists in the Mekong Delta.  In particular, the interest and press 
coverage of the military aspect of this event is another positive 
sign for the continuing development of the defense relationship.

SUBJECT: POLICE RAID \"ILLEGAL\" HOUSE CHURCH IN HCMC DURING A/S 
DEWEY\'S VISIT TO VIETNAM 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Just prior to the return of Assistant Secretary 
Eugene Dewey to Ho Chi Minh City from the Central Highlands on 
Monday, August 18 (septels), ConGen HCMC learned of an altercation 
at an unrecognized \"illegal\" Protestant house church in the city\'s 
District 11.  According to reliable Protestant sources, police had 
raided a prayer meeting at the church earlier that morning and 
took nine Protestants to the police station.  Two pastors among 
the nine were held until late Tuesday evening, just prior to Mr. 
Dewey\'s departure.  The wife of one of the pastors was rushed to 
the hospital with heart problems after much wrangling with the 
police over whether she could leave.  She remained in the hospital 
as of 10:00 a.m. local time on Thursday, August 21.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) According to our long-time contacts, approximately 20 
members of the Full Gospel Assembly were gathered for a prayer 
meeting at a rented dwelling on Lac Long Quan Street in District 
11 on Monday morning.  Worshippers had been meeting at this 
unrecognized \"illegal\" house church for over a year and a half, 
with 30-40 members gathering for worship services every Sunday. 
Until this incident, the police had never interfered with church 
activities, although they were clearly aware of its presence. 
 
3. (SBU) During Monday\'s meeting, police reportedly raided the 
house and ordered the believers to disperse.  Taking advice by 
telephone from more experienced pastors, lay pastor Bui Van Ba 
asked the police to let the group complete their prayer meeting, 
after which he would work with the local authorities to resolve 
their concerns.  Meanwhile, these other pastors worked quickly to 
telephone their contacts in the city police department, local and 
national religious affairs agencies, and the Ministry of Public 
Security in Hanoi.  An officer on the city police force told one 
of them he had instructed the local district police to stand down. 
That order appears to have been ignored. 
 
4. (SBU) As the house confrontation grew more heated, Pastor Ba\'s 
wife, who suffers an unspecified heart ailment, fainted there. 
Thwarted by police in his attempts to get her to the hospital, 
Pastor Ba engaged in a physical altercation with the police.  By 
Pastor Ba\'s own account, he was \"forced\" to strike out at the 
police after they pushed him and blocked his exit.  He was then 
taken to the police station bleeding from a minor injury to his 
head, after which another pastor was finally allowed to take 
Pastor Ba\'s wife to the hospital.  Police also took eight other 
Protestants from the church to the local police station for 
questioning.  One was held at the station until Tuesday evening. 
Pastor Ba was moved to a local municipal jail at 83 Tan Hoa Street 
until his release at the same time. 
 
5. (SBU) A representative of the church was denied permission to 
visit the detainees on Tuesday morning, but was shown a document, 
which was purportedly a confession signed by Pastor Ba.  Members 
of the church have since shared  photographs taken after the 
incident, including some of Pastor Ba\'s wife in the hospital; what 
appear to be official orders from the district police ordering the 
pastor\'s temporary detention for beating a police officer and 
subsequent release under condition that he not leave his 
residence; several matching eyewitness reports; and a cassette 
which reportedly contains the audio of the entire confrontation. 
(Post Note: Poloff will listen to this cassette tonight.) 
 
6. (SBU) A/S Dewey asked his interlocutors to look into this 
incident during meetings with the HCMC Religious Affairs Committee 
and the External Relations Office (ERO - the local branch of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs).  While none of the local officials 
seemed aware of the case at the time, chairman of religious 
affairs Nguyen Ngoc San acknowledged that local officials 
sometimes violated religious freedoms due to \"lack of 
understanding\" of national policies on religion.  Mr. Dewey was 
able to receive a report from the ERO just as he finished up his 
last meeting of the trip.  According to the ERO report, local 
authorities said a district policeman on patrol had noticed a 
large gathering at the house \"late Monday night\" and was attacked 
by Pastor Ba while trying to investigate.  The police claimed they 
did not detain the pastor overnight.  They further claimed that no 
one else had been taken to the police station \"officially\", but 
said other members of the group \"may have accompanied\" the pastor 
there. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  According to our contacts, incidents like this 
are all the more remarkable because they happen so infrequently 
within the city limits.    While there is always the possibility 
that some elements within the Protestant community might have 
wished to exploit Mr. Dewey\'s visit here, the evidence in this 
case does not indicate that this was a deliberately provocative 
act on the part of the Full Gospel Church.  The rather 
unconvincing explanation provided by Vietnamese officials -- which 
might pass muster in the provinces -- rings hollow in HCMC. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment continued:  Asked for their views, our Protestant 
contacts were somewhat at a loss, expressing astonishment that 
something like this could happen in HCMC.  A few conjectured that 
the GVN might be testing the strength and resolve of local 
Protestants and the international community before undertaking 
similar repressive measures against other unregistered groups.  At 
this point, the incident seems to be an exception to the rule of 
GVN laissez-faire policy on religious worship in HCMC. 
Nonetheless, it is a troubling case and Post will continue to 
monitor religious practice in this, Vietnam\'s largest city. 
 
9.  (U)  A/S Dewey did not see this cable before his departure 
from post.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM: LOCAL BUSINESS KNOWS VALUE OF TRADEMARKS-- 
SEMINAR A SUCCESS 
 
 
1.  Summary:  In a seminar on trademark protection in the U.S. and 
Vietnam, USG and private speakers introduced the system of 
trademark registration and enforcement in the US.  Well over a 
hundred local businesspeople attended the seminar in Ho Chi Minh 
City, which was one of four locations around the country where the 
seminar was presented.  Based on their level of attention and 
rigorous questioning, these businesspeople understand the 
importance of trademarks.  Acting CG opened the seminar by 
reminding the audience of the importance the US places on IPR and 
urged Vietnam to adopt some of the US best practices in trademark 
registration and enforcement.  End Summary 
 
2.  On August 13, the USAID-funded Support for Trade Acceleration 
Project (STAR) in conjunction with the National Office of 
Industrial Property (NOIP) and the Ministry of Trade, sponsored a 
seminar on \"The Protection of Trademarks in the United States and 
Vietnam.\"  The seminar was conducted at the request of the GVN 
which wanted to educate Vietnamese business people on how to 
register a trademark in the US.  U.S. speakers included Ms. Lynne 
Beresford, Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy, 
and Barbara Kolsun, Senior VP and General Counsel for Kate Spade. 
Reflecting the importance of the topic, the seminar was opened by 
Vice Minister of Trade Le Dan Vinh followed by a keynote speech 
from the Deputy Director General of the NOIP.  Well over one 
hundred local businesspeople attended along with several local 
officials involved in IPR issues.  Local press covered the event 
in some detail and urged readers to check out the USPTO website. 
 
3.  Acting CG opened the seminar by stressing the priority the 
United States places on IPR.   She linked IPR to the future 
development of Vietnam\'s economy by reminding the audience that 
Vietnam\'s trading partners regard IPR as a high priority issue and 
one that can influence foreign investment.  She acknowledged that 
the GVN, with partners like the STAR Project, was working to 
improve laws and regulations related to IPR protection.  However, 
effective enforcement was still a major problem in Vietnam.  She 
encouraged Vietnamese businesses to register their trademarks in 
the U.S. and offered the U.S. system as a model Vietnam should 
consider in crafting its system of trademark protection. 
 
NOIP Notes Value of Trademarks 
------------------------------ 
4.  Mr. Tran Viet Hung, Deputy Director General of NOIP, urged 
Vietnamese companies to recognize the value of trademarks by using 
an iconic U.S. company as an example.  Mr. Hung told the audience 
that the Coca-Cola Company was valued at approximately 60-70 
billion dollars.  Yet what he called the \"real value\" of Coca- 
Cola\'s assets was only around 15 billion dollars.  Mr. Hung stated 
that the difference in these two numbers was the intangible value 
of the Coca-Cola Company, built up over the years and in large 
part represented by the value of its trademark.  He then discussed 
the devaluation of legitimate products by counterfeits through 
loss of consumer confidence and `erosion of enthusiasm\' among law- 
abiding companies.  Mr. Hung described Vietnam\'s system of 
trademark registration, but detailed mention of enforcement 
actions or procedures was noticeably absent.  One revelation from 
Mr. Hung\'s speech was that the GVN would begin publicizing 
trademark applications prior to issuing a decision in order to 
improve transparency and allow for comment from other parties. 
 
5.  According to Mr. Hung, many foreign companies have filed for 
trademark protection under Vietnamese law.  By his count Vietnam 
has issued almost 9,000 trademarks to foreign applicants. 
Conversely, he claimed that only 164 trademarks for Vietnamese 
products have been registered in the United States, with an 
estimated 54 additional Vietnamese trademarks registered in 
Europe, Asia, and the former Soviet Union.  He hoped that more 
Vietnamese companies would make the effort to register their 
trademarks overseas. 
 
U.S. Speakers Describe the U.S. System 
--------------------------------------- 
6.  Ms. Lynne Beresford, Deputy Commissioner for Trademark 
Examination Policy at the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office (USPTO), gave an overview of the U.S. legal system as it 
pertains to trademarks and provided a step-by-step description of 
the application process.  She noted that 16-18% of trademark 
applications filed in the U.S. originate from foreign entities. 
The USPTO representative also led the audience on a tour of 
www.uspto.gov and walked through the steps to file an electronic 
application. 
 
7.  Numerous questions from the audience indicated the level of 
interest in registering a trademark in the U.S.   Questioners 
wanted to know:  Was an applicant required to retain legal counsel 
or hire an agent in the U.S. prior to filing for a trademark?  Can 
foreign businesses file on-line?  Does the `confusingly similar\' 
doctrine apply to words in different languages; i.e. could an 
applicant register the trademark Home Depot provided they used 
Vietnamese words?  Could individuals file for trademarks?  Several 
additional questions requested a clarification of the filing fee 
cost structure and clarification of who was considered an attorney 
in the U.S. 
 
8.  Barbara Kolsun, Senior Vice President and General Counsel for 
Kate Spade provided a private industry perspective.  Ms. Kolsun 
detailed her experiences fighting trademark infringement at Kate 
Spade and previously as head of the Calvin Klein anti- 
counterfeiting program in North and South America.  Much of her 
presentation recounted enforcement options and tactics, including 
raids against counterfeiters and legal action in civil and 
criminal courts.  Questions directed to Ms. Kolsun covered the 
methods and value of trademark enforcement, namely, how U.S. firms 
prosecute trademark infringement occurring abroad and whether the 
time and money spent on enforcement was supported by any cost- 
benefit analysis. 
 
9.  Interestingly, audience members also asked questions about 
business responsibilities in the U.S. trademark regime.  One asked 
if subcontractors working for a trademark holder were responsible 
for trademark violations if goods were stolen from their 
facilities and sold on the street.  Another inquired about the 
responsibility of the retailer to verify the legitimacy and origin 
of products received from their suppliers.  While the seminar was 
intended to help Vietnamese companies register their trademark in 
the United States, these questions illustrate the ongoing climate 
of IPR insecurity in Vietnam. 
 
10.  Comment:   The high level of attendance and staying power of 
the participants indicate that there is a real interest in 
trademark issues in the local business community.  Unlike many 
seminars in which participants start drifting away after lunch, 
nearly all of the participants remained for the full day.  The 
event ran way over time and the hotel eventually ejected the 
seminar in order to set up the room for another function.  One 
hopes that this level of interest and the understanding that 
trademark protection is something of value to Vietnam businesses 
will eventually translate to better and more rigorous enforcement 
in Vietnam.  Post will continue to support efforts to raise 
awareness of the issue.

SUBJECT: A/S DEWEY PRESSES HO CHI MINH CITY LEADERSHIP ON 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
 
REF:  HCMC 0766 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  A/S Dewey raised issues of religious freedom 
during several official meetings in Ho Chi Minh City on August 19. 
Describing the GVN\'s record as uneven in the Central Highlands 
provinces he had visited, he registered disappointment that even 
in HCMC, there were sporadic reports of interference with worship 
and confiscation of religious materials.  He also expressed dismay 
over a recent police raid on an unregistered \"illegal\" church in 
HCMC\'s District 11 (reftel).  Despite that, A/S Dewey said he 
would return to the U.S. with a more balanced picture of the 
situation in Vietnam because of this visit.  Local officials 
responded with the standard GVN refrain -- that the GVN encourages 
religious freedom, but cannot accept those who would use religion 
to disrupt the national unity.  Mr. Dewey also mentioned, in 
general terms, his proposal to reopen processing in several 
categories of the old Orderly Departure Program.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Assistant Secretary Dewey visited HCMC on August 19, 
after three days in the Central Highlands (to be reported septel). 
He raised issues of religious freedom at meetings with the 
Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA), the External Relations 
Office (ERO - local branch of the Foreign Ministry), and the HCMC 
People\'s Committee.  He also stopped briefly at the headquarters 
and main church of the GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical Church 
of Vietnam (SECV), the umbrella organization for all legal 
Protestant churches in Vietnam\'s southern 31 provinces and HCMC. 
Describing lack of religious freedom as a factor that causes 
people to become refugees, A/S Dewey told his interlocutors that 
he was returning to the U.S. with a mixed view of the ability of 
people to practice their faith freely in Vietnam.  He praised what 
he considered to be positive efforts by the provincial 
administration in Lam Dong to register new Protestant churches, 
but noted the picture was less positive elsewhere.  He praised the 
GVN decision to recognize the SECV, and pointed to the opening of 
the SECV seminary this past February as another positive step. 
 
3. (SBU) During all three official meetings, A/S Dewey raised the 
case of an altercation at an unregistered \"illegal\" house church 
in District 11 of HCMC just the day before.  He said he found it 
difficult to understand how Vietnam could profess to allow freedom 
of religion when police acted in \"such a brutal fashion.\"  While 
he told his Vietnamese interlocutors that he had hoped to go back 
to Washington with the sense that the situation in HCMC was 
generally positive, he said he was not sure how to explain this 
latest incident.  He reminded CRA Chairman Nguyen Ngoc San that 
the \"whole world is watching,\" and hoped local officials 
understood the effect of their actions on international opinion. 
He appealed to Chairman San to gain the immediate release of the 
two pastors who were reportedly being detained and provide some 
explanation of the incident before he departed Vietnam later that 
evening.  Chairman San regretted that he had not heard anything 
about this development, but promised to investigate.  He noted 
that district officials were sometimes slow to report back to the 
city government.  Mr. San agreed it would be regrettable if the 
story were true, but he thought there might be more to the story. 
He returned to this incident unsolicited several times during the 
meeting and seemed genuinely concerned.  (Note:  Mr. San described 
himself as a religious person with an understanding of spiritual 
needs.  He took great pride in telling A/S Dewey that he even had 
an altar at home, although he never specified the religion.) 
 
4. (SBU) While Chairman San did contend that some religious 
believers violated the law by using freedom of religion to pursue 
political agendas, he also admitted that local officials at the 
grassroots level sometimes overstepped their bounds because they 
did not fully understand GVN policies.  He mentioned  two civil 
servants who had recently been disciplined for violating GVN 
policies toward religion, although he did not give any details. 
He said he had recently organized eight sessions with Protestant 
and Catholic clergy to teach local officials more about religious 
practices.  Mr. San was somewhat inconsistent, however, when he 
tried to describe the Catch-22 situation unregistered churches are 
in.  These house churches are generally left alone and allowed to 
operate \"as long as they do not do anything to disrupt national 
unity.\"  Yet their \"illegal\" status also means they can be shut 
down or have their property/belongings confiscated at any time, 
i.e. their \"religious freedom\" only lasts as long as they do not 
cross some arbitrary, invisible line.  Mr. San noted that the CRA 
was still awaiting the green light from Hanoi to register 
additional Protestant churches not affiliated with the SECV, but 
assured Mr. Dewey that those believers would be allowed to carry 
on their activities in the meantime.  He said the CRA welcomed the 
printing of Bibles by the SECV and only restricted importation of 
\"those books which incite instability.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Speaking more generally about what he described as the 
\"harmonious development\" of religious practices in HCMC, Mr. San 
gave statistics on growing numbers of believers and construction 
of new houses of worship.  He said there were two million 
religious believers of all faiths in the city -- one million 
Buddhists, 500,000 Catholics, 30,000 Protestants (worshipping at 
41 registered churches), and unspecified numbers of Hoa Hao, Cao 
Dai, Muslims, Hindus, and Bahai.  Reiterating that the policy of 
the GVN was to promote the development of religion in Vietnam, he 
added the refrain that Vietnam\'s long history of war has led it to 
value freedom and national unity.  Mr. Dewey agreed that it was 
acceptable to differentiate between religious believers and those 
with a political agenda, but stressed the need to close the gap 
between GVN official policy allowing believers to practice their 
religion and inconsistent implementation of that policy at the 
local level.  Making clear the USG strongly supported the 
territorial integrity of Vietnam, Mr. Dewey pointed out that 
religious diversity was actually part of America\'s strength. 
 
6. (SBU) Mr. Dewey\'s other meetings covered nearly the exact same 
ground, with all of his interlocutors seeking to demonstrate 
progress on religous freedom by citing the growth in numbers of 
worshippers.  All recited some variation of the same mantra that 
religious freedom is respected, but not for those with a political 
agenda.  ERO Director Le Quoc Hung added another wrinkle, by 
contrasting the importance of stability to attracting foreign 
investment with the fact that religion(s) was often associated 
with foreign invaders in Vietnam.  As did all of the GVN 
officials, Director Hung stressed there has been enormous progress 
in recent years, but that balancing religious freedom with 
security/stability concerns requires a \"step-by-step\" approach. 
 
7. (U) A/S Dewey did not clear on this message.

SUBJECT: COFFEE AND COCOA IN DAK LAK PROVINCE -- THE POT 
AIN\'T BUBBLING OVER 
 
1. (U)  Summary:  Hopes for economic prosperity in Vietnam\'s 
Dak Lak province remain centered on agriculture, especially 
cash crop coffee.  While low coffee prices have meant 
continued slow growth, they have also spawned 
diversification programs.  During a visit to the largest of 
the four Central Highlands provinces July 23-24, the 
Ambassador met with provincial authorities and private 
sector businessmen to gain their perspectives.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
Dak Lak: Growth Through Agriculture 
------------------------------------ 
 
2. (U)  Dak Lak People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang 
cited an overall economic growth rate of over seven percent 
(five percent in the agricultural sector) as proof of his 
province\'s economic success.  Dak Lak leads Vietnam in 
coffee production, grows 30 percent of the nation\'s corn, 
and produces 60 percent of its cotton.  Dak Lak also 
produces fertilizer and animal feed.  Provincial authorities 
have used a combination of central government funding and 
foreign aid for agricultural diversification and 
infrastructure improvement projects. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
Dak Lak Coffee Not Just For Weasels Anymore 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU)  DakMan, a joint venture owned 66 percent by London- 
based ED&F Man and 34 percent by Dalimexco, a Vietnamese 
state-owned enterprise, was one of the first joint-venture 
coffee companies to operate in the Central Highlands.  The 
factory was also one of the first to use an automated 
process to sort, grade, dry, and package the beans, 
according to Jonathan Clark, director of DakMan\'s Dak Lak 
operation.  The beans are untouched by human hands from the 
time they are put in the silo until the time they are 
packaged for shipping.  As with most exporters, DakMan does 
not roast its beans in Vietnam, but exports only green 
coffee. 
 
4. (SBU)  Mr. Clark thought the quality of coffee currently 
being produced was sufficient to satisfy demand.  The market 
does not offer enough of a premium to clean up the coffee 
beans, since the many small producers who process and sell 
to exporters can earn more selling bags of \"dirty\" coffee 
weighed down with sticks and twigs.  Given the low costs of 
production in Vietnam, Mr. Clark believes the average 
Vietnamese farmer earns a higher percentage on his coffee 
than do his peers in other countries. 
 
5. (SBU)  Like most processors in Dak Lak, DakMan processes 
only robusta coffee, not the more expensive arabica.  In 
southern Vietnam, only farmers in Lam Dong Province can grow 
true arabica coffee, which requires elevations above 750 
meters, and even Lam Dong grows very little.  (Post Note: 
The main arabica-producing regions are in northern Vietnam.) 
Most Vietnamese coffee marketed as arabica is actually a 
robusta-arabica hybrid called Catimor.  While Catimor is 
inferior to true arabica, the price of producing arabica in 
Vietnam is simply too high.  Sadly, Mr. Clark dispelled 
urban legends that high priced \"weasel\" coffee continues to 
be processed through the digestive system of its namesake 
animal, describing the use of chemical additives to produce 
the distinctive taste and aroma. 
 
6. (SBU)  DakMan purchases from suppliers throughout the 
province, with state-owned farms accounting for nearly 25 
percent of production.  Many of these farms are slowly 
privatizing.  While DakMan rejects about 7.5 percent of the 
coffee it purchases, the rejects are often repackaged and 
resold to DakMan or other exporters.  There is a proposal by 
the Dak Lak provincial government to create a centralized 
coffee-trading center, which Mr. Clark hopes will increase 
price transparency for buyers. 
 
7. (SBU) Mr. Clark believes Vietnam\'s coffee industry is 
fundamentally strong, and will rebound with the expected 
rise in coffee prices.  The current price slump would 
benefit Vietnam\'s coffee producers in the long run by 
driving out competition from less efficient growers, like 
those in Africa.  DakMan is the only coffee company in the 
province to hedge its risk with an active futures trading 
group (based in London).  Most major producers in Vietnam 
now had Reuters machines to track the coffee futures market, 
which opens at 4:20 p.m. local time.  DakMan\'s competitors 
use the spot close price from the previous day in contract 
negotiations. 
 
---------------- 
A Cocoa Revival? 
---------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Mr. Clark also mentioned that DakMan was partnering 
with the Vietnamese Agricultural Science Institute in a 
provincially funded US$5.1 million diversification project 
to promote cocoa production.  Farmers in the Central 
Highlands had pulled out their cocoa trees more than 20 
years ago when they could no longer find a market for their 
crop.  Now, Dak Lak should be ready to begin exporting cocoa 
again in about three years.  USDA and USAID, in conjunction 
with the American Cocoa Research Institute and the World 
Cocoa Foundation, have also started funding a project to 
test cocoa production in Dak Lak. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
Trung Nguyen Coffee: The Next Starbucks? 
---------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Administrative Chief Nguyen Van Thu showed off 
Trung Nguyen Coffee\'s impressive new headquarters building 
in Buon Me Thuot, the capital of Dak Lak Province.  Trung 
Nguyen LLC, still privately owned by the family who 
established the company in 1995, has attracted public 
attention as one of the country\'s most highly successful 
Vietnamese-run private enterprises.  Trung Nguyen\'s 
management has made no secret of its desire to become the 
Vietnamese equivalent of Starbucks. 
 
10. (SBU) Although turnover remains quite modest, Trung 
Nguyen now exports to nine countries worldwide -- Canada, 
Germany, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, China (including 
Hong Kong), Japan, Canada, and the USA.  The company applied 
to register its brand in the U.S. in May 2002, and Mr. Thu 
believes they are close to overcoming a trademark dispute 
with their U.S.-based importer, Ricefield Corp.  Trung 
Nguyen has already opened retail stores in Thailand and 
Japan, but Mr. Thu was interested in learning more about how 
to break into the U.S. market. 
 
11. (SBU) Currently the Vietnamese consume only one kilogram 
of coffee per person on an annual basis.  Yet while Vietnam 
remains primarily a tea drinking culture, coffee consumption 
is growing at 25-30 percent per year.  Trung Nguyen is 
aggressively franchising its name to target the domestic 
market.  The company charges a uniform, one-time initial 
franchise fee and requires the franchisee to serve only 
Trung Nguyen coffee.  While the earliest franchisees were 
not held to any particular design standards, plans call for 
future franchises to reinforce the brand image with a 
standardized look and feel. Trung Nguyen has thousands of 
shops nationwide, with 200 in Buon Me Thuot alone.  The 
company also owns an undisclosed number of cafes and shops 
directly. 
 
12. (SBU) Trung Nguyen purchases coffee from all four 
Central Highlands provinces and strives as much as possible 
to use either \"clean\" coffee grown with minimal application 
of chemicals, or organic coffee.  They have worked with the 
Vietnam Coffee Association to advise farmers on how to grow 
clean coffee.  While Trung Nguyen deals primarily in robusta 
coffee, Mr. Thu thought Vietnamese farmers were increasingly 
interested in growing higher-priced arabica beans, but 
agreed with DakMan\'s Clark that only parts of Lam Dong 
Province were suitable. 
 
---------------------- 
Honey Situation Sticky 
---------------------- 
 
13. (SBU) Dak Lak Department of Planning and Investment 
(DPI) Director Do The Thu dismissed reports from the 
Vietnamese press that Dak Lak honey was suffering from poor 
quality control and that the export market was down as a 
result.  He acknowledged, however, that high honey prices in 
2003 had led some smaller operations to mix honey with 
sugar, producing \"fake\" honey to make a quick profit. 
Provincial officials are publicly discouraging this 
practice.  He reported that 160,000 bee swarms had already 
produced 4,000 tons of honey in the first half of 2003. 
Most Dak Lak honey is produced for export. 
 
14. (SBU) Director Thu stressed that the Dak Lak beekeeper 
association would try to do more to control export quality, 
especially at the production level.  The province plans to 
purchase equipment for measuring honey quality, but such 
equipment is expensive.  The Ambassador suggested this might 
be an area where the U.S. could provide some assistance. 
 
------------------------------- 
Overseas Development Assistance 
------------------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) According to Dak Lak DPI, active foreign aid 
projects are funded by Denmark (Danida), the Asian 
Development Bank, the World Bank, Japan, Finland, and 
Germany.  Danida had sponsored a just completed US$19 
million clean water program, and was currently supporting a 
drainage system project and an administrative reform project 
for the civil service.  Germany provides advisors and credit 
for equipment imports for pilot projects in sustainable 
agricultural development and clean water.  The World Bank 
and Japan are both funding traffic management programs. 
Construction of a new hospital is slated to begin in 2004 as 
part of a larger ADB project for Central Highlands 
development.  The World Bank\'s rural electricity program had 
added four communes to the Dak Lak power grid and would 
satisfy remaining rural electrification demands by adding an 
additional 48 by the end of 2003.  Noting there were 
currently no U.S. aid projects in the province, and only 
sporadic activity by small U.S. based NGOs, the Ambassador 
offered to work with the Dak Lak to find ways to provide 
assistance. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16. (SBU) Dak Lak provincial authorities were not very 
responsive to the Ambassador\'s suggestions for direct U.S. 
aid projects, and offered few ideas for projects with 
American NGOs.  Referring to \"legitimate\" projects and 
organizations, provincial leaders implied U.S.-run efforts 
might be used for other purposes. Although Dak Lak officials 
have agreed to a USDA/USAID cocoa project (likely because of 
keen local interest and limited direct USG involvement) 
officials are still reluctant to agree to most forms of USG 
assistance.  Dak Lak continues to be one of the most 
xenophobic provinces in the country, with its authorities 
convinced that any foreign presence could be a cover for 
support of Montagnard political separatist activities. 
(Post Note: The Japanese Consulate General was denied 
permission by provincial authorities to visit a school that 
was being constructed with official development aid last 
year.  The Japanese have not tried to visit that project 
again.)  DakMan\'s Clark noted that the number of expatriates 
living in Dak Lak was down to around 20, about half of what 
it used to be. 
 
17. (SBU) Even with diversification efforts underway, Dak 
Lak\'s economy is still heavily dependent on coffee and 
coffee prices.  There are concerns that if Vietnam enters 
new markets like cocoa, in the same way it entered the 
coffee market, the dramatic increase in supply will cause 
prices to plummet.  In a further blow to the local economy, 
Dak Lak has closed its Buon Me Thuot airport temporarily. 
While the airport is scheduled to reopen in September 2003 
with a runway capable of supporting Airbus A320s, projects 
like this have a way of falling behind in Vietnam.

SUBJECT: MORMONS MAKE BID FOR A QUIET COMEBACK IN HCMC 
 
REF:  Hanoi 2153 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints (LDS) has recently taken steps to reestablish a \"branch\" in 
HCMC, pending approval of its June request to local government 
officials that Vietnamese members be allowed to meet regularly on 
Sundays.  While efforts to receive recognition from the central 
government have thus far failed, local LDS leaders hope that a 
patient, apolitical approach will eventually help them expand 
operations in Vietnam.  LDS representatives in HCMC have asked 
that this information be kept strictly confidential, citing past 
setbacks in neighboring countries when such information has been 
discussed openly in the State Department\'s Human Rights and 
Religious Freedom reports.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU)  Resident expatriate LDS leaders recently told ConGenoffs 
they had lodged a formal request with HCMC officials in June 
seeking permission to open a \"branch\" for Vietnamese members to 
meet on a limited basis.  (Note: A branch is the smallest possible 
unit of organization within the LDS.  Very few countries would 
have just a single branch.)  The LDS request carefully avoided 
mention of religious rituals, and LDS officials have said they 
would be satisfied to open a \"church,\" rather than a \"temple,\" 
despite the limits a lesser designation would place on performing 
the sacraments.  Ten Vietnamese members met Sunday, August 24 for 
the first time within the framework of the new \"branch\" structure. 
The branch is administered locally by a President and two 
Counselors -- one for expatriates and one for Vietnamese.  If the 
HCMC government response is favorable, LDS plans to facilitate 
funding from Salt Lake City to acquire a local meeting place. 
According to LDS, the number of LDS members in Hanoi is apparently 
insufficient to justify the same request at the national level. 
 
3. (SBU)  According to local LDS sources, the first post-war LDS 
branch was closed down in 1996, after authorities learned that 
volunteer LDS Charities English-language teachers were inviting 
students over to their homes (including some who were not among 
the cadre corps officially authorized to take lessons).  At the 
time, as many as 100 expatriates and Vietnamese routinely 
gathered together to attend worship services every Sunday.  The 
unauthorized house visit incidents also resulted in LDS Charities 
losing its NGO registration -- which has yet to be reinstated, 
despite repeated requests.  In the meantime, LDS has continued to 
send small numbers of service missionaries, generally as volunteer 
English teachers or medical workers.  The regional Mission 
President with responsibility for Vietnam has also continued to 
visit from a nearby country. 
 
4. (SBU)  A local LDS leader acknowledged that the number of 
members in Vietnam remains difficult to ascertain.  Some believers 
wanting to become members have traveled to Cambodia to be 
baptized, then returned to Vietnam.  Others who have attended LDS 
meetings and studied the religious doctrine remain officially 
outside of the LDS because they have not been baptized.  (Note: 
None of the LDS sacraments, including baptism, can be performed in 
Vietnam in the absence of a legally established organization.) 
Some undetermined number of members baptized before 1975 are also 
still active.  Expatriate members have always managed to meet 
without interruption, but current numbers may be as low as 20 in 
HCMC. 
 
5. (SBU)  LDS leaders have told ConGenoffs they believe \"trust 
building\" is the most productive approach for receiving official 
permission to conduct activities in Vietnam.  By carefully 
adhering to the parameters of whatever permission they receive 
from local officials, they hope to convince the GVN that they are 
not a threat to the country\'s political stability.  Over time, the 
LDS hopes this low-key approach will allow them to increase the 
scope of their activities.  Repeated requests for recognition 
since 1994 to the Committee for Religious Affairs in Hanoi have 
gone unanswered, according to these sources.  At one point, LDS 
was told that their application was being held for consideration 
in Hanoi, pending a more comprehensive review of the laws on 
religion. 
 
6. (SBU)  Comment:  One Vietnamese LDS member told ConGenoffs he 
had spoken to local police about a particular meeting location and 
been told the police had \"no problem\" with members meeting there. 
Whether that bodes well for official recognition or not is 
anybody\'s guess, as district and ward officials probably have no 
way to differentiate LDS from the myriad Protestant sects who 
worship openly but \"illegally\" here.  Whether this LDS group will 
continue to be able to meet if official permission is denied in 
the future, is a bigger question.  While there would appear to be 
fairly substantial contact between expatriate members and their 
Vietnamese converts -- despite GVN prohibitions specifically 
against LDS proselytization -- this should not be something we 
publicize in the current environment.

1.  (U) Summary:  In a visit to Kon Tum Province, PRM 
Assistant Secretary Dewey met with Provincial People\'s 
Committee Chairwoman Y Veng and with the province\'s 
Committee on Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs.  He also 
visited a village in Ia Sia commune where 15 UNHCR- 
repatriated ethnic minorities returned in 2002.  Ia Sia 
commune appears little changed from previous visits -- 
impoverished and the UNHCR-repatriated refugees still 
somewhat discontented and not completely integrated back 
into daily life.  Life in the village is hard for ethnic 
minority and Kinh alike.  Generally well-meaning GVN 
programs are under-funded, fall behind on implementation, 
and sometimes increase frustration.  The personal stories of 
discrimination told A/S Dewey by several returnees seem to 
be genuine, yet it is difficult to judge what part of their 
plight stems from systemic targeted mistreatment and what 
part is simply due to impoverished conditions in Ia Sia/Kon 
Tum as a whole.  The treatment of ethnic minorities -- and 
specifically their ability to worship freely -- depends on 
the personalities and attitudes of the local authorities, 
down to the very lowest level.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
\"MAY I CONTINUE NOW?\" 
---------------------- 
 
2.  (U) Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugee 
and Migration Affairs Gene Dewey traveled to Kon Tum 
Province in Vietnam\'s Central Highlands on August 16.  DCM, 
Acting CG HCMC, RRS Chief, and EAP/BCLTV officer Jess 
accompanied him.  The delegation met with the People\'s 
Committee chairwoman Y Veng, her first meeting with U.S. 
officials in at least 18 months.  (On six previous visits 
she had been in Hanoi as a National Assembly member or 
traveling outside Kon Tum.)  The scowling Madame Veng read 
carefully from ten pages of prepared remarks and looked 
vexed every time A/S Dewey interrupted to raise the 
treatment of ethnic minorities and freedom of religion or 
ask other questions.  After answering each question, she 
would look at A/S Dewey and ask, \"May I continue now?\" 
 
3.  (U) Ms. Y Veng described GVN programs geared toward 
improving living conditions for ethnic minority groups in 
Kon Tum.  She emphasized access to free or low cost health 
care and educational opportunities, including special ethnic 
minority boarding schools and subsidized tuition at regular 
schools.  She noted that there were 137,266 religious 
believers in Kon Tum of which 87,847 where from ethnic 
minorities.  The total believers included 100,021 Catholics 
(77,000 minority members), 26,561 Buddhists, and 10,337 
Protestants (10,228 minority).  She also said that there 
were 92 religious facilities, 13 churches, 1 big Catholic 
church (sic), 47 worship places, 50 pagodas, and 3 
monasteries.  She invited Mission staff to attend the 
installation of a new bishop, which would occur in late 
August.  Chairwoman Y Veng observed that the \"legal\" 
religious associations were making an important contribution 
to the province and its people. 
 
4.  (U) A/S Dewey asked about reports that some Protestant 
religious groups had been denied access to certain health 
and education benefits.  The Chairwoman replied a little 
defensively that Kon Tum province did not discriminate 
against Christians, but that limited resources precluded 
guaranteeing every potential student a place in the boarding 
schools.  When A/S Dewey asked about visiting a school, Ms. 
Y Veng said Dakglei District had an ethnic minority boarding 
school where there were some Christians attending.  A/S 
Dewey noted a firsthand visit would be important in further 
understanding conditions Kon Tum, and said that although his 
schedule was very tight this time, ConGenoffs would visit 
the school in the future. 
 
5.  (U) A/S Dewey noted that American NGOs and USAID were 
interested in providing assistance to the Central Highlands, 
possibly in the areas of child health and reproductive 
health.  The Chairwoman said \"these services are already 
available,\" but she would be happy to work with these 
organizations and greatly appreciated their offers. 
However, the central government makes all decisions on 
assistance programs, not provincial authorities.  She said 
she would get back to the Mission concerning the offer. 
 
6. (U) According to Chairwoman Y Veng, the GVN has a 
consistent policy of freedom of religion, and in general, 
any group or association recognized by the government can 
gather people together.  However, certain groups, such as 
the Dega movement, misuse religious groups for their own 
political purposes.  She asserted that the Dega movement had 
enticed people to cross the border into Cambodia.  A/S Dewey 
clarified that the USG does not support the Dega movement or 
any movement seeking autonomy.  The USG, however, does 
support religious freedoms, free speech, human rights, and 
economic development.  He urged GVN authorities to 
distinguish between the small minority abusing religious 
belief for political purposes and the much larger group of 
genuine worshipers. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
RELIGIOUS AFFAIRS CHIEF: PROTESTANTS BUT NO CHURCHES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7.  (U) Following the meeting with the provincial People\'s 
Committee, A/S Dewey met with the Committee on Ethnic 
Minority and Religious Affairs\' chairman, Mr. Ro Mo So Ra. 
Several of the same points concerning freedom of worship for 
non-political believers were discussed.  Mr. Ro said there 
are no recognized Protestant churches in Kon Tum province at 
this time (although Chairwoman Y Veng had previously stated 
there were approximately 10,000 Protestants in the 
province).  Mr. Ro subsequently indicated that indeed there 
were Protestants in Kon Tum, and that they indeed were 
worshipping in their homes or in non-recognized churches. 
He said local authorities generally turned a blind eye to 
their worship services as long as they stuck to religion and 
did not engage in illegal political activities.  As for the 
process of registering new churches, Mr. Ro emphasized that 
his committee\'s role is purely advisory.  Decision-making 
authority to register churches lies with the People\'s 
Committee.  A/S Dewey encouraged Mr. Ro to work for the 
recognition of legitimate congregations, who sincerely want 
to simply worship together, and to not treat such groups as 
a security or political threat. 
 
------------------------------ 
BOTTOM\'S UP - Y VENG\'S REVENGE 
------------------------------ 
 
8.  (U) Chairwoman Y Veng had graciously invited A/S Dewey 
and delegation for lunch.  In contrast to her rather cool 
reception during the formal meeting in her office earlier 
that day, Y Veng was considerably more relaxed, cordial and 
talkative.  She also taught several of those on the American 
delegation a thing or two about a tool of diplomacy 
frequently employed here: proposing a toast before virtually 
every bite of food.  She told A/S Dewey that her soldier 
husband laughed when she told him that drinking was part of 
her job. 
 
------------------------- 
VISIT TO RAT/RAC VILLAGE 
------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Following the lunch, A/S Dewey visited Rat (Rac) 
village, Ia Sia commune in Sa Thay district, near the 
Cambodian border.  The UNHCR has repatriated 15 refugees to 
this village since February 2002.  In a two-hour visit, A/S 
Dewey, the DCM and Acting Consul General fanned out to talk 
with various returnees.  The obvious presence of 
plainclothes police mixed in with the villagers may have 
inhibited their willingness to talk freely.  Still, several 
of them spoke out candidly about their lives and in some 
cases the problems they faced.  The villagers had just 
finished celebrating a local ethnic festival and consumed 
considerable alcohol in the process; this may have loosened 
tongues a bit.  (Post Note: Compared to 18 months ago, when 
the security forces videotaped each village encounter, the 
police presence was relatively lighter.) 
 
10.  (SBU) Sui Toi (20 years old) and Ro Cham Khuyen (23 
years old), both unmarried, are two Jarai ethnic minority 
men.  They said they had returned to Vietnam on February 19, 
2002.  UNHCR had advised them that the Vietnamese Government 
would provide land and a job to anyone who returned. 
However, when they arrived at the Gia Lai province border 
last year, local policemen \"beat (them) ruthlessly.\" 
Currently, they are living with their sisters\' families.  Ro 
Cham Khuyen whispered that he dared not \"tell everything\" to 
the visitors or he would have a \"big problem\" with local 
policemen when the delegation left.  He said that there are 
no schools for the children in Ia Sia village, there is no 
health clinic in or near the village, and Ia Sia had not yet 
been electrified.  (Post Note: While there is sometimes 
confusion between using the terms \"village\" and \"commune\" in 
the provinces, there definitely is an elementary school in 
Ia Sia commune, and its main road is electrified, though it 
is likely houses further back in the hills are not.  It is 
common practice for the poorer provinces to set up health 
clinics to serve several villages and/or communes from a 
central location.  Post does not wish to make light of Ro 
Cham Khuyen\'s claims, but they are inaccurate.  We also note 
that in previous discussions with residents of other Central 
Highlands villages, the concept of \"near\" has elicited 
responses ranging from approximately 60 feet to one mile. 
End note.) 
 
11. (SBU) Sui Toi indicated he was a Protestant, but said 
after his return to Vietnam he could no longer attend 
church, because any time he wanted to leave his village he 
had to obtain local police approval.  Some other villagers 
cautiously approached ConGenoff to hand over samples of 
police \"invitations\" to interviews.  One was an \"invitation\" 
from the district police chief (an ethnic Vietnamese Kinh) 
to come to the Sa Thay district police station \"to meet Mr. 
Dung of the security section.\"  Another was from the Ia Sia 
police chief (also an ethnic Vietnamese Kinh) asking the 
recipient to come to discuss some \"necessary matters.\"  One 
resident handed over a note showing he had been \"approved\" 
by a village policeman to visit his foster mother\'s home in 
another village to borrow money to buy a bicycle. 
 
12. (SBU) A ConGen FSN spoke briefly with a third returnee. 
This 24-year old ethnic minority man said he had returned in 
March 2002, but is jobless and has long since spent the 
VND500,000 (USD$33 - average per capita annual income in Kon 
Tum is about USD$205) that the UNHCR gave him for 
resettlement.  He claimed local policemen had beaten him 
when he returned to Vietnam.  He said he would be beaten 
again after the American delegation left, but \"the truth was 
always the truth and that if the authorities killed him he 
was happy to die in his homeland.\" 
 
13.  (SBU) A Rung Ho Lung, a 41-year old Jarai man, told A/S 
Dewey that one of the reasons he left for Cambodia was 
because his family was not allowed to worship in his village 
home.  ConGen Pol/Econ assistant then spoke with the 
chairman of the Ia Sia Commune People\'s Committee and the 
tribal chief of Rat/Rac Village.  The chairman said local 
authorities did not forbid Christian worship, but it was 
possible that the tribe itself did not approve of such 
practices.  The tribal chief responded that Christianity was 
not part of his tribe\'s cultural heritage.  A/S Dewey asked 
both the chairman and the tribal chief to allow believers to 
practice their faith, since they gather peacefully and not 
for any political purpose.  The chairman did not promise, 
but said it was really a tribal decision.  The tribal chief 
was reluctant to make a commitment. 
 
-------- 
COMMENT 
-------- 
 
14.  (SBU) As with previous visits to Ia Sia, the situation 
appears mixed.  While accurate information may exist in 
snapshots of the moment, consistently verifiable information 
is a completely different story.  Kon Tum province is very 
poor.  Many of its problems - depressed agricultural 
economy, unemployment, lack of arable land - affect 
everybody, including the Vietnamese Kinh.  Government 
programs, while well-meaning on paper, are under-funded in 
implementation, fall behind on their timetables, and 
increase frustration. 
 
15.  (SBU) In addition, the frequent attention paid to Rat 
village by American and other foreign visitors may have 
resulted in heightened local government sensitivities and 
tension in this village.  The personal stories told by the 
four returnees seem to be genuine, yet it is difficult to 
judge what part of their plight stems from systemic targeted 
mistreatment and what part is simply due to impoverished 
conditions in Ia Sia/Kon Tum as a whole.  On this visit, as 
with others, it is clear that the treatment of ethnic 
minorities -- and specifically their ability to worship 
freely -- depends on the personalities and attitudes of the 
local authorities, down to the very lowest level.  End 
comment. 
 
16. (U) A/S Dewey did not see this cable before departure.

SUBJECT: POTENTIAL P1 REFUGEES TO STAND TRIAL FOR ESPIONAGE 
ON SEPTEMBER 10 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Mrs. Nguyen Thi Hoa, Mr. Nguyen Truc 
Cuong and Mr. Nguyen Vu Viet -- the niece and nephews of 
jailed Catholic priest Father Nguyen Van Ly -- will go on 
trial in Ho Chi Minh City People\'s Court for \"espionage\" on 
September 10.  Under Article 80 of the Criminal Code, 
\"espionage\" is defined as \"collecting and distributing 
documents and information to foreign countries to be used 
against the Government of Vietnam.\"  Referrals on behalf of 
these three individuals for Vietnam\'s In-Country Priority 
One (P1) refugee-processing program have been filed at the 
Department.  The niece is currently under house arrest, 
while the two nephews are in jail.  Consular officer met 
with the niece and other immediate relatives on September 7. 
They expressed strong interest in the P1 program.  This case 
has attracted some Congressional interest, and is being 
closely monitored by ConGen and Embassy. End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On September 5, 2003, Post received via fax three 
Vietnamese Priority One Referral Forms for Mrs. Nguyen Thi 
Hoa (DOB:November 28, 1959), Mr. Nguyen Truc Cuong 
(DOB:November 1, 1967) and Mr. Nguyen Vu Viet (DOB:February 
24, 1975).  The referrals were submitted by Boat People 
S.O.S., at the request of Ms. Ngo Thi Hien, chairwoman of 
the U.S.-based Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam. 
Copies of these referral forms were faxed from Senator John 
McCain\'s office to the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi, and forwarded 
to ConGen HCMC the same day.  The three individuals are 
siblings, and are the niece and nephews of Father Nguyen Van 
Ly, a Catholic priest who was sentenced and imprisoned by 
the Vietnamese Government in 2002 for activities that \"have 
undermined the unity and stability of the nation.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Upon receiving the referrals and after consultation 
with the Embassy, the Consulate General informed the local 
office of the Foreign Ministry in HCMC (External Relations 
Office - ERO) that it intended to pursue the case.  A 
meeting was arranged for September 7, through an activist 
Protestant house church pastor, who is also the self- 
appointed legal representative of the family.   The family 
lives in Dong Nai Province, 25 kilometers northeast of Ho 
Chi Minh City.  In attendance at the meeting were the 
Consulate\'s Refugee Resettlement Section acting chief, Mrs. 
Nguyen Thi Hoa (niece and proposed beneficiary), Mrs. Nguyen 
Thuy Uyen (wife of one of the nephews and indirect 
beneficiary), various other family members, the self- 
appointed legal representative, and his interpreter.  The 
ConGenoff was able to conduct the four-hour meeting without 
interruption or hindrance by Vietnamese security or 
surveillance officers. 
 
4. (SBU) The niece and nephews were referred to the Vietnam 
P1 program by Dr. Nguyen Dinh Thang of Boat People S.O.S in 
Falls Church, VA, via Ms. Ngo Thi Hien of the U.S.-based 
Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam.  There is no 
date on the referral form. (Post Note:  Ms. Ngo Thi Hien is 
featured in the niece\'s story of what led to her original 
detention.) 
 
5. (SBU) Father Ly\'s niece and nephews have indicated their 
desire to apply for permanent resettlement in the United 
States:  Mrs. Nguyen Thi Hoa in direct conversation with 
ConGenoff on September 7, and Mr. Nguyen Vu Viet and Mr. 
Nguyen Truc Cuong (who are under arrest) through their next 
of kin - sister Nguyen Thi Hoa and Nguyen Thuy Uyen (wife of 
Cuong) -- on the same date.  The niece and nephews claim to 
have been subjected to harsh and/or discriminatory treatment 
within the past thirty-six (36) months.  They claim to have 
been targeted because of their religious activity and 
beliefs and for their actual and imputed political opinions. 
 
6. (SBU) Following is a summary of information gathered 
during the September 7 meeting and three subsequent phone 
conversations: 
 
A. Mrs. Nguyen Thi Hoa: 
 
Mrs. Hoa said she had been arrested in June 2001 for 
\"spying.\"  She also provided official Vietnamese documents 
that listed this charge.  She was detained from the time of 
her arrest until October 2001.  According to Mrs. Hoa, one 
day after her uncle Father Ly\'s arrest on May 17, 2001, 
Father Ly\'s mother (also Mrs. Hoa\'s grandmother) passed 
away.  A Ms. Doan Trang and Ms. Ngo Thi Hien in the U.S. 
sent a total of $2300, as financial support for visiting 
Father Ly (being held in detention in Hue) and building a 
tomb for his mother.  From that time on, Mrs. Hoa had 
numerous communications with both women -- Ms. Doan Trang, 
who apparently worked for a radio station in California, and 
Ms. Ngo Thi Hien from the U.S.-based Committee for Religious 
Freedom in Vietnam.  Both women inquired about the welfare 
of her priest uncle.   Mrs. Hoa advised ConGenoff that she 
had provided them information regarding Father Ly\'s 
situation.  She informed them that she had tried to visit 
Father Ly in Hue.  The Vietnamese Government had told her 
that she could not meet him in person, but she was permitted 
to leave extra food for him.  Mrs. Hoa stated that she 
herself had also initiated calls to the two women in 
California, to talk about Father Ly\'s situation during this 
one-month period. 
 
On June 18, 2001, police surrounded the homes of Mrs. Hoa, 
her brother Viet, and her mother, which are all adjacent to 
each other in Thong Nhat district, Dong Nai Province, to 
conduct a search.  After the house search, police arrested 
Mrs. Hoa and confiscated letters from overseas and documents 
downloaded from the Internet by her brother Viet regarding 
Father Ly\'s activities.   Mrs. Hoa was released from 
detention on October 25, 2001.  Upon her release, the police 
informed her that she would be kept under house arrest until 
her case was resolved.  Mrs. Hoa does not know what to 
expect at the trial.  She stated that the only time she has 
gone to Ho Chi Minh City in the last two years was when HCMC 
police were considering opening an investigation on her and 
she was summoned for questioning.  As late as July 2003, 
Mrs. Hoa was being charged with \"abuse of religious freedom 
to harm the government.\"  Mrs. Hoa stated that she had 
orally repeated elements of Father Ly\'s speeches to personal 
acquaintances, but had never disseminated written 
information. 
 
Mrs. Hoa, a widow with five years of grade school education, 
supports herself and her four children by running a small 
shop out of her home.  She said her business had suffered a 
great deal due to her \"status\", because many of her 
neighbors are afraid to associate with her. 
 
B.  Mr. Nguyen Truc Cuong: 
 
Mr. Cuong was arrested in Quang Ngai province sometime in 
June 2001, and subsequently was transferred to and remains 
in Chi Hoa prison.  He is a house painter who left high 
school before graduating.  A ConGenoff spoke with Mrs. 
Nguyen Thuy Uyen (DOB:May 12, 1974) who married Cuong in 
1995, at the home of Mr. Nguyen Van Dung, brother of her 
husband.  Mrs. Uyen stated that her family would like to be 
considered for the P1 program, and she made that commitment 
on behalf of her jailed husband. 
 
According to Mrs. Uyen, her husband disappeared in June 2001 
in Quang Ngai, on his way to Hue to try to visit Father Ly 
in jail. This was following a telephone request from Mrs. 
Doan Trang in the United States.  Mrs. Uyen knew her husband 
had been asked to do something by Ms. Doan Trang, but at the 
time was unclear exactly what.  (Post Note: Mrs. Uyen did 
not appear to realize that Ms. Doan Trang worked for a radio 
station.)  Mrs. Uyen later learned that Cuong was arrested 
after visiting and taking pictures of Patriarch Thich Huyen 
Quang (the leader of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam, who was under house arrest himself) at the request 
of Mrs. Doan Trang.  Although Mrs. Uyen and Mr. Dung, 
Cuong\'s brother, repeatedly tried to determine the 
whereabouts of Cuong, she was not able to see him until 
October 2001 at the B34 Camp in HCMC.  After Mr. Cuong\'s 
initial arrest in Quang Ngai, he was first transferred to a 
detention facility in HCMC and finally to Chi Hoa prison, 
also in HCMC.  He is allowed two visits from his wife every 
month while awaiting trial.  According to Mrs. Uyen, Cuong 
has been charged with \"espionage,\" among other crimes. 
 
Mrs. Uyen told ConGenoff that she and Cuong have a seven- 
year-old son.  She supports herself, her son, and her 
husband by doing seamstress work from her house.  She said 
that her customers are afraid to come to her shop because 
the police question them if they do so.  Mrs. Uyen did say 
that she herself had not been questioned by the police, nor 
were there any restrictions on her movements.  She and her 
husband left high school before graduating. 
 
C.  Mr. Nguyen Vu Viet: 
 
Viet was arrested on June 18, 2001, in Phu Nhuan district, 
Ho Chi Minh City, and remains in prison.  According to the 
family, Viet is a graduate of HCMC\'s Open University and has 
a degree in English.  He worked for the \"Tourist Department\" 
in Ho Chi Minh City where he was responsible of organizing 
overseas tours for Vietnamese.  He is also accused of 
\"espionage,\" according to his brother Mr. Dung and Mrs. Hoa. 
 
Mrs. Hoa also informed ConGenoff that Mrs. Ngo Thi Hien 
contacted Viet from the U.S. and asked him questions 
regarding the circumstances of Father Ly\'s arrest and his 
mother\'s funeral prior to his arrest.  Mrs. Hoa stated that 
her brother Viet often brought home printouts that he had 
downloaded from the Internet regarding Father Ly and his 
activities for family members to read.  She was not sure, 
however, whether brother Viet ever disseminated information 
over the Internet since he lived alone.  Mr. Viet is single, 
so our information about him has come from relatives. 
 
7. (SBU) Post Note: Our most important consideration at this 
point is the welfare of the three accused and their 
families.  We do not want to put them in any (further) 
jeopardy.  In fact, ConGenoffs had to dissuade the 
Protestant pastor cum self-appointed legal representative 
from posting photos on the Internet \"to generate publicity 
for this case and the American Consulate.\"  Post further had 
to remind him that he should not represent himself as \"an 
agent of the Consulate\", nor his activities as being on our 
behalf.  Since neither the niece, nephews, nor anybody in 
their families currently has a passport or exit permit, even 
with a P1 approval, it would be virtually impossible for 
them to leave Vietnam under this program without some form 
of cooperation from the Vietnamese Government.  Mission has 
received inquiries from Senator McCain\'s and Senator Frank 
Lautenberg\'s offices.

1.  (SBU) Summary:  PRM Assistant Secretary Dewey visited 
Gia Lai Province in the Central Highlands on August 16-17. 
His meeting with Provincial People\'s Committee Chairman Ha 
was cordial, with a frank exchange of ideas on treatment of 
ethnic minorities and freedom of worship.  Ha said that at 
least five more Protestant churches would receive approval 
to operate before the end of the year.  Mr. Dewey also 
attended a \"registered\" Protestant church service in Pleiku 
on Sunday morning, which provided a dramatic example of the 
strength of legally authorized Protestant worship in the 
province.  Discussions with the pastor, however, revealed 
that much of the Protestant community in Gia Lai is still 
unrecognized and underground. 
 
2.  (SBU) Driving through Gia Lai province, A/S Dewey made 
unscheduled stops at two ethnic minority villages, which 
demonstrated the unevenness in economic development and 
religious freedom in the province.  Clearly, the GVN is 
making a better effort to improve local infrastructure and 
the lives of local ethnic group inhabitants.  It also seemed 
apparent that the practice of Christianity, both Catholicism 
and legally recognized Protestantism, is occurring, often 
relatively unhindered.  At the same time, there were 
troubling signs that those who worship at unregistered 
Protestant churches are continuing to face harassment and 
that quite a few Protestants believe they experience 
discrimination in accessing social services and education. 
End summary.

the Central Highlands on August 16-17.  The DCM, Acting CG 
HCMC, RRS Chief HCMC, and EAP/BCLTV officer Charles Jess 
accompanied him on the trip.  He began with a meeting with 
Provincial People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Vi Ha.  In his 
hour-long discussion with Mr. Dewey, he came across as 
cordial, outgoing, and candid (although in previous 
encounters with the Ambassador and Consul General, he 
exhibited varying degrees of hostility and openness).  Mr. 
Dewey focused the exchange on ethnic minority returnees from 
Cambodia and freedom of worship in the province. 
 
4.  (U) Mr. Ha made many of the now-familiar points 
concerning preferential government policies for ethnic 
minorities (reported in previous HCMC and Hanoi cables).  As 
examples, he named provision of basic household supplies, 
access to low-cost health and education facilities.  Ha 
admitted that some ethnic minority people had fled to 
Cambodia because they felt they experienced religious 
repression or because of poor conditions in their villages. 
He observed that decades of war in Vietnam had made it 
difficult for the GVN to care for its people as well as 
other governments cared for their citizens.  He stressed, 
however, his \"firm belief\" that \"overseas outside forces\" 
had enticed most of them, promising money and a better life 
in another country.  Ha asserted that the \"activities of 
such anti-government and anti-revolution groups caused 
confusion\" among the villagers.  Indeed, according to Ha, 
many individuals who had been resettled overseas now sent 
messages back home saying they were not making lots of money 
and could better understand the difficulties of living 
overseas.  Ha said that these outside forces were primarily 
organized under the banned Dega movement, the activities of 
which were considered a threat to Vietnam. 
 
5.  (U) In reply, A/S Dewey stressed that the USG does not 
support the Dega movement and recognizes the territorial 
integrity of Vietnam.  He noted that the USG sees two 
totally different categories of people -- a relatively small 
group of Dega political activists who might attempt to 
misuse religious belief for political gain, and a much 
larger group of genuinely sincere, non-political Protestant 
worshipers.  He sought Mr. Ha\'s assurance that GVN 
authorities, too, recognized this difference and would treat 
the devout worshipers more fairly.  Mr. Ha responded that 
they recognized the distinction and in fact the province 
would register five more Protestant churches in the near 
future.  A/S Dewey said this was welcome news, which would 
hopefully relieve some pressure on ethnic minorities.  Mr. 
Dewey also expressed the hope that there might also be 
opportunities for the USG, NGOs and other aid groups to help 
improve conditions in Gia Lai Province.  Mr. Ha said that he 
would welcome such humanitarian assistance as long as it was 
offered unconditionally and did not harm Vietnam\'s security. 
Areas of possible assistance would be medical supplies for 
two provincial hospitals and vocational training for ethnic 
minority groups. 
 
6.  (U) During the dinner that followed, Mr. Ha was self- 
assured, well-spoken and personable, although mostly hewing 
to standard GVN positions.  From his point of view, 
Vietnamese have a right to leave their country and seek a 
better life if they want to, but they should leave legally. 
Mr. Ha claimed that he knew of 60-70 cases where immigrant 
visa applicants had been interviewed by the ConGen, sold 
their property, quit their jobs, etc. but had still not 
received their visas from the USG.  In reply, A/S Dewey 
provided Chairman Ha with a ConGen list of 32 pending 
refugee resettlement cases from Gia Lai province.  These 
cases cannot proceed to final processing because the 
applicants have not received passports and exit permits from 
Gia Lai authorities.  Mr. Dewey expressed the hope that both 
governments could work to eliminate such obstacles and 
delays in the immigration visa and refugee resettlement 
processes. 
 
------------------------------------ 
SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE IN PLEIKU CITY 
------------------------------------ 
 
7.  (SBU) On Sunday morning August 17, A/S Dewey attended a 
Protestant church service at Pleiku Roh Church in Pleiku 
City, the provincial capital.  The pastor, Mr. Siu Y Kim 
(protect), had met Mr. Dewey in Ho Chi Minh City the 
previous Friday evening.  Pastor Kim is one of only five 
recognized Protestant ministers in Gia Lai. 
 
8.  (SBU) When Mr. Dewey arrived at the house church, there 
was no apparent sign of the church or a service in progress, 
even though this is one of the few \"registered\" churches in 
the province.  But after being led around back and up a 
flight of stairs, he discovered a congregation of over 150 
worshipers, mostly from the Jarai ethnic minority, filling a 
small hall and flowing out the balcony in the back, with a 
choir in mid-song.  Mr. Dewey and his group stayed for the 
remainder of the two-hour service, conducted in Vietnamese 
and Jarai.  In the hymns and prayers, the congregation 
demonstrated a fervor of belief all the more striking for 
the relatively difficult conditions under which they gather. 
Pastor Kim gave a sermon inveighing against overindulgence 
in alcohol and stressing that Protestants want to preserve 
Jarai culture, although not to the extent of worshiping 
traditional gods in place of the Christian God.  (Post Note: 
Some officials in Pleiku claim that Protestant ministers are 
speaking out against Jarai culture and even advocating 
burning down traditional places of worship.) 
 
9.  (SBU) In his sermon, Pastor Kim also mentioned he had 
received a call that morning from an \"unrecognized\" house 
church 20 kilometers away in Plei Klan village.  Police had 
raided this church and arrested several individuals.  Pastor 
Kim asked his congregation to pray for them.  The 
juxtaposition of Pastor Kim\'s \"registered\" service in 
progress, with prayers for an \"unregistered\" house church, 
was a reminder of the inconsistent application of freedom of 
worship in Gia Lai province. 
 
10.  (SBU) Following the service, A/S Dewey and Pastor Kim 
(protect) spoke again about conditions for Protestants in 
Gia Lai.  Mr. Kim claimed there are over 100,000 believers 
in the province, but the GVN recognizes only five of 400 
house churches - including the one visited.  Before 1975, 
according to him, there were 34 Protestant churches (formal 
church buildings) in Gia Lai; now there are none. 
Government publishing companies do not print Bibles in the 
Jarai dialect, but Pastor Kim said with support from 
overseas Vietnamese, Jarai Protestants have run off at least 
10,000 photocopies of pre-1975 Jarai-language versions. 
(Post Note: As a follow-up, the ConGen learned that as soon 
as the American delegation left, five policemen present 
during the service questioned the pastor as to why the 
foreigners were there and what they had asked.  However, no 
threats were made.  End note.)  In a conversation with the 
DCM, one of the other church members said while the 
congregation felt relatively safe, secure and un-harassed 
while worshipping within the church compound, members 
experienced \"discrimination\" as soon as they left the 
compound. 
 
------------------------------------ 
UNSCHEDULED VILLAGE STOPS IN GIA LAI 
------------------------------------ 
 
11.  (U) After departing the house church, A/S Dewey drove 
nine hours from Pleiku to Lam Dong province through parts of 
Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces.  While passing through rural 
southern Gia Lai province en route to Dak Lak, A/S Dewey 
made a couple of unscheduled stops at ethnic minority 
villages chosen at random in Chu Se district (Gia Lai).  The 
first stop was at Plei Phung village, Ia Phang commune, Chu 
Se district.  (Post Note: As the ConGen vehicles turned off 
the main highway to enter the village, a man on a motorbike 
stopped the delegation.  Likely the local security cadre, he 
said foreigners were not allowed to visit ethnic minority 
villages unless they had permission from the commune 
People\'s Committee.  A/S Dewey expressed his disappointment 
to our External Relations Office and Gia Lai People\'s 
Committee escorts.  After some discussion, the People\'s 
Committee escort called Chairman Ha, who approved this visit 
to the village.  End Note.) 
 
12.  (U) Plei Phung village, about 60 km south of Pleiku 
city, is home to about 50 families.  On the dirt road 
leading to Plei Phung, which is off the national highway, we 
saw a school and holes for electricity poles.  The villagers 
pointed to them as indications of government efforts to 
improve their lives.  Our group split into two to walk 
around the village. 
 
13.  (SBU) A/S Dewey spoke with a Jarai man in his mid- 
thirties with two children - one in the elementary school 
and the other a toddler.  The villager said his family made 
its living by growing rice as a main crop, in addition to 
pepper, cotton and corn.  Cotton and corn are his cash 
crops, while he keeps the rice to feed the family.  He was 
unhappy with his current circumstances and asked Mr. Dewey 
for assistance.  He said that living standards in Plei Phung 
village are low.  There is no electricity (yet) or running 
water.  Several families share a well.  The villager said if 
his children got sick, he would take them to a nearby clinic 
or to the district hospital.  Doctors/nurses do not make 
house calls.  He is Catholic, and his family usually goes to 
a church at the commune center six kilometers away, as there 
is no church in Plei Phung.  He had no complaints about 
freedom of religious worship. 
 
14.  (SBU) Leaving Plei Phung village, A/S Dewey stopped at 
Kenh San village, eight km from Plei Phung.  This village 
belongs to Ia Le commune, Chu Se district.  Another 
\"watcher\" on motorbike stopped delegation vehicles at the 
village gate, saying there were sick animals in the village 
that might affect our health.  Still, he allowed us to enter 
the village after a ConGen FSN explained that we were 
accompanied by provincial People\'s Committee officials and 
that we had just been permitted to visit a neighboring 
village. 
 
15.  (SBU) Kenh San village appeared to be more bustling and 
economically sound.  It is active and wealthier than Plei 
Phung.  There were street venders, small grocery stores and 
coffee shops lining the hard dirt main road.  Kenh San was 
recently electrified, but villagers still use well water. 
Villagers said they go to a nearby clinic or hospitals at 
the district center or in Pleiku.  A/S Dewey stopped at a 
large house where children had gathered to watch television. 
The homeowner was happy to talk with our group members.  A 
Jarai man in his sixties, he said that many residents in the 
village are Catholics, who attend church at the commune 
center every Sunday.  Believers go by motorcycles or 
together in small trucks.  He said he had no problems 
practicing his faith.  Regarding the local economy, he said 
the villagers work in the fields, growing rice, black 
pepper, corn, and sweet potatoes.  They also raise chicken 
and pigs.  Village lands are \"far away in the forest\", so 
the village owns an elephant.  Villagers take turns keeping 
the elephant and using it to transport their harvested 
crops.  Traders come to the village to buy the villagers\' 
products.  In brief conversations with other residents of 
Kenh San, most did not complain about religious freedom 
issues.  One young man, however, indicated that some of the 
Protestants felt they were discriminated against in 
obtaining access to certain advanced medical or educational 
facilities. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
16.  (SBU) For the most part, provincial and local officials 
treated A/S Dewey and his delegation cordially and with less 
suspicion than they had exhibited on some Embassy and ConGen 
visits to the Central Highlands in recent years.  There were 
fewer obvious security officials in tow and those who did 
accompany the delegation generally did not obstruct its 
activities.  Officials also showed some flexibility in 
handling the delegation\'s sudden requests to deviate from 
the pre-arranged itinerary in order to visit randomly-chosen 
villages along the way.  Visits by the Ambassador and 
frequent visits by ConGen HCMC over the past two years have 
broken through some of the barriers to discussions on human 
rights and religious freedom, but we should not kid 
ourselves.  There will be no overnight philosophical 
epiphany here.  Change in the Central Highlands - so removed 
from easy transportation and communication links - will be 
gradual and closely tied to economic development and 
education. 
 
17.  (SBU) As was the case with previous USG visitors, the 
delegation witnessed a mixed picture on religious freedoms 
and treatment of ethnic minorities.  Clearly, the GVN is 
making a concerted effort to improve local infrastructure 
and the lives of local ethnic group inhabitants.  It was 
also apparent that the practice of Christianity, both 
Catholicism and \"legal\" Protestantism, occurs relatively 
freely.  There are plans to approve more registered 
churches.  At the same time, there were troubling signs that 
those who worship at unregistered Protestant churches do 
face harassment and that a number of Protestants believe 
they are discriminated against when it comes to accessing 
social services and education. 
 
18.  (SBU) Although there were fewer GVN \"minders\" than on 
previous trips, they were present and tried to monitor 
conversations that the delegation had with villagers. 
Despite these minders, some brave and outspoken villagers 
discussed discrimination and harassment by local officials 
with us. 
 
19.  (U) People\'s Committee Chairman Ha has told previous 
visitors that he would welcome \"unconditional\" U.S. 
assistance in his province, but subsequent Mission attempts 
to follow up were unsuccessful.  Nonetheless, Mission will 
again explore the possibility of undertaking humanitarian or 
development projects. 
 
20.  (U) A/S Dewey did not have a chance to review this 
cable before his departure.

SUBJECT: UNLICENSED PROTESTANT HOUSE CHURCH REPORTEDLY TORN DOWN 
 
REF:  A.  HCMC 0520  B.  HCMC 0551 
 
1.  (SBU)  In what looks to be a replay of recent events 
surrounding an illegally constructed house church in District 11 
of HCMC (reftels), Post has received information regarding the 
possible destruction of a small Seventh Day Adventist house church 
at No.42 Binh Loi, Binh Khanh, Can Gio District, HCMC.  On 
September 25, the Consul General received, via Post\'s PAS public 
mailbox, a copy of an email letter addressed to the Ambassador 
describing the destruction of a small prayer house in one of the 
poorest and most remote districts in the city.  The letter was 
signed by Viet Si, the Vice President of Public Relations for 
Vietnamese Catholic Conscience of San Jose, CA.  The letter was 
accompanied by email photographs purporting to show the church 
before and after its dstruction. 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to Post\'s quick, informal translation of a 
follow up \"report\" filed by Mennonite Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang of 
the Legal Committee of the General Association of Protestants, 40 
policemen in military vehicles and fire trucks, wielding \"arms, 
anesthetic sprays, electric rods and steel sticks\" raided the 
property on September 23, at 9:00 a.m. local time.  The police 
used hammers and levers to tear down the house.  One policeman 
alledgedly was overheard to say: \"This house itself is not worth 
being destroyed.  The only fault is that it has a Cross inside.\" 
The report goes on to describe how a Protestant named Madam Nam 
donated a parcel of her own land last year on which the group 
built a prayer house without a permit.  On August 12 of this year, 
the Binh Khanh Commune People\'s Committee levied a fine and 
ordered the illegal structure removed.  On September 9, commune 
officials visited the property to reiterate the order to pull down 
the structure.  This visit had been the last official contact 
until the police raid. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Pastor Quang\'s report notes that a small group of 
Seventh Day Adventists first started worshipping in a home in Binh 
Khanh in 1996.  Police harassment, including arrests, beatings, 
forced renunciations, orders to disperse, and denial of 
applications for Hunger Eradication and Poverty Alleviation loans, 
allegedly forced the group to move seven times over the 
intervening years.  From more than 100 members at the 
congregation\'s peak, many followers stopped practicing their 
religion publicly over the years because they could not stand the 
discrimination and harassment, much less the frequent moving, 
according to Pastor Quang.  Fewer than 40 members remained at the 
time of the raid.  The report describes the congregation as 
\"poorly educated and mostly illiterate.\" 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment:  Post has seen Pastor Quang become increasingly 
more confrontational and provocative within the religious 
community over the past 6-8 months.  He has also established close 
ties with some Catholic groups as the \"unofficial legal 
representative\" for the niece and nephews of imprisoned Catholic 
Priest, Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly.  Given the similarity between this 
case and the case described in reftels, Post sees the issue of 
unlicensed construction once again being used as part of a larger 
media campaign. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Comment (cont.):  Clearly, much of the \"report\" seems 
to have been prepared for an international audience, as when 
Pastor Quang writes:  \"With the reason \'illegal construction,\' the 
government pulled down the prayer house of poor Protestants. This 
is such a cunning and subtle trick \'using law to destroy 
Protestantism.\'  However, the current legal regulations stand on 
the side of the Protestants.\"  Pastor Quang then proceeds to list 
a number of circulars and decrees on the issue of construction 
licenses in HCMC before noting that, \"All these legal documents 
prove that the act of pulling down and smashing the Binh Khanh 
house in Can gio is illegal and inhuman.  We can measure the 
physical loss of this destruction, but how can we count the 
damages and injuries caused to the trust in the government?  We 
can build another more beautiful and bigger house, but it is not 
easy to recover the prestige of Vietnam among the international 
community.\" 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment (cont.): Post will follow up with local 
officials, but expects the government\'s argument to focus squarely 
on its right to enforce building/land usage/construction permit 
regulations after giving alleged violators adequate notice, rather 
than religious freedom.  End comment. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Post Note:  Pastor Quang\'s report ends with a list of 
proposals.  Post has included them here for the Department\'s 
information because they are likely to be repeated in other 
sources in the coming days and weeks.  End note. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Proposals: 
 
A. If you are an individual, a juridical person, a politician, a 
government or organization which has a relationship with Vietnam 
and loves Vietnam, take the following actions: 
a. organize meetings to discuss religious freedom in Vietnam with 
the presence of 3 groups: 
1. representatives of victims of religious freedom violations in 
Vietnam 
2. representatives of the government who make these violations 
3. representatives of UN Human Rights, governments, international 
organizations, associations, Embassies, Consulates, the 15 members 
of the UN Security Council, local and international media. 
b. set up a committee to verify religious freedom violations in 
Vietnam, consisting of: 
1. international law specialists 
2. human rights lawyers 
3. legal specialists of Embassies, of the 15 members of the UN 
Security Council, and of other interested countries 
4. independent Christian lawyers, \"abused\" religions 
There must be two chairmen of this committee: one from the UN, the 
other from one of the \"abused\" religions of Vietnam. 
 
B. If you are a leader of the government or Communist Party who 
wants to make Vietnam a country of democracy, equality, 
civilization, and prosperity and wants Vietnam to catch up with 
the world powers, please listen to your people, respect our 
proposals so that we can clarify cases of religious persecution in 
which we have been the victims, and of which the world has accused 
Vietnam. 
When you have the evidence: 
1. Immediately stop religious persecution that has been carried 
out for years, without regard to whether it\'s the policy from the 
local or central government. 
2. Apologize to religions and the Vietnamese people.  This is a 
chance for the government to show its determination to respect UN 
conventions that Vietnam has signed. 
3. Examine and bring to court as per Article 129 of the Criminal 
Code those who led and implemented religious violations and 
dismiss them. 
4. Announce all arrested Vietnamese citizens who have raised their 
voice on human rights violations in Vietnam not guilty and 
immediately release them, such as Father Nguyen Van Ly and his 
niece and nephews. 
5. Give license to religious associations which have been in 
Vietnam for more than 10 years to operate, with guidance on 
applications within 10 days.  Recognize religious communities no 
matter how big or small.  They should have the right to set up 
their own places of worship, like a person has the right to build 
his own home. 
 
C. If you belong to an \"abused\" religion: 
1. Provide us with evidence, cooperate with us, provide financial 
support for investigations.  Contribute so as to stop the 
religious persecution in Vietnam. 
2. Be courageous, support and protect us in the struggle for 
religious freedom and the purity of Vietnam to create trust and 
support from the whole world in the process of modernizing our 
beloved country.

SUBJECT: UBCV LEADERS MEET DESPITE GVN INTERFERENCE 
 
 
1.  (SBU)  Leaders of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam (UBCV) met September 18-20 in Binh Dinh Province, 
according to UBCV Deputy Thich Quang Do, despite some overt GVN 
efforts to prevent the meeting from taking place.  This is the 
first time the UBCV leadership has been able to gather together 
since the release from pagoda detention of UBCV Patriarch Thich 
Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do himself earlier this year.  The 
meeting, which focused largely on personnel issues and strategies 
for seeking government recognition, took place at Nguyen Thieu 
Pagoda in Quy Nhon City, the current home of Thich Huyen Quang. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do told ConGen the GVN had tried to prevent 
some of the monks from reaching Quy Nhon, succeeding in at least 
one case.  He, UBCV General Secretary Thich Tue Sy, and others had 
been able to travel from HCMC on September 15 without difficulty. 
Others in their traveling party had been approached by the 
authorities a few days before the trip and told not to associate 
with the UBCV or take any leadership role in the organization. 
These monks still chose to go to Quy Nhon, however, and linked up 
with Thich Quang Do unimpeded. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The GVN had unpredictable luck in trying to prevent 
other UBCV leaders from traveling, according to the UBCV Deputy. 
A contingent of five monks, including Thich Thien Hanh, were 
driving through the rugged Hai Van Pass from Hue when their driver 
received a call on his mobile phone telling him that his wife was 
in labor.  The five monks managed to hitch a ride the rest of the 
way in a truck while their own driver returned to Hue.  Thich Hai 
Tang of Quang Tri Province did not fare so well, however.  Police 
twice prevented him from boarding vans for Binh Dinh, then 
escorted him back to his pagoda in a police car and kept him there 
until the meeting ended. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do also noted that Nguyen Thieu Pagoda was 
surrounded by local religious affairs officials and police 
throughout the meeting.  While the authorities never entered the 
actual meeting room at any time, he believed their searches of the 
pagoda before the meeting were merely clumsy attempts to plant 
listening devices.  Despite these problems, Thich Quang Do readily 
acknowledged that no one had attempted to interfere with the 
proceedings once the meeting had begun.  He promised to provide a 
more detailed readout of the discussions in a future meeting with 
ConGenoffs.  He also thanked the ConGen for its concern over his 
recent successful medical procedure to open a blocked artery. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Thich Quang Do expressed concern that the GVN seemed to 
be taking a step backward from the open-minded attitude displayed 
by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai during his meeting with Thich 
Huyen Quang in Hanoi earlier this year.  As further evidence, 
Thich Quang Do noted that a small delegation from the HCMC 
Committee on Religious Affairs had visited him on September 11 
(Mid-Autumn Day) to remind him that the UBCV still had no legal 
status. 
 
6.  (SBU)  In a separate conversation prior to the meeting in Quy 
Nhon, Thich Quang Do had told ConGen he regretted sending a letter 
criticizing the GVN for allegedly kidnapping former UBCV monk 
Thich Tri Luc from Cambodia (where he had gained UNHCR refugee 
status) last year and holding him secretly in detention until now. 
Blaming the mistake on poor internal UBCV communication and long 
periods of detention, he said he had not known that Thich Tri Luc 
had \"secularized\" in 1997.  Under the circumstances, Thich Quang 
Do said he did not plan to press the issue any further with the 
GVN.  But neither does he plan to retract his previous erroneous 
letter.  Thich Quang Do did provide ConGen with a copy of the 
invitation the former monk\'s family had received from the HCMC 
People\'s Court inviting them to attend his trial.  While the trial 
has been postponed indefinitely, Thich Quang Do promised to notify 
ConGen if the family received any additional communications from 
the court. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Comment:  Thich Quang Do and Thich Tue Sy were much 
more sanguine in their characterization of events than the flurry 
of press releases from the UBCV\'s Paris-based International 
Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB) citing systematic 
interrogations and threats of reprisals.  Instructive, perhaps, 
was Thich Tue Sy\'s recent comment to ConGen that the IBIB often 
publishes things which are \"incorrect.\"

SUBJECT: THE SEA-MY SIDE OF THE SEA GAMES: HCMC CRACKS DOWN ON 
STREET PEOPLE 
 
1.  (SBU) Effective September 30, 2003, Ho Chi Minh City 
authorities will round up and classify all street persons living 
and working in public places around the city as part of a new 
program run by the HCMC Committee on Population, Family, and 
Children.  Street children picked up under the program will be 
sent to state-run social care centers or orphanages, or returned 
to their home provinces.  The program, which is similar to one 
announced for Hanoi, is part of a nationwide GVN effort to crack 
down on street people, beggars, and hustlers, all justified in the 
name of the upcoming Southeast Asia Games (SEA Games).  Local 
street persons, however, appear largely unconcerned about the law 
or its effect on their lives. 
 
2.  (U) Local newspapers announced the passage of Decision 
104/2003/QD-UB \"on the management of street people who live by 
begging in public places\" in mid-September, to take effect on 
September 30.  According to Tuoi Tre (\"Youth\") newspaper, the 
program is intended to protect tourists and visitors attending 
December\'s SEA Games events from being hassled by beggars.  The 
GVN has allocated 4.3 billion VND (approximately US$275,000) to 
the plan, including re-settlement assistance and community 
advocacy programs.  By the end of November 2003, the National 
Committee on Population Family and Children plans to have moved 
100% of \"begging and rubbish-collecting children\" to social care 
centers and orphanages, and to have assisted in the voluntary 
return home of 70% of children who sell lottery tickets or 
postcards or who shine shoes. 
 
3.  (U) In November 2003, the program will also include an EU- 
funded 6.8 million Euro project to assist street children returned 
home in 36 districts.   The children will receive funding for 
school and vocational training and receive job placement 
assistance.  The project will also give no-interest loans to their 
families for household business development.   The Ministry of 
Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) has also submitted a 
34 billion VND/year proposal to eliminate child beggars and 
rubbish collectors by 2006. 
 
4.  (SBU) MOLISA\'s Survey on Street Children in Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City, July-August 2003, reported that Vietnam has over 21,000 
street children, mostly between 11-15, earning an average of 
15,000-30,000 VND/day ($1-2/day).  The majority have not finished 
school, and 8% have never attended school.  54% of street children 
go home to families in the evening.  A source at DOLISA (HCMC\'s 
MOLISA) indicated that street children who have a stable home, go 
to school, and who do not work too many hours may be allowed to 
continue their jobs. 
 
5.  (SBU) On September 23, 2003, Poloff interviewed affected 
street people in the main tourist district of HCMC.  A 13-year-old 
boy selling lottery tickets and a 17-year-old shoeshine boy had 
both heard about the new regulations from local newspapers.  The 
shoeshine boy also holds down a construction job three days each 
week, and has all the legal paperwork for the job.  He did not 
expect trouble from the local authorities because of his other job 
and he expected to be able to continue his shoeshine work without 
interference.  The lottery boy, however, was worried about whether 
he and his mother, who sells newspapers on a nearby street, would 
be able to continue working.  He had yet to be approached by local 
authorities, but he has never been to school, so he falls in the 
main target group.  He believes he would be able to run fast 
enough to avoid the police should they try to take him away. 
 
6.  (SBU) An elderly woman who sells lottery tickets from a wooden 
chair also expressed concerns about her livelihood.  She reported 
that harassment had increased in the past few weeks and that she 
had to move her chair several times a day.  She expects to have to 
stop working during the SEA Games because she is \"old and cannot 
not run very fast\" o escape from the police.  After the SEA Games 
ended, however, she believes that she would be able to sell again. 
 
7.  (SBU) Ms. Ha (protect), a 14-year-old girl selling postcards 
in a major tourist square, had just been released from a social 
care center.  (Note: Ms. Ha is well-known to the ConGen and has 
also appeared in tourist videos about Vietnam.)  She had been 
picked up by police in July and placed in the SOS \"orphanage\" for 
three months.  Her mother was able to secure her release after 
only 45 days, by paying a 3 million VND \"fee\" (approximately 
US$200).  Ms. Ha described the orphanage as something akin to a 
juvenile detention center, with bars on the windows, severely 
restricted movement, and regular beatings.  She claimed to eat 
better on the street than in the orphanage.  She has been selling 
postcards for 11 years, both with her mother and independently, 
and speaks near-perfect English.  She attends school for two hours 
each morning to learn \"mathematics and history.\" 
 
8.  (SBU) Ms. Ha echoed earlier sentiments that she would \"just 
outrun\" the police.  She reported that the police had started 
using plainclothes officers in the area, but that \"everyone knows\" 
who they were.  Since her detention, Ms. Ha has refused to let 
ethnic Vietnamese take her picture, claiming \"they\" were using 
pictures to \"make up stories.\"  She still allows Westerners to 
take her photograph.  Ms. Ha expressed no desire to change her 
lifestyle, saying that she liked the freedom and variety, and 
never wanted to go back to an orphanage again. 
 
9.  (SBU) COMMENT: This is not the first program NPFCC has 
proposed to address the problem of street children.  Local press 
reported an almost identical proposal in April 2003, without the 
SEA Games linkage.  That earlier measure, however, did not appear 
to get government support or funding until after it could be tied 
to the issue of \"protecting tourists.\"  Under the circumstances, 
this would appear to be an effort to advance a pre-existing agenda 
under cover of this major sporting event.  DOLISA was originally 
willing to discuss this program, but later cancelled, saying they 
could not discuss things further without going through the local 
branch of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and having other 
representatives present at the meeting.

SUBJECT: POLICE DISRUPT TRAVEL OF UBCV LEADERS TO HCMC 
 
REF:  HCMC 942 
 
1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  Police apparently stopped United Buddhist 
Church of Vietnam (UBCV) leaders Thich Huyen Quang, Thich Quang Do 
and Thich Tue Sy from leaving Binh Dinh Province to drive to Ho 
Chi Minh City on October 8 (local time).  Although various reports 
differed on details, there was general agreement that a crowd of 
40-60 police and others surrounded the monks in their van shortly 
after they left the pagoda where Thich Huyen Quang resides.  The 
incident occurred in the context of reports of increased tension 
following a meeting of leaders of the banned UBCV (Reftel). 
Charge raised the issue with the MFA in Hanoi and stressed the 
importance of immediately allowing the monks to continue their 
travel unimpeded.  ConGen also contacted the HCMC External 
Relations Office and later reached the Chairman of Binh Dinh 
Province.  The Chairman said when he learned of the situation he 
had said to just let them go.  He said the monks had already been 
allowed to leave, and as of 5:00 p.m. local time, ConGen was able 
to confirm with Thich Tue Sy that the monks had been allowed to 
depart around 4:00 p.m.  Thich Tue Sy said everybody -- including 
\"the elders\" -- were \"fine.\"  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  According to a press release from the Paris-based 
International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB), UBCV leaders 
Thich Huyen Quang, Thich Quang Do and Thich Tue Sy were prevented 
from leaving Binh Dinh Province to drive to Ho Chi Minh City on 
October 8 local time.  Thich Quang Do and Thich Tue Sy had 
traveled to Binh Dinh to attend a UBCV meeting September 18-20, 
where UBCV leaders discussed personnel issues and strategies for 
seeking government recognition for their banned religious 
organization.  Local UBCV contacts confirmed to ConGen that the 
three religious leaders were among a group of UBCV monks that left 
Nguyen Thieu Pagoda together in a van early in the morning on 
October 8.  Shortly after leaving the pagoda, where Thich Huyen 
Quang currently resides, the van was surrounded by a large group 
of police, reported as 40 by one source and 60 by another.  (Post 
Note: We have no way of verifying these numbers.) 
 
3.  (SBU)  At about 3:30 pm, ConGen reached the Chairman of the 
Binh Dinh People\'s Committee on his mobile phone.  The Chairman 
blamed Thich Huyen Quang\'s own followers for the situation, saying 
they wanted him to stay in Binh Dinh to translate Buddhist books 
and train more nuns and monks --assistance he had offered at the 
opening ceremony of his home pagoda\'s Basic Buddhism School.  The 
Chairman claimed the followers were only trying to prevent Thich 
Huyen Quang from leaving, not the other two monks.  The Chairman 
said when he learned of the incident, he stated that \"if he (Thich 
Huyen Quang) wants to go, just let him go\" and that the monks had 
already been allowed to continue their journey to HCMC.  At 5:00 
pm, ConGen confirmed directly with the monks that they had been 
allowed to leave around 4:00 pm.  (Note:  The Chairman\'s claim 
that the van had been delayed by UBCV followers contradicts press 
reports and IBIB press releases describing a large crowd of police 
and others throwing stones and puncturing the tires of the monks\' 
van.  The details of what happened in Binh Dinh are not yet fully 
clear and these reports are still unconfirmed.  In the past, Thich 
Quang Do and Thich Huyen Quang have recounted stories of large 
adoring crowds surrounding them, but the Chairman\'s interpretation 
seems to take this one step too far.  End note.) 
 
4.  (SBU)  UBCV contacts reported that police had originally told 
Thich Quang Do and Thich Tue Sy their \"registration\" for visiting 
Binh Dinh had expired and they should return to HCMC.  Thich Huyen 
Quang decided to travel with them in order to consult a doctor.  A 
UBCV contact in Hue told us separately that the situation has been 
very tense since UBCV religious leaders returned from the 
September 18-20 UBCV meeting at the Nguyen Thieu Pagoda.  One 
contact indicated that even as he and ConGenoff were speaking, 
there were two policemen at his pagoda waiting for him to 
accompany them for more \"educatio.\"  oks who had attended the 
meeting and later returned to six different pagodas in Hue had 
been called in by the police for \"education\" for the past several 
days, and their pagodas were being closely watched.  (Post Note: 
We have come across this practice in other situations.  Even our 
local Foreign Ministry counterparts who have traveled or studied 
overseas can be required to attend re-conditioning classes for up 
to a year.) 
 
5.  (SBU)  ConGen had contacted Deputy Director of the External 
Relations Office, Mr. Le Hung Quoc, early in the afternoon.  He 
said he had not heard anything about the situation, but would 
inform the ConGen if he were able to get any additional 
information.  While he had no specific knowledge about why the 
police would prevent the monks from going to HCMC, Mr. Quoc noted 
that the UBCV was a banned organization and their September 
meeting had been illegal.  ConGen stressed the importance of 
providing accurate information and resolving the issue quickly, as 
there could be no justification for holding UBCV leaders for 
attending a peaceful meeting. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Separately on October 8, the Charge in Hanoi raised the 
issue with Acting Director of the Americas Department Mr. Nguyen 
Van Que.  The Charge drew Mr. Que\'s attention to Thich Huyen 
Quang\'s meeting with the Prime Minister and the right of the UBCV 
monks to travel freely.  He pointed out that an incident like 
this, if true, would inevitably further damage the GVN\'s 
reputation on human rights and religious freedoms, was an 
unwelcome development at any time - but particularly now when 
senior GVN leaders were in the U.S. - and could harm the bilateral 
relationship.  He also urged Mr. Que to investigate this 
information quickly and, if true, immediately allow the monks to 
continue their travel unimpeded.  He asked Mr. Que to let him know 
the results of the investigation as soon as possible.  Mr. Que 
thanked the Charge for the information (which he had not heard) 
and said he would look into it. 
 
7.  (SBU)  Around 5:00 pm, Thich Tue Sy contacted the ConGen and 
confirmed that the monks had been allowed to depart about an hour 
earlier.  Thich Tue Sy said everybody -- including \"the elders\" -- 
were \"fine.\"  The Mission made representations at several 
different levels of government.  It is not clear who made the 
decisions either to stop the monks or eventually allow them to 
proceed.  It was evident in the phone call with the Chairman of 
Binh Dinh that he quickly made the connection between public 
image, international reputation and letting the monks go on their 
way.

MONKS WHEREABOUTS 
 
REF:  A)  HCMC 978; B) HCMC 942 
 
1.  (SBU)  ConGen has confirmed that UBCV leaders Thich Huyen 
Quang, Thich Quang Do and Thich Tue Sy were detained by police on 
October 9 in Khanh Hoa Province about 10 km north of the 
provincial capital Nha Trang.  They had left Thich Huyen Quang\'s 
pagoda in Binh Dinh Province to travel to HCMC the morning of 
October 8, but were surrounded by police and prevented from 
continuing their journey until 4:00 p.m. (Ref A).  They had then 
spent the night in a pagoda in Khanh Hoa and resumed their trip 
early on October 9, but were again stopped by police and taken 
from their van about an hour later.  ConGen understands that at 
least Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do have since been 
released and returned by the police on October 10 to their 
respective pagodas in Binh Dinh Province and HCMC. 
 
2.  (SBU)  ConGen received a report that Vien Dinh, a monk from 
Giac Hoa Pagoda in HCMC who had been traveling with the UBCV 
leaders, had been driven to HCMC from Khanh Hoa by police after 
the monks were taken from their van.  He was held at a police 
station in Binh Thanh district of HCMC from 6 pm until midnight on 
October 9.  He was released and returned to his pagoda by the 
police, but two other policemen came to get him about fifteen 
minutes later and the pagoda has not heard from him since.  Vien 
Dinh had told monks at his pagoda he understood that the Khanh Hoa 
police planned to return the various monks in the van with the 
UBCV leaders back to their home districts (this could mean either 
to their pagodas or to police stations in those districts). 
 
3.  (SBU)  ConGen met with Deputy Director of the Office of 
External Relations in HCMC Le Hung Quoc.  He claimed that the 
monks had originally been stopped on October 8 by local traffic 
police in Binh Dinh for an unspecified traffic violation, and the 
police had then \"accidentally\" discovered the monks were carrying 
papers that appeared to contain \"state secrets.\"  Local 
authorities detained the monks so that they could clarify the 
situation.  Quoc said he \"thought\" the monks had admitted that 
they were carrying \"state secrets.\"  He further said \"competent 
authorities\" were now assessing the situation.  He said the 
outcome of the assessment would depend largely on the attitude of 
the monks. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Deputy Director Quoc said that he could confirm Thich 
Huyen Quang was in his pagoda in Binh Dinh Province and Thich 
Quang Do was in HCMC.  He thought that Thich Quang Do was at his 
pagoda and not in police custody.  (Note:  ConGenOff visited Thich 
Quang Do\'s pagoda mid-morning October 10 and was turned away by 
what appeared to be a large plainclothes security contingent. 
ConGenOff was told that the pagoda was closed for renovations and 
that no one was inside.  There was evidence of construction that 
had clearly been underway for some time.  Separately, the French 
CG said ERO had told him not to try to visit Thich Quang Do, since 
the CG \"would be turned away and that would be embarrassing.\"  End 
Note.) 
 
5.  (SBU)  Quoc was not sure about the other monks, although as 
far as he knew they had all been returned to their home pagodas 
and none of them were in detention.  Quoc said he would try to 
clarify this with local authorities.  He later noted that police 
might call in the monks for questioning as part of their 
investigation into the suspect documents.  Responding to a 
specific question, he said no one had been charged with a crime 
yet, but they could still be charged depending on what \"competent 
authorities\" finally decided about their documents. 
 
6.  (SBU)  Asked what sort of \"state secrets\" the monks could be 
carrying, Quoc said the UBCV was a banned group and it would be 
illegal if they had papers that concerned efforts to (re)- 
establish the UBCV.  If they want to establish a new religion, he 
said, they would need to go \"step-by-step\" according to the law. 
Referring to the unfortunate timing of this incident given the 
heavy schedule of upcoming bilateral visits between the U.S. and 
Vietnam, Quoc noted a pattern of provocative acts prior to 
important visits between the two countries, which he attributed to 
people who \"don\'t like the government and wait for opportunities 
to create problems.\" 
 
7.  (SBU)  Throughout the discussion, DPO stressed the seriousness 
of the situation, the importance of protecting human rights and 
religious freedom, and the need for timely, full and accurate 
information.  She called attention to the international interest 
in the UBCV leaders and the harm that would be done to Vietnam\'s 
reputation if it failed to meet its international commitments. 
Answering a reference by Quoc to the \"difficult\" pre-1975 UBCV 
role, she noted that the outside world would not find it credible 
that the elderly UBCV leaders, one over eighty and the other over 
seventy, posed a threat to state security because they held a 
meeting to discuss the future of UBCV relations with the GVN. 
Responding to another comment by Quoc, she cautioned that it was 
not possible to separate Vietnam\'s interest in integrating into 
the world marketplace from its record on human rights and 
religious freedom. 
 
8.  (SBU)  Quoc said he understood this was a serious issue and 
that accurate information was essential.  He said that both the 
U.S. and Vietnam had a responsibility to give a full picture of 
the situation in Vietnam.  He added that Vietnam upholds the right 
of individuals to practice their religion, but this had to be done 
\"within the law.\"  He noted that Vietnam was a Buddhist country 
and said there were thousands of monks practicing their religion 
freely.  He took the point, however, that failure to uphold 
religious freedom could damage Vietnam\'s relationship with the 
U.S.  He also agreed that cutting off phones and making it 
impossible for the UBCV monks to communicate with their followers 
was not helpful.

CONFIRMS ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0942   B) HCMC 0993   C) HCMC 0978 
 
1.  (SBU)  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) General 
Secretary Thich Tue Sy told ConGen today that he has been placed 
 
SIPDIS 
under a two-year administrative detention, effective October 11. 
He confirmed that Thich Nguyen Ly and Thich Thanh Huyen -- two 
other UBCV monks riding in the van with the three top-ranking UBCV 
leaders when they were returning to HCMC on October 8, after an 
\"illegal\" UBCV meeting in Binh Dinh Province (ref A) -- had been 
placed under similar restrictions.  The administrative order was 
signed by Ho Chi Minh City People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Nguyen 
Thanh Tai, who holds the portfolio for social welfare, religion, 
culture, and education.  Thich Tue Sy said he did not understand 
the exact conditions of his detention or whether he would be 
permitted to leave the Gia Lam Pagoda grounds. 
 
2.  (SBU)  Updating ConGen from his conversations with other monks 
today over what he presumed to be monitored lines, Thich Tue Sy 
said that security officials had prevented several UBCV monks from 
entering Thanh Minh Zen pagoda to ascertain the welfare and 
whereabouts of UBCV Deputy Thich Quang Do (ref B).  He confirmed 
that Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang was back at Nguyen Thieu Pagoda 
in Binh Dinh Province.  He said security officials were preventing 
people from entering or leaving the pagoda -- while the monks were 
refusing to allow the police inside the grounds.  The authorities 
have apparently spared Thich Vien Dinh (on whose behalf the ConGen 
and Embassy have received inquiries from individuals who claim to 
be family members in the U.S.) formal administrative detention, 
but have told him orally that he must request permission to leave 
his pagoda. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Thich Tue Sy recounted how the van containing the UBCV 
leadership had been stopped in Khanh Hoa Province on the morning 
of October 9, before he was transported to Go Vap District police 
station in HCMC later that evening (ref C).  On the afternoon of 
October 11, after nearly two days of questioning, he said that he 
and Thich Thanh Huyen (also in the van on the trip from Binh Dinh 
Province) were brought to a school near Gia Lam Pagoda to meet 
with approximately 20 district officials, including the chairmen 
of the People\'s Committee, the Committee for Religious Affairs, 
and the Fatherland Front, respectively.  The district People\'s 
Committee Chairman read the administrative detention order, which 
accused the two monks of organizing a UBCV assembly in the U.S. in 
1999, corresponding with EU ambassadors in Hanoi regarding the 
UBCV, meeting with EU ambassadors while in Hanoi to visit Thich 
Huyen Quang in April 2003, and organizing the \"illegal\" meeting at 
Nguyen Thieu Pagoda this past September (para. 1).  Thich Tue Sy 
and Thich Thanh Huyen were \"sentenced\" to administrative detention 
under the now-familiar security grounds of \"abusing democracy to 
cause harm to the State.\" 
 
4.  (SBU)  Post notes that when Thich Quang Do\'s administrative 
detention order was lifted this past June, the order was signed by 
the district People\'s Committee.  We are unsure if there is any 
significance to the fact that Thich Tue Sy\'s detention order was 
signed by the HCMC People\'s Committee, though even Thich Tue Sy -- 
who has much longer experience with this sort of situation than 
Post does -- cannot understand how HCMC can accuse him of crimes 
he allegedly committed that would have taken place outside its 
local jurisdiction.

SUBJECT: LEGAL PROTESTANTS HOLD UNAUTHORIZED MEETING: WANT 
PROPERTIES BACK 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0993  B) HCMC 1000 
 
1.  (SBU) In violation of their own GVN-approved charter, 
approximately 400 legal pastors and another 400 \"lay volunteers\" 
of the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) met in Ho Chi 
Minh City September 10-11.  While the 2001 charter allows for only 
one conference every four years, the leadership did not want to 
wait until 2005.  Several members of the SECV Executive Board met 
recently with Pol JO to recount the proceedings of this first ever 
\"General Congregational Meeting.\"  They said the primary focus of 
the meeting was the training of church workers and future goals. 
Major outcomes included a plan to petition the GVN for the return 
of 214 confiscated church properties and to open a new training 
center in HCMC.  The SECV is the only legal, GVN-recognized 
Protestant church for all of southern Vietnam. 
 
2.  (SBU) The SECV leaders told Pol JO they had submitted an 
official request to the GVN in August seeking the return of 214 
pre-1975 church properties in HCMC and the 32 provinces from Quang 
Tri south to Ca Mau.  Over the years, the GVN had destroyed some 
of the structures and converted others to \"public\" uses.  Three 
HCMC properties of specific interest named were:  7 Tran Cao Van, 
the former \"national\" Protestant church and now a cultural center; 
2bis Le Duan (across the street from the Consulate General), now a 
karaoke bar; and Dong Tam in Go Vap District, now closed.  The 
SECV leaders said they hoped to restore 7 Tran Cao Van to its 
former status as their primary church.  (The current \"main\" SECV 
church in HCMC is co-located with the offices of the SECV on Tran 
Hung Dao Street.) 
 
3.  (SBU) The SECV Board also mentioned plans to submit a formal 
request within the next month to break ground on a new bible 
college in HCMC\'s District 2 by January 2004.  Current facilities, 
attached to their offices on Tran Hung Dao Street, were simply 
inadequate for their training needs.  The Board asked the 
Consulate General to raise this issue with local authorities after 
the SECV had submitted its official proposal.  Linked to this 
proposal were plans to request GVN permission for more pastors to 
travel overseas for study, especially those seeking advanced 
training and degrees.  The SECV leaders told Pol JO they had 
already been in contact with several seminaries in the U.S. 
(Note:  Post has already seen a dramatic increase in the number of 
both SECV and house church pastors traveling to the U.S. over the 
past year.  End note.) 
 
4.  (SBU) One of the SECV leaders also asked the Consulate General 
to raise the issue of foreigner-only worship services with the GVN 
at an appropriate opportunity.  According to this pastor, local 
authorities had broken up a prayer meeting at the Furama Resort 
Hotel near Danang about six months ago, telling the exclusively 
foreign congregation that such services were illegal.  While the 
Danang SECV leadership had later submitted a request to establish 
a foreigner-only religious service at an area hotel, local 
authorities had yet to act on the request.  (Note:  Foreigner-only 
hotel services exist in both HCMC and Hanoi.  End Note.) 
 
5.  (SBU) Comment:  As has often been the case in the past, the 
SECV Board members were somewhat reluctant to address most issues 
in any detail -- especially those involving difficulties with the 
GVN.  While the SECV leadership does not seem to have suffered any 
repercussions from this unauthorized meeting, at least as of four 
weeks after the fact, it will be interesting to see how the GVN 
reacts in light of the restrictions placed on leaders of the 
banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam after their own meeting 
(reftels).  Perhaps the absence of any dire consequences indicates 
the value of legal recognition in the eyes of the GVN.  Whatever 
the outcome, the SECV\'s plans continue to reflect their primary 
focus on building up their church step-by-step and a willingness 
to try to work through official channels, but also to step outside 
the bounds when they see it as necessary to achieving their goals. 
Protestant groups in Vietnam that have not joined the SECV often 
complain that its leadership is unwilling to take risks.  The SECV 
decision to hold an \"illegal\" conference without first getting 
permission, as well as their highly publicized letter to the GVN 
last year protesting religious repression in the Central 
Highlands, suggests that is too simple.

today that Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) Patriarch 
Thich Huyen Quang is in good condition at his pagoda, although he 
is being closely watched.  While neither he nor UBCV Deputy Thich 
Quang Do are under written orders of administrative detention, 
they are nevertheless being \"detained\" and closely guarded at 
their pagodas in Binh Dinh Province and Ho Chi Minh City 
respectively. 
 
2.  (SBU) Speaking with ConGen over a landline from his Gia Lam 
Pagoda in HCMC\'s Go Vap District, UBCV General Secretary Thich Tue 
Sy said he had been able to reach Thich Huyen Quang earlier in the 
day.  No one had been in contact with Thich Quang Do, however, and 
the doors of his Thanh Minh Zen Pagoda in Phu Nhuan District 
remained locked shut.  Thich Tue Sy had also learned more about 
his own status since yesterday (ref A), noting that he now needed 
to request official permission for any travel outside the ward 
where Gia Lam is located.  He believed he was free to receive 
visitors under the terms of his written administrative detention 
order.  (Post note:  Poloff will test that hypothesis over the 
next day or two.)  He sounded very relaxed and confident over the 
telephone, saying, \"monks aren\'t afraid.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Providing additional information on the recent \"illegal\" 
meeting of the UBCV leadership in Binh Dinh and subsequent events, 
Thich Tue Sy noted that Thich Huyen Quang was now officially the 
4th Patriarch of the UBCV.  (The three prior patriarchs were all 
based in Hue and are now deceased.)  Thich Quang Do now holds the 
position of President of the Institute for Dissemination of the 
Dharma, with Thich Tue Sy as Vice President.  The three monks were 
\"elected\" to these positions at the recent general conference in 
Melbourne, according to Thich Tue Sy, but the decisions were made 
in Binh Dinh. 
 
4. (SBU) After the initial incident during which they were 
prevented from leaving Binh Dinh for over eight hours on October 8 
(ref B), Thich Tue Sy, Thich Huyen Quang, and Thich Quang Do had 
all proceeded in a van toward HCMC.  They were accompanied by 
Thich Thanh Huyen (also from Gia Lam Pagoda), Thich Nguyen Ly 
(from Tu Hieu Pagoda in HCMC\'s District 8), Thich Vien Dinh (from 
Giac Hoa Pagoda in HCMC\'s Binh Thanh District), Thich Nguyen Vuong 
(the assistant of Thich Tue Sy), two assistants of Thich Huyen 
Quang, and two lay believers from Tu Hieu Pagoda.  The group 
stayed at the Linh Son Pagoda in Khanh Hoa Province for the night 
and was stopped by police near Nha Trang the next morning.  Thich 
Tue Sy said that he and Thich Thanh Huyen were taken back to HCMC 
by police on October 11, at 4:45 p.m.  Thich Nguyen Vuong had not 
joined the group leaving Linh Son Pagoda and was never detained. 
The two believers from Nguyen Ly\'s pagoda were detained for two 
days and released, after which they promptly returned to Tu Hieu 
Pagoda. 
 
5. (SBU) ConGen also spoke with Thich Vien Kien, an associate of 
Thich Vien Dinh, via a landline at Giac Hoa Pagoda.  He said that 
police had escorted Thich Vien Dinh to his pagoda on October 11, 
at 7:00 p.m.  Monks inside saw local police filming the pagoda 
from a distance before his arrival.  Many plainclothes security 
officers remained just outside the premises today.  While Thich 
Vien Dinh had not received any written administrative detention 
order, the Binh Thanh District police had told him vaguely he 
needed approval to \"travel.\"  They also told him to resign from 
his new position as Second Vice President of the Institute for the 
Dissemination of the Dharma.  The police had advised him that he 
would be \"invited\" to the police station for questioning, but then 
visited him briefly October 15 to ask about his health and any 
special needs.  According to Thich Vien Kien, Thich Vien Dinh is 
tired and a little disoriented from the ordeal, but otherwise 
healthy.  He apparently responded to the police by saying that, \"I 
am a monk and need nothing but to practice my religion.\" 
 
6. (SBU) ConGen was unable to contact monks at four different 
pagodas in Hue, where UBCV monks have reportedly been under 
pressure from police since attending the \"illegal\" leadership 
meeting, with some telephones cut off and others just ringing or 
busy.  Thich Tue Sy told ConGen that Thich Thien Hanh had already 
gone on hunger strike the last time they spoke on October 12.  He 
said the UBCV was working to get followers in the U.S. to contact 
relatives in the Hue area to have them go check on the situation.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S FIRST OPEN ECONOMIC ZONE - NO NUDE BEACHES YET 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  In another example of the GVN channeling resources to the 
relatively poor central coast of the country, Vietnam\'s first 
\"Open Economic Zone\" has opened for business.  More a vision than 
a reality, the zone is different from the many industrial parks 
and export processing zones scattered throughout the country in 
its size, scope and incentives for investors.  It is also 
established and funded in part by the central government.  Phase 
one of the project encompasses more than 150 square km, and it 
includes a free port, an airport, and plans for an industrial 
zone, residential, and tourism areas.  So far, however, it is 
mostly sand.  Chu Lai\'s possible saving grace is its airport. 
FedEx has indicated interest in the facility, which was built to 
accommodate B-52 bombers.  Company officials state that it has 
almost an ideal location near major air routes as well as 
excellent weather conditions virtually every day of the year.  For 
FedEx to consider this site as a regional hub, however, Vietnam 
would need to make significant reforms to customs regulations and 
procedures as well as allow 100% foreign ownership of their 
operation here. Fed Ex officials in HCMC did call the just- 
initialed bilateral Air Agreement \"good news.\"  Meanwhile, a 
successful Chu Lai OEZ could become an impetus for further reform 
and regional development, but sadly seems just as likely to end up 
another unrealized dream.  End summary. 
 
A vision for the future, but sand right now 
------------------------------------------- 
2.  The Chu Lai Open Economic Zone is now open for business. 
Visitors who make their way out to the rather remote site, located 
about 2 hours south of Danang by car at the southern edge of Quang 
Nam Province, will have to use their imaginations to envision the 
extraordinary infrastructure development that has yet to occur. 
The site is enormous.  Phase one takes up an area of about 150 
square kilometers.  Plans also call for a second, larger phase to 
begin development in 2015.  According to these plans, the zone 
would run along virtually the entire coastline of the province, 
from the historic town of Hoi An in the north to the site of the 
Dung Quat oil refinery project in neighboring Quang Ngai Province 
in the south.   The OEZ as it is today, however, runs only as far 
north as Tam Ky, the provincial capital, and is mostly sand.  DPO 
and Econoff traveled to Chu Lai this summer and found virtually no 
infrastructure yet in place. 
 
3.  Chu Lai Open Economic Zone is Vietnam\'s first OEZ.  According 
to local officials, it will offer the most liberal regulatory 
environment and incentives for investment and business activities 
in the country.  The OEZ is different from the many industrial 
parks and export-processing zones scattered throughout Vietnam in 
its scope, size, and amount of incentives offered to investors. 
The centerpiece of the zone will be a free-trade zone with a free 
port.  Foreign vessels and crews will be allowed entry to the port 
and free-trade zone and will not need go through customs and 
immigration procedures.  Goods moving in and out of the free trade 
zone are not subject to tariffs or value added tax.  The OEZ will 
also have an industrial park, residential zones and tourism areas. 
 
4.  Throughout the OEZ, investors will get the best tax breaks in 
the country.  Enterprises operating in the OEZ will be exempt from 
corporate income tax for the first eight years after the 
enterprise has become profitable, then taxes will be applied at 
50% of the standard rate for the next seven years.  Individuals 
employed in the zone, both locals and foreigners, will also pay 
personal income tax at reduced rates.  Land and infrastructure 
costs will be offered at concessionary rates.  In addition, land 
leases will run for 70 years, the longest in Vietnam.  Foreigners 
will be able to acquire property for residential as well as for 
industrial/commercial purposes.  Officials state foreigners and 
Vietnamese investing and trading in the zone will receive the same 
treatment. 
 
The port is small - so far 
-------------------------- 
5. For now, the port is small and still under construction.  It 
can currently receive a 7,000 DWT vessel and expansion plans call 
for it to receive 10,000DWT ships next year.  It could potentially 
be expanded to receive 30,000DWT ships at some point in the 
future.  The length of the waterway is 4 km from buoy zero to the 
first wharf.  The protected waterway leading up to the seaport has 
a channel 8-15 meters deep by 200 meters wide.  Port officials 
state that the channel could be dredged up to 300 meters wide and 
12-16 meters deep.  The ship turning bay is 8 square km wide and 
the waiting bay is 7 square km.  There are two wharves, one of 
which is currently being used by a Vietnam - Japanese joint 
venture to break down ships.  This port is comparable in size to 
other small ports that dot the Vietnam coast. 
 
Good weather at the airport 
--------------------------- 
6.  One real plus for the OEZ may be its airport.  Currently 
operated by the military, it is scheduled to become a facility 
that will come under the joint jurisdiction of military and 
civilian authorities.  The facility covers 2300 ha and is planned 
to expand to 4,000 ha in the future.  Local officials claim that 
the airport is in good condition and note that it was built to 
accommodate B-52 bombers.  FedEx representatives who have had 
access to the airport, however, state that it would have to be 
considered basically a green field site and would need to be 
substantially rebuilt.  (Post note:  The local press reports that 
the Vietnam Civil Aviation Administration is investing US$6 
million to upgrade the airport.  In the first phase, $4 million 
will be spent to build terminals and transport systems and install 
flight control equipment.)  FedEx does point out, however, that 
the airport has an ideal location.  Not only is it located on key 
regional air routes, Chu Lai has ideal weather for an airport and 
would face relatively few weather-related closings and delays. 
 
7.  FedEx has expressed interest in considering the site as an 
alternative to its current Southeast Asia hub in Subic Bay in the 
Philippines.  For it to pursue its interest, however, FedEx has 
stated that it would need substantial reforms in Vietnamese 
customs regulations and procedures. In addition FedEx would seek 
100% foreign ownership of its enterprise here.  Even though local 
press has occasionally reported FedEx\'s interest in the site, 
there is so far little movement on any of these agenda items. 
FedEx has pointed out that making these changes would probably be 
worth the effort for Vietnam, since landing fees for just one 
large cargo plane currently run about US$20,000.  Fed Ex in 
Vietnam did however call the bilateral Air Services Agreement 
initialed in Hanoi on October 9 \"good news.\"  (Note:  This 
agreement will give all-cargo carriers like FedEx the ability to 
operate from Vietnam with flexible routing rights and no limit on 
frequencies.  End note.) 
 
Support from the Top 
-------------------- 
8.  The Chu Lai Open Economic Zone was approved by the Politburo 
in 1999 and finally approved by the Prime Minister this summer. 
According to Quang Nam officials, the project was able get 
approval because of significant political support in Hanoi.  Mr. 
Le Xuan Trinh formally initiated the project in 1996.  A native of 
Quang Nam, he headed the Office of Government from 1988 - 1996 and 
then that year moved to head the Management Board of Vietnam 
Industrial Parks and Export Processing Zones.  He retired in 2001. 
The Party Secretary of Quang Nam, Mr. Vu Ngoc Hoang, was also a 
strong backer.  His political influence was boosted considerably 
by the fact that his uncle was Vo Chi Cong, the former President 
of Vietnam.  Other strong backers were Deputy PM Nguyen Tan Dung, 
who headed the steering committee for planning the OEZ, and Mr. 
Troung Tan Sang, Head of the Central Commission on Economic 
Affairs. 
 
9.  The idea for such an OEZ had clearly been around for some time 
in Vietnam.  When Econoff was introduced to an elderly economist 
\"who originally proposed the idea of an open economic zone,\" 
Econoff asked when he first raised the idea.  A wry smile crossed 
the old mans face and with a measure of satisfaction he replied 
\"1954.\" 
 
Helping out the Central Coast 
----------------------------- 
10.  This project, like many others, is designed to give a boost 
to the development prospects of the central coast.  With a per 
capita GDP of USD$230, Quang Nam Province is poor.  Even though 
the province boasts two UNESCO-designated world heritage sites and 
120 kilometers of coastline, it has little which resembles the 
more prosperous Ho Chi Minh City area.  It is located just south 
of Danang, and split from that province in 1999.  According GVN 
measures, 20% of its population of 1.4 million lives below the 
poverty line and more than 30% of children under the age of 5 are 
malnourished.  Last year the province exported about US$36.6 
million worth of goods, most of which was very low value added 
goods and commodities - agricultural goods and seafood, clothing 
and footwear, and sand.  Because of the relative poverty of this 
region, the central government has tried to commit resources to 
help aid development.   The Dung Quat oil refinery project, for 
example, is located just south of Chu Lai. 
 
Is this Shenzhen? 
----------------- 
11.  Although Chu Lai has already attracted some investment, it is 
still early days.  It will be hard pressed to successfully sell to 
the world a tourism zone located virtually in the front yard of an 
industrial park and near an oil refinery.  And without 
infrastructure, regardless of the price, attracting business will 
be rough going.  Companies will find it difficult to attract 
expatriate management and technical staff.   When DPO and Econoff 
visited the site, local officials were insistent that the project 
would succeed because \"the Prime Minister has given his support.\" 
The support they need, however, is support from businesses willing 
to make sizable long-term investments.  They also need to deal 
with what one Chu Lai official dubbed their biggest challenge - 
\"the capacity of local officials.\"  One speaker at a seminar 
introducing Chu Lai in HCMC suggested that the model for the 
project was Shenzhen, China, the wildly successful open economic 
area that Deng Xiaoping established along the border with Hong 
Kong.   If only Chu Lai shared a border with Hong Kong. 
 
12.  With that said, however, some investors have shown interest. 
According to local officials, a Taiwanese and a French firm are 
pursuing a tourism project.  A number of Korean firms have also 
looked into the site.  Two consulting firms in HCMC have also 
informed Econoff that they have talked with Korean clients 
interested in possibly building in Chu Lai because they have taken 
note of the low cost land and tax breaks. 
 
13.  Some potential investors have expressed interest in learning 
just how open Chu Lai will be for different businesses.  The Party 
Secretary of the Province, who looks something like a rumpled 
 
SIPDIS 
professor, stood up at the seminar in Ho Chi Minh City publicizing 
the establishment of the zone and stated that \"all business 
activity not specifically prohibited by Vietnamese law would be 
permitted in Chu Lai.\"   That brought several serious questions 
about the possibility of opening banking and other financial 
services firms as well as casinos in the zone.  One member of the 
audience drew the most attention when he asked if nude beaches 
would be permitted.  The party secretary smiled, and replied that 
because of the current cultural environment in Vietnam, such a 
suggestion would be best deferred for review at some time in the 
future.  The room erupted in laughter. 
 
Comment 
------- 
14.  The future of the Chu Lai Open Economic Zone is no laughing 
matter, however.  The central government is committing real 
resources into what will either be a large white elephant or a 
potential laboratory for further economic opening and an engine 
for regional growth.  It will take more than good humor and 
central government support to attract the level of investment 
needed for this place to take off.  Even with its low cost labor 
and land, many other locations will still likely be more 
attractive for most investors.  Its best hope is probably 
developing the airport, but first Vietnam will have to get its 
customs act together and make other major reforms.

SUBJECT: POLICE DISRUPT CONSULAR VISIT TO CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
 
------- 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  (U) During a particularly unpleasant trip to the Central 
Highlands to fulfill normal consular duties -- fraud 
investigation, document verification, and personal 
interviews regarding relationships and status -- ConGenOff, 
two Consular Section and Refugee Resettlement Section FSNs, 
and two FSN drivers were subjected to harassment, oral 
threats, the attempted confiscation of their notes and 
schedules, an attempt to block their diplomatic vehicle, and 
an attempt to get into it.  The incidents took place in Gia 
Lai and Dak Lak Provinces October 7-9, and were perpetrated 
by local police. 
 
2.  (U) This was the first time in more than three years 
that local authorities have reacted so vociferously and 
physically to a routine consular visit, although 
surveillance and red tape are not unknown whenever 
ConGenOffs travel outside Ho Chi Minh City.  Nonetheless, 
Post views this as a significant departure from customary 
practice.  Since HCMC\'s consular district boundaries have 
never been established, ConGenOffs have had to depend on the 
political willingness of GVN officials to \"create favorable 
conditions\" for the carrying out of consular and other 
official duties outside HCMC city limits. 
 
3.  (U) Separately, this trip has shown that at least in two 
ethnic minority villages, ConGen can confirm that some 
family registration books are being altered, travel is 
severely restricted, and individuals are closely monitored 
and being prevented from having outside contact.  End 
summary. 
 
---------------------------- 
JUST ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE 
---------------------------- 
4.  (SBU) The ConGen group traveled to three Central 
Highlands provinces for a routine fraud investigation and 
consular verification trip.  This was a joint Consular 
Section Fraud Prevention Unit and Refugee Resettlement 
Section undertaking that focused on eight consular and eight 
refugee cases.  In an effort to verify the status of the 
refugee follow-to-join Visas 93 case of Rmah H\'Ri and her 
daughters residing in Plei H\'Rai Commune, Nhon Hoa Village, 
in the Chu Se District of Gai Lai Province in the Central 
Highlands, ConOff Li Gong and RRS FSN conducted a site visit 
to the family on October 7.  ConGenOff\'s goal was to verify 
the family\'s passport application status, establish family 
relationships and examine civil documents related to her 
visa application.  However, plainclothes policemen from both 
the village and province disrupted the visit.  The police 
harassed ConOff and FSN, by shadowing their every move and 
insisting on \"answering\" the questions that ConOff posed to 
Rmah H\'Ri. 
 
5.  (SBU) Rmah H\'Ri\'s house is located along National 
Highway 14, 36 kilometers from the provincial capital of 
Pleiku.  Before arriving at her house, ConOff telephoned 
Rmah H\'Ri at her neighbor\'s house and informed her of the 
intended visit.  Rmah H\'Ri met ConOff and FSN by the gate to 
her house and took her inside.  Five minutes later, they 
were interrupted by five plainclothes policemen who entered 
the house without knocking or asking permission.  Rmah H\'Ri 
stayed seated without speaking a word.  Her three daughters 
hid in another room.  The police were led by A Anh Tuan, who 
claimed to be the provincial policeman in charge of the 
village.  He and two other policemen were accompanied by the 
village police chief. 
 
6.  (SBU) A Anh Tuan demanded ConOff surrender her ID card 
and barked out a series of questions: who sent you here; who 
gave you permission to come to this house, etc.  ConOff 
explained she was an American diplomat working at the U.S. 
Consulate General in HCMC, who was here to conduct routine 
consular fraud investigations and to learn, firsthand, why 
Rmah H\'Ri\'s family had not applied for their resettlement to 
the U.S., even though the Visas 93 petitions were filed more 
than two years ago.  ConOff stated she did not need 
permission for such a visit.  A Anh Tuan demanded ConOff 
follow him to the local People\'s Committee, saying any 
foreigners wishing to visit the village had to obtain local 
and provincial police permission.  A Anh Tuan spoke in a 
threatening voice, visibly upset that he was unsuccessful in 
intimidating ConOff.  ConOff explained that ConGen staff 
conduct fraud investigations on a regular basis throughout 
south and central Vietnam.  No other province has ever 
required the Consulate to obtain permission.  A Anh Tuan 
then informed ConOff she could continue her conversation 
with Rmah H\'Ri but only in his presence. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
MAYBE SHE\'S NOT A CRIMINAL, BUT HER HUSBAND IS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
7.  (SBU) ConOff told A Anh Tuan that a policeman is present 
whenever she visits an American prisoner in jail.  She asked 
if Rmah H\'Ri was a criminal.  A Anh Tuan replied, \"She is 
not a criminal, but her husband is a criminal wanted by the 
Vietnamese government.\"  He went on to say that the husband 
belonged to a U.S.-based anti-GVN group and is wanted by 
Interpol.  When ConOff re-emphasized the purpose of her 
visit was simply to verify the relationship as a consular 
issue, the policeman relaxed somewhat. 
 
8.  (SBU) Rmah H\'Ri, who is a Jarai ethnic minority, and her 
three daughters live in a modest house located in a mixed 
Vietnamese Kinh/ethnic minority village.  She is now a 
pepper farmer working on the land assigned to her, after she 
was forced to resign from her job as a teacher in order to 
apply for passports so she and her daughters could resettle 
in the U.S.  The family\'s passport applications were 
subsequently denied.  Rmah H\'Ri last contacted the Gia Lai 
Provincial Immigration Office in September 2002 and was told 
there was no update on her applications.  Another 
immigration officer told Rmah H\'Ri that her family would 
never be issued passports. 
 
9.  (SBU) Rmah H\'Ri stated that she was closely monitored 
and frequently called in for questioning by the village 
police.  The number of village policemen had increased from 
three to five, after her husband was resettled in the U.S. 
via Cambodia in 2001.  Rmah H\'Ri also confirmed that a \"Do 
Not Enter\" sign had been affixed to her door before PRM 
Assistant Secretary Dewey\'s visit to Gia Lai Province in mid- 
August.  Police took down the sign one day prior to A/ 
Dwy\'s visit, and then put it up and took it down again. 
 
-------------------------- 
CONTROLLING \"THOSE\" PEOPLE 
-------------------------- 
10.  (SBU) According to A Anh Tuan and the village police 
chief, their responsibility is \"to control the village and 
people like Rmah H\'Ri\" and \"to monitor and limit their 
contact with the outside world.\"  A Anh Tuan informed ConOff 
that police trained the villagers to report any visitors or 
strangers as soon as they entered the village.  The village 
police chief said that everyone had to have the police\'s 
permission to leave the village and that Rmah H\'Ri was no 
exception.  The village police chief recalled the last time 
Rmah H\'Ri left the village was this past June, when she took 
her daughter to a doctor in Nha Trang City. 
 
11.  (U) ConOff asked to examine Rmah H\'Ri\'s family 
registration book, her children\'s birth certificates, her 
marriage certificate and some family photos.  Rmah H\'Ri 
handed over a brand new family registration book (ho khau)-- 
which did not include her husband\'s name.  ConOff asked why 
her husband\'s name was not in the ho khau.  Policeman A Anh 
Tuan responded that the ho khau only includes people 
currently living in the village and that everyone had been 
issued a new ho khau last year.  (Post Note: Deleting family 
members who no longer reside in a given village is not the 
normal practice in Vietnam.  Ho khaus do include family 
members who have already left the household, with a note 
indicating when the person left.) 
 
12.  (SBU) As ConOff prepared to depart, A Anh Tuan promised 
there would be no punishment/reprisals against Rmah H\'Ri and 
her family.  When ConOff asked A Anh Tuan why he could not 
help Rmah H\'Ri reunite with her husband, he responded, \"I 
was told by higher ranking officers to monitor Rmah H\'Ri.  I 
have no role in the passport issuance matter, even though I 
sympathize with her situation.\" 
 
13.  (SBU) According to Rmah H\'Ri, her annual income from 
the two-hectare pepper farm is about five million dong 
(USD$320 - the average per capita income in Gia Lai Province 
is about USD$240).  Her husband sends USD$100-200 per month 
to supplement the family expenses and calls her once a 
month.  Rmah H\'Ri also has one cow and some chickens.  The 
oldest daughter, born in 1986, dropped out of school in 
order to help with the farm work.  The two younger 
daughters, born in 1991 and 1995, continue to attend school. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
HIT THE ROAD, JACK, AND DON\'T YOU COME BACK NO MORE 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
14.  (SBU) The next day, ConOff, two FSNs and two drivers 
set off to locate another Montagnard case in Ea Bar village, 
about 35 kilometers northwest of Buon Me Thuot in Dak Lak 
Province.  This time, the local police forced ConOff and 
team to leave the village before they could locate the 
family of H\'Pun M\'Lo.  Though ConOff was prevented from 
locating H\'Pun M\'Lo, the very fact that the ConGen group had 
entered the village and spoken even briefly with a couple 
residents to ask for directions clearly upset the local 
authorities.  The police were both nervous and angered by 
the thought of any conversation that might have occurred 
between ConOff and the villagers. Police escorted ConOff and 
FSNs to the local People\'s Committee where they detained 
them for over two hours. 
 
15.  (SBU) H\'Pun M\'Lo is the wife of Y-Rit Hdok, who went to 
the United States as a refugee, after fleeing to Cambodia in 
2001.  He had subsequently written to an American NGO and 
the State Department to urge speedy visa issuance in 
bringing his wife and family to the U.S.  Y-Rit Hdok alleged 
that local police had arrested his wife, H\'Pun M\'Lo.  The 
Refugee Resettlement Section was unable to locate a visa 
petition filed on behalf of H\'Pun M\'Lo, given the limited 
information contained in the original letter from Y-Rit 
Hdok.  ConOff\'s goal was to find out from the family itself 
whether a petition had ever been filed, examine their 
documentation, and verify relationships. 
 
16.  (U) Ea Bar Village, located 30 kilometers from the 
Cambodian border, was home to several ethnic minority 
residents who went to the U.S. as refugees in 2001, but 
never filed petitions on behalf of family members left 
behind.  ConOff had intended to speak with some of those 
family members to find out why petitions were never filed, 
as Post never received the numerous Visas 93 petitions it 
had expected. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
AND JUST WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO VISIT? 
------------------------------------------ 
17.  (SBU) Upon arriving at Ea Bar Village, ConOff asked for 
directions to H\'Pun M\'Lo\'s house.  A villager told her to 
ask a policeman -- one who just happened to be standing a 
little too close for comfort to the ConGen\'s diplomatic 
license-plated car.  When the Consulate driver tried to back 
the car up, three policemen blocked it and ordered ConOff 
and FSNs to follow them to the police station.  There, three 
policemen questioned ConOff and two FSNs for about 20 
minutes.  They wanted to know if police permission had been 
granted for the visit, and how the ConGen group found out 
about H\'Pun M\'Lo (though nobody would confirm that she lived 
in Ea Bar village).  ConOff told police that this was a 
routine consular investigation trip for which she needed to 
speak directly with the family in question. 
 
18.  (U) The policemen claimed that according to Vietnamese 
law, anyone who wished to visit an ethnic minority person or 
village had to obtain prior permission.  (Post Note: Post is 
unaware of any such law and the policemen could not produce 
it or quote a citation number for it.)  At this point, the 
lead policeman left the room.  Meantime, the other policeman 
was crowding in close to one FSN, apparently trying to get 
into position to snatch the trip schedule from her hands. 
When the lead policeman returned ten minutes later, he 
ordered the ConGen team to proceed immediately to the 
District People\'s Committee.  The lead policeman then tried 
to get into the Consulate car to escort them, but the doors 
were locked and ConGen travelers shooed him away.  Five 
plainclothes policemen on motorbikes surrounded the ConGen 
vehicle, and led it to the People\'s Committee. 
 
19.  (SBU) After arriving at the District People\'s 
Committee, ConOff and one FSN were escorted to a conference 
room, where a People\'s Committee official and commune 
policeman waited.  Neither would give their names.  ConOff 
was informed that the chief immigration officer for the 
district would soon arrive.  Two or three policemen 
surrounded ConOff and FSN at all times during the 45-minute 
wait.  None of the policemen spoke, except to say that it 
was against Vietnamese law to visit a member of an ethnic 
minority group without prior permission.  None would confirm 
whether H\'Pun M\'Lo lived in Ea Bar Village. 
 
20.  (U) Meanwhile, outside the District People\'s Committee, 
two more GVN vehicles with a total of 20 uniformed policemen 
had arrived.  The FSN and two drivers who remained behind 
were questioned separately by police.  The police were 
particularly interested in learning how ConOff found the 
right route to the village, whether the ConGen group had 
spoken with any minority people prior to \"meeting\" the local 
police, and what did the ConGen group talk about when they 
were riding in the car.  The policemen were intensely 
interested in finding out what was in the ConGen vehicle and 
asked whether there were any gifts for the ethnic minority 
people (there weren\'t).  (Post Note: We are not sure if the 
police were hinting for a bribe, or were sincerely concerned 
that ConGen staff might be smuggling \"subversive\" documents 
into the villages.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
WELL, MAYBE YOU DIDN\'T BREAK ANY LAWS, BUT YOU\'RE STILL BAD 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
21.  (U) The chief immigration officer, Mr. Nguyen Dinh 
Thoi, his assistant Mr. Le Dinh Tri, and External Relations 
Office rep Ms. Tran Thi Thang arrived at the People\'s 
Committee 40 minutes later.  Mr. Thoi was pleasant enough, 
but also appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. 
 
22.  (U) Mr. Thoi had only one message to deliver -- ConOff 
had violated Vietnamese law, but could be forgiven as long 
as she promised that this would never happen again.  He 
repeated this three times.  After ConOff repeatedly 
responded that no one in the Consulate General was aware of 
the existence of such a law, and asked him to produce a copy 
of said law, Mr. Thoi finally conceded that ConOff had not 
broken any law.  But, he admonished, any and all future 
ConOffs would still be required to obtain prior permission. 
In addition, he requested an \"introduction letter\" attesting 
to the ConOff\'s bona fides.  He claimed the Immigration 
Office would only be able \"to help\" if ConOff could present 
such a letter, describing the nature of her inquiries, and 
in effect, asking for permission. 
 
23.  (SBU) ConOff responded that she could ask the ConGen to 
fax such a letter, with the understanding she would proceed 
with the visit.  The three GVN officials then stated that 
this letter had to be sent to the provincial ERO in Dak 
Lak\'s capital, Buon Me Thuot, where a decision on permitting 
a consular visit would be made.  According to Mr. Thoi, Ea 
Bar Village was a sensitive place and \"unsafe for a diplomat 
without escort.\"  (Post Note: This is a favorite GVN 
excuse.)  After spending about 90 minutes in this \"meeting\" 
at the People\'s Committee, ConOff and team were instructed 
to go to their hotel under police escort.  The ConGen 
travelers passed an uneventful night, and departed for Lam 
Dong Province the next day as scheduled.  Though Lam Dong is 
also a Central Highlands province, the ConGen group 
experienced no problems there. 
 
------------------------------ 
COMMENT: NO HAPPY CAMPERS HERE 
------------------------------ 
24.  (SBU) During both incidents in Gia Lai and Dak Lak 
provinces, the local police were constantly on the phone, 
consulting with someone in higher authority.  The insistence 
that ConOff needed local and provincial police permission in 
order to carry out normal consular duties was a surprising 
additional requirement.   The monitoring and control in 
these two ethnic minority villages was far more severe than 
anything other ConGenOffs have seen during previous Central 
Highlands visits.  The environment of oppression and control 
reflected a clear attempt to prevent contact with the 
outside world.  Given the population composition of Ea Bar 
and Nhon Hoa villages, one can only assume these practices 
are directed against ethnic minorities and/or against those 
families who had someone who fled to Cambodia.  It is no 
wonder that the Refugee Resettlement Section has seen so few 
follow-to-join resettlement petitions for these family 
members.  If local police feel empowered to intimidate and 
threaten ConGen personnel, one can only imagine how they 
treat the people who are supposedly in their care.  ConGen\'s 
experience in Dak Lak Province and Gia Lai Province -- but 
PARTICULARLY DAK LAK -- contradicts our experience in other 
parts of southern Vietnam, where local authorities have 
welcomed consular visits and offered assistance. 
 
25.  (SBU) As a result of this trip, Post was able to 
confirm some specific allegations that have been made about 
GVN treatment of ethnic minorities in Ea Bar (Dak Lak 
Province) and Nhon Hoa (Gia Lai Province).  Family 
registration books have been altered.  Whether this is to 
make it more difficult to determine relationships for 
immigration purposes or not, is difficult to conclude. 
However, it is not normal Vietnamese practice to delete 
people from family registration books simply because they no 
longer live in a given village.  Ethnic minority residents 
in Ea Bar and Nhon Hoa definitely live in fear of the police 
and local officials.  Travel is restricted, and in lead 
policeman A Anh Tuan\'s own words, the police are there to 
control inhabitants and prevent contact with the outside 
world. 
 
26.  (SBU) Post was in regular communication with the ConGen 
travelers throughout.  At no time were they in actual 
danger, although the provincial and local authorities were 
verbally and physically intimidating. The Embassy and ConGen 
have raised Rmah H\'Ri\'s case with provincial and central GVN 
officials in diplomatic notes and in person.  We have made 
no secret of our concern.  The case has also generated 
inquiries from Senator John Edwards (September 8, 2003) and 
Kay Reibold of the Vietnam Highlands Assistance Project. 
The case of H\'Pun M\'Lo was the subject of an e-mail from 
Mike Benge and a subsequent inquiry from DAS Matt Daley 
(September 18).  Neither case is extraordinary in its 
consular implications.  What is unusual is the strongly 
negative local GVN over-reaction.  Whether or not the GVN 
likes the fact that ethnic minority people fled to Cambodia 
before seeking refuge in the U.S., these are bona fide 
refugee cases as adjudicated under U.S. law.  GVN officials, 
who profess to give a high priority to family reunification 
and the establishment of a \"normal bilateral immigration 
relationship with the U.S.,\" seem not to extend this 
priority to follow-to-join family members in the Central 
Highlands. 
 
27.  (SBU) Further, it would appear that a GVN policy 
evolved over the years of permitting Vietnamese to travel 
freely throughout the country has taken a step backward -- 
at least in certain parts of the country or at least as 
certain local police choose to enforce it.  GVN public 
statements about how Vietnam is a safe place, and that 
foreigners and tourists can visit all but officially 
restricted areas, also seems at odds with what local police 
told ConGen travelers. 
 
28.  (SBU) On a more personal note, Post is once again 
reminded of how much its travel depends on which side of the 
bed GVN officialdom wakes up on each morning.  Without the 
established consular district as outlined in the L. Desaix 
Anderson of February 12, 1997 (from Thua Thien-Hue and all 
points south), ConGen personnel are subject to arbitrary 
treatment and constantly shifting definitional goalposts as 
to what constitutes \"permission\", \"approval\", 
\"notification\", \"requests\", etc. whenever they travel 
outside of HCMC. 
 
29.  (SBU) There has been no movement on the GVN\'s part to 
formally recognize the Consulate General\'s consular district 
in the past six years.  And now, even the usual and 
customary practice of the past three years of \"allowing\" 
routine consular trips to proceed without prior permission 
has been set on its head.  In fact, GVN authorities seem to 
have affixed additional requirements and hoops to jump 
through.  Vietnam may have aspirations to join the 
international economic community via the WTO.  One can only 
hope it aspires to join the international diplomatic 
community as well.  End comment.

SUBJECT: 145,000 PIRATED DISCS/TAPES CONFISCATED IN HO CHI MINH 
CITY - WHAT\'S NEXT? 
 
1. Summary:  Ho Chi Minh City\'s thriving trade in pirated media 
took a hit at the end of September when inspectors from the city\'s 
Department of Culture and Information (DCI) raided a large 
wholesale/retail shop where they confiscated over one hundred 
thousand pirated CDs, DVDs, VCDs, and videotapes.  Whether this 
will make much of a difference, how the authorities targeted the 
shop, and what will happen to the owner remain a mystery.  In a 
stiff, formal meeting between Econoff and DCI officials, they 
offered little context for the raid other than their claim that 
this was not an isolated enforcement action.  In fact one local 
official claimed HCMC authorities have confiscated over 700,000 
discs thus far this year.  Up to now, however, there has been no 
visible impact on other shops selling pirated CDs and DVDs here. 
End Summary. 
 
Possible Prosecutions, No One Detained Yet 
------------------------------------------ 
2.  Media reports stated that inspectors from the Ho Chi Minh City 
Department of Culture and Information raided an optical media shop 
on September 27 and confiscated over 100,000 items.  These reports 
characterized this raid as the largest in the city\'s history and 
part of an ongoing and concerted campaign to cut local stocks of 
pirated discs in half by year\'s end.  Some newspaper reports 
stated that the shop had been operating under the protection of a 
local police officer that happened to be the brother of the shop 
owner. 
 
3.  Econoff met with Deputy Director Nguyen Thanh Tan of the 
Department of Culture and Information to learn more about the 
action and praise this recent episode of enforcement.  Deputy 
Director Tan noted that the raid netted 145,000 pirated units. 
The majority of the discs were Vietnamese music CDs rather than 
foreign music or movie titles.  Inspectors concluded the store was 
a retailer of pirated discs, as well as a storage and distribution 
center serving other retailers.  Mr. Tan said his office turned 
over the findings of its investigation to the police.  Given the 
sheer number of discs and tapes involved, he expects the shop 
owner will face prosecution.  Local press has reported that, 
according to the department\'s Acting Chief Inspector, those 
involved will be brought to trial.  At present, however, the shop 
owner is free and will remain so pending the police review of the 
case and a decision on whether to bring charges.  Mr. Tan also 
said the authorities are interested in two other individuals 
associated with the case, though he did not elaborate on their 
relationship to the shop owner. 
 
Why this Shop? 
-------------- 
4.  Econoff asked Mr. Tan how the shop was identified and 
targeted, pointing out that pirated discs are openly sold 
throughout HCMC.  Tan sidestepped the question, however, 
explaining that his office\'s \"Research Section\" identified the 
shop and placed it under surveillance for over a week, after which 
his inspectors conducted the raid.  What brought the shop to the 
attention of the authorities remains unknown.  He denied any 
knowledge that local police were protecting the shop. 
 
5.  Other press accounts report that the department would target 
two production facilities in the future.  The Deputy Director, 
while agreeing with Econoff that producers were the most important 
link in the chain, would not elaborate on any possible new raids. 
He did repeatedly emphasize, however, that this raid was not some 
isolated incident but just one of many actions carried out by his 
inspectors as part of their ongoing campaign against pirated 
discs.  He even disputed headlines in local papers that dubbed 
this raid as the largest to date.  Tan said that equally large 
hauls of contraband goods had been taken in the past.  He seemed 
at pains to convey the impression that local authorities are fully 
engaged in the effort to control IPR violators and not just 
conducting a raid here and there for show.  In a follow-up 
conversation one DCI official stated that various authorities in 
HCMC have confiscated over 700,000 discs thus far this year. 
 
Why Act Alone? 
-------------- 
6.  The Department of Culture and Information is one of several 
local agencies that have authority to work in IPR enforcement. 
The DCI is more typically known for its role in licensing all 
cultural events and performances as well as publications.  These 
are the folks that censor publications and keep porn and politics 
out of the bookshops.  Recent press accounts of anti-piracy 
activities have referred to Team 814, an inter-agency group 
working against piracy in HCMC.  Tan listed his organization, the 
city\'s Trade Office, the Market Management Board, tourism 
authorities, city police, and the Department of Labor, Invalids 
and Social Affairs as members of Team 814.  The raid involved 
about 10 inspectors from the Culture and Information Service but 
no other participants.  The Deputy Director did not elaborate on 
why that was the case, except to say that they had a small time 
window to conduct the raid, thus bringing in other agencies was 
not feasible. 
 
Not Invited 
----------- 
7.  As for the fate of the confiscated discs, Tan told Econoff 
they would be burned or crushed under the wheel of a steamroller 
by the end of the month.  He added that authorities would destroy 
discs from this raid with discs confiscated in other actions, 
maybe as many as a million in all.  When Econoff told Tan he would 
be very interested in attending the destruction of the discs, Tan 
chuckled and responded that such events were always televised and 
Econoff could watch it on TV. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8.  Taking 145,000 pirated discs off the streets of HCMC, while 
certainly a positive move, is probably a drop in the bucket, and 
pirated CDs and DVDs are still openly sold throughout the city. 
Up to now, raids on shops selling illegal discs meant perhaps the 
loss of some merchandise, small fines, and a temporary closing. 
Most shops operate untouched.  If local authorities really want to 
stamp out the problem they will need to take aim at bigger fish 
and follow through with real penalties. 
 
9.  While DCI officials declined to offer much background 
information about the raid or their future plans, the local press 
has offered fairly broad coverage.  Vietnamese newspaper reports 
credit the authorities with identifying two production centers and 
claim that four or five \"giant\" suppliers serve the city\'s disc 
shops.  If the newspapers are correct, we hope the authorities 
will quickly move from \"identify\" and \"suspect\" to enforcement 
actions.  In the most recent case, as with the problem as a whole, 
the raids are an important beginning, but more will be needed for 
a lasting impact.

PROVINCE 
 
REF:  A)  HCMC 0833   B) HCMC 0842 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  In recent meetings with Lam Dong provincial 
authorities,  PRM Assistant Secretary Dewey expressed strong U.S. 
concern about the treatment of ethnic minorities and a lack of 
religious freedom for unregistered Protestant house churches.  Lam 
Dong officials stressed that the practice of Christianity and 
Buddhism is open and widespread, and said they were considering 
measures to accelerate the pace of church registrations.  In the 
meantime, house churches would be allowed to operate while their 
paperwork was being completed.  So far, Lam Dong has registered 12 
Protestant churches under the umbrella of the GVN-recognized 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV).  Another 168 house 
churches are in the process of applying for registration.  It is 
unclear how many other churches do not wish to apply at this time. 
Provincial officials emphasized poverty as the biggest threat to 
the welfare of ethnic minorities and asked for assistance in 
attracting U.S. investments.  On the whole, Lam Dong province 
seems to represent a slightly more progressive model of religious 
tolerance in the Central Highlands, although there are continuing 
reports of problems.  PRM Assistant Secretary Dewey was 
accompanied by DCM/Charge, HCMC Acting CG, Refugee Resettlement 
Section chief, and EAP/BCLTV Vietnam Desk Officer.  End summary. 
 
2.  (U)  In a meeting with Lam Dong Provincial People\'s Committee 
Chairman Phan Thien, A/S Dewey expressed his pleasure at returning 
to Dalat for the first time in nearly 40 years, setting a cordial 
tone for the discussion that followed.  Mr. Thien provided a 
relatively positive overview of current conditions in the 
province, despite its underdeveloped economy.  He said the 
introduction of coffee as a cash crop had initially been a great 
boon for ethnic minorities.  During the period of rising coffee 
prices a few years ago, as many as 140,000 hectares of land had 
been planted with coffee and many towns and villages had bought a 
lot of machinery and equipment to support coffee farming. 
However, the more recent downturn in coffee prices had affected 
ethnic minority groups badly.  Their income from coffee crops had 
declined dramatically, and they had heavy debts still to pay from 
the equipment purchases of previous years.  He hoped that a 
gradual rise again in coffee prices might help alleviate the 
situation.  He also said the province was trying to build more 
roads this year and would strive to extend the electrical network 
to the last three villages still without electricity. 
 
3.  (U)  On the issue of religious freedom, Mr. Thien stated 
directly that Vietnam in general -- and Lam Dong province in 
particular -- enjoy freedom of religion.  He called the practice 
of Catholicism and Buddhism \"very good now,\" noting there are 
numerous new churches and pagodas to be seen on the road to Dalat. 
He claimed there is no town in the province where religion is a 
problem.  Chairman Thien then went on to state very matter-of- 
factly that he was sure, however, that we wanted to know about 
policies toward Protestants.  He started by noting that there are 
over 65,000 Protestants in the province, an increase since pre- 
1975 days, and that many of the Protestants are residents of 
ethnic minority villages. 
 
4.  (SBU)  Mr. Thien expressed concern that many believers seek to 
use the cover of religion for what is actually political activity, 
citing the Dega group in particular.  A/S Dewey responded that he 
had spoken with many sincere believers on this trip, e.g., in 
Pleiku (ref B), who were also concerned about staying away from 
such political activity.  A/S Dewey said clearly that the USG 
recognizes the territorial integrity of Vietnam and does not 
support the Dega movement or its calls for a separate state. 
However, Mr. Dewey said the U.S. believes the Dega political group 
to be relatively small, and that the vast majority of Protestant 
believers simply want to practice their faith.  It is essential 
that believers be allowed to gather together for religious 
purposes. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Chairman Thien indicated he understood this distinction 
and noted there are now 12 Protestant churches officially 
recognized in Lam Dong Province.  Religious Affairs Committee 
(CRA) director Bang noted that there are a total of 180 Protestant 
churches in Lam Dong.  Concerning the question of the other 168 
churches gaining recognition, Mr. Bang emphasized the role of the 
SECV in establishing charters for Protestant churches as a first 
step.  After that, the CRA would work with the SECV to recognize 
additional churches.  Mr. Bang also raised the need to obtain 
funding in order to build churches for these congregations.  He 
said that as churches established charters through the SECV and 
constructed church buildings, they could become recognized fairly 
quickly.  In response, A/S Dewey emphasized that a church is more 
than just a building; it is also a community.  The important issue 
is to allow for freedom of assembly -- the ability to gather 
together, whether in a church or a house.  Provincial leaders 
pointed out their priority is helping groups build churches and to 
gain formal recognition, but in the meantime, they would permit 
congregations to gather in smaller groups in houses to worship 
together. 
 
6.  (SBU) A/S Dewey asked for confirmation that the 168 
unrecognized but known Protestant churches can gather without 
interference, even in houses.  CRA director Bang confirmed this to 
be the case.  Mr. Bang said it was \"important to take care of the 
spiritual needs of the people,\" as well as their material needs. 
He also stated that the CRA would try to \"facilitate\" the 
registration process, so the 168 unregistered churches could 
register in a relatively short time.  When A/S Dewey made a point 
of stating that the USG does not support the Dega movement, Mr. 
Bang responded that his committee \"understands the difference\" and 
\"tries to distinguish\" between those in the Dega movement with a 
political agenda and those who are \"true believers.\"  A/S Dewey 
welcomed this news and said he hoped Consulate General staff would 
be able to follow up in the near future to see some house churches 
in action. 
 
7.  (U)  In his meetings with provincial officials, A/S Dewey 
encouraged them to improve investment and foreign development 
assistance opportunities in the province.  Having heard their 
comments about the lower level of economic development in Lam 
Dong, he hoped the province would make it easier for U.S. 
companies to participate in economic development.  Chairman Thien 
noted that Lam Dong is far away from the economic powerhouse of Ho 
Chi Minh City.  It has a limited road network, a small airport and 
no direct access to the sea.  But the provincial capital of Dalat, 
which already attracts domestic and some foreign tourists, is 
planning to upgrade the airport to receive international flights. 
Authorities are hopeful that this will help Dalat develop into a 
major tourist center, and felt there may be a role to play for 
American companies in developing the tourism and hospitality 
industry.  A/S Dewey also urged provincial leaders to consider 
foreign assistance projects that USAID could assist with, and said 
he hoped the Embassy would be permitted to follow up on this 
subject. 
 
8.  (SBU)  On a visit later in the day to the village of Suoi Tong 
A, A/S Dewey and his group saw close-up the slowly improving, 
though still underdeveloped, state of the countryside.  Most of 
Suoi Tong A had electricity; a school building had been recently 
built; and most of the houses were of reasonably solid wood and 
stone construction.  The fields surrounding the village were all 
planted and seemed to be filled with thriving crops.  In stops at 
two different houses, A/S Dewey heard from the residents about 
conditions in their village.  While life is still very hard, they 
said that the building of roads and the electrification of the 
village have improved conditions in the past few years.  Both 
Catholics and Protestants live in Suoi Tong A, but no one we spoke 
with complained of any concerted effort to discourage them from 
practicing their religion.  While there were no churches in the 
village itself, Catholics are able to attend a church down the 
main road a few kilometers.  Protestants informed us that they 
were able to gather among themselves informally without 
interference.  There are about eight such \"house churches.\"  They 
have been told they can operate in small groups until a larger 
church is built and registered, when they will be expected to 
consolidate and attend that church. 
 
9.  (SBU)  One light moment came during a short stop en route to 
Suoi Thong A at an ethnic minority handicraft shop.  A/S Dewey and 
his group browsed through the handicrafts and purchased several 
items such as bags and silk fabrics.  As A/S Dewey attempted to 
bargain with the shop lady to lower the price a little bit, she 
shook her head, pointed to the Catholic church across the road, 
and said with a gentle smile, \"God sets the prices.\"  It turned 
out the shop is owned and run by the Catholic church to raise 
money for its ethnic minority congregation. 
 
10.  (SBU) Comment:  Of the three provinces visited by A/S Dewey 
on his trip through the Central Highlands, Lam Dong seemed to 
present the most forward-looking and progressive image.  The 
provincial authorities genuinely seem to be trying to improve 
conditions for the ethnic minority population through economic 
development.  The over-reliance on coffee as a new cash crop may 
have backfired due to the drop in the world market price (caused 
in no small part by Vietnam\'s additional supply), but prices have 
recovered off of their lows.  Road building and rural 
electrification seem to have reached even the smaller and more 
remote villages, increasing access to markets and improving their 
living conditions.  The growth of the tourism industry in Dalat 
should also spur economic development.  Nonetheless, Lam Dong 
remains a relatively poor, underdeveloped province and its ethnic 
minority groups remain on the lower end of the economic and social 
spectrum within the province. 
11.  (SBU) In the area of religious practice, Lam Dong provincial 
officials seemed more willing to discuss the issue, with less 
defensiveness and with some apparent plan in mind for further 
registration of churches.  On the drive into Dalat from 
neighboring Dak Lak province, A/S Dewey observed what appeared to 
be a number of recently constructed Catholic churches in several 
villages along the highway.  The mindset of provincial leaders 
that Protestant congregations must build \"real\" churches as a pre- 
condition for being recognized is a stumbling block, both 
physically and philosophically.  While the apparent tolerance of 
Protestants gathering in houses until \"real\" churches can be built 
and registered is a welcome sign, we must point out that the 
majority of Suoi Tong A\'s Protestants are affiliated with the GVN- 
recognized SECV anyway.  The Consulate General will follow up with 
additional visits, and to verify progress toward registering at 
least some of the 168 identified but unrecognized house churches 
who wish to register. 
 
12.  (U)  This cable was not cleared by A/S Dewey before his 
departure.

Summary 
------- 
1. Chilean President Ricardo Lagos and his delegation ended a 
three-day visit to Vietnam by addressing a seminar devoted to 
improving trade ties.  Impressively, they delivered the message 
that transparency is the key to economic growth and that WTO 
accession is necessary to continue and protect that growth.  The 
meeting was ostensibly about trying to increase trade and 
investment between the two nations, which was a paltry $19 million 
last year.   End summary. 
 
Very Low Levels of Trade 
------------------------ 
2. Following the APEC Leaders Meeting in Bangkok, Chilean 
President Ricardo Lagos spent three days in Vietnam.  Capping off 
this visit, was a seminar called \"Vietnam - Chile Business - New 
Horizons for Corporation\" in Ho Chi Minh City, at which he was 
keynote speaker.   Two hundred businessmen, along with local 
officials, assembled at Ho Chi Minh City\'s Reunification Palace to 
hear Vietnamese and Chilean speakers deliver hopeful messages of a 
brighter trade relationship.  Current trade is modest at best. 
Trade peaked in 2001 at 26.6 million USD but dropped back to 19.1 
million USD in 2002.  Numbers are up so far this year, with trade 
reaching 20 million USD during the first eight months of 2003. 
Trade flowing from Vietnam to Chile includes garments, footwear, 
handicrafts, seafood, and bicycles.  The flow in the other 
direction includes wood, fertilizer, animal feed, and accessories 
used in Vietnam\'s garment industry.  Overall, about 75 percent of 
the trade is Vietnamese exports to Chile. 
 
Keys to Success:  Transparency, Predictability, and the WTO 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
3. Transparency and predictability were twin refrains running 
throughout the Chilean presentations.  The keynote speech by 
President Lagos kept to a message of past and future cooperation 
but members of his delegation spoke more substantively.  Without 
explicitly linking Vietnam to a deficiency in these areas, the 
Chileans made their point.  Time after time, they argued that 
transparency and predictability were the keys to attracting and 
keeping investors, as well as developing the overall economy.  The 
speakers explicitly linked Chile\'s own economic successes to 
transparency and predictability.  The underlying message was quite 
clear: Vietnam must address transparency and rule of law. 
 
4. Ricardo Lagos-Weber, Director for Multilateral Economic Affairs 
at the Chilean Foreign Ministry, also described the nature of 
trading relationships and the importance of the WTO.  The audience 
heard that a byproduct of increased trade was trade conflicts with 
other countries, that as a nation\'s economy grew it would begin to 
impinge on the interests of others and this would naturally lead 
to disputes.  His message was that these disputes were a normal 
part of international trade and a sign of growing economic power. 
The speaker linked the outcome of these disputes to participation 
in the WTO, saying that the only way smaller countries could be 
assured of equitable results in conflicts with larger trading 
partners was through the WTO. 
 
5. Local Ho Chi Minh City officials, led by People\'s Committee 
Chairman Le Thanh Hai, stressed HCMC\'s advantages for Chilean 
investors and business people.  Luong Van Ly of the Department of 
Planning and Investment called Ho Chi Minh City  \"the economic, 
educational, social, and cultural hub of the country.\" 
Encouragingly, he also named transparency as the final target of 
efforts to make the city an attractive destination for investors. 
 
Comment 
------- 
6. While this seminar is unlikely to radically expand Chile- 
Vietnam trade or dramatically accelerate economic reforms here, 
the reminders, from a third-party, that legal reforms are key for 
Vietnam\'s economic success are most welcome.

SUBJECT: HCMC LAND PROTEST: POLICE TURN MOLEHILL INTO MOUNTAIN 
 
REF:  HCMC 00949 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  A protest against land expropriation drew 
extra attention after police attempted to remove ConGen personnel, 
who were observing the protest from the sidelines.   The 
protesters -- illegal migrants, squatters, and legal land owners - 
- whose land had been seized in Ho Chi Minh City\'s District 11, 
had been demonstrating near the municipal People\'s Committee 
offices.  The protest remained peaceful, in spite of police 
overreaction to the presence of a foreign observer.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) On November 4, 2003, Poloff received a tip from another 
ConGen officer who happened to be passing by, that protesters 
(possibly from the Central Highlands, he thought) were 
demonstrating about land issues outside the People\'s Committee 
building.  Poloff and FSN arrived on the scene and found 23 
protesters on the sidewalk surrounded by 14 Vietnamese police 
officers.  Some observers said the protest had included 50-60 
participants earlier in the morning, but had dwindled to half that 
by 10 a.m.  The predominantly female protesters chanted loudly and 
occasionally stopped Vietnamese passersby (but not foreigners) to 
show them their petitions for redress.  Poloff and FSN observed 
from well behind police lines, listening to what was being said, 
and did not attempt to speak with any protesters.  After a few 
minutes, however, the deputy police unit chief demanded that 
Poloff (the only noticeable foreigner) leave the premises.  Poloff 
asked why he was being ordered off a public street and whether any 
laws were being broken.  The officer did not respond, repeatedly 
stating in English that Poloff must leave.  The officer then 
firmly grabbed Poloff by the arm and attempted to forcibly remove 
him.  Poloff was able to pull out his diplomatic ID, at which 
point he was immediately released. 
 
3.  (SBU) This police attempt to physically remove a foreigner 
from the premises drew the attention of several protesters, who 
surrounded Poloff and FSN, trying to explain their complaints. 
Additional police arrived, and three officers began videotaping. 
Another officer tried to intimidate the Pol FSN by shouting 
questions and demanding to see identification.  Vietnamese media 
had also arrived.  The protest was at no time directed against 
U.S. interests, nor were the two ConGen personnel in any danger 
from the protesters.  In fact, some of the women promised \"to 
protect\" them. 
 
4.  (SBU) While police continued to videotape everything and 
closely monitor the situation, three of the protesters said the 
reason for the protest was that approximately 96 households in 
Ward 15 of District 11 had had their land expropriated and 
shanties torn down to make way for a commercial building project. 
Some of those affected are illegal migrants and squatters, who 
were not compensated for their losses and who could not now 
receive legal documentation to work.  Others allegedly were not 
compensated according to what the Compensation Board had judged to 
be fair value.  The protesters clained there was corruption and 
conspiracy involving the developers, the People\'s Committee, and 
\"Sai Gon Giai Phong newspaper\" (HCMC\'s Communist Party daily). 
 
5.  (SBU) COMMENT: Although these protesters did not turn out to 
be from or related to the Central Highlands, in the past, 
activists have taken advantage of upcoming major events to attract 
attention to their causes.  As the Southeast Asia Games approach 
(December 5-13) and the GVN increases its pre-SEA Games \"cleanup\" 
activities (reftel), it is possible other protests may occur. 
Post notes, however, that this group was able to demonstrate with 
little difficulty for several hours, as have other smaller groups 
protesting land issues in HCMC.  In this instance, police 
overreaction to the presence of a foreigner backfired, attracting 
more attention than the protests themselves.  If this \"foreigner\" 
had in fact been a tourist, what impression would he have carried 
away with him about Vietnam?

PROTESTANT CHURCH IN HCMC

1. (SBU) Summary:  In an October 18 meeting with Ambassador at 
Large for International Religious Freedom John Hanford, three 
leaders of the GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical Church of 
Vietnam (SECV) urged continued, focused USG pressure on the GVN to 
relax restrictions on unregistered house churches and pastors.  At 
the same time, they cautioned that designation of Vietnam as a 
Country of Particular Concern (CPC) might prove counterproductive, 
urging that the GVN be given more time to improve its record.  The 
SECV is the only legal Protestant church organization in southern 
Vietnam.  These leaders said their current priorities were to 
reopen closed churches, officially ordain greater numbers of 
practicing pastors (with more freedom to assign them), open a 
bible school in the Central Highlands, and obtain more space for 
the HCMC seminary, which just opened in February 2003.  Ambassador 
Hanford met the following day with HCMC Committee for Religious 
Affairs (CRA) chairman Nguyen Ngoc San, who dismissed recent 
allegations that the government was targeting unregistered 
Protestant house churches in the city. 
 
SECV:  We Need More Pastors, Property, and Permission to Worship 
--------------------------------------------- ------------------- 
2. (SBU) The SECV leaders told Ambassador Hanford they had 
recently given the GVN a list of 214 confiscated properties that 
they wanted returned.  They said they would be happy to take new 
properties in exchange for old properties that were now beyond 
their use.  Ideally, they hoped to get back the old Protestant 
seminary in Nha Trang, which was confiscated by the GVN in 1976. 
The SECV representatives asked Ambassador Hanford to pressure the 
GVN on this specific point.  As an alternative, they mentioned a 
seven-hectare property (10 times the size of the current space 
they currently share with the SECV church and offices) that they 
already own and could build on immediately, without any need for 
outside funding.  The SECV leaders admitted that they had 
compromised in their haste to make a deal to open the seminary in 
HCMC, without waiting for the right conditions.  They thought the 
GVN probably assumed the SECV would forget all about the old Nha 
Trang property once the new seminary opened, but the SECV has not. 
 
3. (SBU) The SECV leaders described a very mixed picture for 
Protestant worship in Vietnam.  While there is generally more 
freedom to worship in urban areas, the situation in the provinces 
can often depend much more on local authorities than on central 
policies.  In the Northwest highlands, they noted, some pastors 
are not allowed to be ordained because they let ethnic minorities 
worship in their house churches.  They also reported stories of 
forced renunciations (including some at gunpoint), beatings, and 
soldiers moving into homes, but it was unclear how they obtained 
this information from the North.  The SECV church leaders said it 
was \"rare\" to have \"terrible things\" like that happen in the 
South.  Still, they complained that many of the 755 pastors who 
had trained \"underground\" had not been ordained in the South, 
despite having been approved by the SECV and the Committee for 
Religious Affairs at the central level.  They blamed delays on the 
provinces, citing the old Vietnamese proverb that, \"The authority 
of the Emperor stops at the village gate.\"  One leader later 
added, \"Maybe the GVN is happy to turn a blind eye to the excesses 
of the provinces.\"  Another said, \"The GVN has the power to make 
the provinces obey.\"  Without providing specifics, the SECV 
representatives noted that Protestants were discriminated against 
in jobs, health care, and education. 
 
4. (SBU) The SECV leaders described a legal Protestant church 
which is more and more willing to challenge the GVN on issues that 
matter, but still reluctant to cross an invisible line.  They said 
the GVN had changed its attitude a bit after SECV Acting President 
Duong Thanh sent a letter to top government and Communist Party 
officials last year urging them to relax restrictions on 
Protestant worship in the Central Highlands.  The government had 
started to make some concessions in words, but had not yet 
followed through.  One example the SECV representatives gave was 
GVN agreement to allow 213 villages in Dak Lak Province to have 
their own churches, and to allow \"branch\" churches outside those 
villages to operate freely pending their own recognition.  The 
SECV leaders are also relying on government promises that the 
Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists, and WEC (Worldwide Evangelism 
Crusade) would soon be allowed to affiliate with the SECV and 
register legal churches.  They emphasized the need to prioritize 
and focus on specific issues in dealing with the GVN. 
 
5. (SBU) All three SECV leaders agreed that designating Vietnam a 
CPC could potentially anger the GVN , maybe even leading to the 
kind of religious persecution that existed 10 years ago.  They 
also cautioned that economic sanctions hurt everyone, including 
Protestants.  (\"When the economy is strong, everyone\'s lives are 
better.\")  They recommended that the USG clearly define priorities 
and come back often to measure progress.  According to them, 
setting deadlines is a useful tool, but not if they forced the 
U.S. to actually designate Vietnam as a CPC.  The SECV leaders 
urged Ambassador Hanford to devise a \"pending\" CPC list in order 
\"to threaten\" the GVN.  Ambassador Hanford reminded the SECV Board 
members that he had already set a six-month deadline back in 
November 2002 for progress on the release of religious prisoners, 
the opening of closed churches, and new church registration. 
Unlike many other violations of religious freedom in Vietnam, 
these sorts of restrictive actions did not leave much room for 
flexibility in avoiding CPC designation.  The SECV leaders called 
on the U.S. to continue applying constant, steady pressure on the 
GVN, but to be careful to \"avoid the impression that (you are) 
working in concert with the SECV.\"  In the end, however, at least 
two of the three leaders agreed with Ambassador Hanford\'s proposal 
that he give the GVN a second chance, but indicate it was likely 
Vietnam would be designated if there were not significant 
improvement within a short period of time, e.g., about six months. 
 
CRA:  Rules are Rules 
--------------------- 
6. (SBU) Meeting on Sunday, October 19, with Mr. Nguyen Ngoc San, 
chairman of the HCMC Committee for Religious Affairs, Ambassador 
Hanford stressed that he was here to find a way -- for the good of 
the bilateral relationship -- to avoid having to designate Vietnam 
as a CPC.  Mr. San responded with the usual figures on the growth 
of religious worship in HCMC, and the official policy line that 
everyone is free to worship on their own (ref A).  He described 
his role as one of facilitating religious practice, while \"helping 
government officials in the city carry out their duties.\" 
Ambassador Hanford assured Mr. San that HCMC has a better 
reputation for religious freedom than elsewhere in Vietnam, which 
made more troubling the occasional reports of disruption of 
religious services, confiscation of religious materials, and 
imposition of fines for religious activities.  Mr. San noted that 
there had been dramatic increases in the frequency of travel by 
religious leaders, with some traveling six to seven times per 
year, as well as in the number of religious publications approved 
by the CRA. 
 
7. (SBU) Discussing three recent cases affecting Protestant house 
churches in the city which have garnered attention overseas, CRA 
chairman San justified government actions which were in accordance 
with existing administrative regulations, and faulted the 
congregations instead.  In the case of the Thu Thiem church in 
District 2 (ref B), he noted, the municipal government had allowed 
the church to stand, even though it was constructed illegally 
without a permit.  For the Full Gospel Assembly Church in District 
11 (ref C), he accused church members of having organized a prayer 
service without permission.  The house church in Binh Khanh, Can 
Gio (ref D) was also illegally constructed, he said.  It was torn 
down as part of a wider move to \"restore public order\" to 
residential construction (frequently done without building 
permits), and was done only after giving adequate notice. 
Ambassador Hanford reminded the CRA chairman of the importance of 
allowing even those denominations who do not wish to register to 
worship freely.  Mr. San reiterated GVN policy that religion 
should be practiced only in appropriately designated houses of 
worship or at home.  But he pointed to support for several 
Protestant denominations that have yet to be approved for 
registration, such as the Baptists and Seventh Day Adventists, as 
proof of the government\'s flexibility.  He also presented the 
(somewhat novel) argument that it was necessary to regulate the 
many Protestant denominations in order to avoid traffic congestion 
and noise pollution.  He assured Ambassador Hanford that HCMC 
would soon see more religious services in foreign languages to 
accommodate the many expatriates in the city. 
 
8. (SBU) Mr. San told Ambassador Hanford the GVN was eager to 
facilitate the training needs of all religions in order to ensure 
quality leaders.  Toward that end, he was supportive of efforts to 
expand the cramped facilities of the new SECV seminary.  He also 
expressed support for more one-month basic training courses, 
similar to those that had been conducted since 1993, eight years 
before the GVN officially recognized the SECV.  Mr. San indicated 
there might be some movement toward opening a long awaited seventh 
Catholic seminary, but thought it preferable to utilize the former 
seminary property at 6 bis Ton Duc Thang (confiscated by the GVN 
in 1975), rather than locate new premises in Dong Nai Province. 
He claimed to be unaware of any government efforts to block the 
ordination of SECV pastors, saying he had just received a list of 
ten and approved them all.  The CRA\'s only concern, he claimed, 
was for none of the candidates to have a criminal record.  He also 
denied knowledge of any restrictions on the assignment of SECV 
pastors, outside of the usual administrative requirements for 
changing one\'s household registration. 
 
9. (SBU) Responding to a question on confiscated properties, the 
CRA chairman  observed that properties formerly operated as 
hospitals and schools by various religious groups would continue 
to be utilized by the GVN for those same functions, but for the 
welfare of everyone.  For other types of buildings, such as 
churches and offices, GVN policy was to return the property, pay 
cash compensation, or provide property of equivalent value.  He 
said only four such properties remained in government hands: 6 bis 
Ton Duc Thang, 171 Ly Thuc Thang, 43 Nguyen Thang, and 320 Le Van 
Sy.  Asked about the former Protestant church across the street 
from the Consulate at 2 bis Le Duan (ref E), he said he was 
unaware of a confiscated property at that address, but would check 
into it.  He declined to comment officially on the return of the 
seminary in Nha Trang, as it lies geographically outside the 
borders of his jurisdiction, but he seemed certain it would be 
returned one day soon, now that the GVN had recognized the SECV. 
 
10. (SBU) Mr. San used the same technique to deflect concerns over 
recent government action (ref F) against leaders of the banned 
Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV).  He pointed out that 
since the UBCV was not itself a legal organization, it was not 
permissible to organize religious or organizational activities 
under that name.  When the leaders of the outlawed group were 
found to be in possession of \"state secrets\" following their 
illegal organizational meeting in Quy Nhon, the GVN had no choice 
but to \"administratively detain\" those involved.  Oddly enough, he 
said that only Thich Tue Sy, Thich Thanh Huyen, and Thich Nguyen 
Ly had been administratively detained in HCMC, pending further 
investigation, while UBCV Deputy Thich Quang Do was not.  Asked if 
USG officials could meet with Thich Quang Do, however, he advised 
that Thich Quang Do was still under investigation and hoped the 
USG would be patient during this \"sensitive time.\"  He promised to 
\"create favorable conditions\" for such a visit as soon as 
practicable. 
 
11.  (U)  Ambassador Hanford did not have a chance to clear this 
cable before his departure.

SUBJECT: MIXED PICTURE ON HOUSE CHURCHES IN AMBASSADOR HANFORD\'S 
MEETINGS WITH HCMC PROTESTANTS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0766  B) HCMC 0836  C) HCMC 0933 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  In meetings with several Protestant house 
church pastors and \"victims\" of religious oppression during his 
visit to HCMC, Ambassador at Large for Religious Freedom John 
Hanford heard several credible-sounding reports of arrests, 
beatings, forced renunciations, and church closures.  Other 
reports seemed less credible, or were based more on secondhand 
information.  ConGen had arranged for three sessions with local 
contacts in the Protestant community to give various informal 
groupings and denominations equal time.  Unfortunately, one group 
inexplicably sent their \"victims\" back to the Central Highlands 
the night before the meeting, saying they had not been able to 
contact the local HCMC pastor who was assisting with arrangements. 
Septels report on Ambassador Hanford\'s official meetings in HCMC 
and Hanoi, and his trip to the Central Highlands.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The first individual in group one was an ethnic minority 
woman who claimed to have been persecuted for many years with her 
husband in Kon Tum Province because their house had been used as a 
meeting place for Protestant worship.  Her allegations of abuse 
included at least two beatings by police, and several close 
escapes after being warned by friends.  (The HCMC pastor who had 
invited her to the meeting and was present throughout her 
testimony told  Ambassador Hanford that he knew of another pastor 
who was beaten for visiting the couple in their village.)  While 
her husband had been beaten on the head, she said that all of her 
wounds were internal and left no scars.  She knew nothing of her 
husband\'s current condition, as they had been \"forced to live 
apart\" in Dong Nai Province (next door to HCMC), to avoid being 
picked up by security agents.  Local officials had also \"told\" 
them to renounce their faith, on the grounds that they were the 
only Protestants in a village of Catholics. 
 
3. (SBU) As the story emerged, it was clarified that most of the 
hardships she and her husband had endured were at the hands of 
Catholic neighbors, although she believes the villagers acted on 
the instructions of local officials.  She and her husband were not 
\"forced\" to renounce their faith and never did.  She said she and 
her husband were actually living apart to make it less likely that 
they would be questioned for living in Dong Nai Province without 
residence permits (since Dong Nai is a haven for economic migrants 
looking for jobs), not because they believed the police were 
actively searching for them.  The HCMC pastor added that the 
police are always on the lookout for ethnic minorities in HCMC, 
and while she would be safer among her own people, her community 
would not accept her.  As to whether other Protestants in the 
Central Highlands suffered similar treatment, she did not know. 
She told Ambassador Hanford she would not be comfortable with him 
raising her case directly with the GVN, despite the fact that she 
was the subject of a written appeal to the international community 
listing the names of her local tormentors. 
 
4. (SBU) The second person invited by the same HCMC pastor was a 
young woman who claimed to have been expelled from a university in 
HCMC, along with three classmates, for sharing their faith back in 
2001.  (A total of 13 students had been implicated, but nine had 
already graduated.)  She said that she and a friend had been 
\"sharing the gospel\" by handing out pamphlets and talking to 
people in a park near her school back in 2000 when the police 
arrested her friend.  The friend spent the night in jail and was 
beaten by a drunken policeman.  The next day, police confiscated 
their religious materials.  When the police later gave the list of 
students involved in this \"illegal activity\" to the school in 
2001, the four remaining students were expelled.  The written 
documents this woman provided, which had already been given to 
Ambassador Hanford by a contact in Bangkok, charged the students 
with \"disseminating religious materials.\"  (Note: It is illegal in 
Vietnam to proselytize.)  The former student is currently teaching 
English, but has yet to resume her studies for fear she will not 
be accepted by any university in Vietnam.  She, too, requested 
that Ambassador Hanford not use her name in discussions with the 
GVN.  The HCMC pastor told Ambassador Hanford that 42 students 
meeting for religious worship last year at Easter had been 
arrested, repeatedly questioned, and made to write confessions 
before they were expelled. 
 
5. (SBU) The last speaker in this first group was a pastor whose 
weekday worship service at a house church in HCMC\'s District 11 
earlier this year had deteriorated into a physical confrontation 
with police who were trying to check the identification cards of 
those present (ref A).  He too claimed to have been beaten, but 
only on the top of his head.  In the course of briefing Ambassador 
Hanford on the specific sequence of events, including his 
subsequent arrest, he volunteered that he had actually struck the 
first blow, punching a policemen in the face twice when he 
wouldn\'t allow him to leave the house in order to take his wife to 
the hospital. 
 
6. (SBU) In response to Ambassador Hanford\'s request for advice on 
designating Vietnam a Country of Particular Concern (CPC), the 
pastor leading the group warned that backing the GVN into a corner 
could make it retaliate.  At the same time, he said things could 
not possibly ever get as bad as they were 15 years ago, so 
Protestant leaders were not afraid.  He said the GVN had recently 
started using dangerous new methods that were difficult to detect. 
For example, security operatives had poisoned many Protestants, 
including some who had sought refuge in Cambodia.  They were never 
the same again mentally.  Some had died within a matter of months. 
He hoped that Ambassador Hanford would tell the GVN that the U.S. 
would only work with Vietnam if there was real religious freedom, 
including for house churches.  The GVN had closed many churches 
since 1975, and not allowed any of them to reopen.  Without real 
churches, believers had had no choice but to form house churches 
over the years.  Now they realized that registration with the GVN 
brought too many restrictions, like those faced by the government- 
recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV). 
According to this pastor, house church pastors are in fact freer 
to move from place to place.  The pastor from District 11 echoed 
this sentiment, noting that the house church movement had trained 
thousands of pastors over the years without GVN permission, and 
those pastors are freer to lead their churches than the pastors 
belonging to the legal church. 
 
7. (SBU) Since what would have been the second group had sent its 
victims/witnesses back to the provinces, Ambassador Hanford met 
the third group at the home of a pastor who was once affiliated 
with the SECV, but later returned to the house church movement to 
gain greater independence.  During the nearly four-hour meeting in 
his home, he left for a couple hours to conduct a Sunday evening 
worship service in the church atop his downtown HCMC shop house. 
This pastor told Ambassador Hanford he was preparing a thick file 
outlining the difficulties faced by house churches and would send 
it to the GVN, selected foreign governments, and NGOs in early 
2004.  He cautioned that religious freedom meant more than just 
stopping persecution, however.  He looked forward to the day when 
Protestants could broadcast their messages freely over TV and 
radio, and preach openly on the sidewalks.  He presented 
Ambassador Hanford with six CD-ROMs detailing government abuses. 
He noted that since the GVN knows Protestant leaders can place 
documentary evidence on the Internet, government officials were 
relying more on oral communication to hide their tracks.  They had 
also adopted more cunning methods for dealing with dissent, such 
as letting other prisoners beat up religious prisoners in jail, 
rather than having government officials do the dirty work. 
 
8. (SBU) Also present at the pastor\'s home were several relatives 
of imprisoned Catholic Priest Nguyen Van Ly.  One relative, who 
has probably had the most contact with Father Ly since his 
imprisonment, suggested the cleric was being held in solitary 
confinement and slowly poisoned.  (Father Ly had told him once 
that prison staff often held food the family sent for several 
weeks, giving them ample time to tamper with it.)  The relative 
based his conclusion on the fact that Father Ly had seemed quite 
angry and \"different\" when he last visited him in June 2003. 
According to this relative, Father Ly called for his niece and 
nephews to confess their crimes (ref B) and talked about other 
\"strange things\", such as \"seeing the Lord.\"  The relative was 
never allowed to be alone with Father Ly, and had only been 
permitted to stay 20 minutes the last time, as opposed to the 
usual hour.  The relative also believed the GVN was out to punish 
Father Ly\'s entire family for his outspokenness, although he 
acknowledged the two nephews currently in prison in HCMC had 
indeed communicated with people in the U.S. regarding Father Ly\'s 
case and tried to visit Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam leader 
Thich Huyen Quang.  He said some people in Hue had been paid the 
equivalent of USD$10 to make false statements about Father Ly and 
his family, including accounts that his niece, Mrs. Nguyen Thi 
Hoa, was involved in the drug trade.  Asked about the apparent 
reluctance of the Catholic Church to support the jailed priest, he 
responded that the Bishop of Father Ly\'s former diocese had 
demonstrated quiet support by failing to appoint a successor to 
his parish. 
 
9. (SBU) Another pastor in this third group, well-known for his 
involvement in organizing resistance to GVN oppression in the 
Protestant community, said the Communists were very \"wicked,\" and 
employed \"subtle\" techniques to control the people.  Religious 
practice was only allowed up to a level where it could be 
controlled.  He accused an unnamed member of the SECV Council of 
Dignitaries of being a secret agent for the government.  He 
alleged that this individual had shaped the SECV Charter in order 
to allow for GVN control and had informed on many pastors.  This 
agent had also at one time been a member of a \"killing team,\" 
which had killed people right before the pastor\'s very eyes some 
20 years ago.  The pastor described a new Communist Party of 
Vietnam (CPV) document, allegedly signed by Prime Minister Phan 
Van Khai, which called on officials to tighten up restrictions on 
religion by January 2004.  House churches would be forced to join 
the SECV so that the GVN could control their activities.  Churches 
which refused to follow CPV guidelines would not be allowed to 
register.  In his most startling statement of the evening, he said 
that while the government forced many Protestant to confess 
falsely to being followers of the Dega separatist movement, he 
estimated that fully 10 percent of all churches in the Central 
Highlands were Dega churches.  (Post Note: We say startling 
because in the past, the Dega separatist movement has always been 
described as small.) 
 
10. (SBU) This pastor brought several other individuals to meet 
with Ambassador Hanford, the first of whom was a young man whose 
father had been arrested two years ago.  The father was an ethnic 
Ede pastor in the Central Highlands who had disappeared without a 
trace after leaving for HCMC in the wake of the violent 
demonstrations that shook the region in early 2001.  While it was 
unclear whether or not he knew for sure that his father had been 
arrested, or where he was being held, the family had had no 
contact with the father since.  The father\'s church had about 200 
members at the time of the demonstrations, but is now meeting in 
smaller groups under the care of another pastor.  The son said he 
had heard of many forced renunciations and disappearances among 
the ethnic H\'mong in the Northwest Highlands, but had no firsthand 
knowledge or specific information to share. 
 
11. (SBU) Two people from the small Protestant house church that 
was recently torn down in HCMC\'s Can Gio District (ref C) were 
also present.  They told Ambassador Hanford that while local 
officials had justified the destruction in the name of a public 
campaign to \"restore public order in construction,\" this was 
really a ruse to target their church.  When police had come in the 
middle of a worship service and levied a fine for the illegal 
construction, the congregation had asked if they would be allowed 
to continue worshipping there if they paid.  When the police said 
no, they refused to pay.  Sometime later, the police returned to 
remove the structure.  The two members acknowledged that they had 
built their church without a construction permit, but pointed out 
that other structures leveled in the \"public order\" campaign were 
more than 300 meters away.  In addition, they said no one in that 
area ever obtained building permits.  In fact, they had 
specifically chosen to build their church in the middle of an 
isolated area to avoid attention, although they mounted a cross on 
the building\'s front. 
 
12. (SBU) In response to Ambassador Hanford\'s request for guidance 
on possible CPC designation, two other pastors present thought he 
should press for more legal international worship services and 
permission for foreign missionaries to preach.  Ambassador Hanford 
outlined his intention to push for release of prisoners, an end to 
forced renunciations, the reopening of closed churches, and 
official recognition for all churches that wanted to affiliate 
with the SECV.  The pastors from this third group noted that the 
SECV churches had given up their freedom when they registered, and 
that their very existence had given the GVN a reason to 
discriminate against the house churches.  They were certain they 
would never want to register with the GVN -- even if they could do 
so independently of the SECV.  They believe there are too many 
differences in doctrine for the many house churches in the Central 
Highlands to group themselves under a single organization.  They 
said their preferred, \"most realistic option\" would be to pressure 
the GVN to allow all churches in the Central Highlands to register 
independently, if they so desired. 
 
13. (SBU) Comment:  Overall, this very full day of meetings 
provided a wealth of information on current government 
restrictions on religious activity in southern Vietnam.  At the 
same time, the meetings revealed some of the problems inherent in 
relying on indirect sources.  Claims of poisonings, beatings, 
disappearances, and forced renunciations can be very compelling 
and emotional.  But the facts, when available, do not always 
support the claims, which therefore need to be backed up by solid 
evidence if they are to be credible when raised with our GVN 
interlocutors.  Speculation on GVN motives by those so far outside 
the prevailing system is also of limited utility.  Post notes 
these particular pastors have had several opportunities to present 
solid evidence to back up claims of recent abuses, and have in 
fact assured ConGenoffs the evidence was \"in the mail\", so to 
speak.  Mostly they have chosen to present secondhand reports of 
the same allegations that are carried in the reports of various 
NGOs.  Also worth noting is that most of the cases raised during 
these meetings were not current, and some cases were only 
tangentially related to freedom of religion.  Such cases can 
undermine our credibility when we seek to make our points on 
violations of religious freedom with the GVN. 
 
14.  (SBU)  While it seems that the situation is not as bleak as 
some groups suggest, it is also far from being as rosy as GVN 
officials often insist.  The GVN is highly suspicious of 
Protestant house churches in the Central Highlands, even when 
there may be no evidence that a specific church is affiliated with 
the Dega movement.  The GVN must do a far better job of educating 
and controlling local officials in order to prevent abuses.  For 
the most part, the GVN allows worship in registered churches, 
regardless of the denomination, and grants freedom of religion to 
individuals and family members living together to worship at home. 
For those groups who wish to gather without prior permission in 
house churches and other, less formal settings however, the 
situation remains unpredictable and difficult.  There is great 
variation in local practice, which may involve significant 
individual vulnerability, even in HCMC.  Any activity perceived as 
being a challenge to Communist Party rule, especially if linked to 
outside groups with a political agenda (such as recent meetings by 
the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam), is likely to cause a 
harsh reaction. 
15.  (U)  Ambassador Hanford did not have an opportunity to clear 
this cable prior to his departure.

SUBJECT: BALANCING ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY IN SOC TRANG AND 
TRA VINH 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  DCM (then Charge) and ConGen Poloff visited Soc 
Trang and Tra Vinh Provinces during October 1-3, to examine 
firsthand the situation for the ethnic Khmer in the Mekong Delta, 
in light of continuing reports of discrimination from sources 
overseas.  Situated in an area that once belonged to Cambodia, 
these two coastal provinces have large Khmer populations.  But 
while these are both relatively poor, underdeveloped provinces, 
the ethnic Khmer seem to be faring no worse than anyone else. 
Both provinces depend heavily on wet rice agriculture and 
aquaculture, but are hoping to diversify if infrastructure can be 
improved.  During his trip, the DCM had an opportunity to speak 
with provincial officials, Buddhist, Protestant and Catholic 
leaders, local businessmen, and ordinary Khmer residents.  For 
their part, the officials seemed committed to sharing any new 
wealth fairly among the ethnic Khmer and the majority Vietnamese 
Kinh.  The Khmer, meanwhile, seemed well integrated and raised no 
allegations of ethnic strife.  The Khmer language and culture, 
including Khmer Buddhist practices, appeared to be flourishing. 
End summary. 
 
------------------------------- 
JUST BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE 
------------------------------- 
2. (U) Soc Trang covers an area of just over 3200 square 
kilometers, including 72 kilometers of coastline.  Ethnic Khmer 
number 340,000 (28 percent) out of a total population of 1.2 
million.  There are also 65,000 ethnic Chinese.  Just up the 
coast, Tra Vinh occupies a land area of 2228 square kilometers, 
with 65 kilometers of coastline.  The population of one million 
includes 300,000 (30 percent) ethnic Khmer.  Most Khmer in the two 
provinces are rice farmers, but some have begun to venture into 
more lucrative fields, such as shrimp farming and cattle raising. 
Of the two provincial capitals, Tra Vinh seemed the tidier, 
cleaner, and more prosperous town.  The town is well-known for its 
many old trees.  Roads in both provinces were narrow and often 
choked by even mild two-way traffic. 
 
3. (U) Agriculture and aquaculture account for over 50 percent of 
economic activity in the two provinces.  Soc Trang fares slightly 
better, with annual yields of 1.6 million tons of rice and 56,000 
tons of sea products.  Five local seafood-processing plants handle 
nearly 30,000 tons, with the remainder processed by individual 
farmers and fishermen for sale to exporters.  Four of the five are 
in private hands, including the largest, which processed over 
USD$80 million in sea products last year.  Soc Trang already ranks 
just behind Ca Mau as the largest seafood exporter in the country. 
Provincial leaders hope to expand shrimp farming from 48,000 to 
nearly 80,000 hectares over the next few years.  This would raise 
output to 72,000 tons (worth an estimated USD$480 million) by 
2005.  Having recognized the ecological shortcomings of flooding 
rice fields with saltwater to create shrimp ponds, local 
authorities are looking for more natural methods.  Overall 
economic growth in the province exceeded 8 percent last year. 
Annual per capita income was slightly lower than the national 
average, at USD$379. 
 
4. (U) Tra Vinh, meanwhile, produced 1.2 million tons of rice, but 
many local Khmer farmers are moving from rice to sugar cane and 
livestock.  Like its neighbor, Tra Vinh is trying to exploit its 
coastal location for aquaculture.  Unfortunately, Tra Vinh has 
only half as much available area for shrimp farming as Soc Trang, 
and is hampered by the constant tidal mixing of fresh, salty, and 
brackish water.  Despite those drawbacks, economic growth reached 
almost 10 percent last year, raising per capita incomes to just 
under USD$350 per year. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
NO CAPITAL, NO FDI, AND NO WAY TO GET THERE FROM HERE 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
5. (SBU) Despite this relative good fortune, the two provinces 
still have a long way to go to provide true economic opportunity 
and a decent standard of living to all their inhabitants.  Neither 
province currently has much to offer in the way of manufacturing 
or services, although both are eager to attract American 
investment, development assistance, and NGO activity.  Soc Trang 
People\'s Committee Chairman Huynh Thanh Hiep told DCM he had just 
submitted a proposal to the central government for a new 150 
hectare industrial park with deep water port facilities and was 
looking at ways to get funding for a new marketplace to revitalize 
the provincial capital\'s downtown commercial area.  The industrial 
park would host mostly food processors.  The deep water port, a 
floating transit point in the Dinh An Estuary, was expected to 
move 10,000 tons of freight.  Mr. Hiep said the American Chamber 
of Commerce in HCMC had recently referred one American investor 
for the project. 
 
6. (SBU) Chairman Hiep bemoaned the difficulties of mobilizing 
sufficient capital to achieve the desired level of growth, noting 
that the province received the equivalent of only USD$10 million 
per year from the national government.  Director Kien of the 
Department of Planning and Investment noted that Soc Trang was 
still at the stage of development where all available funds go 
immediately to upgrading infrastructure and improving the general 
welfare of the people.  He said Soc Trang\'s only foreign direct 
investment project was about to close down because the Taiwanese 
investor was unable to compete with similar factories in HCMC. 
Over dinner, Chairman Hiep acknowledged the good work of many 
international NGOs in the province, including some from the U.S. 
He hoped some benefit might flow to the province if airports in Ca 
Mau and Can Tho were to reopen.  He also thought Can Tho\'s pending 
reclassification as an independently administered city might 
spread the wealth to nearby Delta provinces like Soc Trang.  (Post 
Note:  Designation as a special administrative city -- Hanoi, 
HCMC, Danang, and Haiphong -- confers some degree of autonomy on a 
municipality in terms of taxes, budget priorities, land use, and 
project licensing approvals.  In essence, it makes the city a 
province in and of itself.  End note.) 
 
7. (SBU) Tra Vinh People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Tran Hoang Kim 
noted that industry represented only 10 percent of his province\'s 
economic output, centered mostly on food processing -- shrimp, 
coconut, and sugar cane.  Vice Chairman Kim (a three-time delegate 
to the National Assembly before the current session) is intent on 
locating garment and textile factories in Tra Vinh, but 
acknowledged serious problems with transporting raw materials and 
finished goods.  Even with three highways crisscrossing the 
province, waterborne transportation was still the only way to move 
large shipments.  Hong-Viet, a small joint venture with a Hong 
Kong company, just signed a contract with a larger HCMC firm and 
plans to expand from 600 to 2000 workers in the near future. 
Another private firm is expected to start producing garments by 
the end of this year. 
 
8. (SBU) Vice Chairman Kim said there had been little effect on 
his province from the Bilateral Trade Agreement with the U.S., 
even with the subsequent increase in the volume of trade.  He did 
think WTO accession would have a positive effect on Vietnam\'s 
exports, however, and was not worried about competition from 
foreign agricultural producers.  In the longer term, bridges 
spanning three of the \"Nine Dragons\" of the Mekong River, 
scheduled for completion in 2007 and 2008, would make the province 
more attractive to manufacturers.  Mr. Kim said he hoped 
Vietnamese-Americans with expertise in shrimp farming would view 
Tra Vinh as a good place to invest. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
SEAFOOD PRODUCT PROCESSING AND SOLAR ENERGY 
------------------------------------------- 
9. (SBU) In Tra Vinh, the DCM toured the high-tech shrimp 
processing line of the Cuu Long Sea Products Company.  Director 
Nguyen Van Bang -- a 1985 Can Tho University graduate, who joined 
the company a year later, and worked his way up through the ranks 
-- said the company had just begun shipping frozen seafood (mostly 
tiger shrimp) to the east and west coasts of the U.S. in 2000. 
Sixty percent of their product went to the U.S. in 2001, and 50 
percent in 2002.  Total turnover was up from USD$13 million in 
2001 to over USD$18 million in the first nine months of 2003.  Cuu 
Long employs 900 workers, including 100 Khmer.  The workers enjoy 
excellent working conditions, including wages at almost twice the 
provincial average, twice yearly medical examinations, and free 
lunches.  The company buys mostly from small fishermen and shrimp 
farmers.  This state-owned company is in the process of 
privatizing, and plans to hold its first shareholder conference in 
January 2004.  Looking toward expanding exports to Eastern Europe, 
Director Bang described the difficulties of having to truck his 
products to HCMC in freezer trucks for shipment. 
 
10. (SBU) The DCM also had an opportunity to travel to a remote 
Tra Vinh village with the regional representative of U.S.-based 
SELCO (Solar Electric Light Company).  The company, which also 
does business in India and Sri Lanka, targets customers not 
connected to the national power grid.  The company is still not 
profitable in Vietnam, with sales of only 1448 solar energy units 
over the past two years, but estimates show potentially 20 million 
families in Vietnam still relying on generator or battery power. 
The target market is families earning USD$70 per month, considered 
sufficient to pay the required USD$9 per month for financing. 
(Loans are arranged through the Bank for Agricultural 
Reconstruction and Development.  The default rate is approximately 
18 percent.)  One major obstacle to greater sales is that not many 
families can afford the USD$200 down payment on the USD$900 solar 
unit, at least not without help from their families overseas. 
Another problem is illegal wires strung from distant power lines 
to rural homes (in full view of the retinue of provincial 
officials who joined the DCM for the tour), which obviate the need 
to purchase a SELCO unit.  SELCO officials complained that they 
are also hamstrung by excessive red tape, such as the requirement 
that the provincial People\'s Committee sign off on every loan 
application.  The local Women\'s Union is often helpful in pushing 
loan applications through the Committee in a reasonable amount of 
time. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
JUSTIFIABLY PROUD OF THEMSELVES VIS-A-VIS THE KHMER? 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
11. (SBU) Provincial leaders in both provinces spoke proudly of 
their efforts to raise the living standards of the Khmer 
population to the level of their Vietnamese Kinh neighbors.  They 
attributed any lingering economic disparities to differences in 
educational attainment and family size, and dismissed allegations 
of discrimination as untrue.  As proof of the efficacy of their 
efforts, Chairman Hiep pointed out that the number of Khmer 
families under the poverty line had dropped from 64 percent to 
just 18 percent in little more than 10 years.  This was just five 
points higher than the poverty level for the province overall. 
The poverty rate for Tra Vinh has dropped from 40 percent to 19 
percent since 1992.  Both provinces had relied heavily on funds 
available from the central government under Program 135, started 
in 1999 to help eliminate poverty among the ethnic minorities. 
According to Vice Chairman Kim, the program was responsible for 
3301 projects in Tra Vinh over the past four years, valued at more 
than USD$5.1 million.  He spoke of the importance of 
infrastructure upgrades in terms of improving Khmer farmers\' 
ability to get their goods to market without being exploited by 
Kinh middlemen. 
 
12. (SBU) Provincial officials also ran through the usual litany 
of programs available to ethnic minority groups throughout the 
country, such as small grants and loans, and free medical care. 
Ethnic minority students are eligible to receive a free education 
through the secondary level at provincial ethnic minority boarding 
schools.  Elementary level boarding schools are located in each 
district.  Successful graduates are able to enter university 
without sitting for the national entrance examination.  Families 
pay only expenses, while the government covers tuition.  Of the 
100 secondary school graduates in Tra Vinh each year, 40 enroll in 
some sort of vocational training, while 30 go on to university. 
The majority return to work in the local government.  (Fifty 
percent of the teachers at the boarding school are ethnic Khmer.) 
Khmer pagodas also conduct primary education classes, equivalent 
to Grades 1-5.  Chairman Hiep hoped to convert a 3500-student 
continuing education center/teacher training college into a 
community college for Soc Trang in the near future, while Tra Vinh 
has just established a community college with Canadian assistance. 
Bilingual education is widely available in both provinces, as are 
Khmer-language print and broadcast media. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
SPEAKING OF RELIGION AND CULTURAL PRESERVATION 
--------------------------------------------- - 
13. (SBU) While in Tra Vinh, the DCM visited the Southern 
Secondary Pali Supplementary Education School, the only 
institution of its kind in Vietnam.  The two monks serving as 
Director and Deputy Director were clearly nervous to be speaking 
to what they described as the first diplomats to ever visit the 
institution, and read mostly from prepared briefing papers. 
Established in 1994, under the supervision of the Ministry of 
Education and Training, the school is funded by the central GVN 
and charges no tuition.  The four-year course provides the 
equivalent of a Grade 6-12 education in 11 subjects.  A special 
Khmer Ethnic Minority Committee sitting in Can Tho Province is 
responsible for recruiting students each year from all over 
southern Vietnam.  More than 500 students have enrolled in the 
school over the past nine years.  Graduates are expected to either 
return to their local pagodas to teach in primary education 
programs, or else continue their studies at the university level. 
The Director cited frequent exchanges between Theravada monks in 
Soc Trang, Cambodia, and Burma, and said religious texts were 
often exchanged as well, although these had to be cleared by the 
provincial Committee for Religious Affairs. 
 
14. (SBU) According to officials in both provinces, the Khmer tend 
to cluster near Theravada Buddhist pagodas (92 in Soc Trang and 
110 in Tra Vinh), but don\'t physically separate themselves from 
the Vietnamese Kinh or Chinese.  As is common in the Theravada 
tradition, most Khmer males in the two provinces become monks at 
some point, most often for two or three years prior to military 
training.  The DCM toured several Khmer pagodas, speaking to monks 
and ordinary Khmer residents, and elicited no complaints of 
discrimination or limitations on religious worship.  Mission 
officers frequently heard local residents speaking Khmer with one 
another.  Two Khmers from each province sit on the current 
National Assembly.  One of them serves on the legislative body\'s 
Commission on Ethnic Minority Affairs.  Khmers also fill many of 
the People\'s Committee slots at the district level. 
 
15. (SBU) Protestants and Catholics also seem to benefit from the 
emphasis that both provincial governments place on harmony.  There 
are seven legal Protestant churches registered with the GVN- 
recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) in Soc 
Trang, and two in Tra Vinh.  Protestants not wanting to worship at 
these churches are free to worship at home.  ConGenoff visited one 
of Tra Vinh\'s two Protestant churches on a main street during an 
evening service.  According to the pastor and members of the 
congregation, there are fewer than 500 Protestants in Tra Vinh, 
including 200 Khmer.  Only 100 gathered in this particular church 
every Sunday, but the pastor visited others in outlying areas for 
smaller services in their homes on a regular basis.  The 
congregation reported no problems with freedom to worship, but did 
complain that the government had never returned a confiscated 
school on the church compound.  Otherwise, they found Tra Vinh 
officials to be cooperative and accommodating.  The congregation 
was in the process of building a new church to replace the 
existing structure (built in 1945), but was dependent on funding 
by mostly Korean benefactors. 
 
16. (SBU) The DCM and ConGenoff also visited one of three large 
Catholic churches in Tra Vinh that had been constructed by the 
French in the early 20th century.  While the buildings themselves 
were quite ornate, they were in need of renovation and 
maintenance.  According to the priest with whom we spoke, the 
church serves 5000 parishioners, with an overflow crowd on 
Sundays.  The last French priest had left in 1954, but the current 
number of Vietnamese priests is sufficient to serve the parish. 
The priest regretfully said there was not much to do anymore, 
since the school had been confiscated and the church was unable to 
undertake charitable activities. 
 
------- 
COMMENT 
------- 
17. (SBU) We were encouraged to see that the ethnic Khmer 
communities in both Soc Trang and Tra Vinh appear to be thriving 
culturally, if not economically.  While one expects to hear 
nothing but good things from provincial officials, the ordinary 
Khmer we encountered told consistent, unforced stories of equal 
opportunity and social and religious tolerance.  These will 
probably never be among the richest provinces in Vietnam, but the 
provincial governments seem to be taking the right steps to 
exploit whatever opportunities are available. 
 
18. (SBU) Of the two provinces, Tra Vinh would seem to be slightly 
more open to new ideas, as witnessed by the three foreign business 
delegations meeting with local officials in our hotel.  In 
general, the provincial leadership in Soc Trang was a bit more 
uptight, reading carefully from prepared scripts with talking 
points on \"hostile forces\" and the Vietnam Human Rights Act.  Just 
up the coast in Tra Vinh, meanwhile, Vice Chairman Kim actually 
started the meeting off with an offer to dispense with the usual 
scripted briefing and go right into the discussion.  He was 
animated and excited to be talking about his province.  Taking his 
leave at lunch for a trip to Hanoi, he said he was glad we had 
made the trip to see for ourselves that allegations of 
discrimination were untrue and that the provincial administration 
was committed to helping the Khmer.

SUBJECT: CA MAU PROVINCE: AT THE END OF THE LINE, BUT BLESSED BY 
UNCLE HO 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  Lying at the southern tip of Vietnam, Ca Mau 
is one of the country\'s more isolated provinces.  Heavily 
dependent upon aquaculture, especially shrimp, the province has 
enjoyed strong recent economic growth.  While the province 
actively touts its natural resources and advantages, it has 
received little foreign direct investment, and plans for economic 
diversification are vague, with many projects being run by the 
central government in Hanoi.  Based on discussions with provincial 
officials, as well as reports from Protestant leaders in HCMC, the 
province has yet to make its peace with unregistered Protestant 
house churches, an issue DPO discussed at length with the heads of 
the Union of Friendship Organizations and the Committee for 
Religious Affairs (CRA) during a recent visit to the province. 
DPO and Poloff also met with Ca Mau People\'s Committee Chairman Vo 
Thanh Binh; representatives of the provincial Department of 
Planning and Investment (DPI); and leadership from the Department 
of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DOLISA).  This was 
ConGen\'s first official visit to Ca Mau since 1998.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) As Vietnam\'s southernmost province, Ca Mau lays claim to 
the country\'s longest seacoast, largest underwater forest (second 
largest in the world after the Amazon), and largest area for 
aquaculture.  Aquaculture, especially shrimp, composes the bulk of 
Ca Mau\'s economy.  In the first nine months of 2003, Ca Mau 
exported 60 tons of aquaculture products, including 45 tons of 
shrimp (worth $350 million), primarily to the U.S. and Japan.  Ca 
Mau\'s private sector exports a total of 56 products to the U.S. 
market.  The provincial poverty rate, according to September 2003 
estimates, is below 10 percent.  The population is primarily 
ethnic Vietnamese Kinh, but the province is home to many of 
Vietnam\'s minority groups, including 43,000 ethnic Chinese and 
30,000 ethnic Khmer.  According to provincial officials, Ho Chi 
Minh said that Ca Mau has the blessing of the gods, the blessing 
of good land, and the blessing of a harmonious people. 
 
3.  (SBU) Because of Ca Mau\'s dependence on aquaculture, 
provincial officials repeatedly raised the issue of past and 
(potentially) future U.S. anti-dumping cases involving catfish and 
shrimp.  Chairman Binh insisted that Vietnamese producers were not 
engaged in dumping, and called on the USG to reduce trade barriers 
to benefit both countries.  Other officials attributed the 
relatively rapid drop in poverty over the last three years to a 
shift by small landholders from growing rice to growing rice and 
raising shrimp. 
 
4.  (SBU) According to the provincial DPI, Ca Mau attracts little 
foreign direct investment, and has only two FDI projects, both 
under $1 million.  Ca Mau officials attributed this to Ca Mau\'s 
relatively remote location.   They also acknowledged that both the 
provincial government and the GVN must do more to improve 
infrastructure.  The central government runs all major development 
projects in the province, including the upgrade to Ca Mau\'s 
airport, construction of a major fertilizer plant, and oil and gas 
exploration off the coast.  The provincial DPI chairman could 
provide only the sketchiest details on these projects.  He knew, 
for instance, that Vietnam Airlines is scheduled to begin flights 
from Ho Chi Minh City to the province in December 2003, but did 
not know how often those flights would run. 
 
5.  (SBU) The provincial government is developing a master plan 
for eco-tourism in Ca Mau, including plans for area beaches, 
national forests, local bird sanctuaries, and marshes.  Once the 
plan has been completed, the provincial authorities will submit it 
to the GVN for approval and then release a book and call for 
foreign investors.  Other plans to diversify Ca Mau\'s economy away 
from aquaculture include developing labor-intensive industries, 
such as textiles, high tech assembly, and shipbuilding. 
Provincial authorities provided few specifics, however, and talked 
mostly about needing to attract investment and provide job 
training and placement. 
 
6.  (SBU) According to the heads of the Union of Friendship 
Organizations and the Committee for Religious Affairs, Ca Mau\'s 
four religious groups (Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, and Cao 
Dai) have excellent relations with each other and the provincial 
government, and often celebrate each other\'s festivals.  They said 
three Protestant churches affiliated with the GVN-recognized 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam are legally registered and 
able to operate freely, but claimed that no unregistered house 
churches operate in the province.  Citing Decree 26, which says a 
religious group must have a unified organization and structure to 
operate, they said any unregistered group would be unacceptable. 
Worship by a single family at home, however, was not a problem, 
they stressed. 
 
7.  (U) DPO raised the specific case of six house churches which 
Post contacts in the Protestant community reported had been closed 
in Dam Doi district, but officials denied these claims.  A heated 
but still friendly debate followed about different approaches to 
religious freedome and, specifically, the need to include 
unregistered house churches as legitimate places of worship when 
safeguarding religious freedom.  At one point, the head of the 
Union of Friendship Organizations, implicitly referring to the 
closing of house churces, let slip that he \"knew the village,\" 
which had not been named.  He said the people there already had a 
registered church and he could not understand why they needed 
another.  The two officials also expressed frustration that the 
widespread freedom in the province for all groups to practice 
religion at home and in registered churches, pagodas, etc., was 
not being acknowledged.  DPO made clear that the religious freedom 
accorded to organized religions and individuals was important and 
appreciated, but that freedom of religion extended to all forms of 
religious practice, including informal gatherings in small groups, 
such as house churches. 
 
8.  (SBU) While driving back to HCMC, DPO and Poloff made an 
unannounced stop at a legal Protestant church in Bac Lieu 
province, just past the Ca Mau border, and spoke with Pastor 
Nguyen Khac Nhan (protect), who has been a pastor in Vietnam for 
over 40 years.  He is not only the pastor of the legal church, but 
also the head of 39 unregistered house congregations.  His legal 
congregation included 3185 members, 20 from Ca Mau, and nearby 
house churches had an additional 440 members.  Of his ten 
children, five had themselves become pastors, and one was serving 
in Ca Mau.  In Bac Lieu and Ca Mau, he claimed, house church 
Protestants were often followed by local authorities, but 
harassment was not serious and believers were not afraid.  House 
church members occasionally used the legal church for large 
celebrations as well, without any problems.  He himself has been 
called in by the police to answer questions about his activities 
after leading services at house churches, while he said his 
relations with local officials are generally good and he has had 
complete freedom to run services as he wishes in his legal church. 
He had heard reports of the house church closings in Ca Mau, but 
thought their existence was generally tolerated.  He said there 
were more significant problems in the Central Highlands, where he 
also had connections. 
 
9.  (SBU) COMMENT: Ca Mau is an isolated province, and the 
provincial government sends conflicting signals.  Chairman Binh 
used to be the Commander in Chief of Ca Mau\'s military command 
before becoming the Chairman of the Provincial People\'s Committee. 
His bearing and interactions were very formal and non-committal, 
almost stereotypical of the classic Communist official.  Unusually 
for a People\'s Committee official, he touted \"national defense\" as 
one of the province\'s strengths, though he did not elaborate and 
backtracked quickly when asked if there were any specific security 
concerns in the area.  Likewise, the head of the Committee for 
Religious Affairs had never met with a foreign official before, 
appeared somewhat nervous and seemed unfamiliar with the house 
church model as a legitimate, recognized form of worship.  On the 
other hand, the head of the provincial DPI talked about efforts to 
reduce bureaucracy and attract businesses and proudly claimed that 
businesses could now obtain licenses in a single day. 
 
10.  (SBU) COMMENT CONTINUED: One reason the GVN may be handling 
Ca Mau\'s major development projects directly is because of 
corruption.  Chairman Binh\'s predecessor was removed from office 
in 2001 for a corruption scandal involving local businesses.  More 
troubling is an October 22, 2003 vernacular news article reporting 
that 50 out of 65 provincial government offices in Ca Mau were 
guilty of some form of financial misconduct.

SUBJECT: KIEN GIANG PROVINCE: PRACTICALLY PERFECT, IF NOT FOR THE 
POVERTY 
 
REF:  HCMC 00713 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The southern Mekong Delta province of Kien 
Giang faces significant challenges in attracting foreign 
investment and reducing poverty.  Despite impressive recent 
economic growth, mostly due to rice farmers converting to more 
profitable shrimp farming, the province is still underdeveloped, 
lacking infrastructure and educational and health care facilities. 
Most plans for economic diversification center around tourism 
development of the island of Phu Quoc and attracting both foreign 
direct investment and foreign development assistance.  During a 
recent visit to the provincial capital Rac Gia, DPO and Poloff met 
with Kien Giang People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Van Ha Phong, 
representatives of the Provincial Committees for Ethnic Minority 
and Religious Affairs, the Department of Planning and Investment 
(DPI), and the Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs 
(DOLISA).  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (U) Kien Giang encompasses a 6000 square kilometer area in the 
southwest corner of Vietnam.  It includes 105 small and large 
islands, the largest of which is Phu Quoc, and shares both a land 
and sea border with Cambodia.  Kien Giang\'s 1.6 million people 
include a substantial ethnic Khmer population, as well as Chinese, 
Cham, and over 20 other minority groups.  Kien Giang\'s primarily 
agricultural economy has seen GDP growth rates of 9-12% over the 
past four years, including a record 13.25% in 2002. 
 
3  (SBU) While Kien Giang has enjoyed recent rapid growth, largely 
by converting rice land to shrimp farming, its economy is limited 
to a few sectors.  Other than agriculture and seafood, its only 
industry is mining limestone.  The DPI could only name four FDI 
projects in the province, all Taiwanese, and only one worth over 
USD$1 million.  Vice Chairman Phong reported that although local 
businesses were aware of the Bilateral Trade Agreement with the 
U.S., he had not seen any noticeable impact on the province.  He 
claimed that Kien Giang\'s 2003 exports total only USD$150 million 
to date and are primarily to neighboring countries.  It is not 
clear, however, if any of the province\'s agriculture and 
aquaculture production is exported indirectly via other provinces. 
 
4  (SBU) Kien Giang\'s major push to develop and diversify its 
economy is the development of Phu Quoc Island as a regional 
tourist center.  The central GVN, working with provincial 
officials, has developed a master plan for eco-tourism, scheduled 
for release in the near future.  They have already solicited bids 
from 60 companies, including three American firms, to participate 
in Phu Quoc development.  An airport upgrade has begun in order to 
allow direct flights from Bangkok and Singapore.  According to the 
plans, by the end of 2003, the Phu Quoc airport will be able to 
accommodate Fokker regional jets, and by 2005 it will support an 
Airbus A320.  Plans also call for Phu Quoc\'s two ports to be 
upgraded to accommodate cruise ships and for a casino to be built 
on the island.  While a Malaysian company has expressed interest 
in this project, the provincial DPI chairman was so impressed by 
his recent visit to Las Vegas that he plans to solicit an American 
casino company to partner with them. 
 
5.  (SBU) Plans of casinos and cruise ships and rapid economic 
growth mask other indicators of poverty.  According to local 
officials only 60% of communes have electricity and reasonably 
clean (i.e. passed through some initial treatment) water. 
Although 97% of children in the province ages 6-10 years attend 
school, educational facilities are typically modest, with 1200 
classrooms still covered by thatched roofs.  The GVN has issued 
bonds to help provincial authorities pay for classroom renovation, 
expected to be completed by 2005. 
 
6.  (SBU) Several NGOs and foreign aid agencies are active in the 
province, including Australian, French, and Swiss NGOs, Danida, 
and USAID.  Most projects focus on clean water, rural roads, 
environmental issues, and health care.  The Swiss Red Cross has 
also sponsored a project to build homes for the poor, building 750 
at a cost of USD$1200 per house.  Provincial authorities 
contributed 15% to this project and also launched a separate 
project to build another 2500 homes at a cost of about USD$130 per 
house.  Provincial authorities are seeking additional development 
assistance for more water, roads, and health care projects. 
 
7.  (SBU) The Provincial Committee for Religious Affairs claimed 
that the province faced no contentious religious issues.  Eight 
Protestant churches affiliated with the official GVN-recognized 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam are legally registered, 
while there are no other groups planning to register churches, 
according to the provincial committee.  Officials claim that no 
house churches operate in Kien Giang.  They said only the Hoa Hao 
practice at home, and this group has been legally registered since 
2001.  Kien Giang operates a Buddhist high school, and the 
province includes 74 Khmer Buddhist pagodas serving the large 
minority population. 
8.  (SBU) Despite the province\'s long border with Cambodia, Vice 
Chairman Phong claimed they had no major border problems.  He 
mentioned occasional fishing disputes, but did not discuss piracy 
(reftel).  He claimed that Kien Giang was not used for trafficking 
in persons or drugs because it is too far from the major cities, 
so the cost is too high.  DOLISA reported, however, that the 
province had over 1000 drug users (like many other official 
numbers about \"social evils,\" it is likely a significant 
underestimate) and an active HIV/AIDS prevention committee. 
 
9. (SBU) Post had received some reports from Vietnamese-Americans 
that the local government had unjustly seized land from their 
relatives in Kien Giang.  DPO raised these reports with provincial 
People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Phong, who claimed he was unaware 
of any such incidents.  He added, however, that the GVN has a 
consistent policy on land expropriation for community development 
throughout the country.  Referring to heavy damage during the 
Vietnam war, he noted that to reduce poverty in Kien Giang, the 
government had expropriated land for quite a large number of 
infrastructure, school, and hospital projects.  He claimed that 
all such projects had some limited problems, with 5-15% of those 
affected complaining -- usually over the price the government 
paid.  He said the process was fair, with prices for expropriated 
land set by an evaluation board composed of both local residents 
and authorities. 
 
10. (SBU) COMMENT: Kien Giang officials were friendly and seemed 
genuinely happy to welcome official American visitors.  As is 
typical with our provincial trips, local officials were eager to 
attract American investment and open to U.S. development 
assistance.  With daily flights to Ho Chi Minh City and a colorful 
fishing fleet, Rac Gia offers some of the bustle and charm missing 
from other more isolated provincial capitals in the Mekong Delta. 
Besides the Phu Quoc tourism projects, however, officials had few 
real ideas for developing and diversifying the economy.  They were 
cautious about providing specifics on investing in Phu Quoc until 
Hanoi has approved their development plan.  It is not clear how 
much longer Kien Giang can count on dramatic growth from new 
shrimp farms.  At DPI, at least, the leadership appears to be 
hoping that a big gamble on casinos will pay off.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR HANFORD INVESTIGATES ABUSES IN THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1087  B) HCMC 1093  C) HCMC 2897 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious 
Freedom John Hanford traveled to Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces 
from October 20-22 to meet with local officials and gain a 
firsthand view of conditions for Protestant worship in Vietnam\'s 
Central Highlands.  Raising the specter of Country of Particular 
Concern (CPC) status, Ambassador Hanford laid out demands for an 
end to serious abuses (such as arrests, beatings and forced 
renunciations), called for the reopening of closed churches, and 
urged speedier registration of house churches wishing to affiliate 
with the government recognized Southern Evangelical Church of 
Vietnam (SECV).  He left lists of religious prisoners with 
provincial leaders and promised to follow up.  As expected, local 
officials did not admit to any serious violations of religious 
freedom in their provinces.  Still, the visit provided some unique 
insights into life in this heavily controlled area of Vietnam, as 
Ambassador Hanford met with local Protestant leaders and sought to 
investigate allegations of abuse in remote villages on the drive 
between the two provinces.  Ambassador Burghardt and Consul 
General joined him on the trip.  Reftels report on official and 
unofficial meetings in HCMC and Hanoi.  End summary. 
 
THE OFFICIAL VIEW 
----------------- 
2. (SBU) Meeting on October 20 with Gia Lai People\'s Committee 
Chairman Nguyen Vi Ha and other local officials responsible for 
overseeing ethnic minority and religious affairs, Ambassador 
Hanford stressed the need to reopen more than 300 churches that 
had been closed since the ethnic unrest of early 2001, as well as 
to speed up registrations for those churches wanting legal 
recognition.  He also called on the Chairman to prevent abuses by 
local police, such as beatings and forced renunciations.  He said 
he had received information on such abuses from too many sources 
to believe they were overstated.  What\'s more, his information 
indicated the majority of those being oppressed were true 
Christian believers with legitimate, peaceful motives.  Only a 
\"tiny percentage\" belonged to the Dega separatist movement. 
Chairman Ha denied police pressure on religious believers, but 
added that both Dega and former FULRO elements are a real threat 
and had infiltrated many churches.  He promised no one is in 
prison in Gia Lai for purely religious reasons.  Those individuals 
in prison are there because of their allegiance to Dega or other 
political agendas, or for common criminal acts incompatible with 
religion. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Chairman Ha, there are 71,000 Protestants in 
five different denominations in Gia Lai Province.  Nearly all 
(66,000) belong to the Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA), 
the principal denomination of the SECV.  Seven churches have been 
legally registered, but registration requires that a congregation 
have both approved facilities and a government recognized pastor. 
(The deputy head of the Committee for Religious Affairs pointed 
out that there were only 31 Protestant churches in the province 
before 1975.)  There are only four legal pastors and seven lay 
pastors at the moment, but two students from the province are 
studying at the new SECV seminary in HCMC.  Protestants who do not 
live near one of the legal churches are still free to worship 
quietly at home pending registration of their own churches, but 
Chairman Ha did not see the need to allow worshippers to gather in 
large numbers at \"temporary\" house churches.  He rejected the 
notion that the government had closed churches by refusing to 
recognize house churches as legitimate churches.  He acknowledged, 
however, that 20 Dega churches had been closed.  The Chairman 
asked for more time to deal with the registration of new SECV 
churches, faulting the SECV for organizational delays in 
identifying suitable new churches. 
 
4. (SBU) Ambassador Hanford met with Dak Lak provincial People\'s 
Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang and a similar supporting cast 
on October 21, and inquired about reports that hundreds of 
churches had been closed and registrations of new churches were 
proceeding very slowly.  Like Chairman Ha, Chairman Lang noted the 
importance of training qualified pastors to lead new 
congregations.  He confirmed that there are still only two legal 
Protestant churches for the entire province, with five more still 
under consideration.  While he admitted that the Dak Lak 
provincial SECV Representative Board had included 70 congregations 
on its list for eventual registration, he said they had only 
submitted applications for five.  Meanwhile, he said, most of the 
province\'s 120,000 Protestant believers (40,000 \"baptized\") 
continue to worship at home in small family units of up to six or 
seven.  Ambassador Hanford challenged Chairman Lang to explain 
what appeared to be official documents calling on local officials 
to eradicate Christianity and obtain renunciations.  Ambassador 
Hanford also criticized the reported closure of 440 churches and 
provided specific cases of beatings and forced renunciations.  He 
said that every Christian leader with whom he had spoken had 
assured him that the Dega represented a very small percentage of 
the overall Christian population.  When  Chairman Lang blamed the 
U.S. for supporting the Dega movement, Ambassador Burghardt asked 
for concrete information that anyone in the U.S. was lending 
support to activities seeking the overthrow by violence of the 
current GVN.  Ambassador Burghardt also urged Chairman Lang not to 
block passports for Dak Lak residents seeking to join relatives 
who had been resettled in the U.S. under various refugee programs. 
 
THE SECV PASTORS\' VIEW 
---------------------- 
5. (SBU) Meetings with members of the provincial SECV 
representative boards in the two provinces provided a contrasting 
picture.  In Gia Lai, the board members told Ambassador Hanford 
that they had been given a different time for the meeting.  Hence 
the two Protestants believers whom they had invited from 25 
kilometers away, where there had been many recent incidents of 
government repression, were unable to attend.  The SECV board 
members said there were two applications for registration under 
consideration, and three more in the preparation stage. 
Unfortunately, they were only allowed to submit applications for 
congregations that they already knew would be approved.  In 
addition to 347 churches which had been closed, they cited another 
500 \"meeting points\" which had experienced problems.  They 
estimated that the government had completely shut down 
approximately 50 percent of the total number of worship places, 
and regularly visited another 30 percent in order to disrupt 
services.  The remaining 20 percent of the congregations 
functioned more-or-less normally.  The SECV board members thought 
there were at least 30,000 Protestants of other denominations in 
the province, in addition to the 66,000 CMA and 5000 \"others\" 
cited by provincial Chairman Ha.  The board members told 
Ambassador Hanford that many Christians had been beaten in remote 
areas recently.  Back in August, board members were visited by a 
man from a village 60 kilometers away who was beaten so badly that 
he had blood in his urine.  A few villagers from neighboring Kon 
Tum Province had visited just last week to report that 20 or 30 
Christians were beaten in Sa Thay District.  Some had bruises and 
needed medication. 
 
6.  (SBU) Asked about the presence of Dega Protestants in the 
province, the Gia Lai SECV board said between 3000-5000 declared 
Dega admitted their affiliation openly.  They estimated there were 
another 14,000-17,000 \"undeclared\" Dega followers who sympathized 
with the movement\'s goals.  When pressed as to whether they were 
saying that potentially 20,000 of the 90,000 Protestants in Gia 
Lai Province could be Dega followers/sympathizers, this reliable 
source said yes.  (Note:  These Dega numbers are much higher than 
the Mission had previously thought, as Dega membership has usually 
been described as \"small\" or \"insignificant.\"  The Dega openly 
advocate autonomy from the GVN, with some Dega advocating violence 
to achieve a separate state.  Since this particular SECV board 
member is often considered a reliable source for negative 
information regarding GVN actions against Protestant believers, we 
were surprised to hear him acknowledging such large numbers of 
Dega.  End Note.) 
 
7. (SBU) In Dak Lak, the SECV Board said 20 out of 400 churches 
are presently allowed to operate normally.  Claiming they had been 
cut off from much of their community by restrictions on travel, 
however, they were unable to personally confirm that 300 house 
churches had been asked to close since the start of 2001.  They 
had heard that pastors were warned several times to cease their 
illegal services, then ordered more forcefully to desist, or made 
to sign documents promising not to conduct services until they 
were legal.  They had only secondhand knowledge of forced 
renunciations, saying they thought it had happened in some places 
where Christians were \"weak and uneducated.\"  They had only 
secondhand information on beatings as well.  Presented with a list 
of four individuals, they knew nothing specific about the 
circumstances, although they knew the individuals and had heard 
they were beaten.  Presented with a list of pastors believed to be 
imprisoned simply because of their normal religious activities, 
they said they knew most of them and did not believe them to be 
Dega, although the government did. 
 
8. (SBU) Ambassador Hanford also visited three remote rural 
villages in the two provinces to try to meet with individuals 
alleged to have suffered at the hands of the government for their 
religious belief.  These stops were arranged by pastors in HCMC 
with extensive contacts in the Central Highlands, and included 
only individuals who had agreed to meet with the Ambassador.  In 
all three cases, the traveling party was \"escorted\" by numerous 
police, both uniformed and plainclothes, who sometimes seemed to 
materialize out of nowhere and blanket the neighborhood. 
Residents were understandably unwilling to talk under those 
circumstances, and it was impossible to locate anyone who even 
admitted to having heard of any of these individuals. 
 
9. (U) Ambassador Hanford did not have an opportunity to clear 
this message before his departure.

SUBJECT: ONE PRIVATE BANK IN VIETNAM IS MODERN AND INNOVATIVE 
 
REF:  HCMC 1002 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  Asia Commercial Bank, Vietnam\'s largest privately-held (joint- 
stock) bank, has managed to build a successful business in a 
sector fraught with potential pitfalls.  The bank is small by 
international standards, but since it was established in 1993 the 
bank has grown to assets of about 737 million USD.  Most 
importantly, the bank is profitable and appears to make loans 
based on genuine principles of credit risk analysis.  In a meeting 
with Ambassador Burghardt, bank management stressed the need for 
Vietnam to continue financial sector reforms, and that foreign 
voices should urge the GVN to continue the reform process. 
Decisions on how to accelerate these reforms would be made at the 
political level - a level where they and even the State Bank of 
Vietnam had only limited influence.  They openly asked for USG 
help to encourage Vietnam to accelerate financial sector reforms. 
ACB management believes that property prices in Ho Chi Minh City 
have reached speculative levels and will drop substantially next 
year.  End Summary 
 
An Innovative Enterprise 
------------------------ 
2.  On November 20, 2003, Ambassador Burghardt, accompanied by 
HCMC Econoff, visited Ho Chi Minh City-based Asia Commercial Bank, 
the country\'s largest and most successful joint-stock bank.  He 
met with Mr. Tran Mong Hung, Chairman, Mr. Pham Van Thiet, 
President, and their management team.  The bank is well-known for 
its innovative and modern banking practices.  Its reputation was 
challenged last month when rumors that Mr. Thiet had fled the 
country triggered a run on the bank (reftel), but the rumor was 
quashed.  About half of the hasty withdrawals have already been 
redeposited with the bank. 
 
3.  The Ambassador\'s meeting began with a brief tour of the bank 
lobby, where the Ambassador could see many of the bank\'s 
innovations.  The space was clean, well-lit, and orderly.  The 
bank had even installed a \"Q-Matic\" - probably the only one in 
Vietnam outside our consular section - to minimize waiting.  Life 
insurance counters were set up for two competing firms, gold was 
available for sale, and racks displayed promotional brochures on 
the bank\'s credit cards, bank-by-phone and online banking 
services.  In addition to traditional bank branches, ACB is also 
setting up kiosk branches and branches in grocery stores.  Through 
all of these initiatives, the bank is positioning itself to appeal 
to a customer base of primarily urban middle class and wealthy 
households. 
 
A Lot Can Happen in 10 Years 
---------------------------- 
4.  The Bank was established in 1993 and in ten years has expanded 
to a network of 29 branches throughout Vietnam, with 16 of them in 
Ho Chi Minh City.  It has 11,500 billion VND (about 737 million 
USD) in assets and total deposits of about 9,200 billion VND 
(about 590 million USD).  The bank offers all of the standard 
deposit and loan services (in local and foreign currencies and, of 
course, in gold), as well as credit and debit cards.  It is also 
an agent for Western Union and generates substantial fee income 
from remittance services.  The company has also set up a 
securities company affiliate and a real estate arm.  It has an 
application with the U.S. Federal Reserve to open up a 
representative office in the United States. 
 
5.  The bank is privately held.  The members of the bank\'s board 
of directors and management team control about 50% of the equity. 
Another 25% is held in approximately equal shares by three foreign 
investors:  Jardine Matheson, Dragon Capital, and the World Bank\'s 
International Finance Corporation (IFC).  Bank management notes 
that the IFC is an active investor and offers substantial training 
and technical assistance to the bank.  The Ambassador noted that 
since the USG funds a major portion of the IFC, it is an indirect 
shareholder of the bank.  Mr. Hung said that a few SOEs also have 
small equity stakes in the bank. 
 
6.  According to Chairman Hung, their business is split between 
60% retail and 40% commercial banking.  Nearly all of its 
commercial business targets small and medium-sized businesses in 
the private sector.  Chairman Hung told the Ambassador that ACB 
makes loans only to profitable, commercially viable companies, and 
nearly all loans are secured by collateral.  He also stated that 
the bank does about 5% of its business with a few carefully- 
chosen, profitable state-owned enterprises.  Most of these are 
monopolies that they gauge as good credit risks. 
 
7.  When the Ambassador asked how the bank assessed credit risk, 
Chairman Hung acknowledged that it was difficult, but noted that 
the IFC had provided substantial risk assessment training to its 
staff, which was very helpful.  He again stressed that the bank 
only made loans to companies that they evaluated as profitable, 
commercially viable concerns and that virtually all loans were 
secured with collateral.  Credit risk assessment was extremely 
important, Chairman Hung stated, because going after collateral in 
a default situation was extremely difficult.  It usually took 
about three years to successfully foreclose on property, for 
example.  He said that it was easier to dispose of property in 
cities because land use rights, which were an unwelcome complexity 
anywhere in Vietnam, were even more complex in rural areas.  He 
expected that the situation would likely improve in the future 
because the National Assembly was considering a new land law. 
Ambassador Burghardt noted that for the financial sector to 
function properly, banks must be able to foreclose in the case of 
loan default. 
 
Political Actors Decide the Pace of Banking Reforms 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
8.  Ambassador Burghardt asked for ACB\'s view of Vietnam\'s 
financial sector reform.  He noted that there was a virtually 
universal view among international donors that reforms were 
proceeding much too slowly.  Chairman Hung replied that the 
decision to accelerate reforms would have to be made at \"the 
political level,\" well above the State Bank of Vietnam.  The SBV 
understands the problem, he said, but their role is limited.  He 
claimed that virtually all of the key decision-makers were aware 
of what needed to be done, but that it was still difficult to do 
it. 
 
9.  Reforms must continue, he said, because as Vietnam opens its 
financial sector to foreign players, Vietnamese banks will have 
great difficulty competing.  Ambassador Burghardt asked if state- 
owned banks were \"throwing good money after bad\" by continuing to 
make new loans to loss-making state-owned enterprises.  While 
hardly endorsing the health and stability of the state banks, Mr. 
Hung noted some positive developments.  The SBV had pressured the 
Ministry of Finance to inject capital into the state-owned banks 
and use their pre-tax profits to increase their loan-loss 
provisions.  He also stated that over the last two or three years 
state-owned banks had begun making 20-30% of their loans to 
private sector businesses.  This diversified their loan 
portfolios, and hopefully these loans were made on a more 
commercially viable basis. 
 
But ACB Ready to Compete 
------------------------ 
10.  ACB management acknowledged that competition will continue to 
increase as more foreign banks are allowed to expand their 
business in Vietnam, but Mr. Hung told Ambassador Burghardt that 
ACB is ready.  Working with the IFC the bank has committed to 
training and strengthening its human resources.  The Chairman 
noted that it has worked hard to build its target customer base - 
middle-class to wealthy urban households and small and medium 
enterprises in the private sector - sectors that are likely to 
grow.  The bank has also successfully introduced a variety of 
services.  For example, as of last year it had issued more than 
30,000 credit cards.  With so many bank branches and a well- 
developed customer base, Chairman Hung stated that ACB would be in 
a good position to form alliances with foreign banks that also 
have a focus on retail banking.  It is already doing so with 
Citibank in offering one type of loan product. 
 
Don\'t Buy Land Until Next Year 
------------------------------ 
11.  The bank has a growing mortgage business, particularly in Ho 
Chi Minh City, where it has set up real estate \"supermarkets\" 
where buyers can review listings and get information about the 
market.   A typical ACB mortgage is extended for only 30-40% of 
the purchase price of a home and carries a maximum term of ten 
years.  Econoff asked if ACB was worried about soaring property 
prices and if we were seeing a property price bubble about to 
burst.  The bankers agreed, stating that property prices had risen 
to speculative levels and were set to tumble.  The market had 
topped out, they said, and they believed that land prices would 
fall by about 50% within the next year (as opposed to housing 
prices, which would presumably fall by a lesser amount.) 
 
12.  Mr. Hung claimed that this would not be a major problem for 
the bank, since most ACB  mortgages were for only a small portion 
of the overall purchase price.  Payment terms were set based on 
stable income flows of the borrower, which were unlikely to be 
affected by a drop in property prices.  Even though property 
serves as collateral for non-mortgage loans, Mr. Hung stated that 
ACB credit risk evaluation teams took this speculative pricing 
into consideration when it assessed the viability of commercial 
projects and the long term value of property as collateral.  This, 
he believes, will protect the bank from any dramatic price drops. 
 
Nobody Listens to Me 
-------------------- 
13.  At the end of the meeting, the Ambassador asked how bankers 
like ACB participate in or influence discussions on financial 
sector reform.  Mr. Hung noted that it was very difficult to 
influence the discussion which went on at very high levels in the 
GVN.  He said that the decision-makers understood the situation, 
but that seemed to have difficulty taking action.  He stated that 
it was very important for the U.S. and other foreign countries to 
push for these changes.   This, he said, may be the most effective 
way to influence their actions. 
 
Comment 
------- 
14.  Chairman Hung and his management team are impressive, and 
have built a bank to serve Vietnam\'s growing urban middle class. 
In a few short years they have built a sizeable branch network, a 
strong customer base, and attracted foreign investment and 
expertise.  Their innovations should help them compete as Vietnam 
opens up its financial sector over time.  Sadly, these individuals 
downplay their influence with Vietnam\'s top leadership.  One hopes 
they have understated their influence, because their expertise and 
advice are sorely needed if Vietnam\'s financial sector reforms are 
eventually to succeed in giving Vietnam the banking system that it 
needs to prosper and develop.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANT POSSIBLY BEATEN, DETAINED FOR DISTRIBUTING 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  At least one Protestant religious worker in Ho 
Chi Minh City was reportedly beaten and detained on December 9 for 
involvement in the distribution of religious leaflets designed to 
look like official Southeast Asia (SEA) Games pamphlets.  Other 
Protestant leaders held a \"sit-in\" at a local police station to 
protest the arrest.  One pastor told ConGen that a high-ranking 
police contact had indicated late Tuesday that distributors of 
this pamphlet would be strictly prosecuted.  The organizers had 
previously received repeated warnings from authorities not to 
distribute the material.  Other pastors and religious workers who 
were involved in distributing the pamphlets have reportedly failed 
to check in with family and friends.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) HCC Protstants printed 200,000 copies of a religious 
pamphlet for distribution in both Hanoi and HCMC during this 
year\'s 22nd annual SEA Games December 5-14, which Vietnam is 
hosting for the first time.  The front cover of the pamphlet reads 
\"SEA GAMES 22: Vietnam 2003\" and includes the official SEA Games 
logo and other official-looking symbols.  The back cover has the 
schedule for men\'s and women\'s soccer events.  Closed, the 
pamphlet is indistinguishable from an official program of events, 
but the inside reveals two full pages of religious quotes and 
information. 
 
3.  (SBU) On the evening of December 9, an unregistered Mennonite 
house church pastor and an associate claimed to have been 
confronted by police after leaving another pastor\'s home where the 
pamphlets were being stored.  The first pastor fled the scene back 
to the second pastor\'s home, but his associate was allegedly 
beaten and detained by police.  The associate was reportedly taken 
to a police station in HCMC\'s District 1.   Poloff spoke with 
several Protestant contacts during the night and received 
conflicting reports.  A third Protestant pastor told Poloff that 
he had spoken with high-level contacts in the HCMC branch of the 
Ministry of Public Security and been told that the decision had 
been made to strictly prosecute those responsible for the 
pamphlet.  Authorities had previously warned the organizers of the 
group more than once not to distribute the pamphlet. 
 
4.  (SBU) The Mennonite pastor and fifteen associates have engaged 
in a \"sit-in\" at the District 1 police station since last night to 
demand the release of their detained colleague.  Fifteen other 
Protestants, including the pastor whose house was used for storage 
of the brochures, have yet to check in with their families and 
friends.  This follows the alleged one-day detention of seven 
Protestants in the Hanoi area a few days ago.  One of those 
individuals was also allegedly beaten.  All of these cases 
involved distribution of the pamphlet. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Initial reports by pastors to ConGen on December 9 made 
conflicting claims that up to 16 Protestants had been beaten and 
were under medical care, or were detained at three separate 
locations.  In a separate meeting earlier the same day, one of the 
pastors told ConGen a student had been beaten by eleven police for 
distributing the pamphlet. When ConGen asked to meet with the 
student, the pastor refused, saying there were no marks and there 
was no point in asking any questions.  As of December 10 in the 
morning, the various stories had synthesized into one detainee and 
fifteen sit-in protesters.  However, a December 10 public 
statement from the Vietnamese Mennonite Church on the same events, 
received subsequently via Post\'s public affairs email account, 
claims that police attacked a religious worker and pastor with 
\"electric rods and pistols\" in an attempt to \"assassinate\" the 
two.  An update from the group the evening of December 10 
indicated that a deal was being brokered in which the police would 
release several detainees, including some of those who had not 
been in touch with their families, if the sit-in would disperse. 
 
6.  (SBU) COMMENT: While Post is attempting to clarify the 
situation, some of the primary sources for this incident are among 
the least credible.  This is the same group that was involved in 
an incident during the visit of A/S Dewey earlier in the year, 
when a confrontation over a prayer service with mistakes on both 
sides led to one of the pastors \"punching a policeman,\" in his own 
words.  There were still other incidents with this group during 
another high-level visit on religious issues.  They have also 
illicitly brought cameras and video recorders to meetings with 
Congen staff to try to videostream the meetings on the Internet 
and use them for publicity.  Post was disconcerted that a top 
Protestant community leader knew nothing about the alleged 
pamphlet incident nearly twenty-four hours later.  Those involved 
in the incident wanted to have a ConGenOff come meet with them at 
the police station, but have yet to act on an invitation to meet 
elsewhere to discuss the incident in detail. 
 
7.  (SBU) Comment continued: The GVN has several options by which 
to prosecute this case beyond normal restrictions on 
proselytizing, including misrepresentation, unauthorized use of 
official government logos, and even IPR violations if the logos 
were copyrighted.  ConGen will continue to monitor the situation 
and follow up with our contacts, while remaining cautious about 
being drawn into deliberate, manipulative provocations.  It\'s hard 
to tell whether the police are more upset by the religious content 
of the pamphlet or the fact that the GVN itself was made to look 
like it was proselytizing.

SUBJECT: SEA GAMES RELIGIOUS PAMPHLET INCIDENT FOLLOW-UP 
 
REF:  HCMC 001215 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  ConGenoffs met with Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang 
on December 11, 2003, to discuss the events of December 9-10 
(reftel).  Quang was also accompanied by the allegedly beaten 
religious worker.  An agreement between Protestants and police had 
reportedly resulted in the release of all but two detainees, who 
were still dealing with bureaucratic issues.  ConGenoffs also 
clarified details concerning numbers and the source of the \"SEA 
Games\" pamphlets.   END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) According to Pastor Quang, the U.S. student organization 
Campus Crusade for Christ funded the pamphlet production and 
coordinated the design with pastors in Vietnam, though he did not 
reveal which pastors.  He originally stated that the pamphlets 
\"showed up\" at the houses of various Protestant leaders and that 
they decided to use them because \"the content was good.\"  At 
first, he denied knowledge of where the pamphlets were printed, 
but later said that they were printed by many sources in both 
Thailand and Vietnam.  Plans called for about one million total 
pamphlets to be distributed.  On December 10, however, police 
reportedly raided one printing house and seized 30,000 pamphlets. 
Quang was uncertain how many pamphlets have actually been printed 
and distributed.  At the time of the incident, the religious 
worker who was allegedly beaten had a box of pamphlets on his 
motorbike.  (Post Note:  Other pastors who helped with the 
pamphlets told ConGen that Campus Crusade for Christ had no 
connection at all with the pamphlets and also said the number they 
originally planned to distribute was 300,000 not one million.  End 
Note.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Pastor Quang claimed that the religious worker had been 
beaten and attacked with electric prods, as the church\'s December 
10 press release stated.  He initially said that the religious 
worker had bruises on his chest, arms, and back.  When ConGenoffs 
asked the worker to show his bruises, however, Quang informed them 
that the Vietnamese police had \"very advanced\" techniques so that 
they could beat someone without leaving any marks and that the 
electric prods had been covered with rubber and cloth.  The worker 
had a visible scratch on his face.  He could not explain how it 
was caused, but said it happened during the altercation with 
police.  He showed ConGenoffs two tiny scratches on his wrist that 
he claimed were from handcuffs.  Finally, he removed part of his 
shirt and showed a small red abrasion on the inside of his upper 
arm.  He claimed this was caused when he was grabbed by the police 
and tried to pull away, although he also mentioned being dragged 
along the street as he was being arrested.  He showed no other 
visible marks and moved normally, without any apparent 
difficulties.  Quang also patted the worker on the shoulders and 
back throughout the meeting without the worker showing any pain or 
discomfort.  Quang stated that pictures had been taken of marks 
after the beating and distributed via e-mail, which Mission later 
received via a public information email address. 
 
4.  (SBU) Twenty \"students\" accompanied Pastor Quang to the police 
station on the evening of December 9, and twenty more \"students\" 
joined the \"sit in\" on December 10.  According to Quang, the 
Protestants threatened both a hunger strike and a 3,000-10,000 
person demonstration outside the HCMC People\'s Committee building 
unless police met three demands.  Quang claimed the police at 
first asked them to please have a smaller group, maybe several 
hundred, not thousands.  Quang outlined the conditions he had set. 
First, the police would investigate the incident, identify those 
responsible for \"the attack,\" and have those individuals 
apologize.  Second, police would release twenty Protestants 
\"detained\" over the previous three days for pamphlet-related 
offenses.  Finally, the police would agree to \"honor the security\" 
of the Protestants as long as they were not violating any laws, 
and would follow proper procedure and not beat anyone if the 
Protestants were violating the law.  Police and Protestant leaders 
signed a document outlining these points on the evening of 
December 10.  The document did not require the police to admit any 
wrongdoing, beyond the promised investigation, or admit to 
detaining anyone.  However, most of the alleged detainees were 
released that evening and the following morning. 
 
5.  (SBU) As of Pastor Quang\'s meeting with Congenoffs, only two 
alleged detainees had not reported in to family members.  Quang 
speculated that those two were delayed because of administrative 
paperwork concerning the release of seized motorbikes, noting that 
the motorbikes might not be legally registered.  He said that if 
those two were not released promptly, he and a few other select 
Protestant leaders would go into hiding so that their followers 
would think they were still detained and proceed with the planned 
demonstration.  The police also agreed to provide \"protection,\" as 
long as no laws were being broken, if the pastors called 113, the 
Vietnamese equivalent of 911.  Quang said that they had called 
once last evening when they believed they were being followed, and 
that the 113 police arrived as promised. 
 
6.  (SBU) Pastor Quang did not believe that his meeting with 
Poloff and DRL on December 9 was associated with the incident. 
His theory about why he was almost stopped immediately after his 
meeting was that the confusion of the SEA Games and the large 
crowds on the street provided plainclothes police officers with an 
easy opportunity.  He indicated that he was watched and followed 
constantly, so the police always know how to find him.  The 
religious worker said that one police officer told him that his 
beating and detention happened because of the pamphlets. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT: While the meeting clarified some details, Post 
was unable to confirm some of the more extreme claims made in the 
email press release attributed to the Vietnamese Mennonite Church. 
Pastor Quang said he was not aware of the press release, but some 
of his followers may have put it together hurriedly for foreign 
dissemination.  Post was able to obtain a copy of the agreement 
with the police, which appears to be genuine.  It is harder to 
confirm any serious attempt on Pastor Quang\'s life by the police, 
a concern that Quang has voiced for the past several years without 
visible evidence.  The religious worker did not appear to be 
seriously injured and seemed in very good shape for someone who 
had allegedly been \"fiercely attacked by many police armed with 
rifles, pistols, and electric rods\" or \"badly tortured in 
detention\" thirty-six hours before.  He could well have been in a 
scuffle with police during his arrest, as at least some of his 
responses suggested, and may have been handled roughly during his 
detention.  (This is also a frequent complaint even in cases not 
involving religious activities.) Quang did not indicate if the 
group intends to continue to distribute the pamphlets and risk 
more confrontations with the police.

SUBJECT: FACE TO FACE WITH SMUGGLERS AND OFFICIALS ALONG THE 
BORDER 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  An Econ trip to the town of Chau Doc and the border area of An 
Giang Province revealed energetic levels of small time smuggling 
that is largely tolerated by local authorities.  That fat man on 
the motorcycle may simply have his clothing stuffed full of 
cartons of cigarettes, locals say, but they also denied any 
knowledge of narcotics trafficking in did not mention any 
trafficking in women.  With lax border controls and a largely 
unpatrolled border, however, both could easily occur.  One 
official stated they stopped a boat with more than 7 kilos of 
heroin earlier this year, but somehow, on the open paddy fields, 
the smugglers themselves managed to escape.  Most border traffic 
is local, with almost no foreigners crossing into or out of 
Cambodia.  While traveling in a marked \"frontier area,\" Econoffs, 
Econ/Pol Assistant, and Congen Driver came to the attention of the 
police who, while ignoring other traffic coming and going, tried 
to impress upon Congen party that they had violated Vietnamese law 
by being there without permission.  Police were polite, did not 
try to separate or intimidate the two FSNs, and eventually sent 
Congen party on their way. 
 
\"Catfish\" and Smugglers 
----------------------- 
An Giang Province sits along the Cambodian Border where the Mekong 
River enters Vietnam.  Only two or three kilometers from the 
border is the town of Chau Doc which is located along a branch of 
the Mekong.  These days it is known for raising tra and basa fish, 
primarily in floating cages in the river.  Like many border towns 
it is also known for smuggling.  Because Cambodia has 
substantially lower tariffs for many goods, this can be a 
lucrative business.  One local Amcham contact reported that on a 
recent visit to Phnom Penh he was told by a Cambodian official 
that 40% of goods imported into Cambodia are eventually smuggled 
into Vietnam. 
 
Quiet Crossing and Sleepy Guards 
-------------------------------- 
3.  The official border crossing nearest Chau Doc is Tinh Bien, 
about 25 km southwest of town.  It sits on a causeway cutting 
across a landscape of rice paddies that stretch for miles on 
either side.   The checkpoint is a quiet spot, and Econoffs\' 
arrival at the border crossing caused a stir among the motorbike 
taxi drivers waiting for fares that never seemed to materialize. 
Econoffs walked up to the Vietnamese immigration checkpoint where 
two young soldiers in a small hut preside over the pedestrian and 
vehicle crossings.  Beyond them sits an administrative building, 
including the customs check-point, and then Cambodia.  The 
soldiers, though clearly curious about their Western visitors, 
were friendly, chatting with Econoffs while continuing to check 
those crossing the border.  Eventually, an officer emerged from 
the administrative building.  He was also courteous and willing to 
answer questions.  They told us that the nearest town on the 
Cambodian side was about 7 kilometers away. 
 
4.  Pedestrian and motorcycle traffic through the checkpoint was 
light but steady.  People transiting from Vietnam to Cambodia were 
mostly empty-handed and traveled by motorbike.  Econoffs witnessed 
two loads of eggs stacked high and wide on modified motorcycle 
carts headed into Cambodia.  Travelers entering Vietnam tended to 
carry small bundles of agricultural products.  We also saw a 
couple loads of scrap metal and boxes on carts coming in as well. 
The Cambodians were a far more ragged-looking lot than their 
Vietnamese neighbors, many of them on foot or on old bicycles. 
There were a few men crossing into Vietnam with picks or hoes 
tossed over their shoulders, perhaps coming to work.  The border 
guards said that about 400 people cross the border in the 12 hours 
it is open each day; about 300 of them are crossing from Cambodia 
into Vietnam.  Most of these trips are round-trips by residents of 
the border areas.   In the thirty minutes Econoffs spent 
conversing with the border guards, only one, apparently empty, 
truck bound for Cambodia passed through the checkpoint, none 
transited in the other direction. 
 
5.  Travelers passed the checkpoint with little or no inspection. 
Border residents, Cambodian or Vietnamese, are allowed relatively 
unrestricted travel back and forth.  Each official ID card denotes 
the holder\'s place of residence and, as long as they reside 
nearby, there is no need for visas, passports, or other 
formalities.  A few people heading for Cambodia presented the 
border guards with their identification card and a 2000 VND fee. 
The money went in a cash drawer, while the details from the ID 
cards were carefully recorded by hand in a small lined notebook by 
the border guard.  In one such case a tall silent fellow strolled 
up, raised us hat, withdrew his Cambodian ID card, presented it 
with a fee, and then carefully replaced the ID in his hat, smiled, 
and proceeded.  Most people, however, offered nothing more than a 
nod or smile.  The guards stated that these were regulars - people 
who crossed on a daily basis.  The guards said they collect the 
crossing fee from them on a periodic basis; though, there was no 
apparent system of tracking the number of crossings.  Very few non- 
locals cross at the border, the officials told us.  Since the 
checkpoint became an international border crossing in February 
2002, only about 200 foreigners had gone through the checkpoint. 
 
6.  The border guards acknowledged that smuggling occurred but did 
not say much about their efforts to prevent it.  They did 
acknowledge that the one boat in their inventory was not enough to 
effectively patrol the paddies during the rainy season.  The 
officer noted that during the recent rainy season, border guards 
confiscated 7 kilos of heroin when they stopped a suspicious boat 
crossing the flooded paddies.  No one managed to apprehend the 
crew of the boat,although escaping from a boat in a flat, 
featureless landscape would seem difficult. 
 
7.  All in all, Tinh Bien was a somnolent place of very local 
traffic, almost roused from quiet routine by the presence of 
strangers, but not quite.  The closest thing to dynamic activity 
was about one kilometer back from the border where Cambodian 
farmers sold their rice - which they typically brought on their 
backs or on bicycle - to Vietnamese buyers at a roadside 
rendezvous point.  Time spent in the vicinity of the unofficial 
border crossing on the edge of Chau Doc would tell a different 
tale. 
 
Texas Fives and Used Rice Cookers 
--------------------------------- 
8.  Upon arriving in Chau Doc, Econoffs dined with a prominent 
family in the local aquaculture industry.  These contacts, as 
lifelong residents of the border area, were quite knowledgeable 
about local smuggling and shared many anecdotes of living along 
the main street in a border town.  They described men bent under 
the weight of 29 inch TV boxes shuffling by their house and 
passersby on bicycles carrying so many cartons of cigarettes under 
their clothes that they appeared lumpy and twice their normal size 
(\"you know, like Westerners. Ha ha ha\").  They told us that Chau 
Doc was awash in smuggled goods, particularly cigarettes, 
motorcycle parts, cellphones, small household appliances, and 
electronics, both new and used.  That is why, they said, these 
items were much cheaper in Chau Doc than in Ho Chi Minh City. 
They were happy to point out the area along the border very near 
town where much of the smuggling takes place.  Using our host\'s 
directions, we followed dinner with a trip to the border and the 
area where smugglers make their crossings. 
 
9.  Unlike the official crossing at Tinh Bien, this crossing is 
just outside of Chau Doc in a populated commune known as Vinh 
Nguon.  Following a dirt road flanked by rough one-room houses 
crafted from thatch, tin, and old lumber, Econoffs paralleled the 
border with a branch of the Mekong River on the right and rice 
paddies leading to Cambodia on the left.  Periodic stops to look 
across the darkened paddies for signs of activity invariably 
attracted curious onlookers, each eager to talk about life on the 
border and the local smuggling business.  According to one small 
group of young men that approached us, the bulk of illicit cross- 
border trade flows from Cambodia to Vietnam and is in rather 
innocuous goods.  Televisions, DVD/VCD players, clothes, used 
electrical appliances, and cigarette brands with names like Jet 
and Texas Fives all cross the paddy fields.  Smuggled goods come 
across on the backs or under the clothes of local residents hired 
by the trip.  Wages for guiding others across the border are 
around 30,000 VND (about two usd) per trip, while the wages for 
actually carrying contraband fluctuates with the value of the 
cargo.  Interestingly, according to local residents, smuggling at 
this area takes place mainly during daylight hours.  One local 
even described the \"workday\" as starting at 7AM. Border area 
residents said the river was not a favored avenue for smuggling as 
it was easy for the police to stopand serch boats.  In a 
separate conversation, however, the expat manager of a local hotel 
attached more importance to the water route and claimed that 
boatloads of contraband regularly entered Vietnam at Chau Doc. 
 
10.  Vinh Nguon\'s smugglers converge on various shops and houses 
in Chau Doc after making their cross-border dashes.  Here the 
smuggled goods are collected and loaded onto trucks, or 
motorbikes, for onward transport to other Delta towns and Ho Chi 
Minh City.  At no point did Econoffs observe any official stops or 
searches of vehicles leaving Vinh Nguon or Chau Doc. 
 
11.  Local residents denied that drug trafficking occurred at this 
part of the border.  Although it did not appear that major drug 
trafficking was conducted at this particular border point, we 
cannot say for sure whether they knew and were telling us the full 
story or were simply cautious talking about a more lucrative and 
more dangerous trade.  Although they gleefully answered questions 
about used rice cookers and cigarettes, questions about narcotics 
brought shrugs. 
 
12.  The biggest surprise was what they said about their treatment 
by the border guards when they were occasionally caught.  The 
soldiers did not seek a payoff, they said, and offering a bribe 
was a bad idea.  They insisted the best approach was act to 
contrite and beg for pity.  This would generally bring release, 
whereas, the offer of a bribe would bring sure arrest and 
punishment. 
 
The Long Arm of the Law 
----------------------- 
13.  Econoffs returned to the border the next morning to see the 
\"dayshift\" at work.  Not long after we returned, one of the young 
men we met the night before roared up on the back of a motorbike 
and gestured for ConGen vehicle to follow.  The motorbike led us 
up the road to a dirt lot between two small houses.  One hundred 
feet back from the road the land dropped steeply to a wide expanse 
of paddy.  From this vantage point our self-appointed escorts 
pointed out Cambodia, perhaps about 1 kilometer away, separated 
from Vietnam by rice paddies criss-crossed by narrow paths atop 
dikes.  They also pointed out a large tin-roofed building just 
across the border.  This was the market where most of the local 
smugglers traveled to buy cigarettes as well as clothing and small 
appliances - mostly used.  Econoffs observed groups of people 
headed for Cambodia.  Several even stopped to tell us where they 
were going. 
 
14.  The presence of two Westerners and an SUV with diplomatic 
plates did not go unnoticed for long.  Locals began to drop by to 
check out Econoffs (along with the shiny SUV) who were observing 
the decidedly unagricultural activity in the rice fields.  In due 
course Econoffs were asked to follow uniformed border guards and a 
couple in plainclothes to the local police station - a request 
that followed their admonition that the ConGen group was in a 
restricted border area without official permission.  Deciding that 
accepting the invitation was the prudent course, ConGen vehicle 
followed a motorcycle to the commune police station for a two hour 
discussion of the border and our \"transgressions.\"  Of particular 
note during this episode was the presence of a young man on a 
motorbike.  He had also been at the official border crossing 25 
kilometers away during our earlier visit and had engaged in a 
hushed conversation with the officer in charge there. 
 
15.  At the police station, two plainclothes officials of the 
first name only variety advised Econoffs that foreign visitors 
require formal, written permission to visit the \"buffer area\" and 
claimed Econoffs had violated Vietnamese law.  They also requested 
official ID from the Americans in the ConGen group.  We explained 
that the hotel kept our IDs at check-in.  They refused to even 
look at our business cards. Econoffs noted that they were unaware 
of such a law, and, furthermore, Congen had informed the 
provincial ERO via diplomatic note of Econoffs\'s intention to 
visit the border.  This conversation recycled several times.  So 
it went for about 45 minutes with intermittent breaks for the 
officers to disappear into the back room to make phone calls, 
presumably seeking guidance.  During this period, ConGen FSN 
telephoned the local ERO and People\'s Committee to advise them of 
our situation and request assistance.  Econoffs also requested a 
copy of the law in question. 
 
16.  Eventually, a group of three border police arrived at the 
police station and the two plainclothes officials faded into the 
background.  Major Lan, deputy commander of a local border 
outpost, took over the discussion.  He was polite and even 
purchased bottled water for the Congen group with his own money. 
He stated firmly, however, that the ConGen group had entered a 
restricted area and had violated the law. Econoffs pointed out 
that while they knew that they had passed a sign labeled \"frontier 
area,\" they saw no warning that access was restricted.  On the 
contrary, Econoffs noted that the area seemed a beehive of 
activity with all sorts of people coming and going.    Econoffs 
noted that they had made no attempt to conceal their presence and 
had informed the provincial ERO of their intention to visit the 
border. 
 
17.  Evidently tipped off by our request to see the law in 
question, Major Lan produced an official pamphlet detailing Decree 
34/2000/ND-CP on the Regulation on the Land Border Areas of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The law states that foreigners who 
work for \"central bodies\" or who are hosted by Vietnamese 
organizations need to obtain various permissions to travel in a 
marked and defined \"border belt.\"  The law does not appear to 
envision diplomats or unaccompanied foreigners.  An attached 
circular notes that all visitors to the \"border belt\" must check- 
in with local authorities.  After reviewing the law, Major Lan 
then asked Econoffs to sign a \"minute\" that would document the 
presence of the Congen group in a restricted area, but that no 
fine or punishment would be levied.  Econoffs explained that while 
Major Lan should feel free to draft the \"minute,\" they could not 
sign it and at best could take it back to the Consulate for 
review.  As Major Lan chain-smoked Jet brand cigarettes, his 
deputy laboriously drafted, by hand, two identical \"minutes.\" 
With the completed \"minutes\" in hand, Major Lan reiterated the 
requirement that Econoffs sign them.  He said that if we did not 
sign,  we would not be detained but we would continue talking at 
the police station.  Econoffs replied that if we were not being 
detained, then we would leave.  No, he said, we would first need 
to sign. 
 
18.  Eventually Major Lan proposed an unusual solution. 
Throughout the visit to Vinh Nguon\'s police station, Econoffs 
shared the interview area with three actual smugglers caught that 
morning.  The unlucky trio run a store in HCMC\'s Tan Binh district 
and had been headed to Cambodia to pick up clothes and small 
electronics to replenish their inventory.  This was their third 
trip to Cambodia and their first brush with the authorities. 
Despite their unenviable position as guests of the police, the 
group did not seem worried.  Their mood seemed a mixture of 
boredom alternating with excitement at sharing the police station 
with American diplomats.  For the most part they passed their time 
smoking cigarettes and reading newspapers.  They did a lot of 
grinning.  The police took their cellphones upon arrival, so 
chatting on the phone was out.  Major Lan selected the leader of 
this group and asked Econoffs if this man could sign the \"minutes\" 
as a witness.  Econoffs responded that he was free to sign 
whatever he wanted to sign. 
 
19.  This was all Major Lan needed.  The witness signed the form 
and Major Lan decided business cards were perfectly suitable forms 
of identification, though he did say that the refusal to sign 
meant he could not give carbon copies of the \"minutes\" to 
Econoffs.  The gathering broke up with handshakes and offers of 
hospitality should Major Lan find himself in HCMC or should 
Econoffs return, properly announced, to Vinh Nguon.   After the 
goodbyes, the ConGen vehicle headed for HCMC while the trio of 
smugglers and assorted officials waved goodbye from the police 
station driveway. 
 
Comment 
------- 
20.  Even though Econoffs, Econ/Pol Assistant, and Congen driver 
were asked to spend a couple hours talking at the neighborhood 
police station, the police were never rude or threatening. 
Although they firmly stated that we had violated the law and 
admonished the FSNs that as Vietnamese they should have known 
better, they were generally polite.  At no time did they attempt 
to restrict our contact with the outside, and in fact we made 
several telephone calls.  Nor did they attempt to separate the 
local FSNs from American officers to try to intimidate them. 
Most likely, the officials on the scene and their behind-the- 
scenes superiors felt they could not ignore a foreign presence at 
the border that they believed to be illegal.  They chose to handle 
it in the gentlest way they knew how - by warning us, creating a 
piece of paper, and sending us on our way. 
 
21.  Comment continued:  The smuggling and other border activity 
that Econoffs witnessed in Chau Doc and at the nearby crossing was 
primarily local, and is dwarfed by the amount of trade, legal and 
otherwise, that crosses the border at Tay Ninh, which is the main 
route between Ho Chi Minh City and Phnom Penh.  Just because our 
local conversations did not turn up tales of trafficking in women 
or narcotics, however, does not mean that it is absent here, and 
both could easily occur. Other sources have named An Giang 
Province as having a problem with trafficking in women.  Border 
police readily admit that they have trouble monitoring this 
stretch - probably every stretch - of the border.   What appears 
to be happening here openly is that local border officials turn a 
rather benign eye to the activity of local residents that allow 
them to come and go freely and do much of their shopping \"duty 
free.\"

SUBJECT: PASTOR BUI VAN BA TO STAND TRIAL 
 
REF:  HCMC 000766 
 
1. (SBU)  Summary:  The Ho Chi Minh City District 11 People\'s 
Court will try Pastor Bui Van Ba on the morning of January 13, 
2004.  Pastor Ba, of the Full Gospel Assembly, is charged with 
assaulting a police officer in the course of his duties.  The 
charge stems from an August 18, 2003, altercation at an 
unregistered house church on Lac Long Quan Street in District 11 
(reftel).  The Protestant community in HCMC is taking steps to 
draw attention to Pastor Ba\'s trial.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  On the morning of August 18, 2003, police entered a 
house on Lac Long Quan Street in HCMC\'s District 11.  For at least 
18 months prior to the raid, Full Gospel Assembly members used the 
location as a place to conduct worship services.  Although the 
group is an unregistered Protestant sect, local authorities were 
aware of the worship services and police had never previously 
interfered. 
 
3.  (SBU)  The catalyst for the raid remains unclear.  Official 
documents passed to the ConGen describe the police action in 
technical terms as an attempt to check the identification 
documents of those inside the house.  Under Vietnamese law all 
occupants of a given address must be registered with the local 
authorities and police have the right to enter private residences 
to check identification cards against registrations. 
 
4.  (U)  Pastor Ba\'s wife, who suffers from a heart condition, 
fainted while police checked the identification cards of 
approximately 20 individuals gathered for the service.  Pastor Ba 
and his associates sought to take her to the hospital immediately 
but were prevented from leaving.  The situation grew heated and 
eventually Pastor Ba threw a couple of punches at the police and, 
as he told ConGen officers, at least one of the punches connected. 
He was subdued, arrested, and taken to the local police station 
along with eight other members of his group.  Police allowed 
another pastor to take Pastor Ba\'s wife to the hospital, where she 
recovered with no apparent lasting ill effects.  The detainees, 
including Pastor Ba, were released the following day.  Pastor Ba 
is in essence under house arrest pending the outcome of his trial. 
 
5.  (SBU)  Court documents passed to ConGen by members of the 
city\'s underground Protestant community indicate Pastor Ba\'s trial 
will take place on January 13, 2004.  He faces a charge of 
assaulting a police officer in the course of his duties.  In 
general the description of the incident in the court documents 
matches what we have heard from Pastor Ba and others, although the 
documents make no mention of religion or the unregistered house 
church. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship, of which Pastor Ba 
is General Secretary, has issued a written appeal for members to 
pray for Pastor Ba as he faces the upcoming trial.  Post 
understands a group of local Protestant pastors is circulating a 
petition on Pastor Ba\'s behalf that they plan to send to the 
government.  Given recent indications of a more activist approach, 
there may be additional activities to draw international attention 
to this case.

SUBJECT: HIV INFECTION RATES CLIMBING IN HCMC -- NEARING 
GENERALIZED EPIDEMIC LEVEL 
 
1.  Summary:  On a visit to Ho Chi Minh City, Staffdel McCormick 
from the House Committee on International Relations met with local 
government officials and NGO partners involved in the city\'s fight 
against HIV/AIDS.  Current estimates indicate that the infection 
rate in Vietnam is approaching one percent, a key measure of 
whether the disease is about to breakout into the general 
population.   Damning statistics highlight the growing problem: 
0.9% of pregnant women at the city\'s primary maternity hospital 
test HIV positive as do 3.4% of HCMC\'s military recruits.  The 
staff delegation visited a USAID-funded anonymous testing and 
counseling center that opened in 2001, which only attracts two to 
three clients per day.  Follow-on care available to individuals 
infected with HIV is extremely limited in Vietnam and infection is 
effectively a death sentence.  End Summary. 
 
Fear Epidemic Poised to Enter General Population 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
2.  On January 3, 2004, a staffdel led by James McCormick, Staff 
Director of the House International Relations Committee\'s (HIRC) 
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, met with officials from the 
Ho Chi Minh City AIDS Committee.  Staffdel members attending were: 
John Walker Roberts, Deputy Chief of Staff, HIRC; Peter Yeo, 
Minority Deputy Chief of Staff, HIRC; and, Douglas Anderson, 
Counsel, HIRC Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.  The AIDS 
committee, which is comprised of representatives of several city 
departments, is the last of its kind in Vietnam.  In mid-2003 the 
GVN restructured its response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and 
replaced all other provincial level HIV/AIDS Committees with the 
Ministry of Health as the lead agency at both the provincial and 
national level. In HCMC, however, the AIDS Committee has been able 
to reach across departments for a more coordinated approach. 
 
3.  A detailed briefing by Dr. Tran Thinh, Project Coordinator of 
the city\'s AIDS Committee, highlighted the growing HIV/AIDS 
problem in the city.  According to the committee\'s statistics, 
0.9% of pregnant women at the city\'s primary maternity hospital 
test HIV positive, as do 3.4% of the city\'s new military recruits. 
This is more than double the national average.  In the city\'s 
primary treatment center for TB and Lung disease, 1216 patients 
were HIV positive or sick with full-blown AIDS.  This number has 
increased every year and was only 165 in the year 2000.  Dr. Thinh 
noted that trends of infection showed that the new cases were 
getting younger, and the disease was increasingly common among 
women.  He stated that the highest prevalence for HIV was among 
intravenous drug users (heroin), but was increasing among 
commercial sex workers.  The big news, however, was that Thinh 
stated that the disease is apparently making the jump from high- 
risk groups to the population at large.  Both Dr. Thinh and NGOs 
say that the infection rate is probably between one half and one 
percent of the overall population in Vietnam, and higher in Ho Chi 
Minh City.  A one percent infection rate is the point at which the 
spread is considered a \"generalized\" as opposed to a concentrated 
epidemic.  Every testing category, from military recruits to 
pediatric patients and from sex workers to pregnant women, is 
marked by an increase in prevalence. 
 
No Treatment for HIV/AIDS 
------------------------- 
4.  Dr. Thinh provided a window on the grim fate faced by those 
that develop AIDS in HCMC.  Basically, anti-retroviral drugs are 
not available to the general population.  They are simply too 
expensive.  According to Dr. Thinh, the only anti-retroviral 
therapies subsidized by the government are limited to health-care 
providers exposed in the course of their duties.  The health care 
system is only providing treatment of opportunistic infections 
associated with AIDS and palliative care. 
 
5.  In Dr. Thinh\'s words, he is \"fighting a war with no soldiers, 
no supplies, and no strategy.\"  Trained healthcare workers are in 
short supply and the most effective therapies are in even shorter 
supply.  The nation spends only six cents per capita per year on 
HIV/AIDS, according to Dr. Thinh.  As for strategy, the HCMC AIDS 
Committee seems to understand that careful planning and 
coordinated action are key to countering the spread of the 
disease.  At this point, however, he noted that it is difficult 
for HCMC to take action without more policy guidance and material 
assistance from the central government.  Just the same, he said 
that even with the city\'s resource constraints, it was placing 
particular emphasis on testing and education, beyond the simple 
scare messages found on billboards nationwide.  He indicated the 
city was starting to provide some information to fifth graders 
(twelve year olds), since a lot of at-risk students left school 
after that.  Part of the overall effort is a USAID-funded 
anonymous testing center. In addition, USAID will be funding a new 
HIV/AIDS prevention program for high risk groups in HCMC. 
 
USAID Funds Anonymous Testing - 28% Positive 
-------------------------------------------- 
6.  Following Dr. Thinh\'s briefing, the staffdel met with program 
staff at the USAID-funded Anonymous Testing Site (ATS) in Binh 
Thanh District.  The ATS opened in November 2001 with funding and 
technical assistance from the University of California at San 
Francisco.  Currently, the ATS receives approximately 30,000 USD 
per year from USAID via Family Health International (FHI).  The 
ATS program, located above a `Condom Caf\' on a busy street in a 
mixed commercial/residential area, is modeled after HIV testing in 
the U.S.  This model affords clients anonymity in the testing 
process and professional counseling, both before and after the 
test. 
 
7.  The center currently sees only about 80-100 individuals every 
month.  Most are in their twenties, and men outnumber women two to 
one.  Most admit to at least one high-risk activity such as IV 
drug use, participation in the commercial sex trade, or 
unprotected sex.  Of those that walk in the door, 90% decide to 
have the test that day and 84% of those tested actually return for 
the results.  Approximately 28% of ATS clients test positive for 
HIV.  Post-test counseling for ATS clients includes counseling on 
future behavior and medical referral. 
 
8.  The first floor of the building that houses the ATS is a 
`Condom Caf.\'  In addition to the typical fare of coffee and pop 
p 
music, this caf\'s employees, all the beneficiaries of HIV/AIDS 
peer educator training, dispense literature on risky behavior as 
well as condoms.  The caf, reportedly popular with local youth, 
was founded by a French NGO but has since passed to the control of 
district health officials who operate and fund it. 
 
9.  The ATS program staff stated that they would like to expand 
the center\'s services to include U.S.-style support groups for 
those that test positive for HIV.  They also talked about the 
value of expanding the advertising campaign to increase the number 
of individuals taking advantage of the center\'s testing services. 
According to an American physician working with the ATS, an 
estimated 50-75% of Vietnamese infected with HIV are unaware of 
their status. 
 
10.  Comment: Without effective drug therapies available to the 
general population and without testing in meaningful numbers, the 
committee must find new resources, build capacity, and redouble 
e 
its public awareness campaigns if it is to make any kind of 
headway. 
 
11.  Staffdel McCormick did not have an opportunity to clear this 
cable before their departure.

AND UBCV BUDDHISTS IN HUE 
 
 
Summary 
------- 
1. (U) Dr. Scott Flipse, senior policy analyst at the U.S. 
Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) traveled 
through Hanoi, Hue, the Central Highlands, and Ho Chi Minh City on 
an official fact-finding mission from January 7-16.  He was joined 
by Mr. George Phillips, from the office of Rep. Chris Smith (R- 
NJ), and Ms. Hannah Royal, from the office of Senator Sam 
Brownback (R-KS), who traveled in their personal capacities under 
the sponsorship of a U.S.-based NGO, the Committee for Religious 
Freedom in Vietnam, which was represented on this trip by 
Vietnamese-American Catholic priest Tam Tran.  Septels report on 
their meetings in Hanoi, the Central Highlands and HCMC. 
 
2. (SBU) While in Hue on January 10, the CIRFDEL held official 
discussions with the Chairman of the Provincial People\'s Committee 
and the Archbishop of the Hue Archdiocese.  The delegation 
declined a number of other official appointments suggested by the 
People\'s Committee in favor of arranging their own meeting with 
the highest-ranking Buddhist monk of the local branch of the 
outlawed UBCV.  They were less successful in attempts to meet 
secretly with a local dissident Catholic priest at his home, where 
 
SIPDIS 
they were turned away close to midnight by a large security 
detail.  The meetings produced mixed messages on the situation for 
the large Catholic and Buddhist communities in the province (there 
are very few Protestants in Hue).  While their private meetings 
confirmed the very real problems faced by the underground Buddhist 
church and a small number of Catholic dissidents, the official 
meetings sounded a much more positive note on the overall freedom 
to practice religion in Thue Thien-Hue. 
 
People\'s Committee Cites Overall Improvements, but Slams 
Dissenters 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
- 
3. (SBU) In their meeting with Chairman Nguyen Van Me of the Thua 
Thien-Hue Provincial People\'s Committee, the CIRFDEL outlined the 
potential for the human rights/religious freedom situation in 
Vietnam to slow down an otherwise growing bilateral relationship 
with the U.S.  Citing the weight of the evidence from a large 
number of similar complaints as proof that the situation was 
deteriorating, they affirmed they were seeking nothing more than 
for Vietnam to adhere to the standards it had already acceded to 
in various international agreements and lift the restrictions on 
religious practice and organization.  Raising the continued 
harassment of local monks from the banned Unified Buddhist Church 
of Vietnam (UBCV), they questioned what threat a small group of 
elderly monks could pose to Vietnam\'s national security.  Noting 
that central government officials in Hanoi blamed local officials 
for any unintended violations of Vietnam\'s constitutional 
protections of religious freedom, they asked Chairman Me for his 
views on the situation in Hue. 
 
4. (SBU) Chairman Me hoped that the United States would see the 
human rights/religious freedom issue in Vietnam through a wider 
and more culturally sensitive lens, and stressed that American 
values, unlike American products, could not be exported wholesale 
without regard to the cultural values of the receiving state.  He 
also focused heavily on the importance of preserving national 
unity and social stability, accusing a small group associated with 
the former southern regime of using religion to regain power. 
Drawing frequently on the legacy of the war and the misdeeds of 
his former adversaries, the Chairman stressed that the GVN had 
chosen not to punish their old foes in the interest of national 
reconciliation, the latest example of which was the visa just 
issued to former Republic of Vietnam Prime Minister and later Vice 
President Nguyen Cao Ky to celebrate Tet with family and friends 
in his homeland for the first time in almost 30 years.  The 
Chairman said he was well aware of the regular Internet traffic 
reporting on alleged violations of human rights/religious freedom 
from both inside and outside the country, but pointed to greater 
economic freedom and the GVN\'s focus on improving living 
conditions overall as proof of the government\'s good intentions. 
 
5. (SBU) Falling back on statistics to demonstrate what he 
described as an ever improving religious freedom situation, he 
said there were currently 500 Buddhist monks and nearly as many 
pagodas in Hue, a number of which had been recently constructed or 
renovated to serve the province\'s 440,000 Buddhists (nearly 50 
percent of the population).  The Hue Institute of Buddhism, 
established just five years ago, had trained over 500 monks and 
scholars, some of whom had been sent overseas for post-graduate 
study.  The Buddhists were able to publish religious materials and 
organize charitable activities, such as kindergartens for orphans 
and health care facilities for the poor.  The Chairman described 
similar developments for the province\'s 55,000 Catholics.  Nearly 
all of Hue\'s 115 churches -- staffed by 110 priests and hundreds 
of lay workers -- had been rebuilt since the war, and the Hue 
seminary was set shortly to receive 40 new students for its sixth 
incoming class.  Like the Buddhists, the Catholics were able to 
operate orphanages and health centers for the disabled and poor. 
 
6. (SBU) Returning to the war legacy and national reconciliation, 
Chairman Me stated repeatedly that the GVN did not want to arrest 
religious leaders, but was forced to do so when they flagrantly 
violated Vietnam\'s laws.  Even then, he said, they arrested only 
the \"soldiers,\" and only after giving them numerous chances to 
cease their political activities.  He noted that the UBCV\'s own 
leadership had chosen to integrate with the Vietnam Buddhist 
Sangha (VBS) -- an organization that now represented 99 percent of 
the country\'s Buddhists -- in 1981.  Dismissing the notion of the 
UBCV as a separate entity, he questioned why the GVN should allow 
a few dissident monks to break away and form an independent church 
when they represented only troublemakers waving the flag of the 
former regime from overseas.  Softening his stance just a bit, he 
observed that the UBCV would not have had any problems if they had 
just operated quietly, without openly declaring their hostility 
and opposition to the government.  Citing the example of Le Quang 
Liem -- a former Hoa Hao militia leader during the war and now a 
vocal critic of the government recognized Hoa Hao religious 
organization -- he claimed that supporters of the old regime had 
simply replaced their military uniforms with clerical robes to 
continue the fight against the current government under the guise 
of religion. 
 
7. (SBU) Chairman Me made it quite clear that individuals who used 
the cloak of religion to fight against the government would not be 
tolerated.  He noted that dissident Catholic priest Thaddeus 
Nguyen Van Ly was in prison because he had ignored repeated 
warnings to cease his political activities, not for practicing his 
faith.  He criticized the delegation for attempting to visit 
Father Ly\'s associate, Father Phan Van Loi, the previous evening, 
and asked why they would want to meet with an underling if they 
had already met with Father Ly in Hanoi.  Asked directly if he 
could give his approval for the delegation to meet with him later 
in the day, he claimed not to even know where Father Loi lived, 
(despite the fact that close to 20 security officials were posted 
outside his home the previous evening when the delegation stopped 
by unannounced).  He did, however, seem to know enough about the 
case to raise doubts as to whether Father Loi had ever been 
ordained as a priest (he was apparently ordained in secret in a 
northern diocese and did not have the Church\'s permission to serve 
as a priest in Hue).  Noting that Father Loi represented no one 
but himself, he directed the delegation to the materials the 
dissident priest had himself placed on the Internet for insight 
into why his movements might currently be restricted. 
 
8. (SBU) Chairman Me quickly dismissed the question of confiscated 
Catholic properties in the province as one of eminent domain, 
although he admitted that some land had been redistributed 
immediately after the war.  Regarding the Shrine of Our Lady of 
Perpetual Help, claimed by the Redemptorist Order, he said the 
former Archbishop of Hue had donated the property to the 
government.  He attributed more recent allegations of government 
intrusion on the grounds of the Thien An Benedictine Monastery and 
the Ke Sung Church to the routine development of necessary 
infrastructure projects (although he made sure to point out that 
the grounds around Thien An had been confiscated originally due to 
their use by former South Vietnamese President Diem as a base for 
anti-communist activities).  Other Catholic properties had been 
turned into much needed schools and health care facilities. 
 
Hue Archbishop Guarded but Mostly Positive 
------------------------------------------ 
9. (SBU) Sounding a relatively more positive tone, Hue Archbishop 
Nguyen Nhu The characterized the fundamental issue as conflicting 
definitions of religious freedom.  While the government viewed 
freedom to worship as the overriding goal, the Catholic Church saw 
it as encompassing much more.  He hoped the views of the two sides 
would merge over time.  He already believed that things were 
getting better every year, and hoped that the international 
community would advocate for his church in a sensitive way that 
respected the Asian mentality.  Anything more direct would be 
counterproductive to the goals of the Church.  While they still 
needed government approval to ordain priests, those approvals were 
getting easier to obtain, and he had personally ordained 53 
priests in his 10 years at the Archdiocese.  The seminary, 
meanwhile, was able to draw seminarians from the Archdiocese of 
Hue, Danang, and Kontum. 
 
10. (SBU) Describing the Father Ly case as complicated, he said 
that he had often counseled the priest on his behavior and even 
worked out an agreement to move him to a new parish without any 
prodding from the government.  Unfortunately, Father Ly had 
continued his activities at the new parish, despite the 
Archbishop\'s frequent warnings that priests should not be involved 
in politics.  The Archbishop noted that he had sent a delegation 
of clergy and lay workers to visit Father Ly after his arrest and 
that he had found God in prison.  He knew that Father Loi had at 
one time been under government restrictions after Father Ly\'s 
arrest in April 2001, but thought the recent presence of security 
agents outside his home the previous night might have been related 
to the fact that police knew the delegation was in town.  He 
stated plainly that Father Loi had no canonical relationship with 
the Hue Archdiocese and had never sought his permission to join. 
(Note:  According to the CIRFDEL\'s unofficial interpreter, local 
officials had once told Father Loi that he could become part of 
the Hue Archdiocese if he renounced Father Ly.  The interpreter 
also described Father Loi as one of four Catholic priests to call 
for the complete overthrow of the GVN.  End note.) 
 
11. (SBU) The Archbishop said they hadn\'t asked for the return of 
any confiscated properties because government limitations on 
charitable works left them with little use for the old hospitals 
and schools.  He claimed not to know the status of the Thien An 
property, but said the monks were in dialogue with the government 
on the issue.  He didn\'t think the monks wanted all of the 
original 107 hectares back -- just enough for a buffer zone to 
maintain a spiritual environment.  He was even less sure of the 
status of the Redemptorist property, although he thought the 
government had already built a clinic on the site.  He had heard 
of a physical altercation involving the police and several church 
workers trying to stop road construction outside the Ke Sung 
Church, but didn\'t think it was very serious.  Looking at the case 
from a legal standpoint, he said the Church was fine with building 
a new road if it was open to the general public and didn\'t affect 
the spiritual environment.  Nevertheless, the Church had also 
prepared a proposal for an alternative road to be funded by the 
Archdiocese.  As for the Marian Shrine at La Vang -- a property 
located outside the provincial border in neighboring Quang Tri 
Province, but within his Archdiocese -- the Archbishop said that 
while there had been complete freedom for pilgrims over the last 
five to six years, the local district People\'s Committee still 
refused to recognize the Church\'s ownership, despite recognition 
at the provincial level.  Overall, he thought relations were 
better with Thua Thien-Hue than with Quang Tri. 
 
UBCV Monks Resist GVN Control 
----------------------------- 
12. (SBU) The CIRFDEL made an unannounced stop at Tu Hieu Pagoda 
to visit with Thich Thien Hanh, leader of the influential Hue 
branch of the UBCV.  As with the attempted visit to Father Loi, 
the local authorities seemed to know the delegation was planning 
to visit, and two individuals loitering outside the premises 
entered the monk\'s chamber bearing wrapped Tet gifts just ahead of 
the delegation.  Those apparent security agents, and another two 
or three who arrived as the meeting began, eavesdropped visibly 
from just inside the door for the first 20 minutes, until Thich 
Hien Hanh rose from his chair and ushered them out the door. 
Although he whispered quite a bit, Thich Hien Hanh did not seem 
uncomfortable speaking in the presence of security officials.  He 
told the group he was feeling well after his hunger strike in late 
October, but was not allowed to leave the pagoda without 
permission.  He had been able to send a monk to visit Thich Huyen 
Quang in Quy Nhon five days earlier and confirmed that the UBCV 
Patriarch\'s health was good and he was getting adequate medical 
attention.  Unfortunately, there was a large police presence at 
his pagoda, and he appeared to be living under the threat that he 
would be moved to a pagoda near Nha Trang if he did anything to 
attract attention.  For that reason, Thich Thien Hanh asked that 
USG officials refrain from attempting to visit the Patriarch for 
the time being.  The Hue Buddhist leader also acknowledged that he 
was in telephone contact with UBCV Deputy Thich Quang Do, 
currently under unofficial pagoda detention in HCMC, and that he 
was also in reasonably good health. 
 
13. (SBU) Thich Thien Hanh blamed the problems of the UBCV on the 
fact that the communists simply didn\'t like religion and wanted to 
eliminate groups it could not control, but vowed that the UBCV 
would never submit to GVN influence.  He attributed the GVN\'s 
seemingly schizophrenic treatment of the UBCV, from the spring 
2003 releases of the UBCV\'s top leadership to the autumn 2003 
crackdown, to a split within the GVN and the Party over how to 
deal with the religious issue.  Under the current restrictions, it 
was difficult to groom young leaders and communicate the basic 
message to UBCV followers, especially when believers could be 
punished simply for visiting monks like him.  Fortunately, he was 
able to maintain contact with the outside world, including to the 
International Buddhist Information Bureau in Paris, through 
Internet hookups hidden inside the pagoda.  He hoped foreign 
governments would use official development assistance to pressure 
the GVN and the Communist Party -- the real beneficiaries of such 
aid -- to change their policies, despite the economic impact on 
the general populace.  The poor, he said, would suffer anyway.

PROTESTANTS IN THE CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) The religious situation for Protestants in Gia Lai and 
Dak Lak provinces has seen some real improvements in the last 
three months, according to both government officials and 
Protestant leaders who met with two USG delegations in early 
January.  Official registrations for new Protestant churches were 
up in each province, new pastors were ordained, and there were no 
significant incidents of religious oppression to report over the 
Christmas holidays.  While difficulties remained, including a 
bureaucratic, cumbersome process for registering new churches, the 
overall mood was more positive than it has been at any time since 
the ethnic unrest of 2001.  The delegations stressed Washington\'s 
interest in religious freedom in Vietnam and the importance of 
allowing USG officials access to provide first-hand reporting on 
any allegations of abuse.  After initially refusing to meet the 
delegations due to the late notice and the impending Tet Lunar New 
Year holidays, Gia Lai and Dak Lak provincial officials, with some 
pressure from the Office of the National Assembly and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, were generally cooperative with scheduling 
requests. 
 
2. (U) Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations 
staff members Paul Grove and Mark Lippert traveled through Hanoi, 
the Central Highlands, and Ho Chi Minh City from January 7-10. 
During roughly the same time frame (January 7-16), Dr. Scott 
Flipse, senior policy analyst at the U.S. Commission on 
International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), covered much of the same 
terrain, with the addition of Hue, on an official fact-finding 
mission.  He was joined by Mr. George Phillips, from the office of 
Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), and Ms. Hannah Royal, from the office of 
Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), who traveled in their personal 
capacities under the sponsorship of a U.S.-based NGO, the 
Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam, which was represented 
on the trip by Vietnamese-American Catholic priest Tam Tran.  This 
cable covers the meetings of both delegations in the Central 
Highlands.  Septels report on their meetings elsewhere in Vietnam. 
 
----------------------------------------- 
Gia Lai:  Better Treatment, Lack of Space 
----------------------------------------- 
 
3.  (SBU) Staffdel Grove met with government and religious leaders 
in Gia Lai province on January 9.  Appointments included the Gia 
Lai People\'s Committee, the Committee on Ethnic Minority and 
Religious Affairs, and the Gia Lai Representative Board of the 
government recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV).  The Staffdel also paid an officially arranged visit to a 
Gia Rai ethnic minority village.  The CIRFDEL drove through the 
province a few days later, without having arranged any official 
appointments or notified local authorities.  They were scolded by 
local officials for meeting informally with members of the SECV 
Board, and physically blocked from visiting a nearby village 
unannounced.  Reminding ConGenoff that the Consulate General\'s 
consular district did not extend beyond Ho Chi Minh City, 
provincial authorities were upset that they had not been asked to 
arrange the SECV meeting and that the CIRFDEL was making impromptu 
stops along the public highway running through Gia Lai.  (Note: 
CIRFDEL did request and receive official appointments in nearby 
Dak Lak Province -- see below.  End note.) 
 
4.  (SBU) In all of their meetings, Staffdel Grove stressed that 
Congress is concerned about religious freedom in Vietnam and that 
it was important to give access to USG officials so they could 
provide first-hand, accurate reporting on allegations of abuse. 
In a philosophical discussion spanning both the official meeting 
and a dinner, Chairman Nguyen Vi Ha compared free expression to a 
portrait of a naked woman -- something that could be admired for 
its beauty by some, yet drive others to do bad things.  In Mr. 
Ha\'s view, the government was responsible for ensuring that free 
expression did not become harmful.  Chairman Ha highlighted his 
own religious tolerance by pointing out that he had at least one 
family member following each major religion in the province. 
Staffdel Grove reminded him of his responsibility to ensure that 
other local officials throughout the province were tolerant as 
well.  The Deputy Chairman of the provincial Committee on Ethnic 
Minority and Religious Affairs reported that three new Protestant 
churches had been approved in December 2003, bringing the 
provincial total to ten. 
 
5. (SBU) The SECV Board confirmed that three churches had been 
approved,  pending additional paperwork.  They did not seem at all 
concerned about the last few bureaucratic requirements.  They said 
the three new churches -- in Plei Betel, Plei Breng, and Plei 
Athat -- would serve a total of 6500 believers in 22 villages, 
raising to 10,000 the number of the province\'s approximately 
71,000 Protestants who would be able to worship in registered 
churches.  SECV leaders reported no significant incidents in Gia 
Lai province involving Christmas celebrations.  While both 
registered and unregistered Protestant groups had been permitted 
to gather in most areas, they declined to comment further on a few 
groups who had special problems with local authorities.  When 
asked what the USG could do to assist Christians in the province, 
SECV leaders told Staffdel Grove that the biggest issue they faced 
was a lack of real church buildings anywhere in Gia Lai.  While 
provincial authorities had returned confiscated properties to 
other religious groups, they had yet to return anything to the 
Protestants, or even allocate land for new construction.  The SECV 
Board members specifically requested that any USG pressure on this 
issue not be traceable back to the Board, however. 
 
6. (SBU) Chairman Ha had told Staffdel Grove that the registration 
process could be as simple as a verbal agreement between a church 
and local authorities, while the Committee on Religious Affairs 
had further mentioned approvals from commune-level People\'s 
Committees and the screening of church members for good 
citizenship.  The SECV Board members, on the other hand, described 
a bureaucratic process that involved submitting a total of eleven 
documents to as many as nine different offices, including: local 
and provincial People\'s Committees, Fatherland Front Committees, 
and Mass Mobilization Committees, as well as the Ministry of 
Public Security.  Only then could a church hold a General 
Conference and select a Council of Deacons, requirements imposed 
by the SECV Charter, not the GVN.  The GVN, however, does require 
that the General Conference Minutes be transmitted to local 
authorities. 
 
7. (SBU) Meeting unofficially with the CIRFDEL on January 11, a 
member of the SECV Board discussed his impressions of the current 
situation at greater length.  He said that things were better now 
than in the past, but mostly because they couldn\'t have gotten any 
worse.  (Note:  The trend toward improvement echoes comments by 
underground Protestant leaders in HCMC, who told Staffdel 
McCormick in a meeting earlier in January that the Central 
Highlands was an area where the religious freedom situation was 
getting better.  End note.)  The most difficult times were during 
1979-1999, with modest improvement and fewer restrictions since 
2000.  The SECV Board member attributed those positive changes to 
international pressure and Vietnam\'s desire to integrate into the 
world community, and asked for a combination of continued 
international pressure -- including visits by more USG delegations 
--and ongoing dialogue.  He thought it would be useful for other 
countries to share with the GVN their own laws on religion, so the 
GVN would see where it was out of step. 
 
8. (SBU) The SECV Board members told the CIRFDEL that uneven 
implementation of the central GVN\'s policies on religion by local 
authorities continued to be the biggest problem.  While government 
treatment of registered churches was generally better than that 
for house churches, most unregistered congregations still enjoyed 
tacit approval from local authorities to continue their religious 
activities.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to get land for 
construction and believers were reluctant to contribute money when 
they thought the government should just return confiscated 
properties -- there were 38 churches in Gia Lai pre-1975 -- or 
build replacements.  Registrations were being processed slowly in 
part because congregations did not meet the criteria and were not 
always well organized.  In addition, small provincial staffs were 
untrained to deal with the flood of applications they faced. 
Priority was being given to churches that existed pre-1975, 
including the three whose  applications were submitted in 
September and approved in December. 
 
9. (SBU) Regarding church closures, this SECV Board members joked 
that there had been nothing left to close after the initial 
crackdown in the wake of the ethnic unrest of 2001.  Turning more 
serious, he noted that local authorities tended to be more subtle 
in their methods in Gia Lai than in Dak Lak.  Gia Lai relied on 
persuasion, not force, to convince congregations to disband.  Some 
house churches had been physically closed down, but most had 
either moved or simply continued to function at their original 
locations.  He said the government was generally lenient with 
pastors it regarded as authentic believers, but not with those who 
attempted to use religion as a means of opposing the government. 
The same government approach to disbanding churches had been 
applied to renunciations.  While the government had ceased 
attempting to force Christians to renounce their faith two years 
ago, they were now relying on other methods -- such as offering 
material benefits to those who renounced.  Despite the 
difficulties, Protestant numbers continued to rise, as many came 
to see Christians as positive role models and sought to emulate 
them.  According to the SECV member\'s records, there were only 
3500 Protestants in Gia Lai in 1975, versus the 71,000 today. 
 
10. (SBU) According to these SECV Board members, there were two 
negative forces at work in the Central Highlands which actively 
oppose the GVN.  One was composed of purely political Dega 
separatists, and another used religion to pursue their separatist 
aims.  Both factions enjoyed backing from U.S.- based supporters. 
Real Protestant believers might sympathize with Dega nationalism 
and the desire to preserve traditional culture, but could never 
approve of using violent methods to attain those goals.  He 
described the ethnic unrest of 2001 as an ethnic conflict, not a 
religious one, although the two were certainly linked, with ethnic 
minority resentment directed squarely at majority Vietnamese Kinh 
coming down from the north to reap the benefits of their land. 
 
11. (SBU) At Staffdel Grove\'s request, Gia Lai provincial 
officials had arranged for the delegation to visit Mo Rong Ngo 4, 
in Ia Ka commune, Chu Pa district, a village that reportedly 
contained some returnees from Cambodia who had resettled in 
Vietnam independently of UNHCR.  Upon arrival in the village, 
however, the delegation was informed that only one household had 
any connection to Cambodia.  Ksor Hom (a Gia Rai minority male) 
had reportedly crossed to Cambodia and been resettled in America, 
leaving behind his wife, Ro Cham A Lo, and eight children. 
Nervous and speaking through a Gia Lai provincial interpreter, Ro 
Cham A Lo told Staffdel Grove that she did not know when her 
husband had left Vietnam and had not heard from him, although she 
was aware of rumors that he might be in America.  (Note:  Post\'s 
refugee resettlement section will follow up on her husband\'s 
status.  End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
Dak Lak:  New GVN Directive on Protestant Churches Brings Hope 
--------------------------------------------- ----------------- 
 
12. (SBU) On January 12, the CIRFDEL met officially with the Dak 
Lak People\'s Committee, the Committees on Ethnic Minority and 
Religious Affairs, the Fatherland Front, and the provincial SECV 
Representative Board.  People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang 
expressed disappointment that the United States did not seem to 
understand the real human rights/religious freedom situation in 
Vietnam, despite improvements in many other facets of the 
bilateral relationship.  Citing the many economic gains he had 
seen since his arrival in the province in 1975, he said that the 
lives of Dak Lak\'s 600,000 ethnic minority residents had improved 
dramatically.  The CIRFDEL laid out concerns over continuing 
reports of closed churches, forced renunciations and leaked 
government documents detailing a campaign to stamp out 
Christianity.  The CIRFDEL asked Chairman Lang for his views on 
GVN claims that any violations of human rights/religious freedom 
were due to mistakes at the local level.  They reminded their 
Vietnamese interlocutors that they were talking about 
international standards to which the GVN had voluntarily acceded, 
and expressed hope that this issue would not become an impediment 
to an otherwise improving bilateral relationship. 
 
13. (SBU) Chairman Lang noted that Dak Lak\'s Christians were 
happier than at any time in the past, although they still 
sometimes faced problems from local officials who did not fully 
understand the GVN\'s policies.  In addition to the usual rounds of 
visits from provincial and local officials, Protestant leaders 
this past Christmas had received personal visits from First Deputy 
Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and other high-level officials for 
the first time.   Chairman Lang disputed the number of closed 
churches provided by the CIRFDEL, saying the province\'s 200,000 
Christians were served by hundreds of churches.  Besides, he 
retorted, there were only 7000 Protestants in Dak Lak in 1975, so 
there couldn\'t have been hundreds of churches to close in the 
past.  He acknowledged only that two specific church properties in 
the Ban Me Thuot area had been confiscated shortly after the war 
for concealing weapons and documents pertaining to FULRO 
separatists.  (An otherwise very unfriendly Chairman of the 
provincial Fatherland Front Committee seemed quite confident that 
procedures were underway to return these two churches.) 
 
14. (SBU) The Chairman of the Religious Affairs Committee, 
however, admitted to the closure of hundreds of places where 
Christians had gathered illegally to pray.  (Post Note:  Closure 
in this sense often means asking people not to meet for group 
religious services in the house/building anymore, since these 
premises often serve other purposes, e.g., prayer services in 
people\'s homes.  The Chairman explicitly said that a family would 
always be allowed to worship in its own home.  End Note.) 
However, while the government still had problems with the Dega 
movement, he said, there was no campaign to suppress peaceful, 
nonpolitical worship.  The Religious Affairs Committee chairman 
observed that peaceful Christians were often responsible for 
turning in Dega leaders after hearing their sermons calling for 
the overthrow of the GVN.  Noting how poverty currently prevented 
many Christians from purchasing land to construct new churches, he 
said Dak Lak province had already provided land to one new church 
in Phuoc An, and hoped to do the same for other congregations, now 
that the SECV had disclaimed any relationship with the Dega 
movement.  He also said the province had taken steps to speed up 
the registration process, as evidenced by the approval of three 
new churches and the ordination of three new pastors just that 
month. 
 
15. (SBU) According to Chairman Lang, another big impediment to 
the further development of Protestantism in Dak Lak was the need 
for more trained pastors.  He said he was working with the SECV to 
open a Bible training school in the provincial capital.  While he 
agreed with the CIRFDEL that he and other Dak Lak officials also 
needed a better understanding of religion, he chafed at a proposal 
for some sort of joint venture with the USG to provide training 
for his own officials.  He saw no need for foreigners to tell him 
how to deal with religious issues in his own province, although he 
left it open for the central government to agree to such a plan. 
 
16. (SBU) A subsequent meeting with the provincial SECV Board, as 
well as with a local pastor who has been a long time contact of 
the Consulate General, confirmed much of what the CIRFDEL had been 
told in its other meetings regarding the three new churches, three 
new pastors and the promise of a bible school.  Asked to comment 
on a recent Human Rights Watch report detailing a new Christmas 
crackdown, the Board members contradicted that dire portrayal. 
Noting that 2003 had been a huge improvement over 2002, they said 
they had been able to hold big services wherever there were 
pastors, and smaller celebrations elsewhere.  (Even the previous 
Christmas, they said, while some number of believers had been 
detained for unknown reasons, they could think of no pastors who 
had been imprisoned.)  What they now needed most was more 
churches, more Bibles (the Religious Affairs Chairman promised the 
CIRFDEL he was in the process of printing one million new Bibles), 
and better training.  Training for local officials would also be 
helpful, since most problems started at the local level. 
 
17. (SBU) Commenting further on the claims of massive church 
closures, the Board members thought many had closed simply because 
people had moved away, or because there weren\'t enough pastors to 
go around.  They admitted that in fact some congregations were 
also Dega, something which had driven the government to send out 
letters requesting churches to close until the membership could be 
vetted in the first place.  (They believed quite firmly, however, 
that none of their SECV pastors were Dega.)  Many churches had 
been allowed to reopen since 2001, even though they were still 
unregistered.  The SECV Board members also acknowledged problems 
with trying to even calculate the number of churches in the 
province.  They thought there could be thousands, depending on 
what definition was used, with many villages having three or more. 
The local SECV pastor questioned reports of beatings and forced 
renunciations, noting that lots of people broke laws and went to 
jail for things that had nothing to do with religion.  In a 
similar vein, he thought people complained about many things that 
were unfair, but he had no personal knowledge of anyone who had 
ever been discriminated against in employment, education, or 
medical care for being Christian.  He caveated his remarks by 
acknowledging he did not always know what was happening in remote 
areas, or among non-SECV churches. 
 
18. (SBU) For the future, much hope seemed to rest on new GVN 
directive 782/TGCP-TL (septel), distributed to the Dak Lak SECV 
Board by the National Committee for Religious Affairs on December 
4, 2003.  The decree reportedly calls for the \"continuation of the 
normalization of operations of the SECV in the Central Highlands 
and Binh Phuoc Province.\"  (Note:  No one mentioned this decree to 
either delegation in Gia Lai.  End note.)  Based on this new 
directive, the SECV Board was planning to ask its adherents to 
submit some form of certification that they were not Dega to the 
local authorities in advance of applying for registration.  The 
local SECV pastor told the CIRFDEL that circumstances had improved 
dramatically since the release of this directive, although they 
had already begun to improve in September.  Government officials 
had changed completely in the way they treated Protestants.  Even 
so, he predicted registrations would continue to move slowly, due 
to small number of provincial staff assigned to process 
applications. 
 
19. (SBU) Note:  A representative of the Office of the National 
Assembly\'s foreign affairs section was dispatched to accompany 
Staffdel Grove on the trip through the Central Highlands at the 
last minute, and stayed in Dak Lak to greet the CIRFDEL for the 
second leg of their trip.  The ONA representative encouraged the 
Embassy and Consulate General to work with his office on future 
visits, but later threatened a formal protest when he was excluded 
from meetings with religious leaders by both delegations. 
Interestingly, the Gia Lai and Dak Lak provincial authorities 
proved more cooperative on this visit,  where they had been 
notified in advance (paras. 1 and 3).  Unlike the ONA 
representative, they did not protest when the delegations asked 
for private meetings with religious groups nor did they interrupt 
those meetings (as they had sometimes on previous visits.)  End 
note. 
 
20. (U) Neither Staffdel Grove nor the CIRFDEL had the opportunity 
to clear on this cable before their departures.

SUBJECT: ACROBATS, BEER BELLIES AND FLOATS - VIETNAM HONORS 
TRADEMARKS 
 
1.  Although counterfeit and pirated goods are readily available 
virtually everywhere in Vietnam, government and business is more 
and more realizing the importance and value of brands and 
trademarks.  On January 30, Ho Chi Minh City organized a \"Festival 
Honoring Vietnamese Trademarks\" which was hosted by the Chairman 
of the HCMC People\'s Committee and broadcast on primetime 
television.  The Festival was a parade of 34 floats representing 
some of the country\'s most famous trademarks.  Several firms were 
given awards.  \"This is the way in which we express our gratitude 
to the businesses which have made contributions to the city and 
the nation,\" remarked Chairman Le Thanh Hai in his opening speech. 
 
2.  Thousands of people - some ringers for the companies 
participating  - lined the parade route and clapped and cheered. 
Floats represented companies such as Trung Nguyen Coffee, whose 
minivan fit inside an enormous sculpted elephant led by a team of 
ethnic minority acrobats.  Agifish, a large seafood company, was 
represented by a giant basa fish.  Saigon Beer impressed everyone 
with truth in advertising -- their float was preceded by a smiling 
man with an artificially-padded beer belly.   It was not just 
bellies that were big - Viet Tien garments had a group of marching 
giant shirts, complete with giant Viet Tien labels.  Bitis, a 
local shoe company, had, of course, a giant shoe.  The audience 
was also treated to a giant wrench, an enormous pencil, and a 
vehicle-sized t-pot (from Minh Long I).  The most unusual float, 
however, was a huge pair of toenail clippers from Nghia Nippers. 
Private and state-owned companies participated, and Kymdan Co. 
hedged its bet by erecting a large hammer and sickle atop its 
float that was largely dedicated to foam - its primary product. 
After giant toenail clippers, the traditional dragon dances, 
marching fashion models, and ethnic drummers gave a more 
traditional feel to some of the entries. 
 
3.  The event could not have been mistaken for the Rose Bowl 
Parade, but the crowds had an enormous amount of fun.  So, 
evidently, did the CEOs of some of the participating companies. 
The Chairman of Dapha, a private bottled-water company, personally 
directed his company\'s float along the parade route.  Dressed 
entirely in black, he paced his employees through their dance 
routine and gave the order to launch the balloons at just the 
right moment. 
 
4.  Crowd control was a bit crude, however.  A couple of blocks 
beyond the main reviewing stand, police were having difficulty 
moving crowds back from the parade route.  In an isolated 
incident, the police simply got out their electric cattle prods, 
which after a few applications, quickly cleared the route. 
 
5.  Comment:  This parade did not make international headlines, 
but it did serve to remind that the HCMC government recognizes the 
important role that business plays in the city\'s  development.  It 
was a beginner\'s attempt to popularize the concept of trademark 
protection (all of the floats featured \"Quality crafted with pride 
in Vietnam\" seals of approval).  The ceremony and parade also 
illustrated that Vietnamese government, business, and consumers 
are becoming more brand conscious and are aware of the value of 
protecting brands and trademarks.  It is a long way from a 
trademark parade to pro-active IPR protection for local and 
foreign rights holders, but HCMC has made this first official 
\"populist\" effort to educate its residents.

REF:  HCMC 0084 
 
1.  (SBU) A December decree from the GVN National Committee on 
Religious Affairs, provided to ConGen by the Dak Lak province 
Representative Board of the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV), promised new steps to \"normalize\" the operation of 
Protestant churches in the Central Highlands. 
 
2.  (SBU) COMMENT: The decree has caused considerable excitement 
among some Central Highlands Protestant leaders, who have started 
developing their own plans to implement the steps of the decree 
(reftel).  This decree may also account for some of the reports of 
better treatment of the Protestants in the Central Highlands and 
the lack of reported incidents of serious oppression over 
Christmas 2003.

Summary 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) Local religious leaders offered up fewer specific 
complaints of violent or coercive acts of religious oppression and 
called for greater activism during meetings with a delegation from 
the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) in 
January.  While some government officials alluded to the 
possibility of expanded freedoms in the near future, most hewed to 
the party line on the need to carefully control such things as 
registrations of new churches and ordinations of pastors.  The 
delegation stressed Washington\'s interest in religious freedom in 
Vietnam and the potential for this issue to become a sticking 
point in an otherwise expanding bilateral relationship. 
 
2. (U) Dr. Scott Flipse, senior policy analyst at the U.S. 
Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), traveled 
through Hanoi, Hue, the Central Highlands and Ho Chi Minh City 
during January 7-16.  He was joined by Mr. George Phillips, from 
the office of Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), and Ms. Hannah Royal, from 
the office of Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS), who traveled in their 
personal capacities under the sponsorship of a U.S.-based NGO, the 
Committee for Religious Freedom in Vietnam, which was represented 
on the trip by Vietnamese-American Catholic priest Tam Tran.  This 
cable reports on their meetings in Hanoi and HCMC.  Reftels report 
on the CIRFDEL\'s meetings elsewhere in Vietnam.  Septel will 
report on meetings with the new Cardinal of HCMC. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Government Officials Toe the Party Line 
--------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) In official meetings in Hanoi, Madame Ton Nu Thi Ninh, 
Vice-Chairwoman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the National 
Assembly, stressed that the GVN was always open to dialogue on 
human rights/religious freedom.  In her opinion, the situation for 
religious believers in Vietnam was improving.  While some 
religious leaders are in prison, they were there for reasons other 
than their faith.  Madame Ninh also suggested that many observers 
of religious freedom in Vietnam viewed the country with 
preconceptions and narrowly defined concerns.  She claimed that 
much of the information being spread about religious freedom was 
incorrect and was manipulated by groups overseas to attack the 
GVN.  She specifically named the Committee for Religious Freedom 
in Vietnam, which had advertised its sponsorship for the 
Congressional staff members of the CIRFDEL on its website.  She 
promised that high-level officials were paying increasing 
attention to human rights concerns and attempting to implement 
positive changes.  Congressional resolutions chastising the 
Vietnamese on human rights would do nothing to improve the 
situation, however.  In a brief discussion of refugee issues, 
Madame Ninh thought that reopening in-country processing of 
refugees would raise expectations that could not be met.  If the 
USG insisted, she suggested the programs be renamed and 
repackaged.  While the GVN would not be happy to see refugee 
processing restarted, it would be pragmatic and likely not oppose 
it. 
 
4. (SBU) Ngo Yen Thi, Chairman of the national Committee on 
Religious Affairs and Hoang Cong Dung, Vice Chairman of the 
national Committee on Ethnic Minorities, advanced similar views on 
religious freedom in their separate meetings with the CIRFDEL. 
Both officials assured the delegation that the GVN has long held 
policies to uphold freedom of religion, and described the variety 
of religions in Vietnam and rapid growth of Protestantism in 
particular as proof of that fact.  Chairman Thi noted specifically 
that the CPV has identified religion as a need of the people, but 
acknowledged (as did Vice Chairman Dung) that local officials 
sometimes interpreted government policies incorrectly.  He also 
assured the CIRFDEL that the Committee on Religion was motivated 
by a sincere desire to ensure that religious leaders were 
sufficiently trained and of high moral character to lead their 
congregations.  He blamed problems in the Central Highlands on 
separatist elements operating in the Protestant community, noting 
that individuals had been incarcerated in some cases for political 
activities, but not for religious beliefs.  He said the government 
was interested in working with local officials to assist the 
legitimate Protestant churches in the Central Highlands to 
develop.  He thought the situation was more confusing in the 
Northwest Highlands, where organizational problems within the 
government recognized Evangelical Church of Vietnam (ECVN) 
prevented Protestant leaders from guiding new converts.  He 
claimed that arrests connected to serious problems with drug 
trafficking in the area had been incorrectly identified as 
religious oppression. 
5. (SBU) The same basic government positions were repeated in 
official meetings in Ho Chi Minh City.  Nguyen Thanh Tai, Vice 
Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee, focused on explaining the 
GVN\'s stance on the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam 
(UBCV).  While he started out by saying that the old UBCV had 
voluntarily integrated itself into the government recognized 
Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS) in 1981 and no longer existed as a 
separate entity, he later admitted the real problem was that the 
UBCV had taken actions to undermine the GVN.  Calling the UBCV 
leadership \"self-proclaimed representatives of no one,\" he 
criticized the problem as one of political action, not religion. 
He said the GVN was just helping Vietnam\'s Buddhists achieve their 
own goals of unification, yet could not explain why the government 
should be playing a role in that debate in the first place.  Vice 
Chairman Tai told the delegation they would not be able to meet 
with detained UBCV Deputy Thich Quang Do in HCMC during their 
visit, because he was under administrative surveillance for 
undertaking actions \"detrimental to the state.\"  Addressing 
Protestant issues, the Vice Chairman acknowledged communications 
problems between police and believers were responsible for the 
physical altercation at a local house church last year.  He said 
that the court case scheduled for the next morning against Pastor 
Bui Van Ba for attacking police during that incident had been 
postponed for the Tet Lunar New Year.  Responding to a proposal 
from the CIRFDEL, Vice Chairman Tai was open to the idea of 
working with experts from other countries, possibly within the 
ASEAN context, to promote human rights/religious freedom and train 
local authorities. 
 
6. (SBU) Vice Director Vo Ngoc Hue of the HCMC Committee for 
Religious Affairs expanded on some of those themes in a separate 
meeting.  Warning the delegation not to believe distortions about 
religious freedom in Vietnam, he dismissed the international 
uproar over several recent cases of alleged oppression.  He 
claimed that the detentions following attempts to hand out 
religious tracts packaged as official brochures during the 
December Southeast Asia Games were related to copyright 
infringement, not religion.   In the case of the altercation 
discussed by Vice Chairman Tai, he pointed out that Pastor Ba was 
not a legally ordained pastor and had been responsible for 
throwing the first punch.  (Note:  Pastor Ba had already confirmed 
the latter claim to ConGenoffs himself.  End Note.)  Mr. Hue asked 
the delegation to take a more comprehensive view of religious 
issues in Vietnam, and stop focusing on a few minor cases of 
individuals who distorted information for their own interests and 
worked to undermine the government.  Dr. Flipse pointed out that 
the way to avoid such problems was to avoid entering known house 
churches in that fashion during worship services, allow more 
pastors to be trained and ordained, and remove the restrictions 
forbidding congregations from building churches outside of their 
homes.  Regarding the UBCV, the Vice Director reaffirmed that the 
delegation would not be able to visit with Thich Quang Do while he 
was under investigation.  (He said the group had been allowed to 
visit imprisoned priest Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly during their time 
in Hanoi because Ly had already been convicted and sentenced.) 
Mr. Hue was unable to answer questions regarding what sort of 
state secrets the 76-year-old Buddhist monk might have been 
carrying.  Urged to allow the UBCV to register as a legal 
organization independently of the VBS, Vice Director Hue echoed 
Vice Chairman Tai\'s response that the Buddhists themselves were 
opposed to this plan.  He did seem amenable, however, to separate 
registrations for pre-1975 Protestant denominations outside the 
umbrella of the SECV. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
And Official Buddhist Representatives Don\'t Disagree 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
7. (SBU) Thich Thanh Tu, Vice President of the Executive Council 
of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha, rejected claims that religion was 
oppressed in Vietnam.  He asserted that unification of Vietnam\'s 
disparate Buddhist organizations after 1975 had actually brought 
harmony to Vietnam.  He too claimed that former leaders of the now 
banned UBCV had willingly merged with the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha 
in 1982, and that those now claiming to lead the UBCV were 
misrepresenting themselves, since the organization no longer 
existed.  Thich Hien Phap, Secretary General of the Executive 
Council of the VBS in HCMC, reminded the CIRFDEL of the history of 
the different Buddhist sects in Vietnam, with particular emphasis 
on their political activities during the war years.  He too was 
unable to answer the question of why the VBS would be opposed to 
the establishment of a separate UBCV organization, but said all 
monks should work together for social stability.  While he said he 
respected the UBCV monks as Buddhists, he criticized them for 
allowing themselves to be influenced by outsiders.  Asked for his 
views on the wisdom of drafting a new law on religion (the monk is 
also a National Assembly delegate), Thich Hien Phap cited the need 
to prevent the spread of superstitions. 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
Protestants Mixed on Hopes for Change, but Mostly Defiant 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
9. (SBU) Le Khac Dung and Dao Van Khue, of the Executive Council 
of the Evangelical Church of Vietnam (ECVN) in Hanoi, were more 
critical of the Government.  Noting the small size of the ECVN -- 
three pastors and 10 preachers -- they complained that the 
Government had blocked other preachers from being ordained, 
leaving the church unable to meet the needs of its 11 churches and 
six other places of worship.  Dung and Khue said that the 
Government had actually tried to force the ECVN to accept a 
Government nominee as a pastor at one time, but that the church 
had refused.  (Note: It appears that this happened several years 
ago.  End note.)  The two talked of the EVCN\'s plans to hold a 
national convention, but said that plans were on hold over a 
dispute with local authorities over the Haiphong congregation. 
The GVN had also warned them against accepting new members 
churches from the Northwest Highlands until they could be sure of 
the moral character of the applicants.  They noted that they had 
heard stories about persecution of Hmong Protestants in the 
Northwest Highlands, but had been unable to investigate these 
claims themselves.  Many of the problems, they believed, were due 
to authorities not understanding the Hmong \"Vang Chu\" religion, 
which they said is actually Protestantism. 
 
10. (SBU) According to officials of the government recognized 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) in HCMC, the 
situation seemed to have improved a little more with every new 
delegation from the U.S. and other interested countries.  Still, 
they regretted the fact there were so few churches for the 
organization\'s 1.2 million believers, and that only 400 of 1400 
pastors were registered.  They hoped to break ground on new 
quarters for the new Protestant seminary on a four-hectare site 
this June.  They acknowledged that the problems were worse up 
north.  The SECV leaders said  the treatment of Protestants in any 
given location depended greatly on local authorities, rather than 
any sort of national policy.  They worried that the new law on 
religion currently being drafted in Hanoi would have a cultural 
dimension that would favor Buddhism and indigenous religions over 
Christianity. 
 
11. (SBU) In meetings with prominent house church pastors in HCMC, 
the picture was mixed.  While some felt conditions were improving 
in certain parts of the country, others dismissed such claims as 
outright lies.  As has often been the case with visitors in the 
recent past, the pastors generally failed to highlight specific 
abuses within the prior six months to one year, preferring instead 
to rely on older material, such as a local government form dating 
back to 2002, which allegedly requires parents to certify that 
their children will say no to drugs and Protestantism as a 
precondition to enrolling in school.  One pastor mentioned a 
couple that was fined for reading the Bible together, but provided 
few details.  A pastor who is active in the Northwest Highlands 
said the GVN was becoming more and more concerned that the 
region\'s 1.2 million Hmong (460,000 of whom were Christian) would 
seek to establish an autonomous state.  A pastor currently 
affiliated with the SECV told the delegation he had come to meet 
them privately because he felt restrained from speaking the truth 
in the presence of his fellow legal church leaders.  He decried 
the lack of real church buildings and the difficulties faced by 
Christians in more remote areas of the country. 
 
12. (SBU) Meeting with a second group of Protestant leaders in a 
nearby house church because the pastors thought there were too 
many police around the original meeting site, the delegation again 
heard more general statements rather than specific allegations.  A 
well-known pastor once affiliated with the SECV but now operating 
independently claimed the situation was not better or worse, only 
different, as the GVN had adopted new strategies.  These pastors 
agreed that international pressure works, but thought the pressure 
should focus less on registration of individual churches and more 
on noninterference in their affairs.  One of these pastors 
summarized his views for Dr. Flipse the following day at his own 
house church, saying that he wanted direct dialogue with the GVN, 
greater transparency in government decisions on religion, and the 
return of church properties.  He thought the GVN needed to do a 
better job of listening to its own people and trying to understand 
their religious needs.  While he had heard that the GVN was 
considering allowing pre-1975 denominations like the Mennonites, 
Baptists, and Seventh Day Adventists to register, he believed the 
GVN would only allow what it thought it could control.  Under the 
circumstances, he would no longer seek registration for his group 
and hand over management of its affairs to the government, despite 
the fact that he had attempted to register in the past.  He also 
told the delegation that he had recruited 2000 members for his 
Christian Boy Scout troop, by looking for young people with the 
pioneering spirit of the communists but without the communist 
mindset.  Many of the members were living in camps rather than 
with their families and were given regular skills training.  The 
Boy Scouts also operated as something of a security force for 
Christian gatherings. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
Cao Dai and Hoa Hao Still Can\'t Agree Amongst Themselves 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
13. (SBU) Leading Hoa Hao and Cao Dai dissidents also seemed to 
have gone the route of looking at the big picture, as opposed to 
raising specific abuses.  Blaming the rift within their own 
organization on government opposition to reconciliation, the Hoa 
Hao asked the international community to continue to press for the 
right of religious groups to govern themselves.  They also noted 
that they have their own lines of communication with both their 
counterpart recognized religious bodies and also the GVN, which 
continued to approach them with offers of reconciliation.  Both 
were adamant that they would not join what they considered to be 
government-run organizations.  Neither seemed to place much value 
on working ecumenically to deal with common problems.  (In a 
reminder of the mystical nature of the Cao Dai faith, those 
representatives told the CIRFDEL that they had foreseen changes 
within the next five months in a seance.) 
 
---------------------------- 
Update on Dr. Nguyen Dan Que 
---------------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) In a brief detour from the primary focus of religious 
freedom, the CIRFDEL also met with the wife of imprisoned 
democracy activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que in HCMC.  (As with Thich 
Quang Do, Vice Chairman Tai had already denied a request to visit 
Dr. Que on the grounds that he was still under investigation.) 
She told the delegation she was continuing to make monthly visits 
to the municipal jail, but had still been unable to establish 
contact with her husband.  On her most recent visit, just three 
days earlier, she had followed her normal practice of bringing a 
small amount of high-blood pressure and ulcer medication, and the 
equivalent of USD$65 for food.  She has no way of being certain 
these items reached her husband, but believes they did.  Prison 
officials had told her that her husband was in a cell with one 
other prisoner.  She believes that person was likely placed there 
to keep an eye on her husband.  Prison officials also promised to 
inform her of any medical problems that arose.  Sounding slightly 
more radical than in the past, she said that most Vietnamese 
wanted change, although they were afraid to express their 
feelings.  She regretted the personal sacrifices she had made over 
the past nearly 30 years, but was proud of her husband for 
speaking out.  She thought the new spate of arrests of prominent 
activists last year represented a new tactic on the part of the 
GVN.  She thought her husband would likely be sentenced to 5-7 
years in prison this time, but didn\'t say why she thought so.  She 
also said the GVN wanted her to write some sort of letter 
requesting an amnesty for her husband, but she could never agree 
to any GVN quid pro quo. 
 
16.  (U)  The delegation did not have an opportunity to clear this 
cable before their departure.

SUBJECT: TRAFFICKING RETURNEES IN AN GIANG UPDATE 
 
REF:  03 Hanoi 001671 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  An Giang province\'s program to help 
trafficking returnees resettle has met with mixed success, 
according to provincial officials.  The NGO-supported project, 
working in conjunction with the provincial Women\'s Union and the 
Ho Chi Minh City-based Little Rose Shelter, has so far assisted 29 
girls aged 11 to 17 from the border province who had been or have 
a high risk of being trafficked to Cambodia.  Officials from the 
An Giang Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs 
(Dolisa) also claimed that trafficking has been significantly 
reduced in the province.  Poloff was unable to meet with 
trafficking returnees in the province, although Pol/Econ FSN 
assistant was able to talk with two victims at the Little Rose 
Shelter.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) The returnee project, done in conjunction with the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM), targeted An Giang 
\"girls\" (so far victims have ranged from 11 to 17 years old) who 
had been or have a high risk of being trafficked to neighboring 
Cambodia.  IOM may expand the project to include other border 
provinces, like Tay Ninh.  This project follows an IOM-sponsored 
program to train local officials to identify and locate 
trafficking returnees (reftel).  Victims receive four months of 
psychological counseling and vocational training (sewing) at the 
Little Rose Shelter, plus US$50 of start-up money upon their 
return to An Giang province.  The first group of fifteen victims 
returned to the province in 2003, while a second group of fourteen 
victims completed the returnee program on February 25, 2004.  Most 
of the victims were initially trafficked for labor and worked in 
\"cafes\" in Cambodia.  Both provincial and shelter officials 
admitted, however, that many actually worked in the sex industry. 
A third group of fourteen victims from the province arrived at the 
shelter in Ho Chi Minh City on February 24. 
 
3.  (SBU) Provincial officials initially claimed that the program 
had been a success for \"most\" women, including five who had 
married since their return.  When asked how many were not 
successful, officials stated that only 50 percent had \"stabilized\" 
and found jobs, but none had returned to the sex industry. 
Shelter officials, however, reported that two girls from the 
initial group had gone back to sex work.  One girl from the second 
group also dropped out of the program before completing the 
counseling and training.  The Women\'s Union representative stated 
that victims did not face much discrimination upon returning to 
their villages.  Neighbors looked on them with \"sympathy\" and saw 
them as \"victims.\"  According to the Women\'s Union rep, 
discriminating against victims is not part of Vietnamese culture. 
 
4.  (SBU) Other provincial programs, funded by the GVN, IOM, and 
the German NGO Teres Dez Home, include micro-credit lending for 
victims or families of victims, vocational training and 
scholarships for the poor and other high-risk groups, community- 
based education, clubs to \"advocate for the prevention of 
prostitution, drugs, and HIV/AIDS,\" and seminars to discuss 
trafficking issues. Many of these programs have been operational 
for one to three years. 
 
5.  (SBU) Dolisa officials repeatedly stated trafficking was a 
\"police matter.\"  In 2003 only five \"complaints\" had been brought 
to the police, down from \"tens of complaints\" the year before. 
They cited this as evidence that community awareness programs were 
working.  All \"complaints\" lodged in 2003 were dropped for lack of 
evidence.  Little Rose Shelter officials reported, however, that 
after the first group of victims returned, the province claimed it 
had no more cases.  When two HCMC-based social workers visited 
communes recommended by participants in the first group, the 
social workers discovered many more cases that local/commune 
officials had been unwilling to report.  Shelter officials 
attributed this to a concern that, if small hamlets admitted to a 
trafficking problem, they would lose their status as \"cultural 
villages.\"  (Post Note: This is an honorific that means, inter 
alia, the community has no \"social evils.\")  Shelter officials did 
not know if this tendency to hide cases was supported at the 
hamlet or commune level.  An Giang Dolisa officials gave vague 
statements about the number of returnees in the province overall, 
ultimately admitting they were not aware of, or could not control, 
most cases.  They only knew of victims who had returned through 
\"diplomatic\" channels.  Officials also reported that HIV/AIDS was 
\"not a wide problem\" with returnees, citing only \"one or two\" 
cases, none recent.  (Post Note: HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment 
does not fall under Dolisa\'s purview in this province.) 
 
6.  (SBU) Poloff\'s requests to meet with returnees in the province 
were denied.  Women\'s Union officials said they might be able to 
arrange something in the future, but needed advance notice to 
prepare and brief the returnees for meeting with a foreigner and 
to arrange a discreet meeting place.  According to the Women\'s 
Union, the presence of a foreigner in their villages would cause 
hardship and discrimination for the returnees.  Officials from An 
Giang province, IOM, and the Little Rose Shelter all stated this 
was \"a very sensitive\" issue to be sharing with foreigners.  (Post 
Note: It was unclear how much of this concern reflected a genuine 
effort to protect the victims from embarrassment/shunning, and how 
much reflected an effort to avoid unwanted negative attention for 
the villages and province as a whole.) 
 
7.  (SBU) Pol/Econ FSN assistant was able to interview two victims 
from neighboring hamlets in the second group at the Little Rose 
Shelter in Ho Chi Minh City.  They both said they were very happy 
to be in the program.  Nguyen Thi Anh Trang (protect), age 15, was 
recruited by a friend to go work as a babysitter and laundress in 
Cambodia to help pay off her family\'s debts.  She ultimately 
worked in a cafe owned by a friend of her first \"lord.\"  Her 
friend was sold to another individua nd kled afew months 
later.  After nine months of mistreatment, Trang learned of her 
friend\'s death and decided to escape.  She walked across the 
border during the night and made her way to her aunt\'s house.  Her 
aunt referred her to the Women\'s Union.  Tran Thi Ngoc Nho 
(protect), also age 15 and from a poor family, was \"lured\" by 
another girl, 4-5 years older than she, to work in Cambodia as a 
babysitter and dishwasher.  The recruiter then left her and she 
wound up working in a cafe.  Because she was treated badly, she 
decided to return home.  Nho\'s mother then went to Cambodia to try 
to claim Nho\'s salary from the cafe owner, but he refused to pay. 
When the Pol/Econ FSN later returned to the shelter, she witnessed 
the arrival of the third group, who were brought there by a 
representative of the An Giang Women\'s Union, Miss Hiem.  The 
second group immediately ran over to Miss Hiem, surrounded her and 
cheered.  The Pol/Econ FSN noted the atmosphere overall was very 
warm and welcoming. 
 
8.  (SBU) COMMENT: Without additional information, ConGen cannot 
come to any general conclusion about the overall long-term success 
of the programs or the treatment of returnees in their villages. 
It was hard to pin down precise details about victims or programs, 
even though the first-hand anecdotal evidence seemed genuine. 
Some Vietnamese officials seemed in denial about the magnitude of 
the issue.  Whether this was because officials were unwilling to 
share information about this \"very sensitive issue\" with a foreign 
diplomat or because they do not have reliable statistics could not 
be determined.  The existence of a variety of programs focused on 
trafficking victims and public awareness suggests that An Giang 
province is taking some concrete steps to address trafficking, but 
the jury is still out on their effectiveness.

Summary 
------- 
1.  A recent labor dispute over the termination of Coca-Cola\'s 
direct-hire guardforce deteriorated into a two-day stand-off when 
more than half of the guards refused to relinquish their posts. 
Coca-Cola, which had previously cleared the terms of the lay-off 
and related severance package with the local government, called 
upon city officials for assistance.  The officials visited the 
guards and urged them to accept the original offer, and the guards 
eventually left.  The event generated significant local press 
coverage.  Local authorities provided public support to an 
American firm that followed the Vietnamese labor law. 
 
Guard Force on Guard 
-------------------- 
2.  On February 8, security guards at the Coca-Cola Company 
bottling plant in Ho Chi Minh City\'s Thu Duc District began a 
labor action that was something of a cross between a sit-in and a 
lock-out.  Coca-Cola had recently decided to outsource the 
security function at the plant by hiring a private security 
company to replace the plant\'s 24 direct-hire security guards. 
When new guards from the Tri Dung Security Company arrived to take 
up their posts, 15 old guards, all direct-hire Coca-Cola 
employees, refused to relinquish their jobs.  The laid-off guards 
did not use violence or interfere with the plant\'s operations; 
they simply refused to leave. 
 
3.  Publicly, the laid-off guards claimed that the signature of 
Coca-Cola Vietnam\'s General Director had been forged on the 
paperwork executing the personnel change.  They also described the 
procedures for terminating their employment as unsatisfactory and 
said they did not want to be blamed for any losses or problems 
that might arise during the transition from direct-hire guards to 
the private security company.  Their real demands, however, 
codified into a demand for larger severance packages.  Coca-Cola 
offered each guard the legally-mandated one month of severance pay 
per year of service, plus two months pay to cover time spent 
searching and training for a new job.  On top of the legally 
mandated payments, Coca-Cola sweetened the package with a bonus 
averaging 9 months\' salary.  The laid-off guards countered with a 
request for 36 months\' salary. 
 
4.  Coca-Cola was unwilling to change their offer and called upon 
local authorities to assist.  Ho Chi Minh City Department of 
Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DOLISA) officials and 
representatives from the Labor Confederation visited the bottling 
plant.  Prior to terminating the guards\' employment, Coca-Cola 
submitted its proposed severance plan to DOLISA and the Labor 
Confederation for approval and both approved of the terms.  Having 
signed off already, local officials urged the guards to accept the 
original terms.  According to a Coca-Cola representative, 
officials told the guards that this was a generous offer that went 
far beyond the legal requirement and one they should accept. 
Local police were also notified of the situation but did not use 
force to end the standoff. 
 
Changing of the Guard 
--------------------- 
5.  It took some time, but the measured reaction by Coca-Cola and 
local authorities paid off late in the evening on February 10, 
when the recalcitrant guards left their posts and allowed their 
replacements to take over after a delegation of DOLISA, Labor 
Confederation, and People\'s Committee officials visited the 
factory and called for the guards to leave.  The standoff lasted 
more than two days but effected no change in the original terms. 
Coca-Cola set a one-week window (February 13-20) for the guards to 
come pick up their severance packages at the factory.  At present, 
10 of the 24 guards have arrived to claim their payments.  Coca- 
Cola has requested that the People\'s Committee appoint some 
government body to accept the money from Coca-Cola and disburse 
payment for claims made after February 20. 
 
Coca-Cola\'s Guarded Reaction 
---------------------------- 
6.  A Coca-Cola rep told Econoff that the decision to terminate 
the guards and hire a private security firm was simply a move to 
outsource a function that could be done more cheaply and 
effectively by an independent specialist.  It also helps limit 
Coca-Cola\'s liability for any guard-related incidents.  He also 
mentioned that the guards employed by Coca-Cola were offered the 
opportunity to work for Tri Dung Security Company, albeit at lower 
salaries. 
 
7.  Coca-Cola praised the local authorities for helping solve the 
problem peacefully.  The Coke rep said the lesson he was taking 
away from the incident was, \"Let the government do what it is 
there for, to handle problems like these.  When there is a 
problem, we should step back and call in the government.\"  A vice 
president of the HCMC Labor Confederation echoed Coca-Cola in 
laying blame for the conflict on the guards.  He told Econ FSN 
assistant that the company had more than fulfilled its 
responsibilities and he had absolutely no complaints about the way 
Coca-Cola handled the lay-off. 
 
8.  When asked why the police did not just go in at the start and 
remove the guards, the Coca-Cola rep said that was not something 
his company wanted as it carried the potential for bad publicity, 
especially if someone were injured.  The termination did generate 
a fair amount of press attention. 
 
9.  Coca-Cola\'s operations in Vietnam, begun shortly after the end 
of the U.S. embargo, include three bottling plants (Hanoi, Danang, 
HCMC) and employ more than 2000 employees.  According to company 
estimates, they have captured 65 percent of the market share after 
an investment in excess of USD150 million.  Coca-Cola believes its 
success is due to consumer sentiment and loyalty, and would 
therefore try to avoid anything that might upset consumers. 
 
Labor Actions Are Commonplace 
----------------------------- 
10.  Labor actions are commonplace in HCMC.  Newspapers carry 
fairly regular accounts of walk-outs and short-term strikes in 
local factories.  ConGen contacts in the Labor Federation were 
reluctant to give statistics without approval from higher-ups, but 
a local newspaper reporter working the labor beat said there were 
60 full-blown strikes in HCMC during 2003, an increase of 
approximately 10 percent over 2002.  Most incidents, which might 
only last for a day or so, do not make it into the statistics. 
Labor disputes are mostly sparked by wages (overtime), benefits, 
or work conditions complaints.  According to a local labor NGO 
contact, some sort of dialogue followed by minor concessions on 
either side almost always solves these conflicts.  In his 
experience, however, no one has ever demanded 36 months\' severance 
pay. 
 
Comment 
------- 
11.  This is a good news story for the American business community 
here.  When this high-profile U.S. firm played by the rules and 
offered a severance package well in excess of the legal 
requirements, local authorities played a helpful role, diffusing 
the situation and essentially backing the company.  At the same 
time, the effort to reach agreement rather than use force reflects 
the preferred method for dealing with the majority of labor 
disputes.

SUBJECT: MORE FRIEND THAN FOE?  THE CHAM MUSLIMS OF AN GIANG 
PROVINCE 
 
REF:  03 HANOI 01554 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  An Giang Province\'s small ethnic minority Cham 
Muslims expressed delight at U.S. interest in them and a 
willingness to meet again.  Poloff informally visited three Cham 
Muslim mosques on February 20, 2004, meeting with lay followers 
and one Imam.  The Cham shared current information on their 
practices, funding and religious activities while eagerly showing 
off their facilities.  Malaysia provides some funding to the 
community, while Saudi Arabia has funded the hajj for several 
followers.  Muslim representatives in HCMC indicated that Muslim 
groups nationwide currently have 72 students studying abroad -- 
including six in Saudi Arabia, 16 in Indonesia, 42 in Malaysia, 
six in Libya, and two in Egypt.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2.  (SBU) Poloff visited the Jamiul Azhar mosque in Phu Tan 
district and the Moubarak and Nia Mah mosques in Tan Chau 
district, all directly across the Hau Giang River from the town of 
Chau Doc, An Giang.  According to believers, each mosque attracts 
40-50 believers for each of the five daily calls to prayer.  About 
200 people attend the two additional Friday services at each 
mosque.  Followers also attend classes, including Arabic courses, 
every day except Friday. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Initially, the three mosques were empty except for the 
caretakers, who reside on the properties, but groups of up to 15 
people quickly formed at each location.  The Imam of Nia Mah was 
waiting to receive Poloff personally, since the other mosques had 
called ahead to tell him \"a delegation\" was coming.  None of the 
people at the mosques identified themselves by name.  Followers at 
each mosque proudly showed off their facilities, including the 
main worship area.  The Imam invited Poloff to his house later in 
the day, after prayers ended, to meet his family and discuss Islam 
further (because of time constraints the invitation was politely 
declined).  Still, the Imam said he hoped Poloff would return in 
the future. 
 
4.  (SBU) The caretakers of both the Jamiul Azhar and Moubarak 
mosques reported that funding for their mosques came from three 
primary sources: ethnic Cham in other provinces, overseas Cham in 
America, and unidentified entities in Malaysia.  The provincial 
Committee for Religious and Ethnic Minority Affairs also 
identified Malaysia as a primary source of funding for the Muslim 
community.  The mosques have sent students to train in Saudi 
Arabia, Libya, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.  The two mosques 
combined currently have six students in Malaysia, three in 
Indonesia, and one in Libya.  According to Mr. Idress of the 
Muslim Representative Board in HCMC, Vietnamese Muslim groups 
nationwide have sent a total of six students to Saudi Arabia, 20 
to Indonesia, 48 to Malaysia, six to Libya, and two to Egypt since 
1995.  Four of the students in Indonesia and six students in 
Malaysia have returned to Vietnam already, while the others 
continue their studies overseas. 
 
5.  (SBU) Some members of all three mosques had gone on the hajj 
within the last three years.  The Imam had performed the hajj in 
2000 and his wife had just returned from the hajj this year. 
According to the Committee on Religious and Ethnic Minority 
Affairs, nine Muslims in An Giang province went on the hajj in 
2004.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia funded the hajj for these 
individuals.  Two other individuals had been denied Saudi Arabian 
visas. 
 
6.  (SBU) The three mosques appeared to have good relations with 
the local government and the followers did not report any 
problems.  The Moubarak mosque has been registered as a Vietnamese 
historic landmark.  The head of the district government joined the 
group at Nia Mah and even participated in some theological 
discussion.  Security personnel (some plainclothes, some 
uniformed) quickly arrived at each mosque, however, and could be 
seen questioning individuals after Poloff departed. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT: The Cham Muslims seemed genuinely pleased to 
have an American visitor and were even more excited to discuss 
basic Islamic theology with an American.  This attitude is similar 
to that of the leadership of another Cham mosque in the province 
(reftel).  The Imam and one of his elders also touted the 
commonalities between Christianity and Islam, as believers of both 
religions were \"people of the book.\"  Lay followers did become 
nervous, however, after local security arrived.  Questions remain 
about the extent of foreign influence on the Cham Muslims, 
including the sources of their overseas funding and the number of 
students they are sending abroad.

SUBJECT: AMERICAN BUSINESS REPS IN HO CHI MINH CITY LOVE BTA, HATE 
U.S. ANTIDUMPING AND QUOTAS 
 
 
Summary and Introduction 
------------------------ 
1.  (SBU) During his visit to Ho Chi Minh City on February 17-18, 
Staff Director for the Senate Appropriations Committee James 
Morhard met a group of American businesspeople resident in Ho Chi 
Minh City.  They reviewed their challenges and successes here in 
Vietnam and raised concerns about the future of the U.S.-Vietnam 
trade relationship.  They argued that anti-dumping cases for 
frozen fish fillets and now shrimp, as well as textile quotas, 
were limiting Vietnam\'s growth.  This growth, they said, is 
crucial to the success of their businesses here.  They also 
expressed concern about potential Vietnamese disenchantment with 
the U.S., if ordinary Vietnamese citizens continue to feel the 
level playing field disappears as soon as they are successful in 
penetrating the U.S. market. 
 
American Businessmen \"Quite Concerned\" 
-------------------------------------- 
2.  (SBU) An American banker who for the last 5 years has run the 
operations of a large non-American bank in Vietnam stated he was 
\"quite concerned\" about the U.S. -Vietnam relationship.  He 
characterized the decision of Vietnam\'s leadership to participate 
in the world economy as \"fragile.\"  This fragility is aggravated 
by U.S. actions that limit Vietnam\'s economic growth, he said. 
The U.S. is Vietnam\'s biggest customer, and one of its largest 
trading partners, but GVN leadership has \"egg on its face\" as it 
has to deal with textile quotas and antidumping cases on frozen 
fish fillets and now shrimp.  This banker stated that many in the 
leadership were \"trying to do the right thing\" in opening up the 
country and the economy, but that it would not happen without help 
from the U.S.  He also stressed that trade and investment would 
aid Vietnam in its reform process and cultivate a possible, 
valuable U.S. ally for the future. 
 
3.  (SBU) Another American businessman, who has been in Vietnam 
for more than 10 years and has held several leadership roles in 
the expatriate business community here, took the argument further. 
He claimed the U.S. had led Vietnam \"down the garden path.\"  After 
promoting the benefits of opening up the economy and trading with 
the United States, he was disappointed that Vietnam had been 
\"ambushed\" by U.S. efforts to limit trade in the areas with the 
greatest potential growth in the U.S. market - seafood and 
textiles.  He felt that these disputes helped sour the atmosphere 
when U.S. firms such as his own applied for licenses in Vietnam. 
He and others were also concerned that ordinary Vietnamese would 
become disenchanted with the U.S. if they continue to feel their 
successes in the U.S. marketplace will be countered with unfair 
treatment and an end to the level playing field they were told 
they could expect. 
 
Now the Good News 
----------------- 
4.  (U) Along with the dark clouds, the businessmen spoke of the 
opportunities and progress that they had seen.  One businessman 
described the local economy in glowing terms, stating that 
ordinary Vietnamese were optimistic and happy because they saw the 
dramatic and sustained economic growth over the last few years as 
translating into a bright future for their children.  He added 
that the last six months had seen substantially greater economic 
activity -- primarily in HCMC -- than any period during his entire 
tenure here.  Others agreed.  When asked by Mr. Morhard, the 
businessmen were very complimentary about the support they had 
received from the Ambassador and the Consulate General as a whole. 
 
5.  (U) Much of this growth in the last couple of years was 
attributed to direct trade benefits from the Bilateral Trade 
Agreement (BTA), as well as to the indirect benefits of the 
improving trade and investment climate that the BTA commitments 
foster.  One speaker noted that American firms in Ho Chi Minh City 
were engaged in \"real business,\" unlike some of the businesses in 
neighboring countries, which he characterized as \"getting between 
foreign aid dollars and their local recipients.\" 
 
Nike Likes Vietnam 
------------------ 
6.  (SBU) The two Nike representatives spoke very positively of 
their experience with Vietnam.  Nike has, via its contract 
factories, a major presence here.  The company indirectly employs 
about 75,000 workers in 7 contract footwear factories that produce 
exclusively for Nike.  The company estimates that it is also 
responsible for an additional 20,000 employees -- if outside 
suppliers to the footwear factories are also included.  Nike 
considers Vietnam a \"learning country,\" which means it is devoting 
considerable resources to develop further sourcing here. 
According to Nike, Vietnam has made extraordinary progress 
quickly, and can now manufacture high-end shoes that still cannot 
be produced in other countries in the region where Nike has had a 
longer-term presence.  The company is moving toward lean 
manufacturing and is working to add skills to its workforce, which 
is 80 percent female and sees a turnover of 25-30 percent per 
year. 
 
7.  (SBU) Last year the company also sourced 1.5 million pieces of 
apparel in Vietnam, with 50 percent going to the U.S.  The Nike 
reps noted that U.S. textile quotas were playing havoc on its 
apparel sourcing in Vietnam.  Although Nike plans to continue to 
develop footwear production here, apparel production is in more 
flux depending on whether or not Nike contract factories can get 
the quota they need to guarantee the order.  Next year it will be 
much easier to source from other countries where quota will not be 
an issue.  Nike reps called the possibility of U.S. quota 
reductions, even if small, \"a major disruption\" to the apparel 
business in Vietnam. 
 
So How Do You Define Corruption? 
-------------------------------- 
8.  (SBU) All executives acknowledged that corruption was a 
problem in Vietnam, although some claimed it was not as bad as in 
other countries in the region.  The group noted corruption in 
Vietnam tends to take the form of many small demands rather than a 
need to pay a few very large \"gifts.\" Corruption manifests itself 
in different ways in different sectors of the economy.  Unocal 
noted, for example, that PetroVietnam was not only their 
regulator, but also their partner and service provider.  This 
created tremendous conflicts of interest that the company had to 
deal with.  On the other hand, the banker stated that his 
regulator, the State Bank of Vietnam, was not corrupt.  All five 
businessmen confirmed it is common practice here for money to 
change hands, but noted that they did not do it.  Ultimately, this 
means everything takes longer to accomplish with the GVN. 
However, they agreed it is better not to pay, since \"once you give 
in, it\'s over\" and you would be hounded repeatedly for money.  One 
businessman called it \"death by a thousand paper cuts.\"  At the 
same time, he stated that he had containers stuck in port that 
would be cleared quickly if only he was willing to pay a bribe. 
 
9.  (SBU) Several of the businessmen asserted that corruption was 
not as serious in Vietnam as it was in Indonesia where a few of 
them had also worked.  Compared to Indonesia, said one 
businessman, corruption in Vietnam was \"fragmented and petty\" and 
not as well organized.  One person stated that we should not 
confuse corruption with bureaucratic sloth and inefficiency, 
although the situation is improving. 
 
Unocal\'s Success Depends on Vietnam\'s Economic Growth 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
10.  (SBU) The director of Unocal\'s operation in Vietnam described 
their production-sharing contract for exploiting offshore gas in 
Vietnam waters in the Gulf of Thailand as a longterm investment 
still in its early stages.  He described Unocal\'s dealings as more 
difficult here than with Thailand where they operate under a 
concession arrangement.  The gas from the Unocal project will be 
sold to the Vietnamese domestic market.  For the project to be 
economically viable in the long term, Unocal is counting on strong 
economic growth to drive domestic demand for power.  Lately, he 
said, domestic power consumption has been increasing at 17 percent 
per year.  This exceeds estimates in Unocal\'s business plan, which 
assumes 10-12 percent growth in energy demand per year over the 
next several years.  The Unocal director stated that this demand 
would of course be driven by economic growth, and said the BTA had 
thus indirectly benefited the project.  It was important for this 
growth to continue. 
 
11.  (SBU) The Unocal executive compared the business environment 
in Vietnam to that of China, where the firm has a small project in 
Shanghai.  In China, strong economic growth is also driving energy 
demand.  He felt that working in China, however, was \"almost 
impossible for a Western company\" although the country had opened 
-- and eased -- up over the past few years.  In Vietnam, like in 
China, there is a big issue of trust.  He stated that this ties 
into the negotiating mentality of his Vietnamese counterparts who 
still have a \"win-lose mentality\" as opposed to a \"win-win 
mentality.\"  There is currently zero level of trust, he said. 
 
Educating HCMC Officials 
------------------------ 
12.  (SBU) Morhard and ConGen officers also carried on a free- 
wheeling discussion over lunch with three mid-level political and 
press/cultural officers from the External Relations Office (ERO - 
branch office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for southern 
Vietnam).  Morhard challenged his interlocutors to reconcile 
Vietnam\'s continued reliance on a communist-style political system 
with a growing dependence on capitalism.  Much of the remainder of 
the candid conversation focused on the U.S. electoral system and 
the role of special interest groups in the political process.  The 
exchange gave the ERO participants an excellent opportunity to 
learn about the upcoming presidential election and the workings of 
democracy at the grassroots level. 
 
Comment 
------- 
13.  (SBU) While open and direct with their concerns over host 
country problems of corruption, inefficiency, and difficult local 
partners, the American businesspeople who met with Mr. Morhard 
saved most of their worries for USG policy.  They made clear the 
link between Vietnam\'s continued opening up to the world, its 
continued economic growth, and the success of their own businesses 
in Vietnam.  Although critical of U.S. trade actions over the past 
few months, which these businessmen see as directly threatening 
Vietnam\'s economic growth and the development of the bilateral 
relationship, they see the BTA as vital to the dramatic economic 
growth and Vietnam\'s opening up to the world -- which is key to 
their own success.  In spite of their worries, they are optimistic 
about the future here. 
 
13.  (U) Mr. Morhard did not have the opportunity to clear this 
cable before his departure.

HCMC 1222 
 
1. (SBU) On March 4, ConGen received information from U.S.-based 
sources that Vietnamese public security officers had surrounded 
the home of Mennonite Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang in District 2 of 
HCMC, at 16:15 local time on March 2.  The security officials were 
alleged to have ordered everyone who was inside the house, 
including visiting Kon Tum Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh, to report to 
the local police station.  The situation was said to be \"quite 
tense,\" as the believers refused to obey the police and remained 
inside the home.  According to the reports, the raid included 
elements from the Binh Khanh Ward police and a unit \"reportedly 
involved in liquidating opponents.\"  By March 5, the ConGen and 
Embassy had heard variations on this report from third-country 
diplomats and a U.S. Congressional staffer.  Information on this 
case was also presented by a USG official during a press 
conference covering other issues related to religious freedom in 
Vietnam. 
 
2. (SBU)  Immediately after receiving the initial report, Post was 
able to easily contact Pastor Quang at his home.  The story he 
told in the course of a 30-minute telephone conversation was very 
different.  He said the confrontation began after Pastor Chinh had 
already left HCMC for Kon Tum (where he returned without 
incident).  One of Quang\'s followers noticed two familiar-looking 
men, whom he thought were watching them, hanging out near the 
house.  When Quang and his follower went out to photograph the men 
and their license plates, the men tried to prevent them from 
taking pictures.  A scuffle ensued (Post could not get Quang to 
say who started it), but Quang managed to keep the camera.  The 
men then tried to flee on their motorbikes, but skidded and 
flipped off the vehicles.  At this point, some of Quang\'s 
followers tried to prevent them from leaving.  They eventually got 
away, but Quang kept one of the motorbikes.  Some time later that 
day, uniformed police returned to Quang\'s house to get the bike 
back.  They also wanted Quang to sign some sort of statement about 
disturbing the peace.  Quang refused both requests, another 
physical altercation ensued (Quang would not say who started it -- 
Post could not pin him down as to who started it), and one of 
Quang\'s followers was detained.  Two others were detained after 
they followed their colleague to the police station, but Quang had 
no further contact with the police. 
 
3. (SBU) Comment:  This case demonstrates a growing problem Post 
faces in dealing with a more provocative stance by religious 
freedom activists in Vietnam.  Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang and his 
associates are involved in one way or another with nearly every 
celebrated case of alleged religious persecution in HCMC over the 
past year (reftels).  Unfortunately, his track record is one of 
engaging in deliberately provocative acts for the purpose of 
generating international attention.  Even his own colleagues in 
the underground Protestant house church community acknowledge that 
he embellishes his claims to make his point.  But they know what 
he knows: In the Internet Age, this sort of information is quickly 
snatched up by a variety of NGOs and Vietnamese expatriate groups 
and used to demonstrate that the human rights situation in Vietnam 
is deteriorating.  If the facts turn out to be different, no one 
will ever go back and publish a correction.  Meanwhile, we are 
concerned that scarce resources are being diverted from genuine 
cases of human rights and religious freedom abuses.

1. (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The leadership of the government-recognized 
Hoa Hao Administrative Council (HHAC) provided a predictably 
positive report on the condition of the indigenous Hoa Hao faith 
in Vietnam, during PolOff\'s recent visit to An Giang Province. 
The HHAC, recognized by the GVN in 1999, was well into 
preparations for its second General Congress and the election of 
new leaders later this year, despite assertions by \"dissident\" Hoa 
Hao leaders unaffiliated with the HHAC that the HHAC was a GVN 
puppet and the elections would be rigged.  PolOff was able to 
raise the case of imprisoned Hoa Hao follower Nguyen Van Lia with 
local officials, but was thwarted in his attempt to visit another 
outspoken Hoa Hao activist.  Separate from the Hoa Hao, two other 
religious groups in An Giang province have started application 
process for official GVN recognition.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) PolOff traveled to An Giang Province from February 18-20, 
holding official meetings with: Mr. Nguyen Tan Dat, Vice Chairman 
of the Hoa Hao Administrative Council (HHAC) and two other HHAC 
representatives; Mr. Huynh Nhu Chau and Mr. Ngo Tien, the two Vice 
Chairmen of the An Giang Committee for Religious and Ethnic 
Minority Affairs; and Mr. Lu Hy, Vice Chairman of the An Giang 
Fatherland Front.  PolOff visited Hoa Hao dissident Mr. Bui Van 
Do, a nephew of the Hoa Hao founder, and attempted to meet with 
Mr. Nam Liem, the tree-climbing Hoa Hao monk (ref A).  PolOff also 
visited three Cham Muslim mosques close to the Cambodian border 
(ref B). 
 
3. (SBU) The government recognized HHAC reported no problems 
dealing with the Government of Vietnam, and denied reports from 
activist groups that the GVN had somehow discouraged followers 
from attending the religion\'s two annual festivals in An Giang. 
Activist Bui Van Do acknowledged that while he was unhappy with 
the HHAC, he had suffered no major harassment in recent years. 
HHAC representatives said they were proceeding with plans to hold 
a General Congress in the second quarter of 2004, the second such 
meeting since their 1999 official recognition by the GVN.  One of 
the primary purposes of the Congress would be to elect the Hoa Hao 
leadership for the next five years.  HHAC Vice Chairman Dat would 
not answer specific questions on who was eligible to stand for 
election, but said the HHAC had not yet conducted a survey of its 
eleven members to see who would stay and who would resign.  While 
activist Bui Van Do and leaders of some \"dissident\" Hoa Hao groups 
in HCMC and the U.S. claimed that all candidates were pre-selected 
by the GVN and free elections were therefore impossible, the 
Committee for Ethnic Minority and Religious Affairs denied any 
role in selecting candidates.  (Note:  Disaffected Hoa Hao groups 
contend that nine of the 11 members of the HHAC are also CPV 
members.  End Note.) 
 
4. (SBU) In each of his official meetings, PolOff raised the case 
of Mr. Nguyen Van Lia, a 63-year-old Hoa Hao Buddhist who had been 
sentenced to three years in prison for holding a ceremony in June 
2003 to commemorate the disappearance of the Hoa Hao founder. 
HHAC Vice Chairman Dat said that Lia had held an \"extreme\" 
celebration, hanging banners \"encouraging separation,\" and causing 
a \"social disturbance.\"  (Note: According to Hoa Hao dissident 
groups, Lia had raised the pre-1975 Hoa Hao flag.)  Religious 
Affairs Vice Chairman Chau defined a social disturbance as, \"when 
you gather a group in public.\"  He was certain that the banners 
had contained anti-government slogans, but could not remember the 
exact wording.  He said no pictures had been taken of the 
controversial event, and nothing had been documented.  Late in the 
conversation, he suddenly remembered that Lia had also \"assaulted\" 
security forces, but could not provide details.  He also noted 
that Lia\'s children had signed \"confessions\" at the time. 
 
5. (SBU) The two Vice Chairmen for Ethnic Minority and Religious 
Affairs told PolOff that two additional religious groups in the 
province, \"Tu An Hieu Nghia\" and \"Buu Son Ky Huong,\" had started 
the process to request GVN recognition.   Tu An Hieu Nghia 
(literally \"Four Debts of Gratitude\") lists roughly 41,000 
followers, 226 leaders, and eight places of worship, according to 
a recent provincial survey.  As of late January 2004, their 
application had cleared the provincial-level process and been 
forwarded to Hanoi for central government consideration.  Buu Son 
Ky Huong (literally \"Strange Fragrance from Precious Mountain\"), 
the Buddhist offshoot that was a direct precursor of Hoa Hao, has 
21,000 followers and 28 pagodas, by the official count.  Their 
application is still under consideration at the provincial level. 
 
6. (SBU) En route back to HCMC, PolOff attempted to visit the 
village of activist Hoa Hao monk Nam Liem.  Nam Liem has had 
several run ins with local officials over the past few years 
involving displays of \"illegal\" Hoa Hao regalia and \"illegal 
construction\".  Each time he has shimmied up a nearby coconut tree 
and stayed there for days, threatening to immolate himself before 
eventually being talked down.  ConGenoffs have been unsuccessful 
in their efforts to visit him for the last three years.  On this 
attempt, security officials on motorbikes raced ahead in the 
direction of Nam Liem\'s home after questioning individuals who had 
provided directions to the ConGen driver.  A few minutes later, 
PolOffO found the main road blocked by a truck parked diagonally 
across it.  Further down the road, an \"accident\" blocked all 
automobile traffic from proceeding any further.  A small truck 
with a motorbike on the ground in front of it blocked one lane, 
while a farm vehicle perpendicular to the truck blocked the other 
lane.  A gap between the vehicles was exactly large enough for 
motorbike traffic to pass unimpeded.  The vehicles had no visible 
signs of damage.  While police told PolOff JO that one driver had 
been taken to the hospital, and the other two drivers had run 
away, the scene had all the hallmarks of a staged accident.  After 
spending an additional ten minutes trying to measure the space 
between the \"crashed\" vehicles to see if the ConGen car could 
maneuver through without disturbing the \"scene of the crime\", 
PolOff gave up and left. 
 
7.  (SBU) COMMENT: As has been our experience on many provincial 
trips, PolOff was \"required\" to meet an official escort before 
traveling to the Hoa Hao Holy Land and was under obvious 
surveillance by a plainclothes officer on a motorbike after 
leaving the HHAC meeting.  Staff members from the provincial 
People\'s Committee and External Relations Office also insisted on 
attending the meeting with the HHAC.  The HHAC used part of its 
meeting to criticize the USG policy on catfish (a major industry 
in An Giang Province) and attack the International Religious 
Freedom Report -- in terms identical to those used by GVN 
officials.  Vice Chairman Dat, however, admitted that he had not 
actually read the report.  (Note: PolOff provided Dat with an 
English-language version of the 2003 report at the end of the 
meeting.)

1. (SBU) In a small dinner on March 1 at his 100-year-old 
residence, Cardinal Pham Minh Man, Archbishop of HCMC, told the 
Consul General that he had just received a letter from Ho Chi Minh 
City authorities seeking assistance in dealing with the growing 
HIV/AIDS problem.  The letter, signed by the Director of the HCMC 
Department of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (DOLISA), asked 
the Cardinal to provide 150 nuns to staff four HIV/AIDS treatment 
centers.  The Cardinal was clearly pleased at this sudden 
softening of the government\'s stance on social welfare activities, 
but planned to approach the DOLISA proposal with caution, 
particularly concerning the matter of training.  In meetings with 
several staffdels and other U.S. visitors over the past few 
months, the Cardinal had lamented government limitations on 
charitable works, matters he felt the Church should be able to 
manage on its own.  He had said it was sometimes easier for 
Catholics to simply take on charitable activities than to have the 
Church officially seek permission.  One example he had provided to 
Staffdel McCormick in January was that of an HIV/AIDS hospice run 
by nuns in Cu Chi District (ref A).  While he had helped the nuns 
acquire a vehicle, he was not otherwise officially involved. 
(Note:  During one of Staffdel McCormick\'s other meetings in HCMC, 
HIV/AIDS officials had actually mentioned the hospice as a 
positive development.  End note.) 
 
2.  (SBU) In a steady series of meetings with USG visitors since 
his elevation to Cardinal in September 2003, Cardinal Man had been 
generally positive on the growth of the church - approximately 
7000 new converts each year since 1998.  Government-imposed 
restrictions on the numbers of seminarians and priests remained a 
primary concern, as evidenced by the fact that only 19 seminarians 
would be graduating from the seminary this year to fill over 50 
vacancies in the Achdiocese, while another 250 young men waited 
for places in an incoming class.  Confiscated properties were 
another item high on the agenda, as the Cardinal announced his 
intention to continue seeking the return of former churches, 
schools, and other buildings.  He did not expect the GVN to return 
all of the 200 properties confiscated in the years since 1975, but 
expressed resentment that in some cases the GVN was still 
utilizing properties it had officially returned to the Church. 
The Cardinal told the Consul General over dinner that he was 
excited at the prospect of regaining an old HCMC seminary property 
in June 2004, and said he was laying the groundwork for the 
government to allow the building to be converted into a \"museum of 
(Catholic) faith.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Meeting with Staffdel Eikenberg in January, Cardinal Man 
said he had repeatedly told the GVN that limited freedom was not 
true freedom and that freedom of religion meant more than just 
going to church.  He stressed the need to find those who were 
blocking positive change within the Communist Party and help them 
overcome their objections.  Still, he did not blame national 
policies for the repression, but rather \"the system\".  He thought 
that some Communists in the South, at least, were good people who 
would like to make changes but were not part of the system. 
Others, however, feared losing power and authority if the people 
were allowed more freedom.  He noted that many Communist cadre 
children were enrolled in a popular Catholic kindergarten run by 
nuns in HCMC, and hoped those children would teach their parents 
about religion.  He also saw the increase in wealth and contact 
with the outside world as positive changes in Vietnam, which would 
stimulate change.  Cardinal Man expressed his appreciation to 
several visitors for the support he had received from the 
Consulate General and the USG. 
 
4. (SBU) Cardinal Man also spoke of reconciliation and dialogue 
with the GVN during his meeting with a delegation from the U.S. 
Commission on International Religious Freedom (CIRFDEL) in January 
(ref B).  While he said there were differences of opinion within 
the Catholic community on how much to accommodate the GVN, he 
thought very few would support the use of force to achieve their 
objectives.  To demonstrate the many small steps religious groups 
could take to protect their interests, he mentioned a meeting he 
had organized to discuss the Fatherland Front\'s patriotic 
association for priests.  After warning the priests in his 
Archdiocese of the dangers of getting involved in political 
activities of any sort without permission from their bishops, many 
priests had left the fledgling group.  In an interesting aside, he 
advised the CIRFDEL to focus on China, noting that changes in 
China would bring change to Vietnam as well.  The Cardinal told 
the group he foresaw a negative reaction from the GVN to Country 
of Particular Concern (CPC) designation in the short-term, but 
thought it might be beneficial in the long-term.  (Note:  Well- 
known activist and Redemptorist priest, Father Chan Tin, 
criticized the Cardinal in his own meeting with the CIRFDEL for 
not supporting Father Ly and for sending out a pastoral letter 
warning of \"false prophets,\" but thought the Cardinal had recently 
started to work harder for religious freedom.  End note.) 
 
5. (SBU) The Cardinal recounted for Staffdel McCormick his meeting 
in late December 2003 with Deputy Prime Minister Vu Khoan.  He 
said he had utilized the meeting to encourage the GVN to ensure 
that the new law on religion authorized religious groups to open 
schools and take a more active role in combating \"social evils.\" 
He was clearly dissatisfied with the present system of \"asking and 
receiving,\" but did not seem hopeful the Church would be given the 
green light to engage freely in charitable works in any new 
legislation.  Man also briefed Staffdel McCormick on meetings in 
the U.S. in September 2003 with Catholic leaders from several 
educational institutions, including Boston College and Loyola 
University of Chicago, to discuss overseas training opportunities. 
On the night of the Consul General\'s dinner, a Vice President of 
Boston College happened to be visiting as well, exploring 
opportunities for sponsoring nuns to receive nursing training in 
the U.S.  The Cardinal also introduced the Consul General to two 
priests whom he hoped to send to the U.S. for studies related to 
pastoral music. 
 
6. (SBU) Note:  Cardinal Pham Minh Man received his MBA from 
Loyola Marymount University in 1971.  Before his investiture as 
Archbishop of HCMC in April 1998, he served as the Bishop of My 
Tho Diocese in the Mekong Delta.  The Vatican appointed Archbishop 
Man to the rank of Cardinal on September 28, 2003, and he was 
officially elevated in Rome on October 21.  Then-Bishop Man was a 
compromise choice for HCMC Archbishop back in 1998, when the 
Vatican attempted to appoint the Bishop of Phan Thiet, Huynh Van 
Nghi, as Apostolic Administrator to the city over the objections 
of the GVN, which insisted on Father Huynh Cong Minh, one of the 
founders of the Patriotic Committee for Catholic Solidarity.  The 
GVN may have believed that the Vatican was trying to appoint 
Bishop Nghi as Apostolic Administrator to allow them to name 
exiled priest Nguyen Van Thuan (the now-deceased Cardinal Francis 
Xavier Thuan -- reftel C) as Archbishop in absentia.  End note. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT:  Cardinal Man is generally willing to speak 
openly about Church issues, his dealings with the GVN, and his 
assessment of the situation for Catholics in Vietnam.  While he 
uses coded language on occasion, his often pointed remarks make 
clear his dissatisfaction with GVN controls on the social and 
educational activities of the Church.  For now, at least, it does 
not appear that any sense of compromise with the GVN over his 
recent elevation  has led him to temper his views, or his 
willingness to discuss them (reftel D).  His measured response to 
the request from the city to take on a very visible charitable 
function is in keeping with his general approach, but this is 
clearly a major step forward for the Church in HCMC under his 
stewardship.  He was clearly pleased to have been \"invited\" to 
provide assistance, but he also noted that providing care for 
HIV/AIDS patients was something \"nobody else really wanted to do.\" 
Should the Cardinal decide to provide the \"nunpower\" for this 
project, Post will work with Embassy CDC Office to find training 
opportunities to offer him and the city.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S STOCK MARKET:  A VIEW FROM THE FLOOR LOOKING UP 
 
REF:  A) 02 HCMC 1213   B) Hanoi 0719 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  Vietnam\'s stock market has stirred recently.  Since last fall, 
the market index has more than doubled.  This comes, however, 
after a two-and-a-half year decline, during which the HCMC stock 
market lost more than three-fourths of its value.  Much of the 
recent run up in prices is attributed to the loosening of 
restrictions on foreign investors in the market, which may have 
also stimulated local demand.  Still the market is tiny - with an 
overall capitalization of about US$240 million and only 23 listed 
companies.  There are only 106 registered foreign investors.  With 
liberalization of investment caps on foreigners, new investment 
funds entering the market, and promises of a rash of new listings, 
some government officials and local analysts have high hopes for 
rising values and a developing market.  The \"smart money\" from 
wealthy private sector businesspeople is still sitting on the 
sidelines, however.  They prefer to invest in unlisted firms or 
their own businesses where, they believe, potential profits are 
much higher.  They do not see the Stock Market as a viable 
investment vehicle for a few more years.  On the contrary: Beware 
the local stock market, they say.  End summary. 
 
Bull Market or Just Plain Bull? 
------------------------------- 
2.  With an overall market capitalization of only about US$240 
million and 23 listed companies, the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Market 
has been a huge disappointment.  After an initial flurry of 
speculative increases when the stock index peaked at 571 points in 
early summer 2001, stock prices had been on a grim march to the 
bottom.  The index reached a low of 130 last autumn.  Since 
hitting bottom, however, the market index has more than doubled to 
over 260 points. 
 
3.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Trading Center (HSTC) opened its 
doors in July 2000 as Vietnam\'s first and only stock market.  It 
was a modest start with only two companies listed on the Vietnam 
Index, worth a combined US$31.5 million (Ref A).  In this rapidly 
developing economy, the bourse has been something of a nonentity. 
It has thus far failed to draw significant numbers of investors or 
listed companies.  Even today after the dramatic run up in values, 
there are fewer than 16,000 Vietnamese investors, mostly inactive, 
and only 106 registered foreign investors.  The number of listed 
companies has grown slowly to the current 23 companies with 
overall capitalization of about US$240 million.  The pace of new 
listings has been glacial -- 4 new listings since November 2002. 
 
4.  Besides being the venue for trading listed equities, HSTC is 
also the nation\'s official bond-trading center.  The bond market 
in Vietnam, now valued at about US$800 million, is currently 
limited to government bonds.  These bonds, however, are thinly 
traded on the exchange, as banks, insurance companies, and other 
long-term investors typically hold bonds from the initial auction 
to maturity. 
 
5.  The lack of growth in the stock market contrasts dramatically 
with what has happened with other investments here.  Local 
investors have been snapping up shares in companies in the largely 
unregulated over-the-counter market.  No one seems to know for 
sure, but estimates range from one thousand to fifteen hundred 
companies with a value of about US$1.5 billion.  Buying and 
selling in this market offers none of the relative transparency 
and protection of trading listed companies on the stock market. 
These stocks are typically sold by word of mouth, making it 
difficult to know a true \"market price.\"  Nonetheless, local 
investors apparently prefer the grey market where they have more 
investment choices and where they can buy into firms that they 
feel they understand, but which are not necessarily ready to make 
all of the disclosures required for listed companies.   Investors 
in this market are not typically stock traders, but have followed 
a \"buy and hold\" strategy.  At the same time, many of Vietnam\'s 
wealthy invest in their own businesses or the businesses of their 
friends.  And at least until recently, property was also seen as a 
good, safe investment, and thus real estate prices, especially in 
Vietnam\'s large cities, have risen to speculative levels. 
 
No Irrational Exuberance, But Things are Looking Up 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
6.  There are a variety of stimuli that may have triggered the 
recent price rise.  Foremost may be increased foreign buying. 
Until last summer, by law foreigners were limited to an aggregate 
20 percent ownership of any given stock and 7 percent ownership by 
any single foreign owner.  Last summer, however, the market 
regulator State Securities Commission (SSC) raised the bar to 30 
percent aggregate foreign ownership in any one stock and removed 
the 7 percent limit.  Foreigners once again began buying.  Already 
5 of the 23 listed companies have reached the 30 percent cap.  One 
expat working in the local securities industry stated his view 
that a few actively trading foreigners triggered the run up, which 
was relatively easy to do with such a small market.  This 
attracted other foreign investors and in turn even stimulated 
local Vietnamese investors, who started buying when they saw the 
market begin to rise and foreigners returning to the market.  It 
is not clear how much is left of the current market rally, but two 
foreigners active in the securities industry here claim there is 
still a strong upside potential in the market. 
 
7.  Much of the recent growth generated by foreign investors has 
come by way of investment funds taking larger stakes in the local 
market.  Dragon Capital, a U.K. based investment bank, which has 
been working in Vietnam for the past decade, continues to buy 
listed and unlisted stocks for its VEIL (Vietnam Enterprise 
Investments Limited) Fund on the Irish stock exchange.  Dragon 
Capital is currently the largest single investor in the market 
outside of the GVN.  Phan Xi Pan Investment Fund, named after the 
Vietnam\'s highest mountain peak, also listed on the Irish 
exchange, has recently invested US$5 million and is planning to 
invest another US$5 million soon.  The German fund DEG is actively 
buying shares on the exchange and the Swiss fund FMO has expressed 
an interest in entering the market.  The foreign funds are joined 
by the locally based VietFund, a partnership of Dragon Capital and 
Sacom Bank, which is preparing to raise and invest 250 billion VND 
(about US$16 million) of registered capital in the exchange.  This 
fund, which will list itself on the exchange and trade as a closed- 
end fund, will be open to both foreign and Vietnamese investors. 
 
8.  Another factor in this run up may have been that stock prices 
fell so low that bottom feeders also began to bite.  The average 
P/E ratio for listed firms, which reached 40 at its peak, was well 
in the single digits when the run up started, and average 
dividends were in the double digits.  At the same time, other 
places to put away money were looking increasingly less 
attractive.  Bank deposit rates were near historic lows, while 
property, a traditional investment in this part of the world, had 
reached all-time highs in Vietnam\'s major cities.  Gold prices had 
also risen considerably. 
 
9.  Credit may also go to the Vietnamese Government, which has 
renewed its commitment to creating new listings on the market. 
This was reinforced by the recent decision to move the SSC, which 
had been under the Office of the Prime Minister, to the Ministry 
of Finance (ref B).  The stock index rose after this decision 
became public.  Local press reports as well as our contacts in the 
securities industry believe that with the backing of the ministry, 
the SSC will draw more state-owned enterprises (SOEs) undergoing 
`equitization\' to list shares on the exchange.  One such company 
listed just this week.  The government may also be closer to 
allowing foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) to list on the 
market.  According to an SSC official speaking at an HCMC seminar 
on the stock market, 20 FIEs would be allowed to list on the 
market as part of a pilot program. 
 
10.  The banking sector also offers potential fuel for the 
market\'s continued rise.  At least three leading joint stock banks 
(Sacom Bank, Asia Commercial Bank, and East Asia Bank) have begun 
the application process to list their shares, currently traded 
over the counter, on the exchange.  Entry of even one of these 
banks would significantly increase the market\'s capitalization. 
ACB hopes that it will be able to list this year or next.  The 
bank estimates that their market capitalization alone would be in 
the range of US$90 million. 
 
But Will the Momentum Continue? 
------------------------------- 
11.  The local securities industry and even the government is 
actively touting the stock market and there does seem to be some 
interest.  Earlier this month, the HCMC government and the SSC 
hosted a seminar on \"Opportunities for Foreign Investors: 
Securities and the Stock Market.\"  The seminar drew about 240 
participants.  About half the attendees were foreigners, the 
majority from Asia, while the remainder were representatives from 
listed companies and a few local investors.  Foreign buyers will 
probably continue to provide support to the market as investment 
funds expand and new funds are established, especially if good 
companies get listed.  Five of the 23 listed companies, however, 
have already reached their maximum foreign holding level of 30 
percent. 
 
12.  At the seminar, a theme hit on repeatedly was the low profile 
of the listed companies.  They are not big name companies, even by 
Vietnamese standards.  A Western financial reporter quoting 
conversations he has had with overseas investors said, \"We\'ve 
never heard of these companies,\" and went on to ask when investors 
would see flagship companies on the exchange -- like Vietnam 
Airlines and Vinamilk.  Officials waffled on the big names and 
merely said that many SOEs were slated for equitization and each 
would be considered for listing.   But the First Vice Chairman of 
the HCMC People\'s Committee quipped that although the city was 
working to equitize SOEs, he thought some would still be around in 
his granddaughter\'s day.  It may also take some time before the 
market grows large enough to be able to absorb a company the size 
of Vietnam Airlines.  Investors may have to wait for the market to 
grow a bit before they get a shot at the big names. 
 
Smart Money Not Buying 
---------------------- 
13.  While analysts and government officials are touting the stock 
market, the \"smart money\" remains wary.  ConGenoffs asked several 
local business contacts, each owning one or more companies and 
wealthy by any international standard, if they had or were 
planning to invest in the stock market.  Their across-the-board 
response, besides grim chuckles, was \"No way.\"  Each pointed out 
the lack of dynamic companies on the exchange.  Listed enterprises 
are not business powerhouses and savvy investors know it.  All but 
one of the listed companies are former SOEs, and the government 
still retains a large stake in most.  Vietnam\'s most profitable 
and efficient firms are not on the exchange.  One contact said, 
\"The day I see ACB (Asia Commercial Bank) go to the stock exchange 
I will go.\"  (Note: ACB is trying to list and believes it will be 
able to do so this year or the next. End note) 
 
14.  Some businessmen were also cautious about companies that 
might be listing in the future.  \"Be careful, because many of the 
companies which are seeking to list in the near future are doing 
so not to raise capital to invest in the company, but to be able 
to sell out at an attractive price.\"  These business people were 
particularly concerned about some of the banks and FIEs that were 
interested in listing. 
 
15.  ConGen contacts bemoaned the lack of credible and independent 
information on listed companies and their industries.  There is no 
Wall Street Journal or Financial Times here, one pointed out. 
Without an unbiased third party to report on and analyze these 
companies, it is difficult to get the true picture of the listed 
firms, even with the stock market\'s disclosure requirements. 
These businessmen operate in a world where personal contacts and 
inside knowledge are key to success.   The bottom line - when it 
comes to companies they don\'t know, there is no source of 
information they can trust. 
 
16.  So, if they aren\'t investing in the market, who is?  These 
contacts described current Vietnamese stock market investors as 
small players -- people without enough money or access to 
participate in other arenas.  In their view, the stock market is 
for people who cannot afford HCMC\'s speculative real estate game, 
people who do not have the network of contacts to enable them to 
sufficiently vet grey market offerings, or individuals whose 
assets are not enough to buy into unlisted companies.  Basically, 
they do not see the HSTC as a place for serious investors. 
 
17.  In these businessmen\'s view, there is limited room for quick 
growth as the SSC caps the daily price movement and limits trading 
hours.  Two ConGen contacts likened the market to gambling, but 
without the possibility of a big win.  One also complained that he 
would be required to pay full market value of the shares up front 
as no margin trading is permitted -- in essence tying up his money 
and keeping it from better uses. 
 
18.  One businessman did admit that when the HSTC opened he 
enthusiastically dove right in.  He bought listed stocks and even 
set up a division in his company to track and analyze the market. 
But by the HSTC\'s second anniversary he \"hated it.\"  He described 
the frustrations of investing in what he called \"not a real stock 
market,\" unlike the Singapore market where he also invested. 
After just over two years in the market he sold out with a small 
loss.  He has no intention to return. 
 
19.  These businessmen are the movers and shakers in the local 
economy.  They have a proven ability to make money and a 
comprehensive understanding of how things work here.  Up to now, 
they remain unconvinced.  Their estimates of when the stock market 
would be a viable investment vehicle worthy of their consideration 
ranged from 3-10 years, 
 
Smart Money Not Listing 
----------------------- 
20.  Our contacts clearly do not trade on the exchange, but would 
they ever consider listing their companies to raise capital?  From 
their responses, that is even less likely.  As well-connected 
businesspeople, if they need to raise money for a business project 
they simply pass the word through their network of contacts and 
associates.  One contact had just launched a new company and 
claimed he had no shortage of people willing to buy stakes worth 1 
or 2 billion VND (about US$63-127,000).  They are also actively 
courted by a variety of local banks. 
 
21.  Each of these local tycoons also said they were unwilling or 
unable to meet the disclosure requirements mandated by the SSC. 
It was too much of a hassle and would open them to scrutiny, 
perhaps government scrutiny, which they would prefer to avoid. 
One contact also expressed the worry that, if listed, his company 
was open to slander in the press that could damage the share 
value.  He seemed more worried about the inability of the firm to 
defend itself against false allegations in the press.  Even if the 
allegations were untrue, he said, he had no real recourse under 
current Vietnamese law. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
22.  Increased foreign involvement seems to be driving the recent 
stock market growth.  The advocates touting the market, with 
investment firms and brokerages leading the charge, point to 
Vietnam\'s overall economic growth and future potential and then 
try to draw a connection from that to the stock market.  They 
skate around the fact that the listed companies are not leading 
this economic charge.  Vietnam is growing and the stock market is 
one of few vehicles for foreigners to take a stake in that growth. 
Foreign investors lack the all-important network of contacts and 
do not have access to most stocks traded off the exchange.  So, 
unless they want to open a factory or take a large stake in a 
joint venture, the HSTC is the only game in town.  The current 
caps on foreign ownership coupled with the dearth of listings 
means room for foreign investment is limited. 
 
23.  The GVN needs to speed up the pace of new listings and 
implement the plan for listing joint venture firms -- a plan that 
has been under review for over 18 months.  These moves will 
continue to make room for additional foreign investment. 
Meanwhile, the lack of flagship companies, including banks, and 
the perceived opportunity cost of stock market investments will 
continue to drive away top tier Vietnamese investors who, unlike 
their foreign counterparts, have a wide range of other investment 
options in Vietnam.  They still advise avoiding Vietnam\'s stock 
market.

SUBJECT: CLAIMS OF CHURCH CLOSURES AND BEATINGS IN CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS BLUNT GOOD NEWS ON NEW PASTORS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0084  B) HANOI 0712  C) HCMC 0279 
 
1. (U) Summary:  Protestant sources reported that while the 
overall religious situation in the Central Highlands was still 
showing signs of improvement, as evidenced by six new ordinations, 
additional cases of house church closures, destruction of church 
properties, and arrests and beatings of those involved in the 
ethnic unrest of 2001 had surfaced since ConGenoffs\' last trip to 
the region in January 2004 (ref A).  These sources also described 
several incidents of alleged discrimination against the 
predominantly Protestant Ja Rai (Gia Rai) ethnic minority people. 
End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Consul General and Poloff met with Pastor Siu Y Kim 
(protect), a member of the Representative Board of the Vietnamese 
Government-recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV) in Gia Lai province, and his brother Siu Ya Kop (protect), 
a HCMC-based medical doctor, for two hours at the ConGen on March 
16, 2004.  The two are long-time contacts of the ConGen and are 
generally reliable on subjects (good or bad) where they have 
personal knowledge. 
 
3. (SBU) Pastor Kim confirmed that the ordination of six new SECV 
pastors and four new lay pastors had taken place as planned in Gia 
Lai Province on March 9, 2004 (ref B).  He brought photos of the 
ceremony, which took place at his house.  He also reported that 
the chairman of Gia Lai\'s Chu Se District People\'s Committee had 
agreed to meet with him later in the week to discuss land for a 
new church.  Pastor Kim indicated that past land discussions with 
provincial officials had not proven productive, but he still was 
hopeful.  While new church registrations and ordinations were 
welcome news, he believed the GVN was still reluctant to allow the 
construction of real churches in Gia Lai.  He said provincial 
authorities had already rejected his request for the return of 
confiscated properties. 
 
4. (SBU) Without giving an exact time frame, Pastor Kim noted that 
two pre-1975 Christian and Missionary Alliance properties in Gia 
Lai had recently been damaged or destroyed. One had already been 
replaced with a kindergarten.  He believes provincial authorities 
have done this to avoid having to return the properties to the 
SECV.  He referred to Official Letter #783, regarding religious 
properties -- he does not expect to recover church buildings, but 
at least hopes for compensation. (Note: The CMA is the only 
Protestant denomination recognized by the GVN at this time.  Many 
CMA churches have chosen not to register with the SECV, however, 
and operate as underground house churches, often with the tacit 
approval of local authorities.  End note.)  According to Pastor 
Kim, the Gia Lai SECV Representative Board and the HCMC-based SECV 
Executive Board had both sent protest letters to the provincial 
authorities, but had yet to receive a response.  Pastor Kim had 
also learned of three house churches in Sa Tay District, Kon Tum 
Province, which were reportedly shut down between January and 
March 2004. He noted that these three congregations were not among 
the 13 CMA house churches that Kon Tum officials tacitly allow to 
operate. 
 
5. (SBU) Pastor Kim also discussed ongoing refugee problems in Gia 
Lai.  He noted that three ethnic minority men (Ama Suon and Y Lut 
were the two names he remembered), who had reportedly been hiding 
in the jungle since the ethnic unrest of 2001, had been captured 
by police in February and beaten.  Police had detained the three 
after learning they had returned returned from the jungle.  They 
were discovered hiding under the floorboards of their homes. 
According to Pastor Kim\'s sources, one person had died while in 
police custody.  His family members said the body had exhibited 
signs of head trauma when it was returned by the police.  The 
other two individuals reportedly died a few days after police 
released them from custody and returned them to their villages. 
Villagers noted that these two persons were in \"bad shape\" when 
they returned.  Authorities claimed they had been ill.  Pastor Kim 
dismissed the idea that they might have been suffering the effects 
of living in the jungle, noting local villagers took good care of 
those in hiding.  (He believes approximately 50 persons remain in 
the jungle.)  As an aside, he mentioned that the police had also 
confiscated \"lots of\" cellular telephones when they arrested these 
three persons. 
 
6. (SBU) Related to ongoing refugee problems, Pastor Kim described 
the problems faced by several families petitioned as Visas 93 
following-to-join cases by relatives who had resettled in the U.S. 
via Cambodia in 2001 and 2002.  Two families had been charged 2.5 
million Vietnamese dong (about USD$160 dollars) by local 
authorities for official copies of birth certificates.  Three 
other families have been unable to obtain passports, including a 
member of one of his Protestant congregations, Ms. R\'Mah H\'Ri.  He 
stated quite emphatically that he believed she would never receive 
a passport (Ref C provides update on R\'Mah H\'Ri\'s departure for 
the U.S.)  Pastor Kim noted that government officials were 
becoming more sophisticated.  He said he had heard stories of 
other families facing similar problems, but could not offer 
specifics.  In a response to a question, he said he could only say 
for certain that this practice had occurred in Gia Lai Province. 
Pastor Kim noted that government officials were becoming more 
sophisticated.  Nothing is put in writing; promises, threats, or 
insinuations are all just spoken. 
 
7. (SBU) Pastor Kim recounted several recent land-use disputes 
involving ethnic minority Ja Rai and majority Vietnamese Kinh in 
Gia Lai Province in recent months.  He said the government had 
taken ethnic minority lands for public use under a provincial 
\"master plan,\" without paying fair compensation.  He acknowledged, 
however, that the \"landowners\" did not have official deeds or 
leases for their properties, holding them instead as \"traditional\" 
homesteads.  One farmer, R\'Hlan Yen, in Plei Tu village, Ea Kar 
District, reportedly had his land seized to build a stadium, while 
another farmer, Siu Den, fled his village to escape a nine-month 
prison sentence on charges of illegal deforestation.  Pastor Kim 
spoke at length about an incident in late January 2004, where the 
ethnic minority residents of Plei Su and other villages verbally 
squared off at least three times with the management of rubber 
plantations in Duc Co, Chu Prong and Chu Se Districts.  The 
villagers had reportedly given their traditional lands to the 
plantations in exchange for employment, but were later fired and 
replaced by ethnic Vietnamese Kinh  brought down from the north. 
The villagers engaged in several heated verbal confrontations with 
management, before the provincial People\'s Committee also became 
involved.  Pastor Kim noted that each confrontation had ended with 
some sort of oral agreement, but the management had yet to follow 
through on its promises to restore jobs or pay adequate 
compensation.  Nonetheless, he regarded these three meetings as 
\"victories\" for the common people. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment:  Pastor Kim and his brother acknowledged that 
much of their information was based on second or thirdhand 
reports.  Pastor Kim blamed government surveillance and 
restrictions on travel for his inability to get out and verify 
some of these claims.  As a result, he often made vague statements 
or lacked details when he made a specific allegation.  At one 
point, he painted a dark picture of ethnic minority Christians 
being fired from jobs and expelled from school.  These are 
accusations we have heard from other sources periodically over the 
past two years, and each time the GVN official or schoolmaster -- 
or sometimes even another pastor -- denies them.   Asked to 
elaborate, Pastor Kim said the government\'s plan was to 
discriminate against Protestants until they got tired of the 
pressure and just gave up and resigned their jobs or left school. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment (cont):  That said, Pastor Kim is one of our best 
contacts.  He is sincere in his approach to working with the 
government as a legal SECV pastor on the one hand, while 
maintaining his leadership of the mostly ethnic Ja Rai (Gia Rai) 
house churches.  Pastor Kim noted that he did not want to be like 
some of the Mennonite leaders currently operating in the country, 
who intentionally try to provoke the GVN in the Central Highlands. 
Still, the bigger issue is whether the discrimination alleged to 
be religious in nature is in fact really traditional ethnic 
discrimination entangled with ownership disputes over tribal 
lands.  Many Ja Rai are Christian, but a sizable minority are not. 
Pastor Kim\'s assertion that the oppression is worse for the 
Christian Ja Rai in Gia Lai Province should be evaluated in the 
context of the general poverty and politico-economic backwardness 
of the Central Highlands.

SUBJECT: LETTERS FROM HOA HAO DISSIDENT 
 
REF:  HCMC 0252 
 
1. (SBU) Summary.  Leading HCMC-based Hoa Hao \"dissident\" Tran Huu 
Duyen recently provided Post with two letters detailing his views 
on the status of religious freedom and the Hoa Hao.  One letter 
was addressed to the Consulate General and one to Congress. 
While few of his points are new, they provide a reminder that 
there remains deep disatisfaction in some Hoa Hao quarters with 
the current status quo.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In an English-language petition dated January 13, 2004, 
and given to Poloff in late February during preparations for a 
reporting trip to the Hoa Hao Holy Land in An Giang Province, 
Duyen detailed his version of Hoa Hao complaints from 1975 to 
present, including the treatment of Mr. Nguyen Van Lia (reftel). 
In the letter, he asks the USG to press the GVN in six specific 
areas.  The complete text of the six points follows: 
 
BEGIN TEXT 
 
-- Allow Hoa Hao Buddhists to exercise their freedom of religion 
and participate in independent religious activities. 
 
-- Allow Hoa Hao Buddhists to organize a General Election of the 
Central Council of Administrators and all other levels of the Hao 
Hao Buddhist Church.  The election of all administrative officials 
should be free and fair, with the participation of all Hoa Hao 
Buddhists, instead of the current system of appointment by the 
Communist government. 
 
-- Allow the re-establishment of the Board of Directors of the 
Ancestral temple. 
 
-- Allow the Hoa Hao Buddhist Church to reprint all publications 
and teachings in their original forms; allow the use and display 
of the Hoa Hao Buddhist flag at all religious functions and church 
properties. 
 
-- Return all confiscated prosperities of the Hoa Hao Buddhist 
Church. 
 
-- Release all Hoa Hao Buddhist prisoners who have been wrongfully 
convicted and/or imprisoned. 
 
END TEXT 
 
3. (SBU) In early March, Duyen forwarded to the ConGen by email a 
\"Heart Letter from Mr. Tran Huu Duyen to U.S. Representatives and 
Senators sent via U.S. ConGen HCMC.\"  The letter (in Vietnamese) 
thanks the USG and other foreign groups for pressuring the GVN on 
religious freedom issues, and describes his views on the current 
religious freedom and human rights situation in Vietnam.  Included 
in the letter is a proposal for USG assistance to help revive a 
pre-1975 human rights organization of which he was a member. 
According to Duyen, the former Saigon government permitted the 
establishment of the Vietnam Human Rights and Civil Rights 
Protection Association in 1964.  Several members were arrested 
after 1975.  The letter goes on to say that Duyen would like the 
Consulate to forward this letter to the U.S. Congress so that the 
USG can create \"favorable conditions\" for this Association to 
operate again.  Duyen further expressed hope that a resurrected 
Vietnam Human Rights and Civil Rights Protection Association could 
work with the current Government of Vietnam to find an \"emergency 
escape route\" toward \"real democracy and fairness,\" so that a 
healthy Vietnam can be integrated into world economic, political 
and cultural life.  According to his letter, this would be the 
start of a \"national mediation and conciliation process.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Due to their history of armed rebellion, the Hoa Hao have 
always been watched closely by whatever government happens to be 
in power.  Duyen himself has spent nearly half of his 80-plus 
years in prison.   He was arrested several times by the French 
before 1954, three times by the South Vietnamese, including for 
his alleged role in an attempted coup against President Ngo Dinh 
Diem in 1960, and another three times by the GVN.  He was arrested 
most recently in 1991, and released in 1998 as part of a general 
amnesty.  Duyen was a contemporary of Hoa Hao founder Huynh Phu 
So, and appears to command great respect and influence within the 
Hoa Hoa community, both in Vietnam and overseas. 
 
5. (SBU) The Hoa Hao have been greatly factionalized since the 
founder\'s death in 1947, and Duyen has always claimed to operate 
as something of an honest broker between rival factions.  (Post 
Note: Depending on the source estimates of the number of Hoa Hao 
followers ranges from 1.2 million to 3 million.)  Duyen has also 
generally maintained that the privatistic nature of Hoa Hao 
worship really obviates the need for any sort of formal religious 
association.  He is proud of his contacts with other political and 
religious activists, including outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam deputy Thich Quang Do (they were released from detention 
on the same day and transported in the same vehicle), Cao Dai 
priest Le Quang Tan, and democracy advocate Dr. Nguyen Dan Que. 
Duyen has recently moved to a small apartment on the outskirts of 
HCMC, which is an improvement over the run-down apartment he had 
occupied since the family home was confiscated by the GVN in 1975. 
His son, formerly a U.S.-trained officer in the South Vietnamese 
Navy, works as a cyclo driver. 
 
6.  (U) Post will forward an unofficial translation of the letter 
to the Desk via separate e-mail.

SUBJECT: FORMER UBCV MONK THICH TRI LUC: RELIEVED AT HIS RELEASE, 
EAGER TO RESETTLE 
 
REF:  A) Hanoi 0752   B) 03 Hanoi 2858 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Pham Van Tuong (protect), formerly known as 
Thich Tri Luc, met with CG and ConGenoffs for two hours on March 
30, 2004, four days after his release from prison.  The former 
monk from the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) 
appeared to be in good physical and mental condition, and was 
eager to discuss his past activities and future plans.  He was not 
at all fearful of repercussions from his visit to the ConGen, 
having informed the local police matter-of-factly about the 
meeting in advance.  Public security officials had advised him at 
the time of his release that someone from the USG would be 
contacting him shortly.  They had also advised him that UNHCR 
would want to speak with him regarding his refugee case, but he 
had yet to hear from the UNHCR.  Tuong was unequivocal in his 
desire to resettle with his family in the U.S.  See para. 12 for 
suggested press guidance.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) During the meeting, which was arranged at the behest of 
the ConGen, Tuong provided additional background information on 
his March 12 trial (ref A) to supplement the details already made 
public by the GVN.  The two-hour trial finally took place after 
three postponements dating back to July 25, 2003.  Tuong was kept 
abreast of those scheduling changes, and provided with copies of 
all of the court documents related to his case along the way.  He 
was not permitted to retain legal counsel, but his family was 
allowed to attend the otherwise closed hearing.  He assumed that 
all of the other individuals present in the courtroom were either 
court officials or public security officers.  The GVN presented no 
witnesses or documentary evidence, but questioned Tuong on his 
past activities in Vietnam and Cambodia.  He declined an offer to 
present a statement in his own defense.  Prior to the trial, 
public security officials advised him that they would facilitate 
his resettlement abroad in exchange for his silence on the 
circumstances of his arrest in Cambodia and the conditions of his 
imprisonment in Vietnam.  Tuong agreed, and was sentenced to 20 
months in prison, with credit for time served (19.5 months).  He 
was released on March 26, 2004. 
 
3. (SBU) Tuong\'s description of the events leading up to his 
forcible return to Vietnam in July 2002 matched closely the 
accounts published overseas by the UBCV\'s Paris-based 
International Buddhist Information Bureau (IBIB).  Recounting his 
reasons for fleeing Vietnam in the first place, Tuong noted his 
frustration with continued police surveillance and denial of basic 
residency rights after his release from a 30-month prison sentence 
in 1997.  That sentence -- imposed for his participation in an 
unauthorized flood relief project organized by UBCV Deputy Thich 
Quang Do -- included five additional years of administrative 
probation after his release.  He was also expelled from the Phap 
Van Pagoda during that time. 
 
4. (SBU) Unable to serve as a monk, Tuong left the UBCV and 
married in 1999.  A son from that marriage was born in 2002, while 
Tuong was in jail in Ho Chi Minh City.  (Note: Tuong also 
acknowledged getting \"married\" for the first time and fathering a 
child while still a monk in 1994, in violation of Buddhist law. 
He \"divorced\" the woman two years later, but the child is 
registered under his surname.  His second child is registered 
under the mother\'s surname, since Vietnamese law prohibits 
registering a marriage for someone without household registration. 
End note.)  Tuong claimed his attempts to reenter the monkhood in 
2001 were thwarted by GVN security officials.  Even after his 
administrative detention ended in February 2002, the surveillance 
and harassment continued.  Frustrated by his situation, he fled to 
Cambodia with UBCV monk Thich Tam Van, arriving in Phnom Penh on 
April 19, 2002. 
 
5. (SBU) Immediately upon their arrival in Cambodia, Tuong and 
Thich Tam Van sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, 
where Tuong said they were warmly received.  They were given 
instructions on how to apply for refugee status with UNHCR, and 
followed them.  UNHCR representative Goran Rosen interviewed Tuong 
on May 31, 2002, and issued him a temporary refugee certificate on 
June 3, 2002.  He received his official refugee certificate (#610) 
from UNHCR Cambodia Chief Elizabeth Kirten on June 28, 2002. 
Rosen and resident Human Rights Watch representative Sara Colm 
were also on hand when he received his certificate.  Tuong was not 
permitted to live in a refugee camp for Vietnamese, which was 
reserved for ethnic minorities from the Central Highlands. 
Instead, he was given an allowance of $85 per month by UNHCR. 
UNHCR representatives also gave him phone numbers to call should 
he get into trouble. 
 
6. (SBU) Throughout his stay in Cambodia, Tuong spent most of his 
time writing letters to UBCV supporters in the U.S., Australia, 
and France.  They sometimes sent him money for living expenses and 
postage.  Vo Van Ai of the IBIB was among those who provided 
financial support.  Tuong also sent letters to UBCV leaders Thich 
Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Do in Vietnam, but was not sure they 
had ever received them, as they had not responded.  (He claimed 
there were no UBCV monks in Phnom Penh.)  While most of his 
letters were critical of the GVN on human rights and religious 
freedom issues, Tuong claims he never advocated overthrowing the 
GVN.  On June 26, 2002, he sent a report to Human Rights Watch on 
alleged human rights abuses involving political prisoners in 
Vietnam.  While Tuong told ConGenoffs that none of these letters 
or his Human Rights Watch report was presented at the trial, he 
assumed the GVN knew of their existence.  In fact, toward the end 
of his prison term, prison officials had instructed him to 
recreate these documents from memory as closely as possible and 
write them down. 
 
7. (SBU) In the weeks before his arrest, Tuong heard rumors that 
Vietnamese police in Phnom Penh were looking for him.  In fact, 
Vietnamese officials had already questioned Thich Tam Van on 
several occasions.  (Note: According to Tuong, UNHCR quickly 
granted Thich Tam Van refugee status the day after his arrest, and 
he was subsequently resettled in the U.S.  End note.)  On July 25, 
2002 at approximately 7:00 p.m., Tuong was shopping near his 
guesthouse in Phnom Penh when he was surrounded by a group of 
Vietnamese and Cambodian security officials, forced into a car 
(license plate 2475 plus two Khmer characters), handcuffed, and 
beaten.  He guessed that many of the officers were Vietnamese by 
the fact that they spoke to him in his mother tongue.  Despite 
Tuong\'s protestations that he was under UNHCR protection, the 
police confiscated his refugee card, drove him to an 
\"international police\" station, placed him in a tourist vehicle, 
and then drove him to a different police station, where he spent 
the night in handcuffs.  In the morning, the original car drove 
him to the Moc Bai border crossing in Tay Ninh Province, Vietnam, 
where waiting Vietnamese officials took custody and transferred 
him to the municipal detention center at 237 Nguyen Van Cu Street 
in Ho Chi Minh City.  Tuong said his original arrest record 
indicated that he was arrested at the border, but this report was 
later replaced by a report showing that he was arrested in Tay 
Ninh province for \"fleeing the country to oppose the State.\" 
 
8. (SBU) During Tuong\'s first five months in prison, this 
particular detention center was used to house some of the 155 
defendants in the landmark Nam Cam corruption trial, so prisoners 
often had to share cells.  Block C, where Tuong was housed, 
contained 15 special cells of about nine square meters each, with 
very small openings for ventilation and no outside light.  With 
their doors closed, Tuong likened the environment to being \"inside 
a pot with its lid on.\"  Constant street noise from just outside 
the wall made conditions even more unbearable.  Prisoners were 
allowed out briefly to pick up food and bring it back to their 
cells, but they were not allowed to talk during this time.  Tuong 
was aware of some of the other notable prisoners in the facility, 
including Father Ly\'s nephews and Dr. Nguyen Dan Que.  He saw Dr. 
Que pick up food once in February, and thought he looked healthy, 
but he heard from others that Dr. Que was sometimes ill.  Once a 
week, prisoners were also allowed to purchase food or other items 
with money provided by family.  Tuong\'s family did not know about 
his imprisonment for almost a year and so could not provide funds. 
When Tuong noticed he was receiving larger portions than the other 
prisoners, however, he asked for money in place of the extra food. 
Prison officials then provided him with a monthly allowance of 
90,000 Vietnamese dong (about US$6) per month.  While prison 
officials treated him well, he was frequently interrogated about 
his activities in Cambodia, especially about his June 26 report to 
Human Rights Watch.  He was only allowed to see his family once 
during his imprisonment, on August 22, 2003. 
 
9. (SBU) In a slight detour from his story, Tuong excitedly 
related his prison conversations with his cellmate for four 
months, Major Ho Tran Lap (protect), a former military 
intelligence officer and one-time Communist Party member.  Lap was 
serving a twelve-year sentence for telecommunications fraud 
(setting up a callback service), but also appeared to have turned 
into something of a dissident.  Lap told him that the Vietnamese 
had left behind many military intelligence agents when they pulled 
out of Cambodia in 1983, including Unit X-11, which specialized in 
watching Vietnamese and other \"hostile forces\" in Cambodia.  Lap 
also told Tuong that he was 70 percent certain American prisoners 
of war were still being held in secret military prisons in the 
North, but refused to provide more details.  When asked whether 
Lap might have been sent to spy on him, Tuong stated that he 
trusted Lap, in part because of a story Lap shared about another 
military intelligence agent, Phan Dien, who was murdered in Ho Chi 
Minh City in 1981.  Tuong said Lap felt \"cheated\" by the Party and 
had become a democracy advocate instead. 
10. (SBU) After his release, Tuong moved in with his wife\'s family 
in Thu Duc District, Ho Chi Minh City.  He was told that all of 
his rights as a citizen were restored, and felt he was under no 
restrictions or surveillance at present.  On March 29, he applied 
for a new household registration book -- required to obtain 
residency and receive a variety of employment, education, and 
health benefits -- in Long Thanh District of neighboring Dong Nai 
Province, but has yet to receive an answer from authorities on his 
application.  In the meantime, he had applied for temporary 
residence in Thu Duc, where his application was also pending.  He 
had told the police in Thu Duc that he would be attending a 
meeting at the ConGen.  Regarding the UBCV, Tuong said he had not 
yet been in contact with any of his former UBCV colleagues in 
Vietnam.  He had, however, already spoken with Vo Van Ai of the 
IBIB by telephone.  At Ai\'s request, Tuong had prepared a full 
report on his case and was endeavoring to find a way to send it to 
the IBIB.  He said that Ai wanted to use the information to \"fight 
back\" against GVN misinformation on his case. 
 
11. (SBU) Tuong told ConGenoffs in no uncertain terms that he was 
only interested in resettlement in the U.S., not in any other 
country, including Australia.  He hoped his current wife and 18- 
month-old son would be able to join him there.  His future plans 
in the U.S. would include once again becoming a Buddhist monk with 
the UBCV and performing religious activities as assigned.  When 
questioned, he did not clearly differentiate between religious 
activities as a monk and activities related to advancing religious 
freedom in Vietnam. 
 
12. (U) Begin suggested press guidance (to supplement EAP Press 
Guidance dated March 16, 2004): 
 
Q. Can you confirm that Mr. Pham Van Tuong (aka Thich Tri Luc) has 
met with officials at the U.S. Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh 
City? 
A. Mr. Pham Van Tuong, formerly known as Thich Tri Luc when he was 
a monk with the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam 
(UBCV), was released from prison in Ho Chi Minh City on March 26, 
after finishing a 20-month sentence imposed by the Vietnamese 
Government.  Consulate General officials invited him to the 
Consulate General for a meeting on March 30, which he openly 
accepted. 
 
Q. Can you provide any details on the meeting, or discuss progress 
on his pending refugee case? 
A. Mr. Tuong spoke with officials of the U.S Consulate General in 
Ho Chi Minh City in confidence regarding his current situation and 
the Consulate will continue to keep in contact with him.  He does 
not appear to be under any restrictions or surveillance at the 
moment.  I would refer you to UNHCR for any details on his pending 
refugee case. 
 
Background:  Former UBCV monk Thich Tri Luc was allegedly 
kidnapped by Cambodian and Vietnamese police in July 2002 in Phnom 
Penh, and forcibly repatriated to Vietnam to stand trial for 
\"fleeing abroad to oppose the State\" (Article 91).  Imprisoned 
since July 2002, he finally stood trial on March 12, 2004, and was 
sentenced to 20 months, which with time served resulted in his 
release on March 26, 2004.  The Vietnamese Government claimed that 
they did not know the former monk had been granted refugee status 
by the UNHCR in Phnom Penh in June 2002, nor did they have any 
idea of his whereabouts.  The former monk\'s case has been raised 
by Human Rights Watch and the International Buddhist Information 
Bureau. 
 
End suggested press guidance. 
 
13. (SBU) Post Note:  Based on what Tuong himself said and after 
reviewing several documents that he left with ConGenoffs, it 
appears there were several instances where his case could have 
taken a turn for the worse -- but didn\'t.  First, the penalty for 
a violation of Article 91 is normally three years to life 
imprisonment.  Instead, it appears the security officials and 
Tuong were able to reach an accommodation that satisfied both and 
resulted in a 20-month sentence with time served.  Tuong could 
also have been charged with espionage -- defined by the GVN as 
providing national security information to foreigners in exchange 
for money -- as in the cases of the so-called \"Internet 
activists,\" but he wasn\'t.  Second, since nobody actually knew 
where Tuong was being held during 2002-2003, it would have been 
easy for him to \"be disappeared.\"  Third, a reading of the 
documents Tuong supplied indicates that GVN authorities played by 
the rules in obtaining legal extensions for the investigation 
period and for the trial postponements.  Tuong himself said that 
he was kept informed of the twists and turns of his case in a 
timely manner.  Fourth, the prison officials made accommodations 
for Tuong, as a prisoner who had no family to provide additional 
funds for food or other items.  This brief glimpse into Vietnam\'s 
dysfunctional legal system indicates that while the GVN fails on 
the fundamental principles of religious freedom and due process, 
there are times when it makes the \"right\" decisions within the 
twisted parameters of its own rules.  End Note. 
 
14. (SBU) Comment:  Tuong was relaxed and talkative during the 
meeting, but quite thoughtful at the same time.  He seemed 
genuinely pleased to be on American soil -- his \"dream for the 
past 18 years\" -- and offered what seemed to be sincere 
condolences on the tragic events of September 11.  He also 
appeared to be genuinely convinced by Major Lap\'s account of 
American POW/MIAs, and surprised that others might try to trade 
such information for money or immigrant visas to the U.S.  At the 
same time, Tuong seemed to exhibit a certain naivete, as when he 
discussed the report he had just prepared for the IBIB\'s Vo Van 
Ai.  When he mentioned that he was trying to find a secure means 
to mail the report, ConGenoffs drew his attention to the warning 
he had received upon his release from prison.  Tuong\'s \"solution\" 
was simply to email the document, since he could make up any 
address he wanted and the GVN would never know he was the source. 
He did not seem to comprehend that if the only two eyewitnesses to 
particular events were the Vietnamese police and him, then it 
would be easy to figure out who sent the email.  He also stopped 
momentarily during his discussion of prison conditions, when he 
suddenly realized he had pledged not to mention that topic after 
his release. 
 
15. (SBU) Tuong is clearly a sympathetic figure who has paid his 
dues.  Born in Hue in 1954, he became a novice at 10 years of age 
to then-UBCV Patriarch Thich Don Hau at Linh Mu Pagoda.  He has a 
long history of arrests and imprisonment for his beliefs, 
including a sentence of two years reeducation in 1981 for 
\"illegally leaving the country\", and 10 months house arrest in 
1992 for his efforts to promote religious freedom.

SUBJECT: REPORTS OF HOUSE CHURCH CLOSINGS, BEATINGS, AND 
PROTESTANT HARRASSMENT IN KON TUM AND QUANG NGAI PROVINCES 
 
REF:  A) 03 HCMC 0450  B) 03 HCMC 0833 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Three new Protestant contacts, introduced by a 
trusted HCMC-based source, shared information on several recent 
incidents in Kon Tum and Quang Ngai provinces with Poloff in two 
meetings in HCMC on March 31.  At the first meeting, two lay 
pastors provided firsthand accounts of house church closings and 
beatings in Kon Tum.  Later that evening, an ethnic minority 
pastor from Quang Ngai gave Poloff secondhand reports of the more 
generalized harassment faced by his followers.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Protestant lay pastor Nguyen Khac Xuan (protect), an 
ethnic majority Kinh Vietnamese, told Poloff that he was attacked 
on March 24, 2004 at 8:40 p.m., while returning home on his 
motorbike after a prayer meeting at his Dak Kum house church in 
Kon Tum City.  As he neared his home, a man wearing a mask blinded 
him with a flashlight, and then attacked him with a stick, beating 
him on both arms and one leg.  Another man tried to attack Mr. 
Xuan\'s wife, who began screaming loudly.  Mr. Xuan fled the scene 
and managed to evade his attackers.  He reported the attack to the 
local police, who told him the attackers were probably just trying 
to steal his motorbike.  Even one week after the alleged attack, 
Poloff was able to observe noticeable bruise marks and fresh scabs 
on both arms and his right leg. 
 
3. (SBU) Mr. Xuan also reported that on March 14, 2004, local 
police interrupted services at his Dien Binh house church in Dak 
To District, Kon Tum.  One week earlier, Mr. Xuan had baptized 14 
new converts at the church.  The police seized their Bibles and 
other worship materials, and made a record of all the items taken. 
The police then brought Mr. Xuan, his wife, and the house\'s owner 
to the district police station, and informed them that Protestants 
were not recognized in Kon Tum.  On March 19, police again 
summoned Mr. Xuan to the district police station.  A Major Tran 
Duc Long and other police officers then took him back to Dien 
Binh, and tore down Christian banners hanging inside the house. 
According to Mr. Xuan, the police forced him to admit to 
committing two offenses -- assembling a large group together and 
organizing illegal worship.  He was fined 1.5 million Vietnamese 
dong (about US$100) and warned that he would face larger fines and 
possible imprisonment if he continued these activities.  Major 
Long also reportedly threatened Mr. Xuan that local Christians, 
many of whom do not have household ownership books, would be 
kicked out of their homes if they continued to worship. 
 
4. (SBU) Mr. Nguyen Ksor Lai (protect), a Ja Rai (Gia Rai) ethnic 
minority Protestant lay pastor, told Poloff he was summoned to the 
district police office in Sa Thay District, Kon Tum on March 8, 
2004, and ordered to sign a document saying he would stop 
gathering Protestants together in his village.  Three elderly 
followers had apparently been threatened with imprisonment and 
pressured into revealing him as their pastor.  Mr. Lai stated that 
his church attracts almost 100 worshippers every Sunday.  When Mr. 
Lai refused to sign the police document, he claimed police beat 
him on his chest and sides until he fell down.  He also reported 
that police tried to force him to renounce his faith, and admit 
that he had lied in a letter he sent to the government in 2003, 
alleging physical abuse and violations of religious freedom.  Mr. 
Lai and three of his church leaders were brought back to the 
police station on March 10, where they were again ordered to sign 
the document promising to cease worship services in the village. 
When they refused, Mr. Lai claimed they were all beaten.  He said 
this happened a third time, on March 11, with three different 
followers.  One member of this last group, Mr. Ksor It (protect), 
was told to stand next to a statue of Ho Chi Minh, where police 
asked him: \"Who do you believe in, Jesus Christ or Uncle Ho?\" 
When Mr. It answered, \"Jesus,\" police allegedly beat him until his 
leg bled.  Mr. Lai told Poloff that all seven Protestants had 
finally agreed to sign a document agreeing not to meet, although 
they planned to continue meeting anyway.  He said that nobody 
signed a renunciation.  On March 15, Mr. Lai\'s wife was called to 
the police station, where police told her to sign a document 
renouncing her faith.  She refused, and sat waiting in the police 
station with no food or water for several hours until she fainted. 
 
5. (SBU) Pastor Dinh Tan Vinh (protect), an ethnic Hre Protestant 
who claimed to lead 101 house churches with 5,800 believers in 
Quang Ngai Province, told Poloff of several incidents involving 
his followers in Son Tay District, Quang Ngai.  In late 2003, 
local authorities reportedly kicked Mr. Dinh Van Hoang (protect) 
out of his village near Son Tinh, burning down his house and 
forcing him to move to another district.  In early 2004, police 
allegedly slaughtered the livestock of three new Protestant 
families in the same village and forced them to engage in \"idol 
worship.\"  (Note: According to Pastor Vinh, \"idol worship\" 
includes the traditional animist ceremonies of the Hre people.) 
On March 20, 2004, the adults from two of these families were 
ordered to report to the district police station, where they were 
allegedly told to renounce their faith.  They were then ordered to 
work in the police garden for five days and fined 400,000 
Vietnamese dong (about US$25) per couple.  Mr. Dinh Van Tru 
(protect), a lay religious worker, apparently heard of their 
detention and walked 40 kilometers to check up on them.  Within an 
hour of his arrival, he was allegedly detained by local police 
chief Dinh Van Hanh, fined 100,000 Vietnamese dong (about 
US$6.50), and beaten by four police officers for four hours.  Mr. 
Tru then \"escaped\" into the jungle and managed to walk the 40 
kilometers back home that same day, where Pastor Vinh said one of 
Mr. Tru\'s eyes was swollen shut from the beating.  Pastor Vinh 
repeatedly accused Mr. Cao Trung Tin, Communist Party chief of Son 
Tay District, of having directed these incidents.  Pastor Vinh 
alleged to Poloff that Mr. Tin has ordered local authorities to 
remove all Christians from his district, by any means necessary. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment: These new allegations are troubling, if true, 
but not terribly surprising in the context of Protestant 
activities in Kon Tum Province.  ConGenoffs have traveled to Kon 
Tum several times over the past year (reftels), and find the 
provincial leadership there to be either ill-informed or almost 
completely out of step with GVN policies on religion, especially 
with regard to Protestants.  In fact, the statements by the local 
police that Protestants are still not recognized matches what we 
have heard directly from the chairmen of the Kon Tum Provincial 
People\'s Committee and Committee on Religious Affairs on previous 
trips. 
 
7. (SBU) These three Protestants were brought to HCMC by one of 
our most trusted contacts, in direct response to our continued 
requests for meetings with firsthand sources.  Of the three, Mr. 
Xuan provided the clearest and most concise account.  Mr. Lai\'s 
account tended to go off track a bit, but still demonstrated 
firsthand knowledge.  Both men asked that the USG not/not raise 
their cases with GVN officials unless and until church leaders in 
Vietnam had decided to go public with their stories.  Our local 
contact said that his organization was planning to release a 
report over the Internet on at least the Dien Binh incident. 
 
8. (SBU) Pastor Vinh\'s story, on the other hand, was inconsistent 
and filled with the sort of accusations and unconfirmed 
allegations typical of second and third hand accounts.  Many of 
his claims were based on things he had merely \"heard.\"  Pastor 
Vinh offered nothing to substantiate his claims that these 
incidents were directed by the local Communist chief -- just that 
he had \"heard\" this story.

SUBJECT: IN VIETNAM, THE GOVERNMENT IS MICROSOFT\'S FIRST TARGET 
 
Summary 
------- 
1.  (U) With a software piracy rate estimated at 95 percent by the 
Business Software Alliance, there is no shortage of targets in 
Vietnam for IPR protection efforts.  Microsoft executives tell 
ConGen that it will focus on getting the GVN and multi-national 
corporations to use licensed software.  Microsoft is worried about 
the interest in Linux-based systems, fearing that because it is 
more difficult to use, offices that officially switch to Linux 
will soon unofficially switch back to pirated Microsoft software. 
 
Target the Big Targets 
---------------------- 
2.  (U) At a recent meeting with Econoff and Econ FSN, Microsoft\'s 
Director for Business Development Asia-Pacific Emerging Markets 
Mr. Faycal Bouchlaghem and Vietnam Country Director Mr. Ngo Phuc 
Cuong described the situation in Vietnam from their company\'s 
perspective.  Despite the prevalence of vendors selling pirated 
copies of Windows and other MS software from countless shops, 
Microsoft has decided to focus first on getting the GVN and second 
on multinational firms operating in Vietnam to use licensed 
Microsoft software.  Their target is to switch the GVN over 
completely to licensed product over the next five years. 
Microsoft told Econoff that, like the rest of the market, the GVN 
currently uses very little licensed software and that many 
multinational firms that are law abiding elsewhere start using 
pirated software after a few months in Vietnam. 
 
Windows Costs Money 
------------------- 
3.  (U) Microsoft describes two main difficulties in moving the 
GVN from pirated to licensed software.   First is Microsoft\'s lack 
of pricing flexibility.  MS claims that they are constrained from 
offering deeply discounted pricing for the Vietnam or any other 
market by a `Consent Decree\' agreement with U.S. Department of 
Justice.  They say that the decree would allow MS to develop and 
sell a new Vietnamese Windows product, and if it was substantially 
different from the existing versions, they could sell this special 
version for any price they chose.  Microsoft\'s representatives 
said that this was not viable, however, since the Vietnamese 
market would not offer enough of a return on the investment needed 
to develop such products.  They said that the company can, 
however, discount software to existing customers.  But these 
customers will still have to pay for it. 
 
Linux is Cheaper 
-------------------- 
4.  (U) The promise (false according to MS) of cheap or even free 
Linux-based software is another issue.  MS outlined several 
reasons why, in their admittedly biased view, Windows was a better 
choice.  First, the average user is used to Windows-based point 
and click software and retraining them to another system will be 
difficult.  Second, Linux systems require more technical expertise 
on the part of the end user than do Windows systems.  Finally, 
there would be a massive compatibility problem -- most of the 
world uses Windows, and the GVN could find themselves in a 
position where it might be difficult to communicate and share data 
between their Linux systems and everyone else\'s MS systems, not to 
mention the relative shortage of third-party software that runs on 
anything other than Windows. 
 
Copying Thailand 
---------------- 
5.  (U) Microsoft claims that these factors will inevitably lead 
to one outcome.  They contend, based on their own analysis using a 
post-purchase survey of commercial Linux users in Thailand, that 
within a few months of a shift to Linux, almost every GVN computer 
will also be running pirated Windows software.  They claim using 
Linux will be a hassle no one will put up with for very long.  In 
the Thai survey cited by MS over 70 percent of consumers that 
acquired Linux operating systems were back to using illegal 
Windows software within a few months. 
 
Other Efforts 
------------- 
6.  (U) Though the GVN and multinationals remain the focus, MS 
also works with the Economic Police by offering them training on 
how to detect pirated products in the retail market. Microsoft 
agreed to let Econ FSNs attend the next training session.  This 
opportunity should allow ConGen to expand its contacts within the 
Economic Police and help us better target our assistance on IPR 
issues. 
 
7.  (SBU) The firm is still trying to figure out the best way to 
work with local law enforcement.  Like many observers Microsoft 
has been critical of the GVN\'s effort to protect IPR and was 
surprised in a recent meeting when the Economic Police asked MS to 
\"identify targets\" for enforcement raids.  Microsoft elected not 
to give any names.  They explained that they do not want to set a 
precedent by doing the government\'s job when it does not take much 
detective work to find an IPR violator.  Nor do they wish to have 
MS linked to police action in the minds of consumers.  They do not 
want Vietnamese to think police raids and fines when they think 
Microsoft.  Microsoft\'s country director told Econoff that a few 
high-profile raids against small shopkeepers would not/not help 
Microsoft\'s long term business plan in Vietnam. 
 
8.  (U) Though wary of the stick, MS has been trying to use the 
carrot to change behavior.  The company\'s Vietnam offices recently 
began the \"Clean Shop Program.\"  This program asks retailers of 
software and assemblers of PCs to sign a pledge to provide 
customers with only licensed software.  In return, program members 
are rewarded with points for every licensed copy sold.   Points 
can be redeemed for merchandise in a system not much different 
from a frequent flyer or shopper program.  Thus far, the \"Clean 
Shop Program\" has had limited success.  In an investigation of 
program members, MS found that over 30 percent of the shops and 
factories -- all of whom volunteered for the program -- were still 
distributing unlicensed software. 
 
9.  (SBU) Microsoft\'s efforts to influence the local IPR situation 
extend beyond enforcement and rewards programs.   On March 16, 
2004 the software manufacturer signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) with the Information Technology Project 
Management Office (ITPMO) of the Ho Chi Minh City People\'s 
Committee.  This MOU, five pages in length, was drafted to ensure, 
\"mutual business cooperation,\" and, \"establish a formal basis for 
cooperation in the area of Information and Communication 
Technology.\"  Under the terms of the MOU, Microsoft will, 
\"contribute to the social and economic development of Ho Chi Minh 
City by developing the local IT ecosystem by building skills 
through IT training for ICT companies, students, teachers and 
government ICT professional employees based on common projects, so 
as to help create employment opportunities in HCMC.\"  Microsoft 
also agrees to help develop HCMC\'s e-government projects and work 
with the city government to agree on software licensing terms 
under the Microsoft Volume Licensing Program.  Finally, Microsoft 
will set up courses to teach educators and students about ICT, as 
well as seminars, \"as appropriate for the target audience,\" on the 
value of IPR protection and enforcement.  In return, the HCMC 
People\'s Committee, through the ITPMO, agrees to \"co-operate with 
Microsoft in order to ensure that the Ho Chi Minh City People\'s 
Committee\'s government institutions lead by example in using only 
licensed software and adopt the best practices for IPR protection 
and for the enforcement of IPR protection through the relevant 
Government Institutions.\" (NOTE: Full text of MOU to follow by 
SEPTEL) 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
10.  (SBU) While the MOU is certainly a positive development, in 
that it increases dialogue and highlights the importance foreign 
companies place on IPR matters, it is an agreement without teeth. 
The MOU does not give either side legal leverage, nor are the 
stated goals and responsibilities binding.  Life can go on as 
usual.  If either party finds that an obligation must go 
unfulfilled for reasons beyond their \"reasonable\" control, they 
are automatically relieved of the obligation as long as they 
inform the other signatory in writing.  The MOU is a nice vision 
of the future, but it lacks an actionable plan. 
 
11.  (SBU) For now it appears that the world\'s software giant is 
more worried about competition from \"shareware\" than it is about 
pirates.  Microsoft\'s arguments that Linux may not be a good fit 
for Vietnam clearly stem from self-interest, but they have a 
point.  In a country where government offices are filled with 
computers running pirated software, it seems unlikely that a 
lasting improvement will take root if the new system is any more 
difficult to use than the familiar, albeit illegal, alternative. 
And it will be hard to take real enforcement actions in the South, 
when the government itself is one of the biggest violators.

SUBJECT: A KINDERGARTEN FOR CAN GIO:  THE U.S. NAVY CONNECTS WITH 
THE \"HAVE NOTS\" IN RURAL HO CHI MINH CITY 
 
REF:  A) 03 HCMC 1144 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1. (SBU) On March 14, 2004, Consul General participated in a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony to open a kindergarten built with the 
assistance of the U.S. Navy and funding from a U.S. NGO.  Ground 
was first broken on this project back in November 2003, during a 
port call to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) by the USS Vandegrift, the 
first U.S. Navy ship to visit Vietnam since the war.  As one of 
three community relations projects (comrels) carried out by 
crewmembers during this historic visit, the foundation-digging for 
the two-room schoolhouse in Can Gio proved a valuable experience 
for participants on both sides.  However, USG participation in 
even clearly beneficial projects can sometimes be more complicated 
than expected, as local authorities remain cautious in their 
dealings with the USG. 
 
PART OF HCMC, BUT OH SO DIFFERENT 
--------------------------------- 
 
2. (U) Although administratively part of Ho Chi Minh City, the 
rural district of Can Gio remains a land apart.  Located south of 
the city\'s urban center and on the opposite side of the Nha Be 
River, it bears no resemblance to most of HCMC.  Nor is it 
particularly close to downtown.  A trip to Can Gio from central 
HCMC entails a drive of at least one hour, plus a ferry crossing. 
Traveling to the most distant part of the district, bordering the 
South China Sea, can take well over two hours.  In this somewhat 
forgotten corner of HCMC, crowded streets, busy factories, and 
noises give way to a handful of empty roads flanked by coconut 
groves, mangrove swamp, rivers, and shrimp farms.  Visitors have a 
difficult time deciding if the area is made up of water dotted 
with a multitude of islands, or land dotted with a multitude of 
lakes and rivers. 
 
3. (U) On the whole Can Gio is poor and there are limited 
opportunities for the district\'s 62,000 inhabitants -- short of 
commuting into the city for work.  The soil is salt-infused and 
unsuited to rice cultivation.  Similarly, the vast tracts of 
mangrove swamp do not lend themselves to other forms of 
agriculture.  In recent years, the local economy has received a 
bit of a  boost with the introduction of commercial shrimp 
farming.  Shrimp ponds dot the landscape and the most common 
vehicles on the roads are refrigerated seafood trucks hauling away 
the harvest.  This new economic prospect has meant jobs for 
residents and rising incomes (though from a low base).  Locals 
hope to capitalize on Can Gio\'s natural resources by attracting 
ecotourists to a nature reserve and mini-biosphere.  The clearing 
of forest and filling of mangrove swamp in the ongoing effort to 
build a multi-lane highway through the district may, however, 
underscore some basic misconceptions about ecotourism.  As the new 
highway is served only by a small car ferry service, it may also 
illustrate some weaknesses in infrastructure planning. 
 
THEY CAME, THEY SAW, THEY DUG 
----------------------------- 
 
4. (U) As in other poor areas of HCMC, providing educational 
opportunities for children in Can Gio is a challenge for local 
authorities.  In Doi Lau Hamlet -- a few patches of dry land 
crowned by houses in a sea of shrimp ponds -- there was previously 
no separate kindergarten.  The lack of classroom space at the 
local elementary school meant that kindergarteners were mixed with 
older students.  With permission from local authorities, Vietnam 
Assistance for the Handicapped-Health and Education Volunteers 
(VNAH-HealthEd) produced a plan to construct a two-room 
kindergarten on the grounds of Doi Lau\'s elementary school.  The 
school was to be built by local construction companies, but funded 
entirely by VNAH.  When news of the USS Vandegrift\'s upcoming 
visit became public, American citizen Ca Van Tran, VNAH\'s 
president, was one of the individuals the Consulate General 
approached for comrel ideas.  He suggested that USN personnel 
participate in the groundbreaking and help dig the foundation for 
the new kindergarten. 
 
5. (U) USN participation was envisioned as a way to save money on 
construction costs, allowing VNAH to use the funds for other 
projects.  It also presented an opportunity to bring American 
military to a rarely visited part of Vietnam to help break down 
barriers of mistrust, and offered crewmembers a chance to see 
something of the country beyond HCMC\'s downtown business and 
tourist areas. 
 
6. (U) During the ship visit, many USS Vandegrift crew members 
volunteered for three planned comrels.  (The other two projects 
involved painting portions of a school for street children and 
distributing supplies donated through Operation Handclasp to a 
city orphanage.)  Early on November 20, 2003, a group of 
approximately 30 crew members ventured out to Can Gio District, 
where they broke ground for the new kindergarten in tiny Doi Lau 
Hamlet.  Ground-breaking on the kindergarten went smoothly.  The 
DCM, Consul General, and DATT accompanied the USN contingent to 
Can Gio.  On site, the CG offered remarks in Vietnamese on the 
importance of education to a gathering of local officials and 
students.  Local officialdom appeared pleased with the remarks and 
the kindergarteners were clearly awestruck by the strangers in 
their midst.  The USS Vandegrift crew pitched into digging the 
foundation after a short dedication ceremony.  Their energy seemed 
to unnerve their Vietnamese hosts, who became clearly agitated at 
the sight of 30 Westerners sweating profusely as they wrestled 
with the fifty-fifty combination of earth and water that seems to 
make up Can Gio.  Afraid that heatstroke or other calamity was 
only a few shovel loads away, local officials began calling for a 
lunch break at 10:15 in the morning.  The American volunteers kept 
at it for at least another hour until the foundation was well 
started.  Then victory was declared and all participants settled 
down for a lunch of Can Gio delicacies, namely shrimp and crab. 
Lunch was followed by a second, shorter, work period, after which 
the sailors loaded up in their vans and departed for their liberty- 
call downtown. 
 
LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL 
----------------------- 
 
7. (U) On March 16, 2004, the new kindergarten opened its doors 
with a ribbon cutting by the CG and the director of Can Gio\'s 
education department.  The director openly acknowledged the work 
of the Vandegrift\'s crew and the support of VNAH in his remarks. 
It was clear from conversations with the teachers and district 
officials that everyone remembered the Navy\'s contribution.   The 
school\'s new occupants, in their finest school uniforms, filed 
into the classrooms at the conclusion of the ceremony, looking 
ready to undertake the daily rigors of kindergarten.  The students 
did not begin their time in the new schoolhouse empty-handed. 
VNAH and ConGen personnel also donated several boxes of toys and 
school supplies for the new facility. 
 
8. (U) This collaboration by an American NGO, the U.S. Navy, the 
Consulate General, and Can Gio officials was precedent-setting in 
Can Gio.  Many of the local officials involved had never dealt 
with Americans before.  The positive and tangible contribution 
made in November and reinforced at the school opening clearly made 
an impression on the local residents.  Americans came to Can Gio 
and they helped -- with money from the NGO and labor from the 
sailors.  Just as importantly, they spent a day with rural 
residents of Vietnam -- sharing food, joking, and working 
together. 
 
COMMENT: NOT AS EASY AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) There were other lessons in this experience as well. 
Building a kindergarten should not be controversial or 
\"politically\" dangerous, but the days leading up to the ground- 
breaking and the ribbon-cutting were filled with mixed messages. 
District officials moved very slowly to approve \"public\" American 
involvement and were uncommunicative about their plans.  They 
insisted on specific approval from the HCMC External Relations 
Office (ERO - the MFA branch office for southern Vietnam) at every 
step of the planning.  ConGenoffs, FSNs, and NGO staff were 
constantly on the phones or in meetings trying to smooth the way 
for the project.  Some of the local reticence can be chalked up to 
inexperience and fear of the unknown.  Americans haven\'t been 
around Can Gio much since the war, when the area was a site of 
significant guerilla activity.  Outside of official meetings, 
however, Can Gio district officials were much more positive.  They 
were friendly, talkative, and grateful for assistance from the USN 
and ConGen.  VNAH contacts attributed this strange dual behavior 
by district officials to admonishments from the HCMC government 
\"not to get too close to the Americans or appear too eager.\" 
 
10. (SBU) ConGen appreciates the goodwill and efforts of the USS 
Vandegrift in helping VNAH build a kindergarten in Can Gio.  They 
did good work and left a positive impression.  As a learning 
experience for the ConGen, this comrel project showed that our 
counterparts at the city level may insist on calling the shots to 
a greater extent than they let on -- and are wary of any local 
body developing its own relationship with the ConGen.

REF:  HANOI 962 
 
1. (SBU) The Consulate General has received credible reports of 
ethnic unrest in the Central Highlands Province of Dak Lak. 
According to several reliable second-hand sources, groups of 
ethnic Ede began moving into the provincial capital of Buon Me 
Thuot early on the morning of Saturday, April 10.  Some sources 
reported that these ethnic minority persons were armed with guns 
and targeting government facilities.  Other sources stated that 
they were carrying only rocks and stoning policemen and government 
vehicles.  A ConGen FSN returning to Ho Chi Minh City from a trip 
to Buon Me Thuot Saturday morning confirmed that police and 
soldiers had established roadblocks at points along the main road 
connecting Dak Lak with HCMC.  While he was not prevented from 
traveling in the direction of HCMC, he noted that all vehicles 
traveling in the other direction were being stopped.  ConGen FSN 
also observed large numbers of ethnic minority persons gathered 
along the roadside.  A contact with sources in Buon Me Thuot City 
said that police were stopping all ethnic minority persons from 
entering the city. 
 
2. (SBU) Late on April 9, the U.S.-based Montagnard Foundation 
released a press statement indicating that \"nonviolent 
demonstrations\" were scheduled to begin on April 10 \"all across\" 
the Central Highlands in protest of GVN restrictions on \"freedom 
to worship Christ.\"  ConGen and Embassy officers had been 
scheduled to travel to the region April 10-14 to observe Easter 
services and hold official meetings (reftel).  The HCMC External 
Relations Office (the southern branch office of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs) contacted ConGenoff on the morning of April 10, 
informing him that \"the Central Highlands are closed to all 
foreigners\" and that all scheduled official meetings in the 
provinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum -- which had been 
confirmed the evening before -- were now canceled for \"security 
reasons.\"  ConGen FSN contacted telephone centers in the towns of 
Pleiku, in Gia Lai province, and Kon Tum, in Kon Tum province, 
where operators indicated there were no current disturbances. 
 
3. (SBU) Mission has released a warden message advising Amcits to 
defer travel to the province of Dak Lak.  Mission officers have 
alerted the Operations Center, and continue to monitor the 
situation.  Poloffs will attempt to travel overland to Dak Lak to 
assess the situation first-hand.

SUBJECT: MONTAGNARDS PROTEST IN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OVER EASTER 
WEEKEND 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0391  B) HANOI 1007 C) HCMC 0147 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  ConGen HCMC has spoken with numerous sources in 
Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands regarding reports of 
violence during demonstrations by ethnic minority residents 
(\"Montagnards\") of Dak Lak and Gia Lai provinces.  The 
demonstrations began early on the morning of Saturday, April 10 
(refs A and B), one day after the U.S.-based Montagnard Foundation 
(MFI) issued a press release declaring that 150,000 Montagnards 
would undertake nonviolent protests throughout the Central 
Highlands over the Easter weekend against the GVN\'s \"denial of 
their freedom to worship Christ\" and \"ongoing repression against 
the Montagnards.\"  Absent intervention by the international 
community, the release warned, the GVN\'s \"repression against the 
Montagnards will be cruel and bloody.\"  While no individual ConGen 
source has been able to offer an overall estimate of the number of 
Montagnards involved in the protests, the numbers they report seem 
much lower than figures cited by MFI.  Accounts relayed by 
reliable ConGen sources also suggest the protests may have been 
confined to limited areas.  According to religious leaders in 
HCMC, Dak Lak, and Gia Lai, the unrest over the weekend had \"no\" 
effect on Easter celebrations, which went forward as planned in 
both government recognized and unregistered Protestant churches. 
Most of Post\'s Protestant contacts claimed the protests had very 
little to do with religion, and much more to do with land disputes 
and economic disparities.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) A house church pastor, who had just arrived in HCMC from 
Gia Lai on Monday morning, told Poloff that most of the 
demonstrations in his area had been confined to Dak Doa District, 
which stretches approximately 15-60 kilometers from the provincial 
capital of Pleiku.  He said that Saturday morning had been quiet 
near his home, until reports began to trickle in from neighboring 
Dak Lak early in the day.  Traveling to one of his churches 
approximately seven kilometers from Dak Doa around noon, he noted 
sizeable numbers of police and military units setting up razor 
wire to guard the roads into Pleiku.  For most of that afternoon, 
he observed two military helicopters circling overhead, as 
ambulances raced back and forth between Dak Doa and the city. 
Police contacts told him that reinforcements were being sent in 
from Binh Dinh Province to control the spread of the protests. 
(One of ConGen\'s Protestant sources in HCMC noted that 1000 riot 
police had been flown to Pleiku and Buon Ma Thuot from HCMC as 
well.)  He had heard reports of 50-60 injured in Dak Doa, but had 
no idea how many of those were police and how many were villagers, 
or how many Montagnards were involved overall.  The pastor had 
departed Pleiku at about 6:30 p.m. on Sunday.  He claimed to have 
had no problem leaving the city, since the roadblocks ran only in 
the opposite direction.  As of the time he departed Gia Lai, he 
was aware of no problems faced by recognized or unrecognized 
Protestant churches in his province. 
 
3. (SBU) The pastor\'s brother-in-law, who lives in Dak Lak, told 
the pastor on Saturday that police there were apparently aware of 
the planned protests by Montagnards over the weekend and had 
prepared themselves to contain the protesters in their own 
villages.  They had also established roadblocks to divert cars to 
Nha Trang and Quy Nhon, on the Central coast.  He said his friends 
on the police force told him that they had expected most of the 
villagers to enter the city via National Highway 14 (connecting 
HCMC to the south with Gia Lai and Kon Tum to the north), and had 
been caught off guard when groups of ethnic minorities appeared 
within a kilometer of the city limits via other routes.  The 
brother-in-law attempted to travel to Pleiku Saturday morning.  He 
was unable to reach Pleiku, normally a four- to five-hour trip, 
until late in the evening.  After arriving in Pleiku, he told the 
pastor that there were signs of conflict at various points along 
the way, including abandoned tractors, piles of stones, and some 
bloodied garments.  As far as all of ConGen\'s contacts were aware, 
ethnic minority protesters employed only stones in Dak Lak 
Province, although primitive slingshots were used to increase 
their effectiveness.  The pastor heard rumors of possible small 
arms in Dak Doa, but had no definitive information. 
 
4. (SBU) The sister of one prominent HCMC pastor with nationwide 
contacts reported from Buon Ma Thuot that perhaps a thousand 
ethnic minority males had been detained in makeshift camps outside 
the city.  Females were apparently not detained.  She said that 
police had stopped most of the protesters before they ever reached 
Buon Ma Thuot, shooting the wheels of the converted tractors often 
used as transportation in this part of Vietnam.  Most of the 
protesters appeared to be from rural villages well outside of the 
provincial capital.  She had apparently also heard that police 
were under orders to refrain from using guns to quell the 
disturbances.  She told her brother that she knew for sure that at 
least two police had died near Buon Ma Thuot, largely because they 
were forced to engage the protesters with only clubs at such close 
range.  She and other sources said that the police were fighting 
the protesters in street clothes, so that it would look as if the 
clashes were between ethnic minority villagers and their ethnic 
majority Kinh Vietnamese neighbors, rather than with the 
government.  While the sister decided not to return home to Cu 
Mgar (just north of the provincial capital) on Saturday, she was 
able to attend her normal Protestant house church service there on 
Sunday.  At least one pastor in Buon Ma Thuot reported via a HCMC 
contact that several of his relatives had been detained in Cu Mgar 
in the aftermath of the protests, but it was unclear exactly why, 
or whether they were still in detention. 
 
5. (SBU) Anecdotal evidence from business contacts in the region 
confirmed that the disturbances, while very real and in some cases 
very violent, did not seem to have spread very widely.  Asked 
about the prospects of bringing a group of foreign tourists to the 
Central Highlands in the next few days, a government-owned tour 
operator in Gia Lai said Monday that the most serious incidents 
had occurred in Dak Lak, although even those were over by Saturday 
night.  Much more limited protests had taken place in Gia Lai, 
while Kon Tum had been completely quiet.  The tour company 
representative said these protests were much more muted than those 
in 2001, and that the government was much better prepared this 
time around.  She blamed the protests on the growing gap between 
rich and poor, noting that most of the protesters had been caught 
trying to break into stores to loot food.  An employee at one of 
the ConGen\'s favorite restaurants in Buon Ma Thuot noted that the 
protests lasted less than a day, and were mostly confined to a 
single ward of the city.  While other groups had tried to come to 
the city from rural villagers, they were all stopped by the police 
in their villages, or en route.  He thought there had been very 
little real violence, and was ready to book a table.  A 
businessman with factory interests in Gia Lai was aware of the 
protests, but thought the government was being much smarter than 
in 2001, and was looking for ways to avoid direct confrontation. 
He said that local officials had told business owners that they 
were responsible for defending their own premises from protesting 
Montagnards.  The businessman had heard stories about one unarmed 
official being killed by a group of ethnic minority villagers in a 
remote part of the province, but was unable to estimate the extent 
of the protests, the level of violence, or the number of 
casualties. 
 
6. (SBU) Pastors from both government recognized and unregistered 
churches blamed the unrest in the Central Highlands on Kok Ksor 
and his Dega followers in Vietnam, with one going so far as to 
say, \"Kok Ksor controls everything.\"  While they were not sure 
whether or not Dega organizers had recently crossed the border 
from Cambodia to incite the mostly-poor ethnic minority villagers, 
many contacts had heard rumors that protesters were offered US$50 
(up to four months earnings or more in the poorer parts of the 
Central Highlands) to participate, although the money had yet to 
be paid.  One reliable Protestant house church source with good 
contacts in the Central Highlands told Poloff that many of the Ede 
leaders who had returned from Cambodia after the 2001 uprisings 
had told the villagers they could earn money just by fleeing to 
Cambodia.  They also promised resettlement in the U.S.  Those 
stories carried great currency in the economically underdeveloped 
ethnic minority villages, the contact said.  According to his 
sources in the Central Highlands, Dega organizers had recently 
contacted many of the villages to tell the residents that if they 
\"made a lot of noise\" they would be allowed to resettle in the 
U.S.  While Post\'s sources uniformly agreed that the Montagnards 
had valid reasons to protest -- particularly related to 
confiscation of tribal lands and what the Montagnards viewed as 
ethnic discrimination in health care, education, and economic 
opportunity -- they felt the protests had very little to do with 
religious persecution. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  It is interesting to note that many ConGen 
sources came to the same conclusion independently of one another: 
namely, that the government was much better prepared to deal with 
ethnic protests this time around than in 2001.  There also 
appeared to be a consensus of opinion that the police had 
generally attempted to exercise restraint in quelling the 
protests, at least by their standards.  A striking point that 
emerged from Poloff\'s conversations with religious contacts, 
however, was that the protests seemed to have no impact on the 
ability of both government recognized and unrecognized Protestant 
house churches -- or Catholic churches, for that matter -- to 
conduct services on Saturday and Easter Sunday.  According to most 
of these sources, the protests, confined to relatively limited 
areas to begin with, were over by Saturday in Dak Lak and by 
Sunday in Pleiku.  Pushed for estimates, their numbers of ethnic 
minority villagers involved ranged in the thousands, not the tens 
or hundreds of thousands reported by MFI. 
 
8. (SBU) Comment (cont.):  Almost none of Post\'s well-connected 
sources knew that anything out of the ordinary was going on in 
those first few hours when fights were purportedly raging 
throughout Dak Lak and Gia Lai.  In fact, the first many of them 
heard that there were potential problems in the Central Highlands 
was when Poloff called them for information.  When they followed 
up with their local church leaders at Poloff\'s request, they often 
found that even pastors in Buon Ma Thuot and Pleiku were 
completely unaware of the protests.  One HCMC-based contact, who 
used to live in Buon Ma Thuot, chalked this up to the very limited 
contact between urban and rural residents in the Central 
Highlands, and noted that peoples\' awareness often extends only as 
far as their own immediate living area.  This is consistent with 
ConGenoffs\' own experiences during provincial trips, when we are 
often confounded by local villagers who don\'t even recognize the 
name of the very next village only a few kilometers away.  Poloff 
was also surprised to learn how much his HCMC contacts seemed to 
be relying on the Internet for information on these events, since 
their own large networks of religious workers in the provinces 
were not aware of any disturbances.  Those contacts attributed 
this to the lack of affiliation between the Dega communities and 
their own Protestant congregations. 
 
9. (SBU) Comment (cont.):  All of this makes it extremely 
difficult to determine the accuracy of the many conflicting 
accounts of these protests.  ConGen will continue to follow up 
with contacts and seek direct access to the affected areas.  Even 
so, it will likely take time to clarify what really happened in 
the Central Highlands over Easter, and what effect, if any, it 
will have on the process of \"normalization\" (ref C) of 
unregistered Protestant churches there.

REF:  A) HCMC 0391  B) HANOI 1007  C) HCMC 0401 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Mr. Le Hung Quoc, Senior Deputy Director of the 
Ho Chi Minh City External Relations Office (ERO), downplayed 
reports of widespread protests and high casualty numbers in the 
Central Highlands (refs A and B) during a meeting with Acting 
Consul General on April 13, assuring her that the situation was 
now \"stable.\"  A/CG utilized the meeting to underscore U.S. 
interest in the peaceful resolution of the current ethnic unrest 
in Dak Lak and Gia Lai provinces, and to stress the importance of 
obtaining both access and accurate information.  ConGen and 
Embassy Poloffs were forced to postpone a planned trip to the 
Central Highlands on April 10, after violence reportedly broke out 
during demonstrations by ethnic minority persons (\"Montagnards\") 
in the two provinces.  The ConGen submitted a diplomatic note to 
ERO (the southern branch office of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs) on April 12 to formalize verbal requests for ERO to 
facilitate a trip to the Central Highlands at the earliest 
opportunity.  Mr. Quoc told A/CG he hoped ConGenoffs would be able 
to travel to the region soon.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Mr. Quoc told A/CG that the situation in the Central 
Highlands was now stable, and that foreign tourists were free to 
\"resume normal activities.\"  He said he had asked the provincial 
administrations in Dak Lak, Gia Lai, and Kon Tum to once again 
prepare to receive a ConGen delegation as soon as possible.  He 
thought it likely that ConGenoffs would be able to travel there 
soon.  He also assured A/CG that the GVN was not trying to hide 
anything from the international community or the USG.  The issue 
for the GVN was to be sure that it was providing accurate 
information.  He rejected reports of demonstrations involving 
150,000 Montagnards as \"completely unrealistic,\" but commented 
that many people had been out on the streets to attend Easter 
services.  As far as he was aware, there had been no deaths or 
serious injuries; however, he asked for more time to sort out the 
details, given the difficulties in communicating with remote 
communes and districts over a wide area.  He insisted he was 
unable to provide any specific numbers for detentions, deaths, or 
injuries, saying only that some demonstrators had attacked police 
and been arrested.  He cautioned A/CG to ignore rampant 
misinformation, citing as examples rumors he had heard (and 
dismissed) that foreign aircraft would be airlifting Montagnards 
from the Central Highlands to a sanctuary overseas, or that 
foreign delegations would soon arrive in the region to spirit the 
protestors away.  In this context, he offered to try to provide 
information on specific claims regarding deaths or detentions 
purportedly resulting from the protests.  (Note:  While he seemed 
sincere, ERO has not always been successful in verifying 
information regarding sensitive cases in the past.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) Mr. Quoc blamed \"extremist elements\" for using Easter as 
a pretext to \"create social unrest.\"  He also cited reports that 
the demonstrations may have been \"instigated from outside\" of 
Vietnam, tying in recent allegations by Cambodian officials that 
UNHCR was \"luring\" Montagnards across the border from Vietnam. 
Under the circumstances, he said, the government had an obligation 
to stop the demonstrations and preserve public order and 
stability.  He blamed general conditions of poverty for leaving 
the ethnic minorities susceptible to promises of a better life 
overseas, and said the first obligation of the GVN with regard to 
human rights was to improve access to education, health care, and 
economic opportunity. 
 
4. (SBU) Acting Consul General noted her disappointment that the 
GVN had postponed the joint ConGen/Embassy reporting trip to the 
Central Highlands planned for April 10-14 (ref C).  Expressing 
concern over unconfirmed reports of large-scale protests that had 
allegedly turned violent over the weekend, A/CG emphasized the 
importance of immediate and reliable information to avoid the 
spread of unsubstantiated rumors.  She also urged the GVN to grant 
immediate access to the region; to permit ConGenoffs to speak 
freely with officials and ordinary residents in the affected 
areas; and to assess the extent of the reported ethnic minority 
unrest firsthand.  Speaking more generally, A/CG noted the role 
that freedom of speech and assembly serve in democratic societies 
as outlets for disenfranchised elements of the population. 
Reiterating the USG\'s respect for the national sovereignty of 
Vietnam, she urged the GVN to limit their investigation and not 
turn this into a broader inquisition. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  ERO does not always have the latest information 
about the Central Highlands and ConGen is still trying to obtain 
better information about the protests.  Mr. Quoc\'s description of 
events, while quite general, seemed to be more in line with 
impressions provided by ConGen sources (reftels) than with the 
initial stream of reports suggesting that the protests were much 
more widespread and violent.  Many press reports today also seemed 
to have scaled back significantly on the numbers.  ERO has worked 
very hard to assist the ConGen in gaining access to the Central 
Highlands in the past, and Mr. Quoc didn\'t seem to harbor any 
grudges over the attempt by ConGen and Embassy Poloffs to continue 
with their previously scheduled trip last Saturday.  Even if we do 
get access, however, we would still expect it to be very difficult 
to sort things out on the ground.

RESETTLEMENT 
 
 
Sensitive but unclassified.  Please handle accordingly. 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary.  PRM Deputy Assistant Secretary Kelly Ryan 
held technical talks in Hanoi with a delegation of GVN officials 
to discuss the Humanitarian Resettlement (HR) program, a USG 
proposal to accept applications for persons meeting certain 
category eligibility under the orderly departure program.  The 
talks resulted in a signed Minutes of Meeting in which both sides 
agreed to the general principles which will guide the 
implementation of this program, including both public outreach and 
the identification and processing of qualified applicants.  The 
USG delegation agreed to prepare three documents:  a proposed 
draft of the initial program announcement; a detailed description 
of the overall public outreach strategy to publicize the program; 
and a paper on areas of cooperation between the two governments 
for the actual processing of applicants.  DAS Ryan also visited Ho 
Chi Minh City.  She met with RRS staff and the Office of External 
Relations (ERO).  She also met with Sister Pascale Le Thi Triu, a 
long-time advocate on behalf of Vietnamese in the Philippines, to 
inform her of the impending USG announcement of a resettlement 
program for this group.  End summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  A delegation led by PRM DAS Kelly Ryan, along with 
DHS/CIS Chief of the Refugee and Asylum Law Division Molly Groom 
and Charge d\'Affaires Robert Porter, met March 29-30 with a GVN 
delegation headed by MFA Director General of the Consular Division 
Mr. Bui Dinh Dinh.  The purpose of the talks was to reach 
agreement on the technical aspects of implementing the proposed re- 
opening of certain Orderly Departure Program (ODP) categories for 
a limited period for those persons who through no fault of their 
own had failed to apply prior to previous application deadlines. 
DAS Ryan\'s visit was a follow-up to the visit of PRM Assistant 
Secretary Gene Dewey in August 2003, during which the GVN agreed 
 
SIPDIS 
in principle to the re-opening 
 
HUMANITARIAN RESETTLEMENT TALKS 
 
3.  (SBU)  In advance of this visit, GVN officials had stressed 
they wanted any such re-opening to be cast as a humanitarian 
rather than a \"refugee\" resettlement program.  They also expressed 
concern that any such program would be disruptive to Vietnamese 
society, would raise false hopes and expectations, and generally 
went against perceptions that any persons still eligible for the 
former ODP programs were now well integrated into Vietnamese 
society.  These remained key themes throughout the talks, which 
were generally cordial in tone.  After questioning whether the 
program was really necessary, Dinh indicated the GVN could accept 
the general outline of the proposed program, including an initial 
public outreach campaign, followed by the application and 
processing of all persons found to be eligible applicants.   The 
GVN stressed that the nature of the program should be humanitarian 
in nature and advertised as such.  They stated there were many 
specific questions and concerns to be addressed.  While the GVN 
was willing to permit a broad public outreach campaign, they 
emphasized this could be very disruptive to Vietnamese society and 
would falsely raise hopes and expectations of gaining admission to 
the program among a large number of ineligible people. 
 
4.  (SBU)  PRM DAS Ryan thanked Mr. Dinh for the GVN\'s willingness 
to cooperate in this effort.  She acknowledged GVN concerns about 
how the program would be implemented and indicated a desire to 
minimize any potentially negative effect the program may have on 
Vietnamese society.  She explained the details of the Humanitarian 
Resettlement program proposal.  She emphasized that the USG goal 
is to provide a finite, time-limited opportunity for those people 
who would qualify for certain of the original ODP categories, but 
had not had an opportunity to apply previously.  She stated that 
this would not be a new program and remains focused on persons 
with pre-1975 ties to the U.S. 
 
5. (SBU)  During a free exchange of ideas, both sides agreed in 
principle to design a simple, streamlined process based on 
fairness and transparency.    The GVN emphasized they now have a 
policy of permitting open, lawful migration and that all citizens 
are now generally entitled to a passport if they have not 
disobeyed the law.  The USG explained its basic proposal of a six- 
month public outreach campaign followed by a two-year application 
period.  Both sides agreed on the importance of conducting this 
information campaign in a manner that stresses its humanitarian 
nature and seeks to minimize false expectations, potential 
exploitation and fraud.  The USG also emphasized the need for the 
US to be able to control the screening and eligibility and stated 
that we would seek assistance from the GVN on particular cases. 
(Note: we would do so in cases in which the GVN would have the 
sole or most accurate information.) 
6.  (SBU)  The second day focused on wording in the draft Minutes 
and revealed the intensity of GVN concerns that the introduction 
of this program and the public outreach campaign will have a 
disruptive effect on Vietnamese society, as well as lead to 
criticism (unwarranted in their view) of current GVN policies. 
They cited negative scenarios based on past experience with USG 
refugee programs in Vietnam, claiming that many potential 
applicants will resign their jobs, leave school, sell property, 
etc. on the expectation of resettlement, and that at the end of 
all this disruption, the USG will approve a relatively small 
percentage of applicants.  They also indicated a high level of 
sensitivity, voicing concern the program will be used as 
propaganda against the GVN by those outside the country who still 
oppose them. 
 
7.  (SBU)  To deal with some of these sensitivities, the GVN did 
not accept the term \"Humanitarian Resettlement Program (HRP)\" 
because the word \"program\" implied too large a scope.  It was 
agreed to call it \"Humanitarian Resettlement (HR).\"  The GVN also 
expressed concern that six months was too long for the public 
outreach program, but finally agreed on \"up to six months.\"  The 
most contentious language dealt with how to address GVN concerns 
the program would be used by unfriendly groups outside of Vietnam 
to criticize current policies.  In the end, they accepted:  \"Both 
sides agree that HR processing is not related in any way to 
current conditions in Vietnam, and does not suggest that persons 
applying for HR are experiencing any difficulties with their 
government.\"  The GVN then asked the U.S. side to prepare three 
documents:  a draft of the initial HR announcement; a description 
of the ways and means to implement the public information 
outreach; and a paper outlining mechanisms for implementing the 
program, including areas of cooperation between the two 
governments. 
 
RESETTLEMENT OF VIETNAMESE FROM THE PHILIPPINES 
 
8.  (SBU)  During the negotiations for opening the Humanitarian 
Resettlement process, DAS Ryan also informed the GVN of plans for 
opening a resettlement program in the Philippines for Vietnamese 
\"long-stayers\" there.  She pointed to this program as a further 
example of the USG efforts to settle some of the long-standing 
refugee issues that still exist in Southeast Asia.  Mr. Dinh said 
this effort was welcomed by the GVN, adding that any program that 
helped to resolve the plight of such individuals was useful to our 
mutual interest in settling the past issues that lay between our 
two countries. 
 
9.  (SBU)  While in Ho Chi Minh City on April 1, DAS Ryan also met 
with Sister Pascale Le Thi Triu, a Vietnamese nun who has been 
very active in assisting the Philippines \"long-stayers\", and who 
has advocated permanent residency for many of them in the 
Philippines.  There was some concern that because of this past 
advocacy, Sister Pascale might not welcome the resettlement 
program.  But in the course of their conversation, she indicated 
to DAS Ryan a belief that any such effort to help provide the 
Vietnamese \"long-stayers\" with a durable solution, whether in the 
Philippines or in the U.S., was to be welcomed, and she thanked 
DAS Ryan for her efforts in helping to resolve this very long- 
standing and difficult issue. 
 
COMMENT 
 
10.  (SBU)  The Mission believes that DAS Ryan\'s visit to Vietnam 
was productive.  The GVN has consistently indicated it is willing 
to work with the USG on permitting the re-opening of a limited 
program based on former ODP refugee categories.  At the same time, 
they have stressed that circumstances in Vietnam are now very 
different than they were even a decade ago, and that the concept 
of resettling \"refugees\" from Vietnam is outdated.  They are also 
very concerned about how the program will be perceived.  As a 
result of these sensitivities, we would expect a tough negotiation 
over the details of implementation.  However, we believe we should 
take advantage of the agreement DAS Ryan reached with the GVN in 
principle and move forward quickly to provide the requested 
information and press for another round of technical talks.  We 
hope that GVN concerns can be overcome and that the next round 
will result in a final agreement on the structure of HR and, if 
possible, permission to proceed with the initial phases of the 
public outreach information campaign.  End comment.

SUBJECT: HCMC ERO BRIEFS FOREIGN DIPLOMATS ON THE CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0391  B) HCMC 0401  C) Hanoi 1113  D) HCMC 0406 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  In a briefing for the Consular Corps on April 
20, Director Le Quoc Hung of the Ho Chi Minh City External 
Relations Office (ERO -- the southern branch office of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs) blamed \"extremist elements\" inside 
and outside of Vietnam for demonstrations that turned violent on 
April 10-11 in the Central Highlands provinces of Dak Lak and Gia 
Lai (refs A and B).  Mr. Hung assured the Consular Corps that the 
ERO would work to arrange visits to the area after the People\'s 
Council elections were held on April 25.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Mr. Hung opened the briefing by acknowledging that \"some 
incidents\" had occurred in Dak Lak and Gia Lai, as well as in one 
small part of the new province of Dak Nong, which was spun off 
from Dak Lak late last year.  He accused \"extremist elements\" of 
\"inciting, threatening, and forcing\" some ethnic minority 
residents in the Central Highlands (\"Montagnards\") to take part in 
violent demonstrations.  According to Mr. Hung, the protesters 
attacked commune offices and \"kidnapped\" local officials, damaging 
property and causing injuries to both officials and ordinary 
residents in the process.  Despite the violent nature of the 
protests, he said, security forces had used maximum restraint in 
their efforts to quell the disturbances. 
 
3. (SBU) Mr. Hung cited casualty figures of 60-70 injured, most of 
them not seriously, and two dead, one from a sharp object thrown 
by another protester and one from an overturned tractor.  Mr. Hung 
stressed that those numbers were far below the \"exaggerated\" 
reports of Montagnard Foundation, Inc. (MFI) and other groups in 
the U.S.  While Mr. Hung admitted that hundreds had been arrested 
in the course of restoring public order, he affirmed that only the 
ringleaders and those who committed specific criminal acts were 
still being detained.  He said that government officials had even 
provided the rest of the demonstrators with transportation back 
home.  Approximately 200 tractors used by the protesters had also 
been impounded, but would be returned to any owners who had merely 
been deceived into participating in the demonstrations.  Mr. Hung 
told a questioner later that he was not sure which ethnic groups 
had taken part, although he thought there had probably been many 
Ede and Bahnar.  He was also unable to offer any specific numbers 
on possible refugee flows across the long border with Cambodia. 
 
4. (SBU) Responding to a question later in the briefing, Mr. Hung 
acknowledged that the GVN had advance notice of the demonstrations 
and referred to a press release before the event by MFI.  What the 
GVN had not known for sure was exactly where and when the protests 
would take place.  He said local officials had been surprised by 
the methods employed by the protesters -- particularly the use of 
tractors -- and the ferocity of the attacks.  While it would have 
been easy to put down the protests by force, given the ample 
military assets in these strategic border provinces, he said the 
GVN did not want to harm the majority of participants who had been 
innocently \"duped\" into joining the protests.  Knowing that the 
organizers were hoping for a harsh response, the GVN had accepted 
higher casualties among the military and police by choosing to 
exercise restraint. 
 
5. (SBU) Tying MFI and other foreign groups directly to the 
protests, Mr. Hung noted the unlikelihood that similar 
demonstrations could have occurred at roughly the same time across 
a wide geographic area, without \"collusion\" between internal and 
external forces.  For those who doubted foreign involvement, Mr. 
Hung pointed to MFI\'s press release of Friday, April 9, which 
announced the pending demonstrations and called on the 
international community to send observers.  According to Mr. Hung, 
this showed that the protests were merely a pretext for gaining 
international attention.  The real goals of the organizers were to 
tarnish the image of Vietnam, particularly in the eyes of 
international organizations and aid donors, and create social 
disunity at home.  That plan included encouraging people to cross 
the border to Cambodia illegally. 
 
6. (SBU) Mr. Hung stressed that the Central Highlands were now 
open to foreign tourists, although local authorities were still 
dealing with the aftermath of the destruction and looting.  When 
Acting Consul General followed up on the access issue during the 
question and answer period, Mr. Hung modified his comments 
somewhat, saying that while tourists were free to travel, 
journalists and diplomats should recognize the sensitivities 
involved and make sure their visits were handled through official 
channels.  While diplomats were always free to travel as tourists, 
that meant limiting themselves to guided tours and not \"poking 
around\" and talking to people in the affected areas.  He said ERO 
would do its best to arrange official visits as soon as the 
People\'s Council elections were over on April 25. 
 
7. (SBU) When A/CG raised the general issue of visits by 
journalists and others, Mr. Hung announced that the ERO would send 
a diplomatic note to ConGen HCMC on Wednesday inviting a 
delegation to visit after the elections (note: the dip note had 
not arrived as of Thursday evening).  Noting that he wished 
foreign diplomats had been there to see the violent acts committed 
by the \"terrorists,\" Mr. Hung said the GVN had decided to restrict 
such travel because it feared a visit by foreigners might 
encourage extremist elements.  He added quite bluntly that ERO 
really had difficulty persuading local officials to accept 
American and other foreign delegations, especially in the Central 
Highlands.  He excused this, saying that local officials needed to 
expend a great deal of time and energy to arrange good trips and 
were easily drained by frequent visits. 
 
8. (SBU) Director Hung ended his formal briefing by noting that 
some press agencies had carried false stories blaming the GVN for 
oppressing the Montagnards.  On the contrary, he said, the GVN was 
committed to improving the material and spiritual life of the 
ethnic minority groups, although their standard of living and 
educational level remained low, especially in the Central 
Highlands.  Noting that some protesters had carried banners 
blaming the ethnic majority Kinh Vietnamese for appropriating 
their land, Mr. Hung attributed the problem to ethnic minority 
migrants from the north.  At the same time, he acknowledged that 
better land management was needed everywhere in Vietnam, not just 
the Central Highlands. 
 
9. (SBU) According to Mr. Hung, the real motivations of the 
protesters were quite different.  He claimed that debriefed 
protesters had told authorities they were deceived into 
demonstrating in Buon Ma Thuot by promises that UNHCR planes would 
come to their rescue and take them out of the country.  Other 
rumors promised UNHCR would pay US$5,000 to any refugees they 
resettled.  Asked by a member of the consular corps why the GVN 
hadn\'t simply tried to explain the situation to the Montagnards 
before the rumors spread, Mr. Hung noted that the authorities were 
not close enough to the people they serve.  He also said it takes 
time to change people\'s thinking, something the GVN had been 
trying to do with the Montagnards since the unrest of 2001.  To 
make his point, he noted that the GVN had been pushing a family 
planning policy to improve the lives of the ethnic minorities. 
Unfortunately, Kok Ksor had twisted that policy to convince the 
ethnic minorities that the GVN was really using the policy to 
eliminate their culture. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment:  The ERO did not cover any new ground after the 
previous day\'s MFA briefing in Hanoi (ref C), but the question and 
answer session was more extensive than expected, lasting over an 
hour.  And this briefing was certainly more enlightening than a 
private meeting at ERO a week earlier (ref D).  In a brief 
statement as the Dean of the Consular Corps, the French CG noted 
that this was the first such briefing on a sensitive matter he had 
been asked to attend in his four years here.  On the margins of 
the meeting, several foreign diplomats commented that while it was 
difficult to overcome the GVN\'s often defensive tone, their 
sources seemed to confirm the broad general outlines of the 
demonstrations presented during the briefing.  They agreed, 
however, that it is extremely difficult to get a full and accurate 
picture of events without open access to the Central Highlands.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANTS CRITICIZE MFI ROLE IN CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
DEMONSTRATIONS 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0401  B) HCMC 0507  C) HANOI 1113 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Despite continued assertions from Human Rights 
Watch, the Transnational Radical Party, Montagnard Foundation, 
Inc. (MFI) and various other groups that police and military units 
brutally beat, raped, killed and arrested ethnic minority 
demonstrators in the Central Highlands during Easter protests, 
ConGen HCMC has yet to hear any first-hand reports of excessive 
force by the GVN.  However, while Protestant leaders expressed 
anger over MFI\'s role in the demonstrations, they also gave 
credence to reports of police brutality.  As post has previously 
reported from extensive interviews with local contacts in HCMC 
(ref A), the reality at this point appears to lie somewhat closer 
to GVN claims of relatively small demonstrations and limited 
casualties (refs B and C).  Mission officers plan to travel to the 
region April 26-28, but even so it may be difficult to verify the 
details for some time.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) A well-known third-country source shared with ConGenoff 
reports he had received last week, which included claims of at 
least two dead and injuries in the tens.  While the numbers match 
those provided by the GVN (reftels), his sources attributed the 
two deaths to gunshots fired by government forces.  They reported 
approximately 15,000 protesters each in Dak Lak and Gia Lai 
provinces, but said the demonstrators were peaceful.  Many carried 
similar banners decrying land confiscations and interference in 
ethnic minority affairs.  The banners apparently did not specify 
whether they were directed at the GVN or ethnic majority Kinh. 
 
3. (SBU) Two other sources, Protestant pastors from the Central 
Highlands well known to ConGen and generally considered reliable, 
provided him with charts detailing the location of demonstrations. 
Their hand-drawn maps showed 13 flashpoints in Dak Lak, and 
another 17 in Gia Lai.  These include the districts of Cu M\'Gar, 
Krong Ana, and Krong Pak in Dak Lak; and Dak Doa, Chu Se, and 
Ayunpa in Gia Lai.  The number of protesters at most of these 
locations were said to have ranged between one and several 
thousand.  A written narrative that accompanied the Dak Lak map 
gave no precise casualty figures, but intimated a number of 
deaths, injuries, and arrests.  The two pastors were allegedly 
reluctant to meet with ConGenoffs during their weekend visit to 
HCMC, given the increased surveillance they believed was in place. 
As a result, ConGenoffs were unable to determine whether or not 
these two sources had actually witnessed any of the actions they 
described. 
 
4. (SBU) According to ConGen\'s third-country contact, these two 
pastors decried the involvement of Kok Ksor and MFI in organizing 
the protests.  They accused MFI of intentionally staging the 
demonstrations over Easter weekend to attract the greatest 
possible international attention, and were said to be \"terribly 
angry\" with MFI for the harm that had befallen so many \"innocent\" 
people in the Central Highlands.  They were certain that the 
protests had almost nothing to do with religion, estimating that 
fewer than ten percent of the protesters were Christian.  They 
said the demonstrators had been duped by promises of resettlement 
in the U.S.  Contrary to GVN claims, however, the two pastors were 
also said to have reported a harsh response by security forces 
armed with spiked clubs, chains, and other weapons.  They 
contradicted GVN statements that the demonstrations had ended on 
April 11, noting that the last of the fighting had not ended until 
the following Saturday, April 17.  However, they had been able to 
hold Easter services without interference and normal Sunday 
services the following week. 
 
5. (SBU) Aid project workers living in or near Buon Ma Thuot City 
in Dak Lak told a German diplomat the demonstrators there had been 
quite violent, but the police had mostly exercised restraint, at 
least initially.  While it was unclear how much these individuals 
had seen for themselves, they were certain that ethnic minority 
protesters had actually occupied the provincial People\'s Committee 
in the town for at least one night.  They also said the 
demonstrators indicated they were waiting to be taken to the U.S. 
Their estimates of the size of the demonstrations were closer to 
those of the pastors than MFI, but they had no sense of overall 
casualty figures, although they said they thought the number of 
deaths was nearer to two than twenty. 
 
6. (SBU) Comment:  ConGen and Embassy are now scheduled to travel 
to Dak Lak and Gia Lai provinces April 26-28.  While we are 
unlikely to have unfettered access to individuals who witnessed or 
participated in the demonstrations, we hope to get a clearer 
picture of what really happened.  Based on responsible sources 
that have reported both good and bad news about their situations 
vis a vis the GVN, we continue to believe that some organizations 
are making exaggerated claims about the size and extent of the 
demonstrations and the nature of the GVN\'s response.  Still, we do 
hear credible reports of police force resulting in limited deaths 
and injuries.  The latest reports from Human Rights Watch are 
slightly more measured than their earlier statements, and appear 
to be based almost entirely on our third-country contact (who has 
written for them in the past).  While at least some of his sources 
are good, we don\'t know how much of their information was based on 
first-hand observation.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH UBCV LEADER THICH HUYEN QUANG 
 
REF:  03 HCMC 1010 and previous 
 
1.(SBU)  Ambassador Burghardt called on the Most Venerable Thich 
Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam (UBCV), on April 28.  The meeting, which lasted over one 
hour, was held outside Quy Nhon at the Nguyen Thieu Pagoda, 
founded in 1948 by Thich Huyen Quang himself, where he is 
currently being held under virtual house arrest.  Binh Dinh 
Provincial authorities had previously agreed, after some 
negotiation, to the Ambassador\'s request for a private visit. 
Although local officials accompanied the Ambassador to the site, 
they did not attempt to join the meeting.  Thich Huyen Quang, who 
is 86, appeared in strong spirits, but seemed somewhat frail and 
weaker than when the Ambassador met him last year in Hanoi.  He 
was strong enough to rise and greet his visitors, and he walked 
them to the door when they departed.  The Ambassador was 
accompanied by Mrs. Burghardt, his daughter Helen, and HCMC 
Econoff. 
 
2.(SBU)  Thich Huyen Quang confirmed that he has been prevented 
from leaving the pagoda since the incident last October when he 
was stopped from traveling to Ho Chi Minh City with several other 
UBCV monks a few weeks after holding an \"unauthorized\" meeting of 
the UBCV leadership (Reftel).  He said one attempt to travel to 
nearby Quy Nhon City was thwarted by law enforcement officers 
stationed around the monastery who blocked his vehicle.  Although 
Thich Huyen Quang said he has not been given a reason for being 
restricted to his pagoda, he is aware that Vietnamese authorities 
claim he was found with \"secret documents\" when his vehicle was 
stopped in October.  He reported that a Deputy Minister of Public 
Security - which indicates the high level of attention being given 
to his case - called on him at the Pagoda and alleged that UBCV 
believers had passed him the \"secret documents.\"  Thich Huyen 
Quang said he had received two envelopes from believers - each 
with donations of VND 500,000 (about 33 usd).  He had checked the 
contents himself and only money was inside.  He had written to the 
Deputy Minister stating his case, but had not received a reply. 
He added, however, that all questioning and interrogations 
regarding this matter seemed to have stopped.  The Ambassador 
observed that no one outside Vietnam believed Thich Huyen Quang 
had possessed secret documents. 
 
3.(SBU)  In a somewhat surprising comment, Thich Huyen Quang told 
the Ambassador that it was \"not difficult\" to unify his dissident 
Buddhist organization with the government-approved Buddhist Church 
of Vietnam.  \"The majority\" were in favor of such a move, he said, 
but \"a small influential group\" did not wish this to happen.  When 
the Ambassador asked what kind of relationship the new 
organization would have with the GVN and the Fatherland Front, 
Thich Huyen Quang enigmatically stated that he did not know, since 
he did not know who would lead the organization.  Going further, 
he said neither the head of the Religious Affairs Commission in 
Hanoi nor the current leader of the government-approved Buddhists 
would be able to help him effect a merger.  He wished to travel 
once again to Hanoi to meet with the Prime Minister directly on 
this issue.  (Note: Without more details about how the merger 
would occur, it is difficult to tell if Thich Huyen Quang was 
speaking of an actual plan or a more theoretical possibility.) 
 
4.(SBU)  Commenting on his current situation, Thich Huyen Quang 
appeared comfortable and said he was teaching about a hundred 
students staying at the pagoda and another 200 students from 
elsewhere.  Several monks and novices tend to his needs, but all 
left the room during the meeting except for one assistant who 
remained throughout.  In a moving short monologue as the 
Ambassador prepared to leave, Thich Huyen Quang thanked the U.S. 
Government, Congress, and the people of the United States for 
helping him.  He said he was both \"surprised and moved that a 
faraway country understands what is going on here.\"  The 
Ambassador presented Thich Huyen Quang with a book of photographs 
of the United States and assured him that the book did not contain 
any \"secret documents,\" only \"pretty pictures.\"  The Ambassador 
expressed the hope that he would see Thich Huyen Quang in Hanoi 
before too long on a trip to meet with the Prime Minister and 
even, perhaps, one day in the U.S. 
 
5.(SBU)  The meeting was facilitated by the Binh Dinh Provincial 
authorities who, after some negotiation, agreed to a private visit 
between the Ambassador and the UBCV leader.  In a meeting with the 
Chairman of the Provincial People\'s Committee the day before, the 
Ambassador received a lengthy briefing detailing all of the 
boilerplate arguments that Vietnam traditionally makes on 
religious freedom issues.  The Chairman stressed that he had 
\"invited\" Thich Huyen Quang to return to his home province and 
that Binh Dinh tried to create positive conditions for the 
practice of religion.  This strong public display of towing the 
line, which the Chairman made before local journalists and all of 
his department heads, was probably designed to give him some 
political cover to facilitate a private meeting between the 
Ambassador and one of Vietnam\'s best known dissident religious 
leaders.

ETHNIC UNREST 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0401  B) HCMC 0510  C) Hanoi 1007  D) HCMC 0147 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Embassy and ConGen poloffs discovered more 
questions than answers concerning reports of recent ethnic unrest 
(refs A and B), during an April 26-27 trip through the Central 
Highlands province of Dak Lak.  While everyone from government 
officials to some of the protesters themselves acknowledged that 
the April 10 demonstrators used more violence than the Montagnard 
Foundation, Inc. (MFI) and other groups have admitted, it is still 
too early to gauge with any accuracy the overall level of violence 
on either side, the size of the demonstrations, or the numbers of 
dead, injured, and detained.  Official GVN statistics are still 
wildly at variance with the figures cited by MFI.  Also yet to be 
fully understood is the effectiveness of the GVN\'s response to the 
violence.  SECV pastors confirmed, however, that there have not 
been special restrictions on religious activities following the 
demonstrations.  At least some provincial leaders seemed convinced 
of a USG and UN role in the unrest, while local officials seemed 
surprised and unprepared for the level of anger they faced.  Even 
more so than usual, this trip was tightly controlled by local 
officials, making it extremely difficult for poloffs to speak 
freely with anyone.  Press coverage was heavy, with reports both 
on television and in the newspapers.  Septel will report on the 
visit to Gia Lai Province on April 27-28.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Dak Lak People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang 
condemned MFI founder Kok Ksor for \"deceiving, coercing, and 
forcing\" the demonstrators to participate in the demonstrations 
with promises of cash payments and resettlement in the U.S.  He 
also criticized the U.S. for \"harboring\" Kok Ksor, an action he 
deemed inconsistent with U.S. recognition of the GVN.  More 
troubling, however, was the way he sprinkled his commentary with 
wild conspiracy theories on the role of the U.S. and UN in 
fomenting the unrest, mentioning the previously planned visit by 
poloffs the same weekend as the demonstrations (ref C) and the 
\"coincidental\" presence of six UNESCO employees in the province at 
the same time.  He chided poloffs for disavowing advance knowledge 
of the protests, noting that the information was on MFI\'s own 
website.  (Note:  The Embassy has not heard this line from 
officials in Hanoi.) 
 
3. (SBU) To counter MFI\'s claims that the demonstrations were a 
\"peaceful prayer vigil,\" Chairman Lang played for poloffs an 
edited videotape showing a group of more than 100 Montagnards 
armed with primitive weapons hurling stones at the police.  (He 
said he would consider providing a copy of the videotape to 
ConGen.)  He told poloffs he had gone out to address this 
particular group of protesters that morning to try to convince 
them to return to their homes, but they had hurled stones at him 
as well, actually hitting him in the hip.  He also displayed a 
crude banner allegedly carried by one group of protesters.  The 
banner, written in English, called for the establishment of an 
independent Dega state led by Kok Ksor, and demanded that the 
majority ethnic Kinh Vietnamese leave the Central Highlands. 
 
4. (SBU) According to Chairman Lang, forty people were injured 
during the demonstrations in Dak Lak, including 16 police, but no 
one had died.  (He claimed to have visited all of the injured in 
the hospital -- police as well as protesters.)  He said \"more than 
10\" people had been detained for criminal activities, but others 
had probably gone into hiding.  He claimed that the protests, 
which lasted from early in the morning until midday, were confined 
to just three of the province\'s 13 administrative districts -- 
Krong Ana, Cu M\'Gar, and Buon Ma Thuot City. 
 
5. (SBU) In a separate meeting, the director of the largest 
hospital in Buon Ma Thuot told Poloffs his facility had treated 40 
patients with minor injuries on Saturday, April 10.  About 20 had 
arrived in roughly one group in the morning, with the remainder 
trickling in throughout the day.  Doctors at the hospital treated 
11 police officers, one of whom was seriously injured.  Some had 
been transferred to local clinics after a few days, others had 
been released sooner.  The hospital had also treated 22 
demonstrators and seven apparently innocent passers-by.  Most of 
the patients suffered injuries consistent with stones and other 
projectiles.  The badly injured policeman had been beaten over the 
head with sticks. 
 
6. (SBU) The People\'s Committee Chairmen in the districts of Krong 
Ana, Krong Pak, and Cu M\'Gar echoed many of Chairman Lang\'s 
accusations of U.S. complicity in the activities of the 
\"terrorist\" Kok Ksor, calling for his immediate extradition to 
Vietnam.  Like the provincial Chairman, they warned poloffs that 
many local people were very angry with the U.S. and might be 
hostile to the presence of American diplomats -- some because they 
thought the U.S. had stirred up the unrest, and others because the 
American planes had not come to take them away.  (Note:  Both 
official and other sources have said at least some protestors 
believed they were going to be transported for resettlement to the 
U.S.  End Note.)  The district Chairman in Krong Ana noted that 
the demonstrations in his district had been small in scale, 
involving no more than 2,000 \"gullible people\" who had fallen for 
promises of cash and resettlement.  The few injuries, all minor, 
had been the result of clashes among the ethnic minority 
protesters themselves.  He promised harsh punishment for the 
organizers, but clemency for everyone else.  The district Chairman 
in Krong Pak denied that any residents of his district were 
involved in the demonstrations. 
 
7. (SBU) The district Chairman in Cu M\'Gar said armed protesters 
had started attacking people and businesses in some of the 
communes in the district as early as 7:00 a.m. on Saturday.  He 
and other district officials had personally tried to persuade the 
protesters to return to their homes, when the protesters suddenly 
attacked the police.  The demonstrations were over by noon, with 
very few injuries on either side.  The Chairman had no information 
on detentions, but said some people had gone into hiding.  Police 
impounded approximately 100 tractors.  Some local people had 
reportedly been promised that if they made it to Buon Ma Thuot, 
the U.S. Ambassador or the UN would take them to America.  Others 
had allegedly been told that they needed to leave because the Kinh 
were going to kill them in their villages.  One ethnic Ede 
resident of Cu M\'Gar told poloffs he had seen a group of people 
passing through the village and decided to join them, without any 
clear idea of where they were going or what they were planning to 
do.  When police stopped his group, he fought alongside some of 
the other protesters.  After the protests, he said, he was held in 
detention for eight days. 
 
8. (SBU) Driving to Cu M\'Gar District, poloffs made an impromptu 
stop (but still with a large entourage) at a commercial area on 
the outskirts of Buon Ma Thuot, which turned out to be the 
location featured in Chairman Lang\'s videotape.  The local police 
chief did not seem to be expecting poloffs, but brought them to 
meet with several shop owners in the neighborhood.  Some recounted 
how they had fled immediately when they saw the protesters coming 
down the road throwing stones and attacking businesses.  Others 
claimed that local Kinh residents had engaged in violent clashes 
with the demonstrators after police had done nothing to stop the 
rampage.  When the police chief said the demonstrations had lasted 
just two hours, an elderly woman in the shop blurted out that it 
was really four. 
 
9. (SBU) The police chief claimed to have had \"at least one day\'s 
notice\" of the protests, but was not at all clear on what 
precautions he had taken.  Based on accounts from three injured 
police officers at a local clinic just down the road (including 
the officer who was seriously injured), police seem to have been 
overwhelmed by the size and intensity of the protests.  One 
injured traffic policeman said there were just three of them on 
the road with rubber batons that morning, trying to stop 200 
tractors.  Another described an attack on the local police 
station, where many windows were broken and plaster was chipped 
above the door.  While some officers had helmets and shields, 
others did not.  The chief said that most of the protesters had 
eventually listened to reason and dispersed, but some had to be 
dealt with using unspecified additional measures.  One police 
officer intimated that local people had helped to fight back the 
demonstrators.  Several local residents said the same thing, 
noting that property owners had been forced to take matters into 
their own hands because the police were not doing anything to stop 
the violence.  Speaking with local residents, it was obvious that 
some of the reports carried by MFI and other organizations were 
circulating in the community.  One individual clearly believed the 
claim that government forces had beheaded children.  Most seemed 
nervous and suspicious of government accounts.  However, police 
and residents alike denied that troops stationed at an army camp 
near the clinic had played any role in crowd control. 
 
10. (SBU) Several members (strictly protect) of the provincial 
representative board of the government recognized Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) also mentioned details 
similar to those reported by MFI, although it was unclear whether 
they had any particular basis for believing or disbelieving what 
they had heard.  Meeting poloffs in a restaurant with six local 
government officials sitting at the next table, the board members 
were circumspect in their comments, citing economic frustration as 
a major cause of the demonstrations and blaming \"ill intentioned 
people\" for inciting the violence.  They had heard reports that 
some of the protests were peaceful until police intervened, but 
others had been violent from the start.  While police had not used 
weapons against the protesters, many Kinh business owners and 
residents had.  Inevitably, some people had been injured and some 
detained, with perhaps four to five still in custody pending 
further investigation.  Others had fled into hiding.  The board 
members thought the demonstrations were larger than those in 2001, 
with many Christians participating, although the basis for this 
view was not clear.  They confirmed that there had been no 
restrictions on religious activities in the aftermath of the 
protests, however. 
 
11. (SBU) More generally, the pastors noted that they had just 
submitted a list of 50 preachers (one quarter of the total number 
for the province) for training at a new bible school (ref D), 
which was still under government consideration.  These 50 had 
studied in secret after the closure of the Nha Trang Seminary in 
1976, and the short-term training course was a way to regularize 
their status and make them acceptable to both the GVN and the 
SECV.  They said the government had promised to facilitate the 
construction of real church buildings for the five registered 
churches in the province.  Three already had permission to build, 
but were held back by a lack of funds.  The pastors remained 
resigned to the slow process of recognition, one church at a time. 
 
COMMENT 
XXXXXXX 
 
12. (SBU) While we may never have accurate numbers for those who 
participated in the demonstrations, or were injured, killed, or 
detained, this trip provided our first opportunity to view the 
terrain where the largest protests occurred, and to try to put 
together the various pieces of the puzzle.  Unfortunately, our 
caravan of seven escort vehicles carrying government officials, 
police, and at least a half dozen members of the press made truly 
open inquiry impossible, except for occasional brief encounters. 
From our Monday flight to Buon Ma Thuot, where poloffs and our two 
FSN assistants were given an extra degree of attention, to the 
scolding we received from a local official as we crossed the 
border to Gia Lai on Tuesday, our hosts tried to keep us to the 
program they had arranged.  With the exception of the impromptu 
stop on the outskirts of Buon Ma Thuot, they largely succeeded. 
When we tried to stop at a village in Krong Pak, we were blocked 
by a group of men in civilian clothes who knew that this village 
was not on our program.  When we drove down a side road en route 
to Gia Lai and were stopped by a police car that seemed to come 
out of nowhere, we were again told it was not on our program. 
When we stopped to talk to a local villager, a dozen young men 
materialized from the brush yelling at us in what appeared to be 
an ethnic minority language.  The GVN was also clearly looking at 
this as an important press opportunity, going so far as to print a 
full page article in one of the nation\'s highest circulation 
newspapers reporting on the meeting with Chairman Lang, even after 
poloff\'s had made it clear that journalists were not allowed in 
the meeting.  (Note:  Trips to the Central Highlands, when allowed 
at all, are often restricted in a similar manner, especially 
during periods of heightened tensions, although the number of 
\"escorts\" this time was higher than usual and the press coverage 
was significantly more.) 
 
13. (SBU) The only \"facts\" that seem to be established at this 
point are that at least some of the protests were violent, but 
they do not appear to have been extremely large or widespread. 
Other details will be harder to establish.  How high would the 
level of ethnic animosity and/or desire for any of the benefits 
reportedly promised need to be to drive ethnic minority villagers 
to this kind of violence?  Local officials really did seem 
surprised by the anger of the crowds, and their unwillingness to 
listen to reason.  The financial lure of social security and green 
cards appears to have played a role.  And how important a factor 
was religion?  Most reports from official and other sources focus 
on land and other economic issues as the main source of 
discontent, and religious practice seems to have been unaffected 
the very next day, but religion may well have been part of the 
mix, at least for some.  Answers to these questions will be slow 
in coming, along with a better understanding of how the protests 
were coordinated and organized.  It will also take time to sort 
out the details of the government\'s response.  If the casualty 
figures are as low as the GVN would have us believe, then 
restraint seems to have been the order of the day.  But if a 
stronger response was required to quell the disturbance, then 
higher figures could be closer to the real number.  And we do not 
know how many protestors are still in detention. 
 
14. (SBU) We did hear a number of recurring themes throughout the 
trip, such as claims of Montagnards clashing with other 
Montagnards, Montagnards clashing with Kinh, and police dressing 
in civilian clothes to make the clashes look like Montagnards 
against Kinh.  Other stories seemed more bizarre, like the 
accounts we heard from several officials in different districts 
that elderly, paralyzed people had been loaded on tractors and 
forced to join the protesters, later requiring treatment in the 
hospital.  In a country where the government is generally 
suspicious of the people and the people are often equally 
suspicious of their government, it is not surprising that both 
sides might be willing to believe the worst.  And in a region with 
poor communications and transportation infrastructure, rumors can 
easily become the coin of the realm.  Even with all of the 
restrictions, this was a useful trip.  Sadly, the suspicions 
voiced by the Dak Lak PC Chairman about USG and UN involvement are 
likely to be taken seriously among a large number of local and 
even some national GVN officials.  Mission will remind national 
leaders that they have a responsibility to dispel ridiculous 
conspiracy theories.

SUBJECT: SAME OLD IPR SONG IN VIETNAM -- BUT ARE THOSE SOME NEW 
LYRICS? 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  In stark contrast with Vietnam\'s usual indifference to IPR 
violations, press and public opinion have turned on a local 
composer who apparently plagiarized a song written by a Japanese 
composer.  After front-page play in the local press, the Musicians 
Association of Vietnam is mulling action and the government is 
considering tighter IPR regulations to cover such plagiarism. 
Nonetheless, there is still no legal recourse for the song\'s true 
composer. 
 
NOT JUST ANOTHER COPY 
--------------------- 
2.  Most Ho Chi Minh City consumers - as well as local law 
enforcement officials - are indifferent to the counterfeits and 
copies in their midst.  Venues for buying pirated DVDs, CDs, and 
VCDs number in the thousands, and range from tiny, decrepit 
storefronts to well-stocked counters in downtown shopping centers. 
Pirated discs are merely the tip of the iceberg.  Clothing of 
dubious origin, counterfeit motorcycle parts, knock-off medicine, 
and books hot off the photocopier abound. 
 
3.  All the more surprising then is the recent public condemnation 
of a Vietnamese composer, Bao Chan, who allegedly stole a melody 
from a Japanese composer and passed it off as his own.  Since the 
mid-1990s, a piece of music entitled \"Tinh Thoi Xot Xa\" (Love is 
No Longer Bitter) and \"composed by Bao Chan\", has been familiar to 
ietnamee audiences.  Its most famous version was  a 1996 release 
by Vietnamese pop star Lam Truong. 
 
4.  In early April, Vietnamese newspapers began running front-page 
stories detailing the claims of Japanese composer Keiko Matsui, 
who said \"Love is No Longer Bitter\" was musically identical to her 
song \"Frontier\", published in 1991.  \"Frontier\" had been used for 
a Super Mario Brothers/Nintendo game in 1991, and later released 
on Ms. Matsui\'s album \"Cherry Blossom\" in 1992.  Bao Chan 
countered that he wrote \"his\" song in the 1980s, but could not 
remember exactly when.  Nor could he produce the original draft. 
No one has come forward to vouch for the song\'s existence in 
Vietnam prior to the release date claimed by Keiko Matsui.  At 
last report, Bao Chan, who describes himself as disorganized, was 
searching his papers for an early version of \"Love is No Longer 
Bitter.\" 
 
CASE SEEMS TO HAVE STRUCK A CHORD 
--------------------------------- 
5.  The \"Ai Copy Ai\" (Who Has Copied Whom) controversy has 
generated intense public interest.  Major daily newspapers have 
published letters from Ms. Matsui and her producer, devoting 
significant space to the topic.  A letter to one  daily, Nguoi Lao 
Dong (The Worker), even described a mathematical analysis of the 
songs to determine the odds that they could be coincidentally 
similar.  The odds that two composers each wrote this particular 
song independently are 1 in 282,475,249 per single verse of music. 
Forget an entire song.  The same newspaper convened a panel of 
three highly-respected music professors to review the songs. 
Unfortunately for Bao Chan, the panel and the court of public 
opinion concluded he stole the music. 
 
NOTHING FOR THE TRUE COMPOSER 
----------------------------- 
6.  Vietnam is not yet a signatory to the Berne Convention, and 
Japan and Vietnam do not have bilateral agreements covering IPR. 
As Ms. Matsui\'s producer wrote to a local paper, \"If this had 
happened in the U.S., our management company and publishers would 
take it to court, (where) we could win easily.\"   Not in Vietnam, 
however.  The National Copyright Office has publicly stated that 
the case does not fall under their jurisdiction, presumably 
because Ms. Matsui never registered her song in Vietnam. 
 
GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE ACTION, BUT NOT MUCH 
---------------------------------------- 
7.  Still, the GVN or at least a government-sponsored organization 
may take some action.  Newspaper accounts and ConGen contacts 
familiar with the case have suggested that the Communist Party- 
controlled Musicians Association of Vietnam (whose membership 
includes most professional composers) would probably handle the 
case.  These contacts say the Association might demand Bao Chan 
publicly admit his guilt and apologize to the Japanese composer. 
The Association could also strip him of professional memberships. 
Whatever the sanctions, it appears that if his peers deem Bao Chan 
guilty, his career as a composer will be seriously damaged. 
 
8.  The GVN is also considering new legal sanctions against future 
offenders.  The Deputy Minister of Culture and Information (MOCI) 
has condemned \"creative\" piracy, and publicly stated that MOCI 
would unveil a new administrative penalty proposal this month. 
However, the head of MOCI\'s legal department told ConGen that this 
proposal, which would be vetted by the Ministry of Justice before 
going to the Prime Minister for approval, does not increase 
penalties for IPR violators above their current nominal levels. 
It simply expands the scope of current regulations to include 
categories such as Bao Chan\'s alleged music plagiarism. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
9.  The fact that a Vietnamese composer took credit for another\'s 
original work has offended local sensibilities far more than 
millions of copies of pirated Microsoft software.  Yet in a city 
where IPR violations are rampant, it is a positive sign that this 
case has drawn so much public attention and coverage in the 
government-controlled media -- particularly since the rights 
holder is a foreigner.  The move to expand the universe of 
punishable IPR violations is also encouraging, though the 
miniscule penalties are scant disincentive.  But it still leaves 
Ms. Matsui with no legal recourse in Vietnam.

SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS FREEDOM MAKES SLOW PROGRESS IN HUE 
 
REF:  A) Hanoi 916 B) HCMC 76 
 
Summary 
------------ 
 
1. (SBU) Both religious leaders and government officials in 
Thua Thien-Hue Province expressed a generally positive 
outlook on religious freedom during recent official 
meetings.  However, Embassy and Consulate General officers 
were prevented from making unannounced visits to dissident 
Buddhist and Catholic clerics by apparent police measures 
(ref A).  In discussions with both Catholic and Protestant 
leaders, Missionoffs noted a willingness to compromise with 
provincial officials in order to achieve specific goals. 
This seems to have yielded some positive results, although 
obstacles remain.  End Summary. 
 
Official View - No One Should Abuse Religious Freedom 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
---------- 
 
2. (SBU) Meeting with Hanoi poloff and HCMC conoff during 
their March 29-31 trip to Hue, Mr. Le Ba Hoang, Deputy 
Director of the provincial Committee on Religious Affairs 
(CRA) underscored freedom of religion guarantees under 
Article 17 of the Vietnamese Constitution.  But, he 
cautioned, no one has the right to abuse freedom of 
religion.  Mr. Hoang gave an overview of the scope and 
variety of believers in the province.  The largest group is 
the Buddhists, whose 550,000 believers comprise about half 
the population of the province.  A total of 1400 religious 
staff, including 764 monks and 162 nuns, administered some 
454 pagodas, although Hoang said his definition of pagoda 
included some very simple places of worship.  The Senior 
Buddhist Seminary in Hue -- opened in 1997 -- graduates 200 
students per class with the equivalent of a Bachelor of Arts 
in Buddhism, some of whom later go on to higher study 
overseas.  Moreover, the last ten years have seen four 
\"designation\" ceremonies, in which more than 400 members 
were selected to be trained for leadership roles within the 
Buddhist hierarchy. 
 
3.  (SBU) Responding to inquiries about Hue\'s most prominent 
activist monk -- Thich Thien Hanh, of the outlawed United 
Buddhist Church of Vietnam -- Hoang\'s stance was 
unequivocal.  Thich Thien Hanh had been a member of the 
provincial management board of Vietnam from 1981 until 1992, 
Hoang said, and his 1992 resignation was an \"internal 
Buddhist matter.\"  Since then, Thich Thien Hanh had been a 
\"subversive presence.\"  Hoang called the UBCV a \"splinter 
group, intending to spread propaganda against the 
government.\"  When asked if missionoffs might meet with 
Thich Thien Hanh, Mr. Hoang stated that we did not request 
to see him, and so it had not been arranged, but that in any 
case, \"seeing him would do no good for Buddhism.\"  When 
asked to clarify this, Mr. Hoang replied with a Vietnamese 
proverb: \"A monk without a robe is not a monk; a person with 
a robe might not be a monk.\" (Note:  Officers had attempted 
to meet with Thich Thien Hanh the day before, but were 
blocked by police action.  Generally speaking, Mission 
informs provincial authorities of meetings with GVN 
officials, but not of plans to meet with private individuals 
including religious leaders.  End Note.) 
 
4.  (U) The Catholic Church is comparatively small, with 
four dioceses ministering to 52,000 believers, according to 
Hoang.  There are 99 priests and 531 monks and nuns serving 
104 churches within the region.  Both Mr. Hoang and Hue 
Archbishop Nguyen Nhu The noted the Catholic Seminary in Hue 
-- reopened in 1994 -- trains priests to serve in 3 
provinces:  Thua Thien-Hue, Da Nang, and Kon Tum.  Hoang 
claimed that seminary staff alone decided who was to be 
admitted for study, but Archbishop The stated there was an 
unofficial government \"quota\" of 10 students for each area, 
leading to class sizes of 30 every other year.  Hoang 
claimed that the number of seminary students meets -- and 
would soon exceed -- the requirements for priests for the 
three provinces.  Archbishop The agreed that the need for 
parish priests would soon be met, but mused that his 
government counterpart did not understand that priests do 
not just perform rites and rituals, but are also vital to 
charitable and humanitarian activities.  He said the 
Catholic Church still hoped to increase the number of 
seminarians in order to expand Church operations in these 
other areas. 
 
5.  (SBU) Following up on a U.S. Commission on International 
Religious Freedom (USCIRF) delegation\'s attempted visit to 
activist priest Father Phan Van Loi in January (ref B), 
Missionoffs asked Hoang about meeting with Loi.  The request 
was met with mock confusion.  Hoang claimed never to have 
heard of any priest by that name.  When it was established 
that we did have the right to visit and speak with any 
private citizen, however, Mr. Hoang said that the CRA does 
not recognize Father Loi as a priest, but that nevertheless 
he would try to arrange an official visit if and when we 
returned to the region.  Archbishop The commented later 
that, as Loi had been ordained in Bac Ninh province, Father 
Loi was \"not affiliated with the diocese.\"  The status of 
Father Nguyen Van Ly raised more serious concerns.  Mr. 
Hoang said he wondered, \"who controlled him,\" as Ly was a 
\"threat to National Security\" for his outspoken comments. 
Hoang claimed that Ly\'s imprisonment had nothing to do with 
his religious actions, but was a result of Ly\'s having used 
the pulpit \"to lie about the government,\" and that he \"tried 
to turn his parishioners against the government.\"  He 
further claimed that the Catholic Church in Vietnam did not 
support Father Ly. 
 
Catholic and Protestant leaders cautiously optimistic 
--------------------------------------------- --------------- 
---- 
 
6. (SBU) Archbishop The gave a guardedly optimistic report 
about the Catholic Church\'s relationship with provincial 
authorities.  Ten years ago, he said, the situation was very 
difficult.  Now, \"the practice of religious belief and 
religious study\" are relatively unhindered.  In general, 
Archbishop The said, they have a \"cordial relationship\" with 
the authorities, who are \"becoming more cooperative.\" 
Problems remain, however, and he noted that \"religious 
associations\" -- for example women\'s and youth groups -- are 
still very restricted, and cannot meet and operate freely. 
He felt that bureaucracy and government red tape are the 
main obstacles to continuing improvement.  For example, a 
charitable clinic at Kim Long staffed by Catholic nuns has 
had problems in receiving drugs before their expiration 
date.  As they are generally donated just prior to this 
date, the delays in processing them through customs in 
Vietnam have led to whole shipments becoming unusable. 
Sister Nguyen Thi Dien, the director of the clinic, said she 
felt sure that there was no discrimination present in these 
delays, but that it was merely bureaucratic in nature. 
Archbishop The also noted that it took four years of 
consistent effort to receive approval to build a Catholic 
\"Service Center\" -- a conference and study center -- which 
was due to open very soon.  The inaugural event for the 
center would be a conference for the Episcopal Council of 
Catholics April 26-28. 
 
7. (SBU) Archbishop The did describe a number of outstanding 
disputes with the State over Church property.  In Thien An, 
107 hectares of Church land has apparently been seized, and 
is slated to be developed into an \"amusement center,\" most 
likely a water park.  Hoang of the CRA stated that, since 
the land was bought by the Church under the Diem regime, it 
is \"subject to redistribution.\"  Archbishop The said 
although this project is \"environmentally questionable,\" the 
chances that the Church will get that land back are very 
slim.  Archbishop The also talked about a church in Ke Sung, 
where a road is being built across parish land, very close 
to the front of the church building.  Hoang said that the 
road was a necessary project given the province\'s overall 
plan for infrastructure development, but added that because 
the church at Ke Sung would be affected by this project, it 
would receive \"preferential compensation\".  He noted that 
the church was not opposed to the road itself, but its 
concern revolved around safety issues, and the potential 
damage to the \"spiritual environment.\"  Speaking more 
broadly, Hoang likened the situation to the time period 
immediately following the American Revolution, saying that 
\"in order to bring about equality in society\" it was 
necessary to implement limited \"land reform.\" 
 
8. (SBU) Pastor Ma Phuc Hiep, of the government recognized 
Protestant Church in Hue, was largely positive in his 
comments.  He noted the Protestant Church is small in Hue, 
with only 380 believers, and said that strong Buddhist 
traditions in the region made it difficult to attract new 
converts.  He said that the CRA had been very fair, 
especially given the c\'s small numbers, and that Protestants 
have been able to pursue community outreach programs and 
some charitable work, although they would like to expand 
their charitable activities.  The Church has facilitated 
three recent visits by doctors and chemists from overseas in 
order to hold medical clinics and perform operations.  Their 
ability to do these kinds of charitable works, despite such 
a modest congregation, was due in part to donations from 
Vietnamese Americans.  Hiep noted that there were 
unrecognized Pentecostal congregations in Hue, but said he 
was not aware of any difficulties encountered by these house 
churches.  When asked why he felt that Protestants were 
receiving such favorable treatment in comparison with some 
other religious groups, Pastor Hiep offered that 
\"Protestants have not done anything to break the legal 
strictures,\" and therefore find themselves free to practice. 
Taking poloff and conoff on a private tour of his church, 
Hiep said that there had been \"many problems with the 
Communists\" in the past, but agreed that the situation had 
improved. (Note:  It appears that Hiep felt more comfortable 
speaking to officers when the Embassy translator and other 
church members were not present.  End Note) 
 
Comment 
------------ 
 
9. (SBU) While the Catholics and Protestants appeared 
frustrated with the attitudes of local authorities, it 
appeared that both were taking an approach of patient 
cooperation in order to ensure their ability to operate.  In 
the end, it seems many church leaders have come to the 
conclusion that while progress was slow -- at times glacial 
-- it was nonetheless progress, and they have chosen to 
focus on commonalities and cooperation in the belief that 
this would best serve their believers in the province.

1. (SBU) ON JUNE 2, 2004, AT 11:00 HOURS, RSO MET WITH TWO AMCITS 
WHO WERE CURRENTLY ON A BUSINESS TRIP TO HO CHI MINH CITY, 
VIETNAM.  BOTH AMCITS REPORTED THAT THEY ARE STAYING AT THE

NIGHT OF JUNE 1 AT APPROXIMATELY 22:00 HOURS, THEY WENT TO THE

SIX-INCH LETTERS ON THE BACK THAT SAID \"ALITALIA\".  THE SUBJECT 
WAS ALSO WEARING BLUE UNIFORM PANTS AND THE AMCITS DESCRIBED HIM 
AS LOOKING LIKE \"AN AIRLINE BAGGAGE HANDLER.\"  THE AMCITS SAID THE 
INDIVIDUAL WAS IN HIS LATE 20S TO EARLY 30S, APPROXIMATELY 5\'8\" TO 
5\'10\" TALL, HAD WELL-GROOMED SHORT BLACK HAIR AND PROMINENT EARS. 
WHILE THE AMCITS OBSERVED THE INDIVIDUAL WATCHING PEOPLE COME UP 
AND DOWN THE STAIRS, THE INDIVIDUAL SUDDENLY MOVED OVER TO STAND 
NEXT TO THEM, ONLY INCHES AWAY.  THE INDIVIDUAL STAYED THERE FOR 
APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES, AND THE AMCITS GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HIM. 
THE SUBJECT THEN MOVED BACK TO THE STAIRS BRIEFLY AND WALKED DOWN 
THE STAIRS AND DEPARTED THE CLUB AT APPROXIMATELY 22:50 HOURS. 
 
3. (SBU) THE AMCITS WERE CONCERNED ENOUGH THAT THEY WENT TO THE 
HOTEL\'S INTERNET SERVICE COMPUTER AND CHECKED THE FBI MOST WANTED 
TERRORIST WEBSITE.  BASED ON THE PHOTOS ON THE WEBSITE, THEY HAVE 
IDENTIFIED THE INDIVIDUAL AS FAHID MOHAMMED ALLY MSALAM; DPOB: 19 
FEBRUARY 1976 IN MOMBASSA, KENYA AND WANTED IN CONNECTION OF THE 
EAST AFRICAN EMBASSY BOMBINGS IN 1998.

BOTH AMCITS REPORTED THAT THEY WOULD BE IN VIETNAM UNTIL JUNE 4, 
2004 AND WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER FURTHER. 
 
5. (SBU) ACTIONS TAKEN:  RSO HCMC CONTACTED RSO HANOI TO REPORT 
INCIDENT.  RSO HANOI PASSED INFORMATION ON TO AMBASSADOR, DCM AND 
FBI LEGATT BANGKOK.  RSO HCMC ALSO INFORMED CG, DPO AND DHS OIC 
RICK SELL.  RSO HANOI AND RSO HCMC CONTACTED RESPECTIVE MINISTRY 
OF PUBLIC SECURITY (MPS) CONTACTS TO ARRANGE MEETINGS WITH 
COUNTERPARTS TO INFORM THEM OF THE MATTER AND REQUEST IMMEDIATE 
ASSISTANCE.  RSOS HANOI AND HCMC APPRISED LGF AND SD TEAMS OF THE 
SITUATION AND DISSEMINATED FBI FLYERS OF THE SUBJECT TO ALL LGF 
POSTS.  RSOS ALSO DISSEMINATED FBI FLYERS TO ALL APARTMENT 
BUILDINGS IN WHICH USG MEMBERS AND FAMILIES ARE RESIDING. 
 
6. (SBU)  RSO HCMC ALSO VISITED THE SHERATON SAIGON HOTEL AND 
SPOKE WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER AND THE SECURITY CHIEF REGARDING 
THE MATTER.  THE SECURITY CHIEF NOTED THAT NONE OF HIS GUARD FORCE 
REPORTED ANYONE LOOKING OR ACTING SUSPICIOUS THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. 
RSO VIEWED VIDEOTAPES FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE OF THE TWO ELEVATOR 
BANKS WITH DEDICATED ACCESS TO THE NIGHTCLUB, BUT THEY WERE OF 
SUCH POOR QUALITY THAT PEOPLE WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE.  THE GENERAL 
MANAGER AGREED TO HOLD THE TAPE FOR 60 DAYS IN THE EVENT OTHERS 
WANTED TO VIEW IT.  RSO LEFT A COPY OF THE FBI FLYER WITH THE 
GENERAL MANAGER TO DISSEMINATE AMONG HIS SECURITY STAFF.  RSO ALSO 
BRIEFLY VISITED THE INDIAN JAMIA MUSLIM MOSQUE LOCATED ONE HALF- 
BLOCK FROM THE SHERATON AND SHOWED THE THREE SECURITY GUARDS THERE 
A PICTURE OF THE SUBJECT.  THE GUARDS, WHILE HELPFUL, DID NOT 
RECOGNIZE THE SUBJECT. 
 
7. (SBU)  DHS OIC RICK SELL REPORTED TALKING TO MPS CONTACTS, WHO 
SAID THAT THEY ARE TAKING THE REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY AND HAVE 
ALERTED ALL AIR, SEA PORTS AND BORDER CROSSING AREAS OF THE 
SUBJECT AND THE SITUATION.  MPS ALSO REPORTED THAT THERE ARE SIX 
MPS OFFICERS DEDICATED TO THIS MATTER. THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
CONDUCTING RECORD CHECKS TO SEE IF ANYONE UNDER THE SUBJECT\'S NAME 
OF ALIASES HAS EITHER ENTERED OR DEPARTED VIETNAM.  SELL ALSO 
DISTRIBUTED FBI FLYERS TO THE MPS.  RSO AND DHS OIC WILL MEET WITH 
VIETNAMESE POLICE AND SECURITY ELEMENTS IN THE MORNING TO GET AN 
UPDATE ON THEIR PROGRESS. 
 
8. (SBU) RSO NOTES:  RSO BELIEVES THAT THE TWO AMCITS WHO REPORTED 
THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE SUBJECT ARE SINCERE AND CONCERNED 
ABOUT SPOTTING THIS INDIVIDUAL.  BOTH WERE VERY COOPERATIVE.  THEY 
ARE CERTAIN THAT DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY VIEWED THE SUBJECT 
CLOSE UP, THAT WHEN THEY SAW THE PICTURE ON THE FBI WEBSITE, THE 
INDIVIDUAL MATCHED THE PICTURE OF MSALAM.  THE SHERATON SAIGON 
HOTEL IS THE ONLY UPSCALE HOTEL IN HCMC THAT HAS AN IMMEDIATELY 
IDENTIFIABLE \"AMERICAN\" NAME.  THE NIGHTCLUB FEATURES AN 
AMERICAN/CANADIAN BAND THAT PLAYS THERE SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK.  RSO 
WILL REPORT BACK SOONEST ON ANY INFORMATION THAT IS DEVELOPED.

SUBJECT: HO CHI MINH CITY BUDDHISTS (OFFICIAL AND UN-) MARK 
BUDDHA\'S BIRTHDAY 
 
 
1. (U) Several thousand Buddhist believers joined hundreds of 
Buddhist monks and nuns at a June 1 dawn celebration of the 2548th 
anniversary of the Buddha\'s birth.  The event featured speeches by 
various leaders of the government recognized Vietnam Buddhist 
Sangha (VBS) and local government officials, all of which included 
mention of \"fabrications\" regarding alleged violations of 
religious freedom.  The speeches were followed by a brief Buddhist 
ceremony and the release of birds and balloons into the early 
morning sky over Vinh Nghiem Pagoda.  The ceremony, which choked 
traffic along the main artery leading from the airport to Ho Chi 
Minh City\'s downtown area, was filmed by several news 
organizations.  Smaller ceremonies were held earlier in the week 
at various pagodas throughout the city. 
 
2. (U) Thich Tu Nhon, Standing Vice Chairman of the Central 
Executive Committee of the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS), 
delivered a birthday message on behalf of Chairman Thich Tri Tinh. 
His remarks focused on the history and significance of Buddhism, 
but also mentioned the continued unity of the Vietnamese people 
and religious groups, despite \"fabrications by outside hostile 
forces\" about human rights and religious freedom problems.  Thich 
Tri Quang, Vice Chairman of the Central Executive Committee and 
Chairman of the HCMC Executive Committee of the VBS, and Mr. Tran 
Trung Tin, Vice Chairman of the Fatherland Front Committee of 
HCMC, made similar remarks, with Mr. Tin adding several points 
about the social contributions of the Buddhists to life in 
Vietnam.  Mr. Duong Quang Ha, Chairman of the People\'s 
Mobilization Committee, represented the HCMC Communist Party 
Committee, while diplomats from a few Asian countries and 
representatives from Vietnam\'s other recognized religious groups 
also occupied seats just below the Buddhist altar.  Mr. Ha and Mr. 
Nguyen Ngoc San, Chairman of the HCMC Committee for Religious 
Affairs, did not speak during the celebration, but took the stage 
briefly to present flowers to Thich Tri Quang.  Shortly 
thereafter, monks from each of the 13 sects affiliated with the 
VBS, dressed in their own distinctive robes, participated in a 
brief ceremony that included the chanting of Buddhist sutras and 
the lighting of incense.  At the end of the ceremony, Poloff and 
the other special guests were invited to the front of the altar to 
release balloons into the sky. 
 
3. (U) Arriving at Vinh Nghiem at dawn, Poloff had an opportunity 
to speak briefly with Thich Giac Toan, another Vice Chairman of 
the Executive Committee of the HCMC Sangha, who asked to hear his 
impressions of religious practice in Vietnam.  Poloff told the 
Buddhist leader that while it was gratifying to see large 
celebrations such as this one, continued restrictions on 
unrecognized religious groups would detract from any strides 
Vietnam had made toward greater religious freedom in the eyes of 
the world community.  Thich Giac Toan noted that in every family, 
there were always a few children \"who did not want to listen to 
their parents.\" 
 
4. (SBU) Later that morning, the ConGen was able to follow up with 
several leaders of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam 
(UBCV).  At HCMC\'s Giac Hoa Pagoda, where recent press releases 
from the UBCV\'s Paris-based International Buddhist Information 
Bureau (IBIB) indicated that the electricity would be cut off in 
May and up to 40 monks evicted, Thich Vien Dinh said the 
government had not cut off electricity or evicted the monks in 
this 10-year tug of war over who is actually the \"legal\" operator 
of the pagoda.  An early morning ceremony at Giac Hoa had been 
well attended, he added, and went off without any government 
interference.  Thich Thien Hanh, of Bao Quoc Pagoda in Hue, said 
many of his monks had participated in a big celebration at Tu Hieu 
Pagoda early the same morning.  While he himself was still under 
restrictions and unable to leave his own pagoda, he and several 
other monks had been able to hold their own special ceremonies 
during the morning.  He acknowledged that believers were still 
coming to his pagoda to worship as normal.  Thich Thai Hoa 
confirmed that more than 2500 believers attended the celebration 
at Tu Hieu, including monks from many other pagodas in Hue.  He 
also noted that the recognized Buddhist Church had held an 
official celebration at Tu Dam Pagoda that morning.  The monks 
thanked the USG for its continued concern.

SUBJECT: PROTESTANT S0URCE DISCUSSES CENTRAL HIGHLANDS UNREST AND 
ARRESTS 
 
 
1. (SBU) In a May 28 meeting with the Consul General, a reliable 
Protestant source reported that the April 10-11 Easter weekend 
unrest in the Central Highlands had resulted in the deaths of 10 
ethnic minority persons in Gia Lai Province and another 190 in Dak 
Lak Province -- contrary to GVN claims of just two dead in both 
provinces.  In addition, this Protestant source said 68 of the 
alleged \"masterminds and leaders\" had been arrested in Gia Lai on 
May 11 and 13.  Because of these arrests, he had had to hurry back 
to Gia Lai from Ho Chi Minh City ahead of schedule.  This 
prevented his meeting with EAP A/S James Kelly, who was visiting 
HCMC at the time, for which he apologized profusely. 
 
2. (SBU) This Protestant source said he was present in one village 
in Gia Lai on April 10, when ethnic minority residents, who had 
gathered to attend church services, were met by suspicious police 
who thought a protest was underway.  According to the source, the 
crowds were a mixture of believers (Protestants), Catholics, and 
non-believers.  Despite his best efforts to persuade the 
authorities that these were merely peaceful worshippers on their 
way to Easter services, with no intention of participating in any 
demonstrations, the police maintained their presence and continued 
to monitor the crowd.  When violence eventually erupted, our 
contact claims to have witnessed personally the deaths of two 
individuals -- one male teenager who was shot, and a 40-year-old 
male who died en route to the hospital after being beaten by what 
appeared to be plainclothes police officers.  The Protestant 
source said he went to the hospital where some of the injured were 
treated and saw two large rooms filled with patients lying cheek- 
to-jowl, but he could not give a numerical estimate.  He returned 
to the hospital on April 12 to check on those still injured.  He 
counted about 30 people still there. 
 
3. (SBU) Asked for his views on the root causes of the unrest, the 
source mentioned all of the longstanding ethnic minority 
frustrations over land, jobs, education, and discrimination 
(majority Vietnamese Kinh vs. ethnic minority peoples).  He 
described at length the discrimination that ethnic minorities 
endured: arable land and good jobs went to the Vietnamese Kinh -- 
particularly those migrating down from the North -- not them; 
funds from UNICEF and other NGOs for hunger eradication programs, 
micro-loans, and building water wells focused on the poverty- 
stricken Vietnamese Kinh rather than ethnic minority peoples; and 
laws were enforced disproportionately against ethnic minority 
peoples (i.e. when ethnic minority peoples slashed and burned 
forested lanQor cultivation, they were arrested; when 
Vietnamese Kinh slashed and burned forested lands to create large 
coffee plantations, they got off scott-free). 
 
4.  (SBU) This Protestant source also confirmed that some persons 
in the U.S. had told ethnic minorities that the U.S. would come to 
their aid if they protested.  In fact, the U.S. \"would rescue and 
resettle\" them.  He himself had been called by someone named \"Ksor 
Tan,\" (phonetic) who had tried to enlist his support (which he did 
not give).  According to the source, many ethnic minority 
individuals are still in contact with U.S.-based groups, and he 
worries that something could happen at any time.  While religion 
was a factoQhis Protestant source noted that the government 
response to the protests did not appear aimed at any particular 
religious group.  He believes that intercepted communications 
between the U.S. and the Central Highlands had tipped police off 
to the possibility of a demonstration.  He also asserted that many 
ethnic minority persons had fled to the forest or hidden literally 
underground to avoid arrest or punishment by police.  He could not 
give total numbers for the arrested or missing, saying that strict 
police surveillance made it difficult to corroborate these claims 
with family members of those believed to be in custody. 
 
5. (SBU) The source also discussed his reluctance to travel to the 
U.S. during early June as part of a GVN-organized delegation on 
religious freedom in Vietnam.  He did not want to damage his 
credibility or violate his Christian values by participating in a 
whitewash, but did not believe he would be allowed to refuse the 
invitation. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT:  After more than 15 meetings with ConGen 
officers over the course of 30 months, this was the most voluble 
and stressed-out that we have seen this reliable Protestant 
contact.  He was clearly worried about his impending trip to the 
U.S.  The GVN had taken possession of his recently-issued 
passport, and he had been given an airline ticket to Hanoi and 
told to present himself there for the visa interview.

SUBJECT: LEGAL PROTESTANTS SEE MOVEMENT ON SEMINARY, NEW CHURCHES 
 
Ref: A) 03 HCMC 235  B) HCMC 573  C) HANOI 1268   D) 03 HCMC 1087 
 
1. (SBU) Several members of the Executive Board of the government- 
recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) told the 
Ambassador they were moving ahead with plans for construction of a 
new seminary campus during a meeting last month at their offices 
in HCMC.  The Protestant leaders complained that the current space 
for Vietnam\'s only legal Protestant seminary (which opened in 
February 2003 on the top two floors of the same building housing 
the Saigon Church and the SECV offices - ref A) was insufficient 
to meet students\' needs.  According to board members, the students 
receive a free education for the full four years.  To qualify for 
acceptance, they must have a high school education plus one year 
of lay work experience in an SECV church.  The seminary is 
currently limited by its GVN-approved charter to accepting one 
student for every five congregations within each southern 
province, for a total of 50 students every two years.  Students 
must be recommended by at least one local pastor and one 
supervisory pastor.  While the government screened the first group 
of candidates fairly rigorously, the SECV leaders expected next 
year\'s class to be even more carefully scrutinized, now that the 
GVN \"knows more about the seminary\" and has a better sense of 
which candidates to reject. 
 
2. (SBU) The SECV hoped to build the new campus on property they 
own in HCMC\'s District 2.  This larger facility would allow them 
to accept women as well.  The current situation, with cramped 
facilities above the church, students housed several kilometers 
away from their classrooms, and the library in still another 
remote location, was not conducive to higher learning.  The 
pastors told the Ambassador they would fund the construction at 
least partially through donations from Christian and Missionary 
Alliance (CMA) churches in the U.S. and Korea, with additional 
funds from local congregations.  (Note: CMA sent the first 
Protestant missionaries to Vietnam early in the 20th Century, and 
the CMA denomination still dominates Protestantism in the country 
today.  All of the churches affiliated with the SECV are CMA 
churches.  Many other CMA churches have chosen not to affiliate 
with the SECV in order to avoid any semblance of what they see as 
GVN control.  In a visit to HCMC in February, the President of the 
CMA Church in the U.S. made clear that the CMA prefers its 
overseas churches to be self-reliant and does not generally 
provide financial support.  End note.)  With approximately 1.2 
million Protestants in the South, one board member said, the SECV 
needed to raise just one dollar from each believer.  The board 
members asked the Ambassador for favorable consideration of visa 
applications by seminary students in the future, as some go 
overseas for advanced study.  In a meeting between the Ambassador 
and the seminarians in an upstairs classroom, most of the 
questions from the excited students focused on visas as well. 
 
3. (SBU) The board members briefed the Ambassador more generally 
on the current state of the SECV, noting that there are over 1000 
churches and meeting points throughout the South, 372 of which are 
legally registered with the government and officially recognized - 
- including 44 in HCMC, 25 in Quang Nam on the central coast, nine 
in Danang, 11 in Gia Lai, five in Dak Lak, one in Dak Nong, and 
three in Binh Phuoc.  They described the current registration 
process as very slow, pointing out that it would take a long time 
at the present rate to register the 412 house churches in Dak Lak 
and Dak Nong, 178 in Gia Lai, 139 in Binh Phuoc, and two in Kon 
Tum.  The SECV leaders said they had witnessed some progress over 
the past three years in their dealings with high-level GVN 
officials, but understanding of Protestantism was still minimal 
among provincial and lower-level officials.  The board members 
agreed that Dak Lak was the most difficult province to deal with, 
largely because the local officials were \"very strong.\"  Asked for 
their impressions of the Easter weekend ethnic demonstrations 
(refs B and C), they said they had heard many stories (mostly over 
the Internet), with casualty figures running from 40 to 400, but 
were not at all clear on what had actually happened. 
 
4. (SBU) The SECV leaders told the Ambassador they would be 
holding their second general conference next February -- four 
years after the first congress in 2001 -- as specified in their 
government-approved charter.  The most important task of the 
general conference participants would be the election of new 
leaders.  The board members seemed content with the number of 
bibles they were allowed to print under the current arrangement 
and noted the GVN\'s willingness to publish ethnic minority 
language bibles in the future.  They said they had also submitted 
a request to publish a Protestant newsletter earlier in the year, 
but had yet to hear back from the GVN about permission.  Asked for 
their opinions on the possible consequences of designating Vietnam 
a country of particular concern for religious freedom, the pastors 
told the Ambassador that they had been approached to sign a public 
letter to the U.S. Congress critical of the GVN, but felt they had 
already made their views known to Ambassador-at-Large for 
International Religious Freedom John Hanford during his visit here 
in October 2003 (ref D).

1. (SBU) ON JUNE 6, 2004 AT 18:00 HOURS, RSO MET WITH MEMBERS OF 
THE MINISTRY OF PUBLIC SECURITY (MPS) TO DISCUSS THE RECENT 
POSSIBLE TERRORIST SUSPECT SIGHTING(S) OF FAHID MOHAMMED ALLY 
MSALAM IN HO CHI MINH CITY (HCMC).  THE MEETING TOOK PLACE AT A 
COFFEE SHOP NEAR THE CONSULATE GENERAL (CONGEN).  IN ATTENDANCE 
WERE MR. NGUYEN NHU HUONG, THE DIRECTOR OF THE ANTI-TERRORISM UNIT 
IN HANOI; MR. NGUYEN VIET CUONG, DEPUTY TO MR. HUONG AND HEAD OF 
THE HCMC ANTI-TERRORISM UNIT; RSO AND MS. TON NU KIM BAO, THE 
RSO\'S FSN INVESTIGATOR (FSNI). 
 
3. (SBU) AFTER INITIAL PLEASANTRIES, MR. HUONG INFORMED RSO THAT 
UPON RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE RSO IN HANOI (BECAUSE MPS HCMC 
INITIALLY REFUSED TO SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH THE CONSULATE RSO, 
PENDING APPROVAL FROM HANOI, RSO HCMC PASSED ALL PERTINENT 
INFORMATION TO RSO HANOI TO USE WITH MPS HANOI), THE ANTI- 
TERRORIST UNIT HAD TAKEN THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 
 
3A. REVIEWED THE RECORDS OF THE GUESTS WHO STAYED AT THE SHERATON 
SAIGON HOTEL FROM JANUARY 2004 TO PRESENT.  CHECKS OF THOSE 
RECORDS MET WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. 
3B. REQUESTED THAT THE HCMC POLICE CHECK THE RECORDS OF ALL 
TEMPORARY RESIDENTS AND HOTEL GUESTS IN HO CHI MINH CITY.  AS OF 
NOW, THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE POLICE IN THIS 
MATTER. 
3C. REVIEWED THE IMMIGRATION RECORDS OF PERSONS WHO ENTERED 
VIETNAM FROM KENYA FROM JANUARY 2004 TO PRESENT.  THIS REVIEW 
TURNED UP 22 PERSONS FROM KENYA WHO ENTERED VIETNAM DURING THAT 
PERIOD, OF WHICH 21 HAVE SINCE DEPARTED.  ONLY ONE KENYAN REMAINS 
IN VIETNAM.  MPS IS CURRENTLY CHECKING ON THAT INDIVIDUAL, WHO IS 
CURRENTLY IN HANOI. 
3D. REVIEWED THE SECURITY TAPES FROM JUNE 1ST FROM THE SHERATON 
HOTEL.  A CHECK OF THOSE TAPES MET WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. 
3E. SHOWED THE PICTURE OF THE SUBJECT TO THE SHERATON STAFF AND 
SOME OF THE GUESTS.  THIS ALSO MET WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS. 
3F. SET UP SURVEILLANCE AROUND THE HOTEL AND AT THE NIGHTCLUB ON 
THE 23RD FLOOR.  THE SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN.  THE SURVEILLANCE 
WILL CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL MORE DAYS. 
3G. MR. HUONG ALSO REPORTED THAT MPS IS CONDUCTING SECURITY 
TRAINING FOR GUARDS WORKING AT AMERICAN FACTORIES AND BUSINESSES 
IN SOUTHERN VIETNAM, SO THAT THEY CAN BE MORE ALERT TO ANY 
SUSPICIOUS PERSONS WHO MAY BE SURVEILLING THEIR 
PROPERTY/PERSONNEL.  HE SAID THEY JUST COMPLETED TRAINING IN BINH 
DUONG PROVINCE.  (POST NOTE: BINH DUONG PROVINCE IS ADJACENT TO 
HCMC AND IS HOME TO SEVERAL LARGE INDUSTRIAL PARKS WHICH HAVE 
AMERICAN, VIETNAMESE, AND JOINT VENTURE FOREIGN FIRMS RESIDENT 
THERE.  END NOTE.) 
 
4. (SBU) MR. HUONG THEN ASKED FOR DETAILS OF THE EVENT THAT 
TRANSPIRED IN REFTEL A.  RSO DESCRIBED THE REPORTED SIGHTING AND 
PASSED ON THE NAMES OF THE TWO AMERICANS WHO WERE THE SOURCES. 
RSO INFORMED MPS THAT ALTHOUGH THE TWO AMERICANS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES, THEY 
DEPARTED THE COUNTRY ON JUNE 4.  RSO EMPHASIZED HIS CONCERN ABOUT 
THE LOCATION OF THE SIGHTING (A LUXURY BUSINESS HOTEL) AND NOTED 
THAT IT WAS A POTENTIAL SOFT TARGET.  MPS AGREED WITH THIS 
ASSESSMENT.  MR. HUONG THEN SAID THAT THE ANTI-TERRORIST UNIT IS 
REQUESTING THAT A HOTLINE NUMBER BE SET UP BETWEEN MPS AND THE 
CONGEN LIKE THE ONE THEY HAVE SET UP IN HANOI WITH THE EMBASSY. 
THEY ARE CURRENTLY AWATING PERMISSION AND WHEN IT IS ESTABLISHED, 
MPS WILL CONTACT THE RSO. 
 
5. (SBU) UNTIL SUCH TIME, RSO ASKED FOR A PHONE NUMBER HE COULD 
USE IN AN EMERGENCY.  MR. HUONG TOLD RSO TO USE MR. CUONG\'S 
CELLPHONE NUMBER (091-313-0445).  RSO ALSO NOTED THAT IT IS 
IMPERATIVE, IN THE EVENT OF AN INCIDENT SUCH AS THIS, TO BE ABLE 
TO MEET IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY WITH THE MPS ANTI-TERRORIST UNIT. 
MR. HUONG REPLIED THAT THE ANTI-TERRORIST UNIT WILL TRY TO FULFILL 
THE CONGEN\'S REQUEST AT THE SOONEST TIME POSSIBLE. 
 
6. (SBU) MR. HUONG THEN CONTINUED THAT ALTHOUGH THE ANTI-TERRORISM 
UNIT IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT WITHIN MPS, IT IS STILL 
RELATIVELY NEW.  HE ASKED IF THE RSO COULD HELP WITH ANY TYPE OF 
TRAINING, ESPECIALLY IN BOMB RECOGNITION.  RSO RESPONDED THAT 
CONGEN WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE TRAINING, AS HE HAD BEEN AN 
INSTRUCTOR FOR DIPLOMATIC SECURITY AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT.  RSO 
EXPLAINED THAT THE TRAINING COULD BE CONDUCTED AT THE CONSULATE OR 
AT ONE OF THEIR FACILITIES, AS LONG AS THEY HAD A SYSTEM THAT A 
POWER POINT PROGRAM COULD OPERATE ON.  MR. HUONG EXPRESSED 
APPRECIATION, AND SAID IF PERMISSION WAS GRANTED FROM HIS 
SUPERVISORS, THE RSO COULD EXPECT TO HAVE 15-20 STUDENTS PER CLASS 
AT AN MPS FACILITY.  RSO WILL FOLLOW UP SEPARATELY WITH MR. CUONG. 
 
7. (SBU)  RSO AGAIN THANKED BOTH OFFICIALS FOR THE MEETING AND THE 
WORK THEY WERE DOING TO MAKE THE CONSULATE SAFE.  RSO ALSO NOTED 
THAT THE COOPERATION THE CONGEN HAS RECEIVED SO FAR FROM VARIOUS 
VIETNAMESE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY AGENCIES HAS BEEN VERY 
GOOD, BUT THIS MEETING WITH MPS WAS ESSENTIAL.  RSO CONTINUED THAT 
HE LOOKED FORWARD TO HAVING CONTINUED SUPPORT FROM MPS.  MR. HUONG 
ALSO STATED THAT HE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE MEETING AND THE 
COOPERATION.  THE MEETING CONCLUDED AT 19:30 HOURS.  THE 
ATMOSPHERE WAS CORDIAL AND INFORMATIVE THROUGHOUT. 
 
8. (SBU) RSO FURTHER REPORTS THE FOLLOWING U.S. POCS OF THE TWO 
AMCITS WHO FIRST REPORTED THE SIGHTING.  THEY DEPARTED VIETNAM ON

SUBJECT: HCMC TOURISM SEMINAR DRAWS LARGE CROWD, BUT CAN VIETNAM? 
 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
1.  Despite recent setbacks from SARS and the avian flu, the 
number of foreign tourists to Vietnam has been growing steadily 
over the past decade.  Provincial and local governments, as well 
as the central government, have been pushing to make Vietnam a top 
tourist and leisure destination.  Yet the percentage of tourists 
coming from the U.S. has actually declined.  At a recent American 
Chamber of Commerce seminar in HCMC, visiting foreign experts 
advised the burgeoning travel and leisure industry to pool their 
financial resources in order to place Vietnam on the radar screen 
of American tourists.  Consul General Yamauchi urged the 
Vietnamese government to improve consular notification and access 
practices and to establish a tourist police.  Visiting experts 
suggested that the GVN streamline visa, immigration, and customs 
procedures, allow firms to bring in foreign management and 
technical staff without putting obstacles in their way, and to 
develop sensible infrastructure plans and projects.  But will the 
GVN focus on any of these issues? 
 
GVN NEEDS TO SHAPE UP 
--------------------- 
2.  On May 14, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Ho Chi 
Minh City (HCMC) hosted a seminar on \"Marketing Vietnam as a 
Destination for American Travelers.\"  AmCham assembled a slate of 
travel industry executives, market analysts, entrepreneurs, and 
travel writers to share their insights with their Vietnamese 
counterparts, who have repeatedly expressed befuddlement over the 
best way to attract American tourists.  The event drew more than 
200 travel industry professionals, Vietnamese and expatriate 
alike.  Keen local interest in how to draw American leisure 
travelers halfway around the world -- bypassing many attractive 
and more convenient destinations enroute -- meant the meeting hall 
was standing-room only by the time Consul General Yamauchi and 
Vice Chairman Nhan of the HCMC People\'s Committee delivered 
opening remarks. 
 
3.  The good news is easy.  Vietnam is an exotic destination with 
beautiful beaches, scenic mountains, and a range of historic 
sights and sites.  The bad news is that so do Thailand, the 
Philippines, and Indonesia, and those are just the regional 
competitors for American tourist dollars.  The one trump card 
Vietnam has to play -- the perception that it is the safest 
destination in Southeast Asia -- may not be enough to overcome a 
host of obstacles. 
 
4.  In opening remarks, CG Yamauchi emphasized USG concerns for 
the safety and security of AmCits in Vietnam.  At present, there 
is no reliable system of consular notification and access when 
Americans run afoul of the law and are arrested/detained.  This 
unpredictability deprives AmCits (and other foreign nationals) of 
timely access to consular officers and contravenes international 
obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  In 
the case of the U.S., Vietnam often does not fulfill the terms of 
the bilateral Agreed Minute.  While HCMC Office of External 
Affairs efforts to notify the ConGen of AmCit illnesses, injuries, 
and deaths have improved, provincial efforts are still woefully 
lacking in many cases. Prompt consular notification and access are 
indeed linked to Vietnam\'s reputation as a tourist destination. 
 
5.  On behalf of the HCMC consular corps (30 consulate generals), 
the CG reiterated the need for HCMC to establish a tourist police 
force.  The lack of tourist police means visitors in trouble are 
left to navigate the vagaries of the Vietnamese justice and 
medical systems without much in the way of assistance.  (Post 
Note: This suggestion is one that the consular corps in HCMC has 
put forward to the HCMC government previously.  Since the public 
security/police budget is controlled by the central GVN, the HCMC 
People\'s Committee has requested additional funding from Hanoi for 
a tourist police force these past two years.  Both times their 
request has been refused.  End note.) 
 
6.  A number of speakers mentioned the difficulty journalists, in 
this case travel writers, have in obtaining visas to visit 
Vietnam.  Travel articles are powerful, cost-free, advertising 
tools, but the onerous visa process limits the number of articles 
on Vietnam.  Moreover, when journalists or any other visitor does 
finally board a plane for Vietnam a rude surprise may await them 
at the other end.  The immigration arrival and customs clearance 
process can be quite lengthy.  One visiting writer told the crowd 
he waited in line for two hours upon arrival, an experience which 
left a \"bad taste\" in his mouth. 
 
7.  Vietnam\'s tourism industry is in its infancy, and the human 
resources needed are not always available locally.  Skilled 
managers and marketing professionals are needed, but bringing in 
expat workers involves bureaucratic hassles that the GVN could 
streamline or abolish to encourage tourism development. 
 
8.  American-born entrepreneur turned Thai citizen William 
Heinecke who operates hotels and resorts in Thailand, among other 
successful businesses, pointed out the role of government in 
overall regulation of development.  He noted that everyone agrees 
Vietnam is seriously lacking in various kinds of infrastructure 
and the GVN must sensibly decide where and how those 
infrastructure improvements are made.  Heinecke told the audience 
that no tourist wants to vacation next-door to a new industrial 
processing zone or commercial port.  In his view Vietnam is at a 
crossroads and in many areas the government will have to choose 
between tourism and industrial development.  This is sound advice 
for a country where it is not unheard of to see \"eco-tourism zone\" 
side-by-side with \"industrial park\" or \"commercial port\" on 
government master plans. 
 
Pool Resources for Vietnam Advertising Campaign 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
9. For the tourism industry itself, speakers pointed out several 
key areas for improvement.  Vietnam has no real marketing or 
tourism image, no catchy slogan, no unified ad campaign, and no 
one-stop source of information about the country.  Panelists 
advised Vietnamese counterparts to pool funds for ads designed to 
promote Vietnam as a place, rather than an individual resort or 
tour. 
 
10. One bright spot on the horizon is the recent interest in 
Vietnam by major U.S. airlines.  In the wake of the recent civil 
aviation agreement, American Airlines has hired a local agent and 
set up a new code share arrangement, and United hopes to fly its 
own planes on a San Francisco-Hong Kong-HCMC route within the next 
12 months.  Both airlines helped sponsor the AmCham seminar. 
 
GVN and Industry Partnership Needed 
----------------------------------- 
11.  The role of public-private cooperation was discussed toward 
the end of the seminar.  A speaker from the Pacific Asia Travel 
Association (PATA) related his experiences working on tourism 
campaigns in Hong Kong and Singapore.  He said the key element of 
both successful campaigns was a taskforce made up mostly of 
tourism industry professionals, but headed by a strong figure from 
the national government.  The taskforce leader was someone with 
sufficient stature to effect change within the government, 
whenever it became apparent that a government-induced impediment 
was holding back the industry. 
 
12.  The lack of positive GVN participation, except to promote 
state-owned tour companies, was clearly a frustration for seminar 
attendees.  In a bold comment, a Vietnam Airlines panelist 
complained that no GVN officials other than HCMC\'s deputy mayor 
attended the seminar, who made opening remarks and then left. 
 
13.  AmCham, through its Tourism Committee, will follow up on 
seminar recommendations and form a Vietnam tourism taskforce 
composed of some non- 
AmCham members as well.  Once the task force is set up, it will 
ask the GVN to participate.  The chairs of the AmCham tourism 
committee will call on the Vietnam Administration of Tourism 
(VNAT) headquarters in Hanoi to \"report\" the findings of this 
tourism conference to the central GVN authority responsible for 
regulating the industry and promoting Vietnam as a destination. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
14.  Travel to Vietnam is by no means stagnant.  In 2003, over 2.4 
million foreigners visited, including 220,000 Americans. 
According to VNAT, at least 1.6 million of these visitors came as 
tourists or to visit relatives.  These numbers are down from 2002, 
but the decline was relatively small for a year marked by SARS and 
the war in Iraq.  The long-term trend is one of growth, with 2003 
seeing four times as many visitors as 1993.  The frustration for 
industry insiders is that the share of the market comprised of 
U.S. visitors, who are relatively big spenders, is actually 
shrinking.  According to PATA, Americans made up 17 percent of 
foreign arrivals to Vietnam in 1993.  Today they account for 9 
percent, and Vietnam attracts only 7 percent of American trips to 
Asia. 
 
15.  Vietnamese, European, and Australian travel and tourism 
professionals here wonder what makes American tourists tick.  A 
recurring theme was \"We don\'t understand Americans and need help 
figuring out the U.S. market.\"  Some portion of the problem may be 
solved by spending money on professional advertising in the U.S. 
and more exposure to American tourists over time.  They seem, 
however, to miss a fundamental point.  Vietnam is far away, and it 
takes a great deal of money and time to get here.  This cuts out 
most American tourists.  For the remaining few, Vietnam will have 
to compete for their tourist dollars by outperforming its 
neighbors.  The increase of U.S. tourists as a function of market 
share will likely be incremental, especially since the GVN seems 
unwilling to do more at this time to market Vietnam as a 
destination.  There may also be a bigger underlying problem -- 
virtually no attention was devoted at the seminar to the subject 
of keeping tourists happy and safe once they arrive.

1.  (SBU) On the evening of June 8, ConGen HCMC received 
information from several reliable Protestant contacts that police 
in HCMC had \"arrested\" Mennonite Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang at his 
home in District 2.  This followed earlier reports that police 
were searching the home, which doubles as an unrecognized house 
church.  One leading HCMC pastor said police had arrived at the 
home at 1:00 p.m., under the pretext of performing some sort of 
property survey.  When Pastor Quang joined them outside, he was 
quickly arrested and transferred to the District 2 police station. 
The police returned an hour later to search Pastor Quang\'s entire 
home, including his upstairs office.  They also searched the house 
next door, where Pastor Quang maintained office space for his 
unofficial Boy Scout operations.  Family and church members inside 
the home witnessed the arrest and subsequent searches.  They also 
witnessed the police removing many documents from the two 
premises, although they were not allowed to accompany police 
during the search of the upstairs office.  Police continued the 
search until approximately 10:30 p.m. that night. 
 
2.  (SBU) According to one leader of the Vietnam Evangelical 
Fellowship (VEF - a loose association of nearly 30 different 
evangelical house church groups to which Pastor Quang belongs), 
HCMC District 2 police arrested the Mennonite leader at around 
4:00 p.m. on June 8.  When several VEF members attempted to enter 
the pastor\'s house, police blocked their way.  Some members of the 
VEF leadership telephoned their contacts in the HCMC police force 
to protest the detention and search.  (Post Note: The VEF has 
built a relationship with individual police officers over the past 
few years.  They frequently call these officers for information 
and/or advice.  End note.)  One VEF contact said a high-ranking 
police official had told him that under \"orders from the highest 
authority,\" Pastor Quang would be brought up on charges for 
\"acting against the government.\"  This VEF pastor speculated that 
the arrest probably had something to do with the events of March 4 
(ref A), when Pastor Quang and his colleagues physically attacked 
security officials they believed were surveilling his house, and 
after grappling with them, took their motorcycle.  Police 
eventually detained four individuals in the course of this 
incident.  Police \"invited\" one of Pastor Quang\'s assistants, 
Pastor Nguyen Huu Hien, in for questioning on June 9, presumably 
on a related matter. 
 
3.  (SBU) Pastor Quang is a self-described legal expert with plans 
to establish an underground legal defense training and advocacy 
center for religious groups.  While he was unsuccessful in gaining 
GVN recognition as the official legal representative of Father 
Nguyen Van Ly, he somehow managed to talk his way into the trials 
of the imprisoned Catholic priest\'s niece and two nephews last 
year.  Pastor Quang has also been a key player in several highly 
publicized incidents of alleged GVN religious oppression in HCMC 
over the past year, including the construction of an illegal house 
church in District 2; the destruction of a small chapel in Can Gio 
District; the physical altercation between police and Pastor Bui 
Van Ba at a house church in District 11; and the distribution of 
religious tracts disguised as sports program schedules for the 
Southeast Asia Games (SeaGames) in December 2003 (refs B-D).  In 
the aftermath of the SeaGames incident, Pastor Quang organized a 
sit-in with his followers at the local police station.  He and a 
couple dozen followers remained there until he got a signed 
contract from the police agreeing to release two other followers 
from detention in return for Quang calling off his bold sit-in 
(ref E).   He told Post last year that he has established an 
independent, unregistered Boy Scout organization for Christians 
only. 
 
4.  (SBU) Comment:  This latest GVN move against a well-known 
Protestant pastor is extremely unfortunate, though not entirely 
unexpected.  Details are still sketchy, but Pastor Quang has been 
on the GVN\'s radar screen for some time.   Pastor Quang\'s tendency 
to make unsubstantiated claims that do not match what other 
members of the Protestant community have told us about specific 
events, and his increasingly strident rhetoric and militant 
actions have moved some of his VEF colleagues to ask a sympathetic 
foreign missionary to \"counsel\" him on self-control.  Other 
Protestant contacts in Vietnam have expressed concern that many of 
Pastor Quang\'s activities are more political than religious.  In 
the past, Pastor Quang has told ConGenoffs that the GVN is 
reluctant to take him on because they know the U.S. is on his 
side.  He has embroidered an American flag on his shirtsleeves, 
challenging security forces to \"go ahead and hit me there, because 
if you hit the United States, it will strike back.\"  It is 
possible that this latest turn of events is based on the results 
of a lengthy and detailed police investigation into Pastor Quang\'s 
activities over the past few years, and the authorities may not be 
so forgiving this time.  Post will continue to follow up.

PASTOR\'S ARREST 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 0789   B) HCMC 0232   C) HCMC 0573   D) Hanoi 1268 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  ConGen followed up with several local 
Protestant leaders on June 10, to obtain additional details on the 
June 8 detention of Mennonite pastor Nguyen Hong Quang (ref A) in 
HCMC.  ConGen also obtained a copy of an official \"announcement\" 
of the arrest, which the District 2 police reportedly gave to 
Pastor Quang\'s on June 10.  ConGen sources recognized the 
seriousness of the GVN\'s case against their colleague, and 
stressed the need to deal with the authorities in a measured way. 
At the same time, the HCMC Committee on Religious Affairs has 
apparently urged the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam to 
keep its distance from this case.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) One local Protestant contact said he and his wife had 
visited Pastor Quang\'s home on the evening of June 9 to comfort 
the family.  They noted that police appeared to have removed 
Pastor Quang\'s computer and all paper documents, but had not 
ransacked or damaged the property.  (Post Note: This latter 
statement runs contrary to a June 10 report published by \"Compass 
Direct,\" which differs in tone and substance in its account of the 
arrest and events leading up to it.  End note.)  This same 
Protestant contact provided ConGen with what he claimed was the 
wife\'s account of the arrest.  She reportedly told him that she, 
Pastor Quang and their three children were in their District 2 
home on the afternoon of June 8, when one of their church workers 
telephoned from another piece of property they own 300 meters down 
the road to say that several land officials from the city were 
there to survey the property.  When Pastor Quang went to meet with 
the officials, \"approximately 100 police suddenly materialized\" at 
both his house and the other property.  Police immediately 
handcuffed and took Pastor Quang away without a struggle.  Four 
church workers inside the building witnessed the incident, but did 
not have time to assist their leader.  They said the arrest 
happened very quickly, and while police reportedly held a handgun 
to Pastor Quang\'s neck, they did not treat him violently.  The 
four church workers were kept inside the building for several 
hours, while police searched the premises.  They were able to use 
their cell phones to contact their associates, however. 
 
3. (SBU) At the same time, the wife reportedly recounted to 
ConGen\'s source, police poured through several different doors of 
the pastor\'s primary residence.  In fact, she found police already 
in the second floor office by the time she and several other 
church workers made it up the staircase.  Police also secured the 
house next door, which Pastor Quang used for additional office 
space.  Approximately 20 family and friends at the primary 
residence were kept inside for several hours while police 
searched, although at least one of them was able to contact a 
member of the Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship (VEF) leadership on 
his cell phone.  When that VEF leader arrived about 30 minutes 
later, he thought Pastor Quang was still inside his house.  As he 
approached the house, he reportedly received a telephone call from 
a contact in the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) advising him to 
leave.  Upon contacting a higher level MPS officer, he was told 
that the arrest order had come down from \"the highest authority,\" 
which the pastor assumed to mean the central government in Hanoi. 
This second MPS contact also told him that Pastor Quang\'s own 
associates had provided the information leading to the arrest, 
allegedly accusing Pastor Quang of inciting them to attack police 
on March 4 (ref B). 
 
4. (SBU) According to this same ConGen source, Pastor Quang\'s wife 
was \"invited\" to the District 2 police station on the morning of 
June 10.  She was not allowed to see her husband, but was asked to 
witness the opening of evidence bags she had signed for during the 
search on June 9.  But since she herself did not know what was 
inside the evidence bags, Pastor Quang\'s wife told police she did 
not wish to witness their opening.  She was released after several 
hours.  Before she left, she was given a copy of a police report 
affirming her husband\'s temporary detention on charges of 
\"inciting and encouraging others to obstruct officials in the 
furtherance of their duties.\"  One of Pastor Quang\'s assistants, 
Pastor Nguyen Huu Hien appeared at the District 2 police station 
on June 11, two days after he was \"invited\" to speak with them. 
He was released from questioning after a few hours, despite 
others\' fears that he would also be arrested. 
 
5. (SBU) Another VEF leader told ConGen that Pastor Quang was 
arrested because the GVN was angry over information he had 
published regarding the March 4 incident and other topics on an 
activist website, www.ykien.net (\"y kien\" means opinion in 
Vietnamese).  This would put him in the category of a cyber- 
dissident, rather than a religious worker.  The VEF leader said he 
believes a May letter from the Mennonite Church in the U.S. to the 
GVN regarding the March 4 incident was yet another aggravating 
factor.  According to this VEF leader, the GVN was feeling 
\"empowered by its success in deceiving\" the international 
community over the true nature of recent ethnic demonstrations in 
the Central Highlands (refs C and D).  He noted that police had 
visited three prominent house church services in HCMC the previous 
Sunday to question the pastors about their religious activities, 
something that almost never happens in this city.  He worried that 
Pastor Quang\'s latest encounter with the law was extremely 
serious, and was based on a lengthy investigation.  He said Pastor 
Quang\'s colleagues from the VEF planned to continue their 
discussions with contacts in MPS on June 11.  (Post will report 
via septel.)  He also noted that the VEF had decided three days 
before the June 8 arrest to draft a report to the GVN on the 
current state of the house church movement.  The arrest would not 
affect those plans, although they would not address the Pastor 
Quang arrest in that document.  The VEF knew that they needed to 
be careful in approaching this issue with the GVN.  He did not 
think there would be any sort of organized protest at the police 
station. 
 
6. (SBU) A separate Protestant contact reported to ConGen that the 
Chairman and Vice Chairman of the HCMC Religious Affairs Committee 
spent one hour at the offices of the government-recognized 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV) on June 10 to advise 
them against getting involved in this matter.  They \"reminded\" the 
Executive Board that Pastor Quang was not a member of the SECV, 
and that the Mennonites were not affiliated with the Christian and 
Missionary Alliance Church, the founding denomination of the SECV. 
They described the arrest as an appropriate response to Pastor 
Quang\'s opposition to the government, which was a criminal matter, 
not a religious one.  On June 12, another Protestant contact 
called to say that he had heard the police had returned to Pastor 
Quang\'s house for a second search. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Despite being directly asked, none of the 
Post\'s local contacts was willing to characterize Pastor Quang\'s 
arrest as some sort of larger GVN crackdown on Protestants, 
although there were hints that the lack of a coordinated 
international response to recent events in the Central Highlands 
might have emboldened the GVN.  There appears to be a clear 
recognition among local Protestant leaders, however, that Pastor 
Quang is something of a special case.  In their own minds, he may 
have crossed the line between purely religious work and 
controversial political activism in his bold confrontations with 
the GVN, and there are those Protestants who do not see their 
future as being out on that limb with him.

1. (SBU) Mr. Pham Van Tuong, formerly known as Thich Tri Luc while 
still a monk with the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, 
has confirmed that he is now scheduled to depart Vietnam on June 
22 under UNHCR auspices for resettlement in Sweden.  He will 
travel with his wife and child.  Mr. Tuong said he plans to follow 
up with AmEmbassy Stockholm on an existing SR1 immigrant visa 
petition after establishing residence in Sweden.  Post requests 
that AmEmbassy Bangkok and AmEmbassy Stockholm enter Mr. Tuong 
into the Lookout System to facilitate further processing at an 
appropriate time. 
 
2. (SBU) On June 3, 2004, Mr. Tuong mailed the ConGen (without 
explanation) a copy of an I-797 Notice of Approval containing the 
following information:

3. (SBU) According to our Consular Section records, USCIS approved 
his petition in April 2003.  AmEmbassy Bangkok has confirmed that 
the petition is already in their files.  The case number is 
PHP2003599003.  Mr. Tuong understands that he will need to contact 
AmEmbassy Stockholm to have the case transferred there for 
processing.  He also understands that there is no guarantee that 
he will qualify for that visa status until he applies. 
 
4. (SBU) In a meeting at the ConGen on June 18, Mr. Tuong said the 
GVN had issued him a passport three days earlier, despite his 
inability to obtain the required residency documents since his 
release from prison on March 26, 2004.  He credited UNHCR in Hanoi 
for keeping steady pressure on the GVN, and thanked the Embassy 
and ConGen for their concern.  Mr. Tuong said he had been 
questioned frequently by the police since his release, but did not 
describe any other harassment.  At the suggestion of UNHCR and the 
police, he had drafted and signed a \"commitment letter\" promising 
to refrain from any activities that might disrupt or disturb the 
GVN once he has left Vietnam.  He told ConGenoffs that he planned 
to remain involved in the cause of human rights and religious 
freedom, regardless of what he wrote in the letter. 
 
5. (SBU) The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which 
is making arrangements on behalf of UNHCR, has advised Mr. Tuong 
to meet with a representative from the Consulate General of Sweden 
at a local police station on June 22.  They have also assured him 
that an IOM representative will meet him upon his arrival in 
Sweden, although he did not seem to have any idea where he would 
be living or what he would be doing there.  He was uncertain 
whether someone from UNHCR or IOM would accompany him and his 
family to the airport for their flight.  ConGenoffs advised Mr. 
Tuong not to pack any documents or items that might be of a 
sensitive nature.  His itinerary is as follows: 
-- 22Jun  LH773          SGN-FRA   2030 0520 
-- 23Jun  LH3000    FRA-ARN   0715 0915 
-- 23Jun  SK6736    ARN-JKG   1210 1310 
 
6. (SBU) Pham Van Tuong was a long-time UBCV monk who fled to 
Cambodia in 2002 and was granted refugee status by UNHCR, before 
reportedly being kidnapped by Vietnamese agents and brought back 
to HCMC (reftel).  He was later held in prison in HCMC for over a 
year, and then sentenced to time served plus a few months.  The 
GVN denied knowing where he was until just before his trial. 
After his release, the GVN agreed to cooperate with UNHCR on 
processing his refugee claim.  ConGen has maintained regular 
contact with him ever since.  He received refugee admissions 
documents from Swedish authorities back in May, and his wife and 
child were issued passports at roughly the same time. 
 
7. (SBU) Mr. Tuong said he had been aware that a monk in the U.S. 
was \"sponsoring\" him while he was in Phnom Penh pursuing his 
refugee case in 2002, but had never seen the notice of approval 
until just recently.  He had not discussed the matter with the 
GVN, for fear it would cause delays in obtaining his passport and 
refugee documents for Sweden.  He had, however, been in contact 
with the UBCV\'s Paris-based International Buddhist Information 
Bureau via email.

SUBJECT: TRIAL OF AMERASIAN FRAUD RING IN HO CHI MINH CITY 
 
REF:  02 Ho Chi Minh City 0281 
 
1.  On June 8, a court in Ho Chi Minh City handed down 
sentences to defendants in a case involving an Amerasian 
fraud ring.  Consulate General officers had developed some 
of the initial evidence in this case over two years ago and 
then passed it on to local authorities, as reported reftel. 
The defendants were Vietnamese nationals who organized and 
participated in the fraud ring.  In addition, there were 
several provincial and district-level police officials who 
assisted them. 
 
2.  The principal defendant in the case, Ms. Nguyen Thi 
Thanh Phuong, was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for 
bribery, document fraud and \"helping others to escape the 
country illegally.\"  Ms. Phuong was identified as the head 
of a network which helped purported Amerasians obtain 
fraudulent immigration documents.  Mr. Vo Tan Bien, a former 
captain of Nui Thanh District public security in Quang Nam 
province (central coast of Vietnam) was sentenced to 18 
years for taking bribes and falsifying documents.  Ms. 
Nguyen Thi Thuy Hong, the younger sister of Ms. Phuong, was 
sentenced to seven years for facilitating bribery.  Five 
defendants who were former public security officers were 
given three-year suspended sentences for falsifying 
documents.  Three other defendants also received suspended 
sentences. 
 
3.  There were 12 other police and local government 
officials involved in the case.  While the court said they 
had committed wrongdoing in verifying and certifying 
fraudulent documents, their files were returned to 
prosecutors for further investigation.  The court did not 
agree with the light administrative sanctions these 
defendants had received, so it asked the Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS) to continue its investigations. 
 
4.  Comment:  It is a welcome development to see a 
Vietnamese court give lengthy sentences to a notorious 
Amerasian visa fixer and her collaborators, though it 
remains to be seen whether they appeal their cases.  The 
fact that other defendants -- mostly former MPS officers -- 
got off with only suspended sentences was disappointing, as 
it appears that these individuals are still on the job and 
on the take.  The publicity attached to this trial and 
verdict has prompted renewed questions about the status of 
the Amerasian program.  High levels of fraud, bribery, and 
manipulation were exactly what prompted the Mission to seek 
expanded adjudication guidance from the Department in March 
2002, and subsequently suspend adjudication of new Amerasian 
cases in January 2003, pending a response from the 
Department.

PASTOR WITH HOUSE CHURCH LEADER

HCMC 1222 
 
1.  (SBU)  Summary:  On June 23, ranking officials from the HCMC 
Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA) met with Vietnam Evangelical 
Fellowship (VEF) leader Pham Dinh Nhan (please protect) to 
admonish him over his activities on behalf of detained Mennonite 
Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang and, more generally, the underground 
house church movement.  Although the meeting\'s primary purpose was 
to warn the VEF not to protest Pastor Quang\'s arrest, Pastor Nhan 
said he welcomed the opportunity to discuss the house church 
movement with CRA officials, after seeking unsuccessfully for 
several years to arrange a formal meeting for his organization. 
While his meeting with the CRA did not yield new information about 
Pastor Quang, Pastor Nhan told ConGenoffs that police have 
continued to question Pastor Quang\'s wife and at least one other 
VEF pastor.  He believes that the GVN plans to deal with Pastor 
Quang harshly.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU)  On the morning of June 23, Protestant Pastor Pham Dinh 
Nhan met with Mr. Vo Ngoc Hue (First Deputy) and Mr. Tran Ngoc Bao 
(Catholic and Protestant Affairs) of the HCMC Committee for 
Religious Affairs, at their request.  He met with ConGenoffs later 
that same afternoon.  According to Pastor Nhan, the CRA officials 
told him they had requested the meeting in response to his March 
2004 letter to HCMC Communist Party Secretary Nguyen Minh Triet 
concerning the arrests of four Mennonite followers of Pastor Quang 
(ref A) earlier that month.  They also chastised him for his 
letter to the VEF membership regarding Pastor Quang\'s recent 
detention (refs B and C).  (Pastor Quang is affiliated with the 
VEF.)  That letter was also posted on the Internet.  The CRA 
officials warned Pastor Nhan against sending any further letters 
on behalf of the VEF, since the organization is not legally 
recognized by the GVN.  They emphasized that since the VEF had no 
legal rights, no one could refer to the entity as an organization, 
draft or send correspondence on its behalf, or claim to serve in a 
VEF leadership position. 
 
3.  (SBU)  Pastor Nhan told ConGenoffs he had challenged the CRA 
officials by redirecting the conversation toward a discussion of 
the history of the house church movement and its current needs and 
struggles in Vietnam.  While the CRA continued to focus on the 
illegal status of the VEF and the unlawful nature of the group\'s 
activities, he tried to use the meeting as a forum to explain the 
house church movement and urge the GVN to allow unregistered 
churches to operate freely.  Pastor Nhan pointed out to the 
officials that believers have waited nearly 30 years for progress 
in achieving legal recognition and freedom to worship without 
government interference.  The officials countered that, while 
mistakes had been made in prior decades, the past six years have 
seen real change and, as such, the GVN should be evaluated based 
only on what has transpired in the more recent past.  Furthermore, 
the officials claimed the GVN did not interfere with worship at 
most house churches, but only those that were \"very extreme.\" 
They said the GVN had to \"stop\" those who were \"extreme.\" 
 
4.  (SBU)  Pastor Nhan said he had been firm in asserting that 
problems remained, even for moderates.  He pressed the GVN to stop 
slandering Pastor Quang in the press when he had not yet been 
convicted of anything.  He stressed that the GVN should stop 
trying to ignore the existence of house churches by refusing to 
grant them legal status.  It was time to accept that the house 
churches were a fact in Vietnam, as in other countries around the 
world.  The GVN should work to find a way to accommodate house 
churches and address their spiritual needs.  While the house 
churches in big cities like HCMC rarely had problems, Pastor Nhan 
had complained that the lack of clear direction from the central 
government allowed provincial police in remote or less developed 
areas of the country to take matters into their own hands.  He 
asserted that most house church members wanted to cooperate with 
the GVN, but only if they were allowed to practice their religion 
as they wished.  The CRA responded that the GVN provides for 
spiritual needs by allowing individuals and families to worship 
privately in their homes, as well as in registered churches.  They 
pointed to the expected issuance of a new religious decree in 
November that would reaffirm those rights.  (Pastor Nhan told 
ConGenoffs he was concerned the decree would make the situation 
worse for house churches by making organized religious activities 
even more restricted and controlled.  He worried that this could 
lead to \"more and more serious conflict.\") 
 
5.  (SBU)  According to Pastor Nhan, the CRA members also told him 
it was \"not good\" that \"some among your group\" are speaking with 
officers at the Consulate General in HCMC.  The CRA members 
claimed this needlessly inflated small matters that should be 
handled without foreign government involvement.  However, Pastor 
Nhan said he was not worried about his own safety.  In fact, 
despite their warnings, the pastor was pleased to meet with the 
CRA members, because the VEF had been requesting a formal meeting 
with the CRA for the past several years without success.  He 
interpreted the CRA\'s reluctance to meet officially with the VEF 
as a reflection of their concern that they would somehow confer 
legitimacy on the house church movement.  In fact, the CRA members 
stressed that the June 23rd meeting should be considered as a 
discussion among \"private individuals\" and had refused Pastor 
Nhan\'s request to include other VEF officials.  Still, Pastor Nhan 
viewed the session positively, seeing it as a step toward 
establishing a dialogue between the Committee and house church 
leaders.  He was pleased that the CRA officials expressed a 
\"general willingness\" to receive information about house churches 
and perhaps meet again in the future, although they did not want 
this meeting or the possibility of a future meeting discussed with 
others. 
 
6.  (SBU)  The CRA officials did not provide any information about 
Pastor Quang\'s current condition, whereabouts, or the timeline 
under which his case might proceed.  The VEF believes that Pastor 
Quang is being held in District 2, but police there have not 
confirmed this and have refused to accept personal items that 
family members have brought for Pastor Quang.  Meanwhile, police 
continue to \"invite\" Pastor Quang\'s wife to the police station, 
where they have pressed her to sign a document stating she 
witnessed them open sealed evidence bags taken from the June 9 
search of Pastor Quang\'s house.  Not knowing if the bags were 
opened and then resealed by the police, she has refused to sign 
anything.  The police have called in at least one other VEF pastor 
to express their anger about the letter Pastor Nhan sent to VEF 
members announcing the detention of Pastor Quang.  In addition, 
Pastor Nhan said police are actively searching for Pastor Quang\'s 
assistant, whom they had previously questioned and released. 
Pastor Nhan noted that documents taken by the police from Quang\'s 
residence would make it clear that the assistant was fully 
involved in Pastor Quang\'s work.  Pastor Nhan told ConGen that a 
third individual associated with Pastor Quang and the March events 
was detained on June 30th.  Separately, Mennonite Church USA sent 
Embassy Hanoi a letter that reports unsubstantiated claims of 
beatings, destruction of homes and personal effects, and even 
possible loss of life.  (Note:  In the past, Pastor Quang has 
indicated he has little contact with his church in the U.S.) 
 
7.  (SBU)  Pastor Nhan believes recent police and CRA warnings to 
various church leaders not to become involved in Pastor Quang\'s 
case are a sign that the GVN is preparing to deal \"severely\" with 
Pastor Quang once he is brought to trial.  In this context, Pastor 
Nhan said he had heard that CRA officials had spoken with the 
Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV -- the registered 
Protestant umbrella group in the south) leadership about Pastor 
Quang.  The CRA officials reportedly conveyed the message that the 
SECV should not interfere, since Pastor Quang is of a different 
denomination and this is not a church issue.  In addition, the 
government had warned Pastor Quang about his activities many times 
and he had chosen not to listen.  Pastor Nhan noted that the GVN\'s 
charges against Pastor Quang \"cover everything\" except religious 
activities, allowing them to portray this as a secular matter. 
 
8.  (SBU)  When asked what role the USG could play in promoting 
religious freedom in Vietnam, Pastor Nhan urged the USG to 
encourage increased dialogue between Vietnamese government 
officials and house church leaders.  He said many GVN officials, 
including some on the CRA, appear to have a very limited 
understanding of the house church movement, and he would welcome 
any opportunity to educate them.  He also hoped that USG officials 
would continue to seek information about the \"real situation\" that 
house churches face.  He stressed, however, that progress on 
religious freedom in Vietnam would take time. 
 
9.  (SBU)  Comment:  As Post has reported previously (reftels), 
Pastor Quang has a mixed record that complicates any response by 
his followers or others to his detention.  On the one hand he has 
a long history as a house church leader who has faced difficulties 
directly related to this role.  On the other hand, he has admitted 
to ConGen that reports of GVN actions against him have at times 
been exaggerated in order to gain international support.  He has 
also engaged in some questionable activities as part of his 
activist campaign against the GVN that may leave him open to 
arrest based on non-religious activities, regardless of his 
motivation.  It appears from Pastor Nhan\'s remarks that the GVN 
may be moving to exploit this vulnerability.

SUBJECT:  RECENT NGO STATEMENTS ON DEMOCRACY ACTIVIST KHUE 
SLIGHTLY OFF THE MARK 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Post has spoken separately with the wife and 
two of the adult children (strictly protect) of detained democracy 
activist Tran Khue over the past two weeks, to follow up on a 
recent report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) 
concerning the status of his case.  While their accounts are 
somewhat at odds with the CPJ report, they nevertheless confirm 
that the family has had recent contact with the authorities.  They 
have also been granted more liberal visitation privileges.  The 
family is still awaiting word on a possible trial date.  End 
summary. 
 
2, (U) On June 10, the CPJ issued a press release noting that Tran 
Khue, an elderly writer and former literature professor, had been 
formally charged with espionage, after being detained without 
charges for almost 18 months.  The New York-based NGO quoted 
unnamed sources as saying that Khue\'s family had been \"called into 
the HCMC People\'s Court,\" where an official allegedly read the 
charges, which also included violation of an existing house arrest 
order.  The CPJ accused the GVN of \"using the pretext of national 
security to imprison a writer who has merely expressed his views.\" 
 
3. (SBU) According to his wife and two of his adult children in 
HCMC, Khue had persuaded prison officials to allow his family to 
visit him on April 28, his birthday, at the municipal detention 
center at 4 Phan Dang Luu Street, Binh Thanh District.  During the 
visit, Khue told his family that he thought police had probably 
already turned his dossier over to the People\'s Procuracy, and 
advised them to ask for an appointment with officials from that 
office for his attorneys.  His wife suspects he might have learned 
something about the status of his case from prison officials, 
leading him to request the special birthday visit.  Following up 
on that information, the family visited the People\'s Procuracy in 
early May, at which time the officials in charge of Khue\'s case 
told them they were amenable to meeting with his attorneys. 
 
4. (SBU) Unfortunately, according to the family, the two attorneys 
-- one of whom is in Hanoi and the other in Haiphong -- were busy 
working on the cases of Pham Hong Son and other democracy 
activists, and were unable to travel to HCMC in early May.  By the 
time they arrived in HCMC in late May, officials at the People\'s 
Procuracy told the family the case had already been transferred to 
the People\'s Court.  When the family went to the courthouse, they 
were told the case had been transferred back to the People\'s 
Procuracy.  Returning to the People\'s Procuracy, they were told 
the case had been transferred back to the police investigative 
branch.  In the end, the attorneys had to return to Hanoi before 
the investigation was completed, and were unable to meet with 
officials from either HCMC agency.  In what Khue\'s wife believes 
was a move to placate the family for this deliberate confusion, 
the People\'s Procuracy then issued a special permit to allow up to 
four family members to visit Khue twice per month. 
 
5. (SBU) Contrary to the CPJ report, officials never discussed the 
possible legal charges against Khue with the family during any of 
these meetings.  In fact, the only indication the family has 
received thus far of the possible charges is a notation on the 
special visitation permit accusing Khue of \"abusing democracy to 
distribute illegal documents.\"  Neither espionage nor violation of 
administrative probation is listed on the permit.  Officials did 
not provide the family with an actual trial date either, but did 
promise to give the family advance notice of any proceedings. 
Given the sensitivities of the case during this pre-trial period, 
Khue\'s wife told ConGen she was reluctant to have any family 
members meet directly with ConGenoffs, for fear that too much 
attention right now might cause adverse consequences for Khue. 
She believes her husband would not receive a long sentence, but 
had no particular basis for this. 
 
6. (SBU) Note:  Khue had already been under house arrest for over 
a year when he was detained by HCMC police on Dec. 29, 2002, just 
a few days after meeting with fellow democracy activist Pham Que 
Duong in HCMC.  (Duong had been arrested one day earlier at the 
HCMC train station.)  The 2001 administrative detention order was 
imposed on Khue for his role in seeking to register an 
independent, nationwide anti-corruption organization.  Even before 
2001, however, Khue was well known for his writings on political 
topics.  Prior to his arrest in late 2002, he was also active in 
protesting Vietnam\'s border demarcation agreement with China. 
This is not the first time ConGen has heard inaccurate reports 
about this case.  In September 2003, the Democracy Club for 
Vietnam forwarded to ConGen a notice regarding Khue\'s death while 
in detention.  We spoke to one of his adult children at the time, 
who assured us he had just visited his father three days earlier 
and found him well.  End note. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment:  Post is not sure what to make of the disconnect 
between the information provided by CPJ and the accounts of Khue\'s 
own wife and adult children, but the family does not appear to 
have been the source of the CPJ report.  Khue\'s family has always 
been a bit reluctant to talk to ConGenoffs about their situation, 
preferring to maintain a low profile as Khue\'s case works its way 
through the legal system.  We will continue to respect their 
wishes and monitor the case from a distance.

SUBJECT: HCMC OFFICIALS -- STILL ON TRAINING WHEELS? 
 
REF:  (A) 02 HCMC 0075, (B) 02 HCMC 0117 
 
1. Summary:  Since the Prime Minister signed \"Decree 93\" in 
December 2001, granting Ho Chi Minh City some level of municipal 
autonomy from the national government, the city is still 
struggling to interpret how much autonomy has actually been 
devolved from Hanoi and is treading cautiously.  Although HCMC has 
yet to see any dynamic impact or \"breakthroughs\" as a result of 
the Decree, according to a number of local officials, it has seen 
a modicum of change in land allocation, management of public 
servants, streamlining administrative processes, and, to a lesser 
extent, the budget.  Moreover, it appears that Decree 93 is merely 
the first step on a long road forward, and many government 
officials are awaiting further \"clarifying\" decrees to help guide 
them toward increased municipal autonomy from Hanoi. 
 
2. When it was announced in December 2001, Decree 93 was heralded 
as a watershed development for Ho Chi Minh City by local officials 
and the press.  It was supposed to \"liberate\" the city from the 
bureaucratic harness of the Hanoi central government, and give it 
more freedom in decision-making.  The intention of Decree 93 was 
to transfer more authority to HCMC in four designated areas: 1) 
planning, investment, and socio-economic development; 2) housing, 
land, and urban infrastructure; 3) budget; and 4) organization of 
city agencies and managing staff.  In a series of meetings with 
local officials that would presumably be affected by any changes 
in these areas, they referred to a general, if somewhat slow, 
trend toward more HCMC autonomy, but struggled when it came to 
specific examples of progress directly related to Decree 93. 
 
Land Acquisition Hard but Easier 
-------------------------------- 
3. The process of acquiring land probably reflects the most 
apparent changes.  The HCMC People\'s Committee is now authorized 
to allocate land of all sizes and grant land-use rights to 
individuals and companies, eliminating the need to send the 
proposal up to Hanoi and lobby for its approval.  Another 
improvement for HCMC is the authority to approve investment 
projects valued over USD$10 million, although the Prime Minister 
still must approve a \"feasibility study\" of these major projects 
before final action can be taken.  In order to ease the process of 
obtaining land-use rights, a \"one-stop shop\" has been established 
by the city.  First, buyers work with the Department of Planning 
and Investment to obtain a land license (which should take 20 days 
for cleared land; 40 days for uncleared land), and after the 
license is obtained, investors visit the Department of Natural 
Resources to obtain the land itself.  Land-use rights for 
individuals can be approved at the District People\'s Committee 
level, but a HCMC People\'s Committee Vice-Chairman must approve 
land-use rights for any organization, company or foreigner. 
 
4.  Even though the individual or company now faces a 
significantly reduced waiting period for acquiring land-use 
rights, there do not appear to be any fewer steps or approvals in 
the process at the city level.  Instead of the individual or 
company shuffling around papers to all the relevant offices, a 
representative of the Department of Natural Resources and 
Environment does the shuffling.  While this is clearly a win for 
land-use rights applicants, the overall approval process remains 
equally convoluted, and the idea of the \"one-stop shop\" was not a 
product of Decree 93.  Some HCMC officials argue, however, that 
Decree 93 made it possible for HCMC to streamline these 
procedures, and rightfully point out that these decisions no 
longer require the approval of Hanoi. 
 
Administrative Reforms 
---------------------- 
5.  HCMC officials stated that the process of streamlining 
administrative processes and government departments has been 
improving since Decree 93 was implemented, especially in 
restructuring public offices to be more simplified from the city 
to the local level.  Mr. Nguyen Trung Thong, Deputy National 
Project Director of the UNDP-funded project for Public 
Administration Reform, stated that since the year 2000, HCMC 
government agencies have been reduced in number from 46 to 10, and 
there has been an overall reduction in staff of 10-12 percent in 
the city\'s bureaucracy.   He claimed that the city had been 
working with some success at streamlining and increasing 
transparency of administrative processes.  Now anyone can go to a 
department and obtain the list of procedures required for a given 
service.  Another significant change for HCMC is more control over 
the hiring and firing of HCMC public officials, as well as over 
their salaries.  Hanoi previously directed uniform salaries for 
public servants throughout the country, regardless of 
specialization or location, and also approved all public 
officials.  More control over these areas allows HCMC to better 
manage the direction of its public policy, as well as attract 
better-qualified candidates into public service.  Mr. Thong noted 
that these changes have allowed HCMC to hire younger, university- 
educated individuals, and move younger people into higher-level 
positions at a faster pace. 
 
The Budget 
---------- 
6.  Whether HCMC has increased control over its budget, and has 
actually been able to retain more of its revenues, remains hidden 
under opaque regulations for negotiating revenue targets and 
percentages of revenue to be retained.  Most HCMC government 
officials who spoke to Econoff stated that HCMC is able to retain 
more of its tax revenues than before Decree 93, although exact 
amounts were never mentioned, even after repeated questioning.  It 
appears that the recent issuance of yet another decree signed by 
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai will clarify some of the previous 
uncertainty over the budget.  This Decree 124 details more 
explicitly HCMC\'s control over some budget items and supersedes 
any budget-related issues outlined in Decree 93.  (Post Note: The 
Standing Vice-Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee has said in 
meetings that HCMC\'s now retains about 32 percent of its tax 
revenues, compared to about 18 percent before.  The goal, he has 
noted, is to retain at least 40 percent.  End note.) 
 
7.  Decree 124 stipulates that HCMC will still need to negotiate 
its budget and tax collection target with Hanoi every year. 
However, once the two parties agree on a revenue target, the 
percentage of the revenue up to the target amount HCMC keeps will 
remain fixed for five years.  No one could tell ConGen the current 
percentage.  If HCMC collects more than the revenue target agreed 
upon, HCMC keeps 30% of the income collected above the target, but 
it can only be spent on pre-approved infrastructure projects. 
 
8.  Finally, Decree 93 allows HCMC to issue municipal bonds to 
raise capital, and the city did so last year for the first time. 
Decree 124 further expands HCMC\'s options to acquire capital by 
permitting HCMC to borrow money from foreign sources for certain 
infrastructure projects.  The ability to raise additional capital 
will be vital as HCMC tries to build an adequate infrastructure 
for its growing population. 
 
9.  Comment:  Unless city officials are just painfully shy about 
commenting on publicly available government decrees (a distinct 
possibility), even they have a great deal of uncertainty as to how 
much autonomy Decree 93 actually has given Ho Chi Minh City.  The 
city is on the right track, but it will probably limit itself to a 
few tentative steps while waiting for additional \"clarifying\" 
decrees to be issued.  City officials still feel the need to avoid 
moving too quickly, for fear of attracting Hanoi\'s attention or 
drawing the envy of other provinces.  Just the same, it is good 
news that HCMC officials seemed truly interested in, and 
understand the need for, further administrative reforms and 
increased decision-making autonomy.  While Decree 93 gave HCMC a 
yellow light to make independent decisions in certain areas, there 
is no green light from Hanoi on the crucial question of autonomy.

2. (SBU) According to family members (strictly protect), Khue 
chose to defend himself in the four and a half hour trial, rather 
than employ two attorneys he had retained for that purpose.  With 
the sounds of a celebration in the background, one of Khue\'s 
adult children told ConGen that Khue mounted a spirited defense 
in the face of heated questioning.  He said discussions during 
the trial, which lasted from 08:00 to 12:30, were \"not pleasant.\" 
 
3. (SBU) Despite a negative response from the HCMC External 
Relations Office (ERO - the southern branch office of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs), to a formal ConGen request to 
attend the trial, ConGenoffs made one last-ditch effort to 
persuade court officials to admit them to the early morning 
proceedings.  While ConGenoffs were ultimately unsuccessful in 
gaining entrance, family members later said they were pleased to 
see them at the courthouse.  Court officials invited up to ten 
family members to witness the trial, although only seven actually 
chose to attend. 
 
4. (SBU) Khue, an elderly writer and former literature professor, 
was arrested on Dec. 29, 2002, just a few days after he met with 
fellow democracy activist Pham Que Duong in HCMC.  (Duong was 
arrested one day earlier at the HCMC train station, and is due to 
be tried in Hanoi on July 14.)  At the time of his arrest, he was 
under an administrative detention order imposed one year earlier 
for his role in seeking to register an independent, nationwide 
anti-corruption organization. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  Post was dismayed but not surprised at the 
lack of access to this most recent high-profile trial in HCMC. 
Unusual, however, was the telephone call from ERO at 
approximately 10:30 a.m. informing ConGen that Khue was likely to 
receive a relatively light sentence for a lesser offense.  That 
they provided this information just barely halfway through the 
trial speaks volumes for the judicial process, but is another in 
a series of recent indications that the GVN is trying to score 
points with the international community on its human rights 
record.  Next week\'s trial of Khue\'s colleague, Pham Que Duong, 
in Hanoi, will be the next big test.

SUBJECT: ACTIVIST NGUYEN DAN QUE SENTENCED 
 
REF:  A) Hanoi 1964; B) HCMC 917 
 
1.  (U) On July 29, a HCMC criminal court sentenced prominent 
activist Nguyen Dan Que to 30 months imprisonment for \"abusing 
democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the State.\" 
Que was originally charged with the much more serious charge of 
\"espionage\" after calling for political and human rights reform in 
Vietnam over the Internet.  Que was detained on March 17, 2003. 
Counting time served in pre-trial detention, Dr. Que would be 
eligible for release in September 2005.  Despite official 
requests, the GVN denied Consulate officers access to the trial, 
which was closed to the public, press, and foreign diplomats. 
 
2.  (SBU) Dr. Que was combative throughout the 3-hour trial, 
according to Ms. Tam Van, Dr. Que\'s wife, who was allowed to 
attend.  He sometimes refused to respond to the judge\'s questions 
and was taken out of court three times to calm down -- the verdict 
was announced while he was outside court chambers.  Mrs. Que said 
Dr. Que\'s health is \"normal,\" despite ongoing diabetes.  She said 
that the Que family would move to press the GVN to amnesty Dr. 
Que.  (Note: Que was amnestied in 1998 after serving eight years 
of a twenty-year sentence for \"attempting to overthrow the 
people\'s government\" after he attempted to organize a group to 
push for a multi-party political system in Vietnam.) 
 
3.  (SBU) Comment: We had hoped for a better result from the 
trial.  While the verdict could have been harsher, the sentencing 
earlier this month of Pham Que Duong and Tran Khue to little more 
than time served led us to believe that a similar punishment might 
be in line for Que (reftels).  Nonetheless, the drastically 
different sentences between Que\'s 1990 and 2004 convictions 
underscores that some progress has been made here. End comment 
 
4.  (U) Begin suggested press points on Nguyen Dan Que 
 
Q.  What is your reaction to the sentence imposed upon detained 
Vietnamese democracy activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que? 
 
A. The Department condemns the Vietnamese Government\'s treatment 
of Dr. Que for the peaceful expression of his political views. 
His arrest, detention and sentencing violates international human 
rights standards.  The GVN has freely assumed these standards 
through its ratification of international human rights 
instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political rights. 
 
The Department urges the GVN to immediately release Dr. Que and 
all those in prison, detention or house arrest for peacefully 
expressing their views. 
 
Q. Did the Consulate General send someone to the trial to observe? 
 
A. The U.S. Consulate General was not given permission to attend; 
Consulate representatives were turned away at the courthouse door. 
We continue to remind the Vietnamese Government of its 
international obligations to fair and open trials and transparency 
in the judicial process. 
 
5. (U) End press guidance.

SUBJECT: (SBU)  DPRK REFUGEE \"UNDERGROUND RAILROAD\" RUNS THROUGH 
HCMC 
 
 
1.  (SBU) We met August 3 with a counterpart at the ROK Consulate 
in HCMC to follow up on press reports that the four hundred and 
fifty North Korean refugees that defected recently to South Korea 
did so via HCMC.  (On July 27 and July 28, 450 North Koreans 
refugees arrived in Seoul, the single largest defection since the 
end of the Korean War in 1953.  A Seoul-based NGO, the Commission 
to Help North Korean Refugees, announced that the refugees had 
been residing for months in safe houses provided by South Korean 
residents in HCMC.  The NGO also announced that the two charter 
aircraft carried the refugees to Seoul from HCMC.) 
 
2. (SBU) Our ROK colleague confirmed that the refugees were 
transferred from China across the Vietnamese border and then 
transported via Hanoi to HCMC.  In HCMC they were housed with 
sympathizers in the 12,000 strong South Korean community in the 
HCMC area.  The ROK counterpart said that the operation was run by 
the chief of the \"National Security Academy\" section in the ROK 
Embassy in Hanoi. 
 
3. (SBU) When asked how 450 undocumented North Korean refugees 
could pass through Vietnamese immigration and customs checks at 
Tan Son Nhat airport in HCMC, the ROK representative replied that 
the refugees were provided documentation showing that they were 
\"South Korean laborers\" returning to Korea.  A separate Vietnamese 
source confirmed that airport immigration processed hundreds of 
Korean workers who allegedly prolonged their stay in Vietnam after 
their labor contracts expired.  Our source said the Koreans were 
repatriated under the supervision of Vietnamese authorities and in 
coordination with the Korean Consulate in HCMC.  He expressed 
skepticism over the cover story, but said that local authorities 
considered the matter to be sensitive and ordered it not be 
discussed further.  GVN sensitivity to the issue also was 
reflected in the absence of any reporting in the state-controlled 
media, despite the story being picked up by the international 
press. 
 
4. (SBU) Our ROK colleague said that the GVN was \"angry\" that the 
Korean press leaked the details of the repatriation operation.  He 
acknowledged that Vietnam was placed in an awkward situation, as 
it strives to maintain good relations with both North and South 
Korea. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  The implication of our discussions with our 
contacts is that the GVN quietly collaborated with the ROK to 
assist in the humanitarian repatriation of North Korean refugees 
to the South.  What was in it for the GVN is unclear, as exposure 
of the program could create frictions with the DPRK and even with 
China, given its sensitivity on the issue.  Our ROK colleague 
expressed disgust and the Korean press, which broke the story and 
fretted about the implications of the leak for the future of the 
North Korean refugee \"underground railroad.\"  End Comment.

SUBJECT: POLITBURO MEMBER WELCOMES CG: GOVERNMENT WORKINGS AND 
TENTH PARTY CONGRESS 
 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: In an initial courtesy call Consul General 
Winnick asked Secretary Triet about the relationship between the 
Communist Party and the legislative assemblies; the role of the 
Politburo in Vietnamese government, and preparations and 
expectations for the Tenth Party Congress.  On the latter, Triet 
said preparatory work for the Congress in early 2006 were 
underway.  He expected the Party Congress to provide for policy 
continuity and continuation of broad directives of the 1991 
Congress.  (Comment:  The Party\'s internal review process over the 
next 18 months will likely set Vietnam\'s course for the next five 
to ten years, a factor we should keep in mind as we orient our 
bilateral interactions. End Comment.) 
End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) Newly-arrived CG Winnick met August 12 with Ho Chi Minh 
City Party Secretary Nguyen Minh Triet, the fourth-ranking member 
of the Politburo.  Triet also leads the HCMC delegation in the 
National Assembly and CG asked him to explain the role of the 
National Assembly.   According to Triet, the National Assembly 
operates like legislatures of other nations; issues discussed and 
resolved in the committees of the ruling party are brought up for 
debate and passage in the National Assembly.  (Comment:  Triet\'s 
multiple roles as Secretary of the HCMC Communist Party, leading 
member of the Politburo and leader in the National Assembly blur 
the distinction somewhat. End Comment) 
 
3.  (SBU) This relationship between the Central Communist Party 
and National Assembly plays out in similar fashion on the 
municipal level in HCMC.  Triet drew a parallel between the 
national level interplay and his own relationship, as Secretary of 
the HCMC Communist Party, with the People\'s Committee of HCMC and 
the People\'s Council of HCMC.  As secretary of the HCMC Communist 
Party, he mobilizes Party morale and establishes broad precepts 
for the local Party.  The Party\'s role is not to run the city\'s 
daily affairs, a task left to the People\'s Committee.  Rather the 
Party\'s mandate is to promote morale, educate members about their 
party and ensure that the Party is a positive force in the city. 
The Party drafts proposals for the broad orientation of policy for 
the next five years (the Five Year Plan) and submits these 
proposals to the People\'s Council for a vote.  Within the People\'s 
Committee and the People\'s Council, Party members are expected to 
apply Party precepts and advocate Party interests.  Accountability 
and reporting from the municipal level to the national level also 
separates the Communist Party from other Vietnamese political 
institutions.  Whereas the Chairman of the People\'s Council of 
HCMC is directly accountable to the Chairman of the National 
Assembly and the Chairman of the People\'s Committee reports to the 
Prime Minister, Triet reports directly to the General Secretary of 
the Central Communist Party. 
 
4.  (SBU) Triet also discussed the role of the HCMC delegation to 
the National Assembly.  The responsibility of the delegation is to 
represent the people of HCMC and express their concerns and 
proposals.  Triet heads the delegation, which has 26 members, of 
whom 18 are elected by the people of HCMC and 8 are allocated by 
the central government. The delegates receive direct petitions 
from HCMC constituents and listen to their concerns.  They then 
discuss the different ideas of their constituents and determine 
which proposals should be brought to the attention of the standing 
committees of the National Assembly.  There is normally a month 
between receiving petitions from constituents and the general 
session of the National Assembly, during which the HCMC delegation 
has ample time to debate the issues and proposals brought to their 
attention.  After the session at the National Assembly, the city 
delegation briefs its constituents to ensure that their concerns 
have been addressed. 
 
5.  (SBU) CG asked Triet to comment on the relationship between 
the Politburo and the National Assembly, specifically, if the 
Politburo directly advises Prime Minister Khai.  Triet explained 
that the Politburo only addresses general questions of policy and 
brings these issues to the attention of the Executive Committee of 
the Communist Party.  It is then the responsibility of the Party 
committees to ensure that Party members who serve at the National 
Assembly accurately reflect the Politburo directives at 
legislative sessions.  Therefore, the relationship between the 
Politburo and the National Assembly is an indirect one.  Of the 14 
Politburo members, 12 are from the Communist Party Central 
Committee, and the other two are the secretaries of the Hanoi and 
HCMC Communist Parties.  CG asked Triet if his tripartite role as 
a member of the Politburo, Secretary of the HCMC Communist Party 
and head of the HCMC delegation to the National Assembly provided 
an advantage to HCMC in the National Assembly in the formulation 
of policy.  Triet did not answer directly, but pointed out that it 
seemed logical in light of the dynamics of Vietnam for the heads 
of the local parties for the two most important municipalities in 
Vietnam to sit on the Politburo. 
 
6. (SBU) CG asked Triet about the upcoming Tenth Party Congress to 
be held early in 2006.  Triet indicated that preparations are 
underway.  In July 2004, the Central Party convened subcommittees 
to prepare for the Congress.  Thus far, four subcommittees have 
been formed.  The first subcommittee-the Documentation 
Subcommittee- will analyze the accomplishments of the past five 
years.  The second subcommittee, the Social-Economic Subcommittee 
will set the next Five Year Plan.  A third subcommittee-the Party 
Construction Subcommittee- will both reflect on the past Five Year 
Plan and look forward to the new Five Year Plan; it will review 
and criticize the Party over the past five years while mobilizing 
Party cadres and promoting party spirit and loyalty.  A fourth 
subcommittee will handle logistics, such as travel and scheduling. 
Triet did not provide a timeline for the work to be done in the 
subcommittees but indicated that at least two years of preparation 
was expected.   When their work is complete, the subcommittees 
will forward their recommendations to the Party\'s Central 
Committee and the Politburo.  Ultimately, the Central Committee 
will act by majority vote.  Triet indicated that the Tenth Party 
Congress would be open to new ideas in a way that will encourage 
\"building socialism\" in Vietnam and was careful to not give any 
indications that the Party Congress would usher in a new 
orientation.  He explicitly noted that the principles of the 1991 
Party Congress would remain the guiding force.  CG pointed out 
that the world had greatly changed since 1991.  Triet responded 
that these long-term guiding principles -- peace and stability and 
building socialism in Vietnam - have not changed. 
 
7. (SBU) CG asked about foreign observers at Party Congresses. 
Triet said that past Congresses have invited political figures 
from other Communist or Socialist Parties from abroad to attend. 
CG suggested that the Tenth Party Congress consider inviting 
foreign observers, including Americans.  Triet seemed surprised, 
commenting that it certainly would be a novel idea.  He added 
that, because some invitees had failed to attend in the past, the 
Party would need assurances in advance that invitees would accept 
their invitations. 
 
8.  (SBU) Bio Note: A southerner and long-time resident of HCMC, 
Nguyen Minh Triet, 62, has been Secretary of the HCMC Communist 
Party for four years.  Triet is ranked fourth in the Politburo, 
after the Party Chairman, the President, and the PM.  He is 
considered a candidate to succeed PM Phan Van Khai.  Triet also is 
a contender for the Chairman of the Fatherland Front Committee, 
when this position becomes vacant in 2006.  A progressive force 
with the VNCP, Triet was the first provincial leader to promote 
special \"red carpet\" incentive programs to attract foreign 
investment and streamline bureaucracy when he was the CP Secretary 
of Binh Duong Province.  Triet is an engaging interlocutor, and 
appears to relish debate on more controversial topics.  He became 
leader of the HCMC delegation in the National Assembly in late 
2002.  Triet has good English comprehension.

1. (SBU) Summary:  Recently-released dissident, Tran Van Khue, and 
Ms. Tam Van, the wife of jailed activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, told 
us that Vietnam remains far from meeting international human 
rights standards, particularly in areas such as freedom of 
association and expression.  Despite the injustices done to them 
and their families, they recognize that human rights conditions in 
Vietnam continue to improve incrementally.  Khue and Mrs. Que 
credit the USG\'s broad engagement with Vietnam as well as 
Vietnam\'s increasing participation in rules-based regimes such as 
the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) and WTO for human rights- 
related improvements.  They argue that this process of engagement 
helps bind the hands of Communist Party hardliners and creates new 
openings for greater personal freedom.  They plan to continue 
their human rights activities, although in the near term Mrs. Que 
will focus on securing amnesty for her husband, who has 12 months 
remaining on his 30-month prison term.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On August 16 and 17, we met separately with dissident 
Tran Van Khue and with Ms. Tam Van, the wife of still-jailed human 
rights activist Nguyen Dan Que to discuss their families\' 
situations and plans for the future, and to seek their views on 
the state of play on human rights issues in Vietnam. 
 
Khue 
---- 
 
3. (SBU) Khue, released July 31 after 19 months in prison (ref a), 
said that he planned to continue to push for democratic reform and 
government transparency.  Describing his trial, Khue said it was a 
foreordained farce.  Despite his many written and oral requests, 
Khue alleged he was denied legal representation. (Family members 
previously told us that Khue chose to defend himself at his July 9 
trial.)  A family appeal to the President of the HCMC Bar 
Association also went unanswered.  (Separately, the Bar President 
denied to us that he had ever received a request from Khue.) 
 
4. (SBU) At the trial, Khue said that he told the presiding judge 
that it was he who should be prosecutor based on the vast number 
of documents he had amassed detailing corruption and malfeasance 
within the Communist Party.  Khue said that he caught a glimmer of 
sympathy from the presiding judge, the Deputy Chief of HCMC\'s 
criminal court (a party member, as are almost all judges and 
prosecutors), who then proceeded to pronounce him guilty of 
\"distorting the historic truth\" and \"abusing democracy and freedom 
to undermine national interests.\" 
 
5. (SBU) A former Communist Party member, Khue said that he 
continues to have links to the party faithful -- for example, he 
plans to travel to Hanoi shortly to attend the 93rd birthday 
celebrations of retired General and national hero Vo Nguyen Giap. 
He credits his relatively mild sentence -- particularly in 
comparison to Dr. Que who was given an additional 11 months jail 
time -- to his Communist pedigree.  He suspects sympathizers 
within the Communist Party intervened to blunt the efforts of 
hardliners to hand him a harsher sentence. 
 
6. (SBU) Khue said that despite his own personal ordeal, his 
family has escaped largely unscathed, again because of his Party 
connections.  His two sons continue to work for two state-owned 
enterprises, and an ad-agency that leases space in the family 
house operates unimpeded.  A daughter who worked with him on 
publishing his anti-corruption manifestoes was fired from a 
military-owned shipbuilding company in HCMC, but Khue is hopeful 
that she will be able to find employment in another state-owned 
company. 
 
Dr. Que 
------- 
 
7. (SBU) Ms. Tam Van, wife of imprisoned human rights and 
democracy activist Nguyen Dan Que, told us that Dr. Que had 
decided not to appeal his 30-month jail sentence as an appeal 
would only confer legitimacy to an illegitimate process.  She has 
not yet been able to see her husband in prison since the July 29 
trial (ref b).  She understands, however, that her husband is 
being treated fairly by prison authorities:  he has a relatively 
large cell (16 square meters), and she has been allowed to deliver 
money and medicine to the prison two times a month. 
 
8. (SBU) Mrs. Que indicated that the family has been in informal 
contact with the authorities regarding a possible amnesty for her 
husband.  She has not yet submitted a formal request; she is 
counting on the authorities to notify her when the time is ripe 
for such a petition, perhaps, she speculated, in time for a 
release during the Vietnamese \"Tet\" holiday in early 2005. 
 
9. (SBU) Mrs. Que said that, in contrast to Khue, her family 
continues to suffer from systematic harassment.  Cell phones are 
bugged, landline phones are cut and family members and friends 
routinely shadowed and interviewed. 
 
Half empty or half full? 
------------------------ 
 
10. (SBU) Both Khue and Mrs. Que said that, although much remains 
to be done, Vietnam has made progress on some human rights issues. 
While appreciative of international concern for the plight of 
dissidents and pressure in their behalf, in their view progress 
was more a byproduct of the GVN\'s deepening engagement with the 
U.S. and the international community and Vietnam\'s participation 
in rules-based regimes such as the Bilateral Trade Agreement.  In 
this context, they view Vietnam\'s early membership in the WTO as 
desirable.  Khue added that there are honest and well-meaning 
members of the Communist Party and many are quietly sympathetic to 
his anti-corruption and reform message.  His overall impression is 
that hardliners are slowly having their grip on power loosened. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
11. (SBU) Our sense is that Khue\'s cautious optimism is on target 
-- at least as far as HCMC is concerned.  In our discussions with 
party members and affiliates we find a broad recognition -- albeit 
with different levels of enthusiasm -- that the party orthodoxy is 
being pushed to adapt and respond to a more discerning domestic 
constituency as well as to the demands of Vietnam\'s international 
integration.  Interestingly, even some dissidents agree.  End 
Comment.

SUBJECT: GVN LAUNCHES MASSIVE AGENT ORANGE MEDIA CAMPAIGN, BUT FEW 
ARE LISTENING 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Vietnam has launched a 
vigorous media campaign to whip up support for the Agent Orange 
lawsuit in a New York Federal Court, but our contacts and (wo)man 
on the street in Ho Chi Minh City remain largely unmoved, tending 
to be more preoccupied with quality of life issues such as 
education, trade relations and technology.  Mass organizations are 
\"fronting\" the campaign, but the GVN is not only the primary force 
behind the media barrage but has also issued specific instructions 
to media institutions to mask government involvement, according to 
PAS media sources.  End summary. 
 
2. (U) On August 4, media in southern Vietnam began a media 
campaign to highlight the Agent Orange case pending against U.S. 
corporations in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.  Each day 
there are articles highlighting victims, announcing mass 
organization rallies, and publishing interviews with both 
Vietnamese and Americans who are speaking out against the use of 
Agent Orange during the war.  Additionally, the newly minted Agent 
Orange Day of August 10 attracted significant media coverage, with 
heavy focus on Agent Orange events and programs in HCMC.  For 
example, the Labor Federation and the War Remnants Museum in HCMC 
held a ceremony to raise funds for Agent Orange victims and to 
collect signatures to support the lawsuit. That same day the 
Vietnamese Alliance of Friendship Organizations announced a 
campaign to collect 2 million signatures to support Vietnamese 
Agent Orange Victims. 
 
3.  (SBU) A correspondent for a leading paper in HCMC informed us 
that the GVN issued an order to editors to mobilize this campaign, 
but at the same time not to make it appear that the GVN was behind 
it.  This explains the apparent active involvement of \"mass 
organizations\" in what is clearly a command performance, at least 
in HCMC. 
 
4.  (SBU) A quick survey of contacts indicates that bread and 
butter issues continue to drive not only the city\'s leadership but 
also the average person on the street.   For example, an editor of 
a major HCMC daily told us that the city remains focused on the 
future and that readers are actually far more concerned about 
issues such as traffic safety, education, visas to the U.S. for 
study and business, and bilateral trade issues.  Similarly, 
business contacts have told us that the best way to bring about 
healing between the two countries is through vigorous trade which 
will do more for the relationship than any amount of aid or 
apologies. 
 
5.  (SBU) Perhaps indicative of the government-ordered nature of 
the media campaign, we have not received a single request for 
further information about Agent Orange from either media or other 
contacts.  In addition, despite the government\'s push to enlist on- 
line supporters of an Agent Orange petition, to date the effort 
has netted only 10 percent of the stated 2 million-signature goal. 
 
6.  (SBU) Comment:  Based on the above assessment, we will keep 
our Agent Orange guidance close at hand for if-asked use, but we 
will focus our public diplomacy efforts on issues that resonate 
such as helping to improve education, encouraging study in the 
U.S., explaining U.S. trade policy, highlighting our humanitarian 
assistance programs, and promoting the development of civil 
society.  End comment.

GVN\'s failure to notify the USG of the detentions, and the 
attempts made by interrogators from the Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS) to prevent the detainees from communicating 
with the USG after their release.  The text of the note 
follows in para 4. 
 
2. (SBU) Consul General and consular chief had discussed the 
incidents with Quoc during a function on the evening of 
August 13, and consular chief sent him a letter the 
following day with basic information about the cases (names, 
DPOBs, passport numbers, dates of detention, and dates of 
departure from Vietnam).  On the morning of August 17, ERO 
replied to the letter with a note stating that it had no 
information about any of the cases except that of Hoang Lan 
The, about whom it had already sent a note (ref B). 
 
3. (SBU) Meeting on 8/17, DPO repeated the USG\'s deep 
concern about the allegations made by the five Amcits 
detained.  Quoc reiterated that ERO was not aware of the 
cases and had been unable to obtain any information about 
them from MPS, but agreed that such abuses should not take 
place.  He said that post should provide him with any 
evidence the detainees might have provided supporting their 
allegations, and repeated the GVN\'s accusation that Hoang 
Lan The had been deported because he was a terrorist. 
Consular chief explained that victims of this type of abuse 
were rarely able to provide hard evidence of what had 
happened to them.  Consular chief also invited Quoc to 
provide any information in the possession of the GVN linking 
Hoang Lan The with terrorist activities, assuring him that 
the FBI takes such activities seriously, and pointing to the 
arrest of accused Bangkok embassy bomber Van Duc Vo as an 
example.  Quoc promised to look into the cases further with 
MPS. 
 
4. (SBU) The following is the text of post\'s protest note: 
 
No. 254/04 
 
The Consulate General of the United States of America in Ho 
Chi Minh City presents its compliments to the Office of 
External Relations in Ho Chi Minh City (Office) and protests 
strongly a series of instances over the last several weeks 
in which citizens of the United States were allegedly 
seized, detained, and interrogated by officials of the 
Ministry of Public Security (MPS). 
 
Although none of the American citizens concerned was ever 
charged with any crime, MPS officers nonetheless allegedly 
seized individuals and families from cars, hotel rooms, and 
other locations in various areas of southern Vietnam, used 
force to bring them under duress to MPS detention 
facilities, unoccupied houses, and hotels, and interrogated 
them for many days.  These American citizens reported that 
MPS interrogators placed bags over their heads; deprived 
them of sleep; bound them to chairs with ropes; and, in at 
least once case, punched and slapped them.  All of these 
alleged tactics were apparently employed in an effort to 
force these American citizens to respond to questions.  The 
United States citizens detained by the MPS also reported 
that they were forced to read \"confessions\" drafted by MPS 
officers and that these \"confessions\" were videotaped. 
 
The Consulate General protests in the strongest possible 
terms all physical and psychological abuse of United States 
citizens by Vietnamese officials, and requests that the 
appropriate agencies of the Government of the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam: investigate these allegations; punish 
the responsible MPS officials if the allegations are found 
to be true; and ensure that no such abuses against American 
citizens are tolerated. 
 
The Department of State believes that the conduct of the 
Government of Vietnam in these cases may also have violated 
the consular notification provisions of the Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), to which both 
Vietnam and the United States are signatories.  Article 36 
of the VCCR requires that the competent authorities of the 
receiving state inform a detained foreign national of his 
right to request that his consular post be notified of his 
detention.  If a detained foreign national requests such 
notification, the competent authorities of the receiving 
state must inform the appropriate consular post of the 
detention without delay.  We understand that none of the 
United States citizens detained by the MPS received consular 
notification as required by Article 36.  The Consulate 
General was officially notified of only one of these 
detentions (Diplomatic Note no. 3205/NV/LS, dated 12 August 
2004), but this notification came only after the American 
citizen had departed Vietnam, and several weeks after his 
initial detention, despite the Consulate General\'s repeated 
efforts to inquire about each of these cases. 
Finally, we understand that officials of the MPS ordered the 
United States citizen detainees not to contact the Consulate 
General or other agencies of the Government of the United 
States or to inform their Government of their detention and 
mistreatment.  Intimidation aimed at preventing American 
citizens from communicating with their Government also 
violates the VCCR.  Article 36 states that \"consular 
officers shall be free to communicate with nationals of the 
sending State and to have access to them.  Nationals of the 
sending State shall have the same freedom with respect to 
communication with and access to consular officers of the 
sending State.\" 
 
The Consulate General requests that the Office immediately 
inform any United States citizen who may be detained in 
Vietnam, but who has not received consular information as 
required by the VCCR, of his or her right to consular 
notification and access and to provide the Consulate General 
with complete reports describing their location and the 
circumstances surrounding their arrests.  The Consulate 
General will also insist on unimpeded access to any and all 
such U.S. citizens who may request it.  Finally, the 
Consulate General further requests the assurance of the 
Government of Vietnam that persons subject to its authority 
will not employ physically or psychologically abusive 
techniques when interrogating United States citizens, and 
that any officers of the Government of Vietnam who mistreat 
American citizens, or interfere with the exercise by 
American citizens of their right to contact their consular 
representatives, will be held accountable for their actions. 
 
The Consulate General of the United States of America avails 
itself of this opportunity to renew to the Office of 
External Relations in Ho Chi Minh City the assurances of its 
highest consideration. 
 
Consulate General of the United States of America

SUBJECT: PASTOR REPORTED DETAINED ON CAMBODIAN BORDER 
 
1. (SBU) Embassy and Congen have received reports over the 
last few days that Pastor Tran Mai was detained on August 29 
while attempting to enter Vietnam from Cambodia in the 
border town of Chau Doc, An Giang province.  Pastor Mai is a 
leader of the Inter-Evangelistic Movement in Ho Chi Minh 
City, an unrecognized Protestant denomination associated 
with the (also unrecognized) Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship. 
 
2. (SBU) According to these reports, Pastor Mai was 
returning from a trip to the United States.  The Pastor, and 
a number of his colleagues, are reported to regularly use 
the Cambodian border rather than Tan Son Nhat International 
Airport when departing or returning to Vietnam.  (It is 
unclear to us what procedures or travel documents are used 
for this border crossing.  HCMC issued Mai a visa in his 
Vietnamese passport this spring.  However, we understand 
that this trip is sometimes made with a border crossing card 
that is intended for one day travel within the border 
region.) 
 
3. (SBU) Mrs. Truong Thi Lieu (protect), Pastor Mai\'s wife, 
informed Embassy Hanoi Poloff that HCMC police had told her 
that Mai would be freed \"soon,\" and that Chau Doc police had 
told her Mai would be released after they \"cleared up some 
issues.\"  She said she knew of no specific reason why he 
should be detained at this time, and said he was not 
carrying religious tracts or other illegal items.  Mrs. Lieu 
speculated that the police were concerned about his 
international travels, and added that she had heard 
authorities viewed Mai with concern as a result of his 
prominent role in the Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship.

SUBJECT: MEKONG DELTA CAPITAL SEEKS NATIONAL ROLE 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Can Tho, the commercial center of Vietnam\'s 
fertile Mekong Delta, wants to break out of its role as a 
provincial capital and establish itself on the national and 
international stage.  While participating in a trade fair opening 
led by Deputy Prime Minister Vu Khoan, Econoff saw both potential 
and challenges.  On the plus side is strong growth.  On the minus 
side is under-developed infrastructure.  Seafood interests in Can 
Tho are feeling the pinch of preliminary shrimp dumping duties 
levied by the U.S.  END SUMMARY. 
 
TRADE FAIR OPENING WITH DPM VU KHOAN 
 
2. (U) EconOff traveled to Can Tho August 18-20 to participate 
with DPM Vu Khoan in the opening of a trade fair promoting non- 
agricultural goods.  She also met with First Vice-Chairman Pham 
Phuoc Nhu of the Can Tho People\'s Committee, who stated that Can 
Tho leaders plan to develop the city\'s economy around industry, 
trade and services, and agriculture.  Can Tho\'s growth rate for 
the last few years has hovered around 11 percent, well above the 7 
percent national growth rate. 
 
3. (SBU) According to the Department of Planning and Investment, 
Can Tho had 34 foreign-invested projects valued at $142 million, 
as of the end of 2003.  Five more projects were added this year 
with a value of $20 million.  There are three U.S.-invested 
projects and three U.S. companies with offices in Can Tho.  The 
city\'s three state-owned industrial parks had initial success in 
attracting investors but are now encountering difficulties.  One 
park is being sold to a private investor who manages industrial 
parks in Ho Chi Minh City.  The most active of the parks 
negotiated too many cut-rate leases and is struggling to fund 
basic services to its tenants. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE WOES 
 
4. (SBU) First Vice-Chairman Nhu said that a new Mekong bridge, a 
new airport and a new port will address Can Tho\'s transport 
infrastructure problems.  Currently, people and goods get to and 
from Can Tho by a clogged, two-lane highway.  The 165-km trip 
between Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh City takes a minimum of four hours 
including the ferry ride across the Hau branch of the Mekong. 
Actual construction work on the Can Tho bridge - a USD 300 million 
plus Japanese development project, has yet to begin.  Further 
north, the My Tho bridge crosses the Tien branch of the Mekong. 
The stunning USD 70 million Australian-financed span has been open 
for several years and cuts an hour or two from the trip.     Can 
Tho\'s airport has not been used commercially with any regularity 
since 1975.  Its port can receive 10,000-ton ships and will soon 
be able to receive 20,000-ton vessels; however, the river estuary 
must be dredged continuously. 
 
SHRIMP INTERESTS PINCHED BY PRELIMINARY DUMPING DUTIES 
 
5. (SBU) Two seafood processing companies in the Can Tho area are 
already feeling the effects of preliminary dumping duties on 
shrimp announced by the U.S. in July.  State-owned Can Tho 
Agricultural and Animal Products Co. (CATACO) said its $18 million 
in annual shrimp exports have been halved.  CATACO is receiving a 
separate rate of 16 percent, much lower than the country-wide 
rate, but company officials say they cannot compete with Thai 
companies that received a duty rate of 6 percent.  Vietnam Fish- 
One, a privately-owned company subject to the country-wide rate of 
93 percent, exported $23 million in shrimp in 2003.  The company 
lost all of its U.S. business since imposition of the preliminary 
duties.  U.S. sales account for half of Vietnam Fish-One\'s revenue 
and the company foresees laying off 40 percent of its staff if the 
duties remain at current rates. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. (SBU) Can Tho is a thriving provincial center and a transit 
point for Mekong Delta agriculture.  City leaders seem focused on 
attracting traditional industry and trendy sectors like 
information technology and financial services.  They might better 
concentrate on their comparative advantage in agriculture and ag- 
related industry. 
 
7. (SBU) The GVN this year split Can Tho City from the newly- 
created Hau Giang province and elevated the former provincial 
capital to a standalone, \"centrally-administered\" status like 
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Haiphong and Danang.  Can Tho leaders 
clearly hope this elevated standing will give them greater 
authority and increased access to government funding.  It is too 
early to tell, however, whether the change in designation will 
have the desired effect.  END COMMENT.

REF:  a) HCMC 1123; b) HCMC 789 
 
1. (SBU) We spoke with Pastor Tran Mai, at home and in good health 
on September 7, and confirmed his release on September 6 after 
eight days detention.  The pastor said he was unclear as to why he 
was detained at the Cambodia/Vietnam border on August 29 (ref a). 
He stated that, as on previous occasions, he traveled to the U.S. 
through Cambodia and then sought to return to Vietnam via the same 
route.  He did note, however, that this time he sought to enter 
Vietnam using a local border gate and not at the usual 
international border crossing (from where he presumably departed 
Vietnam).  The police told him that it was illegal for him to 
enter Vietnam through a non-international border gate. 
 
2. (SBU) According to the pastor, once in custody, the police did 
not focus on his immigration violation, but on his religious 
activities.  The police pressed the pastor on his \"frequent\" 
overseas travel, which organizations were sponsoring him and 
whether he had links to groups or individuals in Cambodia -- he 
said he had none.  The police also quizzed Pastor Mai on his links 
with detained Mennonite pastor/human rights activist Nguyen Hong 
Quang as well as religious activities on the margins of the South 
East Asia sporting games \"SEA Games 22\", which Vietnam hosted in 
December 2003.  (Note:  during the SEA games, local authorities 
detained 15 Christian missionaries for distributing unauthorized 
leaflets with religious content to spectators in HCMC.  Pastor 
Tran Mai was detained for 24 hours during the police investigation 
of the incident.  Pastor Quang was arrested on June 8 at his home 
in HCMC and remains in pre-trial detention.  For more details on 
Pastor Quang\'s arrest see ref b.  End Note.) 
 
3. (SBU) The pastor said that during his detention the police 
treated him respectfully, although he was upset to be kept in the 
same facility with common criminal suspects.  He said that the 
police kept all his personal belongings including his passport, 
cell phone and Vietnamese ID card.  In a separate conversation on 
September 7, the pastor\'s wife told us that police officials had 
instructed the pastor to check in with police officials in HCMC on 
a daily basis.

SUBJECT: STAFFDEL JANNUZI FOCUSES ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN 
VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
 
REF:  a) Hanoi 2430; b) HCMC 789 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  During a visit to the Central Highland Province 
of Pleiku September 2 to 4, Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Staffer Jannuzi focused on religious freedom issues, particularly 
among the region\'s ethnic minorities.  The response of local GVN 
officials to Jannuzi\'s call for greater religious freedoms largely 
was a rehash of party rhetoric, although GVN officials did commit 
to working with local religious leaders and to \"try to recognize\" 
another five protestant churches by the end of 2004.  While 
acknowledging continued police harassment, a key protestant church 
leader told Jannuzi that he believed conditions for the Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam -- the dominant Protestant 
organization in the area -- were gradually improving.  He noted 
that \"political\" activities by the \"Dega\" house church movement 
led to the unrest in the Central Highlands in April 2004 and 
continued to complicate SECV efforts to build cooperative links 
with local GVN authorities. Mr. Jannuzi\'s discussions on other 
minority rights issues will be reported septel.  (Note: at the 
invitation of the GVN, Michael Sullivan, a U.S. journalist baed in 
Hanoi for National Public Radio, accompanied the Staffdel 
throughout the visit to Pleiku.)  End Summary. 
 
Local Government offers little new 
---------------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer Frank Jannuzi 
accompanied by HCMC PolOff visited Pleiku, administrative seat of 
the Central Highland province of Gia Lai September 2-4.  (Gia Lai 
was one of the epicenters of ethnic minority unrest in 2004 and 
2001.)  In Pleiku, Jannuzi met with Chairman of the Gia Lai 
People\'s Committee, the Deputy Director of the centrally 
administered Central Highlands Development Authority and the 
Provincial Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA).  Jannuzi 
emphasized that while the USG and U.S. Congress supported improved 
bilateral ties, the pace and depth of our relationship would 
suffer should the GVN not protect human rights.  In particular, 
restraints on the religious freedoms of the Highlands ethnic 
minorities were of growing concern to many in the United States. 
 
3. (SBU) The local GVN officials offered little that we hadn\'t 
heard before.  The GVN was committed to protect freedom of worship 
and belief but would not tolerate the use of religion as a pretext 
for anti-GVN political activity.  They repeated allegations that 
outside elements linked to now defunct \"FULRO Movement\" were using 
\"Dega Protestantism\" to spread insurrection among Montagnards (the 
catchall term for the Central Highland\'s ethnic minority groups). 
(FULRO was a Montagnard guerilla movement that continued to resist 
Hanoi\'s authority in the Central Highlands well after unification 
in 1975.  Many of its leaders served along U.S. forces in the 
Highlands during the Vietnam War.  FULRO formally ended its armed 
struggle in 1992.) 
 
4. (SBU) Somewhat more helpfully, Nguyen Thanh Cam, Deputy Chief 
of the Committee for Religious Affairs of Gia Lai, told Jannuzi 
that he had just approved applications for two new Protestant 
churches to be built in the province.  The approval process took 
one month, he claimed.  Thanh Cam told Jannuzi that he was going 
to meet \"that afternoon\" with leaders of the Southern Evangelical 
Church of Vietnam -- the province\'s leading protestant 
denomination -- to review mechanisms to ensure the smooth 
operation of their churches.  He also was hopeful that the 
committee would recognize up to five protestant congregations in 
the province by year-end.  (Comment:  overall, the local CRA 
official\'s comments were far less committal than his counterpart 
in Hanoi who told Jannuzi September 1 that seven new congregations 
would be recognized in Gia Lai province by the end of 2004 (ref 
a).) 
 
SECV: under pressure but positive 
--------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) In a two-hour private meeting with Staffdel, Pastor Siu Y 
Kim (strictly protect), head of the Southern Evangelical Church of 
Vietnam (SECV) in Gia Lai province, painted a picture of ongoing 
religious harassment from local authorities in the Highlands 
tempered by some positive steps toward cooperation and coexistence 
with the GVN.  According to Pastor Kim, of the roughly 100,000 
Protestants in Gia Lai province, 75,000 are affiliated with SECV 
churches.  15,000 belong to the 11 GVN-recognized churches in the 
province.  The other 60,000 worship in 89 different congregations 
with 474 \"gathering points.\"  Of these 75,000 worshipers, only 
1,000 are ethnic Vietnamese \"Kinh.\" 
 
6. (SBU) According to Kim, the unrecognized SECV churches face 
significant pressure from local authorities: they are under 
constant police surveillance.  The police, on occasion, disrupt 
prayer sessions and confiscate bibles.  While SECV members have 
been called into police stations for \"informative interviews,\" 
none have been arrested thus far. 
 
7. (SBU) The need for additional pastors is acute, Kim said.  The 
15 GVN-sanctioned pastors are barely sufficient to minister to the 
needs of the 15,000 parishioners in the 11 recognized churches. 
He complained that the GVN continues to limit intake of 
seminarians -- SECV/Gia Lai requested that 44 individuals be 
granted permission to attend the SECV\'s seminary in Ho Chi Minh 
City, but only 20 were okayed.  As a result, the SECV in Gia Lai 
is training 200 ministers locally without GVN approval.  He held 
out the hope that, over time, he and local authorities would find 
a way to regularize their status. 
 
8. (SBU) The pastor said that he had not yet been informed 
directly of the provincial decision to approve two new churches, 
but welcomed it as a significant gesture nonetheless.  He noted 
that Staffdel visit cut \"at least a couple of months off the 
approval process.\" That process has thus far lasted over a year, 
not the month that the local GVN official claimed.  Even with the 
CRA approval in hand, the SECV must now work to obtain building 
permits, a process, which as the pastor outlined it, is full of 
Kafkaesque bureaucratic obstacles. 
 
9. (SBU) Despite the harassment and the difficulties in dealing 
with an opaque GVN, the pastor said that progress has been made 
since the GVN recognized the SECV in 2001.  There are budding 
lines of communication and cooperation between the SECV and local 
GVN officials.  For example, the pastor said that every year he 
writes a letter to the People\'s Committee notifying them that the 
100 unrecognized house church congregations of the SECV are local 
affiliates of one of the SECV\'s 11 recognized churches.  This 
mechanism, which local authorities appear to have accepted at 
least \"de facto\" even if not \"de jure,\" has brought some relief to 
SECV worshipers in parts of the province. 
 
10. (SBU) Looking to the future, he said that the thorniest 
challenge facing the SECV will be working with the GVN to recover 
church properties expropriated after unification in 1975.  In that 
regard, he handed Staffdel a list of 31 churches and 7 other 
facilities that he maintained the GVN seized after the war.  He 
indicated that he has begun informal discussions with local 
authorities on the issue but has seen no progress thus far.  Lack 
of physical space is one of the biggest rate limiting steps to the 
expansion of the church in the Central Highlands. 
 
Tarred with the Same Brush 
-------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) Pastor Kim noted that police presence and scrutiny of 
the SECV was heaviest in localities where violence had flared in 
April of 2004 and in areas where ethnic minorities had fled to 
Cambodia.  He attributed this intense GVN scrutiny at least in 
part to the presence of \"Dega\" protestant churches in the same 
area.  According to the pastor, roughly 18,000 of the 25,000 non- 
SECV affiliated Protestants in Gia Lai province belong to the 
\"Dega\" church movement.  (The remaining 7,000 are Mennonites or 
other smaller denominations not yet recognized by the GVN, who, 
according to the pastor also face considerable harassment.) 
 
12. (SBU) According to the pastor, there are no theological 
differences between the SECV and the \"Dega\" church.  Where they 
differ is on approach.  The SECV focuses on supporting the 
spiritual needs of the people, while the Dega church deals with 
\"politics, not religion\" in its meetings and sermons.  The Dega 
church answers to a small group of leaders \"based in North 
Carolina,\" the pastor added. 
 
13. (SBU) The pastor acknowledged that local police find it 
difficult to differentiate between SECV and Dega house churches. 
This is particularly the case when persons known to police to be 
active in the Dega movement attend services in an SECV-affiliated 
facility, thus casting a cloud of suspicion over the SECV 
congregation.  Despite the additional harassment that the presence 
of Dega supporters brings, the SECV would not turn away those 
seeking God\'s word, he pastor said. 
 
14. (SBU) With regard to the April 2004 ethnic minority protests 
in the Central Highlands, the Pastor said that he was aware \"3 or 
4 days\" before the fact that Dega leaders were organizing 
protests.  He said SECV members did not participate, but were 
caught between the police and protestors as they gathered in 
villages to walk to church to attend Easter services.  He stated 
that he has credible information that 10 persons were killed in 
the unrest -- he witnessed two deaths himself.  He did not see 
protestors equipped with homemade weapons (as the GVN alleged), 
but protestors did use whatever was at hand when violence flared 
with police.  (He did not state which side initiated the 
violence.)  Other than perhaps two incidents, he was not aware of 
the police using armed force to suppress the protests. 
 
Links with other activists 
-------------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) Pastor Kim said he maintained contact with Dega and 
other groups who used the Church as a bully pulpit to speak out 
against the GVN and to press for other -- \"political\" -- causes. 
In one instance, he said that Mennonite pastor/human rights 
activist Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang sought to build a common front 
with the SECV in Gia Lai, but that he rejected the overture, 
preferring to concentrate on seeking \"God\'s help.\"  (See HCMC 789 
for additional information on Pastor Quang and his arrest in Ho 
Chi Minh City in June 2004.) 
 
The View from the Catholic Church 
--------------------------------- 
 
16. (SBU) Staffdel met separately with Father Phero Nguyen Van 
Dong, Chief Parish Priest of Pleiku (the Bishop\'s seat is in the 
nearby town of Kontum), who, despite being flanked by local GVN 
officials, made it clear that the Catholic Church was not fully 
satisfied with the treatment it received from the GVN.  Father Van 
Dong saw some promise in the new religious affairs ordinance, 
particularly in giving more room to the church to be involved in 
charitable works. 
 
17. (SBU) The Catholic Church badly needed more priests to 
minister to churchgoers, particularly to ethnic minorities, who 
comprise two thirds of the 180,000 Catholics in the province, 
Father Van Dong said.  He regretted that at least thus far the GVN 
has prohibited the Church from supporting education in the 
province -- the Church, among other initiatives, wished to open a 
vocational school for ethnic minority youth. 
 
18. (SBU) In a show of inter-denominational support, the Father 
said that the Protestant church in Gia Lai was in greater need of 
assistance, particularly to secure the return of confiscated 
property.  In his view, the shortage of GVN-approved houses of 
worship forced the faithful to gather in house churches, breeding 
suspicion in the police, who instinctively feared unauthorized 
gatherings of any kind.  He opined that the minority unrest in 
2004 and 2001 generally was not religious in nature but driven by 
economics; particularly minority demands for land and benefits 
from the GVN. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
19. (SBU) Pastor Kim is a trusted and reliable Mission contact -- 
he is well plugged into developments in ethnic minority 
communities throughout Gia Lai province and the Central Highlands. 
His private statement to Staffdel Jannuzi that Dega Church leaders 
were focusing on political issues anathema to the GVN should not 
be discounted. 
 
20. (SBU) We are not surprised that our GVN interlocutors offered 
nothing beyond some tinkering at the margins to improve the 
environment for religious activity in the Highlands.  Communist 
Party orthodoxy runs strong there even as Hanoi\'s fiat weakens. 
What was encouraging was the relative optimism of Pastor Kim and 
Staffdel\'s other religious interlocutors who outlined ways that 
they were finding ways to coexist with the GVN and slowly expand 
the space in which their congregations could operate.  As is the 
case elsewhere in Vietnam, this coexistence comes at a price.  As 
the church depends on GVN cooperation to grow and operate, the 
Communist Party can exert control over a powerful voice for 
social, political and economic justice and change.  Pastor Kim and 
others appear to be betting that their gradualist, less 
confrontational approach will, over the long term, allow them to 
minister to both the spiritual and material needs of Vietnam\'s 
people. 
 
21. (SBU) Note:  On September 8, CG and Poloff shared with Le Quoc 
Hung, Director of the HCMC External Relations Office on our 
impressions of the Jannuzi visit.  We noted that the local 
authorities were (relatively) open and supportive, particularly in 
allowing Jannuzi to meet privately with some key church leaders. 
We emphasized the importance of continuing this positive trend in 
our future dealings on the Highlands, and underscored that we 
shared Jannuzi\'s view that the GVN should permit NGO operations in 
the region.  Hung welcomed the dialogue and cautiously \"commended\" 
the idea of increased involvement of NGOs in the Highlands and the 
development of \"confidence building measures\" to ease mistrust 
over Highlands-linked issues. 
 
22. (U) Mr. Jannuzi did not have an opportunity to review this 
message.

The Office of External Relations in Ho Chi Minh City 
No.: 3553/NV/LS 
 
The Office of External Relations in Ho Chi Minh City 
presents its compliments to the Consulate General of the 
United States in Ho Chi Minh City and would like to respond 
to the Consulate General\'s diplomatic note No. 254/04 as 
follows: 
 
As the Office of External Relations explained to the 
Consulate General of the United States in diplomatic notes 
no. 3205/NV/LS, dated 12 August 2004, and no. 3241/NV/LS, 
dated 16 August 2004, regarding the case of Hoang The Lan, 
the Security Investigation Office of the Ministry of Public 
Security received a letter denouncing a number of U.S. 
passport holders as members of the terrorist organization 
\"National United Front For the Liberation of Vietnam,\" led 
by Hoang Co Dinh and Nguyen Kim in the United States, who 
had entered Vietnam to carry out terrorist and destructive 
activities. 
 
In order to clarify this denunciatory letter, the police 
invited these people to the Immigration Bureau of the 
Ministry of Public Security for discussion (not for arrest 
or temporary detention). They admitted that they were 
members of the above organization, but denied entering 
Vietnam to carry out terrorist activities. 
 
The Security Investigation Office of the Ministry of Public 
Security has investigated and confirmed that there have been 
no cases of U.S. passport holders being arrested, beaten or 
mistreated as stated in the U.S. Consulate General\'s 
diplomatic note no. 254/04.  These allegations are 
fabricated and slanderously false. 
 
The Office of External Relations in Ho Chi Minh City avails 
itself of this opportunity to renew to the Consulate General 
of the United States in Ho Chi Minh City the assurances of 
its highest consideration.

SUBJECT: SFRC STAFFER FOCUSES ON PLIGHT OF VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL 
HIGHLAND MINORITIES 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1140; B) HANOI 2594 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Paternalism, racism, bureaucratic ineptitude, 
communist orthodoxy, economic and educational marginalization, and 
war legacy issues were all on display when SFRC staffer Frank 
Jannuzi assessed the status of ethnic minorities -- Montagnards -- 
in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai September 2-4.  In 
this mix, religion is but one of many fault lines between the 
Montagnard minority and the ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) majority.  It 
was apparent that the Highland\'s Montagnards were second-class 
citizens in their traditional lands, creating an environment in 
which ethnic minority unrest and protests -- such as those that 
occurred in 2004 and 2001 -- could easily flare. 
 
2. (SBU) GVN officials told Staffdel that they are committed to 
address problems affecting Montagnards; Staffdel did see some 
efforts to close the educational and economic gap between the 
ethnic minorities and the Kinh.  However, those efforts fall far 
short of addressing the political, social, and religious 
disenfranchisement of the Montagnards.  Moreover, despite 
indications to the contrary from the GVN in Hanoi, local officials 
told Staffdel that there would be no halt to in-migration of 
ethnic Kinh to the province.  Until the GVN adopts a broader and 
more creative approach, we can expect ethnic minority tensions in 
the Highlands to fester.  End Summary 
 
3. (SBU) The status of ethnic minorities was a key focus of Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee staffer Frank Jannuzi, who, 
accompanied by HCMC PolOff visited Pleiku, administrative capital 
of the Central Highland province of Gia Lai September 2-4.  (Gia 
Lai was one of the epicenters of ethnic minority unrest in 2004 
and 2001.)  In Pleiku, Jannuzi met with Chairman of the Gia Lai 
People\'s Committee, the Deputy Director of the centrally 
administered Central Highlands Development Authority and the 
Provincial Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA).  Jannuzi also 
met with the Directors of state-owned coffee and rubber 
plantations as well as the Chairman of the largest privately owned 
company in the province.  Staffdel also visited two Montagnard 
communities, albeit in the constant company of GVN officials. 
(Note: at the invitation of the GVN, Michael Sullivan, a U.S. 
journalist for National Public Radio based in Hanoi, accompanied 
the Staffdel throughout the visit to Pleiku.)  Ref a reports in 
more detail on freedom of religion issues raised during the 
Staffdel visit. 
 
Separate and unequal 
-------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Over the past 15 years, GVN-planned and spontaneous 
migration of ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) and the explosion of cash 
crop cultivation -- coffee, rubber, and pepper -- have transformed 
the demographics and the economy of the region.  Once an 
overwhelming majority, GVN officials told us that the Montagnards 
now comprise no more than 45 percent of the population in the 
province.  Economic and demographic pressures and competition for 
land have forced them to abandon their traditional semi-nomadic, 
slash and burn agricultural lifestyle.  The Chairman of the 
People\'s Committee told Staffdel that 85 percent of Montagnards 
are settled in fixed settlements scattered throughout the 
province. 
 
5. (SBU) The Staffdel visit underscored how little Montagnards 
have benefited from changes in the region.  Physically, they 
largely remain isolated from the Kinh majority.  Even the 
Montagnard village that the GVN sought to showcase to Staffdel was 
moldering, backward and set far from major roads, shops, schools 
and jobs (and the Kinh).  In general, the three Montagnard 
villages that PolOff visited (two with Staffdel were clustered 
near the rice fields and cash crop plantations in which they work. 
 
6. (SBU) Educationally, the ethnic Minorities appeared to lag far 
behind their Kinh counterparts.  Many Montagnards spoke only 
limited Vietnamese at best; the directors of the rubber plantation 
and privately owned furniture factory told Staffdel that some of 
their Montagnard hires were illiterate.  Both companies were 
forced to run in-house training programs to bring ethnic minority 
hires up to minimum standards.  In contrast, Kinh migrants had 
adequate educational skills; one young Vietnamese Kinh told 
Staffdel that he had recently migrated to Pleiku from Northern 
Vietnam and was able to find well paying employment in a local 
factory.  He added that Montagnard hires in his firm \"usually 
don\'t work out\" because of cultural and educational differences. 
 
7. (SBU) Economically, the Montagnards lag behind the Kinh, in 
part because of their educational backwardness, in part because of 
past GVN neglect.  In the fields, they have not been able to apply 
more sophisticated agricultural techniques, thus earning less than 
their Kinh counterparts.  In the companies of the region, the 
Montagnards hold the bulk of the low-skill, low-pay jobs.  In 
Montagnard villages, the local kiosks are owned and run by Kinh 
migrants who return to Kinh-majority areas at night.  Staffdel was 
told repeatedly that the Montagnard\'s lacked the educational 
skills, financial savvy and capital needed to move up the economic 
ladder. 
 
8. (SBU) Local GVN officials acknowledged the economic disparity 
between Kinh and Montagnards.  They noted that it created a 
vicious cycle in which the Kinh, out-earning the Montagnards, use 
their profits to buy land from the Montagnards.  Over the long- 
term, this phenomenon exacerbates the ethnic minorities economic 
plight and sense of dispossession. 
 
New economic pressures ahead? 
----------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Shifts in the cash crops business also foreshadow new 
pressures on those at the bottom of the economic ladder in the 
highlands.  The director of a major state-owned coffee plantation 
told Staffdel that, in response to depressed world prices for 
Robusta coffee -- caused at least in part by over-planting in 
Vietnam --the company might be forced to restructure.  Their plans 
calls for shedding direct-hire labor and land, outsourcing 
cultivation and focusing on higher value-added activities such as 
processing and distribution.  While not stated explicitly, it was 
clear that the bulk of the 30-35 percent of the company\'s 2,000 
employees that were ethnic minorities hold those low skill jobs 
that could be lost.  The director proffered that released workers 
would be offered coffee leaseholds, but they would be required to 
sell their product back to the company in an exclusive contract. 
 
10. (SBU) A similar phenomenon appears to be occurring at the 
large state-owned rubber plantation.  Even at this relatively 
progressive and expanding company -- two thirds of the 1800 direct- 
hire employees are Montagnard -- a local ethnic minority villager 
told Staffdel that the company froze permanent hires.  The company 
is now only employing contract labor, at monthly wages that are 
almost half that of the average direct-hire salary. 
 
11. (SBU) The ethnic Minorities also were politically under- 
represented.  All the leading GVN and economic figures that met 
with Staffdel were ethnic Kinh.  Most of them were migrants from 
provinces outside the Central Highlands. 
 
12. (SBU) Religion also reflects the minority/majority divide. 
Protestantism essentially is a minority religion.  According to a 
trusted church contact, at least 90 percent of the province\'s 
100,000 Protestants are ethnic minorities.  Similarly, the chief 
Parish Priest of the Catholic Church in Pleiku told Staffdel that 
two thirds of the 180,000 Catholics in the province are 
Montagnard. 
 
The GVN:  we are working on it 
------------------------------ 
 
13. (SBU) Deputy Chairman Ha of the centrally administered Central 
Highlands Development Authority told Staffdel that the GVN 
launched programs to address the educational and employment 
disadvantages of the Montagnards in the early 1990s.  He said 
that, recently, Hanoi has become seized of the matter and became 
\"very strongly determined to solve\" these issues, even though the 
Montagnards \"obsolete traditions and rituals\" hindered progress. 
He and other local officials highlighted: 
 
-- agricultural extension programs focused at assisting ethnic 
minorities to improve staple food yields, 
-- priority land distribution for Montagnards; 
-- a separate system of subsidized boarding schools for Montagnard 
children, and, 
-- preferential admission into local universities. 
 
14. (SBU) However, beyond limited educational and economic 
measures, there was little new in the GVN pitch.  They maintained 
that \"outside reactionary forces\" from \"FULRO\" and the \"Dega 
Protestant\" movement were exploiting and magnifying minority 
discontent to foment anti-GVN and separatist activities.  (FULRO 
was a Montagnard guerilla movement that continued to resist 
Hanoi\'s authority in the Central Highlands well after unification 
in 1975.  FULRO formally ended its armed struggle in 1992.) 
 
No end to in-migration 
---------------------- 
 
15. (SBU) Every GVN official made it clear that, despite 
indications to the contrary in Hanoi (ref b), there would be no 
halt to in-migration of ethnic Kinh to the Highlands.  They 
explained that each province had a GVN-approved \"master migration 
plan\" that guided local leaders on land allocation and subsidies 
to GVN-approved migrants. They indicated that GVN-supported 
migrants receive subsidies of 5,000,000 Dong (USD 315) per hectare 
of GVN-allocated land that they clear.   According to the Chairman 
of the Gia Lai People\'s Committee Pham The Dung, the province 
needed another 400,000 migrants to \"fulfill its economic 
potential.\" 
 
16. (SBU) Dung sought to make a distinction between planned, GNV- 
supported migration and \"spontaneous\" migration outside the plan. 
According to Dung, some 50,000 to 70,000 Kinh migrants have 
settled in Gia Lai in recent years.  He explained that, these 
migrants have been a significant source of friction with the 
Montagnards, as they tend to encroach on \"vacant\" lands that the 
ethnic Minorities consider theirs.  Nonetheless, local authorities 
would take no action to expel them or to deter them from settling 
by denying them residency permits.  The People\'s Committee 
Chairman concluded that, despite the friction they cause, the 
province needed their labor to \"fulfill our potential.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
17.  (SBU) The good news is that even local authorities, which in 
the past have denied that anything in the province was amiss, now 
recognize that they have a serious problem on their hands.  The 
bad news is that their solution -- educational and economic 
solutions based on party-approved economic plans -- will do little 
to address the root causes of ethnic minority disaffection.  Real 
change will require policy-making creativity, a willingness to 
provide ethnic minorities with a real voice in decisions that 
affect the province, including migration, tolerance and respect 
for minority culture -- including religion -- and a willingness to 
partner with NGOs and other international organizations to bring 
in vital development expertise and funding.

SUBJECT: Vietnam Adoptions: Baseline Study of Orphanages 
Showing Some Early Surprises 
 
1. Summary: While the USG and the GVN continue to work on 
restarting adoptions of Vietnamese orphans by Amcits, 
AmConGen HCMC has begun a baseline study of local 
orphanages.  The study is intended to determine how many 
adoptable orphans are likely to be available to U.S. 
prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) when adoptions resume, 
and to gauge how well Vietnam is currently handling the 
adoption process.  Preliminary results indicate that the 
number of healthy abandoned infants is significantly lower 
than what might have been expected based on the number of 
petitions for orphan infants processed by Post prior to 
1993.  Results also indicate that the number of foreign 
adoptions being processed (primarily by the French, who have 
a bilateral adoption agreement with Vietnam) is extremely 
low, a fact that orphanages blame on GVN adoption 
procedures.  We intend to continue this study in more 
distant provinces of Vietnam, but will require TDY/WAE 
assistance in order to do so.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------- 
Goals/Method of the Study 
------------------------- 
 
2. Adoptions of Vietnamese orphans by Amcit PAPs have been 
suspended since January 2003, following the GVN\'s 
promulgation of Decree 68, which was intended to regularize 
and centralize adoption procedures in an attempt to stem the 
rampant corruption and baby-selling that had long plagued 
adoptions in Vietnam.  Because adoptions are currently 
suspended, we reasoned that orphanages are likely to contain 
only genuine orphans - there simply isn\'t any financial 
incentive at the moment for anyone to buy or sell children 
and launder them through orphanages.  As such, we surmised 
that a survey of orphanages at this time would provide a 
good baseline estimate of the number and ages of healthy 
orphans likely to be available to Amcit PAPs under a \"clean\" 
adoption system. 
 
3. The primary purpose of the survey, therefore, is to 
gather information on the number of children at each 
orphanage, and particularly the number of healthy infants 
(aged 12 months and under).  The reason for the focus on 
healthy infants is that prior to the adoption moratorium, 
the vast majority of orphan petitions processed here were 
for healthy (non-special needs) infants under one year of 
age.  For example, post processed 66 orphan petitions in 
January 2002; all but five were for children under 12 months 
old.  In February 2002, only 13 of 47 cases were for 
children over one year old.  In March 2002, only nine of 76 
total cases were for children over 12 months old.  This 
trend is consistent for other months and years as well. 
 
4. There are two secondary goals of the survey.  The first 
is to discover which U.S.-based adoption agencies had been 
active in particular orphanages, and to hear the orphanage 
employees\' opinions on how well they had worked together. 
The second is to gauge how well the Vietnamese side of the 
adoption process is currently working (by asking orphanages 
what they thought about the process) and to get a sense of 
what effect the France-Vietnam bilateral adoption agreement 
might be having on adoptions between those two countries. 
 
5. To carry out the initial phase of the survey, Fraud 
Prevention Manager (FPM) paid unannounced visits to six 
orphanages in southern Vietnam in August 2004.  The 
orphanages selected were among those at which many orphan 
petition beneficiaries had been abandoned, according to 
their documentation, prior to the implementation of Decree 
68.  We hoped that unannounced visits, as opposed to 
officially arranged tours, would reduce the opportunity 
anyone might have to try to manipulate the results. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Where Have All the Orphans Gone? 
-------------------------------- 
 
6. The total number of healthy (i.e., non-special needs) 
infant children observed at the six orphanages was 
approximately 120.  This number is oddly low, particularly 
considering the number of orphan petitions previously 
processed by post.  Looking back at the first three months 
of 2002, for example, post processed 162 orphan petitions 
for newborns aged 12 months or younger.  If similar numbers 
were being processed now, it would appear that the number of 
available newborns would be quickly depleted.  In addition, 
one would expect that orphanage populations would show a 
\"bulge\" of children aged 2-3 years as a result of the 21- 
month suspension of U.S. adoptions, but there were virtually 
no children seen in that age range in any of the 
institutions visited. 
 
7. One interesting phenomenon seen during the visits was 
that the official populations of some orphanages did not 
match the number of children FPM actually observed.  For 
example, Tam Binh Orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City said that it 
housed 253 children under the age of 18 months.  During the 
tour, however, FPM observed only about 75 children in that 
age range, and saw no empty rooms, cribs or other indicators 
that some of the children might be elsewhere.  Another 
inexplicable disparity in numbers of children was seen at 
the Ba Ria Vung Tau Orphanage, where a staff member said 
that they had no children under the age of 12 months.  One 
of the orphans, however, told FPM that there were 10 
newborns at the orphanage.  FPM was not allowed to tour the 
facility, and so could not verify which account was true. 
 
8. One of the strangest cases was at the Dong Nai Orphanage. 
FPM spoke with a Catholic nun, Pham Thi Men, who had 
volunteered at the orphanage for several years.  She said 
that prior to December 2002, the orphanage had housed \"many\" 
healthy newborns.  In a change that mysteriously coincided 
with the halt in adoptions from the U.S., however, the 
orphanage stopped housing healthy children altogether, and 
now housed only about 60 disabled and other special needs 
children.  Sister Men could not explain why this change had 
occurred when it did, and was vague on what had happened to 
the healthy children previously housed at the orphanage, 
though she said some of them had been moved to another 
facility nearby.  FPM visited that facility, the Bien Hoa 
Orphanage, and discovered that some children had indeed been 
relocated there, but not nearly as many as had previously 
lived at Dong Nai. 
 
-------------------------------- 
Adoptions Stalled By Bureaucracy 
-------------------------------- 
 
9. Despite the fact that five countries have bilateral 
agreements with Vietnam which allow their citizens to adopt 
Vietnamese children, the six orphanages toured by FPM 
reported a total of only 19 foreign adoptions over the 
previous six months, all involving PAPs from France. (France 
and Vietnam signed a bilateral adoption many years ago, 
after France had unilaterally suspended adoptions from 
Vietnam due to fraud concerns.)  Of this small number, 
several cases had still not been completed.  At three of the 
orphanages, administrators explained that a number of 
bureaucratic impediments made completing foreign adoptions 
very difficult. 
 
10. Most problematic, they said, was the GVN\'s requirement 
that, before an adoption can be approved, provincial 
authorities contact the birth parents of a child to 
ascertain whether the child had been abandoned.  These 
investigations are supposed to be conducted by provincial 
justice departments, but the justice departments have 
instead tasked the orphanages themselves to conduct the 
investigations.  The orphanages FPM visited were short- 
staffed, and considered it an extreme hardship to send a 
staff member to find a child\'s birth parents.  Moreover, in 
many cases, what little information they had about the birth 
parents\' whereabouts was inaccurate.  In other cases, the 
address of the birth parents was known, but was very distant 
from the orphanage.  In those cases, the orphanages would 
write to local police to request their help in contacting 
the birth parents.  The orphanages complained, however, that 
the police often fail to respond to their requests.  As a 
result of these problems, the few adoption cases that get 
started often become stalemated. 
 
---------------------------------------- 
U.S. Adoption Agencies Viewed Positively 
---------------------------------------- 
 
11. Of the six orphanages visited, four expressed positive 
views about the U.S.-based adoption agencies with which they 
had previously worked.  Tam Binh Orphanage in Ho Chi Minh 
City said they had worked with several agencies.  Go Vap 
Orphanage, also in Ho Chi Minh City, had worked with World 
Child and Hope International, and had only positive things 
to say about the help they had previously received from 
those groups.  Dong Nai Orphanage had also worked with 
numerous adoption agencies, and had no complaints.  Tra Vinh 
Orphanage in Tra Vinh Province had worked exclusively with 
International Mission of Hope (an agency investigated 
extensively in the past by both INS and the GVN), and the 
director expressed hope that he would be able to resume 
working with them if and when adoptions from the U.S. 
resumed.  Interestingly, Ba Ria Vung Tau Orphanage claimed 
never to have worked with an adoption agency from the U.S., 
but benches and chairs on the orphanage grounds were 
inscribed \"Compliments of Hope International\". 
 
--------------------------------- 
Comment, and a Plea For Resources 
--------------------------------- 
 
12. Thus far, the orphanage visits have shown some 
surprising results, particularly in the low overall numbers 
of healthy infants, the inconsistencies between official 
numbers of children and those actually observed to be 
residing at the orphanage, and the difficulties reported by 
orphanages in processing adoptions under Vietnam\'s current 
regulations.  Post plans to continue to tour several more 
orphanages in other areas of Vietnam in order to further 
nail down a reliable baseline.  In particular, several 
provinces in central and northern Vietnam (Danang, Thai 
Nguyen, Bac Thai, Ha Tay, and Hanoi) have orphanages from 
which many orphan petition beneficiaries originated, 
including numerous problem cases involving allegations of 
baby selling and official corruption.  As part of the 
survey, post will also examine old IV records to compare 
current realities against past trends. 
 
13. HCMC and Hanoi will discuss how best to survey the 
orphanages in Hanoi\'s consular district, but right now it 
would seem that the best strategy would be for the surprise 
visits to be carried out by HCMC\'s FPM (Mission Vietnam\'s 
only full-time fraud officer), accompanied by a Hanoi-based 
FSN.  This would allow Hanoi\'s small consular staff to 
continue to focus on meetings with the GVN in preparation 
for A/S Harty\'s upcoming mid-October visit. 
 
14. In order to complete this baseline study in a timely 
fashion - preferably prior to A/S Harty\'s arrival - post 
will require TDY/WAE assistance, and will request such 
assistance in accordance with CA/EX guidelines.  Even with 
two TDY/WAE officers currently assisting here, CONS/HCMC is 
still short three officers, and that shortfall will increase 
once the current TDY/WAEers depart.  The problem is 
exacerbated by the fact that post\'s FPM is also acting ACS 
officer until the arrival of the new ACS chief in late 
October.  Post requests that CA provide resources so that 
post can complete this important step on the road to 
resumption of adoptions from Vietnam.

REF:  A) HANOI  2625;  B) HCMC 1077 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Media coverage and official reaction in 
Southern Vietnam to the decision to designate Vietnam a Country of 
Particular Concern (CPC) has been muted.  While the HCMC press 
faithfully carried Hanoi-issued editorials on CPC, there was no 
\"piling on,\" i.e., no effort to supplement with locally produced 
material.  CPC coverage was relegated to the papers\' inside pages 
while the visit of Washington State Governor Locke and the 
continuing Agent Orange campaign were front-page news.  Similarly, 
despite numerous opportunities to focus on CPC in official 
meetings, reactions of our interlocutors were either extremely 
mild or nonexistent.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Media coverage in HCMC of the IRF report and Vietnam\'s

simply provided straight reporting of Vietnam News Agency press 
releases.  (Note: VNA is directly controlled and operated by GVN 
and serves to release statements by government ministries and mass 
organizations.  End note).  To date, only one locally-produced 
editorial denouncing the CPC decision has appeared in any HCMC 
newspaper, and that came from the Cong An Daily (Police), a paper 
that serves as the mouthpiece for the Ministry of Public Security 
and which is known to generally level the harshest criticism at 
U.S. policy.   While Hanoi papers have printed daily interviews 
with religious dignitaries defending Vietnam\'s religious policies 
(Ref A - Hanoi 2625), to date only one HCMC paper, Nguoi Lao Dong 
(Laborer), has carried a similar interview. 
 
3. (SBU) In contrast to CPC, a trade mission led by Washington 
State Governor Gary Locke received broad, positive, front-page 
coverage in nearly all of the major dailies and prominent inside 
coverage by Saigon Giai Phong, the Communist Party\'s official 
paper in the South.  The ongoing GVN-sponsored campaign on Agent 
Orange (Ref B - HCMC 1077) also eclipsed CPC here.  In recent days 
all coverage of the CPC decision has virtually disappeared from 
HCMC papers. 
 
4. (SBU) Subdued reaction to CPC was also the norm in ConGen\'s 
official meetings and private conversations.  Typical was a 
meeting the day of the designation, when the only comment on CPC 
by a senior member of the Communist Party in HCMC to PolOff was 
that while the decision was regrettable, the bilateral 
relationship was still positive on many other fronts.  He then 
shifted the discussion to internal party politics.  Other 
officials have opted to avoid the topic altogether.  In a meeting 
on September 22nd with the Director of the Department of Culture 
and Information, the CG provided numerous openings yet absolutely 
no mention of CPC was made.  Similarly, as PAO met with various 
officials in the Mekong Delta last week, the subject was never 
broached.  This is in stark contrast to the incessant `demarches\' 
PAS received at all official meetings in Danang following the 
House passage of the Vietnam Human Rights Act (HR 1587) in July. 
 
5. (SBU) When our interlocutors sought to discuss CPC, their focus 
appeared to be more on damage limitation than on hectoring.  One 
official at the HCMC External Relations Office told us that he 
feared that CPC would be exploited by hardliners in the GVN who 
want to obstruct further progress in bilateral ties.  He sought 
guidance as to what the GVN could do to get its views on issues of 
religion out to the U.S. decision makers more effectively and how 
the GVN might avoid sanctions.  He fretted that hardliners would 
particularly benefit were the U.S. to impose sanctions, as the GVN 
\"would be forced to retaliate.\"

SUBJECT: VIETNAM ADOPTIONS BASELINE STUDY -- Danang 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1187 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: ConGen HCMC extended its baseline study of 
Vietnamese orphanages to Danang during a recent visit by CG and 
Consulate team.    We found that one Danang orphanage has 
continued to receive funding from an American adoption agency, 
despite the suspension of adoptions and in return is \"reserving\" 
potentially adoptable children.  Conversations with an American 
NGO director confirmed information given to Post from other 
sources regarding some of the in-country costs associated with 
international adoptions.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On October 1 Conoff paid an unannounced visit on the 
Rehabilitation Center for Malnourished Orphans in Danang and spoke 
with Ms. Nguyen Thi Anh Dao, director of the orphanage.  Dao 
stated that Americans had adopted from her orphanage in the past 
and that her orphanage was the only one in the Danang region 
licensed to process international adoptions.  Dao stated that the 
orphanage was responsible for 26 children at the orphanage plus 11 
other children who were living in foster care with Vietnamese 
families.  All of the children were under five years old and 12 
were under one year old.  Once the children at the orphanage 
reached age six, they were moved to a nearby boarding school for 
orphans.  However, on a tour of the orphanage, Conoff directly 
observed only 14 children: five healthy children between the ages 
of 12 months and 24 months old; eight healthy children under 12 
months old, including four infants under two months old; and one 
special needs child age seven.  Dao stated that three children 
were currently at a local hospital receiving treatment for birth 
defects.  When Dao was later asked to account for the other nine 
children, she changed her statement and said there were actually 
six children currently at a local hospital and added that the 
remaining six children stayed in foster homes each morning. 
 
3. (SBU) Dao stated that the orphanage sought first to return 
children to their natural parents.  If this is not possible, then 
they preferred to arrange domestic adoptions by Vietnamese 
nationals.  Finally, international adoptions were the last option. 
Regarding international adoptions, Dao stated that she only worked 
with American adoption agencies, despite the fact that Amcits had 
not been able to adopt Vietnamese orphans in nearly two years. 
She stated that she had worked with Danish, Canadian, and French 
agencies in the past, but they refused to provide annual follow-up 
reports about each child, which the Americans had agreed to do. 
Therefore, she had ended her relationship with other agencies and 
only worked with American agencies. 
 
4. (SBU) Dao stated that her orphanage had a \"commitment\" to work 
only with Holt International, an American adoption agency.  When 
pressed about the exact nature of their \"commitment,\" she stated 
that Holt had signed an agreement to provide 470 million Vietnam 
dong (nearly 30,000 USD) to the orphanage this year.  They had 
signed similar agreements since 1992 and expected to receive 
support in the future.  Dao emphasized that the money was actually 
given to the local People\'s Committee and was used to support her 
orphanage and a local community center for senior citizens.  She 
must submit receipts for actual expenses to the People\'s Committee 
to receive reimbursement.  Any excess money not spent on actual 
expenses remains with the local Department of Finance at the end 
of the year.  The annual budget for the orphanage ranges from 
300,000,000 to 470,000,000 VND.  Dao was adamant that none of this 
money was ever given to birth mothers and stated that the majority 
of the children under her care had been abandoned at birth at 
local hospitals. 
 
5. (SBU) As part of the \"commitment\" with Holt, the orphanage 
continues to send referrals and pictures of orphans to Holt to 
distribute to PAPs in the U.S.  Currently, Dao had identified nine 
children who would be adopted by named Americans as soon as the 
moratorium on adoptions is lifted.  Some of the PAPs had already 
visited their prospective children, and they regularly send 
birthday and Christmas cards to the children they have agreed to 
adopt.  Conoff verified that these \"agreements\" were entered into 
after the moratorium on adoptions was announced in mid-2002 and 
both the Department and the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City 
had issued announcements urging PAPs not to enter into agreements 
with adoption agencies to adopt in Vietnam. (NOTE:  Since 
adoptions by Americans were suspended on January 1, 2003, Post has 
received notification from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
Services that they have approved 12 orphan petitions for Americans 
to adopt named children.)  Dao stated that she would hold the 
children for the Americans to adopt until they reached age ten. 
 
6. (SBU) Dao appeared to be a credible interlocutor who believed 
that she was doing right by the children under her care.  Although 
she did not reveal the exact dollar amount given to the orphanage 
by Holt International until pressed to do so, she readily 
disclosed the relationship and did not seem to feel it was in any 
way inappropriate.  She expressed confidence that she was working 
within the framework of current Vietnamese law.  However, she was 
unable to explain why she had agreed to hold nine children 
indefinitely for American parents when her orphanage\'s stated 
policy was to place children domestically first. 
 
7. (SBU) In a separate meeting, the Consul General met with Mr. 
Mark Conroy, former USAID officer and current Director of the East 
Meets West (EMW) Foundation working in Danang, Vietnam.  Conroy 
has over ten years of experience working in Vietnam and his 
organization has founded several orphanages in central Vietnam. 
While EMW does not facilitate international adoptions, Conroy is 
familiar with the issue and has experience managing orphanages in 
Vietnam. 
8. (SBU) Conroy stated that EMW budgets 300 to 400 USD per year to 
support each child living in its orphanages.  They budget 
approximately 250 USD per year to support a child to remain with 
her/his family or with relatives; this money then supports all 
those living in the child\'s home.  Conroy strongly favored 
spending funds to keep children with their families as opposed to 
spending more money to support the same child deposited by the 
family for care in an orphanage.   Comment:  According to Conroy\'s 
figures, the 30,000 USD given to the Danang People\'s Committee to 
support Dao\'s orphanage is far more than the amount actually 
required to support the 26 children living there and the 11 
children in foster care. End Comment 
 
9. (SBU) Conroy stated that birth mothers often received money 
from adoptive parents or agencies in the U.S. when they give their 
children up for adoption.  He stated that the money was given \"to 
help get the mother on her feet again\" and was often only a few 
hundred dollars.  We pressed him for his views on this issue since 
he has both years of experience in the region and no direct 
interest in overseas adoptions.  Conroy thought that the dividing 
line between assistance and \"baby buying\" was somewhere between 
USD400 and USD500, the latter figure being about twice the annual 
income in the region. 
 
10. (SBU) Conroy told us that colleagues in the region working for 
the International Red Cross said that the Red Cross received about 
1,500 USD to process international adoptions for Canadian 
citizens.  Of that amount, roughly 500 USD was spent obtaining 
required paperwork from GVN authorities and 100 to 500 USD was 
given to the birth mother, if identified.  Conroy emphasized that 
this was only a small fraction of the 10,000 to 30,000 USD total 
charged to PAPs by adoption agencies in the U.S. and Canada. 
Conroy\'s views were consistent with what post has heard from other 
sources regarding the costs associated with international adoption 
and the fees charged to PAPs by adoption agencies.

SUBJECT: RELIGIOUS ISSUES IN DANANG 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  During a visit to Danang September 30 and 
October 1, religious leaders from GVN-recognized Catholic and 
Protestant denominations painted a picture of provincial 
leadership that is tolerant of organized religion.  While 
bemoaning their lack of \"complete religious freedom,\" they told us 
their situation is getting \"easier everyday.\"  Church leaders were 
skeptical that the new religious ordinance would create major 
improvements when it comes into effect on November 15, but neither 
did they think that it would constrain their activities.  A new 
SECV initiative to train 600 new pastors in their local 
jurisdictions is awaiting GVN approval.  The apparent key to 
church leaders\' success in Danang is their effort to reach out to 
local GVN leaders -- from the village level on up -- and to 
demonstrate that they pose no threat to continued Communist Party 
rule.  In return for what appears to be largely pro forma 
acknowledgments of Party authority, Church leaders are relatively 
free to go about their business.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) During the visit of CG and a ConGen HCMC team to Danang 
September 30 and October 1, PolOff met with Pastor Nguyen The 
Binh, Head of the Danang Southern Evangelical Conference of 
Vietnam, and Father Tran Quoc Viet, a senior priest in the office 
of the Danang and Quang Nam Bishop\'s diocese, to review the status 
of the Protestant and Catholic Churches in Danang.   Meetings with 
local GVN officials and reporting on economic and consular issues 
are covered septel. 
 
The Danang Protestant Community 
------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Pastor Nguyen The Binh, head of the Southern Evangelical 
Church of Vietnam (SECV) chapter in Danang (strictly protect), 
told us that the GVN-recognized Protestant community in Danang had 
a positive relationship with local authorities.  The Danang SECV 
has not experienced limitations on its freedom to assemble and 
worship -- the 10,000-strong SECV community routinely gathers 
without incident in 11 GVN-sanctioned churches.  The pastor added 
that this past August, the local chapter of the SECV also 
organized a 3-day region-wide conference that attracted some 4,000 
believers, including ethnic minorities.  According to the pastor, 
the SECV did not have to seek permission from local authorities to 
hold the conference, but merely had to \"register\" the activity 
with the People\'s Committee and the local Committee for Religious 
Affairs (CRA).  In general, the Danang SECV notifies local 
authorities with a list of its planned activities once a year. 
 
4. (SBU) Pastor Binh told us that there has been some recent 
movement in addressing his biggest concern:  the shortage of GVN- 
recognized pastors in Danang.  Currently there are only 8 pastors 
authorized to cover the 11 churches in the Danang SECV community. 
According to the pastor, there is a pending agreement between the 
GVN and the SECV to allow local SECV chapters to provide \"in- 
service\" training for pastors in the provinces in lieu of sending 
trainees to the SECV seminary in Ho Chi Minh City.  (In practice, 
these \"trainees\" have been working unofficially in local 
communities already.)   According to the pastor, Danang will 
receive 10 of the 600 slots that the SECV national leadership 
might be allocated for an in-service program. 
 
5. (SBU) Separately, Tran Ngoc Du of the SECV National Board in 
HCMC confirmed that the SECV in August submitted a proposal to the 
GVN requesting approval for \"in-service\" training courses for 600 
pastor-candidates now ministering unofficially in the 34 provinces 
in which the SECV functions.  The duration of the course would be 
three months.  According to Du, Danang province would receive 15 
of those slots; the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai would be 
granted 30 in-service training slots.  The SECV anticipates a GVN 
reply to its proposal by the end of 2004. 
 
6. (SBU) Pastor Binh told us that he meets at least quarterly with 
the local CRA.  He characterized the CRA as accessible and his 
meetings as relaxed and open.  However, the CRA has not yet 
briefed the SECV on the new religious ordinance, because, the 
pastor believes, local authorities have not yet received 
implementation instructions from Hanoi.  The pastor does not 
anticipate that the ordinance will bring significant changes to 
what he says is a favorable relationship with the GVN.  He is 
concerned, however, that without uniform instructions, local 
authorities elsewhere in Vietnam will continue to interpret rules 
government religious practice as they please, perpetuating 
problems where problems exist today. 
 
7. (SBU) Also problematic was the local authorities refusal to 
resolve satisfactorily issues of expropriated church property. 
Pastor Binh said there were a number of properties in Danang that 
the GVN expropriated post 1975.  Discussions on compensation have 
not been fruitful. 
 
8. (SBU) Pastor Binh said that there is a small -- \"few hundreds\" 
-- house church movement in Danang operating under the umbrella of 
the hitherto unrecognized Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship (VEF). 
Binh said that, as far as he was aware, these worshipers gather in 
large groups every Sunday without incident or police harassment. 
He added that two local VEF-affiliated churches recently 
petitioned the GVN for recognition. 
 
Catholic Church 
--------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Father Tran Quoc Viet, a senior representative of the 
Bishop of Danang and Quang Nam provinces (strictly protect) told 
us that the situation today for the 60,000 Catholic believers was 
far improved from a decade ago.  The 70 priests in the diocese 
were sufficient to minister to the faithful.  Urban areas in the 
diocese are particularly free from acrimony as local authorities 
are more used to worshipers congregating in large numbers. 
 
10. (SBU) Father Viet said that problems remain in the 
countryside, particularly among police and especially in areas 
where the Church is reaching out to new parishioners.  He said 
that even here there has been some progress.  He related an 
incident in which local Ministry of Public Security officials in 
an ethnic-minority area of Quang Nam province sought to prevent 
Church activity in the region.  However, after two years of 
dialogue and cajoling, he was able to win their acquiescence.  The 
key, he said, was that the police were reassured that the Church 
activities were not designed to incite anti-Hanoi sentiments among 
the Montagnards. 
 
11. (SBU) Father Viet said that the new ordinance on religion 
would do little to bring Vietnam to a \"true state\" of religious 
freedom, which he defined as the pre-1975 status where the 
Catholic Church was free of all state controls.  Any progress 
depended on the yet-to-be-issued implementation guidelines.  The 
Danang/Quang Nam diocese also was highly dissatisfied with the 
GVN\'s nickel-and-dime approach to compensation of the Church 
property expropriated in 1975.  In his view, other dioceses, 
particularly HCMC, have made more progress toward recovering or 
being compensated fairly for expropriated property. 
 
Comment:  Lessons Learned 
------------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) The message from the GVN-recognized Christian community 
in Danang was the most positive we have heard in southern Vietnam 
thus far.  What seems to set Danang apart from other provinces is 
the good personal and institutional relationship between the 
protestant and Catholic Churches and local authorities. 
 
13. (SBU) The SECV\'s Vietnam roots are in Danang -- its mother 
church was founded here in 1911 and the current SECV head 
representative has been working with Danang authorities for over 
30 years.  Similarly, the Catholic Church is a known commodity and 
familiarity breeds acceptance.  Equally important, Danang church 
leaders appear to have a taken a long-term approach to build trust 
with local officials.  Their view is that by showing some measure 
of fealty to the State -- working through the system and assuaging 
the paranoia of local leaders that they will use religion to 
weaken the hold of the Communist Party -- they receive cooperation 
and some measure of autonomy in return.

SUBJECT: EB PDAS DONNELLY MEETS WITH HCMC TEXTILE 
REPRESENTATIVES 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  During his September 29 visit to Ho 
Chi Minh City, EB Bureau PDAS Donnelly met 
representatives of Vietnam\'s textile and apparel 
industry to discuss Vietnam\'s competitiveness following 
expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and 
Clothing (ATC) and Vietnam\'s bid for WTO accession. 
The textile reps noted that foreign garment buying 
companies see Vietnam as a counterbalance to China, but 
the uncertainty surrounding Vietnam\'s WTO accession 
makes planning difficult.  The reps urged the USG to 
reevaluate quota categories to improve Vietnam\'s 
competitiveness between the end of the ATC and 
Vietnam\'s WTO accession.  They observed that there are 
numerous categories of garments under quota are not 
produced in the U.S.  The reps also asked to borrow a 
small percentage of quota to address imbalances created 
by lowering quota levels earlier this year.  Donnelly 
told the group the GVN needed to make some tough 
decisions on WTO accession if it wants to accede in a 
timeframe that benefits the textile industry.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Visiting EB PDAS Shaun Donnelly met 
representatives of local textile businesses, foreign 
companies, state-owned enterprises and textile 
associations in a roundtable at the Consulate General. 
The Chairman of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel 
Association (VITAS), Mr. Le Quoc An, stated that 
Vietnam has tried to produce more non-quota textile 
items in a bid to compete in the coming quota-free 
world; however, quota items still are in the highest 
demand.  Companies continue to receive large orders 
from U.S. buyers even though Vietnam has already 
shipped 97 percent of the allotted quota for this year. 
Mr. An acknowledged that Vietnam\'s accession to the WTO 
would not only provide benefits in the textile and 
garment sectors, but also in the services and financial 
sectors.  He went on to explain that VITAS believes the 
GVN should \"hurry\" to get into the WTO.  \"We need the 
U.S. Government\'s and the U.S. business community\'s 
assistance in this accession,\" he stated.  In the 
meantime, he requested assistance to borrow a small 
percentage of quota to cover goods that were ordered 
before quota levels were lowered earlier this year, but 
that are now stuck in U.S. ports because they arrived 
following the reduction in quota. 
 
3. (SBU) Ms. Jocelyn Tran from MAST Industries, a 
subsidiary of Limited Brands, stressed that Vietnamese 
and U.S. businesses cannot afford to adopt a \"wait and 
see\" attitude toward the outcome of Vietnam\'s bid for 
WTO accession.  Economic stability and flexibility are 
important to buyers, and Vietnam has a good environment 
for U.S. businesses.  MAST is currently expanding 
operations in China; however, China is not the only 
place where the company wants to be located.  Not every 
country can make MAST products, so it will be either 
Vietnam or China.  However, if Vietnam does not have 
adequate access to the US market, MAST would quickly 
close up shop here.  \"We cannot leave in 2005 and come 
back to Vietnam when they achieve WTO membership.\" 
 
4. (SBU) To maintain stability between the expiration 
of the ATC and Vietnam\'s WTO accession, the industry 
needs immediate help, Ms. Tran said.  There are 38 
categories currently under quota, but not all of these 
garment categories are produced in the U.S.  If Vietnam 
were granted quota-free categories for textiles and 
apparel not produced in the U.S., Vietnam could remain 
competitive in 2005 and encourage more buyers to 
remain.  Ms. Tran cited the sweater market as one 
possible category to be released from quota.  Vietnam\'s 
market in this product is still small, and production 
would not be in competition with U.S. producers. 
 
5. (SBU) Mr. Geoffrey Paul from Li & Fung Trading, 
Ltd., echoed these concerns.  Mr. Paul\'s company works 
closely with U.S. companies such as American Eagle 
Outfitters, and he agreed with a request for a more 
generous quota volume.  This would enable Vietnam to be 
competitive in 2005, and would allow U.S. businesses 
greater flexibility, as Vietnam is the best alternative 
to China. 
 
6. (SBU) Donnelly observed that the best way to address 
the textile industry\'s concerns was for Vietnam to 
accede quickly to the WTO, but he stressed that Vietnam 
cannot join the WTO only for gains in the textile and 
apparel industry.  There must be progress in all 
sectors under the negotiated WTO package.  While the 
U.S. strongly supports Vietnam joining the WTO quickly, 
some tough issues that are important to the U.S. 
remain.  How quickly the GVN makes decisions on these 
more difficult issues will determine how quickly 
Vietnam accedes to the WTO. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT:  The exchange between Donnelly and 
the textile reps was frank but friendly, with the reps 
not hesitating to point out that textile issues are not 
only trade questions for Vietnam.  As Ms. Tran 
observed, the garment industry is a matter of economic 
security employing 2 million people.  The industry is 
looking to overcome its short-term and long-term 
obstacles.  The reps may propose some creative ideas to 
achieve increased access to the U.S. market; one rep 
later wondered aloud to EconOff whether the U.S. would 
be willing to raise quotas if the GVN agreed to allow 
the U.S. early access to other markets (e.g. insurance) 
under the BTA.  END COMMENT. 
 
8. (U) PDAS Donnelly has cleared this message.

SUBJECT: RECURRENCE OF AVIAN FLU IN VIETNAM - WHERE\'S THE CHICKEN? 
 
1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Both price and availability of poultry in 
southern Vietnam declined sharply during a five-month period 
following the March outbreak of avian flu, despite government 
efforts to reassure the public that avian flu is \"under control.\" 
Vietnam has not replenished stocks of poultry and eggs from the 
widespread culling that occurred during the first outbreak of 
avian flu in December 2003, and farmers in the Mekong Delta have 
reportedly stopped raising chicken altogether.  As southern 
Vietnam has a significant poultry market, declining prices and 
scarce supply have suggested public concern about avian flu and 
avoidance of poultry.  During the past month, however, chicken 
prices in Hanoi, as well as in Ho Chi Minh City, have stabilized 
and in some cases risen slightly.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) According to widespread media reports, since Vietnam was 
proclaimed free of bird flu in March, 17 percent of the country\'s 
fowl population has been destroyed, equal to 43.2 million poultry 
in 57 out of 64 localities and a loss of VND 1.3 trillion ($83.3 
million).  International media sources were the first to report on 
fresh outbreaks of avian flu this summer and were the only 
consistent sources until August.  Local English language 
publications did not report any confirmation about avian flu from 
the Vietnamese authorities, or on any GVN response to avian flu, 
until August, at least three months after the recurrence of 
outbreaks.  Additionally, there was no media reporting on the 
avian flu recurrence in the Vietnamese language press until the 
end of July. 
 
3. (SBU) Government pronouncements reported in the national media 
have not been consistent.  During a working meeting with the FAO 
on July 14, the Director of Vietnam\'s Department of Animal Health 
(DAH), Dr. Bui Quang Anh, reportedly stated that there had been no 
new cases of bird flu in Vietnam since March 30.  Yet on July 19 
the DAH and the central government announced that an early July 
outbreak was \"under control\". Shortly after the July 19 
announcement, major newspapers carried front-page articles warning 
that avian flu had returned (from July 30 - August 2).  The media 
also reported that avian flu was again becoming a big concern, as 
the number of people reporting bird flu symptoms rose in 
localities having infected chickens. 
 
4. (SBU) Vietnamese media have been fairly muted since the initial 
July 19 announcement.  Newspapers now carry remarkably similar 
reports, quoting the same sources of information.  Not until 
August 13 did a major Vietnamese publication (Thanh Nien) carry 
the headline \"Government confirms bird-flu returns.\"  Only a 
limited number of government officials are allowed to answer the 
press on the topic of avian flu.  ConGen media contacts claim that 
the GVN decided to follow Thailand\'s approach in dealing with the 
current avian flu outbreak.  In their view, Thai authorities 
downplayed last year\'s outbreak and Thailand\'s tourism industry 
suffered little while tourism to Vietnam fell sharply.  However, 
Dr. Bui of DAH warned the population at a September 1 press 
briefing in Hanoi that the HN51 virus could linger in the 
environment for at least five years after a fresh outbreak, adding 
that the flu could erupt again \"anywhere\", although he also 
announced that the current outbreak could soon be declared \"under 
control\". 
 
5. (SBU) Since the first avian flu outbreak both the supply and 
price of chicken have dropped substantially.  According to a 
report by the World Bank in Vietnam, \"The Impact of the Avian 
Influenza Epidemic on the Vietnamese Economy,\" the price for a 
chicken was roughly VND 45,000 before December 2003.  Recent 
ConGen spot checks at local high-end markets indicate a price of 
around VND 30,000.  On September 17 and October 7, Econoff spoke 
with an expatriate retail grocer who sources chicken locally. 
According to the grocer, six months ago a whole chicken was priced 
at VND 78,000; currently, the grocer pays VND 35,000/chicken. 
Additionally, prior to avian flu this grocer sourced from only one 
local supplier.  Now the company sources from two or three 
suppliers due to short supply.  However, a wholesale supplier 
reported to HCMC Econoff on October 7 that wholesale chicken 
prices, which had also been declining, have gone up seven percent 
in the past month -- a phenomenon also observed for chicken prices 
in Hanoi during the same period. 
 
6. (SBU) Econoff also spoke with a local catering business about 
the price of poultry, as well as the price of beef, pork and fish. 
While chicken still remains a popularly requested menu item, the 
catering company reported paying a retail price around VND 
30,000/kilo.  The prices of beef, pork, and fish, however, have 
risen in the past six months:  beef from VND 55,000/kilo to VND 
65,000/kilo; pork from VND 27,000/kilo to VND 35,000/kilo; catfish 
from VND 30,000/kilo to VND 38,000/kilo; and black mullet from VND 
24,000/kilo to VND 30,000/kilo. 
 
7. (SBU) Poultry and poultry products are becoming far less common 
even in popular markets such as Ho Chi Minh City\'s Ben Thanh 
Market.  Falling demand and prices in recent months, combined with 
a fear of contracting the illness seem to be causing farmers to 
get out of poultry.  ConGen media sources report that only a 
handful of markets and supermarkets in HCMC are currently allowed 
to sell chicken meat.  (NOTE:  According to the Ministry of 
Agriculture in Hanoi, poultry meat is allowed to be sold 
throughout the country in both open markets and in supermarkets, 
but cities and provinces may implement their own regulations 
regarding the sale of poultry meat.  END NOTE.) 
8. (SBU) COMMENT:  In southern Vietnam, scarcity of poultry, 
declining poultry prices over a period of months, and mixed 
official media signals suggest a continuing public anxiety over 
avian flu and the difficulty the government has faced in assuaging 
that anxiety.  Recent reports of stable or increasing prices 
indicate that the local market may finally be correcting itself by 
matching diminishing supply with price increases.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: DANANG - WAITING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TO PAY OFF 
 
REF:  (A) HCMC 1240, (B) HCMC 1238 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  A Consulate visit to Danang led by the CG 
highlighted the city\'s eagerness to serve as a gateway to Central 
Vietnam and mainland Southeast Asia.  City leaders have boosted 
infrastructure investment, developing roads and a deep-sea port; 
now they are hoping their efforts will pay off in the form of 
increased trade and foreign direct investment.  While Danang has 
active academic and NGO communities, it seems to lack some of the 
entrepreneurial spirit of Ho Chi Minh City.  In addition to 
promoting Danang as an entry point to the region, authorities and 
developers have visions of developing the Danang and Quang Nam 
province seaside (the famed China Beach) into a resort mecca the 
likes of Phuket, Thailand.    Consular and religious affairs 
issues are reported in reftels.  END SUMMARY. 
 
DANANG AS A GATEWAY TO MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA 
 
2. (U) A ConGen HCMC team, including the Consul General, PolOff, 
EconOff and a ConOff, visited Danang September 29-October 1. 
First Vice Chairman of the People\'s Committee, Tran Van Minh, 
explained that Danang is in a unique position to serve as an 
economic gateway to Central Vietnam and mainland Southeast Asia 
through its deep-water port and proximity to the East-West 
Corridor, a highway that runs from Quang Tri, Vietnam, just north 
of Danang, through Laos and Thailand to Mawlamyine port in Burma. 
He said the Corridor is complete except for a bridge over the 
Mekong River in Laos that is expected to open in early 2006. 
(NOTE:  In addition, the largest tunnel in Southeast Asia, Hai Van 
tunnel, is scheduled to open at the end of 2004.  This 6km tunnel 
will shorten the old 20km route through the Hai Van pass between 
Danang and the East-West Corridor.  END NOTE.)  Minh noted that 
land-locked Laos already relies heavily on Danang as a transit 
point for its exports and imports.  Laos exports wood and gypsum 
through Danang and imports cement, iron and fuel.  Danang leaders 
hope its connection to the East-West Corridor will make it a focal 
point for increased Vietnamese exports of agricultural goods, 
seafood and coffee to Laos, Thailand and Burma.  Danang\'s local 
government also hopes to draw Thai tourists to the area. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Vice Chairman Minh, city fathers recognized 
the need to develop Danang\'s infrastructure as a means of 
attracting increased trade and investment to Vietnam.  They 
convinced the central government to allow Danang to keep 95 
percent of its tax revenues from 2000 to 2005 to fund 
infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, the port and 
housing.  After 2005, this arrangement will be phased out over 
time, with Danang keeping a decreasing portion of its revenues. 
According to Danang Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) 
Vice Director Lam Quang Minh, Hanoi agreed - \"after quite a fight\" 
-- to the unusual arrangement as a stopgap measure because there 
were no central government funds available to support Danang\'s 
infrastructure development ambitions. 
 
4. (U) Now that most of the infrastructure development is 
complete, Danang is waiting to reap the benefits.  Minh noted 
Danang\'s potential as a location to add value to Southeast Asian 
exports, e.g. wood processing.  He also highlighted Danang\'s plans 
to attract tourists, pointing to Danang\'s beaches and its 
proximity to World Heritage sites like Hue and Hoi An as reasons 
to think tourism can be big business in Danang. 
 
5. (U) At Danang\'s Tien Sa Port, Vice Director Nguyen Xuan Dung 
noted that while the port is the third-largest in Vietnam in terms 
of freight throughput after Ho Chi Minh City and Haiphong, Tien Sa 
Port is the country\'s deepest port, capable of handling ships up 
to 30,000 deadweight tons (DWT).  Currently the relatively low 
volume of cargo transiting the port (2.4 million tons to date in 
2004) is both a cause and a result of slightly higher total costs 
and longer waiting time for cargo shipped through Danang.  While 
Danang\'s port charges are lower than those in HCMC and Haiphong, 
cargo often must wait to depart Tien Sa Port until there is enough 
cargo to fill a ship.  Along with other Danang leaders, Vice 
Director Dung hopes the completion of the East-West Corridor and 
the installation of two gantry cranes for container cargo will 
bring a boom of business to the port by raising cargo volumes and, 
consequently, reducing costs.  Dung also cited the location\'s 
potential as a port of call for cruise ships and other visiting 
vessels. A 2,000-passenger Star Cruises ship calls annually in 
Danang, and the USS Curtis Wilbur\'s visit in July was the first 
call by a foreign military ship to Danang in 15 years. 
 
6.  (SBU) A call to the Danang branch of the Vietnam Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (VCCI) highlighted Danang\'s deficiencies in 
entrepreneurial initiative.  VCCI\'s Vice Director, Nguyen Cuong, 
indicated a desire to improve Danang\'s competitiveness, but 
lamented a lack of access to information on how to go about doing 
this.  Cuong spent most of the meeting explaining why Danang 
business was not moving faster, but had no ideas or programs to 
put forward.  He requested U.S. assistance in acquiring more 
information about the U.S. market and in aiding Danang to promote 
itself to U.S. businesses. 
A TOURISM MASTER PLAN 
 
7. (U) DPI Vice Director Minh outlined the city\'s tourism master 
plan, which calls for the development of approximately 24km of 
coastline - which includes the former U.S. R and R point of China 
Beach - into high-end beach resorts.  This ambitious plan includes 
creating a large lagoon, adapting a former U.S. military airstrip 
into a helipad and converting land behind the resorts into 
shopping and office space.  Vice Director Minh assured the Consul 
General that authorities are taking into consideration the 
potential for boom and bust in their tourism planning, but did not 
specify how they will adjust. 
 
8. (SBU) The ConGen team also met with Rick Mayo-Smith of 
Indochina Capital, an American financial services firm based in 
Southeast Asia, and Alfonso DeMatteis of Delta Equipment and 
Construction Company, a U.S. construction management company based 
in Vietnam that has overseen the construction of the U.S. 
Consulate in HCMC and other projects.  Indochina Capital, Delta 
Construction and other partners are developing a five-star resort 
at the southern end of the beach in neighboring Quang Nam 
province, near Hoi An.  The partnership is selling elegant 3- 
bedroom beachside villas on a 31-hectare section of the beach for 
$1 million.  The hotel that will be part of the resort will rent 
rooms for $200-300 a night.  Mayo-Smith and DeMatteis hope their 
resort and the greater Danang resort area will rival the resort of 
Phuket, Thailand.  DeMatteis told us that although all beachfront 
property from Marble Mountain near Danang to Hoi An has been 
leased for future tourist ventures.  One beach resort development 
site near DeMatteis\' site was foundering and its Viet Kieu owner 
was seeking to unload the lion\'s share of his beachfront property 
to other investors. 
 
EDUCATION: DEVELOPING A SKILLED WORKFORCE 
 
9. (SBU) During a visit to Danang University, the ConGen team met 
with university staff and student leaders.  The university has 
more than 34,000 students, many studying engineering and 
economics.  According to the rector, most students stay in Danang 
after graduation, which means the city is developing a skilled 
workforce that could prove attractive to investors.  However, 
others in the city told us that Danang still has a hard time 
competing for talent with the higher paying and livelier HCMC. 
 
10.  (U) While at the university, ConOff gave a briefing on 
student visa procedures to a packed house of more than 100 
students and parents.  The majority of students were interested in 
advanced study in the U.S. at the master\'s or Ph.D. level, 
contrary to the typical Vietnamese student visa applicant, who 
wishes to go to the U.S. to study English or take classes at a 
community college. 
 
NGOS IN DANANG:  A MODEL FOR OTHER PROVINCES? 
 
11. (SBU) The ConGen team visited several NGOs that are providing 
assistance to street children and the handicapped, as well as 
infrastructure support to schools, hospitals and medical clinics 
in Danang and Central Vietnam.  All the NGOs reported receiving 
strong support from the Danang government.  They are allowed to 
operate independently, face little political pressure and have the 
power to turn down projects or beneficiaries proposed by 
government agencies.  One NGO, East Meets West, has been allowed, 
after a lengthy debate with the local government, to provide 
direct aid via turnkey projects without having to go through the 
government.  East Meets West has also had success with educational 
projects that aid ethnic minorities in rural areas in Quang Nam 
province near the Central Highlands province of Kon Tum. 
COMMENT 
 
12. (SBU) Danang has many strengths - well developed but still 
underused infrastructure, an increasingly educated workforce and a 
strong NGO community.  The city\'s political and business 
leadership is hoping that these strengths will attract increased 
trade and investment.  They clearly hope that the East-West 
Corridor and tourism can provide the boost to ignite more rapid 
growth.  However, Danang, no matter how beautiful, is not Phuket. 
Moreover, city leaders seem not to understand the need to be more 
proactive in reaching out to both foreign and domestic investors 
to convince them that Danang is now open for business.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM: WAITING FOR A BIOTECH POLICY 
 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Vietnam may be close to adopting a policy that 
would allow it to use biotechnology to increase agricultural 
output and to improve the health of its citizens.  Vietnam\'s 
position at a biotech crossroads was highlighted during the recent 
visit of plant biotechnology expert Dr. C.S. Prakash of Tuskegee 
University.  Local biotech experts noted during Dr. Prakash\'s 
visit that it could be only a matter of months before the GVN 
releases a long-awaited policy announcement on agricultural 
biotechnology.  While Vietnam appears to be on the on the right 
side of the biotech debate, the GVN is still grappling with making 
the leap from the laboratory to the rice paddy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (U) ConGen had the opportunity to sound out local experts on 
the status of agricultural biotechnology in Vietnam during the 
September 15-17 visit of Dr. C.S. Prakash, director of Tuskegee 
University\'s Center for Plant Biotechnology Research.  Dr. Prakash 
made the case for the benefits of biotech in speeches and meetings 
with students and experts in Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta 
cities of Can Tho and An Giang.  Prior to coming to southern 
Vietnam, Dr. Prakash participated in a similar program in Hanoi. 
He argued that biotechnology is a safe way to increase 
agricultural productivity and improve the health of consumers in 
developing countries around the world and Vietnam in particular. 
 
3. (SBU) According to local experts, the GVN has officially 
identified the development of biotechnology (BT) as a national 
priority. Professor Nguyen Van Uyen, former Director of the 
Institute of Tropical Biology and one of Vietnam\'s leading 
advocates of biotechnology, observed that the GVN could release 
its biotech policy in a matter of months.  Sixteen universities 
and institutes in Vietnam are engaged in biotech research. 
According to Professor Uyen and his colleagues, Vietnamese 
authorities understand the value and potential benefits of 
biotechnology for economic development, but they are still 
grappling with the problem of how to put biotech to work for them. 
Various Vietnamese government agencies, in conjunction with 
academia, have been working for more than five years on drafting 
official policy. 
 
4. (SBU) Pending release of Vietnam\'s biosafety regime, 
institutions like Cuu Long Rice Research Institute (CLRRI) in the 
Mekong Delta are sitting on biotech research that could have rapid 
benefits for farmers and consumers alike.  For example, CLRRI has 
had great success adapting golden rice technology (rice 
genetically fortified with vitamin A and iron) in the laboratory, 
but cannot transmit the technology to the farmer.  Five million 
Vietnamese suffer from anemia and could benefit enormously from 
golden rice, according to Dr. Prakash\'s counterparts.  These 
contacts explained that the delay in implementing a biosafety 
regime is the result of concerns in Hanoi over possible 
repercussions for Vietnamese exports, especially to Europe.  They 
agreed, however, that little Vietnamese rice was sent to the EU. 
 
5. (SBU) Following implementation of a legal framework, 
dissemination of biotechnology may be rapid.  In the Mekong Delta, 
Can Tho University, CLRRI and An Giang University appear to have 
an effective collaboration with each other and with international 
counterparts, including the International Rice Research Institute 
(IRRI) in the Philippines.  For example, researchers share new 
strains of rice with each other for testing purposes.  CLRRI has 
already had success in transferring new conventional rice 
varieties to local farmers; 56 percent of Mekong Delta farmers use 
CLRRI rice varieties.  The GVN also has agricultural extension 
officers in place down to the local level.  While open to new 
varieties, most farmers still cultivate their own seeds to grow 
crops each season; the concept of buying seed for new crops is 
still novel and regarded with some suspicion.  Local academics 
noted during Dr. Prakash\'s visit that it is important that good 
quality seed be available to farmers when they use biotech rice 
varieties for the first time.  Poor quality seed could convince 
farmers that biotech varieties are not worth the expense of buying 
seed every season. 
 
6. (SBU) COMMENT: Dr. Prakash\'s visit highlighted that Vietnam is 
moving forward on agricultural biotechnology, and has substantial 
scientific and technical capacity in this area.  These scientists 
are eagerly awaiting biosafety legislation to begin disseminating 
technology.  While Dr. Uyen expects new regulations within months, 
others say it could be years before the policy takes effect.  Dr. 
Prakash\'s meetings, speeches, and press coverage were effective in 
highlighting this pressing issue.  END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: AMCIT PASTOR AND 17 HMONG DETAINED IN RELIGIOUS TRAINING 
CLASS IN HCMC 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  HCMC authorities on October 11 detained two 
Protestant pastors, one of whom was an American citizen, and 17 
ethnic Hmong Protestant deacons from Northern Vietnam attending a 
Bible training class at a private house in HCMC.  Police told the 
participants their meeting was illegal.  The pastors were released 
the same day, though the AmCit was ordered to leave Vietnam by 
October 15 and informed that Vietnamese law prohibited him from 
teaching religion in Vietnam.  The Hmong deacons were held 
overnight and then sent home to the northwestern provinces of 
Vietnam.  ConGen DPO raised the case with an unapologetic Acting 
Pol-Econ chief of the HCMC External Relations Office, who observed 
that American citizens need to be aware of the rules governing 
religious practice in Vietnam. END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Pastor Doan Trung Tin (strictly protect), Director of the 
Vietnam Good News Mission -- a non-recognized Protestant 
evangelical organization -- notified us that, on October 11, 17 
Hmong deacons from northwest Vietnam, a local HCMC pastor and an 
AmCit pastor of Laotian Hmong descent, were detained after the 
police broke up a religious training class in a private house in 
HCMC.  The police also detained the owner of the home.  , Pastor 
Tin said that his organization sponsored the training class, and 
claimed that he had held similar training sessions in HCMC for 
ethnic minorities in the past.    This time, however, the police 
informed the participants that they were detained because the 
meeting was illegal.  The two pastors and the owner of the house 
were released the same day, but the 17 Hmong remained in detention 
overnight before being returned to the Northwest highlands the 
following day. 
 
 
3. (SBU) We met with the AmCit, Pastor Vang on October 13. 
Pastor Vang said That when he arrived at the private home on the 
morning of October 11, the police were already present.  He said 
he was held at a police station until 7:00 p.m. and charged with 
failing to provide proper identification upon request -- his hotel 
retained his passport per standard practice in Vietnam -- and for 
engaging in activities inconsistent with his visa and his stated 
purpose of entry.  Pastor Vang was ordered to report to the 
immigration police the following day.  After nine hours in 
immigration police custody, Vang was ultimately charged with 
failing to provide proper identification, fined 500,000 Dong (USD 
30), and told to leave Vietnam by October 15.  Immigration police 
also confiscated his religious materials, camcorder and computer 
disks.  According to Van, the immigration police informed him that 
it was against the law for a foreign missionary to teach religion 
in Vietnam. 
 
4. (SBU) Pastor Vang said that this was his first trip to Vietnam. 
He told us that he had heard of training classes being organized 
for Hmong Protestants, and thought he could be of assistance 
because he is Hmong.  Pastor Vang said that, prior to his travel, 
he had contacted the Vietnamese Embassy in the U.S. to inquire 
about religious issues in Vietnam, but was referred to the 
Vietnamese Embassy website.  According to the pastor, the material 
there indicated that Vietnam allows religious freedom and freedom 
of assembly, with one document urging pastors to come to Vietnam 
themselves to witness the situation.  Pastor Vang indicated to us 
that he was not handcuffed or mistreated while in custody, but he 
was visibly shaken by his detention.  He asked several times if 
there was a higher Vietnamese authority that he could complain to 
about the incident involving the 17 Hmong.  We recommended that he 
maintain a low profile for the remainder of his stay in Vietnam. 
 
5. (SBU) DPO raised the detention of Pastor Vang and the 17 Hmong 
Vietnamese with Pham An, Acting Chief of the PolEcon unit of the 
HCMC External Relations Office on October 13.  Noting the release 
of Pastor Vang, the DPO indicated that we trusted the Vietnamese 
authorities would continue to treat him in a professional manner. 
The DPO stressed that the situation of the 17 Hmong also was of 
concern and said we would appreciate an update on their status. 
The DPO stressed that it is important for local and national 
authorities to treat the 17 Hmong with care so as not to have 
their case spillover onto the broader debate of freedom of 
religion in Vietnam and its recent designation as a Country of 
Particular Concern (CPC). 
 
6. (SBU) An observed that 17 Hmong meeting in a private residence 
in HCMC would \"hardly be invisible\" to local authorities.  He 
suggested that the organizers had not sought permission to 
assemble and were intentionally creating a a provocation to 
trigger a GVN reaction that would in turn lead to an international 
outcry.  In general, Hmong issues were very sensitive, but 
particularly after CPC designation, all Vietnamese officials were 
\"on alert,\" An added. .  An urged that Americans better understand 
procedures that need to be followed for religious training and all 
gatherings in Vietnam. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT:  The Hmong incident is a reminder that even in 
relatively cosmopolitan HCMC, it is still all too easy for 
unauthorized religious groups -- particularly outsiders --to run 
afoul of local authorities and Vietnam\'s strict constraints on 
freedom of assembly.  One silver lining is that our local 
colleagues understand that they are being watched closely on how 
they treat religious groups, recognized or not.  In that regard An 
assured us that none of the 17 Hmong will be \"detained 
whatsoever.\"  Pastor Tin told us on October 18 that he had 
confirmation that at least one of the Hmong deacons had returned 
home, and he believed that the rest also had returned and were not 
facing retribution from local authorities. 
END COMMENT.

SUBJECT: (SBU)  PESONNEL CHANGES IN VIETNAM\'S COMMUNIST PARTY 
 
1. (SBU/NF) Summary: Personnel shifts within the Communist Party 
in Southern Vietnam indicate that jockeying for position ahead of 
the party\'s 10th Congress in 2006 is underway.  A contact close to 
the Party told us that the Party\'s Central Committee had begun to 
consider who might succeed Prime Minister Phan Van Khai.  One top 
candidate, HCMC Party Secretary and Politburo member Nguyen Minh 
Triet was diagnosed recently with cancer, casting a cloud over his 
prospects.  Meanwhile, Triet had one of his protoges named as 
deputy of the HCMC branch of the Party.  End Summary. 
 
CPV personnel shifts begin 
-------------------------- 
 
2. (SBU) On October 9, HCMC media reported that the Politburo had 
decided to reassign and promote Mr. Le Hoang Quan, Communist Party 
Secretary of Dong Nai Province, to Deputy Secretary of the Party 
 
SIPDIS 
in HCMC.  Quan, a member of the Party\'s Central Committee, will 
replace Vo Van Cuong, who was responsible for anti-corruption 
efforts, internal party personnel and discipline for the Party in 
HCMC.  He will report directly to Politburo member and HCMC Party 
Secretary Nguyen Minh Triet. 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3. (SBU/NF) Two ConGen contacts, a prominent member of the local 
Chinese community and a Viet Kieu businessman, both with long-term 
contacts with the Party, told us that Quan is a protg of Triet\'s 
--both hail from Binh Duong province in southern Vietnam.  The 
contacts added that Quan is one of the individuals responsible for 
making Dong Nai province one of the more investor-friendly and 
d 
economically dynamic provinces in the region. 
 
4. (SBU/NF) Our sources said that Triet is grooming Quan to become 
his replacement.  If all goes according to plan, current HCMC 
People\'s Committee Chairman Le Thanh Hai -- another serious 
contender for the top slot in the HCMC Party structure -- would be 
transferred to Can Tho next year to be Party Secretary, clearing 
the field for Quan when the HCMC Party unit holds its 
organizational Congress next year. 
 
5. (SBU/NF) However, our contacts speculated that Quan might have 
to replace Triet as HCMC Party leader sooner rather than later. 
They told us that, in September, Triet was diagnosed with prostate 
cancer.  A specialist at HCMC\'s Franco-Viet hospital separately 
confirmed Triet\'s illness and said that Triet would have to travel 
to Singapore for treatment, as Vietnamese hospitals did not have 
the capability to treat the disease effectively. 
 
Triet as Prime Minister? 
------------------------ 
 
6.  (SBU/NF) Triet\'s illness may have national political 
implications.  The HCMC Party leader has been widely mentioned as 
a leading contender for Prime Minister when incumbent Phan Van 
Khai\'s term ends in 2007.  One of our sources told us that in an 
internal straw poll of the Party\'s Central Committee in June 2004, 
Triet was selected as first option to replace Van Khai, with 
fellow southerners and politburo members Truong Tan Sang and 
Nguyen Tan Dung ranked second and third respectively.  Triet\'s 
cancer diagnosis may call into question his ability to serve as 
PM.   (Traditionally, the post of Prime Minister has gone to a 
southerner, President to a party member from central Vietnam and 
General Secretary of the Party to a northerner.) 
 
7. (SBU/NF) According to our business contact, Triet has indicated 
that he would prefer to see Dung as PM rather than Sang.  Sang, 
now head of the Central Economics Commission, was Party Secretary 
of HCMC when Triet was promoted to become his deputy.  The two 
reportedly had a falling out in the year they served together 
before Sang was transferred to Hanoi.  Dung, meanwhile, is another 
high profile southerner and a protege of former PM Vo Van Kiet. 
Dung is charged by the Politburo to oversee efforts to manage 
development and ethnic minority issues in the Central Highlands. 
He also is head of the Mekong Delta Development Commission and has 
a strong power-base in the Can Tho region. 
 
8. (SBU/NF) Comment:  The Party is extremely opaque, particularly 
on personnel issues.  Nonetheless, the promotion of Quan and the 
other information our contacts are reporting highlight that Party 
members already have become deeply enmeshed in internal 
maneuvering in the run-up to the 2006 Party Congress.

REF:  HCMC 1270 
 
SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.  (SBU) Khanh Hoa Province on Vietnam\'s central coast is 
attempting a development strategy based on tourism, seafood and 
maritime transport.  Geography, natural resources, and workforce 
give the province excellent development potential and some 
infrastructure investment is underway.  However, a reliance on 
state owned enterprises, and a political insider/Vietnamese-style 
crony state capitalism model may temper prospects for rapid 
growth.  Social investment, for example in HIV/AIDS prevention and 
education, appears to be inadequate.  End Summary. 
 
 
2. (SBU) Consul General visited Nha Trang and Khanh Hoa province 
October 12-13 and met with the Communist Party Secretary 
(reportedly the first Western official to do so), the Chairman of 
the People\'s Committee, foreign corporations, state-owned 
enterprises, religious figures, civil society leaders, and 
scientific and educational institutes. 
 
STATE CAPITALISM ON THE CENTRAL COAST 
------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Party officials and the People\'s Committee focused on 
plans to develop a major seaport and tourism center at Van Phong 
Bay located 50 km north of Nha Trang City.  Party Secretary Nguyen 
Van Tu requested USG assistance in finding investors.  Tu stated 
that although no development of the site has begun, Van Phong 
Bay\'s deep protected waters make it an ideal seaport and that by 
2020 it would be competing with the largest ports in Southeast 
Asia.  CG asked why Khanh Hoa was pursuing the development of a 
new seaport at Van Phong Bay when facilities already exist in the 
province at Cam Ranh Bay.  Tu said the Vietnamese armed forces 
were not prepared to give up Cam Ranh Bay for commercial shipping. 
He said that former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet had advocated 
developing Van Phong for ecological tourism with port facilities 
limited to an oil transfer station.  However, he said 
enthusiastically, a Party Central Committee investigation team had 
supported the Van Phong Bay development projects and Prime 
Minister Phan Van Khai had no choice but to approve the ambitious 
plan by the Ministry of Transportation to build an international 
container terminal. 
 
4. (SBU) Deputy Party Secretary Pham Van Chi joined partway 
through the meeting.  He is directly responsible for Van Phong Bay 
and had served until this spring as the Chairman of the People\'s 
Committee.  (Note: Contacts said that Mr. Chi and his family 
members had extensive interests in business around the province. 
End note.)  In a separate meeting, People\'s Committee Chairman Vo 
Lam Phi reiterated Khanh Hoa\'s interest in Van Phong Bay, stating 
that it was the primary focus of the Committee\'s plans to develop 
the province\'s transport, tourism, and seafood industries.  When 
asked how the USG and Khanh Hoa Province could best work together, 
Chairman Phi again returned to Van Phong Bay, suggesting that we 
help find investors for the project. 
 
5. (SBU) Secretary Tu also noted Khanh Hoa\'s success in creating 
more than 1200 new small and medium businesses in the past three 
years. (Note: In contrast, Ho Chi Minh City registers 
approximately 250 new businesses per week. End note.)  These firms 
were creating 21,500 new jobs per year, he said.  Chairman Phi 
pointed to state-owned enterprise Khanh Viet Corporation as a 
model for development in the province, noting that Khanh Viet 
provides 33 percent of the province\'s tax revenue. 
 
6. (SBU) State-owned enterprise Khanh Viet Corporation (KVC) is 
the primary source of tax revenue for the province based on 
cigarette production.  KVC Chairman Nguyen Xuan Hoang told CG that 
KVC is the largest corporate group in central Vietnam.  Although 
KVC consists of twenty subsidiaries in various sectors, it employs 
only 4000 people.  Mr. Hoang stated that the corporation is based 
upon capitalist principals and ensures equality for all of its 
subsidiaries, although it maintains control of business strategies 
and budget, and reserves the right to move executives.  KVC\'s 
tobacco interests constitute 70 percent of the corporation, but it 
does not export its tobacco products.  KVC is also involved in 
tourism and textiles and is looking to expand into the production 
of crocodile and ostrich leathers in the near future.  Mr. Hoang 
boasted that of the 80 people KVC has working in its headquarters, 
only five were required to manage its imports and exports.  Mr. 
Hoang also stated that KVC has never been subjected to an outside 
audit. 
 
BUSINESS SUCCESS STORIES 
------------------------ 
 
7. (SBU) Hyundai-Vinashin Shipyard (HVS) represents the first 
heavy industry development in Khanh Hoa.  Begun in April 1999, HVS 
has grown rapidly, currently employing nearly 4,000 Vietnamese and 
Korean staff.  The yard includes two graving docks and a series of 
quays. Four ships ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 deadweight tons 
were undergoing repair.  The yard can service and repair ships of 
up to 400,000 dwt. Ships average between 5 and 15 days in service 
and yard bills seem to range from USD 250,000 to USD 1.5 million. 
HVS President Sung Woo Lee stated that the company\'s success stems 
from the availability of skilled and inexpensive labor, 
cooperative local authorities, favorable import/export 
regulations, and a joint venture partner (Vinashin) that has 
played a critical role in working with authorities.  HVS plans to 
begin building ships in the next few years. 
 
8.  (SBU) Philippine-based Rapexco Rattan Export Company currently 
has 7,000 employees working in its two Khanh Hoa factories; the 
firm exports more than 3,000 containers of rattan furniture 
annually and is a major supplier to IKEA and other furniture 
companies.  Rapexco\'s U.S. citizen country manager explained that 
the company\'s success was based on the ready availability of 
quality inexpensive labor and an experienced Manila-based business 
office skilled in working with US and international markets. 
 
9.  (SBU) Ms. Le Thi Thu Ha is General Director of Khanh Hoa Trade 
& Investment Corporation (KHTI), a state-owned enterprise under 
the People\'s Committee with interests in luxury resorts, 
industrial parks, and import/export companies.  She stated that 
KHTI\'s success is based not only on its relationship with the 
People\'s Committee but also on a business strategy focused on a 
bottom line.  KHTI is involved in developing projects, each of 
which is managed by a joint venture partner.  Ms. Ha noted several 
factors inhibiting development in Khanh Hoa and Vietnam in 
general, most notably the high cost and slow pace of equitization, 
limitations on foreign land ownership, strict labor laws, and the 
lack of a banking system and capital market. (For example, she 
said that KVC\'s cigarette factories made the company a cash cow, 
but it did not know what to do with the proceeds and was pouring 
money into poorly planned investments, even as KHTI was starved 
for investment capital for bankable projects.)  Ms. Ha stated that 
these issues were on the agenda for the annual meeting between the 
Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) with the Prime 
Minister.  CG asked directly who in the Party leadership could 
advance these issues effectively.  She responded pessimistically 
that she could think of no one. 
 
CIVIL SOCIETY IN KHANH HOA 
-------------------------- 
 
10.  (SBU) Visits to the Long Son Pagoda and the Sao Bien Major 
Seminary demonstrated that Buddhist and Catholic organizations 
have little trouble operating but face close government 
supervision.  Father Tran Thanh Phong, Rector of the Sao Bien 
Seminary, indicated that because Nha Trang is a tourist center, 
the seminary\'s activities enjoy a certain level of additional 
protection.  Father Phong said the church is not permitted to 
teach catechism other than as part of Sunday services and that any 
efforts to bring in converts to the Catholic community are 
discouraged. However, he noted that there had not been any 
problems in working with the Vatican.  A meeting with Thich Tri 
Tam, Venerable Bonze of the Long Son Pagoda, was not nearly as 
informative, as the bulk of the meeting featured the Bonze\'s 
recitation of a prepared statement while under the gaze of 
military police standing just outside the open door.  Bonze Tam 
stated that the pagoda had absolutely no problems with the local 
authorities. 
 
11. (SBU) HIV/AIDS is clearly an emerging issue in Khanh Hoa 
Province.  People\'s Committee Chairman Phi noted that the province 
has the tenth highest infection rate in Vietnam.  He cited Khanh 
Hoa\'s active publicity campaign promoting the use of condoms, 
adding that it is the only province to set up a separate 
protection center for victims of HIV/AIDS, the Center for Health 
Education and Communication.  However, Mr. Luong Duc Hoa, a 
project officer with the center, stated that support from the 
local government is inadequate to meet the center\'s needs.  He 
complained that the total annual budget allocated to the center by 
the PC was only USD 1,000.  Although the center has received some 
funding from the Ford Foundation, Mr. Hoa hopes that further 
funding from PEPFAR may become available for the center, which has 
the only program in Vietnam designed for men who have sex with men 
(MSM). 
 
12.  (SBU) Higher education also appeared underfunded.  Dr. Lien, 
Rector of the University of Fisheries, remarked that the local 
authorities have not provided sufficient support to the 
university, thereby limiting its ability to attract qualified 
faculty.  Chairman Phi indicated that the province hopes to 
transform the Teacher Training College into a university and some 
vocational schools into colleges, but did not provide a time line. 
 
13. (SBU) Comment: Despite potential, Khanh Hoa appears to be 
hindered by a strong state/crony capitalism approach and the 
authorities\' reliance on state-owned enterprises.  Officials\' 
hopes for the Van Phong Bay project as the next great cash cow for 
the region seem misplaced.  Success stories such as Hyundai- 
Vinashin and Rapexco have had passive cooperation but no active 
government involvement.  Furthermore, key areas in health and 
education are underfunded.  In contrast, up the coast in Danang, 
the authorities have stressed public infrastructure investment to 
attract investors to take advantage of similar resources (Reftel). 
In Khanh Hoa, authorities seem to believe that they can lure 
investors into building the infrastructure as a means of 
developing the local economy.

REF:  HANOI 2926 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, one of the 
fathers of Vietnam\'s economic reform policy and an informal 
advisor to the GVN and the Party, stressed to the Consul General 
October 30 that Vietnam is on the verge of eliminating the last 
vestiges of its central planning system, divesting all but a few 
\"strategic\" state owned enterprises and creating a level playing 
field that will foster entrepreneurship and spur economic growth. 
A firm majority in the Party favors taking more dramatic steps to 
spur double-digit economic growth.  At the same time, the 
contention that the United States seeks to use economic reform to 
undermine the Party -- so-called \"peaceful evolution\" -- no longer 
resonates much.  Vietnam, Kiet maintained, is ready to take our 
bilateral relationship to a new level of cooperation.  End 
Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) In a two-hour tour d\'horizon with the CG and PolOff 
October 30, former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet (1991-97), one of 
the Party\'s elder statesmen from the South and an architect of 
Vietnam\'s economic liberalization policy, underscored the 
commitment of the GVN and the Communist Party to deeper economic 
reform and to a substantially improved relationship with the 
United States.  Kiet agreed with the CG that Vietnam has the clear 
capacity to move to double-digit rates of economic growth from its 
current annual seven percent rate.  He said the Party is acutely 
aware that, should Vietnam fail to further catalyze economic 
growth, it will fail in its top-priority objective to catch up 
with its \"neighbors\" (China, Thailand and Malaysia). 
 
3. (SBU) Sometimes sounding more like an investment banker than a 
former Politburo member and current informal advisor to the GVN 
and Party, Kiet said that the GVN now recognizes that it needs to 
do more to promote the non-state sector of the economy, to 
catalyze domestic entrepreneurship and to attract greater foreign 
investment.  The GVN, he maintained, is prepared to take new 
measures to streamline the regulatory process and to minimize 
corruption.  The GVN also will move more determinedly to divest 
all but a few \"strategic\" state-owned enterprises and create a 
level playing field in which SOEs and private companies would 
compete fairly for credit, market share and survival.  Subsidies 
for SOEs would be cut and legal and administrative remnants of 
Vietnam\'s old centrally planned economic system also will be 
removed.  Kiet maintained that these reforms do not need to wait 
until the 10th Party Congress in 2006 for resolution.  He said 
that the legal framework exists or can be supplemented quickly to 
implement reform, particularly as the National Assembly 
understands that the negative effects of waiting outweigh the 
positive ones of prompt action. 
 
Peaceful Evolution warnings losing steam 
---------------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Kiet agreed that there are those in the Party -- \"older 
cadre and government officials\" -- who still resist economic 
reform because such reform \"would create social instability.\" 
(Note:  Party leaders equate social instability with a weakening 
of the Party\'s control over society.  End note.)   Publicly, these 
concerns are sometimes manifested as a warning against \"peaceful 
evolution,\" an attempt by \"external forces\" such as certain 
elements in the United States to use peaceful means to bring 
\"unwanted\" change to Vietnam. 
 
5. (SBU) Unlike when he was Prime Minister, Kiet believed that the 
naysayers are a minority and will not halt the reform process. 
Within the Party, fear of lagging behind Vietnam\'s neighbors and 
failing to meet the economic expectations of the Vietnamese people 
outweigh concerns over the implications of pushing for a more 
open, private-sector oriented economy. 
 
A strengthened bilateral relationship 
------------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) Kiet also was firm that the \"peaceful evolution\" group 
within the Party and GVN would not be able to impede the 
strengthening of the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral relationship.  Now 
that Vietnam had \"resolved\" most bilateral issues with China other 
than the Spratlys, there is more of an emphasis within the Party 
and GVN on the relationship with the United States.  Kiet said 
that the strategy of making trade and economic issues the bedrock 
of the relationship is the correct one; in particular, the 
Bilateral Trade Agreement is a \"needed precondition\" that allows 
Vietnam to address other problems in the relationship.  He said it 
is the \"common view of Vietnam\'s leadership\" that there is no 
reason why the U.S.-Vietnam relationship could not be modeled on 
the U.S. bilateral relationship with Japan or the very friendly 
ties that Vietnam has developed with France. 
 
7. (SBU) Kiet also made a pitch for U.S. support for Vietnam\'s 
rapid entry into the WTO.  However, unlike his successor PM Phan 
Van Khai, Kiet did not call for U.S. concessions during the WTO 
accession negotiations (see reftel for the Ambassador\'s recent 
conversation with PM Khai).  Kiet did rail against hardliners 
within the Party who had held up Vietnamese approval of the BTA in 
the late 1990s.  He argued that, because Vietnam delayed signing 
the BTA, it was put in the position of having to negotiate with 
its neighbors (Cambodia, Laos and China) for Vietnam\'s WTO 
accession rather than have them seek Vietnam\'s approval for their 
own entry into the WTO. 
8. (SBU) Only on religious freedom issues did Kiet sound less like 
a reformer and more like a traditional Party representative.  Kiet 
acknowledged a number of \"incidents\" and said that some local 
officials still have unfortunate \"prejudices.\"  He maintained, 
however, that these incidents belie the tremendous growth of 
religious freedom and religious practice in Vietnam.  The CG 
pointed out to Kiet that our dialogue with the GVN on religion 
does not focus on the freedom of belief but on how people can 
organize themselves to practice their faith.

SUBJECT: CONTROVERSIAL KONTUM PASTOR FANS RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY 
 
REF:  HANOI 2886 
 
1.  (U) On November 4 post received from EAP/BCLTV an electronic 
copy of letter from Kon Tum Mennonite Pastor Nguyen Cong Chinh 
dated October 26 containing two highly inflammatory allegations: 
 
-- in late September, Kon Tum provincial police detained and 
tortured seven new converts for three days, forcing them to sign 
documents renouncing their faith; and, 
 
-- in mid-October, police in the town of Pleiku (located in the 
neighboring province of Gia Lai, some 40 kilometers from Kon Tum) 
detained four pastors affiliated with a local Mennonite church 
and, after four days of \"unrelenting pressure,\" forced them to 
sever their ties to the Mennonite church and to renounce their 
faith.  Per reftel, Pastor Chinh has been involved in a land 
dispute with Kon Tum authorities, which led to the demolition of 
his home, which he used as a house church, on September 20. 
 
2. (SBU) Two reliable religious contacts in HCMC and in Gia 
Lai Province -- which borders Kon Tum Province -- told us November 
4 that their understanding of what occurred in Kon Tum and Pleiku 
belies Pastor Chinh\'s claims.  With regard to the Kon Tum 
incident, our contacts can confirm that the seven individuals were 
summoned for police questioning over a period of four days because 
of their relationship with Pastor Chinh.  They were allowed to go 
home each day after questioning. 
 
3. (SBU) Our contacts told us that -- as far as they understand -- 
there was no police effort to compel renunciation of faith in Kon 
Tum.  Rather the police ordered the seven not to assemble in 
unauthorized locations, but rather to worship in recognized 
churches.  Our HCMC source added that he has been in regular 
contact with Pastor Chinh and that, during these conversations, 
Pastor Chinh has never made any allegations of forced 
renunciation.  Neither source has any information regarding police 
brutality in Kon Tum. 
 
4. (SBU) Our Gai Lai contact -- based in Pleiku -- told us that 
the church and the four pastors that Chinh mentioned in his letter 
were not affiliated with the Vietnamese Mennonite church, but with 
the officially-recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV).  According to our contact, after Chinh met with the four 
SECV members, the police summoned the four for \"informational 
interviews\".  There was no police brutality, according to our Gai 
Lai contact.  He added that the SECV is \"upset\" that Pastor Chinh 
is muddying the waters in Pleiku, particularly as it has been 
making progress in building a better relationship with local 
authorities. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  The fact that two reliable contacts, both of 
whom have been critical of the GVN practices on religion in the 
past, are at odds with Pastor Chinh speaks volumes.  Pastor Chinh 
appears to be increasingly willing to distort the truth in an 
effort to agitate for greater religious freedom in Vietnam.  In 
the process it appears that he is not only bringing down the wrath 
of local authorities on himself and his followers, but also 
threatening to undermine the efforts of other religious groups in 
the sensitive Central Highlands.

SUBJECT: GVN AND HCMC RELIGIOUS LEADERS CONSULT ON NEW LEGAL 
GUIDELINES 
 
1. (SBU) Summary and Comment: GVN officials in Ho Chi Minh City 
are in the process of consulting with the religious community in 
southern Vietnam on new draft implementation guidelines for 
Vietnam\'s new religious ordinance.  These officials are also 
making overtures to Vietnam\'s evangelical Protestant house church 
movement; at least some house church leaders are reciprocating. 
One key leader told us that house churches would be willing to 
operate under the new legal framework if the GVN modifies it to 
meet their concerns.  We understand that HCMC authorities and 
house church leaders began discussions on the implementation 
guidelines November 3, but time is short before the framework 
comes into effect on November 15.  Ultimately, what we and our 
contacts have seen so far is in draft, and there is no telling 
what the official and final version of the implementation 
regulations will look like on November 15.  Significantly, 
however, our official and \"unofficial\" religious contacts appear 
encouraged that the GVN is engaging in a consultative process with 
them.  End Summary. 
 
A new framework for religious practice in Vietnam? 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
2. (SBU) On October 8, Nguyen Thanh Xuan, Vice-Chairman of the 
central-level Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA), along with 
representatives from the central-level Fatherland Front and the 
Ministry of Public Security, unveiled for 100 southern religious 
leaders draft implementation guidelines for the Ordinance on 
Religion.  The Ordinance and guidelines -- to be issued as a GVN 
decree -- will take effect on November 15.  According to ConGen 
contacts at the meeting, the GVN representatives said that the new 
legal framework would extend significant new freedoms to organized 
religion.  They maintained that it also would make treatment of 
religious organizations uniform across Vietnam. 
 
3. (SBU) ConGen HCMC has obtained a copy of the draft decree for 
translation and analysis and has held a series of meetings to 
gauge the reactions of recognized and non-recognized religious 
groups to the draft implementation guidelines. 
 
4. (SBU) Our religious contacts noted positively that \"coercing 
citizens to give up their religions\" is explicitly prohibited. 
They also welcomed the draft decree\'s concrete procedures for non- 
recognized religious organizations (the Protestant house church 
movement, Baptists, Mennonites and others) to regularize their 
operations and register with the Government.  According to the 
draft guidelines, once approved, registered organizations would be 
allowed to: 
 
-- organize and hold religious rites, ceremonies, and teach at the 
registered locations; 
-- elect leaders; 
-- conduct religious training for believers; 
-- repair and upgrade religious facilities; and 
-- conduct charitable or humanitarian activities. 
 
5. (SBU) Pastor Le Van Thien (strictly protect), a senior official 
of the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV), told us that 
the draft implementation guidelines contained several important 
improvements related to the ordination and transfer of religious 
staff.  The SECV was hopeful that the new legislation, once 
official, would facilitate the quick reopening of SECV churches in 
the Central Highlands.  (The draft decree allows in-province 
\"refresher courses\" to facilitate the ordination of new religious 
staff for already-recognized religious organizations such as the 
Catholic Church and the Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam 
(SECV).  It also eases restrictions on the transfer of pastors and 
priests between provinces.) 
 
6. (SBU) The SECV said that during the October 8 meeting with GVN 
officials, Catholic, SECV and Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS) -- the 
GVN-recognized Buddhist organization -- representatives pressed 
for specific language defining how and when religious institutions 
would be returned property confiscated after 1975.  At this 
meeting, Catholic and SECV representatives also criticized the 
GVN\'s approach on religion, saying that, in general, there was no 
need for the government to be involved in the internal affairs of 
religious organizations. 
 
7. (SBU) Our SECV contact noted that the draft decree does not 
specify punishments for officials that violate it, other than 
noting that those who violate regulations on forced conversions 
\"shall be dealt with in accordance with the law.\"  Nor does the 
draft decree delineate what specific reasons the GVN can use to 
deny a religious group registration or recognition.  A number of 
our religious contacts also objected to the strong GVN imprint on 
religious school curriculum and new controls on the travel of 
religious officials overseas.  The SECV cited the absence of 
provisions facilitating publishing of the Bible and other 
religious works. 
 
8.  (SBU) Thich Tri Quang (strictly protect), head of the HCMC 
branch of the VBS, told the Consul General October 27 that he did 
not anticipate that the new legislation would have any impact on 
VBS activities whatsoever.  He added that the outlawed Unified 
Buddhist Church of Vietnam would not be allowed to apply for 
registration as a new religious organization after November 15, as 
the VBS charter clearly stated that it was the \"sole\" 
representative of all Buddhists in Vietnam. 
 
9. (SBU) In discussions on October 22 and 27, Pastor Pham Dinh 
Nhan (strictly protect), a leader of the Vietnam Evangelical 
Foundation (VEF), an umbrella organization for Vietnam\'s 
Protestant house church movement, told us that there were a number 
of positive elements in the draft implementation guidelines.  He 
said that, after a review of the draft decree and meetings with 
senior GVN officials in Hanoi and HCMC in late September and early 
October, he and his colleagues were prepared to begin a dialogue 
with the Committee for Religious Affairs. 
 
10. (SBU) Nhan said that, if the VEF\'s concerns were met, it would 
be willing to register its operations and operate within the new 
legal framework.  Nhan acknowledged that this marks a major shift 
in the VEF\'s approach: during a trip of VEF leaders to Hanoi in 
late September, the VEF had declined to meet with the CRA despite 
repeated requests from CRA and other GVN officials. 
 
11. (SBU) Nhan said his biggest concern was that, at this point, 
the draft decree allows registered organizations to operate only 
from defined places of worship.  However, the very nature of 
Vietnam\'s house church movement means that it owns or controls few 
structures large enough to convert into permanent churches.  The 
VEF also is concerned that permitted activities for registered 
religious organizations are overly restrictive.  In particular, 
the VEF maintains that registered organizations must be allowed to 
ordain pastors and build new churches. 
 
View from the HCMC CRA 
---------------------- 
 
12. (SBU) On October 28, HCMC CRA Chairman Nguyen Ngoc San 
stressed to us that the draft implementation guidelines as they 
stand are a significant softening of controls on religion.  He 
welcomed dialogue with house church leaders, but noted that his 
previous calls to Pastor Nhan and other VEF leaders had gone 
unanswered; however, at our urging, he said he would try again. 
He warned that there was little time left for the VEF and other 
non-recognized house church groups to meet with the CRA before the 
final decree was published.  San also noted that the GVN was 
\"insulted\" that VEF leaders had circulated a letter to the 
international community in September criticizing the new Ordinance 
on Religion but had not responded to CRA \"efforts\" to meet with 
them prior to issuing the communique.  He added that \"if the house 
church movement was more patient and more respectful, they would 
get more sympathy and understanding\" from the GVN. 
 
13. (SBU) San admitted that there were still a number of important 
gaps and imprecisions in the draft legislation.  In particular, 
how the GVN would deal with the house church movement after 
November 15 was a \"major headache.\"  The CRA also needs to 
determine the numerical threshold at which an organization would 
have a sufficient number of believers to register.  For example, 
Mormons only had \"tens\" of believers in HCMC, insufficient 
critical mass, in San\'s view, to merit registration.  He did not 
specify if the Mormons or other groups would be allowed to 
continue to practice their faith until they reached critical mass. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
14. (SBU) All of our contacts recognized that the regulations are 
still in draft and that there is no telling what the final version 
of the implementing regulations will look like.  Post also will 
defer commenting on the regulations until we have seen the final 
product.  That said, the GVN\'s process of consultation with 
recognized religious organizations on the draft implementation 
guidelines and its overtures to the house church movement are 
encouraging.  Equally, the change in tone from members of the 
Protestant community -- many of whom criticized the Ordinance, 
insisting that the GVN has no role in religious affairs -- 
suggests they see the Ordinance on Religion and the draft 
implementation guidelines as a good faith effort to meet some of 
their concerns.

SUBJECT: MONTAGNARDS, RELIGION AND DEVELOPMENT IN CENTRAL 
HIGHLANDS: VO VIET THANH BRIEFS CG ON GVN PROGRESS 
 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Special Advisor to the Prime Minister for the 
South Vo Viet Thanh told the Consul General that the GVN wants 
U.S. support to solve the problem of ethnic Montagnards in the 
Central Highlands fleeing to Cambodia.  He suggested that Vietnam 
could establish an \"in-country\" program similar to how the GVN 
successfully concluded the \"boat people\" crisis in the early 
1990s.  More broadly, Thanh said that the GVN recognizes that 
\"sometimes mistakes were made\" in treatment of religion and ethnic 
Minorities; \"conservatives\" and inept local party officials were 
at fault.  The ordinance on religion and new socio-economic 
initiatives in the Central Highlands were evidence of a new GVN 
approach.  While welcoming this \"new thinking,\" the CG emphasized 
that GVN must ensure that its policies are implemented at a local 
level to have real impact.  The CG also encouraged the GVN to 
facilitate USG development assistance in the Highlands and to 
solve problems surrounding the applications of Montagnard family 
members \"following to join\" relatives already in the United 
States.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On November 8, CG and PolOff met with \"Special Advisor to 
the Prime Minster for the South\" Vo Viet Thanh.  Lieutenant 
General Thanh was Vice Minister of Public Security and later 
served as Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee.  At Thanh\'s 
initiative, the discussion centered on freedom of religion, the 
Central Highlands, and cross-border flight of ethnic minorities to 
Cambodia. 
 
Religion, Development and the Central Highlands 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
3. (SBU) While sticking to the usual GVN talking points that 
ethnic unrest in the Central Highlands was \"incited from abroad,\" 
Thanh said that the GVN had realized that local authorities had 
made significant mistakes in their handling of religion and of 
ethnic minorities in the Central and Northern Highlands.  These 
mistakes, he suggested, helped foster the conditions that gave 
\"outside extremists\" opportunities to create problems.  Thanh was 
critical of the past GVN policy on religion. In his view, there 
was no reason why the GVN needed to regulate the internal affairs 
of religious organizations.  Such a policy merely inserted the GVN 
into the internecine rivalry of various religious sects without 
enhancing GVN security, he argued.  He said that in the past, he 
had pushed this argument in Hanoi, but \"conservative elements 
scattered throughout the GVN\" hadtorpedoed this approach. 
 
4. (SBU) The GVN\'s new legal framework on religion, due to come 
into effect November 15, is proof that the GVN now recognizes that 
it is counter to national interest to intervene deeply into 
religious affairs, Thanh argued.   Thanh agreed with the CG that 
Vietnam\'s growing Protestant house church movement was not 
consistent with the hierarchical and centralized structure that 
the GVN demanded of religious organizations.  Thanh said the 
religious ordinance was designed to resolve some of these issues. 
Further refinements in the law were possible as the GVN continues 
to \"learn from its mistakes,\" he suggested. 
 
5. (SBU) Thanh said that, in the Central Highlands, the GVN 
already has authorized local authorities to register all branches 
of protestant religious organizations \"without discrimination.\" 
According to Thanh, the only exception is the \"Dega Protestant 
church,\" which the GVN considers to be a reincarnation of the 
Montagnard separatist movement.  (GVN officials have long argued 
that a number of ethnic Montagnards were using the \"Dega\" church 
as a platform for overtly political and anti-Vietnam messages.) 
 
6.  (SBU) The GVN is serious about resolving the decades-long 
problems of ethnic minority economic and social disenfranchisement 
in the Highlands, Thanh maintained.  Hanoi recognizes that many of 
its ongoing economic and educational initiatives will take at 
least a decade to show significant results.  That is why, inter 
alia, the GVN recently issued a directive banning all land 
transactions involving ethnic minorities and majority Kinh.  While 
even some minority representatives protested this approach, the 
GVN believes it is needed to stem the pernicious practice of 
economically-backward Montagnards selling their land to ethnic 
Vietnamese (Kinh) to raise cash only to be left with nothing after 
a few years, forcing them to repeat the process, further 
disenfranchising the Montagnards from their land. 
 
Montagnards in Cambodia 
----------------------- 
 
7.  (SBU) Thanh said that he was tasked to \"independently 
research\" the problem of ethnic minority flight from the Central 
Highlands to Cambodia.  In his view, the majority of the 
Montagnards are economic migrants, who believe that they would 
have a better life overseas.  Many are encouraged to flee by 
overseas \"Dega\" activists, who hope to use the refugee issue to 
embarrass Vietnam.  He alleged that many Montagnards in Cambodia 
were instructed by overseas Montagnard groups to refuse UNHCR 
offers of resettlement to third countries, as the Dega movement 
sought to have the refugee problem fester in Cambodia. 
 
8.  (SBU) Thanh appealed for U.S. cooperation to resolve the 
problem of Montagnard cross-border flight.  He said that the GVN 
is examining the possibility of creating an in-country program 
that would facilitate Montagnard legal migration.  Such a program 
could be modeled on the effort the GVN had launched to end the 
boat people crisis when he was Vice Minister of Public Security. 
During this effort, he said 400,000 Vietnamese were given 
passports and allowed to leave Vietnam in an orderly manner. 
Vietnam, he said, would be willing to treat the Montagnards in the 
same fashion.  Similarly, those Montagnards who wished to return 
to Vietnam would be welcomed back with no repercussions, as the 
GVN had done when it accepted boat people who had failed to secure 
third country resettlement from camps in Hong Kong and elsewhere 
in the region. 
9. (SBU) In this regard, the GVN now recognized that the UNHCR was 
\"not the enemy,\" but was itself a victim of manipulation by the 
\"Dega\" movement.  Thanh said he was not aware that some 
Montagnards who wished to leave and join their families in the 
United States were not being allowed to apply for passports or 
were having their applications buried in procedure.  He pledged to 
clarify the matter if we could provide him with additional 
information. 
 
U.S. Assistance in the Highlands 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) CG agreed with Thanh that the problem of ethnic 
minorities in Vietnam had deep social, economic and political 
roots that predated 1975.  He noted that the issue of the status 
and human rights of indigenous peoples was not unique to Vietnam. 
In this regard, the GVN approach of focusing on long-term 
education and economic development of the Highlands is an 
important element in fostering stability in region.  The CG added 
that the USG supports the GVN\'s efforts to economically-revitalize 
the Highlands and to better integrate the Montagnards into 
Vietnamese society.  The CG said that the USG is prepared to 
provide financial and technical assistance, in close coordination 
with the GVN, local officials and NGO\'s, to promote these shared 
objectives.   The CG also noted that the GVN must be much more 
rigorous in ensuring that its directives are implemented at the 
provincial and local levels, where many religious freedom and 
human rights violations arise. 
 
Reaching out to the Viet Kieu 
----------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) Thanh also said that he was playing an active role in 
GVN efforts to build better ties with the overseas Vietnamese 
community.  The GVN\'s policy is clear in trying to encourage 
economic, cultural and social participation of Viet Kieu.  In this 
regard, he had met twice with former Vice President of South 
Vietnam Nguyen Cao Ky.  Thanh informed CG that Ky was in HCMC for 
a second working visit.  Thanh also said that he was in contact 
with other senior officials of the pre-1975 Saigon government, 
many of whom had made significant investments in Vietnam. 
 
12.  (SBU) Comment:  If the company he keeps is any indication, 
Thanh has some pull within the political elite in the South. 
During the meeting, Thanh was flanked by two senior members of the 
HCMC External Relations Office and another senior functionary of 
the HCMC branch of the Prime Minister\'s Office.   Nguyen Cao Ky 
separately told us on November 9 that Thanh is one of his primary 
contacts with the GVN and Party.  (More on our conversation with 
Ky septel.) 
 
13.  (SBU) Bio Notes: Born in Ben Tre province, Thanh, 62, was 
active in the NLF in the Mekong Delta from 1964-75.  After the war 
he studied in the Soviet Union.   Thanh was Vice Minister of 
Public Security from 1987-91 and holds the rank of Lieutenant 
General. A protege of former Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Thanh 
served as Chairman of the HCMC People\'s Committee from 1997-2001, 
when he was forced out in the inter-Party feuding between 
supporters of Vo Van Kiet and Party Secretary Le Kha Phieu.  The 
Southern faction of the party reportedly brought him back to HCMC 
to be the PM\'s \"Special Representative for the South.\" 
 
14.  (SBU) Thanh is an avid golfer.  He is married with three 
children, at least one reportedly studying in the U.S. He speaks 
passable French and limited English.

SUBJECT: SAIGONTOURIST: STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE SYNDROME 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  One of the largest tourism companies in 
Vietnam, HCMC-based Saigontourist is struggling to develop its 
tourism business to attract foreign visitors in particular. 
Saigontourist owns or has an interest in 70 hotels all over 
Vietnam and employs 15,000 people, but its General Director does 
not appear to have a grasp of the market value of his company.  In 
addition to hotels, Saigontourist is involved in a web of 
enterprises, including tour companies, transport companies, 
airlines and banking.  Saigontourist retains much of its 
inefficient SOE character, despite being partially equitized.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) Saigontourist General Director Nguyen Huu Tho described 
his company to the Consul General as a small, formerly state-owned 
enterprise (SOE) turned into a giant holding company with 45 
affiliated companies, 70 hotels, 6 tour companies and interests in 
Vietnam Airlines, Pacific Airlines, the Export-Import Bank of 
Vietnam and more.  Mr. Tho said company managers want 
Saigontourist to be a \"mother\" company with subsidiary and 
affiliate companies.  The GVN, through the HCMC People\'s 
Committee, still holds a 70 percent stake in Saigontourist. 
According to Mr. Tho, the company undergoes an internal audit 
annually. Shareholders owning 1,000 or more shares may participate 
in shareholders\' meetings and receive the annual report. 
Saigontourist is in the process of equitizing its subsidiaries; 
seven Saigontourist companies have been equitized in 2004. 
 
3. (SBU) CG asked about the value of the company but Tho would say 
only that the GVN values the company at 1,600 billion VND 
(approximately $102 million).  He noted, however, that this 
valuation was based on profits and didn\'t include the \"value\" of 
the company\'s fixed assets.  Mr. Tho said the market value of 
Saigontourist would be much higher than this valuation, since the 
Rex Hotel in HCMC alone was worth 1,700 billion VND (approximately 
$108 million). 
 
4. (SBU) Saigontourist\'s hotel business is divided into three 
categories:  affiliated divisions, domestic investment, and 
foreign joint ventures.  The company has 15 hotels/resorts/hotel 
groups that are affiliated divisions; they are 100 percent owned 
and managed by Saigontourist.  The affiliated division hotels 
include the Rex, Continental and Majestic Hotels in HCMC. 
Saigontourist lists about 14 hotels/resorts/hotel groups as 
domestic investment.  These hotels are joint-stock companies of 
which Saigontourist owns a percentage and which Saigontourist 
manages.  Domestic investment hotels include many of the company\'s 
hotels outside the HCMC area, like the Saigon-Can Tho Hotel and 
the Saigon-Phu Quoc Resort.  Saigontourist has some 5 foreign 
joint venture hotels, in which the company shares ownership with 
foreign investors and which Saigontourist does not manage.  The 
foreign joint venture hotels include three of HCMC\'s flagship 
hotels - the Caravelle, the New World and the Sheraton. 
 
5. (SBU) Mr. Tho acknowledged the challenge of foreign competition 
and said Saigontourist would meet it through in part through 
training.  Saigontourist has started sending middle managers to 
Singapore to study hotel/tourism management. Tho also acknowledged 
HCMC\'s need for a convention center to develop the city\'s tourism 
infrastructure.  Saigontourist is looking for investors in a 
planned convention center complex, but will only invite a few 
partners to make proposals and does not plan to open the process 
up to public bidding. 
 
6. (SBU) ConGen contacts in the tourism industry agree that 
Saigontourist is an inefficient SOE that does have a handle on the 
requirements of the tourist market in the area.  The expat manager 
of one of Saigontourist\'s foreign joint venture hotels (protect 
strictly) told the Consul General the company \"doesn\'t have a 
clue\" of either a business strategy or how to run a world class 
hotel.  The general manager of another top HCMC hotel which is not 
affiliated with Saigontourist (protect), described the company\'s 
managers as incompetent and corrupt.  Saigontourist\'s handling of 
a recent travel fair in Europe epitomized the company\'s problems 
in this manager\'s mind.  During the fair, Saigontourist was 
represented by older Communist Party-type managers, who neither 
spoke English nor had any agenda beyond a junket.  The officials 
ignored visitors to the Saigontourist booth, including 
representatives of travel publications anxious to do stories on 
Vietnam.  Both managers agreed, however, that anyone wanting to 
get involved in the tourism business in southern Vietnam had no 
choice but to work with Saigontourist. 
 
7. (SBU) COMMENT:  While Saigontourist and some of its 
subsidiaries are partly equitized, the company retains its 
inefficient SOE character.  The company is too large, too complex 
and involved in many non-tourism activities (e.g. banking) or 
activities that are only partly tourism-focused (e.g. airlines). 
It appears that Saigontourist managers do not have a clear picture 
of their company\'s net worth; they are also secretive about the 
company\'s balance sheet.  Saigontourist is not subject to 
independent audits, and only large shareholders are privy to 
company meetings and reports.  While control of the firm is in 
state hands, it is not clear who represents the state\'s 
shareholding and this job likely falls to the General Director 
himself.  It is unclear if the General Director reports to anyone, 
though his selection is reportedly a joint decision by the HCMC 
People\'s Committee and Hanoi. Saigontourist wants to be 
competitive in the region, but for the most part the firm simply 
sits on a large pile of potentially valuable assets and manages a 
large group of second-rate hotels.

SUBJECT: NGUYEN CAO KY VISITS HCMC AGAIN - ADVISING THE GVN? 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  We met November 9 in HCMC with former Vice 
President of the Republic of South Vietnam Nguyen Cao Ky, who made 
headlines with a well-publicized reconciliation visit to Vietnam 
in January 2004.  Ky told us he was back on a \"quiet working 
visit\" to engage the GVN on Viet Kieu reconciliation as well as 
domestic socio-economic issues, including the Central Highlands 
and corruption.  Ky told us that GVN officials informed him that 
they had approved an initiative to rehabilitate a large ARVN 
cemetery near HCMC -- a gesture that the Mission had separately 
urged the GVN undertake in its efforts to build bridges with the 
Vietnamese community overseas.  Ky says that almost all GVN 
officials that he has met -- even many in the North -- are keen to 
improve ties with the United States, in part to act as a 
counterbalance to Chinese influence in the region.  End Summary. 
 
2.  (SBU) At the implicit suggestion of Special Envoy of the PM to 
the South, Vo Viet Thanh (septel), DPO and PolOff met November 9 
at the ConGen with Nguyen Cao Ky, former General and Vice 
President of the Republic of Vietnam.  Ky, who had been in country 
for two days, told us that he was in Vietnam as an unofficial 
advisor to the GVN on a range of issues, from the GVN\'s policy in 
the Central Highlands to its outreach efforts with the Vietnamese 
Diaspora in the United States.  Unlike his previous visit during 
the \"Tet\" holidays in January 2004, this visit was very low key. 
Ky expressed surprise to have received VIP treatment upon his 
arrival, having been whisked through customs by the External 
Relations Office, Police and other GVN officials.  Since his 
arrival two days ago, Ky said that he had met with Director of the 
HCMC Office of External Relations Hung, twice with special advisor 
to the Prime Minister Vo Viet Thanh and with Deputy Chairman of 
the HCMC People\'s Committee, Dr. Nhan.  Other meetings with GVN 
officials are planned in Hanoi, Danang, Nha Trang and Dalat over 
the course of the next month. 
 
Ties to the Viet Kieu and the United States 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) Ky said that he is a core member of a quiet process of 
reconciliation between the GVN and the Viet Kieu community in the 
United States.  Despite the negative press that his initial visit 
to Vietnam created in the Viet Kieu community in the United 
States, the long-term fallout to him and his family has been 
minimal.  He maintained that both in Vietnam and in the United 
States, hardliners were a dying breed.  This process of 
reconciliation has happened to him on a personal level as well. 
He said he and Vo Viet Thanh (who, inter alia, was a Viet Cong 
leader) now are \"brothers,\" a sentiment echoing Thanh\'s comments 
in our meeting with him November 8. 
 
4. (SBU) Ky said that he was particularly encouraged by a recent 
GVN decision to rehabilitate a major ARVN cemetery near HCMC.  He 
told us that in his February 2004 meetings with GVN officials, 
they had expressed real reticence to move forward, largely because 
the issue still was \"too sensitive\" for conservatives and military 
officials.  Ky advised them, however, that, \"if you want to 
reconcile with the Viet Kieu, you have to reconcile with their 
dead first.\" 
 
5. (SBU) Ky told us that three weeks ago he hosted a reception for 
visiting Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Phu Binhin 
Orange County and Binh said that the GVN had agreed to move ahead 
quietly with the cemetery\'s rehabilitation.  Ky said the GVN has 
assigned Deputy PM Pham Gia Khiem and the MoD to oversee the 
rehabilitation.  After the work is completed, Ky will lead a 
delegation of Viet Kieu to reopen the cemetery. 
 
6. (SBU) Ky added that officials in southern Vietnam had expressed 
a clear desire to forge close ties with the United States. 
Vietnamese officials were driven both by a fear of China by and a 
desire to expand business ties.  While he had not yet visited 
Hanoi on his current visit, during his January visit he had sensed 
more suspicion of the United States.  But even in Hanoi, Ky said 
that GVN officials had told him Vietnam needs to \"counterbalance\" 
China, a role that only the United States could play. 
 
Corruption 
---------- 
 
7. (SBU) Ky said GVN leaders clearly understand that corruption is 
the biggest threat to economic growth and, ultimately, the 
legitimacy of the one-party state.  In Ky\'s view, the fundamental 
problem is that almost all GVN and Party leaders are buried deep 
in corruption, making it hard for them to argue that the next 
generation of leaders should behave any differently.  This 
corruption, he said, goes all the way to the top of the Party and 
to the highest levels of the government.  What he saw in South 
Vietnam when he was Vice President pales in comparison with 
corruption in Vietnam today, Ky asserted. 
 
8.  (SBU) While part of the problem is structural -- Vietnam does 
not have the institutions to combat corruption -- Ky also 
indicated that the other part of the problem is ideological. 
Other than for old-timers in the party, Communism is dead. 
Vietnam, he argued, is left with a one-party state with no 
ideological moorings. 
 
Deja Vu in the Central Highlands 
-------------------------------- 
 
9.  (SBU) Ky said that GVN officials also have asked him during 
this visit to take a look at the problems they face in the Central 
Highlands.  Ky recounted the development, social 
disenfranchisement and minority/majority tensions over land that 
he had encountered as Vice President.  (Note:  With the exception 
of the new dimension of religious freedom, eerily similar 
conditions exist today.  End note.)  Ky said the key to easing 
problems in the region was to ensure that local officials are 
pressed from the center to implement the government\'s policies. 
Official development support from the international community also 
was important to help the process of reform in the Highlands.  In 
his opinion, GVN officials -- at least at the central level -- 
would welcome U.S. development assistance. 
 
10. (SBU) Comment:  The extent of Ky\'s influence within the Party 
and GVN in the south is difficult to gauge.  However, meetings 
with local heavyweights such as the Director of the HCMC External 
Relations Office and the HCMC People\'s Committee do not come easy 
to private individuals, especially Viet Kieu with only advice to 
give.  It is also interesting the Ky is making his second visit in 
less than a year, and this time with neither publicity nor 
propaganda aspects.  Ky\'s comments on a GVN decision to 
rehabilitate the ARVN cemetery near HCMC bear close watching, as 
we have been pressing the GVN to take such a dramatic step to 
break the ice with the Viet Kieu community.  So do Ky\'s comments 
that the GVN may be ready to accept U.S. development assistance in 
the Central Highlands.

HCMC 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 823; B) HCMC 232; C) HCMC 1388 
 
1.  (SBU) According to Pham Dinh Nhan (strictly protect), a leader 
of the Vietnam Evangelical Fellowship (VEF), an association of 
house church groups, in a trial the morning of November 12, the 
HCMC Criminal Court sentenced controversial Mennonite Pastor 
Nguyen Hong Quang to three years imprisonment.  While we have not 
yet seen the indictment, a June 15 diplomatic note from the HCMC 
External Relations Office (ERO) informed us that Quang was 
arrested for \"instigating a disturbance of public order and 
systematically resisting law enforcement officers\" (ref A).  (This 
would likely make the charge \"resisting persons in the performance 
of their official duties\", article 257 of the Penal Code.)  Five 
other members of Quang\'s unrecognized Mennonite Church were given 
sentences ranging from nine months to two years in prison on 
similar charges.  The case stems from a March 2004 incident when 
Quang and several followers were involved in an altercation with 
plainclothes police outside Quang\'s residence, which doubled as a 
house church (ref B). 
 
2. (SBU) In early November, the HCMC ERO denied our formal request 
to attend the trial, informing ConGen that attendance was not 
possible under Vietnamese law.  We subsequently were refused entry 
to the court on the morning of November 12. 
 
3. (SBU) According to Pastor Nhan, police \"visited\" his residence 
and that of other VEF leaders the evening of November 11.  Nhan 
surmised that the police sought to prevent the VEF from organizing 
in advance of the trial.  Late in the morning of November 12 after 
the police left, Pastor Nhan joined a small number of his 
followers outside the courthouse.  Their vigil was largely 
peaceful except for when one of the worshipers put on a white 
skullcap embroidered with a cross.  According to Nhan, at this 
point, the police approached Nhan and asked that the head covering 
be removed.  We understand the issue was resolved peacefully. 
 
4. (SBU) Nhan confirmed as authentic a letter dated November 5 
forwarded to diplomats from contacts abroad in which he and 21 
other VEF pastors called on the courts and the GVN to \"immediately 
put a stop to slandering and smearing the good name and the human 
dignity of the Rev. Nguyen Hong Quang.\"  Terming the letter 
\"mild,\" Nhan said that he had not intended for the letter to 
become public, adding that he could not control the actions of 
other VEF members.  Nhan said that he hoped that the letter\'s 
publication would not affect the VEF\'s budding dialogue with 
Vietnamese officials on the new legal framework on religion, due 
to come into effect on November 15 (ref C). 
 
5. (SBU) Comment:  Before his arrest in June, the firebrand Quang 
had become increasingly confrontational with local authorities. 
We have been encouraging our more moderate VEF contacts to strike 
a careful balance between supporting Quang and ensuring that they 
are not harmed by their association with the provocative pastor. 
This is particularly the case now, as our VEF contacts themselves 
acknowledge that the GVN -- for the first time -- is taking formal 
note of their concerns over the new legal framework on religion.

REF:  HCMC 1140 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Officials in the Central Highlands province of 
Dak Lak are keeping a tight lid on religious activities, 
particularly in the Protestant community.  According to GVN- 
recognized Southern Evangelical Church of Vietnam, only 4,300 of 
125,000 believers worship in \"official\" churches; the rest worship 
at home.  The tough attitude of local authorities may be a result 
of a \"Dega\" separatist presence within the house church movement. 
The harder line in Dak Lak is in contrast with neighboring Gia Lai 
Province where Catholic and Protestant leaders have been able to 
build some cooperative ties with authorities.  Religious leaders 
in Dak Lak welcome the new ordinance on religion but are skeptical 
about local implementation. End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) From November 15-17, HCMC PolOff and EconOff and Embassy 
Pol/C visited Buon Ma Thuot, the capital of the Central Highlands 
Province of Dak Lak.  Along with neighboring Gia Lai Province, 
which we visited in September (reftel), Dak Lak was a center of 
ethnic minority unrest in 2004 and 2001.  A key focus of the visit 
was religious freedom.  The local government showed little 
creativity on economic issues, but appeared to be implementing at 
least some GVN social and education initiatives for ethnic 
minorities.  We will report more on economic and social 
development issues in Dak Lak septel. 
 
Buddhists: Pacified 
------------------- 
 
3. (U) Thich Giac Dung, Thich Chau Quang and other members of the 
provincial board of the GVN-recognized Vietnam Buddhist Sangha 
(VBS) told us that their operations in Dak Lak were \"stable and 
normal.\"  Local media and provincial external relations officials 
also attended this meeting.  The monks said that there are 120,000 
Buddhists in the province, up from 85,000 in 1975, almost all of 
whom are ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh.)  (Over the past 30 years the 
population of Dak Lak has increased from 350,000 to 1.7 million.) 
The VBS in Dak Lak operates 124 pagodas, up from 80 in 1975. 
Prior to 1975 the Buddhist community ran a school that was 
\"voluntarily donated\" to the GVN.  The Sangha has no expectation 
of its return. 
 
4. (U) The VBS officials said that their organization is involved 
in charitable activities in the province.  Traditionally, the VBS 
focused on poverty alleviation and assistance to the province\'s 
four homes for victims of leprosy.  Recently, under the guidance 
of the GVN\'s Fatherland Front, the VBS has begun to focus on 
assisting the \"two thousand victims\" of Agent Orange in the 
province.  The VBS leaders called on the USG to assist the 
province in this area. 
 
SECV: Under Pressure 
-------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Pastors Y Ta Hmok, Y Ky Eban and Huynh Kim Thoa (all 
strictly protect), Chairmen of Dak Lak chapter of the Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam (SECV), described stringent 
restrictions on their 125,000-member community, particularly 
following ethnic minority unrest in the Central Highlands in April 
2004.  The Protestant community in Dak Lak is overwhelmingly 
ethnic minority -- only seven to eight thousand are majority Kinh. 
 
6. (SBU) The SECV leaders said that they need 300 churches to 
serve their community.  They said that there were other Protestant 
denominations operating in the area, including Seventh Day 
Adventists, Mormons and groups affiliated with the Vietnam 
Evangelical Foundation, an umbrella organization for the country\'s 
house church movement.  In 2001, following GVN recognition of the 
SECV, the Dak Lak pastors submitted to provincial authorities a 
list of 71 churches for recognition.  Two were immediately 
approved and another three were approved in January 2004.  One of 
these five churches is located in Dak Nong, which was split from 
the province of Dak Lak early this year. The remaining four 
churches serve 4,300 persons.  The pastors said that all other 
Protestants worship at home in small family units.  The SECV has 
petitioned the provincial Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA) to 
allow local communities to gather in larger groups for Christmas, 
but has not yet been given a reply.  According to Pastor Huynh, 
prior to April 2004, police tolerated gatherings of up to 300 
worshipers at a time in some districts in the province. 
 
7. (SBU) The Pastors confirmed the presence of a \"Dega Protestant\" 
church movement in the province, but would not elaborate further. 
They said that some of the April 2004 protestors were calling for 
religious freedom but many had been lured into participating by 
protest organizers (NFI) who promised land and GVN aid would 
result.  Others were told that they would be resettled in the 
United States. 
 
8. (SBU) The SECV pastors were skeptical about the impact of the 
new Ordinance on Religion on SECV activities in the province, 
including the recognition of new churches.  They said that the new 
legal framework could improve conditions for recognized churches, 
if implemented according to the letter of the law.  Local 
government is the problem, however.  The pastors told us that 
\"what we hear from the center is good, but the reality on the 
ground is different.\" 
 
9. (SBU) A leader of the SECV in neighboring Gia Lai Province told 
us that there is greater tension and distrust between the SECV and 
local authorities in Dak Lak than in Gia Lai.  He explained that 
both sides -- the local SECV and Dak Lak provincial authorities -- 
are to blame.  He said that Dak Lak officials have long espoused a 
hardline approach toward ethnic minorities.  The post-1975 \"Dega\" 
separatist movement had its origins in Dak Lak Province, and the 
SECV there includes pastors and laymen linked to the \"Dega\" 
movement.  While the church in Gia Lai sticks to religious issues, 
the Dak Lak SECV is politicized as well as both internally divided 
and disorganized, Kim said. 
 
Catholic Church: Ready to Test the New Ordinance 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
10. (SBU) Bishop Nguyen Tich Duc and Father Tran Van Phuc, Chief 
of Staff of the Dak Lak Diocese (both strictly protect), told us 
that conditions for the Catholic Church had improved, but they 
hoped for faster and more comprehensive improvement.  The diocese, 
which covers Dak Lak and Dak Nong Provinces as well as four 
districts of neighboring Binh Phuoc Province, has over 303,000 
members.  Of these, nearly 55,000 are ethnic minority.  There were 
roughly 67,500 registered Catholics in the province in 1975.  In 
Dak Lak Province alone, the Catholic Church records approximately 
189,000 believers, 32,000 of them ethnic minority. 
 
11. (SBU) The diocese has an acute shortage of priests.  There are 
only 70 active registered priests in the diocese -- 38 in Dak Lak 
-- but 105 active churches.  In one extreme case, one priest 
serves 24,000 worshipers in his parish.  A number of other parish 
priests each serve 15,000 to 20,000 parishioners.  There has been 
little progress in returning the church property confiscated after 
1975, although the Bishop was hopeful that the diocese would soon 
receive a small building that the local government \"borrowed\" for 
a five-year term over twenty years ago. 
 
12. (SBU) Bishop Duc declined to comment on unrest in the Central 
Highlands, but said that no Catholics were involved in the 
protests.  Duc said that he appreciated recent central government 
initiatives to improve the welfare of ethnic minorities in the 
province, but cautioned that he would have to wait and see what 
really happens on the ground.  He was cautiously optimistic about 
the impact of the new religious ordinance on Church operations in 
the province. 
 
13. (SBU) Duc indicated that he planned to test the ordinance by 
ordaining up to 21 new priests without prior approval of the 
authorities.  The diocese also has 31 students training at the Nha 
Trang seminary. 
 
Provincial CRA: \"No Unrecognized Churches in Dak Lak\" 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
14. (SBU) In a meeting that included critiques of USG human rights 
policy, the Vietnam Human Rights Act and demands that the USG 
assume responsibility for Agent Orange war-legacy issues, Vo Thi 
Li, Head of the provincial Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA), 
said that the Dak Lak government fully protected religious 
freedom.  Her description of the Buddhists and Catholics largely 
tracked what the communities\' religious leaders told us. But she 
claimed her statistics show 3,000 Protestants in the province, 
\"although the SECV might have a larger number.\"  The CRA chief 
also maintained that there are no unrecognized churches or a house 
church movement in the province. 
 
15. (SBU) Li said that over the past month she had conducted two 
separate briefings on the religious ordinance based on materials 
that the central-level CRA provided.  One briefing was for 200 
local officials, who would train provincial officers down to the 
village level.  The second meeting was for 120 provincial 
religious leaders.  The Dak Lak CRA chief told us that she would 
\"try to implement what is indicated by the ordinance.\"  She did 
not anticipate major changes in the CRA\'s procedure or practice 
under the new legal framework. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
16. (SBU) The Dak Lak CRA was the least encouraging of any we have 
met thus far in southern Vietnam.  Officials in the Central 
Highlands fear the \"Dega\" separatists in the Protestant community; 
the entire community is affected as a result.  In Gia Lai, the 
SECV has a working relationship with somewhat more flexible 
provincial officials.  In Dak Lak there is limited contact and no 
constructive dialogue.

SUBJECT: DAS DUGAN VISITS UBCV BUDDHIST LEADER IN HCMC 
 
REF:  2003 HCMC 1010 and Previous 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  Thich Quang Do, Secretary General of the 
outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) told DRL DAS 
Elizabeth Dugan that he strongly opposes the GVN communist 
government.  In his first meeting with USG officials since he was 
placed under de facto \"pagoda arrest\" in October 2003, Thich Quang 
Do welcomed international pressure on Vietnam, lauded the USG 
decision to designate Vietnam a Country of Particular Concern 
(CPC), but opposed sanctions.  He said there were no religious 
differences between the UBCV and the GVN-recognized Vietnam 
Buddhist Sangha; his struggle was against authoritarian, one-party 
rule.  Thich Quang Do reported that he would attempt to visit 
ailing UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in Central Vietnam the 
following day.  Despite our request to HCMC authorities, Thich 
Quang Do\'s visit was blocked on November 22 and reportedly was 
summoned to meet GVN officials as early as November 24.  End 
Summary. 
 
Foe of the Party 
---------------- 
 
2. (SBU) A strong and energetic UBCV Secretary General Thich Quang 
Do struck a defiant posture as an implacable foe of the Communist 
Party and the GVN in a meeting with visiting DRL DAS Dugan and the 
Consul General on November 21.  Meeting with USG officials for the 
first time since October 2003 when he was placed under unofficial 
\"pagoda arrest,\" (reftel) Thich Quang Do said that he will carry 
on his struggle to have the Vietnamese people live in dignity 
under a government that respects human rights.  (Note: We had 
informed the authorities that we planned to visit the monk at the 
Thanh Minh Zen Monastery Pagoda and met with no interference. 
There was noticeable police presence around the Pagoda.  Thich 
Quang Do said that he had been encouraged by the police not to 
meet with us.  He fully expected to suffer some consequences as a 
result of our visit, but made clear that he was neither afraid nor 
concerned. End Note) 
 
3. (SBU) The 77-year old monk said that the GVN was more heartless 
than pre-1975 Saigon regimes, telling DAS Dugan that it took the 
self-immolation of six UBCV monks to bring down the regime of 
South Vietnamese President Diem in 1963.  In contrast, at least 12 
Buddhist monks have immolated themselves after 1975 (NFI), but the 
Communists haven\'t flinched.  Thich Quang Do acknowledged that 
Vietnam had made economic progress since 1975.  He argued, 
however, that this did not translate into greater human rights or 
personal freedom.  Rather, Vietnam\'s leadership was using the 
country\'s prosperity to strengthen its hold on society.  He 
criticized the lack of a free press in Vietnam, the export of 
labor and the rise of marriages of Vietnamese women to foreigners, 
saying that these policies led to both groups\' exploitation. 
 
4. (SBU) Thich Quang Do said that there were no religious or 
doctrinal differences between the banned UBCV and the GVN- 
recognized Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS).  Prior to 1975, 75 
percent of all Buddhists in South Vietnam belonged to the UBCV. 
Many of these now are leaders in the VBS; Quang Do considers them 
all \"brothers.\"  He said that the creation of the VBS reflected 
GVN efforts to neutralize Buddhist strength.  Communist Party 
leaders recognize that a unified, independent Buddhist 
organization would grow \"beyond their control\" and would be 
dangerous to the regime.  The GVN would never allow this to 
happen, the UBCV leader told us. 
 
Yes CPC; No Sanctions 
--------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) Thich Quang Do welcomed USG and Congressional pressure on 
human rights and religious freedom issues.  He applauded the 
designation of Vietnam as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC). 
He urged continued diplomatic pressure but said that he did not 
favor sanctions against Vietnam, as sanctions would only punish 
the people, and not the regime. 
 
Thich Quang Do\'s travel prevented 
--------------------------------- 
 
6. (SBU) The UBCV General Secretary told us that he would attempt 
to visit the ailing UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in Binh Dinh 
Province the following day.  He did not know if the GVN would 
allow him to travel as he remained under unofficial pagoda arrest. 
(Per ref, Thich Quang Do\'s was placed under pagoda arrest for 
allegedly possessing state secrets after he participated in an 
\"illegal\" UBCV organizational meeting in Binh Dinh province in 
October 2003.) 
 
7. (SBU) Early November 22, assistants to Thich Quang Do contacted 
ConGen to inform us that HCMC police were preventing the UBCV 
leader from leaving the city.  In response, DPO contacted the 
Deputy Chief of the HCMC External Relations Office Le Hung Quoc to 
encourage the authorities to allow Thich Quang Do to proceed. 
Quoc did not respond.  (Septel reports on Ambassador Marine\'s 
November 22 call on UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in  hospital 
in Quy Nhon.) 
 
8. (SBU) We were later informed that in the afternoon of November 
22, Thich Quang Do was allowed to depart HCMC only to be stopped 
once again in neighboring Dong Nai province some 30 kilometers 
north of HCMC.  Thich Quang Do and his accompanying monks were 
escorted back to HCMC under police escort, and  Do was returned to 
his pagoda.  The monk is in good condition, according to his 
staff.  We understand that Thich Quang Do has been instructed 
report to the People\'s Committee Office as early as November 24. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
9. (SBU) Thich Quang Do made it clear that he is a political 
rather than a religious opponent of the Government.  Strong-willed 
and energetic, he will not compromise with Hanoi, at least so long 
as the Communist Party maintains a monopoly on power.  Other 
dissident and religious leaders described to DAS Dugan a much more 
nuanced view of the GVN and individual rights in Vietnam (septel). 
10. (SBU) From his references to the dramatic role the UBCV played 
in toppling the Diem regime in 1963, the UBCV leader clearly 
believes that he holds latent power in Buddhist-majority Vietnam. 
He also made it clear that he would use that power to rally monks 
to oppose the Communists were he given the chance.  The Communist 
Party, which exploited the agitation of the UBCV and other 
religious-groups to further its goals pre-1975, also knows its 
history well.  In this context, its response is no surprise. 
 
11. (SBU) We will continue to monitor closely the GVN\'s handling 
of Thich Quang Do.  We also will attempt to intercede as 
appropriate to ensure that the UBCV leaders receive the best 
possible treatment from local authorities.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS UBCV PATRIARCH THICH HUYEN QUANG 
 
REF: A) HCM 572; B) Hanoi 3187 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: The Ambassador visited the Most Venerable Thich 
Huyen Quang, Patriarch of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of 
Vietnam (UBCV), at Quy Nhon General Hospital November 21.  Thich 
Huyen Quang confirmed that he remains under unofficial pagoda 
arrest, although local officials arranged his hospitalization. 
The 86-year-old monk expressed his gratitude for the ambassador\'s 
visit and sought USG support for the creation of a religious 
school for its monks.  Unlike UBCV General Secretary Thich Quang 
Do, who sharply attacked the GVN in a November 21 meeting in HCMC 
(septel), the patriarch did not raise broader political issues 
with the Ambassador.  In a separate meeting, Chairman of the Binh 
Dinh Provincial People\'s Committee told the Ambassador that Thich 
Huyen Quang \"may request permission to travel as soon as he is 
healthy\" and that he would allow it.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On November 21, the Ambassador met for 20 minutes with 
UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in a VIP room at Quy Nhon General 
Hospital.  The 86-year-old religious leader has been receiving 
treatment for a stomach hemorrhage; local GVN officials arranged 
for his hospitalization on November 18.  Thich Huyen Quang was on 
an IV drip and remained in bed throughout the visit, but his voice 
was strong and he greeted the Ambassador with a firm handshake. 
Thich Huyen Quang stated that his health had improved 
considerably, and he expected to be released the next day.  (Note: 
Currently, he remains in the hospital.)  Although local officials 
accompanied the Ambassador to the hospital, the meeting was 
private except for two doctors and one nurse who remained in the 
room. 
 
3. (SBU) Contradicting information circulating on the internet 
that local officials refused to provide medical treatment to him 
in the past, Thich Huyen Quang stated he had not made any previous 
requests for treatment, although he acknowledged that he had been 
ill for some time.  When asked why he did not receive treatment 
earlier, he simply said he \"didn\'t think of it.\"  Thich Huyen 
Quang confirmed that prior to his hospitalization, he was not 
allowed to leave his pagoda, remaining under virtual house arrest 
since October 2003 when he was stopped from traveling to Ho Chi 
Minh City with other UBCV monks.  He stated that it was \"very 
difficult\" for him to communicate with UBCV Deputy Head Thich 
Quang Do in Ho Chi Minh City who is also under unofficial pagoda 
arrest.  He did not directly respond to the Ambassador\'s offer of 
USG assistance to try to facilitate the visit of his UBCV Deputy. 
On November 22, HCMC and Dong Nai province police forces prevented 
Thich Quang Do from visiting.  (DAS Dugan\'s November 21 visit with 
UBCV General Secretary Thich Quang Do and Thich Quang Do\'s failed 
attempt to travel to visit his mentor will be reported septel.) 
 
4. (SBU) In contrast to his statements to Ambassador Burghardt in 
April 2004 (Ref. A), Thich Huyen Quang said he saw \"no reason\" why 
the outlawed UBCV should merge with the GVN-recognized Vietnam 
Buddhist Sangha (VBS).  When asked what the Ambassador could do 
for him, Thich Huyen Quang emphasized the UBCV\'s need to establish 
a school to train its next generation of leaders from primary 
school through graduate studies. 
 
Provincial Leadership Takes Conciliatory Tone 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
5. (SBU) In a subsequent meeting, Mr. Vu Hoang Ha, Chairman of the 
Binh Dinh Provincial People\'s Committee, told the Ambassador that 
Thich Huyen Quang \"may request permission to travel as soon as he 
is healthy\" and indicated that he would approve the request. 
Chairman Ha expressed his frustration with dealing with the UBCV 
and pointed out that he and other senior provincial officials had 
visited Thich Huyen Quang several times over the past year and had 
promptly transferred the UBCV leader to the hospital in response 
to his request.  Ha noted that two officers of the Ministry of 
Public Security had donated blood when Quang was in need of a 
blood transfusion the previous week.  He also claimed that his 
staff had been arranging for Thich Huyen Quang to travel to Hanoi 
\"earlier this month,\" but those plans had to shelved due to the 
Patriarch\'s health problems. 
 
6. (SBU) When asked by the Ambassador why an ill 86-year-old man 
was seen as a threat to the GVN, Chairman Ha said that the UBCV 
brought on their current problems with the GVN themselves by 
holding an \"illegal Congress\" in September 2003 (reftel).  Ha 
stated that the UBCV could only hold such meetings if it was a 
registered religious group.  The Ambassador pointed out the 
difficulty in registering a religious group without first holding 
internal discussions about the issue.  Ha replied that the GVN 
does not wish to be involved in the UBCV\'s deliberations on 
whether to unify with the VBS or seek to register as a separate 
religious organization, but offered no suggestions as to how its 
leaders could come to such a decision when they are not permitted 
to meet or even speak to each other. 
 
7. (SBU) Comment: While we would like to think otherwise, Chairman 
Ha is not likely to be able to fulfill his promise of more lenient 
treatment for Thich Huyen Quang in the future.  In October 2003, 
Thich Huyen Quang was allowed to leave Binh Dinh Province, only to 
be stopped in Khanh Hoa Province on his way to Ho Chi Minh City. 
Upon his return to Binh Dinh, Quang was placed under unofficial 
pagoda arrest.  The GVN\'s decision to prevent Thich Quang Do from 
traveling from HCMC to visit his ailing mentor probably is a more 
accurate gauge of GVN attitudes towards the UBCV and reflects its 
intention to keep the UBCV on a very tight leash.   End Comment.

LAK PROVINCE 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1464 B) 1173 HCMC C) HCMC 1140 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  The Central Highlands Province of Dak Lak 
appears to be following Hanoi\'s directives to improve the economic 
and educational status of ethnic minorities.  Discrimination and a 
plantation economy have left the ethnic minorities poor and 
disenfranchised.  Provincial officials claim to have cut in- 
migration, initiated land reforms and begun to tackle the 
education deficit in the minority community.  Local officials 
downplayed the issue of minorities crossing into Cambodia, stating 
that migration was a result of economic difficulties not political 
oppression.  A visit to two villages showed some progress but 
continued official suspicion towards minorities.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) A joint HCMC-Hanoi team visited Buon Ma Thuot, the 
capital of the Central Highlands Province of Dak Lak November 15- 
17 to review ethnic minority issues.  Dak Lak was a center of 
ethnic minority unrest in 2001 and 2004 as was neighboring Gia 
Lai, which we visited in September (refs B and C).  During the 
visit, we discussed ethnic minority issues with the Chairman of 
the People\'s Committee, the Provincial Director of the Ministry of 
Public Security, a number of officials at the Department of 
Planning and Investment and the Heads of the Committees for 
Minority and Religious Affairs.  The team also visited the 
Highlands\' Tay Nguyen University, coffee and rubber plantations -- 
key employers of ethnic minorities -- a boarding school for ethnic 
minorities and two ethnic minority villages, one without our GVN 
minders.  (Issues of religious freedom and the province\'s economic 
outlook are covered in refs A and septel respectively.) 
 
3. (SBU) Dak Lak Province has changed considerably since 
unification in 1975, but left its ethnic minority population 
disenfranchised economically and politically in the process. 
Until 1990, ethnic minorities comprised a majority in the 
province.  By 2004, the province\'s 510,000 ethnic minority 
inhabitants comprised less than 30 percent of the population. 
This in-migration of ethnic Vietnamese (Kinh) also raised the 
population five-fold from 350,000 in 1975 to 1.7 million in 2004. 
 
4. (SBU) Plantation cash-crop agriculture predominates in Dak Lak. 
Local officials told us that the province expanded from 7,000 
hectares of coffee under cultivation in 1975 to 164,000 hectares 
today, and Dak Lak now produces 60 percent of Vietnam\'s coffee. 
In 1975 the province had 2,000 hectares of rubber under 
cultivation; 23,000 hectares today.  Thirty years ago the province 
had no pepper, cotton or cashew industry; now it is a large 
producer of these products.  As reported septel, ethnic Kinh, not 
the province\'s ethnic minorities, have benefited most from these 
new agricultural opportunities.  All the company directors we met, 
both state-owned and private, said they employed only a small 
percentage of ethnic minorities. 
 
5. (SBU) Mr. A Ma Phong, Head of the Provincial Committee for 
Minority Affairs (CMA), acknowledged that the province\'s economic 
development had largely bypassed ethnic minorities.  Some 60 
percent of persons in the province under the poverty line are 
ethnic minority, although minorities comprise less than 30 percent 
of the population.  Similarly, only 48 percent of the ethnic 
minority households are electrified.  Overall, 72 percent of 
households in the province are wired to the grid. 
 
6. (SBU) Mr. Mai Van Thin, Vice Dean of Tay Nguyen University, 
told us that 11 percent of the University\'s recently expanded 
student body of 6,370 are ethnic minority students drawn from 
throughout the Central Highlands.  Since its founding in 1977, 13 
percent of the University\'s roughly 7,700 graduates have been 
ethnic minority students. 
 
New initiatives 
--------------- 
 
7. (SBU) People\'s Committee Chairman Nguyen Van Lang and CMA Chief 
Phong stressed that the province has begun to implement measures 
mandated by Hanoi to address economic and educational disparities 
between the ethnic Kinh and ethnic minorities: 
 
-- As of 2004, the province banned in-migration from other 
provinces.  Chairman Lang added that, in recent years, in- 
migration had been ebbing as land became scarcer and the price of 
coffee declined. 
 
-- the province has banned land transactions between ethnic 
minorities and majority Kinh.  The province wishes to stem the 
practice of Montagnards selling their land to ethnic Vietnamese 
only to be left with nothing after a few years, forcing them to 
press for additional land handouts from the Government.  In tandem 
with this policy, the province is focusing on improving the 
productivity of minority farmers. 
 
-- each of the 38 poorest communes in the province -- most, if not 
all, ethnic minority -- will receive a 500 million Dong (USD 
31,750) budgetary supplement for development.  Children in these 
communities also will receive free education, free schoolbooks and 
free medical care.  The province is in the process of establishing 
13 boarding schools for ethnic minority children to serve these 
communities.  These schools will feed into the ten high school- 
level boarding schools the State has established for ethnic 
minorities, the CMA Head said.  The province also is considering 
establishing remedial training centers for older ethnic minority 
workers to enhance their competitiveness in the labor market, 
Chairman Lang told us. 
 
-- Of the 1,500 new teachers being trained in the province, one- 
third are ethnic minority, Chairman Lang said.  He added that Dak 
Lak has begun to develop a bilingual curriculum for some of its 
minority students. 
 
-- The CMA Chairman said that the province has initiated a survey 
to identify which ethnic minority families have substandard 
housing or insufficient land to maintain themselves.  The state 
will ensure that all ethnic minority families have at least two 
thousand square meters of rice paddy and one hectare of other 
arable land.  Those who live in forested areas will receive 10 
hectares of forest. 
 
-- Some 200 families have been given nine million Dong (USD 570) 
each to build new homes, the CMA Chairman told us.  Five million 
Dong comes from the central budget and four million from the 
provincial budget.  The province has identified 16,612 households 
that require housing assistance. 
 
Montagnard border flight and Visas 93 
------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) Provincial officials downplayed the problem of ethnic 
minorities crossing into Cambodia, calling it a \"normal 
phenomenon.\"  They maintained that the bulk of border crossings 
are family or business oriented visits to neighboring ethnic 
minority villages in Cambodia.  Many crossed \"erroneously\" as the 
border is not well demarcated.  The Province\'s Ministry of Public 
Security Director did not raise the issue of Montagnard flight 
with us, even though we broached border control issues with him. 
However, a pastor affiliated with the GVN-recognized Southern 
Evangelical Church of Vietnam told us in late October that police 
and military units still are heavily deployed along the Cambodian 
frontier to prevent ethnic minority cross-border flight. 
 
9. (SBU) Chairman Lang acknowledged that \"some\" Montagnards sought 
to flee because of economic hardship in the province.  He and CMA 
Head Phong maintained that many ethnic minority members had taken 
out large bank loans to plant coffee only to struggle when prices 
declined sharply.  Only a small minority has been encouraged to 
flee by \"Dega\" separatists such as Kok Ksor and the North Carolina- 
based Montagnard Foundation, who hoped to use the refugee issue to 
embarrass Vietnam. 
 
10. (SBU) The People\'s Committee Chairman and the CMA Chief 
asserted that any ethnic minority individuals who wish to leave 
and join their families in the United States would be allowed to 
do so.  They denied that any Montagnards are being prevented from 
applying for passports or are having their applications buried in 
procedure.  The only exception was for those individuals who broke 
the law (NFI) or had unpaid bank debt.  Chairman Lang recommended 
that ConGen notify the HCMC External Relations Office (ERO) of 
pending Montagnard follow-to-join cases.  He said that HCMC ERO 
would then work with the province to facilitate processing. 
 
Village Visits 
-------------- 
 
11. (SBU) An unscheduled stop without our minders at a roadside 
ethnic minority village some 40 kilometers south of Buon Ma Thuot 
confirmed that some progress was being made.  The village was 
relatively prosperous and was at least partially electrified. 
Villagers told us that many had sufficient land -- a few families 
were making between two and three million Dong (USD 120-180) per 
month, others only one-tenth that amount.  The small community had 
at least 15 students in high school; many of them were hoping to 
go on to college. 
 
12. (SBU) However, even in this relatively successful minority 
village, not all was well.  Within ten minutes of our arrival, 
plainclothes police appeared and ordered us to depart, informing 
us that it was a \"banned area.\"  We later learned that at least 
some members of that community had participated in the unrest in 
April 2004.   The province planned a second, \"typical\" village 
visit.  The 46-person community clearly was relatively prosperous. 
However, we later found out that the village elder was a member of 
the province\'s Fatherland Front committee and an atypical ethnic 
minority member of the Province\'s political elite. 
 
Impact of Drought; Low Coffee Prices 
------------------------------------ 
 
13.  (SBU) Provincial officials were fretting over the impact of 
drought on the province\'s economy.  Nguyen Xuan Huong, Deputy 
Director of the Dak Lak Department of Planning and Investment 
(DPI), told us that up to 80 percent of the province\'s farmland 
was under threat. The DPI foresaw loses of 600 billion Dong (USD 
38 million) in the agricultural sector, roughly 15 percent of the 
province\'s USD 250 million export earnings in 2003.  Locals in the 
province also continue to agonize over depressed coffee prices.  A 
local producer told us that a kilo of beans sells for 7,500 Dong 
(USD 48 cents), down 35 percent from only a few years ago.  He 
told us that, at its peak in 1994, Dak Lak coffee would sell for 
over 40,000 Dong a kilo (over USD 3.00 at 1994 official exchange 
rates.) 
 
14. (SBU) Comment:  Most, if not all, the province\'s initiatives 
appeared to be have been launched or expanded since ethnic 
minority unrest first flared in 2001 or since the second wave of 
protests in 2004.  The good news is that local authorities, who in 
the past have denied that anything was amiss, now seem to be 
trying to do something about the problem.  However, their remedies 
will take time to have an impact, even if properly implemented. 
That said, over the near term, drought and depressed agricultural 
prices could heighten difficulties facing both ethnic Kinh and 
ethnic minority residents reliant on cash crops such as coffee. 
It is far from clear if the local and central governments\' 
economic and education programs are sufficient to undo years of 
neglect and discrimination that contributed to the Montagnards\' 
current difficulties.  Dak Lak provincial officials did not show 
willingness to partner with NGOs to bring in development 
expertise.

SUBJECT: DAK LAK PROVINCE - CONTROL INHIBITS GROWTH 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1464 B) HCMC-DEPT EMAIL 10/8/04 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Local leaders in the Central Highland province 
of Dak Lak loathe to relinquish economic control are missing the 
chance for growth in tourism, industry and agriculture. 
Agriculture, the mainstay of Dak Lak\'s economy, has been hit by 
falling world coffee prices and drought.  State Owned Enterprises 
(SOEs) dominate the provincial economy and substantial development 
assistance from EU members and Japan is focused on infrastructure. 
The long-running Krong Ana-McCullagh bilateral investment dispute 
awaits resolution in Hanoi.  Religious freedom and ethnic minority 
issues are addressed Ref A and septel.  END SUMMARY. 
 
2. (SBU) The Chairman of Dak Lak\'s People\'s Committee, the 
Department of Planning and Investment (DPI), and the Department of 
Trade and Tourism reported that Dak Lak is growing at an annual 
rate of 8 percent.  They would like to further develop the 
province by focusing on agriculture.  Dak Lak produces about 60 
percent of Vietnam\'s coffee with exports of about USD 193 million 
in 2003.  However, Dak Lak has suffered as a result of falling 
world prices.  According to coffee farmers, a kilo of raw beans is 
currently worth VND 7,500 (about 48 cents), compared to the VND 
40,000/kilo in 1994 (about USD 3.50 at the official exchange rate. 
Dak Lak is looking to move away from coffee in areas where it is 
less productive; substitute crops include cocoa, cotton and corn. 
Coffee production in the coming year will also be harmed by 
drought, which DPI estimates will cost Dak Lak VND 600 billion 
(about USD 38.4 million) in total farm output.   Dak Lak also 
exports cashews, rubber, pepper, bee honey and wood products; the 
province exported USD 250 million in goods in 2003. 
 
3. (SBU) Government leaders stated that agriculture and agro- 
industry would be the basis for future growth but were vague on 
concrete plans.  DPI focused on the province\'s \"7,000 Agent Orange 
victims.\"  In response to questions, they said Dak Lak has 1,300 
private enterprises, most of them small enterprises with low 
levels of capital.  The DPI admitted the province had only two 
foreign direct investment (FDI) projects, one a UK joint venture 
licensed in 1995 and valued at USD 10.5 million.  The other was a 
failed joint venture between a state-owned coffee enterprise, 
Krong Ana, and a U.S. company, McCullagh International Inc. 
 
TOURISM 
------- 
4. (SBU) Provincial leaders were similarly vague about plans to 
develop tourism in Dak Lak, another stated goal.  Dak Lak could 
become an attractive location for eco-tourism, with waterfalls, a 
national park and cultural activities based on the way of life of 
ethnic minorities.  However, when we made an impromptu visit to an 
ethnic village with a tour guide, police quickly arrived to order 
us to depart.  The remainder of our tour was promptly cancelled, 
as was that of a Danish couple who happened into the area at the 
same time.  When ECONOff raised this incident with the Department 
of Trade and Tourism, officials denied that any part of the 
province (other than military bases) was off-limits to tourists. 
We pointed out to provincial leaders that ethnic minority-linked 
tourism could be a major draw, but to attract substantial numbers 
of foreign tourists, they will have to ease controls on access. 
Only 16,000 of Dak Lak\'s 200,000 annual tourists come from 
overseas. 
 
SOEs CONTINUE TO DOMINATE 
------------------------- 
5. (SBU) ECONOff visited state-owned coffee, cashew and rubber 
companies.  The Ea Ka Cashew-Nut Company is slated for 
equitization in 2005, and the Dak Lak Rubber Company plans to 
equitize parts of the company not directly involved in rubber 
production, such as its wood-processing factory.  The three 
companies obtain raw agricultural goods from farmers in a variety 
of ways, including buying from agents, harvesting from their own 
lands, and buying the harvests of farmers to whom the companies 
have provided land and investment capital.  Under the latter 
system, the companies provide land and/or plants, as well as 
supplies like fertilizer.  With the coffee and cashew companies, 
the farmers must sell a portion of their crop back to the 
companies, but they may keep a portion (sometimes as much as 50 
percent) to sell independently.  The rubber company requires 
farmers participating in its \"small-holder\" program to sell the 
rubber they harvest to the company for 20 years; for the remaining 
10 years of the trees\' productivity, the farmers may sell the 
rubber independently, and they receive any revenues from selling 
the trees for wood processing after that. 
 
6. (SBU) Hiep Phuc Trading and Tourism Company is one large 
private enterprise that has had success in Dak Lak.  Ms. Nguyen 
Chi Phuc, owner of the family-held company, said Hiep Phuc started 
out as a coffee trading enterprise and exports 10,000 tons of 
coffee a year.  The company operates a water park that attracts 
about 3,000 visitors a year; Ms. Phuc admitted she had no plans to 
expand this part of her business because of the province\'s anemic 
tourism sector.  Hiep Phuc also develops real estate in Dak Lak, 
as well as in coastal Khanh Hoa province and Hanoi.  Ms. Phuc, a 
Khanh Hoa native, would not disclose the volume or value of the 
company\'s real estate investments, nor who her partners are.  Hiep 
Phuc\'s palatial offices, complete with fountains and crystal 
chandeliers, seem to indicate that Hiep Phuc\'s \"investments\" -- as 
Ms. Phuc called them repeatedly -- are paying off. 
 
7. (SBU) All the companies, state-owned and private, indicated 
they employ a small percentage of ethnic minorities.  The Dak Lak 
Rubber Company employs the largest number; about 1,000 of its 4779 
employees come from ethnic minorities.  Of the 1,155 households 
participating in the company\'s small-holder program, 1038 are 
ethnic minority.  The other companies reported that ethnic 
minorities made up fewer than 25 percent of their personnel.  Ms. 
Phuc reported that her ethnic minority employees generally had a 
poor work ethic compared to her Kinh employees. 
 
ODA FOCUSED ON INFRASTRUCTURE 
----------------------------- 
8. (SBU) People\'s Committee Chairman Lang reported Dak Lak has 
received commitments for more than USD 100 million in bilateral 
official development assistance (ODA), including USD 70 million 
from Denmark.  USD 42 million of the Danish ODA was to improve the 
water supply of Buon Ma Thuot, Dak Lak\'s capital city. USD six 
million in Danish ODA was for administrative reform and eight 
million for clean water supplies in villages. (COMMENT: Lang 
observed that Denmark\'s interest in Dak Lak likely stems from the 
fact that the family of the Queen\'s husband owned a coffee 
plantation in Dak Lak. END COMMENT.)  USD 15 million in Japanese 
ODA was focused on roads and power, as was the bulk of the USD 12 
million in German ODA.  Kuwait has committed USD five million for 
irrigation development.  Additionally, the World Bank is helping 
the province develop its roads and rubber industry, and the Asian 
Development Bank is funding the construction of a 1,000-bed 
hospital in Buon Ma Thuot as well as some rural health clinics. 
 
MCCULLAGH-KRONG ANA DISPUTE 
--------------------------- 
9. (SBU) ECONOff visited Krong Ana Coffee Company, which has been 
mired in an investment dispute since 1997 with McCullagh, its U.S. 
joint venture partner.  Krong Ana\'s director, Tran Tam, reported 
the partners are still waiting for GVN approval of the proposed 
settlement to the dispute. (Ref B) According to Tan, under the 
deal, which has the blessing of the partners and provincial 
authorities, Krong Ana would buy out McCullagh\'s share of the 
coffee processing venture for USD 557,000 and would shoulder the 
venture\'s USD 476,000 in debt.  Tam reported that McCullagh 
provided about USD 878,000 in investment capital when the joint 
venture started in 1995. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
10. (SBU) Dak Lak appears to have significant economic potential, 
particularly in the area of agriculture and agricultural 
processing.  Private enterprise is virtually untapped in the 
province.  However, in conversation after conversation with 
provincial authorities there was a lack of desire and vision to 
push Dak Lak\'s economic development much further.  As our meeting 
with Dak Lak\'s main private enterprise indicated, vested interests 
get what they need to live comfortably; further development and 
opening up of the province would only threaten these interests and 
reduce the government\'s ability to keep a lid on socio-economic 
forces in the district, particularly in the substantial and 
restive ethnic minority community.

SUBJECT: DRL DAS DUGAN IN HCMC: HUMAN RIGHTS, RELIGION, WOMEN\'S 
ISSUES 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1481 B) HCMC 1465 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  Religious leaders and human rights dissidents 
told DRL DAS Dugan that despite strict GVN controls, they have 
seen improvement in human rights and religious freedom.  They 
welcomed continued pressure on Vietnam but cautioned against 
sanctions.  Recognized religious groups planned to test the 
provisions of the new Ordinance on Religion.  Protestant house 
church leaders had concerns over the new law\'s implications.  GVN 
officials stressed their commitment to expand gradually human 
rights in Vietnam and asked for USG patience.  The HCMC Women\'s 
Union outlined efforts to assist trafficked women and sex workers 
and to counsel Vietnamese overseas brides, especially to Taiwan. 
Dugan welcomed dialogue with GVN leaders, stressed the importance 
of human rights and religious freedom to the United States and 
urged the GVN to build partnerships with religious organizations 
to combat social evils.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) DRL DAS Elizabeth Dugan and Senior DRL Advisor Susan 
O\'Sullivan visited HCMC November 20 to 22 to assess human rights 
and religious freedom issues.  They met with Deputy Chairman of 
the HCMC External Relations Office Le Hung Quoc, five Vice- 
Chairman of the HCMC Fatherland Front, Cardinal Man, and a Central 
Highlands leader of the recognized Protestant Southern Evangelical 
Church of Vietnam (SECV).  The DRL team visited a women\'s shelter 
run by the HCMC Women\'s Union, met with HCMC social activists, and 
attended a Protestant House Church service.  DAS Dugan also 
discussed met with dissidents Father Chan Tin, Dr. Tran Khue and 
the wife of Dr. Nguyen Dan Que.  They also were the first USG 
officials to meet with Buddhist leader Thich Quang Do since his 
placement in unofficial \"pagoda arrest\" in October 2003.  (HCMC 
1465 and HCMC 1481 report on the status of Dr. Que and on DAS 
Dugan\'s meeting with Thich Quang Do, respectively.) 
 
GVN: \"the glass is half full\" 
----------------------------- 
 
3. (SBU) The External Relations Office and the Fatherland Front 
noted their commitment to improve human rights.  Fatherland Front 
officials said they were leading a process of step-by-step 
\"democratization.\" However, the GVN\'s first priority is poverty 
eradication and raising living standards.  ERO Deputy Director 
Quoc said Vietnam has made real progress on human rights over the 
past ten years and more will be made in the next five.  Patience 
and giving Vietnam room to develop is key, they argued.  GVN 
officials said that CPC designation was unwarranted.  While there 
are \"isolated\" problems caused by \"uninformed\" local officials, 
the majority of Vietnamese enjoy greater religious freedom than 
ever. 
 
Dissidents: CPC Yes, Sanctions No 
--------------------------------- 
 
4. (SBU) Dissidents Tran Khue, Mrs. Tam Van -- wife of imprisoned 
activist Dr. Nguyen Dan Que -- and Father Chan Tin thanked DAS 
Dugan for U.S. efforts to promote human rights in Vietnam.  They 
noted that Vietnam has made progress in expanding personal 
freedoms over the past 10 years, but much more was needed.  Father 
Chan Tin was skeptical that the new ordinance on religion would 
expand religious freedom.  Tran Khue called for greater 
transparency in government and for the eventual end to one-party 
rule.  Mrs. Que thanked DAS Dugan for USG support of her husband 
and hoped for his amnesty. (Ref A)  Father Chan Tim and Dr. Tran 
Khue applauded the USG for CPC designation, but opposed any 
sanctions.  In a separate meeting, Thich Quang Do of the banned 
United Buddhist Church of Vietnam also supported CPC designation, 
but opposed sanctions. (Ref B) 
 
SECV and Catholic Church: weighing the new ordinance 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
5. (SBU) A Central Highlands SECV leader told DAS Dugan that 
conditions for the SECV in the province of Gia Lai were difficult, 
although improving.  He noted that he was in frequent contact with 
the provincial Committee for Religious Affairs (CRA) and other 
local officials.  This dialogue and the SECV\'s decision to steer 
clear of Montagnard separatism or other \"political\" demands have 
been the keys to progress.  The SECV contact said that since 
September the local authorities approved opening three churches -- 
out of six requested -- although one of the three remains mired in 
a dispute over the name of the church. 
 
6. (SBU) Calling the new ordinance \"difficult for me and the local 
authorities,\" the SECV representative noted that he has held 
discussions with the provincial CRA as well as Ministry of Public 
Security (MPS) officials from Hanoi on implementation of the law, 
which came into effect November 15.  He said that the SECV had 
been asked by the CRA to detail its plans for compliance.  The 
SECV has a list of 85 churches and 440 \"meeting points\" but has 
not submitted it to the authorities for registration.  The SECV 
fears that if registration is denied, the police will use the list 
to close \"unauthorized\" places of worship.  In the interim, the 
SECV submitted to the Hanoi MPS and local CRA a list of SECV 
pastors and officials in the province.  The provincial CRA asked 
the SECV to remove one of the pastors, claiming a past affiliation 
with the Montagnard separatists.  Thus far the SECV has refused. 
The SECV pastor told us that he also secured a promise from the 
Hanoi MPS that they would \"reorient the psychology\" of local 
police officials who remain suspicious of Protestants. 
 
7. (SBU) Cardinal Pham Minh  Man, Archbishop of HCMC, told DAS 
Dugan that he will reserve judgment on the new ordinance until he 
can test provisions that give the Church freedom to ordain and 
transfer priests and to participate more fully in charitable and 
social services.  He told DAS Dugan that because of GVN 
restrictions on the Church\'s charitable activities, a number of 
programs have been forced underground.  Examples he cited include 
a shelter run by nuns for pregnant women, a street children center 
and an HIV/AIDS clinic in HCMC.  He hoped that a recent GVN 
invitation to Catholic nuns to work in GVN HIV/AIDS clinics might 
suggest a change in GVN thinking about the Church\'s role. 
 
Protestant House Churches: On the outside looking in 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
8. (SBU) After attending a Protestant house church service in an 
outer district of HCMC, DAS Dugan met with Pastor Pham Dinh Nhan 
(strictly protect), a leader of the Vietnam Evangelical Foundation 
(VEF), an umbrella organization for Vietnam\'s house churches. 
Pastor Nhan welcomed USG efforts to promote religious freedom in 
Vietnam.  He said that almost all house churches faced periodic 
police harassment, although the frequency of harassment has 
decreased.  The house church that DAS Dugan visited had been 
subject of police inquiry 12 times since its creation, but none in 
the past year. 
 
9. (SBU) Nhan said that the Ordinance on Religion presented house 
churches with difficult decisions.  He confirmed that there has 
been dialogue with local CRA and MPS officials on how house 
churches fit in the new legal framework.  The sticking point is 
that GVN officials do not wish to recognize the \"scattered\" house 
churches as places of worship.  The large number of Protestant 
denominations and the lack of a hierarchal structure in the 
Protestant community add to the GVN\'s difficulty in dealing with 
the house church movement, Nhan said.  Some in the house church 
movement fear that the GVN will use the law a pretext to close all 
house churches.  As a result, attendance at some house churches in 
HCMC was down on November 21 -- the first Sunday under the new 
law.  (Note:  Except for the house church of controversial 
Mennonite Pastor Nguyen Hong Quang, we have heard of no GVN effort 
to close house churches since the ordinance came into effect.  End 
Note.) 
 
Women\'s Center of HCMC: a drop in the bucket 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
10. (SBU) DAS Dugan visited the Center for Disadvantaged Women and 
Children, run by the HCMC Women\'s Union, part of the Fatherland 
Front.  The Center is supported financially by AFESIP, a French 
NGO.  The Women\'s Union representatives explained that the Center 
is a GVN-approved pilot project to help female victims of 
trafficking, prostitution and drug addiction.  The Center promotes 
HIV awareness and distributes condoms to prostitutes, provides 
vocational training and helps its clients reintegrate into 
society.  The programs are run by three \"peer\" advisors, former 
sex workers who are now employed full time by the center. 
 
11. (SBU) In its first two years of operation, the Center had 
assisted 52 young women and teenagers -- 19 currently are Center 
clients.  Of the 52 women assisted by the Center, four were \"lured 
into prostitution,\" 17 became prostitutes of their own volition, 
18 were victims of sexual abuse, and 11 are \"at risk\" children 
from poverty stricken or abusive homes.  Another two young 
Vietnamese women were brought to the Center after being found 
abandoned in a hotel in HCMC.  The two were to be trafficked to 
Taiwan, according to the Women\'s Union officials.  The Center 
estimates that there are 10,000 to 15,000 sex workers in HCMC. 
 
12. (SBU) The Women\'s Union representatives told DAS Dugan that in 
2004 they had launched a second self-funded initiative -- an 
advisory center to counsel Vietnamese women who plan to marry 
foreign husbands.  The Center has counseled 479 prospective brides 
to date.  The Women\'s Union hopes that the Center will be able to 
develop the capacity to check the bona fides of foreigners on 
behalf of prospective Vietnamese brides.   The Union hoped to 
minimize tragic situations such as a number of Vietnamese women 
who unknowingly were married to disabled South Korean men to be 
their caregivers. 
 
13. (SBU) The Women\'s Union representatives told DAS Dugan that, 
from 1993 through May 2004, 41,900 women from Vietnam\'s 
southernmost 13 provinces became overseas brides.  The rate of 
overseas marriage is on the rise -- some 5,000 per year from 
Vietnam\'s 13 southern provinces in the last three years. 
According to the Women\'s Union, 32 percent married Taiwanese 69 
percent married men who were at least 20 years their elder.  80 
percent were unemployed prior to marriage and 75 percent had low 
education levels -- some were illiterate.  Many did not speak 
their future husband\'s language.  On average, the brides\' families 
received 6 million Dong (USD 360) from marriage brokers, according 
to Women\'s Union statistics. 
 
14. (SBU) In her meetings with Vietnamese officials, DAS Dugan 
applauded the Women\'s Union for its efforts but noted that the 
needs far exceeded the Union\'s -- and the GVN\'s -- limited 
resources.   She noted that in the U.S. and elsewhere, religious 
groups provide support in dealing with difficult social issues. 
DAS Dugan encouraged her interlocutors to build stronger 
partnerships with Vietnam\'s religious organizations to tackle 
social problems.

SUBJECT: VIETNAM\'S SOUTHERN ECONOMIC TRIANGLE SUCCESS 
 
1. (SBU) Summary: Consul General and ConGen team traveled to 
Dong Nai and Binh Duong provinces to examine the two 
provinces\' economic performance that is double the national 
average.  Local officials credit their economic success to 
1990\'s policy decisions creating the southern economic 
zones.  In our view what separates these provinces is the 
leadership of local officials and their investor-friendly 
attitude.  Provincial authorities, particularly in Binh 
Duong, also appear to extend this \"laissez faire\" approach 
to religious freedom issues.  Despite the two provinces\' 
track records and Hanoi\'s apparent encouragement, other 
provinces are slow to follow Binh Duong and Dong Nai\'s lead. 
Risk-taking is still not the norm for most provincial 
leaders.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) Over the past decade, the provinces of Dong Nai and 
Binh Duong, adjacent to HCMC, have consistently grown at 
double Vietnam\'s national average.  Other provinces with 
comparable proximity to HCMC have not kept pace.  To better 
understand what underpins this success and to obtain 
investment information for American businesses, the CG and 
Econ, Pol, Consular and FCS officers visited Dong Nai and 
Binh Duong Provinces on November 10 and November 23, 
respectively. 
 
Dong Nai: \"we should walk together with business\" 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
3. (SBU) The Chairman of the People\'s Committee of Dong Nai, 
the Director of the Department of Planning and Investment 
(DPI), and the Deputy Head of the Dong Nai Industrial Zone 
Authority (IZA) emphasized their firm commitment to 
promoting a business-friendly environment in the province. 
They said that the GVN\'s economic reforms in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s had given them the impetus and legal 
foundation to act.  They credited their proximity to HCMC\'s 
markets, airport, and ports as a catalyst for the province\'s 
growth.  Dong Nai also has pre 1975 experience with 
industry.  Bien Hoa 1 Industrial Zone was established as 
Vietnam\'s first industrial zone in 1963 and was well 
positioned to restart Vietnamese industrialization when Doi 
Moi began in 1986. 
 
4. (SBU) According to the province\'s Chairman, Mr. Vo Van 
Mot, Dong Nai Province is able to maintain a high growth 
rate averaging 12-13 percent per year because of rapid 
growth in the industrial sector.  In 2003, the industrial 
sector -- half the local economy -- grew 19 percent. 
Services, which comprise a quarter of the Dong Nai economy, 
grew at 12 percent in 2003.  Dong Nai is home to 3,141 
domestic invested projects and 570 Foreign Direct Investment 
(FDI) projects. 
 
5. (SBU) The Dong Nai officials said that, to sustain their 
success, the Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) and 
the Industrial Zone Authority, with the assistance of the 
People\'s Committee, often amend regulations to make them 
more favorable to investors.  Dong Nai\'s DPI routinely 
interacts with investors to provide information on 
investment, facilitate operations, and to resolve problems. 
Chairman Vo told the CG that the province advocates on 
behalf of investors -- foreign and domestic -- with the 
central government when the issue is beyond their local 
control. 
 
6. (SBU) Calling FDI an \"integral part of our economy,\" 
Chairman Vo said he was not satisfied with the province\'s 
current FDI stock.  While large by Vietnamese standards, in 
real terms FDI investment is modest, especially compared to 
China.  He acknowledged that private business needs better 
access to capital markets and that restructuring of SOEs 
remains a problem.  According to the Chairman, SOEs still 
hold the largest share of the province\'s economy, although 
private enterprise has been growing more quickly. 
 
7. (SBU) Provincial officials also briefed the CG on a new 
airport initiative.  Tan Son Nhut Airport in Ho Chi Minh 
City is expected to reach full capacity by 2012.  As a 
result, the Southern Airports Authority (SAA) has proposed 
building a new international airport at Long Thanh in Dong 
Nai Province, eventually becoming the sole international 
airport for the region.  According to the Dong Nai DPI 
Director, construction will begin in 2010.  However, the SAA 
is still looking for potential investors and has yet to 
undertake a feasibility study.  In addition to the new 
airport, Dong Nai is planning to relocate one of Ho Chi Minh 
City\'s major seaports to the province. 
 
Binh Duong:  Success Breeds Success 
----------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) As in Dong Nai, provincial leaders in Binh Duong 
province credited GVN policies for creating conditions that 
allowed them to achieve a nearly 15 percent growth rate last 
year. According to the Binh Duong People\'s Committee, the 
province has attracted 868 FDI projects from 34 countries, 
with a total investment value of USD 4.1 billion, about 9 
percent of Vietnam\'s entire FDI stock. In 2003, the province 
attracted 135 new FDI projects, while another 106 foreign 
investors increased their capital investment for a total 
capital investment of USD 458 million. There are 26 U.S.- 
linked FDI projects in Binh Duong totaling USD 200 million, 
roughly 17 percent of the total U.S. FDI outlay in Vietnam. 
These investments range from several hundred thousand 
dollars to 80 million dollars, according to People\'s 
Committee Chairman Nguyen Hoang Son. 
 
9. (SBU) While giving Hanoi the lion\'s share of the credit, 
Chairman Son said Binh Duong had been able to attract 
investors because the province has a cooperative attitude 
and is willing to learn from foreign investors.  He told the 
CG that the province\'s focus is to simplify procedures and 
address investor concerns.  The province recognizes that 
building an investor-friendly reputation will make it easier 
to attract greater investment.  In this regard, Binh Duong 
has organized its own overseas trade missions to attract 
FDI. 
 
10. (SBU) Provincial leaders also emphasized that while FDI 
gives the province valuable cachet and foreign know-how, 
they also have been working hard to attract domestic 
investment.  In recent years domestic investment has begun 
to outstrip FDI in the province.  Chairman Son added that 
Hanoi has begun to recognize Binh Duong\'s economic 
achievements and has recommended that other provinces visit 
to copy Binh Duong\'s best practices.  It was up to the 
leadership of a particular province to follow suit, he said. 
(Note: The former head of the Communist Party in Binh Duong, 
Nguyen Minh Triet, was promoted to the Politburo and to lead 
the HCMC Party Committee after helping guide Binh Duong\'s 
economic development in the early 1990s.  End note.) 
 
American Investors Satisfied 
---------------------------- 
 
11. (SBU) Managers of U.S.-affiliated companies in both 
provinces praised provincial leadership for its transparency 
and efficiency.  They noted that the inflow of domestic and 
foreign investment was creating upward pressure on salaries, 
particularly for management-level positions.  The investment 
also has exhausted the local labor market.  Today industry 
uses recruiters to hire employees from the Mekong Delta or 
central Vietnam.  However, despite the added costs, the two 
provinces remained the business representatives\' first 
choice for any new investment in Vietnam. 
 
12. (SBU) In meetings, provincial authorities were open to 
new ideas and input on how to attract greater American 
investment.  The CG suggested several areas of improvement, 
including improved legal transparency and intellectual 
property rights protection.  He also encouraged the 
provinces\' leaders to urge the GVN to conclude negotiations 
for WTO accession. 
 
Freedom of Religion 
------------------- 
 
13.  (SBU) Binh Duong also appeared to take a more 
progressive approach to religious affairs than do most other 
provinces.  The provincial Head of the Committee for 
Religious Affairs (CRA) and the Deputy Director of the 
Ministry of Public Security (MPS) told us that they 
recognized that religious freedom issues were very 
sensitive.  They were consulting with local religious 
leaders, including members of the nascent house church 
movement in province, about the Ordinance on Religion.  Binh 
Duong MPS and CRA officials told us that they had no plans 
to use the law to close house churches, but would work to 
encourage house churches to register their operations under 
the new legal framework.  We later met with the leader of a 
200-member house church in Binh Duong who told us that, in 
contrast to prior years, her church has faced no police 
harassment in 2004.  She added that over the past year, she 
had been able to develop a good working relationship with 
local police and the CRA and was beginning to think about 
the process of registration under the new law. 
 
14.  (SBU) The outgoing Bishop of Dong Nai, Phaolo Maria 
Nguyen Minh Nhat, told us that relations between the Church 
and the government in the province are gradually improving. 
In particular, the Bishop said that much of the mutual 
suspicion that existed between Church and State in the years 
after unification had dissipated.  He said that the next 
day, the church would celebrate the investiture of its new 
Bishop -- at least 3,000 persons were expected to attend the 
ceremony.  (Note:  With one million believers, the Dong Nai 
- Binh Duong - Vung Tau diocese is the largest in Vietnam. 
Many are refugee families from the former Communist- 
controlled North Vietnam who were resettled during partition 
in 1954.)  As in other provinces in southern Vietnam, the 
Dong Nai diocese is looking forward to testing provisions of 
the Ordinance on Religion that increase its autonomy, such 
as the right to appoint and transfer priests. 
 
15. (SBU) In contrast to his counterpart in Binh Duong, the 
CRA Chairman in Dong Nai told us that he planned to enforce 
provisions in the new legal framework on religion that ban 
the operation of religious organizations that are not 
registered with the Government.  However, to date, we have 
not received any reports of local authorities using the law 
to crack down on house churches in Dong Nai province. 
 
16. (SBU) Comment: Dong Nai and Binh Duong Provinces are 
doing well by any measure. Both provinces engineered an 
almost complete transformation of their economies from 
predominantly agrarian to overwhelmingly industrial and 
services-based in as little as 10-15 years.  The key to 
their success is leadership.  Other provinces have similar 
proximity to HCMC or other ports and airports; none have the 
same rate of growth.   Despite the two provinces\' track 
records and Hanoi\'s apparent encouragement, other provinces 
have been slow to follow or to promote reformers to 
leadership positions. Despite the Binh Duong/Dong Nai model, 
steadiness, state control and caution are still seen as the 
route to job stability by most provincial leaders in 
Southern Vietnam. End comment.

SUMMARY 
 
1. (SBU) Shrimp farming in the coastal Mekong Delta province 
of Soc Trang is driving economic growth and poverty 
eradication.  Beneficiaries include the large ethnic Khmer 
minority.  Reports from exile groups of disenfranchisement 
and oppression of the Khmer appear out of date.  The GVN 
began a long-term effort to improve the conditions for the 
Khmer in 1998, and the rapid growth of aquaculture has made 
provided cash to the Khmer community as evidenced by 
construction and rehabilitation of Khmer temples and 
pagodas.  Soc Trang leadership appeared both more confident 
and more open than neighboring provinces and was frank about 
both recent successes and ongoing challenges including a 
growing HIV/AIDS problem.   End Summary 
 
A RISING TIDE OF SHRIMP 
 
2. (U) Consul General, Econoff, Conoff and Pol/Econ 
specialist traveled through the coastal Mekong Delta, 
visiting Soc Trang on December 4.  A historically poor 
coastal province, Soc Trang\'s population of over 1.2 million 
includes majority ethnic Kinh (65 percent) as well as Khmer 
(29 percent) and Chinese (6 percent) minorities.  Per capita 
income remains low at USD433, but GDP has been growing at 
close to ten percent per year over the past four years as 
marginal, salinized rice paddies have been turned into 
highly productive small-holder shrimp farms.  In 2003 alone, 
aquaculture grew by 30 percent, with 11,000 additional 
hectares converted to shrimp ponds, producing over USD300 
million in export revenue.  By 2010, provincial leaders plan 
to have 80,000 hectares of aquaculture land. 
 
REDUCED ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WELCOMED 
 
3. (U) Saota Foods Joint-Stock Company (FIMEX VN) reported 
that the sharp reductions in antidumping duties announced by 
the US Department of Commerce on December 1 had an immediate 
impact in Soc Trang.  One of Vietnam\'s largest seafood 
exporters, FIMEX processed and exported USD78 million in 
shrimp from Soc Trang and neighboring provinces to the U.S., 
Japan and the E.U. in 2003.  Preliminary antidumping duties 
imposed by the USG at midyear cut 2004 exports to the US by 
half to about USD 15 million.  In the final determination, 
FIMEX and other exporters representing over half of 
Vietnam\'s production received a sharply reduced \"separate\" 
rate of between four and five percent.  Local shrimp prices 
in Soc Trang immediately rose by five percent according to 
FIMEX director Ho Quoc Luc, who is also the chairman of the 
Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers 
(VASEP).  Luc anticipated a sharp rise in export volume and 
prices paid to producers during the remaining month of 2004. 
FIMEX operates six individual processing lines on a large 
modern site in Soc Trang.  The firm directly employs 3200 
workers, 70 percent of whom are women, who earn USD40 to 
USD65 per month, jobs which did not exist in the province 
prior to the advent of aquaculture. 
 
KHMER ALSO RIDING THE TIDE 
 
4. (U) According to official Vietnamese history, Soc Trang\'s 
ethnic Khmer population and ethnic Kinh both appeared in the 
region at about the same time in the early 17th century. 
For their part, the Khmer claim to have been there much 
longer.  Whatever the case, the Khmer minority makes up a 
distinct community organized around Theravada Buddhist 
temples and pagodas that date back nearly 400 years.  In our 
first meetings with provincial officials, they claimed that 
Khmer and ethnic Kinh are highly integrated today. 
Subsequent discussions, including with the head of the 
Provincial Committee on Minority Affairs (himself a Khmer) 
indicated that the province is a salad bowl rather than a 
melting pot.  Ethnic Khmer and Chinese maintain their 
respective languages but learn Vietnamese as well.  The 
Chinese continue to concentrate in commerce, while the Khmer 
are mostly small farmers. Aquaculture is dominated by ethnic 
Kinh, many of whom employ Khmer workers.  We were told that 
some of the most prosperous Khmer owned shrimp ponds 
themselves.  At FIMEX, Director Luc was proud to point out 
the diversity of the firm.  He is ethnic Kinh, the Vice 
General Director was Chinese while his assistant/interpreter 
was Khmer. 
 
5. (U) First Vice-Chairman Nguyen Duy Tan and the heads of 
the Religious Affairs and Minority Affairs Committees stated 
that the Khmer had historically been disadvantaged and 
impoverished.  They credited the GVN\'s 1998 Program 135 with 
changing the situation.  Under this program the central 
government provided sustained financing to build schools and 
clinics, develop bilingual education and provide credit and 
employment opportunities.  The growth of aquaculture has 
also contributed significantly to the welfare of this 
community and the province.  Poverty in Soc Trang has 
decreased, with 19 percent of households falling under the 
poverty line, compared with 65 percent in 1992. Poverty 
among Khmer households is higher at 28 percent, but has 
declined significantly from 42 percent as recently as 2001. 
 
6. (U) To complement official meetings, CG and party took an 
unannounced and unescorted lunchtime drive through two 
heavily Khmer districts along the coast.  Vinh Chau district 
is home to over half of Soc Trang\'s Khmer population.  The 
majority Khmer province had extensive shrimp ponds in 
paddies that formerly grew a single rice crop per year. 
Crossing into the district, we drove over a large bridge 
just completed on December 1, 2004.  Roadwork is under way 
and new power lines stretched from Soc Trang town to the 
shore. Vinh Chau seemed representative of the rest of the 
province - still poor, but developing quickly. 
 
7. (SBU) We also visited two Khmer pagodas.  The first visit 
to Cha Tim Giua or Chrui Tum Kandal pagoda was unannounced 
and unescorted.  The Venerable Ly Huong was cautious in his 
answers on ethnic relations but made clear that his 
community has good access to bilingual education through the 
high school level and to health clinics.  The early 17th 
century main temple is in excellent condition and the pagoda 
is clearly active and a center of community life.  A large 
new temple hall is nearly complete and already in use for 
services.  The construction was funded entirely by 
contributions from the community and young monks were busy 
working with local contractors when we arrived. 
 
8.  (U) Soc Trang has 92 Khmer pagodas with an additional 36 
worshipping houses. We later met officially with the Most 
Venerable Duong Nhon and other members of the Executive 
Board of the provincial Buddhist Sangha.   While the meeting 
was kept at a formal level, the picture of economic 
development, religious life and ethnic relations was 
consistent with what we had heard and seen elsewhere.   We 
asked about the Khmer Buddhists ties outside of Vietnam. 
They said they had few contacts with Cambodia.  Prior to the 
Cambodian genocide, monks went to Cambodia for advanced 
religious training.  Since the genocide, some Cambodian 
Buddhists have trained in Vietnam.  The monks also said that 
they had no contact with exile Khmer groups in the US or 
Canada.  Both the Vietnamese authorities and the monks told 
us that they did not use the term \"Khmer Krom,\" which they 
said was a Cambodian and/or exile term with separatist 
implications. 
 
SOME ROADBLOCKS TO GROWTH 
 
9. (U) Despite Soc Trang\'s recent solid growth, First Vice- 
Chairman Nguyen Duy Tan said the province continued to face 
problems mobilizing investment resources. He expressed 
concern about the sustainability of growth due to the 
general poverty of the province and shortcomings in 
education, training, health care and infrastructure. The Soc 
Trang authorities generally seemed eager to attract foreign 
investment and development assistance 
 
10. (U) HIV/AIDS is also a growing problem in Soc Trang. 
Officials of the provincial Women\'s Union stated that since 
1992 perhaps 10,000 women from the province have worked in 
the sex trade in Cambodia or other cities in Vietnam and 
neighboring countries or gone to Taiwan as brides.  Some of 
the women have returned to Soc Trang with HIV/AIDS and 
spread the disease locally, they said. Women in Soc Trang 
are now contracting HIV more frequently than men, and the 
1,300 known HIV-positive cases may only be the tip of the 
iceberg. The Women\'s Union was eager for assistance and 
support for HIV/AIDS education and programs. 
 
COMMENT 
 
11. (SBU) Wealth from aquaculture is not equally distributed 
in Soc Trang, but the rising shrimp tide is raising most 
boats.  As in 2003 (reftel), reports from overseas sources 
of widespread discrimination and repression were not 
supported by anything we saw on this visit.  In fact, Khmer 
Buddhist culture appears to be doing well, thanks to the 
revenues from raising shrimp for American tables.

C)   HCMC 1554 
 
SUMMARY 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary:  The southern Mekong Delta is one of the 
fastest growing regions in Vietnam, driven by its expanding 
aquaculture industry.  With USDOC\'s recent announcement of lowered 
U.S. dumping duties on shrimp, a barrier to growth has been 
lowered.  However, increased resources are needed to ensure that 
shrimp farming is sustainable.  In order to realize shrimp\'s 
export potential, provinces must expand investment in 
infrastructure improvement and examine ways to strengthen the 
banking sector.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) The Consul General traveled to the southern Mekong Delta 
December 1-7 to visit the provinces of Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, and Soc 
Trang as well as Can Tho City.  These provinces are part of the 
Mekong rice bowl that produces USD 2.5 billion in annual exports 
and are the nation\'s main aquaculture producers, according to the 
Southwest Development Committee.  While shrimp has always been a 
Mekong product, major efforts to transform unproductive salinated 
rice land into shrimp farms started roughly five years ago.  Now 
shrimp is one of the region\'s most important exports.  Although 
aquaculture exports to the U.S. slowed in 2004 due to preliminary 
dumping duties of 12 to 93 percent stemming from the dumping suit 
against shrimp exporters in Vietnam and elsewhere, the final 
decision on duties has already prompted a renewed increase in 
shrimp exports and producer earnings, says Ho Quoc Luc, Chairman 
of the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers. 
All the provincial leaders we met welcomed the decision, although 
all maintained Vietnamese companies did not dump their shrimp in 
the U.S. market and should shoulder no duties at all. 
 
MEKONG SHRIMP PRODUCTION - \"NATURAL\" AND INDUSTRIAL 
 
3. (SBU) There are two primary types of shrimp farming:  natural 
and industrial.  Provincial officials say that \"natural\" shrimp 
farming uses a low density of shrimp in the ponds, and that since 
farmers do not use chemicals, environmental degradation is 
limited.  In industrial shrimp farming, 20-30 shrimp are packed 
into each square meter of pond, and companies use vitamins and 
ventilators intensively, with a much higher incidence of sickness 
in the product.  The Duyen Hai Bac Lieu Aquaculture Production and 
Service Company, Vietnam\'s largest 100-percent foreign owned 
aquaculture company, has a semi-industrial farming process massing 
only 6 shrimp per square meter of pond and requiring less day-to- 
day care with vitamins and ventilators.  Although provincial 
officials maintained that \"natural\" shrimp farming was almost 
completely organic and had little environmental impact, a small- 
scale shrimp farmer in Ca Mau\'s mangrove protection zone said he 
used industrial feed like larger-scale companies and that he was 
learning to use vitamins.  In Ca Mau, only 2.5 percent of the 
200,000 hectares of shrimp ponds use industrial farming processes, 
but in Soc Trang and Bac Lieu, respectively, 30 percent and 50 
percent of ponds are industrial shrimp farms.  In Bac Lieu, 
industrial farming produces only 30 percent of shrimp output due 
to the high incidence of illness. 
 
CONSERVATIVE PROVINCES HAVE NOT SLOWED GROWTH 
 
4. (SBU) Growth rates in these provinces has reached or surpassed 
10 percent in recent years, due primarily to the development of 
aquaculture and food processing.  Although the conservatism of 
provincial leaders has not slowed growth to date, it could prove 
problematic in the future.  A typical comment by Vice-Chairmen in 
Ca Mau and Can Tho was that \"to achieve development, provincial 
governments need to abide by central government laws.\"  The 
Southwest Development Committee, which has nominal responsibility 
for driving growth in the Mekong Delta, serves only as the eyes 
and ears of the government in Hanoi and does little to actually 
facilitate development.  While officials recognize the value of 
advancing the aquaculture and foodstuff industries, it seems 
unlikely that they would proactively encourage development 
independent of the central government. 
 
5. (SBU) Other provincial officials proved more dynamic and open 
to furthering sustainable development.  Le Khai Phong, President 
of Ca Mau\'s Union of Friendship Organizations, the agency involved 
in managing government and NGO funded projects, appears to have a 
clear and compelling vision for Ca Mau development.  He discussed 
Ca Mau\'s difficulty in attracting support for social issues such 
as poverty alleviation and infrastructure improvement.  Phong 
noted that Ca Mau had only 15 kilometers of asphalt road.  Like 
their counterparts in Ca Mau and Can Tho, the People\'s Committees 
in Bac Lieu and Soc Trang alluded to national unity but were more 
focused on attracting investment for sustainable development (ref 
C).  Bac Lieu People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Nguyen Thanh De 
discussed the current GVN policy to encourage greater 
competitiveness at the provincial level, promoting the concept 
that uncompetitive companies will die.  He also said the province 
was studying the examples of Thailand and Taiwan in order to 
develop a sustainable aquaculture industry and avoid the shrimp 
illnesses encountered in these countries. Increasing educational 
extensions for aquaculture was a topic all leaders in these 
provinces addressed. 
 
INFRASTRUCTURE STILL SUB-PAR 
 
6. (SBU) The lack of infrastructure for shrimp processing and 
export is another barrier to further development of the shrimp 
industry.  None of the four provinces visited have any direct 
outlet to overseas markets and must transport the shrimp over the 
2-lane National Highway 1 to Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC).  Can Tho is 
170 km and a 4-hour drive south of HCMC; the main shrimp producing 
and processing provinces we visited lie even further south.  The 
narrow Highway 1, the only artery for the region, is traversed by 
every type of vehicle.  The Ministry of Transportation is 
upgrading and widening the 234 km stretch of highway from Ca Mau 
to Can Tho using World Bank funds -- a project whose planned 
completion by the beginning of 2006 should help alleviate some 
regional transportation woes. 
 
7. (SBU) However, Highway 1 from Can Tho to HCMC remains over- 
crowded and dangerous.  All vehicles must use a ferry to traverse 
the Mekong between Can Tho and HCMC; the bridge on this stretch 
remains a work in progress, with an estimated finish date of 2008. 
Other construction projects to make Can Tho City into a viable 
\"Capital of the Mekong Delta\" are similarly stalled (ref A). 
Although upgrading Cai Ciu Port in Can Tho would allow Mekong 
exports to ship directly to overseas destinations and reduce 
shipping costs by $5 per ton of cargo, developers have finished 
only the first phase of the project, with no estimate of when they 
will finish or at of ultimate costs. 
 
IMMATURE BANKING SYSTEM 
 
8. (SBU) The lack of widespread financing for the shrimp industry 
may also slow growth and hinder expansion for smaller farmers. 
The banking system is still relatively new and has yet to earn 
public trust.  Thus, Bac Lieu leaders note, many in the Delta have 
plowed their new wealth into real estate, prompting an annual 20 
percent increase in housing prices.  Numerous construction 
projects can be seen along National Highway 1 and within all the 
towns we visited.  The lack of a financing system to reinvest 
earnings productively could be a long-term limiting factor for the 
shrimp industry. 
 
COMMENT 
 
9. (SBU) As the aquaculture industry continues to expand in the 
Mekong Delta, provinces need to concentrate on creating a 
sustainable industry.  While some provinces are aware of the need 
to increase education and investment to address issues such as 
shrimp illness and wastewater treatment, there is also a tendency 
to look for the easy path to quick development and ignore longer- 
term problems.  The environmental impact of shrimp farms, both 
industrial and natural, remains unclear.  Development of 
infrastructure and the financial sector are vital to building a 
sustainable aquaculture industry in the Delta.  End comment.

2. (SBU) SUMMARY:  An ECON HCMC-Hanoi and USAID visit to the 
Central Highlands province of Kon Tum revealed the area\'s economic 
and development situation is particularly desperate, even compared 
with its impoverished Central Highlands neighbors.  Trade and 
investment levels are low, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) 
dominate.  Government, local non-government organizations (NGOs) 
and some international organizations provide assistance for 
poverty reduction, including for ethnic minorities, but Kon Tum\'s 
average income is roughly half that of Vietnam as a whole, and 
ethnic minorities still largely fall outside the province\'s 
economic structure.  Kon Tum authorities are eager for U.S. 
assistance, which contrasts with other Central Highlands 
provinces, like Dak Lak, which are uninterested in any activity 
that might hinder government control of the province.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
LOW GDP, EXPORT, FDI AND ODA NUMBERS 
------------------------------------ 
 
3. (U) Hanoi Econ counselor, USAID Country Manager and HCMC 
EconOff visited Kon Tum December 13-15 to assess the province\'s 
economic and development progress.  The northernmost of the 
Central Highland provinces, Kon Tum is a thinly populated and 
densely forested area that borders Cambodia and Laos.  According 
to local authorities, more than half of Kon Tum\'s 370,000 
residents are ethnic minorities, and 64 percent of the province is 
forested. 
 
4. (SBU) Kon Tum People\'s Committee Chairman-elect, Mr. Ha Ban, 
reported that Kon Tum\'s average annual growth rate in the last ten 
years was 11 percent.  However, much of this growth was due to 
exploitation of the province\'s forest resources, which has been 
halted.  Figures that give a more realistic picture of Kon Tum\'s 
economic status are per capita GDP, export turnover, foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and overseas development assistance (ODA). 
According to Chairman-elect Ban and his colleagues at the 
Departments of Planning and Investment (DPI) and Trade and 
Tourism, per capita GDP in 2004 is $260, barely half the national 
average.  Kon Tum exports less than $10 million a year in goods, 
mainly coffee and furniture.  The province has only one FDI 
project, a $4.5 million Thai investment in a tapioca processing 
plant that is under construction.  In the last ten years, Kon Tum 
has received only $40 million in ODA, mostly from the European 
Union (EU) for infrastructure projects.  These numbers compare 
unfavorably with neighboring Dak Lak Province, which, for example, 
exports $250 million a year and has received $100 million in ODA 
from Denmark alone (ref A). 
 
5. (SBU) Kon Tum authorities appeared to be pinning their hopes 
for growth and development on the planned Ho Chi Minh Highway, 
which will trace the path of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.  Local leaders 
hope the highway\'s intersection - 300 kilometers north of Kon Tum 
-- with the East-West Corridor highway from Danang across 
Southeast Asia to Burma will open up the province to more regional 
trade and tourism.  Kon Tum authorities also noted with pride that 
Kon Tum is part of the development triangle identified by the 
prime ministers of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia that includes nine 
Vietnamese provinces and neighboring provinces in Laos and 
Cambodia.  However, specifics on how this triangle of provinces 
will promote development were not forthcoming. 
 
SOEs AND A LITTLE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
------------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) That SOEs still dominate Kon Tum\'s economy was 
illustrated during our visit to the local branch of the Bank for 
Investment and Development, an SOE itself.  According to Mr. Tran 
Lam, the bank\'s director, loans to SOEs make up 70 percent of bank 
lending because \"there are very few private enterprises in Kon 
Tum.\"  Mr Lam said the bank primarily lends to state-owned coffee 
and rubber companies because they create the most jobs in the 
province and the bank can thus contribute to employment and 
poverty reduction.  The only three banks with branches in Kon Tum 
are state-owned banks. 
 
7. (SBU) While most private enterprises in Kon Tum are small- 
scale, at least one private investor has had success in the 
province.  Duc Nhan Company produces outdoor furniture for export 
mainly to Europe; in 2004, the company expects to export 250 
containers of furniture.  Duc Nhan is one of 70 factories that 
contract with Danish furniture-maker ScanCom International. 
According to Nguyen Thanh Nhon, director of Duc Nhan, and Chad 
Ovel, managing director of ScanCom Vietnam, furniture companies in 
the Central Highlands like Duc Nhan originally developed because 
of their proximity to wood sources; with the stoppage of forest 
exploitation in Vietnam, furniture companies now import wood from 
South America, Malaysia and South Africa.  While a company like 
Duc Nhan is competitive in terms of low labor costs, the cost of 
transporting wood inland from seaports could in the future 
diminish the viability of furniture enterprises in the Central 
Highlands. 
 
ETHNIC MINORITIES POOR AND MARGINALIZED 
--------------------------------------- 
 
8. (SBU) According to Kon Tum authorities, 54 percent of Kon Tum\'s 
population consists of ethnic minorities.  Local agencies like the 
Department of Health, the Department of Labor, Invalids and Social 
Affairs (DoLISA), and the Women\'s Union have assistance and micro- 
credit programs for the poor, the majority of whom are ethnic 
minorities.  One standout is a Department of Health program to 
educate doctors to work in villages throughout the province.  Of 
the 90 medical students whose training is being funded by the 
Department of Health, 81 are ethnic minority members.  However, 
most of the ethnic minority population appears to fall outside the 
economic system.  Only one company we visited reported employing 
ethnic minorities, which made up 10-15 percent of that 
enterprise\'s workforce.  The state-owned Dak Uy Coffee Company 
reported it did not employ ethnic minorities because there were no 
ethnic minorities in the area from which they draw their 
employees. 
 
KON TUM EAGER FOR U.S. AID 
-------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) In virtually all of our meetings, local officials asked 
what U.S. aid might be available to the province.  They asked in 
particular for infrastructure assistance and noted the need to 
develop Kon Tum\'s limited road network.  USAID Country Manager 
described the nature of U.S. assistance to Vietnam and noted that 
USAID would be reviewing its Vietnam program next year.  Options 
for assisting Kon Tum in the areas of micro-credit or disabilities 
would be included in the review.  (NOTE:  USAID has one modest 
activity in the area, a low-key effort via the Pearl S. Buck 
Foundation on inclusive education for the disabled.  END NOTE.) 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
10. (SBU) While most of the Central Highlands provinces are 
plagued by low economic growth and the social/economic/religious 
dilemmas of the ethnic minority issue, Kon Tum appears especially 
affected by these problems.  The provincial leadership indicated a 
willingness to work with the United States, including allowing an 
active U.S. NGO presence, if the result was monetary assistance. 
This contrasts with the attitude of authorities in Dak Lak, who 
view further development and opening up of the province as a 
threat to the government\'s ability to keep a lid on local socio- 
economic forces (ref A).

SUBJECT: HCMC ECONOMIC LEADERS REPORT 2004 PROGRESS, LISTEN TO 
FOREIGN INVESTOR COMPLAINTS 
 
1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) government leaders for 
the third straight year reported to the foreign business community 
on the city\'s annual progress in achieving economic and 
development goals.  The leaders then listened as their audience 
articulated difficulties foreign businesses experience operating 
in Vietnam.  Growth, trade and investment statistics illustrate 
HCMC\'s position as Vietnam\'s economic powerhouse.  Yet 
infrastructure and legal reform - two areas where HCMC leaders 
cited achievements since 2003 - remain a focus of business 
frustration.  The willingness of local leaders to openly report on 
strong and weak points, and to accept public criticism, 
demonstrates a transparency reflecting the reform viewpoint of the 
officials who led the meeting.  END SUMMARY. 
 
HCMC CONTINUES TO ACT AS VIETNAM\'S ECONOMIC ENGINE 
 
2. (U) Top officials from Ho Chi Minh City\'s government met 
December 17 with representatives of foreign business to present 
statistics on growth, trade and investment in the region during 
2004 and to listen to foreign investor concerns.  According to Mr. 
Luong Van Ly, deputy director of HCMC\'s Department of Planning and 
Investment (DPI), HCMC\'s gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 11.5 
percent in 2004, driven mainly by industry, which grew by 15.1 
percent.  Total investment in HCMC reached $2.5 billion, Ly 
reported, and GDP per capita reached $1,800, a growth of 7.5 
percent since 2003. (NOTE:  According to the Asian Development 
Bank, GDP per capita for all of Vietnam in 2003 was $478.  END 
NOTE.)  HCMC recorded export turnover of $9.5 billion, most of it 
coming from domestic export enterprises.  HCMC registered 8,510 
new domestic enterprises in 2004, with total capital of close to 
$1 billion. 
 
3. (U) Mr. Truong Trong Nghia, vice president of HCMC\'s Investment 
and Trade Promotion Center (ITPC), discussed the contributions of 
HCMC and the southern economic zone (which includes HCMC and 6 
neighboring provinces) to Vietnam\'s economy.  While HCMC alone 
accounted for more than 18 percent of Vietnam\'s GDP, the southern 
economic zone accounted for 36 percent of the nation\'s GDP.  HCMC 
also accounts for 35.5 percent of Vietnam\'s exports and 26 percent 
of its foreign direct investment (FDI).  While HCMC\'s exports 
totaled $9.5 billion, its imports reached $5.1 billion, an 
increase of 16.8 percent from 2003.  The U.S. remained HCMC\'s main 
export market in 2004, accounting for 24.5 percent of exports. 
Hong Kong recorded the most FDI in HCMC in 2004 at $62.6 million. 
Singapore, Korea, Japan and the U.S. followed with FDI at $61.4, 
$50.4, $28.5, and $18.9 million respectively. 
 
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT 
 
4. (U) Following the recitation of 2004 statistics, the HCMC 
leaders presented the main frustrations articulated by foreign 
business in 2003 and what remedies HCMC had taken in 2004.  DPI\'s 
Luong Van Ly reported that business complaints in 2003 had focused 
on four areas: infrastructure, human resources, laws and 
regulations, and support to investors.  According to Ly, 
subsequent progress in these areas had included improved bus 
service, reduced telecom fees, an increase in the number of 
students receiving management training, a new decree that 
specifies both what documents an investor needs for a license and 
how HCMC departments coordinate licensing, and more information on 
government policies available online.  HCMC leaders acknowledged 
that further progress was still needed on bridges over the Saigon 
River, a subway system, zoning and transparency. 
 
5. (U) In response, expatriate business leaders seized on the 
deficiencies acknowledged by the local officials, harshly 
criticizing the lack of a coherent zoning plan for land use, for 
example, and citing this as a key deterrent to investment in the 
area.  People\'s Committee Vice Chairman Nguyen Huu Tin responded 
that city officials were working on a comprehensive zoning plan 
that they hoped to unveil in 2005.  Other criticisms from business 
focused on labor regulations, tax and accounting rules, opaque law- 
making and limits on cargo transport in the city. 
 
COMMENT 
 
6. (SBU) This reporting and feedback session was extremely useful, 
both for measuring Ho Chi Minh City\'s economic progress and for 
taking the pulse of the business community.  While the HCMC 
leadership provided initial explanations in response to business 
complaints, Vice Chairman Tin concluded the meeting by promising 
that the government would work to address investor concerns in the 
coming year.  The frank and candid discussion demonstrated the 
commitment to reform and transparency of local leaders, 
particularly Vice Chairman Tin, DPI\'s Mr. Ly, and ITPC\'s Mr. 
Nghia.  The latter two officials have extensive expertise stemming 
from their education in Europe and the United States, respectively 
- a background clearly reflected in their organization of this 
meeting.

SUBJECT: CHRISTMAS IN VIETNAM\'S CENTRAL HIGHLANDS 
 
REF:  A) HANOI 3392 B) HCMC 1587 
 
1. (SBU) Summary:  According to contacts in the Catholic and 
Protestant communities, Christmas services in the Central 
Highlands provinces of Gia Lai and Kontum were numerous and 
peaceful, although under heavy police and military scrutiny.  In 
contrast, Protestant services in Dak Lak province were sharply 
limited.  Our contacts echoed the GVN\'s allegation that some 
Montagnards in the U.S. were attempting to organize Christmas 
protests and a mass cross-border migration to Cambodia.  With few 
exceptions, Christmas celebrations were conducted freely elsewhere 
in Southern and Central Vietnam.  End summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 24, the GVN notified Embassy and ConGen of a 
\"Montagnard Foundation plot\" to cause unrest in the Central 
Highlands over Christmas and said it would deal severely with 
perpetrators (reftels).  ConGen has been in ongoing contact with 
Catholic leaders, the GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical Church 
of Vietnam (SECV) and unrecognized Protestant House church 
leaders.  They told us that there was a heavier than usual police 
and military presence throughout the Central Highlands.  In Gia 
Lai Province, one contact estimated that approximately 100 
Montagnards were detained.  Most were released after police 
questioning, although a few may still be in custody.  Our contacts 
heard reports of sporadic border crossings into Cambodia, but 
could not confirm any incidents. 
 
3. (SBU) Despite the tension over possible unrest, Protestant and 
Catholic contacts in Gia Lai and Kontum told us that their 
congregations observed Christmas without police harassment or 
interference.  The Kontum Catholic diocese (which covers Gia Lai 
and Kontum) said its Christmas celebrations this year were 
\"magnificent.\"  Diocesan officials noted that they secured 
permission from provincial authorities to hold additional services 
at fourteen temporary locations (4 in Kontum, 10 in Gia Lai) to 
meet demand. 
 
4. (SBU) In Gia Lai, the GVN-recognized Southern Evangelical 
Church of Vietnam (SECV) held services for over 75,000 -- mostly 
Montagnard -- followers.  Our SECV contact told us that SECV 
Christmas services were held at 16 recognized churches and another 
440 \"meeting points.\"  He added that the provincial government 
will recognize a 17th SECV church in the province on December 30. 
Other contacts told us that unrecognized house churches in Kontum 
and Gia Lai also were able to hold Christmas services without 
incident. 
 
5. (SBU) In Dak Lak Province, Catholic services were unimpeded. 
Local officials permitted Protestant services only at the four 
recognized SECV churches.  Police were widely deployed in 
Montagnard-majority villages and prevented other Protestant 
worshipers from congregating.  One source added that the phone 
lines of many house church pastors in Dak Lak were cut.  A second 
house church leader text messaged us that in the days before 
Christmas there were signs of impending unrest in a number of 
Montagnard villages.  As a result, he texted, local authorities 
\"blocked the church from organizing Christmas\" there. 
 
Was there a Montagnard Foundation \"plot\"? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
6. (SBU) Protestant community contacts said that the \"Montagnard 
Foundation\" was involved in organizing unrest and a mass cross- 
border migration of ethnic minorities.  One of our contacts, who 
helps establish house churches in Dak Lak, said that the 
Montagnard Foundation encouraged Dak Lak Montagnards to flee to 
Cambodia, promising resettlement in the United States.  Another 
contact told us that in Gia Lai, former members of FULRO and other 
\"Dega\" separatists were attempting to organize Christmastime 
protests but were detained by police.  (Note:  FULRO is the 
acronym for the insurgency that operated in the Central Highlands 
until 1992 and sought to create an independent Montagnard state. 
End Note.)  Our Gia Lai contact explained that the Montagnard 
Foundation is capitalizing on the frustration and alienation of 
the ethnic minority community in the Highlands. 
 
Services normal elsewhere in the South and Center 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
7. (SBU) Catholic officials said that services were packed 
throughout southern and central Vietnam with no reported 
incidents.  Protestant house church leaders told us that, barring 
a handful of exceptions, they heard of no reports of serious 
police harassment of the thousands of house church Christmas 
services in southern and central Vietnam. 
 
Comment 
------- 
8. (SBU) The clampdown on ethnic minority Protestants in Dak Lak 
is not unexpected in light of the GVN\'s indications of planned 
unrest. (More surprising is its sharing this information with us 
in advance.)  We also note that none of our religious contacts in 
the region contradicted GVN allegations of impending trouble or of 
Montagnard Foundation involvement.  Provincial officials in Gia 
Lai and Kontum demonstrated considerable confidence in allowing 
unimpeded Christmas celebrations in the face of possible unrest. 
In Gia Lai, the Protestant Community has firewalled itself from 
the \"Dega\" movement and established a working relationship with 
provincial officials.  In contrast, Dak Lak\'s provincial 
government remains the most hardline compared to other Central 
Highlands provinces and there is little constructive dialogue 
between officials and Protestant leaders to ease tension.

SUBJECT: DELTA FACES DIFFICULTIES ON THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY 
 
REF:  A) HCMC 1575  B) HCMC 1128 
 
1.  (SBU) Summary: Visiting the Mekong Delta, the Ambassador found 
that considerable investment in infrastructure, education and 
government reform are needed to set conditions for rapid economic 
growth.  The long, porous border with Cambodia is a challenge for 
local officials, who are struggling to combat trafficking in 
persons, HIV/AIDS and smuggling.  While early efforts are underway 
to strengthen border controls, there is much more to be done.  The 
region\'s universities are ill equipped to train their students to 
meet the demands of industry and a modernizing economy.  End 
Summary. 
 
WEAK INFRASTRUCTURE HINDERING DEVELOPMENT 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
----------- 
 
2. (SBU) The Ambassador, accompanied by Conoff and Pol/Econ 
specialist, traveled to Can Tho and An Giang provinces December 12- 
14.  In meetings with Can Tho and An Giang People\'s Committees, 
the Ambassador discussed growing competition for investment among 
provinces as Vietnam moves into the global economy.  He noted the 
comparative advantage of the delta in agriculture and aquaculture, 
but stressed the need for improved infrastructure.  Local 
officials, however, seemed satisfied with a steady approach to 
modernization controlled from Hanoi. 
 
3. (SBU) The Vice-Chairman of the Can Tho People\'s Committee, Mr. 
Pham Phuoc Nhu, noted that GDP growth in the province this year 
reached 15 percent, its highest level ever.  He recognized that 
lack of infrastructure was the main obstacle to continued growth. 
He agreed that the main North-South highway in the region is 
inadequate to support industrial development, and confirmed that 
commercial operations at Can Tho airport remain suspended.  There 
are only two modest U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) projects 
in the region: a feed mill in Can Tho City operated by Cargill and 
the Mien Tay Plastic Company.  Moreover, there have been no new 
U.S. FDI projects since 2002.  The Can Tho Bridge, financed with 
Japanese ODA, is not expected to be completed until 2008.  The 
airport is currently scheduled to reopen (for the first time since 
1975) in 2007 for domestic flights.  A new, six-lane national 
highway has been discussed, but is not yet in the planning stages. 
The Ambassador noted that if the delta region is to keep pace with 
the industrial centers of Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City, 
these projects must be pursued more aggressively. In response, 
however, Nhu would only affirm that \"the [modernization] targets 
set by Hanoi are correct, because living conditions are improving 
steadily.\" 
 
4. (SBU) The Director of the Can Tho International Agriculture 
Fair, Mr. Nguyen Thanh Son, recognized the obstacles presented by 
the region\'s weak transportation systems, but also focused on the 
need to attract advanced technology to increase agricultural 
output.  Son expressed a strong desire to seek out U.S. companies 
that could provide such expertise, especially for the region\'s 
rapidly expanding aquaculture industry.  He hopes that the seven 
years of cooperation with USDA/FAS at the Fair could be a 
springboard for such cooperation.  He said that he would like to 
enlist the help of the Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City in 
seeking out those companies most suited to providing these 
technologies.  The Ambassador encouraged Son to take a more 
proactive approach, suggesting that he seek the assistance sooner 
rather than later. 
 
5. (SBU) In discussions with Mr. Nguyen Hoang Viet, the Chairman 
of the An Giang People\'s Committee, the Ambassador noted 
bureaucratic obstacles to growth including difficulties in 
obtaining required permits, corruption, and intellectual property 
rights (IPR) protection.  He said that the lack of a \"one-stop 
shopping\" approach made the province less attractive to investors. 
The complex procedures for obtaining government approvals slow the 
pace of investment, and foster corruption at every phase of the 
process.  A single department with responsibility for assisting 
foreign companies to invest in the province would help.  Finally, 
IPR must be protected, the Ambassador emphasized.  He said that 
Vietnam\'s poor record in safeguarding IPR has had a direct, 
negative impact on foreign investment.  If An Giang Province hopes 
to attract U.S. companies to provide advanced technologies, it 
must find strategies to ensure that those technologies are 
protected.  Although he agreed that IPR is a fundamental issue 
with regard to attracting investment, Viet outlined no specific 
measures that the provincial government was taking to combat this 
problem. 
 
MAXIMIZING THE POTENTIAL OF HUMAN CAPITAL 
--------------------------------------------- --------------------- 
------- 
 
6. (U) The Ambassador met separately with Can Tho University (CTU) 
Vice-Rector Dr. Nguyen Anh Tuan and Dr. Vo Tong Xuan, Rector of An 
Giang University (AGU).  Both expressed their commitment to 
building strong ties with U.S. institutions.  The educational 
infrastructure in the delta is inadequate to meet demand.  Can Tho 
had the only university in the delta until 2002, when An Giang was 
converted from a teaching college to a university.  CTU has 34,000 
students and AGU 7,000.  However, both institutions accept only 
one in twelve applicants.  While this ensures the quality of the 
students, Dr. Tuan and Dr. Xuan recognized the need to increase 
enrollment to keep pace with the economic growth. 
7. (U) To meet demand, CTU enrolls 17,000 of its students at the 
main campus in Can Tho City, while the remaining 17,000 attend 
\"satellite\" campuses around the region.  Dr. Tuan stated that the 
long-term goal was to turn these satellites into semi-autonomous 
community colleges as in the United States.   CTU is also 
assisting An Giang University, and is increasing its number of 
graduate students to train new faculties for the region.  CTU is 
working with the Japanese, Dutch and Belgians to upgrade computer 
systems, but has yet to exploit CD-ROM and digital video 
conferencing to broaden its reach. 
 
8. (SBU) All agreed that exchange programs, particularly with the 
United States, had been helpful.  Dr. Tuan expressed frustration 
that most Fulbright and Vietnam Educational Foundation grant 
recipients come from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.  He asked that a 
quota be set aside for the Delta. 
 
BORDER SECURITY CONCERNS 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
9. (SBU) Provincial officials and border security forces in An 
Giang drew attention to efforts to strengthen controls along the 
border with Cambodia.  The Ambassador stressed the need for 
stepped-up action on the provincial level in the fight against 
HIV/AIDS.   People\'s Committee Vice-Chairman Nhu in Can Tho and 
Chairman Viet in An Giang expressed appreciation for Emergency 
Plan support for Vietnam.  The People\'s Committees of Can Tho and 
An Giang spoke of \"programs\" and \"workshops\" to address prevention 
and long-term care, but provided no specifics on these programs. 
The Ambassador stressed the need for direct involvement by senior 
provincial officials and action on the ground to implement Hanoi\'s 
policies on issues like the rights of those afflicted and the need 
to combat public misperceptions. 
 
10. (SBU) The Ambassador visited the border crossing at Xuan To in 
An Giang Province and discussed trafficking in persons and 
narcotics with representatives from the Customs Department, the 
Border Defense Army and the District People\'s Committee.  Tinh 
Bien Customs Department officials said that narcotics and 
trafficking were top priorities but that they understood the need 
to stop counterfeit goods as well. An Giang\'s border with Cambodia 
stretches for 100km, with five official crossing points manned by 
200 customs officers. The border army makes regular patrols 
between points.  For much of the year the region is flooded and 
passable only by boat.  Most of the illicit trade crosses from 
Cambodia during these months.  UNODC sponsors six Joint Task 
Forces in key border provinces to assist GVN with trafficking 
issues, but all task force officers in An Giang are seconded on a 
part-time basis from their agencies.  Officials also complained 
about lack of boats, vehicles and adequate training.  The 
Ambassador stressed the need for greater cooperation between USG 
and GVN on all law enforcement issues, especially counter- 
narcotics. 
 
11. (SBU) The Ambassador visited an anti-trafficking pilot project 
in Nui Sam Ward of An Giang Province.  Run by the Women\'s Union of 
the District People\'s Committee and supported by the Asia 
Foundation, the project\'s 21-member team of volunteers provides 
workshops and community outreach aimed at prevention and 
reintegration of trafficking victims into their communities. 
Since early 2003, they have held 47 meetings, reaching 2,578 
participants.  The at-risk target population consists of females 
aged 13 to 30 with minimal education.  Project leaders claimed 
that there have been no new cases of trafficking since the project 
began.  Local officials have only recently begun to focus on 
trafficking and little data exists on trends, making it difficult 
to measure success.   The program also assists victims through 
micro-lending projects (supported by the International 
Organization for Migration) and training (run through the 
province\'s Department of Labor).   Despite the apparent success of 
the project in Nui Sam, there are as yet no plans to expand the 
project to other wards.  The Ambassador suggested a more proactive 
approach in assisting neighboring wards to establish similar 
programs. 
 
12. (SBU) Comment: Both Can Tho and An Giang are making strides in 
the right direction economically.  Continuation of rapid growth 
requires improvement in governance, rapid modernization of the 
transportation infrastructure, and increased access to higher 
education.  Better control of the border will help address 
trafficking, drug smuggling and the attendant spread of HIV/AIDS. 
End comment.

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR VISITS UBCV LEADER IN HCMC 
 
REF:  A) 04 HCMC 1503; B) 04 HCMC 1481 
 
1. (SBU) During a December 5 visit with the Ambassador and Consul 
General, Thich Quang Do, Secretary General of the banned Unified 
Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), thanked the Ambassador for his 
continued interest in the UBCV and welcomed international pressure 
calling for greater religious freedom and human rights in Vietnam. 
He praised the USG designation of Vietnam as a Country of 
Particular Concern (CPC) and said it would be a \"strong pressure 
on Vietnam\'s leaders\" to change their attitude toward religious 
freedom, although he acknowledged that he has not seen any 
improvement in the GVN\'s attitude toward the UBCV since the CPC 
designation. 
 
2. (SBU) Echoing his comments to DRL DAS Dugan in December (Ref 
B), Thich Quang Do railed against the \"dictatorship of communist 
leaders in Vietnam\" and vowed to continue his campaign for a multi- 
party, democratic system of government.  He rejected the idea of a 
union with the GVN-recognized Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (VBS), which 
he said is a tool of the GVN.  His goal is a UBCV that operates 
freely and independently of the GVN and is able to use its 
influence to promote political change in Vietnam.  He admitted 
that UBCV membership in Vietnam has dwindled over the past 30 
years to no more than 70 monks.  Nonetheless, he claimed that 
\"brave, courageous\" monks have been selected to replace UBCV 
leader Thich Huyen Quang (age 87) and himself (age 77), when 
necessary. 
 
3. (SBU) Thich Quang Do was still unclear of his exact legal 
status or any charges against him, although he remains under 
unofficial \"pagoda arrest.\"  After his thwarted attempt to visit 
UBCV Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang in November (reftels), he 
attempted to visit a colleague in another district of HCMC and was 
again stopped by police.  The police have summoned him for 
questioning several times over the past month, but he has refused 
to go or to allow the police into his pagoda to speak to him. 
 
4. (SBU) Thich Quang Do said he will attempt to visit Thich Huyen 
Quang in Binh Dinh Province during the Tet New Year in February. 
He asked the Ambassador to express his support for such a visit to 
the GVN, although he noted that \"the government is very determined 
to separate us\" and that he doubts that the authorities will allow 
the visit.  (Note: We informed the authorities that the Ambassador 
would meet with Thich Quang Do at his pagoda and met with no 
interference.  End Note.)  Thich Quang Do predicted that the 
police would come again shortly after the Ambassador\'s visit, as 
they had after DAS Dugan met with him, but he has no intention of 
cooperating. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: Thich Quang Do\'s statements reiterated his 
position of pressing greater religious freedom as a mechanism for 
advancing political change.  He has no desire to cooperate with 
the communist authorities in any way or to have the UBCV 
officially recognized by the GVN, unless this can be achieved 
without conditions.  Given his strong anti-communist stance and 
his open advocacy for rapid political change, the GVN hardline 
attitude toward him is no surprise.  We will continue to monitor 
the GVN\'s treatment of Thich Quang Do and any attempts to prevent 
him from visiting Thich Huyen Quang during Tet.  The Ambassador 
will be expressing his support for the visit to senior GVN 
officials next week.  End Comment.
