THIS TELEGRAM FULFILLS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 
POST REPORTING PLAN 
 
1.  (CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT).

2.  SUMMARY:  BANGLADESH HOPES THAT RAJIV GANDHI WOULD 
BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS 
HAVE FADED OVER THE PAST YEAR.  BANGLADESH AND INDIA 
HAVE MADE LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE PROGRESS ON LONG-STANDING 
PROBLEMS UNDER RAJIV; MANY AGAIN APPEAR INTRACTABLE 
AND NEW PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN.  THE UPSURGE IN VIOLENCE 
IN THE CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS HAS BEEN A PARTICULARLY 
IMPORTANT SETBACK.  WHILE THE USG HAS NO INTEREST IN 
GETTING INVOLVED IN BANGLADESH-INDIA PROBLEMS AND SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO AVOID ANY POSITIONS ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES, 
THE IMPROVEMENT OF BILATERAL RELATIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL 
IN PROMOTING REGIONAL STABILITY, A LONG-TIME U.S. 
OBJECTIVE IN SOUTH ASIA.  END SUMMARY.

BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT PERCEPTIONS 
--------------------------------- 
 
3.  BANGLADESHI HOPES THAT INDIAN PRIME MINISTER RAJIV 
GANDHI WOULD BE A POWERFUL FORCE IN IMPROVING RELATIONS 
HAVE FADED OVER THE PAST YEAR. THERE IS A GROWING REAL- 
IZATION THAT RAJIV FACES A MYRIAD OF DOMESTIC PROBLEMS, 
AS WELL AS DIFFICULT RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND SRI 
LANKA, AND CAN DEVOTE LITTLE TIME TO BANGLADESH.  IN 
THE BDG VIEW, WHAT GOODWILL OR NOBLE INTENTIONS HE MAY 
HAVE TOWARDS IMPROVING RELATIONS HAVE BEEN STYMIED AT 
EVERY TURN BY THE INDIAN BUREAUCRACY AND BY LESS HELP- 
FUL POLITICAL FIGURES.  (WATER RESOURCES MINISTER 
B. SHANKARANAND REMAINS A FAVORITE BDG BLACK HAT.) 
MANY BANGLADESHIS CONSIDER THAT THE INDIAN FOREIGN 
POLICY BUREAUCRACY IS DOMINATED BY PEOPLE WITH AN 
IMPERIOUS  ATTITUDE TOWARDS INDIA\'S NEIGHBORS.  THEY 
BELIEVE THAT WHILE ERSHAD AND RAJIV MAY PERSONALLY GET 
ALONG WELL AND WANT TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING ISSUES, 
INDIAN BUREAUCRATS ARE DETERMINED TO KEEP UP THE 
PRESSURE ON BANGLADESH.  REPORTS THAT RAJIV CANNOT 
MANAGE THESE BUREAUCRATS, AND GROWING PERCEPTIONS 
THAT THE PRIME MINISTER\'S POLITICAL POSITION IS 
WEAKENING, ONLY COMPOUND THE FEAR AMONG MANY IN 
BANGLADESH THAT RAJIV IS POWERLESS TO EFFECT CHANGE. 
 
-- 
4.  PRESIDENT ERSHAD\'S STATE VISIT TO DELHI JULY 14-16, 
1986  LED TO AN OPEN AND POSITIVE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS, 
BUT MANY IN BANGLADESH VIEWED IT AS A TEST OF RAJIV\'S 
ABILITY TO HASTEN THE RESOLUTION OF BILATERAL PROBLEMS, 
IN PARTICULAR THE TIN BIGHA LAND CASE AND THE EASTERN 
WATERS PROBLEM.  BY JANUARY 1987, OPTIMISM THAT PROGRESS 
COULD BE MADE ON BILATERAL ISSUES HAD FADED.  FOREIGN 
MINISTER TIWARI FACED A LITANY OF BDG GRIEVANCES DURING 
HIS JANUARY 6-8 VISIT TO DHAKA.  BANGLADESH AND INDIA 
HAVE MADE LITTLE PROGRESS ON LONG-STANDING PROBLEMS 
UNDER RAJIV; MANY AGAIN APPEAR INTRACTABLE AND NEW 
PROBLEMS HAVE ARISEN.  FOREIGN MINISTER CHOUDHURY, IN A 
MARCH 25 SPEECH BEFORE PARLIAMENT, DEVOTED NEARLY HALF 
OF HIS HOUR-LONG ADDRESS TO INDO-BANGLADESHI BILATERAL 
PROBLEMS.  CHOUDHURY\'S FOCUS ON INDIA REFLECTED THE BDG 
INTEREST IN DEMONSTRATING THE CORRECTNESS OF A STRONG 
STAND ON BILATERAL ISSUES AT A TIME WHEN THE BDG IS 
BECOMING INCREASINGLY EMBARRASSED AND FRUSTRATED BY 
DEVELOPMENTS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, SUCH AS THE 
CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS PROBLEM. 
 
-- 
BILATERAL ISSUES 
---------------- 
 
5.  THE FOLLOWING BILATERAL ISSUES, THE MAJORITY OF 
WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED EXTENSIVELY FROM DHAKA, FOR 
THE MOST PART ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAVE BESET 
BANGLADESH-INDIA RELATIONS OVER THE PAST YEAR AND 
DIMINISHED HOPES THAT RELATIONS WOULD IMPROVE UNDER 
RAJIV.  LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN RECORDED ON LONG- 
STANDING POLITICAL ISSUES.  AND IN ONE INSTANCE, THE 
CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS, THE UPSURGE OF VIOLENCE THERE 
HAS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT SETBACK. 
 
-- 
POLITICAL ISSUES 
---------------- 
 
6.  EASTERN WATERS.   ALTHOUGH THE BDG WAS PLEASED 
THAT INDIA AGREED TO A TRILATERAL APPROACH TO AUGMENTING 
THE FLOW OF GANGES RIVER WATER TO BANGLADESH, SENIOR BDG 
OFFICIALS RECOGNIZED THAT ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE 
EASTERN WATERS ISSUE BY BUILDING A SERIES OF DAMS IN 
NEPAL WAS CERTAIN TO BE FRUITLESS.  IN A \"SHARING\" 
APPROACH, BANGLADESH IS NOW ASKING INDIA FOR A GUARAN- 
TEED FLOW OF 25,000 CUSECS FROM THE GANGES, LESS THAN 
THAT PROVIDED IN THE SHORT-TERM AGREEMENT NOW IN FORCE, 
BUT ABOUT EQUAL TO WHAT BANGLADESH RECEIVES IN THE 
LOWEST WATER MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN-SHARING 
PROVISIONS OF THAT AGREEMENT.  BANGLADESH ALSO WANTS A 
GUARANTEED 75 PERCENT OF THE FLOW OF THE BRAHMAPUTRA 
AND 50 PERCENT OF THE FLOW OF THE OTHER BORDER RIVERS. 
IF INDIA AGREES TO GUARANTEE THESE QUANTITIES OF WATER 
FOR BANGLADESH, THE BANGLADESH IRRIGATION MINISTER 
CLAIMS THE BDG WILL DROP ITS PROPOSAL FOR STORAGE DAMS 
IN NEPAL AND INDIA COULD THEN ABANDON THE IDEA OF A 
LINK CANAL FROM THE BRAHMAPUTRA TO THE GANGES ACROSS 
BANGLADESH.  THE BDG BELIEVES THAT SUCH A SHARING 
AGREEMENT WITH INDIA IS POSSIBLE, BUT THE INDIAN 
BUREAUCRACY REMAINS OBSTRUCTIVE.  IN BANGLADESH 
POLITICS, THE GREAT DANGER IS BEING SEEN AS \"PRO- 
INDIAN.\"  THUS, PRESIDENT ERSHAD IS CAUTIOUS IN DEALING 
WITH THE EASTERN WATERS ISSUE. 
 
-- 
7.  CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS.   BDG OFFICIALS CLAIM 
THAT INDIA HAS PROVIDED ARMS, REFUGE, AND FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT TO THE SHANTI BAHINI INSURGENTS IN THE 
CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS, THUS FUELING AN INSURGENCY 
WHICH HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY VIOLENT.  INDIA, ON 
THE OTHER HAND, CLAIMS THAT BANGLADESH HAS GIVEN 
REFUGE TO MEMBERS OF AN INDIAN INSURGENT GROUP, THE 
TRIPURA NATIONAL VOLUNTEERS.  INDIA AND BANGLADESH 
RECENTLY REACHED AN AGREEMENT THAT BANGLADESH WOULD 
REPATRIATE OVER 24,000 CHAKMA REFUGEES WHO FLED FROM 
BANGLADESH IN THE WAKE OF SHANTI BAHINI VIOLENCE. 
THE REPATRIATION PROGRAM WAS TO HAVE BEGUN ON 
JANUARY 15, BUT SHANTI BAHINI ATTACKS STOPPED THE 
REPATRIATION BEFORE IT BEGAN.  INDIA AND BANGLADESH 
CONTINUE TO EXCHANGE CHARGES ABOUT WHICH COUNTRY IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.  FOREIGN MINISTER 
(#)UMAYUN RASHID CHOUDHURY IN A MARCH 25 SPEECH BEFORE 
PARLIAMENT SAID THAT BANGLADESH IS READY TO TAKE 
BACK THE REFUGEES, BUT THAT THE GOI HAS NOT RESPONDED 
TO BANGLADESH\'S PROPOSAL TO BEGIN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN 
HOME SECRETARIES ON THE REPATRIATION PROGRAM.  THE 
CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS ISSUE IS A PARTICULARLY SENSI- 
TIVE ONE FOR BANGLADESH IN VIEW OF A SEPTEMBER 1986 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL REPORT CHARGING WIDESPREAD 
HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN THE HILL TRACTS BY BANGLADESH 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. 
 
-- 
8.  TIN BIGHA.   THE CALCUTTA HIGH COURT RULED IN 
SEPTEMBER 1986 THAT THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION MUST 
BE AMENDED BEFORE INDIA COULD LEASE THE TIN BIGHA 
CORRIDOR  TO BANGLADESH IN PERPETUITY.  THE BANGLA- 
DESHIS HAD ASKED FOR THE TERRITORY TO BE TURNED OVER 
TO THEM DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1987.  RAJIV 
PROMISED TO DELIVER QUICKLY ON TIN BIGHA, AND HAS 
THUS FAR FAILED TO KEEP THAT PROMISE.  THE BDG 
CLAIMS THE ISSUE IS A TEST OF INDIA\'S SINCERITY IN 
IMPROVING RELATIONS OVERALL, BUT IN FACT APPEARS 
FAIRLY RELAXED ABOUT INDIA\'S SLOWNESS. 
 
-- 
9.  MARITIME BOUNDARY.   FOREIGN MINISTER CHOUDHURY 
IN HIS MARCH 25 SPEECH HAS SAID THAT, ACCORDING TO ALL 
AVAILABLE INFORMATION, SOUTH TALPATTY ISLAND BELONGS 
TO BANGLADESH.  INDIA, HOWEVER, HAS STAKED A CLAIM TO 
THE ISLAND.  THE FOREIGN MINISTER NOTED THAT THE TWO 
GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED TO DETERMINE OWNERSHIP THROUGH 
A JOINT SURVEY. 
 
-- 
10.  IN THE MIDST OF THESE CONTENTIOUS BILATERAL 
ISSUES, SOME BRIGHT SPOTS EXIST.  FOR EXAMPLE: 
 
-- 
11.  TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE.   BANGLADESH\'S 
ELECTION PERIOD AND TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN RULE 
IN 1986  PASSED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO BANGLADESH-INDIA 
RELATIONS.  INDO-BANGLADESHI RELATIONS WERE NEVER 
A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE PARLIAMENTARY OR 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.  WHILE THE INDIANS 
MAY HAVE WANTED THE AWAMI LEAGUE TO EMERGE IN A 
STRONG POSITION IN PARLIAMENT, NEITHER EVIDENCE NOR 
ACCUSATIONS OF INDIAN INVOLVEMENT EXIST.  SIMILARLY, 
THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD OF THE LIFTING OF MARTIAL LAW 
AND THE ELECTION OF PRESIDENT ERSHAD, THERE WERE NO 
SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS OF EITHER INDIAN INTERVENTION IN 
BANGLADESH\'S AFFAIRS OR PRO-INDIAN SENTIMENT ON THE 
PART OF BDG OFFICIALS.  AWAMI LEAGUE LEADER SHEIKH 
HASINA\'S MEETING WITH RAJIV GANDHI IN NOVEMBER 1986 
CREATED A BRIEF FLURRY IN DHAKA, BUT APPEARS TO HAVE 
HAD NO LASTING IMPACT ON THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL SCENE. 
 
-- 
12.  SAARC.   ALTHOUGH THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION 
FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION (SAARC) HAS YET TO HAVE A 
SUBSTANTIVE ROLE IN THE REGION, INDIA HAS COOPERATED 
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS TO ESTABLISH SAARC.  RAJIV\'S 
SUPPORT FOR ERSHAD\'S PERSONAL ROLE IN SAARC\'S ESTAB- 
LISHMENT, AND THEIR USE OF THE FORUM SAARC PROVIDED 
FOR THE DISCUSSION OF BILATERAL ISSUES, HAVE BEEN 
POSITIVE FACTORS IN BANGLADESH-INDIA RELATIONS DURING 
THE PAST YEAR. 
 
-- 
13.  ASSAM BORDER.   THE ASSAM INFILTRATION ISSUE 
APPEARS TO HAVE SUBSIDED, AND THE INDIANS SEEM TO 
HAVE DROPPED PLANS TO CONSTRUCT THEIR PROVOCATIVE 
BORDER FENCE AS FAR AS WE ARE AWARE HERE.  BUT LIKE 
MANY  OTHER PROBLEMS IN INDO-BANGLADESH RELATIONS, 
THE ISSUE  OF ALLEGED BANGLADESHI INFILTRATION INTO 
LESS HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS OF NORTHEASTERN INDIA 
REMAINS ONE WHICH CAN SUDDENLY BE BROUGHT AGAIN TO 
PROMINENCE EITHER BY A STRAY EVENT OR AS A CONSEQUENCE 
OF PERCEIVED DOMESTIC POLITICAL NEEDS IN THE TWO 
COUNTRIES. 
 
-- 
ECONOMIC ISSUES 
--------------- 
 
14.  TRADE.   BANGLADESH\'S FRUSTRATIONS OVER THE 
GROWING TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA AND INDIA\'S 
NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO THE BDG REQUEST FOR IMPORT 
FINANCING HAVE HEIGHTENED BANGLADESH\'S DISAPPOINT- 
MENT AND PUBLIC SKEPTICISM ABOUT INDIAN INTENTIONS. 
BANGLADESH-INDIA ECONOMIC TALKS ON DECEMBER 1-2, 
1986 FOCUSED PRINCIPALLY ON THE TRADE IMBALANCE, 
WHICH GREW TO 57 MILLION DOLLARS IN FY 1985.  IN 
THAT YEAR, BANGLADESHI EXPORTS WERE UNUSUALLY STRONG, 
BUT SUCCEEDED IN COVERING ONLY 39 PERCENT OF THE 
IMPORTS FROM INDIA.  BANGLADESHIS VOICED DISAPPOINT- 
MENT AT THE LACK OF CONCRETE DECISIONS COMING FROM 
THE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS.  PROTESTS SURROUNDING THE 
OPENING OF AN INDIAN TRADE EXHIBITION IN DHAKA IN 
NOVEMBER 1986 REFLECTED THE UNDERLYING TENSION IN 
BANGLADESH\'S COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH INDIA AND THE 
SENSITIVITY OF THIS ISSUE IN SOME POLITICAL QUARTERS. 
 
-- 
15.  ACCESS.   INDIAN REQUESTS FOR ACCESS THROUGH 
BANGLADESH TERRITORY HAVE MET WITH RESISTANCE FROM 
BDG AUTHORITIES.  ACCESS TO ASSAM VIA INLAND WATER 
TRANSPORT, RAIL, AND ROAD, AND ACCESS TO THE SEA 
(THROUGH CHITTAGONG) FOR MIZORAM HAVE BECOME CONTEN- 
TIOUS BILATERAL ISSUES.  ACCORDING TO THE MFA\'S 
DIRECTOR GENERAL FOR SOUTH ASIAN AFFAIRS, THE 
BANGLADESH MILITARY FEAR BOTH THE SECURITY ASPECTS 
OF SUCH ACCESS AND THE \"SMUGGLING\" WHICH WOULD TAKE 
PLACE.  BANGLADESH BELIEVES THERE WOULD BE A TREMEN- 
DOUS, UNCONTROLLABLE LEAKAGE OF INDIAN GOODS INTO 
BANGLADESH FROM RAILWAY AND ROAD TRANSIT.  THE 
DIRECTOR ADDED THAT INDIA HAS THREATENED TO BUILD A 
ROAD THROUGH THE NARROW NECK OF LAND WHICH CONNECTS 
ASSAM TO THE REST OF INDIA.  THAT WOULD \"CUT BANGLADESH 
OUT\" OF THE \"BENEFITS\" (TAXING POWER, FOR EXAMPLE) 
WHICH WOULD COME FROM ALLOWING INDIA ACCESS TO ASSAM 
THROUGH BANGLADESH TERRITORY.  (THE DIRECTOR, HOWEVER, 
THINKS THE THREAT IS A BLUFF; THE ROAD WILL NEVER BE 
BUILT BECAUSE IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE.) MORE POSITIVELY, 
INDIA AND BANGLADESH AGREED TO IMPROVE LAND LINE 
TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATIONS TO PERMIT AUTOMATIC DIRECT 
DIALING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.  THE SERVICE TOOK 
EFFECT ON MARCH 26. 
 
-- 
16.  SMUGGLING.  LONG A PROBLEM BETWEEN INDIA AND 
BANGLADESH, SMUGGLING APPEARS TO HAVE INCREASED 
DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST YEAR, ALTHOUGH NO 
RELIABLE STATISTICS ARE AVAILABLE.  THIS FURTHER 
STRAINS ECONOMIC RELATIONS.  THE BDG HAS FORMED AN 
ANTI-SMUGGLING COMMITTEE, IN WHICH ERSHAD TAKES 
A PERSONAL INTEREST, TO CRACK DOWN ON ALL SMUGGLING, 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE POROUS INDIA-BANGLADESH BORDER. 
ON MARCH 23, 1987  THE PARLIAMENT PASSED AN AMENDMENT 
TO THE SPECIAL POWERS ACT ALLOWING THE DEATH PENALTY 
TO BE IMPOSED AGAINST SMUGGLERS.  THE PRESIDENT IS 
LIKELY TO SIGN THE LEGISLATION LATER THIS YEAR.  IN 
ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL SMUGGLED ITEMS SUCH AS COTTON 
TEXTILES, BANGLADESH OFFICIALS BELIEVE HEROIN AND OTHER 
ILLEGAL DRUGS ARE FINDING THEIR WAY INTO BANGLADESH 
FROM INDIA. 
 
-- 
IMPLICATIONS FOR U.S. POLICY 
---------------------------- 
 
17.  THE USG HAS NO INTEREST IN GETTING INVOLVED IN 
BANGLADESH-INDIA PROBLEMS AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
AVOID ANY POSITIONS ON CONTENTIOUS ISSUES.  AT THE 
SAME TIME, WE RECOGNIZE THAT IMPROVEMENT OF BANGLADESH- 
INDIA RELATIONS WILL PROMOTE REGIONAL STABILITY, A 
LONG-TIME U.S. OBJECTIVE IN SOUTH ASIA.  OUR ROLE MUST 
BE TO ENCOURAGE EACH SIDE, IN A LOW-KEY WAY, TO 
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OTHER TO RESOLVE THE BILATERAL 
PROBLEMS.  AND ALL MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO QUICK, 
EASY SOLUTION TO ANY OF THEM.

E.O. 12356: N/A 
TAGS: PTER, BG 
SUBJECT:  BANGLADESH: 1987 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 42378 
 
1.  BANGLADESH. 
 
2.  RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PALESTINE LIBERATION 
ORGANIZATION: 
 
THE GOVERNMENT OF BANGLADESH OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZES THE 
PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, WHICH MAINTAINS A 
DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN DHAKA.  FOUR PLO REPRESENTATIVES 
APPEAR ON THE DIPLOMATIC LIST, AND APPARENTLY HAVE 
FULL DIPLOMATIC PRIVILEGES, INCLUDING IMMUNITY AND USE 
OF THE POUCH.  AN ASSOCIATION OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY 
PALESTINIAN STUDENTS IS ACTIVE IN THE PORT CITY OF 
CHITTAGONG.  THE ASSOCIATION IS REPORTEDLY AFFILIATED 
WITH THE AL-FATAH GROUP OF THE PLO.  THE STUDENTS HAVE 
DEMONSTRATED AGAINST U.S. POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
AND HAVE BURNED EFFIGIES OF PRESIDENT REAGAN AND ISRAELI 
LEADERS. 
 
 
DOMESTIC INSURGENCY - THE SHANTI BAHINI: 
 
A SIMMERING INSURGENT MOVEMENT IS ACTIVE IN THE 
CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS REGION WHERE SOME 600,000 TRIBAL 
PEOPLE LIVE.  THE MOVEMENT REFLECTS CONCERN THAT THEIR 
TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE IN THE HILL AREAS WAS BEING 
UNDERMINED BY SETTLERS WHO MOVED THERE FROM THE 
OVERPOPULATED PLAINS.  THE INSURGENTS ARE DEMANDING 
AUTONOMY FOR THE CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS WITHIN THE 
BANGLADESH STATE.  ARMED CLASHES HAVE OCCURRED BETWEEN 
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND A GROUP OF TRIBAL INSURGENTS KNOWN 
AS THE SHANTI BAHINI (\"PEACE FORCE\").  THE SHANTI 
BAHINI HAVE CONDUCTED HIT-AND-RUN RAIDS AGAINST MILITARY 
PERSONNEL AND BENGALI SETTLEMENTS.  OFFICIAL SOURCES 
CLAIM THAT IN 1987, 122 PERSONS WERE KILLED, 68 PERSONS 
WERE INJURED, AND 21 PERSONS WERE KIDNAPPED IN SHANTI 
BAHINI VIOLENCE. 
 
 
3.  MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN: 
 
THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT HAS NO  SPECIFIC RESPONSE 
CAPABILITY BEYOND EXISTING POLICE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE 
PROCEDURES.  THE IMMIGRATION SERVICE IS AN ADJUNCT 
OF SPECIAL BRANCH, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERNAL 
SECURITY MATTERS.  THERE ARE NO DESIGNATED ANTI- 
TERRORISM POLICE.  ANY ARMED RESPONSE TO A TERRORISM 
SITUATION WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY BE HANDLED BY THE 
MILITARY, WHICH HAS NO KNOWN ANTI-TERRORIST CAPABILITY. 
 
 
4.  RESPONSE OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM: 
 
POST IS UNAWARE OF ANY ACTION TAKEN BY THE BANGLADESH 
JUDICIAL SYSTEM WITH RESPECT OF MATTERS RELATING TO 
TERRORISM AFFECTING AMERICAN CITIZENS OR FACILITIES. 
 
 
5.  POSITION IN INTERNATIONAL FORA: 
 
THE BANGLADESH GOVERNMENT HAS CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED 
MEASURES TO PREVENT INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM.  IN 
INTERNATIONAL FORA, BANGLADESH HAS CONDEMNED AS CRIMINAL 
ALL ACTS, METHODS, AND PRACTICES OF TERRORISM WHEREVER 
AND BY WHOMEVER COMMITTED.  TO POST\'S KNOWLEDGE, THE 
BDG HAS ENDORSED INTERNATIONAL ANTI-TERRORISM 
CONVENTIONS.  BANGLADESH HAS SUPPORTED EFFORTS WITHIN 
THE SOUTH ASIAN ASSOCIATION FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION 
(SAARC) TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  BANGLADESH\'S UNGA VOTING RECORD ON TERRORISM 
IS UNAVAILABLE AT POST.

E.O. 12356:  DECL: OADR 
TAGS:  PREL, PGOV, BG 
SUBJECT:  MEETING WITH AWAMI LEAGUE LEADER SHEIKH HASINA 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY:  I MET WITH THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION, 
SHEIKH HASINA, IN AN EXTRAORDINARILY LONG, TWO-HOUR 
MEETING ON JULY 10.  CLEARLY SHEIKH HASINA WANTS TO 
IMPROVE HER IMAGE, AND THAT OF THE AWAMI LEAGUE, WITH 
AMERICANS, AND THE USG.  SHE RAISED THE ISSUE OF 
WHETHER THE U.S. OPPOSED HER AND/OR HER PARTY.  SHE 
ALSO SAID THAT THE BNP GOVERNMENT WAS BECOMING 
AUTHORITARIAN AND, ITSELF, ERODING INFANT DEMOCRATIC 
STRUCTURES.  SHE SAID THAT ONLY THE BNP GOVERNMENT 
COULD SOLVE THE UNIVERSITY SITUATION.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  SHEIKH HASINA APPEARED RELAXED AND MUCH MORE 
FRIENDLY THAN USUAL IN OUR TWO-HOUR MEETING ON JULY 10. 
IT IS CLEAR SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE 
USG (WE HAVE HEARD THIS FROM ANOTHER SOURCE ALSO). 
IN PREVIOUS MEETINGS, SHE HAS APPEARED TENSE AND 
SOMEWHAT ON GUARD; IN THIS MEETING, SHE SEEMED MUCH 
MORE OPEN AND WILLING TO DISCUSS A RANGE OF ISSUES 
WITHOUT THE USUAL SLOGANEERING.  HER RELAXED DEMEANOR 
WAS ALSO EVIDENCED BY HER WILLINGNESS TO TALK ABOUT 
HER FAMILY AND OTHER PERSONAL ITEMS. 
 
4.  SHE BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY SAYING THAT SHE HAD 
JUST COME FROM A MEETING WITH UPAZILLA CHAIRMEN WHO 
WERE EXTREMELY UPSET BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING 
DISMISSED BY THE BNP GOVERNMENT.  AS SHE POINTED OUT, 
THESE CHAIRMEN WERE ELECTED IN THE UPAZILLA ELECTIONS 
OF MARCH 1990, AND THEIR TERMS ARE NOT YET COMPLETED. 
SHEIKH HASINA RAISED THE QUESTION OF HOW ELECTED 
UPAZILLA CHAIRMEN COULD BE DISMISSED BY THE MAJORITY 
PARTY IN THE PARLIAMENT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. 
 
5.  THIS LED HER TO EXPAND ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GROWING 
AUTHORITARIANISM OF THE BNP.  SHEIKH HASINA SAID THAT, 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE BNP WAS HARASSING AWAMI LEAGUE 
MEMBERS AND WORKERS IN VILLAGES AND UPAZILLAS THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY.  SHE MENTIONED THE BNP-PROPOSED CONSITU- 
TIONAL AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD RESTORE PARLIAMENTARY 
GOVERNMENT IN BANGLADESH, AS EVIDENCE OF THE GROWING 
AUTHORITARIAN CAST OF THE BNP GOVERNMENT.  SHE SAID 
THAT THE BNP PROPOSAL CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS \"BOUND\" TO DISSOLVE THE PARLIAMENT IF 
THE PRIME MINISTER SO REQUESTS.  THE AWAMI LEAGUE, 
SHEIKH HASINA SAID, IS OPPOSED TO THIS SHACKLING 
OF PRESIDENTIAL DISCRETION ON THE MATTER OF DISSOLUTION 
OF THE PARLIAMENT.  SHE MENTIONED ALSO THAT THE AWAMI 
LEAGUE WAS VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THE PROVISION THAT 
WOULD BAR A PARTY MEMBER WHO CROSSED THE FLOOR FROM 
RUNNING FOR REELECTION FOR FIVE YEARS.  SHEIKH 
HASINA POINTED OUT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD END 
UP WITH AUTHORITARIAN POWERS OVER HER PARTY AND OVER 
ANY DISSENTERS IN IT THROUGH SUCH PROVISIONS. 
 
6.  SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO LEAD HER PARTY IN 
RESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION.  SHE POINTED OUT THAT THERE HAD 
BEEN PRESSURE WITHIN THE AWAMI LEAGUE FOR INSISTING 
THAT THE \"INDEMNITY BILL\" BE LINKED TO THE CONSTITU- 
TIONAL AMENDMENT.  (THE INDEMNITY BILL IS A BILL WHICH 
AUTHORIZES THE PROSECUTION OF THE ASSASSINS OF HER 
FATHER, SHEIKH MUJIB.)  SHE RESISTED THESE PRESSURES 
AND INSTEAD DIRECTED THAT THE INDEMNITY BILL BE PUT 
IN AS A SEPARATE BILL, TO BE DEBATED ON ITS OWN MERITS. 
 
7.  I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD NOTED HER RESPONSIBLE 
LEADERSHIP OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, AND PRAISED HER 
FOR KEEPING OPPOSITION TO THE BNP GOVERNMENT WITHIN 
THE CONFINES OF PARLIAMENT.  I INDICATED THAT THE 
ROOTS OF DEMOCRACY MUST SINK DEEP AND TAKE GOOD 
HOLD, AND THAT A RESPONSIBLE OPPOSITION, CONFINING 
ITS OPPOSITION TO LEGITIMATE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES, 
WOULD HAVE GREAT BEARING ON THE ABILITY OF DEMOCRACY 
TO FLOURISH. 
 
8.  I ASKED ABOUT THE STUDENT VIOLENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY. 
I INDICATED THAT IN MY VIEW THIS ISSUE HAD TO BE 
RESOLVED QUICKLY IF IT WAS NOT TO SPREAD AND WORSEN. 
I WENT ON TO SUGGEST THAT ALL PARTIES WOULD HAVE TO 
AGREE TO REFRAIN FROM BACKING THEIR STUDENTS IN THESE 
UNIVERSITIES POWER STRUGGLES, AND INDICATE TO THEIR 
STUDENT FACTIONS THAT THEY WOULD NOT SUPPORT THE 
USE OF ARMS OR VIOLENCE ON THE CAMPUS.  SHEIKH HASINA 
REPLIED THAT IT IS UP TO THE GOVERNMENT TO STOP 
VIOLENCE ON THE CAMPUS.  SHE BLAMED THE PRIME MINISTER 
FOR CONTINUING TO ALLOW STUDENT VIOLENCE TO OCCUR. 
SHE SAID THAT, IF THE GOVERNMENT CRACKED DOWN, THE 
SITUATION COULD BE RECTIFIED IN 30 MINUTES.  THESE 
STUDENTS ONLY HAVE WEAPONS SHE SAID BECAUSE THE 
GOVERNMENT LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SHE WOULD SUPPORT 
THE GOVERNMENT IN A GENERAL AGREEMENT TO BACK AWAY 
FROM STUDENT POLITICIZATION AND ON DISARMING THE CAMPUS. 
WHEN PRESSED, SHE MENTIONED THAT THE MAIN REASON SHE 
WOULD SUPPORT SUCH A RESOLUTION IS BECAUSE ARMING 
THE STUDENTS IS COSTLY.  SHE SAID THE AWAMI LEAGUE 
CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO SUPPLY ITS STUDENTS WITH 
ARMS. 
 
9.  THE CONVERSATION SHIFTED TO U.S. PRESENCE IN 
BANGLADESH, PARTICULARLY AFTER I BROACHED THE SUBJECT 
OF THE RECENT VISIT OF THE PEACE CORPS DIRECTOR, PAUL 
COVERDELL.  I MENTIONED THAT, IN 1978, A PEACE CORPS 
AGREEMENT HAD BEEN SIGNED BUT THAT THE THEN-GOVERNMENT 
OF ZIA RAHMAN HAD NEVER ESTABLISHED A PEACE CORPS 
PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE REACTION OF THE OPPOSITION, 
INCLUDING HER PARTY.  I WENT ON TO DESCRIBE THE PEACE 
CORPS AS A VOLUNTEER, FACE-TO-FACE ORGANIZATION WHICH 
ESSENTIALLY WORKS AT THE MICRO LEVEL, USUALLY UNDER 
THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.  SHEIKH 
HASINA DID NOT RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE POINTS I MADE 
ABOUT THE PEACE CORPS.  INSTEAD SHE ASKED ME WHETHER 
THE U.S. OPPOSES HER AND OR HER PARTY.  SHE SAID THAT 
ONE OF THE CURRENT RUMORS IN BANGLADESH, PARTICULARLY 
AMONG HER OWN PARTY WORKERS, IS THAT THE U.S. IS 
STRONGLY OPPOSED EITHER TO HER OR TO HER PARTY 
COMING TO POWER. 
 
10.  I RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY THAT THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE 
TO THIS RUMOR AND THAT WE DID NOT TAKE SIDES AMONG 
POLITICAL PARTIES IN ANY COUNTRY, AND THAT WE WOULD 
WORK EAGERLY AND POITIVELY WITH ANY GOVERNMENT ELECTED 
BY THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH.  IMENTIONED THAT WE 
DID NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF THE PARTY 
PROGRAMS OF MOST OF THE PARTIES IN BANGLADESH.  I SAID 
THAT THE TNDENCY ON THE PART OF SOME ELEMENTS 0F THE 
AL TO THINK IN TERMS OF OCIALIST SOLUTIONS HAD ALWAYS 
BEEN TROUBLESOME TO US.  I ALS MENTIONED THAT, AS 
HAD BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS, THERE 
WERE SMALL ELEMENTS OF HER PARTY AND OF THE LEFTIST 
PARTIES WITH WHICH THE AL IS ALIGNED, TOWARDS A KNEE- 
JERK ANTI-AMERICANISM.  SHE RESPONDED THAT THERE IS 
STILL THE FEELING AMONG SOME MEMBERS OF HER PARTY\'S 
CADRE THAT THE U.S. WAS SOMEHOW IMPLICATED IN THE 
ASSASSINATION OF HER FATHER.  SHEIKH HASINA SAID THAT 
SHE HAD TAKEN GREAT RISK WHEN SHE VISITED THE U.S. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE MIDDLE 1980\'S.  SHE STATED 
THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRITICIZED LOUDLY BY MANY PARTS OF 
HER PARTY AS WELL AS OTHER PARTIES FOR DOING BUSINESS 
WITH THE AMERICANS.  SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SHE 
DOES NOT THINK THAT MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF HER PARTY 
STILL HOLD THIS VIEW, BUT THAT SOME DO.  SHE SAID 
THAT PERHAPS THE U.S. SHOULD HAVE WORKED HARDER TO 
REBUT THESE ALLEGATIONS IN THE EARLY YEARS AFTER THEY 
OCCURRED, AND THAT THE USG SHOULD STILL SEEK TO ASSURE 
PEOPLE THAT IT HAD NO CONNECTION WITH SHEIKH MUJIB\'S 
DEATH, WHENEVER THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES. 
 
11.  SHEIKH HASINA SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME 
EXPLAINING WHY THE PARTY\'S CALL FOR SOCIALISM WAS 
REALLY NOT/NOT A CALL FOR SOCIALISM.  SHE SAID THAT 
SHE PERSONALLY HAD NO SYMPATHY FOR SOCIALISM, THAT SHE 
KNOWS THAT IT IS A FAILED SYSTEM, EVERYWHERE.  SHE SAID 
THAT THE ONLY PRESCRIPTION SHE WANTED WAS HOW TO HELP 
THE BANGLADESH PEOPLE DEVELOP ECONOMICALLY. 
 
12.  I ASSURED HER AGAIN THAT WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN 
THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF COUNTRIES AND WE WORK 
POSITIVELY WITH FREELY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS.  SHE 
MENTIONED THAT IN PART, THE ANTI-AMERICAN CAST OF 
SOME AL WORKERS MIGHT ALSO STEM FROM OUR PERCEIVED 
PROCLIVITY TO WORK WITH ANTI-DEMOCRATIC FORCES SUCH 
AS THE PREVIOUS REGIME.  (NOTE: SHEIKH HASINA CON- 
TINUALLY THROWS THE REGIME OF ZIA RAHMAN INTO THE 
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC FORCES.) 
 
13.  THE MEETING ENDED ON A VERY FRIENDLY NOTE.  TOWARDS 
THE END, I SUGGESTED THAT IF SHEIKH HASINA WERE PRIME 
MINISTER WE WOULD BE WORKING CLOSELY AND POSITIVELY 
WITH HER, AS WE WOULD WITH MOST GOVERNMENTS.  WHEN I 
SAID THAT SHE MIGHT NOW BE PRIME MINISTER, SHE LIFTED 
HER EYES TO THE CEILING AND SAID \"GOD HELP ME,\" 
IMPLYING VERY STRONGLY THAT SHE WAS PERFECTLY PREPARED 
AT THIS POINT IN BANGLADESH HISTORY, WITH ALL THE 
IMMENSE PROBLEMS THE NEW GOVERNMENT FACES, TO SIT IN 
OPPOSITION.  DURING THIS SAME PART OF THE CONVERSATION, 
I HAD MENTIONED THE TREMENDOUS TASK THE GOVERNMENT 
HAS IN REFORMING THE ECONOMY AND SHE AGREED WITH 
THAT, AND UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WOULD TAKE VERY, VERY 
HARD DECISIONS ON VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES. 
 
- 
14.  COMMENT:  I AM UNABLE TO JUDGE WHETHER SHEIKH 
HASINA REALLY BELIEVES THAT THE U\"S. OPPOSES HER 
OR HER PARTY.  HOWEVER, THE LENGTH OF THE MEETING, 
ITS WARMTH, AND HER RELAXATION CLEARLY INDICATE THAT 
SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE HER TIES TO ME, TO THIS MISSION, 
AND TO THE USG.

REF:  DHAKA 6682 
 
1.  CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT. 
 
2.  SUMMARY: THE OPPOSITION AWAMI LEAGUE ALLEGES THAT 
ITS LEADER SHEIKH HASINA WAS TARGET OF AN ASSASSINATION 
ATTEMPT SEP 23 DURING A \"WHISTLESTOP\" RAIL TOUR OF 
WESTERN BANGLADESH.  ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION 
SUPPORTERS CLASHED, WE HAVE SO FAR SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT 
AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT TOOK PLACE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3.  CLASHES BETWEEN RULING BANGLADESH NATIONALIST PARTY 
(BNP) AND OPPOSITION AWAMI LEAGUE SUPPORTERS BROKE OUT 
AT THE ISHURDI AND NATORE TRAIN STATIONS IN WESTERN 
BANGLADESH SEPTEMBER 23, COINCIDING WITH STOPS BY AWAMI 
LEAGUE (AL) CHIEF AND LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION SHEIKH 
HASINA.  HASINA HAS BEEN ON A PROLONGED \"WHISTLESTOP\" 
TOUR--A \"TRAIN MARCH\"--OF THE REGION TO DRUM UP SUPPORT 
FOR THE OPPOSITION\'S SEPTEMBER 27 RAIL AND HIGHWAY 
BLOCKADE AND ITS DEMAND FOR A CARETAKER GOVERNMENT TO 
OVERSEE THE COUNTRY\'S NEXT GENERAL ELECTION. 
 
4.  ACCORDING TO PRESS REPORTS, BNP PARTISANS ARMED WITH 
BLUNT WEAPONS AND HOMEMADE FIRECRACKERS ATTACKED AL 
SUPPORTERS PROCEEDING TO THE ISHURDI STATION.  POLICE 
OPENED FIRE AT ONE POINT TO BRING THE SITUATION UNDER 
CONTROL.  REPORTS ALSO QUOTED WITNESSES WHO SAID 
HASINA\'S RAIL CAR WAS FIRED UPON AS IT PULLED INTO THE 
NATORE STATION.  FIRECRACKERS WERE TOSSED AS HASINA 
ADDRESSED CROWDS FROM HER COMPARTMENT.  THE CLASHES LEFT 
BETWEEN 60-100 INJURED, NONE CRITICALLY. 
 
5.  AWAMI LEAGUE STALWARTS BLAMED THE VIOLENCE ON THE 
BNP GOVERNMENT.  AWAMI LEAGUE INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 
SECRETARY KAISER CHOWDHURY CALLED POLOFF SEPTEMBER 23 TO 
SAY THAT \"THE LEADER HAS BEEN FIRED UPON.\"  AL DEPUTY 
LEADER ABDUS SAMAD AZAD TOLD REPORTERS THAT \"BNP 
TERRORISTS\" HAD LAUNCHED A PLANNED ATTACK AGAINST HASINA 
AND CREATED A \"REIGN OF TERROR\" AT ISHURDI AND NATORE. 
AWAMI LEAGUE SECRETARY GENERAL ZILLUR RAHMAN DECRIED THE 
\"ASSASINATION ATTEMPT,\" WHICH HE SAID WAS \"MASTERMINDED 
BY THE HIGEST QUARTERS OF THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION.\" 
HASIA VOWED THAT NO ATTACK WOULD DETER THE MOVEMENT FO 
CARETAKER GOVERNMENT, AND THAT SHE STOOD READY O \"GIVE 
MY OWN BLOOD.\" 
 
6.  THE GOVERNMENT, FO ITS PART, ISSUED A PRESS NOTE 
SEPTEMBER 24 STATNG A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION HAD 
FOUND NO TRUTHIN THE ALLEGATIN THAT HASINA\'S TRAIN WAS 
SHOT A.  IN REALITY, READ THE NOTE, HASINA ADDRESSED 
COWDS AT WAYSIDE STATIONS IN A PEACEFUL ATMOSPHERE,AND 
SUFFICIENT POLICE WERE MOBILIZED FOR HER SAFETY. 
\"UNRULY SUPPORTERS\" OF OPPOSING POLITICAL PARTIES WERE 
PRESENT IN NATORE AND ISHURDI, THROWING FIRECRACKERS, 
BUT POLICE RESTORED ORDER QUICKLY.  A FRONT-PAGE 
EDITORIAL IN THE PRO-BNP ENGLISH DAILY \"NEW NATION\" 
SARCASTICALLY POINTED OUT THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME HASINA HAD TRIED TO DRAMATIZE FOR POLITICAL GAIN 
ALLEGED ATTEMPTS ON HER LIFE. 
 
7.  THE AWAMI LEAGUE HAS NOT PRESSED THE GOVERNMENT FOR 
A FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENTS AT ISHURDI 
AND NATORE, ALTHOUGH TOP AWAMI LEAGUE ADVISOR KIBRIA 
FAXED THE AMBASSADOR EXPRESSING \"DEEP CONCERN ABOUT THE 
ATTACK ON THE LIFE OF SHEIKH HASINA.\"  ACCORDING TO 
KIBRIA, \"THE GRAVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE TERROR CAMPAIGN 
BY THE GOVERNMENT PARTY\" WILL BECOME CLEAR WHEN ALL THE 
FACTS ARE OUT.  KIBRIA DID NOT SPECIFY WHEN THIS MIGHT 
HAPPEN. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
8.  WE HAVE LITTLE FACTUAL BASIS TO SORT OUT CONFLICTING 
CLAIMS AND DETERMINE WHETHER HASINA WAS THE TARGET OF AN 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.  (WE WILL REPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT 
NEW INFORMATION.)  HOWEVER, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE 
SUGGESTS THAT THE CLASHES WERE NOT PART OF A 
PREMEDITATED ATTEMPT ON HER LIFE.  THE MOST BELIEVABLE 
ACCOUNTS WE HAVE HEARD BLAME THE VIOLENCE ON STATE 
MINISTER FAZLUR RAHMAN, WHO HAILS FROM NEAR NATORE AND 
WHOSE OWN BNP RALLY THERE WAS DISRUPTED BY OPPOSITION 
AWAMI LEAGUE SUPPORTERS A FEW WEEKS EARLIER.  RAHMAN 
ALLEGEDLY HELD A GRUDGE AND SENT OUT SOME OF HIS \"BOYS\" 
TO BREAK UP HASINA\'S RALLY.  OTHER REPORTS SUGGEST THE 
AWAMI LEAGUE KNEW IT WOULD FACE BNP DEMONSTRATIONS IN 
THE REGION BEFORE THE TRAIN SET OUT THE MORNING OF THE 
23RD.  IN ADDITION, ALL ACCOUNTS AGREE THAT HASINA 
COMPLETED HER SPEECHES AT ISHURDI AND NATORE AND DID NOT 
FLEE OR SEEK COVER DESPITE THE ALLEGED SHOTS AT HER 
TRAIN.  WHAT IS CERTAIN IS THAT THE AWAMI LEAGUE HAS 
SOUGHT TO WHIP UP POPULAR INDIGNATION OVER THE INCIDENTS 
AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE ITS PUBLIC DENUNCIATIONS 
OF GOVERNMENT \"TERRORISM.\"

SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR\'S INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH 
BANGLADESH PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA 
 
1. (U) CLASSIFIED BY AMBASSADOR JOHN HOLZMAN.  REASON 
1.5 (D). 
 
2. (C) SUMMARY:  PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA USED 
HER INTRODUCTORY MEETING WITH AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN TO 
PRESS HARD FOR A PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO BANGLADESH. 
SHE SAID THAT SHE, AND THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH, \"ARE 
EXPECTING A VISIT BY THE PRESIDENT.\"  FOREIGN 
SECRETARY FAROOQ SOBHAN ADDED THAT WHAT HE PERCEIVED 
TO BE A RECENT \"GOLDEN AGE\" IN U.S.-BANGLADESHI 
RELATIONS WOULD BE DISRUPTED IF THE PRESIDENT DECIDED 
NOT TO COME.  THE PRIME MINISTER ASSURED THE 
AMBASSADOR THAT THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTE FAIRNESS IN 
THE EVALUATIONS OF THE CURRENT ROUND OF GAS BIDS, AND 
ADDED THAT SHE WOULD ENDEAVOR TO ACCELERATE THE 
APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE UNOCAL PRODUCTION-SHARING 
CONTRACT (PSC), SO THAT THE AGREEMENT COULD BE SIGNED 
DURING A/S INDERFURTH\'S VISIT NEXT WEEK.  THE PRIME 
MINISTER THANKED THE U.S. FOR ASSISTING WITH THE 
PROTECTION OF HER FAMILY MEMBERS.  END SUMMARY. 
 
3. (C) ON SEPTEMBER 3, AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN, 
ACCOMPANIED BY DCM TED NIST (NOTETAKER), PAID AN 
INTRODUCTORY CALL ON PRIME MINISTER SHEIKH HASINA. 
ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WERE FOREIGN SECRETARY FAROOQ 
SOBHAN, MFA AMERICAS AND PACIFIC DIRECTOR GENERAL 
ASHRAF UD-DOULA, PRINCIPAL SECRETARY TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER S.A. SAMAD, PRESS SECRETARY TO THE PRIME 
MINISTER JAWADUL KARIM, AND ASSISTANT PRIVATE 
SECRETARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER IBRAHEEM HOSEIN KHAN. 
 
\"WE EXPECT YOUR PRESIDENT TO COME TO BANGLADESH\" 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
4. (C) FOLLOWING AN EXCHANGE OF PLEASANTRIES, 
AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN DISCUSSED POSSIBLE VISITS TO THE 
REGION BY U.S. OFFICIALS.  HE OBSERVED THAT ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY INDERFURTH WOULD BE COMING NEXT WEEK.  HE 
ADDED THAT BOTH PRESIDENT CLINTON AND SECRETARY 
ALBRIGHT ARE CONSIDERING TRIPS TO THE REGION, BUT 
STRESSED THAT NEITHER HAS DECIDED DEFINITELY TO COME 
TO BANGLADESH.  THE PRIME MINISTER RESPONDED \"WE 
EXPECT (PRESIDENT CLINTON) TO COME TO BANGLADESH.\" 
SHE REMEMBERED FONDLY MRS. CLINTON\'S TRIP TO 
BANGLADESH IN 1995, AND THEIR EXPERIENCE IN FEBRUARY 
AS CO-CHAIRS OF THE MICROCREDIT SUMMIT IN 
WASHINGTON.  SHE RECALLED HER \"EXCELLENT MEETING\" 
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND SAID SHE APPRECIATED THE LETTER THE 
PRESIDENT HAD SENT HER FOLLOWING THE DENVER ECONOMIC 
SUMMIT.  SHE NOTED THE \"STRONG LINKS\" THAT THE AWAMI 
LEAGUE HAS WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, INCLUDING ITS 
ASSISTANCE WITH FUND-RAISING AND POLITICAL ACTION. 
SHE ALSO RECALLED HER ATTENDANCE AT THE 1992 
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.  IT\'S NOT JUST THE 
GOVERNMENT, SHE CONCLUDED: \"THE PEOPLE OF BANGLADESH 
WANT PRESIDENT CLINTON TO VISIT.\" 
 
5. (C) FOREIGN SECRETARY SOBHAN ECHOED THE PRIME 
MINISTER\'S SENTIMENTS.  THIS IS SOMETHING THE ENTIRE 
COUNTRY IS LOOKING FORWARD TO, HE SAID.  HE ADDED 
THAT IN HIS VIEW, PRESIDENT CLINTON\'S VISIT WILL BE 
AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR BANGLADESH\'S 
EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN DEMOCRACY AND GOOD GOVERNANCE.  A 
CLINTON VISIT, HE SAID, WOULD BE A VERY POWERFUL 
SIGNAL TO THE PEOPLE IN BANGLADESH AND THE REGION, 
AND WOULD REINFORCE BANGLADESH\'S COMMITMENT TO 
PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.  A DECISION BY THE PRESIDENT 
NOT TO COME WOULD, HE SAID, CAUSE \"SERIOUS 
MISGIVINGS.\"  HE ADDED THAT \"WE DON\'T HAVE 
EXAGGERATED EXPECTATIONS ... EVEN A ONE-DAY VISIT 
WOULD BE APPRECIATED.\" 
 
A \"GOLDEN AGE\"? 
--------------- 
6. (C) ON A ROLL, SOBHAN CHARACTERIZED THE LAST 
FOURTEEN MONTHS (SINCE THE ELECTION OF THE PRIME 
MINISTER) AS A \"GOLDEN AGE\" OF U.S.-BANGLADESHI 
RELATIONS.  HE POINTED TO THE PRIME MINISTER\'S TWO 
TRIPS TO THE UNITED STATES, HER MEETINGS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND MRS. CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE, AND 
THE MICROCREDIT SUMMIT.  HE ALSO NOTED THE RECENT 
INCREASE IN U.S. INVESTMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE 
ENERGY FIELD. 
 
GAS 
--- 
7. (C) THE AMBASSADOR OBSERVED THAT IN THIS 
CONNECTION, THERE HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION AND 
CONCERN ON THE PART OF A NUMBER OF THE U.S. COMPANIES 
THAT SUBMITTED BIDS JULY 16 FOR THE SECOND GAS 
ROUND.  SOME AMERICAN COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED THAT 
ANOTHER COMPANY, NOT FROM THE U.S. (NOTE: SHELL.  END 
NOTE), HAS BEEN GIVEN AN ADVANTAGE IN THE EVALUATION 
OF ITS BIDS.  U.S. COMPANIES, HE STRESSED, WILL BE 
ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE RESULTS, SO LONG AS THE PROCESS 
IS FAIR AND OPEN, AND THE OUTCOME CLEARLY SERVES 
BANGLADESH\'S NATIONAL INTERESTS. 
 
8. (C) AFTER CONFERRING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, 
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY SAMAD SAID THE EVALUATION PROCESS 
WILL BE TRANSPARENT, AND THE PLAYING FIELD WILL BE 
LEVEL FOR ALL COMPETITORS.  THE PRIME MINISTER\'S 
OFFICE WILL SCRUTINIZE THE PROCESS, HE SAID, EVEN 
BEFORE THE \"SHORT LISTS\" ARE PREPARED.  HE NOTED THAT 
OF THE FOUR CONCERNS ALREADY WITH CONCESSIONS IN 
BANGLADESH, THREE ARE AMERICAN. (NOTE: THE THREE ARE 
OCCIDENTAL, UNITED MERIDIAN, AND REXWOOD/OKLAND.  IN 
ADDITION, HALLIBURTON AND UNOCAL HAVE CONTRACTUAL 
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER CONCESSIONAIRES.  END NOTE). 
 
9. (C) THE PRIME MINISTER ASSURED THE AMBASSADOR THAT 
THERE WOULD BE \"ABSOLUTE FAIRNESS\" IN THE EVALUATION 
OF THE BIDS, AND SAID THAT SHE HAS GIVEN VERY 
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO THOSE WHO ARE WORKING ON IT 
TO TREAT ALL COMPANIES FAIRLY.  SAMAD ADDED THAT THE 
PRIME MINISTER HAD ASSIGNED HIM TO OVERSEE THE 
PROCESS.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CREDIBILITY IN THE BID 
ROUND IS \"TERRIBLY IMPORTANT.\" 
 
UNOCAL SIGNING PROPOSAL 
----------------------- 
10. (C) THE AMBASSADOR THEN MADE A SPECIFIC 
SUGGESTION - THAT THE BDG MOVE QUICKLY IN APPROVING 
THE PSC (PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACT) FOR THE UNOCAL 
SHAHBAZPUR PROJECT, SO THAT THE AGREEMENT COULD BE 
SIGNED DURING ASSISTANT SECRETARY INDERFURTH\'S VISIT 
TO BANGLADESH ON SEPTEMBER 10-12.  THE PRIME MINISTER 
RESPONDED, \"SURE; I THINK IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE.\" 
SAMAD SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE 
\"AT LEAST TO INITIAL\" THE CONTRACTS, BUT AMBASSADOR 
HOLZMAN PRESSED TO HAVE A REAL SIGNING, SO THAT 
UNOCAL COULD BEGIN ITS WORK AT THE OUTSET OF THE 
COMING DRY SEASON, AND MAKE GOOD ON ITS AGREEMENT TO 
DELIVER GAS TO POWER PLANTS FOR THE ENERGY-STARVED 
WESTERN REGION (SHEIKH HASINA COMES FROM THIS REGION). 
 
SECURITY CONCERNS 
----------------- 
11. (C) THE PRIME MINISTER CLOSED BY NOTING HER 
APPRECIATION FOR THE USG\'S PROTECTION OF HER FAMILY 
IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REQUESTED ITS HELP IN 
APPREHENDING ANY PEOPLE SUSPECTED OF HER FATHER\'S 
KILLING WHO MIGHT BE IN THE UNITED STATES. 
AMBASSADOR HOLZMAN NOTED THAT IF ANY OF THE SUSPECTS 
WERE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY WOULD PROBABLY 
REQUEST ASYLUM; AFTER THAT, THEIR FATE WOULD BE IN 
THE HANDS OF THE COURT SYSTEM, WHICH COULD MOVE VERY 
SLOWLY.  DCM ADDED THAT THE USG WOULD APPRECIATE ANY 
INFORMATION THE BDG MIGHT HAVE ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC 
THREATS TO MEMBERS OF THE PRIME MINISTER\'S FAMILY, SO 
THAT WE CAN PASS THIS INFORMATION TO LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
12. (C) THIS WAS A VERY CORDIAL FIRST MEETING.  THE 
AMBASSADOR BEGAN BY GIVING THE PRIME MINISTER A 
POPULAR AMERICAN CHILDREN\'S BOOK FOR HER NEW 
GRANDDAUGHTER, AND THIS CLEARLY PUT THE PRIME 
MINISTER IN A VERY FRIENDLY FRAME OF MIND. 
 
13. (C) THE BDG IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS FOR A 
CLINTON VISIT.  ANYONE WHO IS PERCEIVED BY THE BDG TO 
HAVE ANY INFLUENCE OVER THIS DECISION CAN EXPECT TO 
BE LOBBIED, AND LOBBIED HARD.

SUBJECT: JAMMAT-ISLAMI BANGLADESH DENY INVOLVEMENT IN 
ATTACK ON SHEIKH HASINA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: AMBASSADOR HARRY K. THOMAS, REASONS 1.4 (B)(D) 
 
1.  (C) On September 12, Ambassador met with Jammat-Islami 
Bangladesh (JMB) Assistant General Secretary Abdul Razzack 
and advisor Shah Abdul Hannan.  Both stressed that the JMB (a 
partner in the ruling coalition) did not participate in the 
August 21 attack on the opposition Awami League and argued 
that the BDG was doing everything possible to solve the 
crime.  They said that while the JMB did not believe that 
India was responsible for the attacks, they are concerned 
that Indian leaders and journalists are making saber rattling 
statements about pre-emptive strikes against Bangladesh in an 
attempt to intimidate the government.  Hannan alleged that 
India\'s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) is conducting a 
smear campaign aimed at linking the JMB to the attack in the 
public\'s mind. India\'s goal aim is to destabilize the BDG and 
bring Sheikh Hasina to power, they asserted. 
 
2. (C) Ambassador responded that the USG welcomed assurances 
that the JMB was not involved in this attack and said the 
best way to silence critics is to solve the crime. 
Ambassador added that the failure to solve the recent arms 
hauls or bombings in Sylhet continue to give credence to 
charges that the BDG is covering up crimes and that extremist 
elements are involved.  Ambassador then expressed USG concern 
with the violent activities of the Shabir (JMB student wing) 
and stressed that the Shabir has to participate in the 
democratic process without violence.  Hannan initially stated 
that the Shabir is only responding to attacks against it by 
the BNP and Awami League student wings but Razzack admitted 
that the Shabir has sometimes been involved in \"excess acts\" 
but that they have been told to halt all violent actions. 
Razzack indicated that the JMB has counseled the Shabir to 
halt violent activities against the minority Ahmadiyyas.  He 
then invited the Ambassador to have dinner with the Shabir 
leaders. 
 
3. (C) Comment:  We are looking forward to taking the 
Shabir\'s measure but remain concerned about its violent 
predilections.   The JMB, clearly stung by charges that it is 
responsible for the August 21 attacks, is working to assure 
the USG that it remains committed to democracy and 
non-violence but many of its younger members appear to 
support violent behavior and are opposed to western values. 
We will keep a close watch.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN SECRETARY THINKS INDIANS BEHIND AUGUST 21 
ATTACK 
 
Classified By: POLCOUN D.C. Mccullough, Reason(s): 1.4 (b),(d) 
 
1. (C)  DAS Torkel Patterson met with Foreign Secretary 
Shamsheer Chowdhury on September 13 with Ambassador Thomas 
and Poloff (notetaker). With renewed rains, downed trees and 
flooded roads blocking traffic, Patterson noted to Chowdhury 
the difficulties presented by the August flooding and 
expressed the desire of the international community to help 
in mitigating damage. He then pressed Chowdhury on the need 
for action in the investigation of the attack of August 21. 
He stated the reason for his visit was to express US and 
international concern over political violence in Bangladesh, 
including the attack on the British High Commissioner and 
unexplained arms seizures. DAS Patterson stressed that a 
government must protect its citizens and their right to speak 
in opposition to the government urging the setting aside of 
political differences and focusing on solving this crime. 
 
2. (C) Chowdhury deflected Patterson\'s call for action. While 
he agreed with the need for action he blamed the Awami League 
for any inaction citing Sheikh Hasina\'s refusal to see Prime 
Minister Zia as evidence of their lack of cooperation in the 
investigation. He scoffed at the AL notion that the 
government is behind the attack. \"No government is foolish 
enough to inflict this (attack) on itself.\"  He criticized 
the AL for any future problems saying that the politics of 
blaming the government is \"bound to set something off.\" And 
as for the attack itself, he said it was an \"intelligence 
failure\" that allowed this to happen, and that the US itself 
was not immune from this sort of thing. 
 
3 (C) In searching for a culprit, he noted that one \"can\'t 
choose your neighbors.\" He cited  \"certain reactions from 
abroad\" and described a recent discovery of some Indians 
smuggling grenades into Bangladesh, asking rhetorically, that 
in South Asian politics, \"whose interest is it to have 
instability in the region?\" 
 
4. (C) Noting the accusations, Ambassador Thomas raised to 
Chowdhury the issue of heated remarks in the media by 
officials in India and Bangladesh and hoped the rhetoric will 
\"cool down.\"  Chowdhury responded that he will speak to the 
Indian Secretary  \"tomorrow\" preferring to discuss relations 
\"not through the media but over a table.\"  Nonetheless, 
Chowdhury decried the security situation where there are 
those who want their own territory separate from Bangladesh 
and who have their own weapons training, ideology and Email 
addresses. 
 
5. (C) Comment: BDG is getting inventive in explaining why 
they are not able to conduct a police investigation into the 
attacks of August 21. They blame the AL, they blame 
\"intelligence failure\" and they blame the Indians for the 
attack but are unable to produce evidence behind these 
allegations. With the US position well known to BDG, it might 
well be time to focus our position on asking if a conclusive 
report will be published recounting the findings of the 
investigation. End Comment. 
 
6. (U)  This cable has been cleared by DAS Patterson.

SUBJECT: USG REJECTS REQUEST FOR SUPPORT FOR POSSIBLE COUP 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Harry K. Thomas, reasons 1.4 b and d 
 
1. (S) Summary: Retired Bangladesh Army Chief Khan asked for 
USG support in ending Bangladesh,s current administration 
and in bringing a government of national unity consisting of 
senior leaders of both major parties.  Khan said 
Bangladesh,s only way out of dynastic government and the 
rise of Islamic extremism was to draft a new constitution 
based on the presidential system that would prevent current 
Prime Minster Zia or former Prime Minister Hasina from 
holding office. He asked for USG support for a two-three year 
interim government and a constitutional assembly. Ambassador 
responded that the USG would not under any circumstances 
support a coup against the Bangladesh Government (BDG), would 
ensure that any military action against Prime Minister Zia 
would result in sanctions against the successor government. 
End Summary. 
 
2. (S) Ambassador recently dined with Lt. General Noorudin. 
Khan (retired), former Chief of Army Staff and Awami League 
cabinet minister, who requested USG assistance in bringing a 
government of national unity to power and ridding Bangladesh 
of Sheikh Hasina and Khaledia Zia through a series of mass 
agitations.  Ambassador told Khan that the USG supports 
democracy and stability and cannot sanction any extra 
constitutional means of removing the government. The USG does 
not support military coups stressed the Ambassador. 
 
3. (S) Khan responded that Bangladesh,s future is hostage to 
two women who cannot put aside their difference for the 
nation,s sake.  Khan accused the BDG of bankrupting the 
military.  He said the seven top generals &who he derided as 
the malevolent seven8 were the Prime Minister,s brother 
(Retired Major Eskander,s) classmates and were chosen for 
their loyalty and not competence.  He said that the BDG had 
started the politicization of the officer,s corps during 
Zia,s first term (91-96) and that Hasina had accelerated it 
(96-2001).  He recommended that General Abu Tayeb Mahammad 
Zaahirul Alam (called General Zahir), commandant of the 
National Defense College, take charge of the country.  He 
said that General Zahir is a true supporter of democracy and 
would form a government with competent ministers from both 
parties for two-three years to improve Bangladesh,s weak 
institutions, draft a new constitution, end corruption and to 
attract much needed foreign investment before holding 
internationally observed democratic elections. 
 
4. (S) Khan alleged that the BDG fears coups even from its 
Eskander,s batch mates and had sidelined Major General Rokon 
to the Quartermaster Corps earlier this year because he was 
thought to be a threat to the current government.  (Comment: 
There is much speculation over Rokon,s reassignment and 
while it could have been because he is one of the few 
officers thought capable of staging a coup, he is a batch 
mate of the Prime Minister,s brother and may have been 
placed in a holding pattern until a more lucrative assignment 
opens in the coming months.  End Comment.) 
 
5. (S) Khan, a former minister under Sheikh Hasina resigned 
from the Awami League in early 2004 in frustration with its 
inability to focus on the future.  He accused &Hasina of 
losing her cards8 after the August 21 attack on the Awami 
League.  Instead of calling for an independent investigation 
and taking the moral high ground, she insisted on repeated 
strikes and attempted to bring the government down.  She lost 
popular support and an unintended consequence may be that the 
BDG no longer feels compelled to solve the crime, he said. 
Khan said that an interim military government is the only 
alternative to continued dynastic politics.  He said that 
first son Tariq Rahman and his younger brother Arafat Rahman 
& will terrorize the country, extort money from businesses 
and ruin the economy.8  Khan also belittled the political 
abilities of Hasina,s son and sister, asserting they were 
equally as corrupt and venal as the Rahman,s. 
 
6. (S) Khan, in part, blames himself for the country,s 
current predicament.  He said that when Bangladeshi military 
dictator General Ershad was forced out office in 1991, then 
Pakistani military chief Alam Beg, an old friend and 
colleague sent him an emissary urging that Khan become the 
President. When Khan refused, Beg asked whom should Pakistan 
support. Khan recommended that Pakistan support the BNP 
because it consisted of military officers and small 
businessmen he believed would lead the country in the right 
direction.  Pakistan, then used ISI to fund the BNP and 
India,s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) began funding the 
Awami League. Such funding continues to this day, Khan said. 
We have become the playground for India and Pakistan.  Khan 
claimed that New Delhi was unhappy with Sheikh Hasina,s 
performance and funded both parties during the 2001 
elections.  He claimed that RAW funded Tariq Rahman, who 
pledged to deliver his mother on gas exports and water 
sharing differences but was unable to do so. He predicted New 
Delhi would work hard to bring Hasina back to power in 2006. 
 
7. (S) Khan said that the BDG is catering to the \"disastrous 
policies\" of Islamic parties in the ruling coalition to 
ensure that it wins the 2006 elections.  He blamed the BDG,s 
decision to ban books of the Ahmadiyya sect and not to 
follow-up on attacks in the northern city of Sylhet on the 
British High Commissioner and the Mayor on its need to 
protect the Islamists. 
 
8. (S) On September 13, Lt. Gen. Mahbubur Rahman, another 
retired Army Chief and current BNP MP, told Ambassador that 
the military would always look to the USG for a signal to go 
ahead with a coup. He said that the USG had played a positive 
role in helping to thwart two potential coups in 1996 and a 
no from the USG would always carry weight.  While expressing 
disdain for Sheikh Hasina and Begum Zia, Rahman predicted 
that Bangladesh would be under dynastic leadership for at 
least another generation.  He said that the Army views itself 
as Bangladesh,s only respected organization and does not 
want to interfere in civilian politics.  Earlier Major 
General Chowdhury, retired, told us that the military would 
no nothing to risk its participation in UN peacekeeping 
missions. 
 
Bio Note Zahir 
 
9. (S) General Zahir is a graduate of the British Staff 
College at Camberley and has traveled extensively, including 
the U.S. for military conferences.  He also served a 
battalion commander in UNIKOM.  Zahir has commanded two 
brigades and two divisions (most officers only get one 
command opportunity at each level) and is well respected by 
colleagues. 
 
10. (S) Comment: Khan maintains excellent ties to the 
military but may be acting on his own.  Many interlocutors 
discount the possibility of a coup but we will keep a close 
eye on military activities. We will take advantage of DAS 
Patterson,s October visit to arrange speaking opportunities 
and meeting with the military to stress the importance of 
civilian leadership, including an address to the National 
Defense College and a meeting with General Zahir. 
 
11.  (S) The United States has tremendous leverage over both 
the Bangladeshi military and civilian rulers because of 
Dhaka,s increasing role in UN peacekeeping missions. 
Bangladesh currently has 12,000 troops participating in UNPKO 
and we should use the carrot and stick approach to remind 
Dhaka that: a) a coup would end their participation in PKO 
and b) that failure to solve terrorist crimes and allowing 
Islamist groups to operate would call into question 
Bangladesh,s ability to join PKOs.   End Comment.

SUBJECT: EXCHANGE WITH CHAIRMAN OF EXTREMIST ISLAMIST GROUP 
 
Classified By: P/E Counselor D.C. McCullough, reason para 1.5 d. 
 
 1. (C) Summary.  At a chance encounter with polcouns, IOJ 
Chairman Fazlul Haq Amini denounced Jamaat Islami as power 
hungry, criticized the BDG on several fronts, opposed the 
proposed USD 2 billion Tata investment in Bangladesh, 
indicated the Awami League has offered him money to quit the 
ruling alliance, and described in general terms his vision 
for Bangladesh as a truly Islamic state.  How, he asked, 
could IOJ could improve its image in the U.S. and why is the 
USG anti-madrassah?  End Summary. 
 
2. (C) At a small dinner on December 14, polcouns was 
encountered by Mufti Fazlul Haq Amini, MP and Chairman of his 
faction of Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ).  The USG, he noted, has 
negative opinions about the IOJ. During the one-hour exchange 
to clear up \"misunderstandings,\" the affable, sometimes 
humorous Amini 
 
-- Denounced Jamaat Islami Bangladesh (JIB) as power-hungry, 
and predicted the next generation of JIB leadership, trained 
in the violent Shibir student wing, would be \"extremist.\" 
IOJ, he claimed, is interested only in propagating Islamic 
values, not political power, and it is out-polled by JIB only 
because IOJ does not organize or operate as a political 
party.  He denied he has any interest in a cabinet seat. 
 
-- Declined to comment on the current political situation 
because, he smiled, his status as a member of the ruling 
coalition obliges him to be circumspect. 
 
-- Stated that legal and other changes would be required to 
make Bangladesh a truly Islamic state.  A Pakistan-like 
blasphemy law would be a good idea.  In this new state, women 
would have the vote, sharia/interest free banking would be 
implemented, taxes other than zakat would be lowered but not 
eliminated, and religious minorities would not be deemed as 
second class citizens.  He could think of no foreign model 
for Bangladesh or IOJ. 
 
-- Accepted women working in garment factories, but said they 
should be segregated from men. 
 
-- Saw no differences in outlook between Islamist parties in 
Pakistan and Bangladesh, or between Bangladeshi and Pakistani 
societies. 
 
-- Denied any kind of relationship with PMO Parliamentary 
Affairs Advisor S.Q. Chowdhury, one of the BNP\'s principal 
defenders of including IOJ in the ruling alliance. 
 
-- Characterized Ahmadis as non-Muslims attempting to deceive 
\"real\" Muslims, when asked why IOJ had mounted such a big 
campaign against such a small minority.  JIB, he added, has 
identical views on Ahmadis. 
 
-- Rationalized IOJ\'s presence in the ruling coalition, 
despite popular displeasure over corruption and poor 
governance, by saying IOJ supporters know this is preferable 
to giving political advantage to Awami League president 
Sheikh Hasina, whose actions when she was in power against 
IOJ madrassahs and allegations against him of terrorism were 
\"un-Islamic.\" 
 
-- Characterized Hasina as unscrupulous, said he had been 
approached by AL leaders to reach a \"political 
understanding,\"  and indicated they had offered him money to 
quit the ruling party alliance. 
 
-- Opposed the proposed USD 2 billion steel/power investment 
in Bangladesh by the Indian Tata group because it would lead 
to Indian exploitation of a Bangladeshi natural resource. 
Asked if he opposed on similar grounds the big Chinese coal 
mine in northern Bangladesh, Amini replied that his desire 
for good relations with China precluded a direct answer. 
 
-- Blamed the August 21 attack on Sheikh Hasina on people 
wanting to destabilize Bangladesh. 
 
-- Credited the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) with improving 
law and order, but at the cost of killing many people. 
 
-- Stated he has never traveled to the U.S., but has visited 
the UK. 
 
-- Requested regular inter-action for the sake of enhanced 
understanding, but dodged the question of what he felt the 
appropriate U.S. role should be in Bangladesh.  He also 
declined to repeat his host\'s suggestion that he wants 
\"friendly\" relations with the U.S. 
 
3. (C) Asked how IOJ could better improve its image in the 
U.S., polcouns suggested that IOJ demonstrate its support for 
democracy and human rights, and in particular condemn on 
principle attacks on Ahmadis, Hindus, and the political 
opposition.  Amini claimed, weakly, that he had done this; 
polcouns urged him to give such condemnations greater 
publicity.  Amini then asked why the USG believes madrassahs 
do nothing but train terrorists.  Polcouns noted that 
madrassahs serve as a critical educational safety net in many 
countries, and that only a handful of madrassahs with a 
history of sending graduates into terrorism attract this type 
of concern. 
 
4. (C) Bio: Amini is also principal of the big Lalbagh 
madrassah in Dhaka, and president of the Ulama Parishad 
(Council of Islamic Scholars).  At the end of 2003, he 
spearheaded the anti-Ahmadiyya campaign, and before that the 
campaign against noted Bangladeshi feminist author Taslima 
Nasreen.  He is known for strong anti-U.S., anti-West, and 
anti-NGO views.  His denials aside, he is widely believed to 
want a cabinet seat, which some observers cited as the 
driving motivation behind his anti-Ahmadiyya agitation. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Amini, friendly and on his best behavior, 
steered clear of anything patently controversial, in part by 
offering virtually no opinion without direct prompting. 
IOJ-BNP animosities are well known, but the sharpness of his 
criticism of JIB was unexpected and is not reciprocated when 
we ask JIB about IOJ.  Amini lacks the polish and worldly 
knowledge of mainstream Islamist leaders, but was at ease 
with foreigners and Bangladeshis who were drinking and who 
had views contrary to his own.  Amini was summoned when the 
conversation turned to fears by a dissident BNP MP and a 
leader of Ershad\'s BJP that JIB, as an aggressive, \"armed\" 
vertically-integrated enterprise, poses a far greater threat 
to Bangladesh than does IOJ.  We are dubious but not 
completely dismissive of the notion that the AL wants to 
bribe Amini to defect from the BNP; we heard this allegation 
elsewhere two weeks ago, also from a someone with an anti-AL 
bias.

BLOCKED FUNDS 
 
REF: 04 DHAKA 1647 
 
Classified By: P/E Counselor D.C. McCullough, reason 1.4(b) 
 
1. (C) Summary. Proshika Chairman Qazi Farooq is cautiously 
optimistic that \"sympathetic\" BNP leaders will release the 
USD 50 million in donor funds blocked for three years by the 
NGO Affairs Bureau because of Proshika\'s alleged financial 
and political misdeeds.  Farooq blames Proshika\'s woes on 
Jamaat Islami disinformation, but BNP suspicions of socially 
progressive NGO\'s like Proshika run deep.  End Summary. 
 
2. (SBU) On December 30, polcouns met for 65 minutes with 
Proshika NGO Chairman Qazi Farooq Ahmed in Proshika\'s 
14-story headquarters for an update since their last meeting 
in May (reftel) two days before Farooq\'s latest detention. 
 
Beleaguered Proshika 
-------------------- 
 
3. (C) Farooq stated that: 
 
-- There are 20 outstanding cases against him and senior 
Proshika officials, 15 relating to corruption, two to 
\"anti-state\" actions (i.e., pro-opposition political 
support), and three tied to assaults on Proshika premises 
last spring--\"all with total government connivance and 
totally without foundation.\"  All reflect First Information 
Reports (FIR), with no formal charges having been filed.  \"As 
far as I know, no investigation is being carried out.\"  He 
has \"anticipatory\" bail for 17 cases.  The High Court has 
excused him from appearing personally for the monthly court 
hearing on three cases, and the 15 corruption cases are, for 
his convenience, all heard on a single day.  There are also 
22 tax cases against him, and eight against Proshika. 
 
-- High Court action forced the BDG to release him after his 
latest period of detention, and blocked efforts to hold him 
on remand, which contacts in the intelligence community had 
told him meant torture in a military interrogation cell. His 
current health is good, though his wife initially had trouble 
getting him insulin for his diabetes when he was in jail, 
where he also developed some heart problems. He lost 9 kilos 
in his one month of detention, before serving another month 
under house arrest. 
 
-- He has the right to travel abroad but doesn\'t for fear his 
re-entry would be blocked or he\'d be charged with 
\"absconding.\" 
 
-- The National Revenue Board (tax authorities) two days ago 
wrote one of Proshika\'s banks saying its accounts should be 
frozen because of a pending criminal tax liability, ignoring 
Proshika\'s legal right to appeal.  Proshika\'s lawyers have 
told this and its other banks that compliance with this 
letter would be illegal and expose them to counter-claims. 
 
-- People with close ties to the top of the BDG know the BDG 
has \"over-reached\" against Proshika, that there is little 
else they can do to harass it, and that the time has come for 
dialogue and reconciliation. 
 
-- Two weeks ago, the High Court struck down the NGO Affairs 
Bureau\'s new demand for NGO\'s to re-register every five 
years, saying the requirement had no basis in law.  A less 
onerous demand for renewing NGO licenses every five years 
remains in place. 
 
4. (C) In September and November, Farooq said, he met 
separately with Local Government Minister/BNP Secretary 
General Abdul Mannan Bhuyian, PMO Political Secretary Haris 
Chowdhury, and several BNP MP\'s, including Prime Minister 
Zia\'s brother.  All allegedly expressed support for 
Proshika\'s position, affirmed a desire to work with it on 
poverty alleviation, and undertook to promote a positive 
resolution of Proshika\'s standoff with the NGO Affairs 
Bureau.  They did not raise Farooq\'s alleged pro-Awami League 
actions, and Bhuyian reportedly characterized the blocking of 
nearly USD 50 million in donor funds to Proshika for three 
years as a \"mistake.\" 
 
5. (C) Farooq continues to blame Proshika\'s woes on 
\"rumor-mongering\" by Jamaat Islami, which objects to 
Proshika\'s traditional emphasis on women\'s empowerment 
programs.  He urged the international community, including 
the USG, to \"urge but not pressure\" the BDG to release 
Proshika\'s funds. 
 
Election Prospects 
------------------ 
 
6. (C) Farooq hopes for a generally free and fair general 
election in 2007 provided the Electoral Commission and BDG 
accept proposed reforms to: 
 
-- raise but then enforce the currently unrealistic spending 
cap of 300,000 taka (about USD 5,000) per constituency, and 
stop the sale by BNP and the Awami League of seat nominations 
for between 10-20 million taka; 
 
-- use people other than inherently pro-BDG District 
Commissioners as election returning officers; and 
 
-- use electronic voting. 
 
7. (C) Farooq acknowledged concerns that the Caretaker Chief 
Adviser presumptive, the current High Court Chief Justice, 
has a BNP lineage but said, \"He has been a good judge and has 
been able to rise above his party affiliation.  Maybe he can 
do that again.\"  Asked to comment on the speculated 
appointment this spring of Home Secretary Omar Farooq as the 
new Chief Election Commissioner, Farooq replied, \"He would be 
totally unacceptable.  He is not a man of integrity, and he 
has a long history as a Jamaat cadre.  It is said that the 
Rohyingas became armed and terrorists because of him, when he 
was commissioner in Chittagong.\" 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
8. (C) While it is positive that senior BNP figures like 
Bhuyian and Chowdhury received Farooq, BNP hard-liner 
suspicions of socially progressive NGO\'s like Proshika run 
deeper than Jamaat disinformation, and re-opening Proshika\'s 
donor pipeline seems unlikely.  More typical of the BDG\'s 
approach to such NGO\'s is the apparent \"Confidential\" report, 
passed to us by another beleaguered NGO, Rupantar, from the 
Home Ministry\'s \"Political Section\" urging the NGO Affairs 
Bureau to cancel Rupantar\'s registration because of the 
alleged financial and political misdeeds of its CEO, Swapan 
Guha, who is essentially accused of being an Indian agent. 
More encouragingly, the High Court\'s intervention on behalf 
of Farooq and the NGO\'s shows Bangladesh\'s apex judiciary 
still has the ability to constrain BDG excesses, and the 
difference between it and the BDG-controlled lower courts. 
For the BNP, such independence underscores why the BDG is 
dragging its feet on implementing High Court directives and 
its own campaign promises to separate the judiciary from the 
executive.

SUBJECT: NGO CONCERN PLANS TO WITHDRAW FROM ROHINGYA 
 
REFUGEE CAMPS DUE TO BDG PRESSURE 
 
Classified By: POLCOUN D.C. McCullough, reasons: 1.5 (b), (d) 
 
1. (C) Summary: Citing harassment from the BDG NGO Affairs 
Bureau, NGO Concern has decided to withdraw from Rohingya 
refugee camps. UNHCR says they plan on taking over Concern\'s 
programs until they find a permanent replacement. END SUMMARY 
 
2. (SBU) On January 4, Concern Country Director Columba 
O\'Dowd met with Poloffs to discuss her NGO\'s plans to 
withdraw from the Rohingya Refugee Camps.  Concern, the only 
international NGO at the Rohingya camps, provides sanitation, 
education, and procurement services to the Rohyingyan 
refugees. Other services in the camps are provided through 
the BDG\'s Ministry of Disaster and Food Management and 
Ministry of Health. 
 
3. (C) O\'Dowd stated that on December 24 the BDG\'s NGO 
Affairs Bureau (NGOAB) alleged in writing to Concern that a 
Concern employee was involved in \"anti-Rohingyan refugee 
repatriation\" work. When Concern requested further 
information on the allegation, she said, the NGOAB gave 
O\'Dowd an angry and verbally abusive phone call while 
refusing to state the nature of the anti-repatriation 
allegation. Citing the consistent NGOAB history of pressuring 
her staff at the camps, UNHCR\'s failures to intervene on 
their behalf, and citing her own concern for her staff\'s 
security O\'Dowd stated that she had decided to withdraw 
Concern from the Rohingya Camps. 
 
4. (C) On January 5 Poloff met with UNHCR Deputy 
Representative Mulusew Mamo to discuss the situation. Mamo 
told us that UNHCR representative Christopher Lee had offered 
to contest the NGOAB\'s allegation with the BDG, but O\'Dowd 
declined. Mamo said UNHCR will begin looking for another 
international NGO to implement the educational programs once 
Concern leaves.  BDG complaints about \"anti-repatriation 
work\" are common, Mamo added, because offering services such 
as health or education are seen as deterring repatriation. 
Such griping, he indicated, falls short of constituting a 
genuine threat. 
 
5. (C) Comment: Frustration, coordination problems, and 
differing opinions between Concern and UNHCR over education 
programs, rather than merely security, seem to be driving 
Concern\'s decision to withdraw. END COMMENT.

E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: SNAR, PGOV, BG, Narcotics 
SUBJECT: NARCOTICS ABUSE IN BANGLADESH ON THE RISE 
 
 
1. (U) Summary: The number of Bangladeshi drug addicts is 
rising.  While the media often focus on small-time dealers 
and destitute addicts, staff and a recovering addict at one 
NGO claim abuse is growing fastest among the relatively 
affluent, including college females.  End Summary. 
 
2. (U) There is no consensus number of drug addicts in 
Bangladesh, but some estimates go as high as 2.5 million. 
Local media regularly report on narcotics markets, primarily 
heroin, opium, and phensidyl, and their customers living on 
the fringes of urban society.  More uncommon is reporting on 
relatively affluent abusers, though one article quoted a 
university proctor as saying drugs on campus is \"an open 
secret.\" 
 
SIPDIS 
 
3. (SBU) Econoff recently met with Brother Ronald Drahozal, 
his deputy director, and a recovering addict of APON, 
Bangladesh\'s only 12-step substance abuse recovery program. 
They agreed that illicit drug usage in Bangladesh is 
escalating, but said that it cuts across socio-economic 
lines.  The recovering addict, who spoke good English and 
appeared educated, stated that by the time he was 13, he and 
50 percent of his classmates had experimented with cannabis 
and alcohol.  By the time they were in high school, they had 
all moved on to injectable opiates, he said. 
 
4. (SBU) Female university students, econoff was told, are 
increasingly performing opportunistic sex work to finance 
their drug habits and live fashionably.  Asked why females 
from good backgrounds would begin abusing drugs in the first 
place, the NGO staff and the recovering addict suggested the 
women had been negatively influenced by female flat mates or 
male students. 
 
5. (SBU) Comment: APON, a well regarded NGO and a former INL 
beneficiary, has an interest in communicating the worsening 
drug problem in Bangladesh.  Yet, no one disputes that abuse 
here is a growing problem, that drug education in schools is 
inadequate, and that at least some of the widespread criminal 
violence in Bangladesh -- including arms trafficking in the 
Chittagong Hill Tracts -- is narcotics related. 
Acknowledgment of the problem is a notable step in a 
conservative, Islamic society.  Bangladesh\'s imams proved to 
be valuable partners in our anti-human trafficking programs, 
and if properly approached they might be equally useful in 
anti-substance abuse initiatives.

SUBJECT: GAS WELL EXPLOSION 
 
 
1. A gas field explosion in Sunamganj forced 10,000 people 
from their homes on January 8th, sparking widespread media 
and government speculation as to the cause and extent of the 
damages.  Newspapers reported losses in millions of dollars 
and speculated that the fire would continue for 30 to 45 
days.  Experts feared that a new rig would have to be brought 
to control the fire, delaying the process by 30 days. 
 
2. According to initial reports, the explosion destroyed the 
oil rig and the well remained inaccessible by operators.  To 
control the fire, Niko, the Canada-based manager of the gas 
field, contemplated drilling sideways, 500 meters from the 
well, to relieve pressure on the well.  However, the well 
proved to be low in gas, and the fire burned itself out the 
following day. 
 
3. A Chinese subcontractor, CPTDC, operated the rig. The 
explosion destroyed the rig and caused more than $25 million 
in operational losses to Niko and the subcontractor, 
according to press reports.  Niko may also have to bear the 
additional cost of rebuilding more than 40 homes that were 
destroyed by the explosion.  Senior officials from the Energy 
Ministry and Petrobangla visited the site and announced plans 
to set up an inquiry committee.  Press reports, perhaps 
drawing on BDG officials have already blamed Niko 
\"mismanagement\" and alledgedly flawed technology for the 
blowout.
